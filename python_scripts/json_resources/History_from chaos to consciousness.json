But it is clear that at some point in our\nevolutionary past, an inner world free from passive captivity in sensory impressions came to be \u2013 a life\nof the mind, if you like. The task of this inner world was to impose order on the content of our senses;\nthat is, there came a point in our evolutionary past when our minds began to demand that the universe\nmake sense.\nBetween 250,000 and 30,000 years ago, Homo neanderthalensis, commonly known as Neanderthals,\ninhabited a territory from England across southern Europe into Asia. They built hut-like structures,\nhunted big game, and developed ceremonial rituals. The remains of this relatively short-lived group\nreflect a consciousness akin to our own. They clearly had a sense of the passage of time and of physical\nmortality. Ceremonial burials show a concern with life after death. We find in the Neanderthals the signs\nof a greater consciousness of the subtleties of the world and, in this greater consciousness, the roots of\nour own religious and scientific thinking.\nThe species to which all living humans belong, Homo sapiens, probably emerged somewhere around\n100,000 years ago. We really don\u2019t know much concerning the specific worldviews of early humans. We\nhave only some burial sites, figurines, and cave paintings to provide tantalizing hints. These suggest that\ntheir thinking was of a type that would now be called magical or superstitious. It seems clear that these\nstone-age people sought to employ magical rituals to influence the external world, hoping to positively\naffect hunting, fertility, and other survival-related aspects of their lives. Though such thinking may seem\nprimitive to us, it clearly reflects a mind attempting to bring order into the universe.\n9\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Greeks\nMany scholars believe that the magical, animistic approach to understanding the world led directly\nto the mythical approach. Repeated attempts at magic would probably give birth to ritual. Even when\nsuch a ritual outlived its original purpose or when its true meaning had become obscured over time,\nit might still remain a psychologically essential part of the culture. An appropriate myth could provide\njustification for its continuance. In any case, with the coming of civilization some 10,000 years ago, it is\nclear that the magical thinking of the earliest peoples had already evolved into mythology.\nMyths, though differing in their local details, have some common threads running through them. Often\npowerful non-human, but anthropomorphic, figures create and control the world and its inhabitants.\nMyth is always related to creation; it tells how something came into existence (the universe, human\nbeings), or how a pattern of behavior was established. This \u201cHistory\u201d is considered to be absolutely true\nand sacred.\nSurely myth arose from our need to make sense of the world as a whole, and, particularly, of our place\nas human beings in it. We see in myth attempts to find cause and effect explanations for the experienced\nworld. Early people wove basic sensory knowledge of the world into a pattern that seems reasonable. For\ninstance, the Mesopotamian creation myth used their knowledge of how silt deposits form land where\nfresh and salt water meet. Thus, although there are some obvious differences between the mytho-poetic\napproach and the scientific approach, we can also see connections. Myths are the first rungs on the ladder\nof discovery. Embedded within them are basic truths about both the universe and the human condition.\n1.2 The Birth of Science\nThe next step in our understanding of the universe was taken in ancient Greece. Although it is probably\nan exaggeration to think in terms of \u201cthe Greek miracle\u201d or of \u201cmotherless Athena,\u201d as is frequently done,\nit is clear that about 600 BCE, a new approach to understanding the universe emerged. Although the\nGreeks had their myths, they went beyond the myths to search for physical explanations. Unlike earlier\ncultures, they were not content to explain the universe in terms of the actions of the gods; the Greeks\ninsisted on thinking in terms of natural processes. This attitude is exemplified in the statement of a writer\nbelonging to the Hippocratic school on the nature of epilepsy.\n\u201cIt seems to me that the disease is no more \u2018divine\u2019 than any other. It has a natural cause, just\nas other diseases have. Men think it divine merely because they do not understand it. But if\nthey called everything divine which they do not understand, why, there would be no end of\ndivine things!\u201d\nThese proto-scientists made the remarkable assumption that an underlying rational unity and order\nexisted within the flux and variety of the world. Nature was to be explained in terms of nature itself, not\nof something fundamentally beyond nature, and in impersonal terms rather than by means of personal\ngods and goddesses. Science was born here, not motherless, to be sure, but nonetheless a new and\ndistinctly different way of looking at the world.\n10\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Greeks\nFigure 1: Map of Greece.\nThales (624\u2013547 BCE) was born in the Greek city of Miletus across the Aegean Sea from the Greek\nmainland. The inhabitants of this region were known as Ionians (Greeks who fled the Dorian invasion). Its\nlocation on the coast of Asia Minor provided Thales with exposure to the cultures of both the Babylonians\nand the Egyptians, and in fact, he visited both regions. It was his knowledge of Babylonian astronomy\nthat gave rise to the story, probably apocryphal, that he predicted the solar eclipse of May 28, 585 BCE.\nWe consider Thales the first scientist because, as far as we can tell from the admittedly incomplete\nhistorical record, he was the first to approach the world from a scientific perspective. He wondered how\nthe universe came to be and came up with an answer far different from that depicted in the creation of\nthe gods myth of Hesiod\u2019s Theogony (8th century BCE). It seemed to him that all things either came from\nmoisture or were sustained by moisture. He concluded that the universe grew from water. According to\nThales the earth is a flat disc floating on a sea of water. The unique element in the cosmology of Thales\nis the idea that the universe developed over time through natural processes from some undifferentiated\nstate. The first recorded use of a physical model in explaining a natural phenomenon is Thales belief\nthat earthquakes are caused by disturbances in the water that supports the earth.\n11\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Greeks\nThales of Miletus\n(ca 625-547 BCE)\nFirst recorded use of\n\u2022\nphysical models to\nexplain natural\nphenomena\nBelieved universe\n\u2022\ndeveloped over time\nthrough natural\nprocesses\nWater is the\n\u2022\nfundamental material\nFigure 2: Thales of Miletus.\nAs with any human being, Thales was constrained by the level of knowledge available at the time and by\nthe cultural and intellectual context in which he found himself. It is clear that the earlier mytho-poetic\ntradition exerted a strong influence on him. For example, from Aristotle we learn that included in Thales\u2019\nmetaphysical and cosmological doctrines was the idea that inanimate objects that move and are moved\n(magnets and iron, amber and wool) possess souls. It\u2019s hard to know what Thales meant by this exactly,\nbut on the surface of it, it doesn\u2019t strike us as particularly scientific.\nThales had a student named Anaximander (610\u2013546 BCE). He introduced the notion of a spherical\nuniverse, an idea that survived for more than 2000 years. He saw the earth as suspended in space (rather\nthat floating on water). He also believed that living creatures arose from the moist elements when it had\nbeen partially evaporated by the sun. According to Anaximander, humans in the remote past resembled\nfish. Perhaps the first theory of biological evolution.\nIn the second half of the fifth century, the approach of Thales and Anaximander was adopted and extended\nby Leucippus of Miletus (fl. 440 BCE) and Democrutus of Abdera (c. 470\u2013c. 400 BCE). Democritus\nconstructed a complex explanation of all phenomena as the result of material interactions. He taught\nthat the world was composed exclusively of uncaused and immutable material atoms. These invisibly\nminute and indivisible particles perpetually moved about in a boundless void and by their random\ncollisions and varying combinations produced the phenomena of the visible world. This concept is\nknown as materialism. In the words of Democritus, \u201cnothing exists except atoms and the void; all else\nis mere opinion.\u201d\n12\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Greeks\nIt is interesting to note that a central concept in the thinking of Thales, Anaximander, and Democritus is\nthat there is no real distinction between the terrestrial and celestial realms. Only later did Greek thinking\nregress to needing a fifth essence (the quintessence) for celestial objects. These early Greek thinkers,\nknown as the presocratics, were the first we know of to systematically seek natural explanations of natural\nphenomena. The Babylonians and ancient Hebrews had a literature embodying stories expressing awe\nabout the heavens and the earth. However, they concerned themselves with the question \u2018why\u2019, and did\nnot attempt to answer the question \u2018how.\u2019\nSocrates\n(470-399 BCE)\nMore interested in ethics\n\u2022\nand logic than cosmologies\nGenuine happiness through\n\u2022\nself knowledge\nRigorous dialogue exposes\n\u2022\nfalse knowledge and can\nlead to the truth\nFigure 3: Socrates.\nThis earlier and simpler phase of Greek thought terminates in the fifth century with a thinker of an\nentirely different type, Socrates (470\u2013399 BCE). With Socrates and his student Plato (427\u2013347 BCE), we\nhave a unique synthesis of Greek science and Greek religion. They taught that the visible world contains\nwithin it a deeper meaning, in some sense both rational and mythic in character, which is reflected in\nthe material world but which emanates from an eternal dimension that is both source and goal of all\nexistence. This is described in some detail in The Dual Legacy, pp. 69\u201372 in Richard Tarnas\u2019 book, The\nPassion of the Western Mind.\n13\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Greeks\nFigure 4: Plato\nAAAAAAXXXXXXAAAAAA GGGGGGlllllloooooobbbbbbaaaaaallllll\nGGGGGGrrrrrraaaaaadddddduuuuuuaaaaaatttttteeeeee PPPPPPrrrrrrooooooggggggrrrrrraaaaaammmmmm\nFFFFFFiiiiiinnnnnndddddd oooooouuuuuutttttt mmmmmmoooooorrrrrreeeeee aaaaaannnnnndddddd aaaaaappppppppppppllllllyyyyyy\n14\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Greeks\nWith Aristotle (348\u2013322 BCE), a student of Plato\u2019s and a teacher of Alexander the Great, the pendulum\nbegan to swing back toward the more down-to-earth perspective of the presocratics. Plato asserted the\nexistence of archetypal Ideas or Forms as primary, while the visible objects of conventional reality are\ntheir direct derivatives. These Ideas, according to Plato, possess a quality of being, a degree of reality,\nthat is superior to that of the concrete world. On the other hand, Aristotle assumed that true reality was\nthe perceptible world of concrete objects, rather than the imperceptible world of Plato\u2019s eternal Ideas.\nAristotle placed a new and fruitful stress on the value of observation and classification. Aristotle\u2019s writings\nwere the first to create a comprehensive system of philosophy, encompassing morality and aesthetics,\nlogic and science, politics and metaphysics. He provided a language and logic, a foundation and structure,\nand, not least, a formidably authoritative figure without which the philosophy, theology, and science of\nthe West could not have developed as they did.\nAristotelian philosophy, in a more or less modified form, was absorbed by the various philosophical\nschools of antiquity and, as discussed in a later chapter, played a very important role in the history of\nChristian thought.\nAristotle\n(384-322 BCE)\nTrue reality is the perceptible\n\u2022\nworld of concrete objects,\nnot the imperceptible world\nof eternal Ideas\nKnowledge is attainable\n\u2022\nthrough the senses and not\njust through the intellect\nFigure 5: Aristotle\n1.3 The Greek Worldview\nThe Greek worldview is based primarily on the teachings of Aristotle and its defining characteristic is\nthat it is geocentric. It is the most long-lived cosmological model in history, lasting into the 17th century.\n15\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Greeks\nAristotle taught that the universe was spherical and finite, with rotating spheres carrying the moon, sun,\nplanets, and stars around a stationary earth at its center. To support the fact that the earth did not move,\nhe pointed out that if the earth were in motion, an observer on it would see the fixed stars as shifting\ntheir positions with respect to one another, a phenomenon known as parallax. However, parallax was\nnot observed.\nAristotle offered several proofs that the earth was a sphere. One such proof involved lunar eclipses. At\nthe time, it was known that lunar eclipses were caused by the shadow of the earth falling on the moon.\nThe fact that the shadow was always circular showed that the earth was a sphere. He also pointed out\nthat when one travels northward or southward, the position of the North Star changes with respect to\nthe horizon. To further bolster his argument that the earth was the immovable center of the universe,\nhe proposed a comprehensive theory of motion that required all earthly substances to naturally move\ntoward the center of the earth.\nAristotle accepted Empedocles\u2019 view that there are four earthly elements, earth, air, fire, and water.\nAristotle added an additional element called aether or quintessence (fifth element), which he believed\ncomposed the celestial bodies. However, Aristotle rejected, on grounds of logic, Democritus\u2019 view of\natoms. Because atoms have extension in space, they could not be indivisible. Extension in space also\nimplies composition and therefore atoms could not be elementary. Aristotle proposed that matter is\ncontinuous and infinitely divisible.\nIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Greeks\nAristotle\u2019s view of the universe was hierarchical, and he made a sharp distinction between the sublunar\nworld of change, and the eternal and immutable heavens. Not only were they composed of different\nmaterials, they obeyed different laws.\nA Greek thinker living after Aristotle, Aristarchus (c. 310\u2013230 BCE), used geometric arguments based on\neclipses and the phases of the moon to estimate the relative sizes of earth, moon, and sun. He showed that\nthe sun was many times larger than the earth and that the moon was much smaller. Reasoning that the\nsmaller object should orbit the larger object, he concluded that the sun not the earth was the center of the\nuniverse, and that the earth orbited the sun once a year while spinning on its axis once every 24 hours.\nThis idea was taken seriously by Greek thinkers but ultimately rejected. If the earth were to orbit the sun,\nthe positions of the stars must show parallax, which was not observed. Aristarchus argued that it was\nnot observed because the nearest stars are at extremely great distances compared to the distance from\nthe earth to the sun. In fact, the correct explanation. The nearest stars are so far away that parallax was\nnot observed until the early 1800s, long after it had been established that the earth did orbit the sun.\nEratosthenes (c. 276\u2013195 BCE), a younger contemporary of Aristarchus, used geometry to determine\nthe circumference of the earth. It was known that at noon on a particular day of the year, the sun shone\ndirectly down a vertical well in Syene in southern Egypt. At that same time in Alexandria, north of\nSyene, the sun was not directly overhead, Eratosthenes was able to measure the angle that the sun made\nwith the vertical as one-fiftieth of a circle (about 7o). From this, he was able to conclude that the earth\u2019s\ncircumference is 50 times the distance between Alexandria and Syene.\nIt is not possible to evaluate precisely the accuracy of Eratosthenes\u2019 solution because there is some\nuncertainty about the length of the unit he used. However, it is certain that his value was within 20% of\nthe correct answer and may have been as close as 1%. (Eratosthenes\u2019 value was much closer to correct\nthan the one used by Columbus almost 2000 years later. Columbus thought the earth was much smaller\nthan it is. Had he known and accepted Eratosthenes\u2019 value, it would have been obvious that he could\nnot reach China by sailing west.)\nHipparchus (c. 190 BC\u2013c. 120 BC), refined the method of Aristarchus for measuring the relative distances\nand sizes for the earth, moon, and sun, and obtained better results. He compiled an accurate catalog\nof the positions of over 850 stars. Hipparchus had access to 1000 years of Babylonian records of star\npositions. By comparing these with his own, he was able to determine that the earth\u2019s axis of rotation\nsweeps around in a cone much like the motion of a top inclined with respect to the vertical. The earth\u2019s\naxis takes about 26,000 years for one complete sweep. This motion is referred to as the precession of\nthe equinoxes.\n17\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Greeks\nThe contribution made by Hipparchus represent the last significant contribution to science made by\nthe Greeks until the time of Ptolemy in the second century of the Common Era. By that time Greek\nscience and culture had spread to the entire Mediterranean region. This spread was due primarily to\nAlexander the Great.\nAlexander\u2019s father, Philip II was king of Macedonia, a region directly north of Greece, from 359 BCE\nuntil his assignation in 336 BCE. Philip chose Aristotle as tutor for Alexander. Upon ascending to the\nthrone upon his father\u2019s assignation, Alexander continued his father\u2019s military campaigns. He eventually\nextending the empire from India to Spain, including Persia and Egypt, resulting in the universalization\nof Greek culture throughout the Mediterranean region..\nClaudius Ptolemaeus, better known as Ptolemy, lived in Alexandria, Egypt in the middle of the second\ncentury CE. Relying heavily on the work of Hipparchus, Ptolemy compiled 13 volumes containing all\nknown astronomical knowledge. Some of the material was original with Ptolemy.\nPtolemy is best known for his detailed geocentric model of the universe. The notion that celestial motions\nmust always be represented by constant speeds and circular orbits was well established in Greek thought.\nPtolemy retained this concept but added additional circles within circles to more accurately represent the\nobserved locations of the planets in the sky. Although the model was very cumbersome, it was sufficiently\naccurate to remain the accepted view of the universe until the 17th century.\n9999999933333333%%%%%%%%\nOOOOOOOOFFFFFFFF MMMMMMMMIIIIIIIIMMMMMMMM SSSSSSSSTTTTTTTTUUUUUUUUDDDDDDDDEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNTTTTTTTTSSSSSSSS AAAAAAAARRRRRRRREEEEEEEE\nWWWWWWWWOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRKKKKKKKKIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNGGGGGGGG IIIIIIIINNNNNNNN TTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRR SSSSSSSSEEEEEEEECCCCCCCCTTTTTTTTOOOOOOOORRRRRRRR 33333333 MMMMMMMMOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNTTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHSSSSSSSS\nFFFFFFFFOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNGGGGGGGG GGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTIIIIIIIIOOOOOOOONNNNNNNN\nMMMMMMMMAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSTTTTTTTTEEEEEEEERRRRRRRR IIIIIIIINNNNNNNN MMMMMMMMAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGEEEEEEEEMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNTTTTTTTT\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 SSSSSSSSTTTTTTTTUUUUUUUUDDDDDDDDYYYYYYYY IIIIIIIINNNNNNNN TTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEE CCCCCCCCEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNTTTTTTTTEEEEEEEERRRRRRRR OOOOOOOOFFFFFFFF MMMMMMMMAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIDDDDDDDD AAAAAAAANNNNNNNNDDDDDDDD TTTTTTTTAAAAAAAAKKKKKKKKEEEEEEEE AAAAAAAADDDDDDDDVVVVVVVVAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNTTTTTTTTAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGEEEEEEEE OOOOOOOOFFFFFFFF TTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEE UUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNIIIIIIIIQQQQQQQQUUUUUUUUEEEEEEEE OOOOOOOOPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS\nLLLLLLLLeeeeeeeennnnnnnnggggggggtttttttthhhhhhhh:::::::: 11111111OOOOOOOO MMMMMMMMOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNTTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHSSSSSSSS\nTTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAATTTTTTTT TTTTTTTTHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEE CCCCCCCCAAAAAAAAPPPPPPPPIIIIIIIITTTTTTTTAAAAAAAALLLLLLLL OOOOOOOOFFFFFFFF SSSSSSSSPPPPPPPPAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIINNNNNNNN OOOOOOOOFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRSSSSSSSS\nAAAAAAAAvvvvvvvv........

One of the\nlast guardians of this knowledge was Hypatia (c. 375\u2013415 CE). An accomplished astronomer, she invented\nastronomical navigational devices and wrote a commentary on Ptolemy\u2019s work. At the time there was\nconsiderable conflict between the newly emerging Christian community and science, which they viewed\nas a pagan philosophy detrimental to the Christian faith. Hypatia was a pagan.

However, the Greek\ntradition was carried on in the Islamic cultures. In the century, following the death of Muhammad\n(c. 570\u2013632 CE), his followers conquered all the Middle East to India, as well as North Africa and most\nof Spain. By 750, they had become tolerant of diverse ideas and attitudes, and conditions for intellectual\nlife improved significantly in their domains. For the next 250 years, the caliphs of Baghdad became\npatrons of science and the city a center of learning. By the eleventh century the library of the caliph of\nCairo contained roughly 150,000 volumes. By contrast, a Western monastery considered itself fortunate\nto have 150.\n19\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Greeks\nAn important factor in the development of Islamic science was the old Greek writings that the Arabs\nfound in the lands they conquered. Within just a few decades after 750, the major Greek scientific works\nwere translated into Arabic. By the end of the tenth century essentially all the known Greek manuscripts\nhad been translated. The atmosphere of tolerance was such that this work was done by Christians, Jews,\nand pagans, as well as by Islamic scholars.\nThe religious requirements of Islam were a powerful impetus to the study of astronomy. For example,\nIslam adopted (and generally still uses) a strictly lunar calendar, which, however, begins not at the time\nof the new moon, but at the first sighting of the crescent moon just after sunset. Calculating when this\noccurs requires fairly complex geometry. Since the lunar year is about 354 days long, the months of the\nIslamic year cycle through the seasons in about 33 years. Mosques had to be oriented toward Mecca,\nand Muslims were to pray facing in that direction. Furthermore, time-keeping was required to properly\nset the five times for daily prayer.\nIn attacking such problems, Islamic scholars developed mathematics, especially trigonometry and\nspherical geometry, far surpassing the Greeks. They learned of the \u2018sine\u2019 trigonometric function from\nIndia, and invented the other five. They also derived some of the relations among these trigonometric\nfunctions, such as the law of sines. With these developments, it was far easier to solve the geometric\nproblems of astronomy. The Arabs also used a system of numbers that included the concept of zero,\nwhich they had acquired from India. This was later adopted by the West. These Arabic numerals, as they\nare called, replaced Roman numerals, primarily because they are far easier to calculate with. Arab texts\ndescribing these new mathematical developments, as well as various summaries and commentaries on\nGreek and Roman texts, eventually found their way to the West, where they became standard works\nfor centuries.\nFrom the scientific point of view, however, the Muslims\u2019 most important contribution was that they\npreserved much of the Greek learning. Beginning around the year 1000, these texts made their way\nback into Europe. Cities near the boundaries between Islamic and Christian domains, such as Toledo\nin Spain, became centers of a \u201ctranslation industry\u201d (from Arabic to Latin) and Arabic words such as\nzenith, nadir, alchemy, algebra, and algorithm entered our language, along with star names such as Algol,\nAldebaran, Alcor, Vega, Deneb, and Betelgeuse.\nPerhaps the best known, and most significant, text recovered from the Islamic culture is the Almagest,\nthe English name derived from the Arabic, al-majisti, meaning \u2018the greatest.\u2019 The Almagest was written\nby Ptolemy in about 150 CE and translated into Arabic about 827. In the last half of the 12th century,\nit was translated from Arabic to Latin and served as the basis for European astronomy until about the\nbeginning of the 17th century.\n20\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the Reformation\n2 T he Middle Ages,\nthe Renaissance, and\nthe Reformation\nYour goals for this chapter are to know the following:\n\u2022 Characterize and give approximate dates for the following historical eras: the Greco-Roman\n(Classical) era, the Early Middle Ages (Dark Ages), Late Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and\nthe Reformation.\n\u2022 What were some of the advances that occurred in the Late Middle Ages the differentiated it\nfrom the Early Middle Ages and eventually led to the Renaissance?\n\u2022 What roles did the Christian church play in history from its beginnings up through the Early\nMiddle Ages?\nThe Romans began building their empire in the 4th century BCE and eventually controlled the entire\nMediterranean world. They conquered Greece in the 2nd century BCE. However, the Romans recognized\nthe superiority of much of Greek thought and culture and incorporated it into their culture. The resulting\ncivilization is known as Greco-Roman.\nIn 313 CE the Roman emperor Constantine issued the Edit of Milan recognizing the right of Christians\nto practice their religion within the Empire. Gradually Christianity became its official religion. By the\n4th century, the Empire was beginning to collapse. Commerce, particularly seaborne commerce, was in\ndecline as was the population, especially in urban areas. The area under the control of Rome was shrinking\nand Rome itself was being subjected to barbarian invasions. This period of time is usually referred to as\nLate Antiquity. This is a transitional period, during which the ancient world slid slowly into the medieval.\n2.1 Late Antiquity and The Early Middle Ages\nThe Middle Ages is a derogatory term coined after the fact to reflect the view that this period was a time\nof intellectual stagnation between that of classical (Greco-Roman) culture and its later reestablishment\nduring the Renaissance (rebirth). At the time it first appeared in the 15th century, it referred to the period\nfrom the fall of the Roman Empire (~500 CE) to the beginning of the Renaissance (~1350). Later, the\nterm referred to the division of history into Classical, Medieval, and Modern. More recent scholarship\nhas somewhat modified the earlier divisions. Recognizing that the Roman Empire was in serious decline\nbefore 500 and that some aspects of Greco-Roman culture continued after 500, the era Late Antiquity\nwas added.\n21\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the Reformation\nVarious dates have been given for these eras. One version accepted by many scholars is: Late Antiquity\n(300\u2013700), Early Middle Ages (700\u20131000), Late (or High) Middle Ages (1000\u20131350), and Renaissance\n(1350\u20131600). These dates are somewhat arbitrary and, of course, do not correspond to abrupt,\ndiscontinuous cultural changes.\nAlthough the term Dark Ages is no longer used to characterize Late Antiquity and the Early Middle\nAges, these eras were none the less a time of wide spread political insecurity, famine, and illiteracy. As\nthe authority of secular Rome declined, the vacuum was slowly filled by the Roman Church. By 500 the\nChurch was essentially the only authority in Western Europe.\nAlmost from the beginning of Christianity, safeguarding the faith was the Church\u2019s almost exclusive\npriority. Dialogue was often curtailed all together least faith be undermined and the authority of the\nChurch questioned. There was a reaction against the pagan philosophers. Tertullian, a 3rd century Church\nleader, said \u201cWhat has Athens to do with Jerusalem?\u201d One consequence is that the value of observing,\nanalyzing or understanding the natural world was greatly diminished. \u201dThe pluralism of classical culture,\nwith its multiplicity of philosophies, its diversity of polytheistic mythologies, and its plethora of mystery\nreligions, gave way to an emphatically monolithic system \u2013 one God, one Church, one Truth.\u201d Richard\nTarnas, The Passion of the Western Mind, p. 118\u2013119.\n22\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the Reformation\nNeedless to say, not much progress in the understanding of the universe was made during this period.\nIn fact, just the opposite. Much of what was known in the classical era was lost. Books were burned. For\nthe Church authorities, direct study of the natural world was seen as a threat to the integrity of religious\nfaith and thus to salvation.\nOne of the more absurd results of this was a rejection of the idea of a spherical earth, in part because the\nidea was supported by the pagan philosophers. Instead, the universe was seen as shaped like the Holy\nTabernacle; the earth enclosed within a domed rectangular box. Based on the story in Genesis that the\nfirmament is enclosed by water, the model included super-celestial waters resting on top of the tabernacle.\nNot until about the end of the 9th century was the idea of a spherical earth reinstated.\n2.2 The Late Middle Ages\nIn the later Middle Ages, Christianity\u2019s earlier need to distinguish and strengthen itself by the more or\nless rigid exclusion of pagan culture lost some of its urgency, and a more relaxed attitude toward secular\nlearning developed. \u201cIt seems to me a case of negligence if, after becoming firm in our faith, we do not\nstrive to understand what we believe.\u201d Saint Anselm of Canterbury, (1033\u20131109). Contrast this with the\nattitude of Tertullian in the 3rd century, \u201cAll curiosity is at an end after Jesus, all research after the Gospel.\nLet us have Faith and wish for nothing more.\u201d\nThe change in the Church\u2019s attitude was accelerated by the rediscovery of a large body of Aristotle\u2019s\nwritings that had been preserved by Islamic and Byzantine cultures in the East. The Arabic and Greek text\nwere translated into Latin and widely circulated in the new universities of the West. At first the Church\ntried to suppress the teachings of Aristotle as they were in conflict with those of neo-Platonism which\nSaint Augustine, in the early 5th century, had established as the philosophical foundation of Christianity.\nThis turned out to be impossible, and finally in the mid-13th century, Saint Thomas Aquinas was able\nto integrate Aristotle with Christian theology, in much the way that Augustine had before with Plato.\nAquinas blended Aristotelian philosophy and Christian doctrine by suggesting that rational thinking and\nthe study of nature, like revelation, were valid ways to understand truths pertaining to God. According\nto Aquinas, God reveals himself through nature, so to study nature is to study God. The writings of\nAquinas became the new philosophical foundation for the Christian religion and Aquinas\u2019 view of the\nrelationship between God and the universe became the cosmological worldview of the Late Middle.\nFor Aquinas, there is really no difference between the creation of the universe and its continued existence.\nAquinas argued that the relation of a clock to the clockmaker is very different from the relation of the\nuniverse to its Creator. Once the clock is made, it no longer has a relationship of dependence on its maker.\nHowever, since the universe was created from nothing rather than pre-existing materials, as is the case\nwith the clock, the universe would fall back into non-being without the Creator\u2019s continuing omnipotent\nsupport. God sustains the world. Nature is infused with God\u2019s power and intentions. Thus, for Aquinas,\nknowledge of God can be obtained through natural science due to God\u2019s omnipresence in the universe.\n23\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the Reformation\nThomas Aquinas\n(1225 1274 * Italian)\n\u2013\n1244 becomes a Dominican\n\u2022\nmonk.\n1265 1273 writes Summa\n\u2022 \u2013\nTheologicia, the\nphilosophical foundation\nfor Christianity in the Late\nMiddle Ages.\n1323 canonized.\n\u2022\nFigure 1 Thomas Aquinas\nWe will return later to the relationship between a clock and its maker. For some people of the\nEnlightenment, the relationship between the universe and its Creator is precisely the same as that\nbetween the clock and the clockmaker. This idea is called Deism. For others, the clockmaker analogy is\nused as an argument for God \u2013 the cosmological argument or the argument from design. This argument\nhas recently been made by proponents of Intelligent Design who have proposed that it be taught in the\npublic schools as an alternative to evolution.\nThrough the work of Aquinas and other Scholastics, the Aristotelian-Ptolemaic cosmology was\nreintroduced to Europeans and, at the same time, permeated with Christian meaning. This model was\nenthusiastically embraced by the Italian poet Dante Alighieri. In his epic poem La Divina Commedia,\nhe presents a moral, religious, and cosmological paradigm whose cosmological architecture created a\ncomprehensive Christian mythology, one encompassing the whole of creation. The Commedia beautifully\nsummarizes the late medieval worldview.\nIn retrospect, the blending of Aristotelian thought with theology may have been a mistake. Because the\ncosmology of Aristotle was so fundamentally a part of his philosophy, the synthesis had the (perhaps\nunintended) consequence of making the Greek view of the physical universe a part of Christian dogma.\nThe Church became locked into a geocentric model of the universe. During the Scientific Revolution this\nwould bring the Church into direct conflict with science, one factor that eventually eroded its authority.\n24\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos

Innovations in agriculture resulted in population increases, particular in the\ncities. A middle class began to develop. There was a corresponding increase in literacy.\n2.3 The Renaissance\nThe Renaissance began in Italy sometime around the mid-14th century. It can be characterized by a\nnumber of cultural shifts. Primarily it was a rebirth of Greco-Roman culture, the literal meaning of\nrenaissance. The Italian commercial and aristocratic elites saw classical culture as a source not just\nfor scientific knowledge and rules for logical discourse, as it had been for the Scholastics of the Late\nMiddle Ages, but for the deepening and enrichment of the human spirit. There was a reaction against\nAristotle and a revival of Platonism, in part because of his superior literary style. Humanist scholars\nand artists flourished in the new cultural climate. Forsaking the ideal of monastic poverty, Renaissance\nman embraced the enrichment of life afforded by personal wealth. \u201cThere was\u2026an emphatic emergence\nof a new consciousness \u2013 expansive, rebellious, energetic and creative, individualistic, ambitious and\noften unscrupulous, curious, self-confident, committed to this life and this world.\u201d Richard Tarnas, The\nPassion of the Western Mind, p. 231. All in all, the Renaissance thinkers had a much more positive view\nof humanity and its capacities than was true in the Middle Ages.\nAlthough many of the cultural changes, particularly the new curious, self-confident individualism,\nwould eventually lead to renewed interest in the universe, this was not the case initially. The humanists\nfavored human-centered subjects like politics and history over the study of natural philosophy or applied\nmathematics. Later, however, interest did turn to restoration of the ancient knowledge of the universe.\nSome refer to this period as the Scientific Renaissance. This in turn, led to the Scientific Revolution of\nthe 17th century. The emphasis of the Renaissance was on the recovery of knowledge, whereas in the\nScientific Revolution the emphasis shifted from recovery to discovery.\n2.4 The Reformation\nThe Reformation is the era of European history when the monolithic Roman Church was splintered\ninto many different denominations. Because the Church was such a powerful influence in all aspects\nof medieval life, the Reformation was a significant social and political event as well as a religious one.\n26\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the Reformation\nThere were many factors that led to the Reformation. The Roman Catholic hierarchy had become wealthy,\nsecular, and often openly corrupt and immoral. This, in sharp contrast to the deep piety and poverty of\nthe Church faithful. In a sense, the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back was the selling of indulgences. The\nindulgences could be used to absolve sins and to lessen after-death punishments for the contributor or\nany of his or her relatives. It was clearly a scam. In 1517, Martin Luther, a German monk, nailed his 95\ntheses against the selling of indulgences to a church door in Wittenberg. The rise of nationalism was\nan important factor in Luther\u2019s success as he was protected from papal authority by German princes.\nWithin the next few decades, several other religious discenters would break with the Roman Church to\nform what would come to be called Protestant denominations.\nMartin Luther\n(1483 - 1546 * Germany)\n1507 -near-death experience and\n\u2022\nvow to become a monk.\n1517 -nails Ninety-five Theses\n\u2022\nagainst indulgences to church\ndoor.\nBible is the only spiritual\n\u2022\nauthority.\nPriesthood of all believers.\n\u2022\nSalvation by faith alone.\n\u2022\nFigure 3: Martin Luther\nAlthough the Reformation had primarily religious and social rather than scientific consequences, many\nbelieve that it was an important step leading to the Scientific Revolution and the return to serious\nattempts, for the first time in over 1000 years of Western European history, to come to terms with the\nphysical universe. Perhaps the most important factor was the break Protestant theology made with\nAquinas\u2019 view that the universe is infused with God\u2019s presence and hence sacred in its own right. In the\nProtestant worldview, the supernatural was almost completely disconnected from the natural. However,\nif God is radically transcendent, and thus isolated from nature, nature becomes simply an object to be\nused for human purposes. This change in worldview is a shift in the direction of the modern worldview\nproduced by the Scientific Revolution.\n27\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Scientific Revolution\n3 The Scientific Revolution\nYour goals for this chapter are to know the following:\n\u2022 What is meant by the Scientific Revolution that took place between the times of Copernicus and\nNewton? In what ways did the modern world-view that resulted from the Scientific Revolution\ndiffer from the ancient world-view?\n\u2022 How did the science of Galileo differ from that of the Greeks (Aristotle)? What were Galileo\u2019s\nmost significant contributions?\n\u2022 What was the most significant contribution of Copernicus? Brahe? Kepler? Newton?\n\u2022 What is the scientific method? What does it mean to say that in order for a statement to be\nscientific it must be falsifiable?\n\u2022 What is meant by a mechanistic-deterministic worldview? Why is a clockwork a good analogy\nfor the mechanistic-deterministic worldview? What are Diests?\n3.1 Nicolaus Copernicus\nHistory I generally divided into eras each of which can be characterized in a way that differentiates it\nfrom all others. But, in fact, these eras blend, more or less gradually, into one another. For example, there\nis a sense in which the Scientific Revolution is simply a continuation of the Renaissance. History also\nhas a tendency to date the various eras in round numbers. For instance the Late Middle Ages is usually\nsaid to have occurred between the years 1000 and 1350 and the Renaissance between 1350 and 1600.\nThe Scientific Revolution is usually said to have occurred in the 17th century. However, all treatments\nof the Scientific Revolution inevitably begin with Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish canon in a Catholic\ncathedral in the first half of the 15th century \u2013 a thoroughly Renaissance man in both time and spirit.\nCopernicus was a scholar rather than a scientist in the modern sense of the word. As scholars of the time\ndid, he immersed himself in the newly translated classical literature, not with the intention of making\nnew discoveries, but of recovering old discoveries. Copernicus is sometimes credited with discovering the\nheliocentric model of the solar system. In fact he read about it in a book. Greek thinkers had proposed\nit centuries before the common era, principle among them, Aristarchus.\nCopernicus read of this suggestion and realized that it explained in a simple manner many things about\nthe motion of the planets that had complex, implausible explanations using Ptolemy\u2019s geocentric model.\nCopernicus felt that a satisfactory representation of the solar system should be coherent and physically\nplausible, not requiring a different construction for each phenomenon, as Ptolemy\u2019s system did. To him,\nPtolemy\u2019s system was ugly and therefore could not represent the work of the Creator.\n28\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Scientific Revolution\n(Upon hearing in the late 13th century of Ptolemy\u2019s model of the universe and of the extremely complicated\nmathematics it required, Pope Alfonso X, is said to have replied, \u201cIf the Lord Almighty had consulted\nme before embarking on creation, I should have recommended something simpler.)\nAs early as 1514, Copernicus circulated among his friends a short manuscript describing his heliocentric\nviews. However, he was reluctant to publish. Most scholars believe that it was not fear of the Church\nthat caused his reluctance. The Church did not take a hard line on the issue at the time. In fact, it was\nin general supportive of Copernicus. It was only later, during the counter-Reformation, that people such\nas Giordano Bruno and Galileo Galilei suffered retribution for their views on the nature of the universe.\nIn 1533, Johann Widmannstetter, personal secretary to Pope Clement VII, delivered a series of lectures\nin the Vatican gardens, outlining Copernicus\u2019 theory. Clement and several Cardinals heard the lectures\nand were interested in the theory. Clements successor, Paul III, probably heard of Copernicus\u2019 ideas from\nCardinal Schonberg, a confident of popes Leo X, Clement VII, and Paul III. At Paul\u2019s urging, Schonberg\nwrote Copernicus on 1 November 1536, saying in part, \u201cTherefore, learned man, without wishing to\nbe inopportune, I beg you most emphatically to communicate your discovery to the learned world\u2026\u201d\nEEEEEEEEEEExxxxxxxxxxxccccccccccceeeeeeeeeeelllllllllllllllllllllleeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnnnttttttttttt EEEEEEEEEEEcccccccccccooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnooooooooooommmmmmmmmmmiiiiiiiiiiicccccccccccsssssssssss aaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnddddddddddd BBBBBBBBBBBuuuuuuuuuuusssssssssssiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnneeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssssssssssss ppppppppppprrrrrrrrrrrooooooooooogggggggggggrrrrrrrrrrraaaaaaaaaaammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssss aaaaaaaaaaattttttttttt:::::::::::\n\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201c\u201cTTTTTTTTTTThhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeee pppppppppppeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrfffffffffffeeeeeeeeeeecccccccccccttttttttttt ssssssssssstttttttttttaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrttttttttttt\nooooooooooofffffffffff aaaaaaaaaaa sssssssssssuuuuuuuuuuucccccccccccccccccccccceeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssssssssssssfffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuulllllllllll,,,,,,,,,,,\niiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnttttttttttteeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrnnnnnnnnnnnaaaaaaaaaaatttttttttttiiiiiiiiiiiooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnaaaaaaaaaaalllllllllll cccccccccccaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrr...........\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201d\nCCCCCCCCCCCLLLLLLLLLLLIIIIIIIIIIICCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKK HHHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEE\ntttttttttttooooooooooo dddddddddddiiiiiiiiiiissssssssssscccccccccccooooooooooovvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrr wwwwwwwwwwwhhhhhhhhhhhyyyyyyyyyyy bbbbbbbbbbbooooooooooottttttttttthhhhhhhhhhh sssssssssssoooooooooooccccccccccciiiiiiiiiiiaaaaaaaaaaallllllllllllllllllllllyyyyyyyyyyy\naaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnddddddddddd aaaaaaaaaaacccccccccccaaaaaaaaaaadddddddddddeeeeeeeeeeemmmmmmmmmmmiiiiiiiiiiicccccccccccaaaaaaaaaaallllllllllllllllllllllyyyyyyyyyyy ttttttttttthhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeee UUUUUUUUUUUnnnnnnnnnnniiiiiiiiiiivvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrsssssssssssiiiiiiiiiiitttttttttttyyyyyyyyyyy\nooooooooooofffffffffff GGGGGGGGGGGrrrrrrrrrrrooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnniiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnngggggggggggeeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnnn iiiiiiiiiiisssssssssss ooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnneeeeeeeeeee ooooooooooofffffffffff ttttttttttthhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeee bbbbbbbbbbbeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssssttttttttttt\nppppppppppplllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaccccccccccceeeeeeeeeeesssssssssss fffffffffffooooooooooorrrrrrrrrrr aaaaaaaaaaa ssssssssssstttttttttttuuuuuuuuuuudddddddddddeeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnnnttttttttttt tttttttttttooooooooooo bbbbbbbbbbbeeeeeeeeeee\nwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww...........rrrrrrrrrrruuuuuuuuuuuggggggggggg...........nnnnnnnnnnnlllllllllll///////////fffffffffffeeeeeeeeeeebbbbbbbbbbb///////////eeeeeeeeeeeddddddddddduuuuuuuuuuucccccccccccaaaaaaaaaaatttttttttttiiiiiiiiiiiooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnn\n29\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Scientific Revolution\nIn spite of this support, Copernicus waited six years after receiving Schonberg\u2019s encouraging letter to\npublish. Finally, however, his friend and student, George Rheticus, convinced him that it was time to do\nso. Copernicus died in 1543. He is said to have received a copy of the printed book, consisting of about\n200 pages written in Latin, for the first time on his deathbed. The book is entitled, On the Revolutions\nof the Celestial Spheres.\nThe likely explanation for his reluctance to publish is that Copernicus was concerned about how his ideas\nwould be received by both the devout masses and by his fellow scholars, all deeply committed to the\nAristotelian point of view. To put this outrageous idea forward with no evidence, other than its greater\nsimplicity, would invite heavy criticism. In his dedication of the book to Pope Paul III, he mentions his\nconcern that after people heard of his views, he would be \u201chissed off the stage.\u201d Additionally, Copernicus\nwas a perfectionist, always striving to improve his presentation of the theory.\nNicolaus Copernicus\n(1473-1543 * Poland)\nReintroduced the heliocentric model\n\u2022 Simplified explanation of: retrograde motion,\nvariable brightness of planets, Mercury and\nVenus always appearing near Sun\nOpposed because:\n\u2022 It contradicted the Bible\n\u2022 Geocentric universe had been incorporated into\nthe very theology of Christianity (heaven, hell,\nthe centrality of humanity)\n\u2022 The evidence available at the time strongly\nsuggested that the earth did not move\nFighre 1: Nicolaus Copernicus\nThe initial religious reaction against the theory came not from the Catholics but from the Protestants.\nThe Copernican hypothesis contradicted several passages in Holy Scripture concerning the fixity of the\nearth, and Scripture was Protestantism\u2019s one absolute authority. Even before the publication of the book,\nMartin Luther heard of the theory and is reported to have said, \u201cThe fool wants to turn the whole art of\nastronomy upside-down. However, as Holy Scripture tells us, Joshua bid the sun to stand still and not\nthe earth.\u201d The Catholic Church did eventually, 73 years after its publication, put the book on the Index\nof books Catholics were forbidden to read.\n30\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Scientific Revolution\n3.2 Tycho Brahe\nCopernicus got it right about the earth going around the sun, but he got the orbits in which the earth and\nother planets orbit the sun wrong. Copernicus\u2019 model continued to use the circles-within-circles orbits\nof Ptolemy\u2019s model. His model consisted of a moving earth in a cosmos otherwise ruled by Aristotelian\nand Ptolemaic assumptions. Observations soon showed that Copernicus\u2019 model was somewhat better\nat predicting the exact locations of the planets in the sky at some future date, but still not completely\naccurate. Both models had to be wrong. The Danish astronomer, Tycho Brahe, set himself the task of\ncoming up with the correct model.\nBrahe realized that progress in astronomy required systematic, rigorous observation, night after night,\nusing the most accurate instruments available. This program became his life\u2019s work. Brahe improved and\nenlarged existing instruments, and built entirely new ones. The telescope had not been inverted yet, so\nall of Brahe\u2019s instruments were naked-eye. Brahe began making observations and recording data in 1572\nand continued to do so until his death in 1601.\nHis model of the solar system was a hybrid of the geocentric and the heliocentric. The simpler explanations\nfor the locations of Mercury and Venus in the sky and for the retrograde motion of Mars and the outer\nplanets convinced Brahe that the planets must orbit the sun as in Copernicus\u2019 model. However, he was\nconvinced that the earth did not orbit the sun, in part because he was never able to measure parallax,\nan unavoidable prediction of a moving earth. As accurate as his measurements were, the distances to\nthe nearest stars required more than 200 years of technological advances before parallax was observed.\nIn Brahe\u2019s model, the sun, with its orbiting planets, orbited the earth. It was a geocentric model.\nTycho Brahe\n(1546-1601 * Denmark)\nAccumulated decades of very accurate\n\u2022\ndata on the locations of celestial objects\nDeveloped geocentric model based on\n\u2022\nobservational evidence that the earth did\nnot move\nHired Kepler in 1600 to mathematically\n\u2022\nanalyze his data with the aim of proving\nhis model correct\nFigure 2 Tycho Brahe\n31\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Scientific Revolution\nBrahe planned to use his extensive data on the locations of the planets to demonstrate the correctness of\nhis model. The idea was to use the model to calculate the position in the sky of a planet at some point in\nthe past. He would then go back to his data to show that the calculation produced the actual observed\nlocation. If it could consistently do this, as Ptolemy\u2019s and Copernicus\u2019 could not, then his model would\nbe shown to be correct. However, these calculations were extremely difficult. Brahe could not do them\nhimself, so, in 1600 he hired the German mathematician, Johannes Kepler to do them for him.\n3.3 Johannes Kepler\nAlthough he was hired to make the calculations necessary to demonstrate the correctness of Brahe\u2019s\ngeocentric model, Johannes Kepler had for some time been a convinced Copernican. Not that he believed\nthat Copernicus\u2019 model was correct in all its details; he knew that its slight inaccuracies meant that it\nwas wrong. But the aesthetic superiority of a heliocentric view was compelling to him.\nBrahe died shortly after Kepler was hired. Kepler succeeded him as imperial mathematician and astrologer\nto the Holy Roman Emperor, with the responsibility of completing Brahe\u2019s unfinished work. Kepler now\nhad access to Brahe\u2019s decades of unprecedentedly accurate astronomical observations.\nAAAAAAAAAAAAmmmmmmmmmmmmeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiccccccccccccaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnn

the Universe The Scientific Revolution\nKepler had entered Brahe\u2019s employment with a specific heliocentric model of his own. Now he had the\nopportunity to check his model against the data, and soon found that his model was wrong. He did not\ngive up, however. For four years he repeatedly devised new models, checked them against the data, and\nfound out that they were wrong. In these attempts he focused on the planet Mars. He reasoned that the\nCreator would not have created a different orbit for each planet; that would be unaesthetic, something\nincompatible with his concept of God. If he could figure out the orbit of Mars, he was sure it would be\nthe orbit of all the other planets as well.\nAfter years of unsuccessful attempts using various combinations of circles, he finally gave up on that\napproach. Finally, in 1605 he hit upon the correct combination of path and speed that would match the\ncalculations to Brahe\u2019s observations. Mars moves in an elliptical path with varying speeds depending of\nthe distance between it and the sun. Mars speeds up as it approaches the sun and slows as it recedes. It\ndoes this in such a way that an imaginary line drawn between Mars and the sun sweeps out equal areas\nin equal time intervals. As he had suspected, this orbit worked for the other planets as well. Although\nthe manuscript presenting this information was completed in 1605, it was not published until 1609 due\nto legal disputes over the use of Tycho\u2019s observations, the property of his heirs.\nThis correct orbit was arrived at strictly by trial and error. Kepler had no model in mind that allowed\nhim to predict it and no clear explanation for why the planets moved in this way. The explanation would\nhave to wait more than 50 years for Isaac Newton to figure it out. However, the accuracy with which the\nmodel was able to predict the past locations of the planets in the sky, as verified by Brahe\u2019s observations,\nleft little doubt that the orbit was correct.\nJohannes Kepler\n(1571-1630 * Germany)\n\u2022 Believed for aesthetic reasons in\nheliocentric model\n\u2022 Determined laws of planetary motion\nby trial and error, checking\ncalculations against Brahe\u2019s data\n\u2022 Like Copernicus, believed in the\nphysical reality of the model\nFigure 3: Johannes Kepler\n33\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Scientific Revolution\n3.4 Galileo Galilei\nGalileo Galilei was a contemporary of Kepler, and, like Kepler was a convinced Copernican long before\nthere was anything other than aesthetic reasons for supporting the heliocentric model. Other than that,\nthe two men had little in common. Kepler was very mild mannered, somewhat sickly, and modest.\nGalileo was the opposite. Kepler was a Protestant and Galileo a Catholic, both strong in their faith.\nGalileo dismissed much of Kepler\u2019s work as useless fiction and refused to accept elliptical orbits for the\nplanets, continuing to believe they had to be circular in some way.\nGalileo is significant in science for two distinct reasons. First of all, he was the first, in 1609, to use a\ntelescope to study the heavens and in this way made several important discoveries that undermined the\nPtolemaic model accepted by most scholars and the Christian churches, both Catholic and Protestant.\nHowever, these discoveries did not prove that the earth itself orbited the sun, as Galileo liked to claim.\nSecondly, he is generally credited with inventing the scientific method as we understand it today, or at\nthe very least, with being the first to apply it systematically.\nAlthough Galileo did not invent the telescope, he was the first to use it to gain knowledge of the heavens.\nAmong his discoveries were the mountains and craters on the moon. Because the moon was part of\nthe celestial realm, Aristotle and religious dogma required it to be perfect. Well, almost perfect. It was\nclearly blemished, perhaps signifying that as the closest celestial object to the earth, it was a transitional\nobject between the imperfect earth and the absolutely perfect heavens beyond. In any case, the scholars\nand churches taught that the moon is a perfectly smooth and spherical object. If you already believe this\nand look at the moon with the naked eye, it is easy to believe this is true.\nEven through Galileo\u2019s relatively low power telescope, it clearly is not true. Galileo had trouble convincing\nothers of this. They either refused to look through the telescope or claimed that the irregularities were an\nartifact of the telescope itself rather than a true image of the moon. The resemblance of the moon\u2019s features\nto those on the earth misled Galileo somewhat. He thought that the dark relatively smooth surfaces on\nthe moon were oceans and named them seas. Today we call them maria, the Latin word for seas.\nGalileo discovered that the planet Venus went through phases just as the moon does. This was important\nbecause it proved that Venus orbited the sun rather than the earth, thus proving the Ptolemaic model\nwrong. He was also able to demonstrate what some others had suspected, that the Milky Way, the band\nof diffuse light that arcs across the sky from horizon to horizon, is actually composed of hundreds of\nthousands of stars. He observed sunspots and used them to calculate the speed of rotation of the sun,\nabout one revolution every 25 days.\n34\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Scientific Revolution\nPerhaps his most important discovery was the four (now called Galilean) moons of Jupiter. One of the\nstrongest arguments in favor of the geocentric model was the fact that our moon orbits the earth. No\none disputed this. The argument went that the earth could not possibly move because if it did, it would\nleave the moon behind. In the days before the discovery of gravity, this was a very powerful argument.\nHowever, whether one believed in a geocentric or a heliocentric universe, it was clear that Jupiter moved;\nit had to orbit something whether the earth or the sun. The fact that Jupiter was somehow able to move\nwithout leaving its moons behind destroyed the argument.\nGalileo Galilei\n(1564-1642 * Italy)\nFirst to use telescope to study heavens\n\u2022 Mountains and craters on the moon\n\u2022 Rotation of the sun\n\u2022 Phases of Venus\n\u2022 Moons of Jupiter\n\u2022 Stars in the Milky Way\nRevealed heavens in their gross\nmateriality\n1633 -condemned by Inquisition\nDeveloped the Scientific Method\nFigure 4: Galileo Galilei\nAs most everyone knows, Galileo got into serious trouble with the Church later in his life. He was called\nbefore the Inquisition in 1633. The root of his problem with the Church began in 1616. By then the\nCatholic Church, with the Counter Reformation well underway, had joined the Protestant churches in\nopposing the Copernican model. Galileo went to Rome to try to persuade the Church authorities not\nto ban Copernicus\u2019 ideas. They did not. However, Cardinal Bellarmine ordered Galileo not to \u201chold or\ndefend\u201d the idea that the earth moves and the sun stands still at the centre. The decree, however, did not\nprevent Galileo from discussing the heliocentric hypothesis as a hypothesis rather than a fact. In 1623\nCardinal Maffeo Barberini, a friend and admirer of Galileo, was elected Pope Urban VIII. Galileo felt\nit was now safe to take a stronger position with respect to the heliocentric model. His book, Dialogue\nConcerning the Two Chief World Systems, was published in 1632.\n35\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Scientific Revolution\nBefore publishing, Galileo personally discussed the book with Urban. The Pope asked that Galileo give\narguments both for and against both the heliocentric and the geocentric models and offered some of\nhis own in favor of the geocentric over the heliocentric model. In the Dialogue, the arguments for the\ngeocentric model and against the heliocentric model were made by Simplicio, which in Italian has the\nconnotation of simpleton, and, in fact, Simplicio frequently came across as a fool. The book was clearly\nnot a balanced discussion of the two models but rather a polemic for the heliocentric model, something\nGalileo, in 1616, had been forbidden to do. To make matters worse, Galileo put the exact words of Urban\ninto the mouth of Simplicio. The Pope was not amused. Galileo was called to Rome to face the Inquisition.\nHe was threatened with torture if he did not publicly recant, which he did. He avoided torture, but was\nfound \u201cvehemently suspect of heresy\u201d and sentenced to house arrest, where he remained for the rest of\nhis life. In spite of his troubles with the Church, he remained a devout Catholic throughout his life. His\njustification for proposing theories contrary to the Bible is summarized in his statement \u201cThe Bible tells\nyou how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go.\u201d\n36\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Scientific Revolution\nHis trial before the Inquisition ended Galileo\u2019s work as an astronomer. Fortunately for science, it did not\nend his work as a physicist. During his almost decade of house arrest, Galileo made original contributions\nto the science of motion through an innovative combination of experiment and mathematics. Galileo is\nperhaps the first to clearly state that the laws of nature are mathematical. His studies of motion laid the\ngroundwork for Isaac Newton\u2019s formulation of his three laws of motion. The first of these laws, logically\njust a special case of the second, is simply a restatement of work done by Galileo, and was included\nspecifically to recognize Galileo\u2019s contribution. Galileo\u2019s empirical approach in his studies of motion is\nwhat we now know as the scientific method.\nThe Scientific Revolution is not yet complete. Kepler has shown the heliocentric model to be correct\nby determining the orbits of the planets around sun, but he has no explanation for why they move in\nthose particular orbits. Galileo has made important discoveries in mechanics, completely destroying\nAristotle\u2019s theory of motion, but was not able to replace it with a similarly comprehensive theory. The\nunfinished work of Kepler and Galileo will have to wait another 25 years for the genius of Isaac Newton\nto complete their work.\n3.5 Isaac Newton\nIt is no exaggeration to say that Isaac Newton is the single most important contributor to the development\nof modern science. The Latin inscription on Newton\u2019s tomb, despite its bombastic language, is thus\njustified in proclaiming, \u201cMortals! Rejoice at so great an ornament to the human race!\u201d It is perhaps a\nslight exaggeration to say, as Alexander Pope did as an epitaph for Newton:\n\u201cNature and Nature\u2019s laws lay hid in night; God said, Let Newton be! and all was light.\u201d\nNewton entered Trinity College of Cambridge University in 1661. The Cambridge curriculum at that\ntime was still strongly classical, but Newton preferred to read the more advanced ideas of modern\nphilosophers such as Descartes and astronomers such as Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler. In private\nstudies he had begun to master the field of mathematics as shown by notebooks he kept at the time. No\none at Cambridge apparently recognized his genius. Newton obtained his degree from Cambridge in\nAugust 1665 without honors or distinction.\nThe university temporarily closed for the next two years as a precaution against the Great Plague, and\nNewton returned to his mother\u2019s farm. During these two years (his 23rd and 24th) Newton filled notebook\nafter notebook with ideas and experimental observations. These may be the two most productive years\nin the entire history of science.\n37\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Scientific Revolution\nIn that relatively short period of time, Newton made brilliant and important discoveries regarding light\nand color. He continued his studies of mathematics and invented the calculus, which he then used to\ndescribe the motion of objects. Finally, and perhaps most significant of all, he developed a mathematical\nequation describing gravity. Thus Newton not only knew how the planets moved, he knew why they\nmoved that way. What Kepler had laboriously determined through trial and error, Newton using his\nlaws of motion and the law of gravity could calculate on the back of an envelope.\nAlthough Galileo never dropped two balls from the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the story that Newton arrived\nat his theory of gravity after watching an apple fall from a tree in his mother\u2019s orchard appears to be\ntrue. At least, Newton said it was.\nNewton returned to Cambridge in 1667, and was elected a minor fellow at Trinity. Finally, his talents\nwere beginning to be recognized. The next year he became a senior fellow upon taking his master of\narts degree, and in 1669, before he had reached his 27th birthday, he became Lucasian Professor of\nMathematics. The duties of this appointment offered Newton the opportunity to organize the results of\nhis earlier optical researches, and in 1672 he published his work on light and color. This work established\nhis reputation as a scientist of the first magnitude.\nNewton was, however, a highly secretive and suspicious person who found it extremely difficult to submit\nhis ideas to the scrutiny of others. Many of the great discoveries made during the two years on the farm\nremained unpublished for decades. It was not until 1684 that Edmond Halley finally persuaded Newton\nto make his work on motion and gravity known.\nHalley was intensely interested in planetary orbits, and also those of comets. He and fellow scientist\nRobert Hooke suspected that an inverse-square relationship produced the orbits, but were not able to\ndeduce from this hypothesis a theoretical orbit that would match the observed planetary motions. Halley\ntraveled to Cambridge to seek the advice of Newton. What would be the orbit of a body subjected to\nsuch a force? Newton told him he had already solved the problem \u2013 the orbit would be an ellipse \u2013 but\nthat he had mislaid his calculations to prove it.\nShortly afterwards Newton sent Halley a copy of his demonstration. Realizing the significance of what\nNewton had done, Halley, utilizing great skill and tact, persuaded the reluctant Newton to develop\nand publish his ideas on celestial mechanics. Newton\u2019s Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\n(commonly known as the Principia from its Latin title), containing Newton\u2019s three laws of motion and\nhis law of gravity, was published in 1687. Halley read the manuscript, corrected the proofs, and paid the\npublication costs out of his own pocket.\n38\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Scientific Revolution\nIsaac Newton\n(1642 - 1727 * England)\n\u2022 Copernican system destroyed\nAristotle\u2019s explanation of motion\nand offered nothing to take its\nplace.\n\u2022 1687 -Principia.

The\nrelationship between applied force and subsequent motion was now firmly established. The single\ncosmological force, gravity, had been completely described. Objects moved in accordance with strict\nnatural laws that could be understood mathematically. Some continental scientists and philosophers\nwere at first skeptical. They felt that Newton\u2019s concept of gravity as a force acting through a distance\nwas insufficiently mechanical to be correct. Newton was also bothered by this. In a letter to a fellow\nscientist, he said,\n\u201cThat gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential to matter, so that one body may act on\nanother body at a distance through a vacuum,\u2026is to me so great an absurdity that I believe\nno man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it.\u201d\nHowever the spectacular success of Newton\u2019s mathematical description of the motion of both earthly and\nheavenly objects soon overcame the philosophical objections and Newton was celebrated as the greatest\nscientist who had ever lived. We will return to the problem of action-at-a-distance in a later chapter.\nNewton\u2019s universal law of gravitation\n\u2022Objects with mass exert a force on one another that is\nproportional to the product of their masses and inversely\nproportional to the square of the distance between their centers.\n\u2022Predicted the existence of Neptune.\nFigure 6: The law of gravity\n40\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Scientific Revolution\nAs with many geniuses, Newton was a complex, and in many ways, highly neurotic individual. He was\nparanoid regarding his discoveries and often delayed publication for fear that someone would steal his\nideas. He was constantly embroiled in extensive and bitter disputes with other scientists. One of the most\ninfamous of these was with the philosopher and scientist Gottfried Leibniz over who should receive\ncredit for the invention of the calculus. Although many of the great scientists have appreciated, and in\nsome cases even contributed to, the arts, Newton was not one of them. He was not the least interested\nin music, characterized great works of sculpture as \u201cstone dolls,\u201d and described poetry as \u201ca kind of\ningenious nonsense.\u201d\nNewton was an unorthodox Christian, a monotheist who rejected the divinity of Jesus. For this reason,\nhe constantly delayed his ordination as an Anglican minister, as was required by the various academic\nand official positions he held over his lifetime. Though heretical in his views, Newton was none the less\nhighly religious. He wrote a number of tracts dealing with the literal interpretation of the Bible. Newton\nwas a strong believer in prophetic interpretation of the Bible. He was also an astrologer and alchemist at\na time when most scientists had long ago abandoned these ideas. During his lifetime he actually wrote\nmore about the Bible and occult studies than science and mathematics.\nAfter his death, Newton\u2019s body was discovered to contain massive amounts of mercury, probably resulting\nfrom his alchemical pursuits. Mercury poisoning could explain some of Newton\u2019s eccentricities. He was\nburied in Westminster Abby with the greatest of honors.\nNewton viewed the material universe as consisting of atoms whose motion is determined by precise\nmathematical laws. Newton and virtually all of his contemporaries took the existence of a Creator as\nan obvious fact. However, this mechanical universe brought into question the role of the Creator with\nrespect to the universe. Does the Creator interfere with the mechanical cause and effect from time to\ntime? Or, did the Creator create the universe and the laws governing it and then allow the universe to\nevolve in accordance with those laws?\nNewton believed the former. He felt that divine intervention was necessary for the creation of the solar\nsystem and was also necessary to keep it operating smoothly. Most of the scientists and philosophers\nthat succeeded Newton rejected his theistic arguments. Newton\u2019s rival Leibniz, for example, thought that\nGod created the universal machine, set it in motion, and then had no need to intervene further in its\noperation. The universe unfolded according to mathematical laws with all the precision and inevitability\nof a well-made clock. This religious perspective is known as Deism.\n41\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Scientific Revolution\nLater, the French physicist and mathematician, Pierre Simon Laplace, developed this idea further. In a\nfamous quote, he said:\nWe may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its past and the cause of its\nfuture. An intellect which at a certain moment would know all forces that set nature in motion,\nand all positions of all items of which nature is composed, if this intellect were also vast enough\nto submit these data to analysis, it would embrace in a single formula the movements of the\ngreatest bodies of the universe and those of the tiniest atom; for such an intellect nothing would\nbe uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.\nLaplace\u2019s perspective is known as the mechanistic-deterministic worldview.\n3.6 The Enlightenment\nRichard Tarnas in his book The Passion of the Western Mind, summarizes the change in worldview\nresulting from the Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution in the following way:\n\u201cAnd so between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries, the West saw the emergence of a\nnewly self-conscious and autonomous human being \u2013 curious about the world, confident in\nhis own judgments, skeptical of orthodoxies, rebellious against authority, responsible for his\nown beliefs and actions, enamored of the classical past but even more committed to a greater\nfuture, proud of his humanity, conscious of his distinctness from nature, aware of his artistic\npowers as individual creator, assured of his intellectual capacity to comprehend and control\nnature, and altogether less dependent on an omnipotent God.\u201d\nThese changes were the foundation for the transition from the medieval worldview to the modern\nworldview, a worldview fully articulated during the Enlightenment.\nThe Enlightenment refers to a particular historic period that occurred primarily in Western Europe\nand the United States in roughly the 18th and 19th centuries. It is the time when the accomplishments of\nthe Scientific Revolution were incorporated into a new worldview now called the modern worldview.\nEnlightenment also refers to the ideal of putting the whole of human life under the rule of reason. What is\naccepted as truth to be believed or as a principle to be put into practice should not be based on authority,\nbut on reasons that are judged to be sufficient in and of themselves. The Enlightenment was also a time\nof increased awareness of human rights, a time when more liberal political systems were established. The\nfounding fathers of the American Revolution were acting in the spirit of the Enlightenment.\n42\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Charles Darwin and Evolution\n4 Charles Darwin and Evolution\nYour goals for this chapter are to know the following:\n\u2022 Briefly discuss Darwin\u2019s theory of the origin of the species? What mechanism did Darwin\npropose to explain evolution? How does this mechanism work?\n\u2022 What role did the voyage of the Beagle, and the Galapagos Islands in particular, play in the\ndevelopment of Darwin\u2019s theory?\nThe period of history known as the Scientific Revolution essentially ended with Isaac Newton and the\npublication of the Principia. But this was just a revolution in the physical sciences. The revolution in\nthe biological sciences did not occur until 1859 with the publication of Charles Darwin\u2019s Origin of the\nSpecies, which proposed decent from a common ancestor as the way in which species originate and\nnatural selection as the mechanism by which this occurs.\n4.1 The Theory of Evolution\nDarwin was not the first to suggest that species evolve. The idea is an ancient one going back at least to\nthe presocratics. Anaximander, is frequently cited as a proto-evolutionist because he felt life arose from\nmoisture and progressed over time from a fish-like ancestor to modern humans.\nJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJoooooooooooooooiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnn ttttttttttttttthhhhhhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeeeeeee bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssssssssttttttttttttttt

He was\none of the leading intellectuals of 18th century England, a man with a remarkable array of interests and\npursuits. Erasmus Darwin was a respected physician, a well known poet, philosopher, botanist, and\nnaturalist. As a naturalist, he formulated one of the first formal theories on evolution in 1795. Although\nhe did not come up with natural selection, he did discuss ideas that his grandson elaborated on sixty\nyears later, such as how life evolved from a single common ancestor. He also discussed how competition\nand sexual selection could cause changes in species.\nErasmus Darwin also presented his evolutionary ideas in verse, in particular in the posthumously\npublished poem The Temple of Nature.\nOrganic life beneath the shoreless waves\nWas born and nurs\u2019d in ocean\u2019s pearly caves;\nFirst forms minute, unseen by spheric glass,\nMove on the mud, or pierce the watery mass;\nThese, as successive generations bloom,\nNew powers acquire and larger limbs assume;\nWhence countless groups of vegetation spring,\nAnd breathing realms of fin and feet and wing.\nErasmus Darwin. The Temple of Nature. 1802.\nPerhaps the best known pre-darwinian theory of evolution is that of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck who was the\nfirst to develop a truly coherent evolutionary theory. He published his ideas in the early 1800s. Lamarck\nbelieved that the environment gives rise to changes in animals and that under certain conditions, these\nchanges could be passed on to offspring. This idea is generally referred to as \u2018the inheritance of acquired\ncharacteristics.\u2019 In Lamarck\u2019s view, as the lower branches of trees became depleted of leaves, the leaf\neating ancestors of giraffes would have to stretch their necks to reach leaves higher in the trees. This\nwould strengthen and gradually lengthen their necks. These giraffes would then have offspring with\nslightly longer necks.\nDarwin was aware of these evolutionary ideas. He read his grandfather\u2019s books and admired them, not\nso much for the content as for the fact that they were notorious. He was also familiar with Lamarck.\nAt Edinburgh, one of his teachers, Robert Grant, befriended Darwin, possibly because, as an ardent\nevolutionist, he was an admirer of Erasmus Darwin. One day while they were walking, Grant spoke with\nenthusiasm of Lamarck\u2019s theory. Later Darwin recalled, \u201cI listened in silent astonishment, and as far as\nI can judge, without any effect on my mind.\u201d\n44\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Charles Darwin and Evolution\nCharles Darwin\n(1809 - 1882 * England)\n1831 -1836 Darwin served as\nnaturalist aboard the H.M.S.\nBeagle.\n1859 Published The Origin of the\nSpecies\n\u201cI have called this principle, by\nwhich each slight variation, if\nuseful, is preserved, by the term\nNatural Selection.\u201d From Origin\nof the Species.\nFigure 1 Charles Darwin\nIn 1831, Charles Darwin, an excited 22-year old adventurer, climbed aboard the H.M.S. Beagle for a 5-year\nvoyage. He left with rather conventional views on the origins of species, not having been convinced by\neither his grandfather\u2019s books or his knowledge of Larmarckism. Little did he realize that this voyage\nwould set him upon a collision course with the prevailing view of human nature.\nDarwin served as naturalist on the Beagle and as companion to the captain, Robert Fitzroy. The Beagle\u2019s\nobjective was to chart the coastline of South America. As the ship circled the continent, Darwin\u2019s curiosity\nwas piqued by the changes he noted in the flora and fauna. He became particularly fascinated by the\nvariety of animal species on the Galapagos Islands, an isolated chain off the coast of Ecuador. The islands\ncontained many unique species, but species that resembled those on the nearby mainland.\nThese observations caused Darwin to question the prevailing belief that all species were created distinct\nand immutable in a single creation event. Would all of these similar, but distinct, species have been\ndesigned at one time only to be selectively deposited on these tiny, remote islands? Darwin did not think so.\n45\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Charles Darwin and Evolution\nThe outline for an alternative scenario came to him. Darwin recognized the Galapagos as newly formed\nvolcanic islands, and concluded that as plants and animals from the nearest landmass colonized a\nparticular island, they became isolated from their parent population and evolved to fit the island\u2019s\nenvironmental niches. The differences in environment from island to island resulted in similar, but\ndistinct, species. The variety of finch species is perhaps the most striking example. Maybe, over the\ngenerations, life forms adapted their structure and functions to the survival demands of their particular\nenvironments. Darwin was not sure how this process of adaption took place, but he returned from his\narduous voyage convinced that it did.\nDarwin\u2019s Finches\nFrom the Galapagos Islands\nFigure 2 Darwin\u2019s Finches\nDarwin\u2019s thinking on the process of adaption was clarified by reading Thomas Malthus\u2019 theory that\nthe expanding world population would eventually exceed its food supply. Darwin saw that a similar\nproliferation of thriving organisms in the natural realm might provide the mechanism for evolution. As\norganisms thrive and multiply within a given environment, they eventually outstrip the ability of the\nenvirons to meet their needs. At this point, competition begins. Those individuals particularly suited\nto the habitat survive and have offspring who share and pass on the successful traits of their parents.\nLess successful individuals die off without reproducing. Thus, by this process of natural selection, they\nbecome adapted to their environment. They change as a species in the direction most suited for survival\nand reproduction.\n46\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Charles Darwin and Evolution\nDarwin\u2019s convictions along these lines were bolstered by one of his hobbies. He raised pigeons and had\nseen the effects of breeding based on selected attributes. Why couldn\u2019t a natural environment operate\nlike a breeder, allowing the survival and proliferation of organisms with \u201cdesirable\u201d traits?\nTo return to the example of giraffes, as with any characteristic of a species, there would be variations in\nneck length within the population of the leaf eating ancestors of giraffes. As the lower branches of trees\nbecame depleted of leaves, natural selection would favor those with the longest necks. In contrast to\nLamarck, it is not the acquired characteristics, but the innate ones that result in evolution.\nDarwin resisted publication of his theory of evolution for 20 years. Finally, in 1859, fearful of losing his\nclaim to the discovery, Darwin published. His fear was caused by a letter he received in June of 1858,\nfrom an acquaintance, Alfred Wallace, a fellow naturalist. Like others he had received from Wallace, it\ncame from the Malay Archipelago. This envelop was bulkier than others, containing a manuscript as\nwell as a letter. The cover letter said, \u201cHere is a hypothesis I\u2019ve hit upon to explain the origin of species.\u201d\nWallace had independently come up with the concept of evolution by natural selection. (Although Darwin\nconsidered the ideas in Wallace\u2019s paper to be essentially the same as his own, there was an important\ndifference that in his panic Darwin failed to notice. Darwin saw natural selection in terms of competition\nbetween individuals of the same species, whereas Wallace saw natural selection in terms of species in\ncompetition with one another.)\n47\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Charles Darwin and Evolution\nThe letter from Wallace requested that Darwin forward the manuscript to Charles Lyell, the renowned\ngeologist. Darwin dutifully did so, but with a heavy heart, assuming that he had lost his chance to claim\ndiscovery. Lyell advised him to calm down. Maybe something could be salvaged.\nAlthough Darwin had never published his theory, he had sent summaries of his ideas to several other\nnaturalist he knew to be supportive. Among them were Lyell, and Joseph Hooker, a botanist. Lyell and\nHooker, were sympathetic to Darwin\u2019s predicament, and devised an arrangement that would recognize\nWallace\u2019s contribution, but would give, justly, Darwin priority for the discovery. They arranged and\nsponsored a joint presentation of Wallace\u2019s manuscript and Darwin\u2019s unpublished work at the next\nmeeting of the Linnean Society, one of London\u2019s better scientific associations. The arrangement was\nmade without Wallace\u2019s permission or even knowledge.\nDarwin reluctantly consented, worrying whether it was an honorable thing to do. He sent Hooker his\n1844 essay and the six-paragraph summary he\u2019d sent the previous year to the American botanist Asa\nGray. The few weeks it took for all this to transpire, were an incredibly difficult time for Darwin. He felt\ntrapped between the demands of honor on behalf of Wallace and his own self-interest. Worse of all, this\nwas taking place while his youngest child, Charles, lay dying of scarlet fever\nOn the evening of July 1, 1858, the Darwin-Wallace material was read to an audience of about 30 people.\nNeither author was in attendance. Wallace was in New Guinea, unaware of the event in London. Darwin\nwas at home with his wife mourning the death of their 19-month-old son just three days earlier.\nDarwin published The Origin of Species in 1859. In this book, through copious examples, he established the\nstrong inference that species evolve one from another. He also outlined the concept of natural selection,\nthe mechanism by which he thought evolution occurred. Dealing only with plants and nonhuman\nanimals, Darwin did not directly address the question of human origins. In fact, the book\u2019s only mention\nof human evolution was the prediction that \u201clight will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.\u201d\nHowever, the implications of the theory for human origins were clear. Darwin met with the feared\nreactions. When she heard of Darwin\u2019s work in 1860, the wife of the Bishop of Dorcester expressed her\nshock this way: \u201cDescended from apes! Let us hope it is not true, but if it is, let us pray that it will not\nbecome generally known.\u201d\nDarwin died on 19 April 1882. By the time of his death, he was one of the most respected scientists\nin the world, so much so that it was decided that, although he was a well-known agnostic, he should\nbe buried in Westminster Abbey, along with Isaac Newton and other great British scientists. He was\nburied to music commissioned specifically for the funeral. The anthem\u2019s composer drew from the Book\nof Proverbs to write \u2018Happy is the man that findith wisdom and getteth understanding.\u2019\n48\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Charles Darwin and Evolution\nRidiculing Evolution Through Cartoons\nIn the late 19th century\nanti-evolution cartoons\nwere common. Darwin\nbegan growing a beard in\n1862, and when he\nreappeared in public in\n1866 with a bushy beard,\nmany of the caricatures\ncentered on Darwin and\nhis new look.\nFigure 3 Darwin cartoon\nNatural selection has sometimes been referred to as \u2018survival of the fittest.\u2019 This can be a little misleading\nif fittest is thought of as strongest. Actually, fittest refers to the ability to reproduce. Thus a part of\nnatural selection is what Darwin called sexual selection. Many traits that are sexually selected for can\nactually hinder survival of the organism, but this can be compensated for if they increase reproductive\nopportunities. Consider the classic example of the peacock\u2019s tail. It is metabolically costly, cumbersome,\nand essentially a \u2018predator magnet.\u2019 Reproductively, this is more than compensated for by the ability of\nthe tail to attract mates.\n4.2 Fossils\nSteven Stanley, an American paleontologist and evolutionary biologist, has pointed out that \u201cit is doubtful\nwhether, in the absence of fossils, the idea of evolution would represent anything more than an outrageous\nhypothesis.\u201d Yet we do have fossils and our ability to date them and their surrounding geological layers\nhas become more and more precise. Though the mechanisms for evolutionary change are still debated,\nsuch gradual changes themselves are extremely well documented by the fossil record.\n49\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Charles Darwin and Evolution\nThe word \u2018fossil\u2019 comes from the Latin word meaning \u2018having been dug up.\u2019 They are the remains of all or\nparts of animals and plants from the remote past. Fossils are formed in a number of different ways, but\nmost are formed when a plant or animal dies in a watery environment and is buried in mud and silt. Soft\ntissues quickly decompose leaving the hard bones or shells behind. Over time sediment builds over the\ntop and hardens into rock. As the encased bones decay, minerals seep in replacing the organic material\ncell by cell in a process called \u2018petrification.\u2019 Alternatively the bones may completely decay leaving a cast\nof the organism. The void left behind may then fill with minerals making a stone replica of the organism.\nA fossil normally preserves only a portion of the deceased organism, such as bones, teeth, or exoskeletons.\nPreservation of soft tissue is rare. Fossils may also consist of the marks left behind by the organism while\nit was alive, such as footprints. Some fossils are very striking and have been collected at least as far back\nas recorded history.\nBy the 19th century, it was recognized that certain types of fossils were associated with certain geological\nstrata. Thus rocks from distant locations could be correlated based on the fossils they contained.\nNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeddddddddddddddddd hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelllllllllllllllllppppppppppppppppp wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittttttttttttttttthhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyooooooooooooooooouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr\ndddddddddddddddddiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiisssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrtttttttttttttttttaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaatttttttttttttttttiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn?????????????????\nGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeettttttttttttttttt iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn-----------------dddddddddddddddddeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeepppppppppppppppppttttttttttttttttthhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh fffffffffffffffffeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeedddddddddddddddddbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaccccccccccccccccckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadddddddddddddddddvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvviiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiccccccccccccccccceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee fffffffffffffffffrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrooooooooooooooooommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeexxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxpppppppppppppppppeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrtttttttttttttttttsssssssssssssssss iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyooooooooooooooooouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr\ntttttttttttttttttooooooooooooooooopppppppppppppppppiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiccccccccccccccccc aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.................

Many of these explanations relied on folktales or mythologies. In\nChina the fossil bones of ancient mammals including Homo erectus were often mistaken for \u201cdragon\nbones\u201d and used as medicine and aphrodisiacs. In the West the presence of fossilized sea creatures high\nup on mountainsides was seen as proof of the biblical deluge.\nAristotle realized that fossil seashells from rocks were similar to those found on the beach, indicating\nthe fossils were once living animals. Leonardo Da Vinci also recognized them as once living animals and\ncommented on their interpretation, including an argument that they could not have resulted from the\nbiblical flood. At the time Darwin wrote The Origin of Species, the fossil record was sparse, and Darwin\npretty much discounted its significance as evidence of biological evolution. In The Origin of Species,\nDarwin constantly refers to the geological record as \u2018imperfect.\u2019 However, that is no longer the case.\nToward the end of the 19th century, and especially in the 20th century there was an almost exponential\nincrease in the fossil record. Also, we now have the ability to accurately date most fossils. The fossil\nrecord now constitutes strong evidence in favor of biological evolution.\nOne of the most important features of a good scientific theory is its ability to make testable predictions.\nThe fossil record allows this. One example involves marsupials. Today most marsupials are found in\nAustralia. But 40 million years ago, early marsupials were located in the southern part of South America.\nThe earliest marsupials found in Australia date from about 30 million years ago. How could they have\ngotten from South America to Australia?\nForty million years ago, South America and Australia were connected by what is now Antarctica in\nthe southern supercontinent, Gondwana. Since marsupials had to go overland from South America to\nAustralia, they must have passed through Antarctica. Thus it was predicted that there would be fossil\nmarsupials in Antarctica. The prediction was later confirmed by the discovery there of more than a dozen\nmarsupial fossil species dating between 35 and 40 million years ago.\nThere have been many similar predictions based on the theory of evolution. All have turned out to be\ncorrect. The evidence for evolution is overwhelming. It is often claimed that the theory of evolution is\nnot scientific because it cannot be falsified. This is not true. The genuine falsification of any prediction\nbased on the theory would falsify the theory. For example the prediction that the morphological changes\nthat lead from the most primitive species of a particular type of organism to the present must occur in\nchronological order. A true counterexample would falsify the theory.\nThe claim that evolution cannot be falsified is usually based on the fact that evolutionary theory cannot\npredict the future evolution of a species. The factors causing evolution are extremely complex and are\nnot completely understood. This precludes the ability to test the theory by observing its results, and\ntherefore evolution cannot be falsified in this particular way.\n51\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Charles Darwin and Evolution\nAnother common claim is that we have never directly observed speciation. For the most part this is true,\nbecause speciation generally involves time spans greater than human history. However, it is, in fact, not\ntrue. Bacteria can reproduce in as little as twenty minutes. In laboratory experiments lasting decades\nand extending over tens of thousands of generations, the origin of new species by natural selection from\na common ancestor has been observed.\nIt is unfortunate that the word \u2018theory\u2019 has two very distinct meanings. An example of the first is the\nheliocentric theory of the solar system or the theory of relativity. In this sense, theory refers to a well\nestablished, coherent explanation of a vast body of data. In the second meaning, theory is just another\nword for hypothesis or guess. With the tremendous increase in the fossil record, the ability to accurately\ndate fossils, and, perhaps most importantly, genetic evidence, biological evolution is now a theory in\nthe first sense of the word.\n4.3 Punctuated Equilibrium\nWhen Darwin proposed his theory on the origin of species, he believed that evolution took place as a\nresult of the accumulation of small variations over long periods of time \u2013 that species arise gradually. He\ndid not assume that the pace of change was constant, but did believe that it was slow and continuous.\nThis view of evolution is called gradualism. However, if evolution is gradual, there should be a fossil\nrecord of small, incremental changes along the way. But the fossil record at the time showed no indication\nof this. Darwin was concerned, but assumed that the absence of intermediate forms was due to the\nincompleteness of the fossil record. He assumed that as the fossil record became more complete, the\ntransitional forms would be there.\nWith a few well established exceptions, this has not turned out to be the case. The fossil record clearly\nshows that most species are stable, remaining essentially unchanged over millions of years. In 1972, Steven\nJay Gould and Niles Eldredge proposed an alternative theory to explain this. Species are in generally\nstable, but the stability can be \u2018punctuated\u2019 by a relatively rapid burst of change that results in a new\nspecies and that leaves few transitional fossils behind. This concept is known as punctuated equilibrium.\n52\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Charles Darwin and Evolution\nGradualism vs Punctuated Equilibrium\nGradualism -evolution takes place\nas a result of the accumulation of\nsmall variations over long periods\nof time.\nPunctuated equilibrium\n\u2013\nevolution occurs relative rapidly\ndue to genetic isolation which\nexplains the rarity of transitional\nspecies.\nFigure 4 Punctuated

free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Charles Darwin and Evolution\nAs opposed to gradualism, changes leading to a new species don\u2019t occur in the mainstream population\nwhere interbreeding would tend to blend them out. Rather speciation tends to occur when a small group\nbecomes physically and genetically isolated from the mainstream population. In the small group, any\nchanges that would create a survival advantage in the new environment would not be blended out by\ninterbreeding with the mainstream population. Thus, in a relatively short time, maybe only thousands of\nyears, a new species will evolve. The relative importance of punctuated and gradual patterns of evolution\nhas not yet been determined. Research to address this question is ongoing.\n4.4 The Modern Synthesis\nIn addition to punctuated equilibrium, Darwin\u2019s original ideas on evolution have been modified in\nanother way. The Austrian biologist and monk Gregor Mendel was a contemporary of Darwin. Mendel\u2019s\nmeticulous experiments cross-breeding pea plants indicated a previously unknown mechanism for\nheredity. Mendel\u2019s paper, Experiments on Plant Hybridization, published in 1865, was criticized, but mostly\nignored. Darwin was unaware of it. Darwin struggled with the problem of how traits were inherited and\nwas never able to come up with a mechanism whereby organisms pass traits on to their offspring. Had\nhe been aware of Mendel\u2019s work, he would have known.\nMendel had read the abbey\u2019s German translation of Origin and was in general supportive of Darwin\u2019s\nideas. A minor mystery is why Mendel apparently never contacted Darwin himself. Unfortunately, when\nMendel died in 1884 the next Abbot burned all his papers to end disputes over taxation, so we do not\nknow if Mendel ever considered writing to Darwin.\nMendel\u2019s work was rediscovered in 1900, sixteen years after his death. It was then realized that his\nexperiments provided the description of inheritance that Darwin\u2019s theory lacked. The extreme importance\nof Mendel\u2019s work was recognized and he finally received the credit for one of the great discoveries in\nthe history of science.\nThe current theory of evolution, the modern evolutionary synthesis (or neo-darwinism), explains that\nthe evolution of species occurs through a combination of Darwin\u2019s mechanism of natural selection and\nGregor Mendel\u2019s theory of genetics. This synthesis, was produced between 1936 and 1947. The previous\ndevelopment of population genetics, between 1918 and 1932, was a stimulus, as it showed that Mendelian\ngenetics was consistent with natural selection and gradual evolution. The neo-darwinian synthesis is the\ncurrent paradigm in evolutionary biology.\nThere is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed\ninto a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to\nthe fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most\nwonderful have been, and are being evolved.\nThe last words of The Origin of Species, 1st Edition, Charles Darwin (1859)\n54\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Matter and Light\n5 Matter and Light\nYour goals for this chapter are to know the following:\n\u2022 What is meant by wave-particle dualism?\n\u2022 List the major divisions of the electromagnetic spectrum in order of decreasing wavelength.\nDo the same for the visible portion of the spectrum.\n\u2022 How is each of the three types of spectra\u2013continuous, bright-line, and dark-line\u2013produced?\n\u2022 What type of spectrum is associated with our sun and other stars?\n\u2022 Why do different elements have different patterns of lines in their spectra?\nThe word \u2018universe\u2019 is normally taken to mean everything that exists. The most obvious components of\nthe universe are mater and light. By the end of the 19th century, is was known that light is simply one\nform of electromagnetic radiation that also includes radio waves, infrared and ultraviolet light, X-rays,\nand gamma rays. The matter that we are most familiar with consists of the chemical elements in the\nform of atoms composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Surprisingly, the chemical elements make\nup just a small part of the matter of the universe, most of which is in the form of a mysterious dark\nmatter. More of that later.\nPhysical events are interactions between matter and energy, one form of which is electromagnetic\nradiation. These events unfold within the arena of space-time\n5.1 Atoms\nEmpedocles was a Greek philosopher who sometime around 450 BCE introduced the concept that\nall matter is made up, in differing proportions, of four elemental substances, earth, air, fire and water,\nand that the ratios of these affect the properties of the matter. Empedocles\u2019 theory was an important\ndevelopment in scientific thinking because it was the first to suggest that some substances that looked\nlike pure materials, like stone, were actually made up of a combination of different elements.\nDemocritus, some 30 years later, introduced the concept of atoms. Democritus taught that \u201cnothing exists\nexcept atoms and the void: all else is mere opinion.\u201d He conceived of atoms as indivisible and eternal,\nand in fact the word atom is derived from the Greek word meaning \u201cthat which cannot be divided.\u201d The\natoms of Democritus were small, discrete, and identical in composition, though they might differ in size\nand shape with the differences in size and shape determining the specific properties of the substance.\nAccording to Democritus, perceived changes in the world were produced by changes in the groupings\nof atoms.\n55\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Matter and Light\nAristotle accepted the theory of Empedocles but rejected that of Democritus. He argued that logic\nruled out the concept of discrete atoms. The atoms of Democritus had extension in space and were\nidentical in composition, but these properties are not compatible with indivisibility: extension in space\nimplies divisibility and composition implies yet smaller parts. Aristotle taught that matter is continuous\nrather than discrete in nature and that \u201ceverything continuous is divisible into divisibles that are\ninfinitely divisible.\u201d\nDespite philosophical difficulties, the concept of atoms was too persuasive to be dismissed and by the\n17th century most scientists, including Galileo and Newton, were atomists. In the early 19th century, the\nEnglish chemist John Dalton used the concept to account for chemical reactions, placing atomic theory\nin a scientifically respectable context for the first time. By the end of the 19th century, the concept of the\natom was well established, though some influential scientists at the time did not accept the atom as a\nreal constituent of nature. It was not until the early 20th century that an experiment suggested by Albert\nEinstein proved the existence of atoms.\nOur current atomic theory is based on quantum mechanics and is a nonvisualizable model. Our best\nvisualizable model is the planetary model with a tiny nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded at a\nrelatively great distance by electrons. The nucleus, though only a tiny fraction of the size of the atom, contains\nalmost all of the mass of the atom. The atom is overwhelmingly empty space. Ernest Rutherford, who\nsuggest this model in 1911, referred to the nucleus as \u201ca fly in a cathedral,\u201d a dimensionally correct analogy.\n56\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Matter and Light\nProtons are positively charged particles, and, as the name implies, neutrons are neutral. These two types\nof particles have a tendency to bind together under the influence of the strong nuclear force. They have\ncomparable masses, with the neutron being slightly more massive than the proton. The electron is a\nnegatively charged particle, only about one-two-thousandth the mass of the proton. It is not affected by the\nstrong nuclear force, but is attracted to the positively charged nucleus by the much weaker electromagnetic\nforce. The combination of the strong nuclear and the electromagnetic force holds atoms together.\n5.2 The Chemical Elements\nA chemical element is any substance that cannot be broken down into simpler materials by chemical\nmeans. Hydrogen, oxygen, and iron are examples of common elements. An atom is the smallest possible\nquantity of an element. Such substances as salt and water, on the other hand, can be broken down\nchemically, and are called compounds. Compounds are composed of molecules, which are chemical\ncombinations of atoms. For example, a water molecule is composed to two hydrogen atoms and one\noxygen atom, and written H O.\n2\nThe nucleus of an atom is composed of neutrons and protons. The composition of the nucleus is described\nby an atomic number, Z, defined as the number of protons in the nucleus, and an atomic mass number,\nA, defined as the number of neutrons plus protons in the nucleus. If the atom is neutral, then there\nmust be Z electrons in orbit around the nucleus to balance the positive charge of the nucleus. In many\nways, the neutron and the proton behave as if they are two different states of the same particle. For this\nreason, the word nucleon is used to include both particles. Thus, the atomic mass number is the number\nof nucleons in the nucleus.\nThe notation used to specify a particular nucleus is A X, where X represents the chemical symbol of the\nZ\nelement. For example, the helium nucleus consisting or 2 protons and 2 neutrons is represented as 4 He.\n2\nEach chemical element has a different number of protons in its nucleus. The number of protons determines\nthe number of orbital electrons, which in turn determines the chemical properties of the element. The\nperiodic table of the elements is arranged in order of increasing numbers of protons in the nucleus.\n57\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Matter and Light\nFigure 1 The Periodic Table\nIn 1913, the Danish physicist Niels Bohr modified the planetary model by suggesting that the electron\norbits of the planetary model can have only certain allowed radii. That is, an electron can orbit the nucleus\nat certain allowed distances, but all radii between these allowed distances are forbidden. Each of the\nallowed orbits corresponded to a specific energy of the atom. Thus the energy of an atom, like the radius\nof the electron\u2019s orbit, is restricted. All intermediate energies are forbidden. The Bohr model of the atom\nwas an extremely radical suggestion at the time. Not even Bohr himself could give any theoretical reason\nwhy the electron orbits would be restricted in this way. His primary justification of this assumption was\nsimply that it seemed to fit observed patterns in the properties of atoms, namely that each type of atom\nemitted or absorbed only certain energies of electromagnetic radiation.\n5.3 Radioactive Decay\nSome nuclei are inherently unstable. Their ratio of protons to neutrons is incorrect for the mass of the\nnucleus. In general, the heavier the nucleus is, the more neutrons relative to the number of protons are\nrequired for stability. For instance, a helium nucleus can be stable with two protons and two neutrons,\nbut a lead nucleus with 82 protons requires something on the order of 126 neutrons to be stable. Nuclei\nwith the wrong ratio for stability will respond either by ejecting a helium nucleus (alpha decay), changing\na neutron into a proton (beta negative decay), or changing a proton into a neutron (beta positive decay).\nSometimes a nucleus can have an appropriate neutron to proton ratio, but too much energy. In this case,\nthe excess energy can be emitted in the form of electromagnetic radiation (gamma decay).\n58\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Matter and Light\nRadioactive decay occurs on a time scale that depends on the particular nucleus \u2013 some almost\nimmediately, others taking billions of years. The rate at which a particular radioactive nucleus decays is\ngiven by the half-life, the time it takes one-half of the nuclei to decay. For example, carbon-14, a nucleus\nwith six protons and eight neutrons, decays to nitrogen-14, a nucleus with seven protons and seven\nneutrons. Its half-life is 5730 years. That is, in each interval of 5730 years, half the remaining carbon-14\nnuclei decay. Thus after 11,460 years (two half-lives) only one-quarter of the original number of radioactive\nnuclei remain. After three half-lives, only one-eighth would be left, and so on. Mathematically, this is\ncalled exponential decay.\nHalf lives make it possible for radioactive substances to be used for dating. For example potassium-40\ndecays to argon-40 with a half-life of 1.3 billion years. Argon-40 is a gas, so if a rock is melted, the argon\nis released into the atmosphere. Once it has re-solidified, any additional argon produced by radioactive\ndecay will be trapped in the rock. In this way, the ratio of argon to potassium-40 is a direct measure of\nthe time since the rock has solidified. For instance, if the ratio of argon to potassium-40 is exactly 3 to\n1, then only one-quarter of the original potassium-40 remains and the rock must be exactly two half-\nlives, or 2.6 billion years, old. If the ratio is 3.7 to 1, the equation of exponential decay gives an age of\n3.2 billion years. This technique applied to solar system rocks indicates that the oldest ones (meteorite\nfragments of asteroids) are about 4.6 billion years old, and hence the age of the solar system is about\n4.6 billion years.\n59\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Matter and Light\n5.4 Electromagnetic Radiation\nEssentially everything we know about the content of the universe, and certainly about objects beyond\nour solar system, is based on deciphering the information contained in the electromagnetic radiation\nemitted by those objects. We know of the stars in the sky because we see them. As more powerful optical\ntelescopes were built, we discovered additional kinds of objects in the sky. Finally, in the last half of the\n20th century, we discovered still more of the contents of the universe through the use of telescopes that\ncould \u201csee\u201d in other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nQuestions about the nature of electromagnetic radiation began at least as far back as the ancient Greeks\nwith their ideas about the nature of visible light. Various models were suggested, but it wasn\u2019t until the\nsecond half of the 17th century that the nature of light began to be formally debated among scientists.\nThe one thing that was clear was that light could transfer energy from one place to another. For example,\nsunlight can heat water. Two schools of thought arose as to how this was accomplished.\nRobert Hooke and Christian Huygens, contemporaries of Newton, proposed a wave model. According to\nthis view, light was like sound. When one speaks, the vocal cords cause the air in the throat to oscillate,\nwhich causes the air near it to oscillate, and so on until the air in the vicinity of the listener\u2019s eardrum\noscillates. Each particle in the medium merely oscillates about some fixed position; there is no net\ntransfer of air, just energy.\nIsaac Newton objected to this model. He preferred the idea of particles moving through space from one\nmaterial object to another. When one throws a baseball at a target, energy is transferred. In this same\nmanner, Newton viewed light as a stream of tiny particles moving at high speeds. Like bullets fired from\na gun.\nAt the time, there was no experimental way to distinguish clearly between the wave model and the particle\nmodel. This began to change in the early part of the 19th century when evidence began to accumulate\nin favor of the wave model. The apparent coup de grace to the particle theory was delivered in 1865\nwhen James Clerk Maxwell, an English theoretical physicist, proposed his theory of electromagnetism.\nThe theory suggested that electromagnetic disturbances could be propagated through space as waves.\nThe theoretical speed of the waves was exactly that of the speed of light, which had been accurately\nmeasured some years earlier. The conclusion seemed unmistakable: light is not only a wave, it is an\nelectromagnetic wave.\nMaxwell\u2019s theory also made it clear that visible light was just part of an electromagnetic spectrum; that\nelectromagnetic waves with wavelengths both longer and shorter than visible light should exist. Heinrich\nHertz, the discoverer of one of these, radio waves, said in 1889,\n60\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Matter and Light\nWe know that light is a wave motion. We know the speed of the waves, we know their length.\nIn a word, we know completely the geometric relationships of this motion. These things no\nlonger permit of any doubt, and a refutation of this view is unthinkable to the physicist. In so\nfar as human beings can know the truth, the wave theory is a certainty.\nPerhaps unthinkable to most, but not to Albert Einstein. In 1905, the same year he published his\ntheory of relativity, his paper suggesting an experiment to prove the existence of atoms, and a paper\non thermodynamics that earned him a Ph.D. from the University of Zurich, the 23-year old Einstein,\npublished a paper suggesting that in some situations electromagnetic radiation would behave as if it were\na stream of particles. He even suggested an experiment that would show this to be the case.\nAccording to Einstein, electromagnetic radiation interacts with matter as discrete packets of energy,\nlater called photons. The energy of a specific photon is associated with the wavelength of the radiation.\nThe longer wavelengths correspond to lower photon energies and the shorter wavelengths correspond\nto higher photon energies.\nThe experimental evidence soon indicated that Einstein was right. Electromagnetic radiation did, in some\ninstances, behave as if it were a stream of particles. But the evidence of the 19th century that it behaved in\nother instances as if it were a wave could not be ignored. However the two models are mutually exclusive.\nThere is no way to combine them into a single coherent model.\nThe resolution of this dilemma came by abandoning the effort to force electromagnetic radiation into one\nor the other model. Some phenomena have no analog in the world of everyday sensory experience. In\nthat world, a clear distinction exists between waves and particles. Something is either a wave or a particle,\nbut not both. However, at the submicroscopic level, the distinction no longer exists. Electromagnetic\nradiation is indisputably both wave-like and particle-like.\nThis conclusion is referred to a wave-particle duality. Because there is nothing in everyday experience that\nexhibits this dualism, it is impossible to visualize the true nature of electromagnetic radiation. Thinking\nabout a phenomenon for which there is no concrete analog can be an unsettling experience. As Einstein\nput it, \u201cIt is only with reluctance that one\u2019s desire for knowledge endures a dualism of this kind.\u201d\nScientists who must cope with this dilemma in their work take a pragmatic approach. They make use of\none or the other model, depending on the situation. In some situations, it is more appropriate to treat\nradiant energy as a wave. To explain how electromagnetic radiation travels through space, the wave model\nis necessary. To explain how electromagnetic radiation delivers energy to matter, the particle model is\nnecessary. Although this is a workable approach, one should not confuse these useful models with reality\nitself. Electromagnetic radiation is more complex than depicted by either the wave or the particle model.\n61\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Matter and Light\n5.5 The Electromagnetic Spectrum\nBy the first decade of the 20th century, physicists had discovered electromagnetic radiation in a wide\nrange of wavelengths. At one end of the spectrum are radio waves of long wavelength and low photon\nenergy. At the other end are gamma rays of short wavelength and high photon energy. All types of\nelectromagnetic radiation travel through space at the speed of light.\nElectromagnetic radiation can be produced in a number of different ways. The various regions of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum are usually classified according to the way in which the radiation is produced.\nRadio waves are produced by oscillating electric currents. This part of the spectrum is subdivided\naccording to the primary use of the radiation. Infrared, visible, and ultraviolet radiation is mostly\nproduced by transitions of the outermost electrons of atoms as the atoms move from a higher to a lower\nenergy state. X-rays are produced by the slowing of very high-speed electrons or by transitions of the\ninner orbital electrons of high-mass atoms. Gamma rays are emitted by the nuclei of atoms.\nThe distinction between infrared (below red), visible light, and ultraviolet (beyond violet) is based\nentirely on how the human eye responds to the radiation. Infrared radiation has wavelengths that are\ntoo long (or photons with too little energy) to excite the receptor cells in our eyes. Ultraviolet radiation\nhas wavelengths that are too short (or photons with too much energy). The range of wavelengths within\nvisible light correspond the perceived colors. The longest wavelength visible light is red, next orange,\nyellow, green, blue, and finally, violet with the shortest wavelength that can produce a visual response.\n62\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Matter and Light\nThe Electromagnetic Spectrum\nFigure 2 Electromagnetic Spectrum\n5.6 Spectroscopy\nSpectroscopy refers to the study of electromagnetic radiation based on the distribution of energy with\nrespect to wavelength. A spectrometer is any device that will take incoming radiation and separate it on\nthe basis of wavelength. A prism is an example. If sunlight falls on a prism, the light emerging from the\nother side will appear as a rainbow. The longer wavelength red light will come out at a slightly different\nangle than the shorter wavelength violet light. When electromagnetic radiation from various sources is\nstudied using a spectrometer, three distinct types of spectra are found. If all wavelengths within a certain\nrange are present, the spectrum is a continuous spectrum. When only certain wavelengths are present,\nthe spectrum is a bright-line spectrum. Finally, a dark-line spectrum is one in which almost all of the\nwavelengths are present, but certain ones are missing.\nA continuous spectrum is produced by a solid, a liquid, or a high-density gas. The total energy emitted\nand the distribution of this energy with respect to wavelength, are determined by the temperature of the\nemitting object. The spectrum is independent of the chemical composition of the object. An example of\nthis is the radiation emitted by an incandescent light bulb.\n63\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Matter and Light\nA bright-line spectrum is emitted by a hot, low-density gas. Unlike the continuous spectrum, it is\ncompletely determined by the chemical composition of the gas. Each chemical has its own distinctive\nbright-line spectrum. The spectrum identifies the element in the same way a fingerprint identifies an\nindividual. The explanation for this is the Bohr model. In this model each type of atom has its own distinct\nset of allowed energy levels, so only certain photon energies can be emitted as the atom moves from\na higher energy state to a lower state. A bright-line spectrum is also known as an emission spectrum.\nExamples of this type of spectrum include neon lights and the mercury vapor lamps that are commonly\nused to illuminate parking lots.\nA dark-line spectrum is produced when a continuous spectrum passes through a low-density gas. The\nwavelengths that are missing are, like the bright-line spectrum, and for the same reason, completely\ndetermined by the chemical composition of the low-density gas. In this case, however, the photons are\nbeing absorbed by the gas as the atoms move from a lower energy state to a higher state. An example of\na dark-line spectrum is the radiation emitted by our sun and by other stars. At a level near the surface\nof our sun, a continuous spectrum is emitted. However, before exiting the surface, the radiation must\npass through the sun\u2019s low density atmosphere. There wavelengths are absorbed by the various chemical\nelements that make up our sun\u2019s composition.\nTypes of Spectra\nFigure 3 Types of Spectra\nIn the 1830s the positivist philosopher Auguste Comte was asked if there was anything science would\nnever be able to determine. He gave what is almost certainly the right answer, yes, but then proceeded\nto give a wrong example. He famously said we could never know the chemical composition of the stars.\nThrough an analysis of their absorption spectra, we now know their composition quite well.\n64\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Present Universe\n6 The Present Universe\nYour goals for this chapter are to know the following:\n\u2022 Describe the Milky Way Galaxy?

There are approximately 5000 that are bright enough\nto be seen by human eyes. For most of the history of our species, that was all the stars that existed. After\nall, why would a creator make stars that could not be seen by us, the very purpose of creation?\n6.1 The Milky Way\nIn addition to the stars, moon, planets, and sun, there is also an arc of diffuse light that stretches across\nthe sky from horizon to horizon. It is prominent; obviously something of importance. Virtually all cultures\nhad myths to explain its origin. Ancient Armenian mythology called the arc The Straw Thief\u2019s Way.\nAccording to legend, the god Vahagn stole some straw from the Assyrian king Barsham and brought it\nto Armenia during a cold winter. When he fled across the heavens, he spilled some of the straw along\nthe way. The Cherokee called it The Way the Dog Ran Away explaining it as cornmeal spilled by a dog\nwho stole it and spilled it as he was fleeing.\nWe call it the Milky Way. The name comes from the Greek myth of its origin. Zeus had a son, Heracles,\nwho was born of a mortal woman. Zeus was fond of him and decided to let the infant suckle on his\ndivine wife Hera\u2019s milk when she was asleep, an act which would endow the baby with godlike qualities.\nWhen Hera woke up and realized she was breastfeeding an unknown infant, she pushed him away and\nthe spurting milk became the Milky Way. Our word galaxy also comes from this story, as the Greek for\nmilk is gala.\nAlthough some presocratics speculated that the Milky Way may consist of stars too close together and\nfaint to be seen as individual stars, the idea was not accepted by Aristotle and was therefore not part\nof the Late Medieval and Renaissance worldviews. Like so much of Aristotle\u2019s work, his view of the\nMilky Way did not survive Galileo\u2019s empirical approach to knowledge. With his telescope, Galileo was\nable to see the individual stars within the Milky Way. Thus the realm of the stars was no longer seen as\nspherical but rather disk shaped. Galileo, not given to modesty, bragged that, \u201cThe universe which I with\nmy astonishing observations and clear demonstrations had enlarged a hundred, nay, a thousand-fold\nbeyond the limits commonly seen by wise men of all centuries past, is now for me so diminished and\nreduced, it has shrunk to the meager confines of my body.\u201d\nThis disk model of the Milky Way survived into the 20th century, but it presented a serious philosophical\nproblem. The Copernican Principle, the notion that we are not the center of the universe, seemed to\nbe contradicted by the model. As astronomers peered into the disk, it appeared to end at about the\nsame distance from the solar system in all directions. Are we in the center after all? Observationally it\nappeared that we are.\n66\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Present Universe\nWell, we are not. The problem is that the disk of our galaxy, in addition to stars, unexpectedly contains\ngas and dust. The dust is very effective at absorbing and scattering visible light, thus blocking our view\nof the more distant stars in the disk. The actual disk is many times bigger than the part we can see, and,\nrather than being in the center, we are actually out in the suburbs. By 1920 this was a well established\nfact, primarily due to the work of the American astronomer Harlow Shapley.\nSchematic Diagram of the Milky Way Galaxy\nOur Solar System is located about 2/3 of the way from the\nnucleus to the edge of the galaxy\nFigure 6.1 Schematic Milky Way\n6.2 Other Galaxies\nWhat had not been well established by 1920, was whether our Milky Way Galaxy was unique in the\nuniverse or simply one of many galaxies separated by vast distances of space. The debate centered on\nthe nature of spiral nebulae, fuzzy, spiral-shaped structures in the night sky. Some argued that they were\nother galaxies like our own, but at extreme distances from us, making them appear small. Others argued\nthat they could not possibly be that far away. Each side supported their position with complex, but, in\nthe end, inconclusive evidence. The fundamental problem was that in 1920 there was no way to directly\nmeasure the distances to the spiral nebulae.\n67\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Present Universe\nA variable star is one whose luminosity changes with time. It had been established earlier that certain\nvariable stars, Cepheid variables, have luminosities that are proportional to their periods of variability.\nFor example, a Cepheid variable that completed its periodic variability in 30 days was more luminous\n(emitted more energy per second) than one with a period of 20 days. The period and luminosity are\nrelated by a mathematical equation. Because the period of variability is easy to measure, the period-\nluminosity relationship can be used to establish the luminosity of the star. Then by measuring the amount\nof energy we actually receive from the star (the apparent brightness of the star), the distance to the star\ncan be determined. The apparent brightness of an object diminishes with the distance from the object. For\nexample, the wattage of an incandescent light bulb is a measure of its luminosity, its intrinsic brightness.\nIf you move farther and farther from the bulb, it appears dimmer and dimmer. The inverse-square law\nis an exact mathematical relationship between luminosity, apparent brightness and distance. However\nthis method could not be utilized to measure the distances to spiral nebulae until there was a telescope\npowerful enough to see individual stars in the spiral nebulae.\nIn 1919, the 100-inch Hooker telescope of the Mount Wilson Observatory was completed and Edwin\nHubble was put in charge of it. With this powerful instrument, Hubble was able to identify Cepheid\nvariables in several spiral nebulae. He determined that they were at great distances from us, distances\nconsistent with their being galaxies. His historic 1924 paper ended the debate, finally establishing the\nfact that we live in an Island Universe. The spiral nebulae became spiral galaxies, more or less like our\nown spiral galaxy. In addition to spiral galaxies, Hubble also observed elliptical and irregular galaxies.\nTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTThhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiisssssssssssssssssssssss eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-----------------------bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooookkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk\niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiisssssssssssssssssssssss mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaadddddddddddddddddddddddeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiittttttttttttttttttttttthhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\nSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEETTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN\nSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeetttttttttttttttttttttttaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\nPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF cccccccccccccccccccccccooooooooooooooooooooooommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmpppppppppppppppppppppppooooooooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnntttttttttttttttttttttttsssssssssssssssssssssss fffffffffffffffffffffffooooooooooooooooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP dddddddddddddddddddddddeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeevvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelllllllllllllllllllllllooooooooooooooooooooooopppppppppppppppppppppppeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrsssssssssssssssssssssss\nwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.......................ssssssssssssssssssssssseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeetttttttttttttttttttttttaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssssssssssssssssssssssiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigggggggggggggggggggggggnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn.......................cccccccccccccccccccccccooooooooooooooooooooooommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\n68\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Present Universe\nThe Andromeda Galaxy-our twin at a\ndistance of 2.2 million light-years.\nFigure 6.2 Andromeda Galaxy\nHubble realized that the galaxies are not uniformly, or even randomly, distributed throughout space.\nRather they are clustered. Our own galaxy is part of a cluster of about 30 galaxies called the Local\nGroup. At distances many times greater than the distance between galaxies in a cluster, are other\nclusters of galaxies. We now know that in addition to clusters of galaxies, there are clusters of clusters,\nsuperclusters as they are called. This seems to be the last level of clustering. However, the superclusters\nare not uniformly or randomly distributed either, but rather are distributed around the edges of huge\nvolumes of seemingly empty space known as voids. As best we can determine, on the scale of voids the\nuniverse is at last homogeneous. As far as our most powerful telescopes can see, this distrubutional\nmodel appears to hold. The universe is like foam, with the voids being the empty space within bubbles\nformed by the superclusters.\n6.3 Hubble\u2019s Law\nHubble continued to use the 100-inch telescope to study galaxies. In 1929, he published a paper that\nwould later be recognized as the most important observational fact about the universe ever discovered.\nIt is a simple fact that on the surface did not seem particularly revolutionary. It was only after it was\nproperly interpreted that it became so.\n69\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Present Universe\nThe light we receive from galaxies has many wavelike properties. It had been known for some time that\nthe light we receive from galaxies beyond the Local Group is redshifted. That is the wavelengths of the\nlight are stretched out relative to the light we receive from nearby objects. In the visible spectrum, red\nis the longest wavelength and blue is toward the shorter end of the spectrum. If the wave is longer than\nexpected it is called redshifted. Conversely, if it is shorter than expected, it is called blueshifted. The light\nfrom distant galaxies is always redshifted. By 1929 Hubble had gathered enough data to establish that\nthe amount of the redshift is direct proportion to the distance to the galaxy from which it was emitted.\nThis observational fact is now known as Hubble\u2019s Law.\nHubble\u2019s Law\n:\nFor distant galaxies, the\nredshift in their radiation\n(the amount by which the\nwavelength of the radiation\nis increased) is directly\nproportional to the distance\nto the galaxy. Published in\n1929.\nEdwin Hubble with his\ncat NikolausCopernicus.\n(Colliers Magazine, 1949)\nFigure 6.3 Hubble\u2019s Law\nHubble recognized that he had established an important piece of information about the nature of the\nuniverse, but he did not know exactly what that information was telling us. He was an observational\nastronomer, and what was needed was a theoretical explanation. That explanation was given in 1930 by\nthe British theoretical physicist, Arthur Eddington.\n70\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Present Universe\n6.4 The Expansion of Space\nIronically, the explanation had been available well before the existence of other galaxies had been\nestablished. In 1905 Albert Einstein published his Theory of Relativity, a description of the nature of space\nand time that united them in a way that predicted the existence of some seemingly bizarre phenomena.\nAmong them were time dilation and space contraction, which were soon empirically verified. It also\npredicted the equivalence of mass and energy, that is, that mass is just another form of energy, the two\nrelated by the famous equation, E = mc2. He realized at the time that this 1905 theory was incomplete.\nHe was certain that gravity was a property of space-time but it was not included in his original theory.\nHe immediately set about to fix this.\nBy 1915 he had revised his theory to include gravity. The new version is now known as the General\nTheory of Relativity, as opposed to the 1905 version, now called the Special Theory of Relativity. As\na first application of the new theory, Einstein calculated the orbit of Mercury. It was well known that\ncalculations based on Newton\u2019s theory of gravity gave slightly the wrong answer. As with the discrepancy\nin the calculation of Uranus\u2019 orbit, the initial attempt to fix this involved an undiscovered planet that\nwas influencing the orbit. The planet was even given a name \u2013 Vulcan. It soon became clear that such a\nplanet did not exist and therefore there must be a problem with Newton\u2019s theory of gravity. Calculations\nbased on Einstein\u2019s theory of gravity, however, gave exactly Mercury\u2019s observed orbit. Clearly Einstein\u2019s\ntheory was an improvement over Newton\u2019s.\n71\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Present Universe\nIn addition to giving the correct orbit of Mercury, there was another feature of Einstein\u2019s theory that\nmade it a significant improvement \u2013 it did away with action-at-a-distance. In Einstein\u2019s theory the sun\ndoes not pull on the planets. Rather it warps the space-time in its vicinity in such a way that the inertial\nmotion of the planets through space-time is an elliptical orbit around the sun.\nBy 1916 however, Einstein began to have doubts about the theory. When he applied it to the universe as\na whole, it clearly predicted that space must be either expanding or contracting. The nature of gravity\nin the theory would not allow for a static universe. In the theory, gravity was only attractive and this\nwould cause an initially static universe to collapse in on itself. He, and the other scientists he consulted,\nbelieved that the universe was in fact static. Because of the theory\u2019s ability to account for Mercury\u2019s orbit,\nEinstein knew that he was on the right track, so rather than discard the theory, he tried to tweak it to\neliminate the offending prediction. He introduced a repulsive force into his equations, the cosmological\nconstant, whose sole purpose was to balance the attraction of gravity and thus allow for a static universe.\nEinstein, however, had made an error. His introduced repulsive force could not properly balance gravity.\nThe equilibrium between the two was unstable, like balancing a pencil on its point. Theoretically possible,\nbut any slight disturbance unbalances it, in this case resulting in either the expansion or contraction of\nthe universe. Exactly what Einstein was trying to avoid. This was pointed out in the 1920s by at least two\ntheoreticians, one a Belgian priest, George Lemaitre, about whom we\u2019ll have more to say later.\nEinstein lecturing on the GTR in Pasadena, California, 1932.\nEinstein developed the general theory of relativity (GTR) in 1915.\nIt predicted that space had to be either expanding or contracting.\nEinstein believed this to be incorrect and changed his theory.\nFigure 6.4 Einstein Pasadena\n72\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Present Universe\nThese papers were mostly ignored by other physicist and it is unclear that Einstein himself was aware of\nthem. One person who was aware on them however, was Arthur Eddington, considered at the time to be\none of the few physicists who actually understood Einstein\u2019s theory. When he heard about Hubble\u2019s Law,\nhe immediately saw it as observational evidence that space is expanding. When Einstein learned of this,\nhe called his inclusion of the cosmological constant in his theory \u201cthe greatest blunder of my scientific\ncareer.\u201d We will learn in the next chapter that it may not have been a blunder after all.\nThe expansion of space does not mean that everything in the universe is getting bigger with time. Some\nstructures are held together by forces sufficiently strong to prevent the expansion of space from increasing\ntheir size. This is true for galaxies (and everything in them) as well as for clusters of galaxies. However,\ngravitational attraction between the clusters and superclusters is not sufficiently strong, and the expansion\nof space results in the increase in the sizes of the superclusters and the voids.\nThe concept of expanding space is a complex and confusing one. The first question most people ask is,\n\u201cWhat is it expanding into?\u201d Unfortunately this question doesn\u2019t have an answer, at least not one that\ncan be visualized. Generally when we think of something expanding, we visualize it getting bigger. That\nis, we visualize its edges as moving outward. But the universe has no edges. Aside from the fact that an\nedge to the universe doesn\u2019t make any sense (what would happen if you stepped over the edge?), the\nGeneral Theory of Relativity, the theory we use to describe the space-time of the universe, requires an\nunbounded universe. This is true whether the universe is infinite (clearly no edges) or finite (seemingly\nnot possible), either of which is allowed by the theory.\nOur universe has three spatial dimensions (at least, three that have extension). A finite but unbounded\nspace can only occur if the space is curved. To visualize curved space, one dimension greater than the\ndimensions of the space is required. Thus, we cannot visualize a curved three-dimensional space because\nwe cannot visualize in four dimensions. Since concrete, visualizable models are helpful in understanding\nabstract concepts, astronomers use a curved two-dimensional space to help us understand an expanding,\nfinite but unbounded universe.\nImagine a two dimensional object, something like the surface of a piece of paper. If it is not infinite, it is\nbounded by edges. But if we bend it into the shape of a sphere, curve it into the third dimension, it no\nlonger has edges. The surface of a sphere is a finite, but unbounded, two-dimensional surface. We can\nvisualize a finite but unbounded two-dimensional surface because we can visualize in three dimensions.\nWe cannot visualize a finite but unbounded three-dimensional surface because we cannot visualize in\nfour dimensions.\n73\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Present Universe\nNow imagine the sphere to be the surface of a balloon and let that surface represent the space of a fictitious\ntwo-dimensional universe. Obviously, expansion will be represented in this model by blowing up the\nballoon. If we attach small pieces of paper to the surface of the balloon and let each represent a cluster of\ngalaxies, we have a pretty good representation of the consequences of expanding space for our universe.\nAs the balloon is blown up, the clusters of galaxies get further apart (i.e. the sizes of superclusters and\nvoids increases) while the size of the clusters is unaffected. The distance between clusters is increasing,\nbut the clusters are not moving. That is, they are not moving through space, as they are fixed in space\n(stuck to the surface of the balloon in the model).\nAs three-dimensional beings, it is easy for us to answer the question, what is the space of the two-\ndimensional universe expanding into? It is expanding into the third dimension of space. However, this\nanswer would make no sense to two-dimensional beings. In their universe there is no third dimension\nto space. In a similar way, we could say that our three-dimensional universe is expanding into the fourth\ndimension. But that makes no sense to us. It is best to just stop asking the question in that way. We are\nseeking to visualize something that is inherently non-visulaizable.\nThe balloon model also represents another important fact about our universe. All places on the surface of\nthe balloon are equivalent. There is no center in this model universe, at least not one that is in the space\nof the universe itself \u2013 not on the surface of the balloon. Just as our universe has no edges, it also has\nno center. This is an important point to remember when we talk about the Big Bang in a later chapter.\n74\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Present Universe\nThe Balloon Model of Expanding Space\nClusters of galaxies are\nrepresented by pieces of\npaper on the balloon.\nAs the balloon is blown\nup its surface area (space)\nincreases with time.\nThe clusters of galaxies\ndo not increase in size.\nThey get further apart but\ndo not move through\nspace.\nFigure 6.5 Balloon Model\nExpansion of Space\n\u2022 1916 -Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity predicts that\nspace must be either expanding or contracting. Einstein\ndoes not believe this and tries to \u201cfix\u201d the theory.\n\u2022 1920s -Other astronomers and physicists show that all\nversions of the GTR require either the expansion or\ncontraction of space.\n\u2022 1929 -Hubble\u2019s Law.\n\u2022 1930 -Arthur Eddington explains Hubble\u2019s Law as the\nexpansion of space as described by the GTR.\n\u2022 1930 -Einstein calls his not accepting his original theory\n\u201cthe greatest blunder of my scientific career.\u201d\nFigure 6.6 Expansion of Space\n75\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Present Universe\nThe General Theory of Relative can be used to describe a universe that is either finite or infinite, just\nas it can be use to describe a universe that is either expanding or contracting. Observational data is\nrequired to determine which of these theoretical possibilities matches our actual universe. Hubble\u2019s\nLaw is observational evidence that we live in an expanding, rather than a contracting, universe. In our\nballoon model, we represented a finite universe. However, recent evidence seems to indicate that we live\nin an infinite, rather than a finite, universe.\nIf the universe is infinite, how can it be expanding? This is perhaps even more difficult to imagine than\na finite expanding universe. How can there be more space later if there is already an infinite amount of\nit now? One idea that might help with this is to think of numbers. How many whole numbers are there?\nThere are an infinite number of them. If we divide each odd whole number by two we get another infinite\nset of numbers. Combining these new numbers with the whole numbers, we have half again as many\nnumbers. There are still an infinite number of them, but, in a sense, the infinite set of whole numbers\nhas expanded to an even larger infinity.\nMaybe that doesn\u2019t help much, but it\u2019s not important. We simply cannot conceive of the universe as a\nwhole and it\u2019s not helpful to try. When you think of the universe, just think of a finite part of it, say a\npart big enough to contain many voids and superclusters, and know that the rest of the universe is just\nmore of the same.\n6.5 The Contents of Galaxies\nWhen we think about galaxies, we visualize them as our telescopes see them: stars with some interstellar\ngas and dust. By the 1970s, astronomers had come to realize that these components of galaxies make\nup only a small fraction of their mass. The additional mass is called dark matter and is inferred to exist\nbecause of its gravitational effect on visible matter. This is the only way it can be detected because it does\nnot emit, absorb, or scatter electromagnetic radiation. Thus, it must consist of uncharged particles. At the\npresent time we do not know the nature of this matter, only that it is not made up of ordinary matter:\nprotons, neutrons, and electrons. Dark matter will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 9.\nIn addition to dark matter, most galaxies contain supermassive, but extremely compact, objects at their\ncenter. The evidence indicates that these objects are black holes with masses on the order of hundreds\nof thousands to billions of times the mass of our sun. The object at the center of our Milky Way Galaxy\nhas a mass of about four million solar masses. Although his is a very large mass for a single object, it\nis small relative to the mass of our galaxy, whose stars alone have an estimated mass of hundreds of\nbillions of solar masses.\n76\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Present Universe\n6.6 The Universe vs The Visible Universe\nThere is consistently confusion in TV programs and also in some textbooks about what is meant by the\nword \u2018universe.\u2019 Generally speaking it means everything that exists. But there are times when what is\nreally meant by the term is the visible universe; that is, the part of the universe that we have observational\naccess to. The evidence at the present strongly indicates that the universe is infinite. However, because\nthe age of the universe (at least that part of the universe for which observational evidence is possible)\nis finite (13.7 billion years), the visible universe is finite.\nAs we look out into space we are also looking back in time. Light travels at 186,000 miles per second. At\nthis speed it takes 2.2 million years for light from the Andromeda galaxy to reach us, so another way to\nquantify the distance to Andromeda is the say that it is 2.2 million light-years away. Some galaxies we are\nable to observe are more than 10 billion light-years away. Obviously we cannot observe anything that is\nmore than 13.7 billion light-years away, and, thus, the observable or visible universe is finite, extending\nout 13.7 billion light-years from us in all directions. This is our so-called \u2018horizon.\u2019 The Big Bang model\ndoes not attempt to describe that region of space significantly beyond our horizon \u2013 space-time could\nwell be quite different out there.\nIt is not uncommon to hear a commentator say that at a certain time after the Big Bang, the universe was\nthe size of a pea. Often they will even hold up a pea to show you how small it was. In fact the universe\nprobable is, and always has been, infinite. What they really mean is that, at a certain time after the Big\nBang, the visible universe was the size of a pea. This is ok because the visible universe is finite in size\nand getting bigger with time. However, it is very misleading. A pea has a center and an edge in space.\nThe visible universe does not. This further leads to the idea that the Big Bang occurred at the center of\nthis pea and matter has spread out to the size of a pea since then. This is not the case.

But there\nis an even more important criterion \u2013 the ability to make predictions of facts that are not known at the\ntime. If these predictions turn out to be true, the theory is not proven true, for it is always possible that\na later prediction of the theory will fail. However, with each new successful prediction, confidence in\nthe theory is strengthened. The concept of expanding space has made many such successful predictions\nand as a result is tentatively accepted by scientists as true. It is such an integral part of any explanation\nof the nature of the universe, that we will assume, for the purposes of discussion, that it is true.\n7.1 George Lemaitre\nIf the universe is expanding, the question arises as to what the universe was like in the past. The first person\nto address this question seriously was a Belgian cosmologist-theologian Abbe George Lemaitre. In 1927\nhe had shown that Einstein\u2019s attempt to eliminate the prediction of an expanding or contracting space\nfrom his General Theory of Relativity did not work. His paper received little attention and, discouraged,\nhe turned his research in other directions. However, with Eddington\u2019s explanation of Hubble\u2019s Law,\nLemaitre returned to cosmology in the 1930s.\nGeorge Lemaitre lecturing on\ncosmology.\nFigure 7.1 George Lemaitre\nLemaitre reasoned that if space is expanding, then the universe must have been denser in the past than\nit is now. Using the physics of the General Theory of Relative, he realized that there would have been a\ntime in the finite past when the universe would have been infinitely dense, and therefore our universe\nmust have had a beginning in time. This was contrary to the prevailing opinion among scientists.\n79\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Big Bang\nMost assumed that the universe was infinitely old; that it always was and would always be. Although\nLemaitre\u2019s model represented a significant philosophical and cosmological breakthrough, it was\ninadequate in terms of physics. There was little that could be done with the model to see if it could, in\nfact, evolve into the present universe. That would have required a knowledge of nuclear physics that\ndid not exist at the time. There was another reason why scientists were skeptical of Lemaitre\u2019s idea of a\nuniverse that had a beginning in time. He was a Catholic priest, and thus possibly predisposed to believing\nthat the universe had been created in the finite past. When science is used to predict something that the\npredicting scientist probably believed to be true to start with, one should be skeptical.\n7.2 George Gamow\nGeorge Gamow was born in Odessa, Russia in 1904. He received his Ph.D. in physics from the University\nof Leningrad in 1928 and in 1931 accepted a position of professor there. This was a time of increasing\noppression in the Soviet Union, and Gamow and his wife made several unsuccessful attempts to defect.\nAfter years of refusing to give them permission to leave, the government unexpectedly allowed them\nto attend the 1933 Solvay Congress in Belgium. They used this opportunity to leave the Soviet Union\nforever. Gamow spent the rest of the year at various scientific institutions in Europe and was appointed\nprofessor of physics at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., in 1934.\nGamow\u2019s first major contribution to physics was to explain the nature of alpha decay using the new\ntheory of quantum mechanics. By 1942 he had turned his attention to astrophysics, developing a theory\nof the internal structures of red giant stars. He became interested in Lemaitre\u2019s ideas concerning the\nearly universe, and as early as 1946 began to believe that the high temperatures of the early universe\ncould provide the appropriate conditions for the creations of the chemical elements in their proper\nratios. Since the time Lemaitre had first addressed the problem, significant advances in nuclear physics\nhas occurred. In 1948, Gamow and Ralph Alpher (Gamow\u2019s PhD graduate student) developed a model\nof an early universe consisting of neutrons at a very high temperature.\nWhen their work was published in 1948, the eminent astrophysicist Hans Bethe was surprised to find\nhimself listed as a co-author. Though Bethe had nothing to do with the work, the practical joker Gamow\nthought it would be funny to have an important paper authored by Alpher, Bethe, and Gamow, a pun\non the first three letters of the Greek alphabet: alpha, beta, and gamma. To Gamow\u2019s delight, the paper\nappeared in the April first issue of The Physical Review.\n80\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Big Bang\nGeorge Gamow\n1948 -Gamow used new\nknowledge of nuclear physics\nalong with the GTR to\ndescribe the early universe.\nHe assumed (like LeMaitre)\nthat the early universe was\nmuch hotter and denser than\nit is today and that the\nexpansion of space cooled it\nand allowed structures to form.\nHe intended to show how the\nhot, dense conditions of the\nearly universe could produce\nall the chemical elements\nGamow with Wolfgang Pauli present in the universe today.\nFigure 7.2 George Gamow\n81\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Big Bang\nThis theory (and its subsequent versions) is known as the Big Bang. Ironically the name was given to it\nby Fred Hoyle, in a BBC radio interview in 1949. Hoyle was co-author of an alternative cosmological\ntheory known as the Steady State theory and a strong critic of Gamow\u2019s theory. It is commonly reported\nthat Hoyle intended the term Big Bang to be pejorative, but he explicitly denied that this was the case.\nHe said it was just a striking image meant to emphasize for radio listeners the difference between his\nand Gamow\u2019s theories.\nThe Big Bang is an unfortunate term for the theory. It suggests an explosion, that is, matter flying out in\nall directions from a central point into previously unoccupied space. The Big Bang was not an explosion\nof matter. If anything\u2019 it was an explosion of space. Matter has filled all of space more or less uniformly\nsince the beginning of time.\nIn 1953, the model was modified so that it began with matter in the form of protons, neutrons, and\nelectrons. Through a series of nuclear reactions the protons and neutrons fused to form nuclei. This\nprocess is called nucleosynthersis. Gamow\u2019s model readily explained the high percentages of hydrogen\nand helium, but completely failed to account properly for the heavier elements. No matter how many\ntimes Gamow redid the calculations, nucleosynthesis essentially stops after helium. This was considered\nat the time to be a fatal flaw in the theory.\nGeorge Gamow\u2019s Big Bang theory assumed that the early universe was extremely hot and dense, and that\nthe temperature was continuously decreasing due to the expansion of space. These assumptions led to two\nunavoidable predictions. First, that the early universe essentially contained only the elements hydrogen\nand helium. This was a disappointment to Gamow. His motivation for beginning the calculations was to\nshow that the relative abundances of chemical elements present in the universe now could be explained\nby the hot, dense conditions of the early universe. Also, if the heavier elements were not produced in\nthe early universe neither he, nor anyone else at the time, knew where they could have come from.\nGamow also predicted that the universe should be filled with electromagnetic radiation left over from the\nevents of the early universe, but significantly cooled by the subsequent expansion of space. Shortly after\nthe ab\u03b3 paper, Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman calculated the present temperature of the radiation at\nabout 5 K (5 degrees above absolute zero). At the time this was an untestable prediction. For this and\nother reasons, the work of Gamow and his students, Alpher and Herman, was not taken very seriously.\n82\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Big Bang\nPredictions of the Big Bang\nmodel\nThe early universe contained only hydrogen and helium.\n\u2022\nBecause of the expansion of space and its cooling effect,\nnucleosynthesis only occurred between 3 to 4 minutes after\nthe big bang (A.B.B.) and essentially stopped after helium.\nThe universe is filled with a background radiation whose\n\u2022\ntemperature is a few degrees above absolute zero. When\nneutral atoms formed (about 370,000 yrs A.B.B.), the\nelectromagnetic radiation essentially stopped interacting\nwith matter. The expansion of space cooled the radiation\nfrom its initial value of about 3000 K to its present low\nvalue.\nFigure 7.3 Predictions of the Big Bang\nIt is important to note that the Big Bang theory is not a theory of the origin of the universe as it is\noften said to be. Neither when first proposed nor now does it say anything of the origin. The earliest\ntemperatures and densities are far too great to be described using our current understanding of physics.\nThe Big Bang theory is rather a description of the very early universe.\nOver his career, Gamow switched his interests from nuclear physics to astrophysics to cosmology. In the\n1950s he turned his attention of the origin of life. He quickly recognized the significance of the DNA\nmodel proposed by Crick and Watson in 1953, and realized that the bases contained a code for amino\nacids. Gamow is best known to the public for his excellent books popularizing abstract physical theories,\nseveral of which are still in print.\n83\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Big Bang\nGeorge Gamow explaining the\nuniverse to a group of students.\nFigure 7.4 George Gamow and students\n84\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Big Bang\n7.3 Robert Dicke\nThe first step toward confirming the first prediction was solving the problem of the origins of the heavier\nelements. This happened in 1957, ironically due in part to Fred Hoyle, the most prominent opponent of\nthe Big Bang. He and his colleagues were able to show that heavier elements could be produced in the\ninteriors of massive stars. Since then observations of the oldest stars in our galaxy and of very distant\ngalaxies early in their evolution have completely confirmed the prediction that the early universe was\nessentially pure hydrogen and helium.\nThe confirmation of the second prediction, the existence of what is now called the cosmic background\nradiation, constitutes one of the most important discoveries in the history of science. The story starts in the\nearly 1960s. Robert Dicke, and his colleagues at Princeton University, began to rethink the consequences\nof a Big Bang-like beginning to the universe. Working through the physics, Dicke, like Gamow before\nhim, realized that the early universe had to be nearly pure hydrogen and helium. This was no longer a\nproblem as it was by then known that heavier elements are produced in stars.\nDicke realized that if the universe had passed through a uniformly hot stage in its compressed past, then\nthe present universe would necessarily be filled with electromagnetic radiation, cooled from its initial\nhigh temperature by the expansion of space. This had also been predicted by Gamow. However when\nGamow predicted it, radio technology was not sufficiently advanced to detect radiation associated with\nsuch a low background temperature. As a result, the original prediction was soon forgotten. In 1975,\nDicke wrote,\n\u201cThere is one unfortunate and embarrassing aspect of our work on the fireball radiation. We\nfailed to make an adequate literature search and missed the more important papers of Gamow,\nAlpher, and Herman. I must take the major blame for this, for the others in our group were\ntoo young to know these old papers. In ancient times I had heard Gamow talk at Princeton,\nbut I had remembered his model universe as cold and initially filled only with neutrons.\u201d\nThe technological situation had improved by the time the Princeton group reached Gamow\u2019s earlier\nconclusion. It was now clear that such a background radiation should be observable, and the Princeton\nexperimentalists, unaware of the earlier prediction, immediately set about building an appropriate radio\nreceiver. If something like the Big Bang had occurred, the background radiation must exist, and although it\nwould not be an easy experiment, Dicke and his colleagues were confident they would be able to detect it.\nThe Princeton physicists were in a situation all scientists dream of. They were addressing a question of\nfundamental scientific importance. They would either discover the background radiation and provide\nextremely strong evidenced in favor of the Big Bang, or they would show that the background radiation\ndoes not exist and thereby disprove the Big Bang theory. In either case, a contribution to science worthy\nof its highest honor, the Nobel Prize, would result.\n85\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Big Bang\n7.4 Penzias and Wilson\nAt the same time the Princeton group was setting up their experiment to search for the background\nradiation, two radio astronomers were working on Bell Laboratories\u2019 horn-shaped radio telescope\nin nearby Homedale, New Jersey. The instrument was intended for use in trans-Atlantic telephone\ncommunication, and Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were assigned to evaluate the performance of\nthe telescope. In return for this rather mundane work, they would be allowed to use the telescope for\ntheir scientific work.\nPenzias and Wilson ran the tests at a wavelength of 7.35 centimeters, in the microwave region of the\nradio spectrum. They quickly found that no matter what direction in the sky the antenna was pointed,\nsome signal was received. This was totally unexpected. Because there should be nothing out there\nproducing radiation at this wavelength, they at first assumed that the signal was being generated within\nthe instrument itself.\nAlthough the level of the noise was not sufficient to significantly interfere with telephone conversations,\nPenzias and Wilson were consciousness scientists and wanted to understand where the noise was coming\nfrom. They carefully inspected the electronics, they covered all the rivets in the telescope horn with\naluminum tape, and they even took the horn itself apart and removed the \u201cwhite dielectric material\u201d\nleft behind by pigeons \u2013 but there was still far too much unaccounted for background noise. Penzias\nand Wilson were completely stumped. They had eliminated every conceivable source of the radiation\nand yet there it was, always present no matter where the antenna was pointed.\nIn 1965, a friend of Penzias\u2019, Bernard Burke of MIT, told him about a preprint paper he had seen by Jim\nPeebles, an experimental colleague of Robert Dicke\u2019s at Princeton, on the possibility of finding radiation\nleft over from the early universe. Penzias and Wilson began to realize the significance of their discovery\nand called Dicke. After Dicke hung up the phone, he said to his colleagues, \u201cWell boys, we\u2019ve been\nscooped.\u201d Penzias and Wilson had unknowingly discovered the predicted cosmic background radiation.\nThe two groups decided to publish their results jointly. Companion letters were rushed to the Astrophysical\nJournal Letters, with Penzias and Wilson announcing their observations and Dicke and his colleagues\nproviding the cosmological interpretation. The Princeton group soon completed their measurements\nverifying the work of Penzias and Wilson. The detection of the cosmic background radiation is regarded\nas the second most significant (after Hubble\u2019s Law) observation ever made concerning the nature of the\nuniverse. In 1978, Penzias and Wilson received the Nobel Prize for this discovery. Unfortunately, and\nmany think unfairly, Gamow was not included.\n86\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Big Bang\nArno Penzias and Robert Wilson\nEarly 1960s -Penzias and Wilson\nare hired by Bell Labs to evaluate\nthe performance of the new radio\ntelescope to be used in trans-Atlantic\ntelephone communications.\nThey find a small, unexplained\nsignal regardless of the direction\nthe telescope is pointed.

The Big Bang model had predicted the\nexistence of the background radiation, and the Steady State model not only did not predict it but could\nnot even explain it. It now appears as if the universe must have had a beginning \u2013 a moment in the past\nbeyond which it is impossible to trace any chain of cause and effect. Recent calculations indicate that\nthis beginning occurred about 13.7 billion years ago.\nTo return in your mind to the Big Bang, you would have to travel in time but not in space. The Big Bang\nwas here, in this very location, just far back in time. This planet, this solar system, this galaxy are at the\ncenter of the universe. This claim is, however, equally true for every other location in the universe. As\nwith the balloon model, all places in the universe are equivalent. The Big Bang did not occur at a point\nin space; that is, the expansion is not an expansion of matter into what was previously unoccupied space.\nAll of the space of the universe has been occupied, more or less uniformly, by matter and radiation from\nthe beginning of time. The expansion is an expansion of space itself. Most matter stays essentially at\nrest in the space it occupies. Where we are now is where the material particles that would eventually\nform our bodies were located (give or take a tiny fraction of the size of the visible universe) when the\nuniverse began.\n8.1 Quarks and Leptons\nAt the initial instant, the universe was in a state of such high density and temperature that our current\nphysical theories cannot be applied. Some highly speculative theories can be used to discuss the universe\n10-42 seconds after its beginnings. The physics used to describe the universe10-35 seconds after the Big\nBang, though still unconfirmed in the laboratory, is on somewhat firmer ground. This is the era of\nInflation, a time of extremely rapid expansion. Inflation explains several otherwise unexplainable facts\nabout the universe. Also, at the time the theory was proposed in the early 1980s, it made a prediction\nabout the geometry of the universe that everyone believed was false, but which by the 21st century had\nbeen shown to be true.\n88\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Early Universe\nOne millionth of a second after the beginning, expansion had reduced the temperature and density of the\nuniverse to well within the range covered by laboratory tested physical theories. To be on the conservative\nside, our discussion of the evolving universe will begin at this time. The temperature of the universe was\nabout 1012 K. The ordinary matter of the universe, the matter that will eventually form atoms, stars, and\nus, is at this time in the form of elementary particles \u2013 quarks and leptons.\n(Aside: Aristotle objected to the concept of elementary particles on the basis that, if they had extension\nin 3-dimensional space, they were, at least in principle, divisible and could not be elementary. It appears\nas if quarks and leptons do not, in fact, have extension in 3-dimensional space. After more than 2000\nyears, and long after scientists accepted the idea of elementary particles, Aristotle\u2019s legitimate objection\nhas been addressed and answered.)\n8.2 Protons and Neutrons\nThere are forces in nature that are capable of holding quarks and leptons together, but they are not infinitely\nstrong. If the temperature is too high, the particles will collide so violently that any structure that has existed\ntemporarily will be knocked apart by the impact. However, as the universe expands and cools, levels of\nstructure appear depending on the strength of the force responsible for the structure. The structure that\nis formed by the very strongest of these forces appears first. That force is the force that quarks exert on\none another. At a few millionths of a second after the beginning, when the temperature was about 1012 K,\ngroups of three quarks came together to from nucleons, particles that will eventually form atomic nuclei.\nDepending on the type of quarks involved, the nucleon will either have a positive charge (a proton) or\nno charge (a neutron). This era in the history of the universe is known as quark confinement.\nFormation of protons and neutrons\nAt t = 10-6 sec ABB, the Universe was cool\n\u2022\nenough for quarks to combine to form\nprotons and neutrons.\nElectron\nProton\nphotons\nNeutron\nFigure 8.1 Protons and neutrons\n89\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Early Universe\nThe second level of structure forms about 3 to 4 minutes later when the temperature has been reduced\nto 109 K. At the time of quark confinement, there are an equal number of protons and neutrons. Because\nof their slightly greater mass, nuclear reactions favor the transformation of neutrons to protons over the\ntransformation of protons to neutrons, so by this time protons outnumber neutrons about seven to one. It is\nnow cool enough for the strong nuclear force to bind the protons and neutrons together to form atomic nuclei.\nThe strong nuclear force is actually a residual force resulting from the interactions between the quarks\nthat form the protons and neutrons. This residual force is less strong than the force that binds quarks\nand therefore a lower temperature is required in order for it to exert an effect. Its nature also restricts it\nto very short ranges, unlike gravity or the electromagnetic force. The protons and neutrons must literally\ncome in contact with one another for the force to have an effect.\n8.3 Nuclei\nMost of the neutrons are quickly bound with protons to form a helium nucleus consisting of two neutrons\nand two protons. A small fraction of the neutrons are bound into nuclei consisting of one proton and\none neutron (hydrogen, sometimes called deuterium in this form), or two protons and one neutron\n(helium), Even rarer, nuclei consisting of three protons and four neutrons (lithium) can form. When\nall of the neutrons are bound into nuclei, left-over protons (hydrogen nuclei) constitute about 94% of\nthe nuclei and almost all of the rest are helium nuclei consisting of two protons and two neutrons. The\nother types of nuclei constitute only a tiny fraction of a percent of the nuclear matter.\n90\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Early Universe\nFormation of hydrogen and helium\nnuclei\nAt t = 3 to 4 minutes ABB, the universe was\n\u2022\ncool enough for protons and neutrons to\nstick together. Protons outnumber neutrons.\nHelium-4 Electrons\nnucleus, 6%\nHydrogen-1 Photon\nnucleus, 94%\nFigure 8.2 Hydrogen and helium\n8.4 Atoms\nThe third level of structure does not form until about 370,000 years after the Big Bang. This level consists\nof neutral atoms formed when electrons combine with nuclei due to the electromagnetic force of attraction\nbetween the negatively charged electrons and the positively charged nuclei. The electromagnetic force\nis very much weaker than the force that binds protons and neutrons to form nuclei, so much lower\ntemperatures must be reached before atoms can form, something on the order of 3000 K.\nIn this discussion of the early universe, we have focused on the development of structure in the universe.\nThe particles involved are the quarks and leptons and the structures are, first of all, protons and neutrons,\nthen nuclei, and finally, atoms. This matter, as we will learn later, makes up only a small fraction of the\nmatter in the universe. This other matter, sometimes called exotic matter or dark matter, does not form\nstructures and exists in the universe only in the form of elementary particles. Because our goal is to\ntrace the cosmological history of human beings, and because we are composed of ordinary matter,our\nfocus will be on the evolution of ordinary matter.\n91\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Early Universe\nFormation of hydrogen and helium\natoms\nAt t = 370,000 years ABB, the universe was\n\u2022\ncool enough for electrons to stick to\nhydrogen and helium nuclei.\nHydrogen-1\natom, 94%\nHelium-4\nPhotons\natom, 6%\nFigure 8.3 Atoms\nPrior to the formation of neutral atoms, photons interacted very strongly with matter. This interaction\nwas caused by the fact that the individual particles of matter (hydrogen nuclei, helium nuclei, and\nelectrons) are electrically charged. Photons (electromagnetic radiation, after all) interact very strongly\nwith charged matter, traveling only short distances before they are destroyed and new photons are\ncreated. Constantly interacting in this way, matter and electromagnetic radiation evolved together, both\nat a common temperature.\nHowever, with the formation of neutral atoms, the probability of interaction between matter and photons\nis reduced to near zero. The average distance a photon travels between interactions with matter suddenly\nbecomes so large that virtually all of the photons present in the universe at the time have not interacted with\nmatter since, and thus must still be in the universe. Matter and radiation began to evolve independently,\neach occupying the same universe more or less uniformly, but without interacting. This phenomenon is\nreferred to as decoupling. Matter has since gone on to form stars, planets, people, and so on, while the\ncontinuing expansion of space has caused the temperature of the electromagnetic radiation to drop. At\nthe time of decoupling, the temperature of the universe was about 3000 K. Today it is 2.73 K.\nThe scenario just described is the same reasoning that both Gamow and Dicke went through in analyzing\ntheir assumption that the universe began a finite time ago, in an extremely hot and dense state. That\nreasoning convinced them that the early universe was essentially pure hydrogen and helium. It also\nresulted in their independently predicting the existence of the cosmic background radiation, the discovery\nof which is the single most significant evidence in favor of the Big Bang theory.\n92\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Early Universe\nThe Evolving Universe\n\u2022 The Planck era.Time = 10-43sec, temp = 1032Kelvin.

The term comes\nfrom the fact that strong new boundary conditions have been placed on cosmological models as a result\nof precise measurements of important cosmological parameters. For the most part, this new knowledge\nhas resulted from increasingly detailed studies of the cosmic background radiation.\nIn 1989, NASA launched the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), which quickly produced a\nspectacular result: the temperature of the radiation is 2.725 K.

The image is a high resolution map of the temperature of the radiation.\nThe data represented in the map tells us the age of the universe (13.75 \u00b1 0.11 billion years), the rate at\nwhich it is currently expanding (71.0 \u00b1 2.5 km/sec per Mpc, where 1 Mpc = 3262 light years), the energy\ndensities of the various components of the universe (which we will treat in more detail later), and many\nadditional cosmological parameters.\nThe significance of the temperature fluxuations is that they correspond to density fluxuations of matter\nin the universe at the time the cosmic background radiation was produced, that is at the time neutral\nhydrogen and helium atoms formed in the early universe. This in turn, determines how gravity will\nclump the matter together to form the structures we see in the universe today, namely stars, galaxies,\nclusters, superclusters, and voids.\n96\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Modern Cosmology\n9.2 Dark Energy\nIn 1998, supernovae type Ia observations were carried out to measure the rate at which the expansion\nof space was slowing down. The fact that it was slowing down was expected due to the gravitational\nattraction of the clusters on one another. Instead, the data indicated that the rate of expansion was actually\nspeeding up. This was so contrary to our understanding of the universe at that time that the scientists\ninvolved were reluctant to publish the result. They were sure that it must be wrong. It was only when the\ntwo independent teams conducting the research learned that the other team had gotten the same result\nthat they dared to publish. Follow-up studies have unambiguously confirmed the result.\nWith the discovery that the expansion of space was accelerating rather than slowing down, new physics\nwas required. Acceleration meant that there must be a cosmic repulsive force that is stronger than the\nattractive force of gravity. This was completely unexpected, but, as it turns out, not totally unprecedented.\nBack in 1916, Einstein had suggested just such a force to \u201cfix\u201d the problem that his General Theory of\nRelativity predicted that space must be either expanding or contracting. This repulsive force entered his\ntheory in the form of the cosmological constant he added to his equations. After learning that space\nactually was expanding, Einstein called the inclusion of the cosmological constant the greatest blunder\nof his scientific career. Perhaps not.\nBy putting the cosmological constant back into the equations, we can explain the current acceleration of\nthe expansion. Perhaps it is not the correct explanation (we still have a lot to learn about the nature of the\nforce), but the calculations based on it are consistent with everything we know at this time. No matter what\nthe exact nature of this repulsive force is, the effect it has on the universe goes by the name dark energy.\nSupernovae brightness and the change\nin the rate at which space is expanding\nThe black line represents a constant expansion. The blue line represents the expected\ndeceleration due to gravity. The red line represents the best fit to the supernovae\nbrightness data (1998).\nThe data show that gravity controlled the rate of expansion of the early Universe (large\nredshifts). At more recent times (lower redshifts) the expansion is accelerating (positive\nslope). Thus, a repulsive force must now dominate gravitational attraction.\nFigure 9.3 Supernova brightness\n97\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Modern Cosmology\nWe believe that the force associated with the dark energy has been constant throughout the history of\nthe universe. On the other hand, the effect of self-gravity has not been constant. Earlier in the history\nof the universe, the clusters of galaxies were closer together than they are today, and, thus, the attractive\nforce between them was stronger. It was only after the universe had expanded for some time that the\nforce of the dark energy exceeded that of gravity and the expansion of space began to accelerate. The\ndata indicates that this occurred about 5 billion years ago.\nThe components of the universe that currently have significant consequences for the rate of the expansion\nof space are electromagnetic radiation, matter (both dark and ordinary) and dark energy. In order to\ncompare the effects of self-gravity to the effects of the repulsive force, the two, must be express in the\nsame units. The contributions of radiation and matter need to be expressed as energy densities rather\nthan mass densities.\nThe following figure represents the relative values of these densities as the universe ages. The horizontal\naxis represents time, but is express in terms of a scale factor representing the distance between fixed\ncoordinates in space as the universe expands. The value R = 1 is the present value and values less than one,\nrepresent the past when the fixed coordinates were closer together. The energy density of the radiation\ndecreases more quickly than the matter density because both the number density and the energy per\nphoton decrease with expansion, while for matter only the number density decreases, the energy (mass)\nis unaffected by expansion.\n98\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Modern Cosmology\nThe Energy\nDensity of\nthe Universe\nOver Time.\nR = 3 x 10-4matter domination begins.\n\u2022\nR = 9 x 10-4cosmic background radiation produced. 370,000\n\u2022\nyears ABB.\nR = 0.74 cosmological constant dominates and acceleration\n\u2022\nof expansion begins. 10 billion years ABB.\nFigure 9.4 Energy density\nThe evolution of the universe over the past 13.7 billion years is represented in the following figure.

For the next several\nbillion years, the expansion of the universe gradually slows, due to gravitational attraction. About 5\nbillion years ago, when the repulsive effect of dark energy overpowered the universe\u2019s self-gravity, the\nexpansion began to speed up. Note the inflection point (the point where the curvature of the enclosing\nlines change) that represents this.\n9.3 The Contents of the Universe\nWhen we think of the contents of the universe, what comes to mind is ordinary matter and electromagnetic\nradiation. These are the components that are visualizable. Of course, it is much more complicated than\nthat. There is dark energy responsible for the acceleration of expansion. There are ghostly particles know as\nneutrinos filling the universe, very small amounts of anti-matter, as well as very small amounts of matter\nconsisting of particles made of quarks, but more massive than protons and neutrons. These particles have\nmass and contribute (though negligibly at the present time) to the self-gravity of the universe. There\nis also another kind of dark stuff, one with significant consequences for the universe. It is called dark\nmatter. Dark matter is matter that is inferred to exist from gravitational effects on visible matter, but is\nundetectable by emitted or scattered electromagnetic radiation. Hence, the term dark.\nDark matter was postulated by Fritz Zwicky in 1934 to account for the fact that the galaxies in a cluster\nof galaxies could not have sufficient mass in the form of luminous stars to hold the clusters together.\nThe speeds of the galaxies were simply too great for the gravitational forces to prevent them from flying\noff in all directions, dissolving the clusters. He realized that this additional mass must be many times\ngreater than the mass from luminous matter.\nFor 40 years after Zwicky\u2019s initial observations, there were no corroborating observations indicating\nthe presence of non-luminous matter. Then, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a young astronomer at\nthe Carnegie Institute, Vera Rubin, presented measurements of the star velocities in spiral galaxies. The\nvelocity distribution of the stars, as distance increased from the centers of the galaxies, implied that the\nmass of the galaxies, rather than being concentrated in the center of the galaxies where most of the stars\nare located, was more uniformly distributed throughout the galaxies. Furthermore, these velocities were\nfar too great for the galaxies to hold together due to the self-gravity of its stars. Whereas Zwicky used\nthe term \u2018missing mass\u2019 for this non-luminous matter, Rubin preferred \u2018dark matter.\u2019\nDark matter is not to be confused with dark energy. They are completely different. The most obvious\ndifference is that dark energy is repulsive while dark matter is acted on by the attractive force of gravity.\nThe exact nature of the dark matter is not known at the present time, but several possibilities have\nbeen suggested.\n100\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Modern Cosmology\nAt first, theories focused on non-luminous objects made of ordinary matter (protons, neutrons, and\nelectrons) such as neutron stars, brown dwarfs (low mass star-like objects), black holes, and/or faint white\ndwarfs. These objects were generally referred to as \u2018massive compact halo objects, or MACHOs. These\nobjects exist, but it is now clear that they constitute only a very small fraction of the dark matter. Ironically,\none of the leading contenders for dark matter is \u2018weakly interacting massive particles\u2019 or WIMPs. They\nare hypothetical particles predicted by theory, but not yet observed. The fact that the charge on these\nparticles is zero would explain why they neither emit nor absorb electromagnetic radiation. The true\nnature of dark matter is one of the most important questions in astronomy today.\nPrior to WMAP, we knew the categories of the contents of the universe, but did not know precisely the\npercentages of each. The WMAP data provided this, both as they exist at the present and as they existed\nat the time the cosmic background radiation was released.\nFigure 9.6 Contents of the Universe\nMore precisely, atoms constitute 4.56 \u00b1 0.16 percent, dark mater 22.7 \u00b1 1.4 percent, and dark energy\n72.8 \u00b1 0.5 percent, of the energy density of the universe. As expected, only matter and dark energy\ncontribute significantly to the energy content at the present time. Also as expected, the dark matter\ncontributes much more than the ordinary matter of protons, neutrons, and electrons.\n101\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Modern Cosmology\nShortly after the Big Bang, dark energy made essentially no contribution, as can be seen in the earlier\nplot \u2018The Energy Density of the Universe Over Time.\u2019 Since decoupling occurred after the radiation-\ndominated era, the contribution of dark matter and atoms is greater than that of photons. Neutrinos,\nthough their contribution is insignificant today, were sufficiently dense then to account for 10% of the\nenergy of the universe. The following figure is an alternative representation of the present energy density\npointing out that most of the ordinary matter in the universe is in the form of free hydrogen and helium,\nwith most of the rest in the form of stars.\n9.4 The Geometry of the Universe\nOne of the most profound insights of the General Theory of Relativity was the conclusion that the effect\nof gravitation could be reduced to a statement about the geometry of spacetime. In particular, Einstein\nshowed that mass caused space to curve, and objects travelling in that curved space have their paths\ndeflected, exactly as if a force had acted on them. This result eliminated the troublesome concept of\ngravity as an action-at-a-distance.\nIn the General Theory of Relativity, space and space-time are not rigid arenas in which events take place.\nThey have form and structure which are influenced by the matter and energy content of the universe.\nMatter and energy determine the curvature of space (and space-time). The curvature of space tells matter\nhow to move. In particular, small objects travel along the straightest possible paths in the curved space\n(space-time).\n102\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Modern Cosmology\nIn curved space the rules of Euclidean geometry don\u2019t hold. Parallel lines can meet, and the sum of the\nangles in a triangle can be more, or less than 180 degrees, depending on how space is curved. In the\nGeneral Theory of Relativity, there are three possibilities for the curvature of the universe: zero, positive,\nand negative. As we saw in discussing the balloon model, we cannot visualize curved three dimensional\nspace, so we will again imagine a two dimensional space. Flat is like the surface of a flat piece of paper,\npositive curvature is like the surface of a sphere, and negative curvature is like a saddle, or to use a more\nup-to-day example, like a Pringle potato chip. One property of the curvature is the effect of the space\non extended, locally parallel lines. In flat space, they remain parallel, in positively curved space, they\nconverge, and in negatively curved space, they diverge.\nCurvature of a 2-D Surface\nFigure 9.7 Curvature of a 2-D Surface\nIt is the energy density of the universe that determines whether the global curvature of space is flat,\npositive, or negative. The density that would make the universe flat is called the critical density. If the\ndensity is greater than the critical density, the curvature is positive, and the effect of gravity is sufficient\nto eventually halt the expansion and result in contraction. Such a universe is called a closed universe. If\nthe density is less than the critical density, the curvature is negative, and gravity will not be strong enough\nto stop the expansion and the universe will expand forever. Such a universe is called an open universe.\n103\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Modern Cosmology\nThe curvature of the universe is a constant property. If it started out open or closed, it will remain open or\nclosed forever. Thus if we knew the geometry at any time in the history of the universe, we know the fate\nof the universe. It turns out that the properties of the cosmic background radiation depend on geometry\nand thus provides a test for the geometry of our universe. It has been clear for quite awhile that we do\nnot live in a closed universe. The only question being whether our universe was flat or open. Prior to the\ndiscovery of dark energy, the evidence very strongly favored an open universe. Well before the WMAP\ndata was available, theoretical considerations made it clear that measurements of the fluxuations in the\ntemperature (and hence in the density of matter) at the time of the formation of the cosmic background\nradiation would determine whether we live in an open or a flat universe.\nIn the following figure, the red line represents the theoretical distribution of fluxuations in a flat universe,\nwhile the blue line represents those in an open universe.\nAngular size expected in temperature\nfluxuations of background radiation\nFigure 9.8 Angular size of temperature fluxuations\n104\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Modern Cosmology\nWMAP analysis\nThis graph shows how\ncommonly irregularities\nof different sizes occur\nin the cosmic background\nradiation. Irregularities of\nabout one degree in\ndiameter are most common.\nThe data fit a flat model of\nthe universe very well.\nFigure 9.9 WMAP analysis\n105\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Modern Cosmology\nThe density fluxuations were produced by sound waves traveling through the matter. (Sound waves are\nsimply oscillating densities in some medium, whether it is air on earth or the matter of the universe\nitself.) The frequency of the sound waves and their harmonics is a function of, and therefore a measure\nor, the density of the matter. Thus by measuring the patterns of the temperature fluxuations, the angular\nsize of the fluxuations, we are in effect measuring the density of the universe at the time of the formation\nof the cosmic background radiation. Calculations predict that in a flat universe the largest fluxuations\nwill have an angular size of about one degree, while in a closed universe, it would be about 1.5 degrees\nand in an open universe, about 0.5 degrees. Compare the figure below with the earlier whole sky image\nobtained by WMAP. The image strongly favors a flat universe.\nFigure 9.10 Geometry of the Universe\nThis result is important for a number of reasons. Back in the early 1980s when the inflationary model of\nthe universe was first proposed, it was generally thought that we lived in an open universe. The estimated\ndensity of our universe was not even close to the critical density. Yet in order for the inflationary model\nto be correct, the universe had to be at least very close to flat. It now seems quite clear that the universe\nis flat. Remember that confirmation of a prediction in science is not proof of the theory, but it does\nconstituted strong evidence in its favor.\nMore recent data on the cosmic background radiation have been obtained by the Planck probe launched\nby the European Space Agency. The Planck data confirm the WMAP results and its greater resolution\nreduces the uncertainty of some of the cosmological parameters.\n106\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Modern Cosmology\n9.5 Cosmological Models\nThe model that best explains the known data on the nature of our universe is the Lamda-Cold Dark\nMatter (\u039bCDM) model. The lamda is the cosmological constant indicating the existence a repulsive force\n(dark energy) in the universe. There was initially some discussion on whether the dark matter in the\nearly universe moved at speeds close to the speed of light (hot dark matter) or at non relativistic speeds\n(cold dark matter). The WMAP results are inconsistent with the hot dark matter hypothesis.\nThe \u039bCDM model includes the following features:\n\u2022 It assumes the cosmological principle that our observational location in the universe is in no\nway unusual or special; on a large enough scale, the universe looks the same in all directions\n(isotropy) and from every location (homogeneity).\n\u2022 It assumes that the correct interpretation of Hubble\u2019s Law is that space is expanding.\n\u2022 It assumes a flat spatial geometry.\n\u2022 It assumes that the particles of dark matter had non-relativistic velocities (far below the speed\nof light) and consist of matter other than protons and neutrons, to be uncharged, thus not\ninteracting with electromagnetic radiation, and to interact with each other and other particles\nonly through gravity.\n\u2022 The model includes a single originating event, the \u201cBig Bang\u201d or initial singularity, which was\nnot an explosion but the abrupt appearance of expanding space-time.\nThe \u201cBig Bang\u201d scenario, with cosmic inflation and standard particle physics, is the only current\ncosmological model consistent with the observed continuing expansion of space, the observed distribution\nof matter, the observed abundances of lighter elements and their isotopes in the universe, and the spatial\ntexture of minute irregularities (anisotropies) in the cosmic background radiation. Cosmic inflation is\nnecessary to address certain problems that cannot be explained by the Big Bang model alone, such as why\nthe cosmic background radiation is independent of direction in space. That is to say, radiation coming\nfrom opposite directions in space is identical. Without inflation, these regions could never have been\nin causal contact with one another and, therefore, could not have been in thermodynamic equilibrium\nas the observations require.\n107\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Stellar Evolution\n10 Stellar Evolution\nYour goals for this chapter are to know the following:\n\u2022 List the important properties of the sun along with the range of these properties in other stars.\n\u2022 Describe the conditions at the center of the sun in terms of temperature, chemical composition,\nand state of ionization.\n\u2022 Define the following terms: hydrogen fusion, iron core, supernova.\n\u2022 Discuss the evolution of a 1-solar-mass star from birth to death.\n\u2022 What is the most significant way in which the evolution of a high-mass star differs from a\nlow-mass star?\nWe see the process of birth, ageing, and death at work in everything living. However, until recently, we\nviewed this drama as unfolding against an unchanging backdrop. The stars were seen as an immutable\nconstant. Now we know that they too, in a very real sense, are mere mortals. Within our galaxy, stars\nare constantly born, live out their lifetimes, and die.\n108\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Stellar Evolution\nOur galaxy and others are collections of stars of all ages. The birth\nand death of stars is an ongoing process. Stars are formed by the\ngravitational collapse of interstellar gas and dust.\nFigure 10.1 Galaxy\n10.1 The Birth of a Star\nWhen the first stars and galaxies formed some 13 or so billion years ago, not all of the available primordial\nhydrogen and helium was used up in the process of star formation. In galaxies such as ours, vast clouds\nof gas remained in the disk as interstellar matter. These first-generation stars evolved producing in\ntheir cores nuclei of elements heavier than helium. In their explosive deaths, these, along with even\nmore massive nuclei produced in the explosion itself, were blasted into interstellar space, enriching the\nprimordial hydrogen and helium with heavier elements. This enriched interstellar material is the raw\nmaterials from which later generations of stars have formed.\nStars are simply hot, dense concentrations of interstellar matter. In general, clouds of interstellar matter\ndo not change much in size. They are in hydrostatic equilibrium, meaning that their tendency to contract\ndue to gravity is balanced by their tendency to expand due to temperature and turbulence. Star formation\nbegins when this balance is disrupted and gravity gets the upper hand. Observational and theoretical\nconsiderations suggest several different mechanisms that might cause this.\n109\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Stellar Evolution\nInterstellar Matter\nChemical nature: mostly hydrogen, most of the\n\u2022\nrest is helium, and some heavier elements.\nPhysical nature: mostly gas, some solid particles.\n\u2022\nOrigin: hydrogen and helium from the Big Bang,\n\u2022\nthe heavier elements were produced in the cores\nof massive stars and ejected into interstellar space\nby supernova explosions.\nFigure 10.2 Interstellar Matter\nThe gravitational collapse of a cloud of gas and dust has two important consequences. First, while the cloud\nwas still large, its rotational motion was not obvious. However, as the cloud collapses, it spins faster and\nfaster, much as skaters spin faster and faster when they pull in their arms. The physical explanation for\nthis is conservation of angular momentum. As the rotating mass becomes more and more compressed, its\nrotation speed increases, keeping the angular momentum constant. The rapid rotation has very important\nconsequences for the formation of planets, which we will discuss in a later chapter on the solar system.\nA second consequence of gravitational collapse is that the particles of the cloud speed up and collide\nmore frequently as they fall inward. Temperature is simply a measure of the average kinetic energy\n(energy of motion) of the particles, so the collapse produces an increase in temperature. This effect is\ngreatest at the center of the cloud. As the density of the central region increases, particles collide more\noften and pressure builds up. Eventually the density increases enough to trap electromagnetic radiation.\nThis dramatically slows the collapse of the central region. Meanwhile, material from the rest of the cloud\ncontinues to fall toward the center, increasing still further its temperature, density, and pressure.\nThe central region is now a protostar. Although, as the name implies, a protostar is not quite a star, it\nhas many star properties. It has a visible surface with a temperature of several thousand kelvins. If you\ncould see this object, it would look like a large red star. Because of the high internal temperature of the\nprotostar, the atoms collide violently enough to knock the electrons out of their orbits producing a state\nof ionized matter known as a plasma.\n110\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Stellar Evolution\nAs the protostar continues to contract gravitationally, the core temperature continues to increase. When\nthe internal temperature becomes high enough to initiate thermonuclear reactions converting hydrogen\ninto helium, the protostar becomes a star.\nHubble photo of the star forming region in the Eagle Nebula\nFigure 10.3 Eagle Nebula\n111\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Stellar Evolution\nA Young Cluster of Stars\nThe Jewel Box\nFigure 10.4 The Jewel Box\n10.2 Hydrogen Fusion\nIn many prehistoric and ancient cultures, the sun was thought to be a supernatural phenomenon, usually\npersonified as a god. As we might expect, it was an ancient Greek who, as far as we know, was the first\nto offer a natural explanation. Anaxagoras proposed that the sun was a giant flaming ball of stone rather\nthan the chariot of the god Helios. Prior to the 19th century, speculation about the source of the energy\nthe sun radiated centered on combustion because of the similarity between the sun and fire.\nBy the 19th century, the concept of conservation of energy was beginning to be understood and it was\nrealized that if all of the sun\u2019s mass were in the form of some combustible material such as coal, it would\nburn out in less than 10,000 years. Clearly not enough time. Combustion, or any other chemical reaction,\ncannot be the sun\u2019s energy source. In the mid-1800s, steady gravitational contraction was suggested.\nHowever, this would extend the sun\u2019s life to only a few million years, and soon it was clear even that\nwasn\u2019t long enough.\nThe early part of the 20th century saw the beginning of our understanding of nuclear physics. Nuclear\nreactions often release relatively large quantities of energy, millions of times that released in chemical\nreactions. It was natural, therefore, to suspect that nuclear reactions might be involved in the production\nof stellar energy. In 1928, a specific nuclear reaction was suggested \u2013 the conversion of hydrogen nuclei\ninto helium.\n112\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Stellar Evolution\nIn order for a nuclear reaction to occur, nuclei must come close enough to one another for the\nstrong nuclear force to pull them together. They must almost bump into one another. However, the\nprotons (hydrogen nuclei) that initiate the fusion reaction repel each due to their positive charge (the\nelectromagnetic force). To overcome this repulsion sufficiently to allow them to touch, they must be\nmoving very fast, i.e. the temperature must be very high. The minimum temperature for any significant\nfraction of the protons to bump into one another is 10 million K. If the protostar has sufficient mass to\ndevelop this temperature in its core, a star is born. From this point until it exhausts the core hydrogen,\nthe star is called a main-sequence star. Our sun is a main-sequence star.\nIf two protons collide, the strong nuclear force will bind them together temporarily. However, the very\nstrong repulsive force that the two positive charges in such close proximity exert on each other is sufficient\nto break the bond that the strong nuclear force has established between them, bringing the fusion\nreaction to a halt. The only thing that can prevent this is for one of the protons to be transformed into a\nneutron by a beta positive nuclear reaction. This is an extremely unlikely reaction, and combined with\nthe small fraction of a second the two protons are in contact, makes this reaction is very improbable.\nThat\u2019s good, however. The improbability of the reaction allows stars to slowly consume their hydrogen\nfuel. Otherwise our sun would not have been the constant source of life-sustaining energy that it has\nbeen for the last 4.6 billion years.\nHydrogen Fusion\nIn order for hydrogen fusion to begin, one of the two\ncolliding protons must decay into a neutron with the\nemission of a positron (anti-electron) and a neutrino.\nFigure 10.5 Hydrogen Fusion\n113\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Stellar Evolution\nHydrogen Fusion\nThe net effect of the\nhydrogen fusion reaction is\nthe conversion of four\nprotons into a helium\nnucleus, two positrons, and\ntwo neutrinos. Because four\nprotons have slightly more\nmass than the helium, the\npositrons, and neutrinos,\nsome mass is converted into\nenergy, which then works its\nway to the surface of the star\nand is radiated away.\nFigure 10.6 Hydrogen fusion reaction\n114\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Stellar Evolution\nIf the beta positive reaction does occur, the resulting nucleus contains one proton and one neutron. This\nis a form of hydrogen known as deuterium, or heavy hydrogen. After the bottleneck of the beta decay\nhas passed, the remainder of the reaction goes quickly. First another proton is added making helium\nwith two protons and one neutron, known as helium-3 (for the three nucleons in the nucleus). The final\nstep in the hydrogen fusion chain is when two helium-3 nuclei combine to form helium-4 (two protons\nand two neutrons), releasing two protons in the process. Overall, 4 protons have ceased to exist, and\nin their place is a helium-4 nucleus, two positrons, two neutrinos, and energy. Using nuclear notation,\nthis reaction is written:\n4(1 H) (cid:198) 4 He + 2(0 e) + 2(0 (cid:81)) + energy\n1 2 +1 0\nThe positrons are represented by the symbol \u2018e\u2019 with the zero superscript indicating that it is not a nuclear\nparticle and the +1 indicating a positive charge as opposed to the negative charge on an electron, also\nrepresented by the symbol \u2018e\u2019. The neutrinos are represented by the symbol \u2018\u03bd\u2019, the Greek letter nu with\nthe zeros represented a non-nuclear particle with no charge. The energy comes from the decrease in\nmass associated with the reaction according to Einstein\u2019s equation E = mc2.\nThe mass of a main-sequence star determines its properties. These are usually expressed in units based\non the value of the property for our sun. The subscript \u2018o\u2019 stands for our sun.

With respect to their deaths, stars can be divided into three distinct mass categories: very low mass\n(0.08 to 0.4 solar masses), low mass (0.4 to 9.0 solar masses), and high mass (9.0 to 60 solar masses).\nThe physics of the deaths of very-low-mass stars is complicated. It is also hypothetical in the sense that\ntheir lifetimes exceed the age of the universe. None have ever died, and they won\u2019t be discussed further.\nFor low-mass stars, such as our sun, as the hydrogen in the core is depleted, surface temperature and\nluminosity slowly change. Even though the hydrogen is being depleted, the energy produced by hydrogen\nfusion increases, exerting greater outward pressure, causing the outer regions of the star to expand and\ncool. They eventually become red giants with cores completely depleted of hydrogen, the luminosity\nbeing provided by hydrogen fusion in a shell surround an inert helium core.\nBecause energy is not being generated in the core, gravity contracts it causing the core temperature to\nincrease. Eventually the core temperature becomes sufficient to fuse helium into carbon and some oxygen.\nHigher temperatures are required than is the case for hydrogen fusion because the helium nuclei have\ntwo protons and thus repel each other more strongly than do hydrogen nuclei.\nWhen the helium is depleted, the core will again contract and heat up, but will not reach sufficient\ntemperatures to fuse carbon. Low-mass stars die with carbon and oxygen cores. In the dying process, the\nstar will begin to pulsate, and eventually the outer region will be ejected, leaving the small hot central\nregion behind. This dead star is known as a white dwarf.\nThe Death of a 1 Solar Mass Star\nNear the end of its life\nthe star will develop a\ncarbon and oxygen core.\nThe core will not get\nhot enough to fuse\ncarbon.\nThe star will pulsate\nunstably and will\neject its outer envelop\nleaving behind a dead\nstar that will become\na white dwarf.\nFigure 10.8 Death of a 1 Solar Mass Star\n116\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Stellar Evolution\nEvolution of a 1 solar mass star\nProtostar-core not hot\nenough for fusion.\nMain sequence -hydrogen\nfuses to helium in the core.\nRed giant - fusion in a shell\nsurrounding the core.

The mass at which this occurs is not known exactly, but is generally\nthought to be about 9 solar masses. Once carbon fusion begins, the star will go through a sequence of\nfuels, contracting, heating, and fusing the next heaviest element left in the core. The star becomes layered\nlike an onion.\n118\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Stellar Evolution\nThe succession of fusions continues until the star develops an iron core. Up to this point, each successive\nfusion reaction has resulted in the liberation of energy. That is, in each reaction, the products of the\nreaction have slightly less mass than the nuclei initiating the reaction, and an amount of energy given\nby E = mc2, where m is the mass lost, is released. This helps to support the star against gravity. However,\niron is the most stable nucleus that can be produced in a star. As a result, when the temperature\nbecomes sufficient for the iron to react, rather than releasing energy, energy is absorbed, producing more\ncontraction and still higher temperatures. The result is a run-away reaction. The higher temperature\ncauses the iron reactions to speed up, absorbing even more energy, and so on.\nThe Death of a 15 Solar Mass Star\nNear the end of its life\nthe star will develop\nand iron core.\nReactions in the iron\ncore will cause the star\nto explode (supernova)\nscattering its contents\ninto interstellar space.\nA dead neutron star\nwill be left behind.\nElements heavier than\niron will be created in\nthe explosion.\nFigure 10.12 Death of a 15 Solar Mass Star\nThe core temperature becomes so high that the nuclei themselves are broken down into individual\nprotons and neutrons absorbing still more energy. At still higher temperatures, electrons and protons\ncombine to produce neutrons and neutrinos, again, an energy absorbing reaction. Because the number of\nprotons and electrons is exactly the same (the core is electrically neutral), the core now consists entirely\nof neutrons with the neutrinos being radiated away from the core. In a fraction of a second, the earth-\nsized iron core is transformed into a neutron core about 10 miles across.\n119\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Stellar Evolution\nThe unsupported outer regions are now free falling toward the neutron core. The implosion is\nconverted into an explosion by a combination of events. The infalling material will hit the surface\nof the incompressible neutron core with speeds approaching the speed of light. Because the core is\nincompressible, the infalling material will bounce back at these same speeds. In addition, the pressure of\nthe neutrinos leaving the core, and the energy generated by fusion in the infalling material, add energy\nto the explosion. The resulting powerful explosion is called a supernova. The energy of the explosion\nproduces elements more massive than iron, all the way up to uranium and beyond. The supernova blasts\nthis debris into interstellar space, enriching the interstellar material with heavier elements.\nThe supernova may leave behind the neutron core, in which case it becomes a neutron star. If the initial\nvalue of the star\u2019s mass is high enough (we do not currently know the value of the mass required) the\nneutron core will be more massive than neutron pressure can support, and the result will be complete\ngravitational collapse. This state of matter is known as a black hole.\nThe Crab Nubula -the\nexplosive death of a high\nmass star; a supernova.\nThe Crab supernova was\nobserved on earth in 1054.\nToday it is a rapidly\nexpanding cloud of gas\nand dust with a pulsar\n(a rapidly rotating neutron\nstar) at its center.\nThe material in the cloud\nis rich in elements heavier\nthan helium.\nFigure 10.13 Crab Nebula\n120\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Stellar Evolution\nIn 1967, Jocelyn Bell, then a graduate student, observed strong radio pulses coming from space. Initially\nshe and her thesis advisor, Anthony Hewish, were baffled by the seemingly unnatural regularity of the\nemissions. Although they never took it too seriously, they dubbed the discovery LGM-1, for \u201clittle green\nmen\u201d (a common name at the time for intelligent beings of extraterrestrial origin). Soon other LGMs\nwere discovered, and the name was changed to pulsars (a contraction of pulsating star). In 1968, Thomas\nGold suggested that pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron stars emitting radiation from their magnetic\npoles. Because the axis of rotation differs from the axis of the magnetic field, pulsars act as a lighthouse,\nproducing a pulse of radiation when the beam rotates past the earth. The frequency of these pulses\nis determined by the rotational period of the neutron star. Pulsar periods range from milliseconds to\nseveral seconds.\nFor our story \u201cFrom Chaos to Consciousness,\u201d the most significant result of stellar evolution is that the\nlife and death of high mass stars is the only way in which elements more massive than helium can be\nproduced in the universe, elements such as carbon, oxygen and all the other familiar elements that make\nup our planet and our bodies. When Carl Sagan said \u201cWe are stardust,\u201d he is speaking quite literally.\n121\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Formation of the Earth\n11 The Formation of the Earth\nYour goals for this chapter are to know the following:\n\u2022 Outline the principle features of the nebular hypothesis for the formation of the solar system,\nincluding the two additions to this hypothesis made in the twentieth century.\n\u2022 Compare and contrast the present earth with the earth just after it formed and identify the\nspecific geological processes that produced these differences.\n\u2022 How is the age of the earth determined?\n\u2022 Explain the concept of plate tectonics.\n11.1 The Solar System\nThose bodies caught securely in the gravitational grasp of our star make up the solar system. They\nconstitute our neighborhood, the only immediately accessible portion of the universe. We are in an age\nof exploration of the solar system, a time when previously inconceivable facts about our sister planets\nand their moons are found with each new space probe. Moreover it is now clear that the process that\nled to our solar system has been at work in the formation of other stars and they too have planetary\nsystems of their own.\nJust as the name implies, the largest and most massive body in the solar system is the sun. The sun\ndominates our existence. We have evolved sleep and waking patterns in accord with the sun\u2019s appearance\nand disappearance. Our calendars chronicle the seasonal relationship between the earth and the sun.\nIn fact, our very survival depends on constant nourishment by the sun. Our mythologies, our folklore,\nand our pseudo-sciences all reflect our innate intuition that our lives are inextricably bound up with\nthe solar system.\nThe bodies that make up the solar system are the sun, planets, dwarf planets, comets, moons, asteroids,\nand meteoroids. Approximately 99.9% of the mass of the solar system resides in the sun. Most of the\nremainder is in the form of planets. Because of the large mass of the sun, it dominates the motion of all\nthe other objects in the solar system.\nThe planets and most of the remaining matter are distributed in a plane. As seen from a vantage point\nfar north of the solar system, the sun rotates counterclockwise about its axis. The planets and asteroids lie\nnearly in the sun\u2019s equatorial plane and revolve counterclockwise around the sun in elliptical, but nearly\ncircular, orbits. With the exceptions of Venus and Uranus, the planets spin counterclockwise, and moons\norbit their planets in the same way. Comets are distinct in the solar system with respect to their orbits\naround the sun. Rather than all lying in the same flat plane, they are spherically distributed. They also\nhave highly elliptical orbits and are just as likely to have clockwise as counterclockwise orbits. Comets\nare to the solar system as halo stars are to the Milky Way Galaxy.\n122\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Formation of the Earth\nIn addition to these regularities of motion, there are certain regularities of chemical distribution within\nthe solar system. Solar system material generally falls into one of three broad categories, gases, volatiles,\nor rocky-metallic materials. The gases are mostly hydrogen and helium. Volatiles include water, methane,\nammonia, and carbon dioxide. The solid forms of volatiles are called ices. Rocky-metallic materials are\nprimarily compounds of iron and silicon.\nThese materials are not randomly distributed within the solar system. The innermost planets and moons\nare almost entirely rocky-metallic in composition. The asteroids are rocky-metallic, with the outermost\nones containing significant fractions of icy material. In addition to rocky-metallic and icy material, the\nplanets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune contain huge quantities of gas. In fact, Jupiter and Saturn,\nlike the sun, are mostly hydrogen and helium. The dwarf planets and moons of the outer solar system\nare rocky-metallic and icy in composition.\nThe Solar System\nFigure 11.1 The Solar System\n123\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Formation of the Earth\n11.2 The Origin of the Solar System\nThe first scientific theory of the origin of the solar system was that of the French philosopher Rene\nDescartes. In 1644 he proposed that space was initially filled with swirling gas in which large whirlpools\nevolved into stars while the planets and their satellites formed from much smaller vortices. The German\nphilosopher Immanuel Kant applied Newton\u2019s laws to Descartes\u2019 model in 1755 and concluded that the\nswirling gas would assume a disk shape. The French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace independently\nproposed a similar theory in 1796. Known as the nebular hypothesis, the gravitational collapse of an\ninterstellar cloud accounted for the flattened appearance of the solar system, the nearly circular orbits\nof the planets, and the fact that the planets moved along their orbits and rotated about their axes in the\nsame direction that the sun rotated.\nBy the end or the 19th century, it had become clear that there were two serious problems with the nebular\nhypothesis. First, the planets and moons contained insufficient mass to have formed from gravitational\ncollapse. Secondly, the gravitational collapse of a cloud of gas and dust should result in a sun that rotated\nmuch more rapidly than our sun does. By the latter half of the 20th century, both these problems had\nbeen resolved.\n124\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Formation of the Earth\nWe now understand that the formation of the planets and moons began not with gravitational collapse\nbut with the sticking together of small, solid grains in the solar nebula. This process is called accretion\nand is exemplified by a snowball rolling down a snow bank and gaining mass as it does. Accretion also\nexplains why dust sometimes concentrates in dust bunnies. Only after the bodies have gained sufficient\nmass does gravity play a part in the final formation. The problem with the sun\u2019s rotation was resolved\nwhen it was discovered that the sun constantly emits high speed charged particles. These are known\nas the solar wind. As the solar wind leaves the sun, it passes through the sun\u2019s magnetic field, and the\nparticles are deflected by the magnetic force. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction\n(Newton\u2019s third law of motion), and therefore, the force the sun exerts on the solar wind is accompanied\nby a force the solar wind exerts on the sun. This reaction force slows down the sun\u2019s rotation. In this\nway, over the history of the solar system, magnetic braking has slowed the sun\u2019s rotational period from\nits original value of less than ten hours to its present value of about 25 days.\nIn the process of star formation, the gravitational contraction of the interstellar cloud increases the\ntemperature of the cloud and causes it to spins faster and faster. Both of these results played an important\nrole in the formation of our solar system. As the contracting solar nebula spins faster and faster it begins\nto flattens out. The rotation caused some of the material to go into orbit around the central object, (which\nwill eventually become our sun). The temperature increase is greatest in the center of the cloud and\ndecreases with distance from the center. The center heats to temperatures sufficient for hydrogen fusion\nwhile the outer regions are not much hotter than the original interstellar cloud.\nThe temperature of the central object and the region immediately surrounding it is sufficient to evaporate\nall of the solid grains from the original interstellar cloud. Out somewhat further, the temperature is\nsufficient to evaporate the icy grains, but not the rocky-metallic grains. Still further, past the frost line,\nboth rocky-metallic and icy grains can exist.\n125\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Formation of the Earth\nSolid Grains in the Solar Nebula\nRocky metallic grains Temperatures are cold\nexist but temperatures enough for rocky-\nare too high for ices. metallic and icy grains.\nFigure 11.2 The Solar Nebula\nAccretion will therefore produce rocky-metallic objects in the inner part of the solar system and rocky-\nmetallic-icy objects in the outer part. Accretion in the inner part of the solar system produced Mercury,\nVenus, Earth, Mars, and, soon afterwards, our moon. Four of the rocky-metallic-icy objects in the outer\npart, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, had sufficient mass to gravitational capture the gas in their\nvicinity and are therefore composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. The moons of the four gas planets\nand the dwarf planets lying beyond them did not have sufficient mass to capture the hydrogen and\nhelium and are rocky-metallic-icy objects.\nThe nebular hypothesis clearly predicts that stars other than our sun should have planets in orbit about\nthem. This prediction was made well before any planet outside our solar system had been observed.\nThe first extra-solar planet was discovered in 1988. Since then, well over 500 have been discovered with\nnew ones being continuously added. Current data estimates that there are at least 50 billion planets in\nour galaxy. A small, but non-negligible, fraction of these have masses similar to earth and occupy the\nhabitable zone (temperatures that allow for liquid water) of their planetary system. For this reason, many\nbelieve that life is common in our galaxy.\n126\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Formation of the Earth\n11.3 The Age of the Solar System\nHumans have speculated on the age of the earth for thousands of years. The Brahmins of India believed\nthat the Earth was eternal, as did Aristotle. In early Judeo-Christian cultures, estimates of the age of the\nsolar system were based on the Bible. The traditional Jewish calendar starts from 3760 BCE, which is taken\nto be a date for the creation of the earth. In 1650, Anglican bishop James Ussher used the Jewish Bible to\ncalculate that creation took place on the evening of Sunday, October 23, 4004 BCE of the Julian calendar.\nBy the 18th century, naturalist had begun to seriously doubt Ussher\u2019s value. One of the first estimates\nbased on natural processes was made by George-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1774. He estimated\nthat the time it would take for a molten earth to cool would be about 75,000 years.\nBy the end of the 18th century, James Hutton, the founder of modern geology, introduced the concept\nof \u2018deep time,\u2019 pushing the estimate to millions of years. His student and fellow geologist, Charles Lyell,\nfriend and confidant of Charles Darwin, popularized the concept that geological layers were in perpetual\nchange, eroding and reforming continuously at a roughly constant rate. (Darwin read Lyell\u2019s landmark\ntext, Principles of Geology, while on the Beagle, and was much influenced by it.) Lyell\u2019s \u2018uniformitarian\u2019\nchallenged the traditional view that the geological history of the earth was essentially static, with changes\nbrought about by intermittent catastrophes or supernatural interventions such as Noah\u2019s flood. Lyell\nestimated the age of the earth in hundreds of millions of years.\n127\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Formation of the Earth\nRadioactivity was discovered in 1895 and, because of the constant rate associated with the decay of a\nparticular radioactive substance, was soon recognized as a technique for dating rocks. For example,\nuranium decays through a sequence of reactions to lead. Because the chemical properties of uranium\nand lead are different, these two elements would not be found mixed together in a rock that has just\nformed, say from solidified material from a volcanic eruption. As the rock ages, uranium atoms are\ngradually transformed to lead atoms, with the lead homogeneously mixed with the uranium. Knowing\nthe rate at which this occurs, the relative proportions of uranium and lead is a direct measure of the time\nsince the rock formed. Because on our geologically active earth, rocks are constantly being recycled, the\nages of rocks vary, but by 1907 the age of some earth rocks had been measured in the billions of years.\nAncient rocks exceeding 3.5 billion years in age are found on all of Earth\u2019s continents. The oldest rocks\non Earth found so far are in northwestern Canada and are dated at just over four billion years. Some\nrocks in western Greenland are 3.7 to 3.8 billion years old. These ancient rocks have been dated by a\nnumber of radiometric dating methods and the consistency of the results give scientists confidence that\nthe ages are correct to within a few percent.\nThe moon is less active than the earth and some of its rocks are older than any found on earth. A small\nnumber of rocks have been returned to earth by lunar missions. The oldest of these rocks formed between\n4.4 and 4.5 billion years ago, providing a minimum age for the formation of the solar system. Meteorites\nare fragments of asteroids that fall to earth. The oldest of these formed between 4.53 and 4.58 billion years\nago. Because their structure indicates that they have never been melted, we take their age to be the time\nat which the first solar system solid objects formed. Thus our solar system is about 4.6 billion years old.\nAnother way to determine the age of the solar system is to use stellar computer models to determine\nhow long it would take a star with the mass and chemical composition of our sun to reach its current\nvalue of luminosity and surface temperature. Although this method is not as accurate as radiometric\ndating, it too gives and age of somewhat less than 5 billion years for the age of the sun, consistent with\nthe value determined from radiometric dating.\n11.4 The Geological Evolution of the Earth\nEarth formed by the accretion of rocky-metallic grains in the solar nebula. In its final stages of formation,\naided by gravity, most of the remaining debris in its zone was swept up depositing a tremendous amount\nof energy on the earth\u2019s surface. At the same time, radioactive elements were decaying throughout the\nplanet, releasing energy that, like the energy from accretion, was converted into heat. The heat could not\nbe radiated away fast enough and temperatures rose above the melting points of the various materials.\n128\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Formation of the Earth\nDuring this molten stage, the denser metallic materials settled toward the center and the lighter, rocky\nmaterials floated toward the top. This process is known as chemical differentiation. An iron-nickel core\nformed, surrounded by the mantle, a layer of rocky material. The mantle extends almost to the earth\u2019s\nsurface. The top layer of the earth is the crust, composed of rocks that are generally less dense than\nthe mantle. The crust is several miles thick under the oceans and some twenty or so miles thick under\nthe continents.\nWhen the bombardment diminished, the surface of the earth solidified. Though diminished, bombardment\ncontinued leaving the surface covered with impact craters, much as parts of the moon and Mercury are\ntoday. At this time, the earth had no oceans and no significant atmosphere.\nThe early earth would have been unrecognizable as our future home. The processes by which this\ntransformation occurred are known as geological evolution. Geological evolution is primarily driven by\nthe heat produced by radioactive decay. The heat produced not only led to chemical differentiation, it\ncontributed to the formation of our oceans and atmosphere and the elimination of craters.\nGeological evolution of the earth\nOceans, atmosphere\nNo oceans, no atmosphere,\n78% N , 21% O , 1% Ar,\n2 2\nheavily cratered\nalmost no craters\nRocky-\nmetallic\nHomogeneous chemical Chemically differentiated\ndistribution Iron core, rocky mantle\nFigure 11.3 Geological evolution\n129\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Formation of the Earth\nRadioactivity decreases exponentially with time. As a result, the earth has begun to cool. Material that\nwas once liquid has now re-solidified. The iron-nickel core is solid in its center with a surrounding liquid\nshell. It is this liquid iron and the rotation of the earth that produces the earth\u2019s magnetic field. The radius\nof the iron-nickel core extends to about half the earth\u2019s radius. The mantle, for the most part, is not\nmolten. But it is not exactly solid either. It behaves somewhat like a plastic and can flow under pressure.\nLiquid rock, lava, occasionally breaks through the crust, releasing into the atmosphere gasses previously\ntrapped in the rock. This is called \u2018outgassing\u2019. The two most abundantly gasses outgassed are water\n(steam) and carbon dioxide. At our distance from the sun, the surface temperature is such that the steam\ncondenses to a liquid and falls back to earth as rain. This is in part how the oceans formed.\nCarbon dioxide is soluble in water (soda water is an example) and dissolves into the oceans, later to\nprecipitate out as carbonate rock such as limestone. With the two principle outgassed substances removed,\nthe third most abundant, nitrogen, constituted almost all of the early atmosphere. Life evolved on earth\nand some forms were able to photosynthesize water and carbon dioxide into food (carbohydrates) with\noxygen as a byproduct. Gradually the oxygen began to accumulate and today makes up about 21% of\nour atmosphere.\nThe third most abundant component of the present atmosphere is argon. The source of the argon is the\nradioactive decay of potassium mentioned back in Chapter 5. The argon is also released in outgassing.\n130\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Formation of the Earth\nOur oceans were formed in part by outgassing, but this could not have been the only source. There is too\nmuch water on earth to be accounted for by outgassing. A likely alternative source of water is comets.\nComets are dirty ice balls, about 80% ice and 20% rocky-metallic materials. Early in the history of the\nsolar system, they were found much more frequently in the inner regions than they are today. It is now\nwell accepted that comet bombardment accounts for some fraction of the earth\u2019s oceans, thought the\nprecise value of that fraction is unknown.\nSolar system objects like Mercury, our moon and some of the moons in the outer region of the system\nare heavily cratered, the remnants of the impacts during the final stages of their formation. The earth is\nnot. It might seem logical to assume that this is due to the fact that, unlike the other bodies, the earth\nhas an atmosphere and oceans. Perhaps, weathering has worn down the craters so that they are no longer\nvisible today. This is not the case. The craters have been removed by plate tectonics, another evolutionary\nmechanism produced by the heat of radioactive decay.\nIt you look at the globe, the continents of Africa and South America seem to fit together like two pieces of\na jigsaw puzzle. The continental shelves of these continents are an even better fit. Early in the 20th century,\nAlfred Wegner, a German meteorologist, became intrigued by this. He was struck by the similarities\nin the geological formations and the fossil records at the edges of these widely separated continents.\nWegener, noted that the locations of certain fossil plants and animals on present-day, widely separated\ncontinents would form definite patterns (shown by the bands of color in the following figure), if the\ncontinents are rejoined. He proposed the theory of continental drift, hypothesizing that at one time in\nthe past the continents were connected and have since drifted apart.\nWegner\u2019s idea was initially ridiculed by the scientific community. No one could conceive of a mechanism\nwhereby entire continents could be caused to move across the face of the earth. However, as the ocean\nfloors began to be studied in more detail in the late 1950s and early 1960s, scoffers became supporters.\nGeophysicists developed a theory known as plate tectonics, based on the plastic properties of the upper\nmantle to explain continental drift. The evidence in favor of the theory soon became overwhelming.\n131\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Formation of the Earth\nFigure 11.4 Fossil distribution\nOn the ocean floor, about halfway between Europe and Africa to the east and North and South America\nto the west, is the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Dating of rocks at the ridge shows them to be very young. As\nyou move out from the ridge in either direction, the rocks are progressively older. It is clear that the\ncontinents of Europe and Africa are moving apart from North and South America. The speed at which\nthey are moving apart has been measured by satellite observations to be about an inch or so a year. In\nother parts of the globe, the continents are moving together and, in still other parts, moving anti-parallel\nto one another, all at similar speeds. If we extrapolate the motions of the continents backwards in time,\nwe find that about 200 million years ago all of the continents were together. This single land mass is\ncalled \u2018Pangaea.\u2019\nThe continents rest on huge plates that are being driven across the earth\u2019s surface by convection currents\nin the upper mantle beneath them. Where the plates collide, one of the plates is driven under the other\nand forced down into the mantle and melted. The other plate is driven upward forming mountain ranges.\nAt the boundary where two plates move apart, molten material rises up forming new rocks. In this way\nthe crust of the earth is continuously being destroyed and reformed. Although there are some rocks as old\nas four billion years, most are much younger. The craters formed in the very early history of the earth no\nlonger exist because the ground they formed on no longer exists. It has been recycledby plate tectonics\n132\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe The Formation of the Earth\nThe boundaries of the plates are regions of extreme geological activity: volcanoes and earthquakes. As\ncan be seen on the map, Japan is on the boundary of two plates. Another consequent of plate tectonics\nis that India, which was once an island, has collided with the underside of Asia forming the Himalayan\nMountains. The Mediterranean Sea is gradually being squeezed closed. Los Angles, parts of southern\nCalifornia, and the Baja peninsula, are located on the Pacific plate and are slowly moving north with\nrespect to the North American plate, on which the rest of California is located. The boundary is known\nas the \u2018San Andreas Fault,\u2019 an earthquake prone region of the globe.\nPlate Tectonics\nThe continents are on plates that move across the earth\u2019s\nsurface.

Also, as with history, its continuous\nnature sometimes makes it hard to know exactly when one type of evolution transitions into one of the\nother categories.\n134\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Biological Evolution\nIn the previous chapter, we treated geological evolution. But geological evolution has not been the\nonly evolution transforming the earth throughout its history. Concurrently, chemicals were evolving,\nproducing progressively more complex molecules and microstructures composed of these molecules.\nAlthough the details are not known at the present time, it seems clear that at some point, these structures\nbecame sufficiently complex to self-replicate; that is life arose from non-life, and chemical evolution\nbecame biological evolution.\n12.1 Chemical Evolution\nIn the 1950s \u2018the origin of life\u2019 was a widely discussed scientific topic. It was hypothesized that conditions\non the primitive earth favored chemical reactions that synthesized organic compounds from inorganic\nprecursors. The Miller-Urey experiment, conducted in 1952, simulated conditions thought at the time to\nbe present on the early earth. After allowing the experiment to run for a couple of days, several amino\nacids were identified in the apparatus. Prior to this result, it was generally accepted that only biological\nprocesses could synthesize complex organic molecules.\nThe Miller-Urey Experiment\nThe flasks contain liquid water\n..\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 representing the sea, and gases\nrepresenting the early\n.. atmosphere. The apparatus is\nsupplied with energy in the\n. form of electrical discharges\nwhich simulate lightning.\nChemical reactions produce a\nwide variety of organic\nmolecules, including amino\nacids, the building blocks of\nproteins.\nFigure 12.1 The Miller Urey Experiment\nSince then, similar experiments have been done, including ones with more realistic conditions representing\nthe early earth. These have produced an even larger variety of amino acids, as well as fatty acids (the\nbuilding blocks of lipids) and nucleic acids (the building blocks of RNA and DNA).\n135\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Biological Evolution\nOther experiments have shown that if these building blocks are dried and heated, they link up, forming\nlong chains similar to the most complex biological molecules. These experiments, together with the\ndiscovery of amino acids in meteorites and of complex organic molecules in interstellar space, make it\nclear that chemical evolution is a fundamental part of the nature of the universe.\nIf certain complex organic molecules are put in water, they spontaneously form small, cell-like structures.\nProteins and lipids placed in water, at appropriate values of acidity, salinity, and temperature, form\nmembranes very much like cell membranes. In addition, these will spontaneously close in on themselves\nto produce tiny sacks that exhibit properties normally associated with life. They concentrate organic\nmolecules within their membranes, and they can grow in size and divide in two when they get too large.\nFormation of proto-cells\nLaboratory versions of proto-cells. (a) These microscopic spheres were made\nby cooling a warn-water solution of amino acids. Although they are not alive,\nthey exhibit many lifelike properties. (b) These microscopic membranes are\nmade from lipids that when mixed with wafer spontaneously form enclosed\ndroplets.\nFigure 12.2 Formation of proto-cells\nWe do not know that these specific mechanisms brought about life on earth. The importance of these\nexperiments is not that they tell us exactly how life arose, but that they demonstrate the tendency of\nchemical evolution to produce cell-like structures. We may never know exactly how nature accomplished\nthe transition from chemical to biological evolution, but the experimental evidence that this transition\nrepresents a natural development is compelling.\n136\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Biological Evolution\n12.2 Biological Evolution\nIn biology, evolution is the process by which populations of organisms acquire and pass on novel traits\nfrom generation to generation. Its occurrence over large stretches of time explains the origin of new\nspecies and ultimately the vast diversity of the biological world. Contemporary species are related to each\nother through common descent, products of evolution and speciation over billions of years.\nThe cell is the fundamental structure of life. It is the least complex bit of matter that can undergo all of\nthe processes that distinguish the living from the nonliving. The first forms of life on earth appeared in\nthe oceans. They were simple one-celled organisms know as bacteria. These original life forms arose very\nearly in the history of the earth. Possible microfossils of one-celled organisms have been found in rocks\nof Western Australia and South Africa that formed some 3.5 billion years ago. The earliest unambiguous\nrecords of life are 2.7 billion year old fossils of blue-green algae colonies found in rocks from Canada\nand Zimbabwe.\n137\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Biological Evolution\nEarly life ?\nMicrofossils of ancient living\ncells? This microscopic\nphotograph shows structures\nthat some researchers believe\nto be ancient fossil cells dating\nto 3.5 billion years ago. Other\nresearchers, however, argue\nthat the structures were\nformed by nonbiological\nprocesses.\nFigure 12.3 Early Life\nPhotosynthesis is the chemical reaction that allows plants to use the energy of sunlight to make the\ncomplex molecules that are the food supply of all living things. The raw materials needed are carbon\ndioxide and a source of hydrogen. About 3 billion years ago, organisms evolved that were able to utilize\nwater as the hydrogen source. These organisms combined carbon dioxide (CO ) with water (H O) to\n2 2\nproduce carbohydrates (molecules with a 1:2:1 ratio of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen). Two oxygen\natoms were left over for each water molecule used. The oxygen was simply released into the atmosphere.\nOxygen is a highly reactive element. At first the released oxygen combined with other elements, primarily\niron, at the earth\u2019s surface. (Rust is oxidized iron.) Then, about 2 billion years ago, once most of the\nmaterials at the earth\u2019s surface had been oxidized, oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere. When\nthis process began, the atmosphere was almost 100% nitrogen. Some 600 million years ago, by the start\nof the Cambrian period, oxygen made up about 5% of the atmosphere. Today it is accounts for 21%.\n138\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Biological Evolution\nThe increase of oxygen in the atmosphere had two important consequences. First, organisms developed\nthat could use the oxygen to break down food molecules. This reaction, called respiration, is the reverse\nof photosynthesis, and allows much more energy to be extracted from food molecules than had been\npossible previously. The greater efficiency provided by respiration played a major role in the later\ndiversification of life forms. Secondly, atmospheric oxygen also began to produce a layer of ozone (O )\n3\nin the earth\u2019s upper atmosphere. Prior to the development of the ozone layer, the deadly ultraviolet\nradiation of the sun confined life to the seas in which it had originated. However, ozone is a strong\nabsorber of ultraviolet radiation, particularly in the shorter wavelength region that is so dangerous to\nliving organisms. A growing ozone layer made it progressively safer for life to rise to the surface of the\nwater and eventually to occupy the land.\nEvolution of life on earth\n\u2022 The basic timeline is a 4600 million year old Earth, with\n\u2013 4000 my (million years) of simple cells,\n\u2013 3000 my of photosynthesis,\n\u2013 2000 my of complex cells,\n\u2013 1000 my of multi-cellular life,\n\u2013 600 my of simple animals,\n\u2013 500 my of fish and proto-amphibians,\n\u2013 475 my of land plants,\n\u2013 400 my of insects, seeds and amphibians,\n\u2013 300 my of reptiles,\n\u2013 200 my of mammals,\n\u2013 150 my of birds,\n\u2013 100 my of flowers,\n\u2013 65 my since the non-avian dinosaurs died out\n\u2013 7 my of hominids, and\n\u2013 0.1 my of Homo sapiens.\nFigure 12.4 Evolution of life on earth\nThe Cambrian period, between about 500 and 600 million years ago, was characterized by a great\nproliferation of new species. There were probably many factors that contributed to this explosion of\nlife, but certainly the increase in the oxygen content of the atmosphere was crucial. About 450 million\nyears ago an important milestone in the evolution of humans occurred \u2013 the first backbones took shape\nwhen fish evolved from an invertebrate ancestor. Life made its first appearance on land about 440 million\nyears ago and consisted of simple plants. Spiders, scorpions, and millipedes soon followed. About 370\nmillion years ago, the first amphibians evolved from fish, and emerged from the water to establish the\nevolutionary branch that today included all terrestrial vertebrates, including us.\n139\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Biological Evolution\nReptiles evolved from amphibians about 300 million years ago. They evolved to fill a variety of terrestrial\nniches and soon became the most diversified vertebrate form on land. About 200 million years ago,\na subclass of reptiles developed special secreting glands to nourish their young and became the first\nmammals. The mammals lived in the shadows of the dinosaurs until about 65 million years ago when\nthe giant reptiles became extinct.\nThe extinction of the dinosaurs coincided with the extinction of about 75% of all species alive on earth\nat the time, something known as a mass extinction. It seems that the mass extinction of 65 million years\nago was caused by the impact of a meteorite near the Yucatan peninsula. The meteorite had sufficient\nmass to cause extended, global weather changes. The extinctions may have taken several million years\nto complete, but this is practically overnight by geological timescales. There is strong fossil evidence\nfor many additional mass extinctions, one of which eliminated about 90% of the then-existing species.\nSome of these may also have been caused by meteorite impact.\nMass extinctions\nThis graph shows current data concerning the approximate percentage of plants\nand animals to go extinct with tine over the past 500 million years. Peaks\nrepresent mass extinctions. (The data actually are for genera, a higher level of\nclassification than species.)\nFigure 12.5 Mass extinctions\n12.3 Primates\nAfter the extinction of the dinosaurs, mammals flourished. At about this same time, early primates \u2013\nsmall, forest-dwelling, squirrel-like creatures. \u2013 evolved. Primates are distinguished from other mammals\nby several features, including shoulder joints that allow a high degree of movement in all directions,\nopposable thumbs, and a trend toward a reduced snout and flattened face, attributed to a greater reliance\non vision at the expense of olfaction.\n140\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Biological Evolution\nEarly primate\nThe tree shrew is a\nprimitive primate that\nprobably resembles the\nancestor of all living\nprimates.

The\ncommon ancestor of\nmodern humans,\nchimpanzees and\ngorillas lived between\nabout 5 and 8 million\nyears ago.\nFigure 12.7 Primate evolution\nAbout 40 million years ago, the evolutionary branch that would eventually lead to humans branched and\nthe lines leading to the old world and new world monkeys split off. This branching continued as lines\nleading to today\u2019s gibbons, orangutans, and gorillas split off. Finally, some 5 or so million years ago, the\nline leading to chimpanzees diverged.\nChimpanzees are our closest living relatives. About 96% of our respective genomes are identical, although\nrecent studies have shown that the vast differences between humans and chimpanzees are due more to\nchanges in gene regulation than differences in individual genes themselves. Certain genes control the\nexpression of other genes, so that even identical genes may be expressed differently in different species.\nThus small changes in these regulatory genes can have a substantial impact.\nAfter the lines leading to chimps and humans split, species on the line leading to humans are known as\nhominids. Dozens of hominid fossil species have been identified beginning in 1856 with the discovery\nfossils now known as Homo neanderthalensis. The next chapter will discuss many of these species.\n142\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Human Evolution\n13 Human Evolution\nYour goals for this chapter are to know the following:\n\u2022 List at least five species on the hominid line of descent.\n\u2022 Compare and contrast Australopithecus africanus and Homo erectus.\n\u2022 Compare and contrast Homo erectus and Homo neanderthalensis.\n\u2022 Compare and contrast Homo neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens.\n\u2022 Explain the two theories as to how Homo sapiens came to be the single hominid species on earth.\nIn The Origin of Species, Darwin dealt only with plants and nonhuman animals. He did not directly\naddress the question of human origins, fearing that it would prejudice readers against his general theory.\nThe book\u2019s only mention of human evolution was the prediction that \u201clight will be thrown on the origin\nof man and his history.\u201d The implication that humans descended from ape-like ancestors, however, was\nclear and immediately became the focus of public ridicule and outrage.\nMan is But a Worm,\nfrom the Punch\nAmanack of 1882,\npublished soon after\nDarwin\u2019s last book\nThe Formation of\nVegetable Mould\nthrough the Action\nof Worms.\nFigure 13.1 Darwin cartoon\n143\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Human Evolution\nIn 1860, at the annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Oxford\u2019s\nscholarly Anglican bishop, Samuel Wilberforce, delivered a long speech raising scientific objections to\nDarwin\u2019s theory. The meeting was attended by Thomas Huxley, an outspoken defender of Darwin. Near\nthe end of his talk, Wilberforce jokingly asked Huxley if he was related to apes on his grandfather\u2019s or\ngrandmother\u2019s side. Huxley is said to have whispered as he rose to respond, \u201cThe Lord hath delivered\nhim into mine hands.\u201d\nNo transcript of the meeting exists, but Huxley claimed to have said, \u201cIf then the question is put to me\nwould I rather have a miserable ape for a grandfather or a man highly endowed by nature and possessed\nof great means and influence and yet who employs those faculties for the mere purpose of introducing\nridicule into a grave scientific discussion, I unhesitatingly affirm my preference for the ape.\u201d The exchange\nquickly became legendary.\nDarwin, by nature, was not combative. In the years following the publication of The Origin of Species, he\nsteered clear of the intense public debate on the topic of human evolution, relying on more combative\ndefenders to press the case. Huxley, known as \u2018Darwin\u2019s bulldog,\u2019 was perhaps the best known and most\neffective of these. Finally, in 1871, he addressed the question in a massive two-volume book, The Descent\nof Man.\n144\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Human Evolution\nThis book did not have the impact of The Origin of Species. The arguments were not as compelling, and by\nthen everyone had already made up their mind on the subject. Most rejected the idea that humans were\nsimply the product of natural selection, even many who readily accepted evolution as the explanation for\nthe origins of \u2018the lower forms.\u2019 Among these was Alfred Wallace, the co-founder of evolution through\nnatural selection. (Wallace believed that natural selection was insufficient to explain the development of\nconsciousness and the human mind.) It would take the abundant fossil discoveries of the 20th century\nto provide the evidence that put human evolution on solid scientific ground.\n13.1 Lucy\nPerhaps the most famous fossil relating to human evolution is Lucy. The fossil was discovered in 1974\nin Ethiopia by a team lead by Donald Johanson and is estimated to be about 3.2 million years old. She\ngot her name from the Beatles song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, that played repeatedly at the party\ncelebrating her discovery.\nLucy\nThis remarkably complete 3.2\nmillion year old fossil was\ndiscovered in Ethiopia in the\n1974 and designated\nAustralopithecus afarensis.\nSeveral hundred pieces of bone\nwere recovered, representing\nabout 40% of the skeleton.\nFortunately many bones missing\nfrom one side of the body were\npresent on the other side.\nFigure 13.2 Lucy\nLucy was 3 feet, 8 inches tall and weighed about 65 pounds. She had a relatively small brain, a little\nbigger that a chimpanzee, but only about 30% that of modern humans. The structure of her hips showed\nthat Lucy walked upright. This result was important as it showed that bipedalism evolved before brain\nsize increases. Johanson suggested the species name of Australopithecus afarensis for Lucy, afarensis for\nAfar, the region of Ethiopia where the fossil was discovered. Since then there have been many additional\ndiscoveries of A. afarensis fossils making it one of the best documented pre-human hominid species.\n145\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Human Evolution\nInitially some suggested A. afarensis was at least partially arboreal and that, when not in the trees, walked\nwith an ape-like gait, much as chimps sometimes do. Recent discoveries of fossil foot bones however,\nclearly show that Lucy had a modern human-like foot and walked fully erect, much as we do today.\nAustralopithecus afarensis\nCompared to the modern\nand extinct great apes, A.\nafarensishas reduced\ncanines and molars,\nalthough they are still\nrelatively larger than in\nmodern humans. A.\nafarensisalso has a\nrelatively small brain size\n(~380 430 cm3) and a face\n\u2013\nwith forward projecting\njaws.\nFigure 13.3 Australopithecus\n13.2 The Earliest Hominids\nBased on fossil and genetic evidence, it is estimated that the lines leading to chimpanzees and humans\ndiverged about 5 million years ago. Fossils dating from that era are rare and much of the interpretation\nis highly speculative.\nSahelanthropus tchadensis is an ape-like fossil approximately 7 million years old. The fossils found include\nonly fragments of the skull. These show a mixture of human and chimpanzee features. The braincase\nsuggests a chimpanzee, but the teeth are closer to those of humans. The point at the back of the skull\nwhere the neck muscles attach suggests that this species walked upright.\nThe discovery was made in Chad in the central part of Africa resulting in both its scientific name and\nits nickname, \u2018Toumai\u2019 meaning \u2018hope of life\u2019 in the local language of Chad. S. tchadensis may be a\ncommon ancestor of both humans and chimpanzees, though it is unlikely to be the most recent one.\nThe evidence from DNA mutation clocks suggest humans and chimps diverged about 5 million years\nago, some 1 or 2 million years later.\n146\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Human Evolution\nOrrorin tugenesis is another fossil from approximately the time that humans and chimpanzees diverged.\nIt is represented only by some teeth, parts of two lower jaws, and fragments of arm and leg bones. These\nare accurately dated between 6.1 and 5.8 million years.\nThe leg bones strongly suggest that O. tugenensis was bipedal. The teeth are small and remarkably\nhuman-like, in fact, more human-like that the later australopithecines such as Lucy. The discovers claim\non the basis of dental anatomy and advanced bipedality, that O. tugensis was in the direct line of descent\nto modern humans and that all of the australopithecine species, with their slightly more ape-like teeth,\neventually became extinct This view is extremely controversial.\n13.3 Australopithecines\nChronologically, the next important group of species is the australopithecines. Unlike S. Tchadensis and\nO. tegenensis, australopithecines are unambiguously on the hominid side of decent from the common\nancestor of chimpanzees and humans, although whether they are direct ancestors or a branch of the\nline that became extinct, is still being debated. The oldest of these species is Australopithecus amenensis\ndated at about 4 million years ago. They were originally classified as A. afarensis, but were reclassified\nin 1995 based primarily on differences in teeth. The next species in the australopithecus genus is A.\nafarensis (Lucy) discussed earlier.\n147\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Human Evolution\nThe first australopithecine fossil was discovered and named by Raymond Dart, a South African\nanthropologist, in 1924. He named it Australopithecus africanus (southern ape of Africa). Although\nprimitive in many of its features, this juvenile specimen had teeth that were distinctly more human-like\nthan ape-like.\nAustralopithecus africanus\nThis juvenile australo-\npithecine, the Taung child,\nwas found by Raymond\nDart in 1924. Dart\u2019s\ncontention that the creature\nwas a hominid that walked\nupright was dismissed by\nmost scientist of the time,\nbut has since been amply\nverified by further\ndiscoveries.\nFigure 13.4 Australopithecus africanus\nHowever, due to other more primitive features, some researchers believe A. africanus, instead of being a\ndirect ancestor of humans, evolved into the genus Paranthropus, a more robust group of species definitely\nnot in the direct line of human descent. One species seen as a descendent of A. africanus is Paranthropus\nrobustus. Both P. robustus and A. africanus crania seem very similar despite the more heavily built\nfeatures of P. robustus that are adaptations for heavy chewing, suggesting a diet similar to that of gorillas.\nA later australopithecine species is A. garhi, was found in Ethiopia in 1996 and dated at about 2.5 million\nyears ago. The species name \u2018garhi\u2019 means surprise in the local Afar language. A, garhi is suspected by\nsome to be the ancestors of the Homo line leading to us. In fact, primitive stone tools have been found\nwith the A. garhi fossils, the criterion for being considered in the genus Homo.\n148\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Human Evolution\n13.4 Homo habilis\nThe genus Homo is reserved for species capable of manufacturing and using tools. In modern taxonomy,\nHomo sapiens is the only extant species of this genus. The fossil record shows that there were earlier Homo\nspecies, all of which are now extinct. While some of these other species might have been ancestors of\nH. sapiens, many were likely our \u201ccousins\u201d, having speciated away from our ancestral line. There is not\nyet consensus as to which of the Homo species are our direct ancestors, but one frequently mentioned\nin this context is Homo habilis.\nThe first species found in close association with primitive stone tools was given the name Homo habilis\n(literally, handy man). Mary and Louis Leakey found the first fossils in Tanzania, East Africa, in 1962.\nMany additional H. habilis fossils have been found, all exclusively in Africa. They date to approximately\n2.3 to 1.4 million years ago. In 2010, Homo gautengensis was discovered and is believed to be even older\nthan H. habilis.\nThe tools found with H. habilis are crude stone tools \u2013 core stones flaked to produce sharp edges. These\nare similar to, but slightly more sophisticated than those found in association with A. garhi fossils.\nThese types of tools are referred to as \u2018Oldowan\u2019 after the gorge in Tanzania where they were first found.\nOldowan tools were used by hominids from about 2.5 to 1.7 million years ago.\nH. habilis was short and had disproportionately long arms compared to modern humans. However, it\nhad a less protruding face than the australopithecines from which it may have descended. H. habilis had\na cranial capacity slightly less than half the size of modern humans.\nIn the mid-20th century, when the fossil record was much more incomplete than now, many anthropologists\nbelieved that humans descend from our earliest hominid ancestor in a single, un-branching line. We now\nknow that that is not true. There have been many branches, all but one leading to eventual extinction. For\nexample, Homo habilis co-existed with other Homo-like bipedal primates, such as Paranthropus robustus\nand P. boisei. However, H. habilis, possibly because of its early tool innovation and a less specialized\ndiet, very likely became the precursor of an entire line of new species, whereas the Paranthropus line\ndisappeared from the fossil record.\n149\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Human Evolution\nHomo habilis\nDiscovered by the Leakeys in\nthe 1960s, H. habiliswas the\nfirst fossil species to be found\nin close association with stone\ntools. H. habiliscoexisted\nwith several other hominid\nspecies in Africa. including\nrobust forms of the genus\nParanthropus.\nFigure 13.5 Homo habilis\n150\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Human Evolution\n13.5 Homo erectus\nThe fossils that eventually became known as Homo erectus, were among the earliest hominid fossils\ndiscovered. Eugene Dubois, a Dutch physician/anatomist, became obsessed with Darwin\u2019s evolutionary\ntheory, particularly as it applied to humans. In 1886, he gave up a successful medical practice to travel to\nAsia in search of the \u2018missing link.\u2019 In 1891 on the Indonesian island of Java, he found a fossilized skullcap\nand femur that show several features of modern humans but are clearly more primitive. He was sure he\nhad found the missing link and named his find Pithecantropus erectus (literally, erect walking ape man).\nDubois made his find public a few years later, and was met by derision from the dominant British\npaleontological hierarchy. Dubois was disillusioned and eventually refused to allow other researchers\nto examine the fossils, hiding them away in his house.\nIn the 1920s and 30s, similar fossils were discovered near Beijing, that became known as Peking man.\nSimilarly, Dubois\u2019 find was by then known as Java man. The two were recognized as the same species\nand renamed Homo erectus. Other than our species, H. erectus was the most far-ranging hominid species\nwith remains being found throughout Africa, Europe, and Asia. H. erectus first appeared in Africa some\n1.9 million years ago and became extinct in Africa and Europe some 300 thousand years ago. However\nthey may have survived until as recently as 50,000 years ago in Asia. It is believed by many that African\nH. erectus gave rise to modern humans while the lines in Europe and Asia were dead-ends.\nH. erectus used more diverse and sophisticated stone tools than the Oldowan technology, its predecessor.\nThe newer tool industry is known as Acheulean. H. erectus was probably the first hominid to live in\nsmall, familial societies similar to modern hunter-gatherers. H. erectus is thought to be the first hominid\nto hunt in coordinated groups, use complex tools, and care for infirm or injured companions. Sites in\nEurope and Asia seem to indicate controlled use of fire by H. erectus, some dating back 1.5 million years.\nEarly African Homo erectus fossils are sometimes referred to as H. ergaster, although the distinction\nis not accepted by everyone. In addition to H. ergaster, several additional species names appear in the\nliterature for fossils others classify as H. erectus.\n151\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Human Evolution\nHomo erectus\nH. Erectus was one of the\nmost successful and wide-\nspread hominid species. They\ncontrolled the use of fire and\nsignificantly advanced the\nstone tool industry. They\nwere the first hominid\nspecies to migrate out of\nAfrica, occupying parts of\nEurope and southern Asia.\nThey survived as a species\nfor almost 2 million years.\nFigure 13.6 Homo erectus\n13.6 Homo neanderthalensis\nBetween 250,000 and 30,000 years ago, another species of Homo inhabited territory from England across\nsouthern Europe into Asia. Since the first fossils were found in the Neander valley of Germany, these\npeople are often referred to as Neanderthals. The Neanderthals had an average brain volume as large\nas, or perhaps even slightly larger than, modern humans. They built hut-like structures and produced a\nmore advanced stone tool industry with which they hunted big game. They also developed ceremonial\nrituals. The remains of this relatively short-lived group reflect a state of consciousness akin to our own.\nThey clearly had a sense of physical mortality. Ceremonial burials show a concern with life after death.\nIn the Neanderthals there are signs of a greater consciousness of the subtleties of the world and the roots\nof our own complicated beliefs, societies, and religious sensibilities.\nNeanderthals earliest ancestors evolved, like all hominids did, in Africa and migrated outwards into\nEurope and Asia. Recent mitochondrial DNA studies suggest that Neanderthals and modern humans\nhad a common ancestor about 550,000 years ago. In Europe and Asia, Neanderthals lived following a\ncombined scavenger and hunter-gatherer lifestyle until about 30,000 years ago, when they disappeared.\nFor the last 10,000 years of their existence, Neanderthals shared Europe with anatomically modern\nhumans and apparently the two types of humans led fairly similar lifestyles.\n152\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Human Evolution\nHomo neanderthalensis\nNeanderthals inhabited Europe and\nparts of western Asia. The first\nproto-Neanderthal traits appeared in\nEurope as early as 350,000 years\nago. By 130,000 years ago, full\nblown Neanderthal characteristics\nhad appeared. The Neanderthals\nbegan to be displaced around\n45,000 ago by modern humans, as\nthe Cro-Magnon people appeared in\nEurope. Neanderthals became\nextinct in Europe approximately\n24,000 years ago.\nFigure 13.7 Homo neanderthalensis\n153\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Human Evolution\nOne of the most hotly debated topics in human evolution is the relationship between modern humans\nand Neanderthals. Some researchers believe that they are closely enough related that they should be\nclassified as subspecies rather than separate species. Thus, Homo sapiens neanderthalensis and Homo\nsapiens sapiens. This is currently a minority opinion. A related question is, Did they interbred? The\nanswer seems to be yes, at least in a limited way. The Neanderthal Genome Project appears to have\nsettled the issue, by uncovering evidence that some modern humans from Eurasia, but not from Africa,\nhold a tiny percentage (1\u20134%) of Neanderthal genes. Now that the issue of interbreeding seems to have\nbeen settled, why modern humans survived while Neanderthals did not is the issue being hotly debated.\nReasons discussed include climate change, better language and thus cooperative hunting skills, and\ngreater intellectual capabilities. Some have even suggested out and out genocide.\n13.7 Homo sapiens\n\u201cThe creature called man has a strange history. He is not of one piece, nor was he born of a single\nmoment in time. His elementary substance is stardust almost as old as the universe. His living\norgans, his eyes, backbone, his hands and feet \u2013 even his remarkable brain \u2013 have originated\nin far places and in different eras of time.\u201d The Lost Notebooks of Loren Eiseley, pp 105\u2013106.\nAnatomically modern humans arose in Africa between 200,000 and 150,000 years ago. Somewhere\nbetween 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, a small group, or several small groups migrated out of Africa\nand eventually populated the entire world. There are two distinct theories as to how this happened. One,\ncalled the Multi-regional hypothesis, asserts that as Homo sapiens spread, they interbreed with existing\nH. neanderthalensis and H. erectus populations. Thus today\u2019s humans are a blend of species. It seems well\nestablished that there was limited interbreeding between H. sapiens and Neanderthals, but, in general,\nthe current evidence tends to favor the alternative hypothesis.\nThe Out of Africa hypothesis (more scientifically referred to as the \u2018recent single origin\u2019 hypothesis)\nasserts that all humans today are descended from the relatively small population that left Africa less\nthan 100,000 years ago, and replaced the existing hominid species present at that time. The evidence\nfor this is primarily genetic in nature. Regardless of how it occurred, the fact is that today there is but a\nsingle species of hominids alive on the planet. Not only a single species, but a single subspecies. Racial\ndifferences are obvious, but superficial, and not nearly sufficient to divide humans into subspecies.\n154\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Human Evolution\nOut of Africa vs Multiregional\nFigure 13.8 Out of Africa vs Multiregional\nThe Latin meaning of Homo sapien is \u2018wise man.\u2019 It reflects the greater endowment of brain power\ncompared to predecessors.

But there has also been a concurrent change\nthat has taken place, one that is recorded only indirectly in the fossil record. As best we can tell, we are\nthe only species driven to make sense of the universe, the only species able to stand in wonder and awe\nbefore the mystery and beauty of the Universe. How did this come about? Clearly it had something to\ndo with evolutionary changes in brain size and structure. But what exactly is it that has produced these\nabilities and propensities? What is the relationship between mind and body? This is an old question,\none that has only recently begun to be addressed by empirical methods.\n157\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Consciousness\n14.1 The Human Brain\nThe brain controls the other organ systems of the body by causing secretion of chemicals such as\nhormones and neurotransmitters. This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to\nchanges in the environment. In vertebrates, the spinal cord by itself contains neural circuitry capable of\ngenerating reflex responses as well as simple motor patterns such as swimming or walking. However,\nsophisticated control of behavior based on complex sensory input, requires the information-integrating\ncapabilities of a centralized brain.\nThe Human Brain\nFigure 14.1 The Human Brain\nDespite rapid scientific progress, much about how brains work remains a mystery. The operations of\nindividual neurons and synapses are now understood in considerable detail, but the way they cooperate\nin ensembles of thousands or millions has been very difficult to decipher. Methods of observation such as\nEEG recording and functional neuroimaging techniques tell us that brain operations are highly organized.\nThe cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain, accounting for 85% of the organ\u2019s weight. The\ndistinctive, deeply wrinkled outer surface is the cerebral cortex, which consists of gray matter. Beneath\nthis lies the white matter which connects cortical neurons to other neurons in the brain and to other\nparts of the body. It\u2019s the cerebrum that makes the human brain, and the mental capacities associated\nwith it, so distinct from that of other species.\n158\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Consciousness\nThe brain is made up of many specialized areas that work together. The cortex is the outermost layer of\nthe cerebrum. Thinking and voluntary movements begin in the cortex. The brain stem is between the\nspinal cord and the rest of the brain. Basic functions like breathing and sleep are controlled here. The\nbasal ganglia are a cluster of structures in the center of the brain. The basal ganglia coordinate messages\nbetween multiple other brain areas which often coordinate control of movement. The cerebellum is at\nthe base and the back of the brain. The cerebellum is responsible for coordination and balance.\nThe cerebrum has two halves, or hemispheres. Research suggests that the two different sides of the brain\ncontrol two different \u2018modes\u2019 of thinking. \u2018Left brain\u2019 thinking is frequently characterized by logic, reason,\nand objective analysis, while \u2018right brain\u2019 thinking is more random, intuitive, holistic and subjective. The\nresearch also suggests that most of us prefer one mode over the other. Broad generalizations should be\navoided, however, as no one uses one side exclusively, and many people appear to utilize both sides equally.\nLateralization of Brain Function\nThe human brain is\nseparated into two distinct\ncerebral hemispheres\nconnected by the corpus\ncallosum. The sides are\nnearly identical in\nappearance but the functions\nof each hemisphere appear\nto be different.\nFigure 14.2 Localization of Brain Function\nThe two hemispheres are further divided into four regions, or lobes, in each hemisphere. The frontal\nlobes, located behind the forehead, are involved with speech, thought, learning, emotion, and movement.\nBehind them are the parietal lobes, which process sensory information such as touch, temperature, and\npain. At the rear of the brain are the occipital lobes, dealing with vision. Lastly, there are the temporal\nlobes, near the temples, which are involved with hearing and memory.\n159\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Consciousness\n14.2 The Mind-Body Problem\nThe tern \u2018mind\u2019 refers to the mixture of thought, perception, memory, emotion, will, and imagination,\nincluding all unconscious cognitive processes that as human beings we experience. The human mind\ncreates an inner space that represents the outer world. We can picture our bodies, our cities, the earth,\nor our galaxy. We can imagine things that don\u2019t exist. In fact, we seem capable of incorporating virtually\nanything into this mind-space. For example, we can even visualize the non-spatial dimension of time\nas a spatial entity spread out before us from the Big Bang to the present. The mind\u2019s contents constitute\nour sense of self, a self that no one else has direct access to.\nDescartes said, \u201cI think, therefore, I am.\u201d\nThe idea that our mind and our body are distinct from one another arises because mental experiences\nseem qualitatively different from more concrete bodily processes. The body is a physical entity composed\nof matter and can be understood mechanistically, while consciousness seems more metaphysical. This\nhas led in some cases to a dualistic approach; a belief that the mind and body are in some categorical\nway separate from one another.\n160\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Consciousness\nAlthough a dualistic solution can be traced back to Plato and Aristotle, it was most precisely formulated\nby Rene\u2019 Descartes in the 17th century. Descartes argued that the mind is an independent existing\nsubstance that cannot be reduced to the brain. That is, mind could exist without brain and brain could\nexist without mind. Part of Descartes\u2019 motivation for this point of view was religious in that it provides\na rational basis for believing in the soul\u2019s immortality. For Descartes, mind and soul are the same thing,\nand thus the soul could exist after the body has ceased to exit. Also, the complete separation of mind\nand body allowed Descartes to explain the material world, including the human body, in a mechanistic\nway without reducing humans to machines.\nPart of Descartes\u2019 argument for the distinction between mind and body was that body is extended,\nbounded, and divisible, while mind is non-extended, unbounded, and indivisible. The mind cannot be\nmeasured in terms of size and weight as the body can.\nMost modern philosophers have rejected the view of Descartes that mind and matter are different\nsubstances. Other formulations of dualism have been proposed. For example, property dualism holds\nthat, although the world is constituted of just one kind of substance \u2013 the physical kind \u2013 there exist two\ndistinct kinds of properties: physical properties and mental properties. In other words, it is the view that\nnon-physical, mental properties (such as beliefs, desires and emotions) are intrinsic to some physical\nsubstances (namely brains).\nIn contrast to dualism, monism asserts that the mind is not something separate from the body. This\nview was advocated by Parmenides in the 5th century BCE and was later espoused by the 17th century\nphilosopher Baruch Sponoza. Today, the most common form of monism is physicalism which asserts\nthat the only existing substance is physical and predicts that as physical theory advances, the mind will\neventually be explained in terms of the neural processes of the brain. Thus, the relationship between\nmental activity and brain activity is one that can be addressed through science.\n14.3 How Does the Brain Think?\nAt one time consciousness was viewed with skepticism by many scientists and considered to be solely\nin the domain of philosophers and theologians. However, since the mid-20th century, it has been an\nincreasingly significant topic of scientific research. Cognitive neuroscience is the academic field concerned\nwith the study of the biological basis underlying cognition. The goal of cognitive neuroscience is to\nexplain mental processes and behavior in terms of underlying brain mechanisms.\nBrain activity arises from neurons \u2013 electrically excitable cells that process and transmit information to\nother cells by electrical and chemical means. The signals are transmitted across specialized connections\nbetween the cells called synapses. Through synapses, neurons connect to each other to form intricate\nnetworks of electrical and chemical activity. The human brain is a system of networks consisting of 10 11\nneurons with 1015 connections, making it the most complex system in the universe.\n161\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Consciousness\nThere are several empirical approaches used in cognitive neuroscience. Perhaps the earliest studies\ninvolved brain lesions. By correlating specific losses of function with damage to specific areas of the brain,\nthe lesion method has provided a great deal of information about functional localization in the brain.\nOne of the earliest and most famous studies of localization of function was done by the French physician\nPaul Broca. In 1861, reporting on the autopsy of a patient suffering from the speech disorder known as\naphasia, he identified the damaged area of the patient\u2019s brain. Broca showed that damage to the third\nconvolution of the left frontal lobe was associated with the loss of the ability to speak. This segment of\nthe brain came to be called Broca\u2019s area. Then, in 1873, Carl Wernicke, a German, identified an area\ncontrolling the understanding of speech, now called Wernicke\u2019s area.\nLocalization of mental functions\nDamage to specific\nareas of the brain can\nresult in the loss of\nspecific cognitive\nabilities. area\nBroca\u2019s\nis associated with the\nability to speak and\narea is\nWernicke\u2019s\nassociated with the\nability to understand\nspeech.\nFigure 14.3 Localization of mental functions\nAnother technique used is electrical stimulation of the brain. Since the brain works by means of electrical\nimpulses, brain areas may be tricked into revealing their function by applying brief pulses of electricity\nto the brain and seeing what happens. When brain areas are stimulated electrically, this mimics what\nhappens when they are activated naturally. In this way, it is possible to induce thoughts and perceptions\nwhich to the experimental subject are indistinguishable from real experience. By the proper stimulation\nof the brain it is possible to induce the recall of forgotten events. Electrical stimulation of the brain is\ncapable of inducing emotions such as fear, rage, or love in the complete absence of any reality that might\nproduce these feelings.\n162\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Consciousness\nPerhaps one of the most obvious indications of the physical nature of mind is psychoactive drugs.\nPsychoactive drugs are chemical substances that can cross the blood-brain barrier and affect brain\nfunction, resulting in changes in perception, mood, consciousness, cognition, and behavior.\nAn empirical technique more recently utilized in mind-brain studies is functional neuroimaging. This\nrefers to the use of non-invasive brain imaging methods, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging\n(fMRI) or positron emission tomography (PET), to localize neural activity in the human brain related\nto specific mental functions. Such methods have been in use since the late 1980s to investigate the brain\nregions activated by sensory, motor, and cognitive processing.\nFunctional Neuroimaging\nfMRI image of the\nhuman brain showing\nlocalized changes in\ncerebral blood oxygen\nchanges related to\nneural activity. The\nimage indicates which\nareas of the brain are\nactivated by specific\nmental functions.\nFigure 14.4 Functional Neuroimaging\nAlthough significant progress has been made in the understanding of the physical nature of mind, it is\nfar from possible at present to draw a strict, reducible identity between brain states and the mind.\n14.4 The Evolution of Consciousness\nThe intimate connection between mind and body is well established, even if all the details are not yet\nknown. It is also clear that some of our mental capabilities are possessed by other species. The intelligence\nof dolphins, chimps, and even crows is well established. Who could doubt that their dog possesses some\nlevel of consciousness akin to our own? If consciousness is not unique to humans, it is clear that changes\nin the levels of consciousness have evolved concurrently with speciation.\n163\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Consciousness\nThe evolution of consciousness undoubtedly results from the evolution of the brain. In the long evolution\nof our brain, several important changed in the nervous system have occurred. First, it became increasingly\ncentralized in architecture, evolving from a loose network of nerve cells (as in the jellyfish) to a spinal\ncolumn and complex brain with impressive swellings at the hindbrain and forebrain (vertebrates). This\nincreasingly centralized structure also became increasingly hierarchical. The newer additions to the brain\ntook over control from the previous additions and in effect became their new masters.\nThe evolution of the mammalian brain occurred in several stages, initially involving significant increases\nin the ability to smell. The evidence comes from the tiny skulls of two species of reptile that lived in China\nabout 200 million years ago. Relative to other reptiles these fossils showed a huge increase in the size\nof the olfactory region of the brain. These reptiles are believed to have evolved into the first mammals.\nDinosaurs evolved about the same time and soon came to dominate the landscape. They probably hunted\nduring the day, so the early mammals that survived tended to be nocturnal insectivores.\nIn mammals, visual processing did not assume increased importance until the demise of the dinosaurs.\nAt night, olfaction rather than vision was the more beneficial sense. However, by 55 million years ago,\nsome primates with more evolved occipital (vision related) lobes had emerged from the underbrush\nand the darkness of night.\n164\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Consciousness\nMammals have the largest brains relative to body size of all the organisms on Earth. In addition, only\nmammals have a neocortex, the outer layer of the cerebral hemispheres that participates in higher\nfunctions like sensory perception, refined motor coordination, and (eventually) language.\nThroughout mammalian and primate evolution, there has been a gradual increase in brain size,\nsuperimposed with spikes of fast growth. In addition, over time, different parts of our brain have\nincreased in size at different rates. Brain evolution, from the earliest shrew-like mammals through\nprimates to hominids, is marked by a steady increase in the ratio of brain to body size. The cerebral\ncortex has expanded more than other areas, and within the cortex, some areas have expanded to a much\ngreater extent than others.\nThe mammalian brain is built on the components of the reptilian brain, but with two new structures. The\nneocerebellum (\u201cnew cerebellum\u201d) is added to the cerebellum at the base of the brain, and the neocortex\n(\u201cnew cortex\u201d) grows out of the front of the forebrain. The cerebral cortex, specifically the frontal lobes\nis the part of the brain that most strongly distinguishes mammals from other vertebrates, primates from\nother mammals, and humans from other primates. In most mammals, these new additions are not\nparticularly large relative to the brain stem. In primates they are much larger, and in the human they\nare so large that the original brain stem is almost completely hidden by this large convoluted mass of\ngrey neural matter. The initiation of voluntary behavior as well as the ability to plan, engage in conscious\nthought, and use language, all depend on the new neocortical structures.\nIn the last 3\u20134 million years brain volume within the hominid lineage has increased from less than 400 cc.\nto roughly 1400 cc. This is an evolutionarily significant change that cannot be simply accounted for in\nterms of increased body size alone. From the australopithecines through H. habilis brain size doubled\nfrom about 400 cc to 800 cc. From the appearance of H. erectus to the present, brain size doubled again,\nthis time without any significant change in body size.\nEvolutionary changes in the brain clearly correlate with evolutionary changes in consciousness. In\naddition to the fossil record documenting brain evolution, another line of evidence related to the evolution\nof consciousness is the gradual development of culture. Culture in this context refers to knowledge, belief,\nand behavior that arise from symbolic thought and social learning. Clues to the cultures of the various\nspecies of the genus Homo, and hence to their levels of consciousness, can be found in the artifacts they\nleft behind.\nThe genus Homo is defined by the ability to make and utilize stone tools. The stone-tool industries\nare divided into three main categories; Paleolithic (old stone age), Mesolithic (middle stone age), and\nNeolithic (new stone age), the categories based on the increasing sophistication of the tools. Although it\nis probable that the initiation of stone tool use resulted from the development of new mental functions,\nfurther advances in stone tool technology may not have required new mental capabilities. However, the\ngradual development of language and art probably did result from an increased level of consciousness.\n165\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com From Chaos to Consciousness:\nA Brief History of the Universe Consciousness\nAnatomical fossil evidence for the capability of speech is controversial. Less controversial is the\narchaeological discovery in South Africa, dating from about 75,000 years ago, of abstract geometric\ndesigns incised into lumps of red ochre. These designs are generally accepted by archaeologists as evidence\nfor language and symbolic reasoning. John Hoffecker, the discoverer, concludes that the symbolism\ninherent in the South African artifacts \u201cindicates a thoroughly modern capacity for novelty and invention.\u201d\nAlso found at the South African site were perforated shells that appear to have been strung as beads and\nworn as jewelry. From this point onward there is a growing variety of new types of artifacts.\nAnother artifact showing evidence of workmanship with an artistic purpose is a carved piece of mammoth\nivory dated to the Upper Palaeolithic, more than 40,000 years ago. It appears to be the head of a small\nfigurine. From the Upper Palaeolithic through the Mesolithic, cave paintings and portable art, such as\nfigurines and beads, predominated. Decorative workings are also seen on some utilitarian objects. In\nthe Neolithic, evidence of early pottery appeared, as did sculpture and the construction of megaliths.\nAncient musical instruments and figurative art discovered in caves in France and Germany date to\nbefore 30,000 years ago.\nExactly how these cultural advances relate to the evolution of consciousness will probably never be\nknown. However, the fact that they are related to the evolution of consciousness is difficult to deny.\n166\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com"
