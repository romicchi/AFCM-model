Learning Goals\n\u2022 What do we know when we know a language\n\u2022 Crea)vity in language\n\u2022 Competence\/Performance\n\u2022 What is Grammar\n\u2022 Language Universals\n\u2022 Language Development\n\u2022 Language and Thought What is Language?\n\u2022 The ability to use language, perhaps more\nthan any other attribute, distinguishes\nhumans from other animals\n\u2022 But what does it mean to know a\nlanguage? Linguistic Knowledge\n\u2022 When you know a language, you can speak (or\nsign) and be understood by others who know\nthat language\n\u2022 Five-year-olds already know their first\nlanguage(s)\n\u2022 The ability to use a language requires profound\nknowledge that most speakers don\u2019t know that\nthey know Cant help but use language\n\u2022 Try to not understand what I am saying\n\u2022 Just as impossible as trying not to be fooled by op)cal\nillusions\n\u2022 You cannot stop blinking or having peripheral vision\n\u2022 For example: Rota)ng Snakes \u2013 the circular snakes\nappear to rotate spontaneously in your peripheral\nvision as a result of the peripheral driM illusion. No)ce\nhow the movement stops when you look directly at a\ncollec)on of concentric circles. The illusion is probably\ncaused by unconscious rapid eye movements and\nblinking    Knowledge of the Sound System\n\u2022 When we know a language, we know what\nsounds (or signs) are used in the language and\nwhich sounds (or signs) are not\n\u2022 This also includes knowing how the sounds of\nthe language can be combined\n\u2013 Which sounds may start a word\n\u2013 Which sounds may end a word\n\u2013 Which sounds may follow each other within a word Knowledge of sound system\n\u2022 Knowing the sounds of your language also\ninvolves knowing how your face looks ahwen\nyou produce them\n\u2022 Mcgurk effect hear da da, but what is\npronounced is ba ba, but lips move to ga ga McGurk effect Knowledge of Words\n\u2022 Knowing a language also means identifying\ncertain strings of sounds as meaningful words\n\u2022 Most words in all languages are arbitrary\nconnections of sound to meaning\nhand main nsa ruka\n(English) (French) (Twi) (Russian) History of words\n\u2022 Knowing a language does not mean we know\nits history or the etymology of words.\n\u2022 Many words of English have a common\nancestor with similar words in other languages\n\u2022 Languages changes so there will always be\nproto-\u00ad\u2010languages\n\u2022 The structure of protolanguages \u2018dies\u2019 with its\nspeakers. Ancestral Protolanguages\n\u2022 One way we can tell if languages are genetically related\nis if they have a large number of sound correspondences\n\u2013 Where an English word begins with an f, the corresponding word\nin French and Spanish begins with a p:\nEnglish \/f\/ French \/p\/ Spanish \/p\/\nfather p\u00e8re padre\nfish poisson pescado\n\u2013 From these correspondences, we can hypothesize that Indo-\nEuropean had a \/p\/ since more related languages have the \/p\/\nform, and that at some point the \/p\/ became \/f\/ in the Germanic\ngroup\n\u2013 This does not mean that a modern speaker of English has this\nknowledge as part of her gramamar Knowledge of Words\n\u2022 The conventional\nand arbitrary\nrelationship\nbetween form and\nmeaning is also\ntrue in sign languages\n:erugiF\nniarB\neht\ntuoba\nlaeveR\nsdnaH\neht\ntahW\n.igulleB\nalusrU\ndna\n,amilK\ndrawdE\n,drawoH\n,renzioP\nmorF\n\"LSC\n&\nLSA\nni

Knowledge of Words\n\u2022 Sound symbolism: there are some words\nwhose pronunciation seems to reflect the\nmeaning\n\u2013 Onomatopoeia:\n\u2022 English cock-a-doodle-doo and Finnish kukkokiekuu\n\u2022 English gobble gobble and Turkish glu-glu\n\u2013 English gl and the concept of sight:\n\u2022 glare, glint, gleam, glitter, glossy, glance, glimpse\nbut there is also\n\u2022 gladiator, glucose, glory, glutton, globe, etc. Creativity of Linguistic Knowledge\n\u2022 Every language has an infinite number of\npossible sentences\n\u2022 Knowing a language enables you to:\n\u2013 Create a sentence that has never been uttered before\n\u2013 Understand a sentence that has never been uttered\nbefore\n\u2022 Most sentences we use are new; very few\nsentences are stored in our brains Knowledge of Sentences and\nNonsentences\n\u2022 Language is more than a set of words because\nwords must be ordered in certain ways to create\nsentences\n\u2022 Our knowledge of language allows us to\nseparate possible sentences from nonsentences\n\u2013 What he did was climb a tree\n\u2013 *What he thought was want a sports car Linguistic Knowledge and Performance\n\u2022 Knowledge: what we know about a language (linguistic\ncompetence)\n\u2013 Mostly unconscious knowledge about sounds, structures,\nmeanings, words, and rules for combining linguistic elements\n\u2022 Performance: how we use this knowledge in actual\nspeech production and comprehension\n\u2013 We can theoretically create an infinitely long sentence, but\nphysical constraints make this impossible\n\u2013 In speech we stammer, pause, and produce slips of the tongue What Is Grammar?\n\u2022 Grammar = the knowledge speakers have about\nthe units and rules of their language\n\u2013 Rules for combining sounds into words, word\nformation, making sentences, assigning meaning\n\u2013 When a sentence is ungrammatical in a linguistic\nsense, it means that it breaks the rules of the shared\nmental grammar of the language Descriptive Grammar\n\u2022 Descriptive grammar: a true model of the\nmental grammar of language speakers\n\u2013 In other words, a descriptive grammar\ndescribes the linguistic rules that people use\nwhen they speak their language\n\u2013 The point of view of a descriptive grammarian\nis that grammars from every language and\ndialect are equal Prescriptive Grammar\n\u2022 Prescriptive Grammar: attempts to prescribe what rules\nof language people should use to speak \u201cproperly\u201d\n\u2013 The view of a prescriptive grammarian is that some grammars\nare better than others\n\u2022 During the Renaissance, a middle class of English\nspeakers wished to talk like the upper class, so they\nstarted buying handbooks that told them how to speak\n\u201cproperly\u201d\n\u2013 Bishop Robert Lowth\u2019s A Short Introduction to English Grammar\nwith Critical Notes (1762) Prescriptive Grammar\n\u2022 Lowth decided that \u201ctwo negatives makes a\npositive,\u201d therefore people should not use\ndouble negatives\n\u2013 Despite the fact that everybody was already using\ndouble negatives in English (and communication was\njust fine)\n\u2013 Despite the fact that many languages of the world\nrequire the use of double negatives Dialects\n\u2022 Prescrip)ve Grammars usually argue for a\nstandardized dialect.\n\u2022 Regional forms or forms restricted to group\nclass are frowned upon\n\u2022 Dialects have grammars\n\u2022 Rules are systema)c \u201c \u201d\nThe Standard\n\u2022 Standard American English (SAE) is the dominant (or prestige)\ndialect in America\n\u2013 Nobody actually speaks SAE (it\u2019s an idealization), and it is not defined\nprecisely\n\u2022 When a standard is the dialect of the wealthy and powerful, people\nmay be required to speak that dialect in order to get ahead\n\u2022 Ross (1954) noticed differences in the speech of British upper class\n(U) and non-upper class (non-U) speakers\n\u2013 Non-U speakers wanted to sound U, and U speakers wanted to avoid\nnon-U speech\n\u2013 Non-U speakers often hypercorrected, or deviated from the norm\nthought to be \u201cproper English\u201d \u201c \u201d\nThe Standard\n\u2022 Every dialect is equally expressive, logical, complex, and\nsystematic\n\u2013 All dialects represent a set of rules or lexical items in the minds\nof speakers, and any value judgments on dialects are social\njudgments\n\u2022 British received pronunciation (RP) omits r in certain\nenvironments and is considered the standard\npronunciation\n\u2022 In the American northeast, dialects that omit the r are\nconsidered to be \u201csubstandard\u201d and the prestige dialect\nmaintains the r\n\u2013 What is considered a prestige dialect has a social basis, not a\nlinguistic one Dialect - Lexical Differences\n\u2022 Regional dialects may also differ lexically\n\u2013 British: lift American: elevator\n\u2013 British: pants American: underpants\n\u2013 Boston: tonic Los Angeles: soda\n\u2013 Los Angeles: freeway\n\u2013 New York: thruway\n\u2013 New Jersey: parkway\n\u2013 England: motorway Dialect- Phonological\nDifferences\n\u2022 There are systematic pronunciation differences\nbetween American and British English\n\u2013 For example, Americans put stress on the first syllable\nof a polysyllabic word, and British speakers put the\nstress on the second syllable in words like cigarette,\napplicable, formidable, laboratory\n\u2013 Americans may pronounce the first vowel in data as\n[e] or [ei] but vast majority of British speakers would\nonly use [e] Dialect - Syntactic Differences\n\u2022 Appalachian English has several syntactic\ndifferences from Standard English\n\u2013 Double modals\n\u2022 You might should go home.\n\u2022 He might could do it.\n\u2013 Double objects\n\u2022 I caught me a fish.\n\u2013 Progressives\n\u2022 He came a-runnin\u2019. Teaching Grammar\n\u2022 A teaching grammar explicitly states the\nrules of a language and is used to learn\nanother language or dialect.\n\u2013 Teaching grammars assume the student\nalready knows one language and then\ncompares the grammar of the new language\nto the one they already know Language Universals\n\u2022 Universal Grammar (UG) refers to the universal\nproperties that all languages share\n\u2013 Part of a biologically endowed human language\nfaculty\n\u2013 The basic blueprint that all languages follow\n\u2022 It is a major goal of linguistic theory to discover\nthe nature of UG The Development of Grammar\n\u2022 All normal children acquire language relatively quickly\nand easily and without instruction\n\u2022 Children learn the world\u2019s languages in the same way\nand pass through the same stages of acquisition\n\u2022 If children are born with UG, then they can acquire\nlanguage so quickly and easily because they already\nknow the universal properties of language and only need\nto learn the specific rules of the language(s) they are\nacquiring Sign Languages: Evidence for\nlanguage universals\n\u2022 Deaf children exposed to sign languages go\nthrough the same stages of language acquisition\nas hearing babies\n\u2013 Deaf children babble with their hands\n\u2013 Signed languages are organized in the brain just like\nspoken languages are What Is Not (Human) Language\n\u2022 Some features of human language:\n\u2013 Discreteness: the ability to combine linguistic units to\nmake larger units of meaning\n\u2013 Creativity: the ability to create and understand never-\nbefore-uttered sentences\n\u2013 Displacement: the ability to talk about things that are\nnot physically present\n\u2022 Allows for discussion of past events, abstract ideas, lying,\netc. What Is Not (Human) Language\n\u2022 Parrots can mimic words, but their utterances\ncarry no meaning\n\u2022 They cannot dissect words into discrete units\n\u2013 Polly and Molly don\u2019t rhyme for a parrot\n\u2022 They cannot deduce rules and patterns to create\nnew utterances\n\u2013 If the parrot learns \u201cPolly wants a cracker\u201d and \u201cPolly\nwants a doughnut\u201d and learns the word \u201cbagel,\u201d the\nparrot will not say \u201cPolly wants a bagel\u201d What Is Not (Human) Language\n\u2022 Birdcalls convey messages associated with the\nimmediate environment\n\u2022 Bird songs are used to stake out territory and attract\nmates\n\u2013 There is no evidence of internal structure in these songs,\nalthough they may vary to express varying degrees of intensity\n\u2022 Birdcalls and songs are similar to human languages in\nthat they contain regional dialects, are passed down\nfrom parents to offspring, and can only be acquired\nbefore a certain age What Is Not (Human) Language\n\u2022 Honeybees have a communication system that relies on\ndance to convey information about the location and\nquality of food sources to the rest of the hive\n\u2013 Round dance: food source is within 20 feet from the hive\n\u2013 Sickle dance: food source is 20 to 60 feet from the hive\n\u2013 Tail-wagging dance: food source is more than 60 feet from the\nhive\n\u2022 The number of repetitions of the basic pattern in the tail-wagging\ndance indicates the precise distance, with a slower repetition rate\nindicating a longer distance What Is Not (Human) Language\n\u2022 The bee dances are theoretically able to\ncreate an infinite number of messages\n\u2013 But, the messages are confined to the subject\nof food sources\n\u2013 If there are any special circumstances\nregarding the food source, the bee cannot\nconvey that information Can Animals Learn Human\nLanguage?\n\u2022 Nonhuman primates have communication\nsystems in the wild to convey information about\nthe immediate environment and emotional state\n(stimulus-response)\n\u2022 Humans have attempted to teach human\nlanguage to other primates\n\u2013 These nonhuman primates were taught sign\nlanguages because their vocal tracts cannot produce\nthe sounds of human language Can Animals Learn Human\nLanguage?\n\u2022 Washoe\n\u2022 Koko\n\u2022 Nim Chimpsky\n\u2022 Sarah, Lana, Sherman, Austin\n\u2022 Kanzi\n\u2013 Researchers concluded that while nonhuman\nprimates can string two signs together and\nshow flashes of creativity, their use of\nlanguage is nowhere near human linguistic\nability Language and Thought\n\u2022 Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis: the theory that the structure of\na language influences how its speakers perceive the\nworld around them\n\u2022 Linguistic determinism: the strongest form of the Sapir-\nWhorf hypothesis which claims that the language we\nspeak determines how we perceive the world\n\u2013 Whorf claimed that the Hopi people do not perceive time in the\nsame way as speakers of European languages because the\nHopi language does make grammatical distinctions in tense Language and Thought\n\u2022 Linguistic relativism: a weaker form of the\nhypothesis which claims that different languages\nencode different categories which can influence\na speaker\u2019s perceptions of the world\n\u2013 Navaho: green and blue expressed as one word\n\u2013 Russian: siniy (\u201cdark blue\u201d) and goluboy (\u201clight blue\u201d)\n\u2013 Zuni: yellow and orange are expressed as one word Language and Thought\n\u2022 The strong form of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is\nclearly false\n\u2013 We can translate between languages\n\u2013 We can learn additional languages\n\u2013 If we don\u2019t have a particular word for a concept, we\ncan express the concept with a string of words Language and Thought\n\u2022 Hopi does have a system for expressing time.\nHopi uses words for days of the week, parts of\nthe day, etc. to express tense rather than using\nword endings like English\n\u2022 Although languages differ in their color terms,\nspeakers can perceive differences even if their\nlanguage does not have a word to express the\ndifference Language and Thought\n\u2022 Some psychologists have suggested that speakers of\ngender-marking languages think about objects as being\ngendered\n\u2013 In Spanish the word \u201cbridge\u201d is masculine (el puente), and\nSpanish speakers described a bridge with masculine adjectives\nsuch as big, dangerous, long, strong, and sturdy\n\u2013 In German, the word \u201cbridge\u201d is feminine (die Br\u00fccke) and\nGerman speakers described a bridge with feminine adjectives\nsuch as beautiful, elegant, fragile, pretty, and slender\n\u2022 This evidence seems to support a weak version of\nlinguistic relativism "}
