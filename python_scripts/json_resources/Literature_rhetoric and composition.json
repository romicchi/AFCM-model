{"text":"2 Overview: The Writing Process\n2.1 Overview\nWriting is a complicated and often mysterious process. Although we may think of it as little\nmore than arranging letters and words on a page, a few moments' reflection reveals that it\nis much more than that. On the one hand, writing is an art--we don't say Shakespeare's\nlanguage is \"correct\" but rather that it is beautiful. On the other hand, writing is a science--\nwe want the instructions that came with our Blu-Ray player to be accurate, precise, and\neasy to understand.\nThen there is the matter of what makes writing \"good writing.\" Although we might say\nthat both an instruction manual and a play are \"well written,\" we appreciate them for\ndifferent reasons. A play written in the clear, unambiguous language of an instruction\nmanual would not be a hit on Broadway. In other words, writing must be judged according\nto its context--what is its purpose and audience? Finally, even readers with a great deal in\ncommon may not agree about the quality of any particular text, just as people's opinions\ndiffer about which bands are really great. We really don't know why people have such\npreferences and can't make accurate predictions about what they will like or dislike. Simply\nput, writing isn't simple.\nIf writing is so complicated and mysterious, can it be taught? Since Aristotle, great teachers\nhave taught complex processes to their students by breaking them into smaller, more\nunderstandable processes. Aristotle thought that effective communication skills, like good\nmath skills, can be learned and taught. Math teachers don't teach trigonometry to their\nelementary students; instead, they begin with addition and subtraction. Everything else\nbuilds on those simple processes. No one is born a mathematician. Similarly, while luck\ncertainly plays a role in any successful writer's career, successful writers (or speakers) are\nnot just born into the role--and everyone else is not just fated to flunk English. You can\nlearn to write with substance and style. It takes work, but it is within your power. You\nhave already taken the first step.\nMost of what we know about writing is also true of speaking. Aristotle wrote a famous\ntreatise on the subject of effective communication called \"The Rhetoric.\" This book is meant\nfor speakers; however, teachers and students also have long used it to polish their writing.\n\"The Rhetoric\" is still widely read and applied today by people desiring to learn how to\nspeak and write more convincingly to an audience. Your first-year composition course may\neven have the word \"rhetoric\" or \"rhetorical\" as part of its title. Aristotle taught us that\nrhetoric isn't just about winning arguments. Instead, rhetoric is the ability to determine all\nthe available means of persuasion at our disposal. Ultimately, it's up to you to guess the\nbest course of action, but rhetoric helps you make this a more educated guess.\n5 Overview: The Writing Process\nCompared to speaking, writing is a much more recent phenomenon, and for many centuries\nit was assumed that the best way to learn to write well was either to pray, entreat the muses,\nor carefully imitate writings that were already considered great. Eventually, as more people\nwanted to write, teachers created rules to help them write \"correctly.\" Unfortunately, this\nheavy emphasis on correctness and writing with a narrow set of rules did little to improve\nstudent writing. Simply knowing how to write grammatically correct prose is important, but\nit is not enough, by itself, to make writing effective or persuasive. Indeed, too much attention\nto correctness can result in unintentionally rigid or even comical writing. Legend has it that\nWinston Churchill grew so irritated at pedants telling him not to end his sentences with\nprepositions that he said to one of them, \"Madame, that is a rule up with which I shall not\nput.\"\nSince the 1970s, writing instructors have been teaching writing not as the following of fixed\nrules but rather as a dynamic process: a series of steps that writers follow to produce\ntexts. At first in the '70s, these steps were taught as a somewhat rigid sequence. Now,\nhowever, writing teachers emphasize \"recursivity\"--moving forward through some steps and\nthen circling back to redo previous steps--as the more natural way that many successful\nwriters work. In other words, while we still think of writing as a process taking place in a\nseries of steps, we now understand that good writers tend to switch frequently among the\ndifferent steps as they work. An insight gained while editing one chapter might convince the\nwriter that an additional chapter is needed; as a result, she might start another drafting\nphase--or even decide to divide one chapter into two or three, and begin reorganizing and\ndeveloping new drafts. Likewise, failure to satisfy a publisher--whether it is your boss looking\nat a pamphlet you've written or a book publisher deciding whether to print and sell your\nbook--might lead the author all the way back to the idea-development or organizing stages.\nIn short, while it is very useful to think of writing as a process, the process is not a clear,\nalways-the-same series of steps. Instead, it is a sometimes messy, forward-and-backward\nprocess in which you strive for simplicity but try to appeal to your audience, create but\nalso organize, enjoy yourself if possible but also follow some rules, and eventually create a\nproduct that works.\nIf this sounds difficult, it's not--at least, not if you learn a few lessons this book can teach\nyou--and you practice, practice, practice. The more real writing you do, the more of a real\nwriter you will become. If you are reading this book, then your first goal likely is to do\nwell in a college (or upper-level high school) \"composition\" or \"rhetoric\" class. In short, you\nwant to learn how to write a good academic paper. There are a large number of tips and\nmethods this book can show you. They will work best if, like the writing process itself, you\ngo back and forth between reading this book and doing some actual writing: try some of\nthese lessons out by writing; then return to new lessons or review some of the lessons you've\nalready read to discover what you next can do with what you've written--or with a new\nwriting. Your next goal after learning to write a good general academic paper (or several\ntypes, perhaps--some of the most common being a summary, an analysis, an argument or\n\"thesis,\" an evaluation, and a research paper) is to write in your specific discipline or major.\nEach discipline or major has its own writing style, organizational method, and purpose or\ngoal. Your major or discipline teachers can help you quite a bit as you learn to apply your\nacademic writing skills to their discipline. And eventually, your goal is to write for your\nwork--for your future profession.\n6 Five Evaluation Criteria\nWith each of these types of writing--general academic, specific discipline\/major, and future\nprofession--you'll eventually become increasingly successful. As you learn the types better,\nyou will find--like the experienced journalist on a quick deadline for a story--that often your\nwriting will come more quickly and easily. However, whenever you have a major challenge\nin your future as a writer, you will know how to return to the circular or \"recursive\" steps of\nthe process to develop difficult ideas, explain difficult concepts to your audience, and create\npleasure and knowledge in both yourself and your audience because of your writing skills.\n2.2 Five Evaluation Criteria\nThere are five criteria we can use to evaluate any piece of writing. These criteria are Focus,\nDevelopment, Organization, Style, and Conventions.\nFocus. What are you writing about? What claim or thesis are you defending? This criterion\nis the broadest, concerned with the context, purpose, and coherence of a piece of writing. Is\nyour topic appropriate for an assignment? Do you stay on that topic or drift off on unhelpful\ntangents? Have you focused too minutely or too widely? For instance, an essay about the\nAmerican Civil War in general is probably too broad for most college essays. You might be\nbetter off writing about a particular battle, general, or incident.\nDevelopment. Development is concerned with details and evidence. Do you provide\nenough supporting material to satisfy the expectations of your readers? A proper research\npaper, for instance, usually includes many references and quotations to many other relevant\nworks of scholarship. A description of a painting would probably include details about its\nappearance, composition, and maybe even biographical information about the artist who\npainted it. Deciding what details to include depends on the intended audience of a piece.\nAn article about cancer intended for young children would look quite different than one\nwritten for senior citizens.\nOrganization. Organization, often called \"arrangement,\" concerns the order and layout\nof a paper. Traditionally, a paper is divided into an introduction, body, and conclusion.\nParagraphs are focused on a single main idea or topic (unity), and transitions between\nsentences and paragraphs are smooth and logical. A poorly organized paper rambles, drifting\namong unrelated topics in a haphazard and confusing fashion.\nStyle. Style is traditionally concerned with clarity, elegance, and precision. An effective\nstylist is not only able to write clearly for an audience, but can also please them with\nevocative language, metaphors, rhythm, or figures of speech. Effective stylists take pains\nnot just to make a point, but to make it well.\nConventions. This criterion covers grammar, mechanics, punctuation, formatting, and\nother issues that are dictated by convention or rules. Although many students struggle\nwith conventions, the knowledge of where to place a comma in a sentence is usually not\nas important as whether that sentence was worth writing in the first place. Nevertheless,\nexcessive errors can make even a brilliant writer seem careless or ignorant, qualities that\nwill seldom impress one's readers.\n7 Overview: The Writing Process\n2.3 Stages of the Writing Process\nAlthough we've mentioned that writers often work recursively--that is, frequently switching\nbetweendrafting,editing,proofreading,andsoon--itisusefultobreakthewritingprocessinto\ndifferent functions or activities. To that end, we have divided it into eight smaller processes:\nPlanningandPrewriting,Collaborating,Researching,Drafting,Editing,Reviewing,Revising,\nand Publishing.\n2.3.1 Planning and Prewriting\nWriters generally plan their documents in advance. This stage, often called \"prewriting,\"\nincludes everything from making a tentative outline, brainstorming, or chatting with friends\nor colleagues about the topic. For some writers, the prewriting stage is mostly mental--they\nthinkabouttheirprojects, butdonotwriteuntiltheyarereadytostarttheactualdocument.\nOthers plan extensively and map out exactly how they want their document to look when\nit's finished.\nThis chapter1 describes common planning and prewriting strategies and should help you\n\"hit the ground running\" when starting out your writing projects.\n2.3.2 Collaborating\nWhile there is a long history of thinking of writing as a wholly individual act, most workplace\ncompositions (and composing in many disciplines) involve collaboration. If you're working\non a collaborative text, this chapter will help you develop a collaboration plan, establish\nstrengths and weaknesses in the group, assign roles, and do what ever else will help in\nproducing a co-authored text.\nThis chapter2 offers some helpful tips and strategies for collaborating on documents.\n2.3.3 Researching\nWriters frequently require reliable information to support their documents. A writer's\npersonal opinions and experience are sufficient evidence for many types of documents, but\naudiences will often demand more. Seeking out the information required to support your\nwriting is called \"research,\" and it comes in many forms.\nOne form of research is the interview, in which you call up or meet with someone who has\ninformation on the topic you are pursuing. Another type, \"field research,\" involves travel to\nplaces where the topic can be studied first-hand. You might also circulate a survey. These\nthree examples are all part of what is called \"primary research\" -- research you conduct\nyourself.\n1 Chapter 3 on page 11\n2 Chapter 9 on page 25\n8 Stages of the Writing Process\nWhile many writing teachers assign primary research to their students in the process of\nwriting a \"research paper,\" much of the research that writing at the college level asks you to\ndo is \"secondary research\" -- exploring other people's writing in the form of books, scholarly\njournals, newspapers, magazines, websites, and government documents.\nThis chapter3 describes different research strategies and provides you with the tools you'll\nneed to properly back up the claims you make in your writing.\n2.3.4 Drafting\nDrafting means writing or adding to a piece of writing--composing it. It may seem like a\nstraightforward process, but can often be made difficult by writer's block or other anxieties.\nThis chapter4 describes drafting strategies and how to avoid common pitfalls like perfection-\nism and writer's block.\n2.3.5 Editing\nYou can't edit what hasn't been written. That's why editing comes after drafting. For our\npurposes, it's important to distinguish between deciding what needs to be improved and\nactually making the changes. We'll call the decision-making process \"editing\" and making\nthe changes the \"revising\" process.\nUnlike publishers, who hire professional editors to work with their writers, student writers\ndo most of their own editing, with occasional help from peer reviewers.\nThis chapter5 describes macro editing (editing at the level of content and arrangement) and\nmicro editing (editing at the sentence level), and provides strategies for improving your text.\n2.3.6 Reviewing\nHaving other people review your writing is essential to producing the best piece you possibly\ncan. We often don't make the best readers of our own work because we are so close to\nit. Reviewers, on the other hand, bring valuable perspective we can't get any other way.\nA reviewer is anyone who is willing to look at your work and provide feedback. You're a\nreviewer, too -- for others' texts.\nThis chapter6 explains how to successfully review a document as well as how to make the\nmost of the feedback you receive from other reviewers.\n3 Chapter 10 on page 33\n4 Chapter 11 on page 43\n5 Chapter 12 on page 53\n6 Chapter 13 on page 63\n9 Overview: The Writing Process\n2.3.7 Revising\nRevising is making the changes you or your editors determined were necessary during the\nediting process. Revising is hard work, but it's probably some of the most valuable work you\ncan do to become a better writer. Dive into the task with the willingness to wrestle with\nyour writing and bring out the best in it, and you will learn why revising is often considered\nthe \"meat\" of the writing process.\nThis chapter7 examines the revision process and identifies some strategies that will help you\nimprove your documents and reduce the likelihood of creating even bigger problems. This\nchapter will also cover proofreading, or carefully scanning a document for typos and other\nsimple errors.\n2.3.8 Publishing\nWhat's the point of writing if no one will ever read it? Though some of us are content\nto write diaries or notes to ourselves, most writers desire for others to read and hopefully\nenjoy or benefit from their documents. This is where publishers come in: They help connect\nwriters to readers. The Internet has introduced countless new ways for writers to publish\ntheir own documents electronically, but print publishing is still the preferred avenue for\nmost professional writers. Of course, getting your documents accepted for publication can\nbe a long and frustrating ordeal. We've all heard the stories of now-famous novelists who\nwere rejected time and time again by unimaginative or overly-cautious publishers.\nThis chapter8 describes the print and electronic publishing industry, then identifies strategies\nthat will help you distribute your documents to their intended audience. We will also discuss\nwhy so many authors fail to ever secure a publisher for their work.\n7 Chapter 14 on page 73\n8 Chapter 15 on page 83\n10 3 Planning and Prewriting\n11  4 Overview\n\"The role of a writer is not to say what we all can say, but what we are unable to say.\"\n--Ana\u00efs Nin\nThis chapter begins with some prewriting strategies to help you generate ideas and pick a\ntopic. In addition to learning ways to overcome writing anxiety (writers' block), you will\nalso learn how to craft an outline to keep your ideas on course, organize your draft, and\ntailor it to your audience.\nBefore you actually begin writing, ask yourself the following questions: Who? What? When?\nWhere? Why? How? Which?\nFor instance, you might ask yourself:\n1. Why am I writing?\n2. What is my subject?\n3. Which subject has the most potential to attract readers?\n4. Who is my audience?\n5. Where does my background information come from?\n6. How can I persuade my readers?\nKeeping these questions in mind before, and during, the writing process will help you identify\nand develop ideas. If you experience difficulties, seek your instructor's advice to steer you\nback on course.\n13  5 How do I pick a topic?\nHave you ever been stressed out because you can't think of a good topic for an important\nwriting assignment? You're not alone. As a student, you'd probably prefer it if professors\nwould just assign topics rather than leave you to find one on your own. However, professors\naren't vague because they want to punish you; they usually just don't want to constrain your\ncreativity or discourage you from writing about topics that truly interest you. Professors\nalso want to be surprised by their students' ingenuity, and very few teachers want to read a\nbig stack of essays all on the same stale topic. Unfortunately, just being told to \"be creative\"\nis unlikely to calm you down when you've got a major paper due next week and still haven't\nfound a topic to write about!\nImagine that you are in an introductory literature course. The professor has assigned a\n3-5 page essay on a Shakespearean play that requires multiple sources. You try asking the\nprofessor to be more specific, or offer some suggestions. The professor responds, \"No, it's up\nto you. Surprise me.\" What do you do?\nOne smart option is to go to the library and look for scholarly journals that cover Shake-\nspearean studies. You might also try scholarly books about Shakespeare and his plays.\nBrowsing these sources should give you some ideas about the aspects of Shakespeare and his\nplays, that scholars have found worth writing about. You might find that an idea that you\nthought was \"totally original\" has already been done. However, you shouldn't let this worry\nyou. If every essay or book had to be 100% original, we'd have precious few to read!\nIf you keep reading and skimming articles and books, you'll find many different discussions\nand possibilities for writing topics. Scholars frequently engage in complex and long-lasting\narguments that span across different journal articles and books. Professor X's article on\nclimate change will be mentioned, discussed, or challenged by Professor Y in a book and\nProfessor Z in another article. None of them are worried about saying things that have\nnever been said before; the key is just to say them differently and perhaps better.\nYou will always have one advantage over any other scholar you read--their articles and books\ncannot take advantage of all the relevant scholarship that appeared after their publication\ndate. Don't be afraid to freshen up an old article with new supporting evidence--or challenge\none whose conclusions are called into question by subsequent research.\nYou should also look for an issue that you can reasonably cover given the time and space\n(page count) you have available. After that it's a simple matter of supporting your argument\nby bringing in relevant quotations from those who agree with you. You should also identify\nthe counter-arguments and provide pertinent background information.\nThis technique also works well for writing theses and dissertations. Instead of writing about\n\"things never written about before,\" try to make a new contribution to one of the many\nongoing conversations in the field. This approach is especially handy if you hope to publish\nyour work, since some publishers tend to favor works that fit with their existing line of\n15 How do I pick a topic?\npublications. Readers also expect you to be familiar with, and probably refer to, works\nof other scholars who have written on your topic. Think of your work as either extending\nexisting work or taking it in a new direction.\nIf you intend to publish fiction, it's a good idea to first familiarize yourself with the work of\nsuccessful fiction writers and consider what it is about their work that appeals to publishers.\nThere is no shame in following the same roads that led to their success. This isn't the same\nas \"copying\" or \"ripping off\" an author; there is a difference between duplicating techniques\nand duplicating content.\nIn essence, the easiest way to find a topic to write about is to see what other writers are\nwriting about and join their \"conversation.\" The conversation metaphor is a very useful\nway to understand what scholarship is all about. Rather than thinking of essays or books\nas isolated units of scholarship, try envisioning them as the fruits of a massive network of\nscholars who converse with each other via scholarly documents, conference presentations,\ne-mail, phone calls, and other forms of communication. Research what is available and where\nyou can make the most valuable contribution.\n16 6 What are Some Other Ways to Get\nIdeas?\n\"The best time for planning a book is while you're doing the dishes.\"\n--Agatha Christie\nStill stuck even after pouring over all those books and journals? Don't worry. There are\nplenty of other ways to stimulate your brain.\nIn general, though, remember that good ideas may arise anytime and anywhere. You might\nbe struck by a brilliant insight as you're running on the treadmill or even while dreaming.\nAlways be prepared to record new ideas. Carry a small notepad with you or use your mobile\nphone to record a voice memo. You might even try writing the idea on a napkin and taking\na picture of it. The important thing is to get it down quickly, because you're all too likely\nto forget all about it by the time you're ready to write.\nAnother good way to generate ideas is to read and listen actively. Your texts and professors\nwill discuss relevant issues in the field, and they might make comparisons to related ideas\nand other thinkers. A professor might say, \"There is still work to be done in this area,\" or\n\"there is great controversy over this issue.\" Be alert to these sources for good ideas. The\nbiggest mistake a novice writer can make is to rely solely on \"inspiration.\" As a scholar, you\nare never alone--don't be afraid to listen and respond to the work of others instead of always\ntrying to be original or profound.\nEven chatting with your classmates might help you think of a good topic. You can also\ncheck with your college or university's writing center. Many of them have tutors who can\nhelp you find and hone a great topic for your paper.\nLet's look now at three other techniques for getting those brain juices flowing: brainstorming,\nclustering, and freewriting.\n6.1 What is a Brainstorm?\nBrainstorming allows you to quickly generate a large number of ideas. You can brainstorm\nwith others or you can brainstorm by yourself, which sometimes turns into freewriting. To\neffectively brainstorm, write down whatever ideas come to mind. Sometimes it works better\nto write down each idea on a separate piece of paper. It also helps to ask yourself some\nquestions:\n1. What do I care about or what am I interested in?\n2. What do I know that I could teach others?\n17 What are Some Other Ways to Get Ideas?\n3. What irritates me?\nIn order to capture more of your thoughts, you may want to brainstorm a few times until\nyou have enough ideas to start writing.\nExamples\nImagine you are in a class. Your instructor says you will have to write a paper on your\nfavorite free-time activity, and that you must also persuade your reader to try it.\nFirst ask yourself, What do I care about? or What am I interested in?\nIt is easiest to write about a topic that you are interested in. This could be anything from\ngardening to ice skating, or from writing poetry to playing the piano. Your list, in this\nexample, would then read:\n1. gardening\n2. ice skating\n3. writing poetry\n4. playing the piano\nAt this stage, every idea is good since you are trying to come up with as many ideas as\npossible.\nSecond, ask yourself, What do I know that I could teach others?\nYou may be able to teach someone else something that you really enjoy. Good for you! If\nyou cannot, don't worry; you are still just brainstorming. Perhaps you teach swimming\nlessons or t-ball, or maybe you bake really well and are able to offer some of your insights.\nYour list, in this example, would then read:\n1. swimming lessons\n2. t-ball\n3. baking\nAnything is fine. You are still brainstorming.\nLet's think of another example. How about the common situation in which the instructor\nwants you to write about \"something you care about\" or an \"issue you have\"?\nAgain start by asking yourself a question. Ask yourself, What irritates me?\nEveryone has things that irritates them, some small and others larger. An example of\nsomething small that's irritating could be people in your dorm who leave trails of toothpaste\nby the sink and never clean up after themselves. A personal example can be useful as a\nbridge to a larger issue that will be your topic -- in this case it could be community living\nand personal responsibility.\nIn academic writing with a less personal slant, the source of irritation is often another\nwriter\/theorist with whom you disagree. Your \"irritation\" then would lead to an effective\npiece about why you have a better conception of what's really going on. A less direct version\nof this would be a writer\/theorist who makes some good points but lacks something in\nhis\/her argument that you can add to the \"conversation.\"\n18 What is Clustering?\nA majority of academic writing begins with brainstorming. Go ahead! Try one or many of\nthe ideas for brainstorming either by yourself or in a group. Working together to come up\nwith ideas means that there are more ideas coming from many different minds.\n6.2 What is Clustering?\nClustering is a process in which you take your main subject idea and draw a circle around it.\nYou then draw lines out from the circle that connect topics that relate to the main subject\nin the circle. Clustering helps ensure that all aspects of the main topic are covered.\nExample\nAfter using the brainstorm example, let's say you decided on gardening as your topic. Your\nmain idea of gardening would be in the center of your page circled. Anything else that you\nwant to say about gardening you would connect to the circle with lines. You can also add\nmore lines to extend the ideas that relate to thoughts around the circle. When finished,\nyour clustering might look like the following:\nFigure 1\n19 What are Some Other Ways to Get Ideas?\n6.3 What is Freewriting?\nFreewriting helps generate ideas and set them in motion. To begin, start writing without\nworrying about spelling or grammatical errors. You should write your ideas naturally and\nspontaneously so that you can record many ideas quickly. Do not look back at what you\nwrote until you are satisfied that you have written enough. An easy way to freewrite is to\nset a time limit and then begin writing. You can write anything at all, and in the end, you\nwill often find some quality ideas scattered throughout your writing.\nExample\n1. I set my kitchen timer for a specific amount of time. Let's say 5 minutes.\n2. I just begin writing without worrying about what I am putting onto the page.\nThings I like to do. Watching TV is a great way to unwind after a long day. Playing\nvideo games is too. I like talking to my friend Steph on the phone, but I get annoyed\nwhen she doesn't call me back. I like shopping. My favorite store is JC Penney. They\nhave everything that you need there. I can buy clothing, luggage, things I need for my\nkitchen, wall coverings. I love that store. I like going to the theater. Last year, I saw\nThe West Side Story. It was amazing. For some reason, I always look forward to fall\nand spring yard work. I don't know if it is the sense of accomplishment I feel when\nthe yard is ready for the season or what, but I really do enjoy it. There are so many\nthingsthatneedtobedoneeachyeartoo. Inthespring,youneedtobesuretofertilizebefore\nA sample freewrite.\n3. The timer went off, so I stop writing.\n4. At this point, I review what I have written and decide which point(s)\nto elaborate on.\nWith these simple writing tips, you should be able to find a topic and begin the process\nof writing the assigned paper. Established authors use brainstorming, clustering, and\nfreewriting, so you're in good company when you use these techniques to help you overcome\nwriter's block or writing anxiety. If none of these work for you, try to come up with your\nown strategy. What works for someone else may not work for you. After all, these prewriting\nstrategies are just ways to put your ideas on the paper so you can develop them at a later\ntime. Try to enjoy the process of writing instead of seeing writing only as the chore of\nfinishing an assignment your instructor has given you. Done this way, writing might become\na pleasure that can also improve your critical thinking ability.\n20 7 How Do I make an Outline?\nDeveloping an outline, such as the examples below, can be helpful because you can keep an\noverview of what you want to say, check whether you have covered everything, and find what\nis out of scope and should be excluded. The outline can grow during the writing process as\nnew points come to mind.\nOutline example I\nI. Introduction and Thesis\nBrief description of issues that arise when reading \"Hamlet\" II. Issues of feminism uncovered\nthrough reading \"Hamlet\"\na. What other scholars have discovered about feminism in \"Hamlet\"\nb. Which of these discoveries was most evident to me and how\nc. Ideas of feminism that I uncovered on my own III. How uncovering ideas of feminism in\n\"Hamlet\" has led me to better understand what Shakespeare thought of the role women\nplayed in society IV. Conclusion\nA sample outline.\nOutline example II\nI. Mixed marriages\nStates this issue briefly, why I am interested in exploring this, and whether this issue exists\nin my culture II. Issues of mixed marriage within your culture\na. Is it acceptable to get married to a person who is a different religion?\nb. Is it acceptable to get married to a person who is a different race?\nc. What are the advantages or disadvantages of mixed marriages? III. Personal experiences\na. An example from my own life or my family.\nb. An example from the news. IV. Conclusion\nA sample outline.\n21  8 External Links\n\u2022 Finding a Topic1\n\u2022 Additional Advice on Preparation2\n\u2022 Prewriting Strategies3\n1 http:\/\/library.webster.edu\/wbt\/t-w1-00.html\n2 http:\/\/www.mica.edu\/writing\/starting\/planning\/\n3 http:\/\/www.writing.ku.edu\/students\/docs\/prewriting.shtml\n23  9 Collaborating\n9.1 What is Collaboration?\nDuringyoureducationalcareer, andlaterinyourprofessionalcareer, youwillsometimeshave\nto write with other people. Unfortunately, few students learn how to collaborate effectively\nsince most school writing assignments are not collaborative. Outside the classroom, however,\npeople often compose documents collaboratively (even though only a single author may\nreceivecreditforthepiece). Newspaperreporters,novelists,andmagazinewriterscollaborate\nextensively with their editors. Scholars collaborate with other scholars to review and add\ninsight to each other's work. Business writers work closely with colleagues, administrators,\nand consultants to ensure that their work meets the relevant standards. Even poets meet to\ndiscuss their ideas and techniques. In short, all kinds of writers collaborate.\nThis chapter offers some strategies for successful collaboration. It also discusses some of the\ncommon pitfalls that can wreck an otherwise promising collaborative opportunity.\n25 Collaborating\n9.2 Advantages to Collaboration\nFigure 2 alt=An image of two shaking hands of different races.\nCollaborating writers often produce strong documents because they have a greater pool of\nknowledge from which to draw. No two people have the exact same backgrounds, skills,\nknowledge bases, or thought processes. When collaborating with your team members, you\ncan compare notes, ask each other questions, and discover how each member can best\ncontribute. For example, perhaps one of your team members has extensive computer skills,\nwhile another is especially artistic. While these skills might seem to have little in common,\nthey may actually end up complementing each other, which should allow your team to create\na better project than any one person could do alone.\n9.3 Disadvantages to Collaboration\nNot everyone loves the idea of group work. Collaboration can take more time than individual\nwriting, since the team will often need to meet to discuss changes or additions. Sometimes\nthe document can become disjointed, especially if the authors have not tried to match their\nstyle and tone. Team members can also get pigeonholed into certain roles when they could\nbe helpful in multiple parts of the project. A more common problem is that some team\nmembers do more work than others; you may end up picking up the slack for less responsible\nor motivated classmates or colleagues. More than one collaboration has ended with one or\nmore team members quitting in disgust.\n26 Conducting Meetings\n9.3.1 Overcoming these Disadvantages\n\u2022 Meet early on in your project to decide its direction.\n\u2022 Devise a way to evenly split up the work between members.\n\u2022 Create a time line for when the various sections are due.\n\u2022 Set up meetings where members can gather and share progress or obstacles.\n\u2022 Meet near the end of the project to make revisions.\n9.4 Conducting Meetings\nFigure 3 alt=A meeting.\n9.4.1 In order to have a successful meeting\n\u2022 Create an outline for the meeting.\n\u2022 Review the outline with members before the actual meeting begins.\n\u2022 When critiquing a team member's work be diplomatic.\n27 Collaborating\n\u2022 Smaller meetings with partial attendance can work well when warranted.\n9.4.2 Setting an Agenda\nOne group member is usually responsible for organizing the agenda. It is important to note\nthat the agenda describes the purpose of the meeting. Without it, members may become\nfrustrated or question why they are at the meeting in the first place. The agenda organizer\nshould give all members a copy of the agenda well before the actual meeting takes place. He\nor she may need to communicate with the other members to gather ideas for the agenda,\nwhich can be done via email before the meeting. Each group member might want to look\nover the assignment sheet and discuss possible items to add to the agenda. They will want\nto consider all the stages that need to be accomplished in order to complete the assignment.\nThe person organizing the agenda will record the suggestions and create an agenda (or\noutline) which can be distributed to the members and used to guide the subsequent meetings.\nIncluding a time line can also help keep the group on task.\nSample Agenda\nMeeting Date:\nAttending:\nI. Introduction (10 Minutes)\na. Introduction of agenda and discussion of any assignment related questions\nb. Review agenda, including timeline II. Discuss work completed toward the project (20\nMinutes)\na. Briefly present your work to the group\nb. Respond to members' work III. Brainstorm future steps toward completion of the project\n(10 minutes)\na. Provide suggestions for each group member\nb. Consider time frame and due date of project IV.

Wrap up (5 minutes)\na. Questions and answers\nb. Decide on time and place of next meeting\nA sample agenda.\n9.4.3 Taking Minutes\nIt is important to keep a brief and accurate record of group meetings, with infromation such\nas:\n\u2022 Dates\n\u2022 Attendees\n\u2022 Discussion Points\n28 Strategies for Effective Collaboration\nAt each group meeting, elect one member to record the discussion, or take the meeting\nminutes. The minutes should be a brief summary of the main points discussed, and will\nroughly follow the agenda format. A copy of the minutes should be distributed to each\nmember within a day of the meeting. A record of decisions made and tasks assigned can\nprevent conflicts by keeping team members from playing \"the blame game.\"\n9.5 Communicating Away from Meetings\n\"The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place.\"\n--George Bernard Shaw\nFigure 4 A videoconferencing room.\nThere are other ways to communicate with team members when face-to-face meetings are\nimpossible. E-mail allows you to quickly deliver the same message to multiple people, and\nthe recipients can respond at their convenience. The telephone works great if you only have\nto call a small number of people and deliver a short message. Memos are a lot like e-mail,\nbut will take more effort to send. A fax will also work to communicate information to other\ngroup members. All you need to do is decide which form of communication will work best\nfor the respective message.\n9.6 Strategies for Effective Collaboration\nThe two most important aspects of effective collaboration are discussion and planning.\n29 Collaborating\nIf group members participate in active, open discussion, the group will be more likely to\nshare a clear understanding of the assignment. The assignment may be divided up among\nthe group members or all aspects of the assignment may be worked on collaboratively. Open\ndiscussion can also help an individual overcome obstacles. For many students, it is easier to\ntackle obstacles as a team than it is to do so alone.\nIt is very important to schedule group meetings when all members are able to attend.\nCommitting to these scheduled times will help the group meet the required deadline in a\ntimely manner. Although it is most useful to meet with the group in person, group meetings\ncan also take place online when meeting in person is impossible.\n\u2022 Be honest about your abilities. If you know you aren't good at something specific, let\nyour group members know. They'll respect you for your honesty.\n\u2022 If you're unhappy with the way a project is going, say so. This is your grade and you\nhave a right to let your instructor know when things aren't going the way you think they\nshould.\n\u2022 Respect your group members. Everyone has something unique to contribute to the\nproject. You may not agree on everything, but being kind is sometimes the most\nimportant ingredient in getting things accomplished.\n\u2022 Have fun. Although it's homework, this is an opportunity to get to know new people.\n\u2022 Be responsible for your part. Do the work that's expected but don't be afraid to ask for\nhelp if you need it.\n30 An Example of Collaborative Work\/Group Conferencing\n9.7 An Example of Collaborative Work\/Group Conferencing\nFigure 5 Acrobats at Cirque du Soleils Nouvelle Experience Finale 1994.\nMany students struggle with group\/peer editing, and when they are put in small groups\nand told to help each other with their papers, they have no idea how to do so effectively,\nusually resulting in a lot of patting one another on the back, fixing a few commas, and then\nhaving a long conversation about last night's game. Little constructive work comes from\nthese meetings. Many have created worksheets for students to follow, but these worksheets\noften invite brief and unhelpful comments. Students, however, can be taught how to do\nthis well by having \"group conferences.\" A group conference consists of three steps: One,\n31 Collaborating\nstudents are put into groups of three, four, or five (four is ideal) and give drafts of their\npapers to one another, so that each student has a copy of every other student's paper in the\ngroup. Two, students read each others' papers and fill out a \"group conferencing worksheet,\"\nwhich is very much like a peer editing worksheet; be sure to only ask open-ended questions.\nThree, students get together as a group with an experienced writing instructor or tutor who\nleads them through the worksheet, asking them the questions on the worksheet but making\nsure that they answer them thoroughly. The key to this is that the instructor or tutor has\nnot read the papers. Because they don't know what the papers are about, how they are\norganized, how they support their arguments, or even what the purpose of the paper is, they\ncan ask all kinds of probing questions that help the students to not only think critically\nabout the papers they are working on, but also learn what kinds of questions make peer\nreview effective.\nIf students go through this process with some guidance a couple times, their self-directed\npeer sessions should be more productive afterward. Students will learn to think critically\nabout the writing of others as well as their own. Additionally, it is more productive and\ninteresting for students because, unlike a regular one-on-one conference with an instructor,\nthey get the input of several readers.\n32 10 Researching\n10.1 Introduction to Research\nResearch can be an intimidating but rewarding process. It allows you to gain additional\nknowledge on a topic, assemble outside support, and provide credibility for your assertions.\nCreating a research paper can be divided into three main steps: finding sources, evaluating\nsources, and integrating sources. This section will provide instruction on each of these steps,\nalong with additional links and information to guide you through the research process.\n10.2 Determine the Role of Research in Your Writing\nDepending upon the purpose of the assignment, research can be used to accomplish many\nthings.\nWhether you are writing to inform, persuade, or critique, research should be used in\nconjunction with your own ideas to support your thesis and your purpose. Do not let the\nresearch speak for itself. You, the writer of the document, are the most important voice. You\nare using outside sources to support your thesis. Therefore, let your comments, connections,\nobjections, etc. play the strongest role in your paper. When you quote or paraphrase an\noutside source, always bring the paper back to your thoughts.\nIt is essential to use outside sources that are going to back up your argument. In many\ncases, researching will reveal evidence that might relate to the topic but does not support\nyour side of the argument. Many assignments will ask you to acknowledge the other side of\nthe argument, so be sure to research your topic thoroughly and from many angles.\nFor some assignments, outside research may not be necessary. Thus, in determining the\nnecessary amount of research needed, first evaluate the topic of the assignment. For example,\na paper that is based solely on one\u2019s opinion will likely require much less research than one\nthat covers a highly scientific subject. To be sure, always ask your instructor for specific\ninstructions.\n10.3 Finding Scholarly Sources\nBefore you begin your search, it is important to know that sources are divided into two\ncategories: primary and secondary sources. Primary sources include original documents\ncreated by an author or group of authors such as historical documents, literary works, or lab\nreports. They also include any field research you conduct on your own such as interviews,\n33 Researching\nexperiments, or surveys. Secondary sources are sources written about primary sources and\ninclude scholarly books and articles, reviews, biographies, and textbooks.\nMost often in academic writing, you will want to consult scholarly secondary sources along\nwith any primary sources available. A scholarly source would be one that has been written\nby a professional in the field; the person may hold a doctoral degree or have a great amount\nof expertise in the field you are studying. Oftentimes, an author's credentials will be listed\nas a footnote within the source, but if not, an Internet search may reveal whether the writer\ncan be determined to be a scholarly author or one that has done a vast amount of research\non the topic. The author of the source will always be an important consideration, as your\nview of the quality of the article may change depending upon the author's credibility. In\naddition, you must ask yourself whether your source is scholarly.\nIn many fields, there will be a number of academic journals or publications that deal with\npublishing scholarly articles related to the subject. By discovering and accessing these\njournals, you can be sure that the piece from which you are quoting is a scholarly source.\nMany universities pay fees in order to provide their students with access to these journals in\ntheir electronic form, and an even greater number of university libraries will shelve current\nand back issues of these journals.\nFurthermore, conducting an Internet search of these journals and articles may prove fruitful.\nSearch engines such as Google offer the option of searching \"Google Scholar\" in order to\naccess only these scholarly articles. Finding these sources online, depending on the journal\nand the site, may require that you pay a fee to view the article. This is where university\nlibraries come in handy, as they offer free access to the same materials. If you cannot access\na university library, some clever hunting of the Internet may still yield what you are looking\nfor at no cost.\nPopular scholarly databases include:\n\u2022 Academic Search Premier1\n\u2022 Project MUSE2\n\u2022 JSTOR3\n\u2022 Entrez-PubMed4\n\u2022 The MLA International Bibliography5\n\u2022 PsychINFO6\n\u2022 ProQuest7\n...and a large number of other options depending on your field of study.\n1 http:\/\/library.mtsu.edu\/libdata\/page.phtml?page_id=32\n2 http:\/\/muse.jhu.edu\/\n3 http:\/\/www.jstor.org\/\n4 http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/\n5 http:\/\/www.mla.org\/bibliography\n6 http:\/\/www.apa.org\/psycinfo\/\n7 http:\/\/www.proquest.com\/en-US\/\n34 Evaluating Scholarly Sources\n10.4 Evaluating Scholarly Sources\nNow that you have found your sources, you must evaluate them. Evaluating sources becomes\na major component of researching because the materials chosen will reflect upon your\nreputation. Aside from being able to find informative sources, a good researcher is also able\nto quickly assess the credibility of information. Through practice, this skill will come.\nWhen setting out to write a research paper, there is a vast pool of information available,\nincluding books, newspapers, periodicals, reference works, and government documents.\nIncluded in this can be your own empirical data, obtained in interviews and surveys, but\nyou will probably not need to use it all. As important as it is to be able to find sources\nspecific to your topic, it is equally vital to be able to correctly assess each source's credibility\n-- that is, how trustworthy, accurate, and verifiable the sources are. Due to the vast amount\nof information available on the Internet, it presents an especially interesting challenge in\ndetermining the credibility of sources. However, even when evaluating print sources, the\nsame criticism should be maintained.\nYou must also be aware of the author's possible bias. Even the most credible sources may\nexhibit forms of bias, as most authors' past experiences will come into play. Bias is most\nlikely to occur in controversial topics such as politics or religion, but is still likely to be\npresent whenever an opinion is voiced. The author's beliefs and experiences can thus affect\nthe objectivity of the text. Another case may be when the author or publisher has ties to a\nspecial interest group that may allow him or her to see only one side of the issue. Lastly,\nmake sure to evaluate how fairly the author treats the opposing viewpoints. Complete\nobjectivity is very difficult to attain in writing, but try to find sources that are not incredibly\nsubjective. Nonetheless, the most important thing is simply to be aware of possible biases\nso that you are not misled.\nHere are four approaches to assessing the credibility of the sources you find.\n10.4.1 Evaluating Print Sources\nThe fact that it's in print doesn't automatically make it a reliable source. When evaluating\nprint sources ask yourself these questions:\nBook\n\u2022 How old is it? Research projects will have different requirements as to how old your\nsources can be. For example, when dealing with contemporary issues or a current\ncontroversy, using outdated sources will likely provide inaccurate information. For\nexample, a book on euthanasia published in 1978 probably isn't the best choice. While\nthe book may contain useful information for other projects, it does not make sense to use\nit when there are more current materials available.\n\u2022 Who is the publisher? Books published by a university press undergo significant\nediting and review to increase their validity and accuracy. When assessing a book\npublished by a commercial publisher, be aware of vanity presses (companies that authors\npay to publish their works, rather than vice versa). Also be cautious about using books\nlabeled as \"self-published\" or books that are published by specific organizations (such as\na corporation or a nonprofit group).\n35 Researching\n\u2022 Is the author objective? Check biographical information included in the book, as\nwell as other sources, to gather information about the author's background as a way of\ndetermining his or her stance on a particular issue. In addition, find out about his or\nher previous works, past professional experience, affiliations with groups or movements,\ncurrent employment, and degrees or other credentials.\nPeriodical\n\u2022 Is it a scholarly journal or a magazine? Scholarly journals are almost always\ncharacterized by no advertisements, longer articles, and the requirement that authors\ncite the sources they use in writing their articles. Articles submitted to scholarly journals\nundergo substantial scrutiny by other professionals as a way to increase the clarity and\naccuracy of the information contained in them. Most scholarly journals are not sold\non news-stands, but rather are circulated primarily among the academic community.\nIn contrast, magazines are available for purchase; they tend to contain shorter articles,\ngenerally don't require writers to cite their sources, and contain advertising. Therefore,\nwhile magazines may contain relevant information, the content may not always be entirely\naccurate.\n\u2022 How old is it? As noted above, dated material can sometimes be inaccurate. Always\nask your instructor if you're uncertain about how old is too old.\n\u2022 Newspaper article: What do you know about the paper that publishes it? Some\nnewspapers have a discernible political slant, which can often be found by skimming\nthrough the headlines or by seeing how others regard the newspaper. For example, The\nLos Angeles Times is considered a more progressive news source, while its neighbor The\nOrange County Register is considered to have a libertarian slant.\n10.4.2 Evaluating Web Sources\nFor most academic research, teachers will require that students use scholarly sources. For\nthis there are a number of \u201cacademic databases\u201d that will always provide credible sources.\nThese sites generally require some form of a subscription in order to access them; however,\nmany colleges provide complimentary access to students. Once logged into the site, users\nare able to search and sort the articles by criterion such as date, subject, author, and more\nimportantly, whether or not they have been peer reviewed and are scholarly. Examples of\nthese sites include, but are not limited to: EBSCO, JSTOR, and Proquest. Links to these\n\u201cgated websites\u201d can generally be found on your school\u2019s web page. Nevertheless, always ask\nwhat databases are available to you as a student.\nWhile the rest of the Internet has a wide range of easily accessible and useful information,\ndiscretion must be maintained. Because anyone can put information on the Internet, make it\nyour first priority to know who is behind the sites you find. Individuals? Nonprofit groups?\nCorporations? Academics? Advocacy groups? Federal, state, or local government? Small\nbusinesses or single vendors? Depending on your topic, you may want to avoid dot-com web\nsites; for many, their primary purpose is commerce, and that can significantly affect what\nthey publish. Of course, other websites can also have agendas. This can lead to false or\nmisleading information. Therefore, it is best to consult a number of sources so that those\nwith agendas will stand out.\nAsk yourself:\n36 Evaluating Scholarly Sources\n\u2022 By whom was the website created? Be cautious if there is no author. Try looking\nfor \"about this site\" or check the homepage. Does the website discuss the qualifications\nof the author(s)? Does it give contact information such as an email address or telephone\nnumber?\n\u2022 By whom is the website sponsored? Determine whether the website is sponsored by\na special interest group. By learning about the affiliated groups, much can be ascertained\nabout the credibility of the author and web site. Also look at the domain name. This\nwill tell you by whom the site is sponsored. For example: educational (.edu), commercial\n(.com), nonprofit (.org), military (.mil), or network (.net).\n\u2022 Is the website relevant? Decidewhethertheinformationissomethingthatcanactually\nbe used in the paper or, at the very least, gives a helpful background. If what is found\ncannot be used, move on to something else.\n\u2022 Does the website contain any errors? Can the definitions, figures, dates, and other\nfacts presented on the website be verified in other sources? Look for grammar, spelling,\npunctuation, and content errors. If there appears to be more than one or two content\nerrors, move on.\n\u2022 Is the website relatively unbiased? As it is noted above, carefully examining the\nsource behind the website can lead to clues as to what kind of bias and agenda the site\nmay contain. Once the source has been deemed valid, continue to remain alert, especially\nif the topic is controversial. Look for websites that discuss multiple points of view. Take\nnote of the language used, and avoid sites that seem to exhibit characteristics of bias\nand\/or inaccurate information.\n\u2022 Are there advertisements on the Web page? Do these particular advertisements\nreflect a possible bias toward the subject matter?\n\u2022 What appears to be the website's purpose? Think about why the site was created.\nIs its purpose to inform, persuade, or sell a product to the reader? For whom was the\nsite created? Who is the intended audience? If you are not included in the intended\naudience, carefully consider whether or not the information is relevant to your research.\n\u2022 Is the website comprehensive. A valuable website will cover a topic in-depth and\nlead to additional sources.\n\u2022 Does the website provide references? Determine whether the references themselves\nare authoritative.\n\u2022 How old is the website? A website that has remained on the Internet a long time may\nbe better trusted than one that was added a month ago. Make sure that the information\nis not outdated. When was the site last updated? Credible websites will garner ongoing\nattention by their creators to make sure that the content is as up-to-date as possible.\n\u2022 Has the website received any awards? Websites that have received awards may\nhave better reputations.\n\u2022 Is the website user-friendly? Does the website download quickly? Can you read\nall the text? Does any text appear too small, in strange characters, or in a font that\nis illegible? How easy is it to navigate through the website? Is the content accessible?\nThe information presented should be clear, precise, and easy to understand. Avoid using\nsites that make use of overly scientific and\/or technological terms that are difficult to\nunderstand. If it cannot be clearly understood, it may lead to misinterpretation and thus\nincorrect information in your work.\n37 Researching\n10.4.3 Consider Your Project\nHow you evaluate a source will differ depending on the project you're working on. When\ndetermining whether a source is credible, biased, or relevant, it is equally important to\nconsider how the source will be used.\nFor example, Phillip Morris8 has a web site that touts the company's programs to curb\nsmoking among young people. Obviously, information from a tobacco company and cigarette\nmarketing giant can be considered biased. You must ask yourself whether their program is\neffective and whether the content of the site can be trusted and in what context.\nShould you never use that source? You might want to if you were writing a paper that\nexamined the smoking rates of 10 - 13 year olds. What role might the Phillip Morris site play\nin your paper? Does the site display information that contradicts the company's advertising\ncampaigns? Would the campaign website be effective in your argument? It all depends on\nwhat side of the argument is going to be supported in your research project.\nAudience. Purpose. Argument. These intents should be considered since they affect how\nsources should be evaluated.\n10.4.4 Consult ADAM\nWhen faced with assessing a large number of sources in a short period of time, the quickest\nway to cover the essential points is to remember this acronym:\n\u2022 Age. How old is this source? For almost every topic, search for the most current sources\nthat can be found.\n\u2022 Depth. Does the source go in-depth, or does it just skim over the surface? Does it\nfeature the many details and long discussions that are expected from academic sources,\nor does it just seem to cover the main ideas? Always use substantive sources.\n\u2022 Author. Who is the author? What is known about his\/her qualifications? Is he\/she\nreally an expert? Can any bias be seen? What is his\/her purpose?\n\u2022 Money. Follow the money. Is the source coming from a place that's trying to \u201csell\u201d\nsomething? Is there advertising where this source appears that might affect what will be\nprinted?\n10.5 Integrating Scholarly Sources\nTo better understand the process of researching, it should be recognized that there are\nsources of information all around us. We commonly use them in situations ranging from\na conversation with a friend to an online discussion. The difference in academic research\nis that this \u201ccasual conversation\u201d turns into a discussion with the readers of your paper.\nTherefore, it may help to think of doing research and using sources of information as just\nanother way to enhance your conversation with the audience.\n8 http:\/\/www.philipmorrisusa.com\/en\/policies_practices\/ysp.asp\n38 Integrating Scholarly Sources\n10.5.1 Sources Are Other Voices\nEven before you learn the rules of citation, recognize that you already know quite a bit\nabout how to work with sources. It can be helpful here to think of sources as \"other voices.\"\nSources are used when you reference an idea that was heard in a conversation. They are used\nwhen considering what to buy -- whether the source is an advertisement, a slogan you can't\nget out of your head, the fact that a friend recommended a product, or that you've looked\nup price quotes and shopped around. You become knowledgeable about making decisions by\npiecing together the information from many sources. Sources are part of our lives; they are\nall around us and are a part of how we breathe life into the words that express what we\nthink.\nIn research writing, it is similar in the sense that the same act of interacting with other\nvoices is present, and only another layer is added. Because writing is being done, you're\nalso presenting the sources in an organized way, so that your sources are used in a way that\nsupports your point of view. This means that any and all sources that remotely relate to\nthe topic can't be thrown in; instead, pick and choose the best sources for your purposes,\nand use them strategically for effect.\n10.5.2 Purposes of Sources\nSources are capable of playing a variety of roles in your writing. Sometimes sources are used\nas examples; sometimes they present evidence. Sources can also be used to present a counter-\nargument. Other times, they are used only to be built upon and refined. Nevertheless, it\nshould be realized that sources can serve multiple purposes in a paper.\nThis is nothing new. To relate this to an everyday situation, try this: Spend a week paying\nattention to the conversations and discussions you have. Listen for sources used and try to\ndiscern for what reasons they were used. You'll often hear people cite the news or refer to a\ngame when talking about sports. You'll hear friends quote conversations they've had with\nother friends. You will hear people discussing important issues with the participants in that\ndiscussion providing reasons (evidence) -- facts and opinions, but often a mix of the two --\nfor why they feel the way they do.\nIn writing, the natural act of conversing with and referring to others is taken one step\nfurther. Knowing in advance that you'll be writing for an audience, sources (other voices)\nwill be looked at while exploring an idea and planning how to appeal to those readers,\nusing terms and conventions that they will recognize. However, do not let this part of the\nresearch process get in the way of doing what comes naturally. Research is about curiosity\nand interest. It is about having something to say and finding the evidence to support it.\nThat is the basis of research and working with sources. Thus, the technicalities and rules of\nresearch, while important, should not discourage you from doing research and effectively\nusing sources.\n39 Researching\n10.6 Cite Sources to Avoid Plagiarism\nAfter using other sources to gain information for a report or paper, you might decide to use\nthat information in your paper. If the ideas expressed in your paper are not your original\nthoughts, you must cite where you obtained that information. If you do not cite where you\nobtained your information, you are plagiarizing9. Plagiarizing is an extreme offense. If you\nare caught plagiarizing in school you usually will receive a failing grade on the assignment,\nif not in the entire course. You could also risk being expelled from school. If you are caught\nplagiarizing in the workplace, it could likely end up costing you your job. If you are a\nresearcher and plagiarize in a scientific paper, your university may lose funding. To avoid\nthe risk of plagiarism, make sure that you cite copied information! The most common forms\nof citation are direct quotations10 and summarizing11 or paraphrasing. After a direct quote\nor at the end of a summarized or paraphrased thought, you should cite the author and page\nnumber of your source. Information on how to cite sources can be found in The Writer's\nHandbook: Citations12. If you are using other sources in your report and are unsure whether\nor not you need to use citations, it is better to be safe than sorry, so cite the information.\nThe two most common standards for citing are MLA13 (Modern Language Association)\nand APA14 (American Psychological Association). Each is specific to the field in which the\nresearch is done. For example, if you are researching for a psychology class, it is most likely\ngoing to be cited in APA format. On the other hand, MLA is used in the liberal arts and\nhumanities fields. Nonetheless, check with the teacher, group, or organization for which the\nresearch is being done to find out which method you are expected to use.\nUsing and correctly citing outside sources is hugely important to the ethical portrayal of\nyou as a writer. It shows that you have done your homework, literally. It also shows that\nyou are a thoughtful writer who takes this work or subject seriously, who respects the hard\nwork of others, and who truly contemplates the intricacies of research and discovering truth\nin writing.\n10.7 External Links\n\u2022 Learning to Write and Research Using the Web15\n\u2022 Purdue Owl Lab16 Beginning Your Research\n\u2022 The Online Books Page17 Lists over 25,000 free books on the web.\n\u2022 Bartleby18 Search dictionaries, thesauri, encyclopedias, familiar quotations, and usage\nmanuals.\n9 http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Rhetoric_and_Composition\/Plagiarism\n10 http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Rhetoric_and_Composition\/Quotation_Marks\nhttp:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Rhetoric_and_Composition\/Analyzing_assignments#Summary.\n11\n2FResponse_Paper\n12 http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Rhetoric_and_Composition\/Citation\n13 http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Modern_Language_Association\n14 http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/APA_style\n15 http:\/\/www.ipl.org\/div\/aplus\/toc.htm\n16 http:\/\/owl.english.purdue.edu\/owl\/resource\/552\/01\/\n17 http:\/\/onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu\/\n18 http:\/\/www.bartleby.com\/100\/\n40 External Links\n\u2022 Biographical Dictionary19 Searchable biographical dictionary online.\n\u2022 Researchpaper.com20 Relief for Writer's block.\n19 http:\/\/www.s9.com\/\n20 http:\/\/www.researchpaper.com\/\n41  11 Drafting\n\"Close the door.

You have to get your knowledge\nof life from somewhere. You have to know the material you're writing about before you alter\nit.\"\n--Hunter S. Thompson\nThe first draft: Prewriting4 will help you with drafting. Additionally, try writing in\nfull sentences, try to find the best possible quotations, try mindmapping, or try writing\nout all of the data you have gathered. Weave these things together, and you may end up\nwith a nice framework for your paper. Don\u2019t worry about being complete in your drafting.\nDisorganization and choppiness are fine here; you can smooth that out in later drafts. Drafts\nare not perfect. Drafts may contain grammatical and spelling errors and may lack detail.\nRephrasing and expanding ideas may be a part of later drafts.\nThe second draft: The second draft is about organizing your information logically and\neffectively. If you created a thorough first draft, this should be easy. Organize the main\npoints that you plan to make, find supporting evidence for each point, and spend a few\nsentences explaining what conclusions you are able to draw from the information. Don\u2019t be\nafraid to show off. Professors like it when students are able to draw conclusions on their own.\nSometimes it weakens your argument to use softeners like \u201cmight\u201d \u201cI think\u201d and \u201cmaybe,\u201d\nso keep an eye out for these.\nYou will want to come up with an overall organizational strategy and stick to it. Parallelism\nis very attractive in a paper. However, there is also no quick and easy format that works for\nevery topic. You may want to organize things chronologically, with fact and then opinion,\nor by order of importance.\n1 http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Rhetoric_and_Composition\/Planning_and_Prewriting\n2 http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Rhetoric_and_Composition\/Editing\n3 http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Rhetoric_and_Composition\/Reviewing\n4 http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Rhetoric_and_Composition\/Planning_and_Prewriting\n44 During the Drafting Process\nThe third draft and more: The third and any subsequent drafts are really about finesse.\nThese are the drafts that will hook your reader and earn you an \u201cA.\u201d Try to write an\nattention-grabbing introduction, as well as a conclusion that leaves the reader thinking\nabout your paper. If you are still struggling with the overall flow of your paper, go back to\nyou first draft and start rewriting. Often your main point will change by the time you get\nto this draft, and that is fine. However, you may need to go back to your first draft when\nthis happens.\nThe elusive \u201cshow, don\u2019t tell\u201d line comes into play in this draft. Professors want to be\nentertained, and they want more than just facts. You need to show the professor that you\ncan think for yourself, that you know what you're talking about, and that you can write in\nan engaging style. If you are bored reading the paper, chances are your professor will be,\ntoo. Add action verbs, remove passive ones, and use examples. Pretty soon you\u2019ll be ready\nfor a final draft.\nBe sure to follow a timeline. Make sure that you start early to have enough time to go\nthrough many drafts. If you wait until the day before, you will have time for only one draft!\n11.3 During the Drafting Process\nMany writers often narrow -- or expand -- the topic as they write. Overly broad topics can\nbe difficult to manage and can lead to summarization rather than descriptive explanation.\nNarrowing your topic will provide you with a more workable idea to focus on. Asking\nquestions about what you want to know regarding your topic and what you want your\nreaders to know will help focus your writing. If you choose to narrow your topic, first try to\npicture a larger context into which your thesis fits. Make a claim which forecasts the main\npoint(s) of your thesis, then deliver the source which supports the argument. During this\nstage, scan for grammatically weak areas and unsupported claims. You may always add\nbackground information, term definitions, literature review, reasons for your assumptions,\nand counter-arguments to strengthen your own argument.\n\"My starting point [in writing] is always a feeling of partisanship, a sense of injustice . . . I\nwrite because there is some lie that I want to expose, some fact to which I wish to draw\nattention, and my initial concern is to get a hearing.\"\n--George Orwell\nSometimes you will find that it is easier to write the introduction after you have written the\nbodyofyourpaper. Considerwaitingtowritetheintroductionuntilyouhaveadefinitesense\nof what direction you want your paper to take. Many times, if you write an introduction\nfirst, it can limit the information or collaboration of ideas for the bulk of the paper. If you\ndo decide to save the introduction for later, go over what you have written and identify the\nmain point, or points, of your paper. Next, craft an introduction with a thesis statement\nthat forecasts what will follow. Be aware that you need to rework some of the body after\nyou do the introduction. No matter what you choose to write first, it is important to stay on\ntrack. Emphasize several points that are related to your thesis by adding more information\nand going deeper into detail. It is important to gather sufficient information to support your\nthesis. You may be required to provide a reference or in-text citation, or you may find that\n45 Drafting\nyou do not yet know enough about your topic, and more research is required. Research may\nbe necessary for multiple reasons: to learn more about the topic, to provide examples for\nyour thesis, or to use as support for your thoughts, opinions, and the overall direction of\nyour paper.\n11.3.1 Let It Flow\nAs you draft, do not stop to edit or look up small pieces of information; there will be time\nfor precision later. Luke Sullivan, author of \"Hey Whipple, Squeeze This,\" suggests that\nyou must \"write hot and edit cold.\" In other words, write off the top of your head and\nallow your thoughts to be spontaneous. You never want to leave a good idea out. However,\nwhen it comes to polishing the final product, become critical by taking out unnecessary\nwords or ideas that stray from the main message. Do not keep text that distracts or causes\nmisunderstandings. If you have a question, place it in brackets or make a note of it and\nrefer back to it later. First, just get your ideas out without worrying about punctuation or\nspelling. Similarly, if you notice a big gap which requires more research, skip it and work\non other sections. The important thing is to let your ideas keep coming and make progress\non the page. No matter how irrelevant your words may appear, keep writing. If you have\nto stop, be sure to end in a place where it will be easy to pick up from later. Don't get\ndistracted when your initial drafts aren't \"A\" quality work. That's the reason they are drafts.\nThe important thing is to get your ideas down on paper. You can spend time evaluating\nthem later on.\n\"Write 1,000 words a day. That's only about four pages, but force yourself to do it. Put\nyour finger down your throat and throw up. That's what writing's all about.\"\n--Ray Bradbury\n11.3.2 Dealing with Writer's Block\nWriter's block can occur at any point during the writing process. You may find yourself\nsitting down to write when you suddenly realize that you can't think of a single thing to say.\nDon't panic! It's a common problem with a variety of solutions.\n46 During the Drafting Process\nFigure 7 alt=A none Using Wikibooksa.\na http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Using%20Wikibooks\nHere are a few...\n\u2022 Staring at a blank screen can be intimidating. Try writing out your dilemma in the form\nof a question: \"What is it I'm trying to say?\" \"What are my goals?\" Then brainstorm5\nto answer these questions.\n\u2022 Take a break. Ten minutes away from your work will usually recharge your creativity.\n\u2022 Review the literature on your topic to see what other people are saying. Even opposing\nviews can be inspiring.\nhttp:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Rhetoric_and_Composition\/Planning_and_Prewriting#What_\n5\nis_a_Brainstorm.3F\n47 Drafting\n\u2022 Bounce ideas off someone else. Speaking about your writer's block with friends, family,\nand fellow students may help untangle ideas or generate new ones.\n11.3.3 Experiment\nHow do you start your draft? While the occasional flash of inspiration can lead you to\nscribbleoutgreatworkonthebackofanenvelopewithastubbypencil,payingbriefattention\nnot only to 'what you write', but 'how you write' can inspire you to write differently or\neven more effectively. If you start drafting from the conclusion, for example, it could be like\nhaving a \"Guiding Star\" for your paper. Or you could leave the introduction and conclusion\nblank until the end. With that said, you can make up your own approach to create your\nown way of writing. All the technological tools you have access to make it possible for you\nto write virtually anytime, anywhere, and however you want. Take advantage of it. Type on\nyour computer, do research on it, record your own voice if the pen is slowing down your\nthinking. Many people find it helpful to brainstorm; start writing for an extended period of\ntime without stopping, and see what you can come up with. Charting can be a good way to\ncome up with ideas and see connections you may not otherwise notice; when you chart, you\nwrite down a topic in the center of the paper. Then write other words or ideas that fit in\nwith the topic. Draw lines that connect the related ideas. Experiment with your approach\nto writing.\n48 During the Drafting Process\nFigure 8\n11.3.4 Meeting the Minimum Word Count\nIf you are having trouble meeting the minimum page length, look over your paper again\nand see if you can find spots that could use additional detail. Also, look at your assignment\nsheet again to see if you met the assignment's requirements. It is okay to add more detail to\ncertain sections; for instance, is \"a blue car\" sufficient, or would \"a 2007 Vista Blue Ford\nMustang\" work better? But be careful not to make your paper too wordy. Remember that\nquality is more important than quantity. Just adding needless words to add to the word\n49 Drafting\ncount keeps you from actually developing your ideas and strengthening the content of the\npaper.\nAlso see Generating Ideas6 in the Drafting section of this book.\n11.3.5 Title of Your Essay\nComing up with a good title for your essay might seem difficult, but there are several\ntechniques that can help. Although some writers start with a good title and write a paper\nto fit it, others (and probably most) worry about coming up with a good title after they're\nfinished with the draft. The advantage of waiting until the end to work on the title is that\nyou know exactly what you've written.\nMany academic writers prefer a two-part title structure separated by a colon. The \"catchy\"\nbit goes before the colon, whereas the latter part is a straightforward description of the\npaper. For example, \"Cutting out the Cut and Paste: Why Schools Should Use Plagiarism\nDetection Software.\"\nHere are some tips for coming up with good titles:\n\u2022 Get inspiration from best-selling books or well-known essays, particularly those closely\nrelated to your topic (e.g., \"Men are from Mars, Women are from Snickers: Candy Bars\nand the Obesity Epidemic.\")\n\u2022 Look through your paper and see if you can identify some \"key words\" or special phrases\nthat might serve as part of a title (i.e., \"Edit this Page: How Wikis Enable Collaborative\nWriting\" or \"The Blue Screen of Death: How to Respond to Technical Difficulties During\na Presentation.\")\n\u2022 Consider poetic devices, such as repeating consonant sounds (e.g., \"The Cost of Caring\").\n\u2022 Get inspiration from famous quotations or song lyrics (e.g., \"I Shaved My Legs for This?:\nA Feminist Perspective on Country Music.\")\nIf you can't come up with a good title right away, shut down your word processor and\nthink about other things for a while. If you just can't come up with anything clever, just\nremember that a clear and precise title is much better than none at all. A title like \"The\nUse of Skull Imagery in Hamlet\" may not sound profound, but at least the reader will know\nwhat the paper is about.\n\"When you get an idea, go and write. Don't waste it in conversation.\"\n--Kenneth Koch\n11.4 Final Thoughts on Drafting\nHere's a quick summary of the key guidelines in drafting:\n6 Chapter 6.1 on page 17\n50 External Links\n\u2022 Don't worry about your audience before you draft. Your audience may dictate the style\nand tone of your writing, but it is more important to get a good start before adding\npotential complications to the mix.\n\u2022 You may need to narrow or expand your topic as you develop your paper.\n\u2022 If you are stumped about how to start the introduction, it might be helpful to simply skip\nit and come back to it later. The bigger picture might become clearer as you approach\ncompletion.\n\u2022 While drafting, keep all of your research close at hand. This will prevent the need to\nstop writing to look something up, which could break your concentration.\n\u2022 Writing in 30-minute stretches, or longer, will establish momentum, making your job as\na writer much easier.\n\u2022 If you come across a small detail that you are unsure about, simply write yourself a note\nand come back to it later.\n\u2022 The first draft will not be perfect. Your priority should be getting your thoughts out on\npaper (or on-screen). Leave the fine-tuning for later.\n\u2022 If you must stop writing, be sure to end in a place where you have a good idea of what\ncomes next. You will be able to pick it up again more easily.\n11.5 External Links\n\u2022 Writing the First Draft7\n\u2022 First Drafts Made Easy8\n\u2022 Going Beyond the Five-Paragraph Essay9\n\u2022 Transitions10\n\u2022 Introductions and Conclusions11\n7 http:\/\/pratt.edu\/~wtc\/firstdraft.html\n8 http:\/\/riverbendlaw.com\/firstdrafts.htm\n9 http:\/\/www.calstatela.edu\/centers\/write_cn\/fivepara.htm\n10 http:\/\/www.asu.edu\/duas\/wcenter\/transitions.html\n11 http:\/\/www.asu.edu\/duas\/wcenter\/introconc.html\n51  12 Editing\n12.1 Editing and Revising: One and the Same?\n\"Substitute \u201cdamn\u201d every time you\u2019re inclined to write \u201cvery\u201d; your editor will delete it and\nthe writing will be just as it should be.\"\n--Mark Twain\nFigure 9 Samuel L Clemens, 1909.\nAlthough many writers and even some instructors use the terms interchangeably, you may\nfind it helpful to see editing and revising as two different activities. For our purposes, editing\nmeans going through a piece of writing and making comments and suggestions about how it\ncould be better--or even whether it's appropriate at all. Revising, on the other hand, occurs\nwhen a writer attempts to make the changes suggested during the editing process.\n53 Editing\nFor example, an editor might suggest that you tweak your introduction to make it better fit\nthe rest of the paper. The actual process of changing the introduction is called revising and\ncomes with own set of difficulties. We talk more about that process in the Revising1 chapter.\nYou may be called upon to edit other students' writing. This process is often called Peer\nReviewing and is given a separate chapter2 in this book. If you're concerned about how to\ndiplomatically edit someone's work without being offensive, be sure to read it carefully.\nYou can (and should) also edit your own work. This simply means going back over what\nyou've written and finding ways to improve it. Most writers frequently switch between\ndrafting new sentences and paragraphs and editing ones they've already written.\nIn this chapter, we go over some basic editing strategies and some specific things to look for\nduring the editing process.\nAs previously mentioned, revision concerns large sections of text, while editing concerns\nindividual sentences. Below is a list of potential errors to consider while editing.\n\u2022 Fragments\n\u2022 Run-on sentences\n\u2022 Dangling or misplaced modifiers\n\u2022 Adjective and adverb use\n\u2022 Verb usage and tense\n\u2022 Subject\/verb agreement\n\u2022 Pronoun\/antecedent agreement\n\u2022 Sentence balance\n\u2022 Comma Use\n\u2022 Spelling\n\u2022 Word choice (connotation vs. denotation)\n\u2022 Format\/presentation\n12.2 Sentence Structure\n\"In my sentences I go where no man has gone before.\"\n--George W.

Bush. .\nUse active verbs.\nBe-verbs (is, am, are, was, were, be, has\/have been) indicate condition and often require\nan extra sentence or clause to be sound. Active verbs allow you to compose sharply\nwithout numbing the rhythm of your writing. Read your writing with an objective eye\nand think: \u201cHow can I make every sentence and paragraph straightforward and simple?\u201d\nBelow are examples in italics of wordy and confusing verbiage. Below the italics are the\nsame sentences that have been simplified.\n55 Editing\n'The sharp rise in fuel prices is a serious challenge to trucking firms.

Certain stock phrases are weak and wordy. They\ncan make you sound stuffy or as though you\u2019re just trying to fill up space. Use\nthese replacements\nBecause, Since, Why: the reason for, for the reason that, owing\/due to the fact that,\nin light of the fact that, considering the fact that, on the grounds that, this is why\nWhen: on the occasion of, in a situation in which, under circumstances in which\nAbout, Regarding: as regards, in reference to, with regard to, concerning the matter\nof, where ABC is concerned\nMust, Should: it is crucial that, it is necessary that, there is a need\/necessity for, it is\nimportant that, it cannot be avoided that\nCan: is able to, has the opportunity to, has the capacity for, has the ability to\nMay, Might, Could: it is possible that, there is a chance that, it could happen that, the\npossibility exists for\nLuckily, Internet users can find numerous web sites about how to eliminate wordiness.\nUse Parallelism in sentences.

Parallelism uses the same pattern in words and structure to show equal\nimportance or provide balance in sentences\nJohn likes reading, his studies, and talking.\nCorrected: John likes reading, studying, and talking.\nWe were asked to calculate scores, record them, and putting them on the bulletin board.\nCorrected: We were asked to calculate scores, record them, and post them on the bulletin\nboard.\n56 Editing Tips\nThe science class had to dissect frogs or were experimenting with gases.\nCorrected: The science class had to dissect frogs or experiment with gases.\nTo check for parallelism, first circle or highlight every and or or to check for balance in\nthe sentence.

Make corrections to your list to create balance:\nreading, studying, and talking.\nOnce you fix a few sentences, problems with parallelism become easier to recognize and to\ncorrect!\n12.3 Editing Tips\n\"Bad spellers of the world, untie!\"\n--Graffito\nFigure 11 alt=A pair of glasses sitting on a computer keyboard.\nEditing is like going over your writing with a fine-toothed comb, scanning the surface and the\ndepths for errors, misstatements, and a lack of clarity. First, keep resources close. Gather\nyour writing handbook, dictionary, thesaurus, handouts, and any other editing resources\n57 Editing\nand keep them close. This way, you will not be tempted to guess at the correct way to do\nsomething. Instead, use your resources when you need them. Spelling errors can be avoided\nif you have a dictionary nearby. Don't rely on spell check. It will only correct the spelling,\nnot the proper usage of a word. For example, the word their means someone's possession\nof something. When used in a sentence, \"We sat in their chairs.\" On the other hand, there\nis used to express an area or place. When used in a sentence, \"We sat over there.\" Looking\nup these words in a dictionary will prevent unnecessary errors from occurring.\nSecondly, know your errors. Keep a list of the errors you tend to make next to a\ncorresponding list of corrections. No writer makes unique mistakes all the time; instead, our\nmistakes are habitual. Know what yours are by looking at your instructor\u2019s comments on\npast papers or by working with a writing tutor. That way, you can enhance your editing\nstrategies by watching specifically for these types of errors. If there are grammar rules you\nfind yourself looking up more frequently than others, write them down for future reference.\nThirdly, break it down. Edit one thing at a time. Instead of reading your paper through\nfrom start to finish once or twice and trying to catch everything, try searching for one thing\nat a time. For example, you might go through your paper once to tighten up wordiness.\nThen, read through a second time, while looking for one type of error which you frequently\nmake, suchascommasplices. Then, tryreadingathirdtimelookingforwordsthatmayhave\nbeen misspelled when you ran a spell check. Read a fourth time for another characteristic\nerror, such as subject-verb agreement.\nNext, reduce visual clutter. Use two pieces of blank paper to cover up everything but\none sentence at a time. This forces you to pay closer attention to the words because they are\nthe only thing you see. Normally, our eyes move all over a text as we are reading; this trick\nwill prevent that tendency. Lastly, work backwards. Read from the end of your paper to\nthe beginning, one sentence at a time. When we read in the conventional manner--top to\nbottom or left to right--we tend to read quickly and are constantly leaping ahead without\nreally focusing on the words. We tend to see what isn't there, because we know what it is\nsupposed to say. Reading backwards forces us to slow down, thereby allowing us to catch\nmore errors within individual sentences.\nWhen reviewing your work, it is also important to ensure that the tense you choose remains\nconsistent. Tense refers to the relation of details in the past, present, and future. For\nexample, one writer may tell a story about going to the mall in the present tense by saying,\n\"I am walking around the mall and I see my third grade teacher.\" Another writer may\nchoose to relate this story in the past tense by saying, \"I was walking around the mall when\nI saw my third grade teacher.\" Although it is important to select the tense that best suits\nthe particular context a writer is using, it is equally important to remain consistent with\nwhatever tense is chosen. Inconsistency within tense is extremely confusing for readers. It is\nimportant to review your use of tense to ensure that your language is clear. For example,\nif you were to say \"I was walking around the mall and I see my third grade teacher\" your\naudience would be very confused, wondering if you were seeing your teacher in the present\nor last week. By keeping your tense consistent your reader will always know when you\nexperienced what you're writing about.\n12.4 Perspectives on Style\n58 Perspectives on Style\n\"Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn.\"\n--Gore Vidal, American writer\nFigure 12 Gore Vidal at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, April 27, 2008.\nPrescription and description litter these pages and others. Some writers tell you how to\nwrite: how your writing should look, sound, and feel. These writers prescribe rules (writer's\nhandbooks are their bibles). Should you follow them? Prescription can be limiting. In\nsome instances, it may be profitable or necessary to follow a formula (when writing a legal\ndocument or a theme for your fifth grade teacher, for example). It is necessary to learn the\nrules, if only to break them. Rules are not static, however. They evolve. Rules are added,\nchanged, omitted. Current fashion is the only certainty.\n59 Editing\nOther writers describe how text is actually written. They analyze past and present text,\nhighlighting similarities, differences, and respective efficiency. They define goals and purpose.\nIt may be purposeful to apply rules, yet at other times it may not. But do not allow yourself\nto become limited by prescription.\nExamine your goal and determine the best approach to reach it.\nWhy discuss style in a section on editing? As you write, you make choices. As you\nedit, you examine the effectiveness of those choices. Some choices are more effective than\nothers and may reinforce your message. It all depends on your goal, your purpose, and your\naudience. Are you writing a birthday greeting or a dissertation? An instant message or a\npublic address? Your choices determine your text's effectiveness; they help relate meaning.\nAs you can imagine, there are as many perspectives on style as there are available topics for\nwriting. The following is an attempt to present some of those perspectives.\n12.4.1 Richard Lanham on Prose Styles\n\"You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style.\"\n--Vladimir Nabokov\nA book written by Richard Lanham titled Analyzing Prose is a great tool for writers looking\nto pick up ideas for new styles. Through this work, one can can gain techniques covering\nthe following styles:\n\u2022 Opaque and Transparent\n\u2022 Noun and Verb\n\u2022 Paratactic and Hypotactic\n\u2022 Periodic and Running\nLearning how to properly incorporate these styles into your own writing can transform your\nwork from everyday textbook style writing into colorful, creative, individualistic styles.\n12.5 External Links\n\u2022 English Writing Style3\n\u2022 Style Guide4\n\u2022 Rhetoricainc5\n\u2022 Our Own Online Rhetoric and Style Manual6\n\u2022 The Elements of Style7\n\u2022 Check-Sheet for Papers8\n3 http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/English%20writing%20style\n4 http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Style%20guide\n5 http:\/\/www.rhetoricainc.com\n6 http:\/\/cla.calpoly.edu\/~smarx\/courses\/134\/onlinerhetoricstyle.html\n7 http:\/\/www.bartleby.com\/141\/\n8 http:\/\/www.andrews.edu\/WC\/checker.html\n60 External Links\n\u2022 12 Common Errors: An Editing Checklist9\n\u2022 Revising vs. Editing10\nCategory:Rhetoric and Composition11\n9 http:\/\/www.wisc.edu\/writing\/Handbook\/CommonErrors.html\n10 http:\/\/jerz.setonhill.edu\/writing\/style\/rev-edit.htm\n11 http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Category%3ARhetoric%20and%20Composition\n61  13 Reviewing\n13.1 Overview of Reviewing\n\"No passion in the world is equal to the passion to alter someone else's draft.\"\n-- H.G. Wells\nSooner or later, someone is going to hand you a piece of writing and ask for your opinion.\nYou may be asked to review another student's essay as part of your class work. Perhaps a\nfriend or a younger brother or sister has come to you for help. If you develop a reputation\nfor being a good writer, then the chances are good that even your boss might ask you to\nlook over letters or policy statements and offer your professional opinion. In any case, if you\nreally want to do a good job in these situations, you're going to need reviewing skills. You're\ngoing to need to be able to identify problems, suggest alternatives, and, more importantly,\nsupport everything you say with reasonable claims. Furthermore, you must do all this in a\nconvincing way that makes the writer want to make the changes you suggest. You must\nknow what's wrong with a document, why it's wrong, and how to fix it.\nYou've probably heard the saying, \"A writer is his own worst critic.\" Whoever said this\nundoubtedly suffered from poor self-reviewing skills. After all, it's easier to spot problems\nin other people's writing because our own ego (or pride) doesn't get in the way. Another\nproblem is that sometimes we get so caught up in what we want to get across in our writing\nthat we don't pay enough attention to how we're expressing it -- a sentence that makes\nperfect sense to us might be total gibberish to someone else. Thankfully, these are all\nproblems that can be overcome. You can learn to fairly and accurately review your own\nwork. One way you can get better at self-reviewing is to spend time reviewing other people's\nwork. Eventually, you'll develop a knack for spotting errors that will serve you well as you\nedit and revise your own work.\nWriters, particularly new writers, often find that letting other writers review their work is\ntremendously helpful. Most universities have writing centers, where students can have their\nessays reviewed for free by experienced student writers or tutors. These tutors can work\nwith you one-on-one to help you improve your writing and earn better grades.\nYoushouldrealizethatreviewingyourwork, likeplanning, drafting, orrevising, isarecursive\nprocess. It is not something a writer does just at the end of his work. For instance, you may\nwant to write an introduction to an essay and have it reviewed by a teacher or classmate\nbefore trudging forward. If you're on the wrong track, you'd be better off knowing about it\nsooner rather than later -- especially if a deadline or due date is looming.\nIn the academic world, journal articles and books are nearly always \"peer reviewed\" before\nthey are accepted for publication. Sometimes these reviews are \"blind,\" meaning that neither\n63 Reviewing\nthe writer nor the reviewers know each others' identities. This process is meant to make the\nprocess fair and ensure that every scholar gets a chance to get her work published. Academic\nreviewers must evaluate a work, recommend that it be published or rejected, and (hopefully)\noffer the writer substantial advice about how his work can be improved.\nIn this chapter, we'll talk about how to develop the skills you'll need to become a star\nreviewer. We'll start by discussing \"criteria,\" or the standards you'll stick to when writing\nreviews. We'll talk about what to look for in a document and how to provide the very best\nadvice to the writer. Finally, we'll talk about how to handle criticism from reviewers who\nevaluate your work.\n\"You write to communicate to the hearts and minds of others what's burning inside you.\nAnd we edit to let the fire show through the smoke.\"\n-- Arthur Plotnik\n13.2 Establishing Criteria\nLet's suppose that you just gave your paper to your roommate and asked her to look it over.\nYou explain that you've been working on the paper for three days and that you really want\nto earn an A. \"I want your honest opinion,\" you say. \"Don't worry about hurting my feelings.\nWhat do you think?\"\nYou watch your roommate's face as she reads your paper. She grimaces. Laughs. Yawns.\nFinally, she hands you the paper back and says, \"This sucks.\"\nThis may be the type of \"review\" you are accustomed to receiving -- overly critical and not\nvery helpful. Perhaps you agree that your paper is in trouble and needs help, but without\na better understanding of what's wrong, you aren't likely to be able to do much about it.\nFurthermore, how can you trust your roommate's judgment of your paper? What if it just\nso happens that your roommate is neurotic about starting sentences with \"But,\" and, seeing\nsuch sentences in your paper, decided right there that the paper was terrible?\nUltimately, what makes an evaluation worthwhile is the soundness of its criteria. As a writer,\nyou want to know not just whether someone likes your paper, but also what factors they are\ntaking into consideration when they review your paper. Both the reviewer and the person\nbeing reviewed need to be as clear as possible about the criteria that will be used to evaluate\nthe work. Are your reviewers only looking at your grammar, or are they also determining\nthe rationality of your arguments? Does a comma splice make a bigger difference than a\nrough transition between paragraphs?\nAll of these matters should be spelled out clearly beforehand, either by the writer or the\nreviewer. As a writer, what are you personally working on? It's not a bad idea to think\nabout your strengths and challenges as a writer before handing over your paper to a reviewer,\nor to use work that has been returned to you in the past with feedback. For example, if\nyou're writing a paper for a professor you've had before, and who has made comments on\nyour past work, use those comments to provide your reviewer with a focus. If you are the\nreviewer in this situation, ask to see the assignment and rubric, if possible. You can also ask\nthe writer for specific guidelines, areas of greatest need, or even anything s\/he might know\nabout the grader. Is the person giving the grade unconcerned with punctuation conventions\n64 Writing Helpful Comments\nbut a martinet about tense shifting? The point is, the more focused the reviewer and writer\nare, the more effective the reviews are.\n13.3 Writing Helpful Comments\n\"Therearetwokindsofeditors,thosewhocorrectyourcopyandthosewhosayit'swonderful.\"\n-- Theodore H. White\nIn the example above, you were not able to gain any insights or knowledge from your\nroommate letting you know that your paper \"sucks.\" What you wanted was some kind of\nfeedback that would help you improve your paper, so you could get a good grade. You don't\nknow if your paper \"sucks\" because it lacked a strong thesis, if it sucks because your writing\nstrayed from the assignment, or if it sucks because of grammatical errors. You can be a\nbetter self- and peer-reviewer than your roommate was. Given the previous example, how\nhard can it be? When you're reviewing your own paper or the paper of a friend or classmate,\nask yourself a few questions:\nORGANIZATION\n1. What are your initial thoughts? What strengths and weaknesses does the paper have?\nWhat parts confused you, or might be confusing to other readers? What's the most\nimportant thing that the writer is trying to say?\n2. How is the paper you're reviewing organized? Again, does it start with the broad and\nmove to specifics? Do all sentences support the paragraph's topic sentence, and do all\nparagraphs support the thesis? Is there an Introduction that draws in the reader, or\ndoes it restate the assignment and become redundant? Is the paper organized in a\nway that will make sense to readers? Does the writer employ transitions effectively?\nDoes the paper flow from beginning to end?\nFOCUS\n1. Is the paper focused on the assignment? Does it follow the same thought throughout\nthe paper, or does it jump from subject to subject? Do I feel like I'm still learning\nabout\/thinking about the same subject at the end of the paper that I was at the\nbeginning of the paper?\n2. Try to paraphrase the thesis of the paper as a promise: In this paper, the writer will...\nDoes the writer fulfill his\/her obligation stated in the thesis?\n3. What's the writer's position on the issue? What words does the writer use to indicate\nhis\/her position?\nSTYLE\n1. In what style is the paper written? Does it work for the subject matter and\nassignment? Will the paper appeal to its intended audience? Is the writing at an\nappropriate level for the target audience?\n65 Reviewing\nDEVELOPMENT\n1. Does the title indicate what the paper is about? Does it catch your interest? Does the\nopening paragraph draw you in? If not, can you suggest a different approach to catch\nthe readers' attention?\n2. How is the development of the paper carried out? Does it start with a broad subject\nand then move to something more specific?\n3. Does the concluding sentence draw the argument of the paper to a close by bringing\ntogether the main points provided in the paper, or does it just end? Does the writer\nconclude in a memorable way, or does he\/she simply trail off? If the ending is too\nabrupt or too vague, can you suggest some other way to conclude the paper? Does\nthe ending introduce any new topics?\nCONVENTIONS\n1. Are common or appropriate writing conventions followed? Are grammar, spelling,\npunctuation and other mechanics observed?\nWhile reviewing the paper, make notes in the margins of any problems you find. If you\nbelieve that developing a paragraph a little bit more would be helpful to the argument,\nwrite <more>. If you are unclear of something, write <? not sure>. If you notice a missing\ncomma, insert it in the correct spot, but be sure to set it off somehow so that you or your\nfriend will notice the correction. If another word might work better, write <WC> to indicate\ninappropriate word choice.\nPlease note: It is important not to overwhelm your writer with comments. As much as\npossible, try to avoid repeating similar comments (e.g. don't correct every single comma\nerror you find). Also, althought it can be tempting to make some of the changes you suggest\nyourself, you never want to rewrite the work you are reviewing.\n13.4 Responding to Criticism\n\"I am forced to say that I have many fiercer critics than myself.\"\n--Irwin Shaw\nNobody likes to be told that what they are doing isn't right. But what separates good\nwriters from other writers is that good writers are able to take criticism, realizing that\nnobody is perfect, and use the criticism to help them, either with the assignment at hand,\nor with writing assignments in the future.\nIf your roommate tells you that your paper sucks, you probably want to ask him or her\nwhy it sucks. If your roommate says that you are continually writing run-on sentences1, ask\nfor advice on how to correct them or look in a writing guide to learn how to fix them. By\nhandling criticism constructively, you'll be more aware of your common errors and less likely\nto repeat them, or at least will know how to find and correct them the next time you write.\n1 Chapter 60 on page 279\n66 Peer Review Sample\nIf, while meeting with a tutor, you learn that you need further development of some of your\nideas for clarity, revisit your writing and judge for yourself whether or not you do. Ask\nyourself if you understand since you are the one who did all of the research and know what\nyou mean (probably a good indication that the tutor was right), or if you are comfortable\nthat a reader would understand what you are saying without more information.\nRemember: as the writer, you're in control of your paper. When people offer criticism,\nthey're usually just trying to help you. Try to keep that in mind. Take the suggestions when\nyou think they make sense, and discard the ones that don't.\n13.5 Peer Review Sample\nHere is an example of an essay submitted for peer review. The assignment is to write a\npaper about anything in nature: a plant, an animal, a natural disaster, anything. Practice\nreviewing with the steps mentioned above. What would you say to the author?\n67 Reviewing\nThe Jalapeno: an Ode.\nIn the backyard of my parent\u2019s house survives an ambiance of relaxation. An alluring pool\nhas been my oasis that anticipates the hot, yet hardly tormenting summer days (5). As I\nlook on, the pool\u2019s surface resembles a trance that sparkles and fades into my squinting\neyes. The gleaming blue and white water magnetizes me and nearly forces my body into my\nbathing suit, tanning lotion in hand. I race for my beach towels, usually the Budweiser one\nand the other that is striped with green and blue lines. I then carry a reclining chair and\nhead for the poolside, not far from the diving board, where the sun awaits me. With every\nthird or fourth step gracing the searing cement, I must dip my feet in the pool\u2019s merciful\nand cool dampness.\nWhen I arrive to my destination, with the shaded patio still in view, I unfold the towels and\nlay comfortably on the reclining chair. Beneath the sun and its warm smile, I feel its soft\nkiss upon my browning skin. I look to my right and see a competitive game of Scrabble in\naction amongst my family members. Nearby, my dog moseys on over to see if I will give him\na gentle pat, knowing all too well that the sun is beckoning. To my left, I gaze upon the\nintricately planted landscape. A few stubborn, yellow Tulips tend to show themselves from\ntime to time while sitting under a few hanging baskets that support brave pink and purple\nperennials. Surrounding them are many other bushes and plants hovering over aesthetic\nnight lamps (3).\nTo my front are the suspicious and rather bitter neighbors just past the determined fence.\nThe day is spent best without catching eyes with them (4). Behind me is the house that has\nkept watch over me for more than ten years. With its light gray siding and white shudders,\nit doesn\u2019t pose much of a threat but hardly as great of a caress as the yard I lay in. While\nthere are no trees in our backyard, our neighbor\u2019s trees lean over the fence gently as if their\nbranches were hands dipping themselves into holy water. Subtly, I glimpse upon a pair of\ndragonflies making love in midair. I become slightly jealous of their incessant nature. And\nno sooner is my comfort found that I bounce away from my chair at the sight of bees and\ntheir territorial buzz. More often than not, I am unharmed; however, their intimidating\npresence remains unpleasant in the heat (5). A gentle breeze will bless my begging and\nperspiring skin, but when it is callous, the pool invites me for a quick dive (3). The surface\nof the glistening mirage pierces slightly at my skin raising every hair but altogether swathes\nmy entire body. Cast into an oblivion, my hair swells like that of a mermaid\u2019s. Although\nmy lips are sealed, the chlorine finds a way to seep into my tongue (2).\nAs I surge back to the surface, my nose wrinkles blissfully at the scent of the chicken and\nsteak kabobs savored tenderly (5) with orange bell peppers, white onions, and plump, brown\nmushrooms (1). They cook patiently on the grill (3). Eager for dinner, I paddle myself to\nthe shallow end of the pool and lead myself up the stairs. The steadfast cement is back at\nmy feet. I quickly grab for my towels and head for the patio table that is secured by the\nrescuing shade. I faintly hear Led Zeppelin singing from the old, makeshift radio. I crack\nopen a mildly cool High Life that has been sitting on the table for some time and let the\nsour suds have their way. I grab a Marlboro, tuck it between my lips and strike a fast match\nat it. As the unrefined smoke dances past my fingers, I slowly breathe contently, gazing up\nat the tranquil sky, fully aware that this place has dependably masked my outside tides (3).\nSample: Backyard Bathing\n68 Peer Review Sample 2\nSample Comments: Here, the peer reviewer has made matched remarks to\nspecific sentences and passages in the essay and has included a more detailed\nglobal comment last.\n1. Describe the scent of the location\n2. Good descriptions of the essence of the back yard and pool\n3. Good use of personification and imagery\n4. Include more description of the neighbors\n5. Unnecessary descriptive words, particularly adjectives and adverbs\n6. You got some weedy adjectives and adverbs going on. EVERYTHING has been gilded\nand painted up; this is like the prose equivalent of RuPaul2 (the one on the left). Cut as\nmany adjectives and adverbs out as you can. In fact, I hate to say this, but don't \"describe\nthe scent of the location\" unless the scent of the location is important\/remarkable. Do I\ncare that you ate awesome kabobs? I might, if it's important\/remarkable in any way, but so\nfar, no. What this looks like to me is, somebody told you to write a descriptive scene, you\nthought, \"how pointless!\", so you wrote a descriptive scene with no point. Is there a reason\nto describe this backyard pool Eden? Did a murder happen there later on? Is that where\nyou first learned an Important Truth About Life? Are you going to get into a fist fight with\nthe neighbors? Is there, in short, anything interesting at all about it?\n13.6 Peer Review Sample 2\nHere is another example of an essay submitted for peer review on the same topic as Peer\nReview Sample 1. Again, practice reviewing with the steps mentioned above.\n2 http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Image:RuPaul.jpg\n69 Reviewing\nThe Jalapeno: an Ode.\nThe jalapeno\u2014 is it a tasty cooking element, or a national mystery? As a lover of all things\nspicy, I find myself asking questions about the nation\u2019s most elusive pepper: where did it\nget its name? Where did it originate from? What makes it so spicy? How and where does it\ngrow? And, most importantly, what kinds of food include the jalapeno? These questions\nare only natural to ask oneself when faced with the utterly fascinating pepper. However,\nthrough some difficult research, mental travel to the wild regions of the past, and a little\nbribery, the answers can and will be found.\nBut who to ask? If I lived in Texas I would ask Stacey Snow, Ms. Jalapeno 2005. She was\ncrowned Ms. Jalapeno at the 27th annual Jalapeno festival in Laredo Texas. This festival\nis featured on the travel channel, and is commonly known as the \u201chottest weekend of the\nyear.\u201d This festival has amazingly unique entertainment: the jalapeno egg toss, the blind\njalapeno toss, the jalapeno spitting contest, the \u201csome like it hot\u201d cook off, the land raft\nrace, the three-legged sack race, and a good old fashion game of tug-of-war.\nThe jalapeno is named after Jalapa, capital of Veracruz, Mexico. However, the jalapeno\u2019s\npopularity is not completely foreign. In 1995 New Mexico named the jalapeno the official\nstate pepper, with chili peppers and pinto beans as the state vegetable. The jalapeno is part\nof the chili pepper family. The family also includes anaheim, cayenne, poblano, and serrano.\nThe jalapeno is not native to Minnesota; in fact, it is not native to the United States. It is\nthanks to Christopher Columbus that we have the spicy treat. Still today the pepper is a\npopular favorite, with Texas producing half of the 14 million gallons of jalapenos produced\neach year in the United States. Jalapeno flavored potato and tortilla chips weigh in at 17\nmillion pounds produced each year.\nThe spicy bite in jalapenos can send tears down its consumer\u2019s face. This burning sensation\nis no accident; it is due to a chemical called capsaicinoids. There are five varieties, with\ncapsaicin being the hottest and most famous. The capsaicins in jalapenos give them the\nburningsensation. Whenthefireinthemouthsensationoccurs,thebrainreleasesendorphins\ninto the blood stream. These act as a natural pain reliever.\nThe jalapeno plant is pod-like, and usually grows from 2 to 3 feet tall. It is single stemmed\nand grows upright. Though there are literally countless forms of wild peppers, the jalapeno\nis considered a domestic plant. The pods are cylindrical, which flourish in semi-arid climates\nwith dry air and irrigation. The plant matures between seventy and eighty days generally\nproducing twenty-five to thirty-five pods per plant.\nJalapeno foods come in many shapes, sizes, and flavors. The most recent jalapeno phe-\nnomenon to hit the market is jalapeno jelly. Originally from Lake Jackson Texas, jalapeno\njelly was first marketed in 1978. This jelly is often lime-green, with a sweet flavor, and the\nsame consistency as normal jelly. It is fitting that this jelly originated from Texas, because\nthe jalapeno is the official Texas state pepper, along with the chiltepin; not so coincidentally,\nthese are the two peppers used in the states official dish: chili. Though there are many types\nof hot peppers, the jalapeno distinguishes itself in a number of ways. First, the jalapeno is\nmost often green when mature, and is about 2 inches long with cracks in the stem. The\nhotness is also immediate after a bite. The thing that makes the jalapeno so different from\nother foods is the cult phenomena surrounding it. Figurines, websites, and even academic\npapers have been formed on the jalapeno craze.\nMost important to the jalapeno are the recipes. Many wild jalapeno recipes do exist, with\njalapeno bread, jalapeno sauce, stuffed jalapenos, chicken and cream cheese with jalapenos,\ncoca-cola ham glaze with jalapeno, jalapeno martini, jalapeno hushpuppies, jalapeno souffl\u00e9,\njalapeno-basil vinaigrette, and tamale pie being just a select few. Dried jalapenos are known\nas chipotles, another common ingredient in many dishes. In Texas, people even go so far as\nto drink jalapeno coffee and jalapeno tea! Yuck!\n70Itissafetosaythatthejalapenoisbothatastycookingelementandanationalmystery. Any\ntimearecipeismade, thejalapenowillbethere. Maybenottoday, maybenottomorrow, but\nrest assured, someone, somewhere (probably in Texas), will add a jalapeno to it. However,\nthe day the jalopsicle becomes the most popular frozen treat, consider it the day we have\ngone too far. Peer Review Sample 2\nSample Draft\nSample Comments: Here, the peer reviewer has organized her\/his comments\nbased on the five criteria and has made specific references to sentences and\npassages where appropriate.\nORGANIZATION\n1. After the introduction paragraph, there is not much narrowing. The topic broadly\nseems to be jalapenos. Perhaps the writer could try picking one specific question and\nsticking to that.\n2. The organization needs to be improved. Perhaps repeating the questions would help,\nor as previously stated, sticking to the development of one specific question.\nFOCUS\n1. The paper seems to fulfill the assignment very well, but it does jump subject somewhat,\nparticularly beween paragraphs 3 and 4. I do like the theme of the jalape\u00f1o being\npresented as a national mystery; perhaps that could become the thesis statement.\n2. Unfortunately, he thesis of the paper doesn\u2019t seem to exist. The questions in the first\nparagraph gives the reader an idea of where the paper is headed, but there really is no\nstatement explaining what the writer is trying to prove.\n3. Does the author have a position? If he\/she does it must be that he\/she reveres the\njalapeno. There doesn\u2019t seem to be much controversy in here for the author to support\nor oppose.\nSTYLE\n1. The title is clever, but could be a little more specific. It isn\u2019t so much an ode, but\nmore of an investigation. However, it does catch interest.\n2. The style and tone are spot on. For the topic, which is not very serious, the laid back\nhumorous style seems to fit in very well.\nDEVELOPMENT\n1. This paper certainly has plenty of personality. The author has a nice balance of humor\nand information. However, I find myself getting lost in the middle. Perhaps if the\nauthor were to repeat a question at the beginning of each paragraph, the reader could\nbe remembered of what the thesis is.\n2. The conclusion is funny, but I don't think it really does its job; I find the last sentence\nespecially confusing and unconnected. Perhaps the author could keep what he\/she\nhas, but add in some more review of all the information that is covered.\nCONVENTIONS\n1. The conventions seem to be ok. BUT WHERE ARE THE CITATIONS??? The author\nneeds to develop ethos by sharing where her\/his information came from regarding\njalapenos.\n71 Reviewing\n13.7 External Links\n\u2022 The Peer Review As Per Wikipedia3\n\u2022 Friendly Advice for Reviews4\n\u2022 Peer Reviews: Responding to a Draft5\n3 http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Peer%20review\n4 http:\/\/ubinet.engr.uconn.edu\/usefullinks\/reviewing.html\n5 http:\/\/www.wisc.edu\/writing\/Handbook\/PeerReviews.html\n72 14 Revising\n14.1 Overview of Revising\n\"Rewriting is when writing really gets to be fun. . . In baseball you only get three swings\nand you're out. In rewriting, you get almost as many swings as you want and you know,\nsooner or later, you'll hit the ball.\"\n--Neil Simon\nSuccessful writers understand that revising is an integral part of the writing process. It is so\nimportant that most authors spend the majority of their time revising their texts. That\nrevising is a time-consuming and learned skill surprises many beginning writers because\nthey often describe revision as changing particular words in a sentence or scanning a text\nfor misspelled words or grammatical errors. Such changes correspond more appropriately\nto the term editing. To revise, however, is to significantly alter a piece of writing. While\nediting can be a part of this process, revising generally involves changes that concern bigger\nissues, such as content and organization. Alternately, while revising, a writer might notice\nthat an idea needs to be developed more thoroughly, another omitted. Or, the writer\nmight decide that rearranging paragraphs will provide clarity and support for his or her\nargument, strengthening the paper as a whole. Granted, writers will also change grammar\nand punctuation while revising, but if that is all they are doing then they are really just\nediting.\nThis chapter is meant to provide sound advice about the revising process.\n14.2 Differences Between Revising, Editing, and\nProofreading\nIt is important to note that revising, editing, and proofreading are very different processes.\nDespite the differences, however, they often overlap. They are being separated here for ease\nof explanation.\nRevising\n\u2022 Revising is done throughout the writing process, with special emphasis on the first few\ndrafts.\n\u2022 Focus = big issues\n\u2022 Audience\n\u2022 Organization\n\u2022 Content\n73 Revising\n\u2022 Support\n\u2022 Conclusion\nEditing\n\u2022 Editing is done throughout the writing process, with special emphasis on the middle and\nfinal drafts.\n\u2022 Focus = technical issues\n\u2022 Usage\n\u2022 Word choice\n\u2022 Transitions\n\u2022 Mechanics\nProofreading\n\u2022 Proofreading is reserved for the final draft.\n\u2022 Focus = mechanics and presentation\n\u2022 Spelling\n\u2022 Punctuation\n\u2022 Format\n\u2022 Typographical errors\n\u2022 Textual inconsistencies\n14.3 A Change for the Better\n\"I write one page of masterpiece to ninety-one pages of sh*t. I try to put the sh*t in the\nwastebasket.\"\n--Ernest Hemingway\nWriting is an intellectually challenging, and draining, activity -- writing well, that is. Putting\nideas on paper is a good start, but revising those ideas so that they are persuasive, cogent,\nand form a solid argument is the real work of writing. As you review what you have written,\nyou will undoubtedly see holes in your logic, sentences that confuse rather than clarify, and\nsentences and paragraphs out of place. Below are some helpful hints to consider as you\nanalyze and transform your paper.\n\u2022 Take a break. Looking at your paper later will help you see it from the point of view\nof the audience. A good rule of thumb is to wait at least a day before revising. Often,\nwriters look at their prose a day later and recognize significant flaws they would not have\nnoticed had they written their paper in one night.\n\u2022 Be your own critic. You are obviously your own best critic. When writing, most people\ndo not (and should not) turn in their first drafts. So take advantage of your first, second,\nand third drafts to write your opinions in the margins. Highlight the things you really\nlike, and circle the things you would like to change.\n\u2022 Read and re-read your paper. In the first read-through consider the overall purpose\nof the paper and whether it is expressed clearly. In the second read-through analyze\norganization, logical development, and correctness. Often, reading your text aloud reveals\nawkward phrasing, missing information, weak points, and illogical reasoning.\n74 Analyze Each Part of Your Paper\n\u2022 Put yourself in the shoes of your reader. Look at your work through their eyes. Keep\nin mind that, while you may know something about a topic and write about it with\nsupported research, your audience may be new to the topic. Being specific in your writing\nhelps clarify your message to audiences. Do not assume that your audience already knows\nwhat you know.\n\u2022 Cut unnecessary words. Inexperienced writers should be able to cut 20 percent (or more)\nof their prose. Look hard at each word, each phrase, and each sentence. Does each and\nevery one help you achieve your purpose? Does each sentence in a paragraph relate to\nthe main idea? If you are like most people, you will find unnecessary repetition rampant\nin your writing. Pruning the verbiage will result in leaner, tighter, and more forceful\nwriting. Remember E.B. White's mantra: \"Omit needless words. Omit needless words.\nOmit needless words.\"\n\u2022 Understand that revising your paper should not be the last thing you do -- revision should\nbe ongoing throughout the creation of a document.\nAfter doing all this by yourself, seek help from others. First, find an individual who knows\nabout the assignment, your intended audience, and the purpose of the essay. Then, share it\nwith someone who fits the description of the audience for whom the document is intended.\nAsk your readers if everything is clear and easily understood, if phrases are worded correctly,\nif the document is logically sound, etc. If you have other specific concerns -- Is the second\nexample effective? Does my conclusion resolve the paper nicely? -- ask your readers to direct\ntheir attention to those issues.\nAfter your have written your paper, return to the beginning to see how the end relates to\nthe beginning. Have you maintained the same tone and main idea throughout? Does the\nending reiterate your main idea without just summarizing what you've already said?\nIt is also oftentimes helpful to have someone read your paper aloud to you. This will force\nyou to go over the material more slowly and allow you another chance to absorb the content\nof the paper. When you read your own paper aloud you are more apt to read the paper as\nyou intended it to be read, as opposed to reading what is actually on the page.\nAfter going through the steps above and making changes as necessary, you should feel your\npaper is nearly complete. The content should be in place, and your text should make your\ncase clearly and forcefully. If you feel this is the case, you are ready to closely edit and\nproofread your text.\n\"Books aren't written; they're rewritten. Including your own. It is one of the hardest things\nto accept, especially after the seventh rewrite hasn't quite done it.\"\n--Michael Crichton\n14.4 Analyze Each Part of Your Paper\n14.4.1 Introductions\nWhen you look over the draft of your paper, the first thing you should focus on is your\nintroduction. Whether it is one paragraph or an entire chapter, the purpose of the intro-\nduction is to grab your readers' attention and make them want to know more about your\n75 Revising\nsubject. Does it? Make sure you draw your readers in from the beginning and follow with\nrelevant and interesting supportive information. If readers aren't intrigued from the very\nbeginning of the piece, they will quickly become distracted or bored and avoid reading any\nfurther. Read your introduction to a friend and judge how compelling it is based on his or\nher reaction.\nWhat is the difference between a good and a bad introduction? A bad introduction is\nmisleading, rambling, incoherent, boring, or so hopelessly vague that you know less about\nthe topic than you did before you read it. On the other hand, a good introduction gets\nto the point, gives the reader a reason to keep on reading, and sets the stage for a really\nexciting performance. An introduction is like a first impression; it is crucial to your image\nand, once presented, you never get a second opportunity. Your essay's introduction is your\nreader's first impression of your ability as a writer. Even if you are brilliant and have great\nideas, a muddy or boring introduction will turn away many of your readers.\nMake sure that you don't beat around the bush in your intro. If you have tedious openers\nsuch as \"in today's society\" or openers that merely relay what the assignment is, change it\nso that it instead states your argument up front and presents a clear thesis right away, then\nsubtly describe your paper's overall structure. Try summarizing every paragraph into one\nsentence each, then put them all together to see if your introduction covers each point. Your\nintroduction should state the issue at hand, establish your position regarding it, describe\nyour paper's organization, and identify the scope of your coverage. Let's take each of these\nin turn.\n14.4.2 Thesis Statements\nNext, make sure you have a clear thesis. Simply put, a thesis is your main point, the line\nof argument that you are pursuing in your essay. It should answer two simple questions:\nWhat issue are you writing about, and what is your position on it? A thesis statement is a\nsingle sentence (or sometimes two, which are combined using a semicolon or comma and\nconjunction) that provides the answers to these questions clearly and concisely. Ask yourself,\n\"What is my paper about, exactly?\" to help you develop a precise and directed thesis, not\nonly for your reader, but for you as well.\nHow can you be sure that your thesis is clear? Will your reader be able to identify it and\nsee that the rest of your paper is supporting your argument? Most American readers expect\nto see the point of your argument (the thesis statement) within the first few paragraphs.\nThis does not mean that you have to place it there every time. Some writers place it at the\nvery end, slowly building up to it throughout their work, to explain a point after the fact.\nOthers don't bother with one at all, but feel that their thesis is \"implied\" anyway.\nAvoid the \"implied thesis\" unless you are certain of your audience. Almost every professor\nwill expect to see a clearly discernible thesis sentence in the intro. Remember: The harder\nit is for you to write your thesis statement, the more likely it is that your entire essay is\nincoherent and unfocused. If you are having real problems crafting a good thesis statement,\nyou may need to start over, narrow your topic, or dig even more deeply into what you are\ntrying to say and write.\n76 Analyze Each Part of Your Paper\nA good basic structure for a thesis statement is \"they say, I say.\" What is the prevailing\nview, and how does your position differ from it?\nFollowing are some typical thesis statements:\n\u2022 Although many readers believe Romeo and Juliet to be a tale about the ill fate of two\nstar-crossed lovers, it can also be read as an allegory concerning a playwright and his\naudience.\n\u2022 The \"War on Drugs\" has not only failed to reduce the frequency of drug-related crimes in\nAmerica, but actually enhanced the popular image of dope peddlers by romanticizing\nthem as desperate rebels fighting for a cause.\n\u2022 The bulk of modern copyright law was conceived in the age of commercial printing, long\nbefore the internet made it so easy for the public to compose and distribute its own texts.\nTherefore, these laws should be reviewed and revised to better accommodate modern\nreaders and writers.\n\u2022 The usual moral justification for capital punishment is that it deters crime by frightening\nwould-be criminals. However, the statistics tell a different story.\n\u2022 If students really want to improve their writing, they must read often, practice writing,\nand receive quality feedback from their peers.\n\u2022 Plato's dialectical method has much to offer those of us engaged in online writing, which\nis far more conversational in nature than print.\n14.4.3 Position\nMake sure that your reader knows your position on the issue. This should be properly\nexpressed in your thesis, but check your entire introduction for \"wishy washy\" sentences.\nUnless you're only writing a summary, your introduction should make it clear how you feel\nabout the issue at stake.\nAvoid sentences or \"thesis statements\" such as the following:\n\u2022 Abortion is a very controversial issue in America.\n\u2022 Capital punishment is both good and bad.\n\u2022 This paper will present the pros and cons of modern copyright law.\nAre these examples stating an issue and taking a position, or merely stating what everyone\nknows already? Again, your reader should already know that the issue you're writing about\nis controversial, otherwise there would be little reason to write about it. Unless you've been\ninstructed to merely write a report or summary of an issue, assume that your professor\nwants you to take a position and defend it with the best evidence you can muster.\n14.4.4 Scope\nBesides explaining what your paper is about and your argument, an introduction may also\nstate what you will and won't cover. For instance, let's say your paper is about an issue\naffecting mothers infected with HIV. Your introduction should reflect this focus, rather than\npresent your paper as a general overview of HIV. If your scope isn't clear, then readers will\nconstantly wonder when you'll address the larger topic--or even assume you simply forgot to\ndo it.\n77 Revising\nLet'ssayyouwantedtowriteapaperthatarguedthatFordmakesbettercarsthanChevrolet.\nHowever, your introduction didn't mention Chevrolet at all, but instead had the line: \"Ford\nmakes better cars than any other car manufacturer.\" Your reader would quickly begin to\nwonder why you're not talking about Toyota or Nissan! Try to anticipate what your reader\nwill expect to see covered, and, if necessary, state it explicitly:\n\u2022 Although my topic is capital punishment, I will focus on one aspect of that larger issue:\nthe execution of convicts who are mentally ill.\n\u2022 Although we interviewed over two hundred doctors in our study, we will discuss only\nthree of them in detail here.\n\u2022 In the following essay, I will be discussing only the first edition of Leaves of Grass, and\nmy claims may or may not apply to Whitman's later editions.\n14.4.5 Body Paragraphs\nAs you build support for your thesis in the \"body\" paragraphs, always ask yourself if you are\nspending your readers' time wisely. Are you writing unnecessarily complex and confusing\nsentences, or using 50 words when 5 would do? If a sentence is already plain and direct,\nthere's no need to fluff it up. Flowery words and phrases obscure your ideas: when writing,\nbeing concise is key. For example, why write, \"Cats have a tendency toward sleeping most\nof the day\" when you could simply write, \"Cats usually sleep most of the day\"? How about\nchanging\"The12thdayofthemonthofApril\"to\"April12th?\"Trytopickoutsuchsentences\nand substitute simpler ones.\nBut wait--don't you need to inflate your text so you can meet the minimum word count?\nWouldn'titbebettertouse\"duetothefactthat\"for\"because\"and\"inadditionto\"for\"and,\"\nsince these phrases use far more words? Answer: NO. Any experienced reader will instantly\nsee through such a pitiful scheme and will likely become irritated by the resulting \"flabby\"\nprose. If you are having trouble meeting the minimum word count, a far better solution is\nto add more examples, details, quotations, or perspectives. Go back to the planning and\ndrafting stage and really ask yourself if you've written everything useful about a topic.\nOther students worry that their sentences don't sound smart enough. Compare these two\nsentences:\n\u2022 Do not ask what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.\n\u2022 Do not submit a query concerning what assets and benefits your country can bestow\nupon you and yours, but rather inquire as to what tasks or activities you yourself can\nperform and carry out that will be useful for the citizens of your own country.\nAlthough the second sentence is longer and harder to grasp, that doesn't make it more\nintelligent. In fact, it's far more impressive to write a complex thought in simple prose than\nvice versa.\nHow about your organization? From sentence-to-sentence, paragraph-to-paragraph, the\nideas should flow into each other smoothly and without interruptions or delays. If someone\ntells you that your paper sounds \"choppy\" or \"jumps around,\" you probably have a problem\nwith organization and transitions.\n78 Before and After Revision Examples\nKeep in mind that very few writers can write a well-organized paper in one draft. Instead,\ntheir first drafts are disorganized and even chaotic. It takes patience to sort through this\nmess, consolidating related ideas into coherent paragraphs and helping the reader to follow\ntheir train of thought without derailing. Compare:\n\u2022 Proofreading is an important step in the writing process. Read your paper aloud to catch\nerrors. Use spell check on your computer.\n\u2022 Proofreading is an important step in the writing process. One technique is to read your\npaper aloud, which will help you catch errors you might overlook when reading silently.\nAnother strategy is to use spell check on your computer.\nThe second example has better transitions between ideas and is easier to read. Note that\nthe example with better transitions is also longer. Good transitions can improve your style\nand help you reach the minimum word count!\n14.4.6 Conclusions\nAfteralltheworkyouhaveexertedonyourpaper, youwanttoendwithagood conclusion.\nThe conclusion and the introduction may be similar but may take several forms. Conclusions\nmay be a simple restatement of your thesis to reestablish what the entire paper is about.\nThey may also sum up your main points, reflect on the information presented, ask a thought-\nprovoking question, or present a \"call to action,\" telling your readers what you want them to\ndo with the information you have presented. Often, this choice will be determined by the\ngenre, audience, or purpose of your paper. Nevertheless, your conclusion should accurately\nreflect the paper's subject and provide the reader with closure.\nBe sure not to end a paper with new ideas or a thesis you have not already dealt with in\nthe paper.\n14.5 Before and After Revision Examples\n14.5.1 Example Before Revision\n79 Revising\nHousehold Chore Divisions When We Get Married\nMy mom does almost everything at our house. She cooks, cleans, does laundry, vacuums,\nand when my sisters and I were younger, she did most of the child care \u2013 not fair! My father,\non the other hand, clips the hedges, waters the lawn, and snow-blows the driveway. He\nmakes more money than my mom. My sisters and I take care of mowing the lawn, washing\ndishes, cleaning the bathrooms, and scrubbing the floors. I was interested to know how Pete\nand I will split chores once we are married because there (ideally) will not be as large of an\nearning gap between the two of us as there is between my parents.\nPete and I discussed and debated a lot as we went through the \u201clist of chores\u201d. I tried to\nstand my ground on percentages of time that I should do a chore unless Pete was able to\ngive me a reasonable explanation of why I should do a greater percentage of something than\nhe does; he did the same, and so this assignment was a great communication tool and gave\nus the opportunity to confer on possible problems which may occur somewhere down the\nroad.\nMy boyfriend Pete and I talk a lot about getting married. We are now college seniors, so it\njust seems like the next step in the progression of our relationship. We figure, however, that\nwe will wait until I am done with law school and he has his PhD before we do it. Although\nthat brings us to at least 6 years from now we agree that it will be better if we are financially\nstable before getting married.\nPete and I have decided to split chores almost evenly. I will be doing 44.43% of the total\nthings that will need to get done. He will be doing 43.24% of them. We decided that our\nson, who will be named Christian, was old enough to help with some of the chores. Some of\nthe other things, we decided, would be worth paying an outside source to do. Income tax\nreturns, for example, we concluded could be better and more efficiently taken care of by\na CPA. We found that I will be doing 50.25% of the housework, while Pete will be doing\n43.17%. We also found that I will be doing 10% of the occasional work while Pete will be\ndoing 63.33%. I will do 60% of the child care, and Pete will do 40%. I seem to be doing\nmore daily tasks, and Pete seems to be doing more occasional tasks.\nI think that this assignment was a good starting point for a discussion between Pete and\nmyself. I am going to be a lawyer and he is going to be a chemist. Both of our schedules\nwill be tight, and we will have to find a better compromise in real life then we did in our\nimaginary one. If we do not, neither one of us will be truly satisfied.\nFrom the results of this assignment, I will be doing more of the traditionally \u201cfemale work\u201d,\nand Pete will be doing more \u201cmale work\u201d. I think that our assigned careers play a part in\nthis but not as much as I would like. I think that although we have broken many of the\nstereotypes that control my parents, we are still following some of them. When I look over\nthe results it seems odd that Pete will be doing more of the ironing than I, but he taught\nme to iron and his job calls for more ironed clothes than mine. We also figured that he will\nhave a little more leeway on time as a manager than I will as a lawyer. Thus, he will be\ngetting the kids ready for school. We broke a couple of stereotypes, but we still have a ways\nto go before reaching equality.\nSample Essay\n14.5.2 Example After Revision\n80 Before and After Revision Examples\nHousehold Chore Divisions When We Get Married\nMy boyfriend Pete and I talk a lot about getting married.

The order of a few paragraphs was re-arranged. Notice how the focus changes\nperspective from the past to the present. It immediately centers and controls what\nthe author wants the reader to \"see\" and sets the tone for the rest of the essay. Also,\nnotice the way the author repeats the words \"Pete and I\" to keep the reader on track.\nNotice that the paragraph that was moved to the beginning provides a more solid\nintroduction. It immediately tells the reader why the rest of the essay is relevant.\nThe writer is considering getting married so it is a good time to talk about household\nchores. This puts the rest of the essay into context and helps orient the reader to what\nwill be coming and why the author wrote the essay. The concluding paragraph was\nalso rearranged and now offers a more accurate summary of the essay as a whole. The\nexample before the revision had a concluding paragraph that veered off topic to deal\nwith the idea of gender roles, which, although mentioned, is not the main idea.\n2. Punctuation was included inside of quotation marks rather than outside quotation\nmarks. This makes for easier reading and tells your reader\/professor that you are\nconscious of the proper technique when quoting, and keeps the clarity of the speaker\nconsistent.\n3. \"6\" was changed to \"six.\" Be aware of numbers in your writing. Generally, the rule is\nto spell out numbers one through nine and use numerals for numbers 10 or higher.\n4. Some material was added to the Example After Revision for clarity. When you believe\nsomething can be added or taken away to provide your reader with a better idea of\nyour meaning or thought process, do so. Clarity is extremely important when writing\na paper. If your reader becomes confused, this will damage the paper's effectiveness.\nDo your best to guide your reader, so there will be little to no re-reading and a grade\nto reflect this.\n14.6 External Links\n\u2022 18 Revising Tips1\n\u2022 Revision Checklist2\n\u2022 Paradigm Online Writing Assistant3\n\u2022 Revision: From First to Final Draft4\n1 http:\/\/www.rpi.edu\/dept\/llc\/writecenter\/web\/revise.html\n2 http:\/\/writingcenter.tamu.edu\/content\/view\/27\/14\/\n3 http:\/\/www.powa.org\/revising\/\n4 http:\/\/www.hamilton.edu\/academics\/resource\/wc\/Revision.html\n82 15 Publishing\n83  16 Overview\n\"It is now possible for any writer with a book to get it published at nominal cost or free,\nand to have it on sale at booksellers like Amazon.com.\"\n--Piers Anthony\nAll authors who publish books and articles have at least one thing in common: they believe\ntheir work is interesting, desirable, or useful to other people. Many texts, such as this\nRhetoric and Composition wikitext, are published online and are available for free, without\nany paid authors or editors. Although many authors and readers prefer print publications,\nit is now entirely possible to earn a good living writing exclusively for the web.\nGetting published may seem unlikely or even impossible, but there are readily available\nresources to help you. If you are interested in freelance writing for magazines, the Writer\u2019s\nMarket is probably one of the most accessible and helpful sources (see below). If you are\ninterestedinpublishingscholarlyorprofessionalresearch, youwillneedtofamiliarizeyourself\nwith the journals and book publishers associated with your field.\nIt is very important to know a publisher's expectations before sending them a manuscript.\nPaycloseattentiontothepublisher'spolicies;somedonotacceptanyunsolicitedmanuscripts,\nand many have strict rules about formatting, subject matter, and deadlines. Don't waste\ntime and money sending out manuscripts that are certain to be rejected.\nIf you want to send an idea for a potential article or book to an editor, you may do this\nin a query letter. A query letter should be short and to the point. The point is to interest\nthe editor into buying your idea or article or at least requesting a book proposal or entire\nmanuscript. Included in a query letter is a strong opening lead about the article, book, or\npiece, a description of the development or structure and content, any other information or\nimages you intend to include, why you are qualified to write the piece, and a solid closing\nrequesting to write or submit the piece. It would be wise to include a deadline for reply.\n85  17 Types of Publication\nThe first thing you should do is figure out what type of publishing venue is appropriate for\nyour needs.\n17.1 Do-It-Yourself Print Publishing\nPrint publication is the oldest and most traditional way to earn a living as a writer and\nflourish as an academic. Unfortunately, printing books is an expensive process, and you may\nfind it difficult to interest a publisher in your work. Anyone, however, can pay out of pocket\nto have a book published by a vanity press. The results are often quite good, with a slick\nand glossy production that is indistinguishable from other books. If you have a manuscript\nwith very limited commercial appeal (such as a history of your family or hometown), or\nwant to control the marketing of the book yourself, a vanity press may be the way to go.\nCosts vary depending on the size and types of illustrations used in the book.\n17.2 Academic Publishing\nAcademic publishing is how scholars share their research and critically review other works.\nThis type of publishing includes academic journals and books in the sciences and humanities.\nYou are probably most familiar with academic journals in electronic form, since many\ncollege libraries offer access to extensive databases of journal articles in electronic form,\nsuch as JSTOR and Elsevier's Science Direct. Categories for journals range from physics\nand geometry to education and art, but all are written for other scholars in a particular\nfield. Authors are rarely paid for publishing articles in academic journals--the reward comes\ninstead in the form of increased prestige or a promotion.\n17.3 Commercial Publishing\nCommercial publishing means writing for profit and is the way the majority of professional\nauthors earn their living. Commercial publication can include books, articles, journals,\nmagazines, and more. If you want to become a professional author, you should research the\npublishers who publish in your fields of interest. Familiarize yourself with their titles and\nconsider how your work will complement their existing selections. Visit their websites or call\nthem to learn how they solicit manuscripts. Some will only accept manuscripts delivered to\nthem by agents. In any case, you will need to convince the publisher that your work has\ncommercial value and an adequate audience of potential readers.\n87 Types of Publication\nWriter\u2019s Market is a well-known resource for freelance writers. It offers market information,\ntipsforgettingpublished, advicefromagentsandeditors, andformattinginformation. These\nservices are available in the Writer's Market book and at WritersMarket.com1. There is an\nannual or monthly fee for online access.\n17.4 Electronic Publication\nPublishing your work online can take many forms, such as blogs, wikis, Adobe PDF files,\ne-books, and so on. There are plenty of easy ways to make your works available online for\nfree, but earning a profit on them is a different matter. The Amazon Kindle and Apple iPad\nhave opened up new opportunities for writers and publishers interested in selling electronic\nworks. Also, many formerly print-based newspapers and magazines now offer websites,\nmany with original articles published exclusively online. Search the websites for information\nabout submitting a manuscript or query. While the pay is unlikely to match that of print\npublications, there are still plenty of opportunities to support yourself as a freelance author.\nFreelance Writing\nWriting, unfortunately, cannot always be done simply for the love of writing. Unless one\nhas a wealthy spouse or a bursting portfolio, spending a significant amount of time writing\nrequires that you treat it like a business. The freelance writer must be part writer, and part\nbusiness-person. In fact, when considering everything involved in maintaining a living as a\nfreelance writer, the career is similar to that of a small-buisness owner. It involves secure\njobs, setting prices, and negotiating skills.\nThis lifestyle may conjure up images of endless travel and world experience, but the fact\nis, you never get a paid vacation. Writing for publication results in jobs being canceled,\npayment delays, and payment shortcomings. One must be very careful in factoring the\namount of money he\/she will receive each month, as it can sometimes take months to get\npaid.\n1 http:\/\/www.writersmarket.com\/\n88 18 Your Rights\nAs a writer seeking publication, you should know your rights. Anything you write is\nautomatically protected by copyright--no one else is permitted to publish it without your\npermission. When you find a publisher, you will likely sign a contract that transfers some or\nall of your copyright to the publisher. Contracts can be confusing and difficult for authors to\nunderstand; it is often worth finding an agent who can negotiate contracts with publishers\nto better suit your interest. Many terms of a contract can be negotiated, such as how long\nthe publisher retains exclusive rights to publish your work, what media they can use to\npublish it, or even who controls the movie or television rights.\nThere are also alternatives to standard copyright, such as Creative Commons1 licensing.\nCreative Commons licenses vary in scope and coverage, but the basic idea is that anyone is\nallowed to copy and distribute your work without getting your permission first.\n1 http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/\n89  19 External Links\nThere are plenty of websites dedicated to supporting aspiring writers of all types.

Now it's time to\nshift gears and start thinking about the kinds of assignments you're likely to encounter in\ncollege. Each \"writing mode\" requires a different mode of thinking, and that's why teachers\nand professors often ask for different kinds of writing (they want you to think about a\nsubject in a variety of ways). But generally, assignments will require you to apply several\nmodes, simultaneously, to accomplish a well-rounded body of writing. Few professors beyond\nthe first-year level of coursework require an assignment that merely focuses on description\nor narration; other modes are required to generate a well-rounded piece of writing that\nentertains, informs, and persuades (i.e., narrative, explication, argument).\nMost of the time, you'll find yourself switching among all of these modes as you write. You\nwould have a hard time, for instance, reviewing a car without spending any time describing\nit, and the strength of an argument depends on how well you've evaluated its evidence.\nWhat's important is that you recognize the difference between them. Many students lose\npoints each year when they offer their teacher a description instead of the evaluation or\nargument called for by the assignment. Below, we first give you some hints about analyzing\nassignments to find out what different types of writing task you need to do. Then, we break\ndown some common writing modes, telling you their characteristics and what makes them\nunique, then offer examples of informal and formal writing that show them in action.\n21.1.1 How to analyze an assignment\nWriting successfully for your college classes depends a lot on finding out as much as possible\nabout what you need to do to fulfill the assignment each time you write. While many\ninstructors try hard to clarify their expectations, the final responsibility for making sure\nyou know what it takes to fulfill an assignment is yours. Be your own advocate!\nThis chapter1 will give you strategies for interpreting assignments successfully and break\ndown eighteen words commonly used in assignments to help you understand what critical\nand writing tasks you need to do.\n21.1.2 Description\nOne key difference between a good writer and a bad one is the ability to write vivid, detailed\ndescriptions. What does something look like? Sound like? Feel like? Good descriptions\n1 Chapter 22 on page 99\n95 Overview of Writing Applications\nmake all the difference when you're trying to hook readers and keep them interested. We\ndon't want to read, \"The house was scary.\" We want to read a great description of the\nhouse that actually makes us feel that fear for ourselves. This can only be accomplished by\nobservant writers who are willing to \"show\" as well as \"tell\" their readers about their subject.\nThis chapter2 will introduce you to description and offers some good advice about writing\nhighly descriptive essays.\n21.1.3 Narration\n\"Narrative\" is really just a fancy way of saying \"story.\" When you are narrating, you are\ndescribing an event, step-by-step, usually in the order that it happened. In other words, a\n\"narration\" is a \"description\" of something taking place in time. As you can probably guess,\nnarration and description are highly related. You can't narrate very well if you lack the\nability to describe accurately and vividly what is taking place.\nThis chapter3 will introduce you to narration and some strategies for telling good stories.\n21.1.4 Exposition\nExpositorywritingiswritingthatexplainsorinforms. Youmayencounterexpositorywriting\nin an assignment that has you describing a process or developing a set of clear instructions.\nYou aren't just describing a \"what\" (\"What is fishing?\") but explaining a \"how\" (\"How do you\nfish?\"). Writers with excellent exposition skills are generally good learners, since describing\nprocesses well requires a thorough understanding of the process.\nThis chapter4 offers tips and suggestions for expository writing and some helpful examples.\n21.1.5 Evaluation\nMagazines like Consumer Reports and movie reviewers like Roger Ebert are famous for the\nquality of their evaluative writings. They give people the information they need to determine\nif a car is worth buying or a movie is worth seeing. You'll also find lots of evaluations in\nbusiness, in which they are used to determine an employee's eligibility for promotion or a\nmanager's effectiveness at overseeing an important project.\nThis chapter5 will tell you all about evaluative writing and the strategies you'll need to do\nit right.\n21.1.6 Argumentation\nSome people think of arguments as a lot of shouting and cursing (but that's not what\ncollege professors mean when they use the term \"argumentation\"). What they have in mind\n2 Chapter 23 on page 107\n3 Chapter 24 on page 117\n4 Chapter 25 on page 123\n5 Chapter 26 on page 129\n96 Overview\nis a clear-headed, logical, and convincing style of speaking or writing that makes a valid\npoint and supports it with good evidence. An argument isn't just summarizing or restating\nwhat others may have said about an issue. You'll need to research the issue, evaluate the\nevidence, reachaconclusion, figureoutthebestwaytosupportit, andarrangeyourthoughts\neffectively. Writing a good argumentative paper is probably the most difficult of all types of\nwriting assignments, but we'll give you advice and discuss some strategies that will get you\non the right track.\nThis chapter6 describes what college professors mean by the term \"argumentation,\" and\ndiscuss some methods that will earn good grades on these common but challenging assign-\nments.\n6 Chapter 27 on page 133\n97  22 Analyzing Assignments\n22.1 Snowflakes, Fingerprints, and Assignments\nWriting assignments in college differ as much as instructors. There is no one guidebook,\napproach, or set of rules that college teachers will consult when putting together their\ncoursework. Since each assignment will always be unique, it is important to devote time to\nthoroughly understanding what is being asked of you before beginning. Don't wait until\nthe night before the work is due to begin asking questions and delving in. The sooner\nyou understand and approach the assignment's requirements, the less time you will spend\nsecond-guessing (and needlessly revising) your writing.\n22.2 Analyzing an Assignment\nYou will likely encounter many different kinds of writing assignments in college, and it would\nbe nearly impossible to list all of them. However, regardless of genre, there are some basic\nstrategies one can use to approach these assignments constructively.\n\u2022 Read the assignment sheet early and thoroughly. An assignment sheet may be\nlengthy, but resist the temptation to skim it. Read every word. It would be unfortunate\nto hand in an incomplete or misguided assignment because you did not properly read and\nunderstand the guidelines. Since you can easily overlook details on the first reading, read\nthe assignment sheet a second time. As you are reading, highlight areas where you have\nquestions, and also mark words you feel are particularly important. Ask yourself why\nyour professor has given this assignment. How does it relate to what you are studying\nin class? Pay attention to key words, such as compare, contrast, analyze, etc. Who\nis your audience? Should the paper be written in a formal or informal tone? Is there\ndocumentation required? If a specific number of sources are required, how many must be\nbooks vs. online sources? What type of citation is called for: APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.?\nIs there a page or word count minimum\/maximum? Are you required to submit a draft\nbefore the final copy? Will there be peer review?\n\u2022 Get answers to your questions. After thoroughly reading the assignment sheet, you\nmight not have questions right away. However, after reading it again, either before or\nor after you try to start the assignment, you might find that you have questions. Don't\nplay a guessing game when it comes to tackling assignment criteria--ask the right person\nfor help: the instructor. Discuss any and all questions with the person who assigned the\nwork, either in person or via email. Visit him or her during office hours or stay after\nclass. Do not wait until the last minute, as doing so puts your grade at risk. Don't be\nshy about asking your professors questions. Not only will you better your understanding\nand the outcome of your paper, but professors tend to enjoy and benefit from student\n99 Analyzing Assignments\ninquiry, as questions help them rethink their assignments and improve the clarity of their\nexpectations. You likely are not the only student with a question, so be the one who is\nassertive and responsible enough to get answers. In the worst case scenario, when you\nhave done all of these things and a professor still fails to provide you with the clarity you\nare looking for, discuss your questions with fellow classmates.\n\u2022 Writing Centers. Many colleges and universities have a writing center. Tutors are\nhelpful consultants for reviewing writing assignments both before and after you begin. If\nyou feel somewhat confident about what you need to include in your writing assignment,\nbring your completed outline and\/or the first draft of your paper together with your\nassignment sheet. Tutors can also review your final draft before its submission to your\nprofessor. Many writing centers allow you to make appointments online for convenience\nand may also have \"walk-in\" availability. It is a good idea to check out the available\noptions a week or so in advance of when you will actually need the appointment, or even\nlonger if it will be during mid-term or finals week.\n\u2022 Create a timeline. Set due dates for yourself, whether they be to have a topic picked\nor a whole rough draft completed. Procrastination rarely results in a good paper. Some\nschool libraries offer helpful computer programs that can create an effective assignment\ntimeline for you. This is a helpful option for new, inexperienced writers who have not yet\nlearned the art of analyzing assignments, and who are not familiar with the amount of\ntime that is required for the college writing process. Remember, late papers may or may\nnot be accepted by your instructor, and even if they are your grade will likely be reduced.\nDon't sell yourself short with late submissions.\n100 Prewriting and Brainstorming\n22.3 Prewriting and Brainstorming\nFigure 13 Prewriting Analysis\nEvery writing assignment from every discipline requires the formulation of complex ideas.\nThus, once the assignment guidelines have been thoroughly considered, you should begin\nto explore how you plan structure your work in order to meet them. While this is often\nconsidered to be the start of the writing process, it is also an essential part of assignment\nanalysis, as it is here that the assignment is broken down into the most digestible parts.\nSuch a process can be done either individually or in a group, depending on the situation.\n101 Analyzing Assignments\n\u2022 Prewriting. The first and foremost stage of the individual writing process is that of\nPrewriting. Often overlooked by inexperienced writers, this is essentially the architectural\nstage of the writing\/analysis process, where the foundations of an assignment are first laid\nout and constructed. Free-writing, outlining, diagramming, and mapping are all possible\napproaches to this stage of development, where the goal is to organize one's ideas around\nthe requirements of the task at hand. Many people begin this right on the assignment\nsheet, as it can be helpful to highlight what the instructor is specifically asking for while\nsimultaneously adding one's own understanding to the ideas. Eventually though, you\nwill want to move to a separate page. If you are free-writing, you should start by writing\nout an assignment related question or main concept, and then proceed to freely (with or\nwithout punctuation or formality) write anything that comes to mind in relation to it. If\nyou are outlining, you are essentially breaking down the main ideas of the assignment and\nyour response to them in a linear format (by paragraph, subject, section, subsection etc.).\nIf you are diagramming, your prewriting can take many different forms, but always as a\nvisual representation of your response to some\/all of the assignment constituents. Lastly,\nif you are mapping, you are essentially outlining in a more visual way, using both linear\nand non-linear representation to organize your ideas about the assignment. Research can\nalso be conducted during this stage of the writing\/analysis process, as it is sometimes\nhelpful to know more about a topic before you make the commitment to writing about it.\nYou may even choose to use more than one of these approaches if you find it helpful in\ndeveloping your understanding of the assignment.\n\u2022 Brainstorming. Similar to prewriting, brainstorming takes place in the space between\nanalysis and drafting, the difference being that brainstorming generally involves group\ndiscussion. The size of a brainstorming group varies according to task, but ideally consists\nof smaller odd numbers (3, 5, or 7) when there is no assigned mediator present. There\nare obviously many pitfalls to such group discussion, and many divergent possibilities\n(distractions, freeloading, repetition, etc.) that can lead to counter-productivity. Nonethe-\nless, if all members are devoted to the task of analysis and development, the variety of\nperspectives can prove to be most rewarding. If all goes well, each member of the group\ntakes turns posing questions related to the assignment being discussed, to which the other\nmembers respond openly and freely. When positive attitudes and constructive criticism\ncan manage to be maintained, each member of the group will have his or her own critical\nthinking expanded upon and enriched by the understanding of the other group members.\n22.4 Sample Assignments\nAs discussed earlier, instructors will come up with any number of assignments, most of\nwhich will stress different types of composition. In each section below, there are sample\nassignment directions and suggestions on how to proceed. What follows is not meant to be a\ncomprehensive list of assignments, but rather a short list of the most common assignments\nyou can expect to see in an introductory English course. Many assignments not listed here\nare simply creative variations of these basic directives. For example, you could approach a\nvisual analysis the same way you would a rhetorical analysis; an argument paper is similar\nto a research paper, perhaps with a shorter argument. The techniques you use in writing a\nnarrative can also translate into writing a short story or observational essay.\n102 Sample Assignments\n22.4.1 Research Paper\nForthispaper, youwilltakeapositiononatopicofeitherlocalornationalinterest. Research\nthe topic thoroughly, making sure you know all sides of the debate, and decide what your\nposition will be.\nYour task is to write an 8 to 10 page research paper convincing your audience of your\npoint of view. You are required to use at least 8 sources, 4 of which should be scholarly\n(peer reviewed). You will use MLA format for your in-text citations and Works Cited page.\nRemember, the key to a good debate is knowing the opposition. Therefore, some of your\nsources and paper should be dedicated to such. Use this as an opportunity to show how\nyour viewpoint is conclusive.\nYou will likely have to write a research paper of a significant length during college. Students\nare usually overwhelmed by the page count and the struggle to come up with a paper topic.\nSometimes, in an attempt to make sure he or she reaches the page minimum, students\nchoose very broad research categories like welfare or the death penalty. Believe it or not,\nthese extensive topics generally do not make for great papers, simply because there is too\nmuch information to cover. Narrow topics allow for more in-depth research and writing.\nChoosing a topic takes time and research, so don't be surprised if your instructor requires\nyour topic ahead of time. This is to make sure you do not leave all of your research until\nthe last minute. Look online for topics that interest you and write down a few notes about\nwhat is going on in that field. Since a research paper generally involves an argument, you\nmust pick a topic that has two sides. One-sided, fact-based arguments such as \"smoking is\nbad for your health,\" are not suitable for research papers.\nLook at the assignment sheet for key words. What is the purpose of the paper? To\nargue. What are your requirements? Not only are there page requirements, but also source\nrequirements. What are scholarly sources? How do you judge the credibility of a source?\nAre you familiar with MLA?\nThere is one mistake that is very easy to make: confusing an argumentative research\npaper with an expository one. Don't let your argumentative research paper become an\ninformational report where you simply list information on a topic (expository writing).\nUnless explicitly stated, that is not your assignment.\n22.4.2 Narrative\nA narrative can be defined as a story or account of an experience or event. Think of a\nmoment or experience that you found to be particularly important, meaningful, humorous,\netc., and describe this event. Events do not have to be extraordinary large or dramatic to\nbe important and fun to read--a snapshot of what happened while you were sitting at a\nstoplight can be just as entertaining as a story about being in a tornado.\n103 Analyzing Assignments\nNarratives are a favorite first assignment for instructors, as it is assumed that most people\nfind it easiest to write about what they are familiar with. At the same time, the idea of\nself-reflective writing can be very intimidating. Most students have fantastic stories to\ntell, but inevitably edit themselves too early by worrying that their stories might not be\n\"important\" enough.\nHowever, the assignment clearly states that you should not worry about your narrative\nconcerning a large event. One of the key words is \"describe.\" Therefore, the most important\npart of the assignment is your use of description (\"show, don't tell\"). Prewrite and describe\na few ideas you might want to talk about. Pick one of them and start writing down as\nmany descriptive details as you can think of about the event. Who were you with? Where\nwere you? What was the weather like? What did the building look like? What were you\nthinking? How did you feel? What did you learn? Recording these concrete details will\nhelp guide you through your narrative. Don't forget to include as many sensory perceptions\n(taste, touch, sight, sound, and smell) as possible to paint the clearest picture of what you\nare trying to describe to your reader.\nAt this point, you still might be worried about the \"importance\" of the story. While it is\ntrue that your story should come to some sort of point, themes usually develop naturally in\na story. If you begin your story with an agenda, you'll often find yourself describing the\ntheme and not the event itself. Allow the themes to develop, and do not try to force them\nunto the page.\n22.4.3 Rhetorical Analysis\nA rhetorical analysis calls for students to closely read a text and determine several char-\nacteristics about it (author, context, purpose, emotional appeal\/effects, etc). For this\nassignment, you will read \"A Modest Proposal\" by Jonathan Swift and write a rhetorical\nanalysis. Remember, this is not a reflection piece, but rather a deep look at the tone, style,\nand intended audience, as well as ethos, logos, and pathos.\nAt first, a rhetorical analysis sounds somewhat difficult. However, analyzing just means\nmaking a conscious effort to read each word carefully and think about what the author is\ndoing. The first step would be to read the piece, not once, but two or three times. Highlight\nimportant passages and take notes. For this assignment, the instructor wanted students\nto write about ethos, logos, and pathos, which are rhetorical terms you should become\nfamiliar with. Pay attention to specific word choices that may evoke emotion, or any facts\nthe author may have put forward in the text. Look at the background of the author as\nwell as the time period in which he or she was writing. Consider the tone of the piece. Is\nit formal\/informal\/serious\/humorous? These are all things to keep in mind while reading.\nMake an ongoing list of the author's rhetorical techniques that you may want to discuss in\nyour paper.\nRemember to be mindful of your essay's organization. It is easy to discuss three different\ntopics in one paragraph and jump back and forth from one idea to the next, but this makes\nit difficult for your reader to follow. Also, do not forget that this is not a reflection. For this\n104 Finishing the Assignment\nassignment, the instructor isn't concerned with your reaction to the text, or your ability to\nsummarize; he or she wants to gauge your analytical skills.\n22.4.4 Summary\/Response Paper\nRead Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"Letter from Birmingham Jail.\" Give a brief summary of the\narticle and a response. Cite specific examples and avoid generalizations.\nBefore writing a summary, it is important to use your critical reading skills. First, read the\narticle carefully. It might help to write down the main point of each paragraph in the margin\nnext to it. Next, reread the article and look carefully for the main points the author is trying\nto get across. Look for things the author states explicitly, as well as what is implied by\nthings that are not clearly stated. Look for any biases or missing information. Ask yourself\nquestions while you read, such as \"what is the big picture here? What is the author really\ntrying to get across with this or that example?\" The title will often provide a clue about\nthe author's main point. Most of all, slow down and take the time to reread the article\nseveral times. In summarizing an article, think about how you would explain its message to\nsomeone who hasn't read it. What are the main points of the piece? What is necessary to\nknow about the work in order to understand it?\nWhile writing a summary is a familiar assignment from grade school, in college, summaries\nare no longer enough, and instructors will frequently require a response. Writing a response\nis giving your opinion about the text. However, statements such as \"I did\/did not like it\"\nare not sufficient. Not only must you be more descriptive with your opinions, but you need\nto support them. If you do not think that an author provided enough information to prove\nhis or her point, state the specific flaws and what could be done to improve them. The same\nrule applies for any emotions felt while reading the text. Instead of just saying the writing\nmade you sad, point out a specific passage in the text that made you feel that way. Talk\nabout the word choices the author used and how that affected your reading.\nIt is important to note the word \"brief\" in the assignment sheet. The instructor does not\nwant a two-page summary and then a paragraph of reflection. Your response should take up\nthe bulk of the paper.\n22.5 Finishing the Assignment\nRemember, no matter what the assignment, identifying key words in guidelines can help\nyou determine what type of thinking and ability the professor wants you to demonstrate.\nThe following six areas of competencies are from Bloom's Taxonomy.

Proofread your paper multiple times before handing in the final copy.\n106 23 Description\n23.1 What is Description?\nDescription is the process by which a writer describes things he or she senses in order\nto communicate those senses to the reader. Descriptive language frequently makes use of\nsensory language, or language that appeals to one or more of the five senses (touch, sight,\nsmell, taste, and sound). As a descriptive writer, the more vividly you are able to describe\nwhat you have sensed, the more engaged audience will be with your text.\nGrammatically speaking, descriptive language is the use of nouns and adjectives in order to\nmost specifically describe the experiences of a particular sense. By making the language you\nuse more powerful, you may use description in order to allow your reader to truly sense what\nyou are writing about. To this end, one of description's main goals is making the abstract\nseem more concrete.\nSpecific descriptive language has uses outside of describing sensory experience. For example,\nthe abstract idea of freedom may have many evoke different definitions and feelings for\ndifferent readers, but when described in terms of the freedom given slaves through the\nEmancipation Proclamation the idea of freedom becomes much more concrete and more\nuniform among readers. Description is used by writers in order to encourage their audiences\nto have a more specific reading of a text.\n23.2 Why Write a Descriptive Essay?\nA descriptive essay allows writers to engage their reader through the use of specific language\nand imagery. If the writer is trying to convey something that is scary or exciting, a concrete\ndescriptionisusuallymoreeffectivethanavagueorabstractone. Theseconcretedescriptions\ncreate specific, vivid images in readers' imaginations. Think of a descriptive essay as being\nsimilar to writing a movie. At no time can a movie show beautiful. It must show what\n'beautiful' is through the use of images.\nA writer usually begins an essay with an objective. If a writer wanted to persuade the reader\nthat ice cream is a tasty treat, what are descriptions that could cause the reader to want to\neat ice cream? Would sweet sound appetizing? Would comparisons to other foods, such as a\ncherry, be used to convince the reader that the ice cream is worth trying? When you have\nbegun to think in this fashion, then you are ready to start your essay.\n107 Description\n23.3 Abstract Descriptions Versus Concrete Descriptions\nTry to avoid vague, abstract descriptions. For example, a writer may write beautiful to\ndescribe a tree. However, beautiful is too vague. Instead, a concrete adjective or modifier\nwould be stronger and gives greater impact. The reader needs details for a picture to form\nin their heads, abstract concepts like beautiful lack a real-world analog. Here's a reworked\ndescriptionofthetree: \"thesun'sraysglistenedofftherain-slickleaves, evenastheafternoon\nsky dipped towards evening.\" The beautiful qualities of the tree are \"shown\" through concrete\ndetails instead of merely told through abstraction. This gives the reader the illusion of\nimmediate experience, as opposed to the dictionary variety\nAbstract Descriptions\nFigure 14 How would you use concrete language to describe this \"cute\" dog?\n108 Similes and Metaphors\nAbstractions are often ideas that cannot be seen, heard, touched, or smelled.\nExamples of abstract descriptions:\n\u2022 the sad man\n\u2022 the happy woman\n\u2022 the beautiful dog\n\u2022 a lovely house\n\u2022 an amazing sight\nConcrete Descriptions\nA concrete description can be seen, heard, touched, or smelled.\nExamples of concrete details:\n\u2022 the crunching sound\n\u2022 the melted candy cane\n\u2022 the burnt toast\n\u2022 the flashing light\n\u2022 the smooth butter\nThere are appropriate times to use abstractions. For instance, if the reader is already aware\nof the circumstances (i.e., a writer is referring to a passage from a novel, in which the\naudience knows of a certain event) then the writer can generalize the emotion. However,\nespecially in creative works such as fiction and poetry, it is best to turn the abstract into\nthe concrete.\n23.4 Similes and Metaphors\nAnother way to add descriptive language is to use similes and metaphors, creating a picture\nin readers' heads by comparing two objects to one another. Similes and metaphors help to\nmake connections between two ideas, concepts, or objects that clarify or give new meaning.\nA simile is a comparison using the words like or as. It usually compares two dissimilar\nobjects. For example, the bread was as dry as a bone. The comparison links a piece of bread\nthat has become hard and white to a bone that is also hard and white. Bones often dry out,\nand so does bread. These similar characteristics are what make the simile effective.\nA metaphor states that one thing is something else. It is a comparison, but it does NOT\nuse like or as to make the comparison. For example, the athlete's stomach was a bottomless\npit. The comparison implies that the athlete's stomach will not fill up easily or quickly. The\nathlete can eat lots of food.\nTo make a simile or metaphor, identify an object like a sunset, tree, or river, or a concept\nlike love, peace, or anger. Then think of another object that has some similar traits. Decide\nwhether the words \"like\" or \"as\" will help make the connection more understandable. A good\nsimile or metaphor will make the reader look at both objects in a new perspective.\n109 Description\nBy adding similes and metaphors to a description paper, the writer can appeal to the readers'\nimagination and make the writing more interesting to read. Similes and metaphors add\nspark to descriptions.\n23.5 How to Write Description\nIn order to write descriptively, you must take a topic and decide how to make that topic\nvivid for your audience. If the topic of the piece is merely to describe a particular place, you\nmust decide what elements of that place, when described in text, will become most vivid for\nyour audience. The first step in any descriptive writing is to choose a topic and begin to\nwork out a thesis statement. As was suggested in the previous sections, you may choose to\ndescribe a particular place.\n23.5.1 Thesis\nSample Thesis Statement: Although Minnesota may seem drab and cold to outsiders, natives\nof the state find it a wonderful place to live.\nWe can see in this thesis statement that the writer will attempt to show the aspects of\nMinnesota that make it a great place to live. After detailing a thesis statement, you should\ncome up with a list of sensory words that provide vivid detail and support the thesis. You\nmay start by thinking about the five senses. How does your particular place look, smell, feel,\ntaste, and sound like? How can you best describe these senses so the reader feels what you\nfeel? By organizing the elements of descriptive language into easier to handle sections, like\nthe five senses, you are able to more specifically engage in what elements of the description\nare most useful.\n23.6 Examples of Sensory Words\nExamples of Sound Imagery\n\u2022 Quiet solitude\n\u2022 Grasshoppers chirping at night\n\u2022 Trees rustling in the wind\n\u2022 The howl of a wolf\n\u2022 Birds singing\n\u2022 Leaves crunching\n\u2022 Fire crackling\nExamples of Smell Imagery\n\u2022 Chlorine at a pool\n\u2022 Freshly cut grass\n\u2022 Flowers in spring\n110 Order of Presentation\n\u2022 Morning dew,\n\u2022 Freshly baked banana bread,\n\u2022 Acrid-campfire smoke.\nExamples of Touch Imagery\n\u2022 Cold, wet snowflakes falling on your nose\n\u2022 Corse sandpaper\n\u2022 Rough, dry tree bark\n\u2022 Wet sand beneath your feet\n\u2022 Hot pan on the stove\nExample of Visual Imagery\n\u2022 The brilliant rays of sunset\n\u2022 The churning blue waterfall\n\u2022 Powerful deer racing across the field\n\u2022 Clean snow falling softly in the sun\n\u2022 Corn stalks rustling in the breeze\nExamples of Taste Imagery\n\u2022 Lutefisk or lefsa during the holidays\n\u2022 Steaming, bitter black coffee\n\u2022 Fresh, succulent strawberries\n\u2022 Crunchy chocolate chip cookies\n\u2022 Cotton candy, sweetly melting in your mouth\nAfter deciding what senses you wish to invoke, make a list of all the words you wish to\ninclude. You should also begin to plan a way to present the information that will drive\nhome the thesis statement in the most profound way.\n23.7 Order of Presentation\nThe writer in this case could choose to present the positive aspects of Minnesota in terms\nof the seasons and weather changes. The details could be presented linearly, starting with\nspring and going through the winter, highlighting the aspects of each season that most\nclosely support the thesis, that Minnesota is a great place to live.\nPrior to starting the essay, give some thought as to whom the audience of your piece will\nbe. Who is going to read the essay, and what effect would you like it to have upon them?\nAn awareness of audience is important to choosing the level of formality you take with\nyour writing. Knowing your audience will also help you distinguish which details to include\nthroughout your essay. Assume that your audience knows very little or nothing about your\nsubject matter, and include details that may seem very obvious to you.\n111 Description\n23.7.1 Audience\nExample Audience: In this particular essay, the writer wants to show an outsider to the\nstate why Minnesota natives are so happy to live there. The essay should help break down\nstereotypes for those outsiders about Minnesota's cold weather and apparent drabness.\nBecause the essay is designed for those who do not live in Minnesota, and maybe have never\nbeen there, it is important to include details about the state that may seem obvious to a\nnative.\nWith the preparatory work complete, it is time now to begin writing your essay. Use your\nthesis statement to begin to construct an introductory paragraph. The introduction should\nset up the basis for your essay, and the thesis statement should state its purpose.\n23.7.2 Introduction\nExample Introduction: Many who have not traveled to the state of Minnesota only hear of\nits cold weather and boring reputation. They are sure missing out on the great opportunities\nthat Minnesota affords. Each season offers different senses that native Minnesotans and\ntourists know and love. Although Minnesota may seem drab and cold to outsiders, natives of\nthe state find it a wonderful place to live.\nWith the introduction complete, it is time to start constructing the body paragraphs of your\nessay. Each body paragraph should have a central theme in itself, and that theme should\nbe represented in a topic sentence. Consequently, each sentence of the paragraph should\nrelate to and support the topic sentence. The body paragraphs are where the majority of\nthe details should be given. When writing the first draft of your descriptive essay, include as\nmany details as is reasonably possible. You can always eliminate the ones that do not serve\nthe essay as well when you are revising your draft. In the case of the Minnesota nature essay,\nwe have decided to set up the body paragraphs in terms of season, starting with spring.\n23.7.3 Body\nExample Body Paragraph:\nSpring in Minnesota brings new life to the state after the long winter season. The rain\nwashes the landscape clean, leaving its fresh aroma for all to enjoy. The flowers soak up\nthe golden sun's rays and begin to show their vibrant colors. The first birds can be seen and\nheard throughout the woods and fields, telling their stories in beautiful songs. The lakes begin\nto show their glossy finish as the ice melts away slowly under the heat of the season.\nWith the body paragraphs complete, it is time to bring the essay to a close with the\nconclusion. The conclusion should return back to the thesis and provide coherence to the\nessay. The conclusion should restate the main points of the essay in order to give the reader\na final sense of what the essay was meant to portray. There should not be any new material\nintroduced in the conclusion, and the way it is worded should give the reader a sense of\nfinality.\n112 A Second Sample Descriptive Essay\n23.7.4 Conclusion\nExample Conclusion:\nBy examining what each of the seasons in Minnesota has to offer, it becomes clear that the\nstate is a truly wonderful place to live or visit. Minnesota is much more than the cold and\ndrab state that many people give it credit for. One visit to the state and anyone can see the\ngreat things about Minnesota.\nWith the essay complete, it is time to reread and revise your essay (also see revision sections\nof this textbook). Read your first draft and pinpoint all of the descriptor words you used. If\npossible, go back and add more after the ones you already used in the essay. If you can,\nread your essay out loud to a friend and have them tell you what images are vivid for them\nand what images are a little more cloudy. Rework any images that are cloudy with more\ndescriptions. Also check to see if your descriptions have made use of all of the five senses:\nsound, smell, texture, sight, and taste. Repeat these steps as many times as necessary until\nyou are happy with your product.\n23.8 A Second Sample Descriptive Essay\n23.8.1 First Draft\n113 Description\nIn recent years, many of St. Cloud's residents have congregated to Waite Park's stores and\nbusinesses for entertainment. However, people who focus their attention entirely on the\nflashy Crossroads Mall or the giant Parkwood 18 theater are depriving themselves of the fun\nand tradition of downtown St. Cloud. The downtown bars, stores, and restaurants provide\na rich experience that is unlike all others in Minnesota.\nDowntown St. Cloud's bars are always overflowing with cheek-stretching smiles, live music,\nand professionally made beverages. The Tavern on Germain boasts a cozy environment with\ndrinks such as Vodka Sours and Captain Cokes. However, if one is tired of drinking the\nnight away, he\/she can go next door for live music ranging from the acoustic-guitar stringing\nof Leonard Mills to the horn-blaring excitement of Test Tube and the Tuba Players.\nEntertainment is not unique to the over twenty-one crowd, especially when visitors can stop\nby coffee houses such as the Java Joint and the Meeting Grounds. Relax with friends while\ndining on coffee cakes and drinking them down with cappuccinos. As the laughter of your\ngroup erupts, and your nose inhales the aroma of coffee beans and melting chocolate, it\nbecomes easier to take those few extra minutes for a lunch break.\nWhen dinner time arrives, the options of the hungry people are plentiful. Cheese melts while\nsausage sizzles on the crust of pizza at the House of Pizza. When hungry individuals take a\ntaste of the pie from the House, it melts in a mouth with layers of tickling pepperoni. If\npizza is not what's in a person's mind, order a burger at the Green Mill or devour a calzone.\nEither one will gladly fill an empty stomach.\nWhen dinner concludes, one can travel to some of the shops. Drum beats pound like gorilla\ndance moves at the Electric Fetus. From the slipperiness of the CD cases featuring covers\nwith Pete Townshend driving his hand across the strings of his guitar, or other records with\nMariah Carey singing on the windy stage, a music lover finds it all the Electric Fetus.\nFrom music to tasty treats, St. Cloud's residents can find all that they desire downtown.\nChoose it instead of an over-crowded mall. It is meant for exploration, and with a little\ndigging, anyone can find what they are looking for.\nFirst Draft of a Sample Descriptive Essay\n23.8.2 Second Draft\n114 External Links\nIn recent years, many of St. Cloud's residents have congregated to Waite Park's stores\nand businesses for entertainment.

As the sun rises in the back of the\nMeeting Grounds, visitors inhale the aroma of coffee beans and melting chocolate, and it\nbecomes easier for them to take a few extra minutes before leaving for work.\nAs those work days dip into evenings, hungry downtown patrons, with their stomachs\ngrowling in unison, march to any one of the many eateries. Mexican Village spreads the\naroma of spices and peppers rolled into a tortilla wrap with thick cuts of beef down the\nstreet. However, not to be outdone, House of Pizza strolls out its smell of pepperoni that\ntickles the nose, but then sends a message to the mouth that says, \"Come this way.\" A wind\ngust brushes through the downtown area carrying the Green Mill's calzone aroma, which\nleaves those hungry patrons without an easy answer.\nWith their stomachs filled, downtown patrons wander down the street to the retail shops.\nSome of the customers step into the Electric Fetus where the drums beat like avalanches,\nand the songbirds are in flight with microphones pressed against their lips. Further north,\nanother sound rattles through each person's eardrum: the flipping of smooth pages from\nBooks Revisited, where used literature is sold, stacked, then discovered by bookworms\ndigging through each level. Books may be flipped and songs may blare, but shoes scuff\nthe tile floor of Herbergers\u2014a two-story department store where jewelry and clothing are\nyanked from the rack just as quickly as they are hung on.\nThe sun sets and the moon rises, but that just means that St. Cloud's downtown bars will\nbe overflowing with cheek-stretching smiles, wall-shaking music, and lip-licking beverages.\nThe Tavern on Germain rapidly serves drinks such as Vodka Sours and Captain Cokes to\ncustomers sitting at their table. Along with the constant guzzling, he\/she can go next door\nfor live music ranging from the acoustic-guitar stringing of Leonard Mills to the horn-blaring\nexcitement of Test Tube and the Tuba Players.\nWhether their hands are sorting through thin page of paperback books, or their mouths are\nchewing on the gooey cottage cheese of lasagna, downtown patrons are always on the go to\nthe next hot spot. As the customers reach the end of the downtown St. Cloud district, most\nare ready to turn around and visit all the stops again. St. Cloud is bustling with retailers\nthat will cause anyone's eyes to take a second glimpse.\nSecond Draft of a Sample Descriptive Essay\n23.9 External Links\n\u2022 A Brief Guide to Writing Descriptive Essays1\n1 http:\/\/www.rscc.cc.tn.us\/owl&writingcenter\/OWL\/Describe.html\n115 Description\n\u2022 [http:\/\/leo.stcloudstate.edu\/acadwrite\/descriptive.html Checklist of Things to\nConsider when\n116 24 Narration\n24.1 What is Narration?\nNarration may serve a variety of purposes in writing. It may serve as the primary mode\nin a narrative. Narration may also be used just like reasons and examples to support a\nthesis, based on either fact or invention. Often, it is used to increase reader interest or\ndramatize a point the writer wants to make. For example, Aesop wrote fables for his clients\nto use in their legal defense. They were short, easy to remember, and illustrated the client\u2019s\nargument. Traditionally, narration was used to recount the facts of a legal case, in order to\nput them into context and structure them in the best possible light for the speaker\u2019s purpose.\nPlutarch used narration as the basis for his comparison of Greek and Roman notables. In\nhis 1989 history of the Civil War, Battle Cry of Freedom, James MacPherson uses narration\nto support the theme of the contingency of history. In short, narration has been used as\nproof for a long time.\n24.2 What is Narrative?\nA narrative is a constructive format (as a work of speech, writing, song, film, television,\nvideo games, photography or theatre) that describes a sequence of non-fictional or fictional\nevents. The word derives from the Latin verb narrare, \"to tell\", and is related to the adjective\ngnarus, \"knowing\" or \"skilled\". [Oxford English Dictionary Online, \"narrate, v.\". Oxford\nUniversity Press, 2007]\n\u2022 First Person Narrative: A mode of narration where a story is told by one character at a\ntime, speaking from their own perspective only. \"I\" \"My\"\n\u2022 Second Person Narrative: A mode of narration where a story is told with the use of \"You\"\n\"Your\" EXAMPLE: You went to the store before you bought yourself a flower.\n\u2022 Third Person Narrative: A mode of narration where a story is told with the use of \"She\"\n\"He\" \"They\" \"They'll\"\n\u2022 Multiple Narratives: A mode of narration where a story is told with the use of several\nnarrators which tell the story from different points of view. The task, for readers, is to\ndecide which narrator seems the most reliable for each part of the story.\n\u2022 Unreliable Narratives: An unreliable narrator is a narrator whose credibility is in question\nor has been compromised. This narrative mode is one which is developed by an author\nfor various reasons, but is usually done so as to deceive the reader or audience. In most\ncircumstances, unreliable narrators are first-person narrators, but third-person narrators\ncan also be unreliable.\n117 Narration\n24.3 Elements\nThe minimum requirements of narration include:\n\u2022 A beginning, middle, and end\n\u2022 A main character, perhaps others as well\n\u2022 A setting in time and place\n\u2022 Motivated (or caused) action\n\u2022 Supports the thesis (\"It is best to prepare for the days of necessity.\")\n\"The Ant and the Grasshopper\"1. One example of narration requirements - Aesop's Fables\n24.4 Classical Arrangement\nThe classical arrangement indicates how narration may be used:\n\u2022 Introduction\n\u2022 Narrative\n\u2022 Proposition (thesis)\n\u2022 Confirmation (more examples, reasons, or narration)\n\u2022 Refutation (of competing explanations)\n\u2022 Conclusion1\n24.5 Modern Practice\nToday, writers commonly begin their essay with a short narrative which leads to the thesis:\n\u2022 Short Narrative\n\u2022 Thesis\n\u2022 Supporting examples and reasons\n\u2022 Opposing viewpoints\n\u2022 Conclusion\nOr, they may use narration to support their argument:\n\u2022 Introduction\n\u2022 Thesis\n\u2022 Supporting examples and reasons\n\u2022 Narrative\n\u2022 Conclusion\nMany organizational methods exist for incorporating narration into writing. In the end, it\nwill depend on your purpose and audience as to how and where (and even \"if\") you use it.\n\u2022 \"Shooting An Elephant by George Orwell\"2\n1 http:\/\/www.bartleby.com\/17\/1\/36.html\n2 http:\/\/www.online-literature.com\/orwell\/887\/\n118 Student Essay\n\u2022 \"Walden, Chapter 12\"3\n24.6 Student Essay\nBelow is a description of the process one might go through to write an essay supporting the\nthesis with narration.\nAnswer the following questions:\n\u2022 What is the purpose of your essay? What point do you want to make?\n\u2022 What specific statement (thesis) do you want your story to support?\n\u2022 What audience do you wish to address? Your professor? Your classmates? Some fictional\naudience? This will determine how formal or informal you can be, what assumptions you\nhave of what your audience knows and likes.\n\u2022 What is your setting, in time and place? Or, where and when does the story take place?\n\u2022 Which events best illustrate your purpose in telling the story? Which events are clear in\nyour mind, and will be most easily related? What is the best order to relate the events?\nTreat this question like a brainstorming process, and list as many events as you can\nremember. Then narrow your list to the most pertinent to your thesis statement and\ninherent purpose.\nIn our example essay, the writer may start with the events of his freshman year, going all\nthe way through to his senior year.\n\u2022 Freshman:\n\u2022 I learned to manage my time with practice, schoolwork, and my social life.\n\u2022 I learned what it means to earn your status within a group atmosphere.\n\u2022 Sophomore:\n\u2022 I learned to deal with adversity, as I was injured throughout most of the season.\n\u2022 I learned to ask for and rely on the help of others when I could not do things on my\nown.\n\u2022 Junior:\n\u2022 I learned to truly work together to achieve team goals, as we had a very successful\nseason.\n\u2022 I learned to present myself as a role model, as I gained some community notoriety.\n\u2022 Senior:\n\u2022 I learned how to present myself as a true leader of a group, as I was elected team\ncaptain.\n\u2022 I learned to take pride in everything I do because it is the most reward-\ning.|caption=Events of the Narrative\nOnce you have stated the purpose of your essay, formulated a thesis, selected an audience,\nidentified a setting, and brainstormed the events of your story, it is time to begin writing.\n3 http:\/\/ebooks.adelaide.edu.au\/t\/thoreau\/henry_david\/walden\/chapter12.html\n119 Narration\nKeep in mind that the more detail and description you can fit into your essay, the more the\nstory will come alive for the reader. Also, your conclusion should relate how the events in\nthe story changed you as a person with regard to your purpose.\nAGLUYA, CRESCINTI BSA-1-C\nMy experience playing High School basketball taught me skills which will benefit me\nthroughout the rest of my life. It all started during the fall of my freshman year at Otucan\nBila National High School, when I quickly found out how important time management is. I\nhad my schoolwork, which was fourteen credits including an extremely difficult Mathematics\nclass. I had basketball, which included meetings and practice every day and running and\nlifting a couple times of week. I also had my social life, another important aspect, especially\nto a twelve year old.\nMy sophomore year taught me how to deal with adversity. I broke my leg during the\nsecond game of the season against Team Angels, and I learned how something that seems\ndevastating can be seen in a positive light. I learned that life will always have something\nunexpected in store, but learning to deal with it makes us stronger people.\nMy junior year taught me how to set goals and achieve them in a team atmosphere. Our\nteam that year had a mission to make the playoffs, and we were not going to let anything\nget in our way. We really came together that year because we all had a common goal. I\nlearned that a group can achieve wonderful things if all of the group members work together\nand believe in each other.\nMy senior year in basketball taught me how to be a leader. I was elected team captain by\nmy teammates, which showed me that my peers respected me and knew they could rely\non me. Leadership does not come easily however. I learned that leadership must not only\nbe earned, but it also must be kept. I was always conscious of the way I acted and spoke,\nbecause I knew my teammates were looking to me for strength.\nEach year I played High School basketball taught me something not only about myself but\nalso about the nature of the world and the people who inhabit the world. I learned how\nto balance my time, deal with adversity, the true meaning of teamwork, and how to be a\nrespected leader. These skill-building activities will benefit me throughout the rest of my\nlife.\nSample Narrative\n24.7 Revision Hints\nAs with any form of essay, it is always important to go back and revise the first draft.\nProofread the essay carefully, and look for ways to improve its overall appearance. In the\ncase of narration, make sure the story flows for the audience. Do the events of the story\nmake sense? Also, look to make sure that each event relates directly back to the purpose\nand thesis. Does this particular event reinforce my thesis? When writing a narration, it is\nalso important to look for ways to make the story more vivid for the audience. Go back and\ninclude as many descriptive words and details as possible. Once you are satisfied with your\nproduct, make a clean and neat final copy.\n120 External Links\n24.8 External Links\n\u2022 A Brief Guide to Writing Narrative Essays4\n\u2022 Narrative Essays5\n1D\u2019Angelo, Frank J. Composition in the Classical Tradition. Boston: Allyn & Bacon; 2000;\np. 22.\n4 http:\/\/www.roanestate.edu\/owl\/Describe.html\n5 http:\/\/leo.stcloudstate.edu\/acadwrite\/narrative.html\n121  25 Exposition\n25.1 What is Exposition Writing?\nExposition can be either oral or written. It is used to explain, interpret, inform, or describe.\nAn expository writer must assume that the audience has no prior knowledge regarding the\ntopic being discussed. So the topic must be written in a clear manner explaining how things\nwork (you can however, leave out common knowledge--you probably are not writing for first\ngraders).\nAs most academic terms, exposition can acquire various definitions depending on the context\nin which a writer is using the word. The HarperCollins Collins English Dictionary defines\nexposition in seven different disciplinary contexts.\n1. Within the Communication Arts \/ Journalism & Publishing discipline exposition is\ndefined as: a systematic, usually written statement about, commentary on, or explanation\nof a specific subject\n2. The act of expounding of setting forth information or a viewpoint\n3. (Business \/ Commerce) of a large public exhibition, especially of industrial products or\narts and crafts\n4. The act of exposing or the state of being exposed\n5. (Performing Arts \/ Theatre) the part of a play, novel, etc., in which the theme and main\ncharacters are introduced.\n6. (Music \/ Classical Music) Music the first statement of the subjects or themes of a\nmovement in sonata form or a fugue\n7. (Christianity \/ Roman Catholic Church) RC Church the exhibiting of the consecrated\nEucharistic Host or a relic for public veneration (Harper Collins Dictionary)\n25.1.1 Types of Exposition\n\u2022 Description - The author explains a particular topic by showing characteristics, features,\nand examples.\n\u2022 Comparison - The author shows how two or more topics are alike.\n\u2022 Contrast - The author shows how two or more topics are different.\n\u2022 Cause and Effect - The author demonstrates the cause while showing the effects of the\ncause.\n\u2022 Problem and Solution - The author explains a problem, then explores possible solutions.\n\u2022 Analytical - The author evaluates a topic or argument revealing its strengths and\nweaknesses.\n123 Exposition\n\u2022 Classification-Theauthorsortsthingsintousefulcategories, makessureallthecategories\nfollow a single organizing principle, and gives examples that fit into each category.\n\u2022 Sequence - The author lists items or events in numerical or chronological order.\n25.1.2 Where Do I Begin?\nFind a Topic and Research\nFirst you must find a specific aspect of a topic that would interest you. You will have\nto research the topic extensively so that you can explain it\u2014what exposition is all about.\nResearch your topic extensively. You will probably have to spend quite a bit of time, but\nremember that the researching can be exciting. The general initial researching may even\nprovide some valuable information that you want to explain. Researching is like exercising:\nat first it hurts, but with time you become stronger and it's easier to flex your researching\nmuscles. After you have decided upon a topic, you can create a thesis.\nThesis\nAn expositional paper is most easily written when you have a \"tight\" thesis. This means\nthat the focus of your topic is extremely specific. When your thesis is concise, you can write\nat length because you know exactly what you should be writing about. But when you have\na sloppy, vague thesis, you can become lost and your writing reflects this. This goes back to\nchoosing a topic focus that deals with something specific, and not overly general. A thesis\nmakes a claim regarding your focus and is supported by details and facts. It is written in\none or two complete sentences. An example of a thesis would be: \u201cGardening can be a\nrewarding hobby because of the creativity involved, the variety of plants, and the many uses\nof plants.\u201d\nCreate a Sketchy Outline\nAfter you write your thesis, create a sketchy outline so that you have a game plan for your\npaper. Your outline should have information that you want to include for each part of your\nthesis. For our thesis example, we could find lots of information that could support the\ndifferent parts of gardening. Notice the word could--just because we have the information\ndoesn't mean we must use it in the paper. This is a rough outline after all.\nStart Writing\nToo often we don\u2019t begin writing because we are stuck\u2014don\u2019t be, just start writing. You\ncan begin anywhere. Start writing where you feel the most comfortable. When you have\nyour outline, as sketchy as it may be, it reminds you of ideas that you want to include in\nyour paper. Remember though that readers are interested in what YOU have to say\u2014they\ndon\u2019t want to read regurgitated quotes and opinions of others, so make sure that your point\nis being heard.\n124 Structure\n25.2 Structure\nThe structure of an expository piece consists of first an introduction that contains the most\ncrucial element\u2014the thesis\u2014the main point you wish to convey. After the introduction is\nthe body, in which you clarify the different aspects of the thesis in great detail. The final\npiece, the conclusion, restates and rephrases (using different words) the thesis and ties up\nany \u201cloose ends\u201d.\n25.2.1 Introduction\nThe very first part of your introduction should have an attention-grabbing device (a hook)\nto engage your readers. Hooks can be statistics, facts, questions, or unusual details. Don't\nmake general statements such as \"it is clear that...\" because you are trying to explain\nsomething that perhaps your reader doesn't know, so it would not be clear to them. Instead\nbe informative. The introduction will also contain your thesis. Good topic referring to\nRhetoric. One can check it at the essays writing companies and already written essays\naccomplished by writing service writers.\n25.2.2 Body\nNow that you have your specific thesis, along with your sketchy outline, you must support\nyour thesis claim by using concrete evidence and examples. You should exfoliate your thesis.\nRemember that expositional writing assumes that your readers have no prior knowledge\nregarding your topic, so you must explain things very clearly. Parallelism can be very\nimportant in your paper. It can give the readers a feeling of structure and importance. Pick\na method of organization and stick with it.\nIn our example, we would explain in detail how much creativity is involved in gardening.\nWe could write about the style of impressive European or Oriental gardens. Next, we would\nshow how there are a variety of plants. We could write about plants found in different\nclimates. Finally, we would explain the many uses of plants. We could write about floral\nbouquets and vegetables.\nBecause exposition\u2019s purpose is to inform, you will want to establish common ground with\nyour readers. You should write objectively, which will fulfill the purpose of explaining things.\n25.2.3 Conclusion\nA conclusion wraps up your paper by recalling your main points, but do not use the identical\nwords that you used in your introduction. Conclusions and introductions are like frames,\nthey should tie your whole paper together. You should explain your main points briefly and\nfreshly. Don't be sloppy--this is the last impression you are making.\n125 Exposition\n25.3 Sample Exposition Assignments\nHere are some sample assignments to prepare you for a real exposition paper or essay.\nRemember that your audience has very little previous knowledge of your topic!\nUNKNOWN TEMPLATE Sample\nSample Assignments\n\u2022 Write an informative exposition essay on the many uses of duct tape.\n\u2022 Compose a descriptive exposition essay about your room.\n\u2022 Type an analytical exposition essay that analyzes your computer keyboard and the how\neffective it is at its job.\n\u2022 You can also use other subjects to write about, such as your favorite food or drink or\nyour hobbies.\n25.4 Sample Exposition Essay\nAssignment: Explain an aspect of cellular phones.\nUNKNOWN TEMPLATE Sample\nSample Exposition Essay \"Words are, of course, the most powerful drug used by mankind.\" -\none of the best ways to spread this \"powerful drug\" is through the simple act of talking to\nanother person. Everybody wants to talk and everybody also wants to listen and learn. How\nis one man or woman supposed to communicate with another from across the city, state, or\neven country without a very powerful tool? This powerful tool, while seemingly simple, is\ncalled a cellular phone, or cell phone for short. The cell phone has revolutionized the way\nthat the world communicates with each other and spreads the good word. One might be\nasking just what a cell phone is--well, listen up and find out. The cell phone has its roots\nwith the telegraph and telephone. These are both devices that are able to send messages\nthrough land-based wires called phone lines. That means that a coded message or a voice is\nsent through phone lines in order to make it to its destination. The receiving person can\nthen translate the code or listen to the voice on the other end. On a telephone, people were\ncapable of having a conversation from across the nation while it sounded like they were in\nthe same room as each other. In order for them to be able to make a call to each other,\nthough, there would have to be a web of phone lines connecting them over thousands of\nmiles of land. Laying all of these phone lines was very cumbersome, as was only being able\nto send or receive calls from a stationary place, like a house or office. While the Telephone\nmade broad communication more accessible, it still did not have entirely enough freedom for\nthe people. This was all changed in the year 1973. A man named Martin Cooper invented\nthe first Cellular Phone while working for Motorola. It was about the size of a brick and\nweighed over 30 ounces (or 1.8 pounds). While big in size, it was even larger in potential.\nCooper made his first call on his cell phone while walking in the middle of a New York street.\nThere were no wires connected to his phone. There was nothing restricting his movement\nand could send or receive calls from anywhere. How does a cell phone work if it is not\nconnected to the phone lines? The short answer to that question is: satellites. The cell\nphone emits a signal to one of the many satellites that are orbiting Earth. The satellite\n126 External links\ncatches the signal and sends it back to Earth to the person that was meant to receive it.\nThis does not mean that cell phones cannot communicate with land-line telephones. If a cell\nphone calls a land-line, the signal is sent to the satellite and then back to a satellite dish on\nEarth where it is then re-sent through landlines to the house or office. This also works in\nreverse for a land-line that is calling a cell phone. The cell phone is much more than just a\nunwired phone in the present day. It has evolved much since Cooper's phone of '73 and they\nnow weigh an average of 3 ounces. Cell phones can now store all of the phone numbers that\na person needs. There is no more having to find the list of phone numbers on a piece of\npaper and to dial the number every time a call is placed to somebody. With cell phones,\none simply just has to find a person's name on the phone and press send. They can even\nstore schedules, set sleep alarms, take pictures, play music, browse the Internet, and much\nmore. The cell phone has come a long way in 30 years to set a world free of wires. There is\nnothing holding anybody back from walking down the middle of the street while having a\nconversation with somebody 2000 miles away anymore. The cell phone is a marvel beyond\nwhat was imagined when Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone. It is a very\npowerful tool for getting our words around, and will take us places in the future that we\nhave never dreamed of.\n\u2022 Information in this essay was provided from About.com1.\n25.4.1 Why Is This Good?\nFirsttheintroduction, asurprisingandinterestingquote, immediatelycatches yourattention\nsince it equalizes words and drugs. The introduction has a tight thesis, \u201cThe cell phone has\nrevolutionized the way that the world communicates with each other and spreads the good\nword.\u201d\nThe body explains the revolution of cell phones. Notice how the writer clearly defined what\na phone line is and how it works. The writer transitions into another topic by asking a\nquestion, \u201cHow does a cell phone work if it is not connected to the phone lines?\u201d Asking\nquestions is an easy rhetorical device that can make your paper flow more smoothly.\nFinally, this conclusion ties together the paper since it recalls the main themes. By using\ndifferent words, the conclusion is fresh and not predictable. It is future looking. \u201cIt is a very\npowerful tool for getting our words around, and it will take us places in the future that we\nhave never dreamed of.\u201d\n25.5 External links\n\u2022 Information about Expository Writing2 With writing samples.\n1 http:\/\/inventors.about.com\/cs\/inventorsalphabet\/a\/martin_cooper.htm\n2 http:\/\/www.stanford.edu\/~arnetha\/expowrite\/info.html#what\n127  26 Evaluation\n26.1 What is Evaluative Writing?\nEvaluative writing is a type of writing intended to judge something according to a set of\ncriteria. For instance, your health might be evaluated by an insurance company before\nissuing a policy. The purpose of this evaluation would be to determine your overall health\nand to check for existing medical conditions. The better your evaluation, the less the\ninsurance company might charge you for coverage.\n26.1.1 Criteria\nThe key to effective evaluative writing is starting off with a clear and precise argument.\nYour main argument is what you will use to perform the evaluation. You may want to argue\nthat a Chevy Tahoe is better than a Ford Expedition based on its horsepower, gas mileage,\ncapacity, warranty, etc. Other evaluators might argue the difference between their towing\ncapability. Whatever the main argument may be for your evaluative essay, make sure that\nyour argument is clear.\n\u2022 Make sure you have a well presented subject. Without one, you will lose your readers.\n\u2022 Create a thesis statement. Thesis statements help you stay focused and help your reader\nto understand what is being evaluated or judged.\n\u2022 Give only information that is imperative to the decision making process. If it looks like\nunnecessary information, it probably is.\n\u2022 Do not be biased when creating an evaluative essay. Give both good and bad examples\nof the topic.\n\u2022 You are the \"expert\" in an evaluative essay. Support your opinions with facts, not whims.\nThings to Remember\n26.1.2 How to Evaluate\nA big question you might have is: how do I evaluate my subject? That depends on what\nyour subject is.\nIf you are evaluating a piece of writing, then you are going to need to read the work\nthoroughly. While you read the work, keep in mind the criteria you are using to evaluate.\nThe evaluative aspects may be: grammar, sentence structure, spelling, content, usage of\nsources, style, or many other things. Another thing to consider when evaluating a piece of\n129 Evaluation\nwriting is whether the writing appeals to its target audience. Is there an emotional appeal?\nDoes the author engage the audience, or is the piece lacking something? If you can, make\nnotes directly on your work itself so that you remember what you want to write about in\nyour essay.\nIf you are evaluating anything else, use your head. You need to try, use, or test whatever\nthing you are evaluating. That means you should not evaluate a 2005 Chevrolet Corvette\nunless you have the $45,000 (or more) to buy one, or the money to rent one. You also need\nthe know-how of driving a car of that power and a base of knowledge of other cars that you\nhave tested to make a fair comparison.\nOn the note of comparisons, only compare things that are reasonably alike. People\ndon't care to know how an apple compares to a backpack; that is for a different type of essay.\nCompare different types of apples to each other and different types of backpacks against\neach other. That is what people are looking for when reading comparisons in an evaluation\nessay.\nWhatever you are evaluating, make sure to do so thoroughly. Take plenty of notes during\nthe testing phase so that your thoughts stay fresh in your mind. You do not want to forget\nabout a part of the subject that you did not test.\n26.2 Structure of the Essay\n26.2.1 Introduction\nIn the introduction of your evaluative essay, you should clearly state the following: - what\nyou are evaluating (the subject -- like a 2009 Toyota Prius) - the purpose of your evaluation\n- what criteria you are evaluating your subject on (mileage, price, performance, etc.)\nFor example, you should not just write that you are judging the taste of an apple. You\nshould explain that you are judging the sweetness, bitterness, and crispness of the apple.\n26.2.2 Body\nUnlike some types of essays, the introduction is not the most important part of an evaluative\nessay. Most readers already want to read about the subject that you are writing on, so you\ndon't need to draw them in with a fancy intro. Your audience just wants the information!\nBe sure to be very descriptive and thorough when evaluating your subject. The more you\nleave out of the essay, the more unanswered questions your readers are left with. Your goal\nshould be to cover all aspects of the subject and to tell the audience how good or bad it\nis. Consider, for example, not only what quality the subject possesses, but what is missing.\nGood evaluations measure the quality or value of a subject by considering what it has and\nwhat it lacks.\n130 Sample Assignments\n26.2.3 Conclusion\nThe conclusion for an evaluative essay is pretty straightforward. Simply go over the main\npoints from the body of your essay. After that, make an overall evaluation of the subject.\nTell the audience if they should buy it, eat it, use it, wear it, etc. and why. After that is\ndone, your essay is over. Good job!\n26.3 Sample Assignments\nHere are some sample assignments to get your brain pumping:\n\u2022 Evaluate the plans for a new Minnesota Twins ballpark (found here: New Ballpark\nPlans1). How does it compare to the current Metrodome in Minneapolis in terms of\nseating, concessions, cost to build, etc.? In the end, is it a good idea to build their\nproposed park?\n\u2022 Evaluate your backpack.

Maybe you think of a shouting\nmatch or a fist fight? Well, when instructors use the word \"argument,\" they're typically\nthinking about something else. What they're actually referring to is a written or spoken\nform of defense.\nMore to the point, they're talking about defending a certain point of view through writing\nor speech. Usually called a \"claim\" or a \"thesis,\" this point of view is concerned with an\nissue that doesn't have a clear right or wrong answer (e.g., four and two make six). Also,\nthis argument should not only be concerned with personal opinion (e.g., I really like carrots).\nInstead,anargumentmighttackleissueslikeabortion,capitalpunishment,stemcellresearch,\nor gun control. However, what distinguishes an argument from a descriptive essay or \"report\"\nis that the argument must take a stance; if you're merely summarizing \"both sides\" of\nan issue or pointing out the \"pros and cons,\" you're not really writing an argument. \"Stricter\ngun control laws will likely result in a decrease in gun-related violence\" is an argument.\nNote that people can and will disagree with this argument, which is precisely why so many\ninstructors find this type of assignment so useful -- they make you think!\nAcademic arguments usually \"articulate an opinion.\" This opinion is always carefully de-\nfended with good reasoning and supported by plenty of research. Research? Yes,\nresearch! Indeed, part of learning to write effective arguments is finding reliable sources(or\nother documents) that lend credibility to your position. It's not enough to say \"capital\npunishment is wrong because that's the way I feel.\"\nInstead, you need to adequately support your claim by finding:\n\u2022 facts\n\u2022 statistics\n\u2022 quotations from recognized authorities, and\n\u2022 other types of evidence\nYou won't always win, and that's fine. The goal of an argument is simply to:\n\u2022 make a claim\n\u2022 support your claim with the most credible reasoning and evidence you can muster\n\u2022 hope that the reader will at least understand your position\n\u2022 hope that your claim is taken seriously\nIf you defend your argument's position with good reasoning and evidence, you should earn a\nhigh grade, even if your instructor personally disagrees with the views you are defending.\n133 Argument\nWe will be covering the basic format of how to structure an argument. This includes the\ngeneral written argument structure, and the Position and Proposal variations of that\nbasic form. If you want to make a claim about a particular (usually controversial) issue, you\ncan use the Position argument form. Alternately, if you would like to offer a solution to a\nparticular situation that you see as problematic, such as the rising cost of education, you can\nget your idea across using a Proposal argument. By adapting one of these three methods,\nyou will be well on the way to making your point. The great thing about the argument\nstructure is its amazingly versatility. Once you become familiar with this basic structure of\nthe argumentative essay, you will be able to clearly argue about almost anything!\n\"If you can't annoy somebody, there's little point in writing.\"\n--Kingsley Amis (1922 - 1995)\n27.2 Basic Argument Essay Structure\n27.2.1 Introduction\nThe first paragraph of your argument is used to introduce your topic and the issues\nsurrounding it. This needs to be in clear, easily understandable language. Your readers need\nto know what you're writing about before they can decide if they believe you or not.\nOnce you have introduced your general subject, it's time to state your claim. Your claim\nwill serve as the thesis for your essay. Make sure that you use clear and precise language.\nYour reader needs to understand exactly where you stand on the issue. The clarity of your\nclaim affects your readers' understanding of your views. Also, it's a good idea to highlight\nwhat you plan to cover. Highlights allow your reader to know what direction you will be\ntaking with your argument.\nYou can also mention the points or arguments in support of your claim, which you will be\nfurther discussing in the body. This part comes at the end of the thesis and can be named\nas the guide. The guide is a useful tool for you as well as the readers. It is useful for you,\nbecause this way you will be more organized. In addition, your audience will have a clear\ncut idea as to what will be discussed in the body.\n27.3 Body\n27.3.1 Background Information\nOnce your position is stated you should establish your credibility. There are two sides\nto every argument. This means not everyone will agree with your viewpoint. So try to form\na common ground with the audience. Think about who may be undecided or opposed to\nyour viewpoint. Take the audience's age, education, values, gender, culture, ethnicity, and\nall other variables into consideration as you introduce your topic. These variables will affect\nyour word choice, and your audience may be more likely to listen to your argument with an\nopen mind if you do.\n134 Body\n27.3.2 Developing Your Argument\nBack up your thesis with logical and persuasive arguments. During your pre-writing phase,\noutline the main points you might use to support your claim, and decide which are the\nstrongest and most logical. Eliminate those which are based on emotion rather than fact.\nYour corroborating evidence should be well-researched, such as statistics, examples, and\nexpert opinions. You can also reference personal experience. It's a good idea to have a\nmixture. However, you should avoid leaning too heavily on personal experience, as you want\nto present an argument that appears objective as you are using it to persuade your reader.\nThere are a couple different methods of developing your argument. Two variations of the\nbasic argument structure are the Position Method and the Proposal Method.\nPosition Method\nThe Position Method is used to try to convince your audience that you are in the right,\nand the other view of your argument is wrong.\n1. Introduce and define your topic. Never assume that your reader is familiar with\nthe issues surrounding your topic. This is your chance to set up the premise (point of\nview) you want to use. This is also a good time to present your thesis statement.\n2. Background information. Do your research! The more knowledgeable you are,\nthe more concise an argument you will be able to give. You will now be able to provide\nyour reader with the best information possible. This will allow your audience to read\nyour paper with the same knowledge you possess on the topic. Information is the\nbackbone to a solid argument.\n3. Development. You have your argument, and you may have even stated your thesis.\nNow, start developing your ideas. Provide evidence and reasoning.\n4. Be prepared to deal with the \"Other Side.\" There will be those who oppose your\nargument. Be prepared to answer those opinions or points of view with knowledgeable\nresponses. If you have done your homework and know your material, you will be able\nto address any opposing arguments with ease and authority.\n5. In conclusion... Now is the time to drive home your point. Re-emphasize your main\narguments and thesis statement.\nPosition Method\nProposal Method\nThe Proposal Method of argument is used when there is a problematic situation, and you\nwould like to offer a solution to the situation. The structure of the Proposal method is very\nsimilar to the above Position method, but there are slight differences.\n135 Argument\n1. Introduce and define the nature of the problematic situation. Make sure to\nfocus on the actual problem and what is causing the problem. This may seem simple,\nbut many people focus solely on the effects of a problematic situation. By focusing on\nthe actual problem, your readers will see your proposal as a solution to the problem.\nIf you don't, your readers might see your solution as a mere complaint.\n2. Propose a solution, or a number of solutions, to the problem. Be specific\nabout these solutions. If you have one solution, you may choose to break it into parts\nand spend a paragraph or so describing each part. If you have several solutions, you\nmay instead choose to spend a paragraph on each scenario. Each additional solution\nwill add both depth and length to your argument. But remember to stay focused.\nAdded length does not always equal a better argument.\n3. Describe the workability of the various solutions. There are a variety of ways\nthat this could be done. With a single-solution paper you could break the feasibility\ndown into short and long term goals and plans. With a multiple-solution essay, you\nmay instead highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the individual solutions, and\nestablish which would be the most successful, based on your original statement of the\nproblem and its causes.\n4. Summarize and conclude your proposal. Summarize your solutions, re-state how\nthe solution or solutions would work to remedy the problematic situation, and you're\ndone.\nProposal Method\n27.3.3 Dealing With the Opposition\nWhen writing an argument, expect that you will have opposition. Skeptical readers will have\ntheir own beliefs and points of view. When conducting your research, make sure to review\nthe opposing side of the argument that you are presenting. You need to be prepared to\ncounter those ideas. Remember, in order for people to give up their position, they must see\nhow your position is more reasonable than their own. When you address the opposing point\nof view in your essay and demonstrate how your own claim is stronger, you neutralize their\nargument. By failing to address a non-coinciding view, you leave a reason for your reader\nto disagree with you, and therefore weaken your persuasive power. Methods of addressing\nthe opposing side of the argument vary. You may choose to state your main points, then\naddress and refute the opposition, and then conclude. Conversely, you might summarize the\nopposition's views early in your argument, and then revisit them after you've present your\nside or the argument. This will show how your information is more reasonable than their\nown.\n27.4 Conclusion\nYou have introduced your topic, stated your claim, supported that claim with logical and\nreasonable evidence, and refuted your opposition's viewpoint. The hard work is done. Now\nit's time to wrap things up. By the time readers get to the end of your paper, they should\n136 Strengthening Your Argument\nhave learned something. You should have learned something, too. Give readers an idea to\ntake away with them. Conclude = to come together or to end (not restate what has already\nbeen said in your paper). One word of caution: avoid introducing any new information in\nyour conclusion. If you find that there's another point that you wanted to include, revise\nyour essay. Include this new information into the body of your essay. The conclusion should\nonly review what the rest of your essay has offered.\n27.5 Strengthening Your Argument\n27.5.1 Phrasing\nIt is important to clearly state and support your position. However, it is just as important to\npresent all of the information that you've gathered in an objective manner. Using language\nthat is demeaning or non-objective will undermine the strength of your argument. This\ndestroys your credibility and will reduce your audience on the spot. For example, a student\nwriting an argument about why a particular football team has a good chance of \"going all\nthe way\" is making a strategic error by stating that \"anyone who doesn't think that the\nMinnesota Vikings deserve to win the Super Bowl is a total idiot.\" Not only has the writer\nrisked alienating any number of her readers, she has also made her argument seem shallow\nand poorly researched. In addition, she has committed a third mistake: making a sweeping\ngeneralization that cannot be supported.\nUse phrasing that does not:\n\u2022 Alienate any part of your audience\n\u2022 Make an argument that is poorly researched or shallow\n\u2022 Make an unsupported generalization\nMistakes that could ruin your Argument\n27.5.2 Objective Language\nYou should avoid using \"I\" and \"My\" (subjective) statements in your argument. You should\nonly use \"I\" or \"My\" if you are an expert in your field (on a given topic). Instead choose\nmore objective language to get your point across. Consider the following:\nI believe that the United States Government is failing to meet the needs of today's average\ncollege student through the under-funding of need-based grants, increasingly restrictive\nfinancial aid eligibility requirements, and a lack of flexible student loan options.\n\"Great,\" your reader thinks, \"Everyone's entitled to their opinion.\"\nNow lets look at this sentence again, but without the \"I\" at the beginning. Does the same\nsentence becomes a strong statement of fact without your \"I\" tacked to the front?:\nThe United States Government is failing to meet the needs of today's average college student\nthroughtheunderfundingofneed-basedgrants,increasinglyrestrictivefinancialaideligibility\nrequirements, and a lack of flexible student loan options.\n137 Argument\n\"Wow,\" your reader thinks, \"that really sounds like a problem.\"\nA small change like the removal of your \"I\"s and \"my\"s can make all the difference in how a\nreader perceives your argument-- as such, it's always good to proof read your rough draft\nand look for places where you could use objective rather than subjective language.\n27.6 Sample Essay\n138 Sample Essay\nPGA Tour, Inc. v Casey Martin\nCasey Martin was born with a degenerative circulatory disorder that makes his right leg\nvery weak. Casey Martin has shown that he possesses the ability to compete on the PGA\ntour. He has confessed, \u201cAll I ever wanted was the chance to play and to see how good I\ncould be\u201d (Faces 1). Yet it\u2019s been written that \u201cWalking not only causes him pain, fatigue,\nand anxiety, but also created a significant risk of hemorrhaging, developing blood clots,\nfracturing his tibia so badly an amputation might be required\u201d (PGA Tour 9). This disorder\nprevents Martin from walking the golf course. If he is unable to walk due to health reasons,\nhis only option to find out just how good he actually is requires the use of a golf cart. Yet\nthe PGA has rules against the usage of golf carts.\nThe PGA Tour has a rule saying players must walk the third and final stage of the golf\ntournament. WhileinQSchool, aqualifyingschoolforprofessionalgolfers, Martinsubmitted\na request to be able to use a golf cart throughout the entire tournament. The PGA Tour\ndenied his request. The PGA feels that walking is an integral part of the game, and being\nallowed to use a golf cart would give the individual an advantage over the rest of the field\n(Finchem 2). Subsequently, the PGA thought that if Martin used a golf cart it would\nfundamentally alter the nature of the tournament by giving him an unfair advantage.\nUndertheAmerican\u2019swithDisabilitiesAct,Martinfiledalawsuitwhichreads,\u201cProhibitsdis-\ncrimination on the basis of employment, state and local government, public accommodations,\ncommercial facilities, transportation and telecommunications\u201d (United States). Martin filed\nhis suit specifically under Title III of the Act which requires public accommodations to make\nreasonable modifications for the disabled. The PGA Tour, a recreational facility and activity,\nis considered a public accommodation. Both the lower courts and the Supreme Court agreed\nwith Martin. He had a right to use a motorized golf cart under the ADA because the PGA\nTour is a public accommodation, and that it would not fundamentally alter the nature of\nthe tournament. The PGA Tour, Q School, and any \u201c. . . golf courses, including play areas,\nare places of public accommodation during professional golf tournaments\u201d (PGA Tour 2).\nCasey Martin was discriminated against because of his disability and because golf course\nare specifically identified as a public accommodation under Title III of the ADA.\nOriginally Casey Martin was told by the PGA Tour that they would not accommodate his\ndisability. The PGA feels that the playing field must be the same for every player, and\nallowing Martin to use a cart would give him an advantage over other players. The PGA\nargues that walking, and the loss of concentration due to fatigue, is part of the challenge of\nplaying professional golf at its highest level (Finchem 2). The PGA also argues that using a\ngolf cart would take out much of the physical conditioning factor of the sport. The PGA\nTour claimed they were not required to allow Casey Martin to use a cart, but in the end it\nturns out that the PGA was required because the tournament is a public place.\nAs it is organized, \u201cAny member of the public may enter the Q School by submitting two\nletters of recommendation and paying a $3,000 entry fee\u201d (PGA Tour 1). The golfers of\nthe PGA pay to be a part of the PGA, therefore they are considered customers, and would\nmake the PGA a public accommodation. The golfers pay for privileges such as Q School and\nto compete in the tournaments. Since Martin paid to play professional golf, and also paid\nhis way through his qualifying school, he should not have been discriminated against while\ncompeting. The Supreme Court ruled that Martin was a customer of competition when he\npractices his profession. Martin was a customer to this public accommodation, therefore the\nPGA Tour should be required to make reasonable modifications, and allow Casey Martin to\nuse his golf cart.\nAlso, Casey Martin\u2019suse ofagolf cartwouldnot \u201cfundamentally alter\u201dthecore natureofthe\ntournament. The PGA Tour argues, \u201cWhile carts have become commonplace for recreational\ngolf, walkinghadbeenanintegralpartofthetournamentcompetitionthroughoutthegame\u2019s\nhistory. Walking is a fundamental part of tournaments in championship competition1s39. .\n.\u201d (Finchem 2). Yet the core nature of golf is aiming for the hole. \u201cThe use of carts is not\ninconsistent with the fundamental character of golf, the essence of which has always been\nshot-making. The walking rule contained in petitioner\u2019s hard cards is neither an essential\nattribute of the game itself nor an indispensable feature of tournament golf\u201d (PGA Tour\n3). This means that the game of golf is based on where the ball ends up and not on the\nendurance of walking. Yes golf is a game of strategy where one attempts to put the golf ball\nin the hole in the fewest strokes possible. But golf is not a mellow version of cross country\nrunning. Nor is it based on how far you can walk.\nThe golfers participating in the PGA Tour tournament do not need the walking stage of\ngolf, because it is not essential to the game of golf. The PGA will argue that it is essential\nbecause of the endurance factor. However, walking the distance of the course is not part of\nthe formal rules of golf (DREDF 2). It is the golfer\u2019s choice to walk the course. The PGA\nwill argue that weather affects game play. \u201cUsing a cart would be somewhat of an advantage\nall the time and could be a great advantage in many circumstances . . .rain delays . . .the\ntemperature and the humidity are both in the nineties . . .\u201d (Finchem 2). In this case\nhowever, the variety of conditions the player would have to deal with would only matter if\nthey were playing a multi-day tournament (DREDF 2). If a tournament is only one day in\nlength, the fatigue factor of walking will generally be minimal compared to the other factors.\nIn the end, Casey Martin would be enduring enough pain as it is with his disorder. The\npain caused by his disorder can be compared to other golfers walking the final stage of\nthe tournament. Martin\u2019s disability causes him enough pain going from cart to shot that\nhe would not have an advantage (DREDF 2). The PGA tour argues that it would indeed\nbe unfair because other golfers would be walking, and that Casey Martin would have an\nadvantage over everyone else walking the course. No matter what the PGA believes, the\nSupreme Court agrees with Martin, \u201c. . . that even with the use of a cart, the fatigue Martin\nsuffers from coping with his disability is greater than the fatigue his able-bodied competitors\nendure from walking the course\u201d (PGA Tour). Even with the cart, Casey Martin must walk\nover a mile during an 18-hole round of golf. The combination of Casey Martin\u2019s pain and\nthe distance he will still walk would be enough that the other golfers would still have an\nadvantage over him.\nAll Casey Martin ever wanted to do was to be the best he could possibly be. Does the PGA\nTour have the right to shatter Casey Martin\u2019s dreams because of a degenerative disorder?\nIn his own words Casey Martin says, \u201cWithout the ADA I never would have been able to\npursue my dream of playing golf professionally\u201d (Faces 1). With a clarity the PGA should\nhave began with, the Supreme Court agreed that Casey Martin did indeed have the right\nto pursue his dream. (This essay is from Stephanie Wolf and has been modified to fit the\nparameters of this book.) Argument\nSample Exposition Essay\n27.7 The Fallacies of Argument\nOkay; your paper is filled with quality research. You're feeling good about your paper. But\nwhen you get the paper back your instructor has left a comment like, \"This is an argument\nfallacy\". So now you're left wondering what is \"false\" about the argument; and what is this\n\"argument fallacy\"?\nArgumentative fallacies are sometimes called \"logical fallacies\". Usually these \"fallacies\" are\ncreated when the reasoning behind the argument lacks validity. A lack of validity weakens\nyour argument, and then leads to a failure to provide a sufficient claim.\nDon't feel badly if your paper says \"fallacy of argument\" on it. This is a common error\nin argumentative papers. In fact, a detailed list of \"logical fallacies\" can be found in\nthe \"Common Errors\" section of this book (just below \"Run-On\" sentences and \"Sentence\nFragments\". If you would like to see the list of logical fallacies, please visit The Writers\nHandbook1.\n\"Argumentativefallacy\"canbecausedbyyour'negligence'orlackofrigorandattentionwhile\nmaking a certain argument. In other words, a very general argument, not followed through\nrigorously, can end up in something as an 'argumentative fallacy'. So, never generalize; don't\njust say and leave -- pursue your point to its logical termination.\n27.8 A Side Note\nMany topics that are written about in college are very controversial. When approaching a\ntopic it is critical that you think about all of the implications that your argument makes. If,\nfor example, you are writing a paper on abortion, you need to think about your audience.\nThere will certainly be people in each of your classes that have some sort of relationship to\nthis topic that may be different than yours. While you shouldn't let others' feelings sway\nyour argument, you should approach each topic with an open mind and stay away from\npersonal attacks. People may be offended by something you say, but if you have taken\nthe time to think about the things that go into your paper, you should have no problem\ndefending it.\n27.9 Further Reading\n\u2022 Argumentation and Advocacy\nThisscholarlyjournalcoversthevariousareasofargumentation.

The tools you have learned from previous sections will help you\nto be a more successful writer with advanced topics. There are many different reasons for\nwhich one writes. It could be for school, work, or even the community. The topics discussed\nin this section are writing for the humanities, sciences, and business. Each chapter will\nhighlight the unique features that separate these genres and give practical examples of how\neach uses writing to achieve goals.\n29.1.1 Writing in the Humanities\nWriting in the Humanities includes theoretical writing, creative writing, interpretive writing,\nand analytical writing. Each of these qualifies as writing in Humanities, but each uses a\nsignificantly different style.\nTheoretical writing includes historical and philosophical writing. This topic focuses on the\nideas of past cultures and people. It also includes writing about your own theories.\n*Thomas Paine's \"Common Sense\"\n\u2022 The philosophies of Buddha\n\u2022 Einstein's theories on Nuclear Physics|caption=Sample Theoretical Writings\nCreative writing uses a more imaginative approach and can include storytelling, personal\nexpression, or even free association. Poetry, song lyrics, short stories, non-fiction, and fiction\nnovels are all included under creative writing. In creative writing, there is more freedom\nfor the writer to explore feelings or ideas. Some forms of creative writing, like sonnets,\ndo include formatting concerns or restrictions. Creative writing is more concerned with\npersonal expression than adhering to tradition, however.\n145 Overview of Advanced Topics\n*A science-fiction story\n\u2022 A biography of what the US would have been like if it lost WWII\n\u2022 A story about your future life|caption=Sample Creative Writings\nInterpretive writers do more than simply summarize the text they study. Interpretive\nwriting improves understanding by asking a series of good questions. The interpretive writer\nintroduces their own ideas about a text, but they must always back up claims by referring\nto the text they analyze, or another appropriate source.\nAnalytical writing is much like interpretive writing, but also goes a bit further. Not only\nwill you provide information, but you will also analyze it. This includes asking \u201chow\u201d and\n\u201cwhy.\u201d You will need to take a critical approach to develop an understanding of the topic\nbefore writing about it.\nThis chapter1 will expand on the differences of theoretical, creative, interpretive, and\nanalytical writing, and will share tips on how to write successfully while using those different\napproaches.\n29.1.2 Writing in the Sciences\nWriting in the sciences focuses on informing the reader of new discoveries, and assisting\nreaders in discovering truth through facts. This form of writing should not leave anything\nopen to interpretation by the reader. Information should be presented with solid data given\nin detail. Science writing is generally written in past tense and should be concise. Common\nforms of science writing includes lab reports and literature reviews.\nWriting in science includes two main categories: natural sciences and social sciences. Natural\nsciences include pure science and applied science. Pure sciences are life sciences, physical\nsciences, and earth sciences. Applied sciences include medical sciences, engineering sciences,\nand computer science.\nSocial sciences focus on human behavior and societies. Social sciences involve documenting\nactual events as they happen as with case studies. Categories of social science include\npsychology, anthropology, political science, sociology, education, business, and economics.\n* Story regarding global warming\n\u2022 Story based on the research of estrogen\n|caption=Sample Scientific Writings\n1 Chapter 30 on page 149\n146 Overview: Advanced Topics\nThis chapter2 will explain the distinct features of writing for the sciences.\n29.1.3 Writing in Business\nBusiness writing has a practical bent to it. Writing in business often means explaining a\nsituation, event, or change. The author typically has a very specific action they wish the\naudience to take, and that action often contains time concerns as well.\nGood business writing is concise and focuses directly on the stated purpose. A business\ndocumentneedstobeorganizedinamannerthatdirectsareader'seyetothemostimportant\npoints. Awell-writtenbusinessdocumentshouldallowthereadertoquicklyscanforpurpose,\ntime constraints, and a contact person who can answer further questions.\nWriting in business can include: memos, cover letters, resumes, project reports, proposals,\nthank-you letters, emails, and business plans.\nThischapter3 willgiveyouthetechniquesneededtobuildaresumeaswellasmanyimportant\ndocuments used in a business setting.\n2 Chapter 31 on page 161\n3 Chapter 32 on page 173\n147  30 Writing in the Humanities\n30.1 Introduction\n\"All great literature addresses directly or indirectly two questions: What kind of world is\nthis? and How should we live in it?\"\n--Christopher Clausen\nWritinginthehumanitiesincludesposingquestionsdealingwithhumanvalues. Theultimate\ngoal in writing in the humanities is to explain\/share the human experience, to use writing as\na tool to reflect upon life, and to tell how life should, or should not, be lived. \"Humanities\"\nas a discipline includes not only literature, but also philosophy, ethics, performing arts, fine\narts, history, aspects of anthropology and cultural studies, foreign languages, linguistics,\njurisprudence, political science, and sociology. In a humanities class, you might be asked to\nattempt the analysis of a poem, a performance or a play, a painting, a film or even a musical\nperformance.\nThere is often a difference in feel between writing in the Sciences and writing in the\nHumanities. Writing in the Sciences is often convergent (meaning oriented toward finding\nor articulating a specific answer to a specific question). Writing in the Humanities is often\ndivergent (meaning oriented toward exploration of multiple answers to multiple questions).\n30.2 Categories of Humanities Writing\nWriting in the Humanities falls into three categories: theoretical writing, creative writing,\nand interpretive and analytical writing. Term papers and research papers are included in\nthis discipline of writing when their topics pertain to the field of humanities.\n30.2.1 Theoretical Writing\nTheoretical writing involves writing on a topic from a theoretical perspective. In physics, for\nexample, there is a theory on how the galaxy operates called the \"string theory.\" A physics\npaper centered around the string theory would be considered a theoretical paper.\n30.2.2 Creative Writing\nCreative writing attempts to achieve, or create, an affect in the minds of the readers. The\nintendedaffect differs depending on the goals of thewriter. The intention maybeto expound\n149 Writing in the Humanities\non the grieving process (catharsis), or to make a person laugh or cry. The potential results\nare unlimited. Creative writing can also be used as an outlet for people to get their thoughts\nand feelings out and onto paper. Many people enjoy creative writing but prefer not to share\nit. Creative writing can take place in a variety of forms. Poems, short stories, novels, and\neven song lyrics are all examples of creative writing. Viewpoints regarding what exactly is\nencompassed under the term creative writing differ. To some, non-fiction can be considered\ncreative writing because it is done from the author's point of view and may be written in an\nindividual style that engages the reader. In fact, many universities offer courses in \"Creative\nnon-fiction.\" Others like to separate non-fiction from creative writing because it deals with\ndetails that actually took place, even if viewed subjectively. Regardless, the outlook of the\nwriter is what matters, and whether something is considered creative writing or not is less\nimportant than producing a product that you can be proud of.\nNarrator\nA narrator is the voice or person who tells the story. One must never assume that a narrator\nof a story is related to the author in any way. Even if we, as an audience, are aware that the\nauthor of the story once had a similar experience to that of the narrator, we cannot make\nassumptions that there is any truth to the text. When writing or discussing criticism, the\nintent of the author is also off limits because regardless of the author intent, the value of\na text is determined by reader response alone. An example of an author having a similar\nexperience to the narrator of a story she'd written, is Charlotte Perkins Gilman's short story\nThe Yellow Wallpaper. Because the author had released statements revealing that she'd had\na smilar medical treatment in her life to the narrator of her story, we still cannot assume\nthat the narrator and Gilman are one in the same person.\nAFirst-Personnarratoriswhenonepersonnarratesthestory. Thus,areaderwillrecognize\na first-person narrator because the pro-nouns \"I\" and \"my\" will be used. Because the story\nis narrated by one person, we are limited to the thoughts and observations of that person.\nThere are many reasons that an author may choose to use a first-person narrator, but the\nreason is mainly to demonstrate the changes within one particular character, and also to\nbuild suspense. For example, if an author were to suddenly swith a first-person myself novel\nto a third-person narrator, the \"who-done-it\" aspect of the story would be ruined because\nwe would suddenly be able to dive into the minds of multiple characters.\nThere is also Third-person limited and Third-person omniscient. Third-person lim-\nited is when the narrator is limited to the thoughts of one particular character, but there is\na little more freedom than with a first-person narrator because the narrator can more easily\nobserve the behavior of others. Finally, a third-person omniscient narrator is when the lens\nof the storyteller is pulled back even further, but we are able to dive into the minds of any\nand all characters. Therefore, a third-person omniscient narrater is rather God-like in that\nit enables us to know absolutely anything and everything that is happening in the novel.\nThis may sound like the most enjoyable way to compose, but as stated earlier, there are\ndrawbacks to this kind of narrator in that it may be harder to create an element of surprise\nfor the reader.\nLiterary Periods\nDeconstructionism is an approach to literature which suggests that literary works do not\nyield a single, fixed meaning because we can never say what we truly mean in language.\n150 Categories of Humanities Writing\nEarly Modern Era Period extending from about 1500 to 1800, marked by the advent of\ncolonialism and capitalism.\nModernism Writing and art roughly made in at the start of WWI (1914) through the end of\nWWII (1945).\nPostmodernism is a literary and artistic movement that flourished in the late twentieth\ncentury, partly in response to Modernism. A common theme in this kind of work is\nself-reflexiveness.\n1\n30.2.3 Interpretive and Analytical Writing\nInterpretive Writing\n\u2022 An interpretation involves the discovery of meaning in a text (or film or painting, etc.) or\nthe production of meaning in the process of reading a text. Therefore, interpretive writing\nmust address many questions. It tries to assist the reader in understanding specific events\n(literary, cultural, or otherwise) rather than just engaging in summary. For example,\na student writing an interpretive paper about a specific book may try to explain the\nauthor's attitudes or views on a specific subject matter. The writer of the paper then\nuses the evidence found in that book to back up his or her claims. A poor example of\ninterpretive writing is a book report. A good example of interpretive writing is a scholarly\narticle about another text.\nWriting might ask questions such as, \"Why did these events happen?\" or \"What was the\nsignificanceoftheseeventstotheauthorormaincharacter?\"asopposedto,\"Whathappened\"\nor \"How did these events come about?\" The former questions encourage writers to explore\ntheir own thoughts or to delve into the mind of the writer of the text, or even attempt to\nput himself in the shoes of the protagonist. The latter is less challenging, as the book or\npiece of literature will plainly lay this type of information out for the reader.\nAnalytical Writing\n\u2022 Analytical writing examines the components of a text. Writers of analytical essays or\narticles consider information, break it apart, and reconstruct it in order to describe the\ninformation so another reader can make sense of it. Writers must make sense of a work\nbefore they can begin to describe its constituent parts.\n\u2022 Analytical writing focuses on the words \"how\" and \"why.\" A writer often uses each of\nthese two terms to give proof of their current analogies. By using these strong terms, a\nreader can feel that the writer is confident in their work and know \"how\" and \"why\" they\nshould react.\n\u2022 Analytical writing happens in four steps. The first step is to clearly identify the problem,\nthe question, or the issue. The second step is to define the issue. The third step is the\n1 The Bedford Anthology of World Literature\n151 Writing in the Humanities\nactual analysis of the topic. Finally, the fourth step defines the relationship between the\nissue and the analysis of that issue.\nAnalyzing and Interpreting Literature\n\u2022 There is a lot of overlap in the processes of analysis and interpretation, especially when\nwriting about literature. Writing about literature (poems, short stories, plays, etcs) often\ninvolves making an argument that can be backed up with specific examples from the text.\nWhen interpreting a poem the writer should expect that they will have to include specific\nreferences to the lines, words, or phrases to which they are referring. A writer analyzing\nthe main character in The Great Gatsby should include specific references that explain\nwhy they have reached a particular conclusion.\n\u2022 An essay dealing with literature should not be a summary of the text. It doesn't always\nhurt to give a few background examples, but the writer should focus on talking about\nthe portions of the text that emphasize their points, not summarizing the entire piece\nfor the reader. If the reader isn't familiar with the primary text, they can go back and\nread it themselves. The interpreter's job isn't to recap, but to make an argument, and\nhopefully provide some sort of illumination of the work.\n\u2022 A piece of literature should always be referred to in the present tense.\n\u2022 Take a look at this sample essay on the play A Midsummer Night's Dream\n152 Categories of Humanities Writing\nFairies, Duality, and Conflict\nIt\u2019s hard to read A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream without noticing at least some duality within\nthe play. While it\u2019s relatively easy to spot in the \u201clamentable comedy\u201d performed by the\nmechanicals, there are also more nuanced examples that are introduced in Act 2, Scene\n1. This scene reveals some of the play\u2019s duality, specifically in regards to the fairies, as it\ncontinues to build on Act 1\u2019s theme of conflict between lovers.\nThestartofthissceneopenswithPucktalkingwithanotherfairy. Thisisthefirstappearance\nof any fairies and it adds a fantasy, or dream-like, element to the play. The unnamed fairy\nannounces that, \u201cI serve the Fairy Queen, \/ To dew her orb upon the green\u201d (2.1.8-9). This\nfits the idea that many people have of fairies; they are pleasant folk associated with nature.\nNothing about this fairy is threatening or even mischievous. This is directly at odds with\nthe character of Puck. Puck spends his time pretending to be footstools that women can\nsit on, \u201cThen I slip from her bum, down topples she, \/ And \u2018Tailor\u2019 cries, and falls into a\ncough\u201d (2.1.53-54). He \u201cfrights the maidens of the villagery\u201d (2.1.35) and does things like,\n\u201cmislead might wanderers, laughing at their harm?\u201d (2.1.39). While the unnamed fairy is\nout spreading dew upon blades of grass, Puck is out spreading mischief. The unnamed fairy\nrepresents the good within fairy-kind, while Puck represents the potentially threatening. An\nexamination of Puck\u2019s name adds to this. According to the unnamed fairy, Puck is also\nknown as Robin Goodfellow (2.1.34); but, he doesn\u2019t go by that name, he goes by Puck. If\nPuck were a more good-natured fairy, he might prefer to go by the name Robin Goodfellow.\nHowever, his decision to play a darker role than the other fairies mirrors his decision to go\nby a less pleasant sounding moniker. Puck is more of an imp than a fairy. He has a trickster\nmentality that isn\u2019t present in the other fairies.\nPuck and the unnamed fairy are representative of two larger factions, which are each headed\nby a more powerful fairy. At the beginning of the scene the unnamed fairy says she serves\nthe fairy queen, and Puck later reveals who he serves by saying, \u201cI jest to Oberon and make\nhim smile\u201d (2.1.44). Later in this scene Oberon will ask Puck to run an errand for him, and\nthe sensitivity of the errand suggests that Oberon wouldn\u2019t trust just anyone with it. In\naddition to being Oberon\u2019s jester, Puck is also his confidant.\nOberon\u2019sentranceintothescenematchesthemorethreateningdemeanorthatPuckembodies.\nPuck notes that, \u201cOberon is passing fell and wrath, \/ Because that she as her attendant\nhath \/ A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king\u201d (2.1.20-22). Oberon and all he represents\nis at odds with Titania and all that she represents. Oberon and Titania\u2019s conflict is in\naddition to the other conflicts in the play between couples: Theseus and Hippolyta and the\nLysander\/Hermia\/Demetrius\/Helena quartet. It\u2019s also fitting that Oberon and Titania are\narguing over a human boy. The human world has created conflict in the fairy world, just as\nthe fairy world will later on intensify the conflict of the human world of the four lovers.\nOberon and Titania are shown in this scene as having emotions like any ordinary human.\nThis reinforces the bond between the two worlds in the play; the world of fantasy and the\nmore concrete world that the humans live in. Oberon and Titania both have other lovers.\nTitania notes that Oberon has been spending time with Phillida and Hippolyta (2.1.66-71),\nwhile Oberon counters that Hippolyta has been intimate with Theseus (2.1.76-80). They\nargue over infidelity like any humans would in a similar relationship. The fact that they\nboth appear to have cheated on one another may not entirely add up since Titania appears\nto represent a kinder, gentler fairy demographic, as opposed to Oberon\u2019s more threatening\none. But Titania says why she cheated. She calls her infidelities, \u201cthe forgeries of jealousy\u201d\n(2.1.81). Titania is arguing that she only cheated because Oberon drove her to it. Perhaps,\nshe needed more attention than Oberon was willing to give. Perhaps, she was trying to hurt\nOberon like he had hurt her. These are very human reactions and impulses.\nYet, these are not mere humans, but fairies: not just fairies, but fairy royalty. Becau1se53of\nthis wrinkle, their actions, and their discord, has a marked effect on the world around them.\nOnce Oberon started cheating on Titania, Writing in the Humanities\nThe winds, piping to us in vain,\nAs in revenge, have sucked up from the sea\nContagious fogs which, falling in the land,\nHath every pelting river made so proud\nThat they have overborne their continents. (2.1.88-92)\nIn addition to the floods there are also droughts, famine and a host of other issues (2.1.93-\n114). The relationship of these two is clearly the reason for the disturbance in nature. This\nis shown when Titania says, \u201cAnd this same progeny of evils comes \/ from our debate, from\nour dissension. \/ We are their parents and original\u201d (2.1.115-117). The trouble that has\novertaken the natural world is at odds with the preparations concerning the festival that are\ntaking place within Athens. Much as the forest world is a different place than the stone\nwalls of Athens. Yet, despite their differences, nature and the civilized world will interact.\nIt\u2019s impossible to keep them completely apart despite their separate natures.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting how the relationship between Oberon and Titania was prior to their\ndiscord,\nMet we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,\nBy paved fountain or by rushy brook,\nOr in the beached margent of the sea,\nTo dance our ringlets to the whistling wind. (2.1.83-86)\nThey were like two young lovers, who met everywhere and couldn\u2019t get enough of each other\nbefore Oberon ruins things. Titania says to him, \u201cBut with thy brawls thou hast disturbed\nour sport\u201d (2.1.87). Certainly, many relationships encounter problems after an initial period\nof bliss; but, it should also be noted that abusive people often appear to be sweet and caring\nbefore their true colors show. Oberon may just be that cruel. He only wants the Indian boy\nbecause Titania has him; perhaps, specifically because Titania loves him. After all, Oberon\nwants the boy to be a, \u201cKnight of his train, to trace the forests wild\u201d (2.1.25). As the fairy\nking Oberon must have plenty of others whom he could get to fill that type of position.\nTitania, on the other hand, genuinely cares for him. We know this because she, \u201cCrowns\nhim with flowers, and makes him all her joy\u201d (2.1.27). Oberon can\u2019t quite comprehend why\nTitania shouldn\u2019t do what he says and he says so, \u201cWhy should Titania cross her Oberon?\u201d\n(2.1.119). Because Oberon can\u2019t comprehend why Titania would cross him, he sends Puck to\nget him a juice that will allow him to force Titania into submission (2.1.169-174). Oberon\u2019s\nunwillingness to allow Titania\u2019s free spirit to go unpunished is a perfect example of the\ncruel and threatening demeanor of his. The element of fantasy that the fairies add can\nbe dreamlike, but dreams can become nightmares, and Oberon is a darker personality to\ncounter Titania\u2019s light.\nThis scene also has Demetrius and Helena in it, and provides us great insight into their\ncharacters. Demetrius is brushing off Helena and she says,\n154 Categories of Humanities Writing\nI am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,\nThe more you beat me I will fawn on you.\nUse me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,\nNeglect me, lose me; only give me leave,\nUnworthy as I am, to follow you. (2.1.203-207)\nThis works on a variety of levels. For one, it brings into the play a darker, more masochistic,\nidea of love that is at odds with the pure notion of love that the audience may assume\nthat Lysander and Hermia share. It also reveals Helena as a woman who acts the opposite\nof Titania. Titania handles her abusive relationship by seeking love in another\u2019s arms, by\nspending time with the people who care for her, and by devoting her time to a boy. She\nseparates herself from her abuser, Oberon, rather than seeking his company. Hermia seeks\nthe abuse out. She views any attention, no matter how negative, as positive simply because\nit\u2019s some sort of attention. If Demetrius gave her positive attention, perhaps she wouldn\u2019t\nbe happy for long. Demetrius, on the other hand, tells Helena that looking at her makes\nhim sick (2.1.213). He talks to her as if he hates her, and it takes a hard-heart to look so\ncruelly on someone so pathetic. Oberon happens to witness the exchange between these two\nand he sends Puck to put Demetrius under the same spell that he wants Titania put under\n(2.1.259-266). It\u2019s this part of the scene that sets into motion the rest of the play, as Titania\nis put under the spell\u2019s effects, and Puck inadvertently finds Lysander instead of Demetrius.\nIn addition to setting the stage for the action that will come afterward, this scene reveals\nmuch about the characters within it. It introduces the fairies and their duality, and it builds\nup a darker aspect of the play through the continuation of conflict that acts to counteract\nsome of the lightheartedness of the play.\nSample Essay\nHere the writer has chosen to focus on one specific scene in the play, and how it fits their\nargument about the duality and conflict present within the play. Notice that throughout\nthe entire essay there are numerous examples from within the text. Had the author not\nincluded these, or had they just summarized everything briefly, the essay wouldn't be as\nstrong as it currently is. Here the reader can see exactly what lines make the writer think\nthe way they do. Also, notice that the paper isn't a summary of what happens in the scene.\nWhen the writer gives details about what happens in the scene, it is because these details\nrelate directly to the topic of their paper.\n30.2.4 Research Papers and Term Papers\nTerm papers have a variety of elements that make them stand out from other papers. They\ncarry three distinct characteristics. First, there is a large amount of research that goes into\na term paper. The research contains various findings such as: facts, statistics, interviews,\nquotes, etc. Researching and gathering data must include understanding that information\nonce it is compiled. The second characteristic is the amount of preparation it takes in\ngathering, compiling, analyzing, and sorting through everything in order to create a draft of\nyour data. Finally, the third characteristic involves knowing the rules that must be followed\nwhen writing a specific term paper in the humanities discipline. These rules will generally\nbe conveyed by your instructor.\n155 Writing in the Humanities\nWriting the research paper involves a bit of detective work. While there is much reading\nto be done on the chosen topic, reading is not the only pathway to gain information. As a\nwriter in the humanities, you can also conduct interviews, surveys, polls, and observation\nclinics. You should research and discover as much information as you can about the given\ntopic so you can form a coherent and valid opinion.\n30.3 Elements of the Humanities Paper\nMany styles of documentation are used when writing the humanities paper. Choosing the\nstyle depends on the subject being addressed in the paper and the style your instructor may\nprefer you use.\nWhenitcomesdowntoactuallywritingyourpaper, besuretoincludethefollowingelements:\nan introduction, a thesis statement, the body of the paper (which should include quotations,\nand, of course, the citations), and the conclusion.\n30.3.1 Introduction\nLike most papers and essays, an introduction is absolutely necessary when writing in the\nhumanities. There can be some confusion as to which should come first; the introduction or\nthe thesis statement. This decision could probably be clarified by asking your instructor.\nManywritersincludethethesisstatementintheirintroduction. Generallyspeaking, however,\nthe introduction usually comes before the thesis statement.\nThe introduction should grab your reader and make them interested in continuing to read\nyour paper. Ask a question, say something powerful, or say something controversial. Be\nspecific, not vague. Say something interesting, not mundane. Relay something the reader\nmay not know, not something that is public knowledge. The idea is to get the reader's\nattention, and keep it.\nA good intro may go something like this:\n\"Imagine yourself walking out of class feeling refreshed and relaxed because your day is\nalmost done. You race down the stairs and out the doors just to take in the amazing scent\nof fresh outside air when suddenly you smell something completely wretched. You notice\nsomething that resembles a small grey cloud coming out of a fellow student's mouth. Then\nyour throat begins to feel clogged and just when you can't take it any longer, your lungs give\nin and you feel as if you can no longer breathe. You think to yourself, 'What's happening to\nme? Am I dying?' No, not exactly. Your lungs and the rest of your body have just been\naffected by what is commonly known as passive smoking, which is becoming one of the\nleading causes of death in the United States.\"\nAfter the introduction has been written, you can then go into your thesis statement. Many\npeople regard the thesis statement as a continuation of the introduction, only in the next\nparagraph.\n156 Elements of the Humanities Paper\n30.3.2 Thesis Statement\nThe thesis statement should come at the beginning of the paper. It will introduce the reader\nto the topic you intend to address, and gives them a hint of what to expect in the pages\nthat follow. Thesis statements should avoid words and phrases such as, \"In my opinion...\" or\n\"I think that...\" Start your thesis by taking a stand immediately; be firm in your statement,\nbut not pushy. You'll either be given your topic for your paper or you will choose it yourself.\nIn either case, after the topic is chosen, write a thesis statement that clearly outlines the\nargument you intend to address in the paper. The thesis statement will be the center of\nyour paper. It should address one main issue. Throughout the paper, whatever you write\nwill be focused on the thesis statement. As your paper develops, you may find you will want\nto, or need to, revise your thesis statement to better outline your paper. As your paper\nevolves, so does your thesis. In other words, when writing your thesis statement, keep your\npaper in mind, and when writing your paper, keep your thesis statement in mind. Your\npaper will defend your thesis, so write your paper accordingly.\nFor example, if the topic is \"Analyzing Mark Twain's 'Huckleberry Finn,'\" your thesis\nstatement might address the social implications or meanings behind the characters chosen for\nthe story. Keeping the thesis statement in mind, you would then write your paper about the\ncharacters in the story. Let's say you are writing a philosophy paper. Your thesis statement\nmight include two opposing arguments, with the hint that you intend to argue or prove\none side of the argument. Many thesis statements are written in such a way as to try to\nprove an argument or point of view, but challenge yourself; make your thesis statement a\nstatement of how you plan to disprove an argument. Maybe you want to attempt to show\nyour readers why a specific point of view does not work.\nYour thesis statement should address one main issue. It takes a point of view or an argument,\nand the paper is the development of this argument. If your thesis statement is too simple,\nobvious, or vague, then you need to work on it a little more. You should try to write it in a\nway that will catch your reader's attention, making it interesting and thought-provoking. It\nshould be specific in nature, and address the theme of the entire paper. The thesis statement\nmay be written to try to convince the reader of a specific issue or point of view. It may also\naddress an issue to which there is no simple solution or easy answers; remember, make it\nthought-provoking. Many thesis statements invite the reader to disagree.\nDon't be alarmed if you find yourself midway through your paper and wanting to change\nyour thesis statement. This will happen. Sometimes a writer will start out thinking they\nknow exactly the point they want to make in their paper, only to find halfway through that\nthey've taken a slightly different direction. Don't be afraid to modify your thesis statement.\nBut a word of caution; if you modify your thesis statement, be sure to double check your\npaper to ensure that it is supported by the thesis. If you have changed your thesis statement,\nit would be wise, even advisable, to have a third party read your paper to be sure that the\npaper supports the thesis and the revised thesis describes the paper.\n30.3.3 Body\nThe \"body\" of your paper contains the evidence, analysis, andreasoning that support your\nthesis. Often the topic of the paper is divided into subtopics. Typically, each subtopic is\n157 Writing in the Humanities\ndiscussed in a separate paragraph, but there is nothing wrong with continuing a subtopic\nthroughout multiple paragraphs. It is good practice to begin each paragraph with a topic\nsentence that introduces the subject of the new paragraph and helps transition between\nparagraphs. A topic sentence will help keep you focused while writing the paragraph, and it\nwill keep your reader focused while reading it.\n30.3.4 Conclusion\nThe purpose of a conclusion is to \"wrap up\" the discussion of your paper. Especially if the\npaper is a long one, it is a good idea to \"re-cap\" the main ideas presented in your paper. If\nyour paper is argumentative, you'd likely want to re-enforce the standpoint introduced in\nyour thesis statement; however, rather than repeating your thesis, offer closing statements\nthat make use of all the information you've presented to support your thesis. Try to \"echo\"\nyour thesis so that your reader understands that you have fulfilled the \"promise\" a thesis\nstatement implies, but give your reader a sense of closure rather than simply restating\neverything you said above just ending it.\nHere are some strategies for closing your discussion:\nAfter summing up your main points\/thesis you might\n\u2022 Comment on the significance of the topic in general: why should your reader care?\n\u2022 Look to the future: Is there more work to be done on the topic? Are there predictions\nyou can make about your topic?\n\u2022 Ask something of your reader: Is there something your reader can do? Should do?\n30.3.5 Argumentative Research Papers\nOne of the main things that differentiates a college level research paper from research papers\nbelow the college level is they almost always will be argumentative; that is, they will be\ntaking a stance. The research is then used to back up the argument of the writer, or to\nput their argument into context. Students new to college will often attempt to simply\nprovide information that makes the research paper becoming stale and unnecessary. If all\nthe paper is doing is repackaging old information, why not just go back to the original\nsource? Papers that just provide information risk unintentional plagiarism. If none of the\ninformation provided contains your own insights, then failing to cite everything means that\nit is plagiarized. Yet, most students would be reluctant to cite the entirety of their paper.\n30.3.6 Plagiarism\nPlagiarism results from including non-trivial information (ideas, facts, etc) from another\nsource without acknowledging its source. Plagiarism is one of the most serious offenses\nthat can be committed in academia and it involves varying degrees. Plagiarism at its most\nblatant includes handing in an entire paper that is not one's own; it also includes failing\nto document one's sources. When writing a research paper, avoid unintentional plagiarism.\nBecause almost no knowledge other than eye-witness accounts is truly original, be sure to\n158 Resources To Use\nfind sources for all non-trivial information. Plagiarism can be grounds for failing a paper or\nthe course as a whole.\n30.4 Resources To Use\nThe humanities category offers many good sources from which to gather information. The\nInternet is fast becoming an important source of information for humanities writing. There\nare many history sites, journalism and news sites, sites focusing on the history of film,\nsites dedicated to womens' issues, and so on. More traditional physical resources include\ndictionaries, encyclopedias, biographies, indexes, abstracts, and periodicals, and our old\nfriend, the library.\nAs you can see, there are many resources from which to choose when writing your paper.\nStart at the most basic level and progress from there. For example, if you are writing about\na specific work of a famous author, the obvious place to begin is with a careful reading of\nthe work in question. Once you are done, try to articulate what you know to be true, what\nyou think is probably true, and what is open to question: that is, what you might need to\nfind out. It is helpful to actually go through the physical process of writing out two or three\nkey questions that you would like to focus on.\nAt that point, you may want begin your further researches with a search through an\nencyclopedia, or do an online search for available resources, including interviews. After you\nhave found the information you need there, you might then search a through a card catalog\nin a library for specific books. You may find that while searching for one specific book you\nwill stumble upon many other useful books on the same subject. You can then begin to\nlook through book reviews for information on your subject. Book reviews can be especially\ninformative in that they will often will identify important themes, raise new questions, and\nbroaden your sense of what is at stake in the text. Next, you may want to try searching for\narticles in periodicals, and even abstracts of articles, which will provide a summary of the\ncontent of the potential article.\n30.5 External Links\n\u2022 Academic Writing Support Materials for Humanities Students2\n\u2022 Four Keys to Writing in the Humanities3\n\u2022 Conventions of Writing Papers in Humanities4\n2 http:\/\/www.dartmouth.edu\/~writing\/materials\/student\/humanities\/write.shtml\n3 http:\/\/darkwing.uoregon.edu\/~munno\/Writing\/FourWritingIdeas.html\n4 http:\/\/www.geneseo.edu\/~easton\/humanities\/convhumpap.html\n159  31 Writing in the Sciences\n31.1 Introduction\nWriting in the sciences fulfills one of two purposes:\n1. Inform the reader of new discoveries\n2. Assist the reader in clarifying the truth using new facts or perspectives\nA comparison: While writing in the humanities is used to explore the human condition,\nwriting in the sciences is used to examine nature, human experience, and\/or technology.\nThis leads to the two major types of papers written in the sciences:\n1. Lab report\n2. Literature review\nWriting in the sciences requires elements not necessarily needed when writing in the hu-\nmanities. It requires data, evidence, facts, and precision, which in turn require intimate\nattention to detail. The goal of writing in the sciences is to clearly present what you have\ndiscovered or what you did. This generally requires the writing to be done in the past tense.\nThe language used should allow no room for interpretation by the reader. The nature and\nsubject matter of the ideas in your paper must be presented in a factual style, leaving out\nfigurative or emotional language.\nBesides lab reports and literature reviews, writing in the sciences also includes reviews for\na peer or textbook, or grant proposals and equipment or facility requests. It is easy to\nget caught up using jargon and highly technical language. While this language may be\nappropriate in certain cases, you should know your audience and avoid using words they\nwill not understand (also including definitions where appropriate).\nSpace occasionally becomes an issue when writing in the sciences. For example, grant\nproposal applications and abstracts require the text to be limited to a short paragraph.\nTherefore, an indispensable tool for the scientific paper is the ability to summarize quickly\nand get to the point. An example grant proposal may include the following sentences:\n\"Our preliminary research shows a high probability of success if allowed to develop. This\nrequires us to find additional monetary help, as well as a facility to use long term. We are\nasking for your company's help.\"\nAlthough you may include a few facts or numbers to back up your claim of success, this is\nthe general format for such a request.\nThere are basic tips to keep in mind while writing your scientific paper.\n\u2022 Be detailed\n\u2022 Remain focused on your topic\n161 Writing in the Sciences\n\u2022 Leave figurative language out\n\u2022 Be precise\n\u2022 Define jargon based on assumed audience knowledge\nThere are two categories of sciences writing; social sciences and natural sciences.\n31.2 Social Sciences\nWhen writing in the social sciences, the writer will spend less time in the library researching\ndata, and a majority of time documenting actual events. Writing in the social sciences is the\nstudy of human behavior, the value systems of people, and the interactions between people,\nwhether in the family unit or simply in a group setting.\nWriting in this discipline can be a very challenging experience. Gathering the data and\ninterpreting the information can be tedious. Interviews are conducted, and attitudes must\nbe examined and recorded. But recording data gathered from studying human beings is\ndifficult because the human mind is an ever-changing thing.\nOne key element to writing a paper in the social sciences is the art of taking a stand. Choose\nyour topic, make your claim, provide evidence to support your claim, and finally, convince\nyour reader that your claim is the one with which to side. Take a hard look at both sides\nof the issue you intend on addressing. Doing so will prepare you to defend arguments in\nopposition to your viewpoint. Because issues in the social sciences are subjective, the writer\nshould expect some degree of opposing opinions and even, possibly, some controversy. This\nis why it is suggested that when you write a social sciences paper you choose a topic that\nyou either possess first hand knowledge, know a great deal of information on, or simply a\ntopic about which you are passionate.\nCharts and graphs are common elements included in the social sciences paper. A valuable\nsource of information for the social scientist is a government document. These documents\ncontain the most up-to-date information in a variety of fields.\nWriting in the social sciences uses a technical vocabulary.\nSocial sciences attempt to study and describe human behavior and societies. The social\nsciences can be broken down into further into the following categories:\n31.2.1 Psychology\nThe case study is one of the main writing choices in psychology. These are often studies of a\npatient seeking help through psychotherapy. These types of case studies can generally be\ndivided into five sections:\n1. Background Information\nThis section describes the person based on information a therapist would get from the\nperson during an intake interview. This would include, but is not limited to: demographic\ninformation, family history, and history of symptoms.\n162 Social Sciences\nThefollowingthreesectionswillconsiderhowapersonwouldreacttothreegeneralcategories\nof psychotherapy. In each section, the following questions should be answered:\n\u2022 What is the therapy like?\n\u2022 What does the person talk about or do in that therapy?\n\u2022 What is the therapist's role?\n\u2022 How would this person react to that therapist role?\n\u2022 Would the person benefit from this therapy? Why or why not?\n2. Psychoanalytic Therapy\nThis type of treatment could be a traditional or contemporary style of psychoanalysis. In\nother words, the typical patient laying on a couch and talking about his or her feelings,\nor a more contemporary approach of question and answer, or another setting in which\nthe patient feels more comfortable. A form of psycho-dynamic therapy (changing up the\nenvironment for the patient) could also be used.\n3. Behavioral Therapy\nThis could be a form of behavioral therapy, cognitive therapy, or a mixture of both.\n4. Humanistic Therapy\nThis could be existential therapy, gestalt therapy, Zen therapy, or whatever style seems to\nfit the patient. This is a very progressive form of psychotherapy.\n5. Conclusion\nThis section should draw an overall conclusion of how the person in question would react\nto each kind of considered therapy. The patient's feelings do need to be taken into account\nwhen recommending the best treatment, as no one can be helped when they do not\nwant to be. A final recommendation is made, and the case study is usually reviewed by\ncolleagues, or a board or some kind, to comment and recommend a course of action to\nthe psychologist.\nPlaces you may want to look for current information include psychology encyclopedias and\nabstracts and mental health journals.\n(Further resources to consider follow at the end of this section.)\n31.2.2 Anthropology\nPresenting a case study is a common form of presenting the anthropology paper. The writer\nis looking at and analyzing the past.\nThere are specific guidelines to follow when writing an anthropology paper. Stick to the\nfacts and document these thoroughly in the reference list. Quotations are important, but\nnot as important as data.\nBecause anthropology is such a specialized field, be sure that you re-read your paper several\ntimes to be sure that it is comprehensible to a person who may not be a specialist in the field.\nIn other words, can your average college student understand what you are talking about?\nThe trick here is to find a balance in this paper; it must be scholarly, yet understandable.\n163 Writing in the Sciences\n31.2.3 Political Science\nWriting case studies is the main type of writing in this discipline. When writing a paper\nin political science, you will probably be analyzing how different political organizations\nfunction, both individually and as a group. While many of the other categories of the social\nsciences involve directly observing the group dynamics, writing a paper for political science\ninvolves indirect observation. You will pick one specific behavior to observe and focus your\npaper on that chosen behavior.\nWriting for political science can include any level of the government; city, state or federal.\nPlaces you may want to look for current information include government documents and\nnewspaper articles. You should expect to be able to support and defend the chosen topic or\nargument that is the subject of your paper, and do so in a convincing and scholarly manner.\nIf you accomplish all this, and make it a sound political argument, you have then written a\nsolid political science paper.\n31.2.4 Sociology\nWriting a good sociology paper includes a clear thesis statement. While this is important\nin all papers requiring a thesis statement, the field of sociology carries with it a potential\ndanger; taking sides.\nWriting about sociology is about studying human behavior and the interaction between\nindividuals or groups. An effective sociology paper will analyze these interactions and remain\nobjective. The pitfall that many writers fall into when writing a sociology paper is that\nthey take sides, and as a result they will slant their terminology toward one view or another.\nThis is the trick to a successful sociology paper; staying on the median.\nThe case study to be the primary focus in sociology writing. In this discipline, writing about\ngroup dynamics is a key element.\n31.2.5 Education\nMany topics are covered in the education section of the social sciences, including students\nwith special needs and child development. The instructor may choose to assign a topic for\neach individual student or the class as a whole. This gives the group the opportunity to\nwork together and developed a more refined paper. The case study is a common type of\npaper chosen for a group assignment. Other times, the education instructor may allow each\nstudent to choose his or her own topic related to the education field. If that is the case,\nchoose a topic that is of interest to you. You may not have a lot of knowledge about your\nchosen topic, but if you are genuinely interested in it, the information will be easy to come\nby and just as easy to understand.\nSome of the possible types of papers you may be required to write include literature reviews,\nan analysis paper, case studies, research papers and lab papers. There are many more types\nof papers to write in this discipline, so be sure to clarify with your instructor what he or she\nexpects.\n164 Social Sciences\n31.2.6 Economics\nWhen writing a paper in the economics discipline, the goal is to provide the reader with a\nclear understanding of the different (or specific chosen) areas of economics. It also seeks\nto define the many areas of economics, such as goods, services, and simple the state of\neconomics in our society.\nThe economics paper may be as simple as a journal review (the Wall Street Journal, for\nexample). Academic journals will be used often, as will statistical data from government\nsources.\nOne important thing to remember when writing in this discipline: be sure your vocabulary\nreflects the nature of the subject. Use topic-specific words and avoid personal observations.\nBe as factual as possible, avoiding jumping to unsubstantiated conclusions.\n31.2.7 Elements of the Social Sciences Paper\nWhenitcomesdowntoactuallywritingyourpaper, besuretoincludethefollowingelements:\nan introduction, a thesis statement, the body of the paper, and the conclusion. Many social\nscientists use these headings in their paper.\nOne element of the social science paper that greatly differs from the humanities paper is that\nit should be written in such a way that the reader can take any section from the paper and\nread it independently from the rest of the paper, without having to look back at any other\nsection. It is this type of technical writing that sets the social sciences paper apart from the\nhumanities paper; each section is its own mini-paper. Knowing your audience members will\ngreatly assist you in writing your social sciences paper.\nA social science paper include many elements such as a title page, an abstract, thesis\nstatement, introduction, body, conclusion and bibliography.\nYourtitle pageshouldincludethesubjectortitleofyourpaper, yourname(and, ifrequired,\nyour address and phone number), and the current date. Some instructors also require you\ninclude the name of the course along with course number. An abstract is a short summary\nof the ideas you will be proposing in your paper. It is the place to state the argument you\nintend to address. You can do so by writing an outline of the background information for the\npaper. When writing your abstract, consider what experiments you did and what kinds of\ninterviews you conducted. The abstract will be set aside from the rest of the paper, usually\nin the beginning. It will be the only element of the paper on its own page. An effective\nabstract will be able to summarize the paper with anywhere between 100 and 300 words.\nThe thesis statement will also come at the beginning of your paper. It will state the\npurpose of your argument and will introduce your claim to a specific type of human behavior.\nYour thesis is generally a part of your introduction. Your introduction will introduce your\npaper's main ideas. Keep them succinct, but make them interesting. Some questions to\nanswer in your introduction may include: Why did you choose this topic? Is there a need\nfor the general public to know about this issue, and why? How does this issue affect you, if\nat all? Define the problem clearly. Give examples so the reader knows exactly why this is\na problem and how it affects society. Your instructor may want your introduction to be a\nseparate element of the paper or a part of the body of your paper.\n165 Writing in the Sciences\nToward the beginning of the body of your paper you will put your hypothesis. If you\nconducted experiments, what did you think would happen when you first began them?\nWorking through the body of the paper you should cover the testing of the hypothesis, along\nwith the discussion of any research conducted. The body of the social sciences paper will\ninclude many elements: the background of the problem or issue you are addressing (which\naddresses the issue of topic importance), your rationale (which justifies your choice of topics),\nyour statement of qualification (which outlines why you, as a writer, as qualified to write\non the subject), a survey of literature (which denotes the sources you used in forming your\nhypothesis), the methods of research used, the time estimate outline (for completing your\nexperiments\/projects), and any information about budget limitations. The body is where\nyou will include any charts or graphs that will assist you in reporting your information.\nSupporting discussion should be written to explain these elements.\nIn the conclusion of the social sciences paper, you should recap the information you\naddressed in the body of the paper, keeping in close contact with the thesis. Did your test\nresults differ from your hypothesis? If so, why? The conclusion should explain how the data\nsupported or did not support your hypothesis. During your entire conclusion, you should\nalways back up the main theme of your paper.\nYou will certainly need to include a works cited page (bibliography) to credit any sources\nused in your paper. Also, many education research papers include an appendix. You may\ninclude charts, graphs, and definitions. Most social sciences papers use the APA (American\nPsychological Association) format for documentation style, however, you will want to discuss\nstyle with your instructor before you begin your paper.\n31.2.8 Resources to Use\nDifferent resources you will use in order to complete your social sciences paper will provide\ndifferent levels of information. An encyclopedia will provide basic information in pretty\ngeneral terms. The information here will be in a the form of a summary, and will not be\nvery comprehensive in nature. This is where books, a better source for information, will\nbe beneficial. When you search for one specific book, this search may lead you to several\nother valuable books that you find you will want to reference in your paper. Finally, journal\narticles should be the final source you should rely on for information. Journal articles\nwill provide the most comprehensive and up-to-date information in the subject you are\nresearching. This is one of the reasons that it is important to use the journal article as your\nlast source of information; the journal article is written in such a way that it assumes the\nreader has prior knowledge on the subject matter. So read your encyclopedia first (general\nand summative information), then research your subject in books (dedicated material), and\nfinally in journal articles (comprehensive and scholarly).\nIn any case, you should steer yourself away from the mainstream media for your information.\nStick with the scholarly print sources.\n166 Natural Sciences\n31.3 Natural Sciences\nWriting in the natural sciences means writing about the natural aspects of our world.\nTheories are tested in order to solve problems. The natural sciences paper is used to evaluate\nand conclude from this testing.\nWriting in this discipline is a detailed, tedious process. Specific steps must be taken to\nensure you have gathered accurate data. Once you have gathered enough data, you must\norganize it into a coherent flow of ideas, ending with your evaluation or conclusion. One of\nthe critical parts of the natural sciences paper is the presentation. You have your data, you\nhave organized it, so now it is time to present it in a factual, knowledgeable way.\nNatural Sciences can be broken down into 2 categories; pure sciences and applied sci-\nences.\nPure Sciences include the life sciences, physical sciences, and earth sciences. Life sciences\nfocuses on how plants, animals, and organisms (living things) relate to each other and how\nthey interact with their surroundings. Biology is one area of the life sciences. Others include\necology, molecular biology and genetics, and food sciences.\nTo write about the physical sciences is to write about matter (anything that occupies space)\nand energy (what causes matter to move), not living things. There are many topics in the\nfield of physical science. The list includes aerodynamics, thermodynamics, chemistry, and\neven astronomy.\nEarth science, quite simply, is the study of the earth and its history. There are four main\nareas of earth science: geology (the study of the structure of the earth and how it formed),\nmeteorology (the study of weather), oceanography (the study of the ocean and the creatures\nliving in it), and space science (the study of the planets, stars, and everything else out\nthere). Possible earth science topics may include volcanoes, tornadoes, the study of rocks,\nour atmosphere, earth minerals, or the solar system.\nApplied Sciences include medical sciences (i.e. forensics, pharmaceuticals), engineering\nsciences (i.e. electrical\/mechanical engineering) and computer science.\n31.3.1 Elements of the Natural Sciences Paper\nKeep in mind that when writing in the sciences, fact is preferred over flair. Write about\nthe facts - the experiment outcomes, the process of information gathering, or a succinct\nhypothesis. Focus on the \"what\" and keep away from describing the \"what.\"\nIt is good pedagogic practice to require student write ups to be near in style to what would\nbe expected in a published paper. There is a tradition in science of using a neutral tone, the\nthird person and the passive voice, and some institutions may require this style for high\nmarks. It can however lead to rather stilted writing and other institutions encourage the\nuse of the 1st person in write ups. It is necessary to be aware of the requirements of the\ncourse, the potential audience of the article and perhaps even the personality of the marker.\nThere are seven steps to writing in the Natural Sciences:\n1. The problem being addressed must be stated in an objective fashion.\n167 Writing in the Sciences\n2. Unbiased relevant information must be gathered.\n3. The information gathered must be analyzed.\n4. A hypothesis is formulated.\n5. Experimentation (the fun stuff) to prove your hypothesis. Remember that keeping a\njournal of experiment outcomes is important for your final steps, so be detailed.\n6. Analyze your journal notes.\n7. Arrive at your conclusion, which may or may not prove your original hypothesis.\nWhen it comes down to actually writing your paper, be sure to include the following\nelements:\nTitle\nThe title of the natural sciences paper is very important. It should be concise and clearly\ndescribe what your paper is about. You may choose to introduce what you tested. For\nexample:\n\"Synthesis of 2-phenyl-2-butanol via a Grignard Reaction\"\nSample title for a natural sciences paper\nThis title describes the molecule of interest and the reaction of interest, making it easy for\nthe reader to determine if this paper is one they would want to read.\nAbstract\nThis is a brief description of your paper. Take the main ideas and summarize them in 250\nwords or less. For example, this is an abstract for a paper written in the organic chemistry\nfield.\n\"This experiment synthesized 2-phenyl-2-butanol using a Grignard reagent under reflux\nconditions. Learning to utilize Grignard reagents is an important skill for any future chemist.\nAfter performing the experiment, it has been concluded that there was a moderate to poor\nyield of 2-phenyl-2-butanol produced. Unwanted oxidization of Magnesium metal during the\nformation of the Grignard reagent is a possible explanation. However, the characterization of\nthe product using IR spectroscopy and 1H NMR spectroscopy has reinforced the production\nof a pure product.\"\nAbstract containing 80 words\nThere is little to no explanation of the details of the experiment or results. If the reader is\ninterested in this synthesis, they now know that this experiment showed a poor but pure\nyield, and used both IR and NMR spectroscopy to analyze the product. This is important\nin scientific writing because of the massive amounts of information available to a researcher.\nThe nature of modern computer searches has meant that the abstract of a published paper\nis of paramount importance. There may be a hundred people reading the abstract for every\nsingle one who actually ever reads the full paper. Anything useful which the paper contains\ntherefore must be mentioned in these 250 words. Abstracts help research scientists to\nweed through papers to find information pertinent to their specific interest.\nIntroduction\nThe paper should begin by introducing and forming a question in the introduction. The\nintroduction should include relevant theories and equations used in your experiment. If\n168 Natural Sciences\nother scientists have conducted similar experiments, give recognition to these predecessors\nof your work. Any hypotheses you have formed should be stated here. A brief description of\nthe experiments conducted should be outlined in the introduction also, saving the intimate\ndetails of the experiments for the body of the paper.\n\"The reaction itself was developed by Victor Grignard of France in the late 1800s. His\npreparation of magnesium alkyl halides (now referred to as Grignard reagents) was first\npresented to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences in France on May 11, 1900. (Nobel Prize.org) The\nreaction uses Magnesium metal to create an electron rich carbon atom from an alkyl or aryl\nhalide. This is the Grignard reagent. The electron rich carbon atom becomes a nucleophile,\nattacking any other molecule that is electron poor. If placed in solution with a molecule\ncontaining a ketone, the Grignard reagent will attack the ketone carbon, creating a new\ncarbon-carbon bond connected to a negatively charged oxygen atom. That oxygen is then\neasily turned into an alcohol using any weak acid. ...\nSample Introduction Text\nThis introduction goes into detail regarding the synthesis used and what is synthesized in\nthe experiment. This provides ample background information for the reader who may not\nbe an expert in the experiment performed.\nThesis Statement\nThe thesis statement of a scientific paper is a clear and concise statement of your topic of\nstudy. This could be included in your introduction.\n\"The compound synthesized in this reaction, 2-phenyl-2-butanol, is a chiral molecule.\"\nThesis statement for sample paper\nThis thesis statement clearly defines what is being accomplished (or trying to be accom-\nplished) through this experiment. Notice that this particular example does not include a\nhypothesis. For a synthesis-type experiment, there may not be any predictions to be made.\nNot all scientific papers need to include a hypothesis.\nBody\nSince the goal of the scientific paper is to present facts supported by evidence, there are\ngeneral rules to follow in the paper. Avoid adjectives and adverbs (being descriptive), and\ninstead focus on the nouns (the focus of the paper) and the verbs (how it acted).\nStructure your sentences so that they are clear and easy to understand. Keep your audience\nin mind when using technical jargon. Limit yourself to words and jargon that your audience\nshould be familiar with. Overuse of unfamiliar jargon will not make you sound smarter, it\nwill only thoroughly confuse your readers.\nThe body of the paper will include the following\nExperimental\nThis section contains all of the reagents you used in your experiment, most likely\naccompanied by any hazard warnings they might carry. If a colleague wants to reproduce\nyourexperiment,theyneedtoknowwhattheyaregettingthemselvesinto. Alsodescribed\n169 Writing in the Sciences\nhere should be all of the equipment used in your data collection process, including specific\nequipment names and numbers.\nProcedure\nThis section contains the steps taken during your experiment. If you used a procedure\npreviously recorded elsewhere, feel free to simply reference that procedure to save time\nand precious space for data. If you are using a self-written procedure, you need to\nmeticulously write every step down so that your experiment could be repeated in exactly\nthe same way by a different team of scientists.\nResults\nHere you would record all of the numerical data you generated during your experiment.\nRefrain from drawing conclusions. Simply enter tables, graphs, and numbers that are\npertinent to your conclusions.\nConclusion\nIn your conclusion, you should focus on the data you presented. Share and discuss your\nresults. Here you are allowed to give your opinion on what the results mean. Although you\naregiventhefreedomtointerpretyourdatahowyouseefit, avoidlinkingyourfindingswith\nother, unexplored subject matter. If you didn't cover it in your introduction or experiment,\nleave it out of the conclusion!\nAcknowledgments\nSometimes, but often not, you will need to put this section in. Examples are if you have\nused a service to run spectra or analysis for you, or someone has given you help by lending\nsome part of their apparatus made for a different experiment. Acknowledgment sections\nare very appropriate and recommended for academic writing, as all equipment utilized\nusually belongs to the university. Some scientific service providers require a specific form\nof words in the acknowledgment as part of their regulations. These will be provided along\nwith the results of your submitted sample.\nReferences Cited Page\nFollow the specific documentation style chosen or required. If citing, for example, a huge\nreference book of analytical and preparatory chemistry, give the page or chapter number so\nthe reader stands a chance of finding the text you used. It is a good idea to make sure you\ncite any important references already cited for you in the laboratory instructions and add\nsome more to show that you have looked further than just reading your assignment brief.\nAppendix\nThis section is reserved for boring calculations and notes that you made during the actual\nexperimentation process. No one really wants to see your hand written notes, but you are\nstill required to present them to prove that you did observe what you claim in your paper.\nThis section, therefore, usually contains a photocopy of the laboratory notebook page, or\npages, that contain data and comments relevant to your paper.\n170 Natural Sciences\n31.3.2 Resources to Use\nSeeing as writing in the natural sciences is technical in nature, you will find that your\nresources are going to have to be scholarly, comprehensive, and up-to-date (the only time\nyou should use a reference that is several years old is to do comparisons). The first step is to\neducate yourself on your topic by locating information through a simple search. Information\nand data can be compiled by doing a search and writing down the information you find to\nfamiliarize yourself with the subject. When you feel comfortable with the level of knowledge\nof this information, you can move on to the next step in the research process.\nThat next step is finding encyclopedias, textbooks, reference books, and the like to continue\nfilling in the details on your topic. These resources will be dedicated to the chosen topic.\nThey will provide more detailed information and help you fill in any holes in your research\nor to simply answer questions that may have popped up during the information gathering\nstage. A good way to find if there are newer articles than your favorite reference is to use\nthe citing references feature of many search systems. These might well give you a link to a\nmore comprehensive and up to date reference.\nFinally, you will turn to review articles, lab reports, and research reports to get the most\nup-to-date information. This is the most important resource you will use, and the most\nchallenging. These articles and reports provide information that reveal the most recent\ndiscoveries on the chosen topic. However, they also tend to be technical in nature and are\nwritten in a way that assumes the reader is familiar with technical jargon associated with\nthe field or subject. While keeping this in mind, review articles and research reports will\nround out your resource selection nicely.\nDon't be afraid to search the Internet for information. There is a great deal of good stuff out\nthere, but you should be careful in what you use. Be sure to gather any Internet information\nfrom a scholarly source, such as an educational site or a non-profit site. Use the Internet as\na secondary or even better a tertiary source and preferably cite a review article or a journal\nof record. The citing of either the Internet or encyclopedias is sometimes expressly forbidden\nso you need to check on institutional policy here. (Despite this some book series, though\nthey have encyclopedia in the title, such as Wiley's The Encyclopedia of Nuclear Magnetic\nResonance are actually review journals and are eminently citable.) Internet articles change\nand so a citation should include the date accessed, for example:\nEDEXCEL http:\/\/www.edexcel.org.uk\/Qualifications [accessed 27th October 2004].\nExample citation for internet article. Note that the date accessed has been included.\n31.3.3 Acronyms and Abbreviations\nScience abounds in acronyms and abbreviations, which can be very irritating if you are\nnot in the know. Even common ones like IR for infrared spectroscopy or MRI (Magnetic\nResonance Imaging) should be named in full followed by the abbreviation the first time they\nare mentioned and then the abbreviation used from then on.\n171 Writing in the Sciences\n...the first sessions on Computer Aided Design (CAD) come in the General Computing\nLaboratory in year 1 (GCLy1).

This\nsection will focus on how to be a successful business writer.\n32.1 Purpose of Business Writing\nThe main purpose of business writing is to convince. For example, as a professional business\nwriter, you often find yourself explaining the value of a complex idea in order to obtain\nagreement among readers. Or, you find yourself crafting a document intended to persuade\npeople and rouse them to action.\nIn other respects, business writing is much like any other form of writing that includes\npre-writing or brainstorming, writing and revising. The most important aspects of business\nwriting are clear and concise writing and getting the message across in the best way. As\nwith all writing, it is important to keep the audience in mind when coming up with the best\nformat to get the message across.\n32.2 Audience\nThe most important concept to keep in mind when writing for business is who your target\naudienceis. Youneedtotailoryourwritingtofitdifferentaudiencesindifferentsituations. If\nyou address the document's specific target audience in terms it understands, your document\nwill have a better chance of achieving its goal.\nEvery business document has a purpose. You could be trying to persuade your boss that\nyou are due a raise in one instance, and trying to persuade the HR Department that the\ncompany picnic would have more participation if it were held at a lake in another instance.\nIn both instances, the language and way you would approach each is going to differ.\n32.3 Deadlines\nMuch, if not all, professional business writing is performed against a deadline. In fact,\nmaking a deadline with time to spare is the hallmark of a pro. That act alone inspires a\nsense of confidence in a business that is often as persuasive as the document itself. So, a\ngood rule of thumb for business writers would be 'better a B+ document that arrives on\ntime than an A that's late.'\n173 Writing in Business\n32.4 Memos and E-mails\nWriting memos and e-mails in a business setting is slightly different than writing to a friend\nor family member. The biggest difference is that in a business setting, the writing must be\nprofessional or formal. A big misconception about e-mailing in business is that formality is\nnot important. Grammar and composition are both important aspects. However, should you\nreceive an email of memo which contains compositional and grammatical flaws, it may be\nrude or unwise to point these out to the author. Memos and e-mails have a similar approach.\nThe purpose of both is to get a certain message across. This section will cover deciding\nwhen it is appropriate to use either a memo or e-mail, content, pre-writing techniques, and\neffectiveness.\n32.4.1 Memos\nThe memo or memorandum has a few types. The memos can be short notes, reports, plans\nor proposals. The standard memo is most effective when attempting to inform many people\nwithin the same organization of upcoming events, changes, thoughts, or ideas.\nMost memos will have five basic elements:\n\u2022 The organization's logo or letterhead\n\u2022 The \"to\" line\n\u2022 The \"from\" line\n\u2022 The subject line\nNote: When writing your subject line, make sure it is called something accurate, unique\nand specific. Name your memo something informative.\n\u2022 The date line\nThe first sentence of your memo you should clearly state your purpose. Be concise and\ndirect.\nExample: An example from \"How to write it?

Room\n108\nAgenda:\n1.Vote on the vacation policy.\n2.Elect a media spokesperson.\n3.Introduce the new vice president of marketing, Mark Halpern.\nExample: The purpose of this memo is to request authorization to travel to Minneapolis\nto visit the Museum of Natural History to learn more about dinosaur fossils.\nUse headings throughout your memo to help the reader decide what they want to read and\nunderstand the information they are being presented. Headings can also help the reader\nunderstand the purpose of the section (i.e. summary).\n174 Cover Letters and Resumes\nIf your memo has a lot of information or if it is really long, you may consider summarizing\nthe memo. This can help readers understand the body of the memo, allow readers to skip\ninformation that is not relevant to them or to remind the reader of the memos main points.\nA good memo will record the clear main ideas and every important decision.\nKeep in mind your audience when writing your memo. You may need to provide background\ninformation or explain the events that led to the situation to which the memo is regarding.\n32.4.2 E-mails\nEmails are fast, cheap, easy to use and digital. Because of its widespread use, here are some\nthings to keep in mind when writing \"business\" emails.\n\u2022 Use an appropriate level of formality.\n\u2022 Keep messages brief. If you are replying to an email, don't repeat information from the\nemail, instead establish a general context of the email. Also, if sending the email to\nmore than one person, you may want to consider blocking the original author's name for\nprivacy's sake (BCC = Blind Carbon-Copy).\n\u2022 Be careful when writing. Because email is often informal, it is easy for them to become\nsloppy. Make sure you read your email before sending it.\n\u2022 In formal business email, avoid the use of characters to create emotion faces, such as :),\nOrz, or > <.\n\u2022 Use the subject line. All business emails should have a subject so the reader can decide\nquickly whether or not they need to read the email.\n\u2022 Don't use all capital letters or use annoying backgrounds. Keep your emails simple. Try\nto stay away from using italics, bolds or underlining. Even if your email supports these\noptions, others may not.\n\u2022 Don't forward a message without the permission of the author.\n\u2022 Above all, have something to say. Don't send emails just for fun or just to reply agreeing\nwith the writer (unless this is requested or expected). In other words, don't send a\nmessage just to feel like you are part of the conversation.\n\u2022 Remember, if you are writing a memo or email during working hours or on a company\ncomputer, the company OWNS this material (and has the fully legal right to inspect it).\nAvoid overtly personal and\/or sensitive content in your email while at work. If you are\nconcerned about this possibility, look into message encryption.\n32.5 Cover Letters and Resumes\nWriting a resume or a cover letter is basically a sales pitch to a potential employer. You\nneed to acknowledge that they have a need (an empty position), and that you are the perfect\nfit for them or at least close enough of a fit to bring into their office for an interview.\n32.5.1 Cover Letters\nThe cover letter and resume will form employers\u2019 first impressions of a potential employee.\nThese documents will be the first thing the employer sees, therefore, make every attempt to\n175 Writing in Business\nensure the documents are without errors (grammatical, spelling, punctuation, etc.). Mistakes\nin the resume and cover letter are one of the biggest reasons why job seekers fail to secure\nan interview. If the potential employer finds mistakes, they will have the feeling that the\napplicant probably will not take the time to be careful with their work when they are on\nthe job.\nThe cover letter is an opportunity to expand on any specific points in the resume that\ndeserve more attention and can be connected to aspects of the desired position. Remember,\nthere is likely a large pool of people applying for the same position. Use the cover letter\neffectively to present yourself and distinguish your application from the rest.\nAny time a resume is sent in the mail, it must be accompanied by a cover letter. The\ncover letter is an important factor in getting your resume past the first barrier. The cover\nletter must be customized for each opportunity. It can also be an opportunity to explain\nany problems,questions, and things that may not be clear in your resume (such as gaps in\nemployment).\nWhy is the cover letter so important?\nThe cover letter:\n\u2022 is your opportunity to personalize your resume and target your skills to the specific\nemployer;\n\u2022 connects your past experiences listed on your resume to your potential future position at\na new job;\n\u2022 highlights your strengths, accomplishments, and sparkling personality;\n\u2022 can be tailored to the needs of the specific company to which you are applying.\nCover Letter Formats\nEmployer Invited Letter: Usetheemployerinvitedletterwhenanemployerhasrequested\na resume. This is often in response to a classified ad or publicized listing. This style focuses\non matching your qualifications to the advertised requirements of the position.\nUninvited or Cold Contact Letter: Use the uninvited letter to contact employers who\nhave not advertised or published job openings. The focus is on matching your qualifications\ntotheperceivedneedsoftheemployerbasedonlabormarketresearch. Thisstrategyrequires\nthat a phone or personal contact with the employer either precede or follow the sending of\nthe resume and cover letter.\nReferral Letter: Use the referral letter to contact employers to whom you have been\nreferred. The effective job seeker will receive referrals to many job opportunities through\nnetworking and informational interviews. The referral may be to a specific job opening\n(advertised or unadvertised) or to an employer who may not be hiring. In a referral letter\nthe individual who provided the referral is mentioned in the letter.\nSpecific points to address in the cover letter.\n\u2022 Let the company know why you are contacting them. Your intent may seem obvious, but\ntell the employer you are interested in a job at their company. Opening a letter without\nstating you intent may seem awkward. Whenever possible address the cover letter to a\nspecific person by name and title.\n176 Cover Letters and Resumes\n\u2022 Let the employer know how you heard about the open position. For example, \"I am inter-\nested in X position. I heard about\/discovered the opening online\/in the newspaper\/from\none of their a current employees. It is likely that the company has more than one open\nposition so make sure to identify the specific position in which you are interested.\n\u2022 Include a detailed description of your educational and work experience. Be sure to\nhighlight the areas in your work or educational history that apply directly or closely\nto your desired position. You can put either paragraph first, but put your strongest\ninformation first. If you have a lot of work experience related to the job, then put your\nwork experience first. If your educational experience makes you more strongly qualified,\nconsider putting that information first. Remember, extra-curricular activities can be very\nvaluable, if they are applicable to the position.\n\u2022 Use terms from the ad that are clearly relevant to you and your experience. Take a cue\nfrom the job ad and emphasize how you are specifically qualified for the position. If the\njob requires a degree in Management and you have a Master's Degree in Management,\nemphasize that point. Writing your cover letter specifically for the job for which you are\napplying, will stand out more than a person who has a generic cover letter. Utilize action\nwords and descriptive statements to convey your qualifications and career objectives.\n\u2022 Reemphasize your interest in the position. Include a polite, but also confident request\nfor an interview. Ask that they contact you and be sure to include how you'd like to be\ncontacted (i.e. give your phone number and\/or your email address.\nYou may also want to state the best time you can be reached. It is also a good idea to\nreference your resume, if you haven't already done so.\n\u2022 Remember, be confident! If you don't sound like you think you are qualified for the\nposition, why should a potential employer? Your cover letter needs to persuade the\nemployer that you have skills and abilities that are useful to the company.\nCover Letter Outline\nInsert Date Here\nMs. Catherine Smith\nHuman Resources Director\nSt. Mary\u2019s Hospital\n123 Southview Drive\nMinneapolis, MN 55555\nDear Ms. Smith,\nFirst Paragraph: Introduction\n1.

Avoid using templates and standardized cover letters\nfrom books or websites.\nIf you are asked to supply additional materials or references, do so promptly.\nDouble check spelling and triple check any names and titles.\n179 Writing in Business\n32.5.2 Resumes\nFigure 15 Hourglass in wooden stand\nUnlike cover letters, resumes are a brief outline used by hiring managers to scan a potential\nemployee. Think of the resume as a \"snapshot\" of your most relevant work and educational\nexperience. Just like your cover letter, you want to bring out aspects of previous positions\nthat relate to the one you are hoping to obtain.\nResumes need to be brief and descriptive at the same time. How are you going to manage\nthat? You will need to be very selective in your word choice. Each resume usually gets under\na one minute chance to make an impression. You should generally be able to get everything\nthat you need to say in one page. Make sure the pertinent information really stands out. If\n180 Cover Letters and Resumes\nyou glance at your resume and can't find what's important right away, someone else will\nhave a hard time finding the information that's important.\nHiring managers expect that your resume be typed or printed, neat, easy to read, clearly\noutlined. Don't use bright colors of ink or paper. Make sure it looks professional.\nThere are several elements to a resume:\n\u2022 Identification - Include your name, address, e-mail, phone number.\n\u2022 Objective - Write a clear goal, avoid generalities. Objectives are not necessary, but they\nare really helpful when applying for a volunteer position, internship or other positions\nthat are a little more vague than a job opportunity. If your objective states you want a\njob, don't include it, but rather specify the particular field of employment.\n\u2022 Employment - Include your skills and responsibilities, with what equipment you worked.\nThe most important thing to include here is what you gained from your employment, the\nresults of your experience. Use an active voice and strong verbs.\n\u2022 Education - Include information about your degree and the institution. Again, make sure\nyou talk about the results of your education, not just that your received an education.\n\u2022 Interests and Activities - Make sure these are relevant to the job and demonstrate the\npersonal impact you made as part of the group or working on a project. Don't just\ninclude random hobbies.\n\u2022 References - There are a variety of opinions about whether or not to include references\non the resume. Most employers are aware that they can request references from the job\napplicant at any point throughout the interview and hiring process. The job application\nitself, also may ask for references and their contact information. It is important to utilize\nthe \"white space\" on your resume most effectively. You can list your references or write\n\"available upon request\". If you choose to list your references on a separate sheet of\npaper, make sure your name is on all sheets in case the pages get separated. To provide\ncontinuity between your cover letter, resume and references list, consider using the same\nheader with your name and contact information on all three documents.\nHow to get started:\n1. Define your objective. What position do you want to be hired for with the resume\nyou will be working on? Resumes should always be customized to reflect the skills related\nto the desired position. A resume for a human resources position should look different than\na resume for a counseling position.\n2. Identify and evaluate your audience. Who in the company will most likely be\nviewing your resume first: a human resources representative, the CEO or the district\nmanager? What skills, qualities and knowledge will your audience look for?\n3. Prioritize your selling points. You have considered who your audience is going to be\nand what they will be looking for, now consider what areas in your work and educational\nexperience best match the desired skills, qualities and knowledge. Brainstorm the key buzz\nwords and action verbs that would best highlight your relevant qualifications.\n181 Writing in Business\n4. Showcase your successes. Every employer wants a winner on their team. Demonstrate\nyoursuccesses(e.g. collegedegrees,educationalhonors,scholarshipwinnings,jobpromotions,\nleadership and community involvement and any other relevant awards\/recognition).\n5. Choose your resume format and layout. What resume format (chronological,\nfunctional or combination) will best showcase your qualifications for the job. How can the\nlayout be designed to best highlight so that the employer will quickly notice your selling\npoints?\n6. Create, Critique and Revise. Nothing good is ever written. It is always rewritten.\nStart the resume writing process as early as possible. Although your resume will always\nbe a work in progress, revising will continually improve the final product. Ask a career\nadvisor, professor, parent or room mates seriously edit your resume. Any typo, spelling and\ngrammatical error or spacing mistake should be improved. Your goal should be to have your\nresume error free.\n7. Ensure the printing looks professional. Typing your resume is an absolute must.\nPrint your resume on a laser printer and use a heavier paper stock.\nQuestionstohelpjogyourmemoryaboutyourcollegeactivitiesforyourresume:\n\u2022Did you win any academic scholarships? What were the winning criteria?\n\u2022Were you on the Dean\u2019s list?\n\u2022Do you have a high GPA?\n\u2022What major (s) and\/or minor (s) did you complete?\n\u2022Worked while a student to help fund your education?\n\u2022Completed an internship?\n\u2022Active in student organizations?

Debate team? Choir? Band?\n\u2022Individual tutoring?\n182 Cover Letters and Resumes\n\u2022Field service\/practicum as part of your major?\nUsing Key Action Verbs\nWhat is an action verb? Action verbs describe achievements or results in a concise and\npersuasive manner.\nThe following job description uses a non-action verb:\nWas the supervisor of ten employees.\nThe next job description uses an action verb:\nSupervised ten employees.\nThe job description using the action verb is more concise (three words shorter). Concise\nwriting is easier for the reader to understand and carries more impact and power.\nUse action verbs as the first word of each bullet point in your resume to emphasize job\ndescriptions in your resume. Examples:\n\u2022Developed and wrote content for the organization\u2019s website\n\u2022Created and coordinated special events generating product awareness and increased sales\n\u2022Evaluated company\u2019s marketing and public relation campaigns\u2019 impact & implementation.\nIt is common for students to be too brief in their description of their skills, qualities and\ntraits. Key action words will help you best describe and sell your skills and abilities.\n1. First read through the entire list below and write down the action verbs (skills) employers\nlook for in your field or particular position.\n2. Next, read through the entire list a second time and write down the action verbs you\nhave used in the experience you are describing on your resume.\n3. Look back at your written list and highlight the words that appear on both lists.\nIncorporate these words into your resume and cover letter.\nAccelerated Corresponded Exhibited Judged Predicted RevampedActivated Counseled Expanded Launched Prepared ReviewedAdapted Created Experienced Lectured Prescribed RevisedAdministered Decided Explained Led Presented ScheduledAnalyzed Delegated Explored Located Presided ServedAnticipated Delivered Facilitated Maintained Processed ServicedAppraised Demonstrated Formulated Managed Produced Set upApproved Designed Fostered Marketed Programmed SimplifiedAssisted Determined Generated Measured Proposed SoldBargained Developed Governed Mediated Protected SolvedBudgeted Diagnosed Handled Moderated Proved SortedBuilt Directed Headed Monitored Provided SpokeCalculated Discovered Implemented Motivated Qualified StreamlinedClassified Displayed Improved Negotiated Read StructuredCoached Distributed Increased Obtained Received StudiedCollected Earned Indexed Operated Recommended SupervisedCompleted Edited Initiated Ordered Recorded SupportedConceived Effected Inspected Organized Recruited SystemizedConducted Eliminated Installed Originated Reduced TaughtConserved Entertained Instituted Oversaw Referred TestedConstructed Established Instructed Participated Reinforced TrainedConsulted Estimated Interpreted Performed Reorganized TranslatedContributed Evaluated Interviewed Persuaded Repaired UpdatedControlled Examined Invented Pioneered Represented WorkedCoordinated Executed Investigated Planned Researched Wrote\nThere are a few different forms of resumes.

time to write a thank you letter. The follow up letter can do\nmore good for you in less time than most other aspects of the application\/interview process.\nThank the interviewer for taking time out of their schedule to meet with you. Also, make\nsure to emphasize your particular qualifications and\/or restate your interest in the position.\nThis letter puts your name in front of the interviewer again and also shows that you are\ntruly interested in the position. Plus, if you are basically tied in contention for the job with\nanother person, the thank you letter may tip the scales in your favor.\nMail the thank you letter within a day of your interview. Not only will this help you\nin remember the details of your interview, it will also help to ensure that your potential\ninterviewer sees your thank you letter before making a final decision about the position.\nWhen to Write Thank You Letters:\nA thank you letter should be written after an interview, when someone provides or sends\nyou information at your request, when a contact was particularly helpful to you, or any\nother contact that you would like to express thanks and develop a good relationship with.\nWriting Your Thank You Letter:\nThe body of your thank you letter is really a \u201csales\u201d letter. It is an opportunity to restate\nwhy you want the job, to reiterate your best qualifications that match the job requirements,\nand how you will make significant contributions to the establishment. A thank you letter is\nalso the perfect opportunity to discuss anything that your interviewer neglected to ask you\nor that you neglected to answer as thoroughly as you could have.\nCustomize Your Thank You Letters:\nIt\u2019s very important to keep your audience in mind when writing your thank you letter.\nTypically your thank you letters are typed but research suggests that managers like hand\nwritten thank you notes also.\nIn addition to thanking the person you talked with, thank you letters also reinforce the fact\nthat you want the job.\nFollow Up Letter to Recap Important Information:\nRemind individuals who attended the meeting of the main events and important dates\nthat were discussed. Remind individuals who attended an important business event of the\ndiscussions that were made. This helps keep the work flowing and everyone on the same\npage. This also promotes further discussion and collaboration.\nFollow-up Letter to announce a special Offer:\nThis type of letter helps improve your relationship with a new customer. Remind the\ncustomer that you are willing to help them by stating the advantages that your company\ncan offer. Thank the customer, or announce the special sale or limited time offer. Remind\nthe customer why you are a good business to work with.\nFollow-up Letter to Remind Readers of Important Events:\n186 Other business letters\nMake sure to include the date, time, location of the event, and any other important\ninformation that the reader needs to have in order to attend the event.\n32.6.1 Thank you letter example\n1234 Spring Drive Anytown, MN 55432\nMay 26, 2005\nNorthern Newspapers, Inc. 5678 Fall Way Othertown, MN 56789\nDear Ms. Hall,\nI would like to express my appreciation for your courtesy in extending to me an interview\nthis Monday for the position of Administrative Assistant with your Editorial Department.\nAs a result of our interview, I am convinced that the position of Administrative Assistant at\nNorthern Newspapers, Inc. is exactly the kind of challenge and opportunity I am seeking. As\nyou may recall, my experience in editorial work at Company B coupled with my Legislative\nAssistant expertise with Company C will be a real benefit to you and the rest of the Editorial\nDepartment at Northern Newspapers, Inc.\nThank you again for your time and consideration. I am looking forward to hearing from\nyou soon. I can be reached at (555)555-5555 for another interview or to answer any more\nquestions you may have for me.\nSincerely,\nJane Doe\nA sample Thank You Letter.\n32.7 Other business letters\nBesides writing a letter to express appreciation for an interview, there are several other\ntypes of follow up letters. Here are some tips for these types of letters.\n\u2022 Letter accepting a job offer - Express appreciation for the offer. Show enthusiasm for the\nposition. Repeat the major terms of your employment such as start date, job title, or\nsalary.\n\u2022 Letter of rejection in response to a job offer - Again, express your appreciation for the\noffer. If it's appropriate, explain your reason for declining the offer. Remember, at some\npoint in the future, you may want to work for this company, so be polite with your\nrejection.\n\u2022 Letter acknowledging a rejection - Why bother? This letter maintains good relations with\nthe company. You might get a phone call later on saying that the first choice candidate\nwasn't able to take the position.\n32.8 Proposals, Business Plans and Formal Reports\nProposals, business plans and formal reports can be a critical part of your business career.\nAll of these may deal with important outcomes. The goal of all of these is to persuade the\n187 Writing in Business\nreaders into agreeing with your ideas. Often times, you are trying to gain something from\nthe readers, such as money, equipment or help.\n32.8.1 Considerations\nWhen starting a proposal, the first thing to consider is what your goals are. If you are\nasked to write a proposal for someone, make sure you are clear on what their goals and\nrequirements are.\nThere are four main elements that must be considered with your goals.\n1. What are the immediate goals and how do they relate to the long-term goals?\n2. What costs or risks are involved with writing the proposal? This includes time and\npeople needed. Do not forget to explore hidden cost opportunities.\n3. What kinds of resources are you going to need? Are those resources readily available?\n4. What will come from an unsuccessful proposal? Will it be helpful if only some goals\nare met?\nAfter considering your goals, there are still many more things to think about. You must\ntake into consideration the readers, your argument, feasibility, and action.\n32.8.2 Readers\nThe more you know about your readers, the more you can tailor your report to appeal to\nthem. If you are lucky, you already know a lot about the reader because they wanted you\nto write the proposal and have given you specific guidelines. However if you do not know\nmuch about your readers, then you better do some research on them. It is important to\nknow what form of research they will be the most receptive to. Surveys may satisfy one\nreader, while another reader may not find them to be as credible.\nArgument\nAn argument can be summed up as what the main issue is and the importance of that\nissue. You need to prove to your readers the significance of the issue. You must convince\nyour readers that your issue needs their attention or help. You need to inform them of the\nissue, tell them why they should care, what they can do to help, the benefits of their help,\nand why they should find you credible.\nFeasibility\nIn your report, often as part of your argument, you will have to convince the readers of the\nfeasibility of the issue. Included in this would be offering alternative plans, addressing the\ncosts and risks involved, as well as the resources needed. You should be able to identify\nwhy your plan is the best option.\nAction\nYou will also need to include a plan of action in your report. Most proposals are asking\nthe readers for something. You will need to tell the readers exactly what it is that you\nwant them to do.\n188 Proposals, Business Plans and Formal Reports\n32.8.3 What is included in a proposal?\nCover, cover letter, table of contents, executive summary, appendix, and graphics.\nCover\nThe cover page should include the title of the proposal, who the proposal is for, who the\nproposal is by, and the date.\nCover letter\nThe cover letter is used to introduce the formal report. It is often less formal than the\nreport itself. The letter usually includes an introduction of the topic and how it was\nauthorized, a brief description of the plan, highlights of the report's findings, conclusions,\nand recommendations.\nTable of contents\nThe table of contents is just as it sounds, a table of the proposal's content and page\nnumbers. In the table of contents you should include section headings\/topics and the page\nthey can be found on. Be sure to include leaders (numbers, dots or bullet-points) to link\nthe section with the corresponding page number.\nExecutive summary\nThe executive summary is a brief overview of the proposal. You should summarize your\nmain points, you should begin with your purpose and follow the order of your proposal.\nMake sure to avoid including non essential information. The executive summary should\nnot be longer than 10 percent of the length of the proposal. With proposals that are 10\npages or less, it may not be necessary to include an executive summary.\nAppendix\nAn appendix is pretty much any supporting material that you either reference in your\nproposal or may be supporting sources that be relevant to some readers and not others.\nYou may choose to include survey forms, other reports, tables of data, or any related\nmaterial. They are named Appendix A, B, C, etc.\nGraphics\nWhile graphics are not a must, they are greatly appreciated. Graphics help to break up all\nof the text in order to give the reader's eyes a little break. You may choose to include a\nfew small charts or graphs in your reports also. Just be sure that the graphics are relevant\nto the proposal.\n32.8.4 Some tips to consider while writing your proposal...\n1. Be clear on your topic. Do not try to cover too many aspects in one proposal. Stick\nto the most important so that you can be clear and concise.\n2. Create a phrase that will draw in your readers. Pick an aspect of your report that\nshould interest you readers and mention it early on to gain their interest.\n3. Make sure to include any background information that may be necessary in order to\nunderstand the proposal.\n189 Writing in Business\n4. Give yourself enough time to finish the proposal to the best of your ability. You do\nnot want to be in a time crunch while writing such an important document.\n5. You should not start writing until all of your research has been conducted and you\nhave reached all of your conclusions.\n6. All basic writing standards apply... you should revise and edit, be consistent with verb\ntense, and avoid using \"I\" or \"we\" because you want the proposal to be objective and\ncredible.\n32.9 External Links\n\u2022 Business Writing Introduction1\n\u2022 Bull's Eye Business Writing Tips2\n\u2022 Cover Letters3\n\u2022 Guide to Basic Business Letters4\n\u2022 Business Letter Formats5\n\u2022 10 Secrets of Business Letters6\n\u2022 Letter Writing Rules7\n\u2022 Resumes8\n\u2022 Writing a CV Resume9\n\u2022 Writing Memos10\n\u2022 Business Report Writing11\n\u2022 Tips for Writing a Business Proposal12\n\u2022 http:\/\/www.brightexpress.com\/follow-up-letters.html\n\u2022 http:\/\/www.career.vt.edu\/jobsearc\/thankyou.htm#when\n1 http:\/\/faculty.millikin.edu\/~moconner.hum.faculty.mu\/e201\/index1.html\n2 http:\/\/www.basic-learning.com\/wbwt\/tips-index.htm\n3 http:\/\/www.wisc.edu\/writing\/Handbook\/CoverLetters.html\n4 http:\/\/esl.about.com\/cs\/onthejobenglish\/a\/a_basbletter.htm\n5 http:\/\/www.wisc.edu\/writing\/Handbook\/BusinessLetter.html\n6 http:\/\/www.asu.edu\/duas\/wcenter\/business.html\n7 http:\/\/englishplus.com\/grammar\/letrcont.htm\n8 http:\/\/www.rpi.edu\/web\/writingcenter\/resume.html\n9 http:\/\/www.soon.org.uk\/cvpage.htm\n10 http:\/\/www.rpi.edu\/web\/writingcenter\/memos.html\n11 http:\/\/business.clayton.edu\/arjomand\/business\/writing.html\n12 http:\/\/www.4hb.com\/0350tipwritebizproposal.html\n190 33 Oral Presentations\nOral presentations use many of the same techniques that are used in rhetorical writing.\nPlanning your topic, researching, editing, reviewing, and revision are all important steps in\nproducing a good oral presentation; the same as they are when writing an essay or research\npaper.\nThe best way to ensure that your speech is a success is to have enthusiasm for your topic\nand to give yourself adequate time to develop that enthusiasm into a workable talk.\n33.1 Introduction\nOnce your topic has been decided upon and research is underway, it's time to think about\nhow you plan to present your information.\n33.1.1 Preparation\nOf the several angles that need to be addressed in regards to delivering a speech, the\nmost important thing to keep in mind is, \"Who is my audience?\" Never underestimate the\nimportance of knowing your audience.\nIf you're planning to present information about new advances in interactive role-playing\ngames on the Internet to a group of senior citizens, chances are you will need to use different\nterminology and examples than you would with a college-age audience composed of aspiring\nSoftware Engineers. If your audience can't understand what you're trying to say, you'll find\nit much harder to accomplish your objective.\nConsider the following characteristics of your audience:\n\u2022 Knowledge Base\n\u2022 Age\n\u2022 Race\n\u2022 Gender\n\u2022 Occupation\n\u2022 Values & Morals\nWho is Your Audience?\nThis brings us to consideration number two: what is the purpose of your speech? Is it a\ncall to action? Strictly to inform? To persuade? Just as you will adjust your language for\nvarious audiences, so will you use different rhetorical strategies to achieve different goals.\n191 Oral Presentations\nIntandemwithkeepingyourinformationaudience-appropriateandontopic, yourdecisionto\nuse visual aids such as Powerpoint, charts, or any kind of props (in the case of demonstration\npresentations) will have a sizable impact on your audience, and as such should be given\ncareful thought.\nA question that you may want to ask yourself is, \"How do I want to present the information?\"\nYou might want to give a bare-bones speech, have a Powerpoint presentation, or use exhibits\nto add character to your information. You also may ask, \"How much information can\nI present in the allotted amount of time?\" Sometimes starting a speech with something\neveryone can relate to helps to ease in the audience and make them more interested in what\nyou will be discussing. Be sure to \"trim the fat\" off of your presentation if you are strapped\nfor time. If you are running far over the amount of time that you have been allotted, you\nmay need to re-assess your information and further narrow your scope. One of the most\nimportant things you should ask yourself is, \"What ideas and thoughts do I want to leave\nthe audience with?\" These are the key points that you want to center your presentation\naround.\nKnowing your audience gives you the key to gain and hold their attention, which is a central\ntask for any presenter. Use your knowledge of the audience's demographics to draw them\ninto the presentation from the very first sentence. By knowing what sorts of examples and\nillustrations you can use to make the contents of your presentation relevant and interesting,\nyou have unlocked the door to understanding and persuasion.\n33.1.2 Ways of Beginning a Speech\nWhen you begin your presentation, you want the audience to feel interested and invested\nin what you have to share. The more interested you get them right off the bat, the more\nthey are going to pay attention throughout the rest of the presentation. This can be done in\na multitude of ways, but it is important to remember to keep your introduction relatively\nshort; wordy introductions can lose your audience before you actually get to the speech\nitself. It is also important to remember that whatever opening line you choose, you must\nconnect it to the content of your speech.\nThe use of quotations is a tried-and-true way of introducing a subject--if it is done correctly.\nHere is an example using Albert Einstein:\n\"After the nuclear bombs were dropped during World War II, the leading creator of this\ndestructive force said, 'I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but\nWorld War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.' Albert Einstein stated this after finally\nseeing the bombs' full power; for he knew that he very well may have had a hand in the end\nof the world.\"\nOpening with a quotation.\nStartling statistics might help to open the eyes of your audience. Here is an example\nconcerning incarceration rates:\n\"By the end of 2004, 724 out of every 100,000 U.S. residents were incarcerated. The United\nStates of America has the highest jailing rate in the entire world.\"\n192 Methods of Presenting Your Speech\nOpening with a statistic.\nSharing a personal experience is an effective, but risky way of opening an oral presentation.\nUse this option only if it's the right fit for your audience. For example, if you are presenting\nto a group of Video Game Design students at your school on the topic of fun game play\nelements, you might use a personal experience like this:\n\"A couple years ago, there was this game that had just came out. Everybody was talking\nabout how awesome this game was and how sweet the graphics were. So, I did what any\ngamer would do--drove directly to the store, picked up a copy of the game, brought it home,\nand popped it into my Xbox. My excitement heightened as the game loaded and the intro\nsequence played. When the game started, I was absolutely astonished ... at how bad the\ngame play was. The game looked cool, but all you did was run around and hit the enemies\nin the head with a sword over and over again.\nThat game was not fun; Let's make a game that is fun.\"\nOpening with a personal anecdote.\nUsing a joke to start a presentation is often a good idea. You just better hope that your\naudience thinks it's funny! In most cases, this means keep your joke clean. Also, try to\nmake the joke pertain to the subject you are presenting on. Here is an example that you\nmight use when doing a presentation on football:\n\"Anyone who makes a bad call against the Detroit Lions risks ticking off their last remaining\nfan.\"\nOpening with humor.\nIf the presentation is more formal, you may just want to give an overview of the main topics\nyou will cover in your speech. Here is an example using college dropouts:\n\"Today, I will be discussing college dropouts. I will be going over the current rate of dropouts\nas well as the many common reasons for it. I will also talk about the reasons to stay in\ncollege, like better knowledge, life experiences, and more pay in the future.\"\nOpening with an overview.\n33.2 Methods of Presenting Your Speech\nWhen it comes time to present your speech, there are several methods of delivery to choose\nfrom. In most cases, your subject matter will be the main criteria for deciding whether to\nread verbatim, memorize your script, or work from cue cards. In the case of a scholarly\npresentation with an extensive amount of detail, you may choose to write out your speech\nand deliver it as written. If your goal is to persuade your audience through high-energy\nspeaking and eloquent prose, you may choose to script and memorize your argument. When\nintroducing an informal topic with which you are familiar, you may find that index cards\n193 Oral Presentations\nand an outline will suffice. No matter which way you choose to present your speech, you\nneed to be prepared!\nWritten preparation can include notecards or a fully spelled-out speech. In any case, it is\nessential that as a speaker, you provide clear talking points and transitions for your audience.\nWhen you write an essay, your audience or readers have the advantage of clearly seeing your\nparagraph, section, and page breaks; when you speak to an audience, you must recreate\nthis experience verbally. To provide a recent example, President Barack Obama is known\nfor numbering his extemporaneous responses to questions from the press or during election\ndebates. When outlining a proposed solution, he will clearly mark its steps with one, two,\nand three. This rhetorical strategy is effective in helping his audience easily follow his logic\nand responses; though you can opt to use transitions that are somewhat more subtle, never\nforget that your audience cannot see the progression of your argument and you must visually\noutline it for them.\n33.2.1 Manuscript Speaking\nWriting the content of your speech out word for word may be appropriate for certain\nsituations. For instance, when you are presenting critical facts or statistics, having the data\nat your fingertips helps to prevent errors. While misquoting information might sound like a\nminor offense, under certain circumstances it can have grave repercussions, such as being\nsued for slander. Though in most cases incorrect information will only confuse your listeners\nand embarrass you, it's good to remember that such mistakes won't be tolerated in many\nprofessions, including law and politics.\nThe drawback to a scripted speech is that the audience will almost certainly know that you\nare reading word for word. This has several drawbacks, including decreased eye contact and\nstilted delivery, both of which leech power away from your presentation and tend to create a\nfeeling of disconnect between the listeners and the speaker.\nIfgivingamanuscriptspeechisnecessary,practiceisthebestwaytoavoidabadpresentation.\nBy reading your speech aloud several times, you will become more comfortable with the\nrhythm and inflections of your writing. Make sure that you are thinking about where and\nwhen you can make eye contact with your audience to underscore your points and add\nemphasis to important parts of your speech. Particularly with a written speech, you can\nadd visual cues to your speech to remind you when to look up or emphasize a certain point.\n33.2.2 Memorized Speaking\nWhen a presenter memorizes a speech, it's basically a manuscript speech minus the paper.\nMemorizing a speech can improve eye contact with an audience. Body language may also\nimprove because the speaker has more freedom to move about the area, since papers\/notes\nwill not be used.\nA problem posed by memorizing a speech arises when the presenter forgets the speech. This\ncan cause an embarrassing, awkward situation and make the speaker appear inept. Plus,\nthe speaker's tone tends to sound artificial and rehearsed.\n194 Do's and Don'ts\nIf you choose to memorize a speech, you might want to have a sparse outline with you just\nto remind yourself of your talking points.\n33.2.3 Extemporaneous Speaking\nAn extemporaneous speech (extemp speech) is delivered from a prepared outline or note\ncards. The outline and\/or note cards include the main ideas and arguments of the speech.\nThe only information that is typically copied word for word are quotes. Outlines and note\ncards should be used for keeping the presentation organized and for reminding the presenter\nwhat information needs to be provided.\nExtemp speaking has many advantages compared to the other methods of delivery.\nFor one, an extemporaneous speech sounds spontaneous because the presenter is not reading\nword for word. Glancing at an outline or a note card that has key ideas listed allows the\npresenter to add detail and personality to the information being presented.\nSecond, similar to memorized speaking, eye contact and body language can increase. The\nspeaker\u2019s head is not down, buried in a manuscript.\nThird, the speaker is able to take in audience feedback and respond to it as it occurs. An\naudience tends to change moment by moment, and a good speaker can tell when more or\nless detail is needed for different parts of the presentation.\nInordertoensureanextemporaneousspeech\u2019sstrength,itisimportanttopracticepresenting\nwith the outline or note cards being used. Inexperienced speakers tend to worry that they\nwill forget important information if they do not write it out on their outline\/note card.\nPracticing your speech, even if it's just to your pet or mirror, will help increase your\nconfidence level in both delivery and knowledge of the subject.\nMinnesota Twins History Note card #1\nI.

You may\nbe familiar with Marshall McLuhan's adage \"the medium is the message.\" Don't forget that\nin the case of an oral presentation, you ARE the medium. In other words, no matter how\n195 Oral Presentations\nwell-researched and cunningly written, your speech will only be as professional as your look\nand manner suggest it is. Your appearance and delivery are just as important as the content\nof your presentation.\n33.3.1 Dress Code\nYou've no doubt heard this from your high school guidance counselor, your parents, and\na dozen brochures about successfully interviewing for employment, but it bears repeating:\nFirst impressions are important. It is imperative that you dress to impress. For most\nsituations in which you will be delivering an oral presentation, this means \"Business Casual.\"\nFor men, business casual usually consists of a button-front shirt, tie, dress slacks, and dress\nshoes (blazer is optional). Men should also be clean-shaven or else properly groom their\nfacialhair. Forwomen, businesscasualincludesabutton-frontshirt(orprofessional-looking\nsweater or top- on this point, women tend to have more business casual options than men),\ndress pants or skirt (of appropriate length), and dress shoes. Both men and women should\ntake care not to expose too much skin.\nIf the speech will be presented before an audience that will be dressed formally, wear a suit.\nYou should try to get plenty of sleep the night before your presentation, so that you will be\nfresh and well rested. Before approaching the podium, take a quick look in the mirror--Hair\ntidy? Teeth clean? Tie straight? Under no circumstances should hats or anything that\nobstructs eye contact with the audience be worn.\nAs with other elements of public speaking, consider what your particular audience will\nexpect of you. In some cases, dressing casually is entirely appropriate; in others, only a suit\n(for women and men) is acceptable.\n33.3.2 Delivering The Message\nWhen speaking to the audience, act poised and confident, even if that's not how you feel on\nthe inside. Some of the most common \"tells\" that a person is ill at ease include fidgeting,\nthroat clearing, and speaking too rapidly. Stand up straight and stay relatively still--don't\nshift your weight from foot to foot. Keep your hands quiet, and avoid putting them in your\npockets. Also, try to prevent yourself from adjusting your shirt or glasses or from playing\nwith your notecards, hair, or writing utensils. Concentrate on keeping your breathing slow\nand even, and try to relax. Most importantly, make eye contact with the audience, not\nthe floor. You should be as confident in your vocal delivery as you are in your posture.\nAvoid saying \"Um\", \"Uh\", or \"Like\". These words make you seem uncertain, unprepared, and\nundermine your credibility. Vary the tone of your voice and talk at a steady, conversational\nrate. Last, but not least, do not chew gum or suck on candy while speaking. If you're afraid\nthat your mouth will go dry, it is acceptable to have a small glass of water at hand to sip\ndiscreetly.\nAgain, the most important preparation you can do is to practice your speech several times\nto a mirror, your pet, a friend, or family member. The more comfortable you feel with your\nmaterial, the more confident you will be when presenting it to an audience.\n196 Conclusion\n33.4 Conclusion\nFigure 16 \"WOW\" your audience!\nLeaving the audience with a bang is necessary in order to ensure a lasting impression.\nRemember, the last thing presented tends to be what the audience remembers the best. The\nending of a speech can be as important as the beginning and body. The conclusion should\ndo what the introduction did, except in reverse.\n197 Oral Presentations\n33.4.1 Ways of Ending a Speech\nAfter completing the presentation, the presenter should summarize the main points again\nwithout repeating verbatim what was said in the introduction. After that, you want to\n\"Wow\" your audience again with one of the techniques for introducing your speech. This\ncan include: a quotation, a startling statistic, a personal experience, a joke, or a formal\nclosure. Particularly if you are presenting persuasive information, you may want to end\nyour speech with a call to action. What are you asking of your audience? What can they do\nafter listening to your speech? Finally, asking for questions is a good way to minimize any\nconfusion that the audience might have or bring to light any relevant connections which you\nmay have overlooked.\n33.4.2 Thank Your Audience\nWhile this is one of the most important things to do at the end of a presentation, it is also\none of the most forgotten things. Remember that the audience has given up their time to\nlisten to you. They could have been anywhere else in the world doing anything they wanted\nto do, but they were there with you. You should appreciate that. An example of thanking\nyour audience could look like this:\n\"That is all I have for today. I appreciate you giving me your time. Thank you very much\nand have a great day.\"\nEnding with a thank-you.\n33.5 External Links\n\u2022 General Information and Advice1\n\u2022 Managing Nervousness During Oral Presentations2\n\u2022 An Online Handbook3\n\u2022 Presentation Tips for Public Speaking4\n1 http:\/\/www.rpi.edu\/web\/writingcenter\/presentation.html\nhttp:\/\/www.learningcommons.uoguelph.ca\/ByTopic\/Learning\/LearningGeneral\/\n2\nLearningGeneralLearningFastfacts\/Fastfacts-ManagingNervousness.html\n3 http:\/\/www.ecf.utoronto.ca\/~writing\/handbook-oral.html\n4 http:\/\/www.aresearchguide.com\/3tips.html\n198 34 Grammar and Mechanics\n199  35\nUnderstanding Grammar\n201  36 What is Grammar?\n36.1 What is Grammar?\nGrammar is the study of how words and their component parts combine to\nform sentences. Grammar is the scientific study of language that includes morphology\n(also \"accidence\" or the forms that words take) and syntax (the relation of the words to other\nwords). Grammar also involves the study of the different parts or elements of speech (for\nexample nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.), the relations between those elements. A knowledge\nof grammar provides a vocabulary to discuss how the language works.\nNeed some help?\n\u2022 St. Cloud State University has a great website that is very useful for writers called LEO:\nhttp:\/\/leo.stcloudstate.edu.\nIt is especially great because it is written based on college writing.

A noun appears after a determiner. Nouns refer to persons, places, things, states,\nor qualities.\nNouns appear: after adjectives, after articles, as a subject of a sentence, as an object of a\npreposition, as a direct object of a transitive verb, and as an indirect object of transitive\nverb.\nThere are different kinds of nouns in terms of their grammatical function. These can be\nclassified into different categories:\nCount nouns refers to discrete number of things that are countable. They can take the\nplural forms and can be preceded by articles. Examples: book, house, car.\nNon count also known as mass noun and refers to things and objects that are indiscreet.\nExamples: rice, oil, weather.\nCommon nouns are any person, place, or thing. Common nouns are not capitalized.\nExamples: a city, the policeman, that desk.\nProper nouns are the name of a specific person, place or thing. Proper nouns are capitalized.\nPersonal names are the best examples of proper nouns. Examples: Nicolas, Idaho, Daily\nNews.\nCollective nouns are used to name groups. Even when a collective noun is in the singular\nform, it can be used to refer to a group. Example: team, herd, jury\nConcrete nounswordsthatrepresentobjectsonecansee, hear, touch, smellortaste. Abstract\nnouns are anything one cannot see, hear touch, smell or taste.\nSome examples of nouns are: Tom, table, classroom, desk, bottle, door, conscience.\n37.1.1 Determiners\nDeterminers are used as modifiers of a noun phrase or words that occur before a noun.\nDeterminers can be classified as articles, demonstratives, quantifiers, possessive noun and\npossessive pronouns.\nDeterminers form a closed class of words that number (exclusive of ordinals) about 50\nin English and include: the teacher, a college, a bit of honey, that person, those people,\nwhatever purpose, either way, your choice.\n205 Parts of Speech\nArticles: a, an, the.\nDemonstratives: this, that, these, those, which, etc. (when used with noun phrases).\nPossessives: my, our, your, her, his, its, their, whose, and possessive nouns (John's, the\nteacher's).\nQuantifiers: all, few, many, several, some, every, each, any, no etc.\nCardinal Numbers: one, two, fifty, etc.\nOrdinals: first, second, last, next, etc.\n37.1.2 Articles\nThere is also a special class of determiners called articles. These are the words a, an, and\nthe and sometimes proceed nouns or other words that come before a noun.\nA Definite Article (English the) is used before singular and plural nouns that refer to a\nparticular member of a group. (The cat on the mat is black.)\nAn Indefinite Article (English a, an) is used before singular nouns that refer to any member\nof a group. (A cat is a mammal.)\nA Partitive Article indicates an indefinite quantity of a mass noun; there is no partitive\narticle in English, though the words some or any often have that function. An example is\nFrench du \/ de la \/ des, as in Voulez-vous du caf\u00e9 ? (\"Do you want some coffee?\" or \"Do\nyou want coffee?\")\nA Zero Article is the absence of an article (e.g. English indefinite plural), used in some\nlanguages in contrast with the presence of one. Linguists hypothesize the absence as a zero\narticle based on the X-bar theory.\nThe words a and an are called indefinite articles, because they do not identify a particular\nperson, place, or thing. The is called a definite article, because it does specify a particular\nperson, place, or thing.\n37.1.3 Using a and an\nDetermining which word to use, either a or an, is based on the first sound of the word that\nfollows it. When a word starts with a consonant sound, use a before it. When the word\nbegins with a vowel sound, use an before it. Be careful, sometimes the first letter of the\nword is not the first sound of the word (see hour and unicorn below).\n\u2022 a show\n\u2022 an amazing show\n\u2022 an octopus\n\u2022 a huge octopus\n\u2022 an hour\n\u2022 a house\n\u2022 an apple\n\u2022 a red apple\n206 Nouns\n\u2022 a unicorn\n\u2022 an angry unicorn\n37.1.4 Singular and Plural\nIn order to show whether a noun is singular or plural, change the noun's spelling. A noun\nwill take the plural inflection '-s' for most words in English. But, there might be irregular\nplural nouns as well. Some of the examples of irregular nouns are given below:\n\u2022 boy\/boys\n\u2022 child\/children\n\u2022 woman\/women\n\u2022 man\/men\n\u2022 syllabus\/syllabi\n\u2022 ox\/oxen\n\u2022 deer\/deer\nIf you are unsure how to change a word into the plural form, check your dictionary.\n37.1.5 Possession\nNouns also undergo a morphological change to express possession (ownership) by using an\napostrophe followed by the letter \"s\" ('s). This can denote 'singular' or 'plural' possessive.\nPossession is having some degree of control over something else. Generally, to possess\nsomething, a person must have an intention to possess it. A person may be in possession of\nsome property (although possession does not always imply ownership). Like ownership, the\npossession of things is commonly regulated by states under property law. Languages have\nseveral means to indicate possession.\nEXAMPLES:\n\u2022 girl\/girl's (singular)\n\u2022 children\/children's (plural)\n\u2022 man\/man's (singular)\n\u2022 woman\/woman's (singular)\n---If a singular noun does not end in s, add 's\nThe delivery boy's truck was blocking the driveway.\nBob Dole's concession speech was stoic and dignified.\nThe student's attempts to solve the problem were rewarded.\n---If a singular common noun ends in s, add 's\u2014unless the next word begins with s. If\nthe next word begins with s, add an apostrophe only. (This includes words with s and sh\nsounds.)\nThe boss's temper was legendary among his employees.\nThe boss' sister was even meaner.\n207 Parts of Speech\nThe witness's version of the story has several inconsistencies.\nThe witness' story did not match the events recorded on tape.\n---If a singular proper noun ends in s, add an apostrophe.\nChris' exam scores were higher than any other students. --Usually singular proper nouns\nwill be names like Chris, and Alyssa.\n37.2 Pronouns\nA pronoun is a word that often replaces a noun phrase, other pronouns, or other words\nfunctioning as a noun in a sentence. The word or group of words that a pronoun replaces or\nrefers to is called the antecedent of the pronoun\nExample #1 The dog is old. It walks slowly. In this sentence, the word it replaces the dog.\nExample #2 Wow, that boy can throw a football. He must have thrown it 60 yards. In this\nsentence, the word he replaces that boy.\nThere are several types of pronouns: personal pronouns, possessive pronouns, intensive and\nreflexive pronouns, relative pronouns, interrogative pronouns, demonstrative pronouns and\nindefinite pronouns.\nPersonal Pronouns are those that refer to specific people or things. Examples: I, he, she,\nwe, us, they.\nAfter they finished shopping they put the groceries in the trunk.\nPossessive Pronouns indicate ownership. Examples: My, mine, your, our, theirs.\nMy brother bought his car.\nIntensive and Reflexive Pronouns Intensive pronouns emphasize a noun or another\npronoun.\nThe President himself called to congratulate me.\nReflexive pronouns look the same as intensive pronouns but serve a different function. They\nname a receiver of an action.\nWe shopped ourselves to death.\nRelative Pronouns introduce subordinate clauses and function as adjectives.\n208 Pronouns\nThe man who yelled at us to get off his lawn did not even own the\nproperty!\nInterrogative Pronouns introduce questions.\nWho was that? Who will help me? Which do you prefer?)\nDemonstrative Pronouns point out specific persons, places, things or ideas such as that,\nthose, this, these.\nThis is my dog.\nIndefinite Pronouns refer to non-specific people or things. Examples: All, both, any, few,\neveryone, each, nobody, some, several, neither.\nSeveral people cheered after the solo.\nPronouns most often replace a noun but can sometimes function as a determiner. These are\ncalled pronoun\/determiners because they are in the form of a pronoun but function as an\ndeterminer.\nThis material was new to me. This functions as a pronoun\/adjective.\nPronoun Problems\nPronouns can cause many problems for writers. Here are some tips to help you.\n- Make sure the pronoun and its antecedent (the noun or pronoun to which the pronoun\nrefers) agree. They must both be singular or plural.\nExamples: My dog finished her food. (Both are singular) The dogs fought for their food.\n(Both are plural)\n-Collective nouns should be used as singular unless they are obviously plural.\nExample: The jury gave its verdict.\n-Compound antecedents connected by and should be used as plural.\nExample: Jack and Jill are getting married.\n-Some antecedents that are indefinite and morphologically singular (anyone, each, everyone,\nnobody, somebody) can take they.\nExamples: And everyone to rest themselves betake - Shakespeare, The Rape of Lucrece,\n1549 I would have everybody marry if they can do it properly - Jane Austen, Mansfield\nPark, 1814 ... the detachment and sympathy of someone approaching their own death - Alan\nMoorehead, The Blue Nile, 1962\n209 Parts of Speech\n-Make sure the antecedent is clear.\nExample: When she set the picture on the glass table, it broke.\nBy using it after two nouns, the reference is unclear. Which item broke? The picture or the\ntable? When reading your writing, ask yourself these questions. If you are unclear as to\nwhich noun is the antecedent, it will be unclear for the reader as well.\n-Deciding whether to use we or us\nIf you are unsure as to which pronoun to use, try omitting the antecedent.\nExample: We\/Us workers would like to have more breaks. It makes much mores sense to\nsay We would instead of Us would.\n37.3 Verbs\nA verb is the main word in the predicate of a sentence. It expresses an action, describes an\noccurrence, or establishes a state of being. Depending on the language, a verb may vary in\nform according to many factors, possibly including its tense, aspect, mood and voice. It\nmay also agree with the person, gender, and\/or number of some of its arguments (subject\nobject, etc.)\nan action would be: Josh threw the ball.\nJason kicked the football.\nan occurrence would be: a hush descended on the crowd.\na feeling warmed his heart.\na state of being would be: Jill was serious.\nThe house is on the hill.\n37.3.1 Principal Parts\nThe principal parts of verbs are the different forms that verbs take depending on how they\nare used in a sentence. For example, take the verb escape.\nbase form: to escape\npast tense: escaped\npresent participle: am escaping\npast participle: escaped\n210 Verbs\n37.3.2 Subject-Verb Agreement\nVerbs need to agree with their subjects in number (singular or plural) and in person (first,\nsecond, or third). Find the verb and ask \"who or what\" is doing the action of that verb.\nTo make verbs agree with compound subjects, follow this example:\nA pencil, a backpack, and a notebook was issued to each student.\nThis sentence should be edited to say:\nA pencil, a backpack, and a notebook were issued to each student.\nVerbs will never agree with nouns that are in prepositional phrases. To make verbs agree\nwith their subjects, follow this example:\nThe direction of the three plays are the topic of my talk.\nThis sentence should be edited to say:\nThe direction of the three plays is the topic of my talk.\nThe subject of my talk is direction, not plays.\nIn the English language, verbs usually follow subjects. But when this order is reversed, the\nwriter must make the verb agree with the subject, not with a noun that happens to precede\nit. For example:\nBeside the house stands sheds filled with tools.\nThis sentence should be edited to say:\nBeside the house stand sheds filled with tools.\nBecause the subject is sheds; it is plural, so the verb must be stand.\n===Verb Tenses===\nTenses in a verb help to show when the action expressed by a verb takes place. The three\nsimple tenses are the present tense, past tense, and future tense. Verbs also take aspect.\nAspect refers to progression or completion of an action. The 'aspect' affixes are denoted by\n'-en' and '-ing,'which forms non finite participle forms. ---Present Tense Present tense\nexpresses an unchanging, repeated, or reoccurring action or situation that exists only now.\nIt can also represent a widespread truth.\nExamples: The mountains are tall and white. Unchanging action\nEvery year, the school council elects new members. Recurring\naction\nPb is the chemical symbol for lead. Widespread truth\n211 Parts of Speech\n---Past Tense Past tense expresses an action or situation that was started and finished in\nthe past. Most past tense verbs end in -ed. The irregular verbs have special past tense\nforms which must be memorized.\nExamples: W.W.II ended in 1945. Regular -ed past\nErnest Hemingway wrote \"The Old Man and the Sea.\" Irregular form\n---Future Tense Future tense expresses an action or situation that will occur in the future.\nThis tense is formed by using will\/shall with the simple form of the verb.\nExamples: The speaker of the House will finish her term in May of\n2012.\nThe future tense can also be expressed by using am, is, or are with\ngoing to.\nThe surgeon is going to perform the first bypass in Minnesota.\nWe can also use the present tense form with an adverb or adverbial\nphrase to show future time.\nThe president speaks tomorrow. (Tomorrow is a future time adverb.)\n---Aspect: Refers to the nature of the action described by the verb. There are three aspects:\nindefinite (or simple), complete (or perfect), continuing (or progressive).\nThe three indefinite tenses, or simple tenses, describe an action but do not state whether\nthe action is finished:\nthe simple past (\"I went\") the simple present (\"I go\") the simple future (\"I will go\")\nProgressive: He is reading a book\nPerfect : Mary has taken her work seriously\nThe simple tenses locate an action only within the three basic time frames that we've\nrecognized, present, past, and future. There are also three complex aspects of time that can\nbe expressed:\nProgressive forms: express continuing actions.\nPerfect forms: express actions completed before\nanother action or time in the present, past, or future\nPerfect progressive forms: express actions that\ncontinue up to some point in the present, past or future.\n===Transitive and Intransitive Verbs=== Transitive verbs help to carry out the\naction of a specific subject, and are followed by a noun phrase. A transitive verb must be\nfollowed by a direct object.\nFor Example:\nHe ran to school.\n(Subject) (did something) (object-where?)\nShe cuts her hair every month.\nThe dog runs around the tree.\n212 Adjectives\nIntransitive verbs do not take any object, but they do express the actions that don't require\nthe subject to do something to something else. The intransitive verbs can stand alone in a\nsentence.\nFor Example:\nKatie ran.\n-The intransitive verb ran is a complete\naction by itself and doesn't need an object\nto complete the action.\nJack fell on the steps in the entryway.\n37.3.3 Linking Verbs\nLinking Verbs link the relationship between the subject and the rest of the sentence. This\ntype of verb explains the connection between the subject and it's complement.\nThe most common linking verb is \"to be.\" The linking verb forms the main verb in a sentence\nand is also known as the copula.\nExample: The tea is hot.\nThere are many books on the shelf.\nIn the above sentences, is and are serve as the linking verbs as well as the main verbs in the\nsentences.\nCommon Linking Verbs:\nappear become\nseem taste\ncontinue remain\nA true linking verbs are any form of be {am, is, as, were, are being, might, etc.} The true\nlinking verbs act as the main verb in a sentence.\nexample: The work was very tiring.\nIn this sentence, was function as the linking verb which is also the main verb in the sentence.\nThis type of sentences cannot be transformed into passive sentences because the verbs do\nnot have a direct object (non-transitive verbs).\nIn your writing you can also input verbs with multiple personalities. such as appear, feel,\nremain, smell.\n37.4 Adjectives\nAdjectives modify or limit the meaning of nouns or pronouns, usually by describing, quanti-\nfying, or identifying those words and is often described as determiners. An adjective answers\nthe question what kind, which one, how many or how much.\n213 Parts of Speech\nA describing adjective would be... Josh threw the yellow ball.\nA quantifying adjective would be... We caught several sunfish last weekend.\nA identifying adjective would be... Carol tried hard to win that race.\nThe most widely recognized adjectives are those words, such as big, old, and tired that\nactually describe people, places, or things. These words can themselves be modified with\nadverbs, as in the phrase very big.\nBesides being used to modify a meaning, adjectives can be used to compare items.\na comparative adjective would be: This year's graduating class was smaller than last year's\nclass.\nanother comparative adjective would be: This year's offensive line was the smallest in the\npast few decades.\nFinally, adjectives can be pronouns. Pronouns used as adjectives usually show ownership.\nA pronoun used as an adjective would be: Shelia bought her first car yesterday. Another\npronoun used as an adjective would be: The Smith's saw their dreams crumble when they\nwere denied a mortgage.\n37.5 Adjectival Phrase\nAn adjectival phrase is a phrase with an adjective as its head (e.g. full of toys). In English,\nan adjectival phrase may occur as a post-modifier to a noun (a bin full of toys), or as a\npredicate to a verb (the bin is full of toys and clothes).\n37.6 Adverbs\nAdverbs are modifiers or descriptive words, phrases, or clauses that bring detail to your\nsentences. An adverb answers the question where, when, how or to what extent. They modify\nverbs, adjectives, other adverbs, or entire clauses. Once you figure out what word you want\nto modify, you are able to choose which modifier you need. Many adverbs end in -ly except\nfor always, never, very and well. The most commonly used adverb is not.\n37.6.1 Difference between adverbs and adjectives\nAdjectives and adverbs answer different questions. An adjective modifies a noun or pronoun\nand answers these questions:\n\u2022 Which: the latest magazine arrived.\n214 Conjunctions\n\u2022 What kind: a huge difference remained.\n\u2022 How many: the three books were different.\nAn adverb modifies a verb an answers these questions:\n\u2022 When: tomorrow, the storm will quit.\n\u2022 How often: students change majors frequently.\n\u2022 Where: the class is held here today.\nWhen choosing between an adjective and adverb, determine the word being modified and\nthen figure out its part of speech.\n37.6.2 Forming adverbs\nOften adverbs are formed from adjectives, but some are not derived from other words such\nas again, almost, always, never, here, there, now, often, seldom, well. The adverbs that are\nderived from adjectives can be formed by adding the suffix -ly to the ending.\n\u2022 beautifully\n\u2022 strangely\n\u2022 cleverly\n\u2022 respectfully\nRemember that an -ly does not make the word an adverb. Some adjectives also end in -ly\nsuch as friendly and lovely.\n37.6.3 Placement\nThe location of the adverb in a sentence can change the rhythm and emphasis dramatically.\n\u2022 Formerly, Star Wars was just three movies.\n\u2022 Star Wars was formerly just three movies.\n37.7 Conjunctions\ncon\u2027junc\u2027tion Pronunciation Key -[kuhn-juhngk-shuhn]\nConjunctions join words, phrases or clauses within a sentence. They illustrate a relationship\nbetween the elements that are being joined.\nCoordinating Conjunctions for, and, nor, but, or, yet, and so are coordinating conjunc-\ntions. These are conjunctions of two grammatically equal elements such as two nouns or\ntwo clauses. This can also be remembered through the acronym FANBOYS.\nExample: I like apples and oranges.\nCorrelative Conjunctions come in pairs such as either...or, neither...nor, not only...but\nalso. These conjunctions also connect two equal grammatical elements.\nExample: I will have either pasta or pizza for dinner.\n215 Parts of Speech\nSubordinating Conjunctions After, although, as if, because, even though, once, in order\nthat, and rather than are some common subordinating conjunctions. These are conjunctions\nthat introduce a subordinate clause and illustrate a relationship with the rest of the sentence.\nExample: Although I would rather party tonight, I will go to the library instead.\nConjunctive Adverbs are used to show a relationship between two independent clauses\n(complete sentences). Some examples are accordingly, furthermore, therefore, however.\nExample: I always brush my teeth; therefore, I have no cavities.\n37.8 Prepositions\nPrepositions are words that come before a noun or pronoun that form a phrase that modifies\nanother phrase within the sentence. This phrase, the prepositional phrase, usually functions\nas an adjective or adverb and often indicates a position or place.\nSome examples of prepositions:\nabout, above, after, along, among, as, before, behind, below, beside, between, by, despite,\nduring, for, in, into, like, of, onto, opposite, over, past, regarding, since, and with.\nExample: He brought his furniture into the apartment.\nSome common compound prepositions:\naccording to, except for, in front of, next to, as well as, instead of, due to, in spite of, because\nof, and with regard to\nPrepositional Phrasesbeginwithaprepositionandmostoftenendwithanoun. Thenoun\nis known as the object of the preposition. There are several different types of prepositional\nphrases classified by the type of word it modifies.\nAdjective prepositional phrases most often modify the noun directly before the prepo-\nsitional phrase. These usually answer the questions which one? or what kind of?.\nExample: The thoughts of the professor were closed minded. of the professor is the\nprepositional phrase which modifies thoughts. What kind of thoughts? Those of the\nprofessor.\nAdverbial prepositional phrases modify a verb within the sentence. These usually\nanswer the questions When? Where? How? Why? Under what conditions? and To what\ndegree?\nExample: You cannot judge a book by its cover. The prepositional phrase, by its cover,\nmodifies the verb judge. How can you not judge a book? By its cover.\n37.9 Interjections\ninter\u00b7jection ---The word \"interjection\" literally means \"thrown in between\" from the Latin\ninter (\"between\") and iacere (\"throw\").\n216 Active vs. Passive Voice\nThe part of speech that usually expresses emotion and is capable of standing alone. This uses\nan exclamation marker (!), also known as the exclamation point. Even when interjections are\na part of a sentence, they don't directly relate to the grammar of that sentence. Interjections\ntake on more than one of the following usages:\n-sudden outburst -a form of salutation -to emphasize in the imperative mood\nWords belonging to this part of speech, such as:\nUgh! or Wow! Oh! Hey! Ow!\nCategory:Rhetoric and Composition1\n37.10 Active vs. Passive Voice\nA shift between active voice and passive voice is confusing to readers and should be avoided\nat all times. If you do shift voice, justify it and have a reason for it.\nVoice refers to the verb's ability to show whether a subject receives or acts the action\nreceived by the verb. When using the active voice, the subject performs the action.\nFor Example:\nThe boy ran straight home at dinner time\n<The boy---the subject, did the action----he ran.\nIn writing, active voice is more dramatic and often users fewer words than passive voice in\nEnglish. There will be introduced more in the \"active and passive\" section later.\n37.11 Types of Sentences\nIn English there are three main types of sentences. They function according to the usage\nand pragmatics. They are also referred to as moods, in English. The fourth type of sentence\nmight be termed as interrogative.\nIndicative The indicative mood is used in factual statements. All intentions in speaking\nthat a particular language does not put into another mood use the indicative. It is the most\ncommonly used mood and is found in all languages. Example: \"Paul is reading books.\" or\n\"Paul reads books.\"\nImperative The imperative mood expresses commands, direct requests, and prohibitions.\nIn many circumstances, directly using the imperative mood seems blunt or even rude, so it\nis often used with care. Example: \"Read that book, Paul!\"\n1 http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Category%3ARhetoric%20and%20Composition\n217 Parts of Speech\nSubjunctive The subjunctive mood has several uses in independent clauses. Examples\nincludediscussinghypotheticalorunlikelyevents, expressingopinionsoremotions, ormaking\npolite requests (the exact scope is language-specific). Example: \" God bless America.\"\n37.12 Tag Question\nA type of question where a pronoun is attached to the end of the\ndeclarative clause, where the pronoun agrees with number and gender\nof the subject in the declarative clause.\nTag questions are used for the purpose of emphasis.\nWhen using tag questions there are four things to watch for:\n1. What kind of verb is it?\n2. What tense is the verb?\n3. Is the sentence affirmative or negative?\n4. Do you change the pronoun?\nSome additional things to look for when using tag verbs are:\n\u02dcCopy the auxiliary after the end of the declarative clause\n\u02dcInsert a \"do\" support where the auxiliary is missing (Note that the \"do\" support agrees in\nnumber and tense.)\n\u02dcIf the declarative clause is negative, then the tag should be positive.\n\u02dcIf the declarative clause is positive, then the tag should be negative.\nFor Example:\n\u02dc We are meeting at 7 o'clock, aren't we?\nThe tag question would be \"aren't we\" to make an emphasis on\nthe first part of the sentence.\n\u02dc He won't drive in the storm, will he?\nThe tag question in this example is \"will he\"\n37.13 Wh-Question\nThere can be nine types of Wh questions based on the sentence structure.The \"Wh\" words\nthat forms the questions are:\nWho (or Whom) ?Person\nWhat?Object\/Idea\/Action\nWhose?Possession\nWhich?Specific subject\nWhen?Time\n218 Clauses\nWhere?Place\nWhy?Reason\nHow?Manner\nTheWhwordcanfunctionasthesubject, objectorpossessivedetermineroftheinterrogative\nclause.\nFor example:\nWho gave John permission to watch movies? (subject)\nFrom whom did John get permission to watch movies? (object)\nWhose book did John read yesterday? (possessive determiner)\nThere are few generalizations which can be noted here:\n1. If the 'Wh' is the subject then the structure of the sentence remains intact\n2. If the 'Wh' is not the subject then auxiliary inversion is required to form the question\nTo form questions with 'Wh' word?\n1. Begin with the 'Wh' word\n2. If the 'Wh' word is the subject then no change in the structure is required\n3. If 'Wh' word is not the subject then subject-auxiliary inversion is required\n4. If the auxiliary is missing, then appropriate \"do\" support is to be added to form the\nquestion\n5. The \"do\" support should match in tense and number and it will change the verb to\nbare infinitive.\nThe grammar used with 'Wh' questions depends on if the topic being asked about is\nthe subject or predicate of a sentence. When using the subject pattern, you will need to\ninputthepersonorthingbeingaskedaboutwiththeappropriate'Wh'wordforthatsentence.\nFor example:\nJack is playing with Jill\na. Who is playing with Jill? ('Wh' word is the subject -- somebody\nis doing the action of playing)\nb. To whom is Jack playing music? ('Wh' word is the object --\nsomebody is receiving the action of Jack's playing)\n37.14 Clauses\nA clause is a group of words with a subject and a predicate. A sentence containing a single\nclause is called uniclausal and a sentence with more than one clause is called multiclausal.\nClauses having one finite verb, as in uniclausal or minimum of one finite verb construction\nin a multiclausal structure is called finite clauses. A clause having a non-finite verb is\ncalled a non finite clause.\nAn independent clause is part of sentence that can function as a stand-alone structure. A\ndependent clause on the other hand cannot function by itself and needs an independent\nclause to complete its meaning.\n219 Parts of Speech\nA third type of clause is known as matrix clause, which function as an independent clause\nbut requires a complement clause to complete the meaning.\nSubordinate Clause\nSubordinate clauses are sometimes called dependent clauses. They begin with a subordinate\nconjunction or a relative pronoun and contain both a subject and a verb. Some common\nsubordinate conjunctions are: although, since, before, because, after, if, whenever, which,\nand when. example: Although it was dark outside, Jill went to play basketball.\nRelative Clause\nA relative clause functions as a modifier and works as an adjective. It has four main features:\n1. contains a subject and a verb\n2. begins with a relative pronoun-who, whom, that,\nwhich, whose or a relative adverb-why, when, where\n3. functions as an adjective\n4. can be restrictive or non-restrictive\nExample of a restrictive relative clause: Participants in this marathon who are high school\nstudents need to bring permission slips signed by their parents.\nExample of non-restrictive relative clause: Participants in this marathon, who come from all\nover the city, must sign in by 8AM.\n1.A restrictive relative clause would change the meaning if deleted, so commas aren't needed.\n(In the example above, the clause restricts the people who need to bring permission slips to\nonly the high school students.)\n2.A non-restrictive relative clause is just extra information about the subject and may be\nomitted without changing the meaning.\nComplement Clause\nA complement clause is a notional sentence or predication that's an argument of a predicate\nexample: I know that it is raining hard.\nThere are three types of complement clauses: ordinary, noun, and adjective\nNoun Clauses\nNoun clauses can function as a subject, subject complements, objects of prepositions, or\ndirect objects. So a noun clause cannot stand apart but is always contained within a clause.\nA few examples of noun clauses that usually will begin with a relative pronoun are: that,\nwhomever, whose, which, and whoever. Here the construction of the clause occurs directly\nafter the noun phrase.\nFor Example:\nHe asked when she went to the library.\nThe italicized section is an example of a direct object function.\n220 Partitive\nHe was looking for whichever car was the best find.\nIn this example, the section in italics is an object of a\npreposition.\nFor instance, in the first example for the independent clause isn't just he asked but he asked\nwhen she went to the library.\nAdjective Clauses\nAdjective clauses modify nouns and pronouns in other clauses.\nA adjective clause always begins with a relative pronoun (that, who, whom, whose, which)\nor a relative adverb (where, when, why).\nFor Example:\nThe test, which took an hour, earned me an A for the class.\nHave you seen the desk where Kelsi sat?\n-The parts in italics are the adjective clauses for the nouns test\nand desk.\nAdverb Clauses\nAdverb clauses modify a verb, an adjective or an adverb.\nAdverb clauses begin with subordinating conjunctions: when, because, than, where, before,\nafter\nFor Example:\nHitchcock paved the way for directors when he created a new filmmaking style.\n(when... modifies the verb)\nHitchcock was important because he proved that horror doesn't need gore.\n(because... modifies the adjective)\nOrdinary Clauses\nAn ordinary clause functions like a complement clause using that as the most common word\nto form the structure. For example: That the earth is flat was a common misperception.\nThe italicized portion suggests an ordinary complement clause in the subject position.\n37.15 Partitive\nPartitive construction helps to modify count and non-count nouns.It denotes a part of a\nwhole. The partitive noun phrase agrees in number and tense according to its appearance in\nthe subject place.It takes the following structure:\nNP (count)+of+ NP.\nexample: A pair of shoes is what I need. (the partitive is in italics)\n221 Parts of Speech\nA lot of work is required before this project is over. (the partitive\nis in\nitalics)\n37.16 Collective\nThis is a usage which is based on the semantic and pragmatic use of the language. A\nvariation could be noted in Standard American English (SAE) and British English (BE).\nexamples: The home team has routed the visitors. (SAE)\nThe home team have routed the visitors. (BE)\n37.16.1 Phrasal Verb\nA phrasal verb is a phrase construction which is made up of a verb and an adverbial particle\nor a preposition. It is also understood as an idiomatic construction where the meaning\nis different from the sum of its parts. It can be either prepositional (non separable) or\nparticle verbs (separable).\nprepositional: The parents called on the teacher.\nparticle verb: He looked the number up.\n222 38 Sentences\n1. REDIRECT Rhetoric and Composition\/Types of Sentences1\n1 http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Rhetoric%20and%20Composition%2FTypes%20of%20Sentences\n223  39 Active and Passive Voice\nDisclaimer: In everyday writing, the active voice is used to concisely and forcibly describe\npeople's actions. The passive voice also has important rhetoric uses in everyday writing. It\nis more common in formal writing that tries to be less personal. The terms \"active\" and\n\"passive voice\" and their significance to good writing are explained in the article below.\n39.1 Voice in English Writing\nLanguages have different levels of formality that vary with the purpose, the audience, and\nthe situation. Generally, written English is more formal than spoken English because the\nperson has more time to think about what to say. Formal writing uses fewer personal\npronouns and less colloquial language, or slang. Another important difference is the use of\ngrammatical voice.\n\"Voice\" has two meanings in writing. \"Voice\" can be defined as \"how the writer's personality\nand attitude toward the topic are revealed to the audience.\" Voice, in this definition, is\nwhat makes one writer sound different from another. \"Voice\" is also a grammatical term; for\nclarity, it may be referred to as \"grammatical voice.\" There are two voices discussed in this\nsection: the active voice and the passive voice.\n39.2 Active and Passive Voice Sentences\nMost English sentences are written with active, passive, or neuter verbs, such as \"to be\"\nverbs. The active and passive voices are the two main voices in English, but some sentences\nmay also be considered to be in the middle or mediopassive voice. Voice is the relationship\nbetween the subject and the verb in a clause or the transfer of action.\n\u2022 In the active voice, the subject performs the action. The subject of an active-voice\nconstruction is known as an agent. A clause with an active, transitive verb will be in the\nform of subject-verb-object.\nExample: The student finished the exercise.\n\u2022 In the passive voice, the subject receives the action. The subject of a passive-voice\nconstruction is known as a patient. An active voice clause can be passivized, or recast in\nthe passive voice (for example, to increase formality), by making the object of the active\nclause the subject of the passive clause. \"The exercise\" is the object in the sentence above.\nThe verb will be \"was finished.\" For a passive verb, the tense and subject-verb agreement\nare always shown through the auxiliary verb \"to be.\" The main verb is always the past\n225 Active and Passive Voice\nparticiple. The subject of the active voice sentence can be included in a prepositional\nphrase with \"by.\"\nExample: The exercise was finished by the student.\nActive Voice Passive Voice\nThe teacher referred to \"voice\" as a \"Voice\" was referred to as a grammati-\ngrammatical term. cal term by the teacher.\nThe man yelled at the waiter. The waiter was yelled at by the man.\nMillions of people lived in the houses. The houses were lived in by millions\nof people.\nIntransitive verbs can be used in the passive voice when a prepositional phrase is included.\nIntransitive verbs without prepositional phrases cannot be passivized. There is no word to\nbecome the subject of the sentence.\nActive voice: Millions of people lived.\nPassive voice: ? was lived.\nLinking verbs (such as being verbs) are intransitive verbs that can never be used in the\npassive voice. They do not show action and are thus neither active nor passive. They are\ncalled neuter verbs.\n39.3 Use of the Passive Voice\nConverting an active-voice clause to a passive-voice clause does not change meaning, but can\nbe done for increased formality or emphasis. Linguistic studies have found high percentages\nof passive verbs in formal writing. The passive voice can emphasize an agent, a patient, or\nan adverb. It can be used for narrative flow and continuity in conversations.\nEmphasizing the agent: Hamlet was written by Shakespeare.\nThepassivevoiceemphasizesShakespearebyputtinghisnameattheend, themostemphatic\npart of a sentence.\nEmphasizing the patient: Jamey was fascinated by Language Arts.\nThe passive-voice construction emphasizes Jamey more effectively than the active-voice\nequivalent \"Language Arts fascinated Jamey.\"\nEmphasizing the adverb: That is strictly prohibited.\nBecause a passive verb consists of two words, an adverb becomes emphatic when placed\nbetween \"to be\" and the past participle.\nThe passive voice can be used to eliminate first- and second-pronouns in formal writing.\nActive voice: I hope that....\nPassive voice: It is hoped that....\n226 The Structural Difference\nIn formal writing, the writer may want to alternate between sentences in the first person\nand passive sentences in which the pronoun is implied to prevent the monotony caused by\nstarting too many sentences with \"I.\"\nResearch studies are described in the passive voice. Research is intended to be objective,\nwithout the biases of the researchers conducting the experiments. An experiment should be\nthe same no matter who performs it.\nActive voice: I collected samples from the subjects.\nPassive voice: Samples were collected from the subjects.\nA sentence in the imperative mood can be rewritten in the passive voice to make it more\nformal or less harsh.\nActive voice: Do not smoke.\nPassive voice: Smoking is prohibited.\nActive voice: Avoid contractions in formal writing.\nPassive voice: Contractions should be avoided in formal writing.\nThe examples above for first- and second-person pronouns make use of the institutional\npassive, which omits the agent. In writing and speech, almost eighty-five percent of passive\nsentences are in the institutional passive.\n39.4 The Structural Difference\nThe difference between active and passive is in how many noun phrases in the sentence that\nare not introduced with the use of a preposition. Compare the following sentences:\nI dropped the ball.\nThe ball was dropped by me.\nThe man offered the butler a reward.\nThe Butler was offered a reward by the man.\n\u2022 In the active voice, the sentence has between two and three noun phrases that do not\nrequire a prepositional phrase. These are called the subject, the direct object and\nthe indirect object.\n\u2022 I dropped the ball. (\"I\" is the subject. \"The ball\" is the direct object.)\n\u2022 The man offered the butler a reward. (\"The man\" is the subject. \"The butler\" is the\nindirect object and \"a reward\" is the direct object.)\n\u2022 The man offered a reward to the butler. (\"The man\" is still the subject. \"A reward\" is\nstill the direct object, but \"the butler\" is now part of a prepositional phrase and is no\nlonger an indirect object.)\n\u2022 In the passive voice, the sentence has one fewer noun phrase than the corresponding\nactive. The subject is removed and can appear only in an optional prepositional phrase.\n227 Active and Passive Voice\nThe object is promoted to subject. For ditransitive verbs, the direct or indirect object\ncan become the subject.\n\u2022 The ball was dropped by me. (\"The ball\" is now the subject. \"Me\" shows up in an\noptional \"by\"-phrase.)\n\u2022 The Butler was offered a reward by the man. (\"The butler\" is now the subject. There\nis only one object: \"a reward.\" \"The man\" shows up in an optional \"by\"-phrase.)\n\u2022 A reward was offered to the butler by the man. (\"A reward\" is now the subject. \"The\nbutler\" is not considered an indirect object because it is part of a prepositional phrase.\n\"The man\" shows up in an optional \"by\"-phrase.)\nWithout a change in meaning, using the active or passive voice can emphasize different noun\nphrases in the examples above.\n228 40\nUnderstanding Mechanics\n229  41 Mechanics\n41.1 What is Mechanics?\nThe word \"mechanics\" refers primarily to spelling and punctuation; in short, aspects of\nwriting that are not shared by speaking. When and where should you use a comma? What\nare the rules for semicolons? Questions like this..\n\u2022 Punctuation1\nPeriods, colons, semi-colons, commas, question marks, apostrophes, hyphens, parentheses,\nbrackets, and dashes.\nCategory:Rhetoric and Composition2\n1 Chapter 42 on page 233\n2 http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Category%3ARhetoric%20and%20Composition\n231  42 Punctuation\n42.1 What Is Punctuation For?\n\"Proper punctuation\" shows up repeatedly in discussions about expectations and criteria for\nwhat constitutes good academic writing \u2014 whether it's administrators, teachers, students, or\nlegislators talking about what should be taught in the first-year writing classroom. But the\nword \"proper\" might limit or even mislead our thinking of punctuation. Used knowledgeably\nand deliberately, punctuation is more than proper; it's essential to making meaning. Also,\nthere's a faint connotation of \"arbitrary\" with the word \"proper\" \u2014 and effective punctuation\nis anything but arbitrary.\nNor is punctuation merely a reflection of oral behavior, as suggested by the familiar\ninjunctions \"Use a comma for a pause\" or \"Where your voice drops, use a period.\" Instead,\npunctuation functions as a rich set of clues that have emerged specifically for readers working\nthrough text on a page or screen, visually and two-dimensionally.\nThe nature of reading demands such clues precisely because text is not speech. Speakers\nhave pitch, pace, hand gestures, facial expressions, and other means to let a listener know\nsuch things as which points to link to each other and which points should stand on their own,\nor whether information is necessary in that it restricts meaning or whether it is extraneous.\nMoreover, ordinary speech usually accommodates a listener's questions, allowing for a more\nrapid arrival at a joint understanding between speaker and listener. The greater temporal\nand spatial distance between writer and reader, however, calls for a code that can work\nto give clues about the writer's intended meaning in the absence of such direct two-way\ncommunication.\n42.2 Is It Worth the Work?\nWhile punctuation does function as a vital part of making meaning within a text, it\ncan\u2019t be denied that it serves another function as well: that of credibility marker. Using\npunctuation according to the conventions of the academic community does serve as a sort\nof license into, and within, that community. To take the time and effort to learn and use\npunctuation conventionally sends the message to readers that \u201cI\u2019m part of your community;\nI can speak your language (use your code). So, listen to me.\u201d It signals a sort of collegial\nwillingness to hear and to be heard: to use a common code that enhances and expands\nunderstandability instead of restricting it to yourself. Codes can exclude and include; by\nusing the code of \u201ccorrect\u201d punctuation, you\u2019re signaling a willingness to be included in\na group of people who\u2019ve agreed on how to use certain dots and squiggles on the page to\nindicate certain relationships among ideas. For whatever reason you value inclusion in the\n233 Punctuation\nacademic community, subscribing to (buying into) conventional punctuation is one among\nmany certificates of authenticity you can carry.\nWhy is that? Why should conventional punctuation exert such influence? Part of the\nanswer can be found in the way different punctuation marks support characteristics that\nthe academic community values in its overall discourse. This is another way in which\nconventional punctuation operates on more than a merely arbitrary level: It serves to\nindicate relationships among ideas in a sentence or paragraph that echo the very ways in\nwhich the academic community organizes and develops its lines of thought. Those ways\ninclude segmentation, coordination, subordination, modification, and supplementation --\nconcepts discussed later in this section.\n42.3 What's With All the Jargon?\nHave you ever tried to complete a task with someone who doesn\u2019t know the names of the\nobjects you\u2019re working with? Think of changing your oil with a person who doesn\u2019t know\nthe terms \u201cdipstick,\u201d \u201coil pan,\u201d \u201cdrain plug,\u201d or \u201cfilter wrench.\u201d Or imagine trying to show\nsomeone how to make an omelet, and they don\u2019t know what a \u201cwhisk\u201d is or what it means\nto \u201cdice\u201d onions. Chances are, it will take longer than usual for you to get the task done;\nperhaps you may even decide to start off with a brief vocabulary review before focusing on\nthe task itself. Let\u2019s face it, \u201cthat thingy there\u201d takes you only so far.\nLike other specialized subjects, punctuation has a specialized vocabulary that allows us to\ntalk about it: a set of terms we use to name parts, describe purposes, explain activities, and\nidentify errors. The attractive thing about a lexicon is that it saves time by eliminating a lot\nof guesswork and reinvention. While punctuation jargon can sometimes sound unnecessarily\ninflated (the word \u201cand,\u201d for example, is a \u201ccoordinating conjunction\u201d) or even faintly\naccusatory (an unnecessary comma is called \u201cdisruptive\u201d), having a consistent set of terms\nmakes it easier to use punctuation correctly.\nIn short: Yes, it does help to know some of the jargon when learning punctuation. The good\nnews is, once you learn a few terms, you can plug them into formulas that you can use to\nquickly get a solid grasp on correct punctuation.\n42.3.1 OK, which terms do I need to know?\nThe sections below about specific punctuation marks introduce terms as you\u2019ll need them.\nBut there are a few terms it helps to know beforehand.\nIndependent clause\nThis is a group of words that could stand on its own as a complete sentence because it\nexpresses a complete thought.\nHow can you tell if a thought or sentence is \u201ccomplete\u201d? While there are more complicated\ntests involving more jargon, one simple test that usually works is to read the group of\nwords out loud with extra expressiveness. We almost always can \u201chear\u201d completeness or\n234 What's With All the Jargon?\nincompleteness. Every independent clause must have a subject (even if it is only implied as\nin a command) and a verb (even if it is only the verb to be).\nWhen you read an independent clause aloud, it has a sound of being finished. You and any\nother listener are not waiting for more information. Your voice usually drops with an air of\nfinality when you are done reading an independent clause aloud.\nExamples:\n\u2022 Conflict resolution requires looking first at involved parties collectively.\n\u2022 One challenge is determining whether all parties truly want to resolve the conflict.\n\u2022 The conflict may be serving another purpose.\nDependent clause\nIn contrast, when you read a dependent clause aloud, you or your listener has the feeling of\n\u201cWell...? What\u2019s next? Finish it up!\u201d A dependent clause is a group of words that can\u2019t\nstand on its own as a sentence because it does not express a complete thought. It leaves the\nlistener (and reader) hanging.\nIn addition, there are certain words that make a clause dependent. When the following\nwords appear at the beginning of a clause, that clause is dependent:\nafter, although, as, as if, as long as, as soon as, as though, because, before, during, even if,\neven though, ever since, if, in case, in order that, once, on condition that, provided that,\nsince, so that, then, though, unless, until, what, whatever, when, whenever, whether, which,\nwhichever, while, whomever, whose, why\nExamples:\n\u2022 Until all parties agree that resolution is a shared priority\n\u2022 Which allows the process to move forward\n\u2022 An example being one person who retains power as long as the conflict goes unsolved\nIndependent clause and dependent clause refer to groups of words. Two more terms it\nhelps to know beforehand are labels for certain individual words.\nCoordinating conjunctions\nWhen these seven short words words link two independent clauses together within one\nsentence, they are called coordinating conjunctions:\nand, but, for, nor, or, so, yet\nEachcoordinatingconjunctionsignalsaspecificrelationshipbetweentheindependentclauses\nit joins.\n\u2022 Andsignalsadditionandextension. Usedwithacommabetweentwoindependentclauses,\nit tells the reader that the thoughts expressed in those clauses should be considered\ntogether and with equal weight.\nEach workplace conflict is unique, and each requires its own assessment.\n235 Punctuation\n\u2022 But expresses contrast. It tells readers that the thought expressed in the second\nindependent clause is in opposition to, or otherwise different from, the thought expressed\nin the first independent clause.\nEach workplace conflict is unique, but several general principles apply to finding solutions.\n\u2022 For signals that the second thought is a statement of causation relative to the first\nthought or that the second thought should be considered as significantly informing the\nfirst thought.\nEach workplace conflict is unique, for each context is unique.\n\u2022 Nor links two complete thoughts expressed as negatives, indicating that neither is an\noption.\nSerious conflicts cannot be solved by ignoring them, nor can they be solved by attempting\nto legislate past them.\n\u2022 Or conveys option\/choice or consequence (as in the sense of \u201cor else\u201d) between the two\nthoughts.\nConflicts may be resolved with one mediated discussion, or extended negotiation may be\nrequired to bring about consensus.\n\u2022 So signals that the second thought is a statement of effect or consequence relative to the\nfirst thought.\nWorkplace conflicts can ultimately be opportunities for growth, so managers should\napproach them confidently.\n\u2022 Yet tells the reader that the thought expressed in the second independent clause is in\nopposition or contrast to the first. It also can indicate simultaneity, in effect saying to the\nreader, \u201cAt the same time, after you\u2019ve read the first thought, you should also consider\nthis thought.\u201d\nWorkplace conflicts can ultimately be opportunities for growth, yet most managers\napproach them with dread and apprehension.\nConjunctive adverbs\nThese are words expressing a relationship or transition between two independent clauses.\nCommon conjunctive adverbs are:\nso, otherwise, also, consequently, for example, furthermore, however, in addition, in contrast,\nin fact, instead, likewise, moreover, nevertheless, otherwise, still, then, therefore\nConjunctive adverbs other than SO or OTHERWISE require either a period or semicolon\npreceding them and a comma following them. Once you understand these terms, you\u2019re\nready to look at punctuation formulas for using commas, semicolons, and colons.\nExample #1 The CEO will be attending the lecture; accordingly, the vice president will be\navailable for the luncheon at noon.\nThe two clauses are independent. The semicolon replaces a coordinating conjunction and\nindicates that the two clauses are independent.\nExample #2 Jaime wanted to see \"Billy Madison\"; however, Nick wanted to see \"Happy\nGilmore.\"\nThe two clauses are independent. The semicolon replaces a coordinating conjunction and\nindicates that the two clauses are independent.\n236 What's With All the Jargon?\nCategory:Rhetoric and Composition1\n42.3.2 Uses of \"That\"\nThat in the English language serves five different syntactic functions. They are:\n1. Demonstrative determiner\nexample: That house\n2. Demonstrative pronoun\nexample:That is my car\n3. Functions as a noun\nexample: That works for me.\n4. Complementizer\nexample: I know that she was waiting for me\n5. Relative pronoun\nexample: The book that I read was interesting\n1 http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Category%3ARhetoric%20and%20Composition\n237  43 Commas\n43.1 What Do Commas Do?\nAs you can see in the list below, commas serve several different purposes. For now, don\u2019t\nworry about any unfamiliar terms; simply observe the main actions commas do: join,\nemphasize, contain, and separate.\n1. Theyworkwith acoordinating conjunctiontojoin two independent clauseswithin\na sentence.\n2. They emphasize introductory elements at the beginning of a sentence or clause.\n3. They set off cumulative elements at the end of a sentence or clause.\n4. They separate a dependent clause at the beginning of a sentence from the\nindependent clause following it.\n5. They work in pairs to contain restrictive modifiers within a sentence.\n6. They work in pairs to contain parenthetical expressions within a sentence.\n7. They separate two or more adjectives that independently describe the same noun.\n8. They separate quotations from their attributions.\n9. They separate items in a list.\n10. They separate elements in dates, numbers, personal titles, and addresses.\nWhile there are many different ways to use commas in writing, most comma usages fall\ninto three situations. If you know the basic rule for these three cases, you should be set for\ncomma usage.\n1. Put a comma before a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so)\nthat separates two independent clauses. Example: I wanted to drive to the mall, but\nmy car wouldn't start.\n2. Put a comma after introductory words, phrases, or clauses in a sentence. Example:\nAlthough it was a good offer, I felt that I needed to explore other options.\n3. Use commas to set off elements that interrupt or add information in a sentence.\nExample: Tommy, my older brother, loved to punch me for telling his secrets.\n43.2 Commas with two independent clauses\nUsed with coordinating conjunctions, commas allow writers to let readers know how their\ncomplete thoughts (as expressed in independent clauses) relate to one another. After all,\nour thoughts build on each other and interact with each other. Unless we\u2019re merely listing\nthings or free-associating, our thoughts rarely develop in separate \u201cboxes,\u201d but rather tend\nmore to develop in relationship with one another.\n239 Commas\nWhen it\u2019s time to put those thoughts into written text, commas used with coordinating\nconjunctions help us indicate the relationships among our thoughts. They help us avoid the\nchoppy, flat style that comes from every thought becoming a separate separate sentence,\nwalled off from other sentences with the finality of a period:\nExample of periodic text: Building consensus ends with synthesis. It begins with analysis.\nOf course, the ultimate goal is finding commonality. The final product is a single course of\naction. However, a consensus derives validity only from agreement among the many. The\nfirst step in reaching consensus is to survey the different viewpoints involved.\nIf we add commas with coordinating conjunctions to this group of sentences, our reader will\nbe able to see more clearly the relationships that exist among the complete thoughts:\nThe same text with commas and coordinating conjunctions: Building consensus\nends with synthesis, but it begins with analysis. Of course, the ultimate goal is finding\ncommonality, and the final product is a single course of action. However, a consensus\nderives validity only from agreement among the many, so the first step in reaching consensus\nis to survey the different viewpoints involved.\n43.2.1 The formula\nUse a comma to join two independent clauses (IC) with a coordinating conjunction (CC).\nPlace the comma before the coordinating conjunction.\nIC, CC IC.\nCoordinating Conjunctions--For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet and So--are often referred to by\nthe mnemonic device used to memorize them: FANBOYS\n43.2.2 Errors\nA comma and a coordinating conjunction must appear together in order to have enough\n\u201cstrength\u201d to join two independent clauses. These errors happen when one or the other is\nmissing:\nTwo independent clauses joined by just a coordinating conjunction (no comma) or joined\nby nothing at all -- they just collide -- is called a run-on sentence or sometimes a fused\nsentence.\nExamples of run-on or fused sentences:\n\u2022 Several environmental organizations recognized the treaty but few endorsed it.\n\u2022 Internet communities redefine the notion of space they take the concept beyond physical\ndimensions.\nTwo independent clauses joined by just a comma (no coordinating conjunction) is called a\ncomma splice.\nExample of a comma splice: Economists predicted lower personal debt loads resulting\nfrom tax cuts, this did not happen.\n240 Commas with introductory words and phrases\n43.3 Commas with introductory words and phrases\nAnother relationship between thoughts we signal to our readers is that of introduction.\nWe often want to give our readers some background before laying out our main thought,\nor we want to give some information first that limits or otherwise modifies the information\nin our main thought. Introductory elements can be one word or several so long as they do\nnot contain a finite verb. An introductory element that includes a finite verb is likely to\nbe a clause instead. Common ones are transition words and statements about time,\nplace, manner, or condition.\nUsing a comma after an introductory element requires your reader to pause, and so should\nonly be done with good reason.\n43.3.1 Introductory Words\nIntroductory words are set off with a comma when the introductory word is a participle,\nmodifies the entire clause following it, or when not including it might lead to misreading.\nExamples of sentences with introductory words:\n\u2022 Humiliated, she fled from the diner. (participle)\n\u2022 Moreover, several groups actively opposed the treaty. (modifies entire clause)\n\u2022 Inside, traders shouted orders out. (Inside Traders would be ambiguous)\n\u2022 Quickly tie your shoe (Quickly is a simple adverb, it only modifies tie.)\n43.3.2 Introductory Phrases\nIntroductory phrases are not set off with a comma without good reason. Phrases that\ncontain verbals, absolute phrases, long prepositional phrases, or compound prepositional\nphrase are set off. Short prepositional phrases are only set off for purposes of emphasis.\nPhrases that show inversion in sentence structure can also be followed by a comma.\nExamples of sentences with introductory phrases:\n\u2022 Calling in sick for work, Beth hoped her boss would not suspect anything. (Phrasecontains\na verbal)\n\u2022 The stock market falling in Tokyo, Alex called his stock broker. (Absolute phrase)\n\u2022 Beneaththeantiquewoodenfishingboat, barnacleshadgrownforyears. (Longintroductory\nphrase, but even here the comma is optional.)\n\u2022 Underneath the noses of her parents, Ruth had hoarded three kilograms of cocaine. (Com-\npound prepositional phrase)\n\u2022 In a cold sweat, Henry read the letter addressed to his wife. (emphasis)\n\u2022 Drunk and angry, Joel burst into the room. (inverted structure)\n\u2022 After school I went to my uncle's house. (short prepositional phrase)\n\u2022 Before the parade I want to eat pizza. (short prepositional phrase)\n\u2022 By the earthen hearth my mother read to me from the book of Acts. (short prepositional\nphrase)\n241 Commas\n43.4 Commas with cumulative clauses\nAnother type of relationship between ideas that we signal to readers with a comma is that\nof accumulation. Occurring at the end of a sentence, cumulative clauses hook up to a\nmain clause and add further information. Using cumulative clauses is a good way to avoid\nhaving to use two sentences when one will do.\nExamples of sentences with cumulative clauses:\n\u2022 Nine senators changed their vote, passing the bill into law.\n\u2022 Three years of above-average rainfall raised the water table, turning formerly usable fields\ninto wetlands.\n\u2022 Peers frequently reinforce the behavior, leading it to become an ingrained habit.\n43.5 Commas and dependent clauses\nRemember, when you read a dependent clause aloud, you or your listener has the feeling\nof \u201cWell...? What\u2019s next? Finish it up!\u201d A dependent clause is a group of words that can\u2019t\nstand on its own as a sentence because it does not express a complete thought. It leaves the\nlistener (and reader) hanging.\nExamples of dependent clauses:\n\u2022 although psychology and applied psychology are separate disciplines\n\u2022 when sanctions proved too difficult to enforce\n\u2022 because it was undated\nDependent clauses, as their name implies, \"depend\" on another clause to form a complete\nsentence. Dependent clauses must be paired with independent clauses.\n43.5.1 The formula\nWhen the dependent clause comes before the independent clause, use a comma after the\ndependent clause.\nDC, IC.\nWhen the dependent clause comes after the independent clause, just run right through\nwithout a comma.\nIC DC.\nExamples:\n\u2022 Although psychology and applied psychology are separate disciplines, they both are relatively\nrecent additions to the university.\n\u2022 The U.N. approved military action when sanctions proved too difficult to enforce.\n\u2022 Archaeologists used contextual clues to date the manuscript because it was undated.\n242 Commas and restrictive modifiers\n43.5.2 Errors\nAdisruptivecommaisoneusedbeforeadependentclausethatcomesaftertheindependent\nclause. Writers often make this mistake when the dependent clause begins with because.\nExamples of disruptive commas:\n\u2022 The future of print newspapers appears uncertain, due to rising production costs and the\nincreasing popularity of online news sources.\n\u2022 Some argue that print newspapers will never disappear, because of their many readers.\n43.6 Commas and restrictive modifiers\nYou know what it's like to talk to someone and add explanations as you go, even right in\nthe middle of your thoughts, to make sure your listener knows exactly which things you are\ntalking about? When those explanantions show up in a written sentence, they are called\nmodifiers. Modifiers can be nonrestrictive -- meaning that you can drop them out of a\nsentence and you won't change the meaning. Restrictive modifiers are ones whose meaning\nis essential to the overall meaning of the sentence; if you dropped a restrictive modifier, the\nmeaning of the sentence would change.\nUse a pair of commas to set off a nonrestrictive clause. Don't use commas\naround restrictive clauses.\nExamples:\n\u2022 The committee, headed by Dr. Suarez, met weekly to develop a budget.\nIn this sentence, the phrase \"headed by Dr. Suarez\" is nonessential to the meaning of the\nmain clause, which is that the committee met weekly. Presumably only one committee\nhas been under discussion in previous sentences. However, if the discussion is of several\ncommittees, and the writer wants to point out that it was that one specific committee\nheaded by Dr. Suarez that met weekly, the commas would be removed:\n\u2022 The committee headed by Dr. Suarez met weekly to develop a budget.\n\u2022 Employees who participate in the company's fitness classes pay a lower health insurance\npremium.\nHere, no commas are used, since it is not just any and all employees who pay a lower\nhealth premium, but only those who participate in the company's fitness program.\nNotice the difference in the next sentence, in which the nonrestrictive modifier adds\ninformation but wouldn't change the meaning if it was taken out:\n\u2022 Employees, who have access to the company's gym and fitness classes, are encouraged to\npractice preventive healthcare.\n43.7 Commas and parenthetical elements\nMuch like a nonrestrictive modifier, a parenthetical expression provides extra information or\ncommentary in the middle of a sentence. A parenthetical element, however, often sounds\n243 Commas\nmore obviously \"speech-like\" and interjectory. Use a pair of commas to set off a parenthetical\nelement.\nExamples:\n\u2022 The candidate, much to the committee's surprise, voluntarily revealed her positions on\nseveral key controversies.\n\u2022 The question has, incidentally, since become moot.\n43.8 Commas with multiple adjectives\nWhen you use more than one descriptive word (adjective) to describe something (a noun),\nask yourself whether the adjectives work independently to describe the noun, or if they build\non each other and work together to describe the noun.\nOne way to tell is to reverse the order of the adjectives. If you can reverse the order and the\nmeaning stays the same, the adjectives are working independently and should be separated\nby a comma. If you reverse the order and it doesn't make sense, the adjectives are working\ntogether and should not be separated by a comma.\nAnother test is to put \"and\" between the adjectives. If you can do that and retain the\nmeaning, the adjectives are working independently and need a comma between them. If\ninserting \"and\" between the adjectives changes the meaning, the adjectives are working\ntogether and shouldn't be separated from each other by a comma.\nIf multiple adjectives before a noun work independently, use a comma between\nthem. If they work together, don't.\nExamples of adjectives working independently:\n\u2022 An open, exploratory, and inclusive spirit marked the meeting.\nTest: An open and exploratory and inclusive spirit marked the meeting.\n\u2022 A direct, conversational tone made the instructions easy to understand.\nTest: A conversational, direct tone made the instructions easy to understand.\nExamples of adjectives working together:\n\u2022 Local health officials recently released guidelines for dealing with avian flu outbreaks.\nTest: Health local officials recently released guidelines for dealing with flu avian outbreaks.\nDo not use commas.\n\u2022 An extruded plastic stem keeps the component stable.\nTest: An extruded and plastic stem keeps the component stable. Do not use a comma.\n43.9 Commas with quotations\nUseacommatosetofftheattribution--thephrasethatsayswhosaidorwroteaquotation\n-- from the quotation itself. Notice that the comma goes inside the quotation marks, even if\nthe quotation is a complete sentence and would, if appearing on its own, take a period at\nthe end.\n244 Commas in a list\nExamples:\n\u2022 \"The ballot is stronger than the bullet,\" writes Abraham Lincoln.\n\u2022 \"Politics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it everywhere, diagnosing it incorrectly,\nand applying the wrong remedies,\" said Groucho Marx.\nUseapairofcommastosetofftheattributionwhenitappearsinthemiddleofthequotation.\nExample: \"In a time of universal deceit,\" writes George Orwell, \"telling the truth becomes\na revolutionary act.\"\nDo not replace a question mark or exclamation point in a quotation with a comma.\nExample: \"When will our consciences grow so tender that we will act to prevent human\nmisery rather than avenge it?\" writes Eleanor Roosevelt.\nDo not use a comma to set off quotations that occupy a subordinate position in a sentence,\noften signaled by the words that, which, or because.\nExamples:\n\u2022 Emphasizing the importance of staying in touch with the populace, James Madison wrote\nthat \"a popular government without popular information, or the means of acquiring it,\nis but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy, or both.\"\n\u2022 Participating in a democracy takes a strong stomach because \"it requires a certain relish\nfor confusion,\" writes Molly Ivins.\n43.10 Commas in a list\nUse commas between items in a list when there are three or more.\nThe final comma, the one before \"and\" or \"or\", is known as the Oxford comma, Harvard\ncomma or serial comma. The Oxford comma should always be used where it is needed to\navoid confusion (for example where one or more items in the list already include the word\n\"and\"). Otherwise it is optional. The Oxford comma is relatively uncommon in British\nEnglish, except where used to avoid confusion. Not using the Oxford comma is relatively\nuncommon in American English, except in newspapers and magazines.\nExamples:\n\u2022 Additional supplies required are a burner, beaker(,) and safety goggles.\n\u2022 The position requires expertise in building consensus, formulating policy(,) and developing\nlong-range goals.\n\u2022 The English-speaking countries include Dominica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica.\n43.11 Commas in dates, numbers, personal titles, and\naddresses\nUse commas to separate the day of the week from month and to set off a year from the rest\nof the sentence.\n245 Commas\nExamples:\n\u2022 On December 12, 1890, orders for the arrest of Sitting Bull were sent.\n\u2022 Graduation is set for May 20, 2006.\nYou do not need to use a comma when giving only the month and the year.\nExample: The next presidential election will take place in November 2008.\nUse commas to separate number into groups of three when they are more than four digits\nlong. The comma is optional when the number is four digits long.\nExamples:\n\u2022 2,400 (or 2400)\n\u2022 50,000\n\u2022 340,000\nDo not use a comma in street addresses or page numbers.\nExamples:\n\u2022 The table appears on page 1397.\n\u2022 The fire occurred at 5509 Avenida Valencia.\nWhen following a name with a title, use a comma (if the title is at the end of the sentence)\nor two (if the title is in the middle of the sentence) to separate the title from the rest of the\nsentence.\nExamples:\n\u2022 Paul Hjort, D.C., practices chiropractic medicine in central Minnesota.\n\u2022 Earnings far exceeded projections last quarter, according to Hitomi Masamura, Vice\nPresident for Operations.\nSeparate each element of an address is with commas. However, do not use a comma before\na ZIP or other postal code.\nExamples:\n\u2022 Bob Dole grew up in Hope, Kansas.\n\u2022 Write to the program advisor at 645 5th Street, Minerton, Indiana 55555.\nCommas1\n1 http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Category%3ARhetoric%20and%20Composition\n246 44 Semicolons\n44.1 Use\nA semicolon introduces a pause greater than that of a comma but less than that of a period.\nTo Clarify a Series\nSemicolons separate elements of a series when the items are long or when individual\nsegments contain material that also must be set off by commas.\n\u2022 Example: She leaves a son, Mike Nach, of Arizona; a daughter, Emily Rosa, of Colorado;\nand a sister, Sara Evans, of Minnesota.\nTo Link Independent Clauses\nA semicolon joins two independent clauses1 within one a sentence without the use of a\ncoordinating conjunction.\n\u2022 Example: The horse was due for an immunization; the veterinarian administered one\ntoday.\nTo Set Off a Conjunctive Adverb\nSemicolons are used, along with a comma, to set off conjunctive adverbs. A conjunctive\nadverb is a modifier2 that describes a relationship between ideas in two clauses. Some\ncommon conjunctive adverbs are \"however,\" \"indeed,\" \"consequently,\" etc.\n\u2022 Example: I like pepperoni; however, today I ordered Canadian bacon on my pizza.\nPlacement with Quotes\nSemicolons should always appear outside quotation marks.\n\u2022 Example: Marcus often says that \"people should remain true to their faith\"; however, he\nis not a man of faith.\n44.2 Common Misuses\nSome examples of improper use of the semicolon:\n\u2022 Between a subordinate clause and the rest of the sentence.

(The apartment belongs\nto both Anthony and George.)\nIf the compound noun indicates individual possession, add the apostrophe to both nouns.\nExample: Mary's and Brian's sense of style was quite different. (Mary and Brian have\nindividual senses of style.)\nCompound Nouns\nIf a compound noun uses dashes, place the apostrophe after the last nouns.\nExample: My brother-in-law's house\n46.2 Common Misuses\n\u2022 Do not use apostrophes in nouns that are not possessive. Example: Some parent's are\nmore strict than mine. (Apostrophe is not necessary)\n\u2022 Do not use an apostrophe in possessive pronouns such as its, whose, his, hers, ours, yours,\nand theirs.\nCategory:Rhetoric and Composition1\n1 http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Category%3ARhetoric%20and%20Composition\n251  47 Quotation Marks\n47.1 Use\nQuotation marks are used to mark direct quotations. This is to give the original writer or\nspeaker credit for their work. If you are paraphrasing, you do not need quotation marks.\n\u2022 If you are using a long quotation (long is constituted by 4 or more typed lines), instead of\nquotation marks, you should indent the quotation. If the quote is two or more paragraphs,\nindent the first line of the paragraphs an additional five spaces (plus the indent of the\nrest of the quote). When indenting to quote, you do not need to use quotation marks.\n\u2022 If your quote has a quote within it, the inner quote needs one quotation mark and the\nouter quote needs two quotation marks.\n\u2022 Use quotation marks around the titles of short works such as newspapers and magazine\narticles, poems, short stories, songs and chapters.\n\u2022 Periods and commas should be placed inside the quotation marks. Colons and semicolons\nshould be placed outside the quotation marks. Question marks and exclamation points\nshould be placed inside the quotation marks, unless the punctuation applies to the whole\nsentence (not just the quote).\n\u2022 You can set off words by using quotation marks instead of italicizing or underlining them.\n47.2 Using quoted material within your own writing\n\u2022 If a quotation is introduced formally, use a colon.\n\u2022 If a quotation is being used with \"he said\" or \"she said,\" use a comma.\n\u2022 If a quotation is blended into the writer's sentence, you can use a comma, although no\npunctuation may be more appropriate.\n\u2022 If a quotation is used at the beginning of a sentence, use a comma after the quote unless\nthe quote ends in a question mark or exclamation point.\n\u2022 If you choose to break up the quotation with your own words, use commas to offset the\nquotation from your explanation.\nCategory:Rhetoric and Composition1\n1 http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Category%3ARhetoric%20and%20Composition\n253  48 Hyphens and Dashes\nDashes (\"\u2014\", \"\u2013\") are used to mark an interruption within a sentence, while hyphens (\"-\")\nare used to join two parts of a compound word, or to indicate that a word has been split at\nthe end of a line. A dash is approximately as long as two hyphens.\n48.1 Dash\nDashes are minus-shaped characters used to mark an interruption within a sentence. They\nare used in much the same way as parentheses.\nThere are two kinds of dashes: em dashes looking like \"\u2014\", and shorter en dashes looking\nlike \"\u2013\". It is usual to either use em dashes without spacing, or en dashes with spacing, but\nnot em dashes with spacing, as shown in the following two examples:\nExample: Threeunlikelycompanions\u2014acanary,aneagle,andaparrot\u2014flewbymywindow\nin an odd flock.\nExample: Three unlikely companions \u2013 a canary, an eagle, and a parrot \u2013 flew by my\nwindow in an odd flock.\nIn most word processors, there is a keystroke combination that will produce an em-dash:\n\u2022 Windows: em-dash: Alt-0151.\n\u2022 Windows: en-dash: Alt-0150.\n\u2022 Mac: em-dash: shift-option-dash.\n48.2 Hyphen\nA hyphen joins two parts of a compound word.\nExample: governor-elect, twenty-five, half-baked.\nHyphens can also be used to make compound words more understandable. Consider these\nwords:\n\u2022 Man-eating dog\n\u2022 Man eating dog\nThe first example describes a particular type of dog (man-eating). The second example,\nalas, suggests that a man is eating a dog.\nOr consider the case of the flaming-red pickup truck, as opposed to its more alarming cousin,\nthe flaming red pickup truck.\n255 Hyphens and Dashes\nIn general, if the first of two adjectives is describing the second, and not the noun following,\nyou should use a hyphen: deep-blue water, good-tasting hamburger, happy-faced child.\n48.3 Width Difference\nThe em dash is roughly as wide as two hyphens. In the days of typewriters, it was actually\nwritten as two hyphens. An en dash is shorter than em dash while wider than a hyphen.\nCategory:Rhetoric and Composition1\n1 http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Category%3ARhetoric%20and%20Composition\n256 49 Parentheses\n49.1 What Do Parentheses Do?\nParentheses can be used to enclose an interjected, explanatory, or qualifying remark, math-\nematical quantities, etc. The words placed inside the brackets are not necessary for the\ninterrupted sentence to be complete.\nSetting off incidental\/accompanying information\nExamples:\n1.

That\u2019s\nbecause, for the most part, writers don\u2019t make every mistake. Instead, we tend to make\na few of the same mistakes multiple times, such as always missing the comma after an\nintroductory clause, or forgetting to match up our nouns and pronouns in the right way.\nThis means that you don\u2019t have to worry about learning every grammar and punctuation\nrule; chances are, you follow most of them already.\nFollowing patterns allows you then to focus only on the mistakes you make habitually \u2014\nand often a writing instructor or writing center tutor can help you identify what those are.\nOnce you know what they are, it\u2019s a matter of making sure you understand how to find\nthose errors when editing your own writing and how to correct them.\n\"It is perfectly okay to write garbage \u2014 as long as you edit brilliantly.\"\nC.J. Cherryh, science fiction and fantasy writer\nDon\u2019t worry about having to memorize the grammar and punctuation rules you need to\nimplement or learning them so deeply that you\u2019ll never again make certain errors.

The following examples of common homonym\nmistakes prove that spell-check can only go so far in helping to error proof your document.\nRemember that two words that sound the same don't always have the same meaning. If\nyou are ever in doubt which one to use, check your dictionary.\n53.0.1 Affect, Effect\n\u2022 Affectismostcommonlyaverb, usuallymeaning'influence'. (Aneasywaytoremember\nthis is that 'affect' starts with an \"a\", as does 'action'.) As a noun, it is a psychological\nterm for emotion.\n\u2022 Effect is most common as a noun meaning 'result'. 'Effect' used as a verb means 'bring\nabout' some kind of change.\n\u2022 Example: The game affected the standings. Its effect was overwhelming. It\neffected a change in the affect of the winning team's captain.\n53.0.2 Afterward, Afterwards, Afterword\n\u2022 Afterward and afterwards are synonymous adverbs meaning that an event occurs\nlater than another.\n\u2022 An afterword is an epilogue.\n53.0.3 Aid, Aide\n\u2022 Aid is a noun meaning 'assistance' or a verb meaning 'assist'.\n\u2022 An aide is a person who serves or offers assistance.\n\u2022 Example: \"The aide will aid the victim.\"\n53.0.4 It's, Its\n\u2022 It's is a contraction, short for either It is or It has.\n\u2022 Its is the possessive form of it. This usually means that the following noun phrase\nbelongs to 'it'. It is important to recognise that 'its' the possessive form does not have\nan apostrophe - it is in the same category as 'his'.\n\u2022 Example: \"It's (It is) my dog.\" \"The computer crashed a few minutes ago, and it's\n(it has) done it again!\" \"What is its name?\"\n265 Homonyms\n53.0.5 Lay, Lie\n\u2022 Lay is the action word.\n\u2022 Lie is the state of being or a telling someone something untruthful on purpose.\n\u2022 Example: \"I will lay the book on the desk.\"\n\u2022 Example: \"I plan to lie in bed most of Saturday.\"\n\u2022 Example: \"Jim will probably lie to get out of being punished for breaking the\nwindow.\"\n53.0.6 To, Too, Two\nFiguring out which of these three forms have stumped more than one person! You can find\na quick way to tell them apart below:\n\u2022 To is generally used to describe a relationship between things. It is also used as an\ninfinitive verb, as in \"I love to eat.\"\n\u2022 Example: \"Matt is going to the doctor.\" \"This gift is to you.\" \"It is ten minutes to\nseven.\"\n\u2022 Too is usually used when you are describing an excess or is used when noting something\nis in addition\n\u2022 Example: \"I usually eat too much on Thanksgiving.\" or \"Joe cleaned the house,\nwashed the car, and mowed the lawn, too.\n\u2022 Two is the word you use for the number 2.\n\u2022 Example: \"You have two minutes left before class starts.\"\n53.0.7 Then, Than\n\u2022 Then indicates time.\n\u2022 Example: \"First we went to dinner, and then we went to the show.\"\n\u2022 Than is comparative.\n\u2022 Example: \"I would rather see the comedy than see the horror movie.\"\n53.0.8 Versus, Verses\n\u2022 Versus indicates opposition.\n\u2022 Verses is the plural of verse, as related to poetry.\nCategory:Rhetoric and Composition1\n1 http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Category%3ARhetoric%20and%20Composition\n266 54 Lack of agreement between subject\nand verb\nSubject agreement is that the agreement of subjects and verbs\n54.1 Examples\n\u2022 Singular: The whale, which doesn\u2019t mature sexually until six or seven years old and\nwhich has only one calf per year, is at risk for extinction because it reproduces so slowly.\n\u2022 Plural: During election season, several civic groups sponsorpublic debates in\nwhich candidates presenttheir views and audience members askquestions.\n\u2022 Singular: Digginga few inches into the dunes, even at 750 feet above the valley floor,\nreveals wet sand.\n\u2022 Plural: The dunes comprise small rocks and dry, sandy soil that constantly form\nstrange designs under the ever-present wind.\n54.2 What is subject-verb agreement?\nSubject-verb agreement is something most native speakers know pretty automatically, but\nwe can make mistakes when writing, especially when several words separate a particular\nsubject and verb. As you can see in the following examples, \u201cof\u201d phrases can be misleading,\ntoo. The trick is to find the \u201croot\u201d noun: the one actually performing the action of the\nverb. There are two easy ways to spot the subject of a sentence: 1) Find the verb and ask\nthe question, \"Who or what is performing this act?\" 2) Cross out all prepositional phrases.\nThese simply tasks should lead you right to the subject of the sentence.\n54.3 Examples\n\u2022 Characteristicsof the middle child often include an equitable temperament and high\nfeelings of security and self-esteem.\n\u2022 The opportunity cost of loaning out the funds is usually reflected in the interest rate.\n\u2022 A certain percentage of the cars produced by major manufacturers meets stricter\nemission standards in order for the company to sell their products in regulated regions.\n267 Lack of agreement between subject and verb\n54.4 Other guidelines\nOther guidelines for making subjects and verbs agree include:\n\u2022 Noncount nouns \u2014 those that don\u2019t have a singular or plural form, such as furniture,\nbaggage, poetry, melancholy \u2014 take a singular verb.\n\u2022 Two or more singular nouns joined by an \u201cand\u201d take a plural verb: A timely, relevant\ntopic and an environment of trust produce a good class discussion.\n\u2022 When two nouns differing in number are joined by \u201cor,\u201d the verb should take the form\nof the noun closest to it: Most viewers of the painting assume that either the monkey\u2019s\nantics or the handler\u2019s chagrin causes the young men\u2019s laughter.\nIf you struggle with problems in subject-verb agreement, leave time to edit your paper once\nthrough just for that error: go through each sentence, underlining each subject and verb\npair and checking that they agree.\nCategory:Rhetoric and Composition1\n1 http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Category%3ARhetoric%20and%20Composition\n268 55 Lack of agreement between noun and\npronoun\n55.1 Rules\nPronouns (words such as it, her, them, this, someone, who, him, they, themselves, herself,\netc.) replace specific nouns (persons, places, or things) so you don't have to keep repeating\nthem. Like subjects and verbs, pronouns and nouns need to agree in \"number\": in whether\nthey are singular or plural. They also need to agree in gender: masculine, feminine, or\ninclusive (both).\nErrors in noun-pronoun agreement usually simply result from writing quickly and not editing\nclosely enough. Three specific instances, though, can cause problems:\n1. The nouns each, and one are all singular and take singular pronouns; either or neither\nis singular unless it specifically refers to plural alternatives.\n2. When using singular nouns that refer to both sexes or for which the gender is not\nknown, use both masculine and feminine pronouns together (him or her, he or she,\nhimself or herself, his or her)orrewritethesentencetomakethenounandthepronoun\nboth plural. (If all of the members of a group are of one gender, it is acceptable to use\nthe male or female pronoun, as in \"Each member of the football team will take his\ngear onto the bus.\")\n3. Some nouns can be either singular or plural: audience, group, team, unit, class, and\nothers. Use a singular pronoun if the group is acting as a unit, as in \"The audience\nexpressed its appreciation with loud applause.\" Use a plural pronoun if the group\nis acting as individual members, as in \"The team went their separate ways, some\nshowering, some leaving the stadium, some drinking champagne, and some going home\nto sleep.\" [In the second example, it's a good idea to write \"team members\" to be\nclear.]\n4. The words \"They\" and \"Their\" are third-person plural personal pronouns in Modern\nEnglish. The \"singular\" they and their is used as a gender-neutral singular rather than\nas a plural pronoun, but the correctness of this usage is disputed.\n55.2 Examples\n\u2022 Every one of the studies indicated their its methodology.\n\u2022 Neither Jackson nor Juarez believed they he had been represented unfairly.\n\u2022 Each researcher included a control group with their his his or her test group.\n\u2022 By 1999, the lacrosse team had outgrown their its space.\n\u2022 Neither a crocodile nor a lion are is a suitable pet.\n269 Lack of agreement between noun and pronoun\n\u2022 Either Ed or Bill are is a plumber.\nBut --\n\u2022 Neither crocodiles nor lions is are suitable pets.\n\u2022 Either Ed and Bill or Ted and Jeff is are plumbers.\nCategory:Rhetoric and Composition1\n1 http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Category%3ARhetoric%20and%20Composition\n270 56 Missing comma after introductory\nelement\nWhen you begin a sentence with a word or group of words that provides some background,\nintroductory, or otherwise preliminary information, put a comma between this word or\nphrase and the rest of your sentence. The comma here tells your reader to pause, take the\nbackground information into consideration, and get ready to move on to the main part of\nthe sentence.\nTo help you recognize places in your sentences where you are missing commas after intro-\nductory clauses, read your writing out loud. Chances are good you'll naturally pause after\nintroductory phrases. You can also check the beginning of each sentence to look for words\nor phrases that add information about time, place, or manner or for words that serve as\ntransitions; these are all common introductory elements.\nEXAMPLES\nIncorrect: Before the budget passed several lawmakers filibustered to stop it.\nCorrect: Before the budget passed, several lawmakers filibustered to stop it.\nIncorrect: However supporters saw the legislation through.\nCorrect: However, supporters saw the legislation through.\nLearn more under \"Commas after introductory elements\" here.1\nCategory:Rhetoric and Composition2\n1 Chapter 43 on page 239\n2 http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Category%3ARhetoric%20and%20Composition\n271  57 Sentence fragment\nSentence fragments.

That\u2019s why mastering the apostrophes' uses can really bolster your\ncredibility in writing: so many people get them wrong!\nThe main thing to know is that apostrophes\u2019 primary jobs are to form possessives\nand to stand in for missing letters in a contraction. Apostrophes are only very\nrarely used to form plurals.\nYou use possessive forms when you want to indicate ownership, or \u201cbelonging to.\u201d Posses-\nsives are almost always formed by adding an apostrophe and an \u201cs\u201d to the end\nof a noun (a person, place, or thing). In contrast, plurals are usually formed by\nadding an \u201cs\u201d or \u201ces\u201d to the end of a noun without an apostrophe.\nEXAMPLES\nPossessives use apostrophes.\nThe amendment\u2019s language clarifies the terms left undefined in the original law. \u201clan-\nguage\u201d belongs to \u201camendment\u201d; \u201cterms\u201d is plural\nA review of the month\u2019s headlines reveals nine front-page pieces about the local school board\nelection. \u201cheadlines\u201d belongs to \u201cmonth\u201d; \u201cheadlines\u201d and \u201cpieces\u201d are plural\nSara Jones\u2019 study of language use and class is considered a classic in the field. \u201cstudy\u201d\nbelongs to \u201cJones\u201d; the apostrophe moves to the end because the noun ends in\n\u201cs\u201d\nPlurals do not take apostrophes.\nThree key ideas emerged in the introduction.\nThe organization was restructured after decades of poor performance.\nAll animals have an innate evolutionary drive to pass along genes to offspring.\n275 Missing or misplaced apostrophe\nBut plurals that are also possessive do use apostrophes.

Necessary tense shifts simply make it clear to your reader when actions have\ntaken, are taking, or will take place. When you \u201cshift tense unnecessarily,\u201d however, it means\nyou change the times when actions are taking place within a chunk of text in a way that\ndoesn\u2019t seem to make sense. Notice how the tense changes cause confusion in the following\nexamples.\n59.2 Examples of confusing tense shifts\n\u2022 In February 2003, the Sefton City Council passed an ordinance that limited the number\nof dogs city residents could keep on their property to three. Several residents objected\nand formally petitioned the council to repeal the ordinance, but the council upheld\nit. Their reasoning is that having more than three dogs creates potentially dangerous\nsituations. In November 2004, however, changes in the Council\u2019s membership resulted\nin the ordinance being repealed.\n\u2022 While St. Cloud struggles with keeping rental housing from dominating the housing\nmarket, other communities in central Minnesota undertook several initiatives to build\nmore apartments and condominiums.\nThe best way to find unnecessary tense shifts is to read a piece of writing through one time\njust looking for tense and asking yourself whether each verb tense accurately reflects the\ntime period it took place, takes place, or will take place in. Start by using a highlighter to\nmark each verb, and then ask yourself if the \u201ctime\u201d is correct for each one.\nThe correction:\n\u2022 In February 2003, the Sefton City Council passed an ordinance that limited the number\nof dogs city residents could keep on their property to three. Several residents objected\nand formally petitioned the council to repeal the ordinance, but the council upheld it.\nTheir reasoning was that having more than three dogs creates potentially dangerous\nsituations. In November 2004, however, changes in the Council\u2019s membership resulted\nin the ordinance being repealed.\n(No reason exists to believe that those who then thought that three or more dogs in a\nhousehold created a dangerous situation have changed their minds or that dogs' behavior in\na group of three or more has changed. The composition of the council had changed, and the\ncomposition of the city council having changed, the city council voted differently).\n277 Unnecessary tense shift\n\u2022 While St. Cloud struggled with keeping rental housing from dominating the housing\nmarket, other communities in central Minnesota undertook several initiatives to build\nmore apartments and condominiums.\nif referring to a situation in the past -- or --\n\u2022 While St. Cloud struggles with keeping rental housing from dominating the housing\nmarket, other communities in central Minnesota undertake several initiatives to build\nmore apartments and condominiums.\nif referring to a current situation.\nCategory:Rhetoric and Composition1\n1 http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Category%3ARhetoric%20and%20Composition\n278 60 Run-on sentence\n60.1 What is a run-on sentence?\nWhile a run-on sentence, also known as a fused sentence, might just seem to be the type of\nsentence that goes on and on without a clear point, the technical grammatical definition\nof a run-on sentence is one that fuses, or \"runs together,\" two or more independent clauses\n(basically, clauses that express a complete thought and could stand on their own as full\nsentences) without punctuation to separate them. They may have nothing between them, or\nthey may have a coordinating conjunction (and, or, nor, but, for, so yet) between them but\nnot the comma that needs to accompany the coordinating conjunction when separating two\nindependent clauses.\nYou can often find run-on sentences in your work by reading it aloud. The run-on sentences\nwill trip you up: you'll want to pause or otherwise come to some sort of end when you hit\nthe end of an independent clause, but a run-on, with its lack of punctuation, doesn't signal\nyou to do that. Try reading the following examples of run-on sentences out loud, and notice\nwhere two clauses seem to collide:\n60.2 Examples of run-on sentences\n\u2022 Every day, millions of children go to daycare with millions of other kids there is no\nguarantee that none of them are harboring infectious conditions.\n\u2022 Many daycare centers have strict rules about sick children needing to stay away until they\nare no longer infectious but enforcing those rules can be very difficult.\n\u2022 Daycare providers often undergo extreme pressure to accept a sick child \"just this once\"\nthe parent has no other care options and cannot miss work.\n60.3 Fixing run-on sentences\nOnce you find a run-on sentence and notice where the two independent clauses \"collide,\"\nyou can then decide on how best to separate the clauses:\n\u2022 You can make two complete sentences by inserting a period; this is the strongest level of\nseparation.\n\u2022 You can use a semicolon between the two clauses if they are of equal importance, and\nyou want your reader to consider the points together.\n\u2022 You can use a semicolon with a transition word to indicate a specific relation between\nthe two clauses.\n279 Run-on sentence\n\u2022 You can use a coordinating conjunction and a comma, also to indicate a relationship.\n\u2022 Or, you can add a word to one clause to make it dependent.\n60.4 Examples of fixed run-on sentences\nNotice how the sentences above have been punctuated in the following examples.\n\u2022 Every day, millions of children go to daycare with millions of other kids. There is no\nguarantee that none of them are harboring infectious conditions.\n\u2022 Many daycare centers have strict rules about sick children needing to stay away until they\nare no longer infectious; however, enforcing those rules can be very difficult.\n\u2022 Many daycare centers have strict rules about sick children needing to stay away until they\nare no longer infectious, but enforcing those rules can be very difficult.\n\u2022 Daycare providers often undergo extreme pressure to accept a sick child \"just this once\"\nbecause the parent has no other care options and cannot miss work.\nLearn more under \"commas with two independent clauses\" here.1\nCategory:Rhetoric and Composition2\n1 Chapter 43 on page 239\n2 http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Category%3ARhetoric%20and%20Composition\n280 61 Disruptive comma\nDisruptive commas are simply those that aren't needed -- those that \"disrupt\" the flow of\nthe sentence.

In the following example, notice how three choppy\nsentences condense into one smoother sentence with the use of such an opening phrase,\nwhich is called a modifier:\n\u2022 Original: The Student Council exists to represent students to the faculty and adminis-\ntration. It also oversees student organizations. The Student Council plays an important\nrole in campus life.\n\u2022 Rewrite: Responsible for representing students to the faculty and administration and\noverseeing student organizations, the Student Council plays an important role in campus\nlife.\nHere are some other examples of sentences that begin with a phrase providing this sort of\nadditional information:\n\u2022 An example of bottom of the pyramid targeting, microcredit ventures lend small amounts\nof money to those with minimal assets.\n\u2022 Found in tropical southern Asia, the Asian Koel belongs to the cuckoo order of birds.\n\u2022 After completing the experiment, the most bacteria appeared in the scraping taken from\nthe drinking fountain.\nNotice something odd about the last one? The modifier -- \"After completing the experiment\"\n-- doesn't match what follows it: The bacteria didn't complete the experiment (presumably, a\nresearcher did)! The rule for using modifiers at the beginning of a sentence is that the thing\nbeing modified must immediately follow the modifier. Sometimes this requires you\nto rearrange the sentence; other times you have to \"spell out\" what is being modified if you\ndidn't include it.\n62.1.1 Examples\n\u2022 Dangling modifier: Covering most of Minnesota, the illustration showed the glacier\nthat left the state with its thousands of lakes.\n\u2022 Corrected: Covering most of Minnesota, the glacier left the state with its thousands of\nlakes, as depicted on the illustration.\n\u2022 Dangling modifier: Trekking across the desert, fierce winds swirled around the riders.\n\u2022 Corrected: Trekking across the desert, the riders were assaulted by fierce winds.\n\u2022 Dangling modifier: First coined in 1980, historian Linda Kerber used the term \"repub-\nlican motherhood\" to describe a phenomenon occurring after the Revolutionary War in\n283 Dangling modifier\nwhich women were encouraged to promote the ideals of liberty and democracy to their\nchildren.\n\u2022 Corrected: First coined in 1980, the term \"republican motherhood\" was used by historian\nLinda Kerber to describe a phenomenon occurring after the Revolutionary War in which\nwomen were encouraged to promote the ideals of liberty and democracy to their children.\n62.2 What Is a Misplaced Modifier?\nWhereas a dangling modifier is \"left hanging,\" so to speak, with its referent missing in action,\na misplaced modifier's referent is present and accounted for, but as its name implies, the\nmodifier itself is out of place within the sentence, such that it seems to modify another\nreferent in the sentence, resulting in ambiguity or confusion.\n62.2.1 Examples\n\u2022 Misplaced: Erik couldn't ride his bicycle with a broken leg.\n\u2022 Misplaced: The little girl walked the dog wearing a tutu.\n\u2022 Misplaced: Just don't stand there.\n\u2022 Correct: With his broken leg, Erik couldn't ride his bicycle\n\u2022 Correct: Still wearing a tutu, the little girl walked the dog.\n\u2022 Correct: Don't just stand there.\n62.3 What Is a Squinting Modifier?\nUnlike a dangling modifier or a misplaced modifier, a squinting modifier is placed right next\nto the word it refers to, but it is also near another word that it might be modifying, which\ncan cause confusion.\n62.3.1 Examples\n\u2022 Squinting: Cycling uphill quickly strengthens the leg muscles.\n\u2022 Correct: Quickly cycling uphill strengthens the leg muscles.\nOr\n\u2022 Correct: Cycling uphill can quickly strengthen the leg muscles.\n\u2022 Squinting: Using modifiers clearly will improve your writing.\n\u2022 Correct: Clearly using modifiers will improve your writing.\nOr\n\u2022 Correct: Using modifiers will clearly improve your writing.\n284 What Is a Squinting Modifier?\nCategory:Rhetoric and Composition1\n1 http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Category%3ARhetoric%20and%20Composition\n285  63\nCiting Sources\n287  64 Citation\n64.1 Overview\nCitations\n\u2022 Purpose\n\u2022 Avoid plagiarism\n\u2022 Enable verification\n\u2022 Location\n\u2022 In-text or parenthetical\n\u2022 Bibliography\n\u2022 Style\n\u2022 MLA\n\u2022 Title for bibliography: Works Cited\n\u2022 In-text \u2013 example: (Goodview 98)\n\u2022 APA\n\u2022 Title for bibliography: References\n\u2022 In-text \u2013 example: (Goodview, 1998, p. 98)\nAny time you use in your paper information that you paraphrase, summarize, or quote from\nanother source, you must give the author or the publication proper credit.

To be fair and ethical,\nyou must acknowledge your debt to the writers of those sources. If you don't, you are guilty\nof plagiarism, a serious academic offense. Three different acts are considered plagiarism:\n\u2022 failing to cite quotations and borrowed ideas,\n\u2022 failing to enclose borrowed language in quotation marks, and\n\u2022 failing to put summaries and paraphrases in your own words.\nIf you wrote something in your paper such as this:\nWhen writing a research paper it is important to acknowledge your debt to the writers of\nthose sources. It is a collaboration between you and your sources. Failure to not acknowledge\nyour sources is an act of plagiarism.\nand did not put any reference to Hacker, it would be plagiarism. A proper way to use the\nwork would be this:\n1 Johnson-Sheehan, Richard and Charles Paine. Writing Today. Custom Edition for St. Cloud State\nUniversity. Boston: Pearson Education, 2013.\n2 Hacker, Diana. A Pocket Style Manual. New York: Bedford\/St. Martin's, 2004. 115.\n301 Plagiarism\nDiana Hacker stresses how important it is \"to acknowledge your debt to the writers\" of\nsources you use in your writing. She states that your paper \"is a collaboration between\nyou and your sources\". \"failure to not acknowledge your sources is an act of plagiarism\"\n(Hacker 115).\nIt is also important to not only cite your sources in your work but also include a detailed\nreference to the work at the end of your paper on the works cited page. An example for the\nprevious source is below:\nHacker, Diana. A Pocket Style Manual. New York: Bedford\/St. Martin's, 2004.\n65.3 Rules to Help You Avoid Plagiarism\nThe following rules are taken from Rosen, Leonard. The Academic Writer's Handbook:\nInstructor's Copy. 2006, pages 122\u2013124.\n\u2022 When quoting another writer, use quotation marks and give credit.\n\u2022 When restating the ideas of others in your words, give credit.\n\u2022 Avoid using words, phrases, or sentence structures from the original source.\nCategory:Rhetoric and Composition3\n65.4 Patchwriting\n4\nPatchwriting means taking another person's words and sentences and reworking them,\nchanging words or phrases here and there, to make it appear that the writing is your\nown. Patchwriting is academically dishonest and should not be done. Sometimes, students\npatchwrite even if they don't mean to. But whether it was intentional or not, the offense is\nstill an offense. It's important to summarize and paraphrase carefully to avoid patchwriting\nand plagiarism.\n65.5 References\n3 http:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/Category%3ARhetoric%20and%20Composition\n4 Johnson-Sheehan, Richard and Charles Paine.
