Home Subjects\nBoundless Management\nCommunication\nImproving Communication Effectiveness\nLearning to Speak\nSending effective communication requires skill and an understanding of the audience.\nLearning Objectives\nExplain the difficulty of sending communications, with a particular focus on improving and enhancing's one's ability to communicate\naccurately and concisely\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nThe ability to communicate clearly in speaking and in writing is one of the most valuable professional skills.\nCommunicating effectively relies on credibility, which is undermined by grammar and spelling mistakes, incompleteness, and errors in\nlogic.\nWhen sending a message, the communicator must keep in mind the target audience.\nKey Terms\nclarity: The state, or measure of being clear, either in appearance, thought or style; lucidity.\nbrevity: The quality of being brief in duration.\nThe ability to communicate effectively in speech and in writing is one of the most valuable professional skills. Sending messages and\ninformation so they are understood as intended and produce the desired effect demands certain technical competencies and\ninterpersonal capabilities. Fortunately, these can be learned and honed through practice.\nCommunicating effectively relies on credibility. Mistakes in grammar and spelling, incompleteness, and errors in logic can have a negative\nimpact on the audience's perception of the sender's credibility. As a result, the communicator's ability to persuade or otherwise influence\nthe recipient is diminished. Effective ways to learn precise, professional oral and written communication skills include:\nhaving others, such as a supervisor, provide feedback on strengths and weaknesses as a communicator.\nanalyzing the strengths and techniques of excellent communicators.\nimitating strong communicators.\nCommunicating in the Workplace\nWhen sending a message, communicators must think of the target audience, being sure to use terms and phrases that readers or listeners\nwill understand. For example, texts or e-mails should avoid using abbreviations that the receiver may not recognize. To respect others'\ntime, communication should aim for brevity and concision without sacrificing clarity and completeness. Using e-mail effectively poses\nparticular challenges. Often, messages are poorly structured, missing specific subject lines, slow in getting to the point, or too long to\nwarrant being read in their entirety.\nIt can be challenging to strike the right tone or avoid the wrong one in electronic communication. The absence of non-verbal cues, such\nas tone of voice or body language, means that written communication can be more easily misinterpreted and even cause offense.\nConsequently, important communications may warrant review by someone who can assess the tone and content and provide feedback.\nConnecting via text message: In texting, reliance\non abbreviations can obscure a point.\nLearning to Listen\nUsing active and reflective listening skills can help improve the effectiveness of oral communication.\nLearning Objectives\nExplain active and reflective listening as techniques for improving the effectiveness of oral communication\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nCommunication is an activity that involves a both sender and an audience, or receiver. While the sender must focus on making sure the\nmessage is clear, the receiver has to show that the message is received and understood.\nActive listening is a process of attending carefully to what is being said and how the speaker says it.\nReflective listening focuses on personal elements of communication rather than the abstract ideas. It deals with the emotional content of\ncommunication.\nKey Terms\nInterpretation: An act of explaining what is obscure.\nactive listening: The process of attending carefully to what a speaker is saying, involving such techniques as accurately paraphrasing the\nspeaker's remarks.\nreceiver: A person who receives a signal.\nEffective oral communication is the responsibility of both the sender and the recipient. While the sender must focus on making sure the\nmessage is clear, the receiver has to show that the message is received and understood. For the sender, content, channel choice, and\nunderstanding of the audience matter most. For the recipient, listening skills are paramount. Listening is an interaction between speaker\nand listener. The listener's use of active and reflective listening skills can help improve communication effectiveness.\nActive Listening\nActive listening is a process of attending carefully to what is being said. It also involves the listener observing the speaker's behavior and\nbody language. One way to demonstrate this attention is for the listener to show understanding by paraphrasing what the speaker has\nsaid. Paraphrasing can confirm the accuracy of the listener's interpretation or identify the need for clarification. Conversely, when\nindividuals show disinterest or distraction when someone is speaking, it reveals an absence of listening that can frustrate, annoy, and even\nanger the speaker.\nNot listening: Failing to listen to a speaker can create\nanger, resentment, and misunderstanding.\nReflective Listening\nReflective listening focuses on personal elements of the communication rather than the abstract ideas. Reflective listening should be\nfeeling-oriented and responsive. The listener should show empathy and concern for the person communicating. A good reflective listener\nconcentrates on the discussion at hand while allowing the speaker to lead the communication. Verbal response is essential for reflective\nlistening. Listeners should make statements that paraphrase what is said, clarify what appears to be implicit, and reflect the emotion or\nfeeling they sense from the speaker. Being able to understand and articulate the meaning behind the words helps receivers better\ninterpret the information and messages they hear.\nLearning to Communicate Nonverbally\nNonverbal communication is the process of conveying meaning through sending and receiving wordless cues.\nLearning Objectives\nIdentify key facets of nonverbal communication and gain awareness of how to interpret and use them\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nOral and written communications contain nonverbal elements that can reinforce or contradict what is being expressed verbally.\nNonverbal communication represents two-thirds of all communication. For this reason, learning to identify and read nonverbal cues is an\nimportant communication skill.\nNonverbal communication can enhance a spoken message through gestures, eye contact, and posture.\nKey Terms\nnonverbal: Of communication: a form other than written or spoken words, like gestures, facial expressions, or body language.\nNonverbal communication is the process of sending and receiving wordless (mostly visual) messages between people. Oral and written\ncommunication has nonverbal elements that can reinforce or contradict what is being expressed verbally. Messages can be\ncommunicated through gestures and touch, by body language or posture, or by facial expression and eye contact. Speech also contains\nnonverbal elements, known as paralanguage, that include voice quality, rate, pitch, volume, and speaking style, as well prosodic features\nsuch as rhythm, intonation, and stress.\nLikewise, written texts have nonverbal elements such as handwriting style, spatial arrangement of words, or the physical layout of a page.\nHowever, much of the study of nonverbal communication has focused on face-to-face interaction, in which nonverbal cues are classified\ninto three principal areas: environmental conditions, where communication takes place; physical characteristics of the communicators; and\nbehaviors of communicators during interaction.\nSymbol table for nonverbal communication with\npatients: This table is an example of images that are\nused to communicate in place of speech.\nNonverbal communication can enhance a spoken message through body signals. Body language contains numerous elements, including\nphysical features (both changeable and unchangeable); gestures and signals (both conscious and unconscious); and spatial relations. The\nlistener might perceive an unintended message if the body language conveyed by the speaker does not match the verbal message.\nNonverbal communication is an important component when making a first impression with a new acquaintance or business contact. Body\nlanguage, stance, and voice inflection or tone can have a stronger impact than the content of an initial communication itself.\nNonverbal communication represents two-thirds of all communication. For this reason, learning to identify and read nonverbal cues is an\nimportant communication skill. While listening, try to observe the speaker's posture, clothing, gestures, and eye contact. These convey\ninformation about the speaker as well as his or her message.\nPosture\nPosture or a person's bodily stance can communicate a variety of messages. Some of the many types of posture include: slouching,\ntowering, legs spread, jaw thrust, shoulders forward, and arm crossing. These nonverbal behaviors can indicate feelings and attitudes\ntoward another person. Posture can be used to determine a participant's degree of attention or involvement; the difference in status\nbetween communicators; and the level of fondness a person has for the other communicator, depending on body openness. For instance,\na person who displays a forward lean or decreases a backward lean signifies positive sentiment during communication.\nClothing\nClothing is one of the most common forms of nonverbal communication. The study of clothing and other objects as a means of\nnonverbal communication is known as artifact or object. These studies indicate that the types of clothing an individual wears convey\nnonverbal clues about personality, background and financial status, and how others will respond. An individual's clothing style can\ndemonstrate level of confidence, cultural origin or preference, interests, age, level of authority, values and beliefs.\nGestures\nGestures may be made with the hands, arms, or body and also include movements of the head, face, and eyes, such as winking, nodding,\nor eye-rolling. Facial expressions, more than anything, serve as a practical means of communication. With all the various muscles that\nprecisely control mouth, lips, eyes, nose, forehead, and jaw, human faces are estimated to be capable of more than ten thousand different\nexpressions. This versatility makes nonverbal messages of the face extremely efficient and honest, unless they are deliberately\nmanipulated. In addition, many emotions, including happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, shame, anguish, and interest are\nuniversally recognized.\nEye Contact\nWhen two people look at each other's eyes at the same time, they are making eye contact. It is the primary nonverbal way of indicating\nengagement, interest, attention, and involvement. Studies have found that people use their eyes to indicate interest. This includes\nfrequently recognized actions of winking and movements of the eyebrows. Disinterest is highly noticeable when individuals make little or\nno eye contact in a social setting. Generally speaking, the longer the established eye contact between two people, the greater the\nintimacy levels.\nDelivering Constructive Feedback\nConstructive feedback, both positive and negative, can help individuals learn and improve their performance.\nLearning Objectives\nEmploy constructive feedback in conjunction with the varying control functions available to managers in an organization\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nPositive and negative feedback can be constructive when it addresses factors directly related to performance over which someone has\ncontrol.\nConstructive feedback serves as motivation for many people in the workplace.\nA performance appraisal or performance evaluation is a systematic, periodic process that assesses an individual employee's job\nperformance and productivity in relation to established criteria and organizational objectives.\nIn human resources or industrial psychology, 360-degree feedback, also known as multi-rater feedback, multi-source feedback, or multi-\nsource assessment, is feedback from members of an employee's immediate work circle.\nKey Terms\nfeedback: Critical assessment on information produced,\nconstructive: Carefully considered and meant to be helpful.\nCritical assessments are essential to learning and performance improvement. Individuals often rely on external measures, such as exams\nor feedback from others, to determine strengths and weaknesses. Praise and compliments are welcome reassurance of a person's abilities,\nbut negative assessments can hurt unless clearly supported by observations and thoughtfully delivered. Whether positive or negative,\nfeedback can be constructive when it addresses factors directly related to performance over which someone has control.\nKnowing how to deliver constructive feedback is an important skill for a manager and leader. Constructive feedback motivates many who\nuse it to change their behavior, study new things, or adopt new attitudes. After receiving constructive feedback, an individual decides\nwhether and how to put it to use. Joseph Folkman, an expert in the use of the 360-degree feedback technique, comments that those who\nwant to achieve the greatest level of success possible should learn how to accept any kind of feedback, analyze it in the most positive\nmanner possible, and use it to influence future choices.\nFeedback in Organizations\nFeedback is given in organizations in a variety of ways. Some are informal, as when a colleague offers a compliment or critique after\nhearing a presentation or reading a report. Others feedback mechanisms are more formal and part of a process created for the explicit\npurpose of delivering performance assessments.\nPerformance Appraisal\nA performance appraisal (PA) or performance evaluation is a systematic and periodic process that assesses an individual employee's job\nperformance and productivity in relation to certain established criteria and organizational objectives. Other aspects of employee\nperformance are considered as well, such as organizational citizenship behavior, accomplishments, potential for future improvement,\nstrengths and weaknesses, etc. While performance appraisals are documented in writing, usually a manager will meet to provide and\ndiscuss feedback with an employee. Using specific examples of each behavior to support each assessment is helpful in indicating what\nsomeone needs to do differently or improve.\n360-Degree Feedback\nIn human resources, 360-degree feedback, also known as multi-rater feedback, multi-source feedback, or multi-source assessment, is\nfeedback that comes from members of an employee's immediate work circle. Most often, 360-degree feedback will include opinions from\nan employee's subordinates, peers, and supervisor(s), as well as a self-evaluation. In some cases, it can also include feedback from external\nsources, such as customers and suppliers or other interested stakeholders. The 360-degree assessment may be contrasted with \"upward\nfeedback,\" where managers are given feedback only by their direct reports, or with a traditional performance appraisal, in which\nemployees are most often reviewed only by their managers.\nAfter-Action Reviews\nAt the end of a project, team members benefit from reviewing how they worked together, how well they met the project objectives, and\nwhether they achieved the planned outcome. This after-action review entails a candid analysis of work product, communication practices,\nindividual effort, coordination and planning, and other key aspects related to the project. The goal of this form of feedback is to apply\nlessons learned from one project to subsequent ones. Constructive feedback in this context is best delivered by focusing on actions and\noutcomes rather than on blaming individuals when things did not go as planned.\nThe Impact of the Office Environment on Employee Communication\nThe main purpose of an office environment is to support its occupants in performing their job at minimum cost and with maximum\nsatisfaction.\nLearning Objectives\nIdentify types and functions of physical spaces that organizations use to control information, work processes, and social interactions\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nEffective communication among team members and others requires a physical environment that facilitates interaction.\nThere are three types of office spaces, each with distinct purposes and functions: work spaces, meeting spaces, and support spaces.\nDecisions about the physical environment shape information flow, work processes, and social interactions.\nKey Terms\naccommodate: To render fit, suitable, or correspondent; to adapt; to conform.\ncubicle: A small separate part or one of the compartments of a room.\nThe main purpose of an office environment is to support its occupants in performing their job, preferably at minimum cost and with\nmaximum satisfaction. In most organizations, work is accomplished by teams of people. Effective communication among team members\nand others requires a physical environment that facilitates interaction so individuals can coordinate activities, discuss and plan tasks, and\nmanage interpersonal relationships effectively and efficiently. For this reason, the design of work spaces can be an important element in\norganizational performance.\nA more open physical space can encourage casual communication since people work in close proximity with few barriers between them.\nCreating clear lines of sight and facilitating easy access make it easier for individuals to know who is present and available for interaction\nand to engage with them as needed. On the other hand, more private spaces, such as offices with doors, can create a more formal climate\nthat distinguished between roles and status. Highly desirable corner offices occupied by an executive are an example. Individual offices\ncan also preserve confidentiality and discretion as needed, which is especially useful for meetings between managers and their team\nmembers or when personnel matters are discussed.\nWork places are typically divided into three physical areas: work spaces, meeting spaces, and support spaces. Each has it distinct function\nand purpose. The design of an organization's physical environment requires a series of decisions about how the spaces will be used, by\nwhom, and under what circumstances. Together, these choices can shape the flow of information, work processes, and interpersonal\nrelationships.\nOffice space: Organizing physical space according to the\nfunctional needs of the work can improve employee\ncommunication and satisfaction.\nWork Spaces\nWork spaces in an office are typically used for conventional office activities such as reading, writing, and computer work. There are nine\ngeneric types of work space, each supporting different activities. These include:\nOpen office \u2013 An open space for more than ten people, suitable for activities that demand frequent communication or routine activities\nneeding relatively little concentration\nTeam space \u2013 A semi-enclosed space for two to eight people, suitable for teamwork that demands frequent internal communication and a\nmedium level of concentration\nCubicle \u2013 A semi-enclosed space for one person, suitable for activities that demand medium concentration and medium interaction\nPrivate office \u2013 An enclosed space for one person, suitable for activities that are confidential, demand a lot of concentration, or include\nmany small meetings\nShared office \u2013 An enclosed space for two or three people, suitable for semi-concentrated work and collaborative work in small groups\nTeam room \u2013 An enclosed space for four to ten people, suitable for teamwork that may be confidential and demands frequent internal\ncommunication\nStudy booth \u2013 An enclosed space for one person, suitable for short-term activities that demand concentration or confidentiality\nWork lounge \u2013 A lounge-like space for two to six people, suitable for short-term activities that demand collaboration and allow\nimpromptu interaction\nTouch down \u2013 An open space for one person, suitable for short-term activities that require little concentration and low interaction\nMeeting Spaces\nMeeting spaces are also an important facet to consider when improving and building work places. Following are some types of meeting\nspaces:\nSmall meeting room \u2013 An enclosed space for two to four persons, suitable for both formal and informal interaction\nLarge meeting room \u2013 An enclosed space for five to twelve people, suitable for formal interaction\nSmall meeting space \u2013 An open or semi-open space for two to four persons, suitable for short, informal interaction\nLarge meeting space \u2013 An open or semi-open space for five to twelve people, suitable for short, informal interaction\nBrainstorm room \u2013 An enclosed space for five to twelve people, suitable for brainstorming sessions and workshops\nMeeting point \u2013 An open area for two to four persons such as a sitting area, suitable for ad hoc, informal meetings\nSupport Spaces\nSupport spaces in an office are typically used for secondary activities such as filing documents or taking a break. There are twelve generic\ntypes of support space, each supporting different activities. These include:\nFiling space \u2013 An open or enclosed space for storing frequently used files and documents\nStorage space \u2013 An open or enclosed space for storing commonly used office supplies\nPrint and copy area \u2013 An open or enclosed space with facilities for printing, scanning, and copying\nMail area \u2013 An open or semi-open space where employees can pick up or deliver mail or packages\nPantry area \u2013 An open or enclosed space where people can get coffee and tea as well as soft drinks and snacks\nBreak area \u2013 A semi-open or enclosed space where employees can take a break from their work\nLocker area \u2013 An open or semi-open space where employees can store their personal belongings\nLibrary \u2013 A semi-open or enclosed space for reading and storing books, journals, and magazines\nGames room \u2013 An enclosed space where employees can interact in recreational activities (for example, video games or ping-pong) during\nbreaks from work\nWaiting area \u2013 An open or semi-open space where visitors can be received and can wait for their appointment\nCirculation space \u2013 Space which is required for circulation on office floors, linking all major functions\nSetting Transparency Norms\nTransparency in organizations is the extent to which its actions are observable by outsiders.\nLearning Objectives\nDefine transparency and identify how it is determined by organizations' communication strategies and practices\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nBeing transparent means operating in such a way that an organization 's actions are visible to outsiders.\nAn organization's communication norms and practices determine its degree of transparency.\nTransparency has three primary dimensions: information disclosure, clarity, and accuracy.\nKey Terms\ntransparency: Figuratively, openness and accessibility.\nTransparency in organizations is the extent to which its actions are observable by outsiders. It is a consequence of regulation, social\nexpectations, and explicit policies that establish the degree of openness to employees, shareholders, other stakeholders, and the general\npublic. Transparency is an essential part of accountability since it allows for judgments about whether an organization is achieving its\nobjectives and living up to its obligations and espoused values. Because transparency is the perceived quality of intentionally shared\ninformation, an organization's communication practices and norms play an important role in shaping the visibility of its actions.\nTransparency has three primary dimensions: information disclosure, clarity, and accuracy.\nInformation Disclosure\nInformation disclosure includes choices about what types of information is shared and with whom, the content of what is communicated,\nand the timing of the release of information. For example, managers who voluntarily share with environmental activists information\nrelated to the firm's ecological impact are practicing disclosure. Information can be a source of power, so people may hoard it to increase\ntheir influence over others; this tactic reduces the amount of transparency. Some information is private, such as personnel matters, or\ncommercially sensitive, like strategic business plans. Norms and policies about disclosure focus on criteria such as relevance and\nappropriateness to determine who should have access to what information.\nClarity\nClarity refers to how easily comprehended the information or communication is. Managers who limit the use of technical terminology,\nfine print, or complicated mathematical notations in their correspondence with suppliers and customers are employing clarity.\nCommunication practices that value quality of expression, attention to the needs of different audiences, and sensitivity to cultural and\nother differences can help make an organization more transparent.\nAccuracy\nAccuracy means that available information has integrity, is truthful, and faithfully represents organizational decisions, policies, and\npractices. Where there is transparency, managers do not bias, embellish, or otherwise distort facts with the aim of misleading or\nmisrepresenting reality. Organizations that value honesty, trust, and ethical practices encourage accuracy and thereby increase their\ntransparency.\nExamples of Corporate Transparency\nExamples of decisions to increase corporate transparency include when a firm voluntarily shares information about their ecological impact\nwith environmental activists; actively limiting the use of technical terminology, fine print, or complicated mathematical notations in the\nfirm's correspondence with suppliers and customers; and avoiding bias, embellishment, or other distortions of known facts in the firm's\ncommunications with investors.\nWage disclosure is one particular area in which companies can practice corporate transparency. For example, in the UK, employees\noutside the boardroom are currently granted anonymity regarding pay levels. In 2009, UK city minister Lord Myners proposed that the\npay and identity of up to 20 of the highest-paid employees at British companies be disclosed; he also called for employees' salary ranges\nto be disclosed. Following these guidelines would increase transparency: the public would have access to compensation information now\nkept from public view. Similar proposals have become increasingly common as high executive pay levels have come under increasing\nscrutiny. In this case, it is unlikely that disclosure will be made a legal requirement in the UK; the hope is that companies would voluntarily\naccept this higher level of transparency.\nUsing Technology to Communicate\nCommunication technologies support many types of messaging and information sharing in organizations.\nLearning Objectives\nExplain the role of technology in supporting communication in organizations\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nBusiness communication often relies on the use of technology to connect and facilitate the flow of information among individuals,\ngroups, and organizations.\nTechnology can enable real-time interaction or delayed response, that is, asynchronous with gaps in time between when a sender\ntransmits a message and when the recipient processes it.\nCommunication technologies can support unidirectional information sharing or more interactive and collaborate work.\nKey Terms\nDelayed Response: In communication, pertaining to the ability to respond at a later time (the opposite of real-time, such as speaking).\nUnidirectional: Communication designed to provided information or data that does not require a response.\nreal-time: Communication occurring in that instant, necessitating immediate response and engagement (i.e. conference call, business\nmeeting, etc.)\nBusiness communication often relies on the use of technology to connect and facilitate the flow of information among individuals,\ngroups, and organizations. Technologies for e-mailing, messaging, video conferencing, and document-sharing in most organizations are\nfully integrated into how work is conducted and how people interact.\nCommunication methods: Technology in communication can\ninclude e-mail, texting, and social media.\nSome technologies support simultaneous, or real-time, interaction, including among individuals in different locations. In these cases,\ninteraction is immediate and direct. Examples of this type of technology include teleconferences and web chats. Other communication\ntools are asynchronous, meaning messages may be transmitted by senders and processed by recipients at different times. E-mail and\ndigital documents, such as spreadsheets and presentations, are examples of asynchronous tools. Responses from recipients may be\ndelayed, which means the sender must wait for confirmation that the message has been interpreted as intended and resulted in the\ndesired action. Many mobile apps used on tablets and smartphones allow for both real-time and asynchronous communication.\nCommunication mediated by technology can be unidirectional, flowing from a sender to one or more individuals, groups, or\norganizations. Unidirectional communication is typical when the sender primarily seeks to inform or influence the recipient(s). Electronic\nmemos that are e-mailed or documents shared via computer servers are examples. Alternatively, communication can be intended as\nreciprocal and interactive. A collaboration tool such as Google Docs is an example.\nOrganizations use communication technology to support and drive their business activities. Some examples of technology used to\ncommunicate in business include:\nE-mail among employees, management, and customers\nSocial media sites used to communicate with customers\nVideo conferencing used to hold meetings with remote workers\nSMS (texting) among employees\nInternet marketing as way to advertise products and services to customers\nMobile marketing strategies to advertise products to customers based on their current location\nMobile applications such as QR codes and Shazaam offering additional information to customers about a company or service\nThe predominance of communication technologies in organizational life means it is vital that employees have the skills to use them. Many\norganizations make training available, but increasingly employers expect prospective employees to be experienced users of desktop and\neven mobile technologies.\nThe Importance of Sensitivity and Etiquette in Business Communication\nFollowing the norms and practices of etiquette is an important factor in effective business communication.\nLearning Objectives\nExplain the importance of identifying and considering different etiquette and cultural customs in business communication\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nBusiness etiquette is the code of expected professional behavior regarding manners, courtesy, and politeness.\nEtiquette is dependent on culture; what is excellent etiquette in one society may shock in another.\nA failure to understand, be sensitive to, and adjust to different etiquette expectations can impede successful communication.\nKey Terms\netiquette: Forms required by good breeding or prescribed by authority, to be observed in social or official life; conventional decorum;\nceremonial code of polite society.\nWe use forms of etiquette in interactions with co-workers, business colleagues, customers, suppliers, and other types of stakeholders.\nThese norms are typically unwritten rules learned through socialization and experience, although some organizations have explicit written\nrules of conduct that speak to matters of etiquette. Practicing etiquette demonstrates respect, and effective communication requires that\nmessage are sent and received in ways that are consistent with the norms of etiquette.\nBusiness etiquette can vary significantly by country and geographic area. Etiquette is a core aspect of most cultures, which represent the\nvalues that guide how people live and interact. Differences in etiquette can create challenges for cross-cultural communication in\nbusiness. What is excellent etiquette in one society may shock another. For example, conflict between expectations of etiquette can arise\nin meetings held during meals. In China, a person who takes the last item of food from a common plate or bowl without first offering it to\nothers at the table may be viewed as a glutton who is insulting the host's generosity. Traditionally, guests who do not have leftover food\nin front of them at the end of a meal in China have dishonored their host. Conversely, in the United States of America, guest are expected\nto eat all of the food given to them as a compliment to the quality of the cooking. However, there too it is considered polite to offer food\nfrom a common plate or bowl to others at the table. If both parties are aware of and sensitive to differences in etiquette, they can avoid\nmisinterpreting behavior or giving the wrong impression.\nBowing in Japan: Bowing is an important part of etiquette in\nJapan.\nA failure to understand, be sensitive to, and adjust to different etiquette expectations can impede successful communication. Credibility is\nessential in the ability to persuade, and perceived displays of disrespect can make it difficult to influence others. Etiquette reflects shared\nexpectations of behavior, and thus it is an important basis of developing good interpersonal relationships that facilitate effective\ncommunication. The ability to use proper etiquette is an important quality of professionalism; it is therefore vital for employees to learn\nthe norms and practices of etiquette in the organizations and cultures in which they work.\nLicenses and Attributions\nPrevious Next\nFreshly uploaded management documents\nEthics in Financial Reporting.edited Rubric Topic 2 Becoming and being an effective\nleader Advocacy and Leadership\n(7041HSV3235)\nSOC110 Wk 5 Assessment MANAGEMENT-889-Slides MANAGEMENT-9257-Analysis\nSOC110 Wk 3 Assessment(1) The topic, aims, objectives and research Employee Turnover.edited\nquestions\nSUBJECTS LEGAL COMPANY CONNECT WITH US\nAccounting Copyright Policy Documents Sitemap Facebook\nBusiness Honor Code Study Guides Instagram\nCommunications Terms YouTube\nEconomics Academic Integrity Twitter\nFinance Cookie Policy\nLaw Privacy Policy\nManagement Do Not Sell or Share My Personal\nInfo\nMarketing\nMathematics\nSociology\nStatistics\n\u00a9 Learneo, Inc. 2023 Course Sidekick is not sponsored or endorsed by any college or university."
