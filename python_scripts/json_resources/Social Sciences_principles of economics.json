The text uses conversational language and ample illustrations to explore economic\ntheories, and provides a wide array of examples using both fictional and real-world scenarios. The third 2 Preface\nedition has been carefully and thoroughly updated to reflect current data and understanding, as well as to\nprovide a deeper background in diverse contributors and their impacts on economic thought and analysis.\nCoverage and scope\nIn response to faculty feedback and to ease transition to a new edition, Principles of Economics 3e retains the\norganization of the previous editions. The book covers the breadth of economics topics and also provides the\nnecessary depth to ensure the course is manageable for instructors and students alike. We strove to balance\ntheory and application, as well as the amount of calculation and mathematical examples.\nThe book is organized into eight main parts:\n\u2022 What is Economics?The first two chapters introduce students to the study of economics with a focus on\nmaking choices in a world of scarce resources.\n\u2022 Supply and Demand, Chapters 3 and 4, introduces and explains the first analytical model in economics:\nsupply, demand, and equilibrium, before showing applications in the markets for labor and finance.\n\u2022 The Fundamentals of Microeconomic Theory, Chapters 5 through 10, begins the microeconomics\nportion of the text, presenting the theories of consumer behavior, production and costs, and the different\nmodels of market structure, including some simple game theory.\n\u2022 Microeconomic Policy Issues, Chapters 11 through 18, covers the range of topics in applied micro,\nframed around the concepts of public goods and positive and negative externalities. Students explore\ncompetition and antitrust policies, environmental problems, poverty, income inequality, and other labor\nmarket issues. The text also covers information, risk and financial markets, as well as public economy.\n\u2022 The Macroeconomic Perspective and Goals, Chapters 19 through 23, introduces a number of key\nconcepts in macro: economic growth, unemployment and inflation, and international trade and capital\nflows.\n\u2022 A Framework for Macroeconomic Analysis, Chapters 24 through 26, introduces the principal analytic\nmodel in macro, namely the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model. The model is then applied to the\nKeynesian and Neoclassical perspectives. The expenditure-output model is fully explained in a stand-\nalone appendix.\n\u2022 Monetary and Fiscal Policy, Chapters 27 through 31, explains the role of money and the banking system,\nas well as monetary policy and financial regulation. Then the discussion switches to government deficits\nand fiscal policy.\n\u2022 International Economics, Chapters 32 through 34, the final part of the text, introduces the international\ndimensions of economics, including international trade and protectionism.\nChanges to the third edition\nThe revision process incorporated extensive feedback from faculty who have used the book in their courses.\nThey advised that the third edition changes focus on currency updates, integration of newer perspectives and\nmore diverse contributors, and relevance to students\u2019 lives and careers.\nCurrent data and analysis:The authors have updated dozens of explanations, graphs, and tables containing\nfinancial, demographic, employment, and related economic data. The corresponding discussions provide\ncontext and interpretations of the data, including descriptions of change over time, cause-and-effect\nrelationships, and balanced analysis of policies and opinions.\nDiverse perspectives and contributors:The third edition highlights the research and views of a broader\ngroup of economists. These include people from across the spectrum of economic thought, with a particular\nfocus on those who take what are often considered non-traditional views of economic policy and government\naction. Examples include:\n\u2022 Chapter 1: Esther Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee, and Michael Kremer regarding experimental analysis in\ndevelopment economics.\nAccess for free at openstax.org Preface 3\n\u2022 Chapter 4: Walter Williams and Thomas Sowell regarding the downsides of minimum wages.\n\u2022 Chapter 13: Carlota Perez regarding employment shifts resulting from innovation; Mariana Mazzucato\nregarding government involvement in innovation; Elinor Ostrom and the \u201cnon-tragedy of the commons.\u201d\n\u2022 Chapter 14: William A. Darity Jr. on employment discrimination and market forces; Phyllis Ann Wallace\nand the EEOC.\n\u2022 Chapter 19: Kate Raworth regarding concepts for expanding economic measures beyond GDP and similar\nmetrics.\n\u2022 Chapter 32: W. Arthur Lewis and the dual sector economy; Dambisa Moyo regarding the benefits and\ndetriments of foreign aid.\nRelevance and engagement:In order to show the importance and application of economics in students\u2019 lives\nand careers, the third edition directly addresses and expands topics likely to connect to various industries,\nissues, groups, and events. Brief references and deeply explored socio-political examples have been updated\nto showcase the critical\u2014and sometimes unnoticed\u2014ties between economic developments and topics relevant\nto students. Examples include education spending, the value of college degrees, discrimination, environmental\npolicies, immigration policies, entrepreneurship and innovation, healthcare and insurance, and general\nfinancial literacy. Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic is referenced frequently to demonstrate its deep and\nevolving impacts on financial data, employment, and other aspects of the economy.\nFRED Data and Graphs:As in previous editions, the authors have included and referenced data from the\nFederal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). In some cases, interactive FRED graphs are embedded directly in the\nweb view of the book; students may magnify and focus on specific time periods, analyze individual data points,\nand otherwise manipulate the graphs from within the OpenStax reading experience. In others cases (and in\nthe PDF), links to the direct source of the FRED data are provided, and students are encouraged to explore the\ninformation and the overall FRED resources more thoroughly. Note that other data sources, such as the Bureau\nof Labor Statistics, U.S. Census Bureau, and World Bank, usually include links in the captions or credits;\ninstructors and students can also explore those sites for more detailed investigations of the topics at hand.\nUpdated art\nPrinciples of Economics 3eincludes updated and redesigned art to clarify concepts and provide opportunities\nfor graphical interpretation. Many graphs are shown with accompanying data tables and explanations of the\ndrivers and consequences of change. 4 Preface\nPedagogical foundation\nThe narrative explanations and analysis presented inPrinciples of Economics 3ehave been carefully crafted to\nprovide a solid basis in economic concepts, flexibly approach skills and assess understanding, and deepen\nstudents\u2019 engagement with the course materials. You will also find features that promote economic inquiry and\nexplorations, including:\n\u2022 Bring It Home:These explorations include a brief case study, specific to each chapter, which connects the\nchapter\u2019s main topic to the real word. It is broken up into two parts: the first at the beginning of the\nchapter (in the intro module) and the second at chapter\u2019s end, when students have learned what\u2019s\nnecessary to understand the case and \u201cbring home\u201d the chapter\u2019s core concepts.\n\u2022 Work It Out:These worked examples progress through an analytical or computational problem, and guide\nstudents step by step to find out how its solution is derived.\n\u2022 Clear It Up:These boxes are deeper explanations of something in the main body of the text. Each Clear It\nUp starts with a question. The rest of the feature explains the answer.\nQuestions for each level of learning\nPrinciples of Economics 3eoffers flexibility in practice and assessment, and provides a range of opportunities\nto check understanding and encourage deeper thinking and application.\n\u2022 Self-Checksare analytical self-assessment questions that appear at the end of each module. They \u201cclick to\nreveal\u201d an answer in the web view so students can check their understanding before moving on to the next\nmodule. Self-Check questions are not simple look-up questions. They push the student to think beyond\nwhat is said in the text. Self-Check questions are designed for formative (rather than summative)\nAccess for free at openstax.org Preface 5\nassessment. The questions and answers are explained so that students feel like they are being walked\nthrough the problem.\n\u2022 Review Questionsare simple recall questions from the chapter in open-response format (not multiple\nchoice or true/false). The answers can be looked up in the text.\n\u2022 Critical Thinking Questionsare higher-level, conceptual questions that ask students to demonstrate their\nunderstanding by applying what they have learned in different contexts.\n\u2022 Problemsare exercises that give students additional practice working with the analytic and\ncomputational concepts in the module.\nAbout the Authors\nSenior contributing authors\nDavid Shapiro, Pennsylvania State University\nDavid Shapiro is Professor Emeritus of Economics, Demography, and Women\u2019s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies\nat the Pennsylvania State University.

Today, social media giants Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are major forces on the information super\nhighway. (Credit: modification of \"Social Media Mixed Icons - Banner\" by Blogtrepreneur/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nCHAPTER OBJECTIVES\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\u2022 What Is Economics, and Why Is It Important?\n\u2022 Microeconomics and Macroeconomics\n\u2022 How Economists Use Theories and Models to Understand Economic Issues\n\u2022 How Economies Can Be Organized: An Overview of Economic Systems\nIntroduction\nBRING IT HOME\nInformation Overload in the Information Age\nTo post or not to post? Every day we are faced with a myriad of decisions, from what to have for breakfast, to which\nshow to stream, to the more complex\u2014\u201cShould I double major and add possibly another semester of study to my\neducation?\u201d Our response to these choices depends on the information we have available at any given moment.\nEconomists call this \u201cimperfect\u201d because we rarely have all the data we need to make perfect decisions. Despite the\nlack of perfect information, we still make hundreds of decisions a day.\nStreams, sponsors, and social media are altering the process by which we make choices, how we spend our time,\nwhich movies we see, which products we buy, and more. Whether they read the reviews or just check the ratings, it's\nunlikely for Americans to make many significant decisions without these information streams.\nAs you will see in this course, what happens in economics is affected by how well and how fast information\ndisseminates through a society, such as how quickly information travels through Facebook. \u201cEconomists love\nnothing better than when deep and liquid markets operate under conditions of perfect information,\u201d says Jessica\nIrvine, National Economics Editor for News Corp Australia.\nThis leads us to the topic of this chapter, an introduction to the world of making decisions, processing information, 10 1 \u2022 Welcome to Economics!\nand understanding behavior in markets \u2014the world of economics. Each chapter in this book will start with a\ndiscussion about current (or sometimes past) events and revisit it at chapter\u2019s end\u2014to \u201cbring home\u201d the concepts in\nplay.\nWhat is economics and why should you spend your time learning it? After all, there are other disciplines you\ncould be studying, and other ways you could be spending your time. As the Bring it Home feature just\nmentioned, making choices is at the heart of what economists study, and your decision to take this course is as\nmuch as economic decision as anything else.\nEconomics is probably not what you think. It is not primarily about money or finance. It is not primarily about\nbusiness. It is not mathematics. What is it then? It is both a subject area and a way of viewing the world.\n1.1What Is Economics, and Why Is It Important?\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Discuss the importance of studying economics\n\u2022 Explain the relationship between production and division of labor\n\u2022 Evaluate the significance of scarcity\nEconomicsis the study of how humans make decisions in the face of scarcity. These can be individual\ndecisions, family decisions, business decisions or societal decisions. If you look around carefully, you will see\nthat scarcity is a fact of life.Scarcitymeans that human wants for goods, services and resources exceed what\nis available. Resources, such as labor, tools, land, and raw materials are necessary to produce the goods and\nservices we want but they exist in limited supply. Of course, the ultimate scarce resource is time- everyone,\nrich or poor, has just 24 expendable hours in the day to earn income to acquire goods and services, for leisure\ntime, or for sleep. At any point in time, there is only a finite amount of resources available.\nThink about it this way: In 2015 the labor force in the United States contained over 158 million workers,\naccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The total land area was 3,794,101 square miles. While these\nare certainly large numbers, they are not infinite. Because these resources are limited, so are the numbers of\ngoods and services we produce with them. Combine this with the fact that human wants seem to be virtually\ninfinite, and you can see why scarcity is a problem.\nIntroduction to FRED\nData is very important in economics because it describes and measures the issues and problems that\neconomics seek to understand. A variety of government agencies publish economic and social data. For this\ncourse, we will generally use data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank's FRED database. FRED is very user\nfriendly. It allows you to display data in tables or charts, and you can easily download it into spreadsheet form\nif you want to use the data for other purposes. TheFRED website(https://openstax.org/l/FRED/)includes data\non nearly 400,000 domestic and international variables over time, in the following broad categories:\n\u2022 Money, Banking & Finance\n\u2022 Population, Employment, & Labor Markets (including Income Distribution)\n\u2022 National Accounts (Gross Domestic Product & its components), Flow of Funds, and International Accounts\n\u2022 Production & Business Activity (including Business Cycles)\n\u2022 Prices & Inflation (including the Consumer Price Index, the Producer Price Index, and the Employment\nCost Index)\n\u2022 International Data from other nations\n\u2022 U.S. Regional Data\n\u2022 Academic Data (including Penn World Tables & NBER Macrohistory database)\nFor more information about how to use FRED, see the variety ofvideos(https://openstax.org/l/FRED_intro)on\nAccess for free at openstax.org 1.1 \u2022 What Is Economics, and Why Is It Important? 11\nYouTube starting with this introduction.\nFIGURE1.2Scarcity of ResourcesPeople experiencing homelessness are a stark reminder that scarcity of\nresources is real. (Credit: \"Pittsburgh Homeless\" by \"daveyinn\"/Flickr Creative Commons, CC BY 2.0)\nIf you still do not believe that scarcity is a problem, consider the following: Does everyone require food to eat?\nDoes everyone need a decent place to live? Does everyone have access to healthcare? In every country in the\nworld, there are people who are hungry, homeless (for example, those who call park benches their beds, as\nFigure 1.2shows), and in need of healthcare, just to focus on a few critical goods and services. Why is this the\ncase? It is because of scarcity. Let\u2019s delve into the concept of scarcity a little deeper, because it is crucial to\nunderstanding economics.\nThe Problem of Scarcity\nThink about all the things you consume: food, shelter, clothing, transportation, healthcare, and entertainment.\nHow do you acquire those items? You do not produce them yourself. You buy them. How do you afford the\nthings you buy? You work for pay. If you do not, someone else does on your behalf. Yet most of us never have\nenough income to buy all the things we want. This is because of scarcity. So how do we solve it?\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/drought)to read about how the United States is dealing with scarcity in\nresources.\nEvery society, at every level, must make choices about how to use its resources. Families must decide whether\nto spend their money on a new car or a fancy vacation. Towns must choose whether to put more of the budget\ninto police and fire protection or into the school system. Nations must decide whether to devote more funds to\nnational defense or to protecting the environment. In most cases, there just isn\u2019t enough money in the budget\nto do everything. How do we use our limited resources the best way possible, that is, to obtain the most goods\nand services we can? There are a couple of options. First, we could each produce everything we each consume.\nAlternatively, we could each produce some of what we want to consume, and \u201ctrade\u201d for the rest of what we\nwant. Let\u2019s explore these options. Why do we not each just produce all of the things we consume? Think back to\npioneer days, when individuals knew how to do so much more than we do today, from building their homes, to\ngrowing their crops, to hunting for food, to repairing their equipment. Most of us do not know how to do all\u2014or\nany\u2014of those things, but it is not because we could not learn. Rather, we do not have to. The reason why is\nsomething calledthe division and specialization of labor, a production innovation first put forth byAdam\nSmith(Figure 1.3) in his book,The Wealth of Nations. 12 1 \u2022 Welcome to Economics!\nFIGURE1.3Adam SmithAdam Smith introduced the idea of dividing labor into discrete tasks. (Credit: \"Adam\nSmith\" by Cadell and Davies (1811), John Horsburgh (1828), or R.C. Bell (1872)/Wikimedia Commons, Public\nDomain)\nThe Division of and Specialization of Labor\nThe formal study of economics began when Adam Smith (1723\u20131790) published his famous bookThe Wealth\nof Nationsin 1776. Many authors had written on economics in the centuries before Smith, but he was the first\nto address the subject in a comprehensive way. In the first chapter, Smith introduces the concept ofdivision of\nlabor, which means that the way one produces a good or service is divided into a number of tasks that\ndifferent workers perform, instead of all the tasks being done by the same person.\nTo illustrate division of labor, Smith counted how many tasks went into making a pin: drawing out a piece of\nwire, cutting it to the right length, straightening it, putting a head on one end and a point on the other, and\npackaging pins for sale, to name just a few. Smith counted 18 distinct tasks that different people\nperformed\u2014all for a pin, believe it or not!\nModern businesses divide tasks as well. Even a relatively simple business like a restaurant divides the task of\nserving meals into a range of jobs like top chef, sous chefs, less-skilled kitchen help, servers to wait on the\ntables, a greeter at the door, janitors to clean up, and a business manager to handle paychecks and bills\u2014not to\nmention the economic connections a restaurant has with suppliers of food, furniture, kitchen equipment, and\nthe building where it is located. A complex business like a large manufacturing factory, such as the shoe\nfactory (Figure 1.4), or a hospital can have hundreds of job classifications.\nFIGURE1.4Division of LaborWorkers on an assembly line are an example of the divisions of labor. (Credit: \"Red\nWing Shoe Factory Tour\" by Nina Hale/Flickr Creative Commons, CC BY 2.0)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 1.1 \u2022 What Is Economics, and Why Is It Important? 13\nWhy the Division of Labor Increases Production\nWhen we divide and subdivide the tasks involved with producing a good or service, workers and businesses\ncan produce a greater quantity of output. In his observations of pin factories, Smith noticed that one worker\nalone might make 20 pins in a day, but that a small business of 10 workers (some of whom would need to\ncomplete two or three of the 18 tasks involved with pin-making), could make 48,000 pins in a day. How can a\ngroup of workers, each specializing in certain tasks, produce so much more than the same number of workers\nwho try to produce the entire good or service by themselves? Smith offered three reasons.\nFirst,specializationin a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process\nwhere they have an advantage. (In later chapters, we will develop this idea by discussingcomparative\nadvantage.) People have different skills, talents, and interests, so they will be better at some jobs than at others.\nThe particular advantages may be based on educational choices, which are in turn shaped by interests and\ntalents. Only those with medical degrees qualify to become doctors, for instance. For some goods, geography\naffects specialization. For example, it is easier to be a wheat farmer in North Dakota than in Florida, but easier\nto run a tourist hotel in Florida than in North Dakota. If you live in or near a big city, it is easier to attract\nenough customers to operate a successful dry cleaning business or movie theater than if you live in a sparsely\npopulated rural area. Whatever the reason, if people specialize in the production of what they do best, they will\nbe more effective than if they produce a combination of things, some of which they are good at and some of\nwhich they are not.\nSecond, workers who specialize in certain tasks often learn to produce more quickly and with higher quality.\nThis pattern holds true for many workers, including assembly line laborers who build cars, stylists who cut\nhair, and doctors who perform heart surgery. In fact, specialized workers often know their jobs well enough to\nsuggest innovative ways to do their work faster and better.\nA similar pattern often operates within businesses. In many cases, a business that focuses on one or a few\nproducts (sometimes called its \u201ccore competency\u201d) is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range\nof products.\nThird, specialization allows businesses to take advantage ofeconomies of scale, which means that for many\ngoods, as the level of production increases, the average cost of producing each individual unit declines. For\nexample, if a factory produces only 100 cars per year, each car will be quite expensive to make on average.\nHowever, if a factory produces 50,000 cars each year, then it can set up an assembly line with huge machines\nand workers performing specialized tasks, and the average cost of production per car will be lower. The\nultimate result of workers who can focus on their preferences and talents, learn to do their specialized jobs\nbetter, and work in larger organizations is that society as a whole can produce and consume far more than if\neach person tried to produce all of their own goods and services. The division and specialization of labor has\nbeen a force against the problem of scarcity.\nTrade and Markets\nSpecialization only makes sense, though, if workers can use the pay they receive for doing their jobs to\npurchase the other goods and services that they need. In short, specialization requires trade.\nYou do not have to know anything about electronics or sound systems to play music\u2014you just buy an iPod or\nMP3 player, download the music, and listen. You do not have to know anything about artificial fibers or the\nconstruction of sewing machines if you need a jacket\u2014you just buy the jacket and wear it. You do not need to\nknow anything about internal combustion engines to operate a car\u2014you just get in and drive. Instead of trying\nto acquire all the knowledge and skills involved in producing all of the goods and services that you wish to\nconsume, the market allows you to learn a specialized set of skills and then use the pay you receive to buy the\ngoods and services you need or want. This is how our modern society has evolved into a strong economy. 14 1 \u2022 Welcome to Economics!\nWhy Study Economics?\nFIGURE1.5Esther Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee, and Michael KremerEsther Duflo, Abhijit Banerjee (both from\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology), and Michael Kremer (University of Chicago) were awarded the Nobel Prize\nfor groundbreaking work in which they established experimental methods to understand poverty and outcomes of\ninitiatives to address it. (Credit: modification of work by U.S. Embassy Sweden/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.0;\nFinancial Times/Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.0; U.S. Embassy Sweden/Flickr Creative Commons, CC BY 2.0)\nNow that you have an overview on what economics studies, let\u2019s quickly discuss why you are right to study it.\nEconomics is not primarily a collection of facts to memorize, although there are plenty of important concepts\nto learn. Instead, think of economics as a collection of questions to answer or puzzles to work. Most\nimportantly, economics provides the tools to solve those puzzles.\nConsider the complex and critical issue of education barriers on national and regional levels, which affect\nmillions of people and result in widespread poverty and inequality. Governments, aid organizations, and\nwealthy individuals spend billions of dollars each year trying to address these issues. Nations announce the\nrevitalization of their education programs; tech companies donate devices and infrastructure, and celebrities\nand charities build schools and sponsor students. Yet the problems remain, sometimes almost as pronounced\nas they were before the intervention. Why is that the case? In 2019, three economists\u2014Esther Duflo, Abhijit\nBanerjee, and Michael Kremer\u2014were awarded the Nobel Prize for their work to answer those questions. They\nworked diligently to break the widespread problems into smaller pieces, and experimented with small\ninterventions to test success. The award citation credited their work with giving the world better tools and\ninformation to address poverty and improve education. Esther Duflo, who is the youngest person and second\nwoman to win the Nobel Prize in Economics, said, \"We believed that like the war on cancer, the war on poverty\nwas not going to be won in one major battle, but in a series of small triumphs. . . . This work and the culture of\nlearning that it fostered in governments has led to real improvement in the lives of hundreds of millions of\npoor people.\u201d\nAs you can see, economics affects far more than business. For example:\n\u2022 Virtually every major problem facing the world today, from global warming, to world poverty, to the\nconflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia, has an economic dimension. If you are going to be part of\nsolving those problems, you need to be able to understand them. Economics is crucial.\n\u2022 It is hard to overstate the importance of economics to good citizenship. You need to be able to vote\nintelligently on budgets, regulations, and laws in general. When the U.S. government came close to a\nstandstill at the end of 2012 due to the \u201cfiscal cliff,\u201d what were the issues? Did you know?\n\u2022 A basic understanding of economics makes you a well-rounded thinker. When you read articles about\neconomic issues, you will understand and be able to evaluate the writer\u2019s argument. When you hear\nAccess for free at openstax.org 1.2 \u2022 Microeconomics and Macroeconomics 15\nclassmates, co-workers, or political candidates talking about economics, you will be able to distinguish\nbetween common sense and nonsense. You will find new ways of thinking about current events and about\npersonal and business decisions, as well as current events and politics.\nThe study of economics does not dictate the answers, but it can illuminate the different choices.\n1.2Microeconomics and Macroeconomics\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Describe microeconomics\n\u2022 Describe macroeconomics\n\u2022 Contrast monetary policy and fiscal policy\nEconomics is concerned with the well-being ofallpeople, including those with jobs and those without jobs, as\nwell as those with high incomes and those with low incomes. Economics acknowledges that production of\nuseful goods and services can create problems of environmental pollution. It explores the question of how\ninvesting in education helps to develop workers\u2019 skills. It probes questions like how to tell when big businesses\nor big labor unions are operating in a way that benefits society as a whole and when they are operating in a way\nthat benefits their owners or members at the expense of others. It looks at how government spending, taxes,\nand regulations affect decisions about production and consumption.\nIt should be clear by now that economics covers considerable ground. We can divide that ground into two\nparts:Microeconomicsfocuses on the actions of individual agents within the economy, like households,\nworkers, and businesses.Macroeconomicslooks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as\ngrowth of production, the number of unemployed people, the inflationary increase in prices, government\ndeficits, and levels of exports and imports. Microeconomics and macroeconomics are not separate subjects,\nbut rather complementary perspectives on the overall subject of the economy.\nTo understand why both microeconomic and macroeconomic perspectives are useful, consider the problem of\nstudying a biological ecosystem like a lake. One person who sets out to study the lake might focus on specific\ntopics: certain kinds of algae or plant life; the characteristics of particular fish or snails; or the trees\nsurrounding the lake. Another person might take an overall view and instead consider the lake's ecosystem\nfrom top to bottom; what eats what, how the system stays in a rough balance, and what environmental stresses\naffect this balance. Both approaches are useful, and both examine the same lake, but the viewpoints are\ndifferent. In a similar way, both microeconomics and macroeconomics study the same economy, but each has\na different viewpoint.\nWhether you are scrutinizing lakes or economics, the micro and the macro insights should blend with each\nother. In studying a lake, the micro insights about particular plants and animals help to understand the overall\nfood chain, while the macro insights about the overall food chain help to explain the environment in which\nindividual plants and animals live.\nIn economics, the micro decisions of individual businesses are influenced by whether the macroeconomy is\nhealthy. For example, firms will be more likely to hire workers if the overall economy is growing. In turn,\nmacroeconomy's performance ultimately depends on the microeconomic decisions that individual\nhouseholds and businesses make.\nMicroeconomics\nWhat determines how households and individuals spend their budgets? What combination of goods and\nservices will best fit their needs and wants, given the budget they have to spend? How do people decide\nwhether to work, and if so, whether to work full time or part time? How do people decide how much to save for\nthe future, or whether they should borrow to spend beyond their current means?\nWhat determines the products, and how many of each, a firm will produce and sell? What determines the 16 1 \u2022 Welcome to Economics!\nprices a firm will charge? What determines how a firm will produce its products? What determines how many\nworkers it will hire? How will a firm finance its business? When will a firm decide to expand, downsize, or even\nclose? In the microeconomics part of this book, we will learn about the theory of consumer behavior, the\ntheory of the firm, how markets for labor and other resources work, and how markets sometimes fail to work\nproperly.\nMacroeconomics\nWhat determines the level of economic activity in a society? In other words, what determines how many goods\nand services a nation actually produces? What determines how many jobs are available in an economy? What\ndetermines a nation\u2019s standard of living? What causes the economy to speed up or slow down? What causes\nfirms to hire more workers or to lay them off? Finally, what causes the economy to grow over the long term?\nWe can determine an economy's macroeconomic health by examining a number of goals: growth in the\nstandard of living, low unemployment, and low inflation, to name the most important. How can we use\ngovernment macroeconomic policy to pursue these goals? A nation's central bank conductsmonetary policy,\nwhich involves policies that affect bank lending, interest rates, and financial capital markets. For the United\nStates, this is the Federal Reserve. A nation's legislative body determinesfiscal policy, which involves\ngovernment spending and taxes. For the United States, this is the Congress and the executive branch, which\noriginates the federal budget. These are the government's main tools. Americans tend to expect that\ngovernment can fix whatever economic problems we encounter, but to what extent is that expectation\nrealistic? These are just some of the issues that we will explore in the macroeconomic chapters of this book.\n1.3How Economists Use Theories and Models to Understand Economic Issues\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Interpret a circular flow diagram\n\u2022 Explain the importance of economic theories and models\n\u2022 Describe goods and services markets and labor markets\nFIGURE1.6John Maynard KeynesOne of the most influential economists in modern times was John Maynard\nKeynes. (Credit: \u201cJohn Maynard Keynes\u201d by IMF/Wikimedia Commons, Public Domain)\nJohn Maynard Keynes(1883\u20131946), one of the greatest economists of the twentieth century, pointed out that\neconomics is not just a subject area but also a way of thinking. Keynes (Figure 1.6) famously wrote in the\nintroduction to a fellow economist\u2019s book: \u201c[Economics] is a method rather than a doctrine, an apparatus of the\nmind, a technique of thinking, which helps its possessor to draw correct conclusions.\u201d In other words,\neconomics teaches you how to think, not what to think.\nLINK IT UP\nWatch thisvideo(http://openstax.org/l/Keynes)about John Maynard Keynes and his influence on economics.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 1.3 \u2022 How Economists Use Theories and Models to Understand Economic Issues 17\nEconomists see the world through a different lens than anthropologists, biologists, classicists, or practitioners\nof any other discipline. They analyze issues and problems using economic theories that are based on\nparticular assumptions about human behavior. These assumptions tend to be different than the assumptions\nan anthropologist or psychologist might use. Atheoryis a simplified representation of how two or more\nvariables interact with each other. The purpose of a theory is to take a complex, real-world issue and simplify it\ndown to its essentials. If done well, this enables the analyst to understand the issue and any problems around\nit. A good theory is simple enough to understand, while complex enough to capture the key features of the\nobject or situation you are studying.\nSometimes economists use the termmodelinstead of theory. Strictly speaking, a theory is a more abstract\nrepresentation, while a model is a more applied or empirical representation. We use models to test theories,\nbut for this course we will use the terms interchangeably.\nFor example, an architect who is planning a major office building will often build a physical model that sits on\na tabletop to show how the entire city block will look after the new building is constructed. Companies often\nbuild models of their new products, which are more rough and unfinished than the final product, but can still\ndemonstrate how the new product will work.\nA good model to start with in economics is thecircular flow diagram(Figure 1.7). It pictures the economy as\nconsisting of two groups\u2014households and firms\u2014that interact in two markets: thegoods and services market\nin which firms sell and households buy and thelabor marketin which households sell labor to business firms\nor other employees.\nFIGURE1.7The Circular Flow DiagramThe circular flow diagram shows how households and firms interact in the\ngoods and services market, and in the labor market. The direction of the arrows shows that in the goods and\nservices market, households receive goods and services and pay firms for them. In the labor market, households\nprovide labor and receive payment from firms through wages, salaries, and benefits.\nFirms produce and sell goods and services to households in the market for goods and services (or product\nmarket). Arrow \u201cA\u201d indicates this. Households pay for goods and services, which becomes the revenues to\nfirms. Arrow \u201cB\u201d indicates this. Arrows A and B represent the two sides of the product market. Where do\nhouseholds obtain the income to buy goods and services? They provide the labor and other resources (e.g.,\nland, capital, raw materials) firms need to produce goods and services in the market for inputs (or factors of\nproduction). Arrow \u201cC\u201d indicates this. In return, firms pay for the inputs (or resources) they use in the form of\nwages and other factor payments. Arrow \u201cD\u201d indicates this. Arrows \u201cC\u201d and \u201cD\u201d represent the two sides of the\nfactor market.\nOf course, in the real world, there are many different markets for goods and services and markets for many\ndifferent types of labor. The circular flow diagram simplifies this to make the picture easier to grasp. In the\ndiagram, firms produce goods and services, which they sell to households in return for revenues. The outer\ncircle shows this, and represents the two sides of the product market (for example, the market for goods and 18 1 \u2022 Welcome to Economics!\nservices) in which households demand and firms supply. Households sell their labor as workers to firms in\nreturn for wages, salaries, and benefits. The inner circle shows this and represents the two sides of the labor\nmarket in which households supply and firms demand.\nThis version of the circular flow model is stripped down to the essentials, but it has enough features to explain\nhow the product and labor markets work in the economy. We could easily add details to this basic model if we\nwanted to introduce more real-world elements, like financial markets, governments, and interactions with the\nrest of the globe (imports and exports).\nEconomists carry a set of theories in their heads like a carpenter carries around a toolkit. When they see an\neconomic issue or problem, they go through the theories they know to see if they can find one that fits. Then\nthey use the theory to derive insights about the issue or problem. Economists express theories as diagrams,\ngraphs, or even as mathematical equations. (Do not worry. In this course, we will mostly use graphs.)\nEconomists do not figure out the answer to the problem first and then draw the graph to illustrate. Rather, they\nuse the graph of the theory to help them figure out the answer. Although at the introductory level, you can\nsometimes figure out the right answer without applying a model, if you keep studying economics, before too\nlong you will run into issues and problems that you will need to graph to solve. We explain both micro and\nmacroeconomics in terms of theories and models. The most well-known theories are probably those of supply\nand demand, but you will learn a number of others.\n1.4How To Organize Economies: An Overview of Economic Systems\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Contrast traditional economies, command economies, and market economies\n\u2022 Explain gross domestic product (GDP)\n\u2022 Assess the importance and effects of globalization\nThink about what a complex system a modern economy is. It includes all production of goods and services, all\nbuying and selling, all employment. The economic life of every individual is interrelated, at least to a small\nextent, with the economic lives of thousands or even millions of other individuals. Who organizes and\ncoordinates this system? Who ensures that, for example, the number of televisions a society provides is the\nsame as the amount it needs and wants? Who ensures that the right number of employees work in the\nelectronics industry? Who ensures that televisions are produced in the best way possible? How does it all get\ndone?\nThere are at least three ways that societies organize an economy. The first is thetraditional economy, which is\nthe oldest economic system and is used in parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. Traditional economies\norganize their economic affairs the way they have always done (i.e., tradition). Occupations stay in the family.\nMost families are farmers who grow the crops using traditional methods. What you produce is what you\nconsume. Because tradition drives the way of life, there is little economic progress or development.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 1.4 \u2022 How To Organize Economies: An Overview of Economic Systems 19\nFIGURE1.8A Command EconomyAncient Egypt was an example of a command economy. (Credit: \"Pyramids at\nGiza\" by Jay Bergesen/Flickr Creative Commons, CC BY 2.0)\nCommand economies are very different. In acommand economy, economic effort is devoted to goals passed\ndown from a ruler or ruling class. Ancient Egypt was a good example: a large part of economic life was devoted\nto building pyramids, like those inFigure 1.8, for the pharaohs. Medieval manor life is another example: the\nlord provided the land for growing crops and protection in the event of war. In return, vassals provided labor\nand soldiers to do the lord\u2019s bidding. In the last century, communism emphasized command economies.\nIn a command economy, the government decides what goods and services will be produced and what prices it\nwill charge for them. The government decides what methods of production to use and sets wages for workers.\nThe government provides many necessities like healthcare and education for free. Currently, Cuba and North\nKorea have command economies.\nFIGURE1.9A Market EconomyNothing says \u201cmarket\u201d more than The New York Stock Exchange. (Credit: work by\nErik Drost/Flickr Creative Commons, CC BY 2.0)\nAlthough command economies have a very centralized structure for economic decisions, market economies\nhave a very decentralized structure. Amarketis an institution that brings together buyers and sellers of goods\nor services, who may be either individuals or businesses. The New York Stock Exchange (Figure 1.9) is a prime\nexample of a market which brings buyers and sellers together. In amarket economy, decision-making is\ndecentralized. Market economies are based onprivate enterprise: the private individuals or groups of private\nindividuals own and operate the means of production (resources and businesses). Businesses supply goods\nand services based on demand. (In a command economy, by contrast, the government owns resources and\nbusinesses.) Supply of goods and services depends on what the demands are. A person\u2019s income is based on\ntheir ability to convert resources (especially labor) into something that society values. The more society values\nthe person\u2019s output, the higher the income (think Lady Gaga or LeBron James). In this scenario, market forces,\nnot governments, determine economic decisions.\nMost economies in the real world are mixed. They combine elements of command and market (and even\ntraditional) systems. The U.S. economy is positioned toward the market-oriented end of the spectrum. Many\ncountries in Europe and Latin America, while primarily market-oriented, have a greater degree of government 20 1 \u2022 Welcome to Economics!\ninvolvement in economic decisions than the U.S. economy. China and Russia, while over the past several\ndecades have moved more in the direction of having a market-oriented system, remain closer to the command\neconomy end of the spectrum. The Heritage Foundation provides perspective on countries\u2019 economic freedom,\nas the following Clear It Up feature discusses.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat countries are considered economically free?\nWho is in control of economic decisions? Are people free to do what they want and to work where they want? Are\nbusinesses free to produce when they want and what they choose, and to hire and fire as they wish? Are banks free\nto choose who will receive loans, or does the government control these kinds of choices? Each year, researchers at\nthe Heritage Foundation and theWall Street Journallook at 50 different categories of economic freedom for\ncountries around the world. They give each nation a score based on the extent of economic freedom in each\ncategory. Note that while the Heritage Foundation/WSJ index is widely cited by an array of scholars and\npublications, it should be regarded as only one viewpoint. Some experts indicate that the index\u2019s category choices\nand scores are politically biased. However, the index and others like it provide a useful resource for critical\ndiscussion of economic freedom.\nThe 2016 Heritage Foundation\u2019s Index of Economic Freedom report ranked 178 countries around the world:Table\n1.1lists some examples of the most free and the least free countries. Although technically not a separate country,\nHong Kong has been granted a degree of autonomy such that, for purposes of measuring economic statistics, it is\noften treated as a separate country. Several additional countries were not ranked because of extreme instability that\nmade judgments about economic freedom impossible. These countries include Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria,\nSomalia, and Yemen.\nThe assigned rankings are inevitably based on estimates, yet even these rough measures can be useful for\ndiscerning trends. In 2015, 101 of the 178 included countries shifted toward greater economic freedom, although\n77 of the countries shifted toward less economic freedom. In recent decades, the overall trend has been ahigher\nlevel of economic freedom around the world.\nMost Economic Freedom Least Economic Freedom\n1. Hong Kong 167. Timor-Leste\n2. Singapore 168.

There is no such thing as an absolutely free\nmarket. Regulations always define the \u201crules of the game\u201d in the economy. Economies that are primarily\nmarket-oriented have fewer regulations\u2014ideally just enough to maintain an even playing field for participants.\nAt a minimum, these laws govern matters like safeguarding private property against theft, protecting people\nfrom violence, enforcing legal contracts, preventing fraud, and collecting taxes. Conversely, even the most\ncommand-oriented economies operate using markets. How else would buying and selling occur? The\ngovernment heavily regulates decisions of what to produce and prices to charge. Heavily regulated economies\noften haveunderground economies(or black markets), which are markets where the buyers and sellers make\ntransactions without the government\u2019s approval.\nThe question of how to organize economic institutions is typically not a straightforward choice between all\nmarket or all government, but instead involves a balancing act over the appropriate combination of market\nfreedom and government rules.\nFIGURE1.10GlobalizationCargo ships are one mode of transportation for shipping goods in the global economy.\n(Credit: \"Cargo Ship\" by Raul Valdez/Flickr Creative Commons, CC BY 2.0)\nThe Rise of Globalization\nRecent decades have seen a trend towardglobalization, which is the expanding cultural, political, and\neconomic connections between people around the world. One measure of this is the increased buying and\nselling of goods, services, and assets across national borders\u2014in other words, international trade and financial\ncapital flows.\nGlobalization has occurred for a number of reasons. Improvements in shipping, as illustrated by the container\nship inFigure 1.10, and air cargo have driven down transportation costs. Innovations in computing and 22 1 \u2022 Welcome to Economics!\ntelecommunications have made it easier and cheaper to manage long-distance economic connections of\nproduction and sales. Many valuable products and services in the modern economy can take the form of\ninformation\u2014for example: computer software; financial advice; travel planning; music, books and movies; and\nblueprints for designing a building. These products and many others can be transported over telephones and\ncomputer networks at ever-lower costs. Finally, international agreements and treaties between countries have\nencouraged greater trade.\nTable 1.2presents one measure of globalization. It shows the percentage of domestic economic production\nthat was exported for a selection of countries from 2010 to 2015, according to an entity known as The World\nBank.Exportsare the goods and services that one produces domestically and sells abroad.Importsare the\ngoods and services that one produces abroad and then sells domestically.Gross domestic product (GDP)\nmeasures the size of total production in an economy. Thus, the ratio of exports divided by GDP measures what\nshare of a country\u2019s total economic production is sold in other countries.\nCountry 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015\nHigher Income Countries\nUnited States 12.4 13.6 13.6 13.5 13.5 12.6\nBelgium 76.2 81.4 82.2 82.8 84.0 84.4\nCanada 29.1 30.7 30.0 30.1 31.7 31.5\nFrance 26.0 27.8 28.1 28.3 29.0 30.0\nMiddle Income Countries\nBrazil 10.9 11.9 12.6 12.6 11.2 13.0\nMexico 29.9 31.2 32.6 31.7 32.3 35.3\nSouth Korea 49.4 55.7 56.3 53.9 50.3 45.9\nLower Income Countries\nChad 36.8 38.9 36.9 32.2 34.2 29.8\nChina 29.4 28.5 27.3 26.4 23.9 22.4\nIndia 22.0 23.9 24.0 24.8 22.9 -\nNigeria 25.3 31.3 31.4 18.0 18.4 -\nTABLE1.2The Extent of Globalization (exports/GDP)\n(Source: http://databank.worldbank.org/data/)\nIn recent decades, the export/GDP ratio has generally risen, both worldwide and for the U.S. economy.\nInterestingly, the share of U.S. exports in proportion to the U.S. economy is well below the global average, in\npart because large economies like the United States can contain more of the division of labor inside their\nnational borders. However, smaller economies like Belgium, Korea, and Canada need to trade across their\nborders with other countries to take full advantage of division of labor, specialization, and economies of scale.\nIn this sense, the enormous U.S. economy is less affected by globalization than most other countries.\nTable 1.2indicates that many medium and low income countries around the world, like Mexico and China,\nAccess for free at openstax.org 1.4 \u2022 How To Organize Economies: An Overview of Economic Systems 23\nhave also experienced a surge of globalization in recent decades. If an astronaut in orbit could put on special\nglasses that make all economic transactions visible as brightly colored lines and look down at Earth, the\nastronaut would see the planet covered with connections.\nDespite the rise in globalization over the last few decades, in recent years we've seen significant pushback\nagainst globalization from people across the world concerned about loss of jobs, loss of political sovereignty,\nand increased economic inequality. Prominent examples of this pushback include the 2016 vote in Great\nBritain to exit the European Union (i.e. Brexit), and the election of Donald J. Trump for President of the United\nStates.\nHopefully, you now have an idea about economics. Before you move to any other chapter of study, be sure to\nread the very important appendix to this chapter calledThe Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics. It\nis essential that you learn more about how to read and use models in economics.\nBRING IT HOME\nInformation Overload in the Information Age\nThe world provides nearly instant access to a wealth of information. Consider that as recently as the late 1970s, the\nFarmer\u2019s Almanac, along with the Weather Bureau of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, were the primary sources\nAmerican farmers used to determine when to plant and harvest their crops. Today, these decisions are driven by\ndata. Farmers access detailed data streams driven by global positioning systems, historical rainfall patterns, and\ncomplex weather monitoring services. They combine this information with crop yield data and soil quality\nmeasurements from prior years. Maximizing production efficiently can mean the difference between a farm that\nremains profitable and one that may need to sell its land, and data helps eliminate guesswork.\nInformation helps us make decisions as simple as what to wear today to how many reporters the media should send\nto cover an event. Each of these decisions is an economic decision. After all, resources are scarce. If the media send\nten reporters to cover an announcement, they are not available to cover other stories or complete other tasks.\nInformation provides the necessary knowledge to make the best possible decisions on how to utilize scarce\nresources.

A modern economy displays a division of labor, in which people earn income by\nspecializing in what they produce and then use that income to purchase the products they need or want. The\ndivision of labor allows individuals and firms to specialize and to produce more for several reasons: a) It allows\nthe agents to focus on areas of advantage due to natural factors and skill levels; b) It encourages the agents to\nlearn and invent; c) It allows agents to take advantage of economies of scale. Division and specialization of\nlabor only work when individuals can purchase what they do not produce in markets.

The microeconomic\nperspective focuses on parts of the economy: individuals, firms, and industries. The macroeconomic\nperspective looks at the economy as a whole, focusing on goals like growth in the standard of living,\nunemployment, and inflation. Macroeconomics has two types of policies for pursuing these goals: monetary\npolicy and fiscal policy.\n1.3How Economists Use Theories and Models to Understand Economic Issues\nEconomists analyze problems differently than do other disciplinary experts. The main tools economists use\nare economic theories or models. A theory is not an illustration of the answer to a problem. Rather, a theory is a\ntool for determining the answer.\n1.4How To Organize Economies: An Overview of Economic Systems\nWe can organize societies as traditional, command, or market-oriented economies.

The short answer: choices and tradeoffs. (Credit: modification of \"College of\nDuPage Commencement 2018 107\" by COD Newsroom/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nCHAPTER OBJECTIVES\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\u2022 How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget Constraint\n\u2022 The Production Possibilities Frontier and Social Choices\n\u2022 Confronting Objections to the Economic Approach\nIntroduction to Choice in a World of Scarcity\nBRING IT HOME\nChoices ... to What Degree?\nDoes your level of education impact earning? Let\u2019s look at some data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). In\n2020, among full-time wage and salary workers, median weekly earnings for those with a master\u2019s degree were\n$1,545. Multiply this average by 52 weeks, and you get average annual earnings of $80,340. Compare that to the 28 2 \u2022 Choice in a World of Scarcity\nmedian weekly earnings for full-time workers aged 25 and over with just a bachelor\u2019s degree: $1,305 weekly and\n$67,860 a year. What about those with no higher than a high school diploma in 2020? They earn an average of just\n$781 weekly and $40,612 over 12 months. In other words, data from the BLS indicates that receiving a bachelor\u2019s\ndegree boosts earnings by 67% over what workers would have earned if they only obtained a high school diploma,\nand a master\u2019s degree yields average earnings that are nearly double those of workers with a high school diploma.\nGiven these statistics, we might expect many people to choose to go to college and at least earn a bachelor\u2019s\ndegree. Assuming that people want to improve their material well-being, it seems like they would make those\nchoices that provide them with the greatest opportunity to consume goods and services. As it turns out, the analysis\nis not nearly as simple as this. In fact, in 2019, the BLS reported that while just over 90% of the population aged 25\nand over in the United States had a high school diploma, only 36% of those aged 25 and over had a bachelor's or\nhigher degree, and only 13.5% had earned a master's or higher degree.\nThis brings us to the subject of this chapter: why people make the choices they make and how economists explain\nthose choices.\nYou will learn quickly when you examine the relationship between economics and scarcity that choices involve\ntradeoffs. Every choice has a cost.\nIn 1968, the Rolling Stones recorded \u201cYou Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want.\u201d Economists chuckled, because\nthey had been singing a similar tune for decades. English economist Lionel Robbins (1898\u20131984), in hisEssay\non the Nature and Significance of Economic Sciencein 1932, described not always getting what you want in\nthis way:\nThe time at our disposal is limited. There are only twenty-four hours in the day. We have to choose\nbetween the different uses to which they may be put. ... Everywhere we turn, if we choose one thing we\nmust relinquish others which, in different circumstances, we would wish not to have relinquished.\nScarcity of means to satisfy given ends is an almost ubiquitous condition of human nature.\nBecause people live in a world of scarcity, they cannot have all the time, money, possessions, and experiences\nthey wish. Neither can society.\nThis chapter will continue our discussion of scarcity and the economic way of thinking by first introducing\nthree critical concepts: opportunity cost, marginal decision making, and diminishing returns. Later, it will\nconsider whether the economic way of thinking accurately describes either how wemakechoices and how we\nshouldmake them.\n2.1How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget Constraint\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Calculate and graph budget constraints\n\u2022 Explain opportunity sets and opportunity costs\n\u2022 Evaluate the law of diminishing marginal utility\n\u2022 Explain how marginal analysis and utility influence choices\nConsider the typical consumer\u2019s budget problem. Consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the\nthings they need and want. Suppose Alphonso has $10 in spending money each week that he can allocate\nbetween bus tickets for getting to work and the burgers that he eats for lunch. Burgers cost $2 each, and bus\ntickets are 50 cents each. We can see Alphonso's budget problem inFigure 2.2.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.1 \u2022 How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget Constraint 29\nFIGURE2.2The Budget Constraint: Alphonso\u2019s Consumption Choice Opportunity FrontierEach point on the\nbudget constraint represents a combination of burgers and bus tickets whose total cost adds up to Alphonso\u2019s\nbudget of $10. The relative price of burgers and bus tickets determines the slope of the budget constraint. All along\nthe budget set, giving up one burger means gaining four bus tickets.\nThe vertical axis in the figure shows burger purchases and the horizontal axis shows bus ticket purchases. If\nAlphonso spends all his money on burgers, he can afford five per week. ($10 per week/$2 per burger = 5\nburgers per week.) However, if he does this, he will not be able to afford any bus tickets. Point A in the figure\nshows the choice (zero bus tickets and five burgers). Alternatively, if Alphonso spends all his money on bus\ntickets, he can afford 20 per week. ($10 per week/$0.50 per bus ticket = 20 bus tickets per week.) Then,\nhowever, he will not be able to afford any burgers. Point F shows this alternative choice (20 bus tickets and zero\nburgers).\nIf we connect all the points between A and F, we get Alphonso'sbudget constraint. This indicates all the\ncombination of burgers and bus tickets Alphonso can afford, given the price of the two goods and his budget\namount.\nIf Alphonso is like most people, he will choose some combination that includes both bus tickets and burgers.\nThat is, he will choose some combination on the budget constraint that is between points A and F. Every point\non (or inside) the constraint shows a combination of burgers and bus tickets that Alphonso can afford. Any\npoint outside the constraint is not affordable, because it would cost more money than Alphonso has in his\nbudget.\nThe budget constraint clearly shows the tradeoff Alphonso faces in choosing between burgers and bus tickets.\nSuppose he is currently at point D, where he can afford 12 bus tickets and two burgers. What would it cost\nAlphonso for one more burger? It would be natural to answer $2, but that\u2019s not the way economists think.\nInstead they ask, how many bus tickets would Alphonso have to give up to get one more burger, while staying\nwithin his budget? Since bus tickets cost 50 cents, Alphonso would have to give up four to afford one more\nburger. That is the true cost to Alphonso.\nThe Concept of Opportunity Cost\nEconomists use the termopportunity costto indicate what people must give up to obtain what they desire.\nThe idea behind opportunity cost is that the cost of one item is the lost opportunity to do or consume\nsomething else. In short, opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative. For Alphonso, the\nopportunity cost of a burger is the four bus tickets he would have to give up. He would decide whether or not to\nchoose the burger depending on whether the value of the burger exceeds the value of the forgone\nalternative\u2014in this case, bus tickets. Since people must choose, they inevitably face tradeoffs in which they\nhave to give up things they desire to obtain other things they desire more.\nLINK IT UP\nView thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/linestanding)for an example of opportunity cost\u2014paying someone else\nto wait in line for you. 30 2 \u2022 Choice in a World of Scarcity\nA fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost. If you sleep through your\neconomics class, the opportunity cost is the learning you miss from not attending class. If you spend your\nincome on video games, you cannot spend it on movies. If you choose to marry one person, you give up the\nopportunity to marry anyone else. In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\nThe following Work It Out feature shows a step-by-step analysis of a budget constraint calculation. Read\nthrough it to understand another important concept\u2014slope\u2014that we further explain in the appendixThe Use\nof Mathematics in Principles of Economics.\nWORK IT OUT\nUnderstanding Budget Constraints\nBudget constraints are easy to understand if you apply a little math. The appendixThe Use of Mathematics in\nPrinciples of Economicsexplains all the math you are likely to need in this book. Therefore, if math is not your\nstrength, you might want to take a look at the appendix.\nStep 1: The equation for any budget constraint is:\nwhere P and Q are the price and quantity of items purchased (which we assume here to be two items) and\nBudget is the amount of income one has to spend.\nStep 2. Apply the budget constraint equation to the scenario. In Alphonso\u2019s case, this works out to be:\nStep 3. Using a little algebra, we can turn this into the familiar equation of a line:\nFor Alphonso, this is:\nStep 4. Simplify the equation. Begin by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:\nStep 5. Subtract one bus ticket from both sides:\nDivide each side by 4 to yield the answer:\nStep 6. Notice that this equation fits the budget constraint inFigure 2.2. The vertical intercept is 5 and the slope\nis \u20130.25, just as the equation says. If you plug 20 bus tickets into the equation, you get 0 burgers. If you plug\nother numbers of bus tickets into the equation, you get the results (seeTable 2.1), which are the points on\nAlphonso\u2019s budget constraint.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.1 \u2022 How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget Constraint 31\nPoint Quantity of Burgers (at $2) Quantity of Bus Tickets (at 50 cents)\nA 5 0\nB 4 4\nC 3 8\nD 2 12\nE 1 16\nF 0 20\nTABLE2.1\nStep 7. Notice that the slope of a budget constraint always shows the opportunity cost of the good which is on\nthe horizontal axis. For Alphonso, the slope is \u22120.25, indicating that for every bus ticket he buys, he must give up\n1/4 burger. To phrase it differently, for every four tickets he buys, Alphonso must give up 1 burger.\nThere are two important observations here. First, the algebraic sign of the slope is negative, which means that\nthe only way to get more of one good is to give up some of the other. Second, we define the slope as the price of\nbus tickets (whatever is on the horizontal axis in the graph) divided by the price of burgers (whatever is on the\nvertical axis), in this case $0.50/$2 = 0.25. If you want to determine the opportunity cost quickly, just divide the\ntwo prices.\nIdentifying Opportunity Cost\nIn many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as theprice. If your cousin buys a new bicycle for\n$300, then $300 measures the amount of \u201cother consumption\u201d that he has forsaken. For practical purposes,\nthere may be no special need to identify the specific alternative product or products that he could have bought\nwith that $300, but sometimes the price as measured in dollars may not accurately capture the true\nopportunity cost. This problem can loom especially large when costs of time are involved.\nFor example, consider a boss who decides that all employees will attend a two-day retreat to \u201cbuild team\nspirit.\u201d The out-of-pocket monetary cost of the event may involve hiring an outside consulting firm to run the\nretreat, as well as room and board for all participants. However, an opportunity cost exists as well: during the\ntwo days of the retreat, none of the employees are doing any other work.\nAttending college is another case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. The out-of-pocket\ncosts of attending college include tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. However, in addition,\nduring the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a paying job. Thus,\ncollege imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost earnings.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat is the opportunity cost associated with increased airport security measures?\nAfter the terrorist plane hijackings on September 11, 2001, many steps were proposed to improve air travel safety.\nFor example, the federal government could provide armed \u201csky marshals\u201d who would travel inconspicuously with\nthe rest of the passengers. The cost of having a sky marshal on every flight would be roughly $3 billion per year.\nRetrofitting all U.S. planes with reinforced cockpit doors to make it harder for terrorists to take over the plane would 32 2 \u2022 Choice in a World of Scarcity\nhave a price tag of $450 million. Buying more sophisticated security equipment for airports, like three-dimensional\nbaggage scanners and cameras linked to face recognition software, could cost another $2 billion.\nHowever, the single biggest cost of greater airline security does not involve spending money. It is the opportunity\ncost of additional waiting time at the airport. According to the United States Department of Transportation (DOT),\nthere were 895.5 million systemwide (domestic and international) scheduled service passengers in 2015. Since the\n9/11 hijackings, security screening has become more intensive, and consequently, the procedure takes longer than\nin the past. Say that, on average, each air passenger spends an extra 30 minutes in the airport per trip. Economists\ncommonly place a value on time to convert an opportunity cost in time into a monetary figure. Because many air\ntravelers are relatively high-paid business people, conservative estimates set the average price of time for air\ntravelers at $20 per hour. By these back-of-the-envelope calculations, the opportunity cost of delays in airports\ncould be as much as 800 million \u00d7 0.5 hours \u00d7 $20/hour, or $8 billion per year. Clearly, the opportunity costs of\nwaiting time can be just as important as costs that involve direct spending.\nIn some cases, realizing the opportunity cost can alter behavior. Imagine, for example, that you spend $8 on\nlunch every day at work. You may know perfectly well that bringing a lunch from home would cost only $3 a\nday, so the opportunity cost of buying lunch at the restaurant is $5 each day (that is, the $8 buying lunch costs\nminus the $3 your lunch from home would cost). Five dollars each day does not seem to be that much.\nHowever, if you project what that adds up to in a year\u2014250 days a year \u00d7 $5 per day equals $1,250, the cost,\nperhaps, of a decent vacation. If you describe the opportunity cost as \u201ca nice vacation\u201d instead of \u201c$5 a day,\u201d\nyou might make different choices.\nMarginal Decision-Making and Diminishing Marginal Utility\nThe budget constraint framework helps to emphasize that most choices in the real world are not about getting\nall of one thing or all of another; that is, they are not about choosing either the point at one end of the budget\nconstraint or else the point all the way at the other end. Instead, most choices involvemarginal analysis,\nwhich means examining the benefits and costs of choosing a little more or a little less of a good. People\nnaturally compare costs and benefits, but often we look at total costs and total benefits, when the optimal\nchoice necessitates comparing how costs and benefits change from one option to another. You might think of\nmarginal analysis as \u201cchange analysis.\u201d Marginal analysis is used throughout economics.\nWe now turn to the notion ofutility. People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility those goods\nand services provide. Utility, as we will see in the chapter onConsumer Choices, is subjective but that does not\nmake it less real. Economists typically assume that the more of some good one consumes (for example, slices\nof pizza), the more utility one obtains. At the same time, the utility a person receives from consuming the first\nunit of a good is typically more than the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same\ngood. When Alphonso chooses between burgers and bus tickets, for example, the first few bus rides that he\nchooses might provide him with a great deal of utility\u2014perhaps they help him get to a job interview or a\ndoctor\u2019s appointment. However, later bus rides might provide much less utility\u2014they may only serve to kill\ntime on a rainy day. Similarly, the first burger that Alphonso chooses to buy may be on a day when he missed\nbreakfast and is ravenously hungry. However, if Alphonso has multiple burgers every day, the last few burgers\nmay taste pretty boring. The general pattern that consumption of the first few units of any good tends to bring\na higher level of utility to a person than consumption of later units is a common pattern. Economists refer to\nthis pattern as thelaw of diminishing marginal utility, which means that as a person receives more of a good,\nthe additional (or marginal) utility from each additional unit of the good declines. In other words, the first slice\nof pizza brings more satisfaction than the sixth.\nThe law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing choices.\nYou would not say, \u201cMy favorite food is ice cream, so I will eat nothing but ice cream from now on.\u201d Instead,\neven if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the additional or\nmarginal utility from those last few servings would not be very high. Similarly, most workers do not say: \u201cI\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.2 \u2022 The Production Possibilities Frontier and Social Choices 33\nenjoy leisure, so I\u2019ll never work.\u201d Instead, workers recognize that even though some leisure is very nice, a\ncombination of all leisure and no income is not so attractive. The budget constraint framework suggests that\nwhen people make choices in a world of scarcity, they will use marginal analysis and think about whether they\nwould prefer a little more or a little less.\nA rational consumer would only purchase additional units of some product as long as the marginal utility\nexceeds the opportunity cost. Suppose Alphonso moves down his budget constraint from Point A to Point B to\nPoint C and further. As he consumes more bus tickets, the marginal utility of bus tickets will diminish, while\nthe opportunity cost, that is, the marginal utility of foregone burgers, will increase. Eventually, the opportunity\ncost will exceed the marginal utility of an additional bus ticket. If Alphonso is rational, he won\u2019t purchase more\nbus tickets once the marginal utility just equals the opportunity cost. While we can\u2019t (yet) say exactly how many\nbus tickets Alphonso will buy, that number is unlikely to be the most he can afford, 20.\nSunk Costs\nIn the budget constraint framework, all decisions involve what will happen next: that is, what quantities of\ngoods will you consume, how many hours will you work, or how much will you save. These decisions do not\nlook back to past choices. Thus, the budget constraint framework assumes thatsunk costs, which are costs\nthat were incurred in the past and cannot be recovered, should not affect the current decision.\nConsider the case of Selena, who pays $8 to see a movie, but after watching the film for 30 minutes, she knows\nthat it is truly terrible. Should she stay and watch the rest of the movie because she paid for the ticket, or\nshould she leave? The money she spent is a sunk cost, and unless the theater manager is sympathetic, Selena\nwill not get a refund. However, staying in the movie still means paying an opportunity cost in time. Her choice\nis whether to spend the next 90 minutes suffering through a cinematic disaster or to do\nsomething\u2014anything\u2014else. The lesson of sunk costs is to forget about the money and time that is irretrievably\ngone and instead to focus on the marginal costs and benefits of current and future options.\nFor people and firms alike, dealing with sunk costs can be frustrating. It often means admitting an earlier error\nin judgment. Many firms, for example, find it hard to give up on a new product that is doing poorly because\nthey spent so much money in creating and launching the product. However, the lesson of sunk costs is to\nignore them and make decisions based on what will happen in the future.\nFrom a Model with Two Goods to One of Many Goods\nThe budget constraint diagram containing just two goods, like most models used in this book, is not realistic.\nAfter all, in a modern economy people choose from thousands of goods. However, thinking about a model with\nmany goods is a straightforward extension of what we discussed here. Instead of drawing just one budget\nconstraint, showing the tradeoff between two goods, you can draw multiple budget constraints, showing the\npossible tradeoffs between many different pairs of goods. In more advanced classes in economics, you would\nuse mathematical equations that include many possible goods and services that can be purchased, together\nwith their quantities and prices, and show how the total spending on all goods and services is limited to the\noverall budget available. The graph with two goods that we presented here clearly illustrates that every choice\nhas an opportunity cost, which is the point that does carry over to the real world.\n2.2The Production Possibilities Frontier and Social Choices\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Interpret production possibilities frontier graphs\n\u2022 Contrast a budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier\n\u2022 Explain the relationship between a production possibilities frontier and the law of diminishing returns\n\u2022 Contrast productive efficiency and allocative efficiency\n\u2022 Define comparative advantage 34 2 \u2022 Choice in a World of Scarcity\nJust as individuals cannot have everything they want and must instead make choices, society as a whole\ncannot have everything it might want, either. This section of the chapter will explain the constraints society\nfaces, using a model called theproduction possibilities frontier (PPF). There are more similarities than\ndifferences between individual choice and social choice. As you read this section, focus on the similarities.\nBecause society has limited resources (e.g., labor, land, capital, raw materials) at any point in time, there is a\nlimit to the quantities of goods and services it can produce. Suppose a society desires two products, healthcare\nand education. The production possibilities frontier inFigure 2.3illustrates this situation.\nFIGURE2.3A Healthcare vs. Education Production Possibilities FrontierThis production possibilities frontier\nshows a tradeoff between devoting social resources to healthcare and devoting them to education. At A all\nresources go to healthcare and at B, most go to healthcare. At D most resources go to education, and at F, all go to\neducation.\nFigure 2.3shows healthcare on the vertical axis and education on the horizontal axis. If the society were to\nallocate all of its resources to healthcare, it could produce at point A. However, it would not have any resources\nto produce education. If it were to allocate all of its resources to education, it could produce at point F.\nAlternatively, the society could choose to produce any combination of healthcare and education on the\nproduction possibilities frontier. In effect, the production possibilities frontier plays the same role for society\nas the budget constraint plays for Alphonso. Society can choose any combination of the two goods on or inside\nthe PPF. However, it does not have enough resources to produce outside the PPF.\nMost importantly, the production possibilities frontier clearly shows the tradeoff between healthcare and\neducation. Suppose society has chosen to operate at point B, and it is considering producing more education.\nBecause the PPF is downward sloping from left to right, the only way society can obtain more education is by\ngiving up some healthcare. That is the tradeoff society faces. Suppose it considers moving from point B to\npoint C. What would the opportunity cost be for the additional education? The opportunity cost would be the\nhealthcare society has to forgo. Just as with Alphonso\u2019s budget constraint, theslopeof the production\npossibilities frontier shows the opportunity cost. By now you might be saying, \u201cHey, this PPF is sounding like\nthe budget constraint.\u201d If so, read the following Clear It Up feature.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat\u2019s the difference between a budget constraint and a PPF?\nThere are two major differences between a budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier. The first is the\nfact that the budget constraint is a straight line. This is because its slope is given by the relative prices of the two\ngoods, which from the point of view of an individual consumer, are fixed, so the slope doesn't change. In contrast,\nthe PPF has a curved shape because of the law of the diminishing returns. Thus, the slope is different at various\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.2 \u2022 The Production Possibilities Frontier and Social Choices 35\npoints on the PPF. The second major difference is the absence of specific numbers on the axes of the PPF. There are\nno specific numbers because we do not know the exact amount of resources this imaginary economy has, nor do we\nknow how many resources it takes to produce healthcare and how many resources it takes to produce education. If\nthis were a real world example, that data would be available.\nWhether or not we have specific numbers, conceptually we can measure the opportunity cost of additional\neducation as society moves from point B to point C on the PPF. We measure the additional education by the\nhorizontal distance between B and C. The foregone healthcare is given by the vertical distance between B and C. The\nslope of the PPF between B and C is (approximately) the vertical distance (the \u201crise\u201d) over the horizontal distance\n(the \u201crun\u201d). This is the opportunity cost of the additional education.\nThe PPF and the Law of Increasing Opportunity Cost\nThe budget constraints that we presented earlier in this chapter, showing individual choices about what\nquantities of goods to consume, were all straight lines. The reason for these straight lines was that the relative\nprices of the two goods in theconsumption budget constraintdetermined the slope of the budget constraint.\nHowever, we drew the production possibilities frontier for healthcare and education as a curved line. Why does\nthe PPF have a different shape?\nTo understand why the PPF is curved, start by considering point A at the top left-hand side of the PPF. At point\nA, all available resources are devoted to healthcare and none are left for education. This situation would be\nextreme and even ridiculous. For example, children are seeing a doctor every day, whether they are sick or not,\nbut not attending school. People are having cosmetic surgery on every part of their bodies, but no high school\nor college education exists. Now imagine that some of these resources are diverted from healthcare to\neducation, so that the economy is at point B instead of point A. Diverting some resources away from A to B\ncauses relatively little reduction in health because the last few marginal dollars going into healthcare services\nare not producing much additional gain in health. However, putting those marginal dollars into education,\nwhich is completely without resources at point A, can produce relatively large gains. For this reason, the shape\nof the PPF from A to B is relatively flat, representing a relatively small drop-off in health and a relatively large\ngain in education.\nNow consider the other end, at the lower right, of the production possibilities frontier. Imagine that society\nstarts at choice D, which is devoting nearly all resources to education and very few to healthcare, and moves to\npoint F, which is devotingallspending to education and none to healthcare. For the sake of concreteness, you\ncan imagine that in the movement from D to F, the last few doctors must become high school science teachers,\nthe last few nurses must become school librarians rather than dispensers of vaccinations, and the last few\nemergency rooms are turned into kindergartens. The gains to education from adding these last few resources\nto education are very small. However, the opportunity cost lost to health will be fairly large, and thus the slope\nof the PPF between D and F is steep, showing a large drop in health for only a small gain in education.\nThe lesson is not that society is likely to make an extreme choice like devoting no resources to education at\npoint A or no resources to health at point F. Instead, the lesson is that the gains from committing additional\nmarginal resources to education depend on how much is already being spent. If on the one hand, very few\nresources are currently committed to education, then an increase in resources used for education can bring\nrelatively large gains. On the other hand, if a large number of resources are already committed to education,\nthen committing additional resources will bring relatively smaller gains.\nThis pattern is common enough that economists have given it a name:the law of increasing opportunity cost,\nwhich holds that as production of a good or service increases, the marginal opportunity cost of producing it\nincreases as well. This happens because some resources are better suited for producing certain goods and\nservices instead of others. When government spends a certain amount more on reducing crime, for example,\nthe original increase in opportunity cost of reducing crime could be relatively small. However, additional 36 2 \u2022 Choice in a World of Scarcity\nincreases typically cause relatively larger increases in the opportunity cost of reducing crime, and paying for\nenough police and security to reduce crime to nothing at all would be a tremendously high opportunity cost.\nThe curvature of the production possibilities frontier shows that as we add more resources to education,\nmoving from left to right along the horizontal axis, the original increase in opportunity cost is fairly small, but\ngradually increases. Thus, the slope of the PPF is relatively flat near the vertical-axis intercept. Conversely, as\nwe add more resources to healthcare, moving from bottom to top on the vertical axis, the original declines in\nopportunity cost are fairly large, but again gradually diminish. Thus, the slope of the PPF is relatively steep\nnear the horizontal-axis intercept. In this way, the law of increasing opportunity cost produces the outward-\nbending shape of the production possibilities frontier.\nProductive Efficiency and Allocative Efficiency\nThe study of economics does not presume to tell a society what choice it should make along its production\npossibilities frontier. In a market-oriented economy with a democratic government, the choice will involve a\nmixture of decisions by individuals, firms, and government. However, economics can point out that some\nchoices are unambiguously better than others. This observation is based on the concept of efficiency. In\neveryday usage, efficiency refers to lack of waste. An inefficient machine operates at highcost, while an\nefficient machine operates at lower cost, because it is not wasting energy or materials. An inefficient\norganization operates with long delays and high costs, while an efficient organization meets schedules, is\nfocused, and performs within budget.\nThe production possibilities frontier can illustrate two kinds of efficiency: productive efficiency and allocative\nefficiency.Figure 2.4illustrates these ideas using a production possibilities frontier between healthcare and\neducation.\nFIGURE2.4Productive and Allocative EfficiencyProductive efficiency means it is impossible to produce more of\none good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good. Thus, all choices along a given PPF like\nB, C, and D display productive efficiency, but R does not. Allocative efficiency means that the particular mix of goods\nbeing produced\u2014that is, the specific choice along the production possibilities frontier\u2014represents the allocation\nthat society most desires.\nProductive efficiencymeans that, given the available inputs and technology, it is impossible to produce more\nof one good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good. All choices on the PPF inFigure\n2.4, including A, B, C, D, and F, display productive efficiency. As a firm moves from any one of these choices to\nany other, either healthcare increases and education decreases or vice versa. However, any choice inside the\nproduction possibilities frontier is productively inefficient and wasteful because it is possible to produce more\nof one good, the other good, or some combination of both goods.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.2 \u2022 The Production Possibilities Frontier and Social Choices 37\nFor example, point R is productively inefficient because it is possible at choice C to have more of both goods:\neducation on the horizontal axis is higher at point C than point R (E is greater than E ), and healthcare on the\n2 1\nvertical axis is also higher at point C than point R (H is great than H ).\n2 1\nWe can show the particular mix of goods and services produced\u2014that is, the specific combination of selected\nhealthcare and education along the production possibilities frontier\u2014as a ray (line) from the origin to a specific\npoint on the PPF. Output mixes that had more healthcare (and less education) would have a steeper ray, while\nthose with more education (and less healthcare) would have a flatter ray.\nAllocative efficiencymeans that the particular combination of goods and services on the production\npossibility curve that a society produces represents the combination that society most desires. How to\ndetermine what a society desires can be a controversial question, and is usually a discussion in political\nscience, sociology, and philosophy classes as well as in economics. At its most basic, allocative efficiency\nmeans producers supply the quantity of each product that consumers demand. Only one of the productively\nefficient choices will be the allocatively efficient choice for society as a whole.\nWhy Society Must Choose\nInWelcome to Economics!we learned that every society faces the problem of scarcity, where limited resources\nconflict with unlimited needs and wants. The production possibilities curve illustrates the choices involved in\nthis dilemma.\nEvery economy faces two situations in which it may be able to expand consumption of all goods. In the first\ncase, a society may discover that it has been using its resources inefficiently, in which case by improving\nefficiency and producing on the production possibilities frontier, it can have more of all goods (or at least more\nof some and less of none). In the second case, as resources grow over a period of years (e.g., more labor and\nmore capital), the economy grows. As it does, the production possibilities frontier for a society will tend to shift\noutward and society will be able to afford more of all goods. In addition, over time, improvements in\ntechnology can increase the level of production with given resources, and hence push out the PPF.\nHowever, improvements in productive efficiency take time to discover and implement, and economic growth\nhappens only gradually. Thus, a society must choose between tradeoffs in the present. For government, this\nprocess often involves trying to identify where additional spending could do the most good and where\nreductions in spending would do the least harm. At the individual andfirmlevel, themarket economy\ncoordinates a process in which firms seek to produce goods and services in the quantity, quality, and price that\npeople want. However, for both the government and the market economy in the short term, increases in\nproduction of one good typically mean offsetting decreases somewhere else in the economy.\nThe PPF and Comparative Advantage\nWhile every society must choose how much of each good or service it should produce, it does not need to\nproduce every single good it consumes. Often how much of a good a country decides to produce depends on\nhow expensive it is to produce it versus buying it from a different country. As we saw earlier, the curvature of a\ncountry\u2019s PPF gives us information about the tradeoff between devoting resources to producing one good\nversus another. In particular, its slope gives the opportunity cost of producing one more unit of the good in the\nx-axis in terms of the other good (in the y-axis). Countries tend to have different opportunity costs of producing\na specific good, either because of different climates, geography, technology, or skills.\nSuppose two countries, the US and Brazil, need to decide how much they will produce of two crops: sugar cane\nand wheat. Due to its climatic conditions, Brazil can produce quite a bit of sugar cane per acre but not much\nwheat. Conversely, the U.S. can produce large amounts of wheat per acre, but not much sugar cane. Clearly,\nBrazil has a lower opportunity cost of producing sugar cane (in terms of wheat) than the U.S. The reverse is\nalso true: the U.S. has a lower opportunity cost of producing wheat than Brazil. We illustrate this by the PPFs of\nthe two countries inFigure 2.5. 38 2 \u2022 Choice in a World of Scarcity\nFIGURE2.5Production Possibility Frontier for the U.S. and BrazilThe U.S. PPF is flatter than the Brazil PPF implying\nthat the opportunity cost of wheat in terms of sugar cane is lower in the U.S. than in Brazil. Conversely, the\nopportunity cost of sugar cane is lower in Brazil. The U.S. has comparative advantage in wheat and Brazil has\ncomparative advantage in sugar cane.\nWhen a country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another country, we say that this country\nhas acomparative advantagein that good. Comparative advantage is not the same as absolute advantage,\nwhich is when a country can produce more of a good. In our example, Brazil has an absolute advantage in\nsugar cane and the U.S. has an absolute advantage in wheat. One can easily see this with a simple observation\nof the extreme production points in the PPFs of the two countries. If Brazil devoted all of its resources to\nproducing wheat, it would be producing at point A. If however it had devoted all of its resources to producing\nsugar cane instead, it would be producing a much larger amount than the U.S., at point B.\nThe slope of the PPF gives the opportunity cost of producing an additional unit of wheat. While the slope is not\nconstant throughout the PPFs, it is quite apparent that the PPF in Brazil is much steeper than in the U.S., and\ntherefore the opportunity cost of wheat is generally higher in Brazil. In the chapter onInternational Tradeyou\nwill learn that countries\u2019 differences in comparative advantage determine which goods they will choose to\nproduce and trade. When countries engage in trade, they specialize in the production of the goods in which\nthey have comparative advantage, and trade part of that production for goods in which they do not have\ncomparative advantage. With trade, manufacturers produce goods where the opportunity cost is lowest, so\ntotal production increases, benefiting both trading parties.\n2.3Confronting Objections to the Economic Approach\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Analyze arguments against economic approaches to decision-making\n\u2022 Interpret a tradeoff diagram\n\u2022 Contrast normative statements and positive statements\nIt is one thing to understand the economic approach to decision-making and another thing to feel comfortable\napplying it. The sources of discomfort typically fall into two categories: that people do not act in the way that\nfits the economic way of thinking, and that even if people did act that way, they should try not to. Let\u2019s consider\nthese arguments in turn.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.3 \u2022 Confronting Objections to the Economic Approach 39\nFirst Objection: People, Firms, and Society Do Not Act Like This\nThe economic approach to decision-making seems to require more information than most individuals possess\nand more careful decision-making than most individuals actually display. After all, do you or any of your\nfriends draw a budget constraint and mutter to yourself about maximizing utility before you head to the\nshopping mall? Do members of the U.S. Congress contemplate production possibilities frontiers before they\nvote on the annual budget? The messy ways in which people and societies operate somehow doesn\u2019t look much\nlike neat budget constraints or smoothly curving production possibilities frontiers.\nHowever, the economics approach can be a useful way to analyze and understand the tradeoffs of economic\ndecisions. To appreciate this point, imagine for a moment that you are playing basketball, dribbling to the\nright, and throwing a bounce-pass to the left to a teammate who is running toward the basket. A physicist or\nengineer could work out the correct speed and trajectory for the pass, given the different movements involved\nand the weight and bounciness of the ball. However, when you are playing basketball, you do not perform any\nof these calculations. You just pass the ball, and if you are a good player, you will do so with high accuracy.\nSomeone might argue: \u201cThe scientist\u2019s formula of the bounce-pass requires a far greater knowledge of physics\nand far more specific information about speeds of movement and weights than the basketball player actually\nhas, so it must be an unrealistic description of how basketball passes actually occur.\u201d This reaction would be\nwrongheaded. The fact that a good player can throw the ball accurately because of practice and skill, without\nmaking a physics calculation, does not mean that the physics calculation is wrong.\nSimilarly, from an economic point of view, someone who shops for groceries every week has a great deal of\npractice with how to purchase the combination of goods that will provide that person with utility, even if the\nshopper does not phrase decisions in terms of a budget constraint. Government institutions may work\nimperfectly and slowly, but in general, a democratic form of government feels pressure from voters and social\ninstitutions to make the choices that are most widely preferred by people in that society. Thus, when thinking\nabout the economic actions of groups of people, firms, and society, it is reasonable, as a first approximation, to\nanalyze them with the tools of economic analysis. For more on this, read about behavioral economics in the\nchapter onConsumer Choices.\nSecond Objection: People, Firms, and Society Should Not Act This Way\nThe economics approach portrays people as self-interested. For some critics of this approach, even if self-\ninterest is an accurate description of how people behave, these behaviors are not moral. Instead, the critics\nargue that people should be taught to care more deeply about others. Economists offer several answers to\nthese concerns.\nFirst, economics is not a form of moral instruction. Rather, it seeks to describe economic behavior as it actually\nexists. Philosophers draw a distinction betweenpositive statements, which describe the world as it is, and\nnormative statements, which describe how the world should be. Positive statements are factual. They may be\ntrue or false, but we can test them, at least in principle. Normative statements are subjective questions of\nopinion. We cannot test them since we cannot prove opinions to be true or false. They just are opinions based\non one's values. For example, an economist could analyze a proposed subway system in a certain city. If the\nexpected benefits exceed the costs, he concludes that the project is worthy\u2014an example of positive analysis.\nAnother economist argues for extended unemployment compensation during the COVID-19 pandemic\nbecause a rich country like the United States should take care of its less fortunate citizens\u2014an example of\nnormative analysis.\nEven if the line between positive and normative statements is not always crystal clear, economic analysis does\ntry to remain rooted in the study of the actual people who inhabit the actual economy. Fortunately however, the\nassumption that individuals are purely self-interested is a simplification about human nature. In fact, we need\nto look no further than toAdam Smith, the very father of modern economics to find evidence of this. The\nopening sentence of his book,The Theory of Moral Sentiments, puts it very clearly: \u201cHow selfish soever man 40 2 \u2022 Choice in a World of Scarcity\nmay be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of\nothers, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of\nseeing it.\u201d Clearly, individuals are both self-interested and altruistic.\nSecond, we can label self-interested behavior and profit-seeking with other names, such as personal choice\nand freedom. The ability to make personal choices about buying, working, and saving is an important personal\nfreedom. Some people may choose high-pressure, high-paying jobs so that they can earn and spend\nconsiderable amounts of money on themselves. Others may allocate large portions of their earnings to charity\nor spend it on their friends and family. Others may devote themselves to a career that can require much time,\nenergy, and expertise but does not offer high financial rewards, like being an elementary school teacher or a\nsocial worker. Still others may choose a job that does consume much of their time or provide a high level of\nincome, but still leaves time for family, friends, and contemplation. Some people may prefer to work for a large\ncompany; others might want to start their own business. People\u2019s freedom to make their own economic choices\nhas a moral value worth respecting.\nCLEAR IT UP\nIs a diagram by any other name the same?\nWhen you study economics, you may feel buried under an avalanche of diagrams. Your goal should be to recognize\nthe common underlying logic and pattern of the diagrams, not to memorize each one.\nThis chapter uses only one basic diagram, although we present it with different sets of labels. The consumption\nbudget constraint and the production possibilities frontier for society, as a whole, are the same basic diagram.\nFigure 2.6shows an individual budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier for two goods, Good 1 and\nGood 2. The tradeoff diagram always illustrates three basic themes: scarcity, tradeoffs, and economic efficiency.\nThe first theme isscarcity. It is not feasible to have unlimited amounts of both goods. Even if the budget constraint\nor a PPF shifts, scarcity remains\u2014just at a different level. The second theme istradeoffs. As depicted in the budget\nconstraint or the production possibilities frontier, it is necessary to forgo some of one good to gain more of the other\ngood. The details of this tradeoff vary. In a budget constraint we determine, the tradeoff is determined by the\nrelative prices of the goods: that is, the relative price of two goods in the consumption choice budget constraint.\nThese tradeoffs appear as a straight line. However, a curved line represents the tradeoffs in many production\npossibilities frontiers because the law of diminishing returns holds that as we add resources to an area, the marginal\ngains tend to diminish. Regardless of the specific shape, tradeoffs remain.\nThe third theme iseconomic efficiency, or getting the most benefit from scarce resources. All choices on the\nproduction possibilities frontier show productive efficiency because in such cases, there is no way to increase the\nquantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of the other. Similarly, when an individual makes a choice\nalong a budget constraint, there is no way to increase the quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of\nthe other. The choice on a production possibilities set that is socially preferred, or the choice on an individual\u2019s\nbudget constraint that is personally preferred, will display allocative efficiency.\nThe basic budget constraint/production possibilities frontier diagram will recur throughout this book. Some\nexamples include using these tradeoff diagrams to analyze trade, environmental protection and economic output,\nequality of incomes and economic output, and the macroeconomic tradeoff between consumption and investment.\nDo not allow the different labels to confuse you. The budget constraint/production possibilities frontier diagram is\nalways just a tool for thinking carefully about scarcity, tradeoffs, and efficiency in a particular situation.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.3 \u2022 Confronting Objections to the Economic Approach 41\nFIGURE2.6The Tradeoff DiagramBoth the individual opportunity set (or budget constraint) and the social\nproduction possibilities frontier show the constraints under which individual consumers and society as a whole\noperate. Both diagrams show the tradeoff in choosing more of one good at the cost of less of the other.\nThird, self-interested behavior can lead to positive social results. For example, when people work hard to make\na living, they create economic output. Consumers who are looking for the best deals will encourage businesses\nto offer goods and services that meet their needs. Adam Smith, writing inThe Wealth of Nations, named this\nproperty theinvisible hand. In describing how consumers and producers interact in a market economy, Smith\nwrote:\nEvery individual\u2026generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how\nmuch he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends\nonly his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the\ngreatest value, he intends only his own gain. And he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an\ninvisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention\u2026By pursuing his own interest he\nfrequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.\nThe metaphor of the invisible hand suggests the remarkable possibility that broader social good can emerge\nfrom selfish individual actions.\nFourth, even people who focus on their own self-interest in the economic part of their life often set aside their\nown narrow self-interest in other parts of life. For example, you might focus on your own self-interest when\nasking your employer for a raise or negotiating to buy a car. Then you might turn around and focus on other\npeople when you volunteer to read stories at the local library, help a friend move to a new apartment, or donate\nmoney to a charity. Self-interest is a reasonable starting point for analyzing many economic decisions, without\nneeding to imply that people never do anything that is not in their own immediate self-interest.\nBRING IT HOME\nChoices ... to What Degree?\nWhat have we learned? We know that scarcity impacts all the choices we make. An economist might argue that\npeople do not obtain a bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degree because they do not have the resources to make those choices\nor because their incomes are too low and/or the price of these degrees is too high. A bachelor\u2019s or a master\u2019s degree\nmay not be available in their opportunity set.\nThe price of these degrees may be too high not only because the actual price, college tuition (and perhaps room and 42 2 \u2022 Choice in a World of Scarcity\nboard), is too high. An economist might also say that for many people, the full opportunity cost of a bachelor\u2019s or a\nmaster\u2019s degree is too high. For these people, they are unwilling or unable to make the tradeoff of forfeiting years of\nworking, and earning an income, to earn a degree.\nFinally, the statistics we introduced at the start of the chapter reveal information aboutintertemporal choices. An\neconomist might say that people choose not to obtain a college degree because they may have to borrow money to\nattend college, and the interest they have to pay on that loan in the future will affect their decisions today. Also, it\ncould be that some people have a preference for current consumption over future consumption, so they choose to\nwork now at a lower salary and consume now, rather than postponing that consumption until after they graduate\ncollege.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2 \u2022 Key Terms 43\nKey Terms\nallocative efficiency when the mix of goods produced represents the mix that society most desires\nbudget constraint all possible consumption combinations of goods that someone can afford, given the prices\nof goods, when all income is spent; the boundary of the opportunity set\ncomparative advantage when a country can produce a good at a lower cost in terms of other goods; or, when a\ncountry has a lower opportunity cost of production\ninvisible hand Adam Smith's concept that individuals' self-interested behavior can lead to positive social\noutcomes\nlaw of diminishing marginal utility as we consume more of a good or service, the utility we get from\nadditional units of the good or service tends to become smaller than what we received from earlier units\nlaw of diminishing returns as we add additional increments of resources to producing a good or service, the\nmarginal benefit from those additional increments will decline\nmarginal analysis examination of decisions on the margin, meaning a little more or a little less from the\nstatus quo\nnormative statement statement which describes how the world should be\nopportunity cost measures cost by what we give up/forfeit in exchange; opportunity cost measures the value\nof the forgone alternative\nopportunity set all possible combinations of consumption that someone can afford given the prices of goods\nand the individual\u2019s income\npositive statement statement which describes the world as it is\nproduction possibilities frontier (PPF) a diagram that shows the productively efficient combinations of two\nproducts that an economy can produce given the resources it has available.\nproductive efficiency when it is impossible to produce more of one good (or service) without decreasing the\nquantity produced of another good (or service)\nsunk costs costs that we make in the past that we cannot recover\nutility satisfaction, usefulness, or value one obtains from consuming goods and services\nKey Concepts and Summary\n2.1How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget Constraint\nEconomists see the real world as one of scarcity: that is, a world in which people\u2019s desires exceed what is\npossible. As a result, economic behavior involves tradeoffs in which individuals, firms, and society must forgo\nsomething that they desire to obtain things that they desire more. Individuals face the tradeoff of what\nquantities of goods and services to consume. The budget constraint, which is the frontier of the opportunity\nset, illustrates the range of available choices. The relative price of the choices determines the slope of the\nbudget constraint. Choices beyond the budget constraint are not affordable.\nOpportunity cost measures cost by what we forgo in exchange. Sometimes we can measure opportunity cost in\nmoney, but it is often useful to consider time as well, or to measure it in terms of the actual resources that we\nmust forfeit.\nMost economic decisions and tradeoffs are not all-or-nothing. Instead, they involve marginal analysis, which\nmeans they are about decisions on the margin, involving a little more or a little less. The law of diminishing\nmarginal utility points out that as a person receives more of something\u2014whether it is a specific good or\nanother resource\u2014the additional marginal gains tend to become smaller. Because sunk costs occurred in the\npast and cannot be recovered, they should be disregarded in making current decisions.\n2.2The Production Possibilities Frontier and Social Choices\nA production possibilities frontier defines the set of choices society faces for the combinations of goods and\nservices it can produce given the resources and the technology that are available. The shape of the PPF is\ntypically curved outward, rather than straight. Choices outside the PPF are unattainable and choices inside the 44 2 \u2022 Self-Check Questions\nPPF are wasteful. Over time, a growing economy will tend to shift the PPF outwards.\nThe law of diminishing returns holds that as increments of additional resources are devoted to producing\nsomething, the marginal increase in output will become increasingly smaller. All choices along a production\npossibilities frontier display productive efficiency; that is, it is impossible to use society\u2019s resources to produce\nmore of one good without decreasing production of the other good. The specific choice along a production\npossibilities frontier that reflects the mix of goods society prefers is the choice with allocative efficiency. The\ncurvature of the PPF is likely to differ by country, which results in different countries having comparative\nadvantage in different goods. Total production can increase if countries specialize in the goods in which they\nhave comparative advantage and trade some of their production for the remaining goods.\n2.3Confronting Objections to the Economic Approach\nThe economic way of thinking provides a useful approach to understanding human behavior. Economists\nmake the careful distinction between positive statements, which describe the world as it is, and normative\nstatements, which describe how the world should be. Even when economics analyzes the gains and losses from\nvarious events or policies, and thus draws normative conclusions about how the world should be, the analysis\nof economics is rooted in a positive analysis of how people, firms, and governments actually behave, not how\nthey should behave.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

At one time, consumers had to go\nto specialty stores or farmers' markets to find organic produce. Now it is available in most grocery stores. In short, 48 3 \u2022 Demand and Supply\norganic has become part of the mainstream.\nEver wonder why organic food costs more than conventional food? Why, say, does an organic Fuji apple cost $2.75 a\npound, while its conventional counterpart costs $1.72 a pound? The same price relationship is true for just about\nevery organic product on the market. If many organic foods are locally grown, would they not take less time to get to\nmarket and therefore be cheaper? What are the forces that keep those prices from coming down? Turns out those\nforces have quite a bit to do with this chapter\u2019s topic: demand and supply.\nAn auction bidder pays thousands of dollars for a dress Whitney Houston wore. A collector spends a small\nfortune for a few drawings by John Lennon. People usually react to purchases like these in two ways: their jaw\ndrops because they think these are high prices to pay for such goods or they think these are rare, desirable\nitems and the amount paid seems right.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/celebauction)to read a list of bizarre items that have been purchased\nfor their ties to celebrities. These examples represent an interesting facet of demand and supply.\nWhen economists talk about prices, they are less interested in making judgments than in gaining a practical\nunderstanding of what determines prices and why prices change. Consider a price most of us contend with\nweekly: that of a gallon of gas. Why was the average price of gasoline in the United States $3.16 per gallon in\nJune of 2020? Why did the price for gasoline fall sharply to $2.42 per gallon by January of 2021? To explain\nthese price movements, economists focus on the determinants of what gasoline buyers are willing to pay and\nwhat gasoline sellers are willing to accept.\nAs it turns out, the price of gasoline in June of any given year is nearly always higher than the price in January\nof that same year. Over recent decades, gasoline prices in midsummer have averaged about 10 cents per gallon\nmore than their midwinter low. The likely reason is that people drive more in the summer, and are also willing\nto pay more for gas, but that does not explain how steeply gas prices fell. Other factors were at work during\nthose 18 months, such as increases in supply and decreases in the demand for crude oil.\nThis chapter introduces the economic model of demand and supply\u2014one of the most powerful models in all of\neconomics. The discussion here begins by examining how demand and supply determine the price and the\nquantity sold in markets for goods and services, and how changes in demand and supply lead to changes in\nprices and quantities.\n3.1Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for Goods and Services\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain demand, quantity demanded, and the law of demand\n\u2022 Explain supply, quantity supplied, and the law of supply\n\u2022 Identify a demand curve and a supply curve\n\u2022 Explain equilibrium, equilibrium price, and equilibrium quantity\nFirst let\u2019s first focus on what economists mean by demand, what they mean by supply, and then how demand\nand supply interact in a market.\nDemand for Goods and Services\nEconomists use the termdemandto refer to the amount of some good or service consumers are willing and\nable to purchase at each price. Demand is fundamentally based on needs and wants\u2014if you have no need or\nwant for something, you won't buy it. While a consumer may be able to differentiate between a need and a\nwant, from an economist\u2019s perspective they are the same thing. Demand is also based on ability to pay. If you\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.1 \u2022 Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for Goods and Services 49\ncannot pay for it, you have no effective demand. By this definition, a person who does not have a drivers\nlicense has no effective demand for a car.\nWhat a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is calledprice. The total number of units that\nconsumers would purchase at that price is called thequantity demanded. A rise in price of a good or service\nalmost always decreases the quantity demanded of that good or service. Conversely, a fall in price will increase\nthe quantity demanded. When the price of a gallon of gasoline increases, for example, people look for ways to\nreduce their consumption by combining several errands, commuting by carpool or mass transit, or taking\nweekend or vacation trips closer to home. Economists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity\ndemanded thelaw of demand. The law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand (which\nwe explain in the next module) are held constant.\nWe can show an example from the market for gasoline in a table or a graph. Economist call a table that shows\nthe quantity demanded at each price, such asTable 3.1, ademand schedule. In this case we measure price in\ndollars per gallon of gasoline. We measure the quantity demanded in millions of gallons over some time period\n(for example, per day or per year) and over some geographic area (like a state or a country). Ademand curve\nshows the relationship between price and quantity demanded on a graph likeFigure 3.2, with quantity on the\nhorizontal axis and the price per gallon on the vertical axis. (Note that this is an exception to the normal rule in\nmathematics that the independent variable (x) goes on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable (y) goes\non the vertical axis. Economics is not math.)\nTable 3.1shows the demand schedule and the graph inFigure 3.2shows the demand curve. These are two\nways to describe the same relationship between price and quantity demanded.\nPrice (per gallon) Quantity Demanded (millions of gallons)\n$1.00 800\n$1.20 700\n$1.40 600\n$1.60 550\n$1.80 500\n$2.00 460\n$2.20 420\nTABLE3.1Price and Quantity Demanded of Gasoline 50 3 \u2022 Demand and Supply\nFIGURE3.2A Demand Curve for GasolineThe demand schedule shows that as price rises, quantity demanded\ndecreases, and vice versa. We graph these points, and the line connecting them is the demand curve (D). The\ndownward slope of the demand curve again illustrates the law of demand\u2014the inverse relationship between prices\nand quantity demanded.\nDemand curves will appear somewhat different for each product. They may appear relatively steep or flat, or\nthey may be straight or curved. Nearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope\ndown from left to right. Demand curves embody the law of demand: As the price increases, the quantity\ndemanded decreases, and conversely, as the price decreases, the quantity demanded increases.\nConfused about these different types of demand? Read the next Clear It Up feature.\nCLEAR IT UP\nIs demand the same as quantity demanded?\nIn economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. When economists talk about demand,\nthey mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities demanded at those prices, as illustrated by\na demand curve or a demand schedule. When economists talk about quantity demanded, they mean only a certain\npoint on the demand curve, or one quantity on the demand schedule. In short, demand refers to the curve and\nquantity demanded refers to a (specific) point on the curve.\nSupply of Goods and Services\nWhen economists talk aboutsupply, they mean the amount of some good or service a producer is willing to\nsupply at each price. Price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of agoodorservice. A rise in price\nalmost always leads to an increase in thequantity suppliedof that good or service, while a fall in price will\ndecrease the quantity supplied. When the price of gasoline rises, for example, it encourages profit-seeking\nfirms to take several actions: expand exploration for oil reserves; drill for more oil; invest in more pipelines\nand oil tankers to bring the oil to plants for refining into gasoline; build new oil refineries; purchase additional\npipelines and trucks to ship the gasoline to gas stations; and open more gas stations or keep existing gas\nstations open longer hours. Economists call this positive relationship between price and quantity\nsupplied\u2014that a higher price leads to a higher quantity supplied and a lower price leads to a lower quantity\nsupplied\u2014thelaw of supply. The law of supply assumes that all other variables that affect supply (to be\nexplained in the next module) are held constant.\nStill unsure about the different types of supply? See the following Clear It Up feature.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.1 \u2022 Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for Goods and Services 51\nCLEAR IT UP\nIs supply the same as quantity supplied?\nIn economic terminology, supply is not the same as quantity supplied. When economists refer to supply, they mean\nthe relationship between a range of prices and the quantities supplied at those prices, a relationship that we can\nillustrate with a supply curve or a supply schedule. When economists refer to quantity supplied, they mean only a\ncertain point on the supply curve, or one quantity on the supply schedule. In short, supply refers to the curve and\nquantity supplied refers to a (specific) point on the curve.\nFigure 3.3illustrates the law of supply, again using the market for gasoline as an example. Like demand, we\ncan illustrate supply using a table or a graph. Asupply scheduleis a table, likeTable 3.2, that shows the\nquantity supplied at a range of different prices. Again, we measure price in dollars per gallon of gasoline and\nwe measure quantity supplied in millions of gallons. Asupply curveis a graphic illustration of the relationship\nbetween price, shown on the vertical axis, and quantity, shown on the horizontal axis. The supply schedule and\nthe supply curve are just two different ways of showing the same information. Notice that the horizontal and\nvertical axes on the graph for the supply curve are the same as for the demand curve.\nFIGURE3.3A Supply Curve for GasolineThe supply schedule is the table that shows quantity supplied of gasoline\nat each price. As price rises, quantity supplied also increases, and vice versa. The supply curve (S) is created by\ngraphing the points from the supply schedule and then connecting them. The upward slope of the supply curve\nillustrates the law of supply\u2014that a higher price leads to a higher quantity supplied, and vice versa.\nPrice (per gallon) Quantity Supplied (millions of gallons)\n$1.00 500\n$1.20 550\n$1.40 600\n$1.60 640\n$1.80 680\nTABLE3.2Price and Supply of Gasoline 52 3 \u2022 Demand and Supply\nPrice (per gallon) Quantity Supplied (millions of gallons)\n$2.00 700\n$2.20 720\nTABLE3.2Price and Supply of Gasoline\nThe shape of supply curves will vary somewhat according to the product: steeper, flatter, straighter, or curved.\nNearly all supply curves, however, share a basic similarity: they slope up from left to right and illustrate the law\nof supply: as the price rises, say, from $1.00 per gallon to $2.20 per gallon, the quantity supplied increases\nfrom 500 gallons to 720 gallons. Conversely, as the price falls, the quantity supplied decreases.\nEquilibrium\u2014Where Demand and Supply Intersect\nBecause the graphs for demand and supply curves both have price on the vertical axis and quantity on the\nhorizontal axis, the demand curve and supply curve for a particular good or service can appear on the same\ngraph. Together, demand and supply determine the price and the quantity that will be bought and sold in a\nmarket.\nFigure 3.4illustrates the interaction of demand and supply in the market for gasoline. The demand curve (D) is\nidentical toFigure 3.2. The supply curve (S) is identical toFigure 3.3.Table 3.3contains the same information\nin tabular form.\nFIGURE3.4Demand and Supply for GasolineThe demand curve (D) and the supply curve (S) intersect at the\nequilibrium point E, with a price of $1.40 and a quantity of 600. The equilibrium price is the only price where\nquantity demanded is equal to quantity supplied. At a price above equilibrium like $1.80, quantity supplied exceeds\nthe quantity demanded, so there is excess supply. At a price below equilibrium such as $1.20, quantity demanded\nexceeds quantity supplied, so there is excess demand.\nPrice (per gallon) Quantity demanded (millions of gallons) Quantity supplied (millions of gallons)\n$1.00 800 500\n$1.20 700 550\n$1.40 600 600\nTABLE3.3Price, Quantity Demanded, and Quantity Supplied\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.1 \u2022 Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for Goods and Services 53\nPrice (per gallon) Quantity demanded (millions of gallons) Quantity supplied (millions of gallons)\n$1.60 550 640\n$1.80 500 680\n$2.00 460 700\n$2.20 420 720\nTABLE3.3Price, Quantity Demanded, and Quantity Supplied\nRemember this: When two lines on a diagram cross, this intersection usually means something. The point\nwhere the supply curve (S) and the demand curve (D) cross, designated by point E inFigure 3.4, is called the\nequilibrium. Theequilibrium priceis the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers\nagree\u2014that is, where the amount of the product consumers want to buy (quantity demanded) is equal to the\namount producers want to sell (quantity supplied). Economists call this common quantity theequilibrium\nquantity. At any other price, the quantity demanded does not equal the quantity supplied, so the market is not\nin equilibrium at that price.\nInFigure 3.4, the equilibrium price is $1.40 per gallon of gasoline and the equilibrium quantity is 600 million\ngallons. If you had only the demand and supply schedules, and not the graph, you could find the equilibrium by\nlooking for the price level on the tables where the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied are equal.\nThe word \u201cequilibrium\u201d means \u201cbalance.\u201d If a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no\nreason to move away from that point. However, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise\nto move the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\nImagine, for example, that the price of a gallon of gasoline was above the equilibrium price\u2014that is, instead of\n$1.40 per gallon, the price is $1.80 per gallon. The dashed horizontal line at the price of $1.80 inFigure 3.4\nillustrates this above-equilibrium price. At this higher price, the quantity demanded drops from 600 to 500.\nThis decline in quantity reflects how consumers react to the higher price by finding ways to use less gasoline.\nMoreover, at this higher price of $1.80, the quantity of gasoline supplied rises from 600 to 680, as the higher\nprice makes it more profitable for gasoline producers to expand their output. Now, consider how quantity\ndemanded and quantity supplied are related at this above-equilibrium price. Quantity demanded has fallen to\n500 gallons, while quantity supplied has risen to 680 gallons. In fact, at any above-equilibrium price, the\nquantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded. We call this anexcess supplyor asurplus.\nWith a surplus, gasoline accumulates at gas stations, in tanker trucks, in pipelines, and at oil refineries. This\naccumulation puts pressure on gasoline sellers. If a surplus remains unsold, those firms involved in making\nand selling gasoline are not receiving enough cash to pay their workers and to cover their expenses. In this\nsituation, some producers and sellers will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a lower price than not\nto sell at all. Once some sellers start cutting prices, others will follow to avoid losing sales. These price\nreductions in turn will stimulate a higher quantity demanded. Therefore, if the price is above the equilibrium\nlevel, incentives built into the structure of demand and supply will create pressures for the price to fall toward\nthe equilibrium.\nNow suppose that the price is below its equilibrium level at $1.20 per gallon, as the dashed horizontal line at\nthis price inFigure 3.4shows. At this lower price, the quantity demanded increases from 600 to 700 as drivers\ntake longer trips, spend more minutes warming up the car in the driveway in wintertime, stop sharing rides to\nwork, and buy larger cars that get fewer miles to the gallon. However, the below-equilibrium price reduces\ngasoline producers\u2019 incentives to produce and sell gasoline, and the quantity supplied falls from 600 to 550. 54 3 \u2022 Demand and Supply\nWhen the price is below equilibrium, there isexcess demand, or ashortage\u2014that is, at the given price the\nquantity demanded, which has been stimulated by the lower price, now exceeds the quantity supplied, which\nhas been depressed by the lower price. In this situation, eager gasoline buyers mob the gas stations, only to\nfind many stations running short of fuel. Oil companies and gas stations recognize that they have an\nopportunity to make higher profits by selling what gasoline they have at a higher price. As a result, the price\nrises toward the equilibrium level. ReadDemand, Supply, and Efficiencyfor more discussion on the\nimportance of the demand and supply model.\n3.2Shifts in Demand and Supply for Goods and Services\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Identify factors that affect demand\n\u2022 Graph demand curves and demand shifts\n\u2022 Identify factors that affect supply\n\u2022 Graph supply curves and supply shifts\nThe previous module explored howpriceaffects the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied. The result\nwas the demand curve and the supply curve. Price, however, is not the only factor that influences buyers\u2019 and\nsellers\u2019 decisions. For example, how is demand for vegetarian food affected if, say, health concerns cause more\nconsumers to avoid eating meat? How is the supply of diamonds affected if diamond producers discover\nseveral new diamond mines? What are the major factors, in addition to the price, that influence demand or\nsupply?\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(https://openstax.org/l/toothfish)to read a brief note on how marketing strategies can\ninfluence supply and demand of products.\nWhat Factors Affect Demand?\nWe defined demand as the amount of some product a consumer is willing and able to purchase at each price.\nThat suggests at least two factors that affect demand. Willingness to purchase suggests a desire, based on what\neconomists call tastes and preferences. If you neither need nor want something, you will not buy it, and if you\nreally like something, you will buy more of it than someone who does not share your strong preference for it.\nAbility to purchase suggests that income is important. Professors are usually able to afford better housing and\ntransportation than students, because they have more income. Prices of related goods can affect demand also.\nIf you need a new car, the price of a Honda may affect your demand for a Ford. Finally, the size or composition\nof the population can affect demand. The more children a family has, the greater their demand for clothing.\nThe more driving-age children a family has, the greater their demand for car insurance, and the less for\ndiapers and baby formula.\nThese factors matter for both individual and market demand as a whole. Exactly how do these various factors\naffect demand, and how do we show the effects graphically? To answer those questions, we need theceteris\nparibusassumption.\nTheCeteris ParibusAssumption\nAdemand curveor asupply curveis a relationship between two, and only two, variables: quantity on the\nhorizontal axis and price on the vertical axis. The assumption behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that\nno relevant economic factors, other than the product\u2019s price, are changing. Economists call this assumption\nceteris paribus, a Latin phrase meaning \u201cother things being equal.\u201d Any given demand or supply curve is\nbased on theceteris paribusassumption that all else is held equal. A demand curve or a supply curve is a\nrelationship between two, and only two, variables when all other variables are kept constant. If all else is not\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.2 \u2022 Shifts in Demand and Supply for Goods and Services 55\nheld equal, then the laws of supply and demand will not necessarily hold, as the following Clear It Up feature\nshows.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhen doesceteris paribusapply?\nWe typically applyceteris paribuswhen we observe how changes in price affect demand or supply, but we can apply\nceteris paribusmore generally. In the real world, demand and supply depend on more factors than just price. For\nexample, a consumer\u2019s demand depends on income and a producer\u2019s supply depends on the cost of producing the\nproduct. How can we analyze the effect on demand or supply if multiple factors are changing at the same time\u2014say\nprice rises and income falls? The answer is that we examine the changes one at a time, assuming the other factors\nare held constant.\nFor example, we can say that an increase in the price reduces the amount consumers will buy (assuming income,\nand anything else that affects demand, is unchanged). Additionally, a decrease in income reduces the amount\nconsumers can afford to buy (assuming price, and anything else that affects demand, is unchanged). This is what the\nceteris paribusassumption really means. In this particular case, after we analyze each factor separately, we can\ncombine the results. The amount consumers buy falls for two reasons: first because of the higher price and second\nbecause of the lower income.\nHow Does Income Affect Demand?\nLet\u2019s use income as an example of how factors other than price affect demand.Figure 3.5shows the initial\ndemand for automobiles as D . At point Q, for example, if the price is $20,000 per car, the quantity of cars\n0\ndemanded is 18 million. D also shows how the quantity of cars demanded would change as a result of a higher\n0\nor lower price. For example, if the price of a car rose to $22,000, the quantity demanded would decrease to 17\nmillion, at point R.\nThe original demand curve D , like every demand curve, is based on theceteris paribusassumption that no\n0\nother economically relevant factors change. Now imagine that the economy expands in a way that raises the\nincomes of many people, making cars more affordable. How will this affect demand? How can we show this\ngraphically?\nReturn toFigure 3.5. The price of cars is still $20,000, but with higher incomes, the quantity demanded has\nnow increased to 20 million cars, shown at point S. As a result of the higher income levels, the demand curve\nshifts to the right to the new demand curve D , indicating an increase in demand.Table 3.4shows clearly that\n1\nthis increased demand would occur at every price, not just the original one. 56 3 \u2022 Demand and Supply\nFIGURE3.5Shifts in Demand: A Car ExampleIncreased demand means that at every given price, the quantity\ndemanded is higher, so that the demand curve shifts to the right from D to D . Decreased demand means that at\n0 1\nevery given price, the quantity demanded is lower, so that the demand curve shifts to the left from D to D .\n0 2\nPrice Decrease to D Original Quantity Demanded D Increase to D\n2 0 1\n$16,000 17.6 million 22.0 million 24.0 million\n$18,000 16.0 million 20.0 million 22.0 million\n$20,000 14.4 million 18.0 million 20.0 million\n$22,000 13.6 million 17.0 million 19.0 million\n$24,000 13.2 million 16.5 million 18.5 million\n$26,000 12.8 million 16.0 million 18.0 million\nTABLE3.4Price and Demand Shifts: A Car Example\nNow, imagine that the economy slows down so that many people lose their jobs or work fewer hours, reducing\ntheir incomes. In this case, the decrease in income would lead to a lower quantity of cars demanded at every\ngiven price, and the original demand curve D would shift left to D . The shift from D to D represents such a\n0 2 0 2\ndecrease in demand: At any given price level, the quantity demanded is now lower. In this example, a price of\n$20,000 means 18 million cars sold along the original demand curve, but only 14.4 million sold after demand\nfell.\nWhen a demand curve shifts, it does not mean that the quantity demanded by every individual buyer changes\nby the same amount. In this example, not everyone would have higher or lower income and not everyone\nwould buy or not buy an additional car. Instead, a shift in a demand curve captures a pattern for the market as\na whole.\nIn the previous section, we argued that higher income causes greater demand at every price. This is true for\nmost goods and services. For some\u2014luxury cars, vacations in Europe, and fine jewelry\u2014the effect of a rise in\nincome can be especially pronounced. A product whose demand rises when income rises, and vice versa, is\ncalled anormal good. A few exceptions to this pattern do exist. As incomes rise, many people will buy fewer\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.2 \u2022 Shifts in Demand and Supply for Goods and Services 57\ngeneric brand groceries and more name brand groceries. They are less likely to buy used cars and more likely\nto buy new cars. They will be less likely to rent an apartment and more likely to own a home. A product whose\ndemand falls when income rises, and vice versa, is called aninferior good. In other words, when income\nincreases, the demand curve shifts to the left.\nOther Factors That Shift Demand Curves\nIncome is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand. Other factors that change demand include tastes\nand preferences, the composition or size of the population, the prices of related goods, and even expectations.\nA change in any one of the underlying factors that determine what quantity people are willing to buy at a given\nprice will cause a shift in demand. Graphically, the new demand curve lies either to the right (an increase) or to\nthe left (a decrease) of the original demand curve. Let\u2019s look at these factors.\nChanging Tastes or Preferences\nFrom 1980 to 2021, the per-person consumption of chicken by Americans rose from 47 pounds per year to 97\npounds per year, and consumption of beef fell from 76 pounds per year to 59 pounds per year, according to the\nU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Changes like these are largely due to movements in taste, which\nchange the quantity of a good demanded at every price: that is, they shift the demand curve for that good,\nrightward for chicken and leftward for beef.\nChanges in the Composition of the Population\nThe proportion of elderly citizens in the United States population is rising. It rose from 9.8% in 1970 to 12.6%\nin 2000, and will be a projected (by theU.S. Census Bureau) 20% of the population by 2030. A society with\nrelatively more children, like the United States in the 1960s, will have greater demand for goods and services\nlike tricycles and day care facilities. A society with relatively more elderly persons, as the United States is\nprojected to have by 2030, has a higher demand for nursing homes and hearing aids. Similarly, changes in the\nsize of the population can affect the demand for housing and many other goods. Each of these changes in\ndemand will be shown as a shift in the demand curve.\nChanges in the Prices of Related Goods\nChanges in the prices of related goods such as substitutes or complements also can affect the demand for a\nproduct. Asubstituteis a good or service that we can use in place of another good or service. As electronic\nbooks, like this one, become more available, you would expect to see a decrease in demand for traditional\nprinted books. A lower price for a substitute decreases demand for the other product. For example, in recent\nyears as the price of tablet computers has fallen, the quantity demanded has increased (because of the law of\ndemand). Since people are purchasing tablets, there has been a decrease in demand for laptops, which we can\nshow graphically as a leftward shift in the demand curve for laptops. A higher price for a substitute good has\nthe reverse effect.\nOther goods arecomplementsfor each other, meaning we often use the goods together, because consumption\nof one good tends to enhance consumption of the other. Examples include breakfast cereal and milk;\nnotebooks and pens or pencils, golf balls and golf clubs; gasoline and sport utility vehicles; and the five-way\ncombination of bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, and bread. If the price of golf clubs rises, since the\nquantity demanded of golf clubs falls (because of the law of demand), demand for a complement good like golf\nballs decreases, too. Similarly, a higher price for skis would shift the demand curve for a complement good like\nski resort trips to the left, while a lower price for a complement has the reverse effect.\nChanges in Expectations about Future Prices or Other Factors that Affect Demand\nWhile it is clear that the price of a good affects the quantity demanded, it is also true that expectations about\nthe future price (or expectations about tastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand. For\nexample, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the store to buy flashlight batteries and\nbottled water. If people learn that the price of a good like coffee is likely to rise in the future, they may head for 58 3 \u2022 Demand and Supply\nthe store to stock up on coffee now. We show these changes in demand as shifts in the curve. Therefore, ashift\nin demandhappens when a change in some economic factor (other than price) causes a different quantity to\nbe demanded at every price. The following Work It Out feature shows how this happens.\nWORK IT OUT\nShift in Demand\nA shift in demand means that at any price (and at every price), the quantity demanded will be different than it\nwas before. Following is an example of a shift in demand due to an income increase.\nStep 1. Draw the graph of a demand curve for a normal good like pizza. Pick a price (like P ). Identify the\n0\ncorresponding Q . See an example inFigure 3.6.\n0\nFIGURE3.6Demand CurveWe can use the demand curve to identify how much consumers would buy at any\ngiven price.\nStep 2. Suppose income increases. As a result of the change, are consumers going to buy more or less pizza? The\nanswer is more. Draw a dotted horizontal line from the chosen price, through the original quantity demanded, to\nthe new point with the new Q . Draw a dotted vertical line down to the horizontal axis and label the new Q .\n1 1\nFigure 3.7provides an example.\nFIGURE3.7Demand Curve with Income IncreaseWith an increase in income, consumers will purchase larger\nquantities, pushing demand to the right.\nStep 3. Now, shift the curve through the new point. You will see that an increase in income causes an upward (or\nrightward) shift in the demand curve, so that at any price the quantities demanded will be higher, asFigure 3.8\nillustrates.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.2 \u2022 Shifts in Demand and Supply for Goods and Services 59\nFIGURE3.8Demand Curve Shifted RightWith an increase in income, consumers will purchase larger quantities,\npushing demand to the right, and causing the demand curve to shift right.\nSumming Up Factors That Change Demand\nFigure 3.9summarizes six factors that can shift demand curves. The direction of the arrows indicates whether\nthe demand curve shifts represent an increase in demand or a decrease in demand. Notice that a change in the\nprice of the good or service itself is not listed among the factors that can shift a demand curve. A change in the\nprice of a good or service causes a movement along a specific demand curve, and it typically leads to some\nchange in the quantity demanded, but it does not shift the demand curve.\nFIGURE3.9Factors That Shift Demand Curves(a) A list of factors that can cause an increase in demand from D to\n0\nD . (b) The same factors, if their direction is reversed, can cause a decrease in demand from D to D .\n1 0 1\nWhen a demand curve shifts, it will then intersect with a given supply curve at a different equilibrium price\nand quantity. We are, however, getting ahead of our story. Before discussing how changes in demand can affect\nequilibrium price and quantity, we first need to discuss shifts in supply curves.\nHow Production Costs Affect Supply\nA supply curve shows how quantity supplied will change as the price rises and falls, assumingceteris paribus\nso that no other economically relevant factors are changing. If other factors relevant to supply do change, then\nthe entire supply curve will shift. Just as we described a shift in demand as a change in the quantity demanded\nat every price, ashift in supplymeans a change in the quantity supplied at every price.\nIn thinking about the factors that affect supply, remember what motivates firms: profits, which are the\ndifference between revenues and costs. A firm produces goods and services using combinations of labor,\nmaterials, and machinery, or what we callinputsorfactors of production. If a firm faces lower costs of\nproduction, while the prices for the good or service the firm produces remain unchanged, a firm\u2019s profits go 60 3 \u2022 Demand and Supply\nup. When a firm\u2019s profits increase, it is more motivated to produce output, since the more it produces the more\nprofit it will earn. When costs of production fall, a firm will tend to supply a larger quantity at any given price\nfor its output. We can show this by the supply curve shifting to the right.\nTake, for example, a messenger company that delivers packages around a city. The company may find that\nbuying gasoline is one of its main costs. If the price of gasoline falls, then the company will find it can deliver\nmessages more cheaply than before. Since lower costs correspond to higher profits, the messenger company\nmay now supply more of its services at any given price. For example, given the lower gasoline prices, the\ncompany can now serve a greater area, and increase its supply.\nConversely, if a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any given selling price for\nits products. As a result, a higher cost of production typically causes a firm to supply a smaller quantity at any\ngiven price. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the left.\nConsider the supply for cars, shown by curve S inFigure 3.10. Point J indicates that if the price is $20,000, the\n0\nquantity supplied will be 18 million cars. If the price rises to $22,000 per car,ceteris paribus,the quantity\nsupplied will rise to 20 million cars, as point K on the S curve shows. We can show the same information in\n0\ntable form, as inTable 3.5.\nFIGURE3.10Shifts in Supply: A Car ExampleDecreased supply means that at every given price, the quantity\nsupplied is lower, so that the supply curve shifts to the left, from S to S . Increased supply means that at every\n0 1\ngiven price, the quantity supplied is higher, so that the supply curve shifts to the right, from S to S .\n0 2\nPrice Decrease to S Original Quantity Supplied S Increase to S\n1 0 2\n$16,000 10.5 million 12.0 million 13.2 million\n$18,000 13.5 million 15.0 million 16.5 million\n$20,000 16.5 million 18.0 million 19.8 million\n$22,000 18.5 million 20.0 million 22.0 million\n$24,000 19.5 million 21.0 million 23.1 million\n$26,000 20.5 million 22.0 million 24.2 million\nTABLE3.5Price and Shifts in Supply: A Car Example\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.2 \u2022 Shifts in Demand and Supply for Goods and Services 61\nNow, imagine that the price of steel, an important ingredient in manufacturing cars, rises, so that producing a\ncar has become more expensive. At any given price for selling cars, car manufacturers will react by supplying a\nlower quantity. We can show this graphically as a leftward shift of supply, from S to S , which indicates that at\n0 1\nany given price, the quantity supplied decreases. In this example, at a price of $20,000, the quantity supplied\ndecreases from 18 million on the original supply curve (S ) to 16.5 million on the supply curve S , which is\n0 1\nlabeled as point L.\nConversely, if the price of steel decreases, producing a car becomes less expensive. At any given price for\nselling cars, car manufacturers can now expect to earn higher profits, so they will supply a higher quantity. The\nshift of supply to the right, from S to S , means that at all prices, the quantity supplied has increased. In this\n0 2\nexample, at a price of $20,000, the quantity supplied increases from 18 million on the original supply curve\n(S ) to 19.8 million on the supply curve S , which is labeled M.\n0 2\nOther Factors That Affect Supply\nIn the example above, we saw that changes in the prices of inputs in the production process will affect the cost\nof production and thus the supply. Several other things affect the cost of production, too, such as changes in\nweather or other natural conditions, new technologies for production, and some government policies.\nChanges in weather and climate will affect the cost of production for many agricultural products. For example,\nin 2014 the Manchurian Plain in Northeastern China, which produces most of the country's wheat, corn, and\nsoybeans, experienced its most severe drought in 50 years. A drought decreases the supply of agricultural\nproducts, which means that at any given price, a lower quantity will be supplied. Conversely, especially good\nweather would shift the supply curve to the right.\nWhen afirmdiscovers a new technology that allows the firm to produce at a lower cost, the supply curve will\nshift to the right, as well. For instance, in the 1960s a major scientific effort nicknamed the Green Revolution\nfocused on breeding improved seeds for basic crops like wheat and rice. By the early 1990s, more than two-\nthirds of the wheat and rice in low-income countries around the world used these Green Revolution seeds\u2014and\nthe harvest was twice as high per acre. A technological improvement that reduces costs of production will shift\nsupply to the right, so that a greater quantity will be produced at any given price.\nGovernment policies can affect the cost of production and the supply curve through taxes, regulations, and\nsubsidies. For example, the U.S. government imposes a tax on alcoholic beverages that collects about $8 billion\nper year from producers. Businesses treat taxes as costs. Higher costs decrease supply for the reasons we\ndiscussed above. Other examples of policy that can affect cost are the wide array of government regulations\nthat require firms to spend money to provide a cleaner environment or a safer workplace. Complying with\nregulations increases costs.\nA government subsidy, on the other hand, is the opposite of a tax. A subsidy occurs when the government pays\na firm directly or reduces the firm\u2019s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. From the firm\u2019s perspective,\ntaxes or regulations are an additional cost of production that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to\nproduce a lower quantity at every given price. Government subsidies reduce the cost of production and\nincrease supply at every given price, shifting supply to the right. The following Work It Out feature shows how\nthis shift happens.\nWORK IT OUT\nShift in Supply\nWe know that a supply curve shows the minimum price a firm will accept to produce a given quantity of output.\nWhat happens to the supply curve when the cost of production goes up? Following is an example of a shift in\nsupply due to a production cost increase. (We\u2019ll introduce some other concepts regarding firm decision-making in 62 3 \u2022 Demand and Supply\nChapters 7 and 8.)\nStep 1. Draw a graph of a supply curve for pizza. Pick a quantity (like Q ). If you draw a vertical line up from Q to\n0 0\nthe supply curve, you will see the price the firm chooses.Figure 3.11provides an example.\nFIGURE3.11Supply CurveYou can use a supply curve to show the minimum price a firm will accept to produce\na given quantity of output.\nStep 2. Why did the firm choose that price and not some other? One way to think about this is that the price is\ncomposed of two parts. The first part is the cost of producing pizzas at the margin; in this case, the cost of\nproducing the pizza, including cost of ingredients (e.g., dough, sauce, cheese, and pepperoni), the cost of the\npizza oven, the shop rent, and the workers' wages. The second part is the firm\u2019s desired profit, which is\ndetermined, among other factors, by the profit margins in that particular business. (Desired profit is not\nnecessarily the same as economic profit, which will be explained in Chapter 7.) If you add these two parts\ntogether, you get the price the firm wishes to charge. The quantity Q0 and associated price P0 give you one point\non the firm\u2019s supply curve, asFigure 3.12illustrates.\nFIGURE3.12Setting PricesThe cost of production and the desired profit equal the price a firm will set for a\nproduct.\nStep 3. Now, suppose that the cost of production increases. Perhaps cheese has become more expensive by\n$0.75 per pizza. If that is true, the firm will want to raise its price by the amount of the increase in cost ($0.75).\nDraw this point on the supply curve directly above the initial point on the curve, but $0.75 higher, asFigure 3.13\nshows.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.2 \u2022 Shifts in Demand and Supply for Goods and Services 63\nFIGURE3.13Increasing Costs Leads to Increasing PriceBecause the cost of production and the desired profit\nequal the price a firm will set for a product, if the cost of production increases, the price for the product will also\nneed to increase.\nStep 4. Shift the supply curve through this point. You will see that an increase in cost causes an upward (or a\nleftward) shift of the supply curve so that at any price, the quantities supplied will be smaller, asFigure 3.14\nillustrates.\nFIGURE3.14Supply Curve ShiftsWhen the cost of production increases, the supply curve shifts upwardly to a\nnew price level.\nSumming Up Factors That Change Supply\nChanges in the cost of inputs, natural disasters, new technologies, and the impact of government decisions all\naffect the cost of production. In turn, these factors affect how much firms are willing to supply at any given\nprice.\nFigure 3.15summarizes factors that change the supply of goods and services. Notice that a change in the price\nof the product itself is not among the factors that shift the supply curve. Although a change in price of a good or\nservice typically causes a change in quantity supplied or a movement along the supply curve for that specific\ngood or service, it does not cause the supply curve itself to shift. 64 3 \u2022 Demand and Supply\nFIGURE3.15Factors That Shift Supply Curves(a) A list of factors that can cause an increase in supply from S to\n0\nS . (b) The same factors, if their direction is reversed, can cause a decrease in supply from S to S .\n1 0 1\nBecause demand and supply curves appear on a two-dimensional diagram with only price and quantity on the\naxes, an unwary visitor to the land of economics might be fooled into believing that economics is about only\nfour topics: demand, supply, price, and quantity. However, demand and supply are really \u201cumbrella\u201d concepts:\ndemand covers all the factors that affect demand, and supply covers all the factors that affect supply. We\ninclude factors other than price that affect demand and supply by using shifts in the demand or the supply\ncurve. In this way, the two-dimensional demand and supply model becomes a powerful tool for analyzing a\nwide range of economic circumstances.\n3.3Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity: The Four-Step Process\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Identify equilibrium price and quantity through the four-step process\n\u2022 Graph equilibrium price and quantity\n\u2022 Contrast shifts of demand or supply and movements along a demand or supply curve\n\u2022 Graph demand and supply curves, including equilibrium price and quantity, based on real-world\nexamples\nLet\u2019s begin this discussion with a single economic event. It might be an event that affects demand, like a\nchange in income, population, tastes, prices of substitutes or complements, or expectations about future\nprices. It might be an event that affects supply, like a change in natural conditions, input prices, or technology,\nor government policies that affect production. How does this economic event affect equilibrium price and\nquantity? We will analyze this question using a four-step process.\nStep 1. Draw a demand and supply model before the economic change took place. To establish the model\nrequires four standard pieces of information: The law of demand, which tells us the slope of the demand curve\nis negative; the law of supply, which tells us that the slope of the supply curve is positive; the shift variables for\ndemand; and the shift variables for supply. From this model, find the initial equilibrium values for price and\nquantity.\nStep 2. Decide whether the economic change you are analyzing affects demand or supply. In other words, does\nthe event refer to something in the list of demand factors or supply factors?\nStep 3. Decide whether the effect on demand or supply causes the curve to shift to the right or to the left, and\nsketch the new demand or supply curve on the diagram. In other words, does the event increase or decrease\nthe amount consumers want to buy or producers want to sell?\nStep 4. Identify the new equilibrium and then compare the original equilibrium price and quantity to the new\nequilibrium price and quantity.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.3 \u2022 Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity: The Four-Step Process 65\nLet\u2019s consider one example that involves a shift in supply and one that involves a shift in demand. Then we will\nconsider an example where both supply and demand shift.\nGood Weather for Salmon Fishing\nSuppose that during the summer of 2015, weather conditions were excellent for commercial salmon fishing off\nthe California coast. Heavy rains meant higher than normal levels of water in the rivers, which helps the\nsalmon to breed. Slightly cooler ocean temperatures stimulated the growth of plankton, the microscopic\norganisms at the bottom of the ocean food chain, providing everything in the ocean with a hearty food supply.\nThe ocean stayed calm during fishing season, so commercial fishing operations did not lose many days to bad\nweather. How did these climate conditions affect the quantity and price of salmon?Figure 3.16illustrates the\nfour-step approach, which we explain below, to work through this problem.Table 3.6also provides the\ninformation to work the problem.\nFIGURE3.16Good Weather for Salmon Fishing: The Four-Step ProcessUnusually good weather leads to changes\nin the price and quantity of salmon.\nPrice per Pound Quantity Supplied in 2014 Quantity Supplied in 2015 Quantity Demanded\n$2.00 80 400 840\n$2.25 120 480 680\n$2.50 160 550 550\n$2.75 200 600 450\n$3.00 230 640 350\n$3.25 250 670 250\n$3.50 270 700 200\nTABLE3.6Salmon Fishing\nStep 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate the market for salmon in the year before the good\nweather conditions began. The demand curve D and the supply curve S show that the original equilibrium\n0 0 66 3 \u2022 Demand and Supply\nprice is $3.25 per pound and the original equilibrium quantity is 250,000 fish. (This price per pound is what\ncommercial buyers pay at the fishing docks. What consumers pay at the grocery is higher.)\nStep 2. Did the economic event affect supply or demand? Good weather is an example of a natural condition\nthat affects supply.\nStep 3. Was the effect on supply an increase or a decrease? Good weather is a change in natural conditions that\nincreases the quantity supplied at any given price. The supply curve shifts to the right, moving from the\noriginal supply curve S to the new supply curve S , whichFigure 3.16andTable 3.6show.\n0 1\nStep 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium. At the new equilibrium E ,\n1\nthe equilibrium price falls from $3.25 to $2.50, but the equilibrium quantity increases from 250,000 to\n550,000 salmon. Notice that the equilibrium quantity demanded increased, even though the demand curve\ndid not move.\nIn short, good weather conditions increased supply of the California commercial salmon. The result was a\nhigher equilibrium quantity of salmon bought and sold in the market at a lower price.\nNewspapers and the Internet\nAccording to thePew Research Center for People and the Press, increasingly more people, especially younger\npeople, are obtaining their news from online and digital sources. The majority of U.S. adults now own\nsmartphones or tablets, and most of those Americans say they use them in part to access the news. From 2004\nto 2012, the share of Americans who reported obtaining their news from digital sources increased from 24% to\n39%. How has this affected consumption of print news media, and radio and television news?Figure 3.17and\nthe text below illustrates using the four-step analysis to answer this question.\nFIGURE3.17The Print News Market: A Four-Step AnalysisA change in tastes from print news sources to digital\nsources results in a leftward shift in demand for the former. The result is a decrease in both equilibrium price and\nquantity.\nStep 1. Develop a demand and supply model to think about what the market looked like before the event. The\ndemand curve D and the supply curve S show the original relationships. In this case, we perform the analysis\n0 0\nwithout specific numbers on the price and quantity axis.\nStep 2. Did the described change affect supply or demand? A change in tastes, from traditional news sources\n(print, radio, and television) to digital sources, caused a change in demand for the former.\nStep 3. Was the effect on demand positive or negative? A shift to digital news sources will tend to mean a lower\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.3 \u2022 Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity: The Four-Step Process 67\nquantity demanded of traditional news sources at every given price, causing the demand curve for print and\nother traditional news sources to shift to the left, from D to D .\n0 1\nStep 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium\n(E ) occurs at a lower quantity and a lower price than the original equilibrium (E ).\n1 0\nThe decline in print news reading predates 2004. Print newspaper circulation peaked in 1973 and has\ndeclined since then due to competition from television and radio news. In 1991, 55% of Americans indicated\nthey received their news from print sources, while only 29% did so in 2012. Radio news has followed a similar\npath in recent decades, with the share of Americans obtaining their news from radio declining from 54% in\n1991 to 33% in 2012. Television news has held its own in recent years, with a market share staying in the mid\nto upper fifties. What does this suggest for the future, given that two-thirds of Americans under 30 years old\nsay they do not obtain their news from television at all?\nThe Interconnections and Speed of Adjustment in Real Markets\nIn the real world, many factors that affect demand and supply can change all at once. For example, the demand\nfor cars might increase because of rising incomes and population, and it might decrease because of rising\ngasoline prices (a complementary good). Likewise, the supply of cars might increase because of innovative new\ntechnologies that reduce the cost of car production, and it might decrease as a result of new government\nregulations requiring the installation of costly pollution-control technology.\nMoreover, rising incomes and population or changes in gasoline prices will affect many markets, not just cars.\nHow can an economist sort out all these interconnected events? The answer lies in theceteris paribus\nassumption. Look at how each economic event affects each market, one event at a time, holding all else\nconstant. Then combine the analyses to see the net effect.\nA Combined Example\nThe U.S. Postal Service is facing difficult challenges. Compensation for postal workers tends to increase most\nyears due to cost-of-living increases. At the same time, increasingly more people are using email, text, and\nother digital message forms such as Facebook and Twitter to communicate with friends and others. What does\nthis suggest about the continued viability of the Postal Service?Figure 3.18and the text below illustrate this\nusing the four-step analysis to answer this question.\nFIGURE3.18Higher Compensation for Postal Workers: A Four-Step Analysis(a) Higher labor compensation causes 68 3 \u2022 Demand and Supply\na leftward shift in the supply curve, a decrease in the equilibrium quantity, and an increase in the equilibrium price.\n(b) A change in tastes away from Postal Services causes a leftward shift in the demand curve, a decrease in the\nequilibrium quantity, and a decrease in the equilibrium price.\nSince this problem involves two disturbances, we need two four-step analyses, the first to analyze the effects of\nhigher compensation for postal workers, the second to analyze the effects of many people switching from\n\u201csnail mail\u201d to email and other digital messages.\nFigure 3.18(a) shows the shift in supply discussed in the following steps.\nStep 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate what the market for the U.S. Postal Service looked like\nbefore this scenario starts. The demand curve D and the supply curve S show the original relationships.\n0 0\nStep 2. Did the described change affect supply or demand? Labor compensation is a cost of production. A\nchange in production costs caused a change in supply for the Postal Service.\nStep 3. Was the effect on supply positive or negative? Higher labor compensation leads to a lower quantity\nsupplied of postal services at every given price, causing the supply curve for postal services to shift to the left,\nfrom S to S .\n0 1\nStep 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium\n(E ) occurs at a lower quantity and a higher price than the original equilibrium (E ).\n1 0\nFigure 3.18(b) shows the shift in demand in the following steps.\nStep 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate what the market for U.S. Postal Services looked like\nbefore this scenario starts. The demand curve D and the supply curve S show the original relationships. Note\n0 0\nthat this diagram is independent from the diagram in panel (a).\nStep 2. Did the change described affect supply or demand? A change in tastes away from snail mail toward\ndigital messages will cause a change in demand for the Postal Service.\nStep 3. Was the effect on demand positive or negative? A change in tastes away from snailmail toward digital\nmessages causes lower quantity demanded of postal services at every given price, causing the demand curve\nfor postal services to shift to the left, from D to D .\n0 1\nStep 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium\n(E ) occurs at a lower quantity and a lower price than the original equilibrium (E ).\n2 0\nThe final step in a scenario where both supply and demand shift is to combine the two individual analyses to\ndetermine what happens to the equilibrium quantity and price. Graphically, we superimpose the previous two\ndiagrams one on top of the other, as inFigure 3.19.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.3 \u2022 Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity: The Four-Step Process 69\nFIGURE3.19Combined Effect of Decreased Demand and Decreased SupplySupply and demand shifts cause\nchanges in equilibrium price and quantity.\nFollowing are the results:\nEffect on Quantity: The effect of higher labor compensation on Postal Services because it raises the cost of\nproduction is to decrease the equilibrium quantity. The effect of a change in tastes away from snail mail is to\ndecrease the equilibrium quantity. Since both shifts are to the left, the overall impact is a decrease in the\nequilibrium quantity of Postal Services (Q ). This is easy to see graphically, since Q is to the left of Q .\n3 3 0\nEffect on Price: The overall effect on price is more complicated. The effect of higher labor compensation on\nPostal Services, because it raises the cost of production, is to increase the equilibrium price. The effect of a\nchange in tastes away from snail mail is to decrease the equilibrium price. Since the two effects are in opposite\ndirections, unless we know the magnitudes of the two effects, the overall effect is unclear. This is not unusual.\nWhen both curves shift, typically we can determine the overall effect on price or on quantity, but not on both.\nIn this case, we determined the overall effect on the equilibrium quantity, but not on the equilibrium price. In\nother cases, it might be the opposite.\nThe next Clear It Up feature focuses on the difference between shifts of supply or demand and movements\nalong a curve.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat is the difference between shifts of demand or supply versus movements along a demand or\nsupply curve?\nOne common mistake in applying the demand and supply framework is to confuse the shift of a demand or a supply\ncurve with movement along a demand or supply curve. As an example, consider a problem that asks whether a\ndrought will increase or decrease the equilibrium quantity and equilibrium price of wheat. Lee, a student in an\nintroductory economics class, might reason:\n\u201cWell, it is clear that a drought reduces supply, so I will shift back the supply curve, as in the shift from the original\nsupply curve S to S on the diagram (Shift 1). The equilibrium moves from E to E , theequilibrium quantityis lower\n0 1 0 1\nand the equilibrium price is higher. Then, a higher price makes farmers more likely to supply the good, so the supply\ncurve shifts right, as shows the shift from S to S , shows on the diagram (Shift 2), so that the equilibrium now\n1 2\nmoves from E to E . The higher price, however, also reduces demand and so causes demand to shift back, like the\n1 2 70 3 \u2022 Demand and Supply\nshift from the original demand curve, D to D on the diagram (labeled Shift 3), and the equilibrium moves from E to\n0 1 2\nE .\u201d\n3\nFIGURE3.20Shifts of Demand or Supply versus Movements along a Demand or Supply CurveA shift in one curve\nnever causes a shift in the other curve. Rather, a shift in one curve causes a movement along the second curve.\nAt about this point, Lee suspects that this answer is headed down the wrong path. Think about what might be wrong\nwith Lee\u2019s logic, and then read the answer that follows.\nAnswer:Lee\u2019s first step is correct: that is, a drought shifts back the supply curve of wheat and leads to a prediction\nof a lower equilibrium quantity and a higher equilibrium price. This corresponds to a movement along the original\ndemand curve (D ), from E to E . The rest of Lee\u2019s argument is wrong, because it mixes up shifts in supply with\n0 0 1\nquantity supplied, and shifts in demand with quantity demanded. A higher or lower price never shifts the supply\ncurve, as suggested by the shift in supply from S to S . Instead, a price change leads to a movement along a given\n1 2\nsupply curve. Similarly, a higher or lower price never shifts a demand curve, as suggested in the shift from D to D .\n0 1\nInstead, a price change leads to a movement along a given demand curve. Remember, a change in the price of a\ngood never causes the demand or supply curve for that good to shift.\nThink carefully about the timeline of events: What happens first, what happens next? What is cause, what is effect?\nIf you keep the order right, you are more likely to get the analysis correct.\nIn the four-step analysis of how economic events affect equilibrium price and quantity, the movement from the\nold to the new equilibrium seems immediate. As a practical matter, however, prices and quantities often do not\nzoom straight to equilibrium. More realistically, when an economic event causes demand or supply to shift,\nprices and quantities set off in the general direction of equilibrium. Even as they are moving toward one new\nequilibrium, a subsequent change in demand or supply often pushes prices toward another equilibrium.\n3.4Price Ceilings and Price Floors\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain price controls, price ceilings, and price floors\n\u2022 Analyze demand and supply as a social adjustment mechanism\nTo this point in the chapter, we have been assuming that markets are free, that is, they operate with no\ngovernment intervention. In this section, we will explore the outcomes, both anticipated and otherwise, when\ngovernment does intervene in a market either to prevent the price of some good or service from rising \u201ctoo\nhigh\u201d or to prevent the price of some good or service from falling \u201ctoo low\u201d.\nEconomists believe there are a small number of fundamental principles that explain how economic agents\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.4 \u2022 Price Ceilings and Price Floors 71\nrespond in different situations. Two of these principles, which we have already introduced, are the laws of\ndemand and supply.\nGovernments can pass laws affecting market outcomes, but no law can negate these economic principles.\nRather, the principles will become apparent in sometimes unexpected ways, which may undermine the intent\nof the government policy. This is one of the major conclusions of this section.\nControversy sometimes surrounds the prices and quantities established by demand and supply, especially for\nproducts that are considered necessities. In some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on\npoliticians, who may then pass legislation to prevent a certain price from climbing \u201ctoo high\u201d or falling \u201ctoo\nlow.\u201d\nThe demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the incentives that these laws provide\nto control prices, in ways that will often lead to undesirable consequences. Alternative policy tools can often\nachieve the desired goals of price control laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs.\nPrice Ceilings\nLaws that governments enact to regulate prices are calledprice controls. Price controls come in two flavors. A\nprice ceilingkeeps a price from rising above a certain level (the \u201cceiling\u201d), while aprice floorkeeps a price\nfrom falling below a given level (the \u201cfloor\u201d). This section uses the demand and supply framework to analyze\nprice ceilings. The next section discusses price floors.\nA price ceiling is a legal maximum price that one pays for some good or service. A government imposes price\nceilings in order to keep the price of some necessary good or service affordable. For example, in 2005 during\nHurricane Katrina, the price of bottled water increased above $5 per gallon. As a result, many people called for\nprice controls on bottled water to prevent the price from rising so high. In this particular case, the government\ndid not impose a price ceiling, but there are other examples of where price ceilings did occur.\nIn many markets for goods and services, demanders outnumber suppliers. Consumers, who are also potential\nvoters, sometimes unite behind a political proposal to hold down a certain price. In some cities, such as\nAlbany, renters have pressed political leaders to pass rent control laws, a price ceiling that usually works by\nstating that landlords can raise rents by only a certain maximum percentage each year. Some of the best\nexamples of rent control occur in urban areas such as New York, Washington D.C., or San Francisco.\nRent control becomes a politically hot topic when rents begin to rise rapidly. Everyone needs an affordable\nplace to live. Perhaps a change in tastes makes a certain suburb or town a more popular place to live. Perhaps\nlocally-based businesses expand, bringing higher incomes and more people into the area. Such changes can\ncause a change in the demand for rental housing, asFigure 3.21illustrates. The original equilibrium (E ) lies at\n0\nthe intersection of supply curve S and demand curve D , corresponding to an equilibrium price of $500 and\n0 0\nan equilibrium quantity of 15,000 units of rental housing. The effect of greater income or a change in tastes is\nto shift the demand curve for rental housing to the right, as the data inTable 3.7shows and the shift from D to\n0\nD on the graph. In this market, at the new equilibrium E , the price of a rental unit would rise to $600 and the\n1 1\nequilibrium quantity would increase to 17,000 units. 72 3 \u2022 Demand and Supply\nFIGURE3.21A Price Ceiling Example\u2014Rent ControlThe original intersection of demand and supply occurs at E . If\n0\ndemand shifts from D to D , the new equilibrium would be at E \u2014unless a price ceiling prevents the price from\n0 1 1\nrising. If the price is not permitted to rise, the quantity supplied remains at 15,000. However, after the change in\ndemand, the quantity demanded rises to 19,000, resulting in a shortage.\nPrice Original Quantity Supplied Original Quantity Demanded New Quantity Demanded\n$400 12,000 18,000 23,000\n$500 15,000 15,000 19,000\n$600 17,000 13,000 17,000\n$700 19,000 11,000 15,000\n$800 20,000 10,000 14,000\nTABLE3.7Rent Control\nSuppose that a city government passes a rent control law to keep the price at the original equilibrium of $500\nfor a typical apartment. InFigure 3.21, the horizontal line at the price of $500 shows the legally fixed\nmaximum price set by the rent control law. However, the underlying forces that shifted the demand curve to\nthe right are still there. At that price ($500), the quantity supplied remains at the same 15,000 rental units, but\nthe quantity demanded is 19,000 rental units. In other words, the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity\nsupplied, so there is a shortage of rental housing. One of the ironies of price ceilings is that while the price\nceiling was intended to help renters, there are actually fewer apartments rented out under the price ceiling\n(15,000 rental units) than would be the case at the market rent of $600 (17,000 rental units).\nPrice ceilings do not simply benefit renters at the expense of landlords. Rather, some renters (or potential\nrenters) lose their housing as landlords convert apartments to co-ops and condos. Even when the housing\nremains in the rental market, landlords tend to spend less on maintenance and on essentials like heating,\ncooling, hot water, and lighting. The first rule of economics is you do not get something for nothing\u2014everything\nhas an opportunity cost. Thus, if renters obtain \u201ccheaper\u201d housing than the market requires, they tend to also\nend up with lower quality housing.\nPrice ceilings are enacted in an attempt to keep prices low for those who need the product. However, when the\nmarket price is not allowed to rise to the equilibrium level, quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied, and\nthus a shortage occurs. Those who manage to purchase the product at the lower price given by the price ceiling\nwill benefit, but sellers of the product will suffer, along with those who are not able to purchase the product at\nall. Quality is also likely to deteriorate.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.4 \u2022 Price Ceilings and Price Floors 73\nPrice Floors\nA price floor is the lowest price that one can legally pay for some good or service. Perhaps the best-known\nexample of a price floor is the minimum wage, which is based on the view that someone working full time\nshould be able to afford a basic standard of living. The federal minimum wage in 2022 was $7.25 per hour,\nalthough some states and localities have a higher minimum wage. The federal minimum wage yields an annual\nincome for a single person of $15,080, which is slightly higher than the Federal poverty line of $11,880.\nCongress periodically raises the federal minimum wage as the cost of living rises. As of March 2022, the most\nrecent adjustment occurred in 2009, when the federal minimum wage was raised from $6.55 to $7.25.\nPrice floors are sometimes called \u201cprice supports,\u201d because they support a price by preventing it from falling\nbelow a certain level. Around the world, many countries have passed laws to create agricultural price supports.\nFarm prices and thus farm incomes fluctuate, sometimes widely. Even if, on average, farm incomes are\nadequate, some years they can be quite low. The purpose of price supports is to prevent these swings.\nThe most common way price supports work is that the government enters the market and buys up the product,\nadding to demand to keep prices higher than they otherwise would be. According to the Common Agricultural\nPolicy reform effective in 2019, theEuropean Union (EU)will spend about 58 billion euros per year, or 65.5\nbillion dollars per year (with the December 2021 exchange rate), or roughly 36% of the EU budget, on price\nsupports for Europe\u2019s farmers.\nFigure 3.22illustrates the effects of a government program that assures a price above the equilibrium by\nfocusing on the market for wheat in Europe. In the absence of government intervention, the price would adjust\nso that the quantity supplied would equal the quantity demanded at the equilibrium point E , with price P and\n0 0\nquantity Q . However, policies to keep prices high for farmers keep the price above what would have been the\n0\nmarket equilibrium level\u2014the price Pf shown by the dashed horizontal line in the diagram. The result is a\nquantity supplied in excess of the quantity demanded (Qd). When quantity supplied exceeds quantity\ndemanded, a surplus exists.\nEconomists estimate that the high-income areas of the world, including the United States, Europe, and Japan,\nspend roughly $1 billion per day in supporting their farmers. If the government is willing to purchase the\nexcess supply (or to provide payments for others to purchase it), then farmers will benefit from the price floor,\nbut taxpayers and consumers of food will pay the costs. Agricultural economists and policy makers have\noffered numerous proposals for reducing farm subsidies. In many countries, however, political support for\nsubsidies for farmers remains strong. This is either because the population views this as supporting the\ntraditional rural way of life or because of industry's lobbying power of the agro-business. 74 3 \u2022 Demand and Supply\nFIGURE3.22European Wheat Prices: A Price Floor ExampleThe intersection of demand (D) and supply (S) would\nbe at the equilibrium point E . However, a price floor set at Pf holds the price above E and prevents it from falling.\n0 0\nThe result of the price floor is that the quantity supplied Qs exceeds the quantity demanded Qd. There is excess\nsupply, also called a surplus.\n3.5Demand, Supply, and Efficiency\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Contrast consumer surplus, producer surplus, and social surplus\n\u2022 Explain why price floors and price ceilings can be inefficient\n\u2022 Analyze demand and supply as a social adjustment mechanism\nThe familiardemand and supply diagramholds within it the concept of economic efficiency. One typical way\nthat economists defineefficiencyis when it is impossible to improve the situation of one party without\nimposing a cost on another. Conversely, if a situation is inefficient, it becomes possible to benefit at least one\nparty without imposing costs on others.\nEfficiency in the demand and supply model has the same basic meaning: The economy is getting as much\nbenefit as possible from its scarce resources and all the possible gains from trade have been achieved. In other\nwords, the optimal amount of each good and service is produced and consumed.\nConsumer Surplus, Producer Surplus, Social Surplus\nConsider a market for tablet computers, asFigure 3.23shows. The equilibrium price is $80 and the\nequilibrium quantity is 28 million. To see the benefits to consumers, look at the segment of the demand curve\nabove theequilibriumpoint and to the left. This portion of the demand curve shows that at least some\ndemanders would have been willing to pay more than $80 for a tablet.\nFor example, point J shows that if the price were $90, 20 million tablets would be sold. Those consumers who\nwould have been willing to pay $90 for a tablet based on the utility they expect to receive from it, but who were\nable to pay the equilibrium price of $80, clearly received a benefit beyond what they had to pay. Remember, the\ndemand curve traces consumers\u2019 willingness to pay for different quantities. The amount that individuals\nwould have been willing to pay, minus the amount that they actually paid, is calledconsumer surplus.\nConsumer surplus is the area labeled F\u2014that is, the area above the market price and below the demand curve.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.5 \u2022 Demand, Supply, and Efficiency 75\nFIGURE3.23Consumer and Producer SurplusThe somewhat triangular area labeled by F shows the area of\nconsumer surplus, which shows that the equilibrium price in the market was less than what many of the consumers\nwere willing to pay. Point J on the demand curve shows that, even at the price of $90, consumers would have been\nwilling to purchase a quantity of 20 million. The somewhat triangular area labeled by G shows the area of producer\nsurplus, which shows that the equilibrium price received in the market was more than what many of the producers\nwere willing to accept for their products. For example, point K on the supply curve shows that at a price of $45, firms\nwould have been willing to supply a quantity of 14 million.\nThe supply curve shows the quantity that firms are willing to supply at each price. For example, point K in\nFigure 3.23illustrates that, at $45, firms would still have been willing to supply a quantity of 14 million. Those\nproducers who would have been willing to supply the tablets at $45, but who were instead able to charge the\nequilibrium price of $80, clearly received an extra benefit beyond what they required to supply the product.\nThe extra benefit producers receive from selling a good or service, measured by the price the producer actually\nreceived minus the price the producer would have been willing to accept is calledproducer surplus. InFigure\n3.23, producer surplus is the area labeled G\u2014that is, the area between the market price and the segment of the\nsupply curve below the equilibrium.\nThe sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus issocial surplus, also referred to aseconomic surplusor\ntotal surplus. InFigure 3.23we show social surplus as the area F + G. Social surplus is larger at equilibrium\nquantity and price than it would be at any other quantity. This demonstrates the economic efficiency of the\nmarket equilibrium. In addition, at the efficient level of output, it is impossible to produce greater consumer\nsurplus without reducing producer surplus, and it is impossible to produce greater producer surplus without\nreducing consumer surplus.\nInefficiency of Price Floors and Price Ceilings\nThe imposition of a price floor or a price ceiling will prevent a market from adjusting to its equilibrium price\nand quantity, and thus will create an inefficient outcome. However, there is an additional twist here. Along with\ncreating inefficiency, price floors and ceilings will also transfer some consumer surplus to producers, or some\nproducer surplus to consumers.\nImagine that several firms develop a promising but expensive new drug for treating back pain. If this therapy\nis left to the market, the equilibrium price will be $600 per month and 20,000 people will use the drug, as\nshown inFigure 3.24(a). The original level of consumer surplus is T + U and producer surplus is V + W + X.\nHowever, the government decides to impose a price ceiling of $400 to make the drug more affordable. At this\nprice ceiling, firms in the market now produce only 15,000. 76 3 \u2022 Demand and Supply\nAs a result, two changes occur. First, an inefficient outcome occurs and the total surplus of society is reduced.\nThe loss in social surplus that occurs when the economy produces at an inefficient quantity is called\ndeadweight loss. In a very real sense, it is like money thrown away that benefits no one. InFigure 3.24(a), the\ndeadweight loss is the area U + W. When deadweight loss exists, it is possible for both consumer and producer\nsurplus to be higher, in this case because theprice controlis blocking some suppliers and demanders from\ntransactions they would both be willing to make.\nA second change from theprice ceilingis that some of the producer surplus is transferred to consumers. After\nthe price ceiling is imposed, the new consumer surplus is T + V, while the new producer surplus is X. In other\nwords, the price ceiling transfers the area of surplus (V) from producers to consumers. Note that the gain to\nconsumers is less than the loss to producers, which is just another way of seeing the deadweight loss.\nFIGURE3.24Efficiency and Price Floors and Ceilings(a) The original equilibrium price is $600 with a quantity of\n20,000. Consumer surplus is T + U, and producer surplus is V + W + X. A price ceiling is imposed at $400, so firms in\nthe market now produce only a quantity of 15,000. As a result, the new consumer surplus is T + V, while the new\nproducer surplus is X. (b) The original equilibrium is $8 at a quantity of 1,800. Consumer surplus is G + H + J, and\nproducer surplus is I + K. A price floor is imposed at $12, which means that quantity demanded falls to 1,400. As a\nresult, the new consumer surplus is G, and the new producer surplus is H + I.\nFigure 3.24(b) shows a price floor example using a string of struggling movie theaters, all in the same city. The\ncurrent equilibrium is $8 per movie ticket, with 1,800 people attending movies. The original consumer surplus\nis G + H + J, and producer surplus is I + K. The city government is worried that movie theaters will go out of\nbusiness, reducing the entertainment options available to citizens, so it decides to impose a price floor of $12\nper ticket. As a result, the quantity demanded of movie tickets falls to 1,400. The new consumer surplus is G,\nand the new producer surplus is H + I. In effect, theprice floorcauses the area H to be transferred from\nconsumer to producer surplus, but also causes a deadweight loss of J + K.\nThis analysis shows that a price ceiling, like a law establishing rent controls, will transfer some producer\nsurplus to consumers\u2014which helps to explain why consumers often favor them. Conversely, a price floor like a\nguarantee that farmers will receive a certain price for their crops will transfer some consumer surplus to\nproducers, which explains why producers often favor them. However, both price floors and price ceilings block\nsome transactions that buyers and sellers would have been willing to make, and creates deadweight loss.\nRemoving such barriers, so that prices and quantities can adjust to their equilibrium level, will increase the\neconomy\u2019s social surplus.\nDemand and Supply as a Social Adjustment Mechanism\nThe demand and supply model emphasizes that prices are not set only by demand or only by supply, but by the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.5 \u2022 Demand, Supply, and Efficiency 77\ninteraction between the two. In 1890, the famous economistAlfred Marshallwrote that asking whether supply\nor demand determined a price was like arguing \u201cwhether it is the upper or the under blade of a pair of scissors\nthat cuts a piece of paper.\u201d The answer is that both blades of the demand and supply scissors are always\ninvolved.\nThe adjustments of equilibrium price and quantity in a market-oriented economy often occur without much\ngovernment direction or oversight. If the coffee crop in Brazil suffers a terrible frost, then the supply curve of\ncoffee shifts to the left and the price of coffee rises. Some people continue to drink coffee and pay the higher\nprice. Others switch to tea or soft drinks. No government commission is needed to figure out how to adjust\ncoffee prices, which companies will be allowed to process the remaining supply, which supermarkets in which\ncities will get how much coffee to sell, or which consumers will ultimately be allowed to drink the brew. Such\nadjustments in response to price changes happen all the time in a market economy, often so smoothly and\nrapidly that we barely notice them.\nThink for a moment of all the seasonal foods that are available and inexpensive at certain times of the year, like\nfresh corn in midsummer, but more expensive at other times of the year. People alter their diets and\nrestaurants alter their menus in response to these fluctuations in prices without fuss or fanfare. For both the\nU.S. economy and the world economy as a whole, markets\u2014that is, demand and supply\u2014are the primary social\nmechanism for answering the basic questions about what is produced, how it is produced, and for whom it is\nproduced.\nBRING IT HOME\nWhy Can We Not Get Enough of Organic Food?\nOrganic food is grown without synthetic pesticides, chemical fertilizers or genetically modified seeds. In recent\ndecades, the demand for organic products has increased dramatically. The Organic Trade Association reported sales\nincreased from $1 billion in 1990 to nearly $62 billion in 2020, more than 90% of which were sales of food\nproducts.\nWhy, then, are organic foods more expensive than their conventional counterparts? The answer is a clear application\nof the theories of supply and demand. As people have learned more about the harmful effects of chemical fertilizers,\ngrowth hormones, pesticides and the like from large-scale factory farming, our tastes and preferences for safer,\norganic foods have increased. This change in tastes has been reinforced by increases in income, which allow people\nto purchase pricier products, and has made organic foods more mainstream. This shift, in addition to population\ngrowth, has led to an increased demand for organic foods. Graphically, the demand curve has shifted right, and we\nhave moved up the supply curve as producers have responded to the higher prices by supplying a greater quantity.\nIn addition to the movement along the supply curve, we have also had an increase in the number of farmers\nconverting to organic farming over time. This is represented by a shift to the right of the supply curve. Since both\ndemand and supply have shifted to the right, the resulting equilibrium quantity of organic foods is definitely higher,\nbut the price will only fall when the increase in supply is larger than the increase in demand. We may need more\ntime before we see lower prices in organic foods. Since the production costs of these foods may remain higher than\nconventional farming, because organic fertilizers and pest management techniques are more expensive, they may\nnever fully catch up with the lower prices of non-organic foods.\nAs a final, specific example: The Environmental Working Group\u2019s \u201cDirty Dozen\u201d list of fruits and vegetables, which\ntest high for pesticide residue even after washing, was released in April 2013. The inclusion of strawberries on the\nlist led to an increase in demand for organic strawberries, resulting in both a higher equilibrium price and quantity of\nsales. 78 3 \u2022 Key Terms\nKey Terms\nceteris paribus other things being equal\ncomplements goods that are often used together so that consumption of one good tends to enhance\nconsumption of the other\nconsumer surplus the extra benefit consumers receive from buying a good or service, measured by what the\nindividuals would have been willing to pay minus the amount that they actually paid\ndeadweight loss the loss in social surplus that occurs when a market produces an inefficient quantity\ndemand the relationship between price and the quantity demanded of a certain good or service\ndemand curve a graphic representation of the relationship between price and quantity demanded of a certain\ngood or service, with quantity on the horizontal axis and the price on the vertical axis\ndemand schedule a table that shows a range of prices for a certain good or service and the quantity demanded\nat each price\neconomic surplus see social surplus\nequilibrium the situation where quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied; the combination of\nprice and quantity where there is no economic pressure from surpluses or shortages that would cause\nprice or quantity to change\nequilibrium price the price where quantity demanded is equal to quantity supplied\nequilibrium quantity the quantity at which quantity demanded and quantity supplied are equal for a certain\nprice level\nexcess demand at the existing price, the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied; also called a\nshortage\nexcess supply at the existing price, quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded; also called a surplus\nfactors of production the resources such as labor, materials, and machinery that are used to produce goods\nand services; also called inputs\ninferior good a good in which the quantity demanded falls as income rises, and in which quantity demanded\nrises and income falls\ninputs the resources such as labor, materials, and machinery that are used to produce goods and services;\nalso called factors of production\nlaw of demand the common relationship that a higher price leads to a lower quantity demanded of a certain\ngood or service and a lower price leads to a higher quantity demanded, while all other variables are held\nconstant\nlaw of supply the common relationship that a higher price leads to a greater quantity supplied and a lower\nprice leads to a lower quantity supplied, while all other variables are held constant\nnormal good a good in which the quantity demanded rises as income rises, and in which quantity demanded\nfalls as income falls\nprice what a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service\nprice ceiling a legal maximum price\nprice control government laws to regulate prices instead of letting market forces determine prices\nprice floor a legal minimum price\nproducer surplus the extra benefit producers receive from selling a good or service, measured by the price\nthe producer actually received minus the price the producer would have been willing to accept\nquantity demanded the total number of units of a good or service consumers are willing to purchase at a\ngiven price\nquantity supplied the total number of units of a good or service producers are willing to sell at a given price\nshift in demand when a change in some economic factor (other than price) causes a different quantity to be\ndemanded at every price\nshift in supply when a change in some economic factor (other than price) causes a different quantity to be\nsupplied at every price\nshortage at the existing price, the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied; also called excess\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3 \u2022 Key Concepts and Summary 79\ndemand\nsocial surplus the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus\nsubstitute a good that can replace another to some extent, so that greater consumption of one good can mean\nless of the other\nsupply the relationship between price and the quantity supplied of a certain good or service\nsupply curve a line that shows the relationship between price and quantity supplied on a graph, with quantity\nsupplied on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis\nsupply schedule a table that shows a range of prices for a good or service and the quantity supplied at each\nprice\nsurplus at the existing price, quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded; also called excess supply\ntotal surplus see social surplus\nKey Concepts and Summary\n3.1Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for Goods and Services\nA demand schedule is a table that shows the quantity demanded at different prices in the market. A demand\ncurve shows the relationship between quantity demanded and price in a given market on a graph. The law of\ndemand states that a higher price typically leads to a lower quantity demanded.\nA supply schedule is a table that shows the quantity supplied at different prices in the market. A supply curve\nshows the relationship between quantity supplied and price on a graph. The law of supply says that a higher\nprice typically leads to a higher quantity supplied.\nThe equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity occur where the supply and demand curves cross. The\nequilibrium occurs where the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied. If the price is below the\nequilibrium level, then the quantity demanded will exceed the quantity supplied. Excess demand or a shortage\nwill exist. If the price is above the equilibrium level, then the quantity supplied will exceed the quantity\ndemanded. Excess supply or a surplus will exist. In either case, economic pressures will push the price toward\nthe equilibrium level.\n3.2Shifts in Demand and Supply for Goods and Services\nEconomists often use theceteris paribusor \u201cother things being equal\u201d assumption: while examining the\neconomic impact of one event, all other factors remain unchanged for analysis purposes. Factors that can shift\nthe demand curve for goods and services, causing a different quantity to be demanded at any given price,\ninclude changes in tastes, population, income, prices of substitute or complement goods, and expectations\nabout future conditions and prices. Factors that can shift the supply curve for goods and services, causing a\ndifferent quantity to be supplied at any given price, include input prices, natural conditions, changes in\ntechnology, and government taxes, regulations, or subsidies.\n3.3Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity: The Four-Step Process\nWhen using the supply and demand framework to think about how an event will affect the equilibrium price\nand quantity, proceed through four steps: (1) sketch a supply and demand diagram to think about what the\nmarket looked like before the event; (2) decide whether the event will affect supply or demand; (3) decide\nwhether the effect on supply or demand is negative or positive, and draw the appropriate shifted supply or\ndemand curve; (4) compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original ones.\n3.4Price Ceilings and Price Floors\nPrice ceilings prevent a price from rising above a certain level. When a price ceiling is set below the\nequilibrium price, quantity demanded will exceed quantity supplied, and excess demand or shortages will\nresult. Price floors prevent a price from falling below a certain level. When a price floor is set above the\nequilibrium price, quantity supplied will exceed quantity demanded, and excess supply or surpluses will\nresult. Price floors and price ceilings often lead to unintended consequences. 80 3 \u2022 Self-Check Questions\n3.5Demand, Supply, and Efficiency\nConsumer surplus is the gap between the price that consumers are willing to pay, based on their preferences,\nand the market equilibrium price. Producer surplus is the gap between the price for which producers are\nwilling to sell a product, based on their costs, and the market equilibrium price. Social surplus is the sum of\nconsumer surplus and producer surplus. Total surplus is larger at the equilibrium quantity and price than it\nwill be at any other quantity and price.

As this population grows older, they will be\nfaced with common healthcare issues such as heart conditions, arthritis, and Alzheimer\u2019s that may require\nhospitalization, long-term, or at-home nursing care. Aging baby boomers and advances in life-saving and life-\nextending technologies will increase the demand for healthcare and nursing. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act, 88 4 \u2022 Labor and Financial Markets\nwhich expands access to healthcare for millions of Americans, has further increased the demand.\nThese data tell us, as economists, that the market for healthcare professionals, and nurses in particular, will face\nseveral challenges. Our study of supply and demand will help us to analyze what might happen in the labor market\nfor nursing and other healthcare professionals, as we will discuss in the second half of this case at the end of the\nchapter.\nThe theories of supply and demand do not apply just to markets for goods. They apply to any market, even\nmarkets for things we may not think of as goods and services like labor and financial services. Labor markets\nare markets for employees or jobs. Financial services markets are markets for saving or borrowing.\nWhen we think about demand and supply curves in goods and services markets, it is easy to picture the\ndemanders and suppliers: businesses produce the products and households buy them. Who are the\ndemanders and suppliers in labor and financial service markets? In labor markets job seekers (individuals) are\nthe suppliers of labor, while firms and other employers who hire labor are the demanders for labor. In financial\nmarkets, any individual or firm who saves contributes to the supply of money, and any entity that borrows\n(person, firm, or government) contributes to the demand for money.\nAs a college student, you most likely participate in both labor and financial markets. Employment is a fact of\nlife for most college students: According to the National Center for Educational Statistics, in 2018 43% of full-\ntime college students and 81% of part-time college students were employed. Most college students are also\nheavily involved in financial markets, primarily as borrowers. As of the 2018\u201319 school year, 43% of full-time\nundergraduate students were receiving loan aid to help finance their education, and those loans averaged\n$7,300 per year. Many students also borrow for other expenses, like purchasing a car. As this chapter will\nillustrate, we can analyze labor markets and financial markets with the same tools we use to analyze demand\nand supply in the goods markets.\n4.1Demand and Supply at Work in Labor Markets\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Predict shifts in the demand and supply curves of the labor market\n\u2022 Explain the impact of new technology on the demand and supply curves of the labor market\n\u2022 Explain price floors in the labor market such as minimum wage or a living wage\nMarkets for labor have demand and supply curves, just like markets for goods. The law of demand applies in\nlabor markets this way: A highersalaryorwage\u2014that is, a higher price in the labor market\u2014leads to a\ndecrease in the quantity of labor demanded by employers, while a lower salary or wage leads to an increase in\nthe quantity of labor demanded. The law of supply functions in labor markets, too: A higher price for labor\nleads to a higher quantity of labor supplied; a lower price leads to a lower quantity supplied.\nEquilibrium in the Labor Market\nIn 2020, nearly 41,000 registered nurses worked in the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, Minnesota-\nWisconsin metropolitan area, according to the BLS. They worked for a variety of employers: hospitals, doctors\u2019\noffices, schools, health clinics, and nursing homes.Figure 4.2illustrates how demand and supply determine\nequilibrium in this labor market. The demand and supply schedules inTable 4.1list the quantity supplied and\nquantity demanded of nurses at different salaries.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.1 \u2022 Demand and Supply at Work in Labor Markets 89\nFIGURE4.2Labor Market Example: Demand and Supply for Nurses in Minneapolis-St. Paul-BloomingtonThe\ndemand curve (D) of those employers who want to hire nurses intersects with the supply curve (S) of those who are\nqualified and willing to work as nurses at the equilibrium point (E). The equilibrium salary is $85,000 and the\nequilibrium quantity is 41,000 nurses. At an above-equilibrium salary of $90,000, quantity supplied increases to\n45,000, but the quantity of nurses demanded at the higher pay declines to 40,000. At this above-equilibrium salary,\nan excess supply or surplus of nurses would exist. At a below-equilibrium salary of $75,000, quantity supplied\ndeclines to 34,000, while the quantity demanded at the lower wage increases to 47,000 nurses. At this below-\nequilibrium salary, excess demand or a shortage exists.\nAnnual Salary Quantity Demanded Quantity Supplied\n$70,000 52,000 27,000\n$75,000 47,000 34,000\n$80,000 44,000 38,000\n$85,000 41,000 41,000\n$90,000 40,000 45,000\n$95,000 39,000 48,000\nTABLE4.1Demand and Supply of Nurses in Minneapolis-St.\nPaul-Bloomington\nThe horizontal axis shows the quantity of nurses hired. In this example we measure labor by number of\nworkers, but another common way to measure the quantity of labor is by the number of hours worked. The\nvertical axis shows the price for nurses\u2019 labor\u2014that is, how much they are paid. In the real world, this \u201cprice\u201d\nwould be total labor compensation: salary plus benefits. It is not obvious, but benefits are a significant part (as\nhigh as 30 percent) of labor compensation. In this example we measure the price of labor by salary on an\nannual basis, although in other cases we could measure the price of labor by monthly or weekly pay, or even\nthe wage paid per hour. As the salary for nurses rises, the quantity demanded will fall. Some hospitals and\nnursing homes may reduce the number of nurses they hire, or they may lay off some of their existing nurses,\nrather than pay them higher salaries. Employers who face higher nurses\u2019 salaries may also try to replace some\nnursing functions by investing in physical equipment, like computer monitoring and diagnostic systems to\nmonitor patients, or by using lower-paid health care aides to reduce the number of nurses they need. 90 4 \u2022 Labor and Financial Markets\nAs the salary for nurses rises, the quantity supplied will rise. If nurses\u2019 salaries in Minneapolis-St. Paul-\nBloomington are higher than in other cities, more nurses will move to Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington to\nfind jobs, more people will be willing to train as nurses, and those currently trained as nurses will be more\nlikely to pursue nursing as a full-time job. In other words, there will be more nurses looking for jobs in the\narea.\nAtequilibrium, the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded are equal. Thus, every employer who wants\nto hire a nurse at this equilibrium wage can find a willing worker, and every nurse who wants to work at this\nequilibrium salary can find a job. InFigure 4.2, the supply curve (S) and demand curve (D) intersect at the\nequilibrium point (E). The equilibrium quantity of nurses in the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington area is\n41,000, and the equilibrium salary is $86,000 per year. This example simplifies the nursing market by\nfocusing on the \u201caverage\u201d nurse. In reality, of course, the market for nurses actually comprises many smaller\nmarkets, like markets for nurses with varying degrees of experience and credentials. Many markets contain\nclosely related products that differ in quality. For instance, even a simple product like gasoline comes in\nregular, premium, and super-premium, each with a different price. Even in such cases, discussing the average\nprice of gasoline, like the average salary for nurses, can still be useful because it reflects what is happening in\nmost of the submarkets.\nWhen the price of labor is not at the equilibrium, economic incentives tend to move salaries toward the\nequilibrium. For example, if salaries for nurses in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington were above the\nequilibrium at $90,000 per year, then 43,000 people want to work as nurses, but employers want to hire only\n39,000 nurses. At that above-equilibrium salary, excess supply or a surplus results. In a situation of excess\nsupply in thelabor market, with many applicants for every job opening, employers will have an incentive to\noffer lower wages than they otherwise would have. Nurses\u2019 salary will move down toward equilibrium.\nIn contrast, if the salary is below the equilibrium at, say, $60,000 per year, then a situation of excess demand or\na shortage arises. In this case, employers encouraged by the relatively lower wage want to hire 40,000 nurses,\nbut only 27,000 individuals want to work as nurses at that salary in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington. In\nresponse to the shortage, some employers will offer higher pay to attract the nurses. Other employers will have\nto match the higher pay to keep their own employees. The higher salaries will encourage more nurses to train\nor work in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington. Again, price and quantity in the labor market will move toward\nequilibrium.\nShifts in Labor Demand\nThe demand curve for labor shows the quantity of labor employers wish to hire at any given salary or wage\nrate, under theceteris paribusassumption. A change in the wage or salary will result in a change in the\nquantity demanded of labor. If the wage rate increases, employers will want to hire fewer employees. The\nquantity of labor demanded will decrease, and there will be a movement upward along the demand curve. If\nthe wages and salaries decrease, employers are more likely to hire a greater number of workers. The quantity\nof labor demanded will increase, resulting in a downward movement along the demand curve.\nShifts in the demand curve for labor occur for many reasons. One key reason is that the demand for labor is\nbased on the demand for the good or service that is produced. For example, the more new automobiles\nconsumers demand, the greater the number of workers automakers will need to hire. Therefore the demand\nfor labor is called a \u201cderived demand.\u201d Here are some examples of derived demand for labor:\n\u2022 The demand for chefs is dependent on the demand for restaurant meals.\n\u2022 The demand for pharmacists is dependent on the demand for prescription drugs.\n\u2022 The demand for attorneys is dependent on the demand for legal services.\nAs the demand for the goods and services increases, the demand for labor will increase, or shift to the right, to\nmeet employers\u2019 production requirements. As the demand for the goods and services decreases, the demand\nfor labor will decrease, or shift to the left.Table 4.2shows that in addition to the derived demand for labor,\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.1 \u2022 Demand and Supply at Work in Labor Markets 91\ndemand can also increase or decrease (shift) in response to several factors.\nFactors Results\nDemand for When the demand for the good produced (output) increases, both the output price and profitability\nOutput increase. As a result, producers demand more labor to ramp up production.\nA well-trained and educated workforce causes an increase in the demand for that labor by\nemployers. Increased levels of productivity within the workforce will cause the demand for labor to\nEducation\nshift to the right. If the workforce is not well-trained or educated, employers will not hire from\nand Training\nwithin that labor pool, since they will need to spend a significant amount of time and money\ntraining that workforce. Demand for such will shift to the left.\nTechnology changes can act as either substitutes for or complements to labor. When technology\nacts as a substitute, it replaces the need for the number of workers an employer needs to hire. For\nexample, word processing decreased the number of typists needed in the workplace. This shifted\nthe demand curve for typists left. An increase in the availability of certain technologies may\nincrease the demand for labor. Technology that acts as a complement to labor will increase the\nTechnology demand for certain types of labor, resulting in a rightward shift of the demand curve. For example,\nthe increased use of word processing and other software has increased the demand for information\ntechnology professionals who can resolve software and hardware issues related to a firm\u2019s\nnetwork. More and better technology will increase demand for skilled workers who know how to\nuse technology to enhance workplace productivity. Those workers who do not adapt to changes in\ntechnology will experience a decrease in demand.\nAn increase in the number of companies producing a given product will increase the demand for\nNumber of\nlabor resulting in a shift to the right. A decrease in the number of companies producing a given\nCompanies\nproduct will decrease the demand for labor resulting in a shift to the left.\nComplying with government regulations can increase or decrease the demand for labor at any given\nwage. In the healthcare industry, government rules may require that nurses be hired to carry out\nGovernment\ncertain medical procedures. This will increase the demand for nurses. Less-trained healthcare\nRegulations\nworkers would be prohibited from carrying out these procedures, and the demand for these\nworkers will shift to the left.\nLabor is not the only input into the production process. For example, a salesperson at a call center\nPrice and\nneeds a telephone and a computer terminal to enter data and record sales. If prices of other inputs\nAvailability\nfall, production will become more profitable and suppliers will demand more labor to increase\nof Other\nproduction. This will cause a rightward shift in the demand curve for labor. The opposite is also\nInputs\ntrue. Higher prices for other inputs lower demand for labor.\nTABLE4.2Factors That Can Shift Demand\nLINK IT UP\nClickhere(http://openstax.org/l/Futurework)to read more about \u201cTrends and Challenges for Work in the 21st\nCentury.\u201d\nShifts in Labor Supply\nThe supply of labor is upward-sloping and adheres to the law of supply: The higher the price, the greater the\nquantity supplied and the lower the price, the less quantity supplied. The supply curve models the tradeoff 92 4 \u2022 Labor and Financial Markets\nbetween supplying labor into the market or using time in leisure activities at every given price level. The\nhigher the wage, the more labor is willing to work and forego leisure activities.Table 4.3lists some of the\nfactors that will cause the supply to increase or decrease.\nFactors Results\nAn increased number of workers will cause the supply curve to shift to the right. An increased\nnumber of workers can be due to several factors, such as immigration, increasing population, an\naging population, and changing demographics. Policies that encourage immigration will increase\nNumber of\nthe supply of labor, and vice versa. Population grows when birth rates exceed death rates. This\nWorkers\neventually increases supply of labor when the former reach working age. Another example of\nchanging demographics is more women working outside of the home, which increases the supply\nof labor.\nThe more required education, the lower the supply. There is a lower supply of PhD mathematicians\nRequired\nthan of high school mathematics teachers; there is a lower supply of cardiologists than of primary\nEducation\ncare physicians; and there is a lower supply of physicians than of nurses.\nGovernment policies can also affect the supply of labor for jobs. Alternatively, the government may\nsupport rules that set high qualifications for certain jobs: academic training, certificates or licenses,\nor experience. When these qualifications are made tougher, the number of qualified workers will\ndecrease at any given wage. On the other hand, the government may also subsidize training or even\nreduce the required level of qualifications. For example, government might offer subsidies for\nGovernment nursing schools or nursing students. Such provisions would shift the supply curve of nurses to the\nPolicies right. In addition, government policies that change the relative desirability of working versus not\nworking also affect the labor supply. These include unemployment benefits, maternity leave, child\ncare benefits, and welfare policy. For example, child care benefits may increase the labor supply of\nworking mothers. Long term unemployment benefits may discourage job searching for unemployed\nworkers. All these policies must therefore be carefully designed to minimize any negative labor\nsupply effects.\nTABLE4.3Factors that Can Shift Supply\nA change in salary will lead to a movement along labor demand or labor supply curves, but it will not shift\nthose curves. However, other events like those we have outlined here will cause either the demand or the\nsupply of labor to shift, and thus will move the labor market to a new equilibrium salary and quantity.\nTechnology and Wage Inequality: The Four-Step Process\nEconomic events can change the equilibrium salary (or wage) and quantity of labor. Consider how the wave of\nnew information technologies, like computer and telecommunications networks, has affected low-skill and\nhigh-skill workers in the U.S. economy. From the perspective of employers who demand labor, these new\ntechnologies are often a substitute for low-skill laborers like file clerks who used to keep file cabinets full of\npaper records of transactions. However, the same new technologies are a complement to high-skill workers\nlike managers, who benefit from the technological advances by having the ability to monitor more information,\ncommunicate more easily, and juggle a wider array of responsibilities. How will the new technologies affect the\nwages of high-skill and low-skill workers? For this question, the four-step process of analyzing how shifts in\nsupply or demand affect a market (introduced inDemand and Supply) works in this way:\nStep 1. What did the markets for low-skill labor and high-skill labor look like before the arrival of the new\ntechnologies? InFigure 4.3(a) andFigure 4.3(b), S is the original supply curve for labor and D is the original\n0 0\ndemand curve for labor in each market. In each graph, the original point of equilibrium, E , occurs at the price\n0\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.1 \u2022 Demand and Supply at Work in Labor Markets 93\nW and the quantity Q .\n0 0\nFIGURE4.3Technology and Wages: Applying Demand and Supply(a) The demand for low-skill labor shifts to the\nleft when technology can do the job previously done by these workers. (b) New technologies can also increase the\ndemand for high-skill labor in fields such as information technology and network administration.\nStep 2. Does the new technology affect the supply of labor from households or the demand for labor from\nfirms? The technology change described here affects demand for labor by firms that hire workers.\nStep 3. Will the new technology increase or decrease demand? Based on the description earlier, as the\nsubstitute for low-skill labor becomes available, demand for low-skill labor will shift to the left, from D to D .\n0 1\nAs the technology complement for high-skill labor becomes cheaper, demand for high-skill labor will shift to\nthe right, from D to D .\n0 1\nStep 4. The new equilibrium for low-skill labor, shown as point E with price W and quantity Q , has a lower\n1 1 1\nwage and quantity hired than the original equilibrium, E . The new equilibrium for high-skill labor, shown as\n0\npoint E with price W and quantity Q , has a higher wage and quantity hired than the original equilibrium\n1 1 1\n(E ).\n0\nThus, the demand and supply model predicts that the new computer and communications technologies will\nraise the pay of high-skill workers but reduce the pay of low-skill workers. From the 1970s to the mid-2000s,\nthe wage gap widened between high-skill and low-skill labor. According to the National Center for Education\nStatistics, in 1980, for example, a college graduate earned about 30% more than a high school graduate with\ncomparable job experience, but by 2019, a college graduate earned about 59% more than an otherwise\ncomparable high school graduate. Many economists believe that the trend toward greater wage inequality\nacross the U.S. economy is due to improvements in technology.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/oldtechjobs)to read about ten tech skills that have lost relevance in\ntoday\u2019s workforce.\nPrice Floors in the Labor Market: Living Wages and Minimum Wages\nIn contrast to goods and services markets, price ceilings are rare in labor markets, because rules that prevent\npeople from earning income are not politically popular. There is one exception: boards of trustees or\nstockholders, as an example, propose limits on the high incomes of top business executives. 94 4 \u2022 Labor and Financial Markets\nThe labor market, however, presents some prominent examples of price floors, which are an attempt to\nincrease the wages of low-paid workers. The U.S. government sets aminimum wage, a price floor that makes it\nillegal for an employer to pay employees less than a certain hourly rate. In mid-2009, the U.S. minimum wage\nwas raised to $7.25 per hour. Local political movements in a number of U.S. cities have pushed for a higher\nminimum wage, which they call aliving wage. Promoters of living wage laws maintain that the minimum wage\nis too low to ensure a reasonable standard of living. They base this conclusion on the calculation that, if you\nwork 40 hours a week at a minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for 50 weeks a year, your annual income is\n$14,500, which is less than the official U.S. government definition of what it means for a family to be in poverty.\n(A family with two adults earning minimum wage and two young children will find it more cost efficient for one\nparent to provide childcare while the other works for income. Thus the family income would be $14,500, which\nis significantly lower than the federal poverty line for a family of four, which was $26,500 in 2021.)\nSupporters of the living wage argue that full-time workers should be assured a high enough wage so that they\ncan afford the essentials of life: food, clothing, shelter, and healthcare. Since Baltimore passed the first living\nwage law in 1994, several dozen cities enacted similar laws in the late 1990s and the 2000s. The living wage\nordinances do not apply to all employers, but they have specified that all employees of the city or employees of\nfirms that the city hires be paid at least a certain wage that is usually a few dollars per hour above the U.S.\nminimum wage.\nFigure 4.4illustrates the situation of a city considering a living wage law. For simplicity, we assume that there\nis no federal minimum wage. The wage appears on the vertical axis, because the wage is the price in the labor\nmarket. Before the passage of the living wage law, the equilibrium wage is $10 per hour and the city hires 1,200\nworkers at this wage. However, a group of concerned citizens persuades the city council to enact a living wage\nlaw requiring employers to pay no less than $12 per hour. In response to the higher wage, 1,600 workers look\nfor jobs with the city. At this higher wage, the city, as an employer, is willing to hire only 700 workers. At the\nprice floor, the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, and a surplus of labor exists in this market.\nFor workers who continue to have a job at a higher salary, life has improved. For those who were willing to\nwork at the old wage rate but lost their jobs with the wage increase, life has not improved.Table 4.4shows the\ndifferences in supply and demand at different wages.\nFIGURE4.4A Living Wage: Example of a Price FloorThe original equilibrium in this labor market is a wage of $10/\nhour and a quantity of 1,200 workers, shown at point E. Imposing a wage floor at $12/hour leads to an excess\nsupply of labor. At that wage, the quantity of labor supplied is 1,600 and the quantity of labor demanded is only 700.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.1 \u2022 Demand and Supply at Work in Labor Markets 95\nWage Quantity Labor Demanded Quantity Labor Supplied\n$8/hr 1,900 500\n$9/hr 1,500 900\n$10/hr 1,200 1,200\n$11/hr 900 1,400\n$12/hr 700 1,600\n$13/hr 500 1,800\n$14/hr 400 1,900\nTABLE4.4Living Wage: Example of a Price Floor\nThe Minimum Wage as an Example of a Price Floor\nThe U.S. minimum wage is a price floor that is set either very close to the equilibrium wage or even slightly\nbelow it. About 1.5% of hourly workers in the U.S. are paid the minimum wage. In other words, the vast\nmajority of the U.S. labor force has its wages determined in the labor market, not as a result of the government\nprice floor. However, for workers with low skills and little experience, like those without a high school diploma\nor teenagers, the minimum wage is quite important. In many cities, the federal minimum wage is apparently\nbelow the market price for unskilled labor, because employers offer more than the minimum wage to checkout\nclerks and other low-skill workers without any government prodding.\nEconomists have attempted to estimate how much the minimum wage reduces the quantity demanded of low-\nskill labor. A typical result of such studies is that a 10% increase in the minimum wage would decrease the\nhiring of unskilled workers by 1 to 2%, which seems a relatively small reduction. In fact, some studies have\neven found no effect of a higher minimum wage on employment at certain times and places\u2014although these\nstudies are controversial. Well-known economists Walter Williams and Thomas Sowell, who both focus on the\nintersections of race and economics, argue that minimum wages increase discrimination and limit economic\nmobility. Williams, for example, indicates that higher minimum wages would increase employment barriers\nfor lower-skilled workers, reducing the opportunity for them to learn on the job and gain experience that\nwould give them more choice in employment.\nLet\u2019s suppose that the minimum wage lies just slightlybelowthe equilibrium wage level. Wages could fluctuate\naccording to market forces above this price floor, but they would not be allowed to move beneath the floor. In\nthis situation, the price floor minimum wage isnonbinding\u2014that is, the price floor is not determining the\nmarket outcome. Even if the minimum wage moves just a little higher, it will still have no effect on the quantity\nof employment in the economy, as long as it remains below the equilibrium wage. Even if the government\nincreases the minimum wage by enough so that it rises slightly above the equilibrium wage and becomes\nbinding, there will be only a small excess supply gap between the quantity demanded and quantity supplied.\nThese insights help to explain why U.S. minimum wage laws have historically had only a small impact on\nemployment. Since the minimum wage has typically been set close to the equilibrium wage for low-skill labor\nand sometimes even below it, it has not had a large effect in creating an excess supply of labor. However, if the\nminimum wage increased dramatically\u2014say, if it doubled to match the living wages that some U.S. cities have\nconsidered\u2014then its impact on reducing the quantity demanded of employment would be far greater. The\nfollowing Clear It Up feature describes in greater detail some of the arguments for and against changes to the\nminimum wage. 96 4 \u2022 Labor and Financial Markets\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat\u2019s the harm in raising the minimum wage?\nBecause of the law of demand, a higher required wage will reduce the amount of low-skill employment either in\nterms of employees or in terms of work hours. Although there is controversy over the numbers, let\u2019s say for the sake\nof the argument that a 10% rise in the minimum wage will reduce the employment of low-skill workers by 2%. Does\nthis outcome mean that raising the minimum wage by 10% is bad public policy? Not necessarily.\nIf 98% of those receiving the minimum wage have a pay increase of 10%, but 2% of those receiving the minimum\nwage lose their jobs, are the gains for society as a whole greater than the losses? The answer is not clear, because\njob losses, even for a small group, may cause more pain than modest income gains for others. For one thing, we\nneed to consider which minimum wage workers are losing their jobs. If the 2% of minimum wage workers who lose\ntheir jobs are struggling to support families, that is one thing. If those who lose their job are high school students\npicking up spending money over summer vacation, that is something else.\nAnother complexity is that many minimum wage workers do not work full-time for an entire year. Imagine a\nminimum wage worker who holds different part-time jobs for a few months at a time, with bouts of unemployment\nin between. The worker in this situation receives the 10% raise in the minimum wage when working, but also ends\nup working 2% fewer hours during the year because the higher minimum wage reduces how much employers want\npeople to work. Overall, this worker\u2019s income would rise because the 10% pay raise would more than offset the 2%\nfewer hours worked.\nOf course, these arguments do not prove that raising the minimum wage is necessarily a good idea either. There may\nwell be other, better public policy options for helping low-wage workers. (ThePoverty and Economic Inequality\nchapter discusses some possibilities.) The lesson from this maze of minimum wage arguments is that complex\nsocial problems rarely have simple answers. Even those who agree on how a proposed economic policy affects\nquantity demanded and quantity supplied may still disagree on whether the policy is a good idea.\n4.2Demand and Supply in Financial Markets\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Identify the demanders and suppliers in a financial market\n\u2022 Explain how interest rates can affect supply and demand\n\u2022 Analyze the economic effects of U.S. debt in terms of domestic financial markets\n\u2022 Explain the role of price ceilings and usury laws in the U.S.\nUnited States' households, institutions, and domestic businesses saved almost $1.3 trillion in 2015. Where did\nthat savings go and how was it used? Some of the savings ended up in banks, which in turn loaned the money\nto individuals or businesses that wanted to borrow money. Some was invested in private companies or loaned\nto government agencies that wanted to borrow money to raise funds for purposes like building roads or mass\ntransit. Some firms reinvested their savings in their own businesses.\nIn this section, we will determine how the demand and supply model links those who wish to supplyfinancial\ncapital(i.e., savings) with those who demand financial capital (i.e., borrowing). Those who save money (or\nmake financial investments, which is the same thing), whether individuals or businesses, are on the supply\nside of the financial market. Those who borrow money are on the demand side of the financial market. For a\nmore detailed treatment of the different kinds of financial investments like bank accounts, stocks and bonds,\nsee theFinancial Marketschapter.\nWho Demands and Who Supplies in Financial Markets?\nIn any market, the price is what suppliers receive and what demanders pay. In financial markets, those who\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.2 \u2022 Demand and Supply in Financial Markets 97\nsupply financial capital through saving expect to receive a rate of return, while those who demand financial\ncapital by receiving funds expect to pay a rate of return. This rate of return can come in a variety of forms,\ndepending on the type of investment.\nThe simplest example of a rate of return is theinterest rate. For example, when you supply money into a\nsavings account at a bank, you receive interest on your deposit. The interest the bank pays you as a percent of\nyour deposits is the interest rate. Similarly, if you demand a loan to buy a car or a computer, you will need to\npay interest on the money you borrow.\nLet\u2019s consider the market for borrowing money with credit cards. In 2021, almost 200 million Americans were\ncardholders. Credit cards allow you to borrow money from the card's issuer, and pay back the borrowed\namount plus interest, although most allow you a period of time in which you can repay the loan without paying\ninterest. A typical credit card interest rate ranges from 12% to 18% per year. In May 2021, Americans had\nabout $807 billion outstanding in credit card debts. As of 2021, just over 45% of American families carried\nsome credit card debt. Let\u2019s say that, on average, the annual interest rate for credit card borrowing is 15% per\nyear. Thus, Americans pay tens of billions of dollars every year in interest on their credit cards\u2014plus basic fees\nfor the credit card or fees for late payments.\nFigure 4.5illustrates demand and supply in the financial market for credit cards. The horizontal axis of the\nfinancial market shows the quantity of money loaned or borrowed in this market. The vertical or price axis\nshows the rate of return, which in the case of credit card borrowing we can measure with an interest rate.Table\n4.5shows the quantity of financial capital that consumers demand at various interest rates and the quantity\nthat credit card firms (often banks) are willing to supply.\nFIGURE4.5Demand and Supply for Borrowing Money with Credit CardsIn this market for credit card borrowing,\nthe demand curve (D) for borrowing financial capital intersects the supply curve (S) for lending financial capital at\nequilibrium E. At the equilibrium, the interest rate (the \u201cprice\u201d in this market) is 15% and the quantity of financial\ncapital loaned and borrowed is $600 billion. The equilibrium price is where the quantity demanded and the quantity\nsupplied are equal. At an above-equilibrium interest rate like 21%, the quantity of financial capital supplied would\nincrease to $750 billion, but the quantity demanded would decrease to $480 billion. At a below-equilibrium interest\nrate like 13%, the quantity of financial capital demanded would increase to $700 billion, but the quantity of financial\ncapital supplied would decrease to $510 billion. 98 4 \u2022 Labor and Financial Markets\nInterest Quantity of Financial Capital Demanded Quantity of Financial Capital Supplied\nRate (%) (Borrowing) ($ billions) (Lending) ($ billions)\n11 $800 $420\n13 $700 $510\n15 $600 $600\n17 $550 $660\n19 $500 $720\n21 $480 $750\nTABLE4.5Demand and Supply for Borrowing Money with Credit Cards\nThe laws of demand and supply continue to apply in the financial markets. According to thelaw of demand, a\nhigher rate of return (that is, a higher price) will decrease the quantity demanded. As the interest rate rises,\nconsumers will reduce the quantity that they borrow. According to the law of supply, a higher price increases\nthe quantity supplied. Consequently, as the interest rate paid on credit card borrowing rises, more firms will be\neager to issue credit cards and to encourage customers to use them. Conversely, if the interest rate on credit\ncards falls, the quantity of financial capital supplied in the credit card market will decrease and the quantity\ndemanded will increase.\nEquilibrium in Financial Markets\nIn the financial market for credit cards inFigure 4.5, the supply curve (S) and the demand curve (D) cross at\nthe equilibrium point (E). The equilibrium occurs at an interest rate of 15%, where the quantity of funds\ndemanded and the quantity supplied are equal at an equilibrium quantity of $600 billion.\nIf the interest rate (remember, this measures the \u201cprice\u201d in the financial market) is above the equilibrium level,\nthen an excess supply, or a surplus, of financial capital will arise in this market. For example, at an interest rate\nof 21%, the quantity of funds supplied increases to $750 billion, while the quantity demanded decreases to\n$480 billion. At this above-equilibrium interest rate, firms are eager to supply loans to credit card borrowers,\nbut relatively few people or businesses wish to borrow. As a result, some credit card firms will lower the\ninterest rates (or other fees) they charge to attract more business. This strategy will push the interest rate down\ntoward the equilibrium level.\nIf the interest rate is below the equilibrium, then excess demand or a shortage of funds occurs in this market.\nAt an interest rate of 13%, the quantity of funds credit card borrowers demand increases to $700 billion, but\nthe quantity credit card firms are willing to supply is only $510 billion. In this situation, credit card firms will\nperceive that they are overloaded with eager borrowers and conclude that they have an opportunity to raise\ninterest rates or fees. The interest rate will face economic pressures to creep up toward the equilibrium level.\nThe FRED database publishes some two dozen measures of interest rates, including interest rates on credit\ncards, automobile loans, personal loans, mortgage loans, and more. You can find these at the FREDwebsite\n(https://openstax.org/l/FRED_stlouis).\nShifts in Demand and Supply in Financial Markets\nThose who supply financial capital face two broad decisions: how much to save, and how to divide up their\nsavings among different forms of financial investments. We will discuss each of these in turn.\nParticipants in financial markets must decide when they prefer to consume goods: now or in the future.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.2 \u2022 Demand and Supply in Financial Markets 99\nEconomists call thisintertemporal decision makingbecause it involves decisions across time. Unlike a\ndecision about what to buy from the grocery store, people make investment or savings decisions across a\nperiod of time, sometimes a long period.\nMost workers save for retirement because their income in the present is greater than their needs, while the\nopposite will be true once they retire. Thus, they save today and supply financial markets. If their income\nincreases, they save more. If their perceived situation in the future changes, they change the amount of their\nsaving. For example, there is some evidence that Social Security, the program that workers pay into in order to\nqualify for government checks after retirement, has tended to reduce the quantity of financial capital that\nworkers save. If this is true, Social Security has shifted the supply of financial capital at any interest rate to the\nleft.\nBy contrast, many college students need money today when their income is low (or nonexistent) to pay their\ncollege expenses. As a result, they borrow today and demand from financial markets. Once they graduate and\nbecome employed, they will pay back the loans. Individuals borrow money to purchase homes or cars. A\nbusiness seeks financial investment so that it has the funds to build a factory or invest in a research and\ndevelopment project that will not pay off for five years, ten years, or even more. Thus, when consumers and\nbusinesses have greater confidence that they will be able to repay in the future, the quantity demanded of\nfinancial capital at any given interest rate will shift to the right.\nFor example, in the technology boom of the late 1990s, many businesses became extremely confident that\ninvestments in new technology would have a high rate of return, and their demand for financial capital shifted\nto the right. Conversely, during the 2008 and 2009 Great Recession, their demand for financial capital at any\ngiven interest rate shifted to the left.\nTo this point, we have been looking at saving in total. Now let us consider what affects saving in different types\nof financial investments. In deciding between different forms of financial investments, suppliers of financial\ncapital will have to consider the rates of return and the risks involved. Rate of return is a positive attribute of\ninvestments, but risk is a negative. If Investment A becomes more risky, or the return diminishes, then savers\nwill shift their funds to Investment B\u2014and the supply curve of financial capital for Investment A will shift back\nto the left while the supply curve of capital for Investment B shifts to the right.\nThe United States as a Global Borrower\nIn the global economy, trillions of dollars of financial investment cross national borders every year. In the early\n2000s, financial investors from foreign countries were investing several hundred billion dollars per year more\nin the U.S. economy than U.S. financial investors were investing abroad. The following Work It Out deals with\none of the macroeconomic concerns for the U.S. economy in recent years.\nWORK IT OUT\nThe Effect of Growing U.S. Debt\nImagine that foreign investors viewed the U.S. economy as a less desirable place to put their money because of\nfears about the growth of the U.S. public debt. Using the four-step process for analyzing how changes in supply\nand demand affect equilibrium outcomes, how would increased U.S. public debt affect the equilibrium price and\nquantity for capital in U.S. financial markets?\nStep 1. Draw a diagram showing demand and supply for financial capital that represents the original scenario in\nwhich foreign investors are pouring money into the U.S. economy.Figure 4.6shows a demand curve, D, and a\nsupply curve, S, where the supply of capital includes the funds arriving from foreign investors. The original\nequilibrium E occurs at interest rate R and quantity of financial investment Q .\n0 0 0 100 4 \u2022 Labor and Financial Markets\nFIGURE4.6The United States as a Global Borrower Before U.S. Debt UncertaintyThe graph shows the demand\nfor financial capital from and supply of financial capital into the U.S. financial markets by the foreign sector\nbefore the increase in uncertainty regarding U.S. public debt. The original equilibrium (E ) occurs at an\n0\nequilibrium rate of return (R ) and the equilibrium quantity is at Q .\n0 0\nStep 2. Will the diminished confidence in the U.S. economy as a place to invest affect demand or supply of\nfinancial capital? Yes, it will affect supply. Many foreign investors look to the U.S. financial markets to store their\nmoney in safe financial vehicles with low risk and stable returns. Diminished confidence means U.S. financial\nassets will be seen as more risky.\nStep 3. Will supply increase or decrease? When the enthusiasm of foreign investors\u2019 for investing their money in\nthe U.S. economy diminishes, the supply of financial capital shifts to the left.Figure 4.7shows the supply curve\nshift from S to S .\n0 1\nFIGURE4.7The United States as a Global Borrower Before and After U.S. Debt UncertaintyThe graph shows the\ndemand for financial capital and supply of financial capital into the U.S. financial markets by the foreign sector\nbefore and after the increase in uncertainty regarding U.S. public debt. The original equilibrium (E ) occurs at an\n0\nequilibrium rate of return (R ) and the equilibrium quantity is at Q .\n0 0\nStep 4. Thus, foreign investors\u2019 diminished enthusiasm leads to a new equilibrium, E , which occurs at the higher\n1\ninterest rate, R , and the lower quantity of financial investment, Q . In short, U.S. borrowers will have to pay more\n1 1\ninterest on their borrowing.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.2 \u2022 Demand and Supply in Financial Markets 101\nThe economy has experienced an enormous inflow of foreign capital. According to the U.S. Bureau of\nEconomic Analysis, by the third quarter of 2021, U.S. investors had accumulated $34.45 trillion of foreign\nassets, but foreign investors owned a total of $50.53 trillion of U.S. assets. If foreign investors were to pull their\nmoney out of the U.S. economy and invest elsewhere in the world, the result could be a significantly lower\nquantity of financial investment in the United States, available only at a higher interest rate. This reduced\ninflow of foreign financial investment could impose hardship on U.S. consumers and firms interested in\nborrowing.\nIn a modern, developed economy, financial capital often moves invisibly through electronic transfers between\none bank account and another. Yet we can analyze these flows of funds with the same tools of demand and\nsupply as markets for goods or labor.\nPrice Ceilings in Financial Markets: Usury Laws\nAs we noted earlier, about 200 million Americans own credit cards, and their interest payments and fees total\ntens of billions of dollars each year. It is little wonder that political pressures sometimes arise for setting limits\non the interest rates or fees that credit card companies charge. The firms that issue credit cards, including\nbanks, oil companies, phone companies, and retail stores, respond that the higher interest rates are necessary\nto cover the losses created by those who borrow on their credit cards and who do not repay on time or at all.\nThese companies also point out that cardholders can avoid paying interest if they pay their bills on time.\nConsider the credit card market asFigure 4.8illustrates. In this financial market, the vertical axis shows the\ninterest rate (which is the price in the financial market). Demanders in the credit card market are households\nand businesses. Suppliers are the companies that issue credit cards. This figure does not use specific\nnumbers, which would be hypothetical in any case, but instead focuses on the underlying economic\nrelationships. Imagine a law imposes a price ceiling that holds the interest rate charged on credit cards at the\nrate Rc, which lies below the interest rate R that would otherwise have prevailed in the market. The horizontal\n0\ndashed line at interest rate R inFigure 4.8shows the price ceiling. The demand and supply model predicts\nc\nthat at the lower price ceiling interest rate, the quantity demanded of credit card debt will increase from its\noriginal level of Q to Qd; however, the quantity supplied of credit card debt will decrease from the original Q\n0 0\nto Qs. At the price ceiling (Rc), quantity demanded will exceed quantity supplied. Consequently, a number of\npeople who want to have credit cards and are willing to pay the prevailing interest rate will find that companies\nare unwilling to issue cards to them. The result will be a credit shortage.\nFIGURE4.8Credit Card Interest Rates: Another Price Ceiling ExampleThe original intersection of demand D and\nsupply S occurs at equilibrium E . However, a price ceiling is set at the interest rate Rc, below the equilibrium\n0\ninterest rate R , and so the interest rate cannot adjust upward to the equilibrium. At the price ceiling, the quantity\n0\ndemanded, Qd, exceeds the quantity supplied, Qs. There is excess demand, also called a shortage. 102 4 \u2022 Labor and Financial Markets\nMany states do haveusury laws, which impose an upper limit on the interest rate that lenders can charge.\nHowever, in many cases these upper limits are well above the market interest rate. For example, if the interest\nrate is not allowed to rise above 30% per year, it can still fluctuate below that level according to market forces.\nA price ceiling that is set at a relatively high level is nonbinding, and it will have no practical effect unless the\nequilibrium price soars high enough to exceed the price ceiling.\n4.3The Market System as an Efficient Mechanism for Information\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Apply demand and supply models to analyze prices and quantities\n\u2022 Explain the effects of price controls on the equilibrium of prices and quantities\nPrices exist in markets for goods and services, for labor, and for financial capital. In all of these markets, prices\nserve as a remarkable social mechanism for collecting, combining, and transmitting information that is\nrelevant to the market\u2014namely, the relationship between demand and supply\u2014and then serving as\nmessengers to convey that information to buyers and sellers. In a market-oriented economy, no government\nagency or guiding intelligence oversees the set of responses and interconnections that result from a change in\nprice. Instead, each consumer reacts according to that person\u2019s preferences and budget set, and each profit-\nseeking producer reacts to the impact on its expected profits. The following Clear It Up feature examines the\ndemand and supply models.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhy are demand and supply curves important?\nThe demand and supply model is the second fundamental diagram for this course. (The opportunity set model that\nwe introduced in theChoice in a World of Scarcitychapter was the first.) Just as it would be foolish to try to learn the\narithmetic of long division by memorizing every possible combination of numbers that can be divided by each other,\nit would be foolish to try to memorize every specific example of demand and supply in this chapter, this textbook, or\nthis course. Demand and supply is not primarily a list of examples. It is a model to analyze prices and quantities.\nEven though demand and supply diagrams have many labels, they are fundamentally the same in their logic. Your\ngoal should be to understand the underlying model so you can use it to analyzeanymarket.\nFigure 4.9displays a generic demand and supply curve. The horizontal axis shows the different measures of\nquantity: a quantity of a good or service, or a quantity of labor for a given job, or a quantity of financial capital. The\nvertical axis shows a measure of price: the price of a good or service, the wage in the labor market, or the rate of\nreturn (like the interest rate) in the financial market.\nThe demand and supply model can explain the existing levels of prices, wages, and rates of return. To carry out such\nan analysis, think about the quantity that will be demanded at each price and the quantity that will be supplied at\neach price\u2014that is, think about the shape of the demand and supply curves\u2014and how these forces will combine to\nproduce equilibrium.\nWe can also use demand and supply to explain how economic events will cause changes in prices, wages, and rates\nof return. There are only four possibilities: the change in any single event may cause the demand curve to shift right\nor to shift left, or it may cause the supply curve to shift right or to shift left. The key to analyzing the effect of an\neconomic event on equilibrium prices and quantities is to determine which of these four possibilities occurred. The\nway to do this correctly is to think back to the list of factors that shift the demand and supply curves. Note that if\nmore than one variable is changing at the same time, the overall impact will depend on the degree of the shifts.\nWhen there are multiple variables, economists isolate each change and analyze it independently.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.3 \u2022 The Market System as an Efficient Mechanism for Information 103\nFIGURE4.9Demand and Supply CurvesThe figure displays a generic demand and supply curve. The horizontal axis\nshows the different measures of quantity: a quantity of a good or service, a quantity of labor for a given job, or a\nquantity of financial capital. The vertical axis shows a measure of price: the price of a good or service, the wage in\nthe labor market, or the rate of return (like the interest rate) in the financial market. We can use the demand and\nsupply curves explain how economic events will cause changes in prices, wages, and rates of return.\nAn increase in the price of some product signals consumers that there is a shortage; therefore, they may want\nto economize on buying this product. For example, if you are thinking about taking a plane trip to Hawaii, but\nthe ticket turns out to be expensive during the week you intend to go, you might consider other weeks when the\nticket might be cheaper. The price could be high because you were planning to travel during a holiday when\ndemand for traveling is high. Maybe the cost of an input like jet fuel increased or the airline has raised the\nprice temporarily to see how many people are willing to pay it. Perhaps all of these factors are present at the\nsame time. You do not need to analyze the market and break down the price change into its underlying factors.\nYou just have to look at the ticket price and decide whether and when to fly.\nIn the same way, price changes provide useful information to producers. Imagine the situation of a farmer who\ngrows oats and learns that the price of oats has risen. The higher price could be due to an increase in demand\ncaused by a new scientific study proclaiming that eating oats is especially healthful. Perhaps the price of a\nsubstitute grain, like corn, has risen, and people have responded by buying more oats. The oat farmer does not\nneed to know the details. The farmer only needs to know that the price of oats has risen and that it will be\nprofitable to expand production as a result.\nThe actions of individual consumers and producers as they react to prices overlap and interlock in markets for\ngoods, labor, and financial capital. A change in any single market is transmitted through these multiple\ninterconnections to other markets. The vision of the role of flexible prices helping markets to reach\nequilibrium and linking different markets together helps to explain whyprice controlscan be so\ncounterproductive. Price controls are government laws that serve to regulate prices rather than allow the\nvarious markets to determine prices. There is an old proverb: \u201cDon\u2019t kill the messenger.\u201d In ancient times,\nmessengers carried information between distant cities and kingdoms. When they brought bad news, there was\nan emotional impulse to kill the messenger. However, killing the messenger did not kill the bad news.\nMoreover, killing the messenger had an undesirable side effect: Other messengers would refuse to bring news\nto that city or kingdom, depriving its citizens of vital information.\nThose who seek price controls are trying to kill the messenger\u2014or at least to stifle an unwelcome message that\nprices are bringing about the equilibrium level of price and quantity. However, price controls do nothing to\naffect the underlying forces of demand and supply, and this can have serious repercussions. During China\u2019s 104 4 \u2022 Labor and Financial Markets\n\u201cGreat Leap Forward\u201d in the late 1950s, the government kept food prices artificially low, with the result that 30\nto 40 million people died of starvation because the low prices depressed farm production. This was communist\nparty leader Mao Zedong's social and economic campaign to rapidly transform the country from an agrarian\neconomy to a socialist society through rapid industrialization and collectivization. Changes in demand and\nsupply will continue to reveal themselves through consumers\u2019 and producers\u2019 behavior. Immobilizing the price\nmessenger through price controls will deprive everyone in the economy of critical information. Without this\ninformation, it becomes difficult for everyone\u2014buyers and sellers alike\u2014to react in a flexible and appropriate\nmanner as changes occur throughout the economy.\nBRING IT HOME\nBaby Boomers Come of Age\nThe theory of supply and demand can explain what happens in the labor markets and suggests that the demand for\nnurses will increase as healthcare needs of baby boomers increase, asFigure 4.10shows. The impact of that\nincrease will result in an average salary higher than the $75,330 earned in 2020 referenced in the first part of this\ncase. The new equilibrium (E ) will be at the new equilibrium price (Pe ).Equilibrium quantity will also increase from\n1 1\nQe to Qe .\n0 1\nFIGURE4.10Impact of Increasing Demand for Nurses 2020\u20132030In 2020, the median salary for nurses was\n$75,330. As demand for services increases, the demand curve shifts to the right (from D to D ) and the equilibrium\n0 1\nquantity of nurses increases from Qe to Qe . The equilibrium salary increases from Pe to Pe .\n0 1 0 1\nSuppose that as the demand for nurses increases, the supply shrinks due to an increasing number of nurses\nentering retirement and increases in the tuition of nursing degrees. The leftward shift of the supply curve inFigure\n4.11captures the impact of a decreasing supply of nurses. The shifts in the two curves result in higher salaries for\nnurses, but the overall impact on the quantity of nurses is uncertain, as it depends on the relative shifts of supply\nand demand.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.3 \u2022 The Market System as an Efficient Mechanism for Information 105\nFIGURE4.11Impact of Decreasing Supply of Nurses between 2020 and 2030The increase in demand for nurses\nshown in Figure 4.10 leads to both higher prices and higher quantities demanded. As nurses retire from the work\nforce, the supply of nurses decreases, causing a leftward shift in the supply curve and higher salaries for nurses at\nPe . The net effect on the equilibrium quantity of nurses is uncertain, which in this representation is less than Qe ,\n2 1\nbut more than the initial Qe .\n0\nWhile we do not know if the number of nurses will increase or decrease relative to their initial employment, we know\nthey will have higher salaries. 106 4 \u2022 Key Terms\nKey Terms\ninterest rate the \u201cprice\u201d of borrowing in the financial market; a rate of return on an investment\nminimum wage a price floor that makes it illegal for an employer to pay employees less than a certain hourly\nrate\nusury laws laws that impose an upper limit on the interest rate that lenders can charge\nKey Concepts and Summary\n4.1Demand and Supply at Work in Labor Markets\nIn the labor market, households are on the supply side of the market and firms are on the demand side. In the\nmarket for financial capital, households and firms can be on either side of the market: they are suppliers of\nfinancial capital when they save or make financial investments, and demanders of financial capital when they\nborrow or receive financial investments.\nIn the demand and supply analysis of labor markets, we can measure the price by the annual salary or hourly\nwage received. We can measure the quantity of labor various ways, like number of workers or the number of\nhours worked.\nFactors that can shift the demand curve for labor include: a change in the quantity demanded of the product\nthat the labor produces; a change in the production process that uses more or less labor; and a change in\ngovernment policy that affects the quantity of labor that firms wish to hire at a given wage. Demand can also\nincrease or decrease (shift) in response to: workers\u2019 level of education and training, technology, the number of\ncompanies, and availability and price of other inputs.\nThe main factors that can shift the supply curve for labor are: how desirable a job appears to workers relative\nto the alternatives, government policy that either restricts or encourages the quantity of workers trained for\nthe job, the number of workers in the economy, and required education.\n4.2Demand and Supply in Financial Markets\nIn the demand and supply analysis of financial markets, the \u201cprice\u201d is the rate of return or the interest rate\nreceived. We measure the quantity by the money that flows from those who supply financial capital to those\nwho demand it.\nTwo factors can shift the supply of financial capital to a certain investment: if people want to alter their\nexisting levels of consumption, and if the riskiness or return on one investment changes relative to other\ninvestments. Factors that can shift demand for capital include business confidence and consumer confidence\nin the future\u2014since financial investments received in the present are typically repaid in the future.\n4.3The Market System as an Efficient Mechanism for Information\nThe market price system provides a highly efficient mechanism for disseminating information about relative\nscarcities of goods, services, labor, and financial capital. Market participants do not need to know why prices\nhave changed, only that the changes require them to revisit previous decisions they made about supply and\ndemand. Price controls hide information about the true scarcity of products and thereby cause misallocation\nof resources.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

Instead of $3\nfor a cup of coffee, you will now be charged $2 for coffee, $1 for creamer, and $1 for your choice of sweetener. If you\npay your usual $3 for a cup of coffee, you must choose between creamer and sweetener. If you want both, you now\nface an extra charge of $1. Sound absurd? Well, that is similar to the situation Netflix customers found themselves 112 5 \u2022 Elasticity\nin\u2014they faced a 60% price hike to retain the same service in 2011.\nIn early 2011, Netflix consumers paid about $10 a month for a package consisting of streaming video and DVD\nrentals. In July 2011, the company announced a packaging change. Customers wishing to retain both streaming\nvideo and DVD rental would be charged $15.98 per month, a price increase of about 60%. In 2014, Netflix also\nraised its streaming video subscription price from $7.99 to $8.99 per month for new U.S. customers. The company\nalso changed its policy of 4K streaming content from $9.00 to $12.00 per month that year.\nHow would customers of the 18-year-old firm react? Would they abandon Netflix? Would the ease of access to other\nvenues make a difference in how consumers responded to the Netflix price change? At the time, Netflix had few\ncompetitors; in the intervening years, the field has grown to ten major competitors and nearly 200 smaller ones. Is\nthat likely to have a greater impact than the price changes? We will explore the answers to those questions in this\nchapter, which focuses on the change in quantity with respect to a change in price, a concept economists call\nelasticity.\nAnyone who has studied economics knows the law of demand: a higher price will lead to a lower quantity\ndemanded. What you may not know is how much lower the quantity demanded will be. Similarly, the law of\nsupply states that a higher price will lead to a higher quantity supplied. The question is: How much higher?\nThis chapter will explain how to answer these questions and why they are critically important in the real world.\nTo find answers to these questions, we need to understand the concept of elasticity.Elasticityis an economics\nconcept that measures responsiveness of one variable to changes in another variable. Suppose you drop two\nitems from a second-floor balcony. The first item is a tennis ball. The second item is a brick. Which will bounce\nhigher? Obviously, the tennis ball. We would say that the tennis ball has greater elasticity.\nConsider an economic example. Cigarette taxes are an example of a \u201csin tax,\u201d a tax on something that is bad for\nyou, like alcohol. Governments tax cigarettes at the state and national levels. As of 2021, state taxes ranged\nfrom a low of 17 cents per pack in Missouri to $4.35 per pack in Connecticut and New York. The average state\ncigarette tax is $1.76 per pack. The 2021 federal tax rate on cigarettes was $1.01 per pack. In 2015, the Obama\nAdministration proposed raising the federal tax nearly a dollar to $1.95 per pack. The key question is: How\nmuch would cigarette purchases decline?\nTaxes on cigarettes serve two purposes: to raise tax revenue for government and to discourage cigarette\nconsumption. However, if a higher cigarette tax discourages consumption considerably, meaning a greatly\nreduced quantity of cigarette sales, then the cigarette tax on each pack will not raise much revenue for the\ngovernment. Alternatively, a higher cigarette tax that does not discourage consumption by much will actually\nraise more tax revenue for the government. Thus, when a government agency tries to calculate the effects of\naltering its cigarette tax, it must analyze how much the tax affects the quantity of cigarettes consumed. This\nissue reaches beyond governments and taxes. Every firm faces a similar issue. When a firm considers raising\nthe sales price, it must consider how much a price increase will reduce the quantity demanded of what it sells.\nConversely, when a firm puts its products on sale, it must expect (or hope) that the lower price will lead to a\nsignificantly higher quantity demanded.\n5.1Price Elasticity of Demand and Price Elasticity of Supply\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Calculate the price elasticity of demand\n\u2022 Calculate the price elasticity of supply\nBoth the demand and supply curve show the relationship between price and the number of units demanded or\nsupplied.Price elasticityis the ratio between the percentage change in the quantity demanded (Qd) or\nsupplied (Qs) and the corresponding percent change in price. Theprice elasticity of demandis the percentage\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.1 \u2022 Price Elasticity of Demand and Price Elasticity of Supply 113\nchange in the quantitydemandedof a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price. Theprice\nelasticity of supplyis the percentage change in quantitysupplieddivided by the percentage change in price.\nWe can usefully divide elasticities into three broad categories: elastic, inelastic, and unitary. Because price and\nquantity demanded move in opposite directions, price elasticity of demand is always a negative number.\nTherefore, price elasticity of demand is usually reported as its absolute value, without a negative sign. The\nsummary inTable 5.1is assuming absolute values for price elasticity of demand. Anelastic demandorelastic\nsupplyis one in which the elasticity is greater than one, indicating a high responsiveness to changes in price.\nElasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond toinelastic\ndemandorinelastic supply.Unitary elasticitiesindicate proportional responsiveness of either demand or\nsupply, asTable 5.1summarizes.\nIf . . . Then . . . And It Is Called . . .\nElastic\nUnitary\nInelastic\nTABLE5.1Elastic, Inelastic, and Unitary: Three Cases of Elasticity\nLINK IT UP\nBefore we delve into the details of elasticity, enjoy thisarticle(http://openstax.org/l/Super_Bowl)on elasticity\nand ticket prices at the Super Bowl.\nTo calculate elasticity along a demand or supply curve economists use the average percent change in both\nquantity and price. This is called the Midpoint Method for Elasticity, and is represented in the following\nequations:\nThe advantage of theMidpoint Methodis that one obtains the same elasticity between two price points\nwhether there is a price increase or decrease. This is because the formula uses the same base (average\nquantity and average price) for both cases.\nCalculating Price Elasticity of Demand\nLet\u2019s calculate the elasticity between points A and B and between points G and H asFigure 5.2shows. 114 5 \u2022 Elasticity\nFIGURE5.2Calculating the Price Elasticity of DemandWe calculate the price elasticity of demand as the\npercentage change in quantity divided by the percentage change in price.\nFirst, apply the formula to calculate the elasticity as price decreases from $70 at point B to $60 at point A:\nTherefore, the elasticity of demand between these two points is which is 0.45, an amount smaller than\none, showing that the demand is inelastic in this interval. Price elasticities of demand arealwaysnegative\nsince price and quantity demanded always move in opposite directions (on the demand curve). By convention,\nwe always talk about elasticities as positive numbers. Mathematically, we take the absolute value of the result.\nWe will ignore this detail from now on, while remembering to interpret elasticities as positive numbers.\nThis means that, along the demand curve between point B and A, if the price changes by 1%, the quantity\ndemanded will change by 0.45%. A change in the price will result in a smaller percentage change in the\nquantity demanded. For example, a 10%increasein the price will result in only a 4.5%decreasein quantity\ndemanded. A 10%decreasein the price will result in only a 4.5%increasein the quantity demanded. Price\nelasticities of demand are negative numbers indicating that the demand curve is downward sloping, but we\nread them as absolute values. The following Work It Out feature will walk you through calculating the price\nelasticity of demand.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.1 \u2022 Price Elasticity of Demand and Price Elasticity of Supply 115\nWORK IT OUT\nFinding the Price Elasticity of Demand\nCalculate the price elasticity of demand using the data inFigure 5.2for an increase in price from G to H. Has the\nelasticity increased or decreased?\nStep 1. We know that:\nStep 2. From theMidpoint Formulawe know that:\nStep 3. So we can use the values provided in the figure in each equation:\nStep 4. Then, we can use those values to determine the price elasticity of demand:\nTherefore, the elasticity of demand from G to is H 1.47. The magnitude of the elasticity has increased (in\nabsolute value) as we moved up along thedemand curvefrom points A to B. Recall that the elasticity between\nthese two points was 0.45. Demand was inelastic between points A and B and elastic between points G and H.\nThis shows us that price elasticity of demand changes at different points along astraight-line demand curve.\nCalculating the Price Elasticity of Supply\nAssume that an apartment rents for $650 per month and at that price the landlord rents 10,000 units asFigure\n5.3shows. When the price increases to $700 per month, the landlord supplies 13,000 units into the market. By\nwhat percentage does apartment supply increase? What is the price sensitivity? 116 5 \u2022 Elasticity\nFIGURE5.3Price Elasticity of SupplyWe calculate the price elasticity of supply as the percentage change in\nquantity divided by the percentage change in price.\nUsing theMidpoint Method,\nAgain, as with the elasticity of demand, the elasticity of supply is not followed by any units. Elasticity is a ratio\nof one percentage change to another percentage change\u2014nothing more\u2014and we read it as an absolute value. In\nthis case, a 1% rise in price causes an increase in quantity supplied of 3.5%. The greater than one elasticity of\nsupply means that the percentage change in quantity supplied will be greater than a one percent price change.\nIf you're starting to wonder if the concept of slope fits into this calculation, read the following Clear It Up box.\nCLEAR IT UP\nIs the elasticity the slope?\nIt is a common mistake to confuse the slope of either the supply or demand curve with its elasticity. The slope is the\nrate of change in units along the curve, or the rise/run (change in y over the change in x). For example, inFigure 5.2,\nat each point shown on the demand curve, price drops by $10 and the number of units demanded increases by 200\ncompared to the point to its left. The slope is \u201310/200 along the entire demand curve and does not change. The\nprice elasticity, however, changes along the curve. Elasticity between points A and B was 0.45 and increased to 1.47\nbetween points G and H. Elasticity is thepercentagechange, which is a different calculation from the slope and has\na different meaning.\nWhen we are at the upper end of a demand curve, where price is high and the quantity demanded is low, a small\nchange in the quantity demanded, even in, say, one unit, is pretty big in percentage terms. A change in price of, say,\na dollar, is going to be much less important in percentage terms than it would have been at the bottom of the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.2 \u2022 Polar Cases of Elasticity and Constant Elasticity 117\ndemand curve. Likewise, at the bottom of the demand curve, that one unit change when the quantity demanded is\nhigh will be small as a percentage.\nThus, at one end of the demand curve, where we have a large percentage change in quantity demanded over a small\npercentage change in price, the elasticity value would be high, or demand would be relatively elastic. Even with the\nsame change in the price and the same change in the quantity demanded, at the other end of the demand curve the\nquantity is much higher, and the price is much lower, so the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller and\nthe percentage change in price is much higher. That means at the bottom of the curve we'd have a small numerator\nover a large denominator, so the elasticity measure would be much lower, or inelastic.\nAs we move along the demand curve, the values for quantity and price go up or down, depending on which way we\nare moving, so the percentages for, say, a $1 difference in price or a one unit difference in quantity, will change as\nwell, which means the ratios of those percentages and hence the elasticity will change.\n5.2Polar Cases of Elasticity and Constant Elasticity\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Differentiate between infinite and zero elasticity\n\u2022 Analyze graphs in order to classify elasticity as constant unitary, infinite, or zero\nThere are two extreme cases of elasticity: when elasticity equals zero and when it is infinite. A third case of\ninterest is that of constant unitary elasticity. We will describe each case.Infinite elasticityorperfect elasticity\nrefers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded (Qd) or supplied (Qs) changes by an infinite\namount in response to any change in price at all. In both cases, the supply and thedemand curveare\nhorizontal asFigure 5.4shows. While perfectly elastic supply curves are for the most part unrealistic, goods\nwith readily available inputs and whose production can easily expand will feature highly elastic supply curves.\nExamples include pizza, bread, books, and pencils. Similarly, perfectly elastic demand is an extreme example.\nHowever, luxury goods, items that take a large share of individuals\u2019 income, and goods with many substitutes\nare likely to have highly elastic demand curves. Examples of such goods are Caribbean cruises and sports\nvehicles.\nFIGURE5.4Infinite ElasticityThe horizontal lines show that an infinite quantity will be demanded or supplied at a\nspecific price. This illustrates the cases of a perfectly (or infinitely) elastic demand curve and supply curve. The\nquantity supplied or demanded is extremely responsive to price changes, moving from zero for prices close to P to\ninfinite when prices reach P.\nZero elasticityorperfect inelasticity, asFigure 5.5depicts, refers to the extreme case in which a percentage\nchange in price, no matter how large, results in zero change in quantity. While a perfectly inelastic supply is an\nextreme example, goods with limited supply of inputs are likely to feature highly inelastic supply curves.\nExamples include diamond rings or housing in prime locations such as apartments facing Central Park in New 118 5 \u2022 Elasticity\nYork City. Similarly, while perfectly inelastic demand is an extreme case, necessities with no close substitutes\nare likely to have highly inelastic demand curves. This is the case of life-saving drugs and gasoline.\nFIGURE5.5Zero ElasticityThe vertical supply curve and vertical demand curve show that there will be zero\npercentage change in quantity (a) demanded or (b) supplied, regardless of the price.\nConstant unitary elasticity, in either a supply or demand curve, occurs when a price change of one percent\nresults in a quantity change of one percent.Figure 5.6shows a demand curve with constant unit elasticity.\nUsing the midpoint method, you can calculate that between points A and B on the demand curve, the price\nchanges by 66.7% and quantity demanded also changes by 66.7%. Hence, the elasticity equals 1. Between\npoints B and C, price again changes by 66.7% as does quantity, while between points C and D the\ncorresponding percentage changes are again 66.7% for both price and quantity. In each case, then, the\npercentage change in price equals the percentage change in quantity, and consequently elasticity equals 1.\nNotice that in absolute value, the declines in price, as you step down the demand curve, are not identical.\nInstead, the price falls by $8.00 from A to B, by a smaller amount of $4.00 from B to C, and by a still smaller\namount of $2.00 from C to D. As a result, a demand curve with constant unitary elasticity moves from a steeper\nslope on the left and a flatter slope on the right\u2014and a curved shape overall.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.2 \u2022 Polar Cases of Elasticity and Constant Elasticity 119\nFIGURE5.6A Constant Unitary Elasticity Demand CurveA demand curve with constant unitary elasticity will be a\ncurved line. Notice how price and quantity demanded change by an identical percentage amount between each pair\nof points on the demand curve.\nUnlike the demand curve with unitary elasticity, the supply curve with unitary elasticity is represented by a\nstraight line, and that line goes through the origin. In each pair of points on the supply curve there is an equal\ndifference in quantity of 30. However, in percentage value, using the midpoint method, the steps are\ndecreasing as one moves from left to right, from 28.6% to 22.2% to 18.2%, because the quantity points in each\npercentage calculation are getting increasingly larger, which expands the denominator in the elasticity\ncalculation of the percentage change in quantity.\nConsider the price changes moving up the supply curve inFigure 5.7. From points D to E to F and to G on the\nsupply curve, each step of $1.50 is the same in absolute value. However, if we measure the price changes in\npercentage change terms, using the midpoint method, they are also decreasing, from 28.6% to 22.2% to\n18.2%, because the original price points in each percentage calculation are getting increasingly larger in value,\nincreasing the denominator in the calculation of the percentage change in price. Along the constant unitary\nelasticity supply curve, the percentage quantity increases on the horizontal axis exactly match the percentage\nprice increases on the vertical axis\u2014so this supply curve has a constant unitary elasticity at all points. 120 5 \u2022 Elasticity\nFIGURE5.7A Constant Unitary Elasticity Supply CurveA constant unitary elasticity supply curve is a straight line\nreaching up from the origin. Between each pair of points, the percentage increase in quantity supplied is the same\nas the percentage increase in price.\n5.3Elasticity and Pricing\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Analyze how price elasticities impact revenue\n\u2022 Evaluate how elasticity can cause shifts in demand and supply\n\u2022 Predict how the long-run and short-run impacts of elasticity affect equilibrium\n\u2022 Explain how the elasticity of demand and supply determine the incidence of a tax on buyers and sellers\nStudying elasticities is useful for a number of reasons, pricing being most important. Let\u2019s explore how\nelasticity relates to revenue and pricing, both in the long and short run. First, let\u2019s look at the elasticities of\nsome common goods and services.\nTable 5.2shows a selection of demand elasticities for different goods and services drawn from a variety of\ndifferent studies by economists, listed in order of increasing elasticity.\nGoods and Services Elasticity of Price\nHousing 0.12\nTransatlantic air travel (economy class) 0.12\nRail transit (rush hour) 0.15\nElectricity 0.20\nTaxi cabs 0.22\nGasoline 0.35\nTransatlantic air travel (first class) 0.40\nWine 0.55\nTABLE5.2Some Selected Elasticities of Demand\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.3 \u2022 Elasticity and Pricing 121\nGoods and Services Elasticity of Price\nBeef 0.59\nTransatlantic air travel (business class) 0.62\nKitchen and household appliances 0.63\nCable TV (basic rural) 0.69\nChicken 0.64\nSoft drinks 0.70\nBeer 0.80\nNew vehicle 0.87\nRail transit (off-peak) 1.00\nComputer 1.44\nCable TV (basic urban) 1.51\nCable TV (premium) 1.77\nRestaurant meals 2.27\nTABLE5.2Some Selected Elasticities of Demand\nNote that demand for necessities such as housing and electricity is inelastic, while items that are not\nnecessities such as restaurant meals are more price-sensitive. If the price of a restaurant meal increases by\n10%, the quantity demanded will decrease by 22.7%. A 10% increase in the price of housing will cause only a\nslight decrease of 1.2% in the quantity of housing demanded.\nLINK IT UP\nRead thisarticle(http://openstax.org/l/Movietickets)for an example of price elasticity that may have affected\nyou.\nDoes Raising Price Bring in More Revenue?\nImagine that a band on tour is playing in an indoor arena with 15,000 seats. To keep this example simple,\nassume that the band keeps all the money from ticket sales. Assume further that the band pays the costs for its\nappearance, but that these costs, like travel, and setting up the stage, are the same regardless of how many\npeople are in the audience. Finally, assume that all the tickets have the same price. (The same insights apply if\nticket prices are more expensive for some seats than for others, but the calculations become more\ncomplicated.) The band knows that it faces a downward-sloping demand curve; that is, if the band raises the\nticket price, it will sell fewer seats. How should the band set the ticket price to generate the most total revenue,\nwhich in this example, because costs are fixed, will also mean the highest profits for the band? Should the band\nsell more tickets at a lower price or fewer tickets at a higher price?\nThe key concept in thinking about collecting the most revenue is the price elasticity of demand. Total revenue\nis price times the quantity of tickets sold. Imagine that the band starts off thinking about a certain price, which\nwill result in the sale of a certain quantity of tickets. The three possibilities are inTable 5.3. If demand is elastic 122 5 \u2022 Elasticity\nat that price level, then the band should cut the price, because the percentage drop in price will result in an\neven larger percentage increase in the quantity sold\u2014thus raising total revenue. However, if demand is\ninelastic at that original quantity level, then the band should raise the ticket price, because a certain\npercentage increase in price will result in a smaller percentage decrease in the quantity sold\u2014and total\nrevenue will rise. If demand has a unitary elasticity at that quantity, then an equal percentage change in\nquantity will offset a moderate percentage change in the price\u2014so the band will earn the same revenue\nwhether it (moderately) increases or decreases the ticket price.\nIf\nDemand Then . . . Therefore . . .\nIs . . .\nA given % rise in P will be more than offset by a larger % fall in Q\nElastic\nso that total revenue (P \u00d7 Q) falls.\nA given % rise in P will be exactly offset by an equal % fall in Q\nUnitary\nso that total revenue (P \u00d7 Q) is unchanged.\nA given % rise in P will cause a smaller % fall in Q so that total\nInelastic\nrevenue (P \u00d7 Q) rises.\nTABLE5.3Will the Band Earn More Revenue by Changing Ticket Prices?\nWhat if the band keeps cutting price, because demand is elastic, until it reaches a level where it sells all 15,000\nseats in the available arena? If demand remains elastic at that quantity, the band might try to move to a bigger\narena, so that it could slash ticket prices further and see a larger percentage increase in the quantity of tickets\nsold. However, if the 15,000-seat arena is all that is available or if a larger arena would add substantially to\ncosts, then this option may not work.\nConversely, a few bands are so famous, or have such fanatical followings, that demand for tickets may be\ninelastic right up to the point where the arena is full. These bands can, if they wish, keep raising the ticket\nprice. Ironically, some of the most popular bands could make more revenue by setting prices so high that the\narena is not full\u2014but those who buy the tickets would have to pay very high prices. However, bands sometimes\nchoose to sell tickets for less than the absolute maximum they might be able to charge, often in the hope that\nfans will feel happier and spend more on recordings, T-shirts, and other paraphernalia.\nCan Businesses Pass Costs on to Consumers?\nMost businesses face a day-to-day struggle to figure out ways to produce at a lower cost, as one pathway to their\ngoal of earning higher profits. However, in some cases, the price of a key input over which the firm has no\ncontrol may rise. For example, many chemical companies use petroleum as akey input, but they have no\ncontrol over the world market price for crude oil. Coffee shops use coffee as a key input, but they have no\ncontrol over the world market price of coffee. If the cost of a key input rises, can the firm pass those higher\ncosts along to consumers in the form of higher prices? Conversely, if new and less expensive ways of producing\nare invented, can the firm keep the benefits in the form of higher profits, or will the market pressure them to\npass the gains along to consumers in the form of lower prices? The price elasticity of demand plays a key role\nin answering these questions.\nImagine that as a consumer of legal pharmaceutical products, you read a newspaper story that a technological\nbreakthrough in the production of aspirin has occurred, so that every aspirin factory can now produce aspirin\nmore cheaply. What does this discovery mean to you?Figure 5.8illustrates two possibilities. InFigure 5.8(a),\nthe demand curve is highly inelastic. In this case, a technological breakthrough that shifts supply to the right,\nfrom S to S , so that the equilibrium shifts from E to E , creates a substantially lower price for the product\n0 1 0 1\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.3 \u2022 Elasticity and Pricing 123\nwith relatively little impact on the quantity sold. InFigure 5.8(b), the demand curve is highly elastic. In this\ncase, the technological breakthrough leads to a much greater quantity sold in the market at very close to the\noriginal price. Consumers benefit more, in general, when the demand curve is more inelastic because the shift\nin the supply results in a much lower price for consumers.\nFIGURE5.8Passing along Cost Savings to ConsumersCost-saving gains cause supply to shift out to the right from\nS to S ; that is, at any given price, firms will be willing to supply a greater quantity. If demand is inelastic, as in (a),\n0 1\nthe result of this cost-saving technological improvement will be substantially lower prices. If demand is elastic, as in\n(b), the result will be only slightly lower prices. Consumers benefit in either case, from a greater quantity at a lower\nprice, but the benefit is greater when demand is inelastic, as in (a).\nAspirin producers may find themselves in a nasty bind here. The situation inFigure 5.8, with extremely\ninelastic demand, means that a new invention may cause the price to drop dramatically while quantity\nchanges little. As a result, the new production technology can lead to a drop in the revenue that firms earn\nfrom aspirin sales. However, if strong competition exists between aspirin producers, each producer may have\nlittle choice but to search for and implement any breakthrough that allows it to reduce production costs. After\nall, if one firm decides not to implement such a cost-saving technology, other firms that do can drive them out\nof business.\nSince demand for food is generally inelastic, farmers may often face the situation inFigure 5.8(a). That is, a\nsurge in production leads to a severe drop in price that can actually decrease the total revenue that farmers\nreceive. Conversely, poor weather or other conditions that cause a terrible year for farm production can\nsharply raise prices so that the total revenue that the farmer receives increases. The Clear It Up box discusses\nhow these issues relate to coffee.\nCLEAR IT UP\nHow do coffee prices fluctuate?\nCoffee is an international crop. The top five coffee-exporting nations are Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, Indonesia, and\nEthiopia. In these nations and others, 20 million families depend on selling coffee beans as their main source of\nincome. These families are exposed to enormous risk, because the world price of coffee bounces up and down. For\nexample, in 1993, the world price of coffee was about 50 cents per pound. In 1995 it was four times as high, at $2\nper pound. By 1997 it had fallen by half to $1.00 per pound. In 1998 it leaped back up to $2 per pound. By 2001 it\nhad fallen back to 46 cents a pound. By early 2011 it rose to about $2.31 per pound. By the end of 2012, the price\nhad fallen back to about $1.31 per pound. Since then, the price of coffee has continued to fluctuate. 124 5 \u2022 Elasticity\nThe reason for these price fluctuations lies in a combination of inelastic demand and shifts in supply. The elasticity\nof coffee demand is only about 0.3; that is, a 10% rise in the price of coffee leads to a decline of about 3% in the\nquantity of coffee consumed. When a major frost hit the Brazilian coffee crop in 1994, coffee supply shifted to the\nleft with an inelastic demand curve, leading to much higher prices. Conversely, when Vietnam entered the world\ncoffee market as a major producer in the late 1990s, the supply curve shifted out to the right. With a highly inelastic\ndemand curve, coffee prices fell dramatically.Figure 5.8(a) illustrates this situation.\nElasticity also reveals whether firms can pass higher costs that they incur on to consumers. Addictive\nsubstances, for which demand is inelastic, are products for which producers can pass higher costs on to\nconsumers. For example, the demand for cigarettes is relatively inelastic among regular smokers who are\nsomewhat addicted. Economic research suggests that increasing cigarette prices by 10% leads to about a 3%\nreduction in the quantity of cigarettes that adults smoke, so the elasticity of demand for cigarettes is 0.3. If\nsociety increases taxes on companies that produce cigarettes, the result will be, as inFigure 5.9(a), that the\nsupply curve shifts from S to S . However, as the equilibrium moves from E to E , governments mainly pass\n0 1 0 1\nalong these taxes to consumers in the form of higher prices. These higher taxes on cigarettes will raise tax\nrevenue for the government, but they will not much affect the quantity of smoking.\nIf the goal is to reduce the quantity of cigarettes demanded, we must achieve it by shifting this inelastic\ndemand back to the left, perhaps with public programs to discourage cigarette use or to help people to quit. For\nexample, anti-smoking advertising campaigns have shown some ability to reduce smoking. However, if\ncigarette demand were more elastic, as inFigure 5.9(b), then an increase in taxes that shifts supply from S to\n0\nS and equilibrium from E to E would reduce the quantity of cigarettes smoked substantially. Youth smoking\n1 0 1\nseems to be more elastic than adult smoking\u2014that is, the quantity of youth smoking will fall by a greater\npercentage than the quantity of adult smoking in response to a given percentage increase in price.\nFIGURE5.9Passing along Higher Costs to ConsumersHigher costs, like a higher tax on cigarette companies for\nthe example we gave in the text, lead supply to shift to the left. This shift is identical in (a) and (b). However, in (a),\nwhere demand is inelastic, companies largely can pass the cost increase along to consumers in the form of higher\nprices, without much of a decline in equilibrium quantity. In (b), demand is elastic, so the shift in supply results\nprimarily in a lower equilibrium quantity. Consumers do not benefit in either case, but in (a), they pay a higher price\nfor the same quantity, while in (b), they must buy a lower quantity (and presumably needing to shift their\nconsumption elsewhere).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.3 \u2022 Elasticity and Pricing 125\nElasticity and Tax Incidence\nThe example of cigarette taxes demonstrated that because demand is inelastic, taxes are not effective at\nreducing the equilibrium quantity of smoking, and they are mainly passed along to consumers in the form of\nhigher prices. The analysis, or manner, of how a tax burden is divided between consumers and producers is\ncalledtax incidence. Typically, the tax incidence, or burden, falls both on the consumers and producers of the\ntaxed good. However, if one wants to predict which group will bear most of the burden, all one needs to do is\nexamine the elasticity of demand and supply. In the tobacco example, the tax burden falls on the most inelastic\nside of the market.\nIf demand is more inelastic than supply, consumers bear most of the tax burden, and if supply is more\ninelastic than demand, sellers bear most of the tax burden.\nThe intuition for this is simple. When the demand is inelastic, consumers are not very responsive to price\nchanges, and the quantity demanded reduces only modestly when the tax is introduced. In the case of\nsmoking, the demand is inelastic because consumers are addicted to the product. The government can then\npass the tax burden along to consumers in the form of higher prices, without much of a decline in the\nequilibrium quantity.\nSimilarly, when a government introduces a tax in a market with an inelastic supply, such as, for example,\nbeachfront hotels, and sellers have no alternative than to accept lower prices for their business, taxes do not\ngreatly affect the equilibrium quantity. The tax burden now passes on to the sellers. If the supply was elastic\nand sellers had the possibility of reorganizing their businesses to avoid supplying the taxed good, the tax\nburden on the sellers would be much smaller. The tax would result in a much lower quantity sold instead of\nlower prices received.Figure 5.10illustrates this relationship between the tax incidence and elasticity of\ndemand and supply.\nFIGURE5.10Elasticity and Tax IncidenceAn excise tax introduces a wedge between the price paid by consumers\n(Pc) and the price received by producers (Pp). The vertical distance between Pc and Pp is the amount of the tax per\nunit. Pe is the equilibrium price prior to introduction of the tax. (a) When the demand is more elastic than supply, the\ntax incidence on consumers Pc \u2013 Pe is lower than the tax incidence on producers Pe \u2013 Pp. (b) When the supply is\nmore elastic than demand, the tax incidence on consumers Pc \u2013 Pe is larger than the tax incidence on producers Pe\n\u2013 Pp. The more elastic the demand and supply curves, the lower the tax revenue.\nInFigure 5.10(a), the supply is inelastic and the demand is elastic, such as in the example of beachfront hotels.\nWhile consumers may have other vacation choices, sellers can\u2019t easily move their businesses. By introducing a\ntax, the government essentially creates a wedge between the price paid by consumers Pc and the price\nreceived by producers Pp. In other words, of the total price paid by consumers, part is retained by the sellers 126 5 \u2022 Elasticity\nand part is paid to the government in the form of a tax. The distance between Pc and Pp is the tax rate. The new\nmarket price is Pc, but sellers receive only Pp per unit sold, as they pay Pc-Pp to the government. Since we can\nview a tax as raising the costs of production, this could also be represented by a leftward shift of the supply\ncurve, where the new supply curve would intercept the demand at the new quantity Qt. For simplicity,Figure\n5.10omits the shift in the supply curve.\nThe tax revenue is given by the shaded area, which we obtain by multiplying the tax per unit by the total\nquantity sold Qt. The tax incidence on the consumers is given by the difference between the price paid Pc and\nthe initial equilibrium price Pe. The tax incidence on the sellers is given by the difference between the initial\nequilibrium price Pe and the price they receive after the tax is introduced Pp. InFigure 5.10(a), the tax burden\nfalls disproportionately on the sellers, and a larger proportion of the tax revenue (the shaded area) is due to the\nresulting lower price received by the sellers than by the resulting higher prices paid by the buyers.Figure 5.10\n(b) describes the example of the tobacco excise tax where the supply is more elastic than demand. The tax\nincidence now falls disproportionately on consumers, as shown by the large difference between the price they\npay, Pc, and the initial equilibrium price, Pe. Sellers receive a lower price than before the tax, but this\ndifference is much smaller than the change in consumers\u2019 price. From this analysis one can also predict\nwhether a tax is likely to create a large revenue or not. The more elastic the demand curve, the more likely that\nconsumers will reduce quantity instead of paying higher prices. The more elastic the supply curve, the more\nlikely that sellers will reduce the quantity sold, instead of taking lower prices. In a market where both the\ndemand and supply are very elastic, the imposition of an excise tax generates low revenue.\nSome believe that excise taxes hurt mainly the specific industries they target. For example, the medical device\nexcise tax, which was implemented in 2013, has been controversial for it can delay industry profitability and\ntherefore hamper start-ups and medical innovation. The tax was repealed in late 2019. However, whether the\ntax burden falls mostly on the medical device industry or on the patients depends simply on the elasticity of\ndemand and supply.\nLong-Run vs. Short-Run Impact\nElasticities are often lower in the short run than in the long run. On the demand side of the market, it can\nsometimes be difficult to change Qd in the short run, but easier in the long run. Consumption of energy is a\nclear example. In the short run, it is not easy for a person to make substantial changes in energy consumption.\nMaybe you can carpool to work sometimes or adjust your home thermostat by a few degrees if the cost of\nenergy rises, but that is about all. However, in the long run you can purchase a car that gets more miles to the\ngallon, choose a job that is closer to where you live, buy more energy-efficient home appliances, or install more\ninsulation in your home. As a result, the elasticity of demand for energy is somewhat inelastic in the short run,\nbut much more elastic in the long run.\nFigure 5.11is an example, based roughly on historical experience, for the responsiveness of Qd to price\nchanges. In 1973, the price of crude oil was $12 per barrel and total consumption in the U.S. economy was 17\nmillion barrels per day. That year, the nations who were members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting\nCountries (OPEC) cut off oil exports to the United States for six months because the Arab members of OPEC\ndisagreed with the U.S. support for Israel. OPEC did not bring exports back to their earlier levels until 1975\u2014a\npolicy that we can interpret as a shift of the supply curve to the left in the U.S. petroleum market.Figure 5.11\n(a) andFigure 5.11(b) show the same original equilibrium point and the same identical shift of a supply curve\nto the left from S to S .\n0 1\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.3 \u2022 Elasticity and Pricing 127\nFIGURE5.11How a Shift in Supply Can Affect Price or QuantityThe intersection (E ) between demand curve D and\n0\nsupply curve S is the same in both (a) and (b). The shift of supply to the left from S to S is identical in both (a) and\n0 0 1\n(b). The new equilibrium (E ) has a higher price and a lower quantity than the original equilibrium (E ) in both (a) and\n1 0\n(b). However, the shape of the demand curve D is different in (a) and (b), being more elastic in (b) than in (a). As a\nresult, the shift in supply can result either in a new equilibrium with a much higher price and an only slightly smaller\nquantity, as in (a), with more inelastic demand, or in a new equilibrium with only a small increase in price and a\nrelatively larger reduction in quantity, as in (b), with more elastic demand.\nFigure 5.11(a) shows inelastic demand for oil in the short run similar to that which existed for the United\nStates in 1973. InFigure 5.11(a), the new equilibrium (E ) occurs at a price of $25 per barrel, roughly double\n1\nthe price before the OPEC shock, and an equilibrium quantity of 16 million barrels per day.Figure 5.11(b)\nshows what the outcome would have been if the U.S. demand for oil had been more elastic, a result more likely\nover the long term. This alternative equilibrium (E ) would have resulted in a smaller price increase to $14 per\n1\nbarrel and larger reduction in equilibrium quantity to 13 million barrels per day. In 1983, for example, U.S.\npetroleum consumption was 15.3 million barrels a day, which was lower than in 1973 or 1975. U.S. petroleum\nconsumption was down even though the U.S. economy was about one-fourth larger in 1983 than it had been in\n1973. The primary reason for the lower quantity was that higher energy prices spurred conservation efforts,\nand after a decade of home insulation, more fuel-efficient cars, more efficient appliances and machinery, and\nother fuel-conserving choices, the demand curve for energy had become more elastic.\nOn the supply side of markets, producers of goods and services typically find it easier to expand production in\nthe long term of several years rather than in the short run of a few months. After all, in the short run it can be\ncostly or difficult to build a new factory, hire many new workers, or open new stores. However, over a few years,\nall of these are possible.\nIn most markets for goods and services, prices bounce up and down more than quantities in the short run, but\nquantities often move more than prices in the long run. The underlying reason for this pattern is that supply\nand demand are often inelastic in the short run, so that shifts in either demand or supply can cause a relatively\ngreater change in prices. However, since supply and demand are more elastic in the long run, the long-run\nmovements in prices are more muted, while quantity adjusts more easily in the long run. 128 5 \u2022 Elasticity\n5.4Elasticity in Areas Other Than Price\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Calculate the income elasticity of demand and the cross-price elasticity of demand\n\u2022 Calculate the elasticity in labor and financial capital markets through an understanding of the elasticity of\nlabor supply and the elasticity of savings\n\u2022 Apply concepts of price elasticity to real-world situations\nThe basic idea of elasticity\u2014how a percentage change in one variable causes a percentage change in another\nvariable\u2014does not just apply to the responsiveness of quantity supplied and quantity demanded to changes in\nthe price of a product. Recall that quantity demanded (Qd) depends on income, tastes and preferences, the\nprices of related goods, and so on, as well as price. Similarly, quantity supplied (Qs) depends on factors such as\nthe cost of production, as well as price. We can measure elasticity for any determinant of quantity supplied and\nquantity demanded, not just the price.\nIncome Elasticity of Demand\nTheincome elasticity of demandis the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage\nchange in income.\nFor most products, most of the time, the income elasticity of demand is positive: that is, a rise in income will\ncause an increase in the quantity demanded. This pattern is common enough that we refer to these goods as\nnormal goods. However, for a few goods, an increase in income means that one might purchase less of the\ngood. For example, those with a higher income might buy fewer hamburgers, because they are buying more\nsteak instead, or those with a higher income might buy less cheap wine and more imported beer. When the\nincome elasticity of demand is negative, we call the good aninferior good.\nWe introduced the concepts of normal and inferior goods inDemand and Supply. A higher level of income\ncauses a demand curve to shift to the right for a normal good, which means that the income elasticity of\ndemand is positive. How far the demand shifts depends on the income elasticity of demand. A higher income\nelasticity means a larger shift. However, for an inferior good, that is, when the income elasticity of demand is\nnegative, a higher level of income would cause the demand curve for that good to shift to the left. Again, how\nmuch it shifts depends on how large the (negative) income elasticity is.\nCross-Price Elasticity of Demand\nA change in the price of one good can shift the quantity demanded for another good. If the two goods are\ncomplements, like bread and peanut butter, then a drop in the price of one good will lead to an increase in the\nquantity demanded of the other good. However, if the two goods are substitutes, like plane tickets and train\ntickets, then a drop in the price of one good will cause people to substitute toward that good, and to reduce\nconsumption of the other good. Cheaper plane tickets lead to fewer train tickets, and vice versa.\nThecross-price elasticity of demandputs some meat on the bones of these ideas. The term \u201ccross-price\u201d\nrefers to the idea that the price of one good is affecting the quantity demanded of a different good. Specifically,\nthe cross-price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity of good A that is demanded as a\nresult of a percentage change in the price of good B.\nSubstitute goods have positive cross-price elasticities of demand: if good A is a substitute for good B, like coffee\nand tea, then a higher price for B will mean a greater quantity consumed of A. Complement goods have\nnegative cross-price elasticities: if good A is a complement for good B, like coffee and sugar, then a higher price\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.4 \u2022 Elasticity in Areas Other Than Price 129\nfor B will mean a lower quantity consumed of A.\nElasticity in Labor and Financial Capital Markets\nThe concept of elasticity applies to any market, not just markets for goods and services. In the labor market,\nfor example, thewage elasticity of labor supply\u2014that is, the percentage change in hours worked divided by\nthe percentage change in wages\u2014will reflect the shape of the labor supply curve. Specifically:\nThe wage elasticity of labor supply for teenage workers is generally fairly elastic: that is, a certain percentage\nchange in wages will lead to a larger percentage change in the quantity of hours worked. Conversely, the wage\nelasticity of labor supply for adult workers in their thirties and forties is fairly inelastic. When wages move up\nor down by a certain percentage amount, the quantity of hours that adults in their prime earning years are\nwilling to supply changes but by a lesser percentage amount.\nIn markets for financial capital, theelasticity of savings\u2014that is, the percentage change in the quantity of\nsavings divided by the percentage change in interest rates\u2014will describe the shape of the supply curve for\nfinancial capital. That is:\nSometimes laws are proposed that seek to increase the quantity of savings by offering tax breaks so that the\nreturn on savings is higher. Such a policy will have a comparatively large impact on increasing the quantity\nsaved if the supply curve for financial capital is elastic, because then a given percentage increase in the return\nto savings will cause a higher percentage increase in the quantity of savings. However, if the supply curve for\nfinancial capital is highly inelastic, then a percentage increase in the return to savings will cause only a small\nincrease in the quantity of savings. The evidence on the supply curve of financial capital is controversial but, at\nleast in the short run, the elasticity of savings with respect to the interest rate appears fairly inelastic.\nExpanding the Concept of Elasticity\nThe elasticity concept does not even need to relate to a typical supply or demand curve at all. For example,\nimagine that you are studying whether the Internal Revenue Service should spend more money on auditing tax\nreturns. We can frame the question in terms of the elasticity of tax collections with respect to spending on tax\nenforcement; that is, what is the percentage change in tax collections derived from a given percentage change\nin spending on tax enforcement?\nWith all of the elasticity concepts that we have just described, some of which are inTable 5.4, the possibility of\nconfusion arises. When you hear the phrases \u201celasticity of demand\u201d or \u201celasticity of supply,\u201d they refer to the\nelasticity with respect to price. Sometimes, either to be extremely clear or because economists are discussing a\nwide variety of elasticities, we will call the elasticity of demand or the demand elasticity the price elasticity of\ndemand or the \u201celasticity of demand with respect to price.\u201d Similarly, economists sometimes use the term\nelasticity of supply or the supply elasticity, to avoid any possibility of confusion, the price elasticity of supply or\n\u201cthe elasticity of supply with respect to price.\u201d However, in whatever context, the idea of elasticity always refers\nto percentage change in one variable, almost always a price or money variable, and how it causes a percentage\nchange in another variable, typically a quantity variable of some kind.\nTABLE5.4Formulas for Calculating Elasticity 130 5 \u2022 Elasticity\nTABLE5.4Formulas for Calculating Elasticity\nBRING IT HOME\nThat Will Be How Much?\nHow did the 60% price increase in 2011 end up for Netflix? It has been a very bumpy ride.\nBefore the price increase, there were about 24.6 million U.S. subscribers. After the price increase, 810,000\ninfuriated U.S. consumers canceled their Netflix subscriptions, dropping the total number of subscribers to 23.79\nmillion. Fast forward to June 2013, when there were 36 million streaming Netflix subscribers in the United States.\nThis was an increase of 11.4 million subscribers since the price increase\u2014an average per quarter growth of about\n1.6 million. This growth is less than the 2 million per quarter increases Netflix experienced in the fourth quarter of\n2010 and the first quarter of 2011.\nDuring the first year after the price increase, the firm\u2019s stock price (a measure of future expectations for the firm) fell\nfrom about $33.60 per share per share to just under $7.80. By the end of 2016, however, the stock price was at\n$123 per share. By the end of 2021, the stock price was just over $600 per share, and Netflix had more than 214\nmillion subscribers in fifty countries.\nWhat happened? Obviously, Netflix company officials understood the law of demand. Company officials reported,\nwhen announcing the price increase, this could result in the loss of about 600,000 existing subscribers. Using the\nelasticity of demand formula, it is easy to see company officials expected an inelastic response:\nIn addition, Netflix officials had anticipated the price increase would have little impact on attracting new customers.\nNetflix anticipated adding up to 1.29 million new subscribers in the third quarter of 2011. It is true this was slower\ngrowth than the firm had experienced\u2014about 2 million per quarter.\nWhy was the estimate of customers leaving so far off? In the more than two decades since Netflix had been\nfounded, there was an increase in the number of close, but not perfect, substitutes. Consumers now had choices\nranging from Vudu, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Redbox, to retail stores. Jaime Weinman reported inMaclean\u2019sthat\nRedbox kiosks are \u201ca five-minute drive for less from 68 percent of Americans, and it seems that many people still\nfind a five-minute drive more convenient than loading up a movie online.\u201d It seems that in 2012, many consumers\nstill preferred a physical DVD disk over streaming video.\nWhat missteps did the Netflix management make?

We compute it as the percentage change in quantity demanded (or supplied) divided by the percentage\nchange in price. We can describe elasticity as elastic (or very responsive), unit elastic, or inelastic (not very\nresponsive). Elastic demand or supply curves indicate that quantity demanded or supplied respond to price\nchanges in a greater than proportional manner. An inelastic demand or supply curve is one where a given\npercentage change in price will cause a smaller percentage change in quantity demanded or supplied. A\nunitary elasticity means that a given percentage change in price leads to an equal percentage change in\nquantity demanded or supplied.\n5.2Polar Cases of Elasticity and Constant Elasticity\nInfinite or perfect elasticity refers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded or supplied\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5 \u2022 Self-Check Questions 133\nchanges by an infinite amount in response to any change in price at all. Zero elasticity refers to the extreme\ncase in which a percentage change in price, no matter how large, results in zero change in quantity. Constant\nunitary elasticity in either a supply or demand curve refers to a situation where a price change of one percent\nresults in a quantity change of one percent.\n5.3Elasticity and Pricing\nIn the market for goods and services, quantity supplied and quantity demanded are often relatively slow to\nreact to changes in price in the short run, but react more substantially in the long run. As a result, demand and\nsupply often (but not always) tend to be relatively inelastic in the short run and relatively elastic in the long\nrun. A tax incidence depends on the relative price elasticity of supply and demand. When supply is more\nelastic than demand, buyers bear most of the tax burden, and when demand is more elastic than supply,\nproducers bear most of the cost of the tax. Tax revenue is larger the more inelastic the demand and supply are.\n5.4Elasticity in Areas Other Than Price\nElasticity is a general term, that reflects responsiveness. It refers to the change of one variable divided by the\npercentage change of a related variable that we can apply to many economic connections. For instance, the\nincome elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change\nin income. The cross-price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good\ndivided by the percentage change in the price of another good. Elasticity applies in labor markets and financial\ncapital markets just as it does in markets for goods and services. The wage elasticity of labor supply is the\npercentage change in the quantity of hours supplied divided by the percentage change in the wage. The\nelasticity of savings with respect to interest rates is the percentage change in the quantity of savings divided by\nthe percentage change in interest rates.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

In too many countries, workers found\nthemselves out of a job. In developed countries, unemployment compensation provided a safety net, but families\nstill saw a marked decrease in disposable income and had to make tough spending decisions. Of course, non-\nessential, discretionary spending was the first to go.\nEven so, there was one particular category that saw a universal increase in spending world-wide during that\ntime\u2014an 18% uptick in the United States, specifically. You might guess that consumers began eating more meals at\nhome, increasing grocery store spending; however, the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Consumer Expenditure Survey,\nwhich tracks U.S. food spending over time, showed \u201creal total food spending by U.S. households declined five\npercent between 2006 and 2009.\u201d So, it was not groceries. What product would people around the world demand 138 6 \u2022 Consumer Choices\nmore of during tough economic times, and more importantly, why? (Find out at chapter\u2019s end.)\nThat question leads us to this chapter\u2019s topic\u2014analyzing how consumers make choices and how changes affect\nthose choices. For instance, do changes in prices matter more or less than changes in a consumer\u2019s income? Can a\nsmall change in circumstances alter the consumers\u2019 perception of a product or even of their own resources? While\nmany choices may seem straightforward, there is often much more to consider.\nMicroeconomics seeks to understand the behavior of individual economic agents such as individuals and\nbusinesses. Economists believe that we can analyze individuals\u2019 decisions, such as what goods and services to\nbuy, as choices we make within certain budget constraints. Generally, consumers are trying to get the most for\ntheir limited budget. In economic terms they are trying to maximize total utility, or satisfaction, given their\nbudget constraint.\nEveryone has their own personal tastes and preferences. The French say:Chacun \u00e0 son go\u00fbt, or \u201cEach to his\nown taste.\u201d An old Latin saying states,De gustibus non est disputandumor \u201cThere\u2019s no disputing about taste.\u201d\nIf people base their decisions on their own tastes and personal preferences, however, then how can economists\nhope to analyze the choices consumers make?\nAn economic explanation for why people make different choices begins with accepting the proverbial wisdom\nthat tastes are a matter of personal preference. However, economists also believe that the choices people make\nare influenced by their incomes, by the prices of goods and services they consume, and by factors like where\nthey live. This chapter introduces the economic theory of how consumers make choices about what goods and\nservices to buy with their limited income.\nThe analysis in this chapter will build on the budget constraint that we introduced in theChoice in a World of\nScarcitychapter. This chapter will also illustrate how economic theory provides a tool to systematically look at\nthe full range of possible consumption choices to predict how consumption responds to changes in prices or\nincomes. After reading this chapter, consult the appendixIndifference Curvesto learn more about\nrepresenting utility and choice through indifference curves.\n6.1Consumption Choices\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Calculate total utility\n\u2022 Propose decisions that maximize utility\n\u2022 Explain marginal utility and the significance of diminishing marginal utility\nInformation on theconsumptionchoices of Americans is available from the Consumer Expenditure Survey\ncarried out by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.Table 6.1shows spending patterns for the average U.S.\nhousehold. The first row shows income and, after taxes and personal savings are subtracted, it shows that, in\n2015, the average U.S. household spent $48,109 on consumption. The table then breaks down consumption\ninto various categories. The average U.S. household spent roughly one-third of its consumption on shelter and\nother housing expenses, another one-third on food and vehicle expenses, and the rest on a variety of items, as\nshown. These patterns will vary for specific households by differing levels of family income, by geography, and\nby preferences.\nAverage Household Income before Taxes $62,481\nAverage Annual Expenditures $48.109\nFood at home $3,264\nTABLE6.1U.S. Consumption Choices in 2015(Source: http://www.bls.gov/cex/csxann13.pdf)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.1 \u2022 Consumption Choices 139\nFood away from home $2,505\nHousing $16,557\nApparel and services $1,700\nTransportation $7,677\nHealthcare $3,157\nEntertainment $2,504\nEducation $1,074\nPersonal insurance and pensions $5,357\nAll else: alcohol, tobacco, reading, personal care, cash contributions, miscellaneous $3,356\nTABLE6.1U.S. Consumption Choices in 2015(Source: http://www.bls.gov/cex/csxann13.pdf)\nTotal Utility and Diminishing Marginal Utility\nTo understand how a household will make its choices, economists look at what consumers can afford, as\nshown in abudget constraint (or budget line), and thetotal utilityor satisfaction derived from those choices.\nIn a budget constraint line, the quantity of one good is on the horizontal axis and the quantity of the other good\non the vertical axis. The budget constraint line shows the various combinations of two goods that are\naffordable given consumer income. Consider Jos\u00e9's situation, shown inFigure 6.2. Jos\u00e9 likes to collect T-shirts\nand watch movies.\nInFigure 6.2we show the quantity of T-shirts on the horizontal axis while we show the quantity of movies on\nthe vertical axis. If Jos\u00e9 had unlimited income or goods were free, then he could consume without limit.\nHowever, Jos\u00e9, like all of us, faces abudget constraint. Jos\u00e9 has a total of $56 to spend. The price of T-shirts is\n$14 and the price of movies is $7. Notice that the vertical intercept of the budget constraint line is at eight\nmovies and zero T-shirts ($56/$7=8). The horizontal intercept of the budget constraint is four, where Jos\u00e9\nspends of all of his money on T-shirts and no movies ($56/14=4). The slope of the budget constraint line is rise/\nrun or \u20138/4=\u20132. The specific choices along the budget constraint line show the combinations of affordable T-\nshirts and movies.\nFIGURE6.2A Choice between Consumption GoodsJos\u00e9 has income of $56. Movies cost $7 and T-shirts cost $14.\nThe points on the budget constraint line show the combinations of affordable movies and T-shirts. 140 6 \u2022 Consumer Choices\nJos\u00e9 wishes to choose the combination that will provide him with the greatestutility, which is the term\neconomists use to describe a person\u2019s level of satisfaction or happiness with their choices.\nLet\u2019s begin with an assumption, which we will discuss in more detail later, that Jos\u00e9 can measure his own\nutility with something calledutils. (It is important to note that you cannot make comparisons between the utils\nof individuals. If one person gets 20 utils from a cup of coffee and another gets 10 utils, this does not mean\nthan the first person gets more enjoyment from the coffee than the other or that they enjoy the coffee twice as\nmuch. The reason why is that utils are subjective to an individual. The way one person measures utils is not\nthe same as the way someone else does.)Table 6.2shows how Jos\u00e9\u2019s utility is connected with his T-shirt or\nmovie consumption. The first column of the table shows the quantity of T-shirts consumed. The second\ncolumn shows the total utility, or total amount of satisfaction, that Jos\u00e9 receives from consuming that number\nof T-shirts. The most common pattern of total utility, in this example, is that consuming additional goods leads\nto greater total utility, but at a decreasing rate. The third column showsmarginal utility, which is the\nadditional utility provided by one additional unit of consumption. This equation for marginal utility is:\nNotice that marginal utility diminishes as additional units are consumed, which means that each subsequent\nunit of a good consumed provides lessadditionalutility. For example, the first T-shirt Jos\u00e9 picks is his favorite\nand it gives him an addition of 22 utils. The fourth T-shirt is just something to wear when all his other clothes\nare in the wash and yields only 18 additional utils. This is an example of the law ofdiminishing marginal\nutility, which holds that the additional utility decreases with each unit added. Diminishing marginal utility is\nanother example of the more general law of diminishing returns we learned earlier in the chapter onChoice in\na World of Scarcity.\nThe rest ofTable 6.2shows the quantity of movies that Jos\u00e9 attends, and his total and marginal utility from\nseeing each movie. Total utility follows the expected pattern: it increases as the number of movies that Jos\u00e9\nwatches rises. Marginal utility also follows the expected pattern: each additional movie brings a smaller gain in\nutility than the previous one. The first movie Jos\u00e9 attends is the one he wanted to see the most, and thus\nprovides him with the highest level of utility or satisfaction. The fifth movie he attends is just to kill time.\nNotice that total utility is also the sum of the marginal utilities. Read the next Work It Out feature for\ninstructions on how to calculate total utility.\nT-Shirts (Quantity) Total Utility Marginal Utility Movies (Quantity) Total Utility Marginal Utility\n1 22 22 1 16 16\n2 43 21 2 31 15\n3 63 20 3 45 14\n4 81 18 4 58 13\n5 97 16 5 70 12\n6 111 14 6 81 11\n7 123 12 7 91 10\n8 133 10 8 100 9\nTABLE6.2Total and Marginal Utility\nTable 6.3looks at each point on the budget constraint inFigure 6.2, and adds up Jos\u00e9\u2019s total utility for five\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.1 \u2022 Consumption Choices 141\npossible combinations of T-shirts and movies.\nPoint T-Shirts Movies Total Utility\nP 4 0 81 + 0 = 81\nQ 3 2 63 + 31 = 94\nR 2 4 43 + 58 = 101\nS 1 6 22 + 81 = 103\nT 0 8 0 + 100 = 100\nTABLE6.3Finding the Choice with the\nHighest Utility\nWORK IT OUT\nCalculating Total Utility\nLet\u2019s look at how Jos\u00e9 makes his decision in more detail.\nStep 1. Observe that, at point Q (for example), Jos\u00e9 consumes three T-shirts and two movies.\nStep 2. Look atTable 6.2. You can see from the fourth row/second column that three T-shirts are worth 63 utils.\nSimilarly, the second row/fifth column shows that two movies are worth 31 utils.\nStep 3. From this information, you can calculate that point Q has a total utility of 94 (63 + 31).\nStep 4. You can repeat the same calculations for each point onTable 6.3, in which the total utility numbers are\nshown in the last column.\nFor Jos\u00e9, the highest total utility for all possible combinations of goods occurs at point S, with a total utility of\n103 from consuming one T-shirt and six movies.\nChoosing with Marginal Utility\nMost people approach their utility-maximizing combination of choices in a step-by-step way. This approach is\nbased on looking at the tradeoffs, measured in terms of marginal utility, of consuming less of one good and\nmore of another.\nFor example, say that Jos\u00e9 starts off thinking about spending all his money on T-shirts and choosing point P,\nwhich corresponds to four T-shirts and no movies, asFigure 6.2illustrates. Jos\u00e9 chooses this starting point\nrandomly as he has to start somewhere. Then he considers giving up the last T-shirt, the one that provides him\nthe least marginal utility, and using the money he saves to buy two movies instead.Table 6.4tracks the step-\nby-step series of decisions Jos\u00e9 needs to make (Key: T-shirts are $14, movies are $7, and income is $56). The\nfollowing Work It Out feature explains how marginal utility can affect decision making. 142 6 \u2022 Consumer Choices\nMarginal Gain and Loss of Utility, Compared\nTry Which Has Total Utility Conclusion\nwith Previous Choice\n4 T-shirts\nChoice 81 from 4 T-shirts + 0\nand 0 \u2013 \u2013\n1: P from 0 movies = 81\nmovies\n3 T-shirts Q is\nChoice 63 from 3 T-shirts + 31 Loss of 18 from 1 less T-shirt, but gain of 31 from\nand 2 preferred\n2: Q from 0 movies = 94 2 more movies, for a net utility gain of 13\nmovies over P\n2 T-shirts R is\nChoice 43 from 2 T-shirts + 58 Loss of 20 from 1 less T-shirt, but gain of 27 from\nand 4 preferred\n3: R from 4 movies = 101 two more movies for a net utility gain of 7\nmovies over Q\n1 T-shirt S is\nChoice 22 from 1 T-shirt + 81 Loss of 21 from 1 less T-shirt, but gain of 23 from\nand 6 preferred\n4: S from 6 movies = 103 two more movies, for a net utility gain of 2\nmovies over R\n0 T-shirts S is\nChoice 0 from 0 T-shirts + 100 Loss of 22 from 1 less T-shirt, but gain of 19 from\nand 8 preferred\n5: T from 8 movies = 100 two more movies, for a net utility loss of 3\nmovies over T\nTABLE6.4A Step-by-Step Approach to Maximizing Utility\nWORK IT OUT\nDecision Making by Comparing Marginal Utility\nJos\u00e9 could use the following thought process (if he thought in utils) to make his decision regarding how many T-\nshirts and movies to purchase:\nStep 1. FromTable 6.2, Jos\u00e9 can see that the marginal utility of the fourth T-shirt is 18. If Jos\u00e9 gives up the\nfourth T-shirt, then he loses 18 utils.\nStep 2. Giving up the fourth T-shirt, however, frees up $14 (the price of a T-shirt), allowing Jos\u00e9 to buy the first\ntwo movies (at $7 each).\nStep 3. Jos\u00e9 knows that the marginal utility of the first movie is 16 and the marginal utility of the second movie is\n15. Thus, if Jos\u00e9 moves from point P to point Q, he gives up 18 utils (from the T-shirt), but gains 31 utils (from the\nmovies).\nStep 4. Gaining 31 utils and losing 18 utils is a net gain of 13. This is just another way of saying that the total\nutility at Q (94 according to the last column inTable 6.3) is 13 more than the total utility at P (81).\nStep 5. Thus, for Jos\u00e9, it makes sense to give up the fourth T-shirt in order to buy two movies.\nJos\u00e9 clearly prefers point Q to point P. Now repeat this step-by-step process of decision making with marginal\nutilities. Jos\u00e9 thinks about giving up the third T-shirt and surrendering a marginal utility of 20, in exchange for\npurchasing two more movies that promise a combined marginal utility of 27. Jos\u00e9 prefers point R to point Q.\nWhat if Jos\u00e9 thinks about going beyond R to point S? Giving up the second T-shirt means a marginal utility loss\nof 21, and the marginal utility gain from the fifth and sixth movies would combine to make a marginal utility\ngain of 23, so Jos\u00e9 prefers point S to R.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.1 \u2022 Consumption Choices 143\nHowever, if Jos\u00e9 seeks to go beyond point S to point T, he finds that the loss of marginal utility from giving up\nthe first T-shirt is 22, while the marginal utility gain from the last two movies is only a total of 19. If Jos\u00e9 were\nto choose point T, his utility would fall to 100. Through these stages of thinking about marginal tradeoffs, Jos\u00e9\nagain concludes that S, with one T-shirt and six movies, is the choice that will provide him with the highest\nlevel of total utility. This step-by-step approach will reach the same conclusion regardless of Jos\u00e9\u2019s starting\npoint.\nWe can develop a more systematic way of using this approach by focusing on satisfaction per dollar. If an item\ncosting $5 yields 10 utils, then it\u2019s worth 2 utils per dollar spent.Marginal utility per dollaris the amount of\nadditional utility Jos\u00e9 receives divided by the product's price.Table 6.5shows the marginal utility per dollar\nfor Jos\u00e9's T shirts and movies.\nIf Jos\u00e9 wants to maximize the utility he gets from his limited budget, he will always purchase the item with the\ngreatest marginal utility per dollar of expenditure (assuming he can afford it with his remaining budget). Jos\u00e9\nstarts with no purchases. If he purchases a T-shirt, the marginal utility per dollar spent will be 1.6. If he\npurchases a movie, the marginal utility per dollar spent will be 2.3. Therefore, Jos\u00e9\u2019s first purchase will be the\nmovie. Why? Because it gives him the highest marginal utility per dollar and is affordable. Next, Jos\u00e9 will\npurchase another movie. Why? Because the marginal utility of the next movie (2.14) is greater than the\nmarginal utility of the next T-shirt (1.6). Note that when Jos\u00e9 has no T- shirts, the next one is the first one. Jos\u00e9\nwill continue to purchase the next good with the highest marginal utility per dollar until he exhausts his\nbudget. He will continue purchasing movies because they give him a greater \"bang for the buck\" until the sixth\nmovie which gives the same marginal utility per dollar as the first T-shirt purchase. Jos\u00e9 has just enough\nbudget to purchase both. So in total, Jos\u00e9 will purchase six movies and one T-shirt.\nQuantity of Total Marginal Marginal Utility Quantity of Total Marginal Marginal Utility\nT-Shirts Utility Utility per Dollar Movies Utility Utility per Dollar\n1 22 22 22/$14=1.6 1 16 16 16/$7=2.3\n2 43 21 21/$14=1.5 2 31 15 15/$7=2.14\n3 63 20 20/$14=1.4 3 45 14 14/$7=2\n4 81 18 18/$14=1.3 4 58 13 13/$7=1.9\n5 97 16 16/$14=1.1 5 70 12 12/$7=1.7\n6 111 14 14/$14=1 6 81 11 11/$7=1.6\n7 123 12 12/$14=1.2 7 91 10 10/$7=1.4\nTABLE6.5Marginal Utility per Dollar\nA Rule for Maximizing Utility\nThis process of decision making suggests a rule to follow whenmaximizing utility. Since the price of T-shirts is\ntwice as high as the price of movies, to maximize utility the last T-shirt that Jos\u00e9 chose needs to provide exactly\ntwice the marginal utility (MU) of the last movie. If the last T-shirt provides less than twice the marginal utility\nof the last movie, then the T-shirt is providing less \u201cbang for the buck\u201d (i.e., marginal utility per dollar spent)\nthan Jos\u00e9 would receive from spending the same money on movies. If this is so, Jos\u00e9 should trade the T-shirt\nfor more movies to increase his total utility. 144 6 \u2022 Consumer Choices\nIf the last T-shirt provides more than twice the marginal utility of the last movie, then the T-shirt is providing\nmore \u201cbang for the buck\u201d or marginal utility per dollar, than if the money were spent on movies. As a result,\nJos\u00e9 should buy more T-shirts. Notice that at Jos\u00e9\u2019s optimal choice of point S, the marginal utility from the first\nT-shirt, of 22 is exactly twice the marginal utility of the sixth movie, which is 11. At this choice, the marginal\nutility per dollar is the same for both goods. This is a tell-tale signal that Jos\u00e9 has found the point with highest\ntotal utility.\nWe can write this argument as a general rule: If you always choose the item with the greatest marginal utility\nper dollar spent, when your budget is exhausted, the utility maximizing choice should occur where the\nmarginal utility per dollar spent is the same for both goods.\nA sensible economizer will pay twice as much for something only if, in the marginal comparison, the item\nconfers twice as much utility. Notice that the formula for the table above is:\nThe following Work It Out feature provides step by step guidance for this concept of utility-maximizing choices.\nWORK IT OUT\nMaximizing Utility\nThe general rule, , means that the last dollar spent on each good provides exactly the same\nmarginal utility. This is the case at point S. So:\nStep 1. If we traded a dollar more of movies for a dollar more of T-shirts, the marginal utility gained from T-shirts\nwould exactly offset the marginal utility lost from fewer movies. In other words, the net gain would be zero.\nStep 2. Products, however, usually cost more than a dollar, so we cannot trade a dollar\u2019s worth of movies. The\nbest we can do is trade two movies for another T-shirt, since in this example T-shirts cost twice what a movie\ndoes.\nStep 3. If we trade two movies for one T-shirt, we would end up at point R (two T-shirts and four movies).\nStep 4. Choice 4 inTable 6.4shows that if we move to point R, we would gain 21 utils from one more T-shirt, but\nlose 23 utils from two fewer movies, so we would end up with less total utility at point R.\nIn short, the general rule shows us the utility-maximizing choice, which is called theconsumer equilibrium.\nThere is another equivalent way to think about this. We can also express the general rule asthe ratio of the\nprices of the two goods should be equal to the ratio of the marginal utilities.When we divide the price of good 1\nby the price of good 2, at the utility-maximizing point this will equal the marginal utility of good 1 divided by\nthe marginal utility of good 2.\nAlong the budget constraint, the total price of the two goods remains the same, so the ratio of the prices does\nnot change. However, the marginal utility of the two goods changes with the quantities consumed. At the\noptimal choice of one T-shirt and six movies, point S, the ratio of marginal utility to price for T-shirts (22:14)\nmatches the ratio of marginal utility to price for movies (of 11:7).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.2 \u2022 How Changes in Income and Prices Affect Consumption Choices 145\nMeasuring Utility with Numbers\nThis discussion of utility began with an assumption that it is possible to place numerical values on utility, an\nassumption that may seem questionable. You can buy a thermometer for measuring temperature at the\nhardware store, but what store sells a \u201cutilimometer\u201d for measuring utility? While measuring utility with\nnumbers is a convenient assumption to clarify the explanation, the key assumption is not that an outside party\ncan measure utility but only that individuals can decide which of two alternatives they prefer.\nTo understand this point, think back to the step-by-step process of finding the choice with highest total utility\nby comparing the marginal utility you gain and lose from different choices along the budget constraint. As Jos\u00e9\ncompares each choice along his budget constraint to the previous choice, what matters is not the specific\nnumbers that he places on his utility\u2014or whether he uses any numbers at all\u2014but only that he personally can\nidentify which choices he prefers.\nIn this way, the step-by-step process of choosing the highest level of utility resembles rather closely how many\npeople make consumption decisions. We think about what will make us the happiest. We think about what\nthings cost. We think about buying a little more of one item and giving up a little of something else. We choose\nwhat provides us with the greatest level of satisfaction. The vocabulary of comparing the points along a budget\nconstraint and total and marginal utility is just a set of tools for discussing this everyday process in a clear and\nspecific manner. It is welcome news that specific utility numbers are not central to the argument, since a good\nutilimometer is hard to find. Do not worry\u2014while we cannot measure utils, by the end of the next module, we\nwill have transformed our analysis into something we can measure\u2014demand.\n6.2How Changes in Income and Prices Affect Consumption Choices\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain how income, prices, and preferences affect consumer choices\n\u2022 Contrast the substitution effect and the income effect\n\u2022 Utilize concepts of demand to analyze consumer choices\n\u2022 Apply utility-maximizing choices to governments and businesses\nJust as we can use utility and marginal utility to discuss making consumer choices along a budget constraint,\nwe can also use these ideas to think about how consumer choices change when the budget constraint shifts in\nresponse to changes in income or price. Because we can use the budget constraint framework to analyze how\nquantities demanded change because of price movements, the budget constraint model can illustrate the\nunderlying logic behind demand curves.\nHow Changes in Income Affect Consumer Choices\nLet\u2019s begin with a concrete example illustrating how changes in income level affect consumer choices.Figure\n6.3shows abudget constraintthat represents Kimberly\u2019s choice between concert tickets at $50 each and\ngetting away overnight to a bed-and-breakfast for $200 per night. Kimberly has $1,000 per year to spend\nbetween these two choices. After thinking about her total utility and marginal utility and applying the decision\nrule that the ratio of the marginal utilities to the prices should be equal between the two products, Kimberly\nchooses point M, with eight concerts and three overnight getaways as her utility-maximizing choice. 146 6 \u2022 Consumer Choices\nFIGURE6.3How a Change in Income Affects Consumption ChoicesThe utility-maximizing choice on the original\nbudget constraint is M. The dashed horizontal and vertical lines extending through point M allow you to see at a\nglance whether the quantity consumed of goods on the new budget constraint is higher or lower than on the original\nbudget constraint. On the new budget constraint, Kimberly will make a choice like N if both goods are normal goods.\nIf overnight stays is an inferior good, Kimberly will make a choice like P. If concert tickets are an inferior good,\nKimberly will make a choice like Q.\nNow, assume that the income Kimberly has to spend on these two items rises to $2,000 per year, causing her\nbudget constraint to shift out to the right. How does this rise in income alter her utility-maximizing choice?\nKimberly will again consider the utility and marginal utility that she receives from concert tickets and\novernight getaways and seek herutility-maximizing choiceon the new budget line, but how will her new choice\nrelate to her original choice?\nWe can replace the possible choices along the new budget constraint into three groups, which the dashed\nhorizontal and vertical lines that pass through the original choice M in the figure divide. All choices on the\nupper left of the new budget constraint that are to the left of the vertical dashed line, like choice P with two\novernight stays and 32 concert tickets, involve less of the good on the horizontal axis but much more of the\ngood on the vertical axis. All choices to the right of the vertical dashed line and above the horizontal dashed\nline\u2014like choice N with five overnight getaways and 20 concert tickets\u2014have more consumption of both goods.\nFinally, all choices that are to the right of the vertical dashed line but below the horizontal dashed line, like\nchoice Q with four concerts and nine overnight getaways, involve less of the good on the vertical axis but much\nmore of the good on the horizontal axis.\nAll of these choices are theoretically possible, depending on Kimberly\u2019s personal preferences as expressed\nthrough the total and marginal utility she would receive from consuming these two goods. When income rises,\nthe most common reaction is to purchase more of both goods, like choice N, which is to the upper right relative\nto Kimberly\u2019s original choice M, although exactly how much more of each good will vary according to personal\ntaste. Conversely, when income falls, the most typical reaction is to purchase less of both goods. As we defined\nin the chapter onDemand and Supplyand again in the chapter onElasticity, we call goods and servicesnormal\ngoodswhen a rise in income leads to a rise in the quantity consumed of that good and a fall in income leads to\na fall in quantity consumed.\nHowever, depending on Kimberly\u2019s preferences, a rise in income could cause consumption of one good to\nincrease while consumption of the other good declines. A choice like P means that a rise in income caused her\nquantity consumed of overnight stays to decline, while a choice like Q would mean that a rise in income caused\nher quantity of concerts to decline. Goods where demand declines as income rises (or conversely, where the\ndemand rises as income falls) are called \u201cinferior goods.\u201d Aninferior goodoccurs when people trim back on a\ngood as income rises, because they can now afford the more expensive choices that they prefer. For example, a\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.2 \u2022 How Changes in Income and Prices Affect Consumption Choices 147\nhigher-income household might eat fewer hamburgers or be less likely to buy a used car, and instead eat more\nsteak and buy a new car.\nHow Price Changes Affect Consumer Choices\nFor analyzing the possible effect of a change in price on consumption, let\u2019s again use a concrete example.\nFigure 6.4represents Sergei's consumer choice, who chooses between purchasing baseball bats and cameras.\nA price increase for baseball bats would have no effect on the ability to purchase cameras, but it would reduce\nthe number of bats Sergei could afford to buy. Thus a price increase for baseball bats, the good on the\nhorizontal axis, causes the budget constraint to rotate inward, as if on a hinge, from the vertical axis. As in the\nprevious section, the point labeled M represents the originally preferred point on the original budget\nconstraint, which Sergei has chosen after contemplating his total utility and marginal utility and the tradeoffs\ninvolved along the budget constraint. In this example, the units along the horizontal and vertical axes are not\nnumbered, so the discussion must focus on whether Sergei will consume more or less of certain goods, not on\nnumerical amounts.\nFIGURE6.4How a Change in Price Affects Consumption ChoicesThe original utility-maximizing choice is M. When\nthe price rises, the budget constraint rotates clockwise. The dashed lines make it possible to see at a glance\nwhether the new consumption choice involves less of both goods, or less of one good and more of the other. The\nnew possible choices would be fewer baseball bats and more cameras, like point H, or less of both goods, as at\npoint J. Choice K would mean that the higher price of bats led to exactly the same quantity of bat consumption, but\nfewer cameras. Theoretically possible, but unlikely in the real world, we rule out choices like L because they would\nmean that a higher price for baseball bats means a greater consumption of baseball bats.\nAfter the price increase, Sergei will make a choice along the new budget constraint. Again, we can divide his\nchoices into three segments by the dashed vertical and horizontal lines. In the upper left portion of the new\nbudget constraint, at a choice like H, Sergei consumes more cameras and fewer bats. In the central portion of\nthe new budget constraint, at a choice like J, he consumes less of both goods. At the right-hand end, at a choice\nlike L, he consumes more bats but fewer cameras.\nThe typical response to higher prices is that a person chooses to consume less of the product with the higher\nprice. This occurs for two reasons, and both effects can occur simultaneously. Thesubstitution effectoccurs\nwhen a price changes and consumers have an incentive to consume less of the good with a relatively higher\nprice and more of the good with a relatively lower price. Theincome effectis that a higher price means, in\neffect, the buying power of income has been reduced (even though actual income has not changed), which\nleads to buying less of the good (when the good is normal). In this example, the higher price for baseball bats\nwould cause Sergei to buy fewer bats for both reasons. Exactly how much will a higher price for bats cause\nSergei's bat consumption to fall?Figure 6.4suggests a range of possibilities. Sergei might react to a higher\nprice for baseball bats by purchasing the same quantity of bats, but cutting his camera consumption. This\nchoice is the point K on the new budget constraint, straight below the original choice M. Alternatively, Sergei 148 6 \u2022 Consumer Choices\nmight react by dramatically reducing his bat purchases and instead buy more cameras.\nThe key is that it would be imprudent to assume that a change in the price of one good will only affect\nconsumption of that good. In our example, since Sergei purchases all his products out of the same budget, a\nchange in the price of baseball bats can also have a range of effects, either positive or negative, on his\npurchases of cameras. Since Sergei purchases all his products out of the same budget, a change in the price of\none good can also have a range of effects, either positive or negative, on the quantity consumed of other goods.\nIn short, a higher price typically causes reduced consumption of the good in question, but it can affect the\nconsumption of other goods as well.\nLINK IT UP\nRead thisarticle(http://openstax.org/l/vending)about the potential of variable prices in vending machines.\nThe Foundations of Demand Curves\nChanges in the price of a good lead the budget constraint to rotate. A rotation in the budget constraint means\nthat when individuals are seeking their highest utility, the quantity that is demanded of that good will change.\nIn this way, the logical foundations of demand curves\u2014which show a connection between prices and quantity\ndemanded\u2014are based on the underlying idea of individuals seeking utility.Figure 6.5(a) shows a budget\nconstraint with a choice between housing and \u201ceverything else.\u201d (Putting \u201ceverything else\u201d on the vertical axis\ncan be a useful approach in some cases, especially when the focus of the analysis is on one particular good.)\nWe label the preferred choice on the original budget constraint that provides the highest possible utility M .\n0\nThe other three budget constraints represent successively higher prices for housing of P , P , and P . As the\n1 2 3\nbudget constraint rotates in, and in, and in again, we label the utility-maximizing choices M , M , and M , and\n1 2 3\nthe quantity demanded of housing falls from Q to Q to Q to Q .\n0 1 2 3\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.2 \u2022 How Changes in Income and Prices Affect Consumption Choices 149\nFIGURE6.5The Foundations of a Demand Curve: An Example of Housing(a) As the price increases from P to P to\n0 1\nP to P , the budget constraint on the upper part of the diagram rotates clockwise. The utility-maximizing choice\n2 3\nchanges from M to M to M to M . As a result, the quantity demanded of housing shifts from Q to Q to Q to Q ,\n0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3\nceteris paribus. (b) The demand curve graphs each combination of the price of housing and the quantity of housing\ndemanded,ceteris paribus. The quantities of housing are the same at the points on both (a) and (b). Thus, the\noriginal price of housing (P ) and the original quantity of housing (Q ) appear on the demand curve as point E . The\n0 0 0\nhigher price of housing (P ) and the corresponding lower quantity demanded of housing (Q ) appear on the demand\n1 1\ncurve as point E .\n1\nThus, as the price of housing rises, the budget constraint rotates clockwise and the quantity consumed of\nhousing falls,ceteris paribus(meaning, with all other things being the same). We graph this relationship\u2014the\nprice of housing rising from P to P to P to P , while the quantity of housing demanded falls from Q to Q to\n0 1 2 3 0 1\nQ to Q \u2014on the demand curve inFigure 6.5(b). The vertical dashed lines stretching between the top and\n2 3\nbottom ofFigure 6.5show that the quantity of housing demanded at each point is the same in both (a) and (b).\nWe ultimately determine the shape of a demand curve by the underlying choices about maximizing utility\nsubject to a budget constraint. While economists may not be able to measure \u201cutils,\u201d they can certainly\nmeasure price and quantity demanded.\nApplications in Government and Business\nThe budget constraint framework for making utility-maximizing choices offers a reminder that people can\nreact to a change in price or income in a range of different ways. For example, in the winter months of 2005,\ncosts for heating homes increased significantly in many parts of the country as prices for natural gas and\nelectricity soared, due in large part to the disruption caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Some people 150 6 \u2022 Consumer Choices\nreacted by reducing the quantity demanded of energy; for example, by turning down the thermostats in their\nhomes by a few degrees and wearing a heavier sweater inside. Even so, many home heating bills rose, so\npeople adjusted their consumption in other ways, too. As you learned in the chapter onElasticity, the short run\ndemand for home heating is generally inelastic. Each household cut back on what it valued least on the\nmargin. For some it might have been some dinners out, or a vacation, or postponing buying a new refrigerator\nor a new car. Sharply higher energy prices can have effects beyond the energy market, leading to a widespread\nreduction in purchasing throughout the rest of the economy.\nA similar issue arises when the government imposes taxes on certain products, such as on gasoline, cigarettes,\nand alcohol. Say that a tax on alcohol leads to a higher price at the liquor store. The higher price of alcohol\ncauses the budget constraint to pivot left, and alcoholic beverage consumption is likely to decrease. However,\npeople may also react to the higher price of alcoholic beverages by cutting back on other purchases. For\nexample, they might cut back on snacks at restaurants like chicken wings and nachos. It would be unwise to\nassume that the liquor industry is the only one affected by the tax on alcoholic beverages. Read the next Clear\nIt Up to learn about how who controls the household income influences buying decisions.\nThe Unifying Power of the Utility-Maximizing Budget Set Framework\nAn interaction between prices, budget constraints, and personal preferences determine household choices.\nThe flexible and powerful terminology of utility-maximizing gives economists a vocabulary for bringing these\nelements together.\nNot even economists believe that people walk around mumbling about their marginal utilities before they walk\ninto a shopping mall, accept a job, or make a deposit in a savings account. However, economists do believe that\nindividuals seek their own satisfaction or utility and that people often decide to try a little less of one thing and\na little more of another. If we accept these assumptions, then the idea of utility-maximizing households facing\nbudget constraints becomes highly plausible.\nCLEAR IT UP\nDoes who controls household income make a difference?\nIn the mid-1970s, the United Kingdom made an interesting policy change in its \u201cchild allowance\u201d policy. This\nprogram provides a fixed amount of money per child to every family, regardless of family income. Traditionally, the\nchild allowance had been distributed to families by withholding less in taxes from the paycheck of the family wage\nearner\u2014typically the father in this time period. The new policy instead provided the child allowance as a cash\npayment to the mother. As a result of this change, households have the same level of income and face the same\nprices in the market, but the money is more likely to be in the mother's purse than in the father's wallet.\nShould this change in policy alter household consumption patterns? Basic models of consumption decisions, of the\nsort that we examined in this chapter, assume that it does not matter which parent or guardian receives the money,\nbecause both seek to maximize the family's utility as a whole. In effect, this model assumes that everyone in the\nfamily has the same makeup or has the same preferences.\nThere has not been extensive research on diverse family structures and guardian/parent sex and gender related to\nspending. However, the older research on families with one man and one woman parent indicates that gender does\naffect spending decisions. When the mother controls a larger share of family income a number of studies, in the\nUnited Kingdom and in a wide variety of other countries, have found that the family tends to spend more on\nrestaurant meals, child care, and women\u2019s clothing, and less on alcohol and tobacco. As the mother controls a larger\nshare of household resources, children\u2019s health improves, too. These findings suggest that when providing\nassistance to families, in high-income countries and low-income countries alike, the monetary amount of assistance\nis not all that matters: it also matters which family member actually receives the money.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.3 \u2022 Behavioral Economics: An Alternative Framework for Consumer Choice 151\nThe budget constraint framework serves as a constant reminder to think about the full range of effects that can\narise from changes in income or price, not just effects on the one product that might seem most immediately\naffected.\n6.3Behavioral Economics: An Alternative Framework for Consumer Choice\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Evaluate the reasons for making intertemporal choices\n\u2022 Interpret an intertemporal budget constraint\n\u2022 Analyze why people in America tend to save such a small percentage of their income\nAs we know, people sometimes make decisions that seem \u201cirrational\u201d and not in their own best interest.\nPeople\u2019s decisions can seem inconsistent from one day to the next and they even deliberately ignore ways to\nsave money or time. The traditional economic models assume rationality, which means that people take all\navailable information and make consistent and informed decisions that are in their best interest. (In fact,\neconomics professors often delight in pointing out so-called \u201cirrational behavior\u201d each semester to their new\nstudents, and present economics as a way to become more rational.)\nHowever, a new group of economists, known as behavioral economists, argue that the traditional method omits\nsomething important: people\u2019s state of mind. For example, one can think differently about money if one is\nfeeling revenge, optimism, or loss. These are not necessarily irrational states of mind, but part of a range of\nemotions that can affect anyone on a given day. In addition, actions under these conditions are predictable, if\none better understands the underlying environment.Behavioral economicsseeks to enrich our\nunderstanding of decision-making by integrating the insights of psychology into economics. It does this by\ninvestigating how given dollar amounts can mean different things to individuals depending on the situation.\nThis can lead to decisions that appear outwardly inconsistent, or irrational, to the outside observer.\nThe way the mind works, according to this view, may seem inconsistent to traditional economists but is\nactually far more complex than an unemotional cost-benefit adding machine. For example, a traditional\neconomist would say that if you lost a $10 bill today, and also received an extra $10 in your paycheck, you\nshould feel perfectly neutral. After all, \u2013$10 + $10 = $0. You are the same financially as you were before.\nHowever, behavioral economists have conducted research that shows many people will feel some negative\nemotion, such as anger or frustration, after those two things happen. We tend to focus more on the loss than\nthe gain. We call thisloss aversion, where a $1 loss pains us 2.25 times more than a $1 gain helps us, according\nto the economists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in a famous 1979 article in the journalEconometrica.\nThis insight has implications for investing, as people tend to \u201coverplay\u201d the stock market by reacting more to\nlosses than to gains. This behavior looks irrational to traditional economists, but is consistent once we\nunderstand better how the mind works, these economists argue.\nTraditional economists also assume human beings have complete self control, but, for instance, people will\nbuy cigarettes by the pack instead of the carton even though the carton saves them money, to keep usage\ndown. They purchase locks for their refrigerators and overpay on taxes to force themselves to save. In other\nwords, we protect ourselves from our worst temptations but pay a price to do so. One way behavioral\neconomists are responding to this is by establishing ways for people to keep themselves free of these\ntemptations. This includes what we call \u201cnudges\u201d toward more rational behavior rather than mandatory\nregulations from government. For example, up to 20 percent of new employees do not enroll in retirement\nsavings plans immediately, because of procrastination or feeling overwhelmed by the different choices. Some\ncompanies are now moving to a new system, where employees are automatically enrolled unless they \u201copt\nout.\u201d Almost no-one opts out in this program and employees begin saving at the early years, which are most\ncritical for retirement.\nAnother area that seems illogical is the idea of mental accounting, or putting dollars in different mental 152 6 \u2022 Consumer Choices\ncategories where they take different values. Economists typically consider dollars to befungible, or having\nequal value to the individual, regardless of the situation.\nYou might, for instance, think of the $25 you found in the street differently from the $25 you earned from three\nhours working in a fast food restaurant. You might treat the street money as \u201cmad money\u201d with little rational\nregard to getting the best value. This is in one sense strange, since it is still equivalent to three hours of hard\nwork in the restaurant. Yet the \u201ceasy come-easy go\u201d mentality replaces the rational economizer because of the\nsituation, or context, in which you attained the money.\nIn another example of mental accounting that seems inconsistent to a traditional economist, a person could\ncarry a credit card debt of $1,000 that has a 15% yearly interest cost, and simultaneously have a $2,000\nsavings account that pays only 2% per year. That means she pays $150 a year to the credit card company, while\ncollecting only $40 annually in bank interest, so she loses $110 a year. That doesn\u2019t seem wise.\nThe \u201crational\u201d decision would be to pay off the debt, since a $1,000 savings account with $0 in debt is the\nequivalent net worth, and she would now net $20 per year. Curiously, it is not uncommon for people to ignore\nthis advice, since they will treat a loss to their savings account as higher than the benefit of paying off their\ncredit card. They do not treat the dollars as fungible so it looks irrational to traditional economists.\nWhich view is right, the behavioral economists\u2019 or the traditional view? Both have their advantages, but\nbehavioral economists have at least identified trying to describe and explain behavior that economists have\nhistorically dismissed as irrational. If most of us are engaged in some \u201cirrational behavior,\u201d perhaps there are\ndeeper underlying reasons for this behavior in the first place.\nBRING IT HOME\nMaking Choices\nIn what category did consumers worldwide increase their spending during the Great Recession? Higher education.\nAccording to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), enrollment in colleges\nand universities rose one-third in China and almost two-thirds in Saudi Arabia, nearly doubled in Pakistan, tripled in\nUganda, and surged by three million\u201418 percent\u2014in the United States. Why were consumers willing to spend on\neducation during lean times? Both individuals and countries view higher education as the way to prosperity. Many\nfeel that increased earnings are a significant benefit of attending college.\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data from May 2012 supports this view, asFigure 6.6shows. They show a positive\ncorrelation between earnings and education. The data also indicate that unemployment rates fall with higher levels\nof education and training.\nWhy spend the money to go to college during recession? Because if you are unemployed (or underemployed,\nworking fewer hours than you would like), the opportunity cost of your time is low. If you\u2019re unemployed, you don\u2019t\nhave to give up work hours and income by going to college.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.3 \u2022 Behavioral Economics: An Alternative Framework for Consumer Choice 153\nFIGURE6.6The Impact of Education on Earnings and Unemployment Rates, 2012Those with the highest degrees\nin 2012 had substantially lower unemployment rates; whereas, those with the least formal education suffered from\nthe highest unemployment rates.

Individuals are the only judge of their own utility. In general, greater consumption of a\ngood brings higher total utility. However, the additional utility people receive from each unit of greater\nconsumption tends to decline in a pattern of diminishing marginal utility.\nWe can find the utility-maximizing choice on a consumption budget constraint in several ways. You can add up\ntotal utility of each choice on the budget line and choose the highest total. You can select a starting point at\nrandom and compare the marginal utility gains and losses of moving to neighboring points\u2014and thus\neventually seek out the preferred choice. Alternatively, you can compare the ratio of the marginal utility to\nprice of good 1 with the marginal utility to price of good 2 and apply the rule that at the optimal choice, the two\nratios should be equal:\n6.2How Changes in Income and Prices Affect Consumption Choices\nThe budget constraint framework suggest that when income or price changes, a range of responses are\npossible. When income rises, households will demand a higher quantity of normal goods, but a lower quantity\nof inferior goods. When the price of a good rises, households will typically demand less of that good\u2014but\nwhether they will demand a much lower quantity or only a slightly lower quantity will depend on personal\npreferences. Also, a higher price for one good can lead to more or less demand of the other good.\n6.3Behavioral Economics: An Alternative Framework for Consumer Choice\nPeople regularly make decisions that seem less than rational, decisions that contradict traditional consumer\ntheory. This is because traditional theory ignores people\u2019s state of mind or feelings, which can influence\nbehavior. For example, people tend to value a dollar lost more than a dollar gained, even though the amounts\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6 \u2022 Self-Check Questions 155\nare the same. Similarly, many people over withhold on their taxes, essentially giving the government a free\nloan until they file their tax returns, so that they are more likely to get money back than have to pay money on\ntheir taxes.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

Praxilla, who lived in ancient Greece, derives utility from reading poems and from eating cucumbers.\nPraxilla gets 30 units of marginal utility from her first poem, 27 units of marginal utility from her second\npoem, 24 units of marginal utility from her third poem, and so on, with marginal utility declining by three\nunits for each additional poem. Praxilla gets six units of marginal utility for each of her first three\ncucumbers consumed, five units of marginal utility for each of her next three cucumbers consumed, four\nunits of marginal utility for each of the following three cucumbers consumed, and so on, with marginal\nutility declining by one for every three cucumbers consumed. A poem costs three bronze coins but a\ncucumber costs only one bronze coin. Praxilla has 18 bronze coins. Sketch Praxilla\u2019s budget set between\npoems and cucumbers, placing poems on the vertical axis and cucumbers on the horizontal axis. Start off\nwith the choice of zero poems and 18 cucumbers, and calculate the changes in marginal utility of moving\nalong the budget line to the next choice of one poem and 15 cucumbers. Using this step-by-step process\nbased on marginal utility, create a table and identify Praxilla\u2019s utility-maximizing choice.

Prior to\nAmazon, independent bookstores with limited inventories in small retail locations primarily sold books. There were\nexceptions, of course. Borders and Barnes & Noble offered larger stores in urban areas. In the last decade, however,\nindependent bookstores have mostly disappeared, Borders has gone out of business, and Barnes & Noble is\nstruggling. Online delivery and purchase of books has overtaken the more traditional business models. How has 158 7 \u2022 Production, Costs, and Industry Structure\nAmazon changed the book selling industry? How has it managed to crush its competition?\nA major reason for the giant retailer\u2019s success is its production model and cost structure, which has enabled\nAmazon to undercut the competitors' prices even when factoring in the cost of shipping. Read on to see how firms\ngreat (like Amazon) and small (like your corner deli) determine what to sell, at what output, and price.\nThis chapter is the first of four chapters that explores thetheory of the firm. This theory explains how firms\nbehave. What does that mean? Let\u2019s define what we mean by the firm. Afirm(or producer or business)\ncombines inputs of labor, capital, land, and raw or finished component materials to produce outputs. If the\nfirm is successful, the outputs are more valuable than the inputs. This activity ofproductiongoes beyond\nmanufacturing (i.e., making things). It includes any process or service that creates value, including\ntransportation, distribution, wholesale and retail sales.\nProduction involves a number of important decisions that define a firm's behavior. These decisions include,\nbut are not limited to:\n\u2022 What product or products should the firm produce?\n\u2022 How should the firm produce the products (i.e., what production process should the firm use)?\n\u2022 How much output should the firm produce?\n\u2022 What price should the firm charge for its products?\n\u2022 How much labor should the firm employ?\nThe answers to these questions depend on the production and cost conditions facing each firm. That is the\nsubject of this chapter. The answers also depend on the market structure for the product(s) in question. Market\nstructure is a multidimensional concept that involves how competitive the industry is. We define it by\nquestions such as these:\n\u2022 How much market power does each firm in the industry possess?\n\u2022 How similar is each firm\u2019s product to the products of other firms in the industry?\n\u2022 How difficult is it for new firms to enter the industry?\n\u2022 Do firms compete on the basis of price, advertising, or other product differences?\nFigure 7.2illustrates the range of different market structures, which we will explore inPerfect Competition,\nMonopoly, andMonopolistic Competition and Oligopoly.\nFIGURE7.2The Spectrum of CompetitionFirms face different competitive situations. At one extreme\u2014perfect\ncompetition\u2014many firms are all trying to sell identical products. At the other extreme\u2014monopoly\u2014only one firm is\nselling the product, and this firm faces no competition. Monopolistic competition and oligopoly fall between the\nextremes of perfect competition and monopoly. Monopolistic competition is a situation with many firms selling\nsimilar, but not identical products. Oligopoly is a situation with few firms that sell identical or similar products.\nLet's examine how firms determine their costs and desired profit levels. Then we will discuss the origins of\ncost, both in the short and long run. Private enterprise, which can be private individual or group business\nownership, characterizes the U.S. economy. In the U.S. system, we have the option to organize private\nbusinesses as sole proprietorships (one owner), partners (more than one owner), and corporations (legal\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.1 \u2022 Explicit and Implicit Costs, and Accounting and Economic Profit 159\nentitles separate from the owners.\nWhen people think of businesses, often corporate giants like Wal-Mart, Microsoft, or General Motors come to\nmind. However, firms come in all sizes, asTable 7.1shows. The vast majority of American firms have fewer\nthan 20 employees. As of 2010, the U.S. Census Bureau counted 5.7 million firms with employees in the U.S.\neconomy. Slightly less than half of all the workers in private firms are at the 17,000 large firms, meaning they\nemploy more than 500 workers. Another 35% of workers in the U.S. economy are at firms with fewer than 100\nworkers. These small-scale businesses include everything from dentists and lawyers to businesses that mow\nlawns or clean houses.Table 7.1does not include a separate category for the millions of small \u201cnon-employer\u201d\nbusinesses where a single owner or a few partners are not officially paid wages or a salary, but simply receive\nwhatever they can earn.\nNumber of Employees Firms (% of total firms) Number of Paid Employees (% of total employment)\nTotal 5,734,538 112.0 million\n0\u20139 4,543,315 (79.2%) 12.3 million (11.0%)\n10\u201319 617,089 (10.8%) 8.3 million (7.4%)\n20\u201399 475,125 (8.3%) 18.6 million (16.6%)\n100\u2013499 81,773 (1.4%) 15.9 million (14.2%)\n500 or more 17,236 (0.30%) 50.9 million (49.8%)\nTABLE7.1Range in Size of U.S. Firms(Source: U.S. Census, 2010 www.census.gov)\n7.1Explicit and Implicit Costs, and Accounting and Economic Profit\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain the difference between explicit costs and implicit costs\n\u2022 Understand the relationship between cost and revenue\nEach business, regardless of size or complexity, tries to earn a profit:\nTotalrevenueis the income the firm generates from selling its products. We calculate it by multiplying the\nprice of the product times the quantity of output sold:\nWe will see in the following chapters that revenue is a function of the demand for the firm\u2019s products.\nTotal cost is what the firm pays for producing and selling its products. Recall that production involves the firm\nconverting inputs to outputs. Each of those inputs has a cost to the firm. The sum of all those costs is total cost.\nWe will learn in this chapter that short run costs are different from long run costs.\nWe can distinguish between two types of cost: explicit and implicit.Explicit costsare out-of-pocket costs, that\nis, actual payments. Wages that a firm pays its employees or rent that a firm pays for its office are explicit costs.\nImplicit costsare more subtle, but just as important. They represent the opportunity cost of using resources\nthat the firm already owns. Often for small businesses, they are resources that the owners contribute. For\nexample, working in the business while not earning a formal salary, or using the ground floor of a home as a\nretail store are both implicit costs. Implicit costs also include the depreciation of goods, materials, and\nequipment that are necessary for a company to operate. (See the Work It Out feature for an extended example.) 160 7 \u2022 Production, Costs, and Industry Structure\nThese two definitions of cost are important for distinguishing between two conceptions of profit, accounting\nprofit, and economic profit.Accounting profitis a cash concept. It means total revenue minus explicit\ncosts\u2014the difference between dollars brought in and dollars paid out.Economic profitis total revenue minus\ntotal cost, including both explicit and implicit costs. The difference is important because even though a\nbusiness pays income taxes based on its accounting profit, whether or not it is economically successful\ndepends on its economic profit.\nWORK IT OUT\nCalculating Implicit Costs\nConsider the following example. Eryn currently works for a corporate law firm. She is considering opening her\nown legal practice, where she expects to earn $200,000 per year once she establishes herself. To run her own\nfirm, she would need an office and a law clerk. She has found the perfect office, which rents for $50,000 per year.\nShe could hire a law clerk for $35,000 per year. If these figures are accurate, would Eryn\u2019s legal practice be\nprofitable?\nStep 1. First you have to calculate the costs. You can take what you know about explicit costs and total them:\nStep 2. Subtracting the explicit costs from the revenue gives you the accounting profit.\nHowever, these calculations consider only the explicit costs. To open her own practice, Eryn would have to quit\nher current job, where she is earning an annual salary of $125,000. This would be an implicit cost of opening her\nown firm.\nStep 3. You need to subtract both the explicit and implicit costs to determine the true economic profit:\nEryn would be losing $10,000 per year. That does not mean she would not want to open her own business, but it\ndoes mean she would be earning $10,000 less than if she worked for the corporate firm.\nImplicit costs can include other things as well. Maybe Eryn values her leisure time, and starting her own firm\nwould require her to put in more hours than at the corporate firm. In this case, the lost leisure would also be an\nimplicit cost that would subtract from economic profits.\nNow that we have an idea about the different types of costs, let\u2019s look at cost structures. A firm\u2019s cost structure\nin the long run may be different from that in the short run. We turn to that distinction in the next few sections.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.2 \u2022 Production in the Short Run 161\n7.2Production in the Short Run\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Understand the concept of a production function\n\u2022 Differentiate between the different types of inputs or factors in a production function\n\u2022 Differentiate between fixed and variable inputs\n\u2022 Differentiate between production in the short run and in the long run\n\u2022 Differentiate between total and marginal product\n\u2022 Understand the concept of diminishing marginal productivity\nIn this chapter, we want to explore the relationship between the quantity of output a firm produces, and the\ncost of producing that output. We mentioned that the cost of the product depends on how many inputs are\nrequired to produce the product and what those inputs cost. We can answer the former question by looking at\nthe firm\u2019s production function.\nFIGURE7.3The production process for pizza includes inputs such as ingredients, the efforts of the pizza maker, and\ntools and materials for cooking and serving. (Credit: \u201cGrilled gluten-free BBQ chicken pizza\u201d by Keith McDuffee/\nFlickr, CC BY 2.0)\nProduction is the process (or processes) a firm uses to transform inputs (e.g., labor, capital, raw materials) into\noutputs, i.e. the goods or services the firm wishes to sell. Consider pizza making. The pizzaiolo (pizza maker)\ntakes flour, water, and yeast to make dough. Similarly, the pizzaiolo may take tomatoes, spices, and water to\nmake pizza sauce. The cook rolls out the dough, brushes on the pizza sauce, and adds cheese and other\ntoppings. The pizzaiolo uses a peel\u2014the shovel-like wooden tool\u2014to put the pizza into the oven to cook. Once\nbaked, the pizza goes into a box (if it\u2019s for takeout) and the customer pays for the good. What are the inputs (or\nfactors of production) in the production process for this pizza?\nEconomists divide factors of production into several categories: 162 7 \u2022 Production, Costs, and Industry Structure\n\u2022 Natural Resources (Land and Raw Materials)- The ingredients for the pizza are raw materials. These\ninclude the flour, yeast, and water for the dough, the tomatoes, herbs, and water for the sauce, the cheese,\nand the toppings. If the pizza place uses a wood-burning oven, we would include the wood as a raw\nmaterial. If the establishment heats the oven with natural gas, we would count this as a raw material. Don\u2019t\nforget electricity for lights. If, instead of pizza, we were looking at an agricultural product, like wheat, we\nwould include the land the farmer used for crops here.\n\u2022 Labor\u2013 When we talk about production, labor means human effort, both physical and mental. The\npizzaiolo was the primary example of labor here. They need to be strong enough to roll out the dough and\nto insert and retrieve the pizza from the oven, but they also must knowhowto make the pizza, how long it\ncooks in the oven and a myriad of other aspects of pizza-making. The business may also have one or more\npeople to work the counter, take orders, and receive payment.\n\u2022 Capital\u2013 When economists uses the term capital, they do not mean financial capital (money); rather, they\nmean physical capital, the machines, equipment, and buildings that one uses to produce the product. In\nthe case of pizza, the capital includes the peel, the oven, the building, and any other necessary equipment\n(for example, tables and chairs).\n\u2022 Technology\u2013 Technology refers to the process or processes for producing the product. How does the\npizzaiolo combine ingredients to make pizza? How hot should the oven be? How long should the pizza\ncook? What is the best oven to use? Gas or wood burning? Should the restaurant make its own dough,\nsauce, cheese, toppings, or should it buy them?\n\u2022 Entrepreneurship\u2013 Production involves many decisions and much knowledge, even for something as\nsimple as pizza. Who makes those decisions? Ultimately, it is the entrepreneur, the person who creates the\nbusiness, whose idea it is to combine the inputs to produce the outputs.\nThe cost of producing pizza (or any output) depends on the amount of labor capital, raw materials, and other\ninputs required and the price of each input to the entrepreneur. Let\u2019s explore these ideas in more detail.\nWe can summarize the ideas so far in terms of aproduction function, a mathematical expression or equation\nthat explains the engineering relationship between inputs and outputs:\nThe production function gives the answer to the question, how much output can the firm produce given\ndifferent amounts of inputs? Production functions are specific to the product. Different products have different\nproduction functions. The amount of labor a farmer uses to produce a bushel of wheat is likely different than\nthat required to produce an automobile. Firms in the same industry may have somewhat different production\nfunctions, since each firm may produce a little differently. One pizza restaurant may make its own dough and\nsauce, while another may buy those pre-made. A sit-down pizza restaurant probably uses more labor (to\nhandle table service) than a purely take-out restaurant.\nWe can describe inputs as eitherfixedorvariable.\nFixed inputsare those that can\u2019t easily be increased or decreased in a short period of time. In the pizza\nexample, the building is a fixed input. The restaurant owner signs a lease and is stuck in the building until the\nlease expires. Fixed inputs define the firm\u2019s maximum output capacity. This is analogous to the potential real\nGDP shown by society\u2019s production possibilities curve, i.e., the maximum quantities of outputs a society can\nproduce at a given time with its available resources.\nVariable inputsare those that can easily be increased or decreased in a short period of time. The pizzaiolo can\norder more ingredients with a phone call, so ingredients would be variable inputs. The owner could hire a new\nperson to work the counter pretty quickly as well.\nEconomists often use a short-hand form for the production function:\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.2 \u2022 Production in the Short Run 163\nwhere L represents all the variable inputs, and K represents all the fixed inputs.\nEconomists differentiate between short and long run production.\nTheshort runis the period of time during which at least some factors of production are fixed. During the\nperiod of the pizza restaurant lease, the pizza restaurant is operating in the short run, because it is limited to\nusing the current building\u2014the owner can\u2019t choose a larger or smaller building.\nThelong runis the period of time during which all factors are variable. Once the lease expires for the pizza\nrestaurant, the shop owner can move to a larger or smaller place.\nLet\u2019s explore production in the short run using a specific example: tree cutting (for lumber) with a two-person\ncrosscut saw.\nFIGURE7.4Production in the short run may be explored through the example of lumberjacks using a two-person\nsaw. (Credit: \u201cDO - Apple Day Civilian Conservation Corps Demonstration Crosscut Saw (Gladden)\u201d by Virginia State\nParks/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nSince by definition capital is fixed in the short run, our production function becomes\nThis equation simply indicates that since capital is fixed, the amount of output (e.g., trees cut down per day)\ndepends only on the amount of labor employed (e.g., number of lumberjacks working). We can express this\nproduction function numerically asTable 7.2below shows.\n# Lumberjacks 1 2 3 4 5\n# Trees (TP) 4 10 12 13 13\nMP 4 6 2 1 0\nTABLE7.2Short Run Production\nFunction for Trees 164 7 \u2022 Production, Costs, and Industry Structure\nNote that we have introduced some new language. We also call Output (Q) Total Product (TP), which means the\namount of output produced with a given amount of labor and a fixed amount of capital. In this example, one\nlumberjack using a two-person saw can cut down four trees in an hour. Two lumberjacks using a two-person\nsaw can cut down ten trees in an hour.\nWe should also introduce a critical concept:marginal product. Marginal product is the additional output of\none more worker. Mathematically, Marginal Product is the change in total product divided by the change in\nlabor: . In the table above, since 0 workers produce 0 trees, the marginal product of the first\nworker is four trees per day, but the marginal product of the second worker is six trees per day. Why might that\nbe the case? It\u2019s because of the nature of the capital the workers are using. A two-person saw works much\nbetter with two persons than with one. Suppose we add a third lumberjack to the story. What will that person\u2019s\nmarginal product be? What will that person contribute to the team? Perhaps they can oil the saw's teeth to\nkeep it sawing smoothly or they could bring water to the two people sawing. What you see in the table is a\ncritically important conclusion about production in the short run: It may be that as we add workers, the\nmarginal product increases at first, but sooner or later additional workers will have decreasing marginal\nproduct. In fact, there may eventually be no effect or a negative effect on output. This is called theLaw of\nDiminishing Marginal Productand it\u2019s a characteristic of production in the short run. Diminishing marginal\nproductivity is very similar to the concept of diminishing marginal utility that we learned about in the chapter\non consumer choice. Both concepts are examples of the more general concept of diminishing marginal\nreturns. Why does diminishing marginal productivity occur? It\u2019s because of fixed capital. We will see this more\nclearly when we discuss production in the long run.\nWe can show these concepts graphically asFigure 7.5andFigure 7.6illustrate.Figure 7.5graphically shows\nthe data fromTable 7.2.Figure 7.6shows the more general cases of total product and marginal product curves.\nFIGURE7.5\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.3 \u2022 Costs in the Short Run 165\nFIGURE7.6\n7.3Costs in the Short Run\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Understand the relationship between production and costs\n\u2022 Understand that every factor of production has a corresponding factor price\n\u2022 Analyze short-run costs in terms of total cost, fixed cost, variable cost, marginal cost, and average cost\n\u2022 Calculate average profit\n\u2022 Evaluate patterns of costs to determine potential profit\nWe\u2019ve explained that a firm\u2019s total costs depend on the quantities of inputs the firm uses to produce its output\nand the cost of those inputs to the firm. The firm\u2019s production function tells us how much output the firm will\nproduce with given amounts of inputs. However, if we think about that backwards, it tells us how many inputs\nthe firm needs to produce a given quantity of output, which is the first thing we need to determine total cost.\nLet\u2019s move to the second factor we need to determine.\nFor every factor of production (or input), there is an associated factor payment.Factor paymentsare what the\nfirm pays for the use of the factors of production. From the firm\u2019s perspective, factor payments are costs. From\nthe owner of each factor\u2019s perspective, factor payments are income. Factor payments include:\n\u2022 Raw materials pricesfor raw materials\n\u2022 Rentfor land or buildings\n\u2022 Wages and salariesfor labor\n\u2022 Interest and dividendsfor the use of financial capital (loans and equity investments)\n\u2022 Profitfor entrepreneurship. Profit is the residual, what\u2019s left over from revenues after the firm pays all the\nother costs. While it may seem odd to treat profit as a \u201ccost\u201d, it is what entrepreneurs earn for taking the\nrisk of starting a business. You can see this correspondence between factors of production and factor\npayments in the inside loop of the circular flow diagram inFigure 1.7.\nWe now have all the information necessary to determine a firm\u2019s costs.\nA cost function is a mathematical expression or equation that shows the cost of producing different levels of\noutput.\nQ 1 2 3 4\nCost $32.50 $44 $52 $90\nTABLE7.3Cost Function for\nProducing Widgets 166 7 \u2022 Production, Costs, and Industry Structure\nWhat we observe is that the cost increases as the firm produces higher quantities of output. This is pretty\nintuitive, since producing more output requires greater quantities of inputs, which cost more dollars to\nacquire.\nWhat is the origin of these cost figures? They come from the production function and the factor payments. The\ndiscussion of costs in the short run above,Costs in the Short Run, was based on the following production\nfunction, which is similar toTable 7.3except for \"widgets\" instead of trees.\nWorkers (L) 1 2 3 3.25 4.4 5.2 6 7 8 9\nWidgets (Q) 0.2 0.4 0.8 1 2 3 3.5 3.8 3.95 4\nTABLE7.4\nWe can use the information from the production function to determine production costs. What we need to\nknow is how many workers are required to produce any quantity of output. If we flip the order of the rows, we\n\u201cinvert\u201d the production function so it shows .\nWidgets (Q) 0.2 0.4 0.8 1 2 3 3.5 3.8 3.95 4\nWorkers (L) 1 2 3 3.25 4.4 5.2 6 7 8 9\nTABLE7.5\nNow focus on the whole number quantities of output.

Multiplying the Workers row by $10 (and eliminating the\nblanks) gives us the cost of producing different levels of output.\nWidgets (Q) 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00\nWorkers (L) 3.25 4.4 5.2 9\n\u00d7 Wage Rate per hour $10 $10 $10 $10\n= Cost $32.50 $44.00 $52.00 $90.00\nTABLE7.7\nThis is same cost function with which we began! (shown inTable 7.3)\nNow that we have the basic idea of the cost origins and how they are related to production, let\u2019s drill down into\nthe details.\nAverage and Marginal Costs\nThe cost of producing a firm\u2019s output depends on how much labor and physical capital the firm uses. A list of\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.3 \u2022 Costs in the Short Run 167\nthe costs involved in producing cars will look very different from the costs involved in producing computer\nsoftware or haircuts or fast-food meals.\nWe can measure costs in a variety of ways. Each way provides its own insight into costs. Sometimes firms need\nto look at their cost per unit of output, not just their total cost. There are two ways to measure per unit costs.\nThe most intuitive way is average cost. Average cost is the cost on average of producing a given quantity. We\ndefineaverage costas total cost divided by the quantity of output produced. If producing two\nwidgets costs a total of $44, the average cost per widget is per widget. The other way of measuring\ncost per unit is marginal cost. If average cost is the cost of the average unit of output produced, marginal cost is\nthe cost of each individual unit produced. More formally, marginal cost is the cost of producing one more unit\nof output. Mathematically,marginal costis the change in total cost divided by the change in output:\n. If the cost of the first widget is $32.50 and the cost of two widgets is $44, the marginal cost of\nthe second widget is We can see the Widget Cost table redrawn below with average and\nmarginal cost added.\nQ 1 2 3 4\nTotal Cost $32.50 $44.00 $52.00 $90.00\nAverage Cost $32.50 $22.00 $17.33 $22.50\nMarginal Cost $32.50 $11.50 $8.00 $38.00\nTABLE7.8Extended Cost Function for Producing\nWidgets\nNote that the marginal cost of the first unit of output is always the same as total cost.\nFixed and Variable Costs\nWe can decompose costs into fixed and variable costs. Fixed costs are the costs of the fixed inputs (e.g., capital).\nBecause fixed inputs do not change in the short run, fixed costs are expenditures that do not change regardless\nof the level of production. Whether you produce a great deal or a little, the fixed costs are the same. One\nexample is the rent on a factory or a retail space. Once you sign the lease, the rent is the same regardless of\nhow much you produce, at least until the lease expires. Fixed costs can take many other forms: for example,\nthe cost of machinery or equipment to produce the product, research and development costs to develop new\nproducts, even an expense like advertising to popularize a brand name. The amount of fixed costs varies\naccording to the specific line of business: for instance, manufacturing computer chips requires an expensive\nfactory, but a local moving and hauling business can get by with almost no fixed costs at all if it rents trucks by\nthe day when needed.\nVariable costsare the costs of the variable inputs (e.g., labor). The only way to increase or decrease output is\nby increasing or decreasing the variable inputs. Therefore, variable costs increase or decrease with output. We\ntreat labor as a variable cost, since producing a greater quantity of a good or service typically requires more\nworkers or more work hours. Variable costs would also include raw materials.\nTotal costs are the sum of fixed plus variable costs. Let's look at another example. Consider the barber shop\ncalled \u201cThe Clip Joint\u201d inFigure 7.7. The data for output and costs are inTable 7.9. The fixed costs of operating\nthe barber shop, including the space and equipment, are $160 per day. The variable costs are the costs of\nhiring barbers, which in our example is $80 per barber each day. The first two columns of the table show the\nquantity of haircuts the barbershop can produce as it hires additional barbers. The third column shows the\nfixed costs, which do not change regardless of the level of production. The fourth column shows the variable\ncosts at each level of output. We calculate these by taking the amount of labor hired and multiplying by the 168 7 \u2022 Production, Costs, and Industry Structure\nwage. For example, two barbers cost: 2 \u00d7 $80 = $160. Adding together the fixed costs in the third column and\nthe variable costs in the fourth column produces the total costs in the fifth column. For example, with two\nbarbers the total cost is: $160 + $160 = $320.\nLabor Quantity Fixed Cost Variable Cost Total Cost\n1 16 $160 $80 $240\n2 40 $160 $160 $320\n3 60 $160 $240 $400\n4 72 $160 $320 $480\n5 80 $160 $400 $560\n6 84 $160 $480 $640\n7 82 $160 $560 $720\nTABLE7.9Output and Total Costs\nFIGURE7.7How Output Affects Total CostsAt zero production, the fixed costs of $160 are still present. As\nproduction increases, variable costs are added to fixed costs, and the total cost is the sum of the two.\nAt zero production, the fixed costs of $160 are still present. As production increases, we add variable costs to\nfixed costs, and the total cost is the sum of the two.Figure 7.7graphically shows the relationship between the\nquantity of output produced and the cost of producing that output. We always show the fixed costs as the\nvertical intercept of the total cost curve; that is, they are the costs incurred when output is zero so there are no\nvariable costs.\nYou can see from the graph that once production starts, total costs and variable costs rise. While variable costs\nmay initially increase at a decreasing rate, at some point they begin increasing at an increasing rate. This is\ncaused by diminishing marginal productivity which we discussed earlier in theProduction in the Short Run\nsection of this chapter, which is easiest to see with an example. As the number of barbers increases from zero\nto one in the table, output increases from 0 to 16 for a marginal gain (or marginal product) of 16. As the\nnumber rises from one to two barbers, output increases from 16 to 40, a marginal gain of 24. From that point\non, though, the marginal product diminishes as we add each additional barber. For example, as the number of\nbarbers rises from two to three, the marginal product is only 20; and as the number rises from three to four,\nthe marginal product is only 12.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.3 \u2022 Costs in the Short Run 169\nTo understand the reason behind this pattern, consider that a one-man barber shop is a very busy operation.\nThe single barber needs to do everything: say hello to people entering, answer the phone, cut hair, sweep, and\nrun the cash register. A second barber reduces the level of disruption from jumping back and forth between\nthese tasks, and allows a greater division of labor and specialization. The result can be increasing marginal\nproductivity. However, as the shop adds other barbers, the advantage of each additional barber is less, since\nthe specialization of labor can only go so far. The addition of a sixth or seventh or eighth barber just to greet\npeople at the door will have less impact than the second one did. This is the pattern of diminishing marginal\nproductivity. As a result, the total costs of production will begin to rise more rapidly as output increases. At\nsome point, you may even see negative returns as the additional barbers begin bumping elbows and getting in\neach other\u2019s way. In this case, the addition of still more barbers would actually cause output to decrease, as the\nlast row ofTable 7.9shows.\nThis pattern ofdiminishing marginal productivityis common in production. As another example, consider the\nproblem of irrigating a crop on a farmer\u2019s field. The plot of land is the fixed factor of production, while the\nwater that the farmer can add to the land is the key variable cost. As the farmer adds water to the land, output\nincreases. However, adding increasingly more water brings smaller increases in output, until at some point the\nwater floods the field and actually reduces output. Diminishing marginal productivity occurs because, with\nfixed inputs (land in this example), each additional unit of input (e.g., water) contributes less to overall\nproduction.\nAverage Total Cost, Average Variable Cost, Marginal Cost\nThe breakdown of total costs into fixed and variable costs can provide a basis for other insights as well. The\nfirst five columns ofTable 7.10duplicate the previous table, but the last three columns show average total\ncosts, average variable costs, and marginal costs. These new measures analyze costs on a per-unit (rather than\na total) basis and are reflected in the curves inFigure 7.8.\nFIGURE7.8Cost Curves at the Clip JointWe can also present the information on total costs, fixed cost, and variable\ncost on a per-unit basis. We calculate average total cost (ATC) by dividing total cost by the total quantity produced.\nThe average total cost curve is typically U-shaped. We calculate average variable cost (AVC) by dividing variable cost\nby the quantity produced. The average variable cost curve lies below the average total cost curve and is also\ntypically U-shaped. We calculate marginal cost (MC) by taking the change in total cost between two levels of output\nand dividing by the change in output. The marginal cost curve is upward-sloping. 170 7 \u2022 Production, Costs, and Industry Structure\nFixed Variable Total Marginal Average Total Average Variable\nLabor Quantity\nCost Cost Cost Cost Cost Cost\n1 16 $160 $80 $240 $15.00 $15.00 $5.00\n2 40 $160 $160 $320 $3.33 $8.00 $4.00\n3 60 $160 $240 $400 $4.00 $6.67 $4.00\n4 72 $160 $320 $480 $6.67 $6.67 $4.44\n5 80 $160 $400 $560 $10.00 $7.00 $5.00\n6 84 $160 $480 $640 $20.00 $7.62 $5.71\nTABLE7.10Different Types of Costs\nAverage total cost(sometimes referred to simply as average cost) is total cost divided by the quantity of\noutput. Since the total cost of producing 40 haircuts is $320, the average total cost for producing each of 40\nhaircuts is $320/40, or $8 per haircut. Average cost curves are typically U-shaped, asFigure 7.8shows.\nAverage total cost starts off relatively high, because at low levels of output total costs are dominated by the\nfixed cost. Mathematically, the denominator is so small that average total cost is large. Average total cost then\ndeclines, as the fixed costs are spread over an increasing quantity of output. In the average cost calculation, the\nrise in the numerator of total costs is relatively small compared to the rise in the denominator of quantity\nproduced. However, as output expands still further, the average cost begins to rise. At the right side of the\naverage cost curve, total costs begin rising more rapidly as diminishing returns come into effect.\nWe obtainaverage variable costwhen we divide variable cost by quantity of output. For example, the variable\ncost of producing 80 haircuts is $400, so the average variable cost is $400/80, or $5 per haircut. Note that at\nany level of output, the average variable cost curve will always lie below the curve for average total cost, as\nFigure 7.8shows. The reason is that average total cost includes average variable cost and average fixed cost.\nThus, for Q = 80 haircuts, the average total cost is $8 per haircut, while the average variable cost is $5 per\nhaircut. However, as output grows, fixed costs become relatively less important (since they do not rise with\noutput), so average variable cost sneaks closer to average cost.\nAverage total and variable costs measure the average costs of producing some quantity of output. Marginal cost\nis somewhat different.Marginal costis the additional cost of producing one more unit of output. It is not the\ncost per unit ofallunits produced, but only the next one (or next few). We calculate marginal cost by taking the\nchange in total cost and dividing it by the change in quantity. For example, as quantity produced increases\nfrom 40 to 60 haircuts, total costs rise by 400 \u2013 320, or 80. Thus, the marginal cost for each of those marginal\n20 units will be 80/20, or $4 per haircut. The marginal cost curve is generally upward-sloping, because\ndiminishing marginal returns implies that additional units are more costly to produce. We can see small range\nof increasing marginal returns in the figure as a dip in the marginal cost curve before it starts rising. There is a\npoint at which marginal and average costs meet, as the following Clear it Up feature discusses.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhere do marginal and average costs meet?\nThe marginal cost line intersects the average cost line exactly at the bottom of the average cost curve\u2014which occurs\nat a quantity of 72 and cost of $6.60 inFigure 7.8. The reason why the intersection occurs at this point is built into\nthe economic meaning of marginal and average costs. If the marginal cost of production is below the average cost\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.3 \u2022 Costs in the Short Run 171\nfor producing previous units, as it is for the points to the left of where MC crosses ATC, then producing one more\nadditional unit will reduce average costs overall\u2014and the ATC curve will be downward-sloping in this zone.\nConversely, if the marginal cost of production for producing an additional unit is above the average cost for\nproducing the earlier units, as it is for points to the right of where MC crosses ATC, then producing a marginal unit\nwill increase average costs overall\u2014and the ATC curve must be upward-sloping in this zone. The point of transition,\nbetween where MC is pulling ATC down and where it is pulling it up, must occur at the minimum point of the ATC\ncurve.\nThis idea of the marginal cost \u201cpulling down\u201d the average cost or \u201cpulling up\u201d the average cost may sound abstract,\nbut think about it in terms of your own grades. If the score on the most recent quiz you take is lower than your\naverage score on previous quizzes, then the marginal quiz pulls down your average. If your score on the most recent\nquiz is higher than the average on previous quizzes, the marginal quiz pulls up your average. In this same way, low\nmarginal costs of production first pull down average costs and then higher marginal costs pull them up.\nThe numerical calculations behind average cost, average variable cost, and marginal cost will change from\nfirm to firm. However, the general patterns of these curves, and the relationships and economic intuition\nbehind them, will not change.\nLessons from Alternative Measures of Costs\nBreaking down total costs into fixed cost, marginal cost, average total cost, and average variable cost is useful\nbecause each statistic offers its own insights for the firm.\nWhatever the firm\u2019s quantity of production, total revenue must exceed total costs if it is to earn a profit. As\nexplored in the chapterChoice in a World of Scarcity, fixed costs are oftensunk coststhat a firm cannot\nrecoup. In thinking about what to do next, typically you should ignore sunk costs, since you have already spent\nthis money and cannot make any changes. However, you can change variable costs, so they convey information\nabout the firm\u2019s ability to cut costs in the present and the extent to which costs will increase if production rises.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhy are total cost and average cost not on the same graph?\nTotal cost, fixed cost, and variable cost each reflect different aspects of the cost of production over the entire\nquantity of output produced. We measure these costs in dollars. In contrast, marginal cost, average cost, and\naverage variable cost are costs per unit. In the previous example, we measured them as dollars per haircut. Thus, it\nwould not make sense to put all of these numbers on the same graph, since we measure them in different units ($\nversus $ per unit of output).\nIt would be as if the vertical axis measured two different things. In addition, as a practical matter, if they were on the\nsame graph, the lines for marginal cost, average cost, and average variable cost would appear almost flat against the\nhorizontal axis, compared to the values for total cost, fixed cost, and variable cost. Using the figures from the\nprevious example, the total cost of producing 40 haircuts is $320. However, the average cost is $320/40, or $8. If\nyou graphed both total and average cost on the same axes, the average cost would hardly show.\nAverage cost tells a firm whether it can earn profits given the current price in the market. If we divide profit by\nthe quantity of output produced we getaverage profit, also known as the firm\u2019sprofit margin. Expanding the\nequation for profit gives: 172 7 \u2022 Production, Costs, and Industry Structure\nHowever, note that:\nThus:\nThis is the firm\u2019sprofit margin. This definition implies that if the market price is above average cost, average\nprofit, and thus total profit, will be positive. If price is below average cost, then profits will be negative.\nWe can compare this marginal cost of producing an additional unit with the marginal revenue gained by\nselling that additional unit to reveal whether the additional unit is adding to total profit\u2014or not. Thus, marginal\ncost helps producers understand how increasing or decreasing production affects profits.\nA Variety of Cost Patterns\nThe pattern of costs varies among industries and even among firms in the same industry. Some businesses\nhave high fixed costs, but low marginal costs. Consider, for example, an internet company that provides\nmedical advice to customers. Consumers might pay such a company directly, or perhaps hospitals or\nhealthcare practices might subscribe on behalf of their patients. Setting up the website, collecting the\ninformation, writing the content, and buying or leasing the computer space to handle the web traffic are all\nfixed costs that the company must undertake before the site can work. However, when the website is up and\nrunning, it can provide a high quantity of service with relatively low variable costs, like the cost of monitoring\nthe system and updating the information. In this case, the total cost curve might start at a high level, because of\nthe high fixed costs, but then might appear close to flat, up to a large quantity of output, reflecting the low\nvariable costs of operation. If the website is popular, however, a large rise in the number of visitors will\noverwhelm the website, and increasing output further could require a purchase of additional computer space.\nFor other firms, fixed costs may be relatively low. For example, consider firms that rake leaves in the fall or\nshovel snow off sidewalks and driveways in the winter. For fixed costs, such firms may need little more than a\ncar to transport workers to homes of customers and some rakes and shovels. Still other firms may find that\ndiminishing marginal returns set in quite sharply. If a manufacturing plant tried to run 24 hours a day, seven\ndays a week, little time remains for routine equipment maintenance, and marginal costs can increase\ndramatically as the firm struggles to repair and replace overworked equipment.\nEvery firm can gain insight into its task of earning profits by dividing its total costs into fixed and variable\ncosts, and then using these calculations as a basis for average total cost, average variable cost, and marginal\ncost. However, making a final decision about the profit-maximizing quantity to produce and the price to charge\nwill require combining these perspectives on cost with an analysis of sales and revenue, which in turn requires\nlooking at the market structure in which the firm finds itself. Before we turn to the analysis of market structure\nin other chapters, we will analyze the firm\u2019s cost structure from a long-run perspective.\n7.4Production in the Long Run\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Understand how long run production differs from short run production.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.4 \u2022 Production in the Long Run 173\nIn the long run, all factors (including capital) are variable, so our production function is .\nConsider a secretarial firm that does typing for hire using typists for labor and personal computers for capital.\nTo start, the firm has just enough business for one typist and one PC to keep busy for a day. Say that\u2019s five\ndocuments. Now suppose the firm receives a rush order from a good customer for 10 documents tomorrow.\nIdeally, the firm would like to use two typists and two PCs to produce twice their normal output of five\ndocuments. However, in the short turn, the firm has fixed capital, i.e. only one PC. The table below shows the\nsituation:\n# Typists (L) 1 2 3 4 5 6\nLetters/hr (TP) 5 7 8 8 8 8 For K = 1PC\nMP 5 2 1 0 0 0\nTABLE7.11Short Run Production Function for\nTyping\nIn the short run, the only variable factor is labor so the only way the firm can produce more output is by hiring\nadditional workers. What could the second worker do? What can they contribute to the firm? Perhaps they can\nanswer the phone, which is a major impediment to completing the typing assignment. What about a third\nworker? Perhaps the third worker could bring coffee to the first two workers. You can see both total product\nand marginal product for the firm above. Now here\u2019s something to think about: At what point (e.g., after how\nmany workers) does diminishing marginal productivity kick in, and more importantly, why?\nIn this example, marginal productivity starts to decline after the second worker. This is because capital is fixed.\nThe production process for typing works best with one worker and one PC. If you add more than one typist, you\nget seriously diminishing marginal productivity.\nConsider the long run. Suppose the firm\u2019s demand increases to 15 documents per day. What might the firm do\nto operate more efficiently? If demand has tripled, the firm could acquire two more PCs, which would give us a\nnew short run production function asTable 7.12below shows.\n# Typists (L) 1 2 3 4 5 5\nLetters/hr (TP) 5 6 8 8 8 8 For K = 1PC\nMP 5 2 1 0 0 0\nLetters/hr (TP) 5 10 15 17 18 18 For K = 3PC\nMP 5 5 5 2 1 0\nTABLE7.12Long Run Production Function for Typing\nWith more capital, the firm can hire three workers before diminishing productivity comes into effect. More\ngenerally, because all factors are variable, the long run production function shows the most efficient way of\nproducing any level of output. 174 7 \u2022 Production, Costs, and Industry Structure\n7.5Costs in the Long Run\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Calculate long run total cost\n\u2022 Identify economies of scale, diseconomies of scale, and constant returns to scale\n\u2022 Interpret graphs of long-run average cost curves and short-run average cost curves\n\u2022 Analyze cost and production in the long run and short run\nThe long run is the period of time when all costs are variable. The long run depends on the specifics of the firm\nin question\u2014it is not a precise period of time. If you have a one-year lease on your factory, then the long run is\nany period longer than a year, since after a year you are no longer bound by the lease. No costs are fixed in the\nlong run. A firm can build new factories and purchase new machinery, or it can close existing facilities. In\nplanning for the long run, the firm will compare alternativeproduction technologies(or processes).\nIn this context, technology refers to all alternative methods of combining inputs to produce outputs. It does not\nrefer to a specific new invention like the tablet computer. The firm will search for the production technology\nthat allows it to produce the desired level of output at the lowest cost. After all, lower costs lead to higher\nprofits\u2014at least if total revenues remain unchanged. Moreover, each firm must fear that if it does not seek out\nthe lowest-cost methods of production, then it may lose sales to competitor firms that find a way to produce\nand sell for less.\nChoice of Production Technology\nA firm can perform many tasks with a range of combinations of labor and physical capital. For example, a firm\ncan have human beings answering phones and taking messages, or it can invest in an automated voicemail\nsystem. A firm can hire file clerks and secretaries to manage a system of paper folders and file cabinets, or it\ncan invest in a computerized recordkeeping system that will require fewer employees. A firm can hire workers\nto push supplies around a factory on rolling carts, it can invest in motorized vehicles, or it can invest in robots\nthat carry materials without a driver. Firms often face a choice between buying a many small machines, which\nneed a worker to run each one, or buying one larger and more expensive machine, which requires only one or\ntwo workers to operate it. In short, physical capital and labor can often substitute for each other.\nConsider the example of local governments hiring a private firm to clean up public parks. Three different\ncombinations of labor and physical capital for cleaning up a single average-sized park appear inTable 7.13.\nThe first production technology is heavy on workers and light on machines, while the next two technologies\nsubstitute machines for workers. Since all three of these production methods produce the same thing\u2014one\ncleaned-up park\u2014a profit-seeking firm will choose the production technology that is least expensive, given the\nprices of labor and machines.\nProduction technology 1 10 workers 2 machines\nProduction technology 2 7 workers 4 machines\nProduction technology 3 3 workers 7 machines\nTABLE7.13Three Ways to Clean a Park\nProduction technology 1 uses the most labor and least machinery, while production technology 3 uses the least\nlabor and the most machinery.Table 7.14outlines three examples of how the total cost will change with each\nproduction technology as the cost of labor changes. As the cost of labor rises from example A to B to C, the firm\nwill choose to substitute away from labor and use more machinery.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.5 \u2022 Costs in the Long Run 175\nExample A: Workers cost $40, machines cost $80\nLabor Cost Machine Cost Total Cost\nCost of technology 1 10 \u00d7 $40 = $400 2 \u00d7 $80 = $160 $560\nCost of technology 2 7 \u00d7 $40 = $280 4 \u00d7 $80 = $320 $600\nCost of technology 3 3 \u00d7 $40 = $120 7 \u00d7 $80 = $560 $680\nExample B: Workers cost $55, machines cost $80\nLabor Cost Machine Cost Total Cost\nCost of technology 1 10 \u00d7 $55 = $550 2 \u00d7 $80 = $160 $710\nCost of technology 2 7 \u00d7 $55 = $385 4 \u00d7 $80 = $320 $705\nCost of technology 3 3 \u00d7 $55 = $165 7 \u00d7 $80 = $560 $725\nExample C: Workers cost $90, machines cost $80\nLabor Cost Machine Cost Total Cost\nCost of technology 1 10 \u00d7 $90 = $900 2 \u00d7 $80 = $160 $1,060\nCost of technology 2 7 \u00d7 $90 = $630 4 \u00d7 $80 = $320 $950\nCost of technology 3 3 \u00d7 $90 = $270 7 \u00d7 $80 = $560 $830\nTABLE7.14Total Cost with Rising Labor Costs\nExample A shows the firm\u2019s cost calculation when wages are $40 and machines costs are $80. In this case,\ntechnology 1 is the low-cost production technology. In example B, wages rise to $55, while the cost of machines\ndoes not change, in which case technology 2 is the low-cost production technology. If wages keep rising up to\n$90, while the cost of machines remains unchanged, then technology 3 clearly becomes the low-cost form of\nproduction, as example C shows.\nThis example shows that as an input becomes more expensive (in this case, the labor input), firms will attempt\nto conserve on using that input and will instead shift to other inputs that are relatively less expensive. This\npattern helps to explain why the demand curve for labor (or any input) slopes down; that is, as labor becomes\nrelatively more expensive, profit-seeking firms will seek to substitute the use of other inputs. When a\nmultinational employer like Coca-Cola or McDonald\u2019s sets up a bottling plant or a restaurant in a high-wage\neconomy like the United States, Canada, Japan, or Western Europe, it is likely to use production technologies\nthat conserve on the number of workers and focuses more on machines. However, that same employer is likely\nto use production technologies with more workers and less machinery when producing in a lower-wage\ncountry like Mexico, China, or South Africa.\nEconomies of Scale\nOnce a firm has determined the least costly production technology, it can consider the optimal scale of\nproduction, or quantity of output to produce. Many industries experience economies of scale.Economies of\nscalerefers to the situation where, as the quantity of output goes up, the cost per unit goes down. This is the\nidea behind \u201cwarehouse stores\u201d like Costco or Walmart. In everyday language: a larger factory can produce at a\nlower average cost than a smaller factory. 176 7 \u2022 Production, Costs, and Industry Structure\nFigure 7.9illustrates the idea of economies of scale, showing the average cost of producing an alarm clock\nfalling as the quantity of output rises. For a small-sized factory like S, with an output level of 1,000, the average\ncost of production is $12 per alarm clock. For a medium-sized factory like M, with an output level of 2,000, the\naverage cost of production falls to $8 per alarm clock. For a large factory like L, with an output of 5,000, the\naverage cost of production declines still further to $4 per alarm clock.\nFIGURE7.9Economies of ScaleA small factory like S produces 1,000 alarm clocks at an average cost of $12 per\nclock. A medium factory like M produces 2,000 alarm clocks at a cost of $8 per clock. A large factory like L produces\n5,000 alarm clocks at a cost of $4 per clock. Economies of scale exist when the larger scale of production leads to\nlower average costs.\nThe average cost curve inFigure 7.9may appear similar to the average cost curves we presented earlier in this\nchapter, although it is downward-sloping rather than U-shaped. However, there is one major difference. The\neconomies of scale curve is a long-run average cost curve, because it allows all factors of production to change.\nThe short-run average cost curves we presented earlier in this chapter assumed the existence of fixed costs,\nand only variable costs were allowed to change.\nOne prominent example of economies of scale occurs in the chemical industry. Chemical plants have many\npipes. The cost of the materials for producing a pipe is related to the circumference of the pipe and its length.\nHowever, the cross-section area of the pipe determines the volume of chemicals that can flow through it. The\ncalculations inTable 7.15show that a pipe which uses twice as much material to make (as shown by the\ncircumference) can actually carry four times the volume of chemicals because the pipe's cross-section area\nrises by a factor of four (as the Area column below shows).\nCircumference ( ) Area ( )\n4-inch pipe 12.5 inches 12.5 square inches\n8-inch pipe 25.1 inches 50.2 square inches\n16-inch pipe 50.2 inches 201.1 square inches\nTABLE7.15Comparing Pipes: Economies of Scale in the\nChemical Industry\nA doubling of the cost of producing the pipe allows the chemical firm to process four times as much material.\nThis pattern is a major reason for economies of scale in chemical production, which uses a large quantity of\npipes. Of course, economies of scale in a chemical plant are more complex than this simple calculation\nsuggests. However, the chemical engineers who design these plants have long used what they call the \u201csix-\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.5 \u2022 Costs in the Long Run 177\ntenths rule,\u201d a rule of thumb which holds that increasing the quantity produced in a chemical plant by a\ncertain percentage will increase total cost by only six-tenths as much.\nShapes of Long-Run Average Cost Curves\nWhile in the short run firms are limited to operating on a single average cost curve (corresponding to the level\nof fixed costs they have chosen), in the long run when all costs are variable, they can choose to operate on any\naverage cost curve. Thus, thelong-run average cost (LRAC) curveis actually based on a group ofshort-run\naverage cost (SRAC) curves, each of which represents one specific level of fixed costs. More precisely, the\nlong-run average cost curve will be the least expensive average cost curve for any level of output.Figure 7.10\nshows how we build the long-run average cost curve from a group of short-run average cost curves. Five short-\nrun-average cost curves appear on the diagram. Each SRAC curve represents a different level of fixed costs. For\nexample, you can imagine SRAC as a small factory, SRAC as a medium factory, SRAC as a large factory, and\n1 2 3\nSRAC and SRAC as very large and ultra-large. Although this diagram shows only five SRAC curves,\n4 5\npresumably there are an infinite number of other SRAC curves between the ones that we show. Think of this\nfamily of short-run average cost curves as representing different choices for a firm that is planning its level of\ninvestment in fixed cost physical capital\u2014knowing that different choices about capital investment in the\npresent will cause it to end up with different short-run average cost curves in the future.\nFIGURE7.10From Short-Run Average Cost Curves to Long-Run Average Cost CurvesThe five different short-run\naverage cost (SRAC) curves each represents a different level of fixed costs, from the low level of fixed costs at\nSRAC to the high level of fixed costs at SRAC . Other SRAC curves, not in the diagram, lie between the ones that are\n1 5\nhere. The long-run average cost (LRAC) curve shows the lowest cost for producing each quantity of output when\nfixed costs can vary, and so it is formed by the bottom edge of the family of SRAC curves. If a firm wished to produce\nquantity Q , it would choose the fixed costs associated with SRAC .\n3 3\nThe long-run average cost curve shows the cost of producing each quantity in the long run, when the firm can\nchoose its level of fixed costs and thus choose which short-run average costs it desires. If the firm plans to\nproduce in the long run at an output of Q , it should make the set of investments that will lead it to locate on\n3\nSRAC , which allows producing q at the lowest cost. A firm that intends to produce Q would be foolish to\n3 3 3\nchoose the level of fixed costs at SRAC or SRAC . At SRAC the level of fixed costs is too low for producing Q at\n2 4 2 3\nlowest possible cost, and producing q would require adding a very high level of variable costs and make the\n3\naverage cost very high. At SRAC , the level of fixed costs is too high for producing q at lowest possible cost, and\n4 3\nagain average costs would be very high as a result.\nThe shape of the long-run cost curve, inFigure 7.10, is fairly common for many industries. The left-hand\nportion of the long-run average cost curve, where it is downward- sloping from output levels Q to Q to Q ,\n1 2 3\nillustrates the case of economies of scale. In this portion of the long-run average cost curve, larger scale leads 178 7 \u2022 Production, Costs, and Industry Structure\nto lower average costs. We illustrated this pattern earlier inFigure 7.9.\nIn the middle portion of the long-run average cost curve, the flat portion of the curve around Q , economies of\n3\nscale have been exhausted. In this situation, allowing all inputs to expand does not much change the average\ncost of production. We call thisconstant returns to scale. In this LRAC curve range, the average cost of\nproduction does not change much as scale rises or falls. The following Clear It Up feature explains where\ndiminishing marginal returns fit into this analysis.\nCLEAR IT UP\nHow do economies of scale compare to diminishing marginal returns?\nThe concept of economies of scale, where average costs decline as production expands, might seem to conflict with\nthe idea of diminishing marginal returns, where marginal costs rise as production expands. However, diminishing\nmarginal returns refers only to the short-run average cost curve, where one variable input (like labor) is increasing,\nbut other inputs (like capital) are fixed. Economies of scale refers to the long-run average cost curve where all inputs\nare allowed to increase together. Thus, it is quite possible and common to have an industry that has both\ndiminishing marginal returns when only one input is allowed to change, and at the same time has economies of\nscale when all inputs change together to produce a larger-scale operation.\nFinally, the right-hand portion of the long-run average cost curve, running from output level Q to Q , shows a\n4 5\nsituation where, as the level of output and the scale rises, average costs rise as well. We call this situation\ndiseconomies of scale. A firm or a factory can grow so large that it becomes very difficult to manage, resulting\nin unnecessarily high costs as many layers of management try to communicate with workers and with each\nother, and as failures to communicate lead to disruptions in the flow of work and materials. Not many overly\nlarge factories exist in the real world, because with their very high production costs, they are unable to\ncompete for long against plants with lower average costs of production. However, in some planned economies,\nlike the economy of the old Soviet Union, plants that were so large as to be grossly inefficient were able to\ncontinue operating for a long time because government economic planners protected them from competition\nand ensured that they would not make losses.\nDiseconomies of scale can also be present across an entire firm, not just a large factory. Theleviathan effect\ncan hit firms that become too large to run efficiently, across the entirety of the enterprise. Firms that shrink\ntheir operations are often responding to finding itself in the diseconomies region, thus moving back to a lower\naverage cost at a lower output level.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/Toobig)to read an article about the complexity of the belief that banks\ncan be \u201ctoo-big-to-fail.\u201d\nThe Size and Number of Firms in an Industry\nThe shape of the long-run average cost curve has implications for how many firms will compete in an industry,\nand whether the firms in an industry have many different sizes, or tend to be the same size. For example, say\nthat the appliance industry sells one million dishwashers every year at a price of $500 each and the long-run\naverage cost curve for dishwashers is inFigure 7.11(a). InFigure 7.11(a), the lowest point of the LRAC curve\noccurs at a quantity of 10,000 produced. Thus, the market for dishwashers will consist of 100 different\nmanufacturing plants of this same size. If some firms built a plant that produced 5,000 dishwashers per year\nor 25,000 dishwashers per year, the average costs of production at such plants would be well above $500, and\nthe firms would not be able to compete.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.5 \u2022 Costs in the Long Run 179\nFIGURE7.11The LRAC Curve and the Size and Number of Firms(a) Low-cost firms will produce at output level R.\nWhen the LRAC curve has a clear minimum point, then any firm producing a different quantity will have higher costs.\nIn this case, a firm producing at a quantity of 10,000 will produce at a lower average cost than a firm producing, say,\n5,000 or 20,000 units. (b) Low-cost firms will produce between output levels R and S. When the LRAC curve has a\nflat bottom, then firms producing at any quantity along this flat bottom can compete. In this case, any firm\nproducing a quantity between 5,000 and 20,000 can compete effectively, although firms producing less than 5,000\nor more than 20,000 would face higher average costs and be unable to compete.\nCLEAR IT UP\nHow can we view cities as examples of economies of scale?\nWhy are people and economic activity concentrated in cities, rather than distributed evenly across a country? The\nfundamental reason must be related to the idea of economies of scale\u2014that grouping economic activity is more\nproductive in many cases than spreading it out. For example, cities provide a large group of nearby customers, so\nthat businesses can produce at an efficient economy of scale. They also provide a large group of workers and\nsuppliers, so that business can hire easily and purchase whatever specialized inputs they need. Many of the\nattractions of cities, like sports stadiums and museums, can operate only if they can draw on a large nearby\npopulation base. Cities are big enough to offer a wide variety of products, which is what appeals to many shoppers.\nThese factors are not exactly economies of scale in the narrow sense of the production function of a single firm, but\nthey are related to growth in the overall size of population and market in an area. Cities are sometimes called\n\u201cagglomeration economies.\u201d\nThese agglomeration factors help to explain why every economy, as it develops, has an increasing proportion of its\npopulation living in urban areas. In the United States, about 80% of the population now lives in metropolitan areas\n(which include the suburbs around cities), compared to just 40% in 1900. However, in poorer nations of the world,\nincluding much of Africa, the proportion of the population in urban areas is only about 30%. One of the great\nchallenges for these countries as their economies grow will be to manage the growth of the great cities that will\narise.\nIf cities offer economic advantages that are a form of economies of scale, then why don\u2019t all or most people live in\none giant city? At some point, agglomeration economies must turn into diseconomies. For example, traffic\ncongestion may reach a point where the gains from being geographically nearby are counterbalanced by how long it\ntakes to travel. High densities of people, cars, and factories can mean more garbage and air and water pollution.\nFacilities like parks or museums may become overcrowded. There may be economies of scale for negative activities\nlike crime, because high densities of people and businesses, combined with the greater impersonality of cities,\nmake it easier for illegal activities as well as legal ones. The future of cities, both in the United States and in other 180 7 \u2022 Production, Costs, and Industry Structure\ncountries around the world, will be determined by their ability to benefit from the economies of agglomeration and\nto minimize or counterbalance the corresponding diseconomies.\nWe illustrate a more common case inFigure 7.11(b), where the LRAC curve has a flat-bottomed area of\nconstant returns to scale. In this situation, any firm with a level of output between 5,000 and 20,000 will be\nable to produce at about the same level of average cost. Given that the market will demand one million\ndishwashers per year at a price of $500, this market might have as many as 200 producers (that is, one million\ndishwashers divided by firms making 5,000 each) or as few as 50 producers (one million dishwashers divided\nby firms making 20,000 each). The producers in this market will range in size from firms that make 5,000\nunits to firms that make 20,000 units. However, firms that produce below 5,000 units or more than 20,000 will\nbe unable to compete, because their average costs will be too high. Thus, if we see an industry where almost all\nplants are the same size, it is likely that the long-run average cost curve has a unique bottom point as inFigure\n7.11(a). However, if the long-run average cost curve has a wide flat bottom likeFigure 7.11(b), then firms of a\nvariety of different sizes will be able to compete with each other.\nWe can interpret the flat section of the long-run average cost curve inFigure 7.11(b) in two different ways. One\ninterpretation is that a single manufacturing plant producing a quantity of 5,000 has the same average costs as\na single manufacturing plant with four times as much capacity that produces a quantity of 20,000. The other\ninterpretation is that one firm owns a single manufacturing plant that produces a quantity of 5,000, while\nanother firm owns four separate manufacturing plants, which each produce a quantity of 5,000. This second\nexplanation, based on the insight that a single firm may own a number of different manufacturing plants, is\nespecially useful in explaining why the long-run average cost curve often has a large flat segment\u2014and thus\nwhy a seemingly smaller firm may be able to compete quite well with a larger firm. At some point, however, the\ntask of coordinating and managing many different plants raises the cost of production sharply, and the long-\nrun average cost curve slopes up as a result.\nIn the examples to this point, the quantity demanded in the market is quite large (one million) compared with\nthe quantity produced at the bottom of the long-run average cost curve (5,000, 10,000 or 20,000). In such a\nsituation, the market is set for competition between many firms. However, what if the bottom of the long-run\naverage cost curve is at a quantity of 10,000 and the total market demand at that price is only slightly higher\nthan that quantity\u2014or even somewhat lower?\nReturn toFigure 7.11(a), where the bottom of the long-run average cost curve is at 10,000, but now imagine\nthat the total quantity of dishwashers demanded in the market at that price of $500 is only 30,000. In this\nsituation, the total number of firms in the market would be three. We call a handful of firms in a market an\n\u201coligopoly,\u201d and the chapter onMonopolistic Competition and Oligopolywill discuss the range of competitive\nstrategies that can occur when oligopolies compete.\nAlternatively, consider a situation, again in the setting ofFigure 7.11(a), where the bottom of the long-run\naverage cost curve is 10,000, but total demand for the product is only 5,000. (For simplicity, imagine that this\ndemand is highly inelastic, so that it does not vary according to price.) In this situation, the market may well\nend up with a single firm\u2014a monopoly\u2014producing all 5,000 units. If any firm tried to challenge this monopoly\nwhile producing a quantity lower than 5,000 units, the prospective competitor firm would have a higher\naverage cost, and so it would not be able to compete in the longer term without losing money. The chapter on\nMonopolydiscusses the situation of a monopoly firm.\nThus, the shape of the long-run average cost curve reveals whether competitors in the market will be different\nsizes. If the LRAC curve has a single point at the bottom, then the firms in the market will be about the same\nsize, but if the LRAC curve has a flat-bottomed segment of constant returns to scale, then firms in the market\nmay be a variety of different sizes.\nThe relationship between the quantity at the minimum of the long-run average cost curve and the quantity\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.5 \u2022 Costs in the Long Run 181\ndemanded in the market at that price will predict how much competition is likely to exist in the market. If the\nquantity demanded in the market far exceeds the quantity at the minimum of the LRAC, then many firms will\ncompete. If the quantity demanded in the market is only slightly higher than the quantity at the minimum of\nthe LRAC, a few firms will compete. If the quantity demanded in the market is less than the quantity at the\nminimum of the LRAC, a single-producer monopoly is a likely outcome.\nShifting Patterns of Long-Run Average Cost\nNew developments in production technology can shift the long-run average cost curve in ways that can alter\nthe size distribution of firms in an industry.\nFor much of the twentieth century, the most common change had been to see alterations in technology, like the\nassembly line or the large department store, where large-scale producers seemed to gain an advantage over\nsmaller ones. In the long-run average cost curve, the downward-sloping economies of scale portion of the\ncurve stretched over a larger quantity of output.\nHowever, new production technologies do not inevitably lead to a greater average size for firms. For example,\nin recent years some new technologies for generating electricity on a smaller scale have appeared. The\ntraditional coal-burning electricity plants needed to produce 300 to 600 megawatts of power to exploit\neconomies of scale fully. However, high-efficiency turbines to produce electricity from burning natural gas can\nproduce electricity at a competitive price while producing a smaller quantity of 100 megawatts or less. These\nnew technologies create the possibility for smaller companies or plants to generate electricity as efficiently as\nlarge ones. Another example of a technology-driven shift to smaller plants may be taking place in the tire\nindustry. A traditional mid-size tire plant produces about six million tires per year. However, in 2000, the\nItalian company Pirelli introduced a new tire factory that uses many robots. The Pirelli tire plant produced\nonly about one million tires per year, but did so at a lower average cost than a traditional mid-sized tire plant.\nControversy has simmered in recent years over whether the new information and communications\ntechnologies will lead to a larger or smaller size for firms. On one side, the new technology may make it easier\nfor small firms to reach out beyond their local geographic area and find customers across a state, or the nation,\nor even across international boundaries. This factor might seem to predict a future with a larger number of\nsmall competitors. On the other side, perhaps the new information and communications technology will create\n\u201cwinner-take-all\u201d markets where one large company will tend to command a large share of total sales, as\nMicrosoft has done producing of software for personal computers or Amazon has done in online bookselling.\nMoreover, improved information and communication technologies might make it easier to manage many\ndifferent plants and operations across the country or around the world, and thus encourage larger firms. This\nongoing battle between the forces of smallness and largeness will be of great interest to economists,\nbusinesspeople, and policymakers.\nBRING IT HOME\nAmazon\nTraditionally, bookstores have operated in retail locations with inventories held either on the shelves or in the back\nof the store. These retail locations were very pricey in terms of rent. Until recently, Amazon had no retail locations. It\nonly sold online and delivered by mail. Amazon now has retail stores in California, Oregon and Washington State and\nretail stores are coming to Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York. Amazon offers almost any book in\nprint, convenient purchasing, and prompt delivery by mail. Amazon holds its inventories in huge warehouses in low-\nrent locations around the world. The warehouses are highly computerized using robots and relatively low-skilled\nworkers, making for low average costs per sale. Amazon demonstrates the significant advantages economies of\nscale can offer to a firm that exploits those economies. 182 7 \u2022 Key Terms\nKey Terms\naccounting profit total revenues minus explicit costs, including depreciation\naverage profit profit divided by the quantity of output produced; also known as profit margin\naverage total cost total cost divided by the quantity of output\naverage variable cost variable cost divided by the quantity of output\nconstant returns to scale expanding all inputs proportionately does not change the average cost of\nproduction\ndiminishing marginal productivity general rule that as a firm employs more labor, eventually the amount of\nadditional output produced declines\ndiseconomies of scale the long-run average cost of producing output increases as total output increases\neconomic profit total revenues minus total costs (explicit plus implicit costs)\neconomies of scale the long-run average cost of producing output decreases as total output increases\neconomies of scale the long-run average cost of producing output decreases as total output increases\nexplicit costs out-of-pocket costs for a firm, for example, payments for wages and salaries, rent, or materials\nfactors of production (or inputs) resources that firms use to produce their products, for example, labor and\ncapital\nfirm an organization that combines inputs of labor, capital, land, and raw or finished component materials to\nproduce outputs.\nfixed cost cost of the fixed inputs; expenditure that a firm must make before production starts and that does\nnot change regardless of the production level\nfixed inputs factors of production that can\u2019t be easily increased or decreased in a short period of time\nimplicit costs opportunity cost of resources already owned by the firm and used in business, for example,\nexpanding a factory onto land already owned\nlong run period of time during which all of a firm\u2019s inputs are variable\nlong-run average cost (LRAC) curve shows the lowest possible average cost of production, allowing all the\ninputs to production to vary so that the firm is choosing its production technology\nmarginal cost the additional cost of producing one more unit; mathematically,\nmarginal product change in a firm\u2019s output when it employees more labor; mathematically,\nprivate enterprise the ownership of businesses by private individuals\nproduction the process of combining inputs to produce outputs, ideally of a value greater than the value of the\ninputs\nproduction function mathematical equation that tells how much output a firm can produce with given\namounts of the inputs\nproduction technologies alternative methods of combining inputs to produce output\nrevenue income from selling a firm\u2019s product; defined as price times quantity sold\nshort run period of time during which at least one or more of the firm\u2019s inputs is fixed\nshort-run average cost (SRAC) curve the average total cost curve in the short term; shows the total of the\naverage fixed costs and the average variable costs\ntotal cost the sum of fixed and variable costs of production\ntotal product synonym for a firm\u2019s output\nvariable cost cost of production that increases with the quantity produced; the cost of the variable inputs\nvariable inputs factors of production that a firm can easily increase or decrease in a short period of time\nKey Concepts and Summary\n7.1Explicit and Implicit Costs, and Accounting and Economic Profit\nPrivately owned firms are motivated to earn profits. Profit is the difference between revenues and costs. While\naccounting profit considers only explicit costs, economic profit considers both explicit and implicit costs.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7 \u2022 Key Concepts and Summary 183\n7.2Production in the Short Run\nProduction is the process a firm uses to transform inputs (e.g., labor, capital, raw materials, etc.) into outputs. It\nis not possible to vary fixed inputs (e.g., capital) in a short period of time. Thus, in the short run the only way to\nchange output is to change the variable inputs (e.g., labor). Marginal product is the additional output a firm\nobtains by employing more labor in production. At some point, employing additional labor leads to\ndiminishing marginal productivity, meaning the additional output obtained is less than for the previous\nincrement to labor. Mathematically, marginal product is the slope of the total product curve.\n7.3Costs in the Short Run\nFor every input (e.g., labor), there is an associated factor payment (e.g., wages and salaries). The cost of\nproduction for a given quantity of output is the sum of the amount of each input required to produce that\nquantity of output times the associated factor payment.\nIn a short-run perspective, we can divide a firm\u2019s total costs into fixed costs, which a firm must incur before\nproducing any output, and variable costs, which the firm incurs in the act of producing. Fixed costs are sunk\ncosts; that is, because they are in the past and the firm cannot alter them, they should play no role in economic\ndecisions about future production or pricing. Variable costs typically show diminishing marginal returns, so\nthat the marginal cost of producing higher levels of output rises.\nWe calculate marginal cost by taking the change in total cost (or the change in variable cost, which will be the\nsame thing) and dividing it by the change in output, for each possible change in output. Marginal costs are\ntypically rising. A firm can compare marginal cost to the additional revenue it gains from selling another unit\nto find out whether its marginal unit is adding to profit.\nWe calculate average total cost by taking total cost and dividing by total output at each different level of output.\nAverage costs are typically U-shaped on a graph. If a firm\u2019s average cost of production is lower than the market\nprice, a firm will be earning profits.\nWe calculate average variable cost by taking variable cost and dividing by the total output at each level of\noutput. Average variable costs are typically U-shaped. If a firm\u2019s average variable cost of production is lower\nthan the market price, then the firm would be earning profits if fixed costs are left out of the picture.\n7.4Production in the Long Run\nIn the long run, all inputs are variable. Since diminishing marginal productivity is caused by fixed capital,\nthere are no diminishing returns in the long run. Firms can choose the optimal capital stock to produce their\ndesired level of output.\n7.5Costs in the Long Run\nA production technology refers to a specific combination of labor, physical capital, and technology that makes\nup a particular method of production.\nIn the long run, firms can choose their production technology, and so all costs become variable costs. In\nmaking this choice, firms will try to substitute relatively inexpensive inputs for relatively expensive inputs\nwhere possible, so as to produce at the lowest possible long-run average cost.\nEconomies of scale refers to a situation where as the level of output increases, the average cost decreases.\nConstant returns to scale refers to a situation where average cost does not change as output increases.\nDiseconomies of scale refers to a situation where as output increases, average costs also increase.\nThe long-run average cost curve shows the lowest possible average cost of production, allowing all the inputs\nto production to vary so that the firm is choosing its production technology. A downward-sloping LRAC shows\neconomies of scale; a flat LRAC shows constant returns to scale; an upward-sloping LRAC shows diseconomies\nof scale. If the long-run average cost curve has only one quantity produced that results in the lowest possible 184 7 \u2022 Self-Check Questions\naverage cost, then all of the firms competing in an industry should be the same size. However, if the LRAC has a\nflat segment at the bottom, so that a firm can produce a range of different quantities at the lowest average cost,\nthe firms competing in the industry will display a range of sizes. The market demand in conjunction with the\nlong-run average cost curve determines how many firms will exist in a given industry.\nIf the quantity demanded in the market of a certain product is much greater than the quantity found at the\nbottom of the long-run average cost curve, where the cost of production is lowest, the market will have many\nfirms competing. If the quantity demanded in the market is less than the quantity at the bottom of the LRAC,\nthere will likely be only one firm.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

(Credit: modification \u201cAgronomist & Farmer Inspecting Weeds\u201d by United Soybean Board/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nCHAPTER OBJECTIVES\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\u2022 Perfect Competition and Why It Matters\n\u2022 How Perfectly Competitive Firms Make Output Decisions\n\u2022 Entry and Exit Decisions in the Long Run\n\u2022 Efficiency in Perfectly Competitive Markets\nIntroduction to Perfect Competition\nBRING IT HOME\nA Dime a Dozen\nWhen you were younger did you babysit, deliver papers, or mow the lawn for money? If so, you faced stiff\ncompetition from many other competitors who offered identical services. There was nothing to stop others from\nalso offering their services.\nAll of you charged the \u201cgoing rate.\u201d If you tried to charge more, your customers would simply buy from someone\nelse. These conditions are very similar to the conditions agricultural growers face. 188 8 \u2022 Perfect Competition\nGrowing a crop may be more difficult to start than a babysitting or lawn mowing service, but growers face the same\nfierce competition. In the grand scale of world agriculture, farmers face competition from thousands of others\nbecause they sell an identical product. After all, winter wheat is winter wheat, but if they find it hard to make money\nwith that crop, it is relatively easy for farmers to leave the marketplace for another crop. In this case, they do not sell\nthe family farm, they switch crops.\nTake the case of the upper Midwest region of the United States\u2014for many generations the area was called \u201cKing\nWheat.\u201d According to the United States Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service, statistics\nby state, in 1997, 11.6 million acres of wheat and 780,000 acres of corn were planted in North Dakota. In the\nintervening 25 or so years has the mix of crops changed? Since it is relatively easy to switch crops, did farmers\nchange what they planted in response to changes in relative crop prices? We will find out at chapter\u2019s end.\nIn the meantime, let's consider the topic of this chapter\u2014the perfectly competitive market. This is a market in which\nentry and exit are relatively easy and competitors are \u201ca dime a dozen.\u201d\nMost businesses face two realities: no one is required to buy their products, and even customers who might\nwant those products may buy from other businesses instead. Firms that operate in perfectly competitive\nmarkets face this reality. In this chapter, you will learn how such firms make decisions about how much to\nproduce, how much profit they make, whether to stay in business or not, and many others. Industries differ\nfrom one another in terms of how many sellers there are in a specific market, how easy or difficult it is for a\nnew firm to enter, and the type of products that they sell. Economists refer to this as an industry'smarket\nstructure. In this chapter, we focus on perfect competition. However, in other chapters we will examine other\nindustry types:MonopolyandMonopolistic Competition and Oligopoly.\n8.1Perfect Competition and Why It Matters\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain the characteristics of a perfectly competitive market\n\u2022 Discuss how perfectly competitive firms react in the short run and in the long run\nFirms are inperfect competitionwhen the following conditions occur: (1) many firms produce identical\nproducts; (2) many buyers are available to buy the product, and many sellers are available to sell the product;\n(3) sellers and buyers have all relevant information to make rational decisions about the product that they are\nbuying and selling; and (4) firms can enter and leave the market without any restrictions\u2014in other words, there\nis free entry and exit into and out of the market.\nAperfectly competitive firmis known as aprice taker, because the pressure of competing firms forces it to\naccept the prevailing equilibrium price in the market. If a firm in a perfectly competitive market raises the\nprice of its product by so much as a penny, it will lose all of its sales to competitors. When a wheat grower, as\nwe discussed in the Bring It Home feature, wants to know the going price of wheat, they have to check on the\ncomputer or listen to the radio. Supply and demand in the entire market solely determine the market price, not\nthe individual farmer. A perfectly competitive firm must be a very small player in the overall market, so that it\ncan increase or decrease output without noticeably affecting the overall quantity supplied and price in the\nmarket.\nA perfectly competitive market is a hypothetical extreme; however, producers in a number of industries do\nface many competitor firms selling highly similar goods, in which case they must often act as price takers.\nEconomists often use agricultural markets as an example. The same crops that different farmers grow are\nlargely interchangeable. According to the United States Department of Agriculture monthly reports, in\nDecember 2021, U.S. corn farmers received an average of $5.47 per bushel. A corn farmer who attempted to\nsell at $6.00 per bushel would not have found any buyers. A perfectly competitive firm will not sell below the\nequilibrium price either. Why should they when they can sell all they want at the higher price? Other examples\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.2 \u2022 How Perfectly Competitive Firms Make Output Decisions 189\nof agricultural markets that operate in close to perfectly competitive markets are small roadside produce\nmarkets and small organic farmers.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/commodities)that reveals the current value of various commodities.\nThis chapter examines how profit-seeking firms decide how much to produce in perfectly competitive\nmarkets. Such firms will analyze their costs as we discussed in the chapter onProduction, Costs and Industry\nStructure. In the short run, the perfectly competitive firm will seek the quantity of output where profits are\nhighest or, if profits are not possible, where losses are lowest.\nIn the long run, positive economic profits will attract competition as other firms enter the market. Economic\nlosses will cause firms to exit the market. Ultimately, perfectly competitive markets will attain long-run\nequilibriumwhen no new firms want to enter the market and existing firms do not want to leave the market, as\neconomic profits have been driven down to zero.\n8.2How Perfectly Competitive Firms Make Output Decisions\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Calculate profits by comparing total revenue and total cost\n\u2022 Identify profits and losses with the average cost curve\n\u2022 Explain the shutdown point\n\u2022 Determine the price at which a firm should continue producing in the short run\nAperfectly competitive firmhas only one major decision to make\u2014namely, what quantity to produce. To\nunderstand this, consider a different way of writing out the basic definition ofprofit:\nSince a perfectly competitive firm must accept the price for its output as determined by the product\u2019s market\ndemand and supply, it cannot choose the price it charges. This is already determined in the profit equation,\nand so the perfectly competitive firm can sell any number of units at exactly the same price. It implies that the\nfirm faces a perfectly elastic demand curve for its product: buyers are willing to buy any number of units of\noutput from the firm at the market price. When the perfectly competitive firm chooses what quantity to\nproduce, then this quantity\u2014along with the prices prevailing in the market for output and inputs\u2014will\ndetermine the firm\u2019s total revenue, total costs, and ultimately, level of profits.\nDetermining the Highest Profit by Comparing Total Revenue and Total Cost\nA perfectly competitive firm can sell as large a quantity as it wishes, as long as it accepts the prevailing market\nprice. The formula above shows that total revenue depends on the quantity sold and the price charged. If the\nfirm sells a higher quantity of output, then total revenue will increase. If the market price of the product\nincreases, then total revenue also increases whatever the quantity of output sold. As an example of how a\nperfectly competitive firm decides what quantity to produce, consider the case of a small farmer who produces\nraspberries and sells them frozen for $4 per pack. Sales of one pack of raspberries will bring in $4, two packs\nwill be $8, three packs will be $12, and so on. If, for example, the price of frozen raspberries doubles to $8 per\npack, then sales of one pack of raspberries will be $8, two packs will be $16, three packs will be $24, and so on.\nTable 8.1showstotal revenueandtotal costsfor the raspberry farm; these data also appear inFigure 8.2. The\nhorizontal axis shows the quantity of frozen raspberries produced in packs. The vertical axis shows both total\nrevenue and total costs, measured in dollars. The total cost curve intersects with the vertical axis at a value\nthat shows the level of fixed costs, and then slopes upward. All these cost curves follow the same 190 8 \u2022 Perfect Competition\ncharacteristics as the curves that we covered in theProduction, Costs and Industry Structurechapter.\nFIGURE8.2Total Cost and Total Revenue at the Raspberry FarmTotal revenue for a perfectly competitive firm is a\nstraight line sloping up. The slope is equal to the price of the good. Total cost also slopes up, but with some\ncurvature. At higher levels of output, total cost begins to slope upward more steeply because of diminishing\nmarginal returns. The maximum profit will occur at the quantity where the difference between total revenue and\ntotal cost is largest.\nQuantity Total Cost Total Revenue\nProfit\n(Q) (TC) (TR)\n0 $62 $0 \u2212$62\n10 $90 $40 \u2212$50\n20 $110 $80 \u2212$30\n30 $126 $120 \u2212$6\n40 $138 $160 $22\n50 $150 $200 $50\n60 $165 $240 $75\n70 $190 $280 $90\n80 $230 $320 $90\n90 $296 $360 $64\n100 $400 $400 $0\n110 $550 $440 $\u2212110\n120 $715 $480 $\u2212235\nTABLE8.1Total Cost and Total Revenue at the\nRaspberry Farm\nBased on its total revenue and total cost curves, a perfectly competitive firm like the raspberry farm can\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.2 \u2022 How Perfectly Competitive Firms Make Output Decisions 191\ncalculate the quantity of output that will provide the highest level of profit. At any given quantity, total revenue\nminus total cost will equal profit. One way to determine the most profitable quantity to produce is to see at\nwhat quantity total revenue exceeds total cost by the largest amount.Figure 8.2shows total revenue, total cost\nand profit using the data fromTable 8.1. The vertical gap between total revenue and total cost is profit, for\nexample, at Q = 60, TR = 240 and TC = 165. The difference is 75, which is the height of the profit curve at that\noutput level. The firm doesn\u2019t make a profit at every level of output. In this example, total costs will exceed total\nrevenues at output levels from 0 to approximately 30, and so over this range of output, the firm will be making\nlosses. At output levels from 40 to 100, total revenues exceed total costs, so the firm is earning profits.\nHowever, at any output greater than 100, total costs again exceed total revenues and the firm is making\nincreasing losses. Total profits appear in the final column ofTable 8.1. Maximum profit occurs at an output\nbetween 70 and 80, when profit equals $90.\nA higher price would mean that total revenue would be higher for every quantity sold. A lower price would\nmean that total revenue would be lower for every quantity sold. What happens if the price drops low enough so\nthat the total revenue line is completely below the total cost curve; that is, at every level of output, total costs\nare higher than total revenues? In this instance, the best the firm can do is to suffer losses. However, a profit-\nmaximizing firm will prefer the quantity of output where total revenues come closest to total costs and thus\nwhere the losses are smallest.\n(Later we will see that sometimes it will make sense for the firm to close, rather than stay in operation\nproducing output.)\nComparing Marginal Revenue and Marginal Costs\nThe approach that we described in the previous section, using total revenue and total cost, is not the only\napproach to determining the profit maximizing level of output. In this section, we provide an alternative\napproach which uses marginal revenue and marginal cost.\nFirms often do not have the necessary data they need to draw a complete total cost curve for all levels of\nproduction. They cannot be sure of what total costs would look like if they, say, doubled production or cut\nproduction in half, because they have not tried it. Instead, firms experiment. They produce a slightly greater or\nlower quantity and observe how it affects profits. In economic terms, this practical approach to maximizing\nprofits means examining how changes in production affect marginal revenue and marginal cost.\nFigure 8.3presents the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves based on the total revenue and total cost in\nTable 8.1. Themarginal revenuecurve shows the additional revenue gained from selling one more unit. As\nmentioned before, a firm in perfect competition faces a perfectly elastic demand curve for its product\u2014that is,\nthe firm\u2019s demand curve is a horizontal line drawn at the market price level. This also means that the firm\u2019s\nmarginal revenue curve is the same as the firm\u2019s demand curve: Every time a consumer demands one more\nunit, the firm sells one more unit and revenue increases by exactly the same amount equal to the market price.\nIn this example, every time the firm sells a pack of frozen raspberries, the firm\u2019s revenue increases by $4.\nTable 8.2shows an example of this. This condition only holds for price taking firms in perfect competition\nwhere:\nThe formula for marginal revenue is: 192 8 \u2022 Perfect Competition\nPrice Quantity Total Revenue Marginal Revenue\n$4 1 $4 -\n$4 2 $8 $4\n$4 3 $12 $4\n$4 4 $16 $4\nTABLE8.2\nNotice that marginal revenue does not change as the firm produces more output. That is because under\nperfect competition, the price is determined through the interaction of supply and demand in the market and\ndoes not change as the farmer produces more (keeping in mind that, due to the relative small size of each firm,\nincreasing their supply has no impact on the total market supply where price is determined).\nSince a perfectly competitive firm is a price taker, it can sell whatever quantity it wishes at the market-\ndetermined price. We calculate marginal cost, the cost per additional unit sold, by dividing the change in total\ncost by the change in quantity. The formula for marginal cost is:\nOrdinarily, marginal cost changes as the firm produces a greater quantity.\nIn the raspberry farm example, inFigure 8.3andTable 8.3, marginal cost at first declines as production\nincreases from 10 to 20 to 30 to 40 packs of raspberries\u2014which represents the area of increasing marginal\nreturns that is not uncommon at low levels of production. At some point, though, marginal costs start to\nincrease, displaying the typical pattern of diminishing marginal returns. If the firm is producing at a quantity\nwhere MR > MC, like 40 or 50 packs of raspberries, then it can increase profit by increasing output because the\nmarginal revenue is exceeding the marginal cost. If the firm is producing at a quantity where MC > MR, like 90\nor 100 packs, then it can increase profit by reducing output because the reductions in marginal cost will\nexceed the reductions in marginal revenue. The firm\u2019s profit-maximizing choice of output will occur where MR\n= MC (or at a choice close to that point).\nFIGURE8.3Marginal Revenues and Marginal Costs at the Raspberry Farm: Individual FarmerFor a perfectly\ncompetitive firm, the marginal revenue (MR) curve is a horizontal line because it is equal to the price of the good,\nwhich is determined by the market, asFigure 8.4illustrates. The marginal cost (MC) curve is sometimes initially\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.2 \u2022 How Perfectly Competitive Firms Make Output Decisions 193\ndownward-sloping, if there is a region of increasing marginal returns at low levels of output, but is eventually\nupward-sloping at higher levels of output as diminishing marginal returns kick in.\nFIGURE8.4Supply, Demand, and Equilibrium Price in the Market for RaspberriesThe equilibrium price of\nraspberries is determined through the interaction of market supply and market demand at $4.00.\nQuantity Total Cost Marginal Cost Total Revenue Marginal Revenue Profit\n0 $62 - $0 $4 -$62\n10 $90 $2.80 $40 $4 -$50\n20 $110 $2.00 $80 $4 -$30\n30 $126 $1.60 $120 $4 -$6\n40 $138 $1.20 $160 $4 $22\n50 $150 $1.20 $200 $4 $50\n60 $165 $1.50 $240 $4 $75\n70 $190 $2.50 $280 $4 $90\n80 $230 $4.00 $320 $4 $90\n90 $296 $6.60 $360 $4 $64\n100 $400 $10.40 $400 $4 $0\n110 $550 $15.00 $440 $4 -$110\n120 $715 $16.50 $480 $4 -$235\nTABLE8.3Marginal Revenues and Marginal Costs at the Raspberry Farm\nIn this example, the marginal revenue andmarginal costcurves cross at a price of $4 and a quantity of 80\nproduced. If the farmer started out producing at a level of 60, and then experimented with increasing\nproduction to 70, marginal revenues from the increase in production would exceed marginal costs\u2014and so\nprofits would rise. The farmer has an incentive to keep producing. At a level of output of 80, marginal cost and 194 8 \u2022 Perfect Competition\nmarginal revenue are equal so profit doesn\u2019t change. If the farmer then experimented further with increasing\nproduction from 80 to 90, he would find that marginal costs from the increase in production are greater than\nmarginal revenues, and so profits would decline.\nThe profit-maximizing choice for a perfectly competitive firm will occur at the level of output where marginal\nrevenue is equal to marginal cost\u2014that is, where MR = MC. This occurs at Q = 80 in the figure.\nWORK IT OUT\nDoes Profit Maximization Occur at a Range of Output or a Specific Level of Output?\nTable 8.1shows that maximum profit occurs at any output level between 70 and 80 units of output. But MR = MC\noccurs only at 80 units of output. How can we explain this slight discrepancy? As long as MR > MC, a profit-\nseeking firm should keep expanding production. Expanding production into the zone where MR < MC reduces\neconomic profits. It\u2019s true that profit is the same at Q = 70 and Q = 80, but it\u2019s only when the firm goes beyond\nthat Q that it will see that profits fall. Thus, MR = MC is the signal to stop expanding, so that is the level of output\nthey should target.\nBecause the marginal revenue received by a perfectly competitive firm is equal to the price P, we can also write\nthe profit-maximizing rule for a perfectly competitive firm as a recommendation to produce at the quantity of\noutput where P = MC.\nProfits and Losses with the Average Cost Curve\nDoes maximizing profit (producing where MR = MC) imply an actual economic profit? The answer depends on\nthe relationship between price and average total cost, which is the average profit orprofit margin. If the\nmarket price is higher than the firm's average cost of production for that quantity produced, then the profit\nmargin is positive and the firm will earn profits. Conversely, if the market price is lower than the average cost\nof production, the profit margin is negative and the firm will suffer losses. You might think that, in this\nsituation, the firm may want to shut down immediately. Remember, however, that the firm has already paid for\nfixed costs, such as equipment, so it may continue to produce for a while and incur a loss.Table 8.3continues\nthe raspberry farm example.Figure 8.5illustrates the three possible scenarios: (a) where price intersects\nmarginal cost at a level above the average cost curve, (b) where price intersects marginal cost at a level equal to\nthe average cost curve, and (c) where price intersects marginal cost at a level below the average cost curve.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.2 \u2022 How Perfectly Competitive Firms Make Output Decisions 195\nFIGURE8.5Price and Average Cost at the Raspberry FarmIn (a), price intersects marginal cost above the average\ncost curve. Since price is greater than average cost, the firm is making a profit. In (b), price intersects marginal cost\nat the minimum point of the average cost curve. Since price is equal to average cost, the firm is breaking even. In (c),\nprice intersects marginal cost below the average cost curve. Since price is less than average cost, the firm is making\na loss.\nFirst consider a situation where the price is equal to $5 for a pack of frozen raspberries. The rule for a profit-\nmaximizing perfectly competitive firm is to produce the level of output where Price= MR = MC, so the\nraspberry farmer will produce a quantity of approximately 85, which is labeled as E' inFigure 8.5(a).\nRemember that the area of a rectangle is equal to its base multiplied by its height. The farm\u2019s total revenue at\nthis price will be shown by the rectangle from the origin over to a quantity of 85 packs (the base) up to point E'\n(the height), over to the price of $5, and back to the origin. The average cost of producing 80 packs is shown by\npoint C or about $3.50. Total costs will be the quantity of 85 times the average cost of $3.50, which is shown by\nthe area of the rectangle from the origin to a quantity of 90, up to point C, over to the vertical axis and down to\nthe origin. The difference between total revenues and total costs is profits. Thus, profits will be the blue shaded\nrectangle on top.\nWe calculate this as: 196 8 \u2022 Perfect Competition\nOr, we can calculate it as:\nNow considerFigure 8.5(b), where the price has fallen to $2.75 for a pack of frozen raspberries. Again, the\nperfectly competitive firm will choose the level of output where Price = MR = MC, but in this case, the quantity\nproduced will be 75. At this price and output level, where the marginal cost curve is crossing the average cost\ncurve, the price the firm receives is exactly equal to its average cost of production. We call this thebreak even\npoint.\nThe farm\u2019s total revenue at this price will be shown by the large shaded rectangle from the origin over to a\nquantity of 75 packs (the base) up to point E (the height), over to the price of $2.75, and back to the origin. The\nheight of the average cost curve at Q = 75, i.e. point E, shows the average cost of producing this quantity. Total\ncosts will be the quantity of 75 times the average cost of $2.75, which is shown by the area of the rectangle\nfrom the origin to a quantity of 75, up to point E, over to the vertical axis and down to the origin. It should be\nclear that the rectangles for total revenue and total cost are the same. Thus, the firm is making zero profit. The\ncalculations are as follows:\nOr, we can calculate it as:\nInFigure 8.5(c), the market price has fallen still further to $2.00 for a pack of frozen raspberries. At this price,\nmarginal revenue intersects marginal cost at a quantity of 65. The farm\u2019s total revenue at this price will be\nshown by the large shaded rectangle from the origin over to a quantity of 65 packs (the base) up to point E\u201d (the\nheight), over to the price of $2, and back to the origin. The average cost of producing 65 packs is shown by\nPoint C\u201d or shows the average cost of producing 50 packs is about $2.73. Total costs will be the quantity of 65\ntimes the average cost of $2.73, which the area of the rectangle from the origin to a quantity of 50, up to point\nC\u201d, over to the vertical axis and down to the origin shows. It should be clear from examining the two rectangles\nthat total revenue is less than total cost. Thus, the firm is losing money and the loss (or negative profit) will be\nthe rose-shaded rectangle.\nThe calculations are:\nOr:\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.2 \u2022 How Perfectly Competitive Firms Make Output Decisions 197\nIf the market price that perfectly competitive firm receives leads it to produce at a quantity where the price is\ngreater than average cost, the firm will earn profits. If the price the firm receives causes it to produce at a\nquantity where price equals average cost, which occurs at the minimum point of the AC curve, then the firm\nearns zero profits. Finally, if the price the firm receives leads it to produce at a quantity where the price is less\nthan average cost, the firm will earn losses.Table 8.4summarizes this.\nIf... Then...\nPrice > ATC Firm earns an economic profit\nPrice = ATC Firm earns zero economic profit\nPrice < ATC Firm earns a loss\nTABLE8.4\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhich intersection should a firm choose?\nAt a price of $2, MR intersects MC at two points: Q = 20 and Q = 65. It never makes sense for a firm to choose a level\nof output on the downward sloping part of the MC curve, because the profit is lower (the loss is bigger). Thus, the\ncorrect choice of output is Q = 65.\nThe Shutdown Point\nThe possibility that a firm may earn losses raises a question: Why can the firm not avoid losses by shutting\ndown and not producing at all? The answer is that shutting down can reduce variable costs to zero, but in the\nshort run, the firm has already paid for fixed costs. As a result, if the firm produces a quantity of zero, it would\nstill make losses because it would still need to pay for its fixed costs. Therefore when a firm is experiencing\nlosses, it must face a question: should it continue producing or should it shut down?\nAs an example, consider the situation of the Yoga Center, which has signed a contract to rent space that costs\n$10,000 per month. If the firm decides to operate, its marginal costs for hiring yoga teachers is $15,000 for the\nmonth. If the firm shuts down, it must still pay the rent, but it would not need to hire labor.Table 8.5shows\nthree possible scenarios. In the first scenario, the Yoga Center does not have any clients, and therefore does not\nmake any revenues, in which case it faces losses of $10,000 equal to the fixed costs. In the second scenario, the\nYoga Center has clients that earn the center revenues of $10,000 for the month, but ultimately experiences\nlosses of $15,000 due to having to hire yoga instructors to cover the classes. In the third scenario, the Yoga\nCenter earns revenues of $20,000 for the month, but experiences losses of $5,000.\nIn all three cases, the Yoga Center loses money. In all three cases, when the rental contract expires in the long\nrun, assuming revenues do not improve, the firm should exit this business. In the short run, though, the\ndecision varies depending on the level of losses and whether the firm can cover its variable costs. In scenario 1,\nthe center does not have any revenues, so hiring yoga teachers would increase variable costs and losses, so it\nshould shut down and only incur its fixed costs. In scenario 2, the center\u2019s losses are greater because it does\nnot make enough revenue to offset the increased variable costs, so it should shut down immediately and only\nincur its fixed costs. If price is below the minimum average variable cost, the firm must shut down. In contrast,\nin scenario 3 the revenue that the center can earn is high enough that the losses diminish when it remains\nopen, so the center should remain open in the short run. 198 8 \u2022 Perfect Competition\nScenario 1\nIf the center shuts down now, revenues are zero but it will not incur any variable costs and would only need to pay\nfixed costs of $10,000.\nScenario 2\nThe center earns revenues of $10,000, and variable costs are $15,000. The center should shut down now.\nScenario 3\nThe center earns revenues of $20,000, and variable costs are $15,000. The center should continue in business.\nTABLE8.5Should the Yoga Center Shut Down Now or Later?\nFigure 8.6illustrates the lesson that remaining open requires the price to exceed the firm\u2019s average variable\ncost. When the firm is operating below the break-even point, where price equals average cost, it is operating at\na loss so it faces two options: continue to produce and lose money or shutdown. Which option is preferable?\nThe one that loses the least money is the best choice.\nAt a price of $2.00 per pack, as Figure 8.6 (a) illustrates, if the farm stays in operation it will produce at a level\nof 65 packs of raspberries, and it will make losses of $47.45 (as explained earlier). The alternative would be to\nshut down and lose all the fixed costs of $62.00. Since losing $47.45 is preferable to losing $62.00, the profit\nmaximizing (or in this case the loss minimizing) choice is to stay in operation. The key reason is because price\nis above average variable cost. This means that at the current price the farm can pay all its variable costs, and\nhave some revenue left over to pay some of the fixed costs. So the loss represents the part of the fixed costs the\nfarm can\u2019t pay, which is less than the entire fixed costs. However, if the price declined to $1.50 per pack, as\nFigure 8.6(b) shows, and if the firm applied its rule of producing where P = MR = MC, it would produce a\nquantity of 60. This price is below average variable cost for this level of output. If the farmer cannot pay\nworkers (the variable costs), then it has to shut down. At this price and output, total revenues would be $90\n(quantity of 60 times price of $1.50) and total cost would be $165, for overall losses of $75. If the farm shuts\ndown, it must pay only its fixed costs of $62, so shutting down is preferable to selling at a price of $1.50 per\npack.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.2 \u2022 How Perfectly Competitive Firms Make Output Decisions 199\nFIGURE8.6The Shutdown Point for the Raspberry FarmIn (a), the farm produces at a level of 65. It is making\nlosses of $47.50, but price is above average variable cost, so it continues to operate. In (b), total revenues are $90\nand total cost is $165, for overall losses of $75. If the farm shuts down, it must pay only its fixed costs of $62.\nShutting down is preferable to selling at a price of $1.50 per pack.\nLooking atTable 8.6, if the price falls below about $1.72, the minimum average variable cost, the firm must\nshut down.\nQuantity Average Variable Cost Average Cost Marginal Cost\nQ AVC AC MC\n0 - - -\n10 $2.80 $9.00 $2.80\n20 $2.40 $5.50 $2.00\n30 $2.13 $4.20 $1.60\n40 $1.90 $3.45 $1.20\n50 $1.76 $3.00 $1.20\n60 $1.72 $2.75 $1.50\n70 $1.83 $2.71 $2.50\n80 $2.10 $2.88 $4.00\n90 $2.60 $3.29 $6.60\n100 $3.38 $4.00 $10.40\n110 $4.44 $5.00 $15.00\n120 $5.44 $5.96 $31.50\nTABLE8.6Cost of Production for the Raspberry Farm 200 8 \u2022 Perfect Competition\nThe intersection of the average variable cost curve and the marginal cost curve, which shows the price below\nwhich the firm would lack enough revenue to cover its variable costs, is called theshutdown point. If the\nperfectly competitive firm faces a market price above the shutdown point, then the firm is at least covering its\naverage variable costs. At a price above the shutdown point, the firm is also making enough revenue to cover at\nleast a portion of fixed costs, so it should limp ahead even if it is making losses in the short run, since at least\nthose losses will be smaller than if the firm shuts down immediately and incurs a loss equal to total fixed costs.\nHowever, if the firm is receiving a price below the price at the shutdown point, then the firm is not even\ncovering its variable costs. In this case, staying open is making the firm\u2019s losses larger, and it should shut down\nimmediately. To summarize, if:\n\u2022 price < minimum average variable cost, then firm shuts down\n\u2022 price > minimum average variable cost, then firm stays in business\nShort-Run Outcomes for Perfectly Competitive Firms\nThe average cost and average variable cost curves divide the marginal cost curve into three segments, as\nFigure 8.7shows. At the market price, which the perfectly competitive firm accepts as given, the profit-\nmaximizing firm chooses the output level where price or marginal revenue, which are the same thing for a\nperfectly competitive firm, is equal to marginal cost: P = MR = MC.\nFIGURE8.7Profit, Loss, ShutdownWe can divide the marginal cost curve into three zones, based on where it is\ncrossed by the average cost and average variable cost curves. We call the point where MC crosses AC the break even\npoint. If the firm is operating where the market price is at a level higher than the break even point, then price will be\ngreater than average cost and the firm is earning profits. If the price is exactly at the break even point, then the firm\nis making zero profits. If price falls in the zone between the shutdown point and the break even point, then the firm\nis making losses but will continue to operate in the short run, since it is covering its variable costs, and more if price\nis above the shutdown-point price. However, if price falls below the price at the shutdown point, then the firm will\nshut down immediately, since it is not even covering its variable costs.\nFirst consider the upper zone, where prices are above the level where marginal cost (MC) crosses average cost\n(AC) at the zero profit point. At any price above that level, the firm will earn profits in the short run. If the price\nfalls exactly on the break even point where the MC and AC curves cross, then the firm earns zero profits. If a\nprice falls into the zone between the break even point, where MC crosses AC, and the shutdown point, where\nMC crosses AVC, the firm will be making losses in the short run\u2014but since the firm is more than covering its\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.2 \u2022 How Perfectly Competitive Firms Make Output Decisions 201\nvariable costs, the losses are smaller than if the firm shut down immediately. Finally, consider a price at or\nbelow the shutdown point where MC crosses AVC. At any price like this one, the firm will shut down\nimmediately, because it cannot even cover its variable costs.\nMarginal Cost and the Firm\u2019s Supply Curve\nFor a perfectly competitive firm, the marginal cost curve is identical to the firm\u2019s supply curve starting from\nthe minimum point on the average variable cost curve. To understand why this perhaps surprising insight\nholds true, first think about what the supply curve means. A firm checks the market price and then looks at its\nsupply curve to decide what quantity to produce. Now, think about what it means to say that a firm will\nmaximize its profits by producing at the quantity where P = MC. This rule means that the firm checks the\nmarket price, and then looks at its marginal cost to determine the quantity to produce\u2014and makes sure that\nthe price is greater than the minimum average variable cost. In other words, the marginal cost curve above the\nminimum point on the average variable cost curve becomes the firm\u2019s supply curve.\nLINK IT UP\nWatch thisvideo(http://openstax.org/l/foodprice)that addresses how drought in the United States can impact\nfood prices across the world.\nAs we discussed in the chapter onDemand and Supply, many of the reasons that supply curves shift relate to\nunderlying changes in costs. For example, a lower price of key inputs or new technologies that reduce\nproduction costs cause supply to shift to the right. In contrast, bad weather or added government regulations\ncan add to costs of certain goods in a way that causes supply to shift to the left. We can also interpret these\nshifts in the firm\u2019s supply curve as shifts of the marginal cost curve. A shift in costs of production that\nincreases marginal costs at all levels of output\u2014and shifts MC upward and to the left\u2014will cause a perfectly\ncompetitive firm to produce less at any given market price. Conversely, a shift in costs of production that\ndecreases marginal costs at all levels of output will shift MC downward and to the right and as a result, a\ncompetitive firm will choose to expand its level of output at any given price. The following Work It Out feature\nwill walk you through an example.\nWORK IT OUT\nAt What Price Should the Firm Continue Producing in the Short Run?\nTo determine the short-run economic condition of a firm in perfect competition, follow the steps outlined below.\nUse the data inTable 8.7.\nQ P TFC TVC TC AVC ATC MC TR Profits\n0 $28 $20 $0 - - - - - -\n1 $28 $20 $20 - - - - - -\n2 $28 $20 $25 - - - - - -\n3 $28 $20 $35 - - - - - -\n4 $28 $20 $52 - - - - - -\n5 $28 $20 $80 - - - - - -\nTABLE8.7 202 8 \u2022 Perfect Competition\nStep 1.

Determine the market price that the firm receives for its product. Since the firm in perfect competition\nis a price taker, the market price is constant. With the given price, calculate total revenue as equal to price\nmultiplied by quantity for all output levels produced. In this example, the given price is $28. You can see that in\nthe second column ofTable 8.9.\nQuantity Price Total Revenue (P \u00d7 Q)\n0 $28 $28\u00d70=$0\n1 $28 $28\u00d71=$28\n2 $28 $28\u00d72=$56\n3 $28 $28\u00d73=$84\n4 $28 $28\u00d74=$112\n5 $28 $28\u00d75=$140\nTABLE8.9\nStep 3.

To find the profit-maximizing output level, look at the Marginal Cost column (at every output level\nproduced), asTable 8.11shows, and determine where it is equal to the market price. The output level where\nprice equals the marginal cost is the output level that maximizes profits.\nQ P TFC TVC TC AVC ATC MC TR Profits\n0 $28 $20 $0 $20 - - - $0 \u2212$20\n1 $28 $20 $20 $40 $20.00 $40.00 $20 $28 \u2212$12\n2 $28 $20 $25 $45 $12.50 $22.50 $5 $56 $11\n3 $28 $20 $35 $55 $11.67 $18.33 $10 $84 $29\n4 $28 $20 $52 $72 $13.00 $18.00 $17 $112 $40\n5 $28 $20 $80 $100 $16.40 $20.40 $28 $140 $40\nTABLE8.11\nStep 5. Once you have determined the profit-maximizing output level (in this case, output quantity 5), you can\nlook at the amount of profits made (in this case, $40).\nStep 6. If the firm is making economic losses, the firm needs to determine whether it produces the output level\nwhere price equals marginal revenue and equals marginal cost or it shuts down and only incurs its fixed costs.\nStep 7. For the output level where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost, check if the market price is\ngreater than the average variable cost of producing that output level.\n\u2022 If P > AVC but P < ATC, then the firm continues to produce in the short-run, making economic losses.\n\u2022 If P < AVC, then the firm stops producing and only incurs its fixed costs.\nIn this example, the price of $28 is greater than the AVC ($16.40) of producing 5 units of output, so the firm\ncontinues producing. 204 8 \u2022 Perfect Competition\n8.3Entry and Exit Decisions in the Long Run\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain how entry and exit lead to zero profits in the long run\n\u2022 Discuss the long-run adjustment process\nIt is impossible to precisely define the line between the short run and the long run with a stopwatch, or even\nwith a calendar. It varies according to the specific business. Therefore, the distinction between the short run\nand the long run is more technical: in the short run, firms cannot change the usage of fixed inputs, while in the\nlong run, the firm can adjust all factors of production.\nIn a competitive market, profits are a red cape that incites businesses to charge. If a business is making a profit\nin the short run, it has an incentive to expand existing factories or to build new ones. New firms may start\nproduction, as well. When new firms enter the industry in response to increased industry profits it is called\nentry.\nLosses are the black thundercloud that causes businesses to flee. If a business is making losses in the short\nrun, it will either keep limping along or just shut down, depending on whether its revenues are covering its\nvariable costs. But in the long run, firms that are facing losses will cease production altogether. The long-run\nprocess of reducing production in response to a sustained pattern of losses is calledexit. The following Clear It\nUp feature discusses where some of these losses might come from, and the reasons why some firms go out of\nbusiness.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhy do firms cease to exist?\nCan we say anything about what causes a firm to exit an industry? Profits are the measurement that determines\nwhether a business stays operating or not. Individuals start businesses with the purpose of making profits. They\ninvest their money, time, effort, and many other resources to produce and sell something that they hope will give\nthem something in return. Unfortunately, not all businesses are successful, and many new startups soon realize that\ntheir \u201cbusiness venture\u201d must eventually end.\nIn the model of perfectly competitive firms, those that consistently cannot make money will \u201cexit,\u201d which is a nice,\nbloodless word for a more painful process. When a business fails, after all, workers lose their jobs, investors lose\ntheir money, and owners and managers can lose their dreams. Many businesses fail. The U.S. Small Business\nAdministration indicates that in 2011, 534,907 new firms \"entered,\" and 575,691 firms failed.\nSometimes a business fails because of poor management or workers who are not very productive, or because of\ntough domestic or foreign competition. Businesses also fail from a variety of causes. For example, conditions of\ndemand and supply in the market may shift in an unexpected way, so that the prices that a business charges for\noutputs fall or the prices for inputs rise. With millions of businesses in the U.S. economy, even a small fraction of\nthem failing will affect many people\u2014and business failures can be very hard on the workers and managers directly\ninvolved. However, from the standpoint of the overall economic system, business exits are sometimes a necessary\nevil if a market-oriented system is going to offer a flexible mechanism for satisfying customers, keeping costs low,\nand inventing new products.\nHow Entry and Exit Lead to Zero Profits in the Long Run\nNoperfectly competitive firmacting alone can affect the market price. However, the combination of many\nfirms entering or exiting the market will affect overall supply in the market. In turn, a shift in supply for the\nmarket as a whole will affect the market price. Entry and exit to and from the market are the driving forces\nbehind a process that, in the long run, pushes the price down to minimum average total costs so that all firms\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.3 \u2022 Entry and Exit Decisions in the Long Run 205\nare earning a zero profit.\nTo understand how short-run profits for a perfectly competitive firm will evaporate in the long run, imagine\nthe following situation. The market is inlong-run equilibrium, where all firms earn zero economic profits\nproducing the output level where P = MR = MC and P = AC. No firm has the incentive to enter or leave the\nmarket. Let\u2019s say that the product\u2019s demand increases, and with that, the market price goes up. The existing\nfirms in the industry are now facing a higher price than before, so they will increase production to the new\noutput level where P = MR = MC.\nThis will temporarily make the market price rise above the minimum point on the average cost curve, and\ntherefore, the existing firms in the market will now be earning economic profits. However, these economic\nprofits attract other firms to enter the market. Entry of many new firms causes the market supply curve to shift\nto the right. As the supply curve shifts to the right, the market price starts decreasing, and with that, economic\nprofits fall for new and existing firms. As long as there are still profits in the market, entry will continue to shift\nsupply to the right. This will stop whenever the market price is driven down to the zero-profit level, where no\nfirm is earning economic profits.\nShort-run losses will fade away by reversing this process. Say that the market is in long-run equilibrium. This\ntime, instead, demand decreases, and with that, the market price starts falling. The existing firms in the\nindustry are now facing a lower price than before, and as it will be below the average cost curve, they will now\nbe making economic losses. Some firms will continue producing where the new P = MR = MC, as long as they\nare able to cover their average variable costs. Some firms will have to shut down immediately as they will not\nbe able to cover their average variable costs, and will then only incur their fixed costs, minimizing their losses.\nExit of many firms causes the market supply curve to shift to the left. As the supply curve shifts to the left, the\nmarket price starts rising, and economic losses start to be lower. This process ends whenever the market price\nrises to the zero-profit level, where the existing firms are no longer losing money and are at zero profits again.\nThus, while a perfectly competitive firm can earn profits in the short run, in the long run the process of entry\nwill push down prices until they reach the zero-profit level. Conversely, while a perfectly competitive firm may\nearn losses in the short run, firms will not continually lose money. In the long run, firms making losses are\nable to escape from their fixed costs, and their exit from the market will push the price back up to the zero-\nprofit level. In the long run, this process of entry and exit will drive the price in perfectly competitive markets\nto the zero-profit point at the bottom of the AC curve, where marginal cost crosses average cost.\nThe Long-Run Adjustment and Industry Types\nWhenever there are expansions in an industry, costs of production for the existing and new firms could either\nstay the same, increase, or even decrease. Therefore, we can categorize an industry as being (1) a constant-cost\nindustry (as demand increases, the cost of production for firms stays the same), (2) an increasing cost industry\n(as demand increases, the cost of production for firms increases), or (3) a decreasing cost industry (as demand\nincreases the costs of production for the firms decreases).\nFor aconstant-cost industry, whenever there is an increase in market demand and price, then the supply\ncurve shifts to the right with new firms\u2019 entry and stops at the point where the new long-run equilibrium\nintersects at the same market price as before. This is the case of constant returns to scale, which we discussed\nearlier in the chapter on Production, Costs, and Industry Structure. However, why will costs remain the same?\nIn this type of industry, the supply curve is very elastic. Firms can easily supply any quantity that consumers\ndemand. In addition, there is a perfectly elastic supply of inputs\u2014firms can easily increase their demand for\nemployees, for example, with no increase to wages. Tying in to our Bring it Home discussion, an increased\ndemand for ethanol in recent years has caused the demand for corn to increase. Consequently, many farmers\nswitched from growing wheat to growing corn. Agricultural markets are generally good examples of constant-\ncost industries.\nFor anincreasing cost industry, as the market expands, the old and new firms experience increases in their 206 8 \u2022 Perfect Competition\ncosts of production, which makes the new zero-profit level intersect at a higher price than before. Here\ncompanies may have to deal with limited inputs, such as skilled labor. As the demand for these workers rises,\nwages rise and this increases the cost of production for all firms. The industry supply curve in this type of\nindustry is more inelastic.\nFor adecreasing cost industry, as the market expands, the old and new firms experience lower costs of\nproduction, which makes the new zero-profit level intersect at a lower price than before. In this case, the\nindustry and all the firms in it are experiencing falling average total costs. This can be due to an improvement\nin technology in the entire industry or an increase in the education of employees. High-tech industries may be\na good example of a decreasing cost market.\nFigure 8.8(a) presents the case of an adjustment process in a constant-cost industry. Whenever there are\noutput expansions in this type of industry, the long-run outcome implies more output produced at exactly the\nsame original price. Note that supply was able to increase to meet the increased demand. When we join the\nbefore and after long-run equilibriums, the resulting line is the long run supply (LRS) curve in perfectly\ncompetitive markets. In this case, it is a flat curve.Figure 8.8(b) andFigure 8.8(c) present the cases for an\nincreasing cost and decreasing cost industry, respectively. For an increasing cost industry, the LRS is upward\nsloping, while for a decreasing cost industry, the LRS is downward sloping.\nFIGURE8.8Adjustment Process in a Constant-Cost IndustryIn (a), demand increased and supply met it. Notice\nthat the supply increase is equal to the demand increase. The result is that the equilibrium price stays the same as\nquantity sold increases. In (b), notice that sellers were not able to increase supply as much as demand. Some inputs\nwere scarce, or wages were rising. The equilibrium price rises. In (c), sellers easily increased supply in response to\nthe demand increase. Here, new technology or economies of scale caused the large increase in supply, resulting in\ndeclining equilibrium price.\n8.4Efficiency in Perfectly Competitive Markets\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Apply concepts of productive efficiency and allocative efficiency to perfectly competitive markets\n\u2022 Compare the model of perfect competition to real-world markets\nWhen profit-maximizing firms in perfectly competitive markets combine with utility-maximizing consumers,\nsomething remarkable happens: the resulting quantities of outputs of goods and services demonstrate both\nproductive and allocative efficiency (terms that we first introduced in (Choice in a World of Scarcity) .\nProductive efficiencymeans producing without waste, so that the choice is on the production possibility\nfrontier. In the long run in a perfectly competitive market, because of the process of entry and exit, the price in\nthe market is equal to the minimum of the long-run average cost curve. In other words, firms produce and sell\ngoods at the lowest possible average cost.\nAllocative efficiency means that among the points on the production possibility frontier, the chosen point is\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.4 \u2022 Efficiency in Perfectly Competitive Markets 207\nsocially preferred\u2014at least in a particular and specific sense. In a perfectly competitive market, price will be\nequal to the marginal cost of production. Think about the price that one pays for a good as a measure of the\nsocial benefit one receives for that good; after all, willingness to pay conveys what the good is worth to a buyer.\nThen think about the marginal cost of producing the good as representing not just the cost for the firm, but\nmore broadly as the social cost of producing that good. When perfectly competitive firms follow the rule that\nprofits are maximized by producing at the quantity where price is equal to marginal cost, they are thus\nensuring that the social benefits they receive from producing a good are in line with the social costs of\nproduction.\nTo explore what economists mean byallocative efficiency, it is useful to walk through an example. Begin by\nassuming that the market for wholesale flowers is perfectly competitive, and so P = MC. Now, consider what it\nwould mean if firms in that market produced a lesser quantity of flowers. At a lesser quantity, marginal costs\nwill not yet have increased as much, so that price will exceed marginal cost; that is, P > MC. In that situation,\nthe benefit to society as a whole of producing additional goods, as measured by the willingness of consumers\nto pay for marginal units of a good, would be higher than the cost of the inputs of labor and physical capital\nneeded to produce the marginal good. In other words, the gains to society as a whole from producing\nadditional marginal units will be greater than the costs.\nConversely, consider what it would mean if, compared to the level of output at the allocatively efficient choice\nwhen P = MC, firms produced a greater quantity of flowers. At a greater quantity, marginal costs of production\nwill have increased so that P < MC. In that case, the marginal costs of producing additional flowers is greater\nthan the benefit to society as measured by what people are willing to pay. For society as a whole, since the costs\nare outstripping the benefits, it will make sense to produce a lower quantity of such goods.\nWhen perfectly competitive firms maximize their profits by producing the quantity where P = MC, they also\nassure that the benefits to consumers of what they are buying, as measured by the price they are willing to pay,\nis equal to the costs to society of producing the marginal units, as measured by the marginal costs the firm\nmust pay\u2014and thus that allocative efficiency holds.\nWe should view the statements that a perfectly competitive market in the long run will feature both productive\nand allocative efficiency with a degree of skepticism about its truth. Remember, economists are using the\nconcept of \u201cefficiency\u201d in a particular and specific sense, not as a synonym for \u201cdesirable in every way.\u201d For\none thing, consumers\u2019 ability to pay reflects the income distribution in a particular society. For example, a\nperson with a low income may not be able to purchase their own car because they have insufficient income.\nPerfect competition, in the long run, is a hypothetical benchmark. For market structures such as monopoly,\nmonopolistic competition, and oligopoly, which are more frequently observed in the real world than perfect\ncompetition, firms will not always produce at the minimum of average cost, nor will they always set price equal\nto marginal cost. Thus, these other competitive situations will not produce productive and allocative efficiency.\nMoreover, real-world markets include many issues that are assumed away in the model of perfect competition,\nincluding pollution, inventions of new technology, poverty which may make some people unable to pay for\nbasic necessities of life, government programs like national defense or education, discrimination in labor\nmarkets, and buyers and sellers who must deal with imperfect and unclear information. We explore these\nissues in other chapters. However, the theoretical efficiency of perfect competition does provide a useful\nbenchmark for comparing the issues that arise from these real-world problems.\nBRING IT HOME\nA Dime a Dozen\nA quick glance atTable 8.12reveals the dramatic increase in North Dakota corn production\u2014almost a tenfold\nincrease since 1972. Recent allocation of land to corn (as of mid-2019) is estimated to have increased to more than 208 8 \u2022 Perfect Competition\n4 million acres. Taking into consideration that corn typically yields two to three times as many bushels per acre as\nwheat, it is obvious there has been a significant increase in bushels of corn.

If a perfectly competitive firm attempts to charge even a tiny amount more than the market price,\nit will be unable to make any sales. In a perfectly competitive market there are thousands of sellers, easy entry,\nand identical products. A short-run production period is when firms are producing with some fixed inputs.\nLong-run equilibrium in a perfectly competitive industry occurs after all firms have entered and exited the\nindustry and seller profits are driven to zero.\nPerfect competition means that there are many sellers, there is easy entry and exiting of firms, products are\nidentical from one seller to another, and sellers are price takers.\n8.2How Perfectly Competitive Firms Make Output Decisions\nAs a perfectly competitive firm produces a greater quantity of output, its total revenue steadily increases at a\nconstant rate determined by the given market price. Profits will be highest (or losses will be smallest) at the\nquantity of output where total revenues exceed total costs by the greatest amount (or where total revenues fall\nshort of total costs by the smallest amount). Alternatively, profits will be highest where marginal revenue,\nwhich is price for a perfectly competitive firm, is equal to marginal cost. If the market price faced by a perfectly\ncompetitive firm is above average cost at the profit-maximizing quantity of output, then the firm is making\nprofits. If the market price is below average cost at the profit-maximizing quantity of output, then the firm is\nmaking losses.\nIf the market price is equal to average cost at the profit-maximizing level of output, then the firm is making\nzero profits. We call the point where the marginal cost curve crosses the average cost curve, at the minimum of\nthe average cost curve, the \u201czero profit point.\u201d If the market price that a perfectly competitive firm faces is\nbelow average variable cost at the profit-maximizing quantity of output, then the firm should shut down\noperations immediately. If the market price that a perfectly competitive firm faces is above average variable\ncost, but below average cost, then the firm should continue producing in the short run, but exit in the long run.\nWe call the point where the marginal cost curve crosses the average variable cost curve the shutdown point.\n8.3Entry and Exit Decisions in the Long Run\nIn the long run, firms will respond to profits through a process of entry, where existing firms expand output\nand new firms enter the market. Conversely, firms will react to losses in the long run through a process of exit,\nin which existing firms cease production altogether. Through the process of entry in response to profits and\nexit in response to losses, the price level in a perfectly competitive market will move toward the zero-profit 210 8 \u2022 Self-Check Questions\npoint, where the marginal cost curve crosses the AC curve at the minimum of the average cost curve.\nThe long-run supply curve shows the long-run output supplied by firms in three different types of industries:\nconstant cost, increasing cost, and decreasing cost.\n8.4Efficiency in Perfectly Competitive Markets\nLong-run equilibrium in perfectly competitive markets meets two important conditions: allocative efficiency\nand productive efficiency. These two conditions have important implications. First, resources are allocated to\ntheir best alternative use. Second, they provide the maximum satisfaction attainable by society.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1. Firms in a perfectly competitive market are said to be \u201cprice takers\u201d\u2014that is, once the market determines\nan equilibrium price for the product, firms must accept this price.

These states attempted\nto leverage this economic power into political power\u2014trying to sway Great Britain to formally recognize the\nConfederate States of America. (Credit: modification of \"cotton!\" by ashley/Flickr, CC BY 2.0)\nCHAPTER OBJECTIVES\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\u2022 How Monopolies form: Barriers to Entry\n\u2022 How a Profit-Maximizing Monopoly Chooses Output and Price\nIntroduction to a Monopoly\nBRING IT HOME\nThe Rest is History\nMany of the opening case studies have focused on current events. This one steps into the past to observe how\nmonopoly, or near monopolies, have helped shape history. In spring 1773, the East India Company, a firm that, in its\ntime, was designated \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d was experiencing financial difficulties. To help shore up the failing firm, the\nBritish Parliament authorized the Tea Act. The act continued the tax on teas and made the East India Company the\nsole legal supplier of tea to the American colonies. By November, the citizens of Boston had had enough. They\nrefused to permit the unloading of tea, citing their main complaint: \u201cNo taxation without representation.\u201d Several\nnewspapers, includingThe Massachusetts Gazette, warned arriving tea-bearing ships, \u201cWe are prepared, and shall\nnot fail to pay them an unwelcome visit by The Mohawks.\u201d 216 9 \u2022 Monopoly\nStep forward in time to 1860\u2014the eve of the American Civil War\u2014to another near monopoly supplier of historical\nsignificance: the U.S. cotton industry. At that time, the Southern states provided the majority of the cotton Britain\nimported. The South, wanting to secede from the Union, hoped to leverage Britain\u2019s high dependency on its cotton\ninto formal diplomatic recognition of the Confederate States of America.\nThis leads us to this chapter's topic: a firm that controls all (or nearly all) of the supply of a good or service\u2014a\nmonopoly. How do monopoly firms behave in the marketplace? Do they have \u201cpower?\u201d Does this power potentially\nhave unintended consequences? We\u2019ll return to this case at the end of the chapter to see how the tea and cotton\nmonopolies influenced U.S. history.\nMany believe that top executives at firms are the strongest supporters of market competition, but this belief is\nfar from the truth. Think about it this way: If you very much wanted to win an Olympic gold medal, would you\nrather be far better than everyone else, or locked in competition with many athletes just as good as you?\nSimilarly, if you would like to attain a very high level of profits, would you rather manage a business with little\nor no competition, or struggle against many tough competitors who are trying to sell to your customers? By\nnow, you might have read the chapter onPerfect Competition. In this chapter, we explore the opposite extreme:\nmonopoly.\nIf perfect competition is a market where firms have no market power and they simply respond to the market\nprice, monopoly is a market with no competition at all, and firms have a great deal of market power. In the case\nofmonopoly, one firm produces all of the output in a market. Since a monopoly faces no significant\ncompetition, it can charge any price it wishes, subject to the demand curve. While a monopoly, by definition,\nrefers to a single firm, in practice people often use the term to describe a market in which one firm merely has\na very high market share. This tends to be the definition that the U.S. Department of Justice uses.\nEven though there are very few true monopolies in existence, we do deal with some of those few every day,\noften without realizing it: The U.S. Postal Service, your electric, and garbage collection companies are a few\nexamples. Some new drugs are produced by only one pharmaceutical firm\u2014and no close substitutes for that\ndrug may exist.\nFrom the mid-1990s until 2004, the U.S. Department of Justice prosecuted the Microsoft Corporation for\nincluding Internet Explorer as the default web browser with its operating system. The Justice Department\u2019s\nargument was that, since Microsoft possessed an extremely high market share in the industry for operating\nsystems, the inclusion of a free web browser constituted unfair competition to other browsers, such as\nNetscape Navigator. Since nearly everyone was using Windows, including Internet Explorer eliminated the\nincentive for consumers to explore other browsers and made it impossible for competitors to gain a foothold in\nthe market. In 2013, the Windows system ran on more than 90% of the most commonly sold personal\ncomputers. In 2015, a U.S. federal court tossed out antitrust charges that Google had an agreement with mobile\ndevice makers to set Google as the default search engine.\nThis chapter begins by describing how monopolies are protected from competition, including laws that\nprohibit competition, technological advantages, and certain configurations of demand and supply. It then\ndiscusses how a monopoly will choose its profit-maximizing quantity to produce and what price to charge.\nWhile a monopoly must be concerned about whether consumers will purchase its products or spend their\nmoney on something altogether different, the monopolist need not worry about the actions of other competing\nfirms producing its products. As a result, a monopoly is not a price taker like a perfectly competitive firm, but\ninstead exercises some power to choose its market price.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 9.1 \u2022 How Monopolies Form: Barriers to Entry 217\n9.1How Monopolies Form: Barriers to Entry\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Distinguish between a natural monopoly and a legal monopoly.\n\u2022 Explain how economies of scale and the control of natural resources led to the necessary formation of legal\nmonopolies\n\u2022 Analyze the importance of trademarks and patents in promoting innovation\n\u2022 Identify examples of predatory pricing\nBecause of the lack of competition, monopolies tend to earn significant economic profits. These profits should\nattract vigorous competition as we described inPerfect Competition, and yet, because of one particular\ncharacteristic of monopoly, they do not.Barriers to entryare the legal, technological, or market forces that\ndiscourage or prevent potential competitors from entering a market. Barriers to entry can range from the\nsimple and easily surmountable, such as the cost of renting retail space, to the extremely restrictive. For\nexample, there are a finite number of radio frequencies available for broadcasting. Once an entrepreneur or\nfirm has purchased the rights to all of them, no new competitors can enter the market.\nIn some cases, barriers to entry may lead to monopoly. In other cases, they may limit competition to a few\nfirms. Barriers may block entry even if the firm or firms currently in the market are earning profits. Thus, in\nmarkets with significant barriers to entry, it isnotnecessarily true that abnormally high profits will attract new\nfirms, and that this entry of new firms will eventually cause the price to decline so that surviving firms earn\nonly a normal level of profit in the long run.\nThere are five types of monopoly, based on the types of barriers to entry they exploit.\nNatural Monopoly\nEconomies of scalecan combine with the size of the market to limit competition. (We introduced this theme in\nProduction, Cost and Industry Structure).Figure 9.2presents a long-run average cost curve for the airplane\nmanufacturing industry. It shows economies of scale up to an output of 8,000 planes per year and a price of P ,\n0\nthen constant returns to scale from 8,000 to 20,000 planes per year, and diseconomies of scale at a quantity of\nproduction greater than 20,000 planes per year.\nNow consider the market demand curve in the diagram, which intersects the long-run average cost (LRAC)\ncurve at an output level of 5,000 planes per year and at a price P , which is higher than P . In this situation, the\n1 0\nmarket has room for only one producer. If a second firm attempts to enter the market at a smaller size, say by\nproducing a quantity of 4,000 planes, then its average costs will be higher than those of the existing firm, and it\nwill be unable to compete. If the second firm attempts to enter the market at a larger size, like 8,000 planes per\nyear, then it could produce at a lower average cost\u2014but it could not sell all 8,000 planes that it produced\nbecause of insufficient demand in the market. 218 9 \u2022 Monopoly\nFIGURE9.2Economies of Scale and Natural MonopolyIn this market, the demand curve intersects the long-run\naverage cost (LRAC) curve at its downward-sloping part. A natural monopoly occurs when the quantity demanded is\nless than the minimum quantity it takes to be at the bottom of the long-run average cost curve.\nEconomists call this situation, when economies of scale are large relative to the quantity demanded in the\nmarket, a natural monopoly. Natural monopolies often arise in industries where the marginal cost of adding an\nadditional customer is very low, once the fixed costs of the overall system are in place. This results in situations\nwhere there are substantial economies of scale. For example, once a water company lays the main water pipes\nthrough a neighborhood, the marginal cost of providing water service to another home is fairly low. Once the\nelectric company installs lines in a new subdivision, the marginal cost of providing additional electrical service\nto one more home is minimal. It would be costly and duplicative for a second water company to enter the\nmarket and invest in a whole second set of main water pipes, or for a second electricity company to enter the\nmarket and invest in a whole new set of electrical wires. These industries offer an example where, because of\neconomies of scale, one producer can serve the entire market more efficiently than a number of smaller\nproducers that would need to make duplicate physical capital investments.\nA natural monopoly can also arise in smaller local markets for products that are difficult to transport. For\nexample, cement production exhibits economies of scale, and the quantity of cement demanded in a local area\nmay not be much larger than what a single plant can produce. Moreover, the costs of transporting cement over\nland are high, and so a cement plant in an area without access to water transportation may be a natural\nmonopoly.\nControl of a Physical Resource\nAnother type of monopoly occurs when a company has control of a scarce physical resource. In the U.S.\neconomy, one historical example of this pattern occurred when ALCOA\u2014the Aluminum Company of\nAmerica\u2014controlled most of the supply of bauxite, a key mineral used in making aluminum. Back in the\n1930s, when ALCOA controlled most of the bauxite, other firms were simply unable to produce enough\naluminum to compete.\nAs another example, the majority of global diamond production is controlled by DeBeers, a multi-national\ncompany that has mining and production operations in South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, and Canada. It also\nhas exploration activities on four continents, while directing a worldwide distribution network of rough cut\ndiamonds. Although in recent years they have experienced growing competition, their impact on the rough\nAccess for free at openstax.org 9.1 \u2022 How Monopolies Form: Barriers to Entry 219\ndiamond market is still considerable.\nLegal Monopoly\nFor some products, the government erects barriers to entry by prohibiting or limiting competition. Under U.S.\nlaw, no organization but the U.S. Postal Service is legally allowed to deliver first-class mail. Many states or cities\nhave laws or regulations that allow households a choice of only one electric company, one water company, and\none company to pick up the garbage. Most legal monopolies are utilities\u2014products necessary for everyday\nlife\u2014that are socially beneficial. As a consequence, the government allows producers to become regulated\nmonopolies, to ensure that customers have access to an appropriate amount of these products or services.\nAdditionally, legal monopolies are often subject to economies of scale, so it makes sense to allow only one\nprovider.\nPromoting Innovation\nInnovation takes time and resources to achieve. Suppose a company invests in research and development and\nfinds the cure for the common cold. In this world of near ubiquitous information, other companies could take\nthe formula, produce the drug, and because they did not incur the costs of research and development (R&D),\nundercut the price of the company that discovered the drug. Given this possibility, many firms would choose\nnot to invest in research and development, and as a result, the world would have less innovation. To prevent\nthis from happening, the Constitution of the United States specifies in Article I, Section 8: \u201cThe Congress shall\nhave Power . . . to Promote the Progress of Science and Useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors\nand Inventors the Exclusive Right to their Writings and Discoveries.\u201d Congress used this power to create the\nU.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as well as the U.S. Copyright Office. Apatentgives the inventor the exclusive\nlegal right to make, use, or sell the invention for a limited time. In the United States, exclusive patent rights last\nfor 20 years. The idea is to provide limited monopoly power so that innovative firms can recoup their\ninvestment in R&D, but then to allow other firms to produce the product more cheaply once the patent expires.\nAtrademarkis an identifying symbol or name for a particular good, like Chiquita bananas, Chevrolet cars, or\nthe Nike \u201cswoosh\u201d that appears on shoes and athletic gear. Between 2003 and 2019, roughly 6.8 million\ntrademarks were registered with the U.S. government. A firm can renew a trademark repeatedly, as long as it\nremains in active use.\nAcopyright, according to the U.S. Copyright Office, \u201cis a form of protection provided by the laws of the United\nStates for \u2018original works of authorship\u2019 including literary, dramatic, musical, architectural, cartographic,\nchoreographic, pantomimic, pictorial, graphic, sculptural, and audiovisual creations.\u201d No one can reproduce,\ndisplay, or perform a copyrighted work without the author's permission. Copyright protection ordinarily lasts\nfor the life of the author plus 70 years.\nRoughly speaking, patent law covers inventions and copyright protects books, songs, and art. However, in\ncertain areas, like the invention of new software, it has been unclear whether patent or copyright protection\nshould apply. There is also a body of law known astrade secrets. Even if a company does not have a patent on\nan invention, competing firms are not allowed to steal their secrets. One famous trade secret is the formula for\nCoca-Cola, which is not protected under copyright or patent law, but is simply kept secret by the company.\nTaken together, we call this combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secret lawintellectual\nproperty, because it implies ownership over an idea, concept, or image, not a physical piece of property like a\nhouse or a car. Countries around the world have enacted laws to protect intellectual property, although the\ntime periods and exact provisions of such laws vary across countries. There are ongoing negotiations, both\nthrough the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and through international treaties, to bring\ngreater harmony to the intellectual property laws of different countries to determine the extent to which those\nin other countries will respect patents and copyrights of those in other countries.\nGovernment limitations on competition used to be more common in the United States. For most of the 220 9 \u2022 Monopoly\ntwentieth century, only one phone company\u2014AT&T\u2014was legally allowed to provide local and long distance\nservice. From the 1930s to the 1970s, one set of federal regulations limited which destinations airlines could\nchoose to fly to and what fares they could charge. Another set of regulations limited the interest rates that\nbanks could pay to depositors; yet another specified how much trucking firms could charge customers.\nWhat products we consider utilities depends, in part, on the available technology. Fifty years ago, telephone\ncompanies provided local and long distance service over wires. It did not make much sense to have many\ncompanies building multiple wiring systems across towns and the entire country. AT&T lost its monopoly on\nlong distance service when the technology for providing phone service changed from wires to microwave and\nsatellite transmission, so that multiple firms could use the same transmission mechanism. The same thing\nhappened to local service, especially in recent years, with the growth in cellular phone systems.\nThe combination of improvements in production technologies and a general sense that the markets could\nprovide services adequately led to a wave ofderegulation, starting in the late 1970s and continuing into the\n1990s. This wave eliminated or reduced government restrictions on the firms that could enter, the prices that\nthey could charge, and the quantities that many industries could produce, including telecommunications,\nairlines, trucking, banking, and electricity.\nAround the world, from Europe to Latin America to Africa and Asia, many governments continue to control\nand limit competition in what those governments perceive to be key industries, including airlines, banks, steel\ncompanies, oil companies, and telephone companies.\nLINK IT UP\nVist thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/patents)for examples of some pretty bizarre patents.\nIntimidating Potential Competition\nBusinesses have developed a number of schemes for creating barriers to entry by deterring potential\ncompetitors from entering the market. One method is known aspredatory pricing, in which a firm uses the\nthreat of sharp price cuts to discourage competition. Predatory pricing is a violation of U.S. antitrust law, but it\nis difficult to prove.\nConsider a large airline that provides most of the flights between two particular cities. A new, small start-up\nairline decides to offer service between these two cities. The large airline immediately slashes prices on this\nroute to the bone, so that the new entrant cannot make any money. After the new entrant has gone out of\nbusiness, the incumbent firm can raise prices again.\nAfter the company repeats this pattern once or twice, potential new entrants may decide that it is not wise to\ntry to compete. Small airlines often accuse larger airlines of predatory pricing: in the early 2000s, for example,\nValuJet accused Delta of predatory pricing, Frontier accused United, and Reno Air accused Northwest. In 2015,\nthe Justice Department ruled against American Express and Mastercard for imposing restrictions on retailers\nthat encouraged customers to use lower swipe fees on credit transactions.\nIn some cases, large advertising budgets can also act as a way of discouraging the competition. If the only way\nto launch a successful new national cola drink is to spend more than the promotional budgets of Coca-Cola and\nPepsi Cola, not too many companies will try. A firmly established brand name can be difficult to dislodge.\nSumming Up Barriers to Entry\nTable 9.1lists the barriers to entry that we have discussed. This list is not exhaustive, since firms have proved\nto be highly creative in inventing business practices that discourage competition. When barriers to entry exist,\nperfect competition is no longer a reasonable description of how an industry works. When barriers to entry are\nhigh enough, monopoly can result.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 9.2 \u2022 How a Profit-Maximizing Monopoly Chooses Output and Price 221\nBarrier to Entry Government Role?

How will this monopoly choose its profit-maximizing quantity of output, and what price\nwill it charge? Profits for the monopolist, like any firm, will be equal to total revenues minus total costs. We can\nanalyze the pattern of costs for the monopoly within the same framework as the costs of aperfectly\ncompetitive firm\u2014that is, by using total cost, fixed cost, variable cost, marginal cost, average cost, and average\nvariable cost. However, because a monopoly faces no competition, its situation and its decision process will\ndiffer from that of a perfectly competitive firm. (The Clear It Up feature discusses how hard it is sometimes to\ndefine \u201cmarket\u201d in a monopoly situation.)\nDemand Curves Perceived by a Perfectly Competitive Firm and by a Monopoly\nA perfectly competitive firm acts as a price taker, so we calculate total revenue taking the given market price\nand multiplying it by the quantity of output that the firm chooses. The demand curveas it is perceived by a\nperfectly competitive firmappears inFigure 9.3(a). The flat perceived demand curve means that, from the\nviewpoint of the perfectly competitive firm, it could sell either a relatively low quantity like Ql or a relatively\nhigh quantity like Qh at the market price P. 222 9 \u2022 Monopoly\nFIGURE9.3The Perceived Demand Curve for a Perfect Competitor and a Monopolist(a) A perfectly competitive\nfirm perceives the demand curve that it faces to be flat. The flat shape means that the firm can sell either a low\nquantity (Ql) or a high quantity (Qh) at exactly the same price (P). (b) A monopolist perceives the demand curve that\nit faces to be the same as the market demand curve, which for most goods is downward-sloping. Thus, if the\nmonopolist chooses a high level of output (Qh), it can charge only a relatively low price (PI). Conversely, if the\nmonopolist chooses a low level of output (Ql), it can then charge a higher price (Ph). The challenge for the\nmonopolist is to choose the combination of price and quantity that maximizes profits.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat defines the market?\nA monopoly is a firm that sells all or nearly all of the goods and services in a given market. However, what defines\nthe \u201cmarket\u201d?\nIn a famous 1947 case, the federal government accused the DuPont company of having a monopoly in the\ncellophane market, pointing out that DuPont produced 75% of the cellophane in the United States. DuPont\ncountered that even though it had a 75% market share in cellophane, it had less than a 20% share of the \u201cflexible\npackaging materials,\u201d which includes all other moisture-proof papers, films, and foils. In 1956, after years of legal\nappeals, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the broader market definition was more appropriate, and it dismissed the\ncase against DuPont.\nQuestions over how to define the market continue today. True, Microsoft in the 1990s had a dominant share of the\nsoftware for computer operating systems, but in the total market for all computer software and services, including\neverything from games to scientific programs, the Microsoft share was only about 14% in 2014. The Greyhound bus\ncompany may have a near-monopoly on the market for intercity bus transportation, but it is only a small share of the\nmarket for intercity transportation if that market includes private cars, airplanes, and railroad service. DeBeers has a\nmonopoly in diamonds, but it is a much smaller share of the total market for precious gemstones and an even\nsmaller share of the total market for jewelry. A small town in the country may have only one gas station: is this gas\nstation a \u201cmonopoly,\u201d or does it compete with gas stations that might be five, 10, or 50 miles away?\nIn general, if a firm produces a product without close substitutes, then we can consider the firm a monopoly\nproducer in a single market. However, if buyers have a range of similar\u2014even if not identical\u2014options available from\nother firms, then the firm is not a monopoly. Still, arguments over whether substitutes are close or not close can be\ncontroversial.\nWhile a monopolist can chargeanyprice for its product, nonetheless the demand for the firm\u2019s product\nconstrains the price. No monopolist, even one that is thoroughly protected by high barriers to entry, can\nAccess for free at openstax.org 9.2 \u2022 How a Profit-Maximizing Monopoly Chooses Output and Price 223\nrequire consumers to purchase its product. Because the monopolist is the only firm in the market, its demand\ncurve is the same as the market demand curve, which is, unlike that for a perfectly competitive firm,\ndownward-sloping.\nFigure 9.3illustrates this situation. The monopolist can either choose a point like R with a low price (Pl) and\nhigh quantity (Qh), or a point like S with a high price (Ph) and a low quantity (Ql), or some intermediate point.\nSetting the price too high will result in a low quantity sold, and will not bring in much revenue. Conversely,\nsetting the price too low may result in a high quantity sold, but because of the low price, it will not bring in\nmuch revenue either. The challenge for the monopolist is to strike a profit-maximizing balance between the\nprice it charges and the quantity that it sells. However, why isn\u2019t the perfectly competitive firm\u2019s demand curve\nalso the market demand curve? See the following Clear It Up feature for the answer to this question.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat is the difference between perceived demand and market demand?\nThe demand curve as perceived by a perfectly competitive firm is not the overall market demand curve for that\nproduct. However, the firm\u2019s demand curve as perceived by a monopoly is the same as the market demand curve.\nThe reason for the difference is that each perfectly competitive firm perceives the demand for its products in a\nmarket that includes many other firms. In effect, the demand curve perceived by a perfectly competitive firm is a\ntiny slice of the entire market demand curve. In contrast, a monopoly perceives demand for its product in a market\nwhere the monopoly is the only producer.\nTotal Cost and Total Revenue for a Monopolist\nWe can illustrate profits for a monopolist with a graph of total revenues and total costs, with the example of the\nhypothetical HealthPill firm inFigure 9.4. The total cost curve has its typical shape that we learned about in\nProduction, Costs and Industry Structure, and that we used inPerfect Competition; that is, total costs rise and\nthe curve grows steeper as output increases, as the final column ofTable 9.2shows.\nFIGURE9.4Total Revenue and Total Cost for the HealthPill MonopolyTotal revenue for the monopoly firm called\nHealthPill first rises, then falls. Low levels of output bring in relatively little total revenue, because the quantity is\nlow. High levels of output bring in relatively less revenue, because the high quantity pushes down the market price.\nThe total cost curve is upward-sloping. Profits will be highest at the quantity of output where total revenue is most\nabove total cost. The profit-maximizing level of output is not the same as the revenue-maximizing level of output,\nwhich should make sense, because profits take costs into account and revenues do not. 224 9 \u2022 Monopoly\nQuantity Price Total Revenue Total Cost\nQ P TR TC\n1 1,200 1,200 500\n2 1,100 2,200 750\n3 1,000 3,000 1,000\n4 900 3,600 1,250\n5 800 4,000 1,650\n6 700 4,200 2,500\n7 600 4,200 4,000\n8 500 4,000 6,400\nTABLE9.2Total Costs and Total Revenues of\nHealthPill\nTotal revenue, though, is different. Since a monopolist faces a downward sloping demand curve, the only way it\ncan sell more output is by reducing its price. Selling more output raises revenue, but lowering price reduces it.\nThus, the shape of total revenue isn\u2019t clear. Let\u2019s explore this using the data inTable 9.2, which shows\nquantities along the demand curve and the price at each quantity demanded, and then calculates total revenue\nby multiplying price times quantity at each level of output. (In this example, we give the output as 1, 2, 3, 4, and\nso on, for the sake of simplicity. If you prefer a dash of greater realism, you can imagine that the\npharmaceutical company measures these output levels and the corresponding prices per 1,000 or 10,000\npills.) As the figure illustrates, total revenue for a monopolist has the shape of a hill, first rising, next flattening\nout, and then falling. In this example, total revenue is highest at a quantity of 6 or 7.\nHowever, the monopolist is not seeking to maximize revenue, but instead to earn the highest possible profit. In\nthe HealthPill example inFigure 9.4, the highest profit will occur at the quantity where total revenue is the\nfarthest above total cost. This looks to be somewhere in the middle of the graph, but where exactly? It is easier\nto see the profit maximizing level of output by using the marginal approach, to which we turn next.\nMarginal Revenue and Marginal Cost for a Monopolist\nIn the real world, a monopolist often does not have enough information to analyze its entire total revenues or\ntotal costs curves. After all, the firm does not know exactly what would happen if it were to alter production\ndramatically. However, a monopolist often has fairly reliable information about how changing output by small\nor moderate amounts will affect its marginal revenues and marginal costs, because it has had experience with\nsuch changes over time and because modest changes are easier to extrapolate from current experience. A\nmonopolist can use information onmarginal revenueandmarginal costto seek out the profit-maximizing\ncombination of quantity and price.\nTable 9.3expandsTable 9.2using the figures on total costs and total revenues from the HealthPill example to\ncalculate marginal revenue and marginal cost. This monopoly faces typical upward-sloping marginal cost and\ndownward-sloping marginal revenue curves, asFigure 9.5shows.\nNotice that marginal revenue is zero at a quantity of 7, and turns negative at quantities higher than 7. It may\nseem counterintuitive that marginal revenue could ever be zero or negative: after all, doesn't an increase in\nquantity sold not always mean more revenue? For a perfect competitor, each additional unit sold brought a\nAccess for free at openstax.org 9.2 \u2022 How a Profit-Maximizing Monopoly Chooses Output and Price 225\npositive marginal revenue, because marginal revenue was equal to the given market price. However, a\nmonopolist can sell a larger quantity and see a decline intotal revenue. When a monopolist increases sales by\none unit, it gains some marginal revenue from selling that extra unit, but also loses some marginal revenue\nbecause it must now sell every other unit at a lower price. As the quantity sold becomes higher, at some point\nthe drop in price is proportionally more than the increase in greater quantity of sales, causing a situation\nwhere more sales bring in less revenue. In other words, marginal revenue is negative.\nFIGURE9.5Marginal Revenue and Marginal Cost for the HealthPill MonopolyFor a monopoly like HealthPill,\nmarginal revenue decreases as it sells additional units of output. The marginal cost curve is upward-sloping. The\nprofit-maximizing choice for the monopoly will be to produce at the quantity where marginal revenue is equal to\nmarginal cost: that is, MR = MC. If the monopoly produces a lower quantity, then MR > MC at those levels of output,\nand the firm can make higher profits by expanding output. If the firm produces at a greater quantity, then MC > MR,\nand the firm can make higher profits by reducing its quantity of output.\nQuantity Total Revenue Marginal Revenue Total Cost Marginal Cost\nQ TR MR TC MC\n1 1,200 1,200 500 500\n2 2,200 1,000 775 275\n3 3,000 800 1,000 225\n4 3,600 600 1,250 250\n5 4,000 400 1,650 400\n6 4,200 200 2,500 850\n7 4,200 0 4,000 1,500\n8 4,000 \u2013200 6,400 2,400\nTABLE9.3Costs and Revenues of HealthPill\nA monopolist can determine its profit-maximizing price and quantity by analyzing the marginal revenue and\nmarginal costs of producing an extra unit. If the marginal revenue exceeds the marginal cost, then the firm\nshould produce the extra unit.\nFor example, at an output of 4 inFigure 9.5, marginal revenue is 600 and marginal cost is 250, so producing\nthis unit will clearly add to overall profits. At an output of 5, marginal revenue is 400 and marginal cost is 400, 226 9 \u2022 Monopoly\nso producing this unit still means overall profits are unchanged. However, expanding output from 5 to 6 would\ninvolve a marginal revenue of 200 and a marginal cost of 850, so that sixth unit would actually reduce profits.\nThus, the monopoly can tell from the marginal revenue and marginal cost that of the choices in the table, the\nprofit-maximizing level of output is 5.\nThe monopoly could seek out the profit-maximizing level of output by increasing quantity by a small amount,\ncalculating marginal revenue and marginal cost, and then either increasing output as long as marginal\nrevenue exceeds marginal cost or reducing output if marginal cost exceeds marginal revenue. This process\nworks without any need to calculate total revenue and total cost. Thus, a profit-maximizing monopoly should\nfollow the rule of producing up to the quantity where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost\u2014that is, MR =\nMC. This quantity is easy to identify graphically, where MR and MC intersect.\nWORK IT OUT\nMaximizing Profits\nIf you find it counterintuitive that producing where marginal revenue equals marginal cost will maximize profits,\nworking through the numbers will help.\nStep 1. Remember, we define marginal cost as the change in total cost from producing a small amount of\nadditional output.\nStep 2. Note that inTable 9.3, as output increases from 1 to 2 units, total cost increases from $500 to $775. As a\nresult, the marginal cost of the second unit will be:\nStep 3. Remember that, similarly, marginal revenue is the change in total revenue from selling a small amount of\nadditional output.\nStep 4. Note that inTable 9.3, as output increases from 1 to 2 units, total revenue increases from $1200 to\n$2200. As a result, the marginal revenue of the second unit will be:\nQuantity Marginal Revenue Marginal Cost Marginal Profit Total Profit\nQ MR MC MP P\n1 1,200 500 700 700\n2 1,000 275 725 1,425\n3 800 225 575 2,000\n4 600 250 350 2,350\nTABLE9.4Marginal Revenue, Marginal Cost, Marginal and Total Profit\nAccess for free at openstax.org 9.2 \u2022 How a Profit-Maximizing Monopoly Chooses Output and Price 227\nQuantity Marginal Revenue Marginal Cost Marginal Profit Total Profit\nQ MR MC MP P\n5 400 400 0 2,350\n6 200 850 \u2212650 1,700\n7 0 1,500 \u22121,500 200\n8 \u2212200 2,400 \u22122,600 \u22122,400\nTABLE9.4Marginal Revenue, Marginal Cost, Marginal and Total Profit\nTable 9.4repeats the marginal cost and marginal revenue data fromTable 9.3, and adds two more columns:\nMarginal profitis the profitability of each additional unit sold. We define it as marginal revenue minus marginal\ncost. Finally,total profitis the sum of marginal profits. As long as marginal profit is positive, producing more\noutput will increase total profits. When marginal profit turns negative, producing more output will decrease total\nprofits. Total profit is maximized where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. In this example, maximum profit\noccurs at 5 units of output.\nA perfectly competitive firm will also find its profit-maximizing level of output where MR = MC. The key difference\nwith a perfectly competitive firm is that in the case of perfect competition, marginal revenue is equal to price (MR\n= P), while for a monopolist, marginal revenue is not equal to the price, because changes in quantity of output\naffect the price.\nIllustrating Monopoly Profits\nIt is straightforward to calculate profits of given numbers for total revenue and total cost. However, the size of\nmonopoly profits can also be illustrated graphically withFigure 9.6, which takes the marginal cost and\nmarginal revenue curves from the previous exhibit and adds an average cost curve and the monopolist\u2019s\nperceived demand curve.Table 9.5shows the data for these curves.\nQuantity Demand Marginal Revenue Marginal Cost Average Cost\nQ P MR MC AC\n1 1,200 1,200 500 500\n2 1,100 1,000 275 388\n3 1,000 800 225 333\n4 900 600 250 313\n5 800 400 400 330\n6 700 200 850 417\n7 600 0 1,500 571\n8 500 \u2013200 2,400 800\nTABLE9.5 228 9 \u2022 Monopoly\nFIGURE9.6Illustrating Profits at the HealthPill MonopolyThis figure begins with the same marginal revenue and\nmarginal cost curves from the HealthPill monopoly fromFigure 9.5. It then adds an average cost curve and the\ndemand curve that the monopolist faces. The HealthPill firm first chooses the quantity where MR = MC. In this\nexample, the quantity is 5. The monopolist then decides what price to charge by looking at the demand curve it\nfaces. The large box, with quantity on the horizontal axis and demand (which shows the price) on the vertical axis,\nshows total revenue for the firm. The lighter-shaded box, which is quantity on the horizontal axis and average cost of\nproduction on the vertical axis shows the firm's total costs. The large total revenue box minus the smaller total cost\nbox leaves the darkly shaded box that shows total profits. Since the price charged is above average cost, the firm is\nearning positive profits.\nFigure 9.7illustrates the three-step process where a monopolist: selects the profit-maximizing quantity to\nproduce; decides what price to charge; determines total revenue, total cost, and profit.\nStep 1: The Monopolist Determines Its Profit-Maximizing Level of Output\nThe firm can use the points on the demand curve D to calculate total revenue, and then, based on total\nrevenue, calculate its marginal revenue curve. The profit-maximizing quantity will occur where MR = MC\u2014or at\nthe last possible point before marginal costs start exceeding marginal revenue. OnFigure 9.6, MR = MC occurs\nat an output of 5.\nStep 2: The Monopolist Decides What Price to Charge\nThe monopolist will charge what the market is willing to pay. A dotted line drawn straight up from the profit-\nmaximizing quantity to the demand curve shows the profit-maximizing price which, inFigure 9.6, is $800.\nThis price is above the average cost curve, which shows that the firm is earning profits.\nStep 3: Calculate Total Revenue, Total Cost, and Profit\nTotal revenue is the overall shaded box, where the width of the box is the quantity sold and the height is the\nprice. InFigure 9.6, this is 5 x $800 = $4000. InFigure 9.6, the bottom part of the shaded box, which is shaded\nmore lightly, shows total costs; that is, quantity on the horizontal axis multiplied by average cost on the vertical\naxis or 5 x $330 = $1650. The larger box of total revenues minus the smaller box of total costs will equal profits,\nwhich the darkly shaded box shows. Using the numbers gives $4000 - $1650 = $2350. In a perfectly\ncompetitive market, the forces of entry would erode this profit in the long run. However, a monopolist is\nprotected by barriers to entry. In fact, one obvious sign of a possible monopoly is when a firm earns profits\nyear after year, while doing more or less the same thing, without ever seeing increased competition eroding\nthose profits.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 9.2 \u2022 How a Profit-Maximizing Monopoly Chooses Output and Price 229\nFIGURE9.7How a Profit-Maximizing Monopoly Decides PriceIn Step 1, the monopoly chooses the profit-\nmaximizing level of output Q , by choosing the quantity where MR = MC. In Step 2, the monopoly decides how much\n1\nto charge for output level Q by drawing a line straight up from Q to point R on its perceived demand curve. Thus,\n1 1\nthe monopoly will charge a price (P ). In Step 3, the monopoly identifies its profit. Total revenue will be Q multiplied\n1 1\nby P . Total cost will be Q multiplied by the average cost of producing Q , which point S shows on the average cost\n1 1 1\ncurve to be P . Profits will be the total revenue rectangle minus the total cost rectangle, which the shaded zone in\n2\nthe figure shows.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhy is a monopolist\u2019s marginal revenue always less than the price?\nThe marginal revenue curve for a monopolist always lies beneath the market demand curve. To understand why,\nthink about increasing the quantity along the demand curve by one unit, so that you take one step down the demand\ncurve to a slightly higher quantity but a slightly lower price. A demand curve is not sequential: It is not that first we\nsell Q at a higher price, and then we sell Q at a lower price. Rather, a demand curve is conditional: If we charge the\n1 2\nhigher price, we would sell Q . If, instead, we charge a lower price (on all the units that we sell), we would sell Q .\n1 2\nWhen we think about increasing the quantity sold by one unit, marginal revenue is affected in two ways. First, we\nsell one additional unit at the new market price. Second, all the previous units, which we sold at the higher price,\nnow sell for less. Because of the lower price on all units sold, the marginal revenue of selling a unit is less than the\nprice of that unit\u2014and the marginal revenue curve is below the demand curve.Tip: For a straight-line demand curve,\nMR and demand have the same vertical intercept. As output increases, marginal revenue decreases twice as fast as\ndemand, so that the horizontal intercept of MR is halfway to the horizontal intercept of demand. You can see this in\ntheFigure 9.8. 230 9 \u2022 Monopoly\nFIGURE9.8The Monopolist\u2019s Marginal Revenue Curve versus Demand CurveBecause the market demand curve is\nconditional, the marginal revenue curve for a monopolist lies beneath the demand curve.\nThe Inefficiency of Monopoly\nMost people criticize monopolies because they charge too high a price, but what economists object to is that\nmonopolies do not supply enough output to be allocatively efficient. To understand why a monopoly is\ninefficient, it is useful to compare it with the benchmark model of perfect competition.\nAllocative efficiencyis an economic concept regarding efficiency at the social or societal level. It refers to\nproducing the optimal quantity of some output, the quantity where the marginal benefit to society of one more\nunit just equals the marginal cost. The rule of profit maximization in a world of perfect competition was for\neach firm to produce the quantity of output where P = MC, where the price (P) is a measure of how much buyers\nvalue the good and the marginal cost (MC) is a measure of what marginal units cost society to produce.\nFollowing this rule assures allocative efficiency. If P > MC, then the marginal benefit to society (as measured by\nP) is greater than the marginal cost to society of producing additional units, and a greater quantity should be\nproduced. However, in the case of monopoly, price is always greater than marginal cost at the profit-\nmaximizing level of output, as you can see by looking back atFigure 9.6. Thus, consumers do not benefit from\na monopoly because it will sell a lower quantity in the market, at a higher price, than would have been the case\nin a perfectly competitive market.\nThe problem of inefficiency for monopolies often runs even deeper than these issues, and also involves\nincentives for efficiency over longer periods of time. There are counterbalancing incentives here. On one side,\nfirms may strive for new inventions and new intellectual property because they want to become monopolies\nand earn high profits\u2014at least for a few years until the competition catches up. In this way, monopolies may\ncome to exist because of competitive pressures on firms. However, once a barrier to entry is in place, a\nmonopoly that does not need to fear competition can just produce the same old products in the same old\nway\u2014while still ringing up a healthy rate of profit. John Hicks, who won the Nobel Prize for economics in 1972,\nwrote in 1935: \u201cThe best of all monopoly profits is a quiet life.\u201d He did not mean the comment in a\ncomplimentary way. He meant that monopolies may bank their profits and slack off on trying to please their\ncustomers.\nWhen AT&T provided all of the local and long-distance phone service in the United States, along with\nmanufacturing most of the phone equipment, the payment plans and types of phones did not change much.\nThe old joke was that you could have any color phone you wanted, as long as it was black. However, in 1982,\ngovernment litigation split up AT&T into a number of local phone companies, a long-distance phone company,\nand a phone equipment manufacturer. An explosion of innovation followed. Services like call waiting, caller ID,\nthree-way calling, voice mail through the phone company, mobile phones, and wireless connections to the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 9.2 \u2022 How a Profit-Maximizing Monopoly Chooses Output and Price 231\ninternet all became available. Companies offered a wide range of payment plans, as well. It was no longer true\nthat all phones were black. Instead, phones came in a wide variety of shapes and colors. The end of the\ntelephone monopoly brought lower prices, a greater quantity of services, and also a wave of innovation aimed\nat attracting and pleasing customers.\nBRING IT HOME\nThe Rest is History\nIn the opening case, we presented the East India Company and the Confederate States as a monopoly or near\nmonopoly provider of a good. Nearly every American schoolchild knows the result of the \u201cunwelcome visit\u201d the\n\u201cMohawks\u201d bestowed upon Boston Harbor\u2019s tea-bearing ships\u2014the Boston Tea Party. Regarding the cotton industry,\nwe also know Great Britain remained neutral during the Civil War, taking neither side during the conflict.\nDid the monopoly nature of these business have unintended and historical consequences? Might the American\nRevolution have been deterred, if the East India Company had sailed the tea-bearing ships back to England? Might\nthe southern states have made different decisions had they not been so confident \u201cKing Cotton\u201d would force\ndiplomatic recognition of the Confederate States of America? Of course, it is not possible to definitively answer\nthese questions. We cannot roll back the clock and try a different scenario. We can, however, consider the monopoly\nnature of these businesses and the roles they played and hypothesize about what might have occurred under\ndifferent circumstances.\nPerhaps if there had been legal free tea trade, the colonists would have seen things differently. There was smuggled\nDutch tea in the colonial market. If the colonists had been able to freely purchase Dutch tea, they would have paid\nlower prices and avoided the tax.\nWhat about the cotton monopoly? With one in five jobs in Great Britain depending on Southern cotton and the\nConfederate States as nearly the sole provider of that cotton, why did Great Britain remain neutral during the Civil\nWar? At the beginning of the war, Britain simply drew down massive stores of cotton. These stockpiles lasted until\nnear the end of 1862. Why did Britain not recognize the Confederacy at that point? Two reasons: The Emancipation\nProclamation and new sources of cotton. Having outlawed slavery throughout the United Kingdom in 1833, it was\npolitically impossible for Great Britain, empty cotton warehouses or not, to recognize, diplomatically, the\nConfederate States. In addition, during the two years it took to draw down the stockpiles, Britain expanded cotton\nimports from India, Egypt, and Brazil.\nMonopoly sellers often see no threats to their superior marketplace position. In these examples did the power of the\nmonopoly hide other possibilities from the decision makers? Perhaps. As a result of their actions, this is how history\nunfolded. 232 9 \u2022 Key Terms\nKey Terms\nallocative efficiencyproducing the optimal quantity of some output; the quantity where the marginal benefit\nto society of one more unit just equals the marginal cost\nbarriers to entrythe legal, technological, or market forces that may discourage or prevent potential\ncompetitors from entering a market\ncopyright a form of legal protection to prevent copying, for commercial purposes, original works of\nauthorship, including books and music\nderegulation removing government controls over setting prices and quantities in certain industries\nintellectual property the body of law including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secret law that\nprotect the right of inventors to produce and sell their inventions\nlegal monopoly legal prohibitions against competition, such as regulated monopolies and intellectual\nproperty protection\nmarginal profitprofit of one more unit of output, computed as marginal revenue minus marginal cost\nmonopoly a situation in which one firm produces all of the output in a market\nnatural monopoly economic conditions in the industry, for example, economies of scale or control of a critical\nresource, that limit effective competition\npatent a government rule that gives the inventor the exclusive legal right to make, use, or sell the invention for\na limited time\npredatory pricing when an existing firm uses sharp but temporary price cuts to discourage new competition\ntrade secretsmethods of production kept secret by the producing firm\ntrademark an identifying symbol or name for a particular good and can only be used by the firm that\nregistered that trademark\nKey Concepts and Summary\n9.1How Monopolies Form: Barriers to Entry\nBarriers to entry prevent or discourage competitors from entering the market. These barriers include:\neconomies of scale that lead to natural monopoly; control of a physical resource; legal restrictions on\ncompetition; patent, trademark and copyright protection; and practices to intimidate the competition like\npredatory pricing. Intellectual property refers to legally guaranteed ownership of an idea, rather than a\nphysical item. The laws that protect intellectual property include patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade\nsecrets. A natural monopoly arises when economies of scale persist over a large enough range of output that if\none firm supplies the entire market, no other firm can enter without facing a cost disadvantage.\n9.2How a Profit-Maximizing Monopoly Chooses Output and Price\nA monopolist is not a price taker, because when it decides what quantity to produce, it also determines the\nmarket price. For a monopolist, total revenue is relatively low at low quantities of output, because it is not\nselling much. Total revenue is also relatively low at very high quantities of output, because a very high quantity\nwill sell only at a low price. Thus, total revenue for a monopolist will start low, rise, and then decline. The\nmarginal revenue for a monopolist from selling additional units will decline. Each additional unit a monopolist\nsells will push down the overall market price, and as it sells more units, this lower price applies to increasingly\nmore units.\nThe monopolist will select the profit-maximizing level of output where MR = MC, and then charge the price for\nthat quantity of output as determined by the market demand curve. If that price is above average cost, the\nmonopolist earns positive profits.\nMonopolists are not productively efficient, because they do not produce at the minimum of the average cost\ncurve. Monopolists are not allocatively efficient, because they do not produce at the quantity where P = MC. As\na result, monopolists produce less, at a higher average cost, and charge a higher price than would a\ncombination of firms in a perfectly competitive industry. Monopolists also may lack incentives for innovation,\nAccess for free at openstax.org 9 \u2022 Self-Check Questions 233\nbecause they need not fear entry.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

(Credit: modification of \u201cDSC_7174\u201d by Pixel Drip/Flickr Creative Commons, CC BY 2.0)\nCHAPTER OBJECTIVES\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\u2022 Monopolistic Competition\n\u2022 Oligopoly\nIntroduction to Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly\nBRING IT HOME\nThe Temptation to Defy the Law\nLaundry detergent and bags of ice\u2014products of industries that seem pretty mundane, maybe even boring. Hardly!\nBoth have been the center of clandestine meetings and secret deals worthy of a spy novel. In France, between 1997\nand 2004, the top four laundry detergent producers (Proctor & Gamble, Henkel, Unilever, and Colgate-Palmolive)\ncontrolled about 90 percent of the French soap market. Officials from the soap firms were meeting secretly, in out-\nof-the-way, small caf\u00e9s around Paris. Their goals: Stamp out competition and set prices.\nAround the same time, the top five Midwest ice makers (Home City Ice, Lang Ice, Tinley Ice, Sisler\u2019s Dairy, and\nProducts of Ohio) had similar goals in mind when they secretly agreed to divide up the bagged ice market.\nIf both groups could meet their goals, it would enable each to act as though they were a single firm\u2014in essence, a 238 10 \u2022 Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly\nmonopoly\u2014and enjoy monopoly-size profits. The problem? In many parts of the world, including the European Union\nand the United States, it is illegal for firms to divide markets and set prices collaboratively.\nThese two cases provide examples of markets that are characterized neither as perfect competition nor monopoly.\nInstead, these firms are competing in market structures that lie between the extremes of monopoly and perfect\ncompetition. How do they behave? Why do they exist? We will revisit this case later, to find out what happened.\nPerfect competition and monopoly are at opposite ends of the competition spectrum. A perfectly competitive\nmarket has many firms selling identical products, who all act as price takers in the face of the competition. If\nyou recall,price takersare firms that have no market power. They simply have to take the market price as\ngiven.\nMonopoly arises when a single firm sells a product for which there are no close substitutes. We consider\nMicrosoft, for instance, as a monopoly because it dominates the operating systems market.\nWhat about the vast majority of real world firms and organizations that fall between these extremes, firms that\nwe could describe asimperfectly competitive? What determines their behavior? They have more influence\nover the price they charge than perfectly competitive firms, but not as much as a monopoly. What will they do?\nOne type of imperfectly competitive market ismonopolistic competition. Monopolistically competitive\nmarkets feature a large number of competing firms, but the products that they sell are not identical. Consider,\nas an example, the Mall of America in Minnesota, the largest shopping mall in the United States. In 2010, the\nMall of America had 24 stores that sold women\u2019s \u201cready-to-wear\u201d clothing (like Ann Taylor and Urban\nOutfitters), another 50 stores that sold clothing for both men and women (like Banana Republic, J. Crew, and\nNordstrom\u2019s), plus 14 more stores that sold women\u2019s specialty clothing (like Motherhood Maternity and\nVictoria\u2019s Secret). Most of the markets that consumers encounter at the retail level are monopolistically\ncompetitive.\nThe other type of imperfectly competitive market isoligopoly. Oligopolistic markets are those which a small\nnumber of firms dominate. Commercial aircraft provides a good example: Boeing and Airbus each produce\nslightly less than 50% of the large commercial aircraft in the world. Another example is the U.S. soft drink\nindustry, which Coca-Cola and Pepsi dominate. We characterize oligopolies by high barriers to entry with firms\nchoosing output, pricing, and other decisions strategically based on the decisions of the other firms in the\nmarket. In this chapter, we first explore how monopolistically competitive firms will choose their profit-\nmaximizing level of output. We will then discuss oligopolistic firms, which face two conflicting temptations: to\ncollaborate as if they were a single monopoly, or to individually compete to gain profits by expanding output\nlevels and cutting prices. Oligopolistic markets and firms can also take on elements of monopoly and of perfect\ncompetition.\n10.1Monopolistic Competition\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain the significance of differentiated products\n\u2022 Describe how a monopolistic competitor chooses price and quantity\n\u2022 Discuss entry, exit, and efficiency as they pertain to monopolistic competition\n\u2022 Analyze how advertising can impact monopolistic competition\nMonopolistic competition involves manyfirmscompeting against each other, but selling products that are\ndistinctive in some way. Examples include stores that sell different styles of clothing; restaurants or grocery\nstores that sell a variety of food; and even products like golf balls or beer that may be at least somewhat similar\nbut differ in public perception because of advertising and brand names. There are over 600,000 restaurants in\nthe United States. When products are distinctive, each firm has a mini-monopoly on its particular style or\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.1 \u2022 Monopolistic Competition 239\nflavor or brand name. However, firms producing such products must also compete with other styles and flavors\nand brand names. The term \u201cmonopolistic competition\u201d captures this mixture of mini-monopoly and tough\ncompetition, and the following Clear It Up feature introduces its derivation.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWho invented the theory of imperfect competition?\nTwo economists independently but simultaneously developed the theory of imperfect competition in 1933. The first\nwas Edward Chamberlin of Harvard University who publishedThe Economics of Monopolistic Competition. The\nsecond was Joan Robinson of Cambridge University who publishedThe Economics of Imperfect Competition.\nRobinson subsequently became interested in macroeconomics and she became a prominent Keynesian, and later a\npost-Keynesian economist. (See theWelcome to Economics!andThe Keynesian Perspectivechapters for more on\nKeynes.)\nDifferentiated Products\nA firm can try to make its products different from those of its competitors in several ways: physical aspects of\nthe product, location from which it sells the product, intangible aspects of the product, and perceptions of the\nproduct. We call products that are distinctive in one of these waysdifferentiated products.\nPhysical aspects of a product include all the phrases you hear in advertisements: unbreakable bottle, nonstick\nsurface, freezer-to-microwave, non-shrink, extra spicy, newly redesigned for your comfort. A firm's location\ncan also create a difference between producers. For example, a gas station located at a heavily traveled\nintersection can probably sell more gas, because more cars drive by that corner. A supplier to an automobile\nmanufacturer may find that it is an advantage to locate close to the car factory.\nIntangible aspects can differentiate a product, too. Some intangible aspects may be promises like a guarantee\nof satisfaction or money back, a reputation for high quality, services like free delivery, or offering a loan to\npurchase the product. Finally,product differentiationmay occur in the minds of buyers. For example, many\npeople could not tell the difference in taste between common varieties of ketchup or mayonnaise if they were\nblindfolded but, because of past habits and advertising, they have strong preferences for certain brands.\nAdvertising can play a role in shaping these intangible preferences.\nThe concept of differentiated products is closely related to the degree of variety that is available. If everyone in\nthe economy wore only blue jeans, ate only white bread, and drank only tap water, then the markets for\nclothing, food, and drink would be much closer to perfectly competitive. The variety of styles, flavors, locations,\nand characteristics creates product differentiation and monopolistic competition.\nPerceived Demand for a Monopolistic Competitor\nA monopolistically competitive firm perceives a demand for its goods that is an intermediate case between\nmonopoly and competition.Figure 10.2offers a reminder that thedemand curvethat a perfectly competitive\nfirm faces isperfectly elasticor flat, because the perfectly competitive firm can sell any quantity it wishes at\nthe prevailingmarket price. In contrast, the demand curve, as faced by a monopolist, is the market demand\ncurve, since a monopolist is the only firm in the market, and hence is downward sloping. 240 10 \u2022 Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly\nFIGURE10.2Perceived Demand for Firms in Different Competitive SettingsThe demand curve that a perfectly\ncompetitive firm faces is perfectly elastic, meaning it can sell all the output it wishes at the prevailing market price.\nThe demand curve that a monopoly faces is the market demand. It can sell more output only by decreasing the price\nit charges. The demand curve that a monopolistically competitive firm faces falls in between.\nThe demand curve as a monopolistic competitor faces is not flat, but rather downward-sloping, which means\nthat the monopolistic competitor can raise its price without losing all of its customers or lower the price and\ngain more customers. Since there are substitutes, the demand curve facing a monopolistically competitive\nfirm is more elastic than that of a monopoly where there are no close substitutes. If a monopolist raises its\nprice, some consumers will choose not to purchase its product\u2014but they will then need to buy a completely\ndifferent product. However, when a monopolistic competitor raises its price, some consumers will choose not\nto purchase the product at all, but others will choose to buy a similar product from another firm. If a\nmonopolistic competitor raises its price, it will not lose as many customers as would a perfectly competitive\nfirm, but it will lose more customers than would a monopoly that raised its prices.\nAt a glance, the demand curves that a monopoly and a monopolistic competitor face look similar\u2014that is, they\nboth slope down. However, the underlying economic meaning of these perceived demand curves is different,\nbecause a monopolist faces the market demand curve and a monopolistic competitor does not. Rather, a\nmonopolistically competitive firm\u2019s demand curve is but one of many firms that make up the \u201cbefore\u201d market\ndemand curve. Are you following? If so, how would you categorize the market for golf balls? Take a swing, then\nsee the following Clear It Up feature.\nCLEAR IT UP\nAre golf balls really differentiated products?\nMonopolistic competition refers to an industry that has more than a few firms, each offering a product which, from\nthe consumer\u2019s perspective, is different from its competitors. The U.S. Golf Association runs a laboratory that tests\n20,000 golf balls a year. There are strict rules for what makes a golf ball legal. A ball's weight cannot exceed 1.620\nounces and its diameter cannot be less than 1.680 inches (which is a weight of 45.93 grams and a diameter of\n42.67 millimeters, in case you were wondering). The Association also tests the balls by hitting them at different\nspeeds. For example, the distance test involves having a mechanical golfer hit the ball with a titanium driver and a\nswing speed of 120 miles per hour. As the testing center explains: \u201cThe USGA system then uses an array of sensors\nthat accurately measure the flight of a golf ball during a short, indoor trajectory from a ball launcher. From this flight\ndata, a computer calculates the lift and drag forces that are generated by the speed, spin, and dimple pattern of the\nball. ... The distance limit is 317 yards.\u201d\nOver 1800 golf balls made by more than 100 companies meet the USGA standards. The balls do differ in various\nways, such as the pattern of dimples on the ball, the types of plastic on the cover and in the cores, and other factors.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.1 \u2022 Monopolistic Competition 241\nSince all balls need to conform to the USGA tests, they are much more alike than different. In other words, golf ball\nmanufacturers are monopolistically competitive.\nHowever, retail sales of golf balls are about $500 million per year, which means that many large companies have a\npowerful incentive to persuade players that golf balls are highly differentiated and that it makes a huge difference\nwhich one you choose. Sure, Tiger Woods can tell the difference. For the average amateur golfer who plays a few\ntimes a summer\u2014and who loses many golf balls to the woods and lake and needs to buy new ones\u2014most golf balls\nare pretty much indistinguishable.\nHow a Monopolistic Competitor Chooses Price and Quantity\nThe monopolistically competitive firm decides on its profit-maximizing quantity and price in much the same\nway as a monopolist. A monopolistic competitor, like a monopolist, faces a downward-sloping demand curve,\nand so it will choose some combination of price and quantity along its perceived demand curve.\nAs an example of aprofit-maximizingmonopolistic competitor, consider the Authentic Chinese Pizza store,\nwhich serves pizza with cheese, sweet and sour sauce, and your choice of vegetables and meats. Although\nAuthentic Chinese Pizza must compete against other pizza businesses and restaurants, it has a differentiated\nproduct. The firm\u2019s perceived demand curve is downward sloping, asFigure 10.3shows and the first two\ncolumns ofTable 10.1.\nFIGURE10.3How a Monopolistic Competitor Chooses its Profit Maximizing Output and PriceTo maximize profits,\nthe Authentic Chinese Pizza shop would choose a quantity where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, or Q where\nMR = MC. Here it would choose a quantity of 40 and a price of $16.\nQuantity Price Total Revenue Marginal Revenue Total Cost Marginal Cost Average Cost\n10 $23 $230 $23 $340 $34 $34\n20 $20 $400 $17 $400 $6 $20\n30 $18 $540 $14 $480 $8 $16\n40 $16 $640 $10 $580 $10 $14.50\n50 $14 $700 $6 $700 $12 $14\nTABLE10.1Revenue and Cost Schedule 242 10 \u2022 Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly\nQuantity Price Total Revenue Marginal Revenue Total Cost Marginal Cost Average Cost\n60 $12 $720 $2 $840 $14 $14\n70 $10 $700 \u2013$2 $1,020 $18 $14.57\n80 $8 $640 \u2013$6 $1,280 $26 $16\nTABLE10.1Revenue and Cost Schedule\nWe can multiply the combinations of price and quantity at each point on the demand curve to calculate the\ntotal revenue that the firm would receive, which is in the third column ofTable 10.1. We calculate marginal\nrevenue, in the fourth column, as the change in total revenue divided by the change in quantity. The final\ncolumns ofTable 10.1show total cost, marginal cost, and average cost. As always, we calculate marginal cost\nby dividing the change in total cost by the change in quantity, while we calculate average cost by dividing total\ncost by quantity. The following Work It Out feature shows how these firms calculate how much of their\nproducts to supply at what price.\nWORK IT OUT\nHow a Monopolistic Competitor Determines How Much to Produce and at What Price\nThe process by which a monopolistic competitor chooses its profit-maximizing quantity and price resembles\nclosely how a monopoly makes these decisions process. First, the firm selects the profit-maximizing quantity to\nproduce. Then the firm decides what price to charge for that quantity.\nStep 1. The monopolistic competitor determines its profit-maximizing level of output. In this case, the Authentic\nChinese Pizza company will determine the profit-maximizing quantity to produce by considering its marginal\nrevenues and marginal costs. Two scenarios are possible:\n\u2022 If the firm is producing at a quantity of output where marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost, then the firm\nshould keep expanding production, because each marginal unit is adding to profit by bringing in more\nrevenue than its cost. In this way, the firm will produce up to the quantity where MR = MC.\n\u2022 If the firm is producing at a quantity where marginal costs exceed marginal revenue, then each marginal unit\nis costing more than the revenue it brings in, and the firm will increase its profits by reducing the quantity of\noutput until MR = MC.\nIn this example, MR and MC intersect at a quantity of 40, which is the profit-maximizing level of output for the\nfirm.\nStep 2. The monopolistic competitor decides what price to charge. When the firm has determined its profit-\nmaximizing quantity of output, it can then look to its perceived demand curve to find out what it can charge for\nthat quantity of output. On the graph, we show this process as a vertical line reaching up through the profit-\nmaximizing quantity until it hits the firm\u2019s perceived demand curve. For Authentic Chinese Pizza, it should charge\na price of $16 per pizza for a quantity of 40.\nOnce the firm has chosen price and quantity, it\u2019s in a position to calculate total revenue, total cost, and profit. At a\nquantity of 40, the price of $16 lies above the average cost curve, so the firm is making economic profits. From\nTable 10.1we can see that, at an output of 40, the firm\u2019s total revenue is $640 and its total cost is $580, so\nprofits are $60. InFigure 10.3, the firm\u2019s total revenues are the rectangle with the quantity of 40 on the\nhorizontal axis and the price of $16 on the vertical axis. The firm\u2019s total costs are the light shaded rectangle with\nthe same quantity of 40 on the horizontal axis but the average cost of $14.50 on the vertical axis. Profits are total\nrevenues minus total costs, which is the shaded area above the average cost curve.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.1 \u2022 Monopolistic Competition 243\nAlthough the process by which a monopolistic competitor makes decisions about quantity and price is similar\nto the way in which a monopolist makes such decisions, two differences are worth remembering. First,\nalthough both a monopolist and a monopolistic competitor face downward-sloping demand curves, the\nmonopolist\u2019s perceived demand curve is the market demand curve, while the perceiveddemand curvefor a\nmonopolistic competitor is based on the extent of its product differentiation and how many competitors it\nfaces. Second, a monopolist is surrounded by barriers to entry and need not fear entry, but a monopolistic\ncompetitor who earns profits must expect the entry of firms with similar, but differentiated, products.\nMonopolistic Competitors and Entry\nIf one monopolistic competitor earns positive economic profits, other firms will be tempted to enter the\nmarket. A gas station with a great location must worry that other gas stations might open across the street or\ndown the road\u2014and perhaps the new gas stations will sell coffee or have a carwash or some other attraction to\nlure customers. A successful restaurant with a unique barbecue sauce must be concerned that other\nrestaurants will try to copy the sauce or offer their own unique recipes. A laundry detergent with a great\nreputation for quality must take note that other competitors may seek to build their own reputations.\nThe entry of other firms into the same general market (like gas, restaurants, or detergent) shifts the demand\ncurve that a monopolistically competitive firm faces. As more firms enter the market, the quantity demanded\nat a given price for any particular firm will decline, and the firm\u2019s perceived demand curve will shift to the left.\nAs a firm\u2019s perceived demand curve shifts to the left, its marginal revenue curve will shift to the left, too. The\nshift in marginal revenue will change the profit-maximizing quantity that the firm chooses to produce, since\nmarginal revenue will then equal marginal cost at a lower quantity.\nFigure 10.4(a) shows a situation in which a monopolistic competitor was earning a profit with its original\nperceived demand curve (D ). The intersection of the marginal revenue curve (MR ) and marginal cost curve\n0 0\n(MC) occurs at point S, corresponding to quantity Q , which is associated on the demand curve at point T with\n0\nprice P . The combination of price P and quantity Q lies above the average cost curve, which shows that the\n0 0 0\nfirm is earning positive economic profits.\nFIGURE10.4Monopolistic Competition, Entry, and Exit(a) At P and Q , the monopolistically competitive firm in\n0 0\nthis figure is making a positive economic profit. This is clear because if you follow the dotted line above Q , you can\n0\nsee that price is above average cost. Positive economic profits attract competing firms to the industry, driving the\noriginal firm\u2019s demand down to D . At the new equilibrium quantity (P , Q ), the original firm is earning zero\n1 1 1\neconomic profits, and entry into the industry ceases. In (b) the opposite occurs. At P and Q , the firm is losing\n0 0\nmoney. If you follow the dotted line above Q , you can see that average cost is above price. Losses induce firms to\n0\nleave the industry. When they do, demand for the original firm rises to D , where once again the firm is earning zero\n1\neconomic profit. 244 10 \u2022 Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly\nUnlike a monopoly, with its high barriers to entry, a monopolistically competitive firm with positive economic\nprofits will attract competition. When another competitor enters the market, the original firm\u2019s perceived\ndemand curve shifts to the left, from D to D , and the associated marginal revenue curve shifts from MR to\n0 1 0\nMR . The new profit-maximizing output is Q , because the intersection of the MR and MC now occurs at point\n1 1 1\nU. Moving vertically up from that quantity on the new demand curve, the optimal price is at P .\n1\nAs long as thefirmis earning positive economic profits, new competitors will continue to enter the market,\nreducing the original firm\u2019s demand and marginal revenue curves. The long-runequilibriumis in the figure at\npoint Y, where the firm\u2019s perceived demand curve touches the average cost curve. When price is equal to\naverage cost, economic profits are zero. Thus, although a monopolistically competitive firm may earn positive\neconomic profits in the short term, the process of new entry will drive down economic profits to zero in the\nlong run. Remember that zero economic profit is not equivalent to zeroaccounting profit. A zero economic\nprofit means the firm\u2019s accounting profit is equal to what its resources could earn in their next best use.Figure\n10.4(b) shows the reverse situation, where a monopolistically competitive firm is originally losing money. The\nadjustment to long-run equilibrium is analogous to the previous example. The economic losses lead to firms\nexiting, which will result in increased demand for this particular firm, and consequently lower losses. Firms\nexit up to the point where there are no more losses in this market, for example when the demand curve\ntouches the average cost curve, as in point Z.\nMonopolistic competitors can make an economic profit or loss in the short run, but in the long run, entry and\nexit will drive these firms toward a zero economic profit outcome. However, the zero economic profit outcome\nin monopolistic competition looks different from the zero economic profit outcome in perfect competition in\nseveral ways relating both to efficiency and to variety in the market.\nMonopolistic Competition and Efficiency\nThe long-term result of entry and exit in a perfectly competitive market is that all firms end up selling at the\nprice level determined by the lowest point on the average cost curve. This outcome is why perfect competition\ndisplaysproductive efficiency: goods are produced at the lowest possible average cost. However, in\nmonopolistic competition, the end result of entry and exit is that firms end up with a price that lies on the\ndownward-sloping portion of the average cost curve, not at the very bottom of the AC curve. Thus, monopolistic\ncompetition will not be productively efficient.\nIn a perfectly competitive market, each firm produces at a quantity where price is set equal to marginal cost,\nboth in the short and long run. This outcome is why perfect competition displays allocative efficiency: the\nsocial benefits of additional production, as measured by the marginal benefit, which is the same as the price,\nequal the marginal costs to society of that production. In a monopolistically competitive market, the rule for\nmaximizing profit is to set MR = MC\u2014and price is higher than marginal revenue, not equal to it because the\ndemand curve is downward sloping. When P > MC, which is the outcome in a monopolistically competitive\nmarket, the benefits to society of providing additional quantity, as measured by the price that people are\nwilling to pay, exceed the marginal costs to society of producing those units. A monopolistically competitive\nfirm does not produce more, which means that society loses the net benefit of those extra units. This is the\nsame argument we made about monopoly, but in this case the allocative inefficiency will be smaller. Thus, a\nmonopolistically competitive industry will produce a lower quantity of a good and charge a higher price for it\nthan would a perfectly competitive industry. See the following Clear It Up feature for more detail on the impact\nof demand shifts.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhy does a shift in perceived demand cause a shift in marginal revenue?\nWe use the combinations of price and quantity at each point on a firm\u2019s perceived demand curve to calculate total\nrevenue for each combination of price and quantity. We then use this information on total revenue to calculate\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.1 \u2022 Monopolistic Competition 245\nmarginal revenue, which is the change in total revenue divided by the change in quantity. A change in perceived\ndemand will change total revenue at every quantity of output and in turn, the change in total revenue will shift\nmarginal revenue at each quantity of output. Thus, when entry occurs in a monopolistically competitive industry, the\nperceived demand curve for each firm will shift to the left, because a smaller quantity will be demanded at any given\nprice. Another way of interpreting this shift in demand is to notice that, for each quantity sold, the firm will charge a\nlower price. Consequently, the marginal revenue will be lower for each quantity sold\u2014and the marginal revenue\ncurve will shift to the left as well. Conversely, exit causes the perceived demand curve for a monopolistically\ncompetitive firm to shift to the right and the corresponding marginal revenue curve to shift right, too.\nA monopolistically competitive industry does not display productive or allocative efficiency in either the short\nrun, when firms are making economic profits and losses, nor in the long run, when firms are earning zero\nprofits.\nThe Benefits of Variety and Product Differentiation\nEven though monopolistic competition does not provide productive efficiency or allocative efficiency, it does\nhave benefits of its own. Product differentiation is based on variety and innovation. Most people would prefer\nto live in an economy with many kinds of clothes, foods, and car styles; not in a world of perfect competition\nwhere everyone will always wear blue jeans and white shirts, eat only spaghetti with plain red sauce, and drive\nan identical model of car. Most people would prefer to live in an economy where firms are struggling to figure\nout ways of attracting customers by methods like friendlier service, free delivery, guarantees of quality,\nvariations on existing products, and a better shopping experience.\nEconomists have struggled, with only partial success, to address the question of whether a market-oriented\neconomy produces the optimal amount of variety. Critics of market-oriented economies argue that society\ndoes not really need dozens of different athletic shoes or breakfast cereals or automobiles. They argue that\nmuch of the cost of creating such a high degree of product differentiation, and then of advertising and\nmarketing this differentiation, is socially wasteful\u2014that is, most people would be just as happy with a smaller\nrange ofdifferentiated productsproduced and sold at a lower price. Defenders of a market-oriented economy\nrespond that if people do not want to buy differentiated products or highly advertised brand names, no one is\nforcing them to do so. Moreover, they argue that consumers benefit substantially when firms seek short-term\nprofits by providing differentiated products. This controversy may never be fully resolved, in part because\ndeciding on the optimal amount of variety is very difficult, and in part because the two sides often place\ndifferent values on what variety means for consumers. Read the following Clear It Up feature for a discussion\non the role that advertising plays in monopolistic competition.\nCLEAR IT UP\nHow does advertising impact monopolistic competition?\nThe U.S. economy spent about $180.12 billion on advertising in 2014, according to eMarketer.com. Roughly one\nthird of this was television advertising, and another third was divided roughly equally between internet, newspapers,\nand radio. The remaining third was divided between direct mail, magazines, telephone directory yellow pages, and\nbillboards. Mobile devices are increasing the opportunities for advertisers.\nAdvertising is all about explaining to people, or making people believe, that the products of one firm are\ndifferentiated from another firm's products. In the framework of monopolistic competition, there are two ways to\nconceive of how advertising works: either advertising causes a firm\u2019s perceived demand curve to become more\ninelastic (that is, it causes the perceived demand curve to become steeper); or advertising causes demand for the\nfirm\u2019s product to increase (that is, it causes the firm\u2019s perceived demand curve to shift to the right). In either case, a\nsuccessful advertising campaign may allow a firm to sell either a greater quantity or to charge a higher price, or both, 246 10 \u2022 Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly\nand thus increase its profits.\nHowever, economists and business owners have also long suspected that much of the advertising may only offset\nother advertising. Economist A. C. Pigou wrote the following back in 1920 in his book,The Economics of Welfare:\nIt may happen that expenditures on advertisement made by competing monopolists [that is, what we now\ncall monopolistic competitors] will simply neutralise one another, and leave the industrial position exactly\nas it would have been if neither had expended anything. For, clearly, if each of two rivals makes equal\nefforts to attract the favour of the public away from the other, the total result is the same as it would have\nbeen if neither had made any effort at all.\n10.2Oligopoly\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain why and how oligopolies exist\n\u2022 Contrast collusion and competition\n\u2022 Interpret and analyze the prisoner\u2019s dilemma diagram\n\u2022 Evaluate the tradeoffs of imperfect competition\nMany purchases that individuals make at the retail level are produced in markets that are neither perfectly\ncompetitive, monopolies, nor monopolistically competitive. Rather, they are oligopolies.Oligopolyarises when\na small number of large firms have all or most of the sales in an industry. Examples of oligopoly abound and\ninclude the auto industry, cable television, and commercial air travel. Oligopolistic firms are like cats in a bag.\nThey can either scratch each other to pieces or cuddle up and get comfortable with one another. If oligopolists\ncompete hard, they may end up acting very much like perfect competitors, driving down costs and leading to\nzero profits for all. If oligopolists collude with each other, they may effectively act like a monopoly and succeed\nin pushing up prices and earning consistently high levels of profit. We typically characterize oligopolies by\nmutual interdependence where various decisions such as output, price, and advertising depend on other\nfirm(s)' decisions. Analyzing the choices of oligopolistic firms about pricing and quantity produced involves\nconsidering the pros and cons of competition versus collusion at a given point in time.\nWhy Do Oligopolies Exist?\nA combination of the barriers to entry that create monopolies and the product differentiation that\ncharacterizes monopolistic competition can create the setting for an oligopoly. For example, when a\ngovernment grants a patent for an invention to one firm, it may create a monopoly. When the government\ngrants patents to, for example, three different pharmaceutical companies that each has its own drug for\nreducing high blood pressure, those three firms may become an oligopoly.\nSimilarly, anatural monopolywill arise when the quantity demanded in a market is only large enough for a\nsingle firm to operate at the minimum of the long-run average cost curve. In such a setting, the market has\nroom for only one firm, because no smaller firm can operate at a low enough average cost to compete, and no\nlarger firm could sell what it produced given the quantity demanded in the market.\nQuantity demandedin the market may also be two or three times the quantity needed to produce at the\nminimum of the average cost curve\u2014which means that the market would have room for only two or three\noligopoly firms (and they need not produce differentiated products). Again, smaller firms would have higher\naverage costs and be unable to compete, while additional large firms would produce such a high quantity that\nthey would not be able to sell it at a profitable price. This combination of economies of scale and market\ndemand creates the barrier to entry, which led to the Boeing-Airbus oligopoly (also called a duopoly) for large\npassenger aircraft.\nThe product differentiation at the heart of monopolistic competition can also play a role in creating oligopoly.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.2 \u2022 Oligopoly 247\nFor example, firms may need to reach a certain minimum size before they are able to spend enough on\nadvertising and marketing to create a recognizable brand name. The problem in competing with, say, Coca-\nCola or Pepsi is not that producing fizzy drinks is technologically difficult, but rather that creating a brand\nname and marketing effort to equal Coke or Pepsi is an enormous task.\nCollusion or Competition?\nWhen oligopoly firms in a certain market decide what quantity to produce and what price to charge, they face a\ntemptation to act as if they were a monopoly. By acting together, oligopolistic firms can hold down industry\noutput, charge a higher price, and divide the profit among themselves. When firms act together in this way to\nreduce output and keep prices high, it is calledcollusion. A group of firms that have a formal agreement to\ncollude to produce the monopoly output and sell at the monopoly price is called acartel. See the following\nClear It Up feature for a more in-depth analysis of the difference between the two.\nCLEAR IT UP\nCollusion versus cartels: How to differentiate\nIn the United States, as well as many other countries, it is illegal for firms to collude since collusion is anti-\ncompetitive behavior, which is a violation of antitrust law. Both theAntitrust Division of the Justice Departmentand\ntheFederal Trade Commissionhave responsibilities for preventing collusion in the United States.\nThe problem of enforcement is finding hard evidence of collusion. Cartels are formal agreements to collude.\nBecause cartel agreements provide evidence of collusion, they are rare in the United States. Instead, most collusion\nis tacit, where firms implicitly reach an understanding that competition is bad for profits.\nEconomists have understood for a long time the desire of businesses to avoid competing so that they can\ninstead raise the prices that they charge and earn higher profits.Adam Smithwrote inWealth of Nationsin\n1776: \u201cPeople of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation\nends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.\u201d\nEven when oligopolists recognize that they would benefit as a group by acting like a monopoly, each individual\noligopoly faces a private temptation to produce just a slightly higher quantity and earn slightly higher\nprofit\u2014while still counting on the other oligopolists to hold down their production and keep prices high. If at\nleast some oligopolists give in to this temptation and start producing more, then the market price will fall. A\nsmall handful of oligopoly firms may end up competing so fiercely that they all find themselves earning zero\neconomic profits\u2014as if they were perfect competitors.\nThe Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma\nBecause of the complexity of oligopoly, which is the result of mutual interdependence among firms, there is no\nsingle, generally-accepted theory of how oligopolies behave, in the same way that we have theories for all the\nother market structures. Instead, economists usegame theory, a branch of mathematics that analyzes\nsituations in which players must make decisions and then receive payoffs based on what other players decide\nto do. Game theory has found widespread applications in the social sciences, as well as in business, law, and\nmilitary strategy.\nTheprisoner\u2019s dilemmais a scenario in which the gains from cooperation are larger than the rewards from\npursuing self-interest. It applies well to oligopoly. (Note that the term \"prisoner\" is not typically an accurate\nterm for someone who has recently been arrested, but we will use the term here, since this scenario is widely\nused and referenced in economic, business, and social contexts.) The story behind the prisoner\u2019s dilemma\ngoes like this:\nTwo co-conspirators are arrested. When they are taken to the police station, they refuse to say 248 10 \u2022 Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly\nanything and are put in separate interrogation rooms. Eventually, a police officer enters the room\nwhere Prisoner A is being held and says: \u201cYou know what? Your partner in the other room is\nconfessing. Your partner is going to get a light prison sentence of just one year, and because you\u2019re\nremaining silent, the judge is going to stick you with eight years in prison. Why don\u2019t you get smart? If\nyou confess, too, we\u2019ll cut your jail time down to five years, and your partner will get five years, also.\u201d\nOver in the next room, another police officer is giving exactly the same speech to Prisoner B. What the\npolice officers do not say is that if both prisoners remain silent, the evidence against them is not\nespecially strong, and the prisoners will end up with only two years in jail each.\nThe game theory situation facing the two prisoners is inTable 10.2. To understand the dilemma, first consider\nthe choices from Prisoner A\u2019s point of view. If A believes that B will confess, then A should confess, too, so as to\nnot get stuck with the eight years in prison. However, if A believes that B will not confess, then A will be\ntempted to act selfishly and confess, so as to serve only one year. The key point is that A has an incentive to\nconfess regardless of what choice B makes! B faces the same set of choices, and thus will have an incentive to\nconfess regardless of what choice A makes. To confess is called the dominant strategy. It is the strategy an\nindividual (or firm) will pursue regardless of the other individual\u2019s (or firm\u2019s) decision. The result is that if\nprisoners pursue their own self-interest, both are likely to confess, and end up being sentenced to a total of 10\nyears of jail time between them.\nPrisoner B\nRemain Silent (cooperate with Confess (do not cooperate with\nother prisoner) other prisoner)\nRemain Silent (cooperate with\nA gets 2 years, B gets 2 years A gets 8 years, B gets 1 year\nother prisoner)\nPrisoner\nA\nConfess (do not cooperate with\nA gets 1 year, B gets 8 years A gets 5 years B gets 5 years\nother prisoner)\nTABLE10.2The Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma Problem\nThe game is called a dilemma because if the two prisoners had cooperated by both remaining silent, they\nwould only have been incarcerated for two years each, for a total of four years between them. If the two\nprisoners can work out some way of cooperating so that neither one will confess, they will both be better off\nthan if they each follow their own individual self-interest, which in this case leads straight into longer terms.\nThe Oligopoly Version of the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma\nThe members of an oligopoly can face a prisoner\u2019s dilemma, also. If each of the oligopolists cooperates in\nholding down output, then high monopoly profits are possible. Each oligopolist, however, must worry that\nwhile it is holding down output, other firms are taking advantage of the high price by raising output and\nearning higher profits.Table 10.3shows the prisoner\u2019s dilemma for a two-firm oligopoly\u2014known as aduopoly.\nIf Firms A and B both agree to hold down output, they are acting together as a monopoly and will each earn\n$1,000 in profits. However, both firms\u2019 dominant strategy is to increase output, in which case each will earn\n$400 in profits.\nFirm B\nHold Down Output (cooperate Increase Output (do not cooperate\nwith other firm) with other firm)\nTABLE10.3A Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma for Oligopolists\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.2 \u2022 Oligopoly 249\nHold Down Output (cooperate with\nA gets $1,000, B gets $1,000 A gets $200, B gets $1,500\nother firm)\nFirm\nA\nIncrease Output (do not cooperate\nA gets $1,500, B gets $200 A gets $400, B gets $400\nwith other firm)\nTABLE10.3A Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma for Oligopolists\nCan the two firms trust each other? Consider the situation of Firm A:\n\u2022 If A thinks that B will cheat on their agreement and increase output, then A will increase output, too,\nbecause for A the profit of $400 when both firms increase output (the bottom right-hand choice inTable\n10.3) is better than a profit of only $200 if A keeps output low and B raises output (the upper right-hand\nchoice in the table).\n\u2022 If A thinks that B will cooperate by holding down output, then A may seize the opportunity to earn higher\nprofits by raising output. After all, if B is going to hold down output, then A can earn $1,500 in profits by\nexpanding output (the bottom left-hand choice in the table) compared with only $1,000 by holding down\noutput as well (the upper left-hand choice in the table).\nThus, firm A will reason that it makes sense to expand output if B holds down output and that it also makes\nsense to expand output if B raises output. Again, B faces a parallel set of decisions that will lead B also to\nexpand output.\nThe result of this prisoner\u2019s dilemma is often that even though A and B could make the highest combined\nprofits by cooperating in producing a lower level of output and acting like a monopolist, the two firms may well\nend up in a situation where they each increaseoutputand earn only $400 each inprofits. The following Clear It\nUp feature discusses one cartel scandal in particular.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat is the Lysine cartel?\nLysine, a $600 million-a-year industry, is an amino acid that farmers use as a feed additive to ensure the proper\ngrowth of swine and poultry. The primary U.S. producer of lysine is Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), but several other\nlarge European and Japanese firms are also in this market. For a time in the first half of the 1990s, the world\u2019s major\nlysine producers met together in hotel conference rooms and decided exactly how much each firm would sell and\nwhat it would charge. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), however, had learned of the cartel and placed\nwire taps on a number of their phone calls and meetings.\nFrom FBI surveillance tapes, following is a comment that Terry Wilson, president of the corn processing division at\nADM, made to the other lysine producers at a 1994 meeting in Mona, Hawaii:\nI wanna go back and I wanna say something very simple. If we\u2019re going to trust each other, okay, and if I\u2019m\nassured that I\u2019m gonna get 67,000 tons by the year\u2019s end, we\u2019re gonna sell it at the prices we agreed to . . .\nThe only thing we need to talk about there because we are gonna get manipulated by these [expletive]\nbuyers\u2014they can be smarter than us if we let them be smarter. . . . They [the customers] are not your friend.\nThey are not my friend. And we gotta have \u2018em, but they are not my friends. You are my friend. I wanna be\ncloser to you than I am to any customer. Cause you can make us ... money. ... And all I wanna tell you again\nis let\u2019s\u2014let\u2019s put the prices on the board. Let\u2019s all agree that\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna do and then walk out of\nhere and do it.\nThe price of lysine doubled while the cartel was in effect. Confronted by the FBI tapes, Archer Daniels Midland pled\nguilty in 1996 and paid a fine of $100 million. A number of top executives, both at ADM and other firms, later paid 250 10 \u2022 Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly\nfines of up to $350,000 and were sentenced to 24\u201330 months in prison.\nIn another one of the FBI recordings, the president of Archer Daniels Midland told an executive from another\ncompeting firm that ADM had a slogan that, in his words, had \u201cpenetrated the whole company.\u201d The company\npresident stated the slogan this way: \u201cOur competitors are our friends. Our customers are the enemy.\u201d That slogan\ncould stand as the motto of cartels everywhere.\nHow to Enforce Cooperation\nHow can parties who find themselves in a prisoner\u2019s dilemma situation avoid the undesired outcome and\ncooperate with each other? The way out of a prisoner\u2019s dilemma is to find a way to penalize those who do not\ncooperate.\nPerhaps the easiest approach for colluding oligopolists, as you might imagine, would be to sign a contract with\neach other that they will hold output low and keep prices high. If a group of U.S. companies signed such a\ncontract, however, it would be illegal. Certain international organizations, like the nations that are members of\ntheOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), have signed international agreements to act like a\nmonopoly, hold down output, and keep prices high so that all of the countries can make high profits from oil\nexports. Such agreements, however, because they fall in a gray area of international law, are not legally\nenforceable. If Nigeria, for example, decides to start cutting prices and selling more oil, Saudi Arabia cannot\nsue Nigeria in court and force it to stop.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countrieswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/OPEC)and learn\nmore about its history and how it defines itself.\nBecause oligopolists cannot sign a legally enforceable contract to act like a monopoly, the firms may instead\nkeep close tabs on what other firms are producing and charging. Alternatively, oligopolists may choose to act\nin a way that generates pressure on each firm to stick to its agreed quantity of output.\nOne example of the pressure these firms can exert on one another is thekinked demand curve, in which\ncompeting oligopoly firms commit to match price cuts, but not price increases.Figure 10.5shows this\nsituation. Say that an oligopoly airline has agreed with the rest of a cartel to provide a quantity of 10,000 seats\non the New York to Los Angeles route, at a price of $500. This choice defines the kink in the firm\u2019s perceived\ndemand curve. The reason that the firm faces a kink in its demand curve is because of how the other\noligopolists react to changes in the firm\u2019s price. If the oligopoly decides to produce more and cut its price, the\nother members of the cartel will immediately match any price cuts\u2014and therefore, a lower price brings very\nlittle increase in quantity sold.\nIf onefirmcuts its price to $300, it will be able to sell only 11,000 seats. However, if the airline seeks to raise\nprices, the other oligopolists will not raise their prices, and so the firm that raised prices will lose a\nconsiderable share of sales. For example, if the firm raises its price to $550, its sales drop to 5,000 seats sold.\nThus, if oligopolists always match price cuts by other firms in the cartel, but do not match price increases, then\nnone of the oligopolists will have a strong incentive to change prices, since the potential gains are minimal.\nThis strategy can work like a silent form of cooperation, in which the cartel successfully manages to hold down\noutput, increaseprice, and share a monopoly level of profits even without any legally enforceable agreement.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.2 \u2022 Oligopoly 251\nFIGURE10.5A Kinked Demand CurveConsider a member firm in an oligopoly cartel that is supposed to produce a\nquantity of 10,000 and sell at a price of $500. The other members of the cartel can encourage this firm to honor its\ncommitments by acting so that the firm faces a kinked demand curve. If the oligopolist attempts to expand output\nand reduce price slightly, other firms also cut prices immediately\u2014so if the firm expands output to 11,000, the price\nper unit falls dramatically, to $300. On the other side, if the oligopoly attempts to raise its price, other firms will not\ndo so, so if the firm raises its price to $550, its sales decline sharply to 5,000. Thus, the members of a cartel can\ndiscipline each other to stick to the pre-agreed levels of quantity and price through a strategy of matching all price\ncuts but not matching any price increases.\nMany real-world oligopolies, prodded by economic changes, legal and political pressures, and the egos of their\ntop executives, go through episodes of cooperation and competition. If oligopolies could sustain cooperation\nwith each other on output and pricing, they could earn profits as if they were a single monopoly. However, each\nfirm in an oligopoly has an incentive to produce more and grab a bigger share of the overall market; when\nfirms start behaving in this way, the market outcome in terms of prices and quantity can be similar to that of a\nhighly competitive market.\nTradeoffs of Imperfect Competition\nMonopolistic competition is probably the single most common market structure in the U.S. economy. It\nprovides powerful incentives for innovation, as firms seek to earn profits in the short run, while entry assures\nthat firms do not earn economic profits in the long run. However, monopolistically competitive firms do not\nproduce at the lowest point on their average cost curves. In addition, the endless search to impress consumers\nthrough product differentiation may lead to excessive social expenses on advertising and marketing.\nOligopoly is probably the second most common market structure. When oligopolies result from patented\ninnovations or from taking advantage of economies of scale to produce at low average cost, they may provide\nconsiderable benefit to consumers. Oligopolies are often buffered by significant barriers to entry, which enable\nthe oligopolists to earn sustained profits over long periods of time. Oligopolists also do not typically produce at\nthe minimum of their average cost curves. When they lack vibrant competition, they may lack incentives to\nprovide innovative products and high-quality service.\nThe task of public policy with regard to competition is to sort through these multiple realities, attempting to\nencourage behavior that is beneficial to the broader society and to discourage behavior that only adds to the\nprofits of a few large companies, with no corresponding benefit to consumers.Monopoly and Antitrust Policy\ndiscusses the delicate judgments that go into this task. 252 10 \u2022 Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly\nBRING IT HOME\nThe Temptation to Defy the Law\nOligopolistic firms have been called \u201ccats in a bag,\u201d as this chapter mentioned. The French detergent makers chose\nto \u201ccozy up\u201d with each other. The result? An uneasy and tenuous relationship. When theWall Street Journalreported\non the matter, it wrote: \u201cAccording to a statement a Henkel manager made to the [French anti-trust] commission,\nthe detergent makers wanted \u2018to limit the intensity of the competition between them and clean up the market.\u2019\nNevertheless, by the early 1990s, a price war had broken out among them.\u201d During the soap executives\u2019 meetings,\nsometimes lasting more than four hours, the companies established complex pricing structures. \u201cOne [soap]\nexecutive recalled \u2018chaotic\u2019 meetings as each side tried to work out how the other had bent the rules.\u201d Like many\ncartels, the soap cartel disintegrated due to the very strong temptation for each member to maximize its own\nindividual profits.\nHow did this soap opera end? After an investigation, French antitrust authorities fined Colgate-Palmolive, Henkel,\nand Proctor & Gamble a total of \u20ac361 million ($484 million). A similar fate befell the icemakers. Bagged ice is a\ncommodity, a perfect substitute, generally sold in 7- or 22-pound bags. No one cares what label is on the bag. By\nagreeing to carve up the ice market, control broad geographic swaths of territory, and set prices, the icemakers\nmoved from perfect competition to a monopoly model. After the agreements, each firm was the sole supplier of\nbagged ice to a region. There were profits in both the long run and the short run. According to the courts: \u201cThese\ncompanies illegally conspired to manipulate the marketplace.\u201d Fines totaled about $600,000\u2014a steep fine\nconsidering a bag of ice sells for under $3 in most parts of the United States.\nEven though it is illegal in many parts of the world for firms to set prices and carve up a market, the temptation to\nearn higher profits makes it extremely tempting to defy the law.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10 \u2022 Key Terms 253\nKey Terms\ncartel a group of firms that collude to produce the monopoly output and sell at the monopoly price\ncollusion when firms act together to reduce output and keep prices high\ndifferentiated product a product that consumers perceive as distinctive in some way\nduopoly an oligopoly with only two firms\ngame theory a branch of mathematics that economists use to analyze situations in which players must make\ndecisions and then receive payoffs based on what decisions the other players make\nimperfectly competitive firms and organizations that fall between the extremes of monopoly and perfect\ncompetition\nkinked demand curve a perceived demand curve that arises when competing oligopoly firms commit to\nmatch price cuts, but not price increases\nmonopolistic competition many firms competing to sell similar but differentiated products\noligopoly when a few large firms have all or most of the sales in an industry\nprisoner\u2019s dilemma a game in which the gains from cooperation are larger than the rewards from pursuing\nself-interest\nproduct differentiation any action that firms do to make consumers think their products are different from\ntheir competitors'\nKey Concepts and Summary\n10.1Monopolistic Competition\nMonopolistic competition refers to a market where many firms sell differentiated products. Differentiated\nproducts can arise from characteristics of the good or service, location from which the firm sells the product,\nintangible aspects of the product, and perceptions of the product.\nThe perceived demand curve for a monopolistically competitive firm is downward-sloping, which shows that it\nis a price maker and chooses a combination of price and quantity. However, the perceived demand curve for a\nmonopolistic competitor is more elastic than the perceived demand curve for a monopolist, because the\nmonopolistic competitor has direct competition, unlike the pure monopolist. A profit-maximizing\nmonopolistic competitor will seek out the quantity where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost. The\nmonopolistic competitor will produce that level of output and charge the price that the firm\u2019s demand curve\nindicates.\nIf the firms in a monopolistically competitive industry are earning economic profits, the industry will attract\nentry until profits are driven down to zero in the long run. If the firms in a monopolistically competitive\nindustry are suffering economic losses, then the industry will experience exit of firms until economic losses\nare driven up to zero in the long run.\nA monopolistically competitive firm is not productively efficient because it does not produce at the minimum\nof its average cost curve. A monopolistically competitive firm is not allocatively efficient because it does not\nproduce where P = MC, but instead produces where P > MC. Thus, a monopolistically competitive firm will tend\nto produce a lower quantity at a higher cost and to charge a higher price than a perfectly competitive firm.\nMonopolistically competitive industries do offer benefits to consumers in the form of greater variety and\nincentives for improved products and services. There is some controversy over whether a market-oriented\neconomy generates too much variety.\n10.2Oligopoly\nAn oligopoly is a situation where a few firms sell most or all of the goods in a market. Oligopolists earn their\nhighest profits if they can band together as a cartel and act like a monopolist by reducing output and raising\nprice. Since each member of the oligopoly can benefit individually from expanding output, such collusion\noften breaks down\u2014especially since explicit collusion is illegal. 254 10 \u2022 Self-Check Questions\nThe prisoner\u2019s dilemma is an example of the application of game theory to analysis of oligopoly. It shows how,\nin certain situations, all sides can benefit from cooperative behavior rather than self-interested behavior.\nHowever, the challenge for the parties is to find ways to encourage cooperative behavior.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1. Suppose that, due to a successful advertising campaign, a monopolistic competitor experiences an\nincrease in demand for its product. How will that affect the price it charges and the quantity it supplies?\n2. Continuing with the scenario in question 1, in the long run, the positive economic profits that the\nmonopolistic competitor earns will attract a response either from existing firms in the industry or firms\noutside. As those firms capture the original firm\u2019s profit, what will happen to the original firm\u2019s profit-\nmaximizing price and output levels?\n3. Consider the curve in the figure below, which shows the market demand, marginal cost, and marginal\nrevenue curve for firms in an oligopolistic industry. In this example, we assume firms have zero fixed\ncosts.\nFIGURE10.6\na. Suppose the firms collude to form a cartel. What price will the cartel charge? What quantity will the\ncartel supply? How much profit will the cartel earn?\nb. Suppose now that the cartel breaks up and the oligopolistic firms compete as vigorously as possible by\ncutting the price and increasing sales. What will be the industry quantity and price? What will be the\ncollective profits of all firms in the industry?\nc. Compare the equilibrium price, quantity, and profit for the cartel and cutthroat competition outcomes.\n4. Sometimes oligopolies in the same industry are very different in size. Suppose we have a duopoly where\none firm (Firm A) is large and the other firm (Firm B) is small, as the prisoner\u2019s dilemma box inTable 10.4\nshows.\nFirm B colludes with Firm A Firm B cheats by selling more output\nFirm A colludes with Firm B A gets $1,000, B gets $100 A gets $800, B gets $200\nFirm A cheats by selling more output A gets $1,050, B gets $50 A gets $500, B gets $20\nTABLE10.4\nAssuming that both firms know the payoffs, what is the likely outcome in this case?\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10 \u2022 Review Questions 255\nReview Questions\n5. What is the relationship between product differentiation and monopolistic competition?\n6. How is the perceived demand curve for a monopolistically competitive firm different from the perceived\ndemand curve for a monopoly or a perfectly competitive firm?\n7. How does a monopolistic competitor choose its profit-maximizing quantity of output and price?\n8. How can a monopolistic competitor tell whether the price it is charging will cause the firm to earn profits\nor experience losses?\n9. If the firms in a monopolistically competitive market are earning economic profits or losses in the short\nrun, would you expect them to continue doing so in the long run? Why?\n10. Is a monopolistically competitive firm productively efficient? Is it allocatively efficient? Why or why not?\n11. Will the firms in an oligopoly act more like a monopoly or more like competitors? Briefly explain.\n12. Does each individual in a prisoner\u2019s dilemma benefit more from cooperation or from pursuing self-\ninterest? Explain briefly.\n13. What stops oligopolists from acting together as a monopolist and earning the highest possible level of\nprofits?\nCritical Thinking Questions\n14. Aside from advertising, how can monopolistically competitive firms increase demand for their products?\n15. Make a case for why monopolistically competitive industries never reach long-run equilibrium.\n16. Would you rather have efficiency or variety? That is, one opportunity cost of the variety of products we\nhave is that each product costs more per unit than if there were only one kind of product of a given type,\nlike shoes. Perhaps a better question is, \u201cWhat is the right amount of variety? Can there be too many\nvarieties of shoes, for example?\u201d\n17. Would you expect the kinked demand curve to be more extreme (like a right angle) or less extreme (like a\nnormal demand curve) if each firm in the cartel produces a near-identical product like OPEC and\npetroleum? What if each firm produces a somewhat different product? Explain your reasoning.\n18. When OPEC raised the price of oil dramatically in the mid-1970s, experts said it was unlikely that the\ncartel could stay together over the long term\u2014that the incentives for individual members to cheat would\nbecome too strong. More than forty years later, OPEC still exists. Why do you think OPEC has been able to\nbeat the odds and continue to collude?Hint:You may wish to consider non-economic reasons. 256 10 \u2022 Problems\nProblems\n19.

You may even use natural gas for cooking. However, those uses are not the primary uses of natural gas\nin the U.S. In late 2021, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, home heating, cooling, and\ncooking accounted for nearly 20% of natural gas usage. What accounts for the rest? The greatest uses for natural\ngas are the generation of electric power (almost 37%) and in industry (30%). Together these three uses for natural\ngas touch many areas of our lives, so why would there be any opposition to a merger of two natural gas firms? After\nall, a merger could mean increased efficiencies and reduced costs to people like you and me.\nIn October 2011, Kinder Morgan and El Paso Corporation, two natural gas firms, announced they were merging. The\nannouncement stated the combined firm would link \u201cnearly every major production region with markets,\u201d cut costs\nby \u201celiminating duplication in pipelines and other assets,\u201d and that \u201cthe savings could be passed on to consumers.\u201d\nThe objection? The $21.1 billion deal would give Kinder Morgan control of more than 80,000 miles of pipeline,\nmaking the new firm the third largest energy producer in North America. Policymakers and the public wondered 260 11 \u2022 Monopoly and Antitrust Policy\nwhether the new conglomerate really would pass on cost savings to consumers, or would the merger give Kinder\nMorgan a strong oligopoly position in the natural gas marketplace?\nThat brings us to the central questions this chapter poses: What should the balance be between corporate size and\na larger number of competitors in a marketplace, and what role should the government play in this balancing act?\nThe previous chapters on the theory of the firm identified three important lessons: First, that competition, by\nproviding consumers with lower prices and a variety of innovative products, is a good thing; second, that large-\nscale production can dramatically lower average costs; and third, that markets in the real world are rarely\nperfectly competitive. As a consequence, government policymakers must determine how much to intervene to\nbalance the potential benefits of large-scale production against the potential loss of competition that can occur\nwhen businesses grow in size, especially through mergers.\nFor example, in 2006, AT&T and BellSouth proposed a merger. At the time, there were very few mobile phone\nservice providers. Both the Justice Department and the FCC blocked the proposal.\nThe two companies argued that the merger would benefit consumers, who would be able to purchase better\ntelecommunications services at a cheaper price because the newly created firm would take advantage of\neconomies of scale and eliminate duplicate investments. However, a number of activist groups like the\nConsumer Federation of America and Public Knowledge expressed fears that the merger would reduce\ncompetition and lead to higher prices for consumers for decades to come. In December 2006, the federal\ngovernment allowed the merger to proceed. By 2009, the new post-merger AT&T was the eighth largest\ncompany by revenues in the United States, and by that measure the largest telecommunications company in\nthe world. Economists have spent \u2013 and will still spend \u2013 years trying to determine whether the merger of\nAT&T and BellSouth, as well as other smaller mergers of telecommunications companies at about this same\ntime, helped consumers, hurt them, or did not make much difference.\nThis chapter discusses public policy issues about competition. How can economists and governments\ndetermine when mergers of large companies like AT&T and BellSouth should be allowed and when they should\nbe blocked? The government also plays a role in policing anticompetitive behavior other than mergers, like\nprohibiting certain kinds of contracts that might restrict competition. In the case of natural monopoly,\nhowever, trying to preserve competition probably will not work very well, and so government will often resort\nto regulation of price and/or quantity of output. In recent decades, there has been a global trend toward less\ngovernment intervention in the price and output decisions of businesses.\n11.1Corporate Mergers\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain antitrust law and its significance\n\u2022 Calculate concentration ratios\n\u2022 Calculate the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)\n\u2022 Evaluate methods of antitrust regulation\nA corporatemergeroccurs when two formerly separate firms combine to become a single firm. When one firm\npurchases another, it is called anacquisition. An acquisition may not look just like a merger, since the newly\npurchased firm may continue to operate under its former company name. Mergers can also be lateral, where\ntwo firms of similar sizes combine to become one. However, both mergers and acquisitions lead to two\nformerly separate firms operating under common ownership, and so they are commonly grouped together.\nRegulations for Approving Mergers\nSince a merger combines two firms into one, it can reduce the extent of competition between firms. Therefore,\nwhen two U.S. firms announce a merger or acquisition where at least one of the firms is above a minimum size\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.1 \u2022 Corporate Mergers 261\nof sales (a threshold that moves up gradually over time, and was at $101 million in 2022), or certain other\nconditions are met, they are required under law to notify the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The left-\nhand panel ofFigure 11.2(a) shows the number of mergers submitted for review to the FTC each year from\n1999 to 2012. Mergers follow the business cycle, falling after the 2001 recession, peaking in 2007 as the Great\nRecession struck, and then rising since 2009. The right-hand panel ofFigure 11.2(b) shows the distribution of\nthose mergers submitted for review in 2015 as measured by the size of the transaction. It is important to\nremember that this total leaves out many small mergers under $50 million, which companies only need to\nreport in certain limited circumstances. In 2012, 26 percent of all reported merger and acquisition\ntransactions exceeded $500 million, while 11 percent exceeded $1 billion.\nFIGURE11.2Number and Size of Mergers(a) The number of mergers grew from 2003 to 2007, then fell\ndramatically during the 2008-2009 Great Recession, before recovering since. (b) In 2012, the greatest number of\nmergers submitted for review by the Federal Trade Commission was for transactions between $100\u2013$150 million.\nThe laws that give government the power to block certain mergers, and even in some cases to break up large\nfirms into smaller ones, are calledantitrust laws. Before a large merger happens, the antitrust regulators at\nthe FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice can allow the merger, prohibit it, or allow it if certain conditions are\nmet. One common condition is that the merger will be allowed if the firm agrees to sell off certain parts. For\nexample, in 2006, Johnson & Johnson bought the Pfizer\u2019s \u201cconsumer health\u201d division, which included well-\nknown brands like Listerine mouthwash and Sudafed cold medicine. As a condition of allowing the merger,\nJohnson & Johnson was required to sell off six brands to other firms, including Zantac\u00ae heartburn relief\nmedication, Cortizone anti-itch cream, and Balmex diaper rash medication, to preserve a greater degree of\ncompetition in these markets.\nThe U.S. government approves most proposed mergers. In a market-oriented economy, firms have the freedom\nto make their own choices. Private firms generally have the freedom to:\n\u2022 expand or reduce production\n\u2022 set the price they choose\n\u2022 open new factories or sales facilities or close them\n\u2022 hire workers or to lay them off\n\u2022 start selling new products or stop selling existing ones\nIf the owners want to acquire a firm or be acquired, or to merge with another firm, this decision is just one of\nmany that firms are free to make. In these conditions, the managers of private firms will sometimes make\nmistakes. They may close down a factory which, it later turns out, would have been profitable. They may start\nselling a product that ends up losing money. A merger between two companies can sometimes lead to a clash 262 11 \u2022 Monopoly and Antitrust Policy\nof corporate personalities that makes both firms worse off. However, the fundamental belief behind a market-\noriented economy is that firms, not governments, are in the best position to know if their actions will lead to\nattracting more customers or producing more efficiently.\nGovernment regulators agree that most mergers are beneficial to consumers. As the Federal Trade\nCommission has noted on its website (as of November, 2013): \u201cMost mergers actually benefit competition and\nconsumers by allowing firms to operate more efficiently.\u201d At the same time, the FTC recognizes, \u201cSome\n[mergers] are likely to lessen competition. That, in turn, can lead to higher prices, reduced availability of goods\nor services, lower quality of products, and less innovation. Some mergers create a concentrated market, while\nothers enable a single firm to raise prices.\u201d The challenge for the antitrust regulators at the FTC and the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice is to figure out when a merger may hinder competition. This decision involves both\nnumerical tools and some judgments that are difficult to quantify. The following Clear It Up explains the\norigins of U.S. antitrust law.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat is U.S. antitrust law?\nIn the closing decades of the 1800s, many industries in the U.S. economy were dominated by a single firm that had\nmost of the sales for the entire country. Supporters of these large firms argued that they could take advantage of\neconomies of scale and careful planning to provide consumers with products at low prices. However, critics pointed\nout that when competition was reduced, these firms were free to charge more and make permanently higher profits,\nand that without the goading of competition, it was not clear that they were as efficient or innovative as they could\nbe.\nIn many cases, these large firms were organized in the legal form of a \u201ctrust,\u201d in which a group of formerly\nindependent firms were consolidated by mergers and purchases, and a group of \u201ctrustees\u201d then ran the companies\nas if they were a single firm. Thus, when the U.S. government sought to limit the power of these trusts, it passed the\nSherman Antitrust Actin 1890 - the nation's first antitrust law. In an early demonstration of the law\u2019s power, the\nU.S. Supreme Court in 1911 upheld the government\u2019s right to break up Standard Oil, which had controlled about\n90% of the country\u2019s oil refining, into 34 independent firms, including Exxon, Mobil, Amoco, and Chevron. In 1914,\ntheClayton Antitrust Actoutlawed mergers and acquisitions (where the outcome would be to \u201csubstantially lessen\ncompetition\u201d in an industry), price discrimination (where different customers are charged different prices for the\nsame product), and tied sales (where purchase of one product commits the buyer to purchase some other product).\nAlso in 1914, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was created to define more specifically what competition was\nunfair. In 1950, theCeller-Kefauver Actextended the Clayton Act by restricting vertical and conglomerate mergers.\nA vertical merger occurs when two or more firms, operating at different levels within an industry's supply chain,\nmerge operations. A conglomerate merger is a merger between firms that are involved in totally unrelated business\nactivities. In the twenty-first century, the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice continue to enforce antitrust laws.\nThe Four-Firm Concentration Ratio\nRegulators have struggled for decades to measure the degree of monopoly power in an industry. An early tool\nwas theconcentration ratio, which measures the combined market share (or percent of total industry sales)\nwhich is accounted for by the largest firms (typically the top four to eight). For an explanation of how high\nmarket concentrations can create inefficiencies in an economy, refer toMonopoly.\nSay that the market for replacing broken automobile windshields in a certain city has 18 firms with the market\nshares inTable 11.1, where themarket shareis each firm\u2019s proportion of total sales in that market. We\ncalculate the four-firm concentration ratio by adding the market shares of the four largest firms: in this case,\n16 + 10 + 8 + 6 = 40. We do not consider this concentration ratio especially high, because the largest four firms\nhave less than half the market.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.1 \u2022 Corporate Mergers 263\nIf the market shares for replacing automobile windshields are:\nSmooth as Glass Repair Company 16% of the market\nThe Auto Glass Doctor Company 10% of the market\nYour Car Shield Company 8% of the market\nSeven firms that each have 6% of the market 42% of the market, combined\nEight firms that each have 3% of the market 24% of the market, combined\nThen the four-firm concentration ratio is 16 + 10 + 8 + 6 = 40.\nTABLE11.1Calculating Concentration Ratios from Market Shares\nThe concentration ratio approach can help to clarify some of the fuzziness over deciding when a merger might\naffect competition. For instance, if two of the smallest firms in the hypothetical market for repairing\nautomobile windshields merged, the four-firm concentration ratio would not change\u2014which implies that there\nis not much worry that the degree of competition in the market has notably diminished. However, if the top two\nfirms merged, then the four-firm concentration ratio would become 46 (that is, 26 + 8 + 6 + 6). While this\nconcentration ratio is modestly higher, the four-firm concentration ratio would still be less than half, so such a\nproposed merger might barely raise an eyebrow among antitrust regulators.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/Google_FTC)to read an article about Google\u2019s run-in with the FTC.\nThe Herfindahl-Hirschman Index\nA four-firm concentration ratio is a simple tool, which may reveal only part of the story. For example, consider\ntwo industries that both have a four-firm concentration ratio of 80. However, in one industry five firms each\ncontrol 20% of the market, while in the other industry, the top firm holds 77% of the market and all the other\nfirms have 1% each. Although the four-firm concentration ratios are identical, it would be reasonable to worry\nmore about the extent of competition in the second case\u2014where the largest firm is nearly a monopoly\u2014than in\nthe first.\nAnother approach to measuring industry concentration that can distinguish between these two cases is called\ntheHerfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). We calculate HHI by summing the squares of the market share of\neach firm in the industry, as the following Work It Out shows.\nWORK IT OUT\nCalculating HHI\nStep 1. Calculate the HHI for a monopoly with a market share of 100%. Because there is only one firm, it has\n100% market share. The HHI is 1002= 10,000.\nStep 2. For an extremely competitive industry, with dozens or hundreds of extremely small competitors, the HHI\nvalue might drop as low as 100 or even less. Calculate the HHI for an industry with 100 firms that each have 1%\nof the market. In this case, the HHI is 100(12) = 100.\nStep 3. Calculate the HHI for the industry inTable 11.1. In this case, the HHI is 162+ 102+ 82+ 7(62) + 8(32) =\n744. 264 11 \u2022 Monopoly and Antitrust Policy\nStep 4. Note that the HHI gives greater weight to large firms.\nStep 5. Consider the earlier example, comparing one industry where five firms each have 20% of the market with\nan industry where one firm has 77% and the other 23 firms have 1% each. The two industries have the same\nfour-firm concentration ratio of 80. However, the HHI for the first industry is 5(202) = 2,000, while the HHI for the\nsecond industry is much higher at 772+ 23(12) = 5,952.\nStep 6. Note that the near-monopolist in the second industry drives up the HHI measure of industrial\nconcentration.\nStep 7. ReviewTable 11.2which gives some examples of the four-firm concentration ratio and the HHI in various\nU.S. industries in 2016. (You can find market share data from multiple industry sources. Data in the table are\nfrom: Statista.com (for wireless),The Wall Street Journal(for automobiles), Gartner.com (for computers) and the\nU.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics (for airlines).)\nU.S. Industry Four-Firm Ratio HHI\nWireless 98 2,736\nLargest five: Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, US Cellular\nPersonal Computers 76 1,234\nLargest five: HP, Lenovo, Dell, Asus, Apple, Acer\nAirlines 69 1,382\nLargest five: American, Southwest, Delta, United, JetBlue\nAutomobiles 58 1,099\nLargest five: Ford, GM, Toyota, Chrysler, Nissan\nTABLE11.2Examples of Concentration Ratios and HHIs in the U.S. Economy, 2016\nIn the 1980s, the FTC followed these guidelines: If a merger would result in an HHI of less than 1,000, the FTC\nwould probably approve it. If a merger would result in an HHI of more than 1,800, the FTC would probably\nchallenge it. If a merger would result in an HHI between 1,000 and 1,800, then the FTC would scrutinize the\nplan and make a case-by-case decision. However, in the last several decades, the antitrust enforcement\nauthorities have moved away from relying as heavily on measures of concentration ratios and HHIs to\ndetermine whether they will allow a merger, and instead they carry out more case-by-case analysis on the\nextent of competition in different industries.\nNew Directions for Antitrust\nBoth the four-firm concentration ratio and the Herfindahl-Hirschman index share some weaknesses. First,\nthey begin from the assumption that the \u201cmarket\u201d under discussion is well-defined, and the only question is\nmeasuring how sales are divided in that market. Second, they are based on an implicit assumption that\ncompetitive conditions across industries are similar enough that a broad measure of concentration in the\nmarket is enough to make a decision about the effects of a merger. These assumptions, however, are not always\ncorrect. In response to these two problems, the antitrust regulators have been changing their approach in the\nlast decade or two.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.1 \u2022 Corporate Mergers 265\nDefining amarketis often controversial. For example, Microsoft in the early 2000s had a dominant share of\nthe software for computer operating systems. However, in the total market for all computer software and\nservices, including everything from games to scientific programs, the Microsoft share was only about 14% in\n2014. A narrowly defined market will tend to make concentration appear higher, while a broadly defined\nmarket will tend to make it appear smaller.\nIn recent decades, there have been two especially important shifts affecting how we define markets: one\ncenters on technology and the other centers onglobalization. In addition, these two shifts are interconnected.\nWith the vast improvement in communications technologies, including the development of the internet, a\nconsumer can order books or pet supplies from all over the country or the world. As a result, the degree of\ncompetition many local retail businesses face has increased. The same effect may operate even more strongly\nin markets for business supplies, where so-called \u201cbusiness-to-business\u201d websites can allow buyers and\nsuppliers from anywhere in the world to find each other.\nGlobalization has changed the market boundaries. As recently as the 1970s, it was common for measurements\nof concentration ratios and HHIs to stop at national borders. Now, many industries find that their competition\ncomes from the global market. A few decades ago, three companies, General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler,\ndominated the U.S. auto market. By 2014, however, production of these three firms accounted for less than half\nof U.S. auto sales, although by 2021, with the emergence of COVID-19, the three firms accounted for essentially\nhalf of U.S. auto sales. The three firms face competition from well-known car manufacturers such as Toyota,\nHonda, Nissan, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, and Mazda. When analysts calculate HHIs with a global perspective,\nconcentration in most major industries\u2014including cars\u2014is lower than in a purely domestic context.\nBecause attempting to define a particular market can be difficult and controversial, the Federal Trade\nCommission has begun to look less at market share and more at the data on actual competition between\nbusinesses. For example, in February 2007, Whole Foods Market and Wild Oats Market announced that they\nwished to merge. These were the two largest companies in the market that the government defined as\n\u201cpremium natural and organic supermarket chains.\u201d However, one could also argue that they were two\nrelatively small companies in the broader market for all stores that sell groceries or specialty food products.\nRather than relying on a market definition, the government antitrust regulators looked at detailed evidence on\nprofits and prices for specific stores in different cities, both before and after other competitive stores entered\nor exited. Based on that evidence, the Federal Trade Commission decided to block the merger. After two years\nof legal battles, the FTC eventually allowed the merger in 2009 under the conditions that Whole Foods sell off\nthe Wild Oats brand name and a number of individual stores, to preserve competition in certain local markets.\nFor more on the difficulties of defining markets, refer toMonopoly.\nThis new approach to antitrust regulation involves detailed analysis of specific markets and companies,\ninstead of defining a market and counting up total sales. A common starting point is for antitrust regulators to\nuse statistical tools and real-world evidence to estimate thedemand curvesandsupply curvesthe firms\nproposing a merger face. A second step is to specify how competition occurs in this specific industry. Some\npossibilities include competing to cut prices, to raise output, to build a brand name through advertising, and to\nbuild a reputation for good service or high quality. With these pieces of the puzzle in place, it is then possible to\nbuild a statistical model that estimates the likely outcome for consumers if the two firms are allowed to merge.\nThese models do require some degree of subjective judgment, and so they can become the subject of legal\ndisputes between the antitrust authorities and the companies that wish to merge. 266 11 \u2022 Monopoly and Antitrust Policy\n11.2Regulating Anticompetitive Behavior\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Analyze restrictive practices\n\u2022 Explain tying sales, bundling, and predatory pricing\n\u2022 Evaluate a real-world situation of possible anticompetitive and restrictive practices\nThe U.S. antitrust laws reach beyond blocking mergers that would reduce competition to include a wide array\nof anticompetitive practices. For example, it is illegal for competitors to form a cartel to collude to make\npricing and output decisions, as if they were a monopoly firm. The Federal Trade Commission and the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice prohibit firms from agreeing to fix prices or output, rigging bids, or sharing or dividing\nmarkets by allocating customers, suppliers, territories, or lines of commerce.\nIn the late 1990s, for example, the antitrust regulators prosecuted an international cartel of vitamin\nmanufacturers, including the Swiss firm Hoffman-La Roche, the German firm BASF, and the French firm\nRhone-Poulenc. These firms reached agreements on how much to produce, how much to charge, and which\nfirm would sell to which customers. Firms like General Mills, Kellogg, Purina Mills, and Proctor and Gamble\nbought the high-priced vitamins, which pushed up the prices more. Hoffman-La Roche pleaded guilty in May\n1999 and agreed both to pay a fine of $500 million and to have at least one top executive be incarcerated for\nfour months.\nUnder U.S. antitrust laws, monopoly itself is not illegal. If a firm has a monopoly because of a newly patented\ninvention, for example, the law explicitly allows a firm to earn higher-than-normal profits for a time as a\nreward for innovation. If a firm achieves a large share of the market by producing a better product at a lower\nprice, such behavior is not prohibited by antitrust law.\nRestrictive Practices\nAntitrust law includes rules againstrestrictive practices\u2014practices that do not involve outright agreements to\nraise price or to reduce the quantity produced, but that might have the effect of reducing competition.\nAntitrust cases involving restrictive practices are often controversial, because they delve into specific\ncontracts or agreements between firms that are allowed in some cases but not in others.\nFor example, anexclusive dealingagreement between a manufacturer and a dealer can be legal or illegal. It is\nlegal if the purpose of the contract is to encourage competition between dealers. For example, it is legal for the\nFord Motor Company to sell its cars to only Ford dealers, and for General Motors to sell to only GM dealers, and\nso on. However, exclusive deals may also limit competition. If one large retailer obtained the exclusive rights to\nbe the sole distributor of televisions, computers, and audio equipment made by a number of companies, then\nthis exclusive contract would have an anticompetitive effect on other retailers.\nTying saleshappen when a customer is allowed to buy one product only if the customer also buys a second\nproduct. Tying sales are controversial because they force consumers to purchase a product that they may not\nactually want or need. Further, the additional, required products are not necessarily advantageous to the\ncustomer. Suppose that to purchase a popular DVD, the store required that you also purchase a certain\nportable TV model. These products are only loosely related, thus there is no reason to make the purchase of\none contingent on the other. Even if a customer were interested in a portable TV, the tying to a particular\nmodel prevents the customer from having the option of selecting one from the numerous types available in the\nmarket.\nA related, but not identical, concept isbundling, where a firm sells two or more products as one. Bundling\ntypically offers an advantage for consumers by allowing them to acquire multiple products or services for a\nbetter price. For example, several cable companies allow customers to buy products like cable, internet, and a\nphone line through a special price available through bundling. Customers are also welcome to purchase these\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.2 \u2022 Regulating Anticompetitive Behavior 267\nproducts separately, but the price of bundling is usually more appealing.\nIn some cases, we can view tying sales and bundling as anticompetitive. However, in other cases they may be\nlegal and even common. It is common for people to purchase season tickets to a sports team or a set of\nconcerts so as to guarantee tickets to the few contests or shows that are most popular and likely to sell out.\nComputer software manufacturers may often bundle a number of different programs, even when the buyer\nwants only a few. Think about the software that is included in a new computer purchase, for example.\nRecall from the chapter onMonopolythatpredatory pricingoccurs when the existing firm (or firms) reacts to a\nnew firm by dropping prices very low, until the new firm is driven out of the market, at which point the existing\nfirm raises prices again. This pattern of pricing is aimed at deterring new firms from entering the market.\nHowever, in practice, it can be hard to figure out when pricing is predatory. Say that American Airlines is flying\nbetween two cities, and a new airline starts flying between the same two cities, at a lower price. If American\nAirlines cuts its price to match the new entrant, is this predatory pricing or is it just market competition at\nwork? A commonly proposed rule is that if a firm is selling for less than its average variable cost\u2014that is, at a\nprice where it should be shutting down\u2014then there is evidence for predatory pricing. However, calculating in\nthe real world what costs are variable and what costs are fixed is often not obvious, either.\nThe Microsoft antitrust case embodies many of these gray areas in restrictive practices, as the next Clear It Up\nshows.\nCLEAR IT UP\nDid Microsoft\u00aeengage in anticompetitive and restrictive practices?\nThe most famous restrictive practices case of recent years was a series of lawsuits by the U.S. government against\nMicrosoft\u2014lawsuits that some of Microsoft\u2019s competitors encouraged. All sides admitted that Microsoft\u2019s Windows\nprogram had a near-monopoly position in the market for the software used in general computer operating systems.\nAll sides agreed that the software had many satisfied customers and that the computer software capabilities were\ncompatible with Windows. Software that Microsoft and other companies produced had expanded dramatically in the\n1990s. Having amonopolyor a near-monopoly is not necessarily illegal in and of itself, but in cases where one\ncompany controls a great deal of the market, antitrust regulators look at any allegations of restrictive practices with\nspecial care.\nThe antitrust regulators argued that Microsoft had gone beyond profiting from its software innovations and its\ndominant position in the software market for operating systems, and had tried to use its market power in operating\nsystems software to take over other parts of the software industry. For example, the government argued that\nMicrosoft had engaged in an anticompetitive form of exclusive dealing by threatening computer makers that, if they\ndid not leave another firm\u2019s software off their machines (specifically, Netscape\u2019s Internet browser), then Microsoft\nwould not sell them its operating system software. Government antitrust regulators accused Microsoft of tying\ntogether its Windows operating system software, where it had a monopoly, with its Internet Explorer browser\nsoftware, where it did not have a monopoly, and thus using this bundling as an anticompetitive tool. The government\nalso accused Microsoft of a form of predatory pricing; namely, giving away certain additional software products for\nfree as part of Windows, as a way of driving out the competition from other software makers.\nIn April 2000, a federal court held that Microsoft\u2019s behavior had crossed the line into unfair competition, and\nrecommended that the company be split into two competing firms. However, the court overturned that penalty on\nappeal, and in November 2002 Microsoft reached a settlement with the government that it would end its restrictive\npractices.\nThe concept of restrictive practices is continually evolving, as firms seek new ways to earn profits and\ngovernment regulators define what is permissible. A situation where the law is evolving and changing is always\nsomewhat troublesome, since laws are most useful and fair when firms know what they are in advance. In 268 11 \u2022 Monopoly and Antitrust Policy\naddition, since the law is open to interpretation, competitors who are losing out in the market can accuse\nsuccessful firms of anticompetitive restrictive practices, and try to win through government regulation what\nthey have failed to accomplish in the market. Officials at the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of\nJustice are, of course, aware of these issues, but there is no easy way to resolve them.\n11.3Regulating Natural Monopolies\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Evaluate the appropriate competition policy for a natural monopoly\n\u2022 Interpret a graph of regulatory choices\n\u2022 Contrast cost-plus and price cap regulation\nMost true monopolies today in the U.S. are regulated, natural monopolies. A natural monopoly poses a difficult\nchallenge for competition policy, because the structure of costs and demand makes competition unlikely or\ncostly. Anatural monopolyarises when average costs are declining over the range of production that satisfies\nmarket demand. This typically happens when fixed costs are large relative to variable costs. As a result, one\nfirm is able to supply the total quantity demanded in the market at lower cost than two or more firms\u2014so\nsplitting up the natural monopoly would raise the average cost of production and force customers to pay more.\nPublic utilities, the companies that have traditionally provided water and electrical service across much of the\nUnited States, are leading examples of natural monopoly. It would make little sense to argue that a local water\ncompany should be divided into several competing companies, each with its own separate set of pipes and\nwater supplies. Installing four or five identical sets of pipes under a city, one for each water company, so that\neach household could choose its own water provider, would be terribly costly. The same argument applies to\nthe idea of having many competing companies for delivering electricity to homes, each with its own set of\nwires. Before the advent of wireless phones, the argument also applied to the idea of many different phone\ncompanies, each with its own set of phone wires running through the neighborhood.\nThe Choices in Regulating a Natural Monopoly\nWhat then is the appropriate competition policy for a natural monopoly?Figure 11.3illustrates the case of\nnatural monopoly, with a market demand curve that cuts through the downward-sloping portion of the\naverage cost curve. Points A, B, C, and F illustrate four of the main choices for regulation.Table 11.3outlines\nthe regulatory choices for dealing with a natural monopoly.\nFIGURE11.3Regulatory Choices in Dealing with Natural MonopolyA natural monopoly will maximize profits by\nproducing at the quantity where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal costs (MC) and by then looking to the\nmarket demand curve to see what price to charge for this quantity. This monopoly will produce at point A, with a\nquantity of 4 and a price of 9.3. If antitrust regulators split this company exactly in half, then each half would\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.3 \u2022 Regulating Natural Monopolies 269\nproduce at point B, with average costs of 9.75 and output of 2. The regulators might require the firm to produce\nwhere marginal cost crosses the market demand curve at point C. However, if the firm is required to produce at a\nquantity of 8 and sell at a price of 3.5, the firm will incur losses. The most likely choice is point F, where the firm is\nrequired to produce a quantity of 6 and charge a price of 6.5.\nQuantity Price Total Revenue* Marginal Revenue Total Cost Marginal Cost Average Cost\n1 14.7 14.7 14.7 11.0 - 11.00\n2 12.4 24.7 10.0 19.5 8.5 9.75\n3 10.6 31.7 7.0 25.5 6.0 8.50\n4 9.3 37.2 5.5 31.0 5.5 7.75\n5 8.0 40.0 2.8 35.0 4.0 7.00\n6 6.5 39.0 \u20131.0 39.0 4.0 6.50\n7 5.0 35.0 \u20134.0 42.0 3.0 6.00\n8 3.5 28.0 \u20137.0 45.5 3.5 5.70\n9 2.0 18.0 \u201310.0 49.5 4.0 5.5\nTABLE11.3Regulatory Choices in Dealing with Natural Monopoly(*We obtain total revenue by\nmultiplying price and quantity. However, we have rounded some of the price values in this table for\nease of presentation.)\nThe first possibility is to leave the natural monopoly alone. In this case, the monopoly will follow its normal\napproach to maximizing profits. It determines the quantity where MR = MC, which happens at point P at a\nquantity of 4. The firm then looks to point A on the demand curve to find that it can charge a price of 9.3 for\nthat profit-maximizing quantity. Since the price is above the average cost curve, the natural monopoly would\nearn economic profits.\nA second outcome arises if antitrust authorities decide to divide the company, so that the new firms can\ncompete. As a simple example, imagine that the company is cut in half. Thus, instead of one large firm\nproducing a quantity of 4, two half-size firms each produce a quantity of 2. Because of the declining average\ncost curve (AC), the average cost of production for each of the half-size companies producing 2, as point B\nshows, would be 9.75, while the average cost of production for a larger firm producing 4 would only be 7.75.\nThus, the economy would become less productively efficient, since the good is produced at a higher average\ncost. In a situation with a downward-sloping average cost curve, two smaller firms will always have higher\naverage costs of production than one larger firm for any quantity of total output. In addition, the antitrust\nauthorities must worry that splitting the natural monopoly into pieces may be only the start of their problems.\nIf one of the two firms grows larger than the other, it will have lower average costs and may be able to drive its\ncompetitor out of the market. Alternatively, two firms in a market may discover subtle ways of coordinating\ntheir behavior and keeping prices high. Either way, the result will not be the greater competition that was\ndesired.\nA third alternative is that regulators may decide to set prices and quantities produced for this industry. The\nregulators will try to choose a point along the market demand curve that benefits both consumers and the\nbroader social interest. Point C illustrates one tempting choice: the regulator requires that the firm produce\nthe quantity of output where marginal cost crosses the demand curve at an output of 8, and charge the price of 270 11 \u2022 Monopoly and Antitrust Policy\n3.5, which is equal tomarginal costat that point. This rule is appealing because it requires price to be set\nequal to marginal cost, which is what would occur in a perfectly competitive market, and it would assure\nconsumers a higher quantity and lower price than at the monopoly choice A. In fact, efficient allocation of\nresources would occur at point C, since the value to the consumers of the last unit bought and sold in this\nmarket is equal to the marginal cost of producing it.\nAttempting to bring about point C through force of regulation, however, runs into a severe difficulty. At point C,\nwith an output of 8, a price of 3.5 is below the average cost of production, which is 5.7, so if the firm charges a\nprice of 3.5, it will be suffering losses. Unless the regulators or the government offer the firm an ongoing public\nsubsidy (and there are numerous political problems with that option), the firm will lose money and go out of\nbusiness.\nPerhaps the most plausible option for the regulator is point F; that is, to set the price where AC crosses the\ndemand curve at an output of 6 and a price of 6.5. This plan makes some sense at an intuitive level: let the\nnatural monopoly charge enough to cover its average costs and earn a normal rate of profit, so that it can\ncontinue operating, but prevent the firm from raising prices and earning abnormally high monopoly profits, as\nit would at the monopoly choice A. Determining this level of output and price with the political pressures, time\nconstraints, and limited information of the real world is much harder than identifying the point on a graph. For\nmore on the problems that can arise from a centrally determined price, see the discussion of price floors and\nprice ceilings inDemand and Supply.\nCost-Plus versus Price Cap Regulation\nRegulators of public utilities for many decades followed the general approach of attempting to choose a point\nlike F inFigure 11.3. They calculated the average cost of production for the water or electricity companies,\nadded in an amount for the normal rate of profit the firm should expect to earn, and set the price for\nconsumers accordingly. This method was known ascost-plus regulation.\nCost-plus regulation raises difficulties of its own. If producers receive reimbursement for their costs, plus a bit\nmore, then at a minimum, producers have less reason to be concerned with high costs\u2014because they can just\npass them along in higher prices. Worse, firms under cost-plus regulation even have an incentive to generate\nhigh costs by building huge factories or employing many staff, because what they can charge is linked to the\ncosts they incur.\nThus, in the 1980s and 1990s, some public utility regulators began to useprice cap regulation, where the\nregulator sets a price that the firm can charge over the next few years. A common pattern was to require a price\nthat declined slightly over time. If the firm can find ways of reducing its costs more quickly than the price caps,\nit can make a high level of profits. However, if the firm cannot keep up with the price caps or suffers bad luck in\nthe market, it may suffer losses. A few years down the road, the regulators will then set a new series of price\ncaps based on the firm\u2019s performance.\nPrice cap regulation requires delicacy. It will not work if the price regulators set the price cap unrealistically\nlow. It may not work if the market changes dramatically so that the firm is doomed to incurring losses no\nmatter what it does\u2014say, if energy prices rise dramatically on world markets, then the company selling natural\ngas or heating oil to homes may not be able to meet price caps that seemed reasonable a year or two ago.\nHowever, if the regulators compare the prices with producers of the same good in other areas, they can, in\neffect, pressure a natural monopoly in one area to compete with the prices charged in other areas. Moreover,\nthe possibility of earning greater profits or experiencing losses\u2014instead of having an average rate of profit\nlocked in every year by cost-plus regulation\u2014can provide the natural monopoly with incentives for efficiency\nand innovation.\nWith natural monopoly, market competition is unlikely to take root, so if consumers are not to suffer the high\nprices and restricted output of an unrestricted monopoly, government regulation will need to play a role. In\nattempting to design a system of price cap regulation with flexibility and incentive, government regulators do\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.4 \u2022 The Great Deregulation Experiment 271\nnot have an easy task.\n11.4The Great Deregulation Experiment\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Evaluate the effectiveness of price regulation and antitrust policy\n\u2022 Explain regulatory capture and its significance\nGovernments at all levels across the United States have regulated prices in a wide range of industries. In some\ncases, like water and electricity that have natural monopoly characteristics, there is some room in economic\ntheory for such regulation. However, once politicians are given a basis to intervene in markets and to choose\nprices and quantities, it is hard to know where to stop.\nDoubts about Regulation of Prices and Quantities\nBeginning in the 1970s, it became clear to policymakers of all political leanings that the existing price\nregulation was not working well. The United States carried out a great policy experiment\u2014thederegulation\nthat we discussed inMonopoly\u2014removing government controls over prices and quantities produced in\nairlines, railroads, trucking, intercity bus travel, natural gas, and bank interest rates. The Clear It Up discusses\nthe outcome of deregulation in one industry in particular\u2014airlines.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat are the results of airline deregulation?\nWhy did the pendulum swing in favor of deregulation? Consider the airline industry. In the early days of air travel, no\nairline could make a profit just by flying passengers. Airlines needed something else to carry and the Postal Service\nprovided that something with airmail. Thus, the first U.S. government regulation of the airline industry happened\nthrough the Postal Service, when in 1926 the Postmaster General began giving airlines permission to fly certain\nroutes based on mail delivery needs\u2014and the airlines took some passengers along for the ride. In 1934, the\nantitrust authorities charged the Postmaster General with colluding with the major airlines of that day to monopolize\nthe nation\u2019s airways. In 1938, the U.S. government created the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) to regulate airfares\nand routes instead. For 40 years, from 1938 to 1978, the CAB approved all fares, controlled all entry and exit, and\nspecified which airlines could fly which routes. There was zero entry of new airlines on the main routes across the\ncountry for 40 years, because the CAB did not think it was necessary.\nIn 1978, the Airline Deregulation Act took the government out of the business of determining airfares and\nschedules. The new law shook up the industry. Famous old airlines like Pan American, Eastern, and Braniff went\nbankrupt and disappeared. Some new airlines like People Express were created\u2014and then vanished.\nThe greater competition from deregulation reduced airfares by about one-third over the next two decades, saving\nconsumers billions of dollars a year. The average flight used to take off with just half its seats full; now it is two-\nthirds full, which is far more efficient. Airlines have also developed hub-and-spoke systems, where planes all fly into\na central hub city at a certain time and then depart. As a result, one can fly between any of the spoke cities with just\none connection\u2014and there is greater service to more cities than before deregulation. With lower fares and more\nservice, the number of air passengers doubled from the late 1970s to the start of the 2000s\u2014an increase that, in\nturn, doubled the number of jobs in the airline industry. Meanwhile, with the watchful oversight of government\nsafety inspectors, commercial air travel has continued to get safer over time.\nThe U.S. airline industry is far from perfect. For example, a string of mergers in recent years has raised concerns over\nhow competition might be compromised.\nOne difficulty with government price regulation is what economists callregulatory capture, in which the firms 272 11 \u2022 Monopoly and Antitrust Policy\nthat are supposedly regulated end up playing a large role in setting the regulations that they will follow. When\nthe airline industry was regulated, for example, it suggested appointees to the regulatory board, sent lobbyists\nto argue with the board, provided most of the information on which the board made decisions, and offered\nwell-paid jobs to at least some of the people leaving the board. In this situation, it is easy for regulators to\npoorly represent consumers. The result of regulatory capture is that government price regulation can often\nbecome a way for existing competitors to work together to reduce output, keep prices high, and limit\ncompetition.\nThe Effects of Deregulation\nDeregulation, both of airlines and of other industries, has its negatives. The greater pressure of competition led\nto entry and exit. When firms went bankrupt or contracted substantially in size, they laid off workers who had\nto find other jobs. Market competition is, after all, a full-contact sport.\nA number of major accounting scandals involving prominent corporations such as Enron, Tyco International,\nand WorldCom led to theSarbanes-Oxley Actin 2002. The government designed Sarbanes-Oxley to increase\nconfidence in financial information provided by public corporations to protect investors from accounting\nfraud.\nThe Great Recession, which began in late 2007, was caused at least in part by a global financial crisis, which\nbegan in the United States. The key component of the crisis was the creation and subsequent failure of several\ntypes of unregulated financial assets, such as collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs, a type of mortgage-\nbacked security), and credit default swaps (CDSs, insurance contracts on assets like CMOs that provided a\npayoff even if the holder of the CDS did not own the CMO). Private credit rating agencies such as Standard &\nPoors, Moody\u2019s, and Fitch rated many of these assets very safe.\nThe collapse of the markets for these assets precipitated the financial crisis and led to the failure of Lehman\nBrothers, a major investment bank, numerous large commercial banks, such as Wachovia, and even the\nFederal National Mortgage Corporation (Fannie Mae), which had to be nationalized\u2014that is, taken over by the\nfederal government. One response to the financial crisis was theDodd-Frank Act, which majorly attempted to\nreform the financial system. The legislation\u2019s purpose, as noted on dodd-frank.com is:\nTo promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency\nin the financial system, to end \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts,\n[and] to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices. . .\nAll market-based economies operate against a background of laws and regulations, including laws about\nenforcing contracts, collecting taxes, and protecting health and the environment. The government policies that\nwe discussed in this chapter\u2014like blocking certain anticompetitive mergers, ending restrictive practices,\nimposing price cap regulation on natural monopolies, and deregulation\u2014demonstrate the role of government\nto strengthen the incentives that come with a greater degree of competition.\nBRING IT HOME\nMore than Cooking, Heating, and Cooling\nWhat did the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) decide on the Kinder Morgan / El Paso Corporation merger? After\ncareful examination, federal officials decided there was only one area of significant overlap that might provide the\nmerged firm with strong market power. The FTC approved the merger, provided Kinder Morgan divest itself of the\noverlap area. Tallgrass purchased Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission, Trailblazer Pipeline Co. LLC, two\nprocessing facilities in Wyoming, and Kinder Morgan\u2019s 50 percent interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline to meet\nthe FTC requirements. The FTC was attempting to strike a balance between potential cost reductions resulting from\neconomies of scale and concentration of market power.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.4 \u2022 The Great Deregulation Experiment 273\nDid the price of natural gas decrease? Yes, rather significantly. In 2010, the wellhead price of natural gas was $4.48\nper thousand cubic foot. In 2012 the price had fallen to just $2.66. Was the merger responsible for the large drop in\nprice? The answer is uncertain. The larger contributor to the sharp drop in price was the overall increase in the\nsupply of natural gas. Increasingly, more natural gas was able to be recovered by fracturing shale deposits, a\nprocess called fracking. Fracking, which is controversial for environmental reasons, enabled the recovery of known\nreserves of natural gas that previously were not economically feasible to tap. Kinder Morgan\u2019s control of\n80,000-plus miles of pipeline likely made moving the gas from wellheads to end users smoother and allowed for an\neven greater benefit from the increased supply. 274 11 \u2022 Key Terms\nKey Terms\nacquisitionwhen one firm purchases another\nantitrust lawslaws that give government the power to block certain mergers, and even in some cases to break\nup large firms into smaller ones\nbundlinga situation in which multiple products are sold as one\nconcentration ratioan early tool to measure the degree of monopoly power in an industry; measures what\nshare of the total sales in the industry are accounted for by the largest firms, typically the top four to eight\nfirms\ncost-plus regulationwhen regulators permit a regulated firm to cover its costs and to make a normal level of\nprofit\nexclusive dealingan agreement that a dealer will sell only products from one manufacturer\nfour-firm concentration ratiothe percentage of the total sales in the industry that are accounted for by the\nlargest four firms\nHerfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)approach to measuring market concentration by adding the square of the\nmarket share of each firm in the industry\nmarket sharethe percentage of total sales in the market\nmergerwhen two formerly separate firms combine to become a single firm\nminimum resale price maintenance agreementan agreement that requires a dealer who buys from a\nmanufacturer to sell for at least a certain minimum price\nprice cap regulationwhen the regulator sets a price that a firm cannot exceed over the next few years\nregulatory capturewhen the supposedly regulated firms end up playing a large role in setting the regulations\nthat they will follow and as a result, they \u201ccapture\u201d the people usually through the promise of a job in that\n\u201cregulated\u201d industry once their term in government has ended\nrestrictive practicespractices that reduce competition but that do not involve outright agreements between\nfirms to raise prices or to reduce the quantity produced\ntying salesa situation where a customer is allowed to buy one product only if the customer also buys another\nproduct\nKey Concepts and Summary\n11.1Corporate Mergers\nA corporate merger involves two private firms joining together. An acquisition refers to one firm buying\nanother firm. In either case, two formerly independent firms become one firm. Antitrust laws seek to ensure\nactive competition in markets, sometimes by preventing large firms from forming through mergers and\nacquisitions, sometimes by regulating business practices that might restrict competition, and sometimes by\nbreaking up large firms into smaller competitors.\nA four-firm concentration ratio is one way of measuring the extent of competition in a market. We calculate it\nby adding the market shares\u2014that is, the percentage of total sales\u2014of the four largest firms in the market. A\nHerfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is another way of measuring the extent of competition in a market. We\ncalculate it by taking the market shares of all firms in the market, squaring them, and then summing the total.\nThe forces of globalization and new communications and information technology have increased the level of\ncompetition that many firms face by increasing the amount of competition from other regions and countries.\n11.2Regulating Anticompetitive Behavior\nAntitrust firms block authorities from openly colluding to form a cartel that will reduce output and raise\nprices. Companies sometimes attempt to find other ways around these restrictions and, consequently, many\nantitrust cases involve restrictive practices that can reduce competition in certain circumstances, like tie-in\nsales, bundling, and predatory pricing.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11 \u2022 Self-Check Questions 275\n11.3Regulating Natural Monopolies\nIn the case of a natural monopoly, market competition will not work well and so, rather than allowing an\nunregulated monopoly to raise price and reduce output, the government may wish to regulate price and/or\noutput. Common examples of regulation are public utilities, the regulated firms that often provide electricity\nand water service.\nCost-plus regulation refers to government regulating a firm which sets the price that a firm can charge over a\nperiod of time by looking at the firm\u2019s accounting costs and then adding a normal rate of profit. Price cap\nregulation refers to government regulation of a firm where the government sets a price level several years in\nadvance. In this case, the firm can either earn high profits if it manages to produce at lower costs or sell a\nhigher quantity than expected or suffer low profits or losses if costs are high or it sells less than expected.\n11.4The Great Deregulation Experiment\nThe U.S. economy experienced a wave of deregulation in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when the government\neliminated a number of regulations that had set prices and quantities produced in a number of industries.\nMajor accounting scandals in the early 2000s and, more recently, the Great Recession have spurred new\nregulation to prevent similar occurrences in the future. Regulatory capture occurs when the regulated\nindustries end up having a strong influence over what regulations exist.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1. Is it true that a merger between two firms that are not already in the top four by size can affect both the\nfour-firm concentration ratio and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index? Explain briefly.\n2.

It was a pipeline system designed to bring oil from Canada to\nthe refineries near the Gulf of Mexico, as well as to boost crude oil production in the United States. While a private\ncompany, TransCanada, planned to build and own the pipeline, U.S. government approval was required because of\nits size and location. There were four phases in plans to build the pipeline, and the first two of these had been in\noperation.\nSounds like a great idea, right? A pipeline that would move much needed crude oil to the Gulf refineries would\nincrease oil production for manufacturing needs, reduce price pressure at the gas pump, and increase overall\neconomic growth. Supporters argued that the pipeline would be one of the safest pipelines built yet, and would\nreduce America\u2019s dependence on politically vulnerable Middle Eastern oil imports. 282 12 \u2022 Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities\nNot so fast, said its critics. The Keystone XL would be constructed over an enormous aquifer (one of the largest in\nthe world) in the Midwest, and through an environmentally fragile area in Nebraska, causing great concern among\nenvironmentalists about possible destruction to the natural surroundings. They argued that leaks could taint\nvaluable water sources and pipeline construction could disrupt and even harm indigenous species. Environmentalist\ngroups fought government approval of the proposed pipeline construction, and in November 2015, the Obama\nadministration refused to grant the cross-border permit necessary to build the Keystone XL pipeline. In 2017, the\nTrump administration sought to grant the necessary cross-border permit, and legal challenges emerged. In 2021,\nPresident Biden, on his first day in office, canceled the cross-border permit, effectively ending (for now) the\nKeystone XL pipeline.\nEnvironmental concerns matter when discussing issues related to economic growth. However, how much should\neconomists factor in these issues when deciding policy? In the case of the pipeline, how do we know how much\ndamage it would cause when we do not know how to put a value on the environment? Would the pipeline's benefits\noutweigh the opportunity cost? The issue of how to balance economic progress with unintended effects on our\nplanet is the subject of this chapter.\nIn 1969, the Cuyahoga River in Ohio was so polluted that it spontaneously burst into flame. Air pollution was so\nbad at that time that Chattanooga, Tennessee was a city where, as an article fromSports Illustratedput it: \u201cthe\ndeath rate from tuberculosis was double that of the rest of Tennessee and triple that of the rest of the United\nStates, a city in which the filth in the air was so bad it melted nylon stockings off women\u2019s legs, in which\nexecutives kept supplies of clean white shirts in their offices so they could change when a shirt became too\ngray to be presentable, in which headlights were turned on at high noon because the sun was eclipsed by the\ngunk in the sky.\u201d\nThe problem of pollution arises for every economy in the world, whether high-income or low-income, and\nwhether market-oriented or command-oriented. Every country needs to strike some balance between\nproduction and environmental quality. This chapter begins by discussing how firms may fail to take certain\nsocial costs, like pollution, into their planning if they do not need to pay these costs. Traditionally, policies for\nenvironmental protection have focused on governmental limits on how much of each pollutant could be\nemitted. While this approach has had some success, economists have suggested a range of more flexible,\nmarket-oriented policies that reduce pollution at a lower cost. We will consider both approaches, but first let\u2019s\nsee how economists frame and analyze these issues.\n12.1The Economics of Pollution\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain and give examples of positive and negative externalities\n\u2022 Identify equilibrium price and quantity\n\u2022 Evaluate how firms can contribute to market failure\nFrom 1970 to 2020, the U.S. population increased by 63 percent, and the size of the U.S. economy increased by\nmore than 3.8-fold. Since the 1970s, however, the United States, using a variety of anti-pollution policies, has\nmade genuine progress against a number of pollutants.Table 12.1lists the change in carbon dioxide\nemissions by energy users (from residential to industrial) according to the U.S. Energy Information\nAdministration (EIA). The table shows that emissions of certain key air pollutants declined substantially from\n2007 to 2012. They dropped 740 million metric tons (MMT) a year\u2014a 12% reduction. This seems to indicate\nthat there has been progress made in the United States in reducing overall carbon dioxide emissions, which\ncontribute to the greenhouse effect.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.1 \u2022 The Economics of Pollution 283\nYear Coal Natural Gas Petroleum Total\n1973 1,221 1,175 2,325 4,721\n2007 2,171 1,245 2,587 6,016\n2020 875 1,648 2,042 4,576\nTABLE12.1Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Energy\nConsumption, by Source(Source: EIA Monthly\nEnergy Review)\nDespite the gradual reduction in emissions from fossil fuels, many important environmental issues remain.\nAlong with the still high levels of air and water pollution, other issues include hazardous waste disposal,\ndestruction of wetlands and other wildlife habitats, and the impact on human health from pollution.\nExternalities\nPrivate markets, such as the cell phone industry, offer an efficient way to put buyers and sellers together and\ndetermine what goods they produce, how they produce them and who gets them. The principle that voluntary\nexchange benefits both buyers and sellers is a fundamental building block of the economic way of thinking.\nHowever, what happens when a voluntary exchange affects a third party who is neither the buyer nor the\nseller?\nAs an example, consider a concert producer who wants to build an outdoor arena that will host country music\nconcerts a half-mile from your neighborhood. You will be able to hear these outdoor concerts while sitting on\nyour back porch\u2014or perhaps even in your dining room. In this case, the sellers and buyers of concert tickets\nmay both be quite satisfied with their voluntary exchange, but you have no voice in their market transaction.\nThe effect of a market exchange on a third party who is outside or \u201cexternal\u201d to the exchange is called an\nexternality. Because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those\ninvolved, they are sometimes calledspillovers.\nExternalities can be negative or positive. If you hate country music, then having it waft into your house every\nnight would be anegative externality. If you love country music, then what amounts to a series of free\nconcerts would be apositive externality.\nPollution as a Negative Externality\nPollution is a negative externality. Economists illustrate thesocial costsof production with a demand and\nsupply diagram. The social costs include the private costs of production that a company incurs and the\nexternal costs of pollution that pass on to society.Figure 12.2shows the demand and supply for manufacturing\nrefrigerators. The demand curve (D) shows the quantity demanded at each price. The supply curve (S )\nprivate\nshows the quantity of refrigerators that all firms in the industry supply at each price assuming they are taking\nonly their private costs into account and they are allowed to emit pollution at zero cost. The market\nequilibrium (E ), where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded, is at a price of $650 per refrigerator and\n0\na quantity of 45,000 refrigerators.Table 12.2reflects this information in the first three columns. 284 12 \u2022 Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities\nFIGURE12.2Taking Social Costs into Account: A Supply ShiftIf the firm takes only its own costs of production into\naccount, then its supply curve will be S , and the market equilibrium will occur at E . Accounting for additional\nprivate 0\nexternal costs of $100 for every unit produced, the firm\u2019s supply curve will be S . The new equilibrium will occur\nsocial\nat E .\n1\nQuantity Quantity Supplied before Considering Quantity Supplied after Considering\nPrice\nDemanded Pollution Cost Pollution Cost\n$600 50,000 40,000 30,000\n$650 45,000 45,000 35,000\n$700 40,000 50,000 40,000\n$750 35,000 55,000 45,000\n$800 30,000 60,000 50,000\n$850 25,000 65,000 55,000\n$900 20,000 70,000 60,000\nTABLE12.2A Supply Shift Caused by Pollution Costs\nHowever, as a by-product of the metals, plastics, chemicals and energy that refrigerator manufacturers use,\nsome pollution is created. Let\u2019s say that, if these pollutants were emitted into the air and water, they would\ncreate costs of $100 per refrigerator produced. These costs might occur because of adverse effects on human\nhealth, property values, or wildlife habitat, reduction of recreation possibilities, or because of other negative\nimpacts. In a market with no anti-pollution restrictions, firms can dispose of certain wastes absolutely free.\nNow imagine that firms which produce refrigerators must factor in theseexternal costsof pollution\u2014that is,\nthe firms have to consider not only labor and material costs, but also the broader costs to society of harm to\nhealth and other costs caused by pollution. If the firm is required to pay $100 for theadditional external costs\nof pollution each time it produces a refrigerator, production becomes more costly and the entire supply curve\nshifts up by $100.\nAsTable 12.2andFigure 12.2illustrate, the firm will need to receive a price of $700 per refrigerator and\nproduce a quantity of 40,000\u2014and the firm\u2019s new supply curve will be S . The new equilibrium will occur at\nsocial\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.1 \u2022 The Economics of Pollution 285\nE . In short, taking the additional external costs of pollution into account results in a higher price, a lower\n1\nquantity of production, and a lower quantity of pollution. The following Work It Out feature will walk you\nthrough an example, this time with musical accompaniment.\nWORK IT OUT\nIdentifying the Equilibrium Price and Quantity\nTable 12.3shows the supply and demand conditions for a firm that will play trumpets on the streets when\nrequested. We measure output as the number of songs played.\nQuantity Quantity Supplied without paying the Quantity Supplied after paying the\nPrice\nDemanded costs of the externality costs of the externality\n$20 0 10 8\n$18 1 9 7\n$15 2.5 7.5 5.5\n$12 4 6 4\n$10 5 5 3\n$5 7.5 2.5 0.5\nTABLE12.3Supply and Demand Conditions for a Trumpet-Playing Firm\nStep 1. Determine the negative externality in this situation. To do this, you must think about the situation and\nconsider all parties that might be impacted. A negative externality might be the increase in noise pollution in the\narea where the firm is playing.\nStep 2. Identify the initial equilibrium price and quantity only taking private costs into account. Next, identify the\nnew equilibrium taking into account social costs as well as private costs. Remember that equilibrium is where the\nquantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied.\nStep 3. Look down the columns to where the quantity demanded (the second column) is equal to the \u201cquantity\nsupplied without paying the costs of the externality\u201d (the third column). Then refer to the first column of that row\nto determine the equilibrium price. In this case, the equilibrium price and quantity would be at a price of $10 and\na quantity of five when we only take into account private costs.\nStep 4. Identify the equilibrium price and quantity when we take into account the additional external costs. Look\ndown the columns of quantity demanded (the second column) and the \u201cquantity supplied after paying the costs\nof the externality\u201d (the fourth column) then refer to the first column of that row to determine the equilibrium\nprice. In this case, the equilibrium will be at a price of $12 and a quantity of four.\nStep 5. Consider how taking into account the externality affects the equilibrium price and quantity. Do this by\ncomparing the two equilibrium situations. If the firm is forced to pay its additional external costs, then\nproduction of trumpet songs becomes more costly, and the supply curve will shift up.\nRemember that the supply curve is based on choices about production that firms make while looking at their\nmarginal costs, while the demand curve is based on the benefits that individuals perceive while maximizing\nutility. If no externalities existed, private costs would be the same as the costs to society as a whole, and private\nbenefits would be the same as the benefits to society as a whole. Thus, if no externalities existed, the 286 12 \u2022 Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities\ninteraction of demand and supply will coordinate social costs and benefits.\nHowever, when the externality of pollution exists, the supply curve no longer represents all social costs.\nBecause externalities represent a case where markets no longer consider all social costs, but only some of\nthem, economists commonly refer to externalities as an example ofmarket failure. When there is market\nfailure, the private market fails to achieve efficient output, because either firms do not account for all costs\nincurred in the production of output and/or consumers do not account for all benefits obtained (a positive\nexternality). In the case of pollution, at the market output, social costs of production exceed social benefits to\nconsumers, and the market produces too much of the product.\nWe can see a general lesson here. If firms were required to pay the social costs of pollution, they would create\nless pollution but produce less of the product and charge a higher price. In the next module, we will explore\nhow governments require firms to account for the social costs of pollution.\n12.2Command-and-Control Regulation\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain command-and-control regulation\n\u2022 Evaluate the effectiveness of command-and-control regulation\nWhen the United States started passing comprehensive environmental laws in the late 1960s and early 1970s,\na typical law specified to companies how much pollution their smokestacks or drainpipes could emit and\nimposed penalties if companies exceeded the limit. Other laws required that companies install certain\nequipment\u2014for example, on automobile tailpipes or on smokestacks\u2014to reduce pollution. These types of laws,\nwhich specify allowable quantities of pollution and which also may detail which pollution-control technologies\ncompanies must use, fall under the category ofcommand-and-control regulation. In effect, command-and-\ncontrol regulation requires that firms increase their costs by installing anti-pollution equipment. Thus, firms\nare required to account for the social costs of pollution in deciding how much output to produce.\nCommand-and-control regulation has been highly successful in protecting and cleaning up the U.S.\nenvironment. In 1970, the Federal government created the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to oversee\nall environmental laws. In the same year, Congress enacted theClean Air Actto address air pollution. Just two\nyears later, in 1972, Congress passed and the president signed the far-reachingClean Water Act. These\ncommand-and-control environmental laws, and their amendments and updates, have been largely responsible\nfor America\u2019s cleaner air and water in recent decades. However, economists have pointed out three difficulties\nwith command-and-control environmental regulation.\nFirst, command-and-control regulation offers no incentive to improve the quality of the environment beyond\nthe standard set by a particular law. Once firms meet the standard, polluters have zero incentive to do better.\nSecond, command-and-control regulation is inflexible. It usually requires the same standard for all polluters,\nand often the same pollution-control technology as well. This means that command-and-control regulation\ndraws no distinctions between firms that would find it easy and inexpensive to meet the pollution standard\u2014or\nto reduce pollution even further\u2014and firms that might find it difficult and costly to meet the standard. Firms\nhave no reason to rethink their production methods in fundamental ways that might reduce pollution even\nmore and at lower cost.\nThird, legislators and EPA analysts write the command-and-control regulations, and so they are subject to\ncompromises in the political process. Existing firms often argue (and lobby) that stricter environmental\nstandards should not apply to them, only to new firms that wish to start production. Consequently, real-world\nenvironmental laws are full of fine print, loopholes, and exceptions.\nAlthough critics accept the goal of reducing pollution, they question whether command-and-control regulation\nis the best way to design policy tools for accomplishing that goal. A different approach is the use of market-\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.3 \u2022 Market-Oriented Environmental Tools 287\noriented tools, which we discussed in the next section.\n12.3Market-Oriented Environmental Tools\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Show how pollution charges impact firm decisions\n\u2022 Suggest other laws and regulations that could fall under pollution charges\n\u2022 Explain the significance of marketable permits and property rights\n\u2022 Evaluate which policies are most appropriate for various situations\nMarket-oriented environmental policies create incentives to allow firms some flexibility in reducing pollution.\nThe three main categories of market-oriented approaches to pollution control are pollution charges,\nmarketable permits, and better-defined property rights. All of these policy tools which we discuss, below,\naddress the shortcomings of command-and-control regulation\u2014albeit in different ways.\nPollution Charges\nApollution chargeis a tax imposed on the quantity of pollution that a firm emits. A pollution charge gives a\nprofit-maximizing firm an incentive to determine ways to reduce its emissions\u2014as long as the marginal cost of\nreducing the emissions is less than the tax.\nFor example, consider a small firm that emits 50 pounds per year of small particles, such as soot, into the air.\nThis particulate matter causes respiratory illnesses and also imposes costs on firms and individuals.\nFigure 12.3illustrates the marginal costs that a firm faces in reducing pollution. The marginal cost of pollution\nreduction, like mostmarginal cost curves, increases with output, at least in the short run. Reducing the first 10\npounds of particulate emissions costs the firm $300. Reducing the second 10 pounds would cost $500;\nreducing the third ten pounds would cost $900; reducing the fourth 10 pounds would cost $1,500; and the fifth\n10 pounds would cost $2,500. This pattern for the costs of reducing pollution is common, because the firm can\nuse the cheapest and easiest method to make initial reductions in pollution, but additional reductions in\npollution become more expensive.\nFIGURE12.3A Pollution ChargeIf a pollution charge is set equal to $1,000, then the firm will have an incentive to\nreduce pollution by 30 pounds because the $900 cost of these reductions would be less than the cost of paying the\npollution charge.\nImagine the firm now faces a pollution tax of $1,000 for every 10 pounds of particulates it emits. The firm has 288 12 \u2022 Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities\nthe choice of either polluting and paying the tax, or reducing the amount of particulates it emits and paying the\ncost of abatement as the figure shows. How much will the firm pollute and how much will the firm abate? The\nfirst 10 pounds would cost the firm $300 to abate. This is substantially less than the $1,000 tax, so the firm will\nchoose to abate. The second 10 pounds would cost $500 to abate, which is still less than the tax, so it will\nchoose to abate. The third 10 pounds would cost $900 to abate, which is slightly less than the $1,000 tax. The\nfourth 10 pounds would cost $1,500, which is much more costly than paying the tax. As a result, the firm will\ndecide to reduce pollutants by 30 pounds, because the marginal cost of reducing pollution by this amount is\nless than the pollution tax. With a tax of $1,000, the firm has no incentive to reduce pollution more than 30\npounds.\nA firm that has to pay a pollution tax will have an incentive to figure out the least expensive technologies for\nreducing pollution. Firms that can reduce pollution cheaply and easily will do so to minimize their pollution\ntaxes; whereas firms that will incur high costs for reducing pollution will end up paying the pollution tax\ninstead. If the pollution tax applies to every source of pollution, then there are no special favoritism or\nloopholes for politically well-connected producers.\nFor an example of a pollution charge at the household level, consider two ways of charging for garbage\ncollection. One method is to have a flat fee per household, no matter how much garbage a household produces.\nAn alternative approach is to have several levels of fees, depending on how much garbage the household\nproduces\u2014and to offer lower or free charges for recyclable materials. As of 2006 (latest statistics available), the\nEPA had recorded over 7,000 communities that have implemented \u201cpay as you throw\u201d programs. When people\nhave a financial incentive to put out less garbage and to increase recycling, they find ways to make it happen.\nA number of environmental policies are really pollution charges, although they often do not travel under that\nname. For example, the federal government and many state governments impose taxes on gasoline. We can\nview this tax as a charge on the air pollution that cars generate as well as a source of funding for maintaining\nroads. Gasoline taxes are far higher in most other countries than in the United States.\nSimilarly, the refundable charge of five or 10 cents that only 10 states have for returning recyclable cans and\nbottles works like a pollution tax that provides an incentive to avoid littering or throwing bottles in the trash.\nCompared with command-and-control regulation, a pollution tax reduces pollution in a more flexible and cost-\neffective way.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/bottlebill)to see the current U.S. states with bottle bills and the states\nthat have active campaigns for new bottle bills. You can also view current and proposed bills in Canada and\nother countries around the world.\nMarketable Permits\nWhen a city or state government sets up amarketable permit program(e.g., cap-and-trade), it must start by\ndetermining the overall quantity of pollution it will allow as it tries to meet national pollution standards. Then,\nit divides a number of permits allowing only this quantity of pollution among the firms that emit that pollutant.\nThe government can sell or provide these permits to pollute free to firms.\nNow, add two more conditions. Imagine that these permits are designed to reduce total emissions over time.\nFor example, a permit may allow emission of 10 units of pollution one year, but only nine units the next year,\nthen eight units the year after that, and so on down to some lower level. In addition, imagine that these are\nmarketable permits, meaning that firms can buy and sell them.\nTo see how marketable permits can work to reduce pollution, consider the four firms inTable 12.4. The table\nshows current emissions of lead from each firm. At the start of the marketable permit program, each firm\nreceives permits to allow this level of pollution. However, these permits are shrinkable, and next year the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.3 \u2022 Market-Oriented Environmental Tools 289\npermits allow the firms to emit only half as much pollution. Let\u2019s say that in a year, Firm Gamma finds it easy\nand cheap to reduce emissions from 600 tons of lead to 200 tons, which means that it has permits that it is not\nusing that allow emitting 100 tons of lead. Firm Beta reduces its lead pollution from 400 tons to 200 tons, so it\ndoes not need to buy any permits, and it does not have any extra permits to sell. However, although Firm Alpha\ncan easily reduce pollution from 200 tons to 150 tons, it finds that it is cheaper to purchase permits from\nGamma rather than to reduce its own emissions to 100. Meanwhile, Firm Delta did not even exist in the first\nperiod, so the only way it can start production is to purchase permits to emit 50 tons of lead.\nThe total quantity of pollution will decline. However, buying and selling the marketable permits will determine\nexactly which firms reduce pollution and by how much. With a system of marketable permits, the firms that\nfind it least expensive to do so will reduce pollution the most.\nFirm Alpha Firm Beta Firm Gamma Firm Delta\nCurrent emissions\u2014permits distributed\n200 tons 400 tons 600 tons 0 tons\nfree for this amount\nHow much pollution will these permits\n100 tons 200 tons 300 tons 0 tons\nallow in one year?\nActual emissions one year in the future 150 tons 200 tons 200 tons 50 tons\nBuys permits Doesn\u2019t buy or Sells permits for Buys permits\nBuyer or seller of marketable permit?\nfor 50 tons sell permits 100 tons for 50 tons\nTABLE12.4How Marketable Permits Work\nAnother application of marketable permits occurred when the U.S. government amended theClean Air Actin\n1990. The revised law sought to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power plants to half of the 1980\nlevels out of concern that sulfur dioxide was causing acid rain, which harms forests as well as buildings. In this\ncase, the marketable permits the federal government issued were free of charge (no pun intended) to\nelectricity-generating plants across the country, especially those that were burning coal (which produces\nsulfur dioxide). These permits were of the \u201cshrinkable\u201d type; that is, the amount of pollution allowed by a given\npermit declined with time.\nBetter-Defined Property Rights\nA clarified and strengthened idea of property rights can also strike a balance between economic activity and\npollution. Ronald Coase (1910\u20132013), who won the 1991 Nobel Prize in economics, offered a vivid illustration\nof an externality: a railroad track running beside a farmer\u2019s field where the railroad locomotive sometimes\nemits sparks and sets the field ablaze. Coase asked whose responsibility it was to address this spillover. Should\nthe farmer be required to build a tall fence alongside the field to block the sparks, or should the railroad be\nrequired to place a gadget on the locomotive\u2019s smokestack to reduce the number of sparks?\nCoase pointed out that one cannot resolve this issue until one clearly definesproperty rights\u2014that is, the legal\nrights of ownership on which others are not allowed to infringe without paying compensation. Does the farmer\nhave a property right not to have a field burned? Does the railroad have a property right to run its own trains\non its own tracks? If neither party has a property right, then the two sides may squabble endlessly, doing\nnothing, and sparks will continue to set the field aflame. However, if either the farmer or the railroad has a\nwell-defined legal responsibility, then that party will seek out and pay for the least costly method of reducing\nthe risk that sparks will hit the field. The property right determines whether the farmer or the railroad pays the\nbills. 290 12 \u2022 Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities\nThe property rights approach is highly relevant in cases involving endangered species. The U.S. government\u2019s\nendangered species list includes about 1,000 plants and animals, and about 90% of these species live on\nprivately owned land. The protection of these endangered species requires careful thinking about incentives\nand property rights. The discovery of an endangered species on private land has often triggered an automatic\nreaction from the government to prohibit the landowner from using that land for any purpose that might\ndisturb the imperiled creatures. Consider the incentives of that policy: If you admit to the government that you\nhave an endangered species, the government effectively prohibits you from using your land. As a result,\nrumors abounded of landowners who followed a policy of \u201cshoot, shovel, and shut up\u201d when they found an\nendangered animal on their land. Other landowners have deliberately cut trees or managed land in a way that\nthey knew would discourage endangered animals from locating there.\nCLEAR IT UP\nHow effective are market-oriented environmental policy tools?\nEnvironmentalists sometimes fear that market-oriented environmental tools are an excuse to weaken or eliminate\nstrict limits on pollution emissions and instead to allow more pollution. It is true that if pollution charges are set very\nlow or if marketable permits do not reduce pollution by very much then market-oriented tools will not work well.\nHowever, command-and-control environmental laws can also be full of loopholes or have exemptions that do not\nreduce pollution by much, either. The advantage of market-oriented environmental tools is not that they reduce\npollution by more or less, but because of their incentives and flexibility, they can achieve any desired reduction in\npollution at a lower cost to society.\nA more productive policy would consider how to provide private landowners with an incentive to protect the\nendangered species that they find and to provide a habitat for additional endangered species. For example, the\ngovernment might pay landowners who provide and maintain suitable habitats for endangered species or who\nrestrict the use of their land to protect an endangered species. Again, an environmental law built on incentives\nand flexibility offers greater promise than a command-and-control approach when trying to oversee millions\nof acres of privately owned land.\nApplying Market-Oriented Environmental Tools\nMarket-oriented environmental policies are a tool kit. Specific policy tools will work better in some situations\nthan in others. For example, marketable permits work best when a few dozen or a few hundred parties are\nhighly interested in trading, as in the cases of oil refineries that trade lead permits or electrical utilities that\ntrade sulfur dioxide permits. However, for cases in which millions of users emit small amounts of\npollution\u2014such as emissions from car engines or unrecycled soda cans\u2014and have no strong interest in\ntrading, pollution charges will typically offer a better choice. We can also combine market-oriented\nenvironmental tools. We can view marketable permits as a form of improved property rights. Alternatively, the\ngovernment could combine marketable permits with a pollution tax on any emissions not covered by a permit.\n12.4The Benefits and Costs of U.S. Environmental Laws\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Evaluate the benefits and costs of environmental protection\n\u2022 Explain the effects of ecotourism\n\u2022 Apply marginal analysis to illustrate the marginal costs and marginal benefits of reducing pollution\nGovernment economists have estimated that U.S. firms may pay more than $200 billion per year to comply\nwith federal environmental laws. That is a sizable amount of money. Is the money well spent?\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.4 \u2022 The Benefits and Costs of U.S. Environmental Laws 291\nBenefits and Costs of Clean Air and Clean Water\nWe can divide the benefits of a cleaner environment into four areas: (1) people may stay healthier and live\nlonger; (2) certain industries that rely on clean air and water, such as farming, fishing, and tourism, may\nbenefit; (3) property values may be higher; and (4) people may simply enjoy a cleaner environment in a way\nthat does not need to involve a market transaction. Some of these benefits, such as gains to tourism or farming,\nare relatively easy to value in economic terms. It is harder to assign a monetary value to others, such as the\nvalue of clean air for someone with asthma. It seems difficult to put a clear-cut monetary value on still others,\nsuch as the satisfaction you might feel from knowing that the air is clear over the Grand Canyon, even if you\nhave never visited the Grand Canyon, but advanced techniques in economics allow one to generate estimates.\nAlthough estimates of environmental benefits are not precise, they can still be revealing. For example, a study\nby the Environmental Protection Agency looked at the costs and benefits of the Clean Air Act from 1970 to\n1990. It found that total costs over that time period were roughly $500 billion\u2014a huge amount. However, it also\nfound that a middle-range estimate of the health and other benefits from cleaner air was $22 trillion\u2014about 44\ntimes higher than the costs. A more recent EPA study estimated that the environmental benefits to Americans\nfrom theClean Air Actwill exceed their costs by a margin of four to one. The EPA estimated that \u201cin 2010 the\nbenefits of Clean Air Act programs will total about $110 billion. This estimate represents the value of avoiding\nincreases in illness and premature death which would have prevailed.\u201d Saying that overall benefits of\nenvironmental regulation have exceeded costs in the past, however, is very different from saying that every\nenvironmental regulation makes sense. For example, studies suggest that when breaking down emission\nreductions by type of contaminants, the benefits of air pollution control outweigh the costs primarily for\nparticulates and lead, but when looking at other air pollutants, the costs of reducing them may be comparable\nto or greater than the benefits. Just because some environmental regulations have had benefits much higher\nthan costs does not prove that every individual regulation is a sensible idea.\nEcotourism: Making Environmentalism Pay\nThe definition ofecotourismis a little vague. Does it mean sleeping on the ground, eating roots, and getting\nclose to wild animals? Does it mean flying in a helicopter to shoot anesthetic darts at African wildlife, or a little\nof both? The definition may be fuzzy, but tourists who hope to appreciate the ecology of their destination\u2014\u201ceco\ntourists\u201d\u2014are the impetus to a big and growing business. The International Ecotourism Society estimates that\ninternational tourists interested in seeing nature or wildlife would take 1.56 billion trips by 2020. While\nCOVID-19 prevented this from happening in 2020, it is clear that there is a strong demand for ecotourism.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit The International Ecotourism Society\u2019swebsite(http://openstax.org/l/ecotourism)to learn more about\nThe International Ecotourism Society, its programs, and tourism\u2019s role in sustainable community\ndevelopment.\nRealizing the attraction of ecotourism, the residents of low-income countries may come to see that preserving\nwildlife habitats is more lucrative than, say, cutting down forests or grazing livestock. In South Africa, Namibia,\nand Zimbabwe, for example, ecotourism has given local communities an economic interest in protecting\nelephant and rhinoceros populations. Some of the leading ecotourism destinations include Costa Rica and\nPanama in Central America; the Caribbean; Malaysia, and other South Pacific destinations; New Zealand; the\nSerengeti in Tanzania; the Amazon rain forests; and the Galapagos Islands. In many of these countries and\nregions, governments have enacted policies whereby they share revenues from ecotourism with local\ncommunities, to give people in those local communities a kind of property right that encourages them to\nconserve their local environment.\nEcotourism needs careful management, so that the combination of eager tourists and local entrepreneurs does\nnot destroy what the visitors are coming to see. And recent research indicates that wild animals that are 292 12 \u2022 Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities\ncontinually exposed to tourists and vehicles exhibit stress and atypical behaviors. In general, however, well-\nmanaged ecotourism is viewed as a net positive, which provides an alternative to damaging the local\nenvironment.\nMarginal Benefits and Marginal Costs\nWe can use the tools of marginal analysis to illustrate the marginal costs and the marginal benefits of reducing\npollution.Figure 12.4illustrates a theoretical model of this situation. When the quantity of environmental\nprotection is low so that pollution is extensive\u2014for example, at quantity Qa\u2014there are usually numerous\nrelatively cheap and easy ways to reduce pollution, and themarginal benefitsof doing so are quite high. At Qa,\nit makes sense to allocate more resources to fight pollution. However, as the extent of environmental\nprotection increases, the cheap and easy ways of reducing pollution begin to decrease, and one must use more\ncostly methods. Themarginal cost curverises. Also, as environmental protection increases, one achieves the\nlargest marginal benefits first, followed by reduced marginal benefits. As the quantity of environmental\nprotection increases to, say, Qb, the gap between marginal benefits and marginal costs narrows. At point Qc the\nmarginal costs will exceed the marginal benefits. At this level of environmental protection, society is not\nallocating resources efficiently, because it is forfeiting too many resources to reduce pollution.\nFIGURE12.4Marginal Costs and Marginal Benefits of Environmental ProtectionReducing pollution is costly\u2014one\nmust sacrifice resources. The marginal costs of reducing pollution are generally increasing, because one can first\nmake the least expensive and easiest reductions, leaving the more expensive methods for later. The marginal\nbenefits of reducing pollution are generally declining, because one can take the steps that provide the greatest\nbenefit first, and steps that provide less benefit can wait until later.\nAs society draws closer to Qb, some might argue that it becomes more important to use market-oriented\nenvironmental tools to hold down the costs of reducing pollution. Their objective would be to avoid\nenvironmental rules that would provide the quantity of environmental protection at Qc, where marginal costs\nexceed marginal benefits. The following Clear It Up feature delves into how the EPA measures its policies \u2013 and\nthe monetary value of our lives.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat's a life worth?\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must estimate the value of saving lives by reducing pollution\nagainst the additional costs. In measuring the benefits of government environmental policies, the EPA\u2019s National\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.5 \u2022 International Environmental Issues 293\nCenter for Environmental Economics (NCEE) values a statistical human life at $7.4 million (in 2006 U.S. dollars,\nwhich corresponds to a little more than $10.5 million in February 2022.)\nEconomists value a human life on the basis of studies of the value that people actually place on human lives in their\nown decisions. For example, some jobs have a higher probability of death than others, and these jobs typically pay\nmore to compensate for the risk. Examples are ocean fishery as opposed to fish farming, and ice trucking in Alaska\nas opposed to truck driving in the \u201clower forty-eight\u201d states.\nGovernment regulators use estimates such as these when deciding what proposed regulations are \u201creasonable,\u201d\nwhich means deciding which proposals have high enough benefits to justify their cost. For example, when the U.S.\nDepartment of Transportation makes decisions about what safety systems should be required in cars or airplanes, it\nwill approve rules only where the estimated cost per life saved is $3 million or less.\nResources that we spend on life-saving regulations create a tradeoff. A study by W. Kip Viscusi of Vanderbilt\nUniversity estimated that when a regulation costs $50 million, it diverts enough spending in the rest of the economy\nfrom health care and safety expenditures that it costs a life. This finding suggests that any regulation that costs\nmore than $50 million per life saved actually costs lives, rather than saving them.\nReferences\nRyan, Dave. \u201cNew Report Shows Benefits of 1990 Clean Air Amendments Outweigh Costs by Four-to-One\nMargin,\u201d press release, November 16, 1999.United States Environmental Protection Agency.Accessed\nDecember 19, 2013. http://www.epa.gov/oar/sect812/r-140.html.\nNational Center for Environmental Economics (NCEE). \u201cFrequently Asked Questions on Mortality Risk\nValuation.\u201dUnited States Environmental Protection Agency.Accessed December 19, 2013.\nhttp://yosemite.epa.gov/ee/epa/eed.nsf/pages/MortalityRiskValuation.html#whatvalue World Tourism\nOrganization, \u201cTourism 2020 Vision.\u201d Accessed December 19, 2013. http://www.world-tourism.org/\nmarket_research/facts/market_trends.htm.\nViscusi, Kip W.Fatal Tradeoffs: Public and Private Responsibilities for Risk.New York: Oxford University Press,\n1995.\n12.5International Environmental Issues\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain biodiversity\n\u2022 Analyze the partnership of high-income and low-income countries in efforts to address international\nexternalities\nMany countries around the world have become more aware of the benefits of environmental protection. Yet\neven if most nations individually took steps to address their environmental issues, no nation acting alone can\nsolve certain environmental problems which spill over national borders. No nation by itself can reduce\nemissions of carbon dioxide and other gases by enough to solve the problem of global warming\u2014not without\nthe cooperation of other nations. Another issue is the challenge of preservingbiodiversity, which includes the\nfull spectrum of animal and plant genetic material. Although a nation can protect biodiversity within its own\nborders, no nation acting alone can protect biodiversity around the world. Global warming and biodiversity are\nexamples ofinternational externalities.\nBringing the nations of the world together to address environmental issues requires a difficult set of\nnegotiations between countries with different income levels and different sets of priorities. If nations such as\nChina, India, Brazil, Mexico, and others are developing their economies by burning vast amounts of fossil fuels\nor by stripping their forest and wildlife habitats, then the world\u2019s high-income countries acting alone will not 294 12 \u2022 Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities\nbe able to reduce greenhouse gases. However, low-income countries, with some understandable exasperation,\npoint out that high-income countries do not have much moral standing to lecture them on the necessities of\nputting environmental protection ahead of economic growth. After all, high-income countries have historically\nbeen the primary contributors to greenhouse warming by burningfossil fuels\u2014and still are today. It is hard to\ntell people who are living in a low-income country, where adequate diet, health care, and education are\nlacking, that they should sacrifice an improved quality of life for a cleaner environment.\nCan rich and poor countries come together to address global environmental spillovers? At the initiative of the\nEuropean Union and the most vulnerable developing nations, the Durban climate conference in December\n2011 launched negotiations to develop a new international climate change agreement that covers all countries.\nThe outcome of these negotiations was the Paris Climate Agreement, passed in 2015. The Paris Agreement\ncommitted participating countries to significant limits on CO emissions. To date, 196 entities have signed on,\n2\nincluding the two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases\u2014China and the United States. The U.S. contribution to\nthe agreement was the Clean Power Plan, which planned to reduce power plant CO emissions across the U.S.\n2\nby 17% to pre-2005 levels by 2020, and to further reduce emissions by a cumulative 32% by 2030. In early\n2017, the Trump Administration announced plans to back out of the Paris Climate Agreement. Trump opposed\nthe Clean Power plan, opting instead to shift focus to the use of natural gas. This represented a significant blow\nto the success of the Paris Agreement. However, on his first day in office, President Biden, on behalf of the\nUnited States, rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/EC)to learn more about the European Commission.\nIf high-income countries want low-income countries to reduce their emission of greenhouse gases, then the\nhigh-income countries may need to pay some of the costs. Perhaps some of these payments will happen\nthrough private markets. For example, some tourists from rich countries will pay handsomely to vacation near\nthe natural treasures of low-income countries. Perhaps some of the transfer of resources can happen through\nmaking modern pollution-control technology available to poorer countries.\nThe practical details of what such an international system might look like and how it would operate across\ninternational borders are forbiddingly complex. However, it seems highly unlikely that some form of world\ngovernment will impose a detailed system of environmental command-and-control regulation around the\nworld. As a result, a decentralized and market-oriented approach may be the only practical way to address\ninternational issues such as global warming and biodiversity.\n12.6The Tradeoff between Economic Output and Environmental Protection\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Apply the production possibility frontier to evaluate the tradeoff between economic output and the\nenvironment\n\u2022 Interpret a graphic representation of the tradeoff between economic output and environmental protection\nWe can analyze the tradeoff between economic output and the environment with aproduction possibility\nfrontier (PPF)such as the one inFigure 12.5. At one extreme, at a choice like P, a country would be selecting a\nhigh level of economic output but very little environmental protection. At the other extreme, at a choice like T,\na country would be selecting a high level of environmental protection but little economic output. According to\nthe graph, an increase in environmental protection involves an opportunity cost of less economic output. No\nmatter what their preferences, all societies should wish to avoid choices like M, which are productively\ninefficient. Efficiency requires that the choice should be on the production possibility frontier.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.6 \u2022 The Tradeoff between Economic Output and Environmental Protection 295\nFIGURE12.5The Tradeoff between Economic Output and Environmental ProtectionEach society will have to weigh\nits own values and decide whether it prefers a choice like P with more economic output and less environmental\nprotection, or a choice like T with more environmental protection and less economic output.\nEconomists do not have a great deal to say about the choice between P, Q, R, S and T inFigure 12.5, all of which\nlie along the production possibility frontier. Countries with low per capitagross domestic product (GDP), such\nas India, place a greater emphasis on economic output\u2014which in turn helps to produce nutrition, shelter,\nhealth, education, and desirable consumer goods. Countries with higher income levels, where a greater share\nof people have access to the basic necessities of life, may be willing to place a relatively greater emphasis on\nenvironmental protection.\nHowever, economists are united in their belief that an inefficient choice such as M is undesirable. Rather than\nchoosing M, a nation could achieve either greater economic output with the same environmental protection, as\nat point Q, or greater environmental protection with the same level of output, as at point S. The problem with\ncommand-and-control environmental laws is that they sometimes involve a choice like M. Market-oriented\nenvironmental tools offer a mechanism for providing either the same environmental protection at lower cost,\nor providing a greater degree of environmental protection for the same cost.\nBRING IT HOME\nKeystone XL\nHow would an economist respond to claims of environmental damage caused by the Keystone XL project? Clearly,\nwe can consider the environmental cost of oil spills a negative externality, but how large would these external costs\nbe? Furthermore, are these costs \u201ctoo high\u201d when we measure them against any potential for economic benefit?\nAs this chapter indicates, in deciding whether pipeline construction is a good idea, an economist would want to\nknow not only about the marginal benefits resulting from the additional pipeline construction, but also the potential\nmarginal costs\u2014and especially the pipeline's marginal external costs. Typically these come in the form of\nenvironmental impact statements, which are usually required for such projects. For example, an impact statement,\nreleased in March 2013 by the Nebraska Department of State, considered the possibility of fewer pipeline miles\ngoing over the aquifer system and avoiding completely environmentally fragile areas. It indicated that pipeline\nconstruction would not harm \"most resources\".\nAs noted at the outset of this chapter, the Obama Administration declined to approve construction of the Keystone\nXL project. However, the Trump administration announced its willingness to do so, but as noted earlier, the Biden\nadministration effectively ended the project. While we may fairly easily quantify the economic benefits of additional 296 12 \u2022 Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities\noil in the United States, the social costs are more challenging to measure. Consequently, different observers may\nreach different conclusions about the balance between estimates of economic benefits and estimates of the social\ncosts of the pipeline project.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12 \u2022 Key Terms 297\nKey Terms\nadditional external cost additional costs incurred by third parties outside the production process when a unit\nof output is produced\nbiodiversitythe full spectrum of animal and plant genetic material\ncommand-and-control regulationlaws that specify allowable quantities of pollution and that also may detail\nwhich pollution-control technologies one must use\nexternality a market exchange that affects a third party who is outside or \u201cexternal\u201d to the exchange;\nsometimes called a \u201cspillover\u201d\ninternational externalitiesexternalities that cross national borders and that a single nation acting alone\ncannot resolve\nmarket failure When the market on its own does not allocate resources efficiently in a way that balances\nsocial costs and benefits; externalities are one example of a market failure\nmarketable permit program a permit that allows a firm to emit a certain amount of pollution; firms with\nmore permits than pollution can sell the remaining permits to other firms\nnegative externality a situation where a third party, outside the transaction, suffers from a market\ntransaction by others\npollution charge a tax imposed on the quantity of pollution that a firm emits; also called a pollution tax\npositive externality a situation where a third party, outside the transaction, benefits from a market\ntransaction by others\nproperty rights the legal rights of ownership on which others are not allowed to infringe without paying\ncompensation\nsocial costs costs that include both the private costs incurred by firms and also additional costs incurred by\nthird parties outside the production process, like costs of pollution\nspillover see externality\nKey Concepts and Summary\n12.1The Economics of Pollution\nEconomic production can cause environmental damage. This tradeoff arises for all countries, whether high-\nincome or low-income, and whether their economies are market-oriented or command-oriented.\nAn externality occurs when an exchange between a buyer and seller has an impact on a third party who is not\npart of the exchange. An externality, which is sometimes also called a spillover, can have a negative or a\npositive impact on the third party. If those parties imposing a negative externality on others had to account for\nthe broader social cost of their behavior, they would have an incentive to reduce the production of whatever is\ncausing the negative externality. In the case of a positive externality, the third party obtains benefits from the\nexchange between a buyer and a seller, but they are not paying for these benefits. If this is the case, then\nmarkets would tend to under produce output because suppliers are not aware of the additional demand from\nothers. If the parties generating benefits to others would somehow receive compensation for these external\nbenefits, they would have an incentive to increase production of whatever is causing the positive externality.\n12.2Command-and-Control Regulation\nCommand-and-control regulation sets specific limits for pollution emissions and/or specific pollution-control\ntechnologies that firms must use. Although such regulations have helped to protect the environment, they have\nthree shortcomings: they provide no incentive for going beyond the limits they set; they offer limited flexibility\non where and how to reduce pollution; and they often have politically-motivated loopholes.\n12.3Market-Oriented Environmental Tools\nExamples of market-oriented environmental policies, also called cap and trade programs, include pollution\ncharges, marketable permits, and better-defined property rights. Market-oriented environmental policies 298 12 \u2022 Self-Check Questions\ninclude taxes, markets, and property rights so that those who impose negative externalities must face the\nsocial cost.\n12.4The Benefits and Costs of U.S. Environmental Laws\nWe can make a strong case, taken as a whole, that the benefits of U.S. environmental regulation have\noutweighed the costs. As the extent of environment regulation increases, additional expenditures on\nenvironmental protection will probably have increasing marginal costs and decreasing marginal benefits. This\npattern suggests that the flexibility and cost savings of market-oriented environmental policies will become\nmore important.\n12.5International Environmental Issues\nCertain global environmental issues, such as global warming and biodiversity, spill over national borders and\nrequire addressing with some form of international agreement.\n12.6The Tradeoff between Economic Output and Environmental Protection\nDepending on their different income levels and political preferences, countries are likely to make different\nchoices aboutallocative efficiency\u2014that is, the choice between economic output and environmental protection\nalong the production possibility frontier. However, all countries should prefer to make a choice that shows\nproductive efficiency\u2014that is, the choice is somewhere on the production possibility frontier rather than inside\nit.

The research and development efforts of citizens,\nscientists, firms, universities, and governments have truly revolutionized the modern economy. To get a sense of\nhow far we have come in a short period of time, let\u2019s compare one of humankind\u2019s greatest achievements to the\nsmartphone. 308 13 \u2022 Positive Externalities and Public Goods\nIn 1977 the United States launched Voyager I, a spacecraft originally intended to reach Jupiter and Saturn, to send\nback photographs and other cosmic measurements. Voyager I, however, kept going, and going\u2014past Jupiter and\nSaturn\u2014right out of our solar system. At the time of its launch, Voyager had some of the most sophisticated\ncomputing processing power NASA could engineer (8,000 instructions per second), but today, we Earthlings use\nhandheld devices that can process 14 billion instructions per second.\nStill, the technology of today is a spillover product of the incredible feats NASA accomplished over forty years ago.\nNASA research, for instance, is responsible for the kidney dialysis and mammogram machines that we use today.\nResearch in new technologies not only produces private benefits to the investing firm, or in this case to NASA, but it\nalso creates benefits for the broader society. In this way, new knowledge often becomes what economists refer to\nas a public good. This leads us to the topic of this chapter\u2014technology, positive externalities, public goods, and the\nrole of government in encouraging innovation and the social benefits that it provides.\nAs economist Mariana Mazzucato explores in her well-known workThe Entrepreneurial State, what makes a\nsmartphone smart? What allows its apps to help you navigate new towns while getting updates about your\nhome, all while your hands are on the steering wheel and your children are in the back seat watching their\nshows? For starters, the internet, cell tower networks, GPS, and voice activation. Each of these, and many other\ntechnologies we rely on, were developed with intensive government support. For example, GPS, which enables\nmany cell phone functions beyond the frequently used mapping and ride-sharing applications, was developed\nby the U.S. Department of Defense over several generations of satellite tracking and complex computer\nalgorithm development. The U.S. government still provides GPS for many of the world\u2019s users.\nWe do not often think of the government when we consider our leading products and entrepreneurs. We think\nof Apple, Google, Lyft, Tesla, Fitbit, and so on\u2014creative innovators who built on the tools provided by these\ngovernment efforts, using them in transformative ways. We may not think of the estimated $19 billion per year\nthat the U.S. spends to maintain the GPS system, but we would certainly think of it if it suddenly went away.\n(Beyond the impact on our daily lives, economists estimate U.S. businesses alone would lose about $1 billion\nper day without GPS.)\nMazzucato is one of several prominent economists advocating for an embrace of continued government-\nsponsored innovations in order to build economic prosperity, reduce inequality, and manage ongoing\nchallenges such as drought, coastal changes, and extreme weather. She argues that competitive, private sector\nmarkets are often resistant to the risks involved with large-scale innovation, because failed experiments and\nlack of uptake lead to massive corporate and personal losses. Governments can take on riskier research and\ndevelopment projects. Because government spending is fueled by taxpayers, and all innovation leads to some\nlevel of employment change, these proposals are certainly complex and challenging to implement.\nThis chapter deals with some of these issues: Will private companies be willing to invest in new technology? In\nwhat ways does new technology have positive externalities? What motivates inventors? What role should\ngovernment play in encouraging research and technology? Are there certain types of goods that markets fail to\nprovide efficiently, and that only government can produce? What happens when consumption or production of\na product creates positive externalities? Why is it unsurprising when we overuse a common resource, like\nmarine fisheries?\n13.1Investments in Innovation\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Identify the positive externalities of new technology.\n\u2022 Explain the difference between private benefits and social benefits and give examples of each.\n\u2022 Calculate and analyze rates of return\nMarket competition can provide an incentive for discovering new technology because afirmcan earn higher\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13.1 \u2022 Investments in Innovation 309\nprofits by finding a way to produce products more cheaply or to create products with characteristics\nconsumers want. As Gregory Lee, CEO of Samsung said, \u201cRelentless pursuit of new innovation is the key\nprinciple of our business and enables consumers to discover a world of possibilities with technology.\u201d An\ninnovative firm knows that it will usually have a temporary edge over its competitors and thus an ability to\nearn above-normal profits before competitors can catch up.\nIn certain cases, however,competitioncan discourage newtechnology, especially when other firms can\nquickly copy a new idea. Consider a pharmaceutical firm deciding to develop a new drug. On average, it can\ncost $800 million and take more than a decade to discover a new drug, perform the necessary safety tests, and\nbring the drug to market. If the research and development (R&D) effort fails\u2014and every R&D project has some\nchance of failure\u2014then the firm will suffer losses and could even be driven out of business. If the project\nsucceeds, then the firm\u2019s competitors may figure out ways of adapting and copying the underlying idea, but\nwithout having to pay the costs themselves. As a result, the innovative company will bear the much higher\ncosts of the R&D and will enjoy at best only a small, temporary advantage over the competition.\nMany inventors over the years have discovered that their inventions brought them less profit than they might\nhave reasonably expected.\n\u2022 Eli Whitney (1765\u20131825) invented the cotton gin, but then southern cotton planters built their own seed-\nseparating devices with a few minor changes in Whitney\u2019s design. When Whitney sued, he found that the\ncourts in southern states would not uphold his patent rights.\n\u2022 Thomas Edison (1847\u20131931) still holds the record for most patents granted to an individual. His first\ninvention was an automatic vote counter, and despite the social benefits, he could not find a government\nthat wanted to buy it.\n\u2022 Gordon Gould came up with the idea behind the laser in 1957. He put off applying for a patent and, by the\ntime he did apply, other scientists had laser inventions of their own. A lengthy legal battle resulted, in\nwhich Gould spent $100,000 on lawyers, before he eventually received a patent for the laser in 1977.\nCompared to the enormous social benefits of the laser, Gould received relatively little financial reward.\n\u2022 In 1936, Alan Turing delivered a paper titled, \"On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the\nEntscheidungsproblem,\" in which he presented the notion of a universal machine (later called the\n\u201cUniversal Turing Machine,\" and then the \"Turing machine\") capable of computing anything that is\ncomputable. The central concept of the modern computer was based on Turing\u2019s paper. Today scholars\nwidely consider Turing as the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence; however,\nthe UK government prosecuted Turing in 1952 for engaging in same-sex sexual acts and gave him the\nchoice of chemical castration or prison. Turing chose castration and died in 1954 from cyanide poisoning.\nA variety of studies by economists have found that the original inventor receives one-third to one-half of the\ntotal economic benefits from innovations, while other businesses and new product users receive the rest.\nThe Positive Externalities of New Technology\nWill private firms in amarket economyunderinvest in research and technology? If a firm builds a factory or\nbuys a piece of equipment, the firm receives all the economic benefits that result from the investments.\nHowever, when a firm invests in new technology, theprivate benefits, or profits, that the firm receives are only\na portion of the overall social benefits. Thesocial benefitsof an innovation account for the value of all the\npositive externalities of the new idea or product, whether enjoyed by other companies or society as a whole, as\nwell as the private benefits the firm that developed the new technology receives. As you learned in\nEnvironmental Protection and Negative Externalities,positive externalitiesare beneficial spillovers to a third\nparty, or parties.\nConsider the example of the Big Drug Company, which is planning its R&D budget for the next year. Economists\nand scientists working for Big Drug have compiled a list of potential research and development projects and\nestimated rates of return. (The rate of return is the estimated payoff from the project.)Figure 13.2shows how 310 13 \u2022 Positive Externalities and Public Goods\nthe calculations work. The downward-sloping D curve represents the firm\u2019s demand for financial capital\nPrivate\nand reflects the company\u2019s willingness to borrow to finance research and development projects at various\ninterest rates. Suppose that this firm\u2019s investment in research and development creates a spillover benefit to\nother firms and households. After all, new innovations often spark other creative endeavors that society also\nvalues. If we add the spillover benefits society enjoys to the firm\u2019s private demand for financial capital, we can\ndraw D that lies above D .\nSocial Private\nIf there were a way for the firm to fully monopolize those social benefits by somehow making them unavailable\nto the rest of us, the firm\u2019s private demand curve would be the same as society\u2019s demand curve. According to\nFigure 13.2andTable 13.1, if the going rate of interest on borrowing is 8%, and the company can receive the\nprivate benefits of innovation only, then the company would finance $30 million. Society, at the same rate of\n8%, would find it optimal to have $52 million of borrowing. Unless there is a way for the company to fully enjoy\nthe total benefits, then it will borrow less than the socially optimal level of $52 million.\nFIGURE13.2Positive Externalities and TechnologyBig Drug faces a cost of borrowing of 8%. If the firm receives\nonly the private benefits of investing in R&D, then we show its demand curve for financial capital by D , and the\nPrivate\nequilibrium will occur at $30 million. Because there are spillover benefits, society would find it optimal to have $52\nmillion of investment. If the firm could keep the social benefits of its investment for itself, its demand curve for\nfinancial capital would be D and it would be willing to borrow $52 million.\nSocial\nRate of Return D (in millions) D (in millions)\nPrivate Social\n2% $72 $84\n4% $52 $72\n6% $38 $62\n8% $30 $52\n10% $26 $44\nTABLE13.1Return and Demand for Capital\nBig Drug\u2019s original demand for financial capital (D ) is based on the profits the firm receives. However,\nPrivate\nother pharmaceutical firms and health care companies may learn new lessons about how to treat certain\nmedical conditions and are then able to create their own competing products. The social benefit of the drug\ntakes into account the value of all the drug's positive externalities. If Big Drug were able to gain this social\nreturn instead of other companies, itsdemandfor financial capital would shift to the demand curve D , and\nSocial\nit would be willing to borrow and invest $52 million. However, if Big Drug is receiving only 50 cents of each\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13.1 \u2022 Investments in Innovation 311\ndollar of social benefits, the firm will not spend as much on creating new products. The amount it would be\nwilling to spend would fall somewhere in between D and D .\nPrivate Social\nWhy Invest in Human Capital?\nThe investment in anything, whether it is the construction of a new power plant or research in a new cancer\ntreatment, usually requires a certain upfront cost with an uncertain future benefit. The investment in\neducation, or human capital, is no different. Over the span of many years, a student and her family invest\nsignificant amounts of time and money into that student\u2019s education. The idea is that higher levels of\neducational attainment will eventually serve to increase the student\u2019s future productivity and subsequent\nability to earn. Once the student crunches the numbers, does this investment pay off for her?\nAlmost universally, economists have found that the answer to this question is a clear \u201cYes.\u201d For example,\nseveral studies of the return to education in the United States estimate that the rate of return to a college\neducation is approximately 10-15%. Data inTable 13.2, from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019Usual Weekly\nEarnings of Wage and Salary Workers, Fourth Quarter 2021,demonstrate that median weekly earnings are\nhigher for workers who have completed more education. While these rates of return will beat equivalent\ninvestments in Treasury bonds or savings accounts, the estimated returns to education go primarily to the\nindividual worker, so these returns areprivate rates of returnto education.\nLess than a High High School Degree, Bachelor's Degree\nSchool Degree No College or Higher\nMedian Weekly Earnings (full-time\n$651 $831 $1,467\nworkers over the age of 25)\nTABLE13.2Usual Weekly Earnings of Wage and Salary Workers, Fourth Quarter 2021(Source:\nhttps://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/wkyeng.pdf)\nWhat does society gain from investing in the education of another student? After all, if the government is\nspending taxpayer dollars to subsidize public education, society should expect some kind of return on that\nspending. Economists likeGeorge Psacharopouloshave found that, across a variety of nations, thesocial rate\nof returnon schooling is also positive. After all, positive externalities exist from investment in education.\nWhile not always easy to measure, according toWalter McMahon, the positive externalities to education\ntypically include better health outcomes for the population, lower levels of crime, a cleaner environment and a\nmore stable, democratic government. For these reasons, many nations have chosen to use taxpayer dollars to\nsubsidize primary, secondary, and higher education. Education clearly benefits the person who receives it, but\na society where most people have a good level of education provides positive externalities for all.\nOther Examples of Positive Externalities\nAlthough technology may be the most prominent example of a positive externality, it is not the only one. For\nexample, vaccinations against disease are not only a protection for the individual, but they have the positive\nspillover of protecting others who may become infected. When a number of homes in a neighborhood are\nmodernized, updated, and restored, not only does it increase the homes' value, but other property values in\nthe neighborhood may increase as well.\nThe appropriate public policy response to a positive externality, like a new technology, is to help the party\ncreating the positive externality receive a greater share of the social benefits. In the case of vaccines, like flu\nshots, an effective policy might be to provide a subsidy to those who choose to get vaccinated.\nFigure 13.3shows the market for flu shots. The market demand curve D for flu shots reflects only the\nMarket\nmarginal private benefits (MPB) that the vaccinated individuals receive from the shots. Assuming that there\nare no spillover costs in the production of flu shots, the market supply curve is given by the marginal private 312 13 \u2022 Positive Externalities and Public Goods\ncost (MPC) of producing the vaccinations.\nThe equilibrium quantity of flu shots produced in the market, where MPB is equal to MPC, is Q and the\nMarket\nprice of flu shots is P . However, spillover benefits exist in this market because others, those who chose not\nMarket\nto purchase a flu shot, receive a positive externality in the form of a reduced chance of contracting the flu.\nWhen we add the spillover benefits to the marginal private benefit of flu shots, the marginal social benefit\n(MSB) of flu shots is given by D . Because the MSB is greater than MPB, we see that the socially optimal level\nSocial\nof flu shots is greater than the market quantity (Q exceeds Q ) and the corresponding price of flu\nSocial Market\nshots, if the market were to produce Q , would be at P . Unfortunately, the marketplace does not\nSocial Social\nrecognize the positive externality and flu shots will go under-produced and under-consumed.\nHow can government try to move the market level of output closer to the socially desirable level of output? One\npolicy would be to provide a subsidy, like a voucher, to any citizen who wishes to get vaccinated. This voucher\nwould act as \u201cincome\u201d that one could use to purchase only a flu shot and, if the voucher were exactly equal to\nthe per-unit spillover benefits, would increase market equilibrium to a quantity of Q and a price of P\nSocial Social\nwhere MSB equals MSC (which equals MPC given the assumption that there are no spillover costs in producing\nthe vaccine). Suppliers of the flu shots would receive payment of P per vaccination, while consumers of flu\nSocial\nshots would redeem the voucher and only pay a price of P . When the government uses a subsidy in this\nSubsidy\nway, it produces the socially optimal quantity of vaccinations.\nFIGURE13.3The Market for Flu Shots with Spillover Benefits (A Positive Externality)The market demand curve\ndoes not reflect the positive externality of flu vaccinations, so only Q will be exchanged. This outcome is\nMarket\ninefficient because the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost. If the government provides a\nsubsidy to consumers of flu shots, equal to the marginal social benefit minus the marginal private benefit, the level\nof vaccinations can increase to the socially optimal quantity of Q .\nSocial\nSocietal Change as an Innovation Outcome\nEconomist Carlota Perez draws on the lessons of past innovations to understand the current state of our\neconomy. She demonstrates that prior technological turning points, such as the proliferation of railroads and\nthe emergence of mass production, created initial periods of employment and wealth shifting but eventually\nled to greater well-being and economic growth. After difficult transition periods and sometimes economic\nmeltdowns during the \u201cinstallment\u201d phase of widespread new technologies, many economies and the people\nwithin them have benefited from prolonged periods of economic and lifestyle improvement, including lower\nunemployment and better quality of life.\nMost prior innovation periods, such as the Industrial Revolution, had one significant downside: negative\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13.2 \u2022 How Governments Can Encourage Innovation 313\nimpacts on the environment, such as pollution and habitat destruction. Perez notes that our current\nrevolution\u2014in information and communications technology (ICT)\u2014has the potential for significant positive\nexternalities related to the environment. ICT is shifting many areas of society (and therefore industry) to\ndigital experiences and services that do not require fossil fuels or similar natural resources. Vehicle sharing,\nproduct rental-reuse networks, and new manufacturing methods offer the promise of far less consumable\nconsumption. And even though the appearance of delivery trucks and shipping boxes gives the impression of\nenvironmental damage, most studies indicate that online shopping is better for the environment than\nindividuals shopping in person. (This is partly attributed to greater efficiency in a few trucks driving to a\nneighborhood rather than everyone in the neighborhood driving to several stores.) Consumers and\ngovernments can spur on those environmental benefits by choosing or partnering with companies that focus\non furthering their environmental impact, such as by using solar power to fuel their computer servers or by\nusing electrically powered delivery trucks.\nLike other innovations, ICT has created some employment and economic opportunities while it has reduced\nothers. Increased globalization and efficiencies have shuttered businesses and reduced wages in some areas.\nPerez\u2019s research indicates that those types of employment shifts can be managed through proper regulation\nand investment (especially in human capital), particularly as firms in the relevant industries become mature\nand profitable. The prospects aren\u2019t simple: ICT has created megafirms like Amazon and Apple, which despite\npleasing their consumers can wield significant power over governments and employees. But on the\nenvironmental and societal front at least, ICT has offered a wealth of opportunities and externalities.\n13.2How Governments Can Encourage Innovation\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain the effects of intellectual property rights on social and private rates of return.\n\u2022 Identify three U.S. Government policies and explain how they encourage innovation\nA number of different government policies can increase the incentives to innovate, including: guaranteeing\nintellectual property rights, government assistance with the costs of research and development, and\ncooperative research ventures between universities and companies.\nIntellectual Property Rights\nOne way to increase new technology is to guarantee the innovator an exclusive right to that new product or\nprocess.Intellectual propertyrights include patents, which give the inventor the exclusive legal right to make,\nuse, or sell the invention for a limited time, and copyright laws, which give the author an exclusive legal right\nover works of literature, music, film/video, and pictures. For example, if a pharmaceutical firm has apatenton\na new drug, then no other firm can manufacture or sell that drug for 20 years, unless the firm with the patent\ngrants permission. Without a patent, the pharmaceutical firm would have to face competition for any\nsuccessful products, and could earn no more than a normal rate of profit. With a patent, a firm is able to earn\nmonopoly profits on its product for a period of time\u2014which offers an incentive for research and development.\nIn general, how long can \u201ca period of time\u201d be? The Clear It Up discusses patent and copyright protection\ntimeframes for some works you might know.\nCLEAR IT UP\nHow long is Mickey Mouse protected from being copied?\nAll patents and copyrights are scheduled to end someday. In 2003, copyright protection for Mickey Mouse was\nscheduled to run out. Once the copyright had expired, anyone would be able to copy Mickey Mouse cartoons or draw\nand sell new ones. In 1998, however, Congress passed the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act. For\ncopyrights owned by companies or other entities, it increased or extended the copyright from 75 years to 95 years 314 13 \u2022 Positive Externalities and Public Goods\nafter publication. For copyrights owned by individuals, it increased or extended the copyright coverage from 50\nyears to 70 years after death. Along with protecting Mickey for another 20 years, the copyright extension affected\nabout 400,000 books, movies, and songs.\nFigure 13.4illustrates how the total number of patent applications filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark\nOffice, as well as the total number of patents granted, surged in the mid-1990s with the invention of the\ninternet, and is still going strong today.\nFIGURE13.4Patents Filed and Granted, 1981\u20132012The number of applications filed for patents increased\nsubstantially beginning in the 1990s, due in part to the invention of the internet, which has led to many other\ninventions and to the 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act. (Source: http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/\ntaf/us_stat.htm)\nWhile patents provide an incentive to innovate by protecting the innovator, they are not perfect. For example:\n\u2022 In countries that already have patents, economic studies show that inventors receive only one-third to\none-half of the total economic value of their inventions.\n\u2022 In a fast-moving high-technology industry like biotechnology or semiconductor design, patents may be\nalmost irrelevant because technology is advancing so quickly.\n\u2022 Not every new idea can be protected with a patent or a copyright\u2014for example, a new way of organizing a\nfactory or a new way of training employees.\n\u2022 Patents may sometimes cover too much or be granted too easily. In the early 1970s, Xerox had received\nover 1,700 patents on various elements of the photocopy machine. Every time Xerox improved the\nphotocopier, it received a patent on the improvement.\n\u2022 The 20-year time period for a patent is somewhat arbitrary. Ideally, a patent should cover a long enough\nperiod of time for the inventor to earn a good return, but not so long that it allows the inventor to charge a\nmonopoly price permanently.\nBecause patents are imperfect and do not apply well to all situations, alternative methods of improving the rate\nof return for inventors of new technology are desirable. The following sections describe some of these possible\nalternative policies.\nPolicy #1: Government Spending on Research and Development\nIf the private sector does not have sufficient incentive to carry out research and development, one possibility is\nfor the government to fund such work directly. Government spending can provide direct financial support for\nresearch and development (R&D) conducted at colleges and universities, nonprofit research entities, and\nsometimes by private firms, as well as at government-run laboratories. While government spending on\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13.2 \u2022 How Governments Can Encourage Innovation 315\nresearch and development produces technology that is broadly available for firms to use, it costs taxpayers\nmoney and can sometimes be directed more for political than for scientific or economic reasons.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit the NASAwebsite(http://openstax.org/l/NASA)and the USDAwebsite(http://openstax.org/l/USDA)to read\nabout government research that would not take place were it left to firms, due to the externalities.\nThe first column ofTable 13.3shows the sources of total U.S. spending on research and development. The\nsecond column shows the total dollars of R&D funding by each source. The third column shows that, relative to\nthe total amount of funding, 22.7% comes from the federal government, about 69% of R&D is done by industry,\nand less than 4% is done by universities and colleges. (The percentages below do not add up to exactly 100%\ndue to rounding.)\nSources of R&D Funding Amount ($ billions) Percent of the Total\nFederal government $129.6 21.4%\nIndustry $426.0 70.3%\nUniversities and colleges $20.7 3.4%\nNonprofits $25.0 4.1%\nNonfederal government $4.8 0.8%\nTotal $606.1\nTABLE13.3U.S. Research and Development Expenditures, 2018\n(Source: https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf21324)\nIn the 1960s the federal government paid for about two-thirds of the nation\u2019s R&D. Over time, the U.S. economy\nhas come to rely much more heavily on industry-funded R&D. The federal government has tried to focus its\ndirect R&D spending on areas where private firms are not as active. One difficulty with direct government\nsupport of R&D is that it inevitably involves political decisions about which projects are worthy. The scientific\nquestion of whether research is worthwhile can easily become entangled with considerations like the location\nof the congressional district in which the research funding is spent.\nPolicy #2: Tax Breaks for Research and Development\nA complementary approach to supporting R&D that does not involve the government\u2019s close scrutiny of\nspecific projects is to give firms a reduction in taxes depending on how much research and development they\ndo. The federal government refers to this policy as the research and experimentation (R&E) tax credit.\nAccording to the Treasury Department: \u201c. . . the R&E Credit is also a cost-effective policy for stimulating\nadditional private sector investment. Most recent studies find that each dollar of foregone tax revenue through\nthe R&E Tax Credit causes firms to invest at least a dollar in R&D, with some studies finding a benefit to cost\nratio of 2 or 2.96.\u201d\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/REtaxcredit)for more information on how the R&E Tax Credit\nencourages investment. 316 13 \u2022 Positive Externalities and Public Goods\nPolicy #3 Cooperative Research\nState and federal governments support research in a variety of ways. For example, United for Medical\nResearch, a coalition of groups that seek funding for theNational Institutes of Health, (which is supported by\nfederal grants), states: \u201cNIH-supported research added $69 billion to our GDP and supported seven million\njobs in 2011 alone.\u201d The United States remains the leading sponsor of medical-related research, spending\n$117 billion in 2011. Other institutions, such as theNational Academy of Sciencesand theNational Academy\nof Engineering, receive federal grants for innovative projects. TheAgriculture and Food Research Initiative\n(AFRI)at the United States Department of Agriculture awards federal grants to projects that apply the best\nscience to the most important agricultural problems, from food safety to childhood obesity. Cooperation\nbetween government-funded universities, academies, and the private sector can spur product innovation and\ncreate whole new industries.\n13.3Public Goods\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Identify a public good using nonexcludable and non-rival as criteria\n\u2022 Explain the free rider problem\n\u2022 Identify several sources of public goods\nEven though new technology creates positive externalities so that perhaps one-half or two-thirds of the social\nbenefit of new inventions spills over to others, the inventor still receives some private return. What about a\nsituation where the positive externalities are so extensive that private firms could not expect to receive any of\nthe social benefit? We call this kind of good apublic good. Spending on national defense is a good example of a\npublic good. Let\u2019s begin by defining the characteristics of a public good and discussing why these\ncharacteristics make it difficult for private firms to supply public goods. Then we will see how government may\nstep in to address the issue.\nThe Definition of a Public Good\nEconomists have a strict definition of a public good, and it does not necessarily include all goods financed\nthrough taxes. To understand the defining characteristics of a public good, first consider an ordinary private\ngood, like a piece of pizza. We can buy and sell a piece of pizza fairly easily because it is a separate and\nidentifiable item. However, public goods are not separate and identifiable in this way.\nInstead, public goods have two defining characteristics: they are nonexcludable and non-rival. The first\ncharacteristic, that a public good isnonexcludable, means that it is costly or impossible to exclude someone\nfrom using the good. If Larry buys a private good like a piece of pizza, then he can exclude others, like Lorna,\nfrom eating that pizza. However, if national defense is provided, then it includes everyone. Even if you strongly\ndisagree with America\u2019s defense policies or with the level of defense spending, the national defense still\nprotects you. You cannot choose to be unprotected, and national defense cannot protect everyone else and\nexclude you.\nThe second main characteristic of a public good, that it isnon-rival, means that when one person uses the\npublic good, another can also use it. With a private good like pizza, if Max is eating the pizza then Michelle\ncannot also eat it; that is, the two people are rivals in consumption. With a public good like national defense,\nMax\u2019s consumption of national defense does not reduce the amount left for Michelle, so they are non-rival in\nthis area.\nA number of government services are examples of public goods. For instance, it would not be easy to provide\nfire and police service so that some people in a neighborhood would be protected from the burning and\nburglary of their property, while others would not be protected at all. Protecting some necessarily means\nprotecting others, too.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13.3 \u2022 Public Goods 317\nPositive externalities and public goods are closely related concepts. Public goods have positive externalities,\nlike police protection or public health funding. Not all goods and services with positive externalities, however,\nare public goods. Investments in education have huge positive spillovers but can be provided by a private\ncompany. Private companies can invest in new inventions such as the Apple iPad and reap profits that may not\ncapture all of the social benefits. We can also describe patents as an attempt to make new inventions into\nprivate goods, which are excludable and rivalrous, so that no one but the inventor can use them during the\nlength of the patent.\nThe Free Rider Problem of Public Goods\nPrivate companies find it difficult to produce public goods. If a good or service is nonexcludable, like national\ndefense, so that it is impossible or very costly to exclude people from using this good or service, then how can a\nfirm charge people for it?\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/freerider)to read about a connection between free riders and \u201cbad\nmusic.\u201d\nWhen individuals make decisions about buying a public good, afree riderproblem can arise, in which people\nhave an incentive to let others pay for the public good and then to \u201cfree ride\u201d on the purchases of others. We\ncan express the free rider problem in terms of the prisoner\u2019s dilemma game, which we discussed as a\nrepresentation of oligopoly inMonopolistic Competition and Oligopoly.\nThere is a dilemma with the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, though. See the Work It Out feature.\nWORK IT OUT\nThe Problem with the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma\nSuppose two people, Rachel and Samuel, are considering purchasing a public good. The difficulty with the\nprisoner\u2019s dilemma arises as each person thinks through their strategic choices.\nStep 1. Rachel reasons in this way: If Samuel does not contribute, then I would be a fool to contribute. However,\nif Samuel does contribute, then I can come out ahead by not contributing.\nStep 2. Either way, I should choose not to contribute, and instead hope that I can be a free rider who uses the\npublic good paid for by Samuel.\nStep 3. Samuel reasons the same way about Rachel.\nStep 4. When both people reason in that way, the public good never gets built, and there is no movement to the\noption where everyone cooperates\u2014which is actually best for all parties.\nThe Role of Government in Paying for Public Goods\nThe key insight in paying for public goods is to find a way of assuring that everyone will make a contribution\nand to prevent free riders. For example, if people come together through the political process and agree to pay\ntaxes and make group decisions about the quantity of public goods, they can defeat the free rider problem by\nrequiring, through the law, that everyone contributes.\nHowever, government spending and taxes are not the only way to provide public goods. In some cases, markets\ncan produce public goods. For example, think about radio. It is nonexcludable, since once the radio signal is\nbroadcast, it would be very difficult to stop someone from receiving it. It is non-rival, since one person\nlistening to the signal does not prevent others from listening as well. Because of these features, it is practically 318 13 \u2022 Positive Externalities and Public Goods\nimpossible to charge listeners directly for listening to conventional radio broadcasts.\nRadio has found a way to collect revenue by selling advertising, which is an indirect way of \u201ccharging\u201d listeners\nby taking up some of their time. Ultimately, consumers who purchase the goods advertised are also paying for\nthe radio service, since the station builds in the cost of advertising into the product cost. In a more recent\ndevelopment, satellite radio companies, such as SiriusXM, charge a regular subscription fee for streaming\nmusic without commercials. In this case, however, the product is excludable\u2014only those who pay for the\nsubscription will receive the broadcast.\nSome public goods will also have a mixture of public provision at no charge along with fees for some purposes,\nlike a public city park that is free to use, but the government charges a fee for parking your car, for reserving\ncertain picnic grounds, and for food sold at a refreshment stand.\nLINK IT UP\nRead thisarticle(http://openstax.org/l/governmentpay)to find out what economists say the government should\npay for.\nIn other cases, we can use social pressures and personal appeals, rather than the force of law, to reduce the\nnumber of free riders and to collect resources for the public good. For example, neighbors sometimes form an\nassociation to carry out beautification projects or to patrol their area after dark to discourage crime. In low-\nincome countries, where social pressure strongly encourages all farmers to participate, farmers in a region\nmay come together to work on a large irrigation project that will benefit all. We can view many fundraising\nefforts, including raising money for local charities and for the endowments of colleges and universities, as an\nattempt to use social pressure to discourage free riding and to generate the outcome that will produce a public\nbenefit.\nCommon Resources and the \u201cTragedy of the Commons\u201d\nThere are some goods that do not fall neatly into the categories of private good or public good. While it is easy\nto classify a pizza as a private good and a city park as a public good, what about an item that is nonexcludable\nand rivalrous, such as the queen conch?\nIn the Caribbean, the queen conch is a large marine mollusk that lives in shallow waters of sea grass. These\nwaters are so shallow, and so clear, that a single diver may harvest many conch in a single day. Not only is\nconch meat a local delicacy and an important part of the local diet, but artists use the large ornate shells and\ncraftsmen transform them. Because almost anyone with a small boat, snorkel, and mask, can participate in the\nconch harvest, it is essentially nonexcludable. At the same time, fishing for conch is rivalrous. Once a diver\ncatches one conch another diver cannot catch it.\nWe call goods that are nonexcludable and rivalrouscommon resources. Because the waters of the Caribbean\nare open to all conch fishermen, and because any conch thatyoucatch is a conch thatIcannot catch,\nfishermen tend to overharvest common resources like the conch.\nThe problem of overharvesting common resources is not a new one, but ecologist Garret Hardin put the tag\n\u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d to the problem in a 1968 article in the magazineScience. Economists view this as a\nproblem of property rights. Since nobody owns the ocean, or the conch that crawl on the sand beneath it, no\none individual has an incentive to protect that resource and responsibly harvest it. To address the issue of\noverharvesting conch and other marine fisheries, economists have advocated simple devices like fishing\nlicenses, harvest limits, and shorter fishing seasons. One approach that has been turned to more recently is\nthe implementation of catch shares, whereby regulators establish a total allowable catch, and then fishermen\nare allocated a portion of that total allowable catch. Catch shares appear to slow the race to fish. When the\npopulation of a species drops to critically low numbers, governments have even banned the harvest until\nbiologists determine that the population has returned to sustainable levels. In fact, such is the case with the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13.3 \u2022 Public Goods 319\nconch, the harvesting of which the government has effectively banned in the United States since 1986.\nThe tragedy of the commons is a frequent economic and social framework for discussions about a range of\ncommon resources, even extending into digital resources such as open media repositories and online\nlibraries. Prominent economist Elinor Ostrom, the first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Economics,\nproposed an alternate version, sometimes referred to as the \"non-tragedy of the commons.\" After extensive\nfieldwork in areas as diverse as Indonesia, Kenya, Maine (U.S.), and Nepal, she challenged the notion that\npeople would only avoid depletion of common resources if they were forced to by regulatory laws and property\nrights. She noted that farmers working shared land could communicate and cooperate in order to maximize\nand preserve the fields over time. She argued that when those who benefit most from a resource are in close\nproximity to it (like a farm field that directly serves a town), the resource is better managed without external\ninfluence.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/queenconch)for more on the queen conch industry.\nPositive Externalities in Public Health Programs\nOne of the most remarkable changes in the standard of living in the last several centuries is that people are\nliving longer. Scientists believe that, thousands of years ago, human life expectancy ranged between 20 to 30\nyears. By 1900, average life expectancy in the United States was 47 years. By 2015, life expectancy was 79\nyears; due to COVID-19, life expectancy declined slightly to 77 years in 2020. Most of the gains in life\nexpectancy in the history of the human race happened in the twentieth century.\nThe rise in life expectancy seems to stem from three primary factors. First, systems for providing clean water\nand disposing of human waste helped to prevent the transmission of many diseases. Second, changes in public\nbehavior have advanced health. Early in the twentieth century, for example, people learned the importance of\nboiling bottles before using them for food storage and baby\u2019s milk, washing their hands, and protecting food\nfrom flies. More recent behavioral changes include reducing the number of people who smoke tobacco and\nprecautions to limit sexually transmitted diseases. Third, medicine has played a large role. Scientists\ndeveloped immunizations for diphtheria, cholera, pertussis, tuberculosis, tetanus, and yellow fever between\n1890 and 1930. Penicillin, discovered in 1941, led to a series of other antibiotic drugs for bringing infectious\ndiseases under control. In recent decades, drugs that reduce the risks of high blood pressure have had a\ndramatic effect in extending lives.\nThese advances in public health have all been closely linked to positive externalities and public goods. Public\nhealth officials taught hygienic practices to mothers in the early 1900s and encouraged less smoking in the late\n1900s. Government funded many public sanitation systems and storm sewers because they have the key traits\nof public goods. In the twentieth century, many medical discoveries emerged from government or university-\nfunded research. Patents and intellectual property rights provided an additional incentive for private\ninventors. The reason for requiring immunizations, phrased in economic terms, is that it prevents spillovers of\nillness to others\u2014as well as helping the person immunized.\nBRING IT HOME\nThe Benefits of Voyager I Endure\nWhile we applaud the technology spillovers of NASA\u2019s space projects, we should also acknowledge that those\nbenefits are not shared equally. Economists likeTyler Cowen, a professor at George Mason University, are seeing\nincreasing evidence of a widening gap between those who have access to rapidly improving technology, and those\nwho do not. According to Cowen, author of the 2013 book,Average Is Over: Powering America Beyond the Age of\nthe Great Stagnation, this inequality in access to technology and information is going to deepen the inequality in 320 13 \u2022 Positive Externalities and Public Goods\nskills, and ultimately, in wages and global standards of living.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13 \u2022 Key Terms 321\nKey Terms\nexternal benefits (or positive externalities) beneficial spillovers to a third party of parties, who did not\npurchase the good or service that provided the externalities\nfree rider those who want others to pay for the public good and then plan to use the good themselves; if many\npeople act as free riders, the public good may never be provided\nintellectual property the body of law including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secret law that\nprotect the right of inventors to produce and sell their inventions\nnonexcludable when it is costly or impossible to exclude someone from using the good, and thus hard to\ncharge for it\nnonrivalrous even when one person uses the good, others can also use it\npositive externalities beneficial spillovers to a third party or parties\nprivate benefits the benefits a person who consumes a good or service receives, or a new product's benefits or\nprocess that a company invents that the company captures\nprivate rates of return when the estimated rates of return go primarily to an individual; for example, earning\ninterest on a savings account\npublic good good that is nonexcludable and non-rival, and thus is difficult for market producers to sell to\nindividual consumers\nsocial benefits the sum of private benefits and external benefits\nsocial rate of return when the estimated rates of return go primarily to society; for example, providing free\neducation\nKey Concepts and Summary\n13.1Investments in Innovation\nCompetition creates pressure to innovate. However, if one can easily copy new inventions, then the original\ninventor loses the incentive to invest further in research and development. New technology often has positive\nexternalities; that is, there are often spillovers from the invention of new technology that benefit firms other\nthan the innovator. The social benefit of an invention, once the firm accounts for these spillovers, typically\nexceeds the private benefit to the inventor. If inventors could receive a greater share of the broader social\nbenefits for their work, they would have a greater incentive to seek out new inventions.\n13.2How Governments Can Encourage Innovation\nPublic policy with regard to technology must often strike a balance. For example, patents provide an incentive\nfor inventors, but they should be limited to genuinely new inventions and not extend forever.\nGovernment has a variety of policy tools for increasing the rate of return for new technology and encouraging\nits development, including: direct government funding of R&D, tax incentives for R&D, protection of\nintellectual property, and forming cooperative relationships between universities and the private sector.\n13.3Public Goods\nA public good has two key characteristics: it is nonexcludable and non-rival. Nonexcludable means that it is\ncostly or impossible for one user to exclude others from using the good. Non-rival means that when one person\nuses the good, it does not prevent others from using it. Markets often have a difficult time producing public\ngoods because free riders will attempt to use the public good without paying for it. One can overcome the free\nrider problem through measures to assure that users of the public good pay for it. Such measures include\ngovernment actions, social pressures, and specific situations where markets have discovered a way to collect\npayments.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

According to a 2015 study by the\nGeorgetown Center on Education and the Workforce, 40% of college students work 30 hours or more per week.\nAt the same time, the cost of college seems to rise every year. The data show that between the 2000\u20132001\nacademic year and the 2019\u20132020 academic year, the cost of tuition, fees, and room and board has slightly more\nthan doubled for private four-year colleges, and has increased by a factor of almost 2.5 for public four-year colleges.\nThus, even full time employment may not be enough to cover college expenses anymore. Working full time at\nminimum wage\u201440 hours per week, 52 weeks per year\u2014earns $15,080 before taxes, which is substantially less 326 14 \u2022 Labor Markets and Income\nthan the more than $25,000 estimated as the average cost in 2022 for a year of college at a public university. The\nresult of these costs is that student loan debt topped $1.3 trillion this year.\nDespite these disheartening figures, the value of a bachelor\u2019s degree has never been higher. How do we explain this?\nThis chapter will tell us.\nIn a market economy like the United States, income comes from ownership of the means of production:\nresources or assets. More precisely, one\u2019s income is a function of two things: the quantity of each resource one\nowns, and the value society places on those resources. Recall from the chapter onProduction, Costs, and\nIndustry Structure, each factor of production has an associated factor payment. For the majority of us, the\nmost important resource we own is our labor. Thus, most of our income is wages, salaries, commissions, tips\nand other types of labor income. Your labor income depends on how many hours you work and the wage rate\nan employer will pay you for those hours. At the same time, some people own real estate, which they can either\nuse themselves or rent out to other users. Some people have financial assets like bank accounts, stocks and\nbonds, for which they earn interest, dividends or some other form of income.\nEach of these factor payments, like wages for labor and interest for financial capital, is determined in their\nrespective factor markets. For the rest of this chapter, we will focus on labor markets, but other factor markets\noperate similarly. Later in Chapter 17 we will describe how this works for financial capital.\n14.1The Theory of Labor Markets\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Describe the demand for labor in perfectly competitive output markets\n\u2022 Describe the demand for labor in imperfectly competitive output markets\n\u2022 Identify what determines the going market rate for labor\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat is the labor market?\nThe labor market is the term that economists use for all the different markets for labor. There is no single labor\nmarket. Rather, there is a different market for every different type of labor. Labor differs by type of work (e.g. retail\nsales vs. scientist), skill level (entry level or more experienced), and location (the market for administrative\nassistants is probably more local or regional than the market for university presidents). While each labor market is\ndifferent, they all tend to operate in similar ways. For example, when wages go up in one labor market, they tend to\ngo up in others too. When economists talk about the labor market, they are describing these similarities.\nThe labor market, like all markets, has a demand and a supply. Why do firms demand labor? Why is an\nemployer willing to pay you for your labor? It\u2019s not because the employer likes you or is socially conscious.\nRather, it\u2019s because your labor is worth something to the employer--your work brings in revenues to the firm.\nHow much is an employer willing to pay? That depends on the skills and experience you bring to the firm.\nIf a firm wants to maximize profits, it will never pay more (in terms of wages and benefits) for a worker than the\nvalue of their marginal productivity to the firm. We call this thefirst rule of labor markets.\nSuppose a worker can produce two widgets per hour and the firm can sell each widget for $4 each. Then the\nworker is generating $8 per hour in revenues to the firm, and a profit-maximizing employer will pay the\nworker up to, but no more than, $8 per hour, because that is what the worker is worth to the firm.\nRecall the definition of marginal product. Marginal product is the additional output a firm can produce by\nadding one more worker to the production process. Since employers often hire labor by the hour, we\u2019ll define\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14.1 \u2022 The Theory of Labor Markets 327\nmarginal product as the additional output the firm produces by adding one more worker hour to the\nproduction process. In this chapter, we assume that workers in a particular labor market are\nhomogeneous\u2014they have the same background, experience and skills and they put in the same amount of\neffort. Thus, marginal product depends on the capital and technology with which workers have to work.\nA typist can type more pages per hour with an electric typewriter than a manual typewriter, and the typist can\ntype even more pages per hour with a personal computer and word processing software. A ditch digger can dig\nmore cubic feet of dirt in an hour with a backhoe than with a shovel.\nThus, we can define the demand for labor as the marginal product of labor times the value of that output to the\nfirm.\n# Workers (L) 1 2 3 4\nMP 4 3 2 1\nL\nTABLE14.1Marginal Product\nof Labor\nFIGURE14.2Marginal Product of LaborBecause of fixed capital, the marginal product of labor declines as the\nemployer hires additional workers.\nOn what does the value of each worker\u2019s marginal product depend? If we assume that the employer sells its\noutput in a perfectly competitive market, the value of each worker\u2019s output will be the market price of the\nproduct. Thus,\nDemand for Labor = MP x P = Value of the Marginal Product of Labor\nL\nWe show this inTable 14.2, which is an expanded version ofTable 14.1\n# Workers (L) 1 2 3 4\nMP 4 3 2 1\nL\nPrice of Output $4 $4 $4 $4\nVMP $16 $12 $8 $4\nL\nTABLE14.2Value of the Marginal\nProduct of Labor 328 14 \u2022 Labor Markets and Income\nNote that the value of each additional worker is less than the value of the ones who came before.\nFIGURE14.3Value of the Marginal Product of LaborFor firms operating in a competitive output market, the value of\nadditional output sold is the price the firms receive for the output. Since MP declines with additional labor\nL\nemployed, while that marginal product is worth the market price, the value of the marginal product declines as\nemployment increases.\nDemand for Labor in Perfectly Competitive Output Markets\nThe question for any firm is how much labor to hire.\nWe can define aPerfectly Competitive Labor Marketas one where firms can hire all the labor they want at the\ngoing market wage. Think about secretaries in a large city. Employers who need secretaries can probably hire\nas many as they need if they pay the going wage rate.\nGraphically, this means that firms face a horizontal supply curve for labor, as Figure 14.3 shows.\nGiven the market wage, profit maximizing firms hire workers up to the point where: W = VMP\nmkt L\nFIGURE14.4Equilibrium Employment for Firms in a Competitive Labor MarketIn a perfectly competitive labor\nmarket, firms can hire all the labor they want at the going market wage. Therefore, they hire workers up to the point\nL where the going market wage equals the value of the marginal product of labor.\n1\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14.1 \u2022 The Theory of Labor Markets 329\nCLEAR IT UP\nDerived Demand\nEconomists describe the demand for inputs like labor as aderived demand. Since the demand for labor is MPL*P, it\nis dependent on the demand for the product the firm is producing. We show this by the P term in the demand for\nlabor. An increase in demand for the firm\u2019s product drives up the product\u2019s price, which increases the firm\u2019s demand\nfor labor. Thus, we derive the demand for labor from the demand for the firm\u2019s output.\nDemand for Labor in Imperfectly Competitive Output Markets\nIf the employer does not sell its output in a perfectly competitive industry, they face a downward sloping\ndemand curve for output, which means that in order to sell additional output the firm must lower its price.\nThis is true if the firm is a monopoly, but it\u2019s also true if the firm is an oligopoly or monopolistically\ncompetitive. In this situation, the value of a worker\u2019s marginal product is the marginal revenue, not the price.\nThus, the demand for labor is the marginal product times the marginal revenue.\nThe Demand for Labor = MP x MR = Marginal Revenue Product\nL\n# Workers (L) 1 2 3 4\nMP 4 3 2 1\nL\nMarginal Revenue $4 $3 $2 $1\nMRP $16 $9 $4 $1\nL\nTABLE14.3Marginal Revenue Product\nFIGURE14.5Marginal Revenue ProductFor firms with some market power in their output market, the value of\nadditional output sold is the firm\u2019s marginal revenue. Since MP declines with additional labor employed and since\nL\nMR declines with additional output sold, the firm\u2019s marginal revenue declines as employment increases.\nEverything else remains the same as we described above in the discussion of the labor demand in perfectly\ncompetitive labor markets. Given the market wage, profit-maximizing firms will hire workers up to the point\nwhere the market wage equals the marginal revenue product, asFigure 14.6shows. 330 14 \u2022 Labor Markets and Income\nFIGURE14.6Equilibrium Level of Employment for Firms with Market PowerFor firms with market power in their\noutput market, they choose the number of workers, L , where the going market wage equals the firm\u2019s marginal\n2\nrevenue product. Note that since marginal revenue is less than price, the demand for labor for a firm which has\nmarket power in its output market is less than the demand for labor (L ) for a perfectly competitive firm. As a result,\n1\nemployment will be lower in an imperfectly competitive industry than in a perfectly competitive industry.\nCLEAR IT UP\nDo Profit Maximizing Employers Exploit Labor?\nIf you look back atFigure 14.4, you will see that the firm pays only the last worker it hires what they\u2019re worth to the\nfirm. Every other worker brings in more revenue than the firm pays them. This has sometimes led to the claim that\nemployers exploit workers because they do not pay workers what they are worth. Let\u2019s think about this claim. The\nfirst worker is worth $x to the firm, and the second worker is worth $y, but why are they worth that much? It is\nbecause of the capital and technology with which they work. The difference between workers\u2019 worth and their\ncompensation goes to pay for the capital and technology, without which the workers wouldn\u2019t have a job. The\ndifference also goes to the employer\u2019s profit, without which the firm would close and workers wouldn\u2019t have a job.\nThe firm may be earning excessive profits, but that is a different topic of discussion.\nWhat Determines the Going Market Wage Rate?\nIn the chapter onLabor and Financial Markets, we learned that the labor market has demand and supply\ncurves like other markets. The demand for labor curve is a downward sloping function of the wage rate. The\nmarket demand for labor is the horizontal sum of all firms\u2019 demands for labor. The supply of labor curve is an\nupward sloping function of the wage rate. This is because if wages for a particular type of labor increase in a\nparticular labor market, people with appropriate skills may change jobs, and vacancies will attract people from\noutside the geographic area. The market supply of labor is the horizontal summation of all individuals\u2019\nsupplies of labor.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14.2 \u2022 Wages and Employment in an Imperfectly Competitive Labor Market 331\nFIGURE14.7The Market Wage RateIn a competitive labor market, the equilibrium wage and employment level are\ndetermined where the market demand for labor equals the market supply of labor.\nLike all equilibrium prices, the market wage rate is determined through the interaction of supply and demand\nin the labor market. Thus, we can see inFigure 14.7for competitive markets the wage rate and number of\nworkers hired.\nThe FRED database has a great deal of data on labor markets, starting atthe wage rate and number of workers\nhired(https://openstax.org/l/cat10).\nThe United States Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics publishesThe Current Population Survey,\nwhich is a monthly survey of households (you can find a link to it by going to the FRED database found in the\nprevious link), which provides data on labor supply, including numerous measures of the labor force size\n(disaggregated by age, gender and educational attainment), labor force participation rates for different\ndemographic groups, and employment. It also includes more than 3,500 measures of earnings by different\ndemographic groups.\nThe Current Employment Statistics, which is a survey of businesses, offers alternative estimates of\nemployment across all sectors of the economy.\nThe FRED database, found in the previous link, also has a link labeled \"Productivity and Costs\" has a wide\nrange of data on productivity, labor costs, and profits across the business sector.\n14.2Wages and Employment in an Imperfectly Competitive Labor Market\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Define monopsony power\n\u2022 Explain how imperfectly competitive labor markets determine wages and employment, where employers\nhave market power\nIn the chapters on market structure, we observed that while economists use the theory of perfect competition\nas an ideal case of market structure, there are very few examples of perfectly competitive industries in the real\nworld. What about labor markets? How many labor markets are perfectly competitive? There are probably\nmore examples of perfectly competitive labor markets than perfectly competitive product markets, but that\ndoesn\u2019t mean that all labor markets are competitive.\nWhen a job applicant is bargaining with an employer for a position, the applicant is often at a\ndisadvantage\u2014needing the job more than the employer needs that particular applicant. John Bates Clark\n(1847\u20131938), often named as the first great American economist, wrote in 1907: \u201cIn the making of the wages\ncontract the individual laborer is always at a disadvantage.

These are demand side sources, that is, labor\nmarket power by employers, and supply side sources: labor market power by employees. In this section we will\ndiscuss the former. In the next section we will discuss the latter.\nA competitive labor market is one where there are many potential employers for a given type of worker, say a\nsecretary or an accountant. Suppose there is only one employer in a labor market. Because that employer has\nno direct competition in hiring, if they offer lower wages than would exist in a competitive market, employees\nwill have few options. If they want a job, they must accept the offered wage rate. Since the employer is\nexploiting its market power, we call the firm amonopsony, a term introduced and widely discussed by Joan\nRobinson (though she credited scholar Bertrand Hallward with invention of the word). The classical example of\nmonopsony is the sole coal company in a West Virginia town. If coal miners want to work, they must accept\nwhat the coal company is paying. This is not the only example of monopsony. Think about surgical nurses in a\ntown with only one hospital. A situation in which employers have at least some market power over potential\nemployees is not that unusual. After all, most firms have many employees while there is only one employer.\nThus, even if there is some competition for workers, it may not feel that way to potential employees unless they\ndo their research and find the opposite.\nHow does market power by an employer affect labor market outcomes? Intuitively, one might think that wages\nwill be lower than in a competitive labor market. Let\u2019s prove it. We will tell the story for a monopsonist, but the\nresults will be qualitatively similar, although less extreme, for any firm with labor market power.\nThink back to monopoly. The good news for the firm is that because the monopolist is the sole supplier in the\nmarket, it can charge any price it wishes. The bad news is that if it wants to sell a greater quantity of output, it\nmust lower the price it charges. Monopsony is analogous. Because the monopsonist is the sole employer in a\nlabor market, it can offer any wage that it wishes. However, because they face the market supply curve for\nlabor, if they want to hire more workers, they must raise the wage they pay. This creates a quandary, which we\ncan understand by introducing a new concept: the marginal cost of labor. Themarginal cost of laboris the\ncost to the firm of hiring one more worker. However, here is the thing: we assume that the firm is determining\nhow many workers to hire in total. They are not hiring sequentially. Let\u2019s look how this plays out with the 334 14 \u2022 Labor Markets and Income\nexample inTable 14.5.\nSupply of Labor 1 2 3 4 5\nWage Rate $1 per hour $2 per hour $3 per hour $4 per hour $5 per hour\nTotal Cost of Labor $1 $4 $9 $16 $25\nMarginal Cost of Labor $1 $3 $5 $7 $9\nTABLE14.5The Marginal Cost of Labor\nThere are a couple of things to notice from the table. First, the marginal cost increases faster than the wage\nrate. In fact, for any number of workers more than one, the marginal cost of labor is greater than the wage. This\nis because to hire one more worker requires paying a higher wage rate, not just for the new worker but for all\nthe previous hires also. We can see this graphically in Figure 14.7.\nFIGURE14.8The Marginal Cost of LaborSince monopsonies are the sole demander for labor, they face the market\nsupply curve for labor. In order to increase employment they must raise the wage they pay not just for new workers,\nbut for all the existing workers they could have hired at the previous lower wage. As a result, the marginal cost of\nhiring additional labor is greater than the wage, and thus for any level of employment (above the first worker), MC is\nL\nabove the Market Supply of Labor.\nFIGURE14.9Labor Market Outcomes Under MonopsonyA monopsony will hire workers up to the point Lm where\nits demand for labor equals the marginal cost of additional labor, paying the wage Wm given by the supply curve of\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14.3 \u2022 Market Power on the Supply Side of Labor Markets: Unions 335\nlabor necessary to obtain Lm workers.\nIf the firm wants to maximize profits, it will hire labor up to the point Lm where D = VMP (or MRP) = MC , as\nL L\nFigure 14.9shows. Then, the supply curve for labor shows the wage the firm will have to pay to attract Lm\nworkers. Graphically, we can draw a vertical line up from Lm to the Supply Curve for the label and then read\nthe wage Wm off the vertical axis to the left.\nHow does this outcome compare to what would occur in a perfectly competitive market? A competitive market\nwould operate where D = S , hiring Lc workers and paying Wc wage. In other words, under monopsony\nL L\nemployers hire fewer workers and pay a lower wage. While pure monopsony may be rare, many employers\nhave some degree of market power in labor markets. The outcomes for those employers will be qualitatively\nsimilar though not as extreme as monopsony.\nFIGURE14.10Comparison of labor market outcomes: Monopsony vs. Perfect CompetitionA monopsony hires\nfewer workers (Lm) than would be hired in a competitive labor market (Lc). In exploiting its market power, the\nmonopsony can also pay a lower wage (Wm) than workers would earn in a competitive labor market (Wc).\n14.3Market Power on the Supply Side of Labor Markets: Unions\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain the concept of labor unions, including membership levels and wages\n\u2022 Evaluate arguments for and against labor unions\n\u2022 Analyze reasons for the decline in U.S. union membership\nA labor union is an organization of workers that negotiates with employers over wages and working conditions.\nA labor union seeks to change the balance of power between employers and workers by requiring employers to\ndeal with workers collectively, rather than as individuals. As such, a labor union operates like a monopoly in a\nlabor market. We sometimes call negotiations between unions and firmscollective bargaining.\nThe subject of labor unions can be controversial. Supporters of labor unions view them as the workers\u2019\nprimary line of defense against efforts by profit-seeking firms to hold down wages and benefits. Critics of labor\nunions view them as having a tendency to grab as much as they can in the short term, even if it means injuring\nworkers in the long run by driving firms into bankruptcy or by blocking the new technologies and production\nmethods that lead to economic growth. We will start with some facts about union membership in the United\nStates.\nFacts about Union Membership and Pay\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics, about 10.3% of all U.S. workers belong to unions. This\nrepresents nearly a 50% reduction since 1983 (the earliest year for which comparable data are available), 336 14 \u2022 Labor Markets and Income\nwhen union members were 20.1% of all workers. Following are some facts about unions for 2021 (note that we\nare using the population categories and group names utilized in the data collection and publication):\n\u2022 10.6% of U.S. male workers belong to unions; 9.9% of female workers do\n\u2022 10.7% of White workers, 12.3% of Black workers, and 9.8 % of Hispanic workers belong to unions\n\u2022 11.8% of full-time workers and 5.7% of part-time workers are union members\n\u2022 4.4% of workers ages 16\u201324 belong to unions, as do 13.2% of workers ages 45-54\n\u2022 Occupations in which relatively high percentages of workers belong to unions are the federal government\n(26.0% belong to a union), state government (29.9%), local government (41.7%); transportation and\nutilities (17.6%); natural resources, construction, and maintenance (15.9%); and production,\ntransportation, and material moving (13.3%)\n\u2022 Occupations that have relatively low percentages of unionized workers are agricultural workers (1.7%),\nfinancial services (1.9%), professional and business services (2.2%), leisure and hospitality (2.2%), and\nwholesale and retail trade (4.5%)\nIn summary, the percentage of workers belonging to a union is higher for men than women; higher for Black\nthan for White or Hispanic people; higher for the 45\u201364 age range; and higher among workers in government\nand manufacturing than workers in agriculture or service-oriented jobs.Table 14.6lists the largest U.S. labor\nunions and their membership.\nUnion Membership\nNational Education Association (NEA) 3.0 million\nService Employees International Union (SEIU) 2.0 million\nAmerican Federation of Teachers (AFT) 1.7 million\nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) 1.4 million\nThe American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Workers (AFSCME) 1.6 million\nUnited Food and Commercial Workers International Union 1.3 million\nInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) 775,000\nUnited Steelworkers 625,000\nInternational Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers 569,000\nInternational Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of\n408,000\nAmerica (UAW)\nTABLE14.6The Largest American Unions in 2021(Source: U.S. Department of Labor and individual union websites)\nIn terms of pay, benefits, and hiring, U.S. unions offer a good news/bad news story. The good news for unions\nand their members is that their members earn about 20% more than nonunion workers, even after adjusting\nfor factors such as years of work experience and education level. The bad news for unions is that the share of\nU.S. workers who belong to a labor union has been steadily declining for 50 years, asFigure 14.11shows.\nAbout one-quarter of all U.S. workers belonged to a union in the mid-1950s, but only 10.3% of U.S. workers are\nunion members today. If you leave out government workers (which includes teachers in public schools), only\n6.1% of the workers employed by private firms now work for a union.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14.3 \u2022 Market Power on the Supply Side of Labor Markets: Unions 337\nFIGURE14.11Percentage of Wage and Salary Workers Who Are Union MembersThe share of wage and salary\nworkers who belong to unions rose sharply in the 1930s and 1940s, but has tailed off since then to 10.3% of all\nworkers in 2021.\nThe following section analyzes the higher pay union workers receive compared the pay rates for nonunion\nworkers. The section after that analyzes declining union membership levels. An overview of these two issues\nwill allow us to discuss many aspects of how unions work.\nHigher Wages for Union Workers\nHow does a union affect wages and employment? Because a union is the sole supplier of labor, it can act like a\nmonopoly and ask for whatever wage rate it can obtain for its workers. If employers need workers, they have to\nmeet the union\u2019s wage demand.\nWhat are the limits on how much higher pay union workers can receive? To analyze these questions, let\u2019s\nconsider a situation where all firms in an industry must negotiate with a single union, and no firm is allowed to\nhire nonunion labor. If no labor union existed in this market, then equilibrium (E) in the labor market would\noccur at the intersection of the demand for labor (D) and the supply of labor (S) as we see inFigure 14.12. This\nis the same result as we showed in Figure 14.6 above. The union can, however, threaten that, unless firms\nagree to the wages they demand, the workers will strike. As a result, the labor union manages to achieve,\nthrough negotiations with the firms, a union wage of Wu for its members, above what the equilibrium wage\nwould otherwise have been. 338 14 \u2022 Labor Markets and Income\nFIGURE14.12Union Wage NegotiationsWithout a union, the equilibrium at E would have involved the wage We\nand the quantity of labor Qe. However, the union is able to use its bargaining power to raise the wage to Wu. The\nresult is an excess supply of labor for union jobs. That is, a quantity of labor supplied, Qs is greater than firms\u2019\nquantity demanded for labor, Qd.\nThis labor market situation resembles what a monopoly firm does in selling a product, but in this case a union\nis a monopoly selling labor to firms. At the higher union wage Wu, the firms in this industry will hire less labor\nthan they would have hired in equilibrium. Moreover, an excess supply of workers want union jobs, but firms\nwill not be hiring for such jobs.\nFrom the union point of view, workers who receive higher wages are better off. However, notice that the\nquantity of workers (Qd) hired at the union wage Wu is smaller than the quantity Qe that the firm would have\nhired at the original equilibrium wage. A sensible union must recognize that when it pushes up the wage, it\nalso reduces the firms\u2019 incentive to hire. This situation does not necessarily mean that union workers are fired.\nInstead, it may be that when union workers move on to other jobs or retire, they are not always replaced, or\nperhaps when a firm expands production, it expands employment somewhat less with a higher union wage\nthan it would have done with the lower equilibrium wage. Other situations could be that a firm decides to\npurchase inputs from nonunion producers, rather than producing them with its own highly paid unionized\nworkers, or perhaps the firm moves or opens a new facility in a state or country where unions are less\npowerful.\nFrom the firm\u2019s point of view, the key question is whether union workers\u2019 higher wages are matched by higher\nproductivity. If so, then the firm can afford to pay the higher union wages and, the demand curve for\n\u201cunionized\u201d labor could actually shift to the right. This could reduce the job losses as the equilibrium\nemployment level shifts to the right and the difference between the equilibrium and the union wages will have\nbeen reduced. If worker unionization does not increase productivity, then the higher union wage will cause\nlower profits or losses for the firm.\nUnion workers might have higher productivity than nonunion workers for a number of reasons. First, higher\nwages may elicit higher productivity. Second, union workers tend to stay longer at a given job, a trend that\nreduces the employer\u2019s costs for training and hiring and results in workers with more years of experience.\nMany unions also offer job training and apprenticeship programs.\nIn addition, firms that are confronted with union demands for higher wages may choose production methods\nthat involve more physical capital and less labor, resulting in increased labor productivity.Table 14.7provides\nan example. Assume that a firm can produce a home exercise cycle with three different combinations of labor\nand manufacturing equipment. Say that the firm pays labor $16 an hour (including benefits) and the machines\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14.3 \u2022 Market Power on the Supply Side of Labor Markets: Unions 339\nfor manufacturing cost $200 each. Under these circumstances, the total cost of producing a home exercise\ncycle will be lowest if the firm adopts the plan of 50 hours of labor and one machine, as the table shows. Now,\nsuppose that a union negotiates a wage of $20 an hour including benefits. In this case, it makes no difference to\nthe firm whether it uses more hours of labor and fewer machines or less labor and more machines, although it\nmight prefer to use more machines and to hire fewer union workers. (After all, machines never threaten to\nstrike\u2014but they do not buy the final product or service either.)\nIn the final column of the table, the wage has risen to $24 an hour. In this case, the firm clearly has an incentive\nfor using the plan that involves paying for fewer hours of labor and using three machines. If management\nresponds to union demands for higher wages by investing more in machinery, then union workers can be\nmore productive because they are working with more or better physical capital equipment than the typical\nnonunion worker. However, the firm will need to hire fewer workers.\nHours of Number of Cost of Labor + Cost of Cost of Labor + Cost of Cost of Labor + Cost of\nLabor Machines Machine $16/hour Machine $20/hour Machine $24/hour\n30 3 $480 + $600 = $1,080 $600 + $600 = $1,200 $720 + $600 = $1,320\n40 2 $640 + $400 = $1,040 $800 + $400 = $1,200 $960 + $400 = $1,360\n50 1 $800 + $200 = $1,000 $1,000 + $200 = $1,200 $1,200 + $200 = $1,400\nTABLE14.7Three Production Choices to Manufacture a Home Exercise Cycle\nIn some cases, unions have discouraged the use of labor-saving physical capital equipment\u2014out of the\nreasonable fear that new machinery will reduce the number of union jobs. For example, in 2015, the union\nrepresenting longshoremen who unload ships and the firms that operate shipping companies and port\nfacilities staged a work stoppage that shut down the ports on the western coast of the United States. Two key\nissues in the dispute were the desire of the shipping companies and port operators to use handheld scanners\nfor record-keeping and computer-operated cabs for loading and unloading ships\u2014changes which the union\nopposed, along with overtime pay. President Obama threatened to use the Labor Management Relations Act of\n1947\u2014commonly known as the Taft-Hartley Act\u2014where a court can impose an 80-day \u201ccooling-off period\u201d in\norder to allow time for negotiations to proceed without the threat of a work stoppage. Federal mediators were\ncalled in, and the two sides agreed to a deal in February 2015. The ultimate agreement allowed the new\ntechnologies, but also kept wages, health, and pension benefits high for workers. In the past, presidential use\nof the Taft-Hartley Act sometimes has made labor negotiations more bitter and argumentative but, in this case,\nit seems to have smoothed the road to an agreement.\nIn other instances, unions have proved quite willing to adopt new technologies. In one prominent example,\nduring the 1950s and 1960s, the United Mineworkers union demanded that mining companies install labor-\nsaving machinery in the mines. The mineworkers\u2019 union realized that over time, the new machines would\nreduce the number of jobs in the mines, but the union leaders also knew that the mine owners would have to\npay higher wages if the workers became more productive, and mechanization was a necessary step toward\ngreater productivity.\nIn fact, in some cases union workers may be more willing to accept new technology than nonunion workers,\nbecause the union workers believe that the union will negotiate to protect their jobs and wages, whereas\nnonunion workers may be more concerned that the new technology will replace their jobs. In addition, union\nworkers, who typically have higher job market experience and training, are likely to suffer less and benefit\nmore than non-union workers from the introduction of new technology. Overall, it is hard to make a definitive\ncase that union workers as a group are always either more or less welcoming to new technology than are\nnonunion workers 340 14 \u2022 Labor Markets and Income\nThe Decline in U.S. Union Membership\nThe proportion of U.S. workers belonging to unions has declined dramatically since the early 1950s.\nEconomists have offered a number of possible explanations:\n\u2022 The shift from manufacturing to service industries\n\u2022 The force of globalization and increased competition from foreign producers\n\u2022 A reduced desire for unions because of the workplace protection laws now in place\n\u2022 U.S. legal environment that makes it relatively more difficult for unions to organize workers and expand\ntheir membership\nLet\u2019s discuss each of these four explanations in more detail.\nA first possible explanation for the decline in the share of U.S. workers belonging to unions involves the\npatterns of job growth in the manufacturing and service sectors of the economy asFigure 14.13shows. The\nU.S. economy had about 15 million manufacturing jobs in 1960. This total rose to 19 million by the late 1970s\nand then declined to 17 million in 2013. Meanwhile, the number of jobs in service industries (including\ngovernment employment) rose from 35 million in 1960 to over 118 million by 2013, according to the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics. Because over time unions were stronger in manufacturing than in service industries, the\ngrowth in jobs was not happening where the unions were. It is interesting to note that government workers\ncomprise several of the biggest unions in the country, including theAmerican Federation of State,County\nand Municipal Employees (AFSCME); theService Employees International Union; and theNational\nEducation Association.Table 14.8lists the membership of each of these unions. Outside of government\nemployees, however, unions have not had great success in organizing the service sector.\nFIGURE14.13The Growth of Service JobsJobs in services have increased dramatically for more than the past 50\nyears. Jobs in government have increased modestly until 1990 and then declined slightly since then. Jobs in\nmanufacturing peaked in the late 1970s and have declined more than a third since then.\nA second explanation for the decline in the share of unionized workers looks at import competition. Starting in\nthe 1960s, U.S. carmakers and steelmakers faced increasing competition from Japanese and European\nmanufacturers. As sales of imported cars and steel rose, the number of jobs in U.S. auto manufacturing fell.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14.3 \u2022 Market Power on the Supply Side of Labor Markets: Unions 341\nThis industry is heavily unionized. Not surprisingly, membership in the United Auto Workers, which was\n975,000 in 1985, had fallen to roughly 390,000 by 2015. Import competition not only decreases the\nemployment in sectors where unions were once strong, but also decreases the bargaining power of unions in\nthose sectors. However, as we have seen, unions that organize public-sector workers, who are not threatened\nby import competition, have continued to see growth.\nA third possible reason for the decline in the number of union workers is that citizens often call on their\nelected representatives to pass laws concerning work conditions, overtime, parental leave, regulation of\npensions, and other issues. Unions offered strong political support for these laws aimed at protecting workers\nbut, in an ironic twist, the passage of those laws then made many workers feel less need for unions.\nThese first three possible reasons for the decline of unions are all somewhat plausible, but they have a\ncommon problem. Most other developed economies have experienced similar economic and political trends,\nsuch as the shift from manufacturing to services, globalization, and increasing government social benefits and\nregulation of the workplace. Clearly there are cultural differences between countries as to their acceptance of\nunions in the workplace. The share of the population belonging to unions in other countries is very high\ncompared with the share in the United States.Table 14.8shows the proportion of workers in a number of the\nworld\u2019s high-income economies who belong to unions. The United States is near the bottom, along with France\nand Spain. The last column shows union coverage, defined as including those workers whose wages are\ndetermined by a union negotiation even if the workers do not officially belong to the union. In the United\nStates, union membership is almost identical to union coverage. However, in many countries, the wages of\nmany workers who do not officially belong to a union are still determined by collective bargaining between\nunions and firms.\nUnion Density: Percentage of Union Coverage: Percentage of Workers Whose Wages\nCountry\nWorkers Belonging to a Union Are Determined by Union Bargaining\nAustria 37% 99%\nFrance 9% 95%\nGermany 26% 63%\nJapan 22% 23%\nNetherlands 25% 82%\nSpain 11.3% 81%\nSweden 82% 92%\nUnited\n29% 35%\nKingdom\nUnited\n11.1% 12.5%\nStates\nTABLE14.8International Comparisons of Union Membership and Coverage in 2012 (Source, CIA World Factbook,\nretrieved from www.cia.gov)\nThese international differences in union membership suggest a fourth reason for the decline of union\nmembership in the United States: perhaps U.S. laws are less friendly to the formation of unions than such laws\nin other countries. The close connection between union membership and a friendly legal environment is 342 14 \u2022 Labor Markets and Income\napparent in the history of U.S. unions. The great rise in union membership in the 1930s followed the passage\nof theNational Labor Relations Actof 1935, which specified that workers had a right to organize unions and\nthat management had to give them a fair chance to do so. The U.S. government strongly encouraged forming\nunions during the early 1940s in the belief that unions would help to coordinate the all-out production efforts\nneeded during World War II. However, after World War II came the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947,\nwhich gave states the power to allow workers to opt out of the union in their workplace if they so desired. This\nlaw made the legal climate less encouraging to those seeking to form unions, and union membership levels\nsoon started declining.\nThe procedures for forming a union differ substantially from country to country. For example, the procedures\nin the United States and those in Canada are strikingly different. When a group of workers wishes to form a\nunion in the United States, they announce this fact and set an election date when the firm's employees will vote\nin a secret ballot on whether to form a union. Supporters of the union lobby for a \u201cyes\u201d vote, and the firm's\nmanagement lobbies for a \u201cno\u201d vote\u2014often even hiring outside consultants for assistance in swaying workers\nto vote \u201cno.\u201d In Canada, by contrast, a union is formed when a sufficient proportion of workers (usually about\n60%) signs an official card saying that they want a union. There is no separate \u201celection date.\u201d The\nmanagement of Canadian firms is limited by law in its ability to lobby against the union. In addition, although\nit is illegal to discriminate and fire workers based on their union activity in the United States, the penalties are\nslight, making this a not so costly way of deterring union activity. In short, forming unions is easier in\nCanada\u2014and in many other countries\u2014than in the United States.\nIn summary, union membership in the United States is lower than in many other high-income countries, a\ndifference that may be due to different legal environments and cultural attitudes toward unions.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/fastfoodwages)to read more about recent protests regarding minimum\nwage for fast food employees.\n14.4Bilateral Monopoly\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to explain:\n\u2022 How firms determine wages and employment when a specific labor market combines a union and a\nmonopsony\nWhat happens when there is market power on both sides of the labor market, in other words, when a union\nmeets a monopsony? Economists call such a situation abilateral monopoly.\nFIGURE14.14Bilateral MonopolyEmployment, L*, will be lower in a bilateral monopoly than in a competitive labor\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14.5 \u2022 Employment Discrimination 343\nmarket, but the equilibrium wage is indeterminate, somewhere in the range between Wu, what the union would\nchoose, and Wm, what the monopsony would choose.\nFigure 14.14is a combination of Figure 14.6 and Figure 14.11. A monopsony wants to reduce wages as well as\nemployment, Wm and L* in the figure. A union wants to increase wages, but at the cost of lower employment,\nWu and L* in the figure. Since both sides want to reduce employment, we can be sure that the outcome will be\nlower employment compared to a competitive labor market. What happens to the wage, though, is based on\nthe monopsonist\u2019s relative bargaining power compared to the bargaining power of the union. The actual\noutcome is indeterminate in the graph, but it will be closer to Wu if the union has more power and closer to\nWm if the monopsonist has more power.\n14.5Employment Discrimination\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Analyze earnings gaps based on race and gender\n\u2022 Explain the impact of discrimination in a competitive market\n\u2022 Identify U.S. public policies designed to reduce discrimination\nBarriers to equitable participation in the labor market drive down economic growth. When certain populations\nare underrepresented, underpaid, or mistreated in a labor market or industry, the negative outcomes can\neffect the larger economy. For example, many science and technology fields were either unwelcoming or\novertly unaccepting of women and people of color. Some major contributors to these fields overcame these\nchallenges. Mexican-American scientist Lydia Villa-Komaroff, for example, faced overt discrimination when\nher college advisor told her not to pursue chemistry because women didn't \"belong\" in chemistry. She pursued\nbiology instead; she developed the first instance of synthetic insulin (the chemical that people with diabetes\nneed in order to survive) through a process that has saved million of lives and is credited with launching the\nentire industry of biotechnology\u2014one of the most important in the U.S. economy. But for every Villa-Komaroff,\nthere have been thousands of women who were prevented from making those contributions. Beyond the\npersonal impact on those people, consider the impact on those scientific fields, our overall quality of life, and\nthe economy itself. Economist Lisa D. Cook has quantified the costs of these innovation losses. She estimates\nthat GDP could be as much as 4.4% higher if women and people from minority populations were fully able to\nparticipate in the science and technology innovation process.\nDiscriminationinvolves acting on the belief that members of a certain group are inferior or deserve less solely\nbecause of a factor such as race, gender, or religion. There are many types of discrimination but the focus here\nwill be on discrimination in labor markets, which arises if workers with the same skill levels\u2014as measured by\neducation, experience, and expertise\u2014receive different pay or have different job opportunities because of their\nrace or gender. Much of the data collected and published on these topics are limited in terms of the diversity of\npeople represented, and focus particularly on binary gender, single-race, and single-ethnicity identities. While\nthese characterizations do not capture the diversity of Americans, the findings are important in order to\nunderstand discrimination and other practices, and to consider the impacts of policies and changes. Also,\nwhile sex and gender are different, many data sets, laws, court decisions, and media accounts use the terms\ninterchangeably. For consistency, we will use the terminology found in the source material and government\ndata.\nEarnings Gaps by Race and Gender\nA possible signal of labor market discrimination is when an employer pays one group less than another.Figure\n14.15shows the average wage of Black workers as a ratio of the average wage of White workers and the average\nwage of female workers as a ratio of the average wage of male workers. Research by the economistsFrancine\nBlauandLaurence Kahnshows that the gap between the earnings of women and men did not move much in\nthe 1970s, but has declined since the 1980s. Detailed analysis by economists Kerwin Kofi Charles and Patrick 344 14 \u2022 Labor Markets and Income\nBayer show that the gap between the earnings of Black and White people diminished in the 1970s, but grew\nagain so that current differences are as wide as they were nearly 70 years ago. In both gender and race, an\nearnings gap remains.\nFIGURE14.15Wage Ratios by Sex and RaceThe ratio of wages for Black workers to White workers rose\nsubstantially in the late 1960s and through the 1970s. The 1990s saw a peak above 80% followed by a bumpy\ndecline to the low 70s. The ratio of wages for female to male workers changed little through the 1970s. In both\ncases, a gap remains between the average wages of Black and White workers and between the average wages of\nfemale and male workers. Source: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nAn earnings gap between average wages, in and of itself, does not prove that discrimination is occurring in the\nlabor market. We need to apply the same productivity characteristics to all parties (employees) involved.\nGender discrimination in the labor market occurs when employers pay people of a specific gender less despite\nthose people having comparable levels of education, experience, and expertise. (Read the Clear It Up about the\nsex-discrimination suit brought against Walmart.) Similarly, racial discrimination in the labor market exists\nwhen employers pay racially diverse employees less than their coworkers of the majority race despite having\ncomparable levels of education, experience, and expertise. To bring a successful gender discrimination\nlawsuit, an employee must prove the employer is paying them less than an employee of a different gender who\nholds a similar job, with similar educational attainment, and with similar expertise. Likewise, someone who\nwants to sue on the grounds of racial discrimination must prove that the employer pays them less than an\nemployee of another race who holds a similar job, with similar educational attainment, and with similar\nexpertise.\nThe FRED database includes earnings data atearnings by age, gender and race/ethnicity(https://openstax.org/\nl/33501).\nAs stated previously and as we will see below, not every instance of a wage gap or employment inequity is a\nproduct of overt discrimination on the part of individual employers. Significant overall issues in societies, such\nas inequitable education or housing segregation, can lead to earning gaps and limitations on economic\nmobility. However, these wider issues usually affect people from minority populations and/or those who have\nbeen historically underrepresented in positions of power. Economist William A. Darity Jr., whose work is\ndiscussed in more detail below, indicates that individualized employer racism still exists, but it is largely\npracticed in \"covert and subtle forms.\"\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14.5 \u2022 Employment Discrimination 345\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat was the sex-discrimination case against Walmart?\nIn one of the largest class-action sex-discrimination cases in U.S. history, 1.2 million female employees of Walmart\nclaimed that the company engaged in wage and promotion discrimination. In 2011, the Supreme Court threw out\nthe case on the grounds that the group was too large and too diverse to consider the case a class action suit.\nLawyers for the women regrouped and were subsequently suing in smaller groups. Part of the difficulty for the\nfemale employees is that the court said that local managers made pay and promotion decisions that were not\nnecessarily the company's policies as a whole. Consequently, female Walmart employees in Texas argued that their\nnew suit would challenge the management of a \u201cdiscrete group of regional district and store managers.\u201d They\nclaimed that these managers made biased pay and promotion decisions. However, in 2013, a federal district court\nrejected a smaller California class action suit against the company.\nOn other issues, Walmart made the news again in 2013 when the National Labor Relations Board found Walmart\nguilty of illegally penalizing and firing workers who took part in labor protests and strikes. Walmart paid $11.7\nmillion in back wages and compensation damages to women in Kentucky who were denied jobs due to their sex.\nAnd in 2020, a sex-based hiring discrimination lawsuit was filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission (EEOC), in which the EEOC alleged that Walmart conducted a physical ability test (known as the PAT) as\na requirement for applicants to be hired as order fillers at Walmart\u2019s grocery distribution centers nationwide, and\nthat the PAT disproportionately excluded female applicants from jobs as grocery order fillers. In September 2020,\nWalmart and the EEOC agreed to a consent decree, which requires Walmart to cease all physical ability testing that\nhad been used for purposes of hiring grocery distribution center order fillers. The decree also required Walmart to\npay $20 million into a settlement fund to pay lost wages to women across the country who were denied grocery\norder filler positions because of the testing.\nInvestigating the Female/Male Earnings Gap\nAs a result of changes in law and culture, women began to enter the paid workforce in substantial numbers in\nthe mid- to late-twentieth century. As of February 2022, 56.0% of women aged 20 and over held jobs, while\n67.6% of men aged 20 and over did. Moreover, along with entering the workforce, women began to ratchet up\ntheir education levels. In 1971, 44% of undergraduate college degrees went to women. As of the 2018\u201319\nacademic year, women earned 57% of bachelor\u2019s degrees. In 1970, women received 5.4% of the degrees from\nlaw schools and 8.4% of the degrees from medical schools. By 2017, women were receiving just over 50% of\nthe law degrees, and by 2019, 48% of the medical degrees. There are now slightly more women than men in\nboth law schools and medical schools. These gains in education and experience have reduced the female/male\nwage gap over time. However, concerns remain about the extent to which women have not yet assumed a\nsubstantial share of the positions at the top of the largest companies or in the U.S. Congress.\nThere are factors that can lower women\u2019s average wages. Women are likely to bear a disproportionately large\nshare of household responsibilities. A mother of young children is more likely to drop out of the labor force for\nseveral years or work on a reduced schedule than is the father. As a result, women in their 30s and 40s are\nlikely, on average, to have less job experience than men. In the United States, childless women with the same\neducation and experience levels as men are typically paid comparably. However, women with families and\nchildren are typically paid about 7% to 14% less than other women of similar education and work experience.\nMeanwhile, married men earn about 10% to 15% more than single men with comparable education and work\nexperience. This circumstance or practice is often referred to as the \"motherhood penalty\" and the\n\"fatherhood bonus.\"\nAnother aspect of the gender pay gap relates to work that isn\u2019t actually paid, such as household chores, caring\nfor children and other family members, and cooking. Studies have found that globally and within the United\nStates, women undertake far more of this work than do men; even women who work full time and/or bring in 346 14 \u2022 Labor Markets and Income\nthe majority of family income take on more of this unpaid work than the men in their households.\nEconomists study many aspects of sex- and gender-based earnings gaps, often revealing unexpected causes\nand impacts. For example, economists Jessica Pan, Jonathan Guryan, and Kerwin Kofi Charles analyzed\ndecades of sociological and employment data and uncovered that the amount of sexism in the U.S. state where\na woman was born is an indicator of the woman's earnings throughout her life, even if she moves away from\nher home state. In other words, women born in states with more pronounced sexist attitudes earn less, no\nmatter where they live later on. Other economists showed that from 1950\u20132000, as women's representation\nincreased in the workforce, jobs that became occupied by women experienced wage reductions relative to jobs\nbeing done by men\u2014an outcome often referred to as \"devaluation.\" The value of this research and similar\ninvestigations comes from the deeper understanding of the origins of the earnings gap, so that workers,\nemployers, and governments can take steps to address them.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(https://openstax.org/l/numberswomen)to read more about the persistently low numbers of\nwomen in executive roles in business and in the U.S. Congress.\nInvestigating the Earnings Gap Related to Race and Ethnicity\nBlack people experienced blatant labor market discrimination during much of the twentieth century. Until the\npassage of theCivil Rights Act of 1964, it was legal in many states to refuse to hire a Black worker, regardless of\nthe credentials or experience of that worker. Moreover, Black people were often denied access to educational\nopportunities, which in turn meant that they had lower levels of qualifications for many jobs. At least one\neconomic study has shown that the 1964 law is partially responsible for the narrowing of the gap in\nBlack\u2013White earnings in the late 1960s and into the 1970s. For example, the ratio of total earnings of Black\nmale workers to White male workers rose from 62% in 1964 to 75.3% in 2013, according to the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics.\nHowever, the earnings gap between Black and White workers has not changed as much as the earnings gap\nbetween men and women has in the last half century. The remaining racial gap seems related both to\ncontinuing differences in education levels and to the presence of discrimination.Table 14.9shows that the\npercentage of Black people who complete a four-year college degree remains substantially lower than the\npercentage of White people who complete college. According to the U.S. Census, both White and Black people\nhave higher levels of educational attainment than Hispanic people and lower levels than Asian people. The\nlower average levels of education for Black workers surely explain part of the earnings gap. In fact, Black\nwomen who have the same levels of education and experience as White women receive, on average, about the\nsame level of pay. One study shows that White and Black college graduates have identical salaries immediately\nafter college; however, the racial wage gap widens over time, an outcome that suggests the possibility of\ncontinuing discrimination. Other researchers conducted a field experiment by responding to job\nadvertisements with fictitious resumes using names that were either commonly associated with Black/African\nAmerican people or names commonly associated with White people; they found that the White-associated\nnames received 50 percent more callbacks for interviews. This is suggestive of discrimination in job\nopportunities. Further, as the following Clear It Up feature explains, there is evidence to support that\ndiscrimination in the housing market is connected to employment discrimination.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14.5 \u2022 Employment Discrimination 347\nWhite Hispanic Black Asian\nCompleted four years of high school or more 93.8% 73.0% 87.2% 91.0%\nCompleted four years of college or more 37.6% 16.8% 23.7% 54.7%\nTABLE14.9Educational Attainment by Race and Ethnicity for Individuals Aged 18\nand Above in 2019(Source: https://www.census.gov/content/census/en/data/\ntables/2019/demo/educational-attainment/cps-detailed-tables.html)\nCLEAR IT UP\nHow is discrimination in the housing market connected to employment discrimination?\nA recent study by the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) department found that realtors showed Black\nhomebuyers 18 percent fewer homes compared to White homebuyers. Realtors showed Asian homebuyers 19\npercent fewer properties. Additionally, Hispanic people experience more discrimination in renting apartments and\nundergo stiffer credit checks than White renters. In a 2012 study by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment and the nonprofit Urban Institute, Hispanic testers who contacted agents about advertised rental units\nreceived information about 12 percent fewer units available and were shown seven percent fewer units than White\nrenters. The $9 million study, based on research in 28 metropolitan areas, concluded that blatant \u201cdoor slamming\u201d\nforms of discrimination are on the decline but that the discrimination that does exist is harder to detect, and as a\nresult, more difficult to remedy. According to theChicago Tribune, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan, who served in his\nrole from 2009-2014, told reporters, \u201cJust because it\u2019s taken on a hidden form doesn\u2019t make it any less harmful.\nYou might not be able to move into that community with the good schools.\u201d\nThese practices are viewed as a continuation ofredlining, which is the intentional and discriminatory withholding of\nservices or products based on race or other factors. Redlining was practiced extensively by banks and other lenders\nwho refused to issue mortgages or other loans to people from racial or ethnic minorities living in neighborhoods that\nwere deemed \"hazardous\" to investment, even though the same lenders would issue loans to White people with\nsimilar economic status. Redlining has lasting effects today, demonstrated by significant divides in educational and\nfinancial opportunity in certain neighborhoods or cities.\nThe lower levels of education for Black workers can also be a result of discrimination\u2014although it may be pre-labor\nmarket discrimination, rather than direct discrimination by employers in the labor market. For example, if redlining\nand other discrimination in housing markets causes Black families to live clustered together in certain\nneighborhoods and those areas have under-resourced schools, then those children will continue to have lower\neducational attainment then their White counterparts and, consequently, not be able to obtain the higher paying\njobs that require higher levels of education. Another element to consider is that in the past, when Black people were\neffectively barred from many high-paying jobs, obtaining additional education could have seemed not to be worth\nthe investment, because the educational degrees would not pay off. While the government has legally abolished\ndiscriminatory labor practices, structures and systems take a very long time to eradicate.\nCompetitive Markets and Discrimination\nGary Becker(1930\u20132014), who won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1992, was one of the first to analyze\ndiscrimination in economic terms. Becker pointed out that while competitive markets can allow some\nemployers to practice discrimination, it can also provide profit-seeking firms with incentives not to\ndiscriminate. Given these incentives, Becker explored the question of why discrimination persists.\nIf a business is located in an area with a large minority population and refuses to sell to minorities, it will cut\ninto its own profits. If some businesses run by bigoted employers refuse to pay women and/or minorities a 348 14 \u2022 Labor Markets and Income\nwage based on their productivity, then other profit-seeking employers can hire these workers. In acompetitive\nmarket, if the business owners care more about the color of money than about the color of skin, they will have\nan incentive to make buying, selling, hiring, and promotion decisions strictly based on economic factors.\nDo not underestimate the power of markets to offer at least a degree of freedom to oppressed groups. In many\ncountries, cohesive minority population groups like Jewish people and emigrant Chinese people have\nmanaged to carve out a space for themselves through their economic activities, despite legal and social\ndiscrimination against them. Many immigrants, including those who come to the United States, have taken\nadvantage of economic freedom to make new lives for themselves. However, history teaches that market forces\nalone are unlikely to eliminate discrimination. After all, discrimination against African Americans persisted in\nthe market-oriented U.S. economy during the century between the ratification of the 13th Amendment, which\nabolished slavery in 1865, and the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\u2014and has continued since then, too.\nWhy does discrimination persist in competitive markets? Gary Becker sought to explain this persistence.\nDiscriminatory impulses can emerge at a number of levels: among managers, among workers, and among\ncustomers. Consider the situation of a store owner or manager who is not personally prejudiced, but who has\nmany customers who are prejudiced. If that manager treats all groups fairly, the manager may find it drives\naway prejudiced customers. In such a situation, a policy of nondiscrimination could reduce the firm\u2019s profits.\nAfter all, a business firm is part of society, and a firm that does not follow the societal norms is likely to suffer.\nAs economist William A. Darity Jr. points out, however, the \"prejudiced customer\" rationale falls apart when\nconsidering the many jobs that have no customer contact. Darity examined several theories regarding the\npersistence of employment discrimination, including rationales regarding group membership and employers'\nlack of information about candidates of other genders or races. Darity also directly studies and interprets\nothers' work on discrimination in other countries, such as wage disparities between Sikh and Hindu men in\nIndia. Darity concludes that the competitive forces of the market have not been enough to overcome\nemployment and wage discrimination, and, on their own, are unlikely to end such discrimination in the future.\nLINK IT UP\nRead thisarticle(http://openstax.org/l/censusincome)to learn more about wage discrimination.\nPublic Policies to Reduce Discrimination\nA first public policy step against discrimination in the labor market is to make it illegal. For example, theEqual\nPay Act of 1963said that employers must pay men and women who do equal work the same. The Civil Rights\nAct of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The\nAge Discrimination in Employment Actof 1967 prohibited discrimination on the basis of age against\nindividuals who are 40 years of age or older. TheCivil Rights Act of 1991provides monetary damages in cases\nof intentional employment discrimination. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 was aimed at\nprohibiting discrimination against people in the workplace who are planning pregnancy, are pregnant, or are\nreturning after pregnancy. Passing a law, however, is only part of the answer, since discrimination by\nprejudiced employers may be less important than broader social patterns and systems.\nThe 1964 Civil Rights Act created an important government organization, the Equal Employment Opportunity\nCommission, to investigate employment discrimination and protect workers who filed complaints against\nemployers. Economist Phyllis Ann Wallace, who had previously worked for U.S. intelligence services, was\nappointed as the commission's chief of technical studies. In this role she collected and organized a massive\namount of public and private sector data, as well as mentored and directed economists and other analysts in\ntheir investigations.\nThese laws against discrimination have reduced the gender wage gap. A 2007 Department of Labor study\ncompared salaries of men and women who have similar educational achievement, work experience, and\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14.5 \u2022 Employment Discrimination 349\noccupation and found that the gender wage gap is only 5%.\nIn the case of the earnings gap between Black people and White people (and also between Hispanic people and\nWhite people), probably the single largest step that could be taken at this point in U.S. history to close the\nearnings gap would be to reduce the gap in educational attainment. Part of the answer to this issue involves\nfinding ways to improve the performance of schools, which is a highly controversial topic in itself. In addition,\nthe education gap is unlikely to close unless Black and Hispanic families and peer groups strengthen their\nculture of support for educational attainment.\nAffirmative actionis the name given to active efforts by government or businesses that give special rights to\nminorities in hiring and promotion to make up for past discrimination. Affirmative action, in its limited and\nnot especially controversial form, means making an effort to reach out to a broader range of minority\ncandidates for jobs. In its more aggressive and controversial form, affirmative action required government and\ncompanies to hire a specific number or percentage of minority employees. However, the U.S. Supreme Court\nhas ruled against state affirmative action laws. Today, the government applies affirmative action policies only\nto federal contractors who have lost a discrimination lawsuit. The federalEqual Employment Opportunity\nCommission (EEOC)enforces this type of redress.\nAn Increasingly Diverse Workforce\nRacial and ethnic diversity is on the rise in the U.S. population and workforce. AsFigure 14.16shows, while the\nWhite Americans comprised 78% of the population in 2012, the U.S. Bureau of the Census projects that Whites\nwill comprise 69% of the U.S. population by 2060. Forecasters predict that the proportion of U.S. citizens who\nare of Hispanic background to rise substantially. Moreover, in addition to expected changes in the population,\nworkforce diversity is increasing as the women who entered the workforce in the 1970s and 1980s are now\nmoving up the promotion ladders within their organizations.\nFIGURE14.16Projected Changes in America\u2019s Racial and Ethnic DiversityThis figure shows projected changes in\nthe ethnic makeup of the U.S. population by 2060.

Source: US Department of Commerce\nRegarding the future, optimists argue that the growing proportions of minority workers will break down\nremaining discriminatory barriers. The economy will benefit as an increasing proportion of workers from\ntraditionally disadvantaged groups have a greater opportunity to fulfill their potential. Pessimists worry that\nthe social tensions between different genders and between ethnic groups will rise and that workers will be less\nproductive as a result. Anti-discrimination policy, at its best, seeks to help society move toward the more\noptimistic outcome.\nThe FRED database includes data on foreign and native born civilianpopulation(https://openstax.org/l/104) 350 14 \u2022 Labor Markets and Income\nandlabor force(https://openstax.org/l/32442).\n14.6Immigration\nMost Americans would be outraged if a law prevented them from moving to another city or another state.\nHowever, when the conversation turns to crossing national borders and is about other people arriving in the\nUnited States, laws preventing such movement often seem more reasonable. Some of the tensions over\nimmigration stem from worries over how it might affect a country\u2019s culture, including differences in language,\nand patterns of family, authority, or gender relationships. Economics does not have much to say about such\ncultural issues. Some of the worries about immigration do, however, have to do with its effects on wages and\nincome levels, and how it affects government taxes and spending. On those topics, economists have insights\nand research to offer.\nHistorical Patterns of Immigration\nSupporters and opponents of immigration look at the same data and see different patterns. Those who express\nconcern about immigration levels to the United States point to graphics likeFigure 14.17which shows total\ninflows ofimmigrantsdecade by decade through the twentieth and into the twenty-first century. Clearly, the\nlevel of immigration has been high and rising in recent years, reaching and exceeding the towering levels of\nthe early twentieth century. However, those who are less worried about immigration point out that the high\nimmigration levels of the early twentieth century happened when total population was much lower. Since the\nU.S. population roughly tripled during the twentieth century, the seemingly high levels in immigration in the\n1990s and 2000s look relatively smaller when they are divided by the population.\nFIGURE14.17Immigration Since 1900The number of immigrants in each decade declined between 1900 and the\n1940s, rose sharply through 2009 and started to decline from 2010 to the present. (Source: U.S. Census)\nFrom where have the immigrants come? Immigrants from Europe were more than 90% of the total in the first\ndecade of the twentieth century, but less than 20% of the total by the end of the century. By the 2000s, about\nhalf of U.S. immigration came from the rest of the Americas, especially Mexico, and about a quarter came from\nvarious countries in Asia.\nEconomic Effects of Immigration\nA surge of immigration can affect the economy in a number of different ways. In this section, we will consider\nhow immigrants might benefit the rest of the economy, how they might affect wage levels, and how they might\naffect government spending at the federal and local level.\nTo understand the economic consequences of immigration, consider the following scenario. Imagine that the\nimmigrants entering the United States matched the existing U.S. population in age range, education, skill\nlevels, family size, and occupations. How would immigration of this type affect the rest of the U.S. economy?\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14.6 \u2022 Immigration 351\nImmigrants themselves would be much better off, because their standard of living would be higher in the\nUnited States. Immigrants would contribute to both increased production and increased consumption. Given\nenough time for adjustment, the range of jobs performed, income earned, taxes paid, and public services\nneeded would not be much affected by this kind of immigration. It would be as if the population simply\nincreased a little.\nNow, consider the reality of recent immigration to the United States. Immigrants are not identical to the rest of\nthe U.S. population. About one-third of immigrants over the age of 25 lack a high school diploma. As a result,\nmany of the recent immigrants end up in jobs like restaurant and hotel work, lawn care, and janitorial work.\nThis kind of immigration represents a shift to the right in the supply of unskilled labor for a number of jobs,\nwhich will lead to lower wages for these jobs. The middle- and upper-income households that purchase the\nservices of these unskilled workers will benefit from these lower wages. However, low-skilled U.S. workers who\nmust compete with low-skilled immigrants for jobs will tend to be negatively impacted by immigration.\nThe difficult policy questions about immigration are not so much about the overall gains to the rest of the\neconomy, which seem to be real but small in the context of the U.S. economy, as they are about the disruptive\neffects of immigration in specific labor markets. One disruptive effect, as we noted, is that immigration\nweighted toward low-skill workers tends to reduce wages for domestic low-skill workers. A study byMichael S.\nClunefound that for each 10% rise in the number of employed immigrants with no more than a high school\ndiploma in the labor market, high school students reduced their annual number of hours worked by 3%. The\neffects on wages of low-skill workers are not large\u2014perhaps in the range of decline of about 1%. These effects\nare likely kept low, in part, because of the legal floor of federal and state minimum wage laws. In addition,\nimmigrants are also thought to contribute to increased demand for local goods and services which can\nstimulate the local low skilled labor market. It is also possible that employers, in the face of abundant low-skill\nworkers, may choose production processes which are more labor intensive than otherwise would have been.\nThese various factors would explain the small negative wage effect that the native low-skill workers observed\nas a result of immigration.\nAnother potential disruptive effect is the impact on state and local government budgets. Many of the costs\nimposed by immigrants are costs that arise in state-run programs, like the cost of public schooling and of\nwelfare benefits. However, many of the taxes that immigrants pay are federal taxes like income taxes and\nSocial Security taxes. Many immigrants do not own property (such as homes and cars), so they do not pay\nproperty taxes, which are one of the main sources of state and local tax revenue. However, they do pay sales\ntaxes, which are state and local, and the landlords of property they rent pay property taxes. According to the\nnonprofit Rand Corporation, the effects of immigration on taxes are generally positive at the federal level, but\nthey are negative at the state and local levels in places where there are many low-skilled immigrants.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/nber)to obtain more context regarding immigration.\nProposals for Immigration Reform\nThe Congressional Jordan Commission of the 1990s proposed reducing overall levels of immigration and\nrefocusing U.S. immigration policy to give priority to immigrants with higher skill levels. In the labor market,\nfocusing on high-skilled immigrants would help prevent any negative effects on low-skilled workers' wages.\nFor government budgets, higher-skilled workers find jobs more quickly, earn higher wages, and pay more in\ntaxes. Several other immigration-friendly countries, notably Canada and Australia, have immigration systems\nwhere those with high levels of education or job skills have a much better chance of obtaining permission to\nimmigrate. For the United States, high tech companies regularly ask for a more lenient immigration policy to\nadmit a greater quantity of highly skilled workers under the H1B visa program.\nThe Obama Administration proposed the so-called \u201cDREAM Act\u201d legislation, which would have offered a path 352 14 \u2022 Labor Markets and Income\nto citizenship for those classified as illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States before the age of\n16. Despite bipartisan support, the legislation failed to pass at the federal level. However, some state\nlegislatures, such as California, have passed their own Dream Acts.\nBetween its plans for a border wall, increased deportation of undocumented immigrants, and even reductions\nin the number of highly skilled legal H1B immigrants, the Trump Administration had a much less positive\napproach to immigration. Most economists, whether conservative or liberal, believe that while immigration\nharms some domestic workers, the benefits to the nation exceed the costs. President Biden has been\nconsiderably more positive about immigration than his predecessor. However, given the presence of\nconsiderable disagreement within the overall population about the desirability of immigration, it is unlikely\nthat any significant immigration reform will take place in the near future.\nThe FRED database includes data on the national origin of the civilian population(https://fred.stlouisfed.org/\ncategories/104)(https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/104)and labor force(https://fred.stlouisfed.org/\ncategories/32442)(https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/32442).\nBRING IT HOME\nThe Increasing Value of a College Degree\nThe cost of college has increased dramatically in recent decades, causing many college students to take student\nloans to afford it. Despite this, the value of a college degree has never been higher. How can we explain this?\nWe can estimate the value of a bachelor\u2019s degree as the difference in lifetime earnings between the average holder\nof a bachelor\u2019s degree and the average high school graduate. According to a 2021 report from the Georgetown\nUniversity Center on Education and the Workforce, adults with a bachelor\u2019s degree earn an average of $2.8 million\nduring their careers, $1.2 million more than the median for workers with a high school diploma. College graduates\nalso have a significantly lower unemployment rate than those with lower educational attainments.\nWhile a college degree holder\u2019s wages have increased somewhat, the major reason for the increase in value of a\nbachelor\u2019s degree has been the plummeting value of a high school diploma. In the twenty-first century, the majority\nof jobs require at least some post-secondary education. This includes manufacturing jobs that in the past would\nhave afforded workers a middle class income with only a high school diploma. Those jobs are increasingly scarce.\nThis phenomenon has also no doubt contributed to the increasing inequality of income that we observe in the U.S.\ntoday. We will discuss that topic next, in Chapter 15.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14 \u2022 Key Terms 353\nKey Terms\naffirmative action active efforts by government or businesses that give special rights to minorities in hiring,\npromotion, or access to education to make up for past discrimination\nbilateral monopoly a labor market with a monopsony on the demand side and a union on the supply side\ncollective bargainingnegotiations between unions and a firm or firms\ndiscrimination actions based on the belief that members of a certain group or groups are in some way inferior\nsolely because of a factor such as race, gender, or religion\nfirst rule of labor markets an employer will never pay a worker more than the value of the worker's marginal\nproductivity to the firm\nmonopsony a labor market where there is only one employer\nperfectly competitive labor market a labor market where neither suppliers of labor nor demanders of labor\nhave any market power; thus, an employer can hire all the workers they would like at the going market\nwage\nKey Concepts and Summary\n14.1The Theory of Labor Markets\nA firm demands labor because of the value of the labor\u2019s marginal productivity. For a firm operating in a\nperfectly competitive output market, this will be the value of the marginal product, which we define as the\nmarginal product of labor multiplied by the firm\u2019s output price. For a firm which is not perfectly competitive,\nthe appropriate concept is the marginal revenue product, which we define as the marginal product of labor\nmultiplied by the firm\u2019s marginal revenue. Profit maximizing firms employ labor up to the point where the\nmarket wage is equal to the firm\u2019s demand for labor. In a competitive labor market, we determine market wage\nthrough the interaction between the market supply and market demand for labor.\n14.2Wages and Employment in an Imperfectly Competitive Labor Market\nA monopsony is the sole employer in a labor market. The monopsony can pay any wage it chooses, subject to\nthe market supply of labor. This means that if the monopsony offers too low a wage, they may not find enough\nworkers willing to work for them. Since to obtain more workers, they must offer a higher wage, the marginal\ncost of additional labor is greater than the wage. To maximize profits, a monopsonist will hire workers up to the\npoint where the marginal cost of labor equals their labor demand. This results in a lower level of employment\nthan a competitive labor market would provide, but also a lower equilibrium wage.\n14.3Market Power on the Supply Side of Labor Markets: Unions\nA labor union is an organization of workers that negotiates as a group with employers over compensation and\nwork conditions. Union workers in the United States are paid more on average than other workers with\ncomparable education and experience. Thus, either union workers must be more productive to match this\nhigher pay or the higher pay will lead employers to find ways of hiring fewer union workers than they\notherwise would. American union membership has been falling for decades. Some possible reasons include\nthe shift of jobs to service industries; greater competition from globalization; the passage of worker-friendly\nlegislation; and U.S. laws that are less favorable to organizing unions.\n14.4Bilateral Monopoly\nA bilateral monopoly is a labor market with a union on the supply side and a monopsony on the demand side.\nSince both sides have monopoly power, the equilibrium level of employment will be lower than that for a\ncompetitive labor market, but the equilibrium wage could be higher or lower depending on which side\nnegotiates better. The union favors a higher wage, while the monopsony favors a lower wage, but the outcome\nis indeterminate in the model. 354 14 \u2022 Self-Check Questions\n14.5Employment Discrimination\nDiscrimination occurs in a labor market when employers pay workers with the same economic characteristics,\nsuch as education,experience, and skill, are paid different amounts because of race, gender, religion, age, or\ndisability status. In the United States, female workers on average earn less than male workers, and Black\nworkers on average earn less than White workers. There is controversy over to which discrimination\ndifferences in factors like education and job experience can explain these earnings gaps. Free markets can\nallow discrimination to occur, but the threat of a loss of sales or a loss of productive workers can also create\nincentives for a firm not to discriminate. A range of public policies can be used to reduce earnings gaps\nbetween men and women or between White and other racial/ethnic groups: requiring equal pay for equal\nwork, and attaining more equal educational outcomes.\n14.6Immigration\nThe recent level of U.S. immigration is at a historically high level if we measure it in absolute numbers, but not\nif we measure it as a share of population. The overall gains to the U.S. economy from immigration are real but\nrelatively small. However, immigration also causes effects like slightly lower wages for low-skill workers and\nbudget problems for certain state and local governments.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

Calling their protest \u201cOccupy Wall Street,\u201d they\nargued that the concentration of wealth among the richest 1% in the United States was both economically\nunsustainable and inequitable, and needed to be changed. The protest then spread to other major cities, and the\nOccupy movement was born.\nWhy were people so upset? How much wealth is concentrated among the top 1% in our society? How did they\nacquire so much wealth? These are very real, very important questions in the United States now, and this chapter on\npoverty and economic inequality will help us address the causes behind this sentiment. 360 15 \u2022 Poverty and Economic Inequality\nThe labor markets that determine the pay that workers receive do not take into account how much income a\nfamily needs for food, shelter, clothing, and health care. Market forces do not worry about what happens to\nfamilies when a major local employer goes out of business. Market forces do not take time to contemplate\nwhether those who are earning higher incomes should pay an even higher share of taxes.\nHowever, labor markets do create considerable income inequalities. In 2020, the median American household\nincome was $67,521 (the median is the level where half of all families had more than that level and half had\nless). For family households, the median was $86,372; for non-family households, it was $40,464. The Census\nBureau also reported that in 2020, there were 37.2 million people living in poverty, representing 11.4% of the\npopulation. Think about a family of three\u2014perhaps a single mother with two children\u2014attempting to pay for\nthe basics of life on perhaps $17,916 per year. After paying for rent, healthcare, clothing, and transportation,\nsuch a family might have $6,000 to spend on food. Spread over 365 days, the food budget for the entire family\nwould be about $17 per day. To put this in perspective, most cities have restaurants where $17 will buy you an\nappetizer for one.\nThis chapter explores how the U.S. government defines poverty, the balance between assisting the poor\nwithout discouraging work, and how federal antipoverty programs work. It also discusses income\ninequality\u2014how economists measure inequality, why inequality has changed in recent decades, the range of\npossible government policies to reduce inequality, and the danger of a tradeoff that too great a reduction in\ninequality may reduce incentives for producing output.\n15.1Drawing the Poverty Line\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain economic inequality and how the poverty line is determined\n\u2022 Analyze the U.S. poverty rate over time, noting its prevalence among different groups of citizens\nComparisons of high and low incomes raise two different issues: economic inequality andpoverty. Poverty is\nmeasured by the number of people who fall below a certain level of income\u2014called thepoverty line\u2014that\ndefines the income one needs for a basic standard of living.Incomeinequalitycompares the share of the total\nincome (or wealth) in society that different groups receive. For example, one of numerous ways to look at\nincome inequality is to compare the share of income that the top 10% receive to the share of income that the\nbottom 10% receive.\nIn the United States, the official definition of the poverty line traces back to a single person:Mollie Orshansky.\nIn 1963, Orshansky, who was working for the Social Security Administration, published an article called\n\u201cChildren of the Poor\u201d in a highly useful and dry-as-dust publication called theSocial Security Bulletin.\nOrshansky\u2019s idea was to define a poverty line based on the cost of a healthy diet.\nHer previous job had been at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, where she had worked in an agency called the\nBureau of Home Economics and Human Nutrition. One task of this bureau had been to calculate how much it\nwould cost to feed a nutritionally adequate diet to a family. Orshansky found that the average family spent one-\nthird of its income on food. She then proposed that the poverty line be the amount one requires to buy a\nnutritionally adequate diet, given the size of the family, multiplied by three.\nThe current U.S. poverty line is essentially the same as the Orshansky poverty line, although the government\nadjusts the dollar amounts to represent the same buying power over time. The U.S. poverty line in 2021 ranged\nfrom $12,880 for a single individual to $26,500 for a household of four people.\nFigure 15.2shows the U.S.poverty rateover time; that is, the percentage of the population below the poverty\nline in any given year. The poverty rate declined through the 1960s, rose in the early 1980s and early 1990s,\nbut seems to have been slightly lower since the mid-1990s. However, in no year in the last six decades has the\npoverty rate been less than 10.5% of the U.S. population\u2014that is, at best almost one American in nine is below\nAccess for free at openstax.org 15.1 \u2022 Drawing the Poverty Line 361\nthe poverty line. In recent years, the poverty rate peaked at 15.1% in 2010, before dropping to 10.5% in 2019.\nTable 15.1compares poverty rates for different groups in 2011. As you will see when we delve further into\nthese numbers, poverty rates are relatively low for White people, for the elderly, for the well-educated, and for\nmale-headed households. Poverty rates for females, Hispanic people, and African Americans are much higher\nthan for White people. While Hispanic people and African Americans have a higher percentage of individuals\nliving in poverty than others, most people in the United States living below the poverty line are White people.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/povertyprogram)for more information on U.S. poverty.\nFIGURE15.2The U.S. Poverty Rate since 1960The poverty rate fell dramatically during the 1960s, rose in the\nearly 1980s and early 1990s, and, after declining in the 1990s through mid-2000s, rose to 15.1% in 2020, which is\nclose to the 1960 levels. Between 2010 and 2019, the poverty rate declined to 10.5%, before rising to 11.4% in\n2020 due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

In a vast country like the United States, should\nthere be a national poverty line? After all, according to the Federal Register, the median household income for\na family of four was $109,113 in New Jersey and $59,701 in Mississippi in 2017, and prices of some basic\ngoods like housing are quite different between states. The poverty line is based on cash income, which means\nit does not account for government programs that provide non-cash assistance such asMedicaid(health care\nfor low-income individuals and families) and food aid. Also, low-income families can qualify for federal\nhousing assistance. (We will discuss these and other government aid programs in detail later in this chapter.)\nShould the government adjust the poverty line to account for the value of such programs? Many economists\nand policymakers wonder whether we should rethink the concept of what poverty means in the twenty-first\ncentury. The following Clear It Up feature explains the poverty lines set by the World Bank for low-income\ncountries around the world.\nCLEAR IT UP\nHow do economists measure poverty in low-income countries?\nThe World Bank sets two poverty lines for low-income countries around the world. One poverty line is set at an\nincome of $1.90/day per person. The other is at $3.20/day. By comparison, the U.S. 2015 poverty line of $20,090\nannually for a family of three works out to $18.35 per person per day.\nClearly, many people around the world are far poorer than Americans, asTable 15.2shows. China and India both\nhave more than a billion people; Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa; and Egypt is the most populous\ncountry in the Middle East. In all four of those countries, in the mid-2000s, a substantial share of the population\nsubsisted on less than $2/day. About half the world lives on less than $2.50 a day, and 80 percent of the world lives\non less than $10 per day. (Of course, the cost of food, clothing, and shelter in those countries can be very different\nfrom those costs in the United States, so the $2 and $2.50 figures may mean greater purchasing power than they\nwould in the United States.)\nPercentage of Population with Income Less Percentage of Population with Income Less\nCountry Year\nThan $1.90/Day/Person Than $3.20/Day/Person\nBrazil 2019 4.6% 9.1%\nChina 2017 0.5% 5.4%\nEgypt 2017 3.8% 28.9%\nIndia 2011 22.5% 61.7%\nMexico 2018 1.7% 6.5%\nNigeria 2018 39.1% 71.0%\nTABLE15.2Poverty Lines for Low-Income Countries, mid-2000s(Source: https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-\ndevelopment-indicators/themes/poverty-and-inequality.html)\nAny poverty line will be somewhat arbitrary, and it is useful to have a poverty line whose basic definition does\nnot change much over time. If Congress voted every few years to redefine poverty, then it would be difficult to\ncompare rates over time. After all, would a lower poverty rate change the definition, or is it the case that people\nwere actually better off? Government statisticians at the U.S. Census Bureau have ongoing research programs\nto address questions like these.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 15.2 \u2022 The Poverty Trap 363\n15.2The Poverty Trap\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain the poverty trap, noting how government programs impact it\n\u2022 Identify potential issues in government programs that seek to reduce poverty\n\u2022 Calculate a budget constraint line that represents the poverty trap\nCan you give people too much help, or the wrong kind of help? When people are provided with food, shelter,\nhealthcare, income, and other necessities, assistance may reduce their incentive to work, particularly if their\nwork is likely to offer low wages and reduce government assistance. Consider a program to fight poverty that\nworks in this reasonable-sounding manner: the government provides assistance to the those who need it, but\nas the recipients earn income to support themselves, the government reduces the level of assistance it\nprovides. With such a program, every time a person earns $100, they lose $100 in government support. As a\nresult, the person experiences no net gain for working. Economists call this problem thepoverty trap.\nConsider the situation a single-parent family faces.Figure 15.3illustrates a single mother (earning $8 an hour)\nwith two children. First, consider thelabor-leisure budget constraintthat this family faces in a situation\nwithout government assistance. On the horizontal axis is hours of leisure (or time spent with family\nresponsibilities) increasing in quantity from left to right. Also on the horizontal axis is the number of hours at\npaid work, going from zero hours on the right to the maximum of 2,500 hours on the left. On the vertical axis is\nthe amount of income per year rising from low to higher amounts of income. The budget constraint line shows\nthat at zero hours of leisure and 2,500 hours of work, the maximum amount of income is $20,000 ($8 \u00d7 2,500\nhours). At the other extreme of the budget constraint line, an individual would work zero hours, earn zero\nincome, but enjoy 2,500 hours of leisure. At point A on thebudget constraint line, by working 40 hours a week,\n50 weeks a year, the utility-maximizing choice is to work a total of 2,000 hours per year and earn $16,000.\nNow suppose that a government antipoverty program guarantees every family with a single mother and two\nchildren $18,000 in income. This is represented on the graph by a horizontal line at $18,000. With this\nprogram, each time the mother earns $1,000, the government will deduct $1,000 of its support.Table 15.3\nshows what will happen at each combination of work and government support.\nFIGURE15.3The Poverty Trap in ActionThe original choice is 500 hours of leisure, 2,000 hours of work at point A,\nand income of $16,000. With a guaranteed income of $18,000, this family would receive $18,000 whether it\nprovides zero hours of work or 2,000 hours of work. Only if the family provides, say, 2,300 hours of work does its\nincome rise above the guaranteed level of $18,000\u2014and even then, the marginal gain to income from working many\nhours is small. 364 15 \u2022 Poverty and Economic Inequality\nAmount Worked (hours) Total Earnings Government Support Total Income\n0 0 $18,000 $18,000\n500 $4,000 $14,000 $18,000\n1,000 $8,000 $10,000 $18,000\n1,500 $12,000 $6,000 $18,000\n2,000 $16,000 $2,000 $18,000\n2,500 $20,000 0 $20,000\nTABLE15.3Total Income at Various Combinations of Work and Support\nThe new budget line, with the antipoverty program in place, is the horizontal and heavy line that is flat at\n$18,000. If the mother does not work at all, she receives $18,000, all from the government. If she works full\ntime, giving up 40 hours per week with her children, she still ends up with $18,000 at the end of the year. Only\nif she works 2,300 hours in the year\u2014which is an average of 44 hours per week for 50 weeks a year\u2014does\nhousehold income rise to $18,400. Even in this case, all of her year\u2019s work means that household income rises\nby only $400 over the income she would receive if she did not work at all. She would need to work 50 hours a\nweek to reach $20,800.\nThe poverty trap is even stronger than this simplified example shows, because a working mother will have\nextra expenses like clothing, transportation, and child care that a nonworking mother will not face, making the\neconomic gains from working even smaller. Moreover, those who do not work fail to build up job experience\nand contacts, which makes working in the future even less likely.\nTo reduce the poverty trap the government could design an antipoverty program so that, instead of reducing\ngovernment payments by $1 for every $1 earned, the government would reduce payments by some smaller\namount instead. Imposing requirements for work as a condition of receiving benefits and setting a time limit\non benefits can also reduce the harshness of the poverty trap.\nFigure 15.4illustrates a government program that guarantees $18,000 in income, even for those who do not\nwork at all, but then reduces this amount by 50 cents for each $1 earned. The new, higher budget line inFigure\n15.4shows that, with this program, additional hours of work will bring some economic gain. Because of the\nreduction in government income when an individual works, an individual earning $8.00 will really net only\n$4.00 per hour. The vertical intercept of this higher budget constraint line is at $28,000 ($18,000 + 2,500 hours\n\u00d7 $4.00 = $28,000). The horizontal intercept is at the point on the graph where $18,000 and 2500 hours of\nleisure is set.Table 15.4shows the total income differences with various choices of labor and leisure.\nHowever, this type of program raises other issues. First, even if it does not eliminate the incentive to work by\nreducing government payments by $1 for every $1 earned, enacting such a program may still reduce the\nincentive to work. At least some people who would be working 2,000 hours each year without this program\nmight decide to work fewer hours but still end up with more income\u2014that is, their choice on the new budget\nline would be like S, above and to the right of the original choice P. Of course, others may choose a point like R,\nwhich involves the same amount of work as P, or even a point to the left of R that involves more work.\nThe second major issue is that when the government phases out its support payments more slowly, the\nantipoverty program costs more money. Still, it may be preferable in the long run to spend more money on a\nprogram that retains a greater incentive to work, rather than spending less money on a program that nearly\neliminates any gains from working.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 15.2 \u2022 The Poverty Trap 365\nFIGURE15.4Loosening the Poverty Trap: Reducing Government Assistance by 50 Cents for Every $1 EarnedOn\nthe original labor-leisure opportunity set, the lower, downward-sloping budget set, the preferred choice P is 500\nhours of leisure and $16,000 of income. Then, the government created an antipoverty program that guarantees\n$18,000 in income even to those who work zero hours, shown by the hoizontal dashed line. In addition, every $1\nearned means phasing out 50 cents of benefits at $18,000. This program leads to the higher budget set, which the\ndiagram shows. The hope is that this program will provide incentives to work the same or more hours, despite\nreceiving income assistance. However, it is possible that the recipients will choose a point on the new budget set\nlike S, with less work, more leisure, and greater income, or a point like R, with the same work and greater income.\nAmount Worked (hours) Total Earnings Government Support Total Income\n0 0 $18,000 $18,000\n500 $4,000 $16,000 $20,000\n1,000 $8,000 $14,000 $22,000\n1,500 $12,000 $12,000 $24,000\n2,000 $16,000 $10,000 $26,000\n2,500 $20,000 $8,000 $28,000\nTABLE15.4The Labor-Leisure Tradeoff with Assistance Reduced by 50 Cents for\nEvery Dollar Earned\nThe next module will consider a variety of government support programs focused specifically on people\nexperiencing poverty, including welfare, SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), Medicaid, and\nthe earned income tax credit (EITC). Although these programs vary from state to state, it is generally a true\nstatement that in many states from the 1960s into the 1980s, if poor people worked, their level of income\nbarely rose\u2014or did not rise at all\u2014after factoring in the reduction in government support payments. The\nfollowing Work It Out feature shows how this happens. 366 15 \u2022 Poverty and Economic Inequality\n15.3The Safety Net\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Identify the antipoverty government programs that comprise the safety net\n\u2022 Explain the safety net programs' primary goals and how these programs have changed over time\n\u2022 Discuss the complexities of these safety net programs and why they can be controversial\nThe U.S. government has implemented a number of programs to assist those below the poverty line and those\nwho have incomes just above the poverty line. Such programs are called thesafety net, to recognize that they\noffer some protection for those who find themselves without jobs or income.\nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families\nFrom the Great Depression until 1996, the United States\u2019 most visible antipoverty program wasAid to Families\nwith Dependent Children (AFDC), which provided cash payments to mothers with children who were below the\npoverty line. Many just called this program \u201cwelfare.\u201d In 1996, Congress passed and President Bill Clinton\nsigned into law the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, more commonly called\nthe \u201cwelfare reform act.\u201d The new law replaced AFDC withTemporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/Clinton_speech)to watch a video of President Bill Clinton\u2019s Welfare\nReform speech.\nTANF brought several dramatic changes in how welfare operated. Under the old AFDC program, states set the\nlevel of welfare benefits that they would pay to people experiencing poverty, and the federal government\nguaranteed it would chip in some of the money as well. The federal government\u2019s welfare spending would rise\nor fall depending on the number of people in need, and on how each state set its own welfare contribution.\nUnder TANF, however, the federal government gives a fixed amount of money to each state. The state can then\nuse the money for almost any program with an antipoverty component: for example, the state might use the\nmoney to give funds to families with low income, or to reduce teenage pregnancy, or even to raise the high\nschool graduation rate. However, the federal government imposed two key requirements. First, if states are to\nkeep receiving the TANF grants, they must impose work requirements so that most of those receiving TANF\nbenefits are working (or attending school). Second, no one can receive TANF benefits with federal money for\nmore than a total of five years over their lifetime. The old AFDC program had no such work requirements or\ntime limits.\nTANF attempts to avoid the poverty trap by requiring that welfare recipients work and by limiting the length of\ntime they can receive benefits. In its first few years, the program was quite successful. The number of families\nreceiving payments in 1995, the last year of AFDC, was 4.8 million. November 2020, according to the\nCongressional Research Service, the number of families receiving payments under TANF was 1.0 million\u2014a\ndecline of nearly 80%.\nTANF benefits to poor families vary considerably across states. For example, again according to the\nCongressional Research Service, in July 2020 the highest monthly payment in New Hampshire to a single\nmother with one child was $862, while in Mississippi the highest monthly payment to that family was $146. In\npart, these payments reflect differences in states\u2019 cost of living. As reported by the Department of Health and\nHuman Services, in 1995 total spending on TANF was approximately $19 billion. Spending increased yearly\nthrough 2001, then it was roughly flat at approximately $26 billion until 2005, then it increased again through\n2010, where it peaked at nearly $35 billion. It then decreased again to around $30 billion in 2020. When you\ntake into account the effects of inflation, the decline is even greater. Moreover, there seemed little evidence that\nfamilies were suffering a reduced standard of living as a result of TANF\u2014although, on the other side, there was\nAccess for free at openstax.org 15.3 \u2022 The Safety Net 367\nnot much evidence that families had greatly improved their total levels of income, either.\nThe Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)\nTheearned income tax credit (EITC), first passed in 1975, is a method of assisting the working poor through\nthe tax system. The EITC is one of the largest assistance program for low-income groups, and as of December\n2021, about 25 million eligible workers and families received about $60 billion in EITC. For the 2021 tax year,\nthe earned income credit ranges from $1,502 to $6,728 depending on tax-filing status, income, and number of\nchildren. The average amount of EITC received nationwide was about $2,411. In 2021, for example, a single\nparent with two children would have received a tax credit of $5,980 up to a modest income level. The amount\nof the tax break increases with the amount of income earned, up to a point. The earned income tax credit has\noften been popular with both economists and the general public because of the way it effectively increases the\npayment received for work.\nWhat about the danger of the poverty trap that every additional $1 earned will reduce government support\npayments by close to $1? To minimize this problem, the earned income tax credit is phased out slowly. For\nexample, according to the Tax Policy Center, for a single-parent family with two children in 2013, the credit is\nnot reduced at all (but neither is it increased) as earnings rise from $13,430 to $17,530. Then, for every $1\nearned above $17,530, the amount received from the credit is reduced by 21.06 cents, until the credit phases\nout completely at an income level of $46,227.\nFigure 15.5illustrates that the earned income tax credits, child tax credits, and the TANF program all cost the\nfederal government money\u2014either in direct outlays or in loss of tax revenues.CTCstands for the government\ntax cuts for the child tax credit.\nFIGURE15.5Real Federal Spending on CTC, EITC, and TANF, 1975\u20132016EITC increased from under $10 billion in\nthe late 1980s to almost $42 billion in 2000 and to over $61 billion in 2016, far exceeding estimated 2016 outlays\nin the CTC (Child Tax Credits) and TANF of over $25 billion and $18 billion, respectively. (Source: Office of\nManagement and Budget)\nIn recent years, the EITC has become a hugely expensive government program for providing income\nassistance to people below or near the poverty line, costing about $60 billion in 2021. In that year, the EITC\nprovided benefits to about 25 million families and individuals and, on average, is worth about $2,411 per\nfamily (with children), according to the Tax Policy Center. One reason that the TANF law worked as well as it\ndid is that the government greatly expanded EITC in the late 1980s and again in the early 1990s, which\nincreased the returns to work for low-income Americans. 368 15 \u2022 Poverty and Economic Inequality\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)\nOften called \u201cfood stamps,\u201dSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)is a federally funded\nprogram, started in 1964, in which each month people receive a card like a debit card that they can use to buy\nfood. The amount of food aid for which a household is eligible varies by income, number of children, and other\nfactors but, in general, households are expected to spend about 30% of their own net income on food, and if\n30% of their net income is not enough to purchase a nutritionally adequate diet, then those households are\neligible for SNAP.\nSNAP can contribute to the poverty trap. For every $100 earned, the government assumes that a family can\nspend $30 more for food, and thus reduces its eligibility for food aid by $30. This decreased benefit is not a\ncomplete disincentive to work\u2014but combined with how other programs reduce benefits as income increases, it\nadds to the problem. SNAP, however, does try to address the poverty trap with its own set of work requirements\nand time limits.\nWhy give debit cards and not just cash? Part of the political support for SNAP comes from a belief that since\nrecipients must spend the the cards on food, they cannot \u201cwaste\u201d them on other forms of consumption. From\nan economic point of view, however, the belief that cards must increase spending on food seems wrong-\nheaded. After all, say that a family is spending $2,500 per year on food, and then it starts receiving $1,000 per\nyear in SNAP aid. The family might react by spending $3,500 per year on food (income plus aid), or it might\nreact by continuing to spend $2,500 per year on food, but use the $1,000 in food aid to free up $1,000 that it\ncan now spend on other goods. Thus, it is reasonable to think of SNAP cards as an alternative method, along\nwith TANF and the earned income tax credit, of transferring income to those working but still experiencing\npoverty.\nAnyone eligible for TANF is also eligible for SNAP, although states can expand eligibility for food aid if they\nwish to do so. In some states, where TANF welfare spending is relatively low, a poor family may receive more in\nsupport from SNAP than from TANF. In 2021, about 41.5 million people received food aid with total benefits of\njust over $108 billion, which is an average monthly benefit of about $287 per person per month. SNAP\nparticipation increased by 70% between 2007 and 2011, from 26.6 million participants to 45 million.\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, the 2008-2009Great Recessionand rising food prices caused\nthis dramatic rise in participation. Likewise, between 2019 and 2021, the number of participants in SNAP\nincreased by 5.8 million, the amount per person increased by 67%, and total benefits nearly doubled as a\nconsequence of the sharp recession due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020.\nThe federal government deploys a range of income security programs that it funds through departments such\nas Health and Human Services, Agriculture, and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (seeFigure 15.6).\nAccording to the Office of Management and Budget, collectively, these three departments provided an\nestimated $62 billion of aid through programs such as supplemental feeding programs for women and\nchildren, subsidized housing, and energy assistance. The federal government also transfers funds to\nindividual states through special grant programs.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 15.3 \u2022 The Safety Net 369\nFIGURE15.6Expenditure Comparison of TANF, SNAP, HUD, and Other Income Security Programs, 1988\u20132013\n(est.)Total expenditures on income security continued to rise between 1988 and 2010, while payments for TANF\nhave increased from $13 billion in 1998 to an estimated $17.3 billion in 2013. SNAP has seen relatively small\nincrements. These two programs comprise a relatively small portion of the estimated $106 billion dedicated to\nincome security in 2013. Note that other programs and housing programs increased dramatically during the 2008\nand 2010 time periods. (Source: Table 12.3 Section 600 Income Security, https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/\ndefault/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist.pdf)\nThe safety net includes a number of other programs: government-subsidized school lunches and breakfasts\nfor children from low-income families; theSpecial Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and\nChildren (WIC), which provides food assistance for pregnant women and newborns; the Low Income Home\nEnergy Assistance Program, which provides help with home heating bills; housing assistance, which helps pay\nthe rent; and Supplemental Security Income, which provides cash support for people with disabilities and\nelderly people experiencing poverty.\nMedicaid\nCongress createdMedicaidin 1965. This is a joint health insurance program between both the states and the\nfederal government. The federal government helps fund Medicaid, but each state is responsible for\nadministering the program, determining the level of benefits, and determining eligibility. It provides medical\ninsurance for certain people with low incomes, including those below the poverty line, with a focus on families\nwith children, the elderly, and people with disabilities. About one-third of Medicaid spending is for low-income\nmothers with children. While an increasing share of the program funding in recent years has gone to pay for\nnursing home costs for older people who cannot afford to pay for housing. The program ensures that\nparticipants receive a basic level of benefits, but because each state sets eligibility requirements and provides\nvarying levels of service, the program differs from state to state.\nIn the past, a common problem has been that many low-paying jobs pay enough to a breadwinner so that a\nfamily could lose its eligibility for Medicaid, yet the job does not offer health insurance benefits. A parent\nconsidering such a job might choose not to work rather than lose health insurance for their children. In this\nway, health insurance can become a part of the poverty trap. Many states recognized this problem in the 1980s\nand 1990s and expanded their Medicaid coverage to include people earning up to 135% or even 185% of the\npoverty line. Some states also guaranteed that children would not lose coverage if their parents worked.\nThese expanded guarantees cost the government money, of course, but they also helped to encourage those on\nwelfare to enter the labor force. As of 2014, approximately 69.7 million people participated in Medicaid. Of 370 15 \u2022 Poverty and Economic Inequality\nthose enrolled, almost half are children. Healthcare expenditures, however, are highest for the elderly\npopulation, which comprises approximately 25% of participants. AsFigure 15.7(a) indicates, the largest\nnumber of households that enroll in Medicaid are those with children. Lower-income adults are the next\nlargest group enrolled in Medicaid at 28%. People who are blind or have a disability account for 16% of those\nenrolled, and seniors are 9% of those enrolled.Figure 15.7(b) shows how much actual Medicaid dollars the\ngovernment spends for each group. Out of total Medicaid spending, the government spends more on seniors\n(20%) and people who are blind or have a disability (44%). Thus, 64% of all Medicaid spending goes to seniors,\nthose who are blind, and people with disabilities. Children receive 21% of all Medicaid spending, followed by\nadults at 15%.\nFIGURE15.7Medicaid Enrollment and SpendingPart (a) shows the Medicaid enrollment by different populations,\nwith children comprising the largest percentage at 47%, followed by adults at 28%, and those who are blind or have\na disability at 16%. Part (b) shows that Medicaid spending is principally for those who are blind or have a disability,\nfollowed by the elderly. Although children are the largest population that Medicaid covers, expenditures on children\nare only at 19%.\n15.4Income Inequality: Measurement and Causes\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain the distribution of income, and analyze the sources of income inequality in a market economy\n\u2022 Measure income distribution in quintiles\n\u2022 Calculate and graph a Lorenz curve\n\u2022 Show income inequality through demand and supply diagrams\nPoverty levels can be subjective based on the overall income levels of a country. Typically a government\nmeasures poverty based on a percentage of the median income. Income inequality, however, has to do with the\ndistribution of that income, in terms of which group receives the most or the least income. Income inequality\ninvolves comparing those with high incomes, middle incomes, and low incomes\u2014not just looking at those\nbelow or near the poverty line. In turn, measuring income inequality means dividing the population into\nvarious groups and then comparing the groups, a task that we can be carry out in several ways, as the next\nClear It Up feature shows.\nCLEAR IT UP\nHow do you separate poverty and income inequality?\nPoverty can change even when inequality does not move at all. Imagine a situation in which income for everyone in\nthe population declines by 10%. Poverty would rise, since a greater share of the population would now fall below\nAccess for free at openstax.org 15.4 \u2022 Income Inequality: Measurement and Causes 371\nthe poverty line. However, inequality would be the same, because everyone suffered the same proportional loss.\nConversely, a general rise in income levels over time would keep inequality the same, but reduce poverty.\nIt is also possible for income inequality to change without affecting the poverty rate. Imagine a situation in which a\nlarge number of people who already have high incomes increase their incomes by even more. Inequality would rise\nas a result\u2014but the number of people below the poverty line would remain unchanged.\nWhy did inequality of household income increase in the United States in recent decades? A trend toward\ngreater income inequality has occurred in many countries around the world, although the effect has been\nmore powerful in the U.S. economy. Economists have focused their explanations for the increasing inequality\non two factors that changed more or less continually from the 1970s into the 2000s. One set of explanations\nfocuses on the changing shape of American households. The other focuses on greater inequality of wages, what\nsome economists call \u201cwinner take all\u201dlabor markets. We will begin with how we measure inequality, and then\nconsider the explanations for growing inequality in the United States.\nMeasuring Income Distribution by Quintiles\nOne common way of measuring income inequality is to rank all households by income, from lowest to highest,\nand then to divide all households into five groups with equal numbers of people, known asquintiles. This\ncalculation allows for measuring the distribution of income among the five groups compared to the total. The\nfirst quintile is the lowest fifth or 20%, the second quintile is the next lowest, and so on. We can measure\nincome inequality by comparing what share of the total income each quintile earns.\nU.S. income distribution by quintile appears inTable 15.5. In 2020, for example, the bottom quintile of the\nincome distribution received 3.2% of income; the second quintile received 8.1%; the third quintile, 14.0%; the\nfourth quintile, 22.6%; and the top quintile, 52.2%. The final column ofTable 15.5shows what share of income\nwent to households in the top 5% of the income distribution: 23.0% in 2020. Over time, from the late 1960s to\nthe early 1980s, the top fifth of the income distribution typically received between about 43% to 44% of all\nincome. The share of income that the top fifth received then begins to rise. Census Bureau researchers trace,\nmuch of this increase in the share of income going to the top fifth to an increase in the share of income going to\nthe top 5%. The quintile measure shows how income inequality has increased in recent decades.\nYear Lowest Quintile Second Quintile Third Quintile Fourth Quintile Highest Quintile Top 5%\n1967 4.0 10.8 17.3 24.2 43.6 17.2\n1970 4.1 10.8 17.4 24.5 43.3 16.6\n1975 4.3 10.4 17.0 24.7 43.6 16.5\n1980 4.2 10.2 16.8 24.7 44.1 16.5\n1985 3.9 9.8 16.2 24.4 45.6 17.6\n1990 3.8 9.6 15.9 24.0 46.6 18.5\n1995 3.7 9.1 15.2 23.3 48.7 21.0\n2000 3.6 8.9 14.8 23.0 49.8 22.1\nTABLE15.5Share of Aggregate Income Received by Each Fifth and Top 5% of Households, 1967\u20132020\n(Source: U.S. Census Bureau, https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/\nhistorical-income-households.html, Table H-1, All Races.) 372 15 \u2022 Poverty and Economic Inequality\nYear Lowest Quintile Second Quintile Third Quintile Fourth Quintile Highest Quintile Top 5%\n2005 3.4 8.6 14.6 23.0 50.4 22.2\n2010 3.3 8.5 14.6 23.4 50.3 21.3\n2015 3.1 8.2 14.3 23.2 51.1 22.1\n2020 3.0 8.1 14.0 22.6 52.2 23.0\nTABLE15.5Share of Aggregate Income Received by Each Fifth and Top 5% of Households, 1967\u20132020\n(Source: U.S. Census Bureau, https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/\nhistorical-income-households.html, Table H-1, All Races.)\nIt can also be useful to divide the income distribution in ways other than quintiles; for example, into tenths or\neven into percentiles (that is, hundredths). A more detailed breakdown can provide additional insights. For\nexample, the last column ofTable 15.5shows the income received by the top 5% of the income distribution.\nBetween 1980 and 2020, the share of income going to the top 5% increased by 6.5 percentage points (from\n16.5% in 1980 to 23.0% in 2020). From 1980 to 2020 the share of income going to the top quintile increased by\n8.1 percentage points (from 44.1% in 1980 to 52.2% in 2013). Thus, the top 20% of householders (the fifth\nquintile) received over half (51%) of all the income in the United States in 2020.\nLorenz Curve\nWe can present the data on income inequality in various ways. For example, you could draw a bar graph that\nshowed the share of income going to each fifth of the income distribution.Figure 15.8presents an alternative\nway of showing inequality data in aLorenz curve. This curve shows the cumulative share of population on the\nhorizontal axis and the cumulative percentage of total income received on the vertical axis.\nFIGURE15.8The Lorenz CurveA Lorenz curve graphs the cumulative shares of income received by everyone up to\na certain quintile. The income distribution in 1980 was closer to the perfect equality line than the income\ndistribution in 2020\u2014that is, the U.S. income distribution became more unequal over time.\nEvery Lorenz curve diagram begins with a line sloping up at a 45-degree angle. We show it as a dashed line in\nFigure 15.8. The points along this line show what perfect equality of the income distribution looks like. It would\nmean, for example, that the bottom 20% of the income distribution receives 20% of the total income, the\nbottom 40% gets 40% of total income, and so on. The other lines reflect actual U.S. data on inequality for 1980\nand 2020.\nThe trick in graphing a Lorenz curve is that you must change the shares of income for each specific quintile,\nwhich we show in the first and third columns of numbers inTable 15.6, into cumulative income, which we\nAccess for free at openstax.org 15.4 \u2022 Income Inequality: Measurement and Causes 373\nshow in the second and fourth columns of numbers. For example, the bottom 40% of the cumulative income\ndistribution will be the sum of the first and second quintiles; the bottom 60% of the cumulative income\ndistribution will be the sum of the first, second, and third quintiles, and so on. The final entry in the cumulative\nincome column needs to be 100%, because by definition, 100% of the population receives 100% of the income.\nIncome Share of Income Cumulative Share of Share of Income Cumulative Share of\nCategory in 1980 (%) Income in 1980 (%) in 2020 (%) Income in 2020 (%)\nFirst\n4.2 4.2 3.0 3.0\nquintile\nSecond\n10.2 14.4 8.1 11.1\nquintile\nThird\n16.8 31.2 14.0 25.1\nquintile\nFourth\n24.7 55.9 22.6 47.7\nquintile\nFifth\n44.1 100.0 52.2 100.0\nquintile\nTABLE15.6Calculating the Lorenz Curve\nIn a Lorenz curve diagram, a more unequal distribution of income will loop farther down and away from the\n45-degree line, while a more equal distribution of income will move the line closer to the 45-degree line.Figure\n15.8illustrates the greater inequality of the U.S. income distribution between 1980 and 2020 because the\nLorenz curve for 2020 is farther from the 45-degree line than the Lorenz curve for 1980. The Lorenz curve is a\nuseful way of presenting the quintile data that provides an image of all the quintile data at once. The next Clear\nIt Up feature shows how income inequality differs in various countries compared to the United States.\nCLEAR IT UP\nHow does economic inequality vary around the world?\nThe U.S. economy has a relatively high degree of income inequality by global standards. AsTable 15.7shows, based\non a variety of national surveys for a selection of years in the second decade of this century, the U.S. economy has\ngreater inequality than Germany (along with most Western European countries). The region of the world with the\nhighest level of income inequality is Latin America, illustrated in the numbers for Brazil and Mexico. The level of\ninequality in the United States is higher than in some of the low-income countries of the world, like India and\nNigeria, as well as in some middle-income countries, like China and Russia.\nCountry Survey Year First Quintile Second Quintile Third Quintile Fourth Quintile Fifth Quintile\nUnited States 2020 3.0% 8.1% 14.0% 22.6% 52.2%\nGermany 2016 7.6% 12.8% 17.1% 22.8% 39.6%\nTABLE15.7Income Distribution in Select Countries(Source: U.S. data from U.S. Census Bureau Table H-1.

One result of this trend is that more households\nhave two earners. Moreover, it has become more common for one high earner to marry another high earner. A\nfew decades ago, the common pattern featured a man with relatively high earnings, such as an executive or a\ndoctor, marrying a woman who did not earn as much, like a secretary or a nurse. Often, the woman would leave\npaid employment, at least for a few years, to raise a family. However, now doctors are marrying doctors and\nexecutives are marrying executives, and mothers with high-powered careers are often returning to work while\ntheir children are quite young. This pattern of households with two high earners tends to increase the\nproportion of high-earning households.\nAccording to data in the National Journal, even as two-earner couples have increased, so have single-parent\nhouseholds. Of all U.S. families, in 2021, about 23% were headed by single mothers. The poverty rate among\nsingle-parent households tends to be relatively high.\nThese changes in family structure, including the growth of single-parent families who tend to be at the lower\nend of the income distribution, and the growth of two-career high-earner couples near the top end of the\nincome distribution, account for roughly half of the rise in income inequality across households in recent\ndecades.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/US_wealth)to watch a video that illustrates the distribution of wealth in\nthe United States.\nCauses of Growing Inequality: A Shift in the Distribution of Wages\nAnother factor behind the rise in U.S. income inequality is that earnings have become less equal since the late\n1970s. In particular, the earnings of high-skilled labor relative to low-skilled labor have increased. Winner-\ntake-all labor markets result from changes in technology, which have increased global demand for\nAccess for free at openstax.org 15.4 \u2022 Income Inequality: Measurement and Causes 375\n\u201cstars,\u201d\u2014whether the best CEO, doctor, basketball player, or actor. This global demand pushes salaries far above\nproductivity differences associated with educational differences. One way to measure this change is to take\nworkers' earnings with at least a four-year college bachelor\u2019s degree (including those who went on and\ncompleted an advanced degree) and divide them by workers' earnings with only a high school degree. The\nresult is that those in the 25\u201334 age bracket with college degrees earned about 1.85 times as much as high\nschool graduates in 2020, up from 1.59 times in 1995, according to U.S. Census data. Winner-take-all labor\nmarket theory argues that the salary gap between the median and the top 1 percent is not due to educational\ndifferences.\nEconomists use the demand and supply model to reason through the most likely causes of this shift. According\nto the National Center for Education Statistics, in recent decades, the supply of U.S. workers with college\ndegrees has increased substantially. For example, 840,000 four-year bachelor\u2019s degrees were conferred on\nAmericans in 1970. In 2018\u20132019, 2.0 million such degrees were conferred\u2014an increase of over 138%. In\nFigure 15.9, this shift in supply to the right, from S to S , by itself should result in a lower equilibrium wage for\n0 1\nhigh-skilled labor. Thus, we can explain the increase in the price of high-skilled labor by a greater demand, like\nthe movement from D to D . Evidently, combining both the increase in supply and in demand has resulted in a\n0 1\nshift from E to E , and a resulting higher wage.\n0 1\nFIGURE15.9Why Would Wages Rise for High-Skilled Labor?The proportion of workers attending college has\nincreased in recent decades, so the supply curve for high-skilled labor has shifted to the right, from S to S . If the\n0 1\ndemand for high-skilled labor had remained at D , then this shift in supply would have led to lower wages for high-\n0\nskilled labor. However, the wages for high-skilled labor, especially if there is a large global demand, have increased\neven with the shift in supply to the right. The explanation must lie in a shift to the right in demand for high-skilled\nlabor, from D to D . The figure shows how a combination of the shift in supply, from S to S , and the shift in\n0 1 0 1\ndemand, from D to D , led to both an increase in the quantity of high-skilled labor hired and also to a rise in the\n0 1\nwage for such labor, from W to W .\n0 1\nWhat factors would cause the demand for high-skilled labor to rise? The most plausible explanation is that\nwhile the explosion in new information and communications technologies over the last several decades has\nhelped many workers to become more productive, the benefits have been especially great for high-skilled\nworkers like top business managers, consultants, and design professionals. The new technologies have also\nhelped to encourageglobalization, the remarkable increase in international trade over the last few decades, by\nmaking it more possible to learn about and coordinate economic interactions all around the world. In turn, the\nrising impact of foreign trade in the U.S. economy has opened up greater opportunities for high-skilled\nworkers to sell their services around the world, and lower-skilled workers have to compete with a larger supply\nof similarly skilled workers around the globe. 376 15 \u2022 Poverty and Economic Inequality\nWe can view the market for high-skilled labor as a race between forces of supply and demand. Additional\neducation and on-the-job training will tend to increase the high-skilled labor supply and to hold down its\nrelative wage. Conversely, new technology and other economic trends like globalization tend to increase the\ndemand for high-skilled labor and push up its relative wage. We can view the greater inequality of wages as a\nsign that demand for skilled labor is increasing faster than supply. Alternatively, if the supply of lower skilled\nworkers exceeds the demand, then average wages in the lower quintiles of the income distribution will\ndecrease. The combination of forces in the high-skilled and low-skilled labor markets leads to increased\nincome disparity.\n15.5Government Policies to Reduce Income Inequality\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain the arguments for and against government intervention in a market economy\n\u2022 Identify beneficial ways to reduce the economic inequality in a society\n\u2022 Show the tradeoff between incentives and income equality\nNo society should expect or desire complete equality of income at a given point in time, for a number of\nreasons. First, most workers receive relatively low earnings in their first few jobs, higher earnings as they\nreach middle age, and then lower earnings after retirement. Thus, a society with people of varying ages will\nhave a certain amount of income inequality. Second, people\u2019s preferences and desires differ. Some are willing\nto work long hours to have income for large houses, fast cars and computers, luxury vacations, and the ability\nto support children and grandchildren.\nThese factors all imply that a snapshot of inequality in a given year does not provide an accurate picture of how\npeople\u2019s incomes rise and fall over time. Even if we expect some degree of economic inequality at any point in\ntime, how much inequality should there be? There is also the difference between income and wealth, as the\nfollowing Clear It Up feature explains.\nCLEAR IT UP\nHow do you measure wealth versus income inequality?\nIncomeis a flow of money received, often measured on a monthly or an annual basis.Wealthis the sum of the\nvalue of all assets, including money in bank accounts, financial investments, a pension fund, and the value of a\nhome. In calculating wealth, one must subtract all debts, such as debt owed on a home mortgage and on credit\ncards. A retired person, for example, may have relatively little income in a given year, other than a pension or Social\nSecurity. However, if that person has saved and invested over time, the person\u2019s accumulated wealth can be quite\nsubstantial.\nIn the United States, the wealth distribution is more unequal than the income distribution, because differences in\nincome can accumulate over time to make even larger differences in wealth. However, we can measure the degree\nof inequality in the wealth distribution with the same tools we use to measure the inequality in the income\ndistribution, like quintile measurements. Once every three years the Federal Reserve Bank publishes theSurvey of\nConsumer Financewhich reports a collection of data on wealth.\nEven if they cannot answer the question of how much inequality is too much, economists can still play an\nimportant role in spelling out policy options and tradeoffs. If a society decides to reduce the level of economic\ninequality, it has three main sets of tools: redistribution from those with high incomes to those with low\nincomes; trying to assure that a ladder of opportunity is widely available; and a tax on inheritance.\nRedistribution\nRedistributionmeans taking income from those with higher incomes and providing income to those with\nAccess for free at openstax.org 15.5 \u2022 Government Policies to Reduce Income Inequality 377\nlower incomes. Earlier in this chapter, we considered some of the key government policies that provide\nsupport for people experiencing poverty: the welfare program TANF, the earned income tax credit, SNAP, and\nMedicaid. If a reduction in inequality is desired, these programs could receive additional funding.\nThe federal income tax, which is aprogressive tax systemdesigned in such a way that the rich pay a higher\npercent in income taxes than the poor, funds the programs. Data from household income tax returns in 2018\nshows that the top 1% of households had an average income of $1,679,000 per year in pre-tax income and paid\nan average federal tax rate of 25.4%. Theeffective income tax, which is total taxes paid divided by total\nincome (all sources of income such as wages, profits, interest, rental income, and government transfers such\nas veterans\u2019 benefits), was much lower. The effective tax paid by that top 1% of householders paid was 20.4%,\nwhile the bottom two quintiles actually paid negative effective income taxes, because of provisions like the\nearned income tax credit. News stories occasionally report on a high-income person who has managed to pay\nvery little in taxes, but while such individual cases exist, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the\ntypical pattern is that people with higher incomes pay a higher average share of their income in federal income\ntaxes.\nOf course, the fact that some degree of redistribution occurs now through the federal income tax and\ngovernment antipoverty programs does not settle the questions of how much redistribution is appropriate, and\nwhether more redistribution should occur.\nThe Ladder of Opportunity\nEconomic inequality is perhaps most troubling when it is not the result of effort or talent, but instead is\ndetermined by the circumstances under which a child grows up. One child attends a well-run grade school and\nhigh school and heads on to college, while parents help out by supporting education and other interests,\npaying for college, a first car, and a first house, and offering work connections that lead to internships and jobs.\nAnother child attends a poorly run grade school, barely makes it through a low-quality high school, does not go\nto college, and lacks family and peer support. These two children may be similar in their underlying talents\nand in the effort they put forth, but their economic outcomes are likely to be quite different.\nPublic policycan attempt to build a ladder of opportunities so that, even though all children will never come\nfrom identical families and attend identical schools, each child has a reasonable opportunity to attain an\neconomic niche in society based on their interests, desires, talents, and efforts.Table 15.8shows some of those\ninitiatives.\nChildren College Level Adults\n\u2022 Improved day \u2022 Widespread loans and grants for those in \u2022 Opportunities for retraining and acquiring\ncare financial need new skills\n\u2022 Enrichment \u2022 Public support for a range of institutions from \u2022 Prohibiting discrimination in job markets\nprograms for two-year community colleges to large research and housing on the basis of race, gender,\npreschoolers universities age, and disability\n\u2022 Improved\n- -\npublic schools\nTABLE15.8Public Policy Initiatives 378 15 \u2022 Poverty and Economic Inequality\nChildren College Level Adults\n\u2022 After school\nand community - -\nactivities\n\u2022 Internships\nand - -\napprenticeships\nTABLE15.8Public Policy Initiatives\nSome have called the United States a land of opportunity. Although the general idea of a ladder of opportunity\nfor all citizens continues to exert a powerful attraction, specifics are often quite controversial. Society can\nexperiment with a wide variety of proposals for building a ladder of opportunity, especially for those who\notherwise seem likely to start their lives in a disadvantaged position. The government needs to carry out such\npolicy experiments in a spirit of open-mindedness, because some will succeed while others will not show\npositive results or will cost too much to enact on a widespread basis.\nInheritance Taxes\nThere is always a debate about inheritance taxes. It goes like this: Why should people who have worked hard all\ntheir lives and saved up a substantial nest egg not be able to give their money and possessions to their children\nand grandchildren? In particular, it would seem un-American if children were unable to inherit a family\nbusiness or a family home. Alternatively, many Americans are far more comfortable with inequality resulting\nfrom high-income people who earned their money by starting innovative new companies than they are with\ninequality resulting from high-income people who have inherited money from rich parents.\nThe United States does have anestate tax\u2014that is, a tax imposed on the value of an inheritance\u2014which\nsuggests a willingness to limit how much wealth one can pass on as an inheritance. However, in 2022 the estate\ntax applied only to those leaving inheritances of more than $12.06 million and thus applies to only a tiny\npercentage of those with high levels of wealth.\nThe Tradeoff between Incentives and Income Equality\nGovernment policies to reduce poverty or to encourage economic equality, if carried to extremes, can injure\nincentives for economic output. The poverty trap, for example, defines a situation where guaranteeing a\ncertain level of income can eliminate or reduce the incentive to work. An extremely high degree of\nredistribution, with very high taxes on the rich, would be likely to discourage work and entrepreneurship.\nThus, it is common to draw the tradeoff between economic output and equality, asFigure 15.10(a) shows. In\nthis formulation, if society wishes a high level of economic output, like point A, it must also accept a high\ndegree of inequality. Conversely, if society wants a high level of equality, like point B, it must accept a lower\nlevel of economic output because of reduced incentives for production.\nThis view of the tradeoff between economic output and equality may be too pessimistic, andFigure 15.10(b)\npresents an alternate vision. Here, the tradeoff between economic output and equality first slopes up, in the\nvicinity of choice C, suggesting that certain programs might increase both output and economic equality. For\nexample, the policy of providing free public education has an element of redistribution, since the value of the\npublic schooling received by children of low-income families is clearly higher than what low-income families\npay in taxes. A well-educated population, however, is also an enormously powerful factor in providing the\nskilled workers of tomorrow and helping the economy to grow and expand. In this case, equality and economic\ngrowth may complement each other.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 15.5 \u2022 Government Policies to Reduce Income Inequality 379\nMoreover, policies to diminish inequality and soften the hardship of poverty may sustain political support for a\nmarket economy. After all, if society does not make some effort toward reducing inequality and poverty, the\nalternative might be that people would rebel against market forces. Citizens might seek economic security by\ndemanding that their legislators pass laws forbidding employers from ever laying off workers or reducing\nwages, or laws that would impose price floors and price ceilings and shut off international trade. From this\nviewpoint, policies to reduce inequality may help economic output by building social support for allowing\nmarkets to operate.\nFIGURE15.10The Tradeoff between Incentives and Economic Equality(a) Society faces a trade-off where any\nattempt to move toward greater equality, like moving from choice A to B, involves a reduction in economic output.\n(b) Situations can arise like point C, where it is possible both to increase equality and also to increase economic\noutput, to a choice like D. It may also be possible to increase equality with little impact on economic output, like the\nmovement from choice D to E. However, at some point, too aggressive a push for equality will tend to reduce\neconomic output, as in the shift from E to F.\nThe tradeoff inFigure 15.10(b) then flattens out in the area between points D and E, which reflects the pattern\nthat a number of countries that provide similar levels of income to their citizens\u2014the United States, Canada,\nEuropean Union nations, Japan, and Australia\u2014have different levels of inequality. The pattern suggests that\ncountries in this range could choose a greater or a lesser degree of inequality without much impact on\neconomic output. Only if these countries push for a much higher level of equality, like at point F, will they\nexperience the diminished incentives that lead to lower levels of economic output. In this view, while a danger\nalways exists that an agenda to reduce poverty or inequality can be poorly designed or pushed too far, it is also\npossible to discover and design policies that improve equality and do not injure incentives for economic output\nby very much\u2014or even improve such incentives.\nBRING IT HOME\nOccupy Wall Street\nThe Occupy movement took on a life of its own over the last few months of 2011, bringing to light issues that many\npeople faced on the lower end of the income distribution. The contents of this chapter indicate that there is a\nsignificant amount of income inequality in the United States. The question is: What should be done about it?\nThe 2008-2009 Great Recession caused unemployment to rise and incomes to fall. Many people attribute the\nrecession to mismanagement of the financial system by bankers and financial managers\u2014those in the 1% of the\nincome distribution\u2014but those in lower quintiles bore the greater burden of the recession through unemployment.\nThis seemed to present the picture of inequality in a different light: the group that seemed responsible for the\nrecession was not the group that seemed to bear the burden of the decline in output. A burden shared can bring a 380 15 \u2022 Poverty and Economic Inequality\nsociety closer together. A burden pushed off onto others can polarize it.\nOn one level, the problem with trying to reduce income inequality comes down to whether you still believe in the\nAmerican Dream. If you believe that one day you will have your American Dream\u2014a large income, large house,\nhappy family, or whatever else you would like to have in life\u2014then you do not necessarily want to prevent anyone\nelse from living out their dream. You certainly would not want to run the risk that someone would want to take part\nof your dream away from you. Thus, there is some reluctance to engage in a redistributive policy to reduce\ninequality.\nHowever, when those for whom the likelihood of living the American Dream is very small are considered, there are\nsound arguments in favor of trying to create greater balance. As the text indicated, a little more income equality,\ngained through long-term programs like increased education and job training, can increase overall economic output.\nThen everyone is made better off, and the 1% will not seem like such a small group any more.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 15 \u2022 Key Terms 381\nKey Terms\nearned income tax credit (EITC) a method of assisting the working poor through the tax system\neffective income tax percentage of total taxes paid divided by total income\nestate tax a tax imposed on the value of an inheritance\nincome a flow of money received, often measured on a monthly or an annual basis\nincome inequality when one group receives a disproportionate share of total income or wealth than others\nLorenz curve a graph that compares the cumulative income actually received to a perfectly equal distribution\nof income; it shows the share of population on the horizontal axis and the cumulative percentage of total\nincome received on the vertical axis\nMedicaid a federal\u2013state joint program enacted in 1965 that provides medical insurance for certain (not all)\npeople with a low-income, including those near the poverty line as well as those below the poverty line,\nand focusing on low-income families with children, the low-income elderly, and people with disabilities\npoverty the situation of being below a certain level of income one needs for a basic standard of living\npoverty line the specific amount of income one requires for a basic standard of living\npoverty rate percentage of the population living below the poverty line\npoverty trap antipoverty programs set up so that government benefits decline substantially as people earn\nmore income\u2014as a result, working provides little financial gain\nprogressive tax system a tax system in which the rich pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes, rather\nthan a higher absolute amount\nquintile dividing a group into fifths, a method economists often use to look at distribution of income\nredistribution taking income from those with higher incomes and providing income to those with lower\nincomes\nsafety net the group of government programs that provide assistance to people at or near the poverty line\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) a federally funded program, started in 1964, in which\neach month poor people receive SNAP cards they can use to buy food\nwealth the sum of the value of all assets, including money in bank accounts, financial investments, a pension\nfund, and the value of a home\nKey Concepts and Summary\n15.1Drawing the Poverty Line\nWages are influenced by Supply and demand in labor markets influence wages. This can lead to very low\nincomes for some people and very high incomes for others. Poverty and income inequality are not the same\nthing. Poverty applies to the condition of people who cannot afford the necessities of life. Income inequality\nrefers to the disparity between those with higher and lower incomes. The poverty rate is what percentage of the\npopulation lives below the poverty line, which the amount of income that it takes to purchase the necessities of\nlife determines. Choosing a poverty line will always be somewhat controversial.\n15.2The Poverty Trap\nA poverty trap occurs when government-support payments decline as the recipients earn more income. As a\nresult, the recipients do not end up with much more income when they work, because the loss of government\nsupport largely or completely offsets any income that one earns by working. Phasing out government benefits\nmore slowly, as well as imposing requirements for work as a condition of receiving benefits and a time limit on\nbenefits can reduce the harshness of the poverty trap.\n15.3The Safety Net\nWe call the group of government programs that address poverty the safety net. In the United States, prominent\nsafety net programs include Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), the Supplemental Nutrition\nAssistance Program (SNAP), the earned income tax credit (EITC), Medicaid, and the Special Supplemental\nFood Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). 382 15 \u2022 Self-Check Questions\n15.4Income Inequality: Measurement and Causes\nMeasuring inequality involves making comparisons across the entire distribution of income. One way of doing\nthis is to divide the population into groups, like quintiles, and then calculate what share of income each group\nreceives. An alternative approach is to draw Lorenz curves, which compare the cumulative income actually\nreceived to a perfectly equal distribution of income. Income inequality in the United States increased\nsubstantially from the late 1970s and early 1980s into the 2000s. The two most common explanations that\neconomists cite are changes in household structures that have led to more two-earner couples and single-\nparent families, and the effect of new information and communications technology on wages.\n15.5Government Policies to Reduce Income Inequality\nPolicies that can affect the level of economic inequality include redistribution between rich and poor, making it\neasier for people to climb the ladder of opportunity; and estate taxes, which are taxes on inheritances. Pushing\ntoo aggressively for economic equality can run the risk of decreasing economic incentives. However, a\nmoderate push for economic equality can increase economic output, both through methods like improved\neducation and by building a base of political support for market forces.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

She can earn $8 per hour and works up to 1,800 hours per\nyear. However, if she does not earn any income at all, she will receive government benefits totaling\n$16,000 per year. For every $1 of income she earns, her level of government support will be reduced by\n$1. Create a table, patterned afterthis one. The first column should show Susan\u2019s choices of how many\nhours to work per year, up to 1,800 hours. The second column should show her earnings from work.

While originally a\ncontroversial topic, it has gained majority approval at 55% as of March 2022.

This\nwas officially known as thePatient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA)or as theAffordable Care Act (ACA),\nbut was more popularly known as Obamacare. The bill\u2019s opponents\u2019 claims ranged from the charge that the changes\nwere unconstitutional and would add $750 billion to the deficit, to extreme claims about the inclusion of things like\nthe implantation of microchips and so-called \u201cdeath panels\u201d that decide which critically-ill patients receive care and\nwhich do not. 388 16 \u2022 Information, Risk, and Insurance\nWhy did people react so strongly? After all, the intent of the law is to make healthcare insurance more affordable, to\nallow more people to obtain insurance, and to reduce the costs of healthcare. For each year from 2000 to 2011,\nthese costs grew at least double the rate of inflation. In 2014, healthcare spending accounted for around 24% of all\nfederal government spending. In the United States, we spend more for our healthcare than any other high-income\nnation, yet our health outcomes are worse than comparable high-income countries. In 2015, over 32 million people\nin the United States, about 12.8% of the non-elderly adult population, were without insurance. Even today, however,\nmore than a decade after the Act was signed into law and after the Supreme Court mostly upheld it, a 2022 Kaiser\nFoundation poll found that 42% of likely voters viewed it unfavorably. Why is this?\nThe debate over the ACA and healthcare reform could take an entire textbook, but what this chapter will do is\nintroduce the basics of insurance and the problems insurance companies face. It is these problems, and how\ninsurance companies respond to them that, in part, explain the divided opinion about the ACA.\nEvery purchase is based on a belief about the satisfaction that the good or service will provide. In turn, these\nbeliefs are based on the information that the buyer has available. For many products, the information available\nto the buyer or the seller is imperfect or unclear, which can either make buyers regret past purchases or avoid\nmaking future ones.\nThis chapter discusses how imperfect and asymmetric information affect markets. The first module of the\nchapter discusses how asymmetric information affects markets for goods, labor, and financial capital. When\nbuyers have less information about the quality of the good (for example, a gemstone) than sellers do, sellers\nmay be tempted to mislead buyers. If a buyer cannot have at least some confidence in the quality of what they\nare purchasing, then they will be reluctant or unwilling to purchase the products. Thus, we require\nmechanisms to bridge this information gap, so buyers and sellers can engage in a transaction.\nThe second module of the chapter discusses insurance markets, which also face similar problems of imperfect\ninformation. For example, a car insurance company would prefer to sell insurance only to those who are\nunlikely to have auto accidents\u2014but it is hard for the firm to identify those perfectly safe drivers. Conversely,\ncar insurance buyers would like to persuade the auto insurance company that they are safe drivers and should\npay only a low price for coverage. If insurance markets cannot find ways to grapple with these problems of\nimperfect information, then even people who have low or average risks of making claims may not be able to\npurchase insurance. The chapter on financial markets (markets for stocks and bonds) will show that the\nproblems of imperfect information can be especially poignant. We cannot eliminate imperfect information,\nbut we can often manage it.\n16.1The Problem of Imperfect Information and Asymmetric Information\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Analyze the impact of both imperfect information and asymmetric information\n\u2022 Evaluate the role of advertisements in creating imperfect information\n\u2022 Identify ways to reduce the risk of imperfect information\n\u2022 Explain how imperfect information can affect price, quantity, and quality\nConsider a purchase that many people make at important times in their lives: buying expensive jewelry. In May\n1994, celebrity psychologist Doree Lynn bought an expensive ring from a jeweler in Washington, D.C., which\nincluded an emerald that cost $14,500. Several years later, the emerald fractured. Lynn took it to another\njeweler who found that cracks in the emerald had been filled with an epoxy resin. Lynn sued the original\njeweler in 1997 for selling her a treated emerald without telling her, and won. The case publicized a number of\nlittle-known facts about precious stones. Most emeralds have internal flaws, and so they are soaked in clear oil\nor an epoxy resin to hide the flaws and make the color more deep and clear. Clear oil can leak out over time,\nand epoxy resin can discolor with age or heat. However, using clear oil or epoxy to \u201cfill\u201d emeralds is completely\nAccess for free at openstax.org 16.1 \u2022 The Problem of Imperfect Information and Asymmetric Information 389\nlegal, as long as it is disclosed.\nAfter Doree Lynn\u2019s lawsuit, the NBC news show \u201cDateline\u201d bought emeralds at four prominent jewelry stores in\nNew York City in 1997. All the sales clerks at these stores, unaware that they were being recorded on a hidden\ncamera, said the stones were untreated. When the emeralds were tested at a laboratory, however, technicians\ndiscovered they had all been treated with oil or epoxy. Emeralds are not the only gemstones that are treated.\nDiamonds, topaz, and tourmaline are also often irradiated to enhance colors. The general rule is that all\ntreatments to gemstones should be revealed, but often sellers do not disclose this. As such, many buyers face a\nsituation ofasymmetric information, where two parties involved in an economic transaction have an unequal\namount of information (one party knows much more than the other).\nMany economic transactions occur in a situation ofimperfect information, where either the buyer, the seller,\nor both, are less than 100% certain about the qualities of what they are buying and selling. Also, one may\ncharacterize the transaction as asymmetric information, in which one party has more information than the\nother regarding the economic transaction. Let\u2019s begin with some examples of how imperfect information\ncomplicates transactions in goods, labor, andfinancial capital markets. The presence of imperfect information\ncan easily cause a decline in prices or quantities of products sold. However, buyers and sellers also have\nincentives to create mechanisms that will allow them to make mutually beneficial transactions even in the face\nof imperfect information.\nIf you are unclear about the difference between asymmetric information and imperfect information, read the\nfollowing Clear It Up feature.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat is the difference between imperfect and asymmetric information?\nFor a market to reachequilibriumsellers and buyers must have full information about the product\u2019s price and\nquality. If there is limited information, then buyers and sellers may not be able to transact or will possibly make poor\ndecisions.\nImperfect information refers to the situation where buyers and/or sellers do not have all of the necessary\ninformation to make an informed decision about the product's price or quality. The term imperfect information\nsimply means that the buyers and/or sellers do not have all the information necessary to make an informed\ndecision. Asymmetric information is the condition where one party, either the buyer or the seller, has more\ninformation about the product's quality or price than the other party. In either case (imperfect or asymmetric\ninformation) buyers or sellers need remedies to make more informed decisions.\n\u201cLemons\u201d and Other Examples of Imperfect Information\nConsider Marvin, who is trying to decide whether to buy a used car. Let\u2019s assume that Marvin is truly clueless\nabout what happens inside a car\u2019s engine. He is willing to do some background research, like reading\nConsumer Reportsor checking websites that offer information about used car makes and models and what\nthey should cost. He might pay a mechanic to inspect the car. Even after devoting some money and time\ncollecting information, however, Marvin still cannot be absolutely sure that he is buying a high-quality used\ncar. He knows that he might buy the car, drive it home, and use it for a few weeks before discovering that car is\na \u201clemon,\u201d which is slang for a defective product (especially a car).\nImagine that Marvin shops for a used car and finds two that look very similar in terms of mileage, exterior\nappearances, and age. One car costs $4,000, while the other car costs $4,600. Which car should Marvin buy?\nIf Marvin were choosing in a world of perfect information, the answer would be simple: he should buy the\ncheaper car. However, Marvin is operating in a world of imperfect information, where the sellers likely know\nmore about the car\u2019s problems than he does, and have an incentive to hide the information. After all, the more 390 16 \u2022 Information, Risk, and Insurance\nproblems the sellers disclose, the lower the car\u2019s selling price.\nWhat should Marvin do? First, he needs to understand that even with imperfect information, prices still reflect\ninformation. Typically, used cars are more expensive on some dealer lots because the dealers have a\ntrustworthy reputation to uphold. Those dealers try to fix problems that may not be obvious to their customers,\nin order to create good word of mouth about their vehicles\u2019 long term reliability. The short term benefits of\nselling their customers a \u201clemon\u201d could cause a quick collapse in the dealer\u2019s reputation and a loss of long\nterm profits. On other lots that are less well-established, one can find cheaper used cars, but the buyer takes on\nmore risk when a dealer\u2019s reputation has little at stake. The cheapest cars of all often appear on Craigslist,\nwhere the individual seller has no reputation to defend. In sum, cheaper prices do carry more risk, so Marvin\nshould balance his appetite for risk versus the potential headaches of many more unanticipated trips to the\nrepair shop.\nSimilar problems with imperfect information arise in labor and financial capital markets. Consider Greta, who\nis applying for a job. Her potential employer, like the used car buyer, is concerned about ending up with a\n\u201clemon\u201d\u2014in this case a poor quality employee. The employer will collect information about Greta\u2019s academic\nand work history. In the end, however, a degree of uncertainty will inevitably remain regarding Greta\u2019s abilities,\nwhich are hard to demonstrate without actually observing her on the job. How can a potential employer screen\nfor certain attributes, such as motivation, timeliness, and ability to get along with others? Employers often look\nto trade schools and colleges to pre-screen candidates. Employers may not even interview a candidate unless\nhe has a degree and, sometimes, a degree from a particular school. Employers may also view awards, a high\ngrade point average, and other accolades as a signal of hard work, perseverance, and ability. Employers may\nalso seek references for insights into key attributes such as energy level and work ethic.\nHow Imperfect Information Can Affect Equilibrium Price and Quantity\nThe presence of imperfect information can discourage both buyers and sellers from participating in the\nmarket. Buyers may become reluctant to participate because they cannot determine the product's quality.\nSellers of high-quality or medium-quality goods may be reluctant to participate, because it is difficult to\ndemonstrate the quality of their goods to buyers\u2014and since buyers cannot determine which goods have higher\nquality, they are likely to be unwilling to pay a higher price for such goods.\nEconomists sometimes refer to a market with few buyers and few sellers as athin market. By contrast, they call\na market with many buyers and sellers athick market. When imperfect information is severe and buyers and\nsellers are discouraged from participating, markets may become extremely thin as a relatively small number\nof buyer and sellers attempt to communicate enough information that they can agree on a price.\nWhen Price Mixes with Imperfect Information about Quality\nA buyer confronted with imperfect information will often believe that the price reveals something about the\nproduct's quality. For example, a buyer may assume that a gemstone or a used car that costs more must be of\nhigher quality, even though the buyer is not an expert on gemstones. Think of the expensive restaurant where\nthe food must be good because it is so expensive or the shop where the clothes must be stylish because they\ncost so much, or the gallery where the art must be great, because the price tags are high. If you are hiring a\nlawyer, you might assume that a lawyer who charges $400 per hour must be better than a lawyer who charges\n$150 per hour. In these cases, price can act as a signal of quality.\nWhen buyers use the market price to draw inferences about the products' quality, then markets may have\ntrouble reaching anequilibrium priceand quantity. Imagine a situation where a used car dealer has a lot full of\nused cars that do not seem to be selling, and so the dealer decides to cut the car prices to sell a greater\nquantity. In a market with imperfect information, many buyers may assume that the lower price implies low-\nquality cars. As a result, the lower price may not attract more customers. Conversely, a dealer who raises prices\nmay find that customers assume that the higher price means that cars are of higher quality. As a result of\nraising prices, the dealer might sell more cars. (Whether or not consumers always behave rationally, as an\nAccess for free at openstax.org 16.1 \u2022 The Problem of Imperfect Information and Asymmetric Information 391\neconomist would see it, is the subject of the following Clear It Up feature.)\nThe idea that higher prices might cause a greater quantity demanded and that lower prices might cause a\nlower quantity demanded runs exactly counter to the basic model of demand and supply (as we outlined in the\nDemand and Supplychapter). These contrary effects, however, will reach natural limits. At some point, if the\nprice is high enough, the quantity demanded will decline. Conversely, when the price declines far enough,\nbuyers will increasingly find value even if the quality is lower. In addition, information eventually becomes\nmore widely known. An overpriced restaurant that charges more than the quality of its food is worth to many\nbuyers will not last forever.\nCLEAR IT UP\nIs consumer behavior rational?\nThere is much human behavior that mainstream economists have tended to call \u201cirrational\u201d since it is consistently at\nodds with economists\u2019utility maximizingmodels. The typical response is for economists to brush these behaviors\naside and call them \u201canomalies\u201d or unexplained quirks.\n\u201cIf only you knew more economics, you would not be so irrational,\u201d is what many mainstream economists seem to\nbe saying. A group known asbehavioral economistshas challenged this notion, because so much of this so-called\n\u201cquirky\u201d behavior is extremely common among us. For example, a conventional economist would say that if you lost\na $10 bill today, and also received an extra $10 in your paycheck, you should feel perfectly neutral. After all, \u2013$10 +\n$10 = $0. You are the same financially as you were before. However, behavioral economists have conducted\nresearch that shows many people will feel some negative emotion\u2014anger or frustration\u2014after those two things\nhappen. We tend to focus more on the loss than the gain. Economists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in a\nfamous 1979Econometricapaper called this \"loss aversion\", where a $1 loss pains us 2.25 times more than a $1\ngain helps us. This has implications for investing, as people tend to \u201coverplay\u201d the stock market by reacting more to\nlosses than to gains.\nBehavioral economics also tries to explain why people make seemingly irrational decisions in the presence of\ndifferent situations, or how they \"frame\" the decision. We outline a popular example here: Imagine you have the\nopportunity to buy an alarm clock for $20 in Store A. Across the street, you learn, is the exact same clock at Store B\nfor $10. You might say it is worth your time\u2014a five-minute walk\u2014to save $10. Now, take a different example: You are\nin Store A buying a $300 phone. Five minutes away, at Store B, the same phone is $290. You again save $10 by\ntaking a five-minute walk. Do you do it?\nSurprisingly, it is likely that you would not. Mainstream economists would say \u201c$10 is $10\u201d and that it would be\nirrational to make a five minute walk for $10 in one case and not the other. However, behavioral economists have\npointed out that most of us evaluate outcomes relative to a reference point\u2014here the cost of the product\u2014and think\nof gains and losses as percentages rather than using actual savings.\nWhich view is right? Both have their advantages, but behavioral economists have at least shed a light on trying to\ndescribe and explain systematic behavior which some previously had dismissed as irrational. If most of us are\nengaged in some \u201cirrational behavior,\u201d perhaps there are deeper underlying reasons for this behavior in the first\nplace.\nMechanisms to Reduce the Risk of Imperfect Information\nIf you were selling a good like emeralds or used cars where imperfect information is likely to be a problem,\nhow could you reassure possible buyers? If you were buying a good where imperfect information is a problem,\nwhat would it take to reassure you? Buyers and sellers in the goods market rely on reputation as well as\nguarantees, warrantees, and service contracts to assure product quality. The labor market uses occupational\nlicenses and certifications to assure competency, while the financial capital market uses cosigners and 392 16 \u2022 Information, Risk, and Insurance\ncollateral as insurance against unforeseen, detrimental events.\nIn the goods market, the seller might offer amoney-back guarantee, an agreement that functions as a\npromise of quality. This strategy may be especially important for a company that sells goods through mail-\norder catalogs or over the web, whose customers cannot see the actual products, because it encourages people\nto buy something even if they are not certain they want to keep it.\nL.L. Bean started using money-back-guarantees in 1911, when the founder stitched waterproof shoe rubbers\ntogether with leather shoe tops, and sold them as hunting shoes. He guaranteed satisfaction. However, the\nstitching came apart and, out of the first batch of 100 pairs that were sold, customers returned 90 pairs. L.L.\nBean took out a bank loan, repaired all of the shoes, and replaced them. The L.L. Bean reputation for customer\nsatisfaction began to spread. Many firms today offer money-back-guarantees for a few weeks or months, but\nL.L. Bean offers a complete money-back guarantee. Customers can always return anything they have bought\nfrom L.L. Bean, no matter how many years later or what condition the product is in, for a full money-back\nguarantee.\nL.L. Bean has very few stores. Instead, most of its sales are made by mail, telephone, or, now, through their\nwebsite. For this kind of firm, imperfect information may be an especially difficult problem, because\ncustomers cannot see and touch what they are buying. A combination of a money-back guarantee and a\nreputation for quality can help for a mail-order firm to flourish.\nSellers may offer awarranty, which is a promise to fix or replace the good, at least for a certain time period.\nThe seller may also offer a buyer a chance to buy aservice contract, where the buyer pays an extra amount\nand the seller agrees to fix anything that goes wrong for a set time period. Service contracts are often an option\nfor buyers of large purchases such as cars, appliances and even houses.\nGuarantees, warranties, and service contracts are examples of explicit reassurance that sellers provide. In\nmany cases, firms also offer unstated guarantees. For example, some movie theaters might refund the ticket\ncost to a customer who walks out complaining about the show. Likewise, while restaurants do not generally\nadvertise a money-back guarantee or exchange policies, many restaurants allow customers to exchange one\ndish for another or reduce the price of the bill if the customer is not satisfied.\nThe rationale for these policies is that firms want repeat customers, who in turn will recommend the business\nto others. As such, establishing a good reputation is of paramount importance. When buyers know that a firm\nis concerned about its reputation, they are less likely to worry about receiving a poor-quality product. For\nexample, a well-established grocery store with a good reputation can often charge a higher price than a\ntemporary stand at a local farmer\u2019s market, where the buyer may never see the seller again.\nSellers of labor provide information through resumes, recommendations, school transcripts, and examples of\ntheir work. The labor market also usesoccupational licensesto establish quality in thelabor market.\nOccupational licenses, which government agencies typically issue, show that a worker has completed a certain\ntype of education or passed a certain test. Some of the professionals who must hold a license are doctors,\nteachers, nurses, engineers, accountants, and lawyers. In addition, most states require a license to work as a\nbarber, an embalmer, a dietitian, a massage therapist, a hearing aid dealer, a counselor, an insurance agent,\nand a real estate broker. Some other jobs require a license in only one state. Minnesota requires a state license\nto be a field archaeologist. North Dakota has a state license for bait retailers. In Louisiana, one needs a state\nlicense to be a \u201cstress analyst\u201d and California requires a state license to be a furniture upholsterer. According\nto a 2013 study from the University of Chicago, about 29% of U.S. workers have jobs that require occupational\nlicenses.\nOccupational licenses have their downside as well, as they represent a barrier to entry to certain industries.\nThis makes it more difficult for new entrants to compete with incumbents, which can lead to higher prices and\nless consumer choice. In occupations that require licenses, the government has decided that the additional\ninformation provided by licenses outweighs the negative effect on competition.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 16.1 \u2022 The Problem of Imperfect Information and Asymmetric Information 393\nCLEAR IT UP\nAre advertisers allowed to benefit from imperfect information?\nMany advertisements seem full of imperfect information\u2014at least by what they imply. Driving a certain car, drinking\na particular soda, or wearing a certain shoe are all unlikely to bring fashionable friends and fun automatically, if at\nall. The government rules on advertising, enforced by theFederal Trade Commission (FTC), allow advertising to\ncontain a certain amount of exaggeration about the general delight of using a product. They, however, also demand\nthat if one presents a claim as a fact, it must be true.\nLegally, deceptive advertising dates back to the 1950s when Colgate-Palmolive created a television advertisement\nthat seemed to show Rapid Shave shaving cream being spread on sandpaper and then the sand was shaved off the\nsandpaper. What the television advertisement actually showed was sand sprinkled on Plexiglas\u2014without glue\u2014and\nthen scraped aside by the razor.\nIn the 1960s, in magazine advertisements for Campbell\u2019s vegetable soup, the company was having problems getting\nan appetizing soup picture, because the vegetables kept sinking. To remedy this, they filled a bowl with marbles and\npoured the soup over the top, so that the bowl appeared to be crammed with vegetables.\nIn the late 1980s, the Volvo Company filmed a television advertisement that showed a monster truck driving over\ncars, crunching their roofs\u2014all except for the Volvo, which did not crush. However, the FTC found in 1991 that the\nVolvo's roof from the filming had been reinforced with an extra steel framework, while they cut the roof supports on\nthe other car brands.\nThe Wonder Bread Company ran television advertisements featuring \u201cProfessor Wonder,\u201d who said that because\nWonder Bread contained extra calcium, it would help children\u2019s minds work better and improve their memory. The\nFTC objected, and in 2002 the company agreed to stop running the advertisements.\nAs we can see in each of these cases, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) often checks factual claims about the\nproduct\u2019s performance, at least to some extent. Language and images that are exaggerated or ambiguous, but not\nactually false, are allowed in advertising. Untrue \u201cfacts\u201d are not permitted. In any case, an old Latin saying applies\nwhen watching advertisements:Caveat emptor\u2014that is, \u201clet the buyer beware.\u201d\nOn the buyer\u2019s side of the labor market, a standard precaution against hiring a \u201clemon\u201d of an employee is to\nspecify that the first few months of employment are officially a trial or probationary period, and that the\nemployer can dismiss the worker for any reason or no reason during that time. Sometimes workers also\nreceive lower pay during this trial period.\nIn thefinancial capital market, before a bank makes a loan, it requires a prospective borrower to fill out forms\nregarding incomes sources. In addition, the bank conducts a credit check on the individual\u2019s past borrowing.\nAnother approach is to require acosigneron a loan; that is, another person or firm who legally pledges to\nrepay some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so. Another approach is to require\ncollateral, often property or equipment that the bank would have a right to seize and sell if borrower does not\nrepay the loan.\nBuyers of goods and services cannot possibly become experts in evaluating the quality of gemstones, used\ncars, lawyers, and everything else they buy. Employers and lenders cannot be perfectly omniscient about\nwhether possible workers will turn out well or potential borrowers will repay loans on time. However, the\nmechanisms that we mentioned above can reduce the risks associated with imperfect information so that the\nbuyer and seller are willing to proceed. 394 16 \u2022 Information, Risk, and Insurance\n16.2Insurance and Imperfect Information\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain how insurance works\n\u2022 Identify and evaluate various forms of government and social insurance\n\u2022 Discuss the problems caused by moral hazard and adverse selection\n\u2022 Analyze the impact of government regulation of insurance\nInsuranceis a method that households and firms use to prevent any single event from having a significant\ndetrimental financial effect. Generally, households or firms with insurance make regular payments, called\npremiums. The insurance company prices these premiums based on the probability of certain events\noccurring among a pool of people. Members of the group who then suffer a specified bad experience receive\npayments from this pool of money.\nMany people have several kinds of insurance: health insurance that pays when they receive medical care; car\ninsurance that pays if their car is in an automobile accident; house or renter\u2019s insurance that pays for stolen\npossessions or items damaged by fire; and life insurance, which pays for the family if the insured individual\ndies.Table 16.1lists a set of insurance markets.\nType of Insurance Who Pays for It?

At an obvious level,\nwe cannot predict future events with certainty. For example, we cannot know with certainty who will have a car\naccident, become ill, die, or have his home robbed in the next year. Imperfect information also applies to\nestimating the risk that something will happen to any individual. It is difficult for an insurance company to\nestimate the risk that, say, a particular 20-year-old male driver from New York City will have an accident,\nbecause even within that group, some drivers will drive more safely than others. Thus, adverse events occur\nout of a combination of people\u2019s characteristics and choices that make the risks higher or lower and then the\ngood or bad luck of what actually happens.\nHow Insurance Works\nA simplified example of automobile insurance might work this way. Suppose we divide a group of 100 drivers\ninto three groups. In a given year, 60 of those people have only a few door dings or chipped paint, which costs\n$100 each. Another 30 of the drivers have medium-sized accidents that cost an average of $1,000 in damages,\nAccess for free at openstax.org 16.2 \u2022 Insurance and Imperfect Information 395\nand 10 of the drivers have large accidents that cost $15,000 in damages. For the moment, let\u2019s imagine that at\nthe beginning of any year, there is no way of identifying the drivers who are low-risk, medium-risk, or high-\nrisk. The total damage incurred by car accidents in this group of 100 drivers will be $186,000, that is:\nIf each of the 100 drivers pays a $1,860 premium each year, the insurance company will collect the $186,000\nthat is needed to cover the costs of the accidents that occur.\nSince insurance companies have such a large number of clients, they are able to negotiate with health care and\nother service providers for lower rates than the individual would be able to get, thus increasing the benefit to\nconsumers of becoming insured and saving the insurance company itself money when it pays out claims.\nInsurance companies receive income, asFigure 16.2shows, from insurance premiums and investment\nincome. The companies derive income from investing the funds that insurance companies received in the past\nbut did not pay out as insurance claims in prior years. The insurance company receives a rate of return from\ninvesting these funds or reserves. The companies typically invest in fairly safe, liquid (easy to convert into\ncash) investments, as the insurance companies need to be able to readily access these funds when a major\ndisaster strikes.\nFIGURE16.2An Insurance Company: What Comes In, What Goes OutMoney flows into an insurance company\nthrough premiums and investments and out through the payment of claims and operating expenses.\nGovernment and Social Insurance\nFederal and state governments run a number of insurance programs. Some of the programs look much like\nprivate insurance, in the sense that the members of a group make steady payments into a fund, and those in\nthe group who suffer an adverse experience receive payments. Other programs protect against risk, but\nwithout an explicit fund set up. Following are some examples.\n\u2022 Unemployment insurance: Employers in every state pay a small amount for unemployment insurance,\nwhich goes into a fund to pay benefits to workers who lose their jobs and do not find new jobs, for a period\nof time, usually up to six months.\n\u2022 Pension insurance: Employers that offer pensions to their retired employees are required by law to pay a\nsmall fraction of what they are setting aside for pensions to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation,\nwhich pays at least some pension benefits to workers if a company goes bankrupt and cannot pay the\npensions it has promised.\n\u2022 Deposit insurance: Banks are required by law to pay a small fraction of their deposits to the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation, which goes into a fund that pays depositors the value of their bank\ndeposits up to $250,000 (the amount was raised from $100,000 to $250,000 in 2008) if the bank should go\nbankrupt.\n\u2022 Workman\u2019s compensation insurance: Employers are required by law to pay a small percentage of the\nsalaries that they pay into funds, typically run at the state level, that pay benefits to workers who suffer an\ninjury on the job.\n\u2022 Retirement insurance: All workers pay a percentage of their income into Social Security and into Medicare,\nwhich then provides income and health care benefits to the elderly. Social Security and Medicare are not 396 16 \u2022 Information, Risk, and Insurance\nliterally \u201cinsurance\u201d in the sense that those currently contributing to the fund are not eligible for benefits.\nThey function like insurance, however, in the sense that individuals make regular payments into the\nprograms today in exchange for benefits they will receive in the case of a later event\u2014either becoming old\nor becoming sick when old. A name for such programs is \u201csocial insurance.\u201d\nThe major additional costs to insurance companies, other than the payment of claims, are the costs of running\na business: the administrative costs of hiring workers, administering accounts, and processing insurance\nclaims. For most insurance companies, the insurance premiums coming in and the claims payments going out\nare much larger than the amounts earned by investing money or the administrative costs.\nThus, while factors like investment income earned on reserves, administrative costs, and groups with different\nrisks complicate the overall picture, a fundamental law of insurance must hold true: The average person\u2019s\npayments into insurance over time must cover 1) the average person\u2019s claims, 2) the costs of running the\ncompany, and 3) leave room for the firm\u2019s profits.\nRisk Groups and Actuarial Fairness\nNot all of those who purchase insurance face the same risks. Some people may be more likely, because of\ngenetics or personal habits, to fall sick with certain diseases. Some people may live in an area where car theft\nor home robbery is more likely than in other areas. Some drivers are safer than others. Arisk groupcan be\ndefined as a group that shares roughly the same risks of an adverse event occurring.\nInsurance companies often classify people into risk groups, and charge lower premiums to those with lower\nrisks. If people are not separated into risk groups, then those with low risk must pay for those with high risks.\nIn the simple example of how car insurance works, 60 drivers had very low damage of $100 each, 30 drivers\nhad medium-sized accidents that cost $1,000 each, and 10 of the drivers had large accidents that cost $15,000.\nIf all 100 of these drivers pay the same $1,860, then those with low damages are in effect paying for those with\nhigh damages.\nIf it is possible to classify drivers according to risk group, then the insurance company can charge each group\naccording to its expected losses. For example, the insurance company might charge the 60 drivers who seem\nsafest of all $100 apiece, which is the average value of the damages they cause. Then the intermediate group\ncould pay $1,000 apiece and the high-cost group $15,000 each. When the level of insurance premiums that\nsomeone pays is equal to the amount that an average person in that risk group would collect in insurance\npayments, the level of insurance is said to be \u201cactuarially fair.\u201d\nClassifying people into risk groups can be controversial. For example, if someone had a major automobile\naccident last year, should the insurance company classify that person as a high-risk driver who is likely to have\nsimilar accidents in the future, or as a low-risk driver who was just extremely unlucky? The driver is likely to\nclaim to be low-risk, and thus someone who should be in a risk group with those who pay low insurance\npremiums in the future. The insurance company is likely to believe that, on average, having a major accident is\na signal of being a high-risk driver, and thus try to charge this driver higher insurance premiums. The next two\nsections discuss the two major problems of imperfect information in insurance markets\u2014called moral hazard\nand adverse selection. Both problems arise from attempts to categorize those purchasing insurance into risk\ngroups.\nThe Moral Hazard Problem\nMoral hazardrefers to the case when people engage in riskier behavior with insurance than they would if they\ndid not have insurance. For example, if you have health insurance that covers the cost of visiting the doctor,\nyou may be less likely to take precautions against catching an illness that might require a doctor\u2019s visit. If you\nhave car insurance, you will worry less about driving or parking your car in ways that make it more likely to get\ndented. In another example, a business without insurance might install absolute top-level security and fire\nsprinkler systems to guard against theft and fire. If it is insured, that same business might only install a\nAccess for free at openstax.org 16.2 \u2022 Insurance and Imperfect Information 397\nminimum level of security and fire sprinkler systems.\nWe cannot eliminate moral hazard, but insurance companies have some ways of reducing its effect.\nInvestigations to prevent insurance fraud are one way of reducing the extreme cases of moral hazard.\nInsurance companies can also monitor certain kinds of behavior. To return to the example from above, they\nmight offer a business a lower rate on property insurance if the business installs a top-level security and fire\nsprinkler system and has those systems inspected once a year.\nAnother method to reduce moral hazard is to require the injured party to pay a share of the costs. For example,\ninsurance policies often havedeductibles, which is an amount that the insurance policyholder must pay out of\ntheir own pocket before the insurance coverage starts paying. For example, auto insurance might pay for all\nlosses greater than $500. Health insurance policies often have acopayment, in which the policyholder must\npay a small amount. For example, a person might have to pay $20 for each doctor visit, and the insurance\ncompany would cover the rest. Another method of cost sharing iscoinsurance, which means that the\ninsurance company covers a certain percentage of the cost. For example, insurance might pay for 80% of the\ncosts of repairing a home after a fire, but the homeowner would pay the other 20%.\nAll of these forms of cost sharing discourage moral hazard, because people know that they will have to pay\nsomething out of their own pocket when they make an insurance claim. The effect can be powerful. One\nprominent study found that when people face moderate deductibles and copayments for their health\ninsurance, they consume about one-third less in medical care than people who have complete insurance and\ndo not pay anything out of pocket, presumably because deductibles and copayments reduce the level of moral\nhazard. However, those who consumed less health care did not seem to have any difference in health status.\nA final way of reducing moral hazard, which is especially applicable to health care, is to focus on healthcare\nincentives of providers rather than consumers. Traditionally, most health care in the United States has been\nprovided on afee-for-servicebasis, which means that medical care providers are paid for the services they\nprovide and are paid more if they provide additional services. However, in the last decade or so, the structure\nof healthcare provision has shifted to an emphasis on health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Ahealth\nmaintenance organization (HMO)provides healthcare that receives a fixed amount per person enrolled in the\nplan\u2014regardless of how many services are provided. In this case, a patient with insurance has an incentive to\ndemand more care, but the healthcare provider, which is receiving only a fixed payment, has an incentive to\nreduce the moral hazard problem by limiting the quantity of care provided\u2014as long as it will not lead to worse\nhealth problems and higher costs later. Today, many doctors are paid with some combination of managed care\nand fee-for-service; that is, a flat amount per patient, but with additional payments for the treatment of certain\nhealth conditions.\nImperfect information is the cause of the moral hazard problem. If an insurance company had perfect\ninformation on risk, it could simply raise its premiums every time an insured party engages in riskier\nbehavior. However, an insurance company cannot monitor all the risks that people take all the time and so,\neven with various checks and cost sharing, moral hazard will remain a problem.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/healtheconomics)to read about the relationship between health care\nand behavioral economics.\nThe Adverse Selection Problem\nAdverse selectionrefers to the problem in which insurance buyers have more information about whether they\nare high-risk or low-risk than the insurance company does. This creates an asymmetric information problem\nfor the insurance company because buyers who are high-risk tend to want to buy more insurance, without\nletting the insurance company know about their higher risk. For example, someone purchasing health 398 16 \u2022 Information, Risk, and Insurance\ninsurance or life insurance probably knows more about their family\u2019s health history than an insurer can\nreasonably find out even with a costly investigation. Someone purchasing car insurance may know that they\nare a high-risk driver who has not yet had a major accident\u2014but it is hard for the insurance company to collect\ninformation about how people actually drive.\nTo understand how adverse selection can strangle an insurance market, recall the situation of 100 drivers who\nare buying automobile insurance, where 60 drivers had very low damages of $100 each, 30 drivers had\nmedium-sized accidents that cost $1,000 each, and 10 of the drivers had large accidents that cost $15,000.\nThat would equal $186,000 in total payouts by the insurance company. Imagine that, while the insurance\ncompany knows the overall size of the losses, it cannot identify the high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk\ndrivers. However, the drivers themselves know their risk groups. Since there is asymmetric information\nbetween the insurance company and the drivers, the insurance company would likely set the price of\ninsurance at $1,860 per year, to cover the average loss (not including the cost of overhead and profit). The\nresult is that those with low risks of only $100 will likely decide not to buy insurance; after all, it makes no\nsense for them to pay $1,860 per year when they are likely only to experience losses of $100. Those with\nmedium risks of a $1,000 accident will not buy insurance either. Therefore, the insurance company ends up\nonly selling insurance for $1,860 to high-risk drivers who will average $15,000 in claims apiece, and as a\nconsequence, the insurance company ends up losing considerable money. If the insurance company tries to\nraise its premiums to cover the losses of those with high risks, then those with low or medium risks will be\neven more discouraged from buying insurance.\nRather than face such a situation of adverse selection, the insurance company may decide not to sell insurance\nin thismarketat all. If potential buyers are to receive insurance, then one of two things must happen. First, the\ninsurance company might find some way of separating insurance buyers into risk groups with some degree of\naccuracy and charging them accordingly, which in practice often means that the insurance company tries not\nto sell insurance to those who may pose high risks. Another scenario is that those with low risks must buy\ninsurance, even if they have to pay more than the actuarially fair amount for their risk group. The notion that\npeople can be required to purchase insurance raises the issue of government laws and regulations that\ninfluence the insurance industry.\nU.S. Health Care in an International Context\nThe United States is the only high-income country in the world where private firms pay and provide for most\nhealth insurance. Greater government involvement in the provision of health insurance is one possible way of\naddressing moral hazard and adverse selection problems.\nThe moral hazard problem with health insurance is that when people have insurance, they will demand higher\nquantities of health care. In the United States, private healthcare insurance tends to encourage an ever-greater\ndemand for healthcare services, which healthcare providers are happy to fulfill.Table 16.2shows that on a\nper-person basis, U.S. healthcare spending towers above healthcare spending of other countries. Note that\nwhile healthcare expenditures in the United States are far higher than healthcare expenditures in other\ncountries, the health outcomes in the United States, as measured by life expectancy and lower rates of\nchildhood mortality, tend to be lower. Health outcomes, however, may not be significantly affected by\nhealthcare expenditures. Many studies have shown that a country\u2019s health is more closely related to diet,\nexercise, and genetic factors than to healthcare expenditure. This fact further emphasizes that the United\nStates is spending very large amounts on medical care with little obvious health gain.\nIn the U.S. health insurance market, the main way of solving this adverse selection problem is that health\ninsurance is often sold through groups based on place of employment, or, under The Affordable Care Act, from\na state government sponsored health exchange market. From an insurance company\u2019s point of view, selling\ninsurance through an employer mixes together a group of people\u2014some with high risks of future health\nproblems and some with lower risks\u2014and thus reduces the insurance firm\u2019s fear of attracting only those who\nhave high risks. However, many small companies do not provide health insurance to their employees, and\nAccess for free at openstax.org 16.2 \u2022 Insurance and Imperfect Information 399\nmany lower-paying jobs do not include health insurance. Even after we take into account all U.S. government\nprograms that provide health insurance for the elderly and people experiencing poverty, approximately 31\nmillion Americans were without health insurance in 2020. While a government-controlled system can avoid\nthe adverse selection problem entirely by providing at least basic health insurance for all, another option is to\nmandate that all Americans buy health insurance from some provider by preventing providers from denying\nindividuals based on preexisting conditions. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act adopted this\napproach, which we will discuss later on in this chapter.\nHealth Care\nLife Expectancy at Life Expectancy at Infant Mortality Rate (Male &\nCountry Spending per\nBirth (Male) Birth (Female) Female), per 1,000\nPerson\nUnited\n$10,948 75.5 80.2 5.7\nStates\nGermany $6,731 79.0 83.7 3.2\nFrance $5,564 79.2 85.3 3.5\nCanada $5,370 80.0 84.2 4.4\nUnited\n$5,268 78.4 82.4 3.7\nKingdom\nTABLE16.2A Comparison of Health Care Spending per Person, Life Expectancy at Birth, and Infant Mortality,\n2020(Source: 2020 OECD study and World Fact Book)\nAt its best, the largely private U.S. system of health insurance and healthcare delivery provides an\nextraordinarily high quality of care, along with generating a seemingly endless parade of life-saving\ninnovations. However, the system also struggles to control its high costs and to provide basic medical care to\nall. Compared to the United States, other countries have lower costs, more equal access, and better mortality\noutcomes, but they often struggle to provide rapid access to health care and to offer the near-miracles of the\nmost up-to-date medical care. The challenge is a healthcare system that strikes the right balance between\nquality, access, and cost.\nGovernment Regulation of Insurance\nThe U.S. insurance industry is primarily regulated at the state level. Since 1871 there has been aNational\nAssociation of Insurance Commissionersthat brings together these state regulators to exchange information\nand strategies. The state insurance regulators typically attempt to accomplish two things: to keep the price of\ninsurance low and to ensure that everyone has insurance. These goals, however, can conflict with each other\nand also become easily entangled in politics.\nIf insurance premiums are set at actuarially fair levels, so that people end up paying an amount that accurately\nreflects their risk group, certain people will end up paying considerable amounts. For example, if health\ninsurance companies were trying to cover people who already have a chronic disease like AIDS, or who were\nelderly, they would charge these groups very high premiums for health insurance, because their expected\nhealth care costs are quite high. Women in the age bracket 18\u201344 consume, on average, about 65% more in\nhealth care spending than men. Young male drivers have more car accidents than young female drivers. Thus,\nactuarially fair insurance would tend to charge young men much more for car insurance than young women.\nBecause people in high-risk groups would find themselves charged so heavily for insurance, they might choose\nnot to buy insurance at all. 400 16 \u2022 Information, Risk, and Insurance\nState insurance regulators have sometimes reacted by passing rules that attempt to set low premiums for\ninsurance. Over time, however, the fundamental law of insurance must hold: the average amount individuals\nreceive cannot exceed the average amount paid in premiums. When rules are passed to keep premiums low,\ninsurance companies try to avoid insuring any high-risk or even medium-risk parties. If a state legislature\npasses strict rules requiring insurance companies to sell to everyone at low prices, the insurance companies\nalways have the option of withdrawing from doing business in that state. For example, the insurance regulators\nin New Jersey are well-known for attempting to keep auto insurance premiums low, and more than 20\ndifferent insurance companies stopped doing business in the state in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Similarly,\nin 2009, State Farm announced that it was withdrawing from selling property insurance in Florida.\nIn short, government regulators cannot force companies to charge low prices and provide high levels of\ninsurance coverage\u2014and thus take losses\u2014for a sustained period of time. If insurance premiums are set below\nthe actuarially fair level for a certain group, some other group will have to make up the difference. There are\ntwo other groups who can make up the difference: taxpayers or other insurance buyers.\nIn some industries, the U.S. government has decided free markets will not provide insurance at an affordable\nprice, and so the government pays for it directly. For example, private health insurance is too expensive for\nmany people whose incomes are too low. To combat this, the U.S. government, together with the states, runs\nthe Medicaid program, which provides health care to those with low incomes. Private health insurance also\ndoes not work well for the elderly, because their average health care costs can be very high. Thus, the U.S.\ngovernment started the Medicare program, which provides health insurance to all those over age 65. Other\ngovernment-funded health-care programs are aimed at military veterans, as an added benefit, and children in\nfamilies with relatively low incomes.\nAnother common government intervention in insurance markets is to require that everyone buy certain kinds\nof insurance. For example, most states legally require car owners to buy auto insurance. Likewise, when a bank\nloans someone money to buy a home, the person is typically required to have homeowner\u2019s insurance, which\nprotects against fire and other physical damage (like hailstorms) to the home. A legal requirement that\neveryone must buy insurance means that insurance companies do not need to worry that those with low risks\nwill avoid buying insurance. Since insurance companies do not need to fear adverse selection, they can set\ntheir prices based on an average for the market, and those with lower risks will, to some extent, end up\nsubsidizing those with higher risks. However, even when laws are passed requiring people to purchase\ninsurance, insurance companies cannot be compelled to sell insurance to everyone who asks\u2014at least not at\nlow cost. Thus, insurance companies will still try to avoid selling insurance to those with high risks whenever\npossible.\nThe government cannot pass laws that make the problems of moral hazard and adverse selection disappear,\nbut the government can make political decisions that certain groups should have insurance, even though the\nprivate market would not otherwise provide that insurance. Also, the government can impose the costs of that\ndecision on taxpayers or on other buyers of insurance.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\nIn March of 2010, President Obama signed into law thePatient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).\nThe government started to phase in this highly contentious law over time starting in October of 2013. The goal\nof the act is to bring the United States closer to universal coverage. Some of the key features of the plan include:\n\u2022 Individual mandate: All individuals, who do not receive health care through their employer or through a\ngovernment program (for example, Medicare), were required to have health insurance or pay a fine. The\nindividual mandate's goal was to reduce the adverse selection problem and keep prices down by requiring\nall consumers\u2014even the healthiest ones\u2014to have health insurance. Without the need to guard against\nadverse selection (whereby only the riskiest consumers buy insurance) by raising prices, health insurance\ncompanies could provide more reasonable plans to their customers. At the beginning of 2019, the fine for\nAccess for free at openstax.org 16.2 \u2022 Insurance and Imperfect Information 401\nnot having health insurance was eliminated.\n\u2022 Each state is required to have health insurance exchanges, or utilize the federal exchange, whereby\ninsurance companies compete for business. The goal of the exchanges is to improve competition in the\nmarket for health insurance.\n\u2022 Employer mandate: All employers with more than 50 employees must offer health insurance to their\nemployees.\nTheAffordable Care Act (ACA)is funded through additional taxes that include:\n\u2022 Increasing the Medicare tax by 0.9 percent and adding a 3.8 percent tax on unearned income for high\nincome taxpayers.\n\u2022 Charging an annual fee on health insurance providers.\n\u2022 Imposing other taxes such as a 2.3% tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices.\nMany people and politicians, including Donald Trump, have sought to overturn the bill. Those who oppose the\nbill believe it violates an individual\u2019s right to choose whether to have insurance or not. In 2012, a number of\nstates challenged the law on the basis that the individual mandate provision is unconstitutional. In June 2012,\nthe U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 5\u20134 decision that the individual mandate is actually a tax, so it is\nconstitutional as the federal government has the right to tax the populace. At the same time, some of the taxes\nthat were implemented as part of the ACA have been eliminated.\nBRING IT HOME\nWhat\u2019s the Big Deal with Obamacare?\nWhat is it that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will actually do? To begin with, we should note that it is a massively\ncomplex law, with a large number of parts, some of which the Obama administration implemented immediately, and\nothers that the government is supposed to phase in every year from 2013 through 2020. Three of these parts are\ncoverage for the uninsured\u2014those without health insurance, coverage for individuals with preexisting conditions,\nand the so-called employer and individual mandates, which require employers to offer and people to purchase\nhealth insurance. Under the Trump administration, several components of the ACA were repealed or overhauled,\nwhile under the Biden administration (and with the support of a majority of the population) the ACA has continued\nas a major element in provision of health care in the United States.\nAs we noted in the chapter, people face ever-increasing healthcare costs in the United States. Over the years, the\nranks of the uninsured in the United States have grown as rising prices have pushed employers and individuals out\nof the market. Insurance companies have increasingly used pre-existing medical conditions to determine if\nsomeone is high risk, for whom insurance companies either charge higher prices, or they choose to deny insurance\ncoverage to these individuals. Whatever the cause, we noted at the beginning of the chapter that prior to the ACA,\nmore than 32 million Americans were uninsured. People who are uninsured tend to use emergency rooms for\ntreatment\u2014the most expensive form of healthcare, which has contributed significantly to rising costs.\nThe ACA introduced regulations designed to control increases in healthcare costs. One example is a cap on the\namount healthcare providers can spend on administrative costs. Another is a requirement that healthcare providers\nswitch to electronic medical records (EMRs), which will reduce administrative costs.\nThe ACA required that states establish health insurance exchanges, or markets, where people without health\ninsurance, and businesses that do not provide it for their employees, can shop for different insurance plans. The\npurpose of these exchanges was to increase competition in insurance markets and thus reduce prices of policies.\nFinally, the ACA mandated that people with preexisting conditions could no longer be denied health insurance. The\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates that the those without insurance in the US has fallen from\n20.3% in 2012 to 11.5% in 2016. Accordingly, 20 million Americans gained coverage under the ACA. According to\nthe Census, as of 2020, the share of the population without health insurance had fallen to 8.6%. So the ACA has 402 16 \u2022 Information, Risk, and Insurance\nresulted in a decline in the percentage of Americans without health insurance by almost 60%.\nWhat was the cost of this increased coverage and how was it paid? An insurance policy works by insuring against the\npossibility of needing healthcare. If there are high risk individuals in the insurance pool, the pool must be expanded\nto include enough low risk individuals to keep average premiums affordable. To that end, the ACA imposed the\nindividual mandate, requiring all individuals to purchase insurance (or pay a penalty) whether they were high risk or\nnot. Many young adults would choose to skip health insurance since the likelihood of their needing significant\nhealthcare is small. The individual mandate brought in a significant amount of money to pay for the ACA. However,\ndespite the elimination of the penalty for not having insurance, ACA coverage has continued to increase. In addition,\nthere were three other funding sources. The ACA took $716 billion which otherwise would have gone to Medicare\nspending. The ACA also increased the Medicare tax that wealthy Americans paid by an additional 0.9%. Despite\nthese funding sources, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the ACA will increase the federal debt by\n$137 billion over the next decade.\nThe impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has been a rise in Americans with health insurance.\nHowever, due to the increased taxes to pay for the ACA and the increased deficit spending, the ACA faces continued\nopposition. The Trump administration vowed to repeal it on the campaign trail but no alternative bill has made its\nway before congress. Only time will tell if the Affordable Care Act will leave a legacy or will quickly be swept by the\nwayside, jeopardizing the 20 million newly insured Americans.\nAt the time of this writing, the final impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is not clear. Millions of\npreviously uninsured Americans now have coverage, but the increased taxes to pay for ACA and increased deficit\nspending have created significant political opposition.

When information about\nthe quality of products is highly imperfect, it may be difficult for a market to exist.\nA \u201clemon\u201d is a product that turns out, after the purchase, to have low quality. When the seller has more\naccurate information about the product's quality than the buyer, the buyer will be hesitant to buy, out of fear of\npurchasing a \u201clemon.\u201d\nMarkets have many ways to deal with imperfect information. In goods markets, buyers facing imperfect\ninformation about products may depend upon money-back guarantees, warranties, service contracts, and\nreputation. In labor markets, employers facing imperfect information about potential employees may turn to\nresumes, recommendations, occupational licenses for certain jobs, and employment for trial periods. In\ncapital markets, lenders facing imperfect information about borrowers may require detailed loan applications\nand credit checks, cosigners, and collateral. 404 16 \u2022 Self-Check Questions\n16.2Insurance and Imperfect Information\nInsurance is a way of sharing risk. People in a group pay premiums for insurance against some unpleasant\nevent, and those in the group who actually experience the unpleasant event then receive some compensation.\nThe fundamental law of insurance is that what the average person pays in over time cannot be less than what\nthe average person gets out. In an actuarially fair insurance policy, the premiums that a person pays to the\ninsurance company are the same as the average amount of benefits for a person in that risk group. Moral\nhazard arises in insurance markets because those who are insured against a risk will have less reason to take\nsteps to avoid the costs from that risk.\nMany insurance policies have deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance. A deductible is the maximum amount\nthat the policyholder must pay out-of-pocket before the insurance company pays the rest of the bill. A\ncopayment is a flat fee that an insurance policy-holder must pay before receiving services. Coinsurance\nrequires the policyholder to pay a certain percentage of costs. Deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance\nreduce moral hazard by requiring the insured party to bear some of the costs before collecting insurance\nbenefits.\nIn a fee-for-service health financing system, medical care providers receive reimbursement according to the\ncost of services they provide. An alternative method of organizing health care is through health maintenance\norganizations (HMOs), where medical care providers receive reimbursement according to the number of\npatients they handle, and it is up to the providers to allocate resources between patients who receive more or\nfewer health care services. Adverse selection arises in insurance markets when insurance buyers know more\nabout the risks they face than does the insurance company. As a result, the insurance company runs the risk\nthat low-risk parties will avoid its insurance because it is too costly for them, while high-risk parties will\nembrace it because it looks like a good deal to them.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

That means that the market prices of homes,\nless what was still owed on the loans they used to buy these houses, equaled $13 trillion. This was a very good\nnumber, since the equity represented the value of the financial asset most U.S. citizens owned.\nHowever, by 2008 this number declined to $8.8 trillion, and it plummeted further still in 2009. Combined with the\ndecline in value of other financial assets held by U.S. citizens, by 2010, U.S. homeowners\u2019 wealth had shrunk $14\ntrillion! This is a staggering result, and it affected millions of lives: people had to alter their retirement, housing, and\nother important consumption decisions. Just about every other large economy in the world suffered a decline in the\nmarket value of financial assets, as a result of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.\nThis chapter will explain why people purchase houses (other than as a place to live), why they buy other types of 408 17 \u2022 Financial Markets\nfinancial assets, and why businesses sell those financial assets in the first place. The chapter will also give us insight\ninto why financial markets and assets go through boom and bust cycles like the one we described here.\nWhen a firm needs to buy new equipment or build a new facility, it often must go to the financial market to\nraise funds. Usually firms will add capacity during an economic expansion when profits are on the rise and\nconsumer demand is high. Business investment is one of the critical ingredients needed to sustain economic\ngrowth. Even in the sluggish 2009 economy, U.S. firms invested $1.4 trillion in new equipment and structures,\nin the hope that these investments would generate profits in the years ahead.\nBetween the end of the recession in 2009 through the second quarter 2013, profits for the S&P 500 companies\ngrew by 9.7% despite the weak economy, with cost cutting and reductions in input costs driving much of that\namount, according to theWall Street Journal.Figure 17.2shows corporate profits after taxes (adjusted for\ninventory and capital consumption). Despite the steep decline in quarterly net profit in 2008, profits have\nrecovered and surpassed pre-recession levels.\nFIGURE17.2Corporate Profits After Tax (Adjusted for Inventory and Capital Consumption)Prior to 2008, corporate\nprofits after tax more often than not increased each year. There was a significant drop in profits during 2008 and into\n2009. The profit trend has since continued to increase each year, though at a less steady or consistent rate. (Source:\nFederal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/CPATAX)\nMany firms, from huge companies like General Motors to startup firms writing computer software, do not have\nthe financial resources within the firm to make all the desired investments. These firms need financial capital\nfrom outside investors, and they are willing to pay interest for the opportunity to obtain a rate of return on the\ninvestment of that financial capital.\nOn the other side of the financial capital market, financial capital suppliers, like households, wish to use their\nsavings in a way that will provide a return. Individuals cannot, however, take the few thousand dollars that they\nsave in any given year, write a letter to General Motors or some other firm, and negotiate to invest their money\nwith that firm.Financial capital marketsbridge this gap: that is, they find ways to take the inflow of funds from\nmany separate financial capital suppliers and transform it into the funds of financial capital demanders desire.\nSuch financial markets include stocks, bonds, bank loans, and other financial investments.\nClick to view content(https://openstax.org/books/principles-economics-3e/pages/17-introduction-to-\nfinancial-markets)\nCorporate Profits After Tax (Adjusted for Inventory and Capital Consumption)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 17.1 \u2022 How Businesses Raise Financial Capital 409\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/marketoverview)to read more about financial markets.\nOur perspective then shifts to consider how these financial investments appear to capital suppliers such as the\nhouseholds that are saving funds.

Finally, the chapter investigates two methods for becoming rich: a quick and easy\nmethod that does not work very well at all, and a slow, reliable method that can work very well over a lifetime.\n17.1How Businesses Raise Financial Capital\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Describe financial capital and how it relates to profits\n\u2022 Discuss the purpose and process of borrowing, bonds, and corporate stock\n\u2022 Explain how firms choose between sources of financial capital\nFirms often make decisions that involve spending money in the present and expecting to earn profits in the\nfuture. Examples include when afirmbuys a machine that will last 10 years, or builds a new plant that will last\nfor 30 years, or starts a research and development project. Firms can raise the financial capital they need to\npay for such projects in four main ways: (1) from early-stage investors; (2) by reinvesting profits; (3) by\nborrowing through banks or bonds; and (4) by selling stock. When business owners choose financial capital\nsources, they also choose how to pay for them.\nEarly-Stage Financial Capital\nFirms that are just beginning often have an idea or a prototype for a product or service to sell, but few\ncustomers, or even no customers at all, and thus are not earning profits. Such firms face a difficult problem\nwhen it comes to raising financial capital: How can a firm that has not yet demonstrated any ability to earn\nprofits pay a rate of return to financial investors?\nFor many small businesses, the original source of money is the business owner. Someone who decides to start\na restaurant or a gas station, for instance, might cover the startup costs by dipping into their own bank\naccount, or by borrowing money (perhaps using a home as collateral). Alternatively, many cities have a\nnetwork of well-to-do individuals, known as \u201cangel investors,\u201d who will put their own money into small new\ncompanies at an early development stage, in exchange for owning some portion of the firm.\nVenture capitalfirms make financial investments in new companies that are still relatively small in size, but\nthat have potential to grow substantially. These firms gather money from a variety of individual or institutional\ninvestors, including banks, institutions like college endowments, insurance companies that hold financial\nreserves, and corporate pension funds. Venture capital firms do more than just supply money to small\nstartups. They also provide advice on potential products, customers, and key employees. Typically, a venture\ncapital fund invests in a number of firms, and then investors in that fund receive returns according to how the\nfund as a whole performs.\nThe amount of money invested in venture capital fluctuates substantially from year to year: as one example,\nventure capital firms invested more than $48.3 billion in 2014, according to theNational Venture Capital\nAssociation. All early-stage investors realize that the majority of small startup businesses will never hit it big;\nmany of them will go out of business within a few months or years. They also know that getting in on the\nground floor of a few huge successes like a Netflix or an Amazon.com can make up for multiple failures.\nTherefore, early-stage investors are willing to take large risks in order to position themselves to gain\nsubstantial returns on their investment. 410 17 \u2022 Financial Markets\nProfits as a Source of Financial Capital\nIf firms are earning profits (their revenues are greater than costs), they can choose to reinvest some of these\nprofits in equipment, structures, and research and development. For many established companies, reinvesting\ntheir own profits is one primary source of financial capital. Companies and firms just getting started may have\nnumerous attractive investment opportunities, but few current profits to invest. Even large firms can\nexperience a year or two of earning low profits or even suffering losses, but unless the firm can find a steady\nand reliable financial capital source so that it can continue making real investments in tough times, the firm\nmay not survive until better times arrive. Firms often need to find financial capital sources other than profits.\nBorrowing: Banks and Bonds\nWhen a firm has a record of at least earning significant revenues, and better still of earning profits, the firm\ncan make a credible promise to pay interest, and so it becomes possible for the firm to borrow money. Firms\nhave two main borrowing methods: banks and bonds.\nA bank loan for a firm works in much the same way as a loan for an individual who is buying a car or a house.\nThe firm borrows an amount of money and then promises to repay it, including some rate of interest, over a\npredetermined period of time. If the firm fails to make its loan payments, the bank (or banks) can often take\nthe firm to court and require it to sell its buildings or equipment to make the loan payments.\nAnother source of financial capital is a bond. Abondis a financial contract: a borrower agrees to repay the\namount that it borrowed and also an interest rate over a period of time in the future. Acorporate bondis\nissued by firms, but bonds are also issued by various levels of government. For example, amunicipal bondis\nissued by cities, a state bond by U.S. states, and aTreasury bondby the federal government through theU.S.\nDepartment of the Treasury. A bond specifies an amount that one will borrow, the interest rate that one will\npay, and the time until repayment.\nA large company, for example, might issue bonds for $10 million. The firm promises to make interest\npayments at an annual rate of 8%, or $800,000 per year and then, after 10 years, will repay the $10 million it\noriginally borrowed. When a firm issues bonds, it may choose to issue many bonds in smaller amounts that\ntogether reach the total amount it wishes to raise. A firm that seeks to borrow $50 million by issuing bonds,\nmight actually issue 10,000 bonds of $5,000 each. In this way, an individual investor could, in effect, loan the\nfirm $5,000, or any multiple of that amount. Anyone who owns a bond and receives the interest payments is\ncalled abondholder. If a firm issues bonds and fails to make the promised interest payments, the bondholders\ncan take the firm to court and require it to pay, even if the firm needs to raise the money by selling buildings or\nequipment. However, there is no guarantee the firm will have sufficient assets to pay off the bonds. The\nbondholders may recoup only a portion of what they loaned the firm.\nBank borrowing is more customized than issuing bonds, so it often works better for relatively small firms. The\nbank can get to know the firm extremely well\u2014often because the bank can monitor sales and expenses quite\naccurately by looking at deposits and withdrawals. Relatively large and well-known firms often issue bonds\ninstead. They use bonds to raise new financial capital that pays for investments, or to raise capital to pay off\nold bonds, or to buy other firms. However, the idea that firms or individuals use banks for relatively smaller\nloans and bonds for larger loans is not an ironclad rule: sometimes groups of banks make large loans and\nsometimes relatively small and lesser-known firms issue bonds.\nCorporate Stock and Public Firms\nAcorporationis a business that \u201cincorporates\u201d\u2014that is owned by shareholders that have limited liability for\nthe company's debt but share in its profits (and losses). Corporations may be private or public, and may or may\nnot have publicly traded stock. They may raise funds to finance their operations or new investments by raising\ncapital through selling stock or issuing bonds.\nThose who buy the stock become the firm's owners, orshareholders.Stockrepresents firm ownership; that is,\nAccess for free at openstax.org 17.1 \u2022 How Businesses Raise Financial Capital 411\na person who owns 100% of a company\u2019s stock, by definition, owns the entire company. The company's stock\nis divided intoshares. Corporate giants like IBM, AT&T, Ford, General Electric, Microsoft, Merck, and Exxon all\nhave millions of stock shares. In most large and well-known firms, no individual owns a majority of the stock\nshares. Instead, large numbers of shareholders\u2014even those who hold thousands of shares\u2014each have only a\nsmall slice of the firm's overall ownership.\nWhen a large number of shareholders own a company, there are three questions to ask:\n1. How and when does the company obtain money from its sale of stock?\n2. What rate of return does the company promise to pay when it sells stock?\n3. Who makes decisions in a company owned by a large number of shareholders?\nFirst, a firm receives money from the stock sale only when the company sells its own stock to the public (the\npublic includes individuals, mutual funds, insurance companies, and pension funds). We call a firm\u2019s first\nstock sale to the public aninitial public offering (IPO). The IPO is important for two reasons. For one, the IPO,\nand any stock issued thereafter, such as stock held as treasury stock (shares that a company keeps in their own\ntreasury) or new stock issued later as a secondary offering, provides the funds to repay the early-stage\ninvestors, like the angel investors and the venture capital firms. A venture capital firm may have a 40%\nownership in the firm. When the firm sells stock, the venture capital firm sells its part ownership of the firm to\nthe public. A second reason for the importance of the IPO is that it provides the established company with\nfinancial capital for substantially expanding its operations.\nHowever, most of the time when one buys and sells corporate stock the firm receives no financial return at all.\nIf you buy General Motors stock, you almost certainly buy it from the current share owner, and General Motors\ndoes not receive any of your money. This pattern should not seem particularly odd. After all, if you buy a house,\nthe current owner receives your money, not the original house builder. Similarly, when you buy stock shares,\nyou are buying a small slice of the firm's ownership from the existing owner\u2014and the firm that originally\nissued the stock is not a part of this transaction.\nSecond, when a firm decides to issue stock, it must recognize that investors will expect to receive a rate of\nreturn. That rate of return can come in two forms. A firm can make a direct payment to its shareholders, called\nadividend. Alternatively, a financial investor might buy a share of stock in Wal-Mart for $45 and then later sell\nit to someone else for $60, for $15 gain. We call the increase in the stock value (or of any asset) between when\none buys and sells it acapital gain.\nThird: Who makes the decisions about when a firm will issue stock, or pay dividends, or re-invest profits? To\nunderstand the answers to these questions, it is useful to separate firms into two groups: private and public.\nAprivate companyis frequently owned by the people who generally run it on a day-to-day basis. Individuals\ncan run a private company. We call this asole proprietorship. If a group runs it, we call it apartnership. A\nprivate company can also be a corporation, but with no publicly issued stock. A small law firm run by one\nperson, even if it employs some other lawyers, would be a sole proprietorship. Partners may jointly own a\nlarger law firm. Most private companies are relatively small, but there are some large private corporations,\nwith tens of billions of dollars in annual sales, that do not have publicly issued stock, such as farm products\ndealer Cargill, the Mars candy company, and the Bechtel engineering and construction firm.\nWhen a firm decides to sell stock, which financial investors can buy and sell, we call it apublic company.\nShareholders own a public company. Since the shareholders are a very broad group, often consisting of\nthousands or even millions of investors, the shareholders vote for a board of directors, who in turn hire top\nexecutives to run the firm on a day-to-day basis. The more stock a shareholder owns, the more votes that\nshareholder is entitled to cast for the company\u2019s board of directors.\nIn theory, the board of directors helps to ensure that the firm runs in the interests of the true owners\u2014the\nshareholders. However, the top executives who run the firm have a strong voice in choosing the candidates 412 17 \u2022 Financial Markets\nwho will serve on their board of directors. After all, few shareholders are knowledgeable enough or have\nenough personal incentive to spend energy and money nominating alternative board members.\nHow Firms Choose between Financial Capital Sources\nThere are clear patterns in how businesses raise financial capital. We can explain these patterns in terms of\nimperfect information, which as we discussed inInformation, Risk, and Insurance, is a situation where buyers\nand sellers in a market do not both have full and equal information. Those who are actually running a firm will\nalmost always have more information about whether the firm is likely to earn profits in the future than outside\ninvestors who provide financial capital.\nAny young startup firm is a risk. Some startup firms are only a little more than an idea on paper. The firm\u2019s\nfounders inevitably have better information than anyone else about how hard they are willing to work, and\nwhether the firm is likely to succeed. When the founders invested their own money into the firm, they\ndemonstrate a belief in its prospects. At this early stage, angel investors and venture capitalists try to\novercome the imperfect information, at least in part, by knowing the managers and their business plan\npersonally and by giving them advice.\nAccurate information is sometimes not available becausecorporate governance, the name economists give to\nthe institutions that are supposed to watch over top executives, fails, as the following Clear It Up feature on\nLehman Brothers shows.\nCLEAR IT UP\nHow did lack of corporate governance lead to the Lehman Brothers failure?\nIn 2008, Lehman Brothers was the fourth largest U.S. investment bank, with 25,000 employees. The firm had been\nin business for 164 years. On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\nThere are many causes of the Lehman Brothers failure. One area of apparent failure was the lack of oversight by the\nBoard of Directors to keep managers from undertaking excessive risk. We can attribute part of the oversight failure,\naccording to Tim Geithner\u2019s April 10, 2010, testimony to Congress, to the Executive Compensation Committee\u2019s\nemphasis on short-term gains without enough consideration of the risks. In addition, according to the court\nexaminer\u2019s report, the Lehman Brother\u2019s Board of Directors paid too little attention to the details of the operations\nof Lehman Brothers and also had limited financial service experience.\nThe board of directors, elected by the shareholders, is supposed to be the first line of corporate governance and\noversight for top executives. A second institution of corporate governance is the auditing firm the company hires to\nreview the company's financial records and certify that everything looks reasonable. A third institution of corporate\ngovernance is outside investors, especially large shareholders like those who invest large mutual funds or pension\nfunds. In the case of Lehman Brothers, corporate governance failed to provide investors with accurate financial\ninformation about the firm\u2019s operations.\nAs a firm becomes at least somewhat established and its strategy appears likely to lead to profits in the near\nfuture, knowing the individual managers and their business plans on a personal basis becomes less important,\nbecause information has become more widely available regarding the company\u2019s products, revenues, costs,\nand profits. As a result, other outside investors who do not know the managers personally, like bondholders\nand shareholders, are more willing to provide financial capital to the firm.\nAt this point, a firm must often choose how to access financial capital. It may choose to borrow from a bank,\nissue bonds, or issue stock. The great disadvantage of borrowing money from a bank or issuing bonds is that\nthe firm commits to scheduled interest payments, whether or not it has sufficient income. The great advantage\nof borrowing money is that the firm maintains control of its operations and is not subject to shareholders.\nIssuing stock involves selling off company ownership to the public and becoming responsible to a board of\nAccess for free at openstax.org 17.2 \u2022 How Households Supply Financial Capital 413\ndirectors and the shareholders.\nThe benefit of issuing stock is that a small and growing firm increases its visibility in the financial markets and\ncan access large amounts of financial capital for expansion, without worrying about repaying this money. If the\nfirm is successful and profitable, the board of directors will need to decide upon a dividend payout or how to\nreinvest profits to further grow the company. Issuing and placing stock is expensive, requires the expertise of\ninvestment bankers and attorneys, and entails compliance with reporting requirements to shareholders and\ngovernment agencies, such as the federal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n17.2How Households Supply Financial Capital\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Show the relationship between savers, banks, and borrowers\n\u2022 Calculate bond yield\n\u2022 Contrast bonds, stocks, mutual funds, and assets\n\u2022 Explain the tradeoffs between return and risk\nThe ways in which firms would prefer to raise funds are only half the story of financial markets. The other half\nis what those households and individuals who supply funds desire, and how they perceive the available\nchoices. The focus of our discussion now shifts from firms on the demand side of financial capital markets to\nhouseholds on the supply side of those markets. We can divide the mechanisms for savings available to\nhouseholds into several categories: deposits in bank accounts; bonds; stocks; money market mutual funds;\nstock and bond mutual funds; and housing and other tangible assets like owning gold. We need to analyze each\nof these investments in terms of three factors: (1) the expected rate of return it will pay; (2) the risk that the\nreturn will be much lower or higher than expected; and (3) the investment'sliquidity, which refers to how\neasily one can exchange money or financial assets for a good or service. We will do this analysis as we discuss\neach of these investments in the sections below. First, however, we need to understand the difference between\nexpected rate of return, risk, and actual rate of return.\nExpected Rate of Return, Risk, and Actual Rate of Return\nTheexpected rate of returnrefers to how much a project or an investment is expected to return to the\ninvestor, either in future interest payments, capital gains, or increased profitability. It is usually the average\nreturn over a period of time, usually in years or even decades. We normally measure it as a percentage rate.\nRiskmeasures the uncertainty of that project\u2019s profitability. There are several types of risk, including default\nrisk and interest rate risk. Default risk, as its name suggests, is the risk that the borrower fails to pay back the\nbond or loan. Interest rate risk is the danger that you might buy a long term bond at a 6% interest rate right\nbefore market rates suddenly rise, so had you waited, you could have received a similar bond that paid 9%. A\nhigh-risk investment is one for which a wide range of potential payoffs is reasonably probable. A low-risk\ninvestment may have actual returns that are fairly close to its expected rate of return year after year. A high-\nrisk investment will have actual returns that are much higher than the expected rate of return in some months\nor years and much lower in other months or years. Theactual rate of returnrefers to the total rate of return,\nincluding capital gains and interest paid on an investment at the end of a time period.\nBank Accounts\nAn intermediary is one who stands between two other parties. For example, a person who arranges a blind\ndate between two other people is one kind of intermediary. In financial capital markets, banks are an example\nof afinancial intermediary\u2014that is, an institution that operates between a saver who deposits funds in a bank\nand a borrower who receives a loan from that bank. When a bank serves as a financial intermediary, unlike the\nsituation with a couple on a blind date, the saver and the borrower never meet. In fact, it is not even possible to\nmake direct connections between those who deposit funds in banks and those who borrow from banks,\nbecause all deposited funds end up in one big pool, which the financial institution then lends out. 414 17 \u2022 Financial Markets\nFigure 17.3illustrates the position of banks as a financial intermediary, with a pattern of deposits flowing into\na bank and loans flowing out, and then repayment of the loans flowing back to the bank, with interest\npayments for the original savers.\nFIGURE17.3Banks as Financial IntermediariesBanks are a financial intermediary because they stand between\nsavers and borrowers. Savers place deposits with banks, and then receive interest payments and withdraw money.\nBorrowers receive loans from banks, and repay the loans with interest.\nBanks offer a range of accounts to serve different needs. Achecking accounttypically pays little or no interest,\nbut it facilitates transactions by giving you easy access to your money, either by writing a check or by using a\ndebit card(that is, a card which works like a credit card, except that purchases are immediately deducted from\nyour checking account rather than billed separately through a credit card company). Asavings account\ntypically pays some interest rate, but getting the money typically requires you to make a trip to the bank or an\nautomatic teller machine (or you can access the funds electronically). The lines between checking and savings\naccounts have blurred in the last couple of decades, as many banks offer checking accounts that will pay an\ninterest rate similar to a savings account if you keep a certain minimum amount in the account, or conversely,\noffer savings accounts that allow you to write at least a few checks per month.\nAnother way to deposit savings at a bank is to use acertificate of deposit (CD). With a CD, you agree to deposit\na certain amount of money, often measured in thousands of dollars, in the account for a stated period of time,\ntypically ranging from a few months to several years. In exchange, the bank agrees to pay a higher interest rate\nthan for a regular savings account. While you can withdraw the money before the allotted time, as the\nadvertisements for CDs always warn, there is \u201ca substantial penalty for early withdrawal.\u201d\nFigure 17.4shows the annual rate of interest paid on a six-month, one-year, and five-year CD since 1984, as\nreported by Bankrate.com. The interest rates that savings accounts pay are typically a little lower than the CD\nrate, because financial investors need to receive a slightly higher rate of interest as compensation for\npromising to leave deposits untouched for a period of time in a CD, and thus forfeiting some liquidity.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 17.2 \u2022 How Households Supply Financial Capital 415\nFIGURE17.4Interest Rates on Six-Month, One-Year, and Five-Year Certificates of DepositThe interest rates on\ncertificates of deposit have fluctuated over time. The high interest rates of the early 1980s are indicative of the\nrelatively high inflation rate in the United States at that time. Interest rates fluctuate with the business cycle,\ntypically increasing during expansions and decreasing during a recession. Note the steep decline in CD rates since\n2008, the beginning of the Great Recession.\nThe great advantages of bank accounts are that financial investors have very easy access to their money, and\nalso money in bank accounts is extremely safe. In part, this safety arises because a bank account offers more\nsecurity than keeping a few thousand dollars in the toe of a sock in your underwear drawer. In addition, the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)protects the savings of the average person. Every bank is\nrequired by law to pay a fee to the FDIC, based on the size of its deposits. Then, if a bank should go bankrupt\nand not be able to repay depositors, the FDIC guarantees that all customers will receive their deposits back up\nto $250,000.\nThe bottom line on bank accounts looks like this: low risk means low rate of return but high liquidity.\nBonds\nAn investor who buys a bond expects to receive a rate of return. However, bonds vary in the rates of return that\nthey offer, according to the riskiness of the borrower. We always can divide an interest rate into three\ncomponents (as we explained inChoice in a World of Scarcity): compensation for delaying consumption, an\nadjustment for an inflationary rise in the overall level of prices, and a risk premium that takes the borrower\u2019s\nriskiness into account.\nThe U.S. government is an extremely safe borrower, so when the U.S. government issues Treasury bonds, it can\npay a relatively low interest rate. Firms that appear to be safe borrowers, perhaps because of their sheer size or\nbecause they have consistently earned profits over time, will pay a higher interest rate than the U.S.\ngovernment. Firms that appear to be riskier borrowers, perhaps because they are still growing or their\nbusinesses appear shaky, will pay the highest interest rates when they issue bonds. We call bonds that offer\nhigh interest rates to compensate for their relatively high chance of defaulthigh-yieldbondsorjunk bonds. A\nnumber of today\u2019s well-known firms issued junk bonds in the 1980s when they were starting to grow, including\nTurner Broadcasting and Microsoft.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/bondsecurities)to read about Treasury bonds.\nA bond issued by the U.S. government or a large corporation may seem to be relatively low risk: after all, the 416 17 \u2022 Financial Markets\nbond issuer has promised to make certain payments over time, and except for rare bankruptcy cases, these\npayments will occur. If a corporate bond issuer fails to make the payments that it owes to its bondholders, the\nbondholders can require that the company declare bankruptcy, sell off its assets, and pay them as much as it\ncan. Even in the case of junk bonds, a wise investor can reduce the risk by purchasing bonds from a wide range\nof different companies since, even if a few firms go broke and do not pay, they are not all likely to go bankrupt.\nAs we noted before, bonds carry an interest rate risk. For example, imagine you decide to buy a 10-year bond\nfor $1,000 that would pay an annual interest rate of 8%. Soon after you buy the bond, interest rates on bonds\nrise, so that now similar companies are paying an annual rate of 12%. Anyone who buys a $1,000 bond now\ncan receive annual payments of $120 per year, but since your bond was issued at an interest rate of 8%, you\nhave tied up $1,000 and receive payments of only $80 per year. In the meaningful sense of opportunity cost,\nyou are missing out on the higher payments that you could have received. Furthermore, you can calculate the\namount you should be willing to pay now for future payments. To place a present discounted value on a future\npayment, decide what you would need in the present to equal a certain amount in the future. This calculation\nwill require an interest rate. For example, if the interest rate is 25%, then a payment of $125 a year from now\nwill have a present discounted value of $100\u2014that is, you could take $100 in the present and have $125 in the\nfuture. (We discuss this further in the appendix onPresent Discounted Value.)\nIn financial terms, a bond has several parts. A bond is basically an \u201cI owe you\u201d note that an investor receives in\nexchange for capital (money). The bond has aface value. This is the amount the borrower agrees to pay the\ninvestor at maturity. The bond has acoupon rateor interest rate, which is usually semi-annual, but can be\npaid at different times throughout the year. (Bonds used to be paper documents with coupons that investors\nclipped and turned in to the bank to receive interest.) The bond has amaturity datewhen the borrower will\npay back its face value as well as its last interest payment. Combining the bond\u2019s face value, interest rate, and\nmaturity date, and market interest rates, allows a buyer to compute a bond\u2019spresent value, which is the most\nthat a buyer would be willing to pay for a given bond. This may or may not be the same as the face value.\nThebond yieldmeasures the rate of return a bond is expected to pay over time. Investors can buy bonds when\nthey are issued and they can buy and sell them during their lifetimes. When buying a bond that has been\naround for a few years, investors should know that the interest rate printed on a bond is often not the same as\nthe bond yield, even on new bonds. Read the next Work It Out feature to see how this happens.\nWORK IT OUT\nCalculating the Bond Yield\nYou have bought a $1,000 bond whose coupon rate is 8%. To calculate your return or yield, follow these steps:\n1. Assume the following:\nFace value of a bond: $1,000\nCoupon rate: 8 %\nAnnual payment: $80 per year\n2. Consider the risk of the bond. If this bond carries no risk, then it would be safe to assume that the bond will\nsell for $1,000 when it is issued and pay the purchaser $80 per year until its maturity, at which time the final\ninterest payment will be made and the original $1,000 will be repaid. Now, assume that over time the\ninterest rates prevailing in the economy rise to 12% and that there is now only one year left to this bond\u2019s\nmaturity. This makes the bond an unattractive investment, since an investor can find another bond that\nperhaps pays 12%. To induce the investor to buy the 8% bond, the bond seller will lower its price below its\nface value of $1,000.\n3. Calculate the bond's price when its interest rate is less than the market interest rate. The expected\npayments from the bond one year from now are $1,080, because in the bond\u2019s last year the bond's issuer\nwill make the final interest payment and then also repay the original $1,000. Given that interest rates are\nAccess for free at openstax.org 17.2 \u2022 How Households Supply Financial Capital 417\nnow 12%, you know that you could invest $964 in an alternative investment and receive $1,080 a year from\nnow; that is, $964(1 + 0.12) = $1080. Therefore, you will not pay more than $964 for the original $1,000\nbond.\n4. Consider that the investor will receive the $1,000 face value, plus $80 for the last year\u2019s interest payment.\nThe yield on the bond will be ($1080 \u2013 $964)/$964 = 12%. The yield, or total return, means interest\npayments, plus capital gains. Note that the interest or coupon rate of 8% did not change. When interest rates\nrise, bonds previously issued at lower interest rates will sell for less than face value. Conversely, when\ninterest rates fall, bonds previously issued at higher interest rates will sell for more than face value.\nFigure 17.5shows bond yield for two kinds of bonds: 10-year Treasury bonds (which are officially called\n\u201cnotes\u201d) and corporate bonds issued by firms that have been given an AAA rating as relatively safe borrowers\nbyMoody\u2019s, an independent firm that publishes such ratings. Even though corporate bonds pay a higher\ninterest rate, because firms are riskier borrowers than the federal government, the rates tend to rise and fall\ntogether. Treasury bonds typically pay more than bank accounts, and corporate bonds typically pay a higher\ninterest rate than Treasury bonds.\nFIGURE17.5Interest Rates for Corporate Bonds and Ten-Year U.S. Treasury BondsThe interest rates for corporate\nbonds and U.S. Treasury bonds (officially \u201cnotes\u201d) rise and fall together, depending on conditions for borrowers and\nlenders in financial markets for borrowing. The corporate bonds always pay a higher interest rate, to make up for the\nhigher risk they have of defaulting compared with the U.S. government.\nThe bottom line for bonds: rate of return\u2014low to moderate, depending on the borrower's risk; risk\u2014low to\nmoderate, depending on whether interest rates in the economy change substantially after the bond is issued;\nliquidity\u2014moderate, because the investor needs to sell the bond before the investor regains the cash.\nStocks\nAs we stated earlier, the rate of return on a financial investment in a share of stock can come in two forms: as\ndividends paid by the firm and as a capital gain achieved by selling the stock for more than you paid. The range\nof possible returns from buying stock is mind-bending. Firms can decide to pay dividends or not. A stock price\ncan rise to a multiple of its original price or sink all the way to zero. Even in short periods of time, well-\nestablished companies can see large movements in their stock prices. For example, on July 1, 2011, Netflix\nstock peaked at $295 per share; one year later, on July 30, 2012, it was at $53.91 per share; in 2022, it had\nrecovered to $199. When Facebook went public, its shares of stock sold for around $40 per share, but in 2022,\nthey were selling for slightly over $212.\nWe will discuss the reasons why stock prices fall and rise so abruptly below, but first you need to know how we\nmeasure stock market performance. There are a number of different ways to measure the overall performance 418 17 \u2022 Financial Markets\nof the stock market, based on averaging different subsets of companies' stock prices. Perhaps the best-known\nstock market measure is the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is based on 30 large U.S. companies' stock\nprices. Another stock market performance gauge, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500, follows the stock prices of the 500\nlargest U.S. companies. The Wilshire 5000 tracks the stock prices of essentially all U.S. companies that have\nstock the public can buy and sell.\nOther stock market measures focus on where stocks are traded. For example, the New York Stock Exchange\nmonitors the performance of stocks that are traded on that exchange in New York City. The Nasdaq stock\nmarket includes about 3,600 stocks, with a concentration of technology stocks.Table 17.1lists some of the\nmost commonly cited measures of U.S. and international stock markets.\nMeasure of the Stock Market Comments\nDow Jones Industrial Average Based on 30 large companies from a diverse set of representative\n(DJIA): https://www.spglobal.com/ industries, chosen by analysts at Dow Jones and Company.

Broad stock market measures, like the\nones we list here, tend to move together. The S&P 500 Index is the weighted average market capitalization of\nthe firms selected to be in the index. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is the price weighted average of 30\nindustrial stocks tracked on the New York Stock Exchange.\nWhen the Dow Jones average rises from 5,000 to 10,000, you know that the average price of the stocks in that\nindex has roughly doubled.Figure 17.6shows that stock prices did not rise much in the 1970s, but then\nstarted a steady climb in the 1980s. From 2000 to 2013, stock prices bounced up and down, but ended up at\nAccess for free at openstax.org 17.2 \u2022 How Households Supply Financial Capital 419\nabout the same level.\nFIGURE17.6The Dow Jones Industrial Index and the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500, 1965\u20132021Stock prices rose\ndramatically from the 1980s up to about 2000. From 2000 to 2013, stock prices bounced up and down, but ended\nup at about the same level. Since 2009, both indexes have for the most part increased.\nTable 17.2shows the total annual rate of return an investor would have received from buying the stocks in the\nS&P 500 index over recent decades. The total return here includes both dividends paid by these companies\nand also capital gains arising from increases in the stock value. (For technical reasons related to how we\ncalculate the numbers, the dividends and capital gains do not add exactly to the total return.) From the 1950s\nto the 1980s, the average firm paid annual dividends equal to about 4% of its stock value. Since the 1990s,\ndividends have dropped and now often provide a return closer to 1% to 2%. In the 1960s and 1970s, the gap\nbetween percent earned on capital gains and dividends was much closer than it has been since the 1980s. In\nthe 1980s and 1990s, capital gains were far higher than dividends. In the 2000s, dividends remained low and,\nwhile stock prices fluctuated, they ended the decade roughly where they had started. In the 2010s, dividends\nremained low and stock prices increased, and this continued at the beginning of the 2020s. 420 17 \u2022 Financial Markets\nPeriod Total Annual Return Capital Gains Dividends\n1950\u20131959 19.25% 13.58% 4.99%\n1960\u20131969 7.78% 4.39% 3.25%\n1970\u20131979 5.88% 1.60% 4.20%\n1980\u20131989 17.55% 12.59% 4.40%\n1990\u20131999 18.21% 15.31% 2.51%\n2000\u20132009 \u22121.00% \u22122.70% 1.70%\n2010\u20132019 12.65% 10.35% 2.30%\n2020 18.40% 16.26% 2.14%\n2021 28.71% 26.89% 1.82%\nTABLE17.2Annual Returns on S&P 500 Stocks, 1950\u20132021\nThe overall pattern is that stocks as a group have provided a high rate of return over extended periods of time,\nbut this return comes with risks. The market value of individual companies can rise and fall substantially, both\nover short time periods and over the long run. During extended periods of time like the 1970s or the first\ndecade of the 2000s, the overall stock market return can be quite modest. The stock market can sometimes fall\nsharply, as it did in 2008.\nThe bottom line on investing in stocks is that the rate of return over time will be high, but the risks are also\nhigh, especially in the short run. Liquidity is also high since one can sell stock in publicly held companies\nreadily for spendable money.\nMutual Funds\nBuying stocks or bonds issued by a single company is always somewhat risky. An individual firm may find\nitself buffeted by unfavorable supply and demand conditions or hurt by unlucky or unwise managerial\ndecisions. Thus, a standard recommendation from financial investors isdiversification, which means buying\nstocks or bonds from a wide range of companies. A saver who diversifies is following the old proverb: \u201cDon\u2019t\nput all your eggs in one basket.\u201d In any broad group of companies, some firms will do better than expected and\nsome will do worse\u2014but the diversification has a tendency to cancel out extreme increases and decreases in\nvalue.\nPurchasing a diversified group of stocks or bonds has become easier in the internet age, but it remains\nsomething of a task. To simplify the process, companies offermutual funds, which consist of a variety of\nstocks or bonds from different companies. The financial investor buys mutual fund shares, and then receives a\nreturn based on how the fund as a whole performs. In 2021, according to the Investment Company Factbook,\njust over 47% of U.S. households had a financial investment in a mutual fund\u2014including many people who\nhave their retirement savings or pension money invested in this way.\nMutual funds can focus in certain areas: one mutual fund might invest only in company stocks based in\nIndonesia, or only in bonds issued by large manufacturing companies, or only in biotechnology companies'\nstock. At the other end of the spectrum, a mutual fund might be quite broad. At the extreme, some mutual\nfunds own a tiny share of every firm in the stock market, and thus the mutual fund's value will fluctuate with\nthe overall stock market's average. We call a mutual fund that seeks only to mimic the market's overall\nperformance anindex fund.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 17.2 \u2022 How Households Supply Financial Capital 421\nDiversification can offset some of the risks of individual stocks rising or falling. Even investors who buy an\nindexed mutual fund designed to mimic some measure of the broad stock market, like the Standard & Poor\u2019s\n500, had better prepare against some ups and downs, like those the stock market experienced in the first\ndecade of the 2000s. In 2008 average U.S. stock funds declined 38%, reducing individual and household\nwealth. This steep drop in value hit hardest those who were close to retirement and were counting on their\nstock funds to supplement retirement income.\nThe bottom line on investing in mutual funds is that the rate of return over time will be high. The risks are also\nhigh, but the risks and returns for an individual mutual fund will be lower than those for an individual stock.\nAs with stocks, liquidity is also high provided the mutual fund or stock index fund is readily traded.\nHousing and Other Tangible Assets\nHouseholds can also seek a rate of return by purchasing tangible assets, especially housing. About two-thirds\nof U.S. households own their own home. An owner\u2019sequityin a house is the monetary value the owner would\nhave after selling the house and repaying any outstanding bank loans they used to buy the house. For example,\nimagine that you buy a house for $200,000, paying 10% of the price as a down payment and taking out a bank\nloan for the remaining $180,000. Over time, you pay off some of your bank loan, so that only $100,000\nremains, and the house's value on the market rises to $250,000. At that point, your equity in the home is the\nvalue of the home minus the value of the loan outstanding, which is $150,000. For many middle-class\nAmericans, home equity is their single greatest financial asset. The total value of all home equity held by U.S.\nhouseholds was $23.6 trillion as of the middle of 2021, according to Federal Reserve data.\nInvestment in a house is tangibly different from bank accounts, stocks, and bonds because a house offers both\na financial and a nonfinancial return. If you buy a house to live in, part of the return on your investment occurs\nfrom your consumption of \u201chousing services\u201d\u2014that is, having a place to live. (Of course, if you buy a home and\nrent it out, you receive rental payments for the housing services you provide, which would offer a financial\nreturn.) Buying a house to live in also offers the possibility of a capital gain from selling the house in the future\nfor more than you paid for it. There can, however, be different outcomes, as the Clear It Up on the housing\nmarket shows.\nHousing prices have usually risen steadily over time. For example, the median sales price for an existing one-\nfamily home was $122,900 in 1990, but 232,000 at the end of December 2016, according to FRED\u00aeEconomic\nData. Over these 24 years, home prices increased an average of 3.1% per year, which is an average financial\nreturn over this time.Figure 17.7shows U.S. Census data for the average sales price of a new home in the\nUnited States from 1965 to 2021.\nLINK IT UP\nGo to thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/investopedia)to experiment with a compound annual growth rate\ncalculator.\nHowever, the possible capital gains from rising housing prices are riskier than these national price averages.\nCertain regions of the country or metropolitan areas have seen drops in housing prices over time. The median\nhousing price for the United States as a whole fell almost 7% in 2008 and again in 2009, dropping the median\nprice from $247,900 to $216,700. As of 2016, home values had recovered and even exceeded their pre-\nrecession levels, and they have continued to increase into the early 2020s.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/insidejob)to watch the trailer forInside Job, a movie that explores the\nmodern financial crisis. 422 17 \u2022 Financial Markets\nFIGURE17.7The Median Average Sales Price for New Single-Family Homes, 1990\u20132015The median price is the\nprice where half of sales prices are higher and half are lower. The median sales price for a new one-family home was\n$122,900 in 1990. It rose as high as $248,000 in 2007, before falling to $232,000 in 2008. In 2015, the median\nsales price was $294,000. Of course, this national figure conceals many local differences, like the areas where\nhousing prices are higher or lower, or how housing prices have risen or fallen at certain times. (Source: U.S. Census)\nInvestors can also put money into other tangible assets such as gold, silver, and other precious metals, or in\nduller commodities like sugar, cocoa, coffee, orange juice, oil, and natural gas. The return on these investments\nderives from the saver\u2019s hope of buying low, selling high, and receiving a capital gain. Investing in, say, gold or\ncoffee offers relatively little in the way of nonfinancial benefits to the user (unless the investor likes to caress\ngold or gaze upon a warehouse full of coffee). Typically, investors in these commodities never even see the\nphysical good. Instead, they sign a contract that takes ownership of a certain quantity of these commodities,\nwhich are stored in a warehouse, and later they sell the ownership to someone else. As one example, from 1981\nto 2005, the gold prices generally fluctuated between about $300 and $500 per ounce, but then rose sharply to\nover $1,100 per ounce by early 2010. In January 2017, prices were hovering around $1,191 per ounce, and\nthey have since increased, reaching over $1,900 by early 2022.\nA final area of tangible assets consists of \u201ccollectibles\u201d like paintings, fine wine, jewelry, antiques, or even\nbaseball cards. Most collectibles provide returns both in the form of services or of a potentially higher selling\nprice in the future. You can use paintings by hanging them on the wall; jewelry by wearing it; baseball cards by\ndisplaying them. You can also hope to sell them someday for more than you paid for them. However, the\nevidence on prices of collectibles, while scanty, is that while they may go through periods where prices\nskyrocket for a time, you should not expect to make a higher-than-average rate of return over a sustained\nperiod of time from investing in this way.\nThe bottom line on investing in tangible assets: rate of return\u2014moderate, especially if you can receive\nnonfinancial benefits from, for example, living in the house; risk\u2014moderate for housing or high if you buy gold\nor baseball cards; liquidity\u2014low, because it often takes considerable time and energy to sell a house or a piece\nof fine art and turn your capital gain into cash. The next Clear It Up feature explains the issues in the recent\nU.S. housing market crisis.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat was all the commotion in the recent U.S. housing market?\nThe cumulative average annual growth rate in housing prices from 1981 to 2000 was 5.1%. The price of an average\nU.S. home then took off from 2003 to 2005, rising more than 10% per year. No serious analyst believed this rate of\ngrowth was sustainable; after all, if housing prices grew at, say, 11% per year over time, the average price of a home\nAccess for free at openstax.org 17.2 \u2022 How Households Supply Financial Capital 423\nwould more than double every seven years. However, at the time many serious analysts saw no reason for deep\nconcern. After all, housing prices often change in fits and starts, like all prices, and a price surge for a few years is\noften followed by prices that are flat or even declining a bit as local markets adjust.\nThe sharp rise in housing prices was driven by a high level of demand for housing. Interest rates were low, so\nfinancial institutions encouraged people to borrow money to buy a house. Banks became much more flexible in their\nlending, making what were called \u201csubprime\u201d loans. Banks loaned money with low, or sometimes no down\npayment. They offered loans with very low payments for the first two years, but then much higher payments after\nthat. The idea was that housing prices would keep rising, so the borrower would just refinance the mortgage two\nyears in the future, and thus would not ever have to make the higher payments. Some banks even offered so-called\nNINJA loans, which meant a financial institution issued a loan even though the borrower had no income, no job, nor\nassets.\nIn retrospect, these loans seem outlandish. Many borrowers figured, however, that as long as housing prices kept\nrising, it made sense to buy. Many lenders used a process called \u201csecuritizing,\u201d in which they sold their mortgages to\nfinancial companies, which put all the mortgages into a big pool, creating large financial securities, and then re-sold\nthese mortgage-backed securities to investors. In this way, the lenders off-loaded the mortgage risks to investors.\nInvestors were interested in mortgage-backed securities as they appeared to offer a steady stream of income,\nprovided the borrowers repaid them. Investors relied on the ratings agencies to assess the credit risk associated\nwith the mortgage-backed securities. In hindsight, it appears that the credit agencies were far too lenient in their\nratings of many of the securitized loans. Bank and financial regulators watched the steady rise in the market for\nmortgage-backed securities, but saw no reason at the time to intervene.\nWhen housing prices turned down, many households that had borrowed when prices were high found that what they\nowed the bank was more than what their home was worth. Many banks believed that they had diversified by selling\ntheir individual loans and instead buying securities based on mortgage loans from all over the country. After all,\nbanks thought back in 2005, the average house price had not declined at any time since the Great Depression in the\n1930s. These securities based on mortgage loans, however, turned out to be far riskier than expected. The bust in\nhousing prices weakened both bank and household finances, and thus helped bring on the 2008\u20132009 Great\nRecession.\nThe Tradeoffs between Return and Risk\nThe discussion of financial investments has emphasized the expected rate of return, the risk, and the liquidity\nof each investment.Table 17.3summarizes these characteristics.\nFinancial Investment Return Risk Liquidity\nChecking account Very low Very little Very high\nSavings account Low Very little High\nCertificate of deposit Low to medium Very little Medium\nStocks High Medium to high Medium\nBonds Medium Low to medium Medium\nMutual funds Medium to high Medium to high Medium to high\nHousing Medium Medium Low\nTABLE17.3Key Characteristics of Financial Investments 424 17 \u2022 Financial Markets\nFinancial Investment Return Risk Liquidity\nGold Medium High Low\nCollectibles Low to medium High Low\nTABLE17.3Key Characteristics of Financial Investments\nThe household investment choices listed here display a tradeoff between the expected return and the degree of\nrisk involved. Bank accounts have very low risk and very low returns; bonds have higher risk but higher\nreturns; and stocks are riskiest of all but have the potential for still higher returns. In effect, the higher average\nreturn compensates for the higher degree of risk. If risky assets like stocks did not also offer a higher average\nreturn, then few investors would want them.\nThis tradeoff between return and risk complicates the task of any financial investor: Is it better to invest safely\nor to take a risk and go for the high return? Ultimately, choices about risk and return will be based on personal\npreferences. However, it is often useful to examine risk and return in the context of different time frames.\nThe high returns of stock market investments refer to a high average return that we can expect over a period of\nseveral years or decades. The high risk of such investments refers to the fact that in shorter time frames, from\nmonths to a few years, the rate of return may fluctuate a great deal. Thus, a person near retirement age, who\nalready owns a house, may prefer reduced risk and certainty about retirement income. For young workers, just\nstarting to make a reasonably profitable living, it may make sense to put most of their savings for retirement in\nmutual funds. Mutual funds are able to take advantage of their buying and selling size and thereby reduce\ntransaction costs for investors. Stocks are risky in the short term, to be sure, but when the worker can look\nforward to several decades during which stock market ups and downs can even out, stocks will typically pay a\nmuch higher return over that extended period than will bonds or bank accounts. Thus, one must consider\ntradeoffs between risk and return in the context of where the investor is in life.\n17.3How to Accumulate Personal Wealth\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain the random walk theory\n\u2022 Calculate simple and compound interest\n\u2022 Evaluate how capital markets transform financial capital\nGetting rich may seem straightforward enough. Figure out what companies are going to grow and earn high\nprofits in the future, or figure out what companies are going to become popular for everyone else to buy. Those\ncompanies are the ones that will pay high dividends or whose stock price will climb in the future. Then, buy\nstock in those companies. Presto! Multiply your money!\nWhy is this path to riches not as easy as it sounds? This module first discusses the problems with picking\nstocks, and then discusses a more reliable but undeniably duller method of accumulating personal wealth.\nWhy It Is Hard to Get Rich Quick: The Random Walk Theory\nThe chief problem with attempting to buystockin companies that will have higher prices in the future is that\nmany other financial investors are trying to do the same thing. Thus, in attempting to get rich in the stock\nmarket, it is no help to identify a company that is going to earn high profits if many other investors have\nalready reached the same conclusion, because the stock price will already be high, based on the expected high\nlevel of future profits.\nThe idea that stock prices are based on expectations about the future has a powerful and unexpected\nAccess for free at openstax.org 17.3 \u2022 How to Accumulate Personal Wealth 425\nimplication. If expectations determine stock price, then shifts in expectations will determine shifts in the stock\nprice. Thus, what matters for predicting whether the stock price of a company will do well is not whether the\ncompany will actually earn profits in the future. Instead, you must find a company that analysts widely believe\nat present to have poor prospects, but that will actually turn out to be a shining star. Brigades of stock market\nanalysts and individual investors are carrying out such research 24 hours a day.\nThe fundamental problem with predicting future stock winners is that, by definition, no one can predict the\nfuture news that alters expectations about profits. Because stock prices will shift in response to unpredictable\nfuture news, these prices will tend to follow what mathematicians call a \u201crandom walk with a trend.\u201d The\n\u201crandom walk\u201d part means that, on any given day, stock prices are just as likely to rise as to fall. \u201cWith a trend\u201d\nmeans that over time, the upward steps tend to be larger than the downward steps, so stocks do gradually\nclimb.\nIf stocks follow a random walk, then not even financial professionals will be able to choose those that will beat\nthe average consistently. While some investment advisers are better than average in any given year, and some\neven succeed for a number of years in a row, the majority of financial investors do not outguess the market. If\nwe look back over time, it is typically true that half or two-thirds of the mutual funds that attempted to pick\nstocks which would rise more than the market average actually ended up performing worse than the market\naverage. For the average investor who reads the newspaper business pages over a cup of coffee in the morning,\nthe odds of doing better than full-time professionals is not very good at all. Trying to pick the stocks that will\ngain a great deal in the future is a risky and unlikely way to become rich.\nGetting Rich the Slow, Boring Way\nMany U.S. citizens can accumulate a large amount of wealth during their lifetimes, if they make two key\nchoices. The first is to complete additional education and training. In 2020, the Bureau of Labor Statistics\nreported median weekly usual earnings for full-time wage and salary workers age 25 and over that\ncorresponded to annual income of $40,612 for those with a high school diploma, $48,776 for those with a two-\nyear associate degree, and $67,860 for those with a four-year bachelor\u2019s degree. Learning is not only good for\nyou, but it pays off financially, too.\nThe second key choice is to start saving money early in life, and to give the power of compound interest a\nchance. Imagine that at age 25, you save $3,000 and place that money into an account that you do not touch. In\nthe long run, it is not unreasonable to assume a 7% real annual rate of return (that is, 7% above the rate of\ninflation) on money invested in a well-diversified stock portfolio. After 40 years, using the formula for\ncompound interest, the original $3,000 investment will have multiplied nearly fifteen fold:\nHaving $45,000 does not make you a millionaire. Notice, however, that this tidy sum is the result of saving\n$3,000 exactly once. Saving that amount every year for several decades\u2014or saving more as income rises\u2014will\nmultiply the total considerably. This type of wealth will not rival the riches of Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, but\nremember that only half of Americans have any money in mutual funds at all. Accumulating hundreds of\nthousands of dollars by retirement is a perfectly achievable goal for a well-educated person who starts saving\nearly in life\u2014and that amount of accumulated wealth will put you at or near the top 10% of all American\nhouseholds. The following Work It Out feature shows the difference between simple and compound interest,\nand the power of compound interest.\nWORK IT OUT\nSimple and Compound Interest\nSimple interestis an interest rate calculation only on the principal amount. 426 17 \u2022 Financial Markets\nStep 1. Learn the formula for simple interest:\nStep 2. Practice using the simple interest formula.\nExample 1: $100 Deposit at a simple interest rate of 5% held for one year is:\nSimple interest in this example is $5.\nExample 2: $100 Deposit at a simple interest rate of 5% held for three years is:\nSimple interest in this example is $15.\nStep 3. Calculate the total future amount using this formula:\nStep 4. Put the two simple interest formulas together.\nStep 5. Apply the simple interest formula to our three year example.\nCompound interestis an interest rate calculation on the principal plus the accumulated interest.\nStep 6. To find the compound interest, we determine the difference between the future value and the present\nvalue of the principal. This is accomplished as follows:\nStep 7. Apply this formula to our three-year scenario. Follow the calculations in\nTable 17.4\nYear 1\nAmount in Bank $100\nBank Interest Rate 5%\nTotal $105\n$100 + ($100 \u00d7 0.05)\nYear 2\nAmount in Bank $105\nBank Interest Rate 5%\nTotal $110.25\nTABLE17.4\nAccess for free at openstax.org 17.3 \u2022 How to Accumulate Personal Wealth 427\n$105 + ($105 \u00d7 .05)\nYear 3\nAmount in Bank $110.25\nBank Interest Rate 5%\nTotal $115.75\n$110.25 + ($110.25 \u00d7 .05)\nCompound interest $115.76 \u2013 $100 = $15.76\nTABLE17.4\nStep 8. Note that, after three years, the total is $115.76. Therefore the total compound interest is $15.76. This is\n$0.76 more than we obtained with simple interest. While this may not seem like much, keep in mind that we\nwere only working with $100 and over a relatively short time period. Compound interest can make a huge\ndifference with larger sums of money and over longer periods of time.\nObtaining additional education and saving money early in life obviously will not make you rich overnight.\nAdditional education typically means deferring earning income and living as a student for more years. Saving\nmoney often requires choices like driving an older or less expensive car, living in a smaller apartment or\nbuying a smaller house, and making other day-to-day sacrifices. For most people, the tradeoffs for achieving\nsubstantial personal wealth will require effort, patience, and sacrifice.\nHow Capital Markets Transform Financial Flows\nFinancial capital markets have the power to repackage money as it moves from those who supply financial\ncapital to those who demand it. Banks accept checking account deposits and turn them into long-term loans to\ncompanies. Individual firms sell shares of stock and issue bonds to raise capital. Firms make and sell an\nastonishing array of goods and services, but an investor can receive a return on the company\u2019s decisions by\nbuying stock in that company. Financial investors sell and resell stocks and bonds to one another. Venture\ncapitalists and angel investors search for promising small companies. Mutual funds combine the stocks and\nbonds\u2014and thus, indirectly, the products and investments\u2014of many different companies.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/austerebaltic/)to read an article about how austerity can work. Then\nvisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/counteraustere)for another perspective on austerity.\nIn this chapter, we discussed the basic mechanisms of financial markets. (A more advanced course in\neconomics or finance will consider more sophisticated tools.) The fundamentals of those financial capital\nmarkets remain the same: Firms are trying to raise financial capital and households are looking for a desirable\ncombination of rate of return, risk, and liquidity. Financial markets are society\u2019s mechanisms for bringing\ntogether these forces of demand and supply. 428 17 \u2022 Financial Markets\nBRING IT HOME\nThe Housing Bubble and the Financial Crisis of 2007\nThe housing boom and bust in the United States, and the resulting multi-trillion-dollar decline in home equity, began\nwith the fall of home prices starting in 2007. As home values dipped, many home prices fell below the amount the\nborrower owed on the mortgage and owners stopped paying and defaulted on their loan. Banks found that their\nassets (loans) became worthless. Many financial institutions around the world had invested in mortgage-backed\nsecurities, or had purchased insurance on mortgage-backed securities. When housing prices collapsed, the value of\nthose financial assets collapsed as well. The asset side of the banks\u2019 balance sheets dropped, causing bank failures\nand bank runs. Around the globe, financial institutions were bankrupted or nearly so. The result was a large\ndecrease in lending and borrowing, or a freezing up of available credit. When credit dries up, the economy is on its\nknees. The crisis was not limited to the United States. Iceland, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, and\nGreece all had similar housing boom and bust cycles, and similar credit freezes.\nIf businesses cannot access financial capital, they cannot make physical capital investments. Those investments\nultimately lead to job creation. When credit dried up, businesses invested less, and they ultimately laid off millions\nof workers. This caused incomes to drop, which caused demand to drop. In turn businesses sold less, so they laid\noff more workers. Compounding these events, as economic conditions worsened, financial institutions were even\nless likely to make loans.\nTo make matters even worse, as businesses sold less, their expected future profit decreased, and this led to a drop\nin stock prices. Combining all these effects led to major decreases in incomes, demand, consumption, and\nemployment, and to the Great Recession, which in the United States officially lasted from December 2007 to June\n2009. During this time, the unemployment rate rose from 5% to a peak of 10.1%. Four years after the recession\nofficially ended, unemployment was still stubbornly high, at 7.6%, and 11.8 million people were still unemployed.\nAs the world\u2019s leading consumer, if the United States goes into recession, it usually drags other countries down with\nit. The Great Recession was no exception. With few exceptions, U.S. trading partners also entered into recessions of\ntheir own, of varying lengths, or suffered slower economic growth. Like the United States, many European countries\nalso gave direct financial assistance, so-called bailouts, to the institutions that make up their financial markets.\nThere was good reason to do this. Financial markets bridge the gap between demanders and suppliers of financial\ncapital. These institutions and markets need to function in order for an economy to invest in new financial capital.\nHowever, much of this bailout money was borrowed, and this borrowed money contributed to another crisis in\nEurope. Because of the impact on their budgets of the financial crisis and the resulting bailouts, many countries\nfound themselves with unsustainably high deficits. They chose to undertake austerity measures, large decreases in\ngovernment spending and large tax increases, in order to reduce their deficits. Greece, Ireland, Spain, and Portugal\nall had to undertake relatively severe austerity measures. The ramifications of this crisis have spread. Economists\neven called into question the euro\u2019s viability.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 17 \u2022 Key Terms 429\nKey Terms\nactual rate of return the total rate of return, including capital gains and interest paid on an investment at the\nend of a time period\nbond a financial contract through which a borrower like a corporation, a city or state, or the federal\ngovernment agrees to repay the amount that it borrowed and also a rate of interest over a period of time in\nthe future\nbond yield the rate of return a bond is expected to pay at the time of purchase\nbondholder someone who owns bonds and receives the interest payments\ncapital gain a financial gain from buying an asset, like a share of stock or a house, and later selling it at a\nhigher price\ncertificate of deposit (CD) a mechanism for a saver to deposit funds at a bank and promise to leave them at\nthe bank for a time, in exchange for a higher interest rate\nchecking account a bank account that typically pays little or no interest, but that gives easy access to money,\neither by writing a check or by using a \u201cdebit card\u201d\ncompound interest an interest rate calculation on the principal plus the accumulated interest\ncorporate bond a bond issued by firms that wish to borrow\ncorporate governance the name economists give to the institutions that are supposed to watch over top\nexecutives in companies that shareholders own\ncorporation a business owned by shareholders who have limited liability for the company\u2019s debt yet a share of\nthe company\u2019s profits; may be private or public and may or may not have publicly-traded stock\ncoupon rate the interest rate paid on a bond; can be annual or semi-annual\ndebit card a card that lets the person make purchases, and the financial institution immediately deducts cost\nfrom that person\u2019s checking account\ndiversification investing in a wide range of companies to reduce the level of risk\ndividend a direct payment from a firm to its shareholders\nequity the monetary value a homeowner would have after selling the house and repaying any outstanding\nbank loans used to buy the house\nexpected rate of return how much a project or an investment is expected to return to the investor, either in\nfuture interest payments, capital gains, or increased profitability\nface value the amount that the bond issuer or borrower agrees to pay the investor\nfinancial intermediary an institution, like a bank, that receives money from savers and provides funds to\nborrowers\nhigh-yield bonds bonds that offer relatively high interest rates to compensate for their relatively high chance\nof default\nindex fund a mutual fund that seeks only to mimic the market's overall performance\ninitial public offering (IPO) the first sale of shares of stock by a firm to outside investors\njunk bonds see high-yield bonds\nliquidity refers to how easily one can exchange money or financial assets for a good or service\nmaturity date the date that a borrower must repay a bond\nmunicipal bonds a bond issued by cities that wish to borrow\nmutual funds funds that buy a range of stocks or bonds from different companies, thus allowing an investor\nan easy way to diversify\npartnership a company run by a group as opposed to an individual\npresent value a bond\u2019s current price at a given time\nprivate company a firm frequently owned by the people who generally run it on a day-to-day basis\npublic company a firm that has sold stock to the public, which in turn investors then can buy and sell\nrisk a measure of the uncertainty of that project\u2019s profitability\nsavings account a bank account that pays an interest rate, but withdrawing money typically requires a trip to\nthe bank or an automatic teller machine 430 17 \u2022 Key Concepts and Summary\nshareholders people who own at least some shares of stock in a firm\nshares a firm's stock, divided into individual portions\nsimple interest an interest rate calculation only on the principal amount\nsole proprietorship a company run by an individual as opposed to a group\nstock a specific firm's claim on partial ownership\nTreasury bond a bond issued by the federal government through the U.S. Department of the Treasury\nventure capital financial investments in new companies that are still relatively small in size, but that have\npotential to grow substantially\nKey Concepts and Summary\n17.1How Businesses Raise Financial Capital\nCompanies can raise early-stage financial capital in several ways: from their owners\u2019 or managers\u2019 personal\nsavings, or credit cards and from private investors like angel investors and venture capital firms.\nA bond is a financial contract through which a borrower agrees to repay the amount that it borrowed. A bond\nspecifies an amount that one will borrow, the amounts that one will repay over time based on the interest rate\nwhen the bond is issued, and the time until repayment. Corporate bonds are issued by firms; municipal bonds\nare issued by cities, state bonds by U.S. states, and Treasury bonds by the federal government through the U.S.\nDepartment of the Treasury.\nStock represents firm ownership. A company's stock is divided into shares. A firm receives financial capital\nwhen it sells stock to the public. We call a company\u2019s first stock sale to the public the initial public offering\n(IPO). However, a firm does not receive any funds when one shareholder sells stock in the firm to another\ninvestor. One receives the rate of return on stock in two forms: dividends and capital gains.\nA private company is usually owned by the people who run it on a day-to-day basis, although hired managers\ncan run it. We call a private company owned and run by an individual a sole proprietorship, while a firm owned\nand run by a group is a partnership. When a firm decides to sell stock that financial investors can buy and sell,\nthen the firm is owned by its shareholders\u2014who in turn elect a board of directors to hire top day-to-day\nmanagement. We call this a public company. Corporate governance is the name economists give to the\ninstitutions that are supposed to watch over top executives, though it does not always work.\n17.2How Households Supply Financial Capital\nWe can categorize all investments according to three key characteristics: average expected return, degree of\nrisk, and liquidity. To obtain a higher rate of return, an investor must typically accept either more risk or less\nliquidity. Banks are an example of a financial intermediary, an institution that operates to coordinate supply\nand demand in the financial capital market. Banks offer a range of accounts, including checking accounts,\nsavings accounts, and certificates of deposit. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), banks\npurchase insurance against the risk of a bank failure.\nA typical bond promises the financial investor a series of payments over time, based on the interest rate at the\ntime the financial institution issues the bond, and when the borrower repays it. Bonds that offer a high rate of\nreturn but also a relatively high chance of defaulting on the payments are called high-yield or junk bonds. The\nbond yield is the rate of return that a bond promises to pay at the time of purchase. Even when bonds make\npayments based on a fixed interest rate, they are somewhat risky, because if interest rates rise for the economy\nas a whole, an investor who owns bonds issued at lower interest rates is now locked into the low rate and\nsuffers a loss.\nChanges in the stock price depend on changes in expectations about future profits. Investing in any individual\nfirm is somewhat risky, so investors are wise to practice diversification, which means investing in a range of\ncompanies. A mutual fund purchases an array of stocks and/or bonds. An investor in the mutual fund then\nreceives a return depending on the fund's overall performance as a whole. A mutual fund that seeks to imitate\nAccess for free at openstax.org 17 \u2022 Self-Check Questions 431\nthe overall behavior of the stock market is called an index fund.\nWe can also regard housing and other tangible assets as forms of financial investment, which pay a rate of\nreturn in the form of capital gains. Housing can also offer a nonfinancial return\u2014specifically, you can live in it.\n17.3How to Accumulate Personal Wealth\nIt is extremely difficult, even for financial professionals, to predict changes in future expectations and thus to\nchoose the stocks whose price will rise in the future. Most Americans can accumulate considerable financial\nwealth if they follow two rules: complete significant additional education and training after graduating from\nhigh school and start saving money early in life.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

Those that are not could be subject to a tariff that could cause the cost of all tires to be higher.\n(Credit: \"Tires\" by Jayme del Rosario/Flickr Creative Commons, CC BY 2.0)\nCHAPTER OBJECTIVES\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\u2022 Voter Participation and Costs of Elections\n\u2022 Special Interest Politics\n\u2022 Flaws in the Democratic System of Government\nIntroduction to Public Economy\nBRING IT HOME\nChinese Tire Tariffs\nDo you know where the tires on your car are made? If they were imported, they may be subject to a tariff (a tax on\nimported goods) that could raise the price of your car. What do you think about that tariff? Would you write to your\nrepresentative or your senator about it? Would you start a Facebook or Twitter campaign?\nMost people are unlikely to fight this kind of tax or even inform themselves about the issue in the first place. InThe\nLogic of Collective Action(1965), economist Mancur Olson challenged the popular idea that, in a democracy, the\nmajority view will prevail, and in doing so launched the modern study of public economy, sometimes referred to as\npublic choice, a subtopic of microeconomics. In this chapter, we will look at the economics of government policy,\nwhy smaller, more organized groups have an incentive to work hard to enact certain policies, and why lawmakers 436 18 \u2022 Public Economy\nultimately make decisions that may result in bad economic policy.\nAs President Abraham Lincoln famously said in his 1863Gettysburg Address, democratic governments are\nsupposed to be \u201cof the people, by the people, and for the people.\u201d Can we rely on democratic governments to\nenact sensible economic policies? After all, they react to voters, not to analyses of demand and supply curves.\nThe main focus of an economics course is, naturally enough, to analyze the characteristics of markets and\npurely economic institutions. However, political institutions also play a role in allocating society\u2019s scarce\nresources, and economists have played an active role, along with other social scientists, in analyzing how such\npolitical institutions work.\nOther chapters of this book discuss situations in which market forces can sometimes lead to undesirable\nresults: monopoly, imperfect competition, and antitrust policy; negative and positive externalities; poverty and\ninequality of incomes; failures to provide insurance; and financial markets that may go from boom to bust.\nMany of these chapters suggest that the government's economic policies could address these issues.\nHowever, just as markets can face issues and problems that lead to undesirable outcomes, a democratic\nsystem of government can also make mistakes, either by enacting policies that do not benefit society as a\nwhole or by failing to enact policies that would have benefited society as a whole. This chapter discusses some\npractical difficulties of democracy from an economic point of view: we presume the actors in the political\nsystem follow their own self-interest, which is not necessarily the same as the public good. For example, many\nof those who are eligible to vote do not, which obviously raises questions about whether a democratic system\nwill reflect everyone\u2019s interests. Benefits or costs of government action are sometimes concentrated on small\ngroups, which in some cases may organize and have a disproportionately large impact on politics and in other\ncases may fail to organize and end up neglected. A legislator who worries about support from voters in their\ndistrict may focus on spending projects specific to the district without sufficient concern for whether this\nspending is in the nation's interest.\nWhen more than two choices exist, the principle that the majority of voters should decide may not always\nmake logical sense, because situations can arise where it becomes literally impossible to decide what the\n\u201cmajority\u201d prefers. Government may also be slower than private firms to correct its mistakes, because\ngovernment agencies do not face competition or the threat of new entry.\n18.1Voter Participation and Costs of Elections\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain the significance of rational ignorance\n\u2022 Evaluate the impact of election expenses\nIn U.S. presidential elections over the last few decades, about 55% to 65% of voting-age citizens actually voted,\naccording to the U.S. Census. In congressional elections when there is no presidential race, or in local\nelections, the turnout is typically lower, often less than half the eligible voters. In other countries, the share of\nadults who vote is often higher. For example, in national elections since the 1980s in Germany, Spain, and\nFrance, about 75% to 80% of those of voting age cast ballots. Even this total falls well short of 100%. Some\ncountries have laws that require voting, among them Australia, Belgium, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Singapore, and\nmost Latin American nations. At the time the United States was founded, voting was mandatory in Virginia,\nMaryland, Delaware, and Georgia. Even if the law can require people to vote, however, no law can require that\neach voter cast an informed or a thoughtful vote. Moreover, in the United States and in most countries around\nthe world, the freedom to vote has also typically meant the freedomnotto vote.\nWhy do people not vote? Perhaps they do not care too much about who wins, or they are uninformed about who\nis running, or they do not believe their vote will matter or change their lives in any way. These reasons are\nprobably tied together, since people who do not believe their vote matters will not bother to become informed\nAccess for free at openstax.org 18.1 \u2022 Voter Participation and Costs of Elections 437\nor care who wins. Economists have suggested why autility-maximizingperson might rationally decide not to\nvote or not to become informed about the election. While a single vote may decide a few elections in very small\ntowns, in most elections of any size, the Board of Elections measures the margin of victory in hundreds,\nthousands, or even millions of votes. A rational voter will recognize that one vote is extremely unlikely to make\na difference. This theory ofrational ignoranceholds that people will not vote if the costs of becoming\ninformed and voting are too high, or they feel their vote will not be decisive in the election.\nIn a 1957 work,An Economic Theory of Democracy, the economistAnthony Downsstated the problem this\nway: \u201cIt seems probable that for a great many citizens in a democracy, rational behavior excludes any\ninvestment whatever in political information per se. No matter how significant a difference between parties is\nrevealed to the rational citizen by his free information, or how uncertain he is about which party to support, he\nrealizes that his vote has almost no chance of influencing the outcome\u2026 He will not even utilize all the free\ninformation available, since assimilating it takes time.\u201d In his classic 1948 novelWalden Two, the psychologist\nB. F. Skinner puts the issue even more succinctly via one of his characters, who states: \u201cThe chance that one\nman\u2019s vote will decide the issue in a national election\u2026is less than the chance that he will be killed on his way\nto the polls.\u201d The following Clear It Up feature explores another aspect of the election process: spending.\nCLEAR IT UP\nHow much is too much to spend on an election?\nIn the 2020 elections, it is estimated that spending for president, Congress, and state and local offices amounted to\n$14.4 billion, more than twice what had been spent in 2016. The money raised went to the campaigns, including\nadvertising, fundraising, travel, and staff. Many people worry that politicians spend too much time raising money\nand end up entangled with special interest groups that make major donations. Critics would prefer a system that\nrestricts what candidates can spend, perhaps in exchange for limited public campaign financing or free television\nadvertising time.\nHow much spending on campaigns is too much? Five billion dollars will buy many potato chips, but in the U.S.\neconomy, which was nearly $21 trillion in 2020, the $14.4 billion spent on political campaigns was about 1/15th of\n1% of the overall economy. Here is another way to think about campaign spending.Totalgovernment spending\nprograms in 2020, including federal and state governments, was about $8.8 trillion, so the cost of choosing the\npeople who would determine how to spend this money was less than 2/10 of 1% of that. In the context of the\nenormous U.S. economy, $14.4 billion is not as much money as it sounds. U.S. consumers spend almost $2 billion\nper year on toothpaste and $7 billion on hair care products. In 2020, Proctor and Gamble spent almost $5 billion on\nadvertising. It may seem peculiar that one company\u2019s spending on advertisements amounts to one third of what is\nspent on presidential and other elections.\nWhatever we believe about whether candidates and their parties spend too much or too little on elections, the U.S.\nSupreme Court has placed limits on how government can limit campaign spending. In a 1976 decision,Buckley v.\nValeo, the Supreme Court emphasized that the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution specifies freedom of\nspeech. The federal government and states can offer candidates a voluntary deal in which government makes some\npublic financing available to candidates, but only if the candidates agree to abide by certain spending limits. Of\ncourse, candidates can also voluntarily agree to set certain spending limits if they wish. However, government\ncannot forbid people or organizations to raise and spend money above these limits if they choose.\nIn 2002, Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed into law theBipartisan Campaign Reform Act\n(BCRA). The relatively noncontroversial portions of the act strengthen the rules requiring full and speedy disclosure\nof who contributes money to campaigns. However, some controversial portions of the Act limit the ability of\nindividuals and groups to make certain kinds of political donations and they ban certain kinds of advertising in the\nmonths leading up to an election. Some called these bans into question after the release of two films: Michael\nMoore\u2019sFahrenheit 9/11and Citizens United\u2019sHillary: The Movie. At question was whether each film sought to 438 18 \u2022 Public Economy\ndiscredit political candidates for office too close to an election, in violation of the BCRA. The lower courts found that\nMoore\u2019s film did not violate the Act, while Citizens United\u2019s did. The fight reached the Supreme Court, asCitizens\nUnited v. Federal Election Commission, saying that the First Amendment protects the rights of corporations as well\nas individuals to donate to political campaigns. The Court ruled, in a 5\u20134 decision, that the spending limits were\nunconstitutional. This controversial decision, which essentially allows unlimited contributions by corporations to\npolitical action committees, overruled several previous decisions and will likely be revisited in the future, due to the\nstrength of the public reaction. For now, it has resulted in a sharp increase in election spending.\nWhile many U.S. adults do not bother to vote in presidential elections, more than half do. What motivates\nthem? Research on voting behavior has indicated that people who are more settled or more \u201cconnected\u201d to\nsociety tend to vote more frequently. According to theWashington Post, more married people vote than single\npeople. Those with a job vote more than the unemployed. Those who have lived longer in a neighborhood are\nmore likely to vote than newcomers. Those who report that they know their neighbors and talk to them are\nmore likely to vote than socially isolated people. Those with a higher income and level of education are also\nmore likely to vote. These factors suggest that politicians are likely to focus more on the interests of married,\nemployed, well-educated people with at least a middle-class level of income than on the interests of other\ngroups. For example, those who vote may tend to be more supportive of financial assistance for the two-year\nand four-year colleges they expect their children to attend than they are of medical care or public school\neducation aimed at families of unemployed people and those experiencing poverty.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/votergroups)to see a breakdown of how different groups voted in 2020.\nThere have been many proposals to encourage greater voter turnout: making it easier to register to vote,\nkeeping the polls open for more hours, or even moving Election Day to the weekend, when fewer people need\nto worry about jobs or school commitments. However, such changes do not seem to have caused a long-term\nupward trend in the number of people voting. After all, casting an informed vote will always impose some costs\nof time and energy. It is not clear how to strengthen people\u2019s feeling of connectedness to society in a way that\nwill lead to a substantial increase in voter turnout. Without greater voter turnout, however, politicians elected\nby the votes of 60% or fewer of the population may not enact economic policy in the best interests of 100% of\nthe population. Meanwhile, countering a long trend toward making voting easier, many states have recently\nenacted new voting laws that critics say are actually barriers to voting. States have passed laws reducing early\nvoting, restricting groups who are organizing get-out-the-vote efforts, enacted strict photo ID laws, as well as\nlaws that require showing proof of U.S. citizenship. The ACLU argues that while these laws profess to prevent\nvoter fraud, they are in effect making it harder for individuals to cast their vote.\n18.2Special Interest Politics\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain how special interest groups and lobbyists can influence campaigns and elections\n\u2022 Describe pork-barrel spending and logrolling\nMany political issues are of intense interest to a relatively small group, as we noted above. For example, many\nU.S. drivers do not much care where their car tires were made\u2014they just want good quality as inexpensively as\npossible. In September 2009, President Obama and Congress enacted atariff(taxes added on imported goods)\non tires imported from China that would increase the price by 35 percent in its first year, 30 percent in its\nsecond year, and 25 percent in its third year. Interestingly, the U.S. companies that make tires did not favor this\nstep, because most of them also import tires from China and other countries. (SeeGlobalization and\nProtectionismfor more on tariffs.) However, the United Steelworkers union, which had seen jobs in the tire\nAccess for free at openstax.org 18.2 \u2022 Special Interest Politics 439\nindustry fall by 5,000 over the previous five years, lobbied fiercely for the tariff. With this tariff, the cost of all\ntires increased significantly. (See the closing Bring It Home feature at the end of this chapter for more\ninformation on the tire tariff.)\nSpecial interest groupsare groups that are small in number relative to the nation, but quite well organized\nand focused on a specific issue. A special interest group can pressure legislators to enact public policies that\ndo not benefit society as a whole. Imagine an environmental rule to reduce air pollution that will cost 10 large\ncompanies $8 million each, for a total cost of $80 million. The social benefits from enacting this rule provide\nan average benefit of $10 for every person in the United States, for a total of about $3 trillion. Even though the\nbenefits are far higher than the costs for society as a whole, the 10 companies are likely to lobby much more\nfiercely to avoid $8 million in costs than the average person is to argue for $10 worth of benefits.\nAs this example suggests, we can relate the problem of special interests in politics to an issue we raised in\nEnvironmental Protection and Negative Externalitiesabout economic policy with respect tonegative\nexternalitiesand pollution\u2014the problem calledregulatory capture(which we defined inMonopoly and\nAntitrust Policy). In legislative bodies and agencies that write laws and regulations about how much\ncorporations will pay in taxes, or rules for safety in the workplace, or instructions on how to satisfy\nenvironmental regulations, you can be sure the specific industry affected haslobbyistswho study every word\nand every comma. They talk with the legislators who are writing the legislation and suggest alternative\nwording. They contribute to the campaigns of legislators on the key committees\u2014and may even offer those\nlegislators high-paying jobs after they have left office. As a result, it often turns out that those regulated can\nexercise considerable influence over the regulators.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/lobbying)to read about lobbying.\nIn the early 2000s, about 40 million people in the United States were eligible forMedicare, a government\nprogram that provides health insurance for those 65 and older. On some issues, the elderly are a powerful\ninterest group. They donate money and time to political campaigns, and in the 2020 presidential election, 76%\nof those ages 65\u201374 voted, while just 51% of those aged 18 to 24 cast a ballot, according to the U.S. Census.\nIn 2003, Congress passed and President George Bush signed into law a substantial expansion of Medicare that\nhelped the elderly to pay for prescription drugs. The prescription drug benefit cost the federal government\nabout $40 billion in 2006, and the Medicare system projected that the annual cost would rise to $121 billion by\n2016. The political pressure to pass a prescription drug benefit for Medicare was apparently quite high, while\nthe political pressure to assist the 40 million with no health insurance at all was considerably lower. One\nreason might be that the American Association for Retired PeopleAARP, a well-funded and well-organized\nlobbying group represents senior citizens, while there is no umbrella organization to lobby for those without\nhealth insurance.\nIn the battle over passage of the 2010Affordable Care Act (ACA), which became known as \u201cObamacare,\u201d there\nwas heavy lobbying on all sides by insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies. However, labor\nunions and community groups financed a lobby group,Health Care for America Now (HCAN), to offset\ncorporate lobbying. HCAN, spending $60 million dollars, was successful in helping pass legislation which\nadded new regulations on insurance companies and a mandate that all individuals will obtain health\ninsurance by 2014. The following Work It Out feature further explains voter incentives and lobbyist influence. 440 18 \u2022 Public Economy\nWORK IT OUT\nPaying To Get Your Way\nSuppose Congress proposes a tax on carbon emissions for certain factories in a small town of 10,000 people.\nCongress estimates the tax will reduce pollution to such an extent that it will benefit each resident by an\nequivalent of $300. The tax will also reduce profits to the town\u2019s two large factories by $1 million each. How\nmuch should the factory owners be willing to spend to fight the tax passage, and how much should the\ntownspeople be willing to pay to support it? Why is society unlikely to achieve the optimal outcome?\nStep 1. The two factory owners each stand to lose $1 million if the tax passes, so each should be willing to spend\nup to that amount to prevent the passage, a combined sum of $2 million. Of course, in the real world, there is no\nguarantee that lobbying efforts will be successful, so the factory owners may choose to invest an amount that is\nsubstantially lower.\nStep 2. There are 10,000 townspeople, each standing to benefit by $300 if the tax passes. Theoretically, then,\nthey should be willing to spend up to $3 million (10,000 \u00d7 $300) to ensure passage. (Again, in the real world with\nno guarantees of success, they may choose to spend less.)\nStep 3. It is costly and difficult for 10,000 people to coordinate in such a way as to influence public policy. Since\neach person stands to gain only $300, many may feel lobbying is not worth the effort.\nStep 4. The two factory owners, however, find it very easy and profitable to coordinate their activities, so they\nhave a greater incentive to do so.\nSpecial interests may develop a close relationship with one political party, so their ability to influence\nlegislation rises and falls as that party moves in or out of power. A special interest may even hurt a political\nparty if it appears to a number of voters that the relationship is too cozy. In a close election, a small group that\nhas been under-represented in the past may find that it can tip the election one way or another\u2014so that group\nwill suddenly receive considerable attention. Democratic institutions produce an ebb and flow of political\nparties and interests and thus offer both opportunities for special interests and ways of counterbalancing\nthose interests over time.\nIdentifiable Winners, Anonymous Losers\nA number of economic policies produce gains whose beneficiaries are easily identifiable, but costs that are\npartly or entirely shared by a large number who remain anonymous. A democratic political system probably\nhas a bias toward those who are identifiable.\nFor example, policies that imposeprice controls\u2014like rent control\u2014may look as if they benefit renters and\nimpose costs only on landlords. However, when landlords then decide to reduce the number of rental units\navailable in the area, a number of people who would have liked to rent an apartment end up living somewhere\nelse because no units were available. These would-be renters have experienced a cost of rent control, but it is\nhard to identify who they are.\nSimilarly, policies that block imports will benefit the firms that would have competed with those imports\u2014and\nworkers at those firms\u2014who are likely to be quite visible. Consumers who would have preferred to purchase\nthe imported products, and who thus bear some costs of the protectionist policy, are much less visible.\nSpecific tax breaks and spending programs also have identifiable winners and impose costs on others who are\nhard to identify. Special interests are more likely to arise from a group that is easily identifiable, rather than\nfrom a group where some of those who suffer may not even recognize they are bearing costs.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 18.2 \u2022 Special Interest Politics 441\nPork Barrels and Logrolling\nPoliticians have an incentive to ensure that they spend government money in their home state or district,\nwhere it will benefit their constituents in a direct and obvious way. Thus, when legislators are negotiating over\nwhether to support a piece of legislation, they commonly ask each other to includepork-barrel spending,\nlegislation that benefits mainly a single political district. Pork-barrel spending is another case in which\nconcentrated benefits and widely dispersed costs challenge democracy: the benefits of pork-barrel spending\nare obvious and direct to local voters, while the costs are spread over the entire country. Read the following\nClear It Up feature for more information on pork-barrel spending.\nCLEAR IT UP\nHow much impact can pork-barrel spending have?\nMany observers widely regard U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, who was originally elected to the Senate\nin 1958 and served until 2010, as one of the masters of pork-barrel politics, directing a steady stream of federal\nfunds to his home state. A journalist once compiled a list of structures in West Virginia at least partly government\nfunded and named after Byrd: \u201cthe Robert C. Byrd Highway; the Robert C. Byrd Locks and Dam; the Robert C. Byrd\nInstitute; the Robert C. Byrd Life Long Learning Center; the Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship Program; the Robert\nC. Byrd Green Bank Telescope; the Robert C. Byrd Institute for Advanced Flexible Manufacturing; the Robert C. Byrd\nFederal Courthouse; the Robert C. Byrd Health Sciences Center; the Robert C. Byrd Academic and Technology\nCenter; the Robert C. Byrd United Technical Center; the Robert C. Byrd Federal Building; the Robert C. Byrd Drive;\nthe Robert C. Byrd Hilltop Office Complex; the Robert C. Byrd Library; and the Robert C. Byrd Learning Resource\nCenter; the Robert C. Byrd Rural Health Center.\u201d This list does not include government-funded projects in West\nVirginia that were not named after Byrd. Of course, we would have to analyze each of these expenditures in detail to\nfigure out whether we should treat them as pork-barrel spending or whether they provide widespread benefits that\nreach beyond West Virginia. At least some of them, or a portion of them, certainly would fall into that category.\nBecause there are currently no term limits for Congressional representatives, those who have been in office longer\ngenerally have more power to enact pork-barrel projects.\nThe amount that government spends on individual pork-barrel projects is small, but many small projects can\nadd up to a substantial total. A nonprofit watchdog organization, called Citizens against Government Waste,\nproduces an annual report, thePig Bookthat attempts to quantify the amount of pork-barrel spending,\nfocusing on items that only one member of Congress requested, that were passed into law without any public\nhearings, or that serve only a local purpose. Whether any specific item qualifies as pork can be controversial.\nThe 2021 Congressional Pig Book identified 285 earmarks in FY 2021, with a cost of $16.8 billion. Recent\ngrowth in earmarks and their cost is apparent: in FY 2017, there were 163 earmarks at a cost of $6.8 billion.\nHence, in only four years, there was a 75% increase in the number of earmarks and a 147% increase in the\ncost of those earmarks.\nLogrolling, an action in which all members of a group of legislators agree to vote for a package of otherwise\nunrelated laws that they individually favor, can encourage pork barrel spending. For example, if one member\nof the U.S. Congress suggests building a new bridge or hospital in their own congressional district, the other\nmembers might oppose it. However, if 51% of the legislators come together, they can pass a bill that includes a\nbridge or hospital for every one of their districts.\nAs a reflection of this interest of legislators in their own districts, the U.S. government has typically spread out\nits spending on military bases and weapons programs to congressional districts all across the country. In part,\nthe government does this to help create a situation that encourages members of Congress to vote in support of\ndefense spending. 442 18 \u2022 Public Economy\n18.3Flaws in the Democratic System of Government\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Assess the median voter theory\n\u2022 Explain the voting cycle\n\u2022 Analyze the interrelationship between markets and government\nMost developed countries today have a democratic system of government: citizens express their opinions\nthrough votes and those votes affect the direction of the country. The advantage of democracy over other\nsystems is that it allows everyone in a society an equal say and therefore may reduce the possibility of a small\ngroup of wealthy oligarchs oppressing the masses. There is no such thing as a perfect system, and democracy,\nfor all its popularity, is not without its problems, a few of which we will examine here.\nWe sometimes sum up and oversimplifydemocracyin two words: \u201cMajority rule.\u201d When voters face three or\nmore choices, however, then voting may not always be a useful way of determining what the majority prefers.\nAs one example, consider an election in a state where 60% of the population is liberal and 40% is conservative.\nIf there are only two candidates, one from each side, and if liberals and conservatives vote in the same 60\u201340\nproportions in which they are represented in the population, then the liberal will win. What if the election ends\nup including two liberal candidates and one conservative? It is possible that the liberal vote will split and\nvictory will go to the minority party. In this case, the outcome does not reflect the majority\u2019s preference.\nDoes the majority view prevail in the case of sugarquotas? Clearly there are more sugar consumers in the\nUnited States than sugar producers, but the U.S. domestic sugar lobby (www.sugarcane.org) has successfully\nargued for protection against imports since 1789. By law, therefore, U.S. cookie and candy makers must use\n85% domestic sugar in their products. Meanwhile quotas on imported sugar restrict supply and keep the\ndomestic sugar price up\u2014raising prices for companies that use sugar in producing their goods and for\nconsumers. The European Union allows sugar imports, and prices there are 40% lower than U.S. sugar prices.\nSugar-producing countries in the Caribbean repeatedly protest the U.S. quotas at the World Trade\nOrganization meetings, but each bite of cookie, at present, costs you more than if there were no sugar lobby.\nThis case goes against the theory of the \u201cmedian\u201d voter in a democracy. Themedian voter theoryargues that\npoliticians will try to match policies to what pleases the median voter preferences. If we think of political\npositions along a spectrum from left to right, the median voter is in the middle of the spectrum. This theory\nargues that actual policy will reflect \u201cmiddle of the road.\u201d In the case of sugar lobby politics, theminority, not\nthe median, dominates policy.\nSometimes it is not even clear how to define the majority opinion. Step aside from politics for a moment and\nthink about a choice facing three families (the Ortegas, the Schmidts, and the Alexanders) who are planning to\ncelebrate New Year\u2019s Day together. They agree to vote on the menu, choosing from three entrees, and they\nagree that the majority vote wins. With three families, it seems reasonable that one producing choice will get a\n2\u20131 majority. What if, however, their vote ends up looking likeTable 18.1?\nClearly, the three families disagree on their first choice. However, the problem goes even deeper. Instead of\nlooking at all three choices at once, compare them two at a time. (SeeFigure 18.2) In a vote of turkey versus\nbeef, turkey wins by 2\u20131. In a vote of beef versus lasagna, beef wins 2\u20131. If turkey beats beef, and beef beats\nlasagna, then it might seem only logical that turkey must also beat lasagna. However, with the preferences,\nlasagna is preferred to turkey by a 2\u20131 vote, as well. If lasagna is preferred to turkey, and turkey beats beef,\nthen surely it must be that lasagna also beats beef? Actually, no. Beef beats lasagna. In other words, the\nmajority view may not win.

If it cannot change its ways, it will go out of business. This self-correcting mechanism\nin the marketplace can have harsh effects on workers or on local economies, but it also puts pressure on firms\nfor good performance.\nGovernment agencies, however, do not sell their products in a market. They receive tax dollars instead. They\nare not challenged by competitors as are private-sector firms. If the U.S. Department of Education or the U.S.\nDepartment of Defense is performing poorly, citizens cannot purchase their services from another provider\nand drive the existing government agencies into bankruptcy. If you are upset that the Internal Revenue Service 444 18 \u2022 Public Economy\nis slow in sending you a tax refund or seems unable to answer your questions, you cannot decide to pay your\nincome taxes through a different organization. Of course, elected politicians can assign new leaders to\ngovernment agencies and instruct them to reorganize or to emphasize a different mission. The pressure\ngovernment faces, however, to change its bureaucracy, to seek greater efficiency, and to improve customer\nresponsiveness is much milder than the threat of being put out of business altogether.\nThis insight suggests that when government provides goods or services directly, we might expect it to do so\nwith less efficiency than private firms\u2014except in certain cases where the government agency may compete\ndirectly with private firms. At the local level, for example, government can provide directly services like\ngarbage collection, using private firms under contract to the government, or by a mix of government\nemployees competing with private firms.\nA Balanced View of Markets and Government\nThe British statesman Sir Winston Churchill (1874\u20131965) once wrote: \u201cNo one pretends that democracy is\nperfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except for all of the\nother forms which have been tried from time to time.\u201d In that spirit, the theme of this discussion is certainly\nnot that we should abandon democratic government. A practical student of public policy needs to recognize\nthat in some cases, like the case of well-organized special interests or pork-barrel legislation, a democratic\ngovernment may seek to enact economically unwise projects or programs. In other cases, by placing a low\npriority on the problems of those who are not well organized or who are less likely to vote, the government may\nfail to act when it could do some good. In these and other cases, there is no automatic reason to believe that\ngovernment will necessarily make economically sensible choices.\n\u201cThe true test of a first-rate mind is the ability to hold two contradictory ideas at the same time,\u201d wrote the\nAmerican author F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896\u20131940). At this point in your study of microeconomics, you should be\nable to go one better than Fitzgerald and hold three somewhat contradictory ideas about the interrelationship\nbetween markets and government in your mind at the same time.\nFirst, markets are extraordinarily useful and flexible institutions through which society can allocate its scarce\nresources. We introduced this idea with the subjects of international trade and demand and supply in other\nchapters and reinforced it in all the subsequent discussions of how households and firms make decisions.\nSecond, markets may sometimes produce unwanted results. A short list of the cases in which markets produce\nunwanted results includes monopoly and other cases of imperfect competition, pollution, poverty and\ninequality of incomes, discrimination, and failure to provide insurance.\nThird, while government may play a useful role in addressing the problems of markets, government action is\nalso imperfect and may not reflect majority views. Economists readily admit that, in settings like monopoly or\nnegative externalities, a potential role exists for government intervention. However, in the real world, it is not\nenough to point out that government action might be a good idea. Instead, we must have some confidence that\nthe government is likely to identify and carry out the appropriate public policy. To make sensible judgments\nabout economic policy, we must see the strengths and weaknesses of both markets and government. We must\nnot idealize or demonize either unregulated markets or government actions. Instead, consider the actual\nstrengths and weaknesses of real-world markets and real-world governments.\nThese three insights seldom lead to simple or obvious political conclusions. As the famous British economist\nJoan Robinsonwrote some decades ago: \u201c[E]conomic theory, in itself, preaches no doctrines and cannot\nestablish any universally valid laws. It is a method of ordering ideas and formulating questions.\u201d The study of\neconomics is neither politically conservative, nor moderate, nor liberal. There are economists who are\nDemocrats, Republicans, libertarians, socialists, and members of every other political group you can name. Of\ncourse, conservatives may tend to emphasize the virtues of markets and the limitations of government, while\nliberals may tend to emphasize the shortcomings of markets and the need for government programs. Such\ndifferences only illustrate that the language and terminology of economics is not limited to one set of political\nAccess for free at openstax.org 18.3 \u2022 Flaws in the Democratic System of Government 445\nbeliefs, but can be used by all.\nBRING IT HOME\nChinese Tire Tariffs\nIn April 2009, the union representing U.S. tire manufacturing workers filed a request with the U.S.International\nTrade Commission (ITC), asking it to investigate tire imports from China. Under U.S. trade law, if imports from a\ncountry increase to the point that they cause market disruption in the United States, as determined by the ITC, then\nit can also recommend a remedy for this market disruption. In this case, the ITC determined that from 2004 to\n2008, U.S. tire manufacturers suffered declines in production, financial health, and employment as a direct result of\nincreases in tire imports from China. The ITC recommended placing an additional tax on tire imports from China.\nPresident Obama and Congress agreed with the ITC recommendation, and in June 2009 tariffs on Chinese tires\nincreased from 4% to 39%. In addition, tariffs on Chinese tires increased further as part of President Trump\u2019s\nincreases on a broad range of Chinese products.\nWhy would U.S. consumers buy imported tires from China in the first place? Most likely, because they are cheaper\nthan tires produced domestically or in other countries. Therefore, this tariff increase should cause U.S. consumers to\npay higher prices for tires, either because Chinese tires are now more expensive, or because U.S. consumers are\npushed by the tariff to buy more expensive tires made by U.S. manufacturers or those from other countries. In the\nend, this tariff made U.S. consumers pay more for tires.\nWas this tariff met with outrage expressed via social media, traditional media, or mass protests? Were there\n\u201cOccupy Wall Street-type\u201d demonstrations? The answer is a resounding \u201cNo\u201d. Most U.S. tire consumers were likely\nunaware of the tariff increase, although they may have noticed the price increase, which was between $4 and $13\ndepending on the type of tire. Tire consumers are also potential voters. Conceivably, a tax increase, even a small\none, might make voters unhappy. However, voters probably realized that it was not worth their time to learn\nanything about this issue or cast a vote based on it. They probably thought their vote would not matter in\ndetermining the outcome of an election or changing this policy.\nEstimates of the impact of this tariff show it costs U.S. consumers around $1.11 billion annually. Of this amount,\nroughly $817 million ends up in the pockets of foreign tire manufacturers other than in China, and the remaining\n$294 million goes to U.S. tire manufacturers. In other words, the tariff increase on Chinese tires may have saved\n1,200 jobs in the domestic tire sector, but it cost 3,700 jobs in other sectors, as consumers had to reduce their\nspending because they were paying more for tires. People actually lost their jobs as a result of this tariff. Workers in\nU.S. tire manufacturing firms earned about $40,000 in 2010. Given the number of jobs saved and the total cost to\nU.S. consumers, the cost of saving one job amounted to $926,500!\nThis tariff caused a net decline in U.S. social surplus. (We discuss total surplus in theDemand and Supplychapter,\nand tariffs in theIntroduction to International Tradechapter.) Instead of saving jobs, it cost jobs, and those jobs that\nit saved cost many times more than the people working in them could ever hope to earn. Why would the government\ndo this?\nThe chapter answers this question by discussing the influence special interest groups have on economic policy. The\nsteelworkers union, whose members make tires, saw increasingly more members lose their jobs as U.S. consumers\nconsumed increasingly more cheap Chinese tires. By definition, this union is relatively small but well organized,\nespecially compared to tire consumers. It stands to gain much for each of its members, compared to what each tire\nconsumer may have to give up in terms of higher prices. Thus, the steelworkers union (joined by domestic tire\nmanufacturers) has not only the means but the incentive to lobby economic policymakers and lawmakers. Given\nthat U.S. tire consumers are a large and unorganized group, if they even are a group, it is unlikely they will lobby\nagainst higher tire tariffs. In the end, lawmakers tend to listen to those who lobby them, even though the results\nmake for bad economic policy. 446 18 \u2022 Key Terms\nKey Terms\nlogrolling the situation in which groups of legislators all agree to vote for a package of otherwise unrelated\nlaws that they individually favor\nmedian voter theory theory that politicians will try to match policies to what pleases the median voter\npreferences\npork-barrel spending spending that benefits mainly a single political district\nrational ignorance the theory that rational people will not vote if the costs of becoming informed and voting\nare too high or because they know their vote will not be decisive in the election\nspecial interest groups groups that are small in number relative to the nation, but well organized and thus\nexert a disproportionate effect on political outcomes\nvoting cycle the situation in which a majority prefers A over B, B over C, and C over A\nKey Concepts and Summary\n18.1Voter Participation and Costs of Elections\nThe theory of rational ignorance says voters will recognize that their single vote is extremely unlikely to\ninfluence the outcome of an election. As a consequence, they will choose to remain uninformed about issues\nand not vote. This theory helps explain why voter turnout is so low in the United States.\n18.2Special Interest Politics\nSpecial interest politics arises when a relatively small group, called a special interest group, each of whose\nmembers has a large interest in a political outcome, devotes considerable time and energy to lobbying for the\ngroup\u2019s preferred choice. Meanwhile, the large majority, each of whose members has only a small interest in\nthis issue, pays no attention.\nWe define pork--barrel spending as legislation whose benefits are concentrated on a single district while the\ncosts are spread widely over the country. Logrolling refers to a situation in which two or more legislators agree\nto vote for each other\u2019s legislation, which can then encourage pork-barrel spending in many districts.\n18.3Flaws in the Democratic System of Government\nMajority votes can run into difficulties when more than two choices exist. A voting cycle occurs when, in a\nsituation with at least three choices, choice A is preferred by a majority vote to choice B, choice B is preferred\nby a majority vote to choice C, and choice C is preferred by a majority vote to choice A. In such a situation, it is\nimpossible to identify what the majority prefers. Another difficulty arises when the vote is so divided that no\nchoice receives a majority.\nA practical approach to microeconomic policy will need to take a realistic view of the specific strengths and\nweaknesses of markets as well as government, rather than making the easy but wrong assumption that either\nthe market or government is always beneficial or always harmful.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

How Does One Tell?\nThe 1990s were boom years for the U.S. economy. Beginning in the late 2000s, from 2007 to 2014, economic\nperformance in the U.S. was poor. The economy experienced another period of strong growth between 2014 and\n2019, before COVID-19 rocked the world economy in March and April of 2020. What causes the economy to expand\nor contract? Why do businesses fail when they are making all the right decisions? Why do workers lose their jobs\nwhen they are hardworking and productive? Are bad economic times a failure of the market system? Are they a 450 19 \u2022 The Macroeconomic Perspective\nfailure of the government? These are all questions of macroeconomics, which we will begin to address in this\nchapter. We will not be able to answer all of these questions here, but we will start with the basics: How is the\neconomy doing? How can we tell?\nThe macro economy includes all buying and selling, all production and consumption; everything that goes on in\nevery market in the economy. How can we get a handle on that? The answer begins more than 80 years ago, during\nthe Great Depression. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his economic advisers knew things were bad\u2014but how\ncould they express and measure just how bad it was? An economist named Simon Kuznets, who later won the Nobel\nPrize for his work, came up with a way to track what the entire economy is producing. In this chapter, you will learn\nhow the government constructs GDP, how we use it, and why it is so important.\nMacroeconomics focuses on the economy as a whole (or on whole economies as they interact). What causes\nrecessions? What makes unemployment stay high when recessions are supposed to be over? Why do some\ncountries grow faster than others? Why do some countries have higher standards of living than others? These\nare all questions that macroeconomics addresses. Macroeconomics involves adding up the economic activity\nof all households and all businesses in all markets to obtain the overall demand and supply in the economy.\nHowever, when we do that, something curious happens. It is not unusual that what results at the macro level is\ndifferent from the sum of the microeconomic parts. What seems sensible from a microeconomic point of view\ncan have unexpected or counterproductive results at the macroeconomic level. Imagine that you are sitting at\nan event with a large audience, like a live concert or a basketball game. A few people decide that they want a\nbetter view, and so they stand up. However, when these people stand up, they block the view for other people,\nand the others need to stand up as well if they wish to see. Eventually, nearly everyone is standing up, and as a\nresult, no one can see much better than before. The rational decision of some individuals at the micro level\u2014to\nstand up for a better view\u2014ended up as self-defeating at the macro level. This is not macroeconomics, but it is\nan apt analogy.\nMacroeconomics is a rather massive subject. How are we going to tackle it?Figure 19.2illustrates the structure\nwe will use. We will study macroeconomics from three different perspectives:\n1. What are the macroeconomic goals? (Macroeconomics as a discipline does not have goals, but we do have\ngoals for the macro economy.)\n2. What are the frameworks economists can use to analyze the macroeconomy?\n3. Finally, what are the policy tools governments can use to manage the macroeconomy?\nFIGURE19.2Macroeconomic Goals, Framework, and PoliciesThis chart shows what macroeconomics is about.\nThe box on the left indicates a consensus of what are the most important goals for the macro economy, the middle\nbox lists the frameworks economists use to analyze macroeconomic changes (such as inflation or recession), and\nthe box on the right indicates the two tools the federal government uses to influence the macro economy.\nGoals\nIn thinking about the macroeconomy's overall health, it is useful to consider three primary goals: economic\ngrowth, low unemployment, and low inflation.\n\u2022 Economic growth ultimately determines the prevailing standard of living in a country. Economists\nmeasure growth by the percentage change in real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product. A growth\nAccess for free at openstax.org 19.1 \u2022 Measuring the Size of the Economy: Gross Domestic Product 451\nrate of more than 3% is considered good.\n\u2022 Unemployment, as measured by the unemployment rate, is the percentage of people in the labor force\nwho do not have a job. When people lack jobs, the economy is wasting a precious resource-labor, and the\nresult is lower goods and services produced. Unemployment, however, is more than a statistic\u2014it\nrepresents people\u2019s livelihoods. While measured unemployment is unlikely to ever be zero, economists\nconsider a measured unemployment rate of 5% or less low (good).\n\u2022 Inflation is a sustained increase in the overall level of prices, and is measured by the consumer price\nindex. If many people face a situation where the prices that they pay for food, shelter, and healthcare are\nrising much faster than the wages they receive for their labor, there will be widespread unhappiness as\ntheir standard of living declines. For that reason, low inflation\u2014an inflation rate of 1\u20132%\u2014is a major goal.\nFrameworks\nAs you learn in the micro part of this book, principal tools that economists use are theories and models (see\nWelcome to Economics!for more on this). In microeconomics, we used the theories of supply and demand. In\nmacroeconomics, we use the theories ofaggregate demand (AD)andaggregate supply (AS). This book presents\ntwo perspectives on macroeconomics: the Neoclassical perspective and the Keynesian perspective, each of\nwhich has its own version of AD and AS. Between the two perspectives, you will obtain a good understanding of\nwhat drives the macroeconomy.\nPolicy Tools\nNational governments have two tools for influencing the macroeconomy. The first is monetary policy, which\ninvolves managing the money supply and interest rates. The second is fiscal policy, which involves changes in\ngovernment spending/purchases and taxes.\nWe will explain each of the items inFigure 19.2in detail in one or more other chapters. As you learn these\nthings, you will discover that the goals and the policy tools are in the news almost every day.\n19.1Measuring the Size of the Economy: Gross Domestic Product\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Identify the components of GDP on the demand side and on the supply side\n\u2022 Evaluate how economists measure gross domestic product (GDP)\n\u2022 Contrast and calculate GDP, net exports, and net national product\nMacroeconomics is an empirical subject, so the first step toward understanding it is to measure the economy.\nHow large is the U.S. economy? Economists typically measure the size of a nation\u2019s overall economy by its\ngross domestic product (GDP), which is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country in\na given year. Measuring GDP involves counting the production of millions of different goods and\nservices\u2014smart phones, cars, music downloads, computers, steel, bananas, college educations, and all other\nnew goods and services that a country produced in the current year\u2014and summing them into a total dollar\nvalue. This task is straightforward: take the quantity of everything produced, multiply it by the price at which\neach product sold, and add up the total. In 2020, the U.S. GDP totaled $20.9 trillion, the largest GDP in the\nworld.\nEach of the market transactions that enter into GDP must involve both a buyer and a seller. We can measure an\neconomy's GDP either by the total dollar value of what consumers purchase in the economy, or by the total\ndollar value of what is the country produces. There is even a third way, as we will explain later.\nGDP Measured by Components of Demand\nWho buys all of this production? We can divide thisdemandinto four main parts: consumer spending\n(consumption), business spending (investment), government spending on goods and services, and spending 452 19 \u2022 The Macroeconomic Perspective\non net exports. (See the following Clear It Up feature to understand what we mean by investment.)Table 19.1\nshows how these four components added up to the GDP in 2020,Figure 19.4(a) shows the levels of\nconsumption, investment, and government purchases over time, expressed as a percentage of GDP, while\nFigure 19.4(b) shows the levels of exports and imports as a percentage of GDP over time. A few patterns about\neach of these components are worth noticing.Table 19.1shows the components of GDP from the demand side.\nComponents of GDP on the Demand Side (in trillions of dollars) Percentage of Total\nConsumption $14.0 67.2%\nInvestment $3.6 17.4%\nGovernment $3.9 18.5%\nExports $2.1 10.2%\nImports \u2013$2.7 \u201313.3%\nTotal GDP $20.9 100%\nTABLE19.1Components of U.S. GDP in 2022: From the Demand Side(Source: http://bea.gov/iTable/\nindex_nipa.cfm, Table 1.1.5)\nFIGURE19.3Percentage of Components of U.S. GDP on the Demand SideConsumption makes up over half of the\ndemand side components of the GDP. Totals in the chart do not add to 100% due to rounding. (Source:\nhttp://bea.gov/iTable/index_nipa.cfm, Table 1.1.10)\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat does the word \u201cinvestment\u201d mean?\nWhat do economists mean by investment, or business spending? In calculating GDP, investment does not refer to\npurchasing stocks and bonds or trading financial assets. It refers to purchasing new capital goods, that is, new\ncommercial real estate (such as buildings, factories, and stores) and equipment, residential housing construction,\nand inventories. Inventories that manufacturers produce this year are included in this year\u2019s GDP\u2014even if they are\nnot yet sold. From the accountant\u2019s perspective, it is as if the firm invested in its own inventories. Business\ninvestment in 2020 was $3.6 trillion, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 19.1 \u2022 Measuring the Size of the Economy: Gross Domestic Product 453\nFIGURE19.4Components of GDP on the Demand Side(a) Consumption is about two-thirds of GDP, and it has been\non a slight upward trend over time. Business investment hovers around 15% of GDP, but it fluctuates more than\nconsumption. Government spending on goods and services is slightly under 20% of GDP and has declined modestly\nover time. (b) Exports are added to total demand for goods and services, while imports are subtracted from total\ndemand. If exports exceed imports, as in most of the 1960s and 1970s in the U.S. economy, a trade surplus exists.\nIf imports exceed exports, as in recent years, then a trade deficit exists. (Source: http://bea.gov/iTable/\nindex_nipa.cfm, Table 1.1.10)\nConsumption expenditure by households is the largest component of GDP, accounting for about two-thirds of\nthe GDP in any year. This tells us that consumers\u2019 spending decisions are a major driver of the economy.\nHowever, consumer spending is a gentle elephant: when viewed over time, it does not jump around too much,\nand has increased modestly from about 60% of GDP in the 1960s and 1970s.\nInvestment expenditurerefers to purchases of physical plant and equipment, primarily by businesses. If\nStarbucks builds a new store, or Amazon buys robots, they count these expenditures under business\ninvestment.Investment demandis far smaller thanconsumption demand, typically accounting for only about\n15\u201318% of GDP, but it is very important for the economy because this is where jobs are created. However, it\nfluctuates more noticeably than consumption. Business investment is volatile. New technology or a new\nproduct can spur business investment, but then confidence can drop and business investment can pull back\nsharply.\nIf you have noticed any of the infrastructure projects (new bridges, highways, airports) launched during the\n2009 recession, or if you received a stimulus check during the pandemic-induced recession of 2020\u20132021, you\nhave seen how important government spending can be for the economy. Government expenditure in the\nUnited States is close to 20% of GDP, and includes spending by all three levels of government: federal, state,\nand local. The only part of government spending counted in demand is government purchases of goods or\nservices produced in the economy. Examples include the government buying a new fighter jet for the Air Force\n(federal government spending), building a new highway (state government spending), or a new school (local\ngovernment spending). A significant portion of government budgets consists of transfer payments, like\nunemployment benefits, veteran\u2019s benefits, and Social Security payments to retirees. The government\nexcludes these payments from GDP because it does not receive a new good or service in return or exchange.\nInstead they are transfers of income from taxpayers to others. If you are curious about the awesome\nundertaking of adding up GDP, read the following Clear It Up feature. 454 19 \u2022 The Macroeconomic Perspective\nCLEAR IT UP\nHow do statisticians measure GDP?\nGovernment economists at the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), within the U.S. Department of Commerce, piece\ntogether estimates of GDP from a variety of sources.\nOnce every five years, in the second and seventh year of each decade, the Bureau of the Census carries out a\ndetailed census of businesses throughout the United States. In between, the Census Bureau carries out a monthly\nsurvey of retail sales. The government adjusts these figures with foreign trade data to account for exports that are\nproduced in the United States and sold abroad and for imports that are produced abroad and sold here. Once every\nten years, the Census Bureau conducts a comprehensive survey of housing and residential finance. Together, these\nsources provide the main basis for figuring out what is produced for consumers.\nFor investment, the Census Bureau carries out a monthly survey of construction and an annual survey of\nexpenditures on physical capital equipment.\nFor what the federal government purchases, the statisticians rely on the U.S. Department of the Treasury. An annual\nCensus of Governments gathers information on state and local governments. Because the government spends a\nconsiderable amount at all levels hiring people to provide services, it also tracks a large portion of spending through\npayroll records that state governments and the Social Security Administration collect.\nWith regard to foreign trade, the Census Bureau compiles a monthly record of all import and export documents.\nAdditional surveys cover transportation and travel, and make adjustments for financial services that are produced in\nthe United States for foreign customers.\nMany other sources contribute to GDP estimates. Information on energy comes from the U.S. Department of\nTransportation and Department of Energy. The Agency for Health Care Research and Quality collects information on\nhealthcare. Surveys of landlords find out about rental income. The Department of Agriculture collects statistics on\nfarming.\nAll these bits and pieces of information arrive in different forms, at different time intervals. The BEA melds them\ntogether to produce GDP estimates on a quarterly basis (every three months). The BEA then \"annualizes\" these\nnumbers by multiplying by four. As more information comes in, the BEA updates and revises these estimates. BEA\nreleases the GDP \u201cadvance\u201d estimate for a certain quarter one month after a quarter. The \u201cpreliminary\u201d estimate\ncomes out one month after that. The BEA publishes the \u201cfinal\u201d estimate one month later, but it is not actually final.\nIn July, the BEA releases roughly updated estimates for the previous calendar year. Then, once every five years,\nafter it has processed all the results of the latest detailed five-year business census, the BEA revises all of the past\nGDP estimates according to the newest methods and data, going all the way back to 1929.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/beafaq)to read FAQs on the BEA site. You can even email your own\nquestions!\nWhen thinking about the demand for domestically produced goods in a global economy, it is important to\ncount spending on exports\u2014domestically produced goods that a country sells abroad. Similarly, we must also\nsubtract spending on imports\u2014goods that a country produces in other countries that residents of this country\npurchase. The GDP net export component is equal to the dollar value of exports (X) minus the dollar value of\nimports (M), (X \u2013 M). We call the gap between exports and imports thetrade balance. If a country\u2019s exports are\nlarger than its imports, then a country has atrade surplus. In the United States, exports typically exceeded\nimports in the 1960s and 1970s, asFigure 19.4(b) shows.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 19.1 \u2022 Measuring the Size of the Economy: Gross Domestic Product 455\nSince the early 1980s, imports have typically exceeded exports, and so the United States has experienced a\ntrade deficitin most years. The trade deficit grew quite large in the late 1990s and in the mid-2000s.Figure\n19.4(b) also shows that imports and exports have both risen substantially in recent decades, even after the\ndeclines during theGreat Recessionbetween 2008 and 2009. As we noted before, if exports and imports are\nequal, foreign trade has no effect on total GDP. However, even if exports and imports are balanced overall,\nforeign trade might still have powerful effects on particular industries and workers by causing nations to shift\nworkers and physical capital investment toward one industry rather than another.\nBased on these four components of demand, we can measure GDP as:\nUnderstanding how to measure GDP is important for analyzing connections in the macro economy and for\nthinking about macroeconomic policy tools.\nGDP Measured by What is Produced\nEverything that we purchase somebody must first produce.Table 19.2breaks down what a country produces\ninto five categories:durable goods,nondurable goods,services,structures, and the change ininventories.\nBefore going into detail about these categories, notice that total GDP measured according to what is produced\nis exactly the same as the GDP measured by looking at the five components of demand.Figure 19.5provides a\nvisual representation of this information.\nComponents of GDP on the Supply Side (in trillions of dollars) Percentage of Total\nGoods\nDurable goods $3.5 16.7%\nNondurable goods $2.8 13.4%\nServices $12.7 60.8%\nStructures $1.9 9.1%\nChange in inventories $0.0 0.0%\nTotal GDP $20.9 100%\nTABLE19.2Components of U.S. GDP on the Production Side, 2020(Source: http://bea.gov/iTable/\nindex_nipa.cfm, Table 1.2.5) 456 19 \u2022 The Macroeconomic Perspective\nFIGURE19.5Percentage of Components of GDP on the Production SideServices make up over 60 percent of the\nproduction side components of GDP in the United States.\nSince every market transaction must have both a buyer and a seller, GDP must be the same whether measured\nby what is demanded or by what is produced.Figure 19.6shows these components of what is produced,\nexpressed as a percentage of GDP, since 1950.\nFIGURE19.6Types of ProductionServices are the largest single component of total supply, representing over 60\npercent of GDP, up from about 45 percent in the early 1950s. Durable and nondurable goods constitute the\nmanufacturing sector, and they have declined from 40 percent of GDP in 1950 to about 30 percent in 2016.\nNondurable goods used to be larger than durable goods, but in recent years, nondurable goods have been dropping\nAccess for free at openstax.org 19.1 \u2022 Measuring the Size of the Economy: Gross Domestic Product 457\nto below the share of durable goods, which is less than 20% of GDP. Structures hover around 10% of GDP. We do\nnot show here the change in inventories, the final component of aggregate supply. It is typically less than 1% of\nGDP.\nIn thinking about what is produced in the economy, many non-economists immediately focus on solid, long-\nlasting goods, like cars and computers. By far the largest part of GDP, however, is services. Moreover, services\nhave been a growing share of GDP over time. A detailed breakdown of the leading service industries would\ninclude healthcare, education, and legal and financial services. It has been decades since most of the U.S.\neconomy involved making solid objects. Instead, the most common jobs in a modern economy involve a\nworker looking at pieces of paper or a computer screen; meeting with co-workers, customers, or suppliers; or\nmaking phone calls.\nEven within the overall category of goods, long-lasting durable goods like cars and refrigerators are about the\nsame share of the economy as short-lived nondurable goods like food and clothing. The category of structures\nincludes everything from homes, to office buildings, shopping malls, and factories. Inventories is a small\ncategory that refers to the goods that one business has produced but has not yet sold to consumers, and are\nstill sitting in warehouses and on shelves. The amount of inventories sitting on shelves tends to decline if\nbusiness is better than expected, or to rise if business is worse than expected.\nAnother Way to Measure GDP: The National Income Approach\nGDP is a measure of what is produced in a nation. The primary way GDP is estimated is with the Expenditure\nApproach we discussed above, but there is another way. Everything a firm produces, when sold, becomes\nrevenues to the firm. Businesses use revenues to pay their bills: Wages and salaries for labor, interest and\ndividends for capital, rent for land, profit to the entrepreneur, etc. So adding up all the income produced in a\nyear provides a second way of measuring GDP. This is why the terms GDP andnational incomeare sometimes\nused interchangeably. The total value of a nation\u2019s output is equal to the total value of a nation\u2019s income.\nThe Problem of Double Counting\nWe define GDP as the current value of all final goods and services produced in a nation in a year. What are final\ngoods? They are goods at the furthest stage of production at the end of a year. Statisticians who calculate GDP\nmust avoid the mistake ofdouble counting, in which they count output more than once as it travels through\nthe production stages. For example, imagine what would happen if government statisticians first counted the\nvalue of tires that a tire manufacturer produces, and then counted the value of a new truck that an automaker\nsold that contains those tires. In this example, the statisticians would have counted the value of the tires twice-\nbecause the truck's price includes the value of the tires.\nTo avoid this problem, which would overstate the size of the economy considerably, government statisticians\ncount just the value offinal goods and servicesin the chain of production that are sold for consumption,\ninvestment, government, and trade purposes. Statisticians excludeintermediate goods, which are goods that\ngo into producing other goods, from GDP calculations. From the example above, they will only count the Ford\ntruck's value. The value of what businesses provide to other businesses is captured in the final products at the\nend of the production chain.\nThe concept of GDP is fairly straightforward: it is just the dollar value of all final goods and services produced\nin the economy in a year. In our decentralized, market-oriented economy, actually calculating the more than\n$21 trillion-dollar U.S. GDP\u2014along with how it is changing every few months\u2014is a full-time job for a brigade of\ngovernment statisticians. 458 19 \u2022 The Macroeconomic Perspective\nWhat is Counted in GDP What is not included in GDP\nConsumption Intermediate goods\nBusiness investment Transfer payments and non-market activities\nGovernment spending on goods and services Used goods\nNet exports Illegal goods\nTABLE19.3Counting GDP\nNotice the items that are not counted into GDP, asTable 19.3outlines. The sales of used goods are not included\nbecause they were produced in a previous year and are part of that year\u2019s GDP. The entire underground\neconomy of services paid \u201cunder the table\u201d and illegal sales should be counted, but is not, because it is\nimpossible to track these sales. In Friedrich Schneider's recent study of shadow economies, he estimated the\nunderground economy in the United States to be 6.6% of GDP, or close to $2 trillion dollars in 2013 alone.\nTransfer payments, such as payment by the government to individuals, are not included, because they do not\nrepresent production. Also, production of some goods\u2014such as home production as when you make your\nbreakfast\u2014is not counted because these goods are not sold in the marketplace.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/undergroundecon)to read about the \u201cNew Underground Economy.\u201d\nOther Ways to Measure the Economy\nBesides GDP, there are several different but closely related ways of measuring the size of the economy. We\nmentioned above that we can think of GDP as total production and as total purchases. We can also think of it as\ntotal income since anything one produces and sells yields income.\nOne of the closest cousins of GDP is thegross national product (GNP). GDP includes only what country\nproduces within its borders. GNP adds what domestic businesses and labor abroad produces, and subtracts\nany payments that foreign labor and businesses located in the United States send home to other countries. In\nother words, GNP is based more on what a country's citizens and firms produce, wherever they are located,\nand GDP is based on what happens within a certain county's geographic boundaries. For the United States, the\ngap between GDP and GNP is relatively small; in recent years, only about 0.2%. For small nations, which may\nhave a substantial share of their population working abroad and sending money back home, the difference can\nbe substantial.\nWe calculatenet national product (NNP)by taking GNP and then subtracting the value of how much physical\ncapital is worn out, or reduced in value because of aging, over the course of a year. The process by which\ncapital ages and loses value is calleddepreciation. We can further subdivide NNP intonational income, which\nincludes all income to businesses and individuals, and personal income, which includes only income to\npeople.\nThe gross national income (GNI) includes the value of all goods and services produced by people from a\ncountry\u2014whether in the country or not. Unlike the other methods, GNI essentially measures the wealth of a\nnation because it focuses on income, not output. As you will see in the discussion regarding global economic\ndiversity, the World Bank now uses GNI to classify nations according to economic status.\nFor practical purposes, it is not vital to memorize these definitions. However, it is important to be aware that\nthese differences exist and to know what statistic you are examining, so that you do not accidentally compare,\nsay, GDP in one year or for one country with GNP or NNP in another year or another country.

The distinction is\nbetween nominal and real measurements, which refer to whether or not inflation has distorted a given\nstatistic. Looking at economic statistics without considering inflation is like looking through a pair of\nbinoculars and trying to guess how close something is: unless you know how strong the lenses are, you cannot\nguess the distance very accurately. Similarly, if you do not know the inflation rate, it is difficult to figure out if a\nrise in GDP is due mainly to a rise in the overall level of prices or to a rise in quantities of goods produced. The\nnominal valueof any economic statistic means that we measure the statistic in terms of actual prices that\nexist at the time. Thereal valuerefers to the same statistic after it has been adjusted for inflation. Generally, it\nis the real value that is more important.\nConverting Nominal to Real GDP\nTable 19.5shows U.S. GDP at five-year intervals since 1960 in nominal dollars; that is, GDP measured using\nthe actual market prices prevailing in each stated year.Figure 19.7also reflects this data in a graph.\nYear Nominal GDP (billions of dollars) GDP Deflator (2005 = 100)\n1960 542.4 16.6\n1965 742.3 17.8\n1970 1,073.3 21.7\n1975 1,684.9 29.8\n1980 2,857.3 42.2\n1985 4,339.0 54.5\n1990 5,963.1 63.6\n1995 7,639.7 71.8\n2000 10,251.0 78.0\n2005 13,039.2 87.5\n2010 15,049.0 96.2\n2015 18,206.0 10.47\n2020 20,893.7 113.6\nTABLE19.5U.S. Nominal GDP and the GDP Deflator(Source:\nhttps://apps.bea.gov/itable/index.cfm, Table 1.1.5 and Table 1.1.9)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 19.2 \u2022 Adjusting Nominal Values to Real Values 461\nFIGURE19.7U.S. Nominal GDP, 1960\u20132020Nominal GDP values have risen exponentially from 1960 through\n2020, according to the BEA.\nIf an unwary analyst compared nominal GDP in 1960 to nominal GDP in 2010, it might appear that national\noutput had risen by a factor of more than 38 over this time (that is, GDP of $20.9 trillion in 2020 divided by\nGDP of $543 billion in 1960 = 38). This conclusion would be highly misleading. Recall that we define nominal\nGDP as the quantity of every final good or service produced multiplied by the price at which it was sold,\nsummed up for all goods and services. In order to see how much production has actually increased, we need to\nextract the effects of higher prices on nominal GDP. We can easily accomplish this using the GDP deflator.\nTheGDP deflatoris a price index measuring the average prices of all final goods and services included in the\neconomy. We explore price indices in detail and how we compute them inInflation, but this definition will do\nin the context of this chapter.Table 19.5provides the GDP deflator data andFigure 19.8shows it graphically.\nFIGURE19.8U.S. GDP Deflator, 1960\u20132020Much like nominal GDP, the GDP deflator has risen exponentially from\n1960 through 2010. (Source: BEA https://apps.bea.gov/itable/index.cfm, Table 1.1.9)\nFigure 19.8shows that the price level has risen dramatically since 1960. The price level in 2020 was seven\ntimes higher than in 1960 (the deflator for 2020 was 113 versus a level of 17 in 1960). Clearly, much of the\ngrowth in nominal GDP was due to inflation, not an actual change in the quantity of goods and services\nproduced, in other words, not in real GDP. Recall that nominal GDP can rise for two reasons: an increase in\noutput, and/or an increase in prices. What is needed is to extract the increase in prices from nominal GDP so\nas to measure only changes in output. After all, the dollars used to measure nominal GDP in 1960 are worth\nmore than the inflated dollars of 2020\u2014and the price index tells exactly how much more. This adjustment is 462 19 \u2022 The Macroeconomic Perspective\neasy to do if you understand that nominal measurements are in value terms, where\nLet\u2019s look at an example at the micro level. Suppose the t-shirt company, Coolshirts, sells 10 t-shirts at a price\nof $9 each.\nThen,\nIn other words, when we compute \u201creal\u201d measurements we are trying to obtain actual quantities, in this case,\n10 t-shirts.\nWith GDP, it is just a tiny bit more complicated. We start with the same formula as above:\nFor reasons that we will explain in more detail below, mathematically, a price index is a two-digit decimal\nnumber like 1.00 or 0.85 or 1.25. Because some people have trouble working with decimals, when the price\nindex is published, it has traditionally been multiplied by 100 to get integer numbers like 100, 85, or 125. What\nthis means is that when we \u201cdeflate\u201d nominal figures to get real figures (by dividing the nominal by the price\nindex). We also need to remember to divide the published price index by 100 to make the math work. Thus, the\nformula becomes:\nNow read the following Work It Out feature for more practice calculating real GDP.\nWORK IT OUT\nComputing GDP\nIt is possible to use the data inTable 19.5to compute real GDP.\nStep 1. Look atTable 19.5, to see that, in 1960, nominal GDP was $543.3 billion and the price index (GDP\ndeflator) was 19.0.\nStep 2. To calculate the real GDP in 1960, use the formula:\nWe\u2019ll do this in two parts to make it clear. First adjust the price index: 19 divided by 100 = 0.19. Then divide into\nnominal GDP: $543.3 billion / 0.19 = $2,859.5 billion.\nStep 3.

Whenever you compute a real statistic, one year (or period) plays a\nspecial role. It is called the base year (or base period). The base year is the year whose prices we use to compute\nthe real statistic. When we calculate real GDP, for example, we take the quantities of goods and services\nproduced in each year (for example, 1960 or 1973) and multiply them by their prices in the base year (in this\ncase, 2005), so we get a measure of GDP that uses prices that do not change from year to year. That is why real\nGDP is labeled \u201cConstant Dollars\u201d or, in this example, \u201c2005 Dollars,\u201d which means that real GDP is constructed 464 19 \u2022 The Macroeconomic Perspective\nusing prices that existed in 2005. While the example here uses 2005 as the base year, more generally, you can\nuse any year as the base year. The formula is:\nRearranging the formula and using the data from 2005:\nComparing real GDP and nominal GDP for 2005, you see they are the same. This is no accident. It is because we\nhave chosen 2005 as the \u201cbase year\u201d in this example. Since the price index in the base year always has a value of\n100 (by definition), nominal and real GDP are always the same in the base year.\nLook at the data for 2010.\nUse this data to make another observation: As long as inflation is positive, meaning prices increase on average\nfrom year to year, real GDP should be less than nominal GDP in any year after the base year. The reason for this\nshould be clear: The value of nominal GDP is \u201cinflated\u201d by inflation. Similarly, as long as inflation is positive, real\nGDP should be greater than nominal GDP in any year before the base year.\nFigure 19.9shows the U.S. nominal andreal GDPsince 1960. Because 2005 is the base year, the nominal and\nreal values are exactly the same in that year. However, over time, the rise in nominal GDP looks much larger\nthan the rise in real GDP (that is, thenominal GDPline rises more steeply than the real GDP line), because the\npresence of inflation, especially in the 1970s exaggerates the rise in nominal GDP.\nFIGURE19.9U.S. Nominal and Real GDP, 1960\u20132020The red line measures U.S. GDP in nominal dollars. The black\nline measures U.S. GDP in real dollars, where all dollar values are converted to 2012 dollars. Since we express real\nGDP in 2012 dollars, the two lines cross in 2012. However, real GDP will appear higher than nominal GDP in the\nyears before 2012, because dollars were worth less in 2012 than in previous years. Conversely, real GDP will appear\nAccess for free at openstax.org 19.3 \u2022 Tracking Real GDP over Time 465\nlower in the years after 2012, because dollars were worth more in 2012 than in later years.\nLet\u2019s return to the question that we posed originally: How much did GDP increase in real terms? What was the\nreal GDP growth rate from 1960 to 2012? To find the real growth rate, we apply the formula for percentage\nchange:\nIn other words, the U.S. economy has increased real production of goods and services by nearly a factor of five\nsince 1960. Of course, that understates the material improvement since it fails to capture improvements in the\nquality of products and the invention of new products.\nThere is a quicker way to answer this question approximately, using another math trick. Because:\nTherefore, real GDP growth rate (% change in quantity) equals the growth rate in nominal GDP (% change in\nvalue) minus the inflation rate (% change in price).\nNote that using this equation provides an approximation for small changes in the levels. For more accurate\nmeasures, one should use the first formula.\n19.3Tracking Real GDP over Time\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain recessions, depressions, peaks, and troughs\n\u2022 Evaluate the importance of tracking real GDP over time\nWhen news reports indicate that \u201cthe economy grew 1.2% in the first quarter,\u201d the reports are referring to the\npercentage change in real GDP.

(Source: bea.gov) 466 19 \u2022 The Macroeconomic Perspective\nFigure 19.10shows the pattern of U.S. real GDP since 1930. Short term declines have regularly interrupted the\ngenerally upward long-term path of GDP. We call a significant decline in real GDP arecession. We call an\nespecially lengthy and deep recession adepression. The severe drop in GDP that occurred during the 1930s\nGreat Depressionis clearly visible in the figure, as is the 2008\u20132009Great Recessionand the recession\ninduced by COVID-19 in 2020.\nReal GDP is important because it is highly correlated with other measures of economic activity, like\nemployment and unemployment. When real GDP rises, so does employment.\nThe most significant human problem associated with recessions (and their larger, uglier cousins, depressions)\nis that a slowdown in production means that firms need to lay off or fire some of their workers. Losing a job\nimposes painful financial and personal costs on workers, and often on their extended families as well. In\naddition, even those who keep their jobs are likely to find that wage raises are scanty at best\u2014or their\nemployers may ask them to take pay cuts.\nTable 19.7lists the pattern of recessions and expansions in the U.S. economy since 1900. We call the highest\npoint of the economy, before the recession begins, thepeak. Conversely, the lowest point of a recession, before\na recovery begins, is thetrough. Thus, a recession lasts from peak to trough, and an economic upswing runs\nfrom trough to peak. We call the economy's movement from peak to trough and trough to peak thebusiness\ncycle. It is intriguing to notice that the three longest trough-to-peak expansions of the twentieth century have\nhappened since 1960. The most recent recession was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It started in\nFebruary 2020 and ended formally in May 2020. This was the most severe recession since the 1930s Great\nDepression, but also the shortest. The previous recession, called the Great Recession, was also very severe and\nlasted about 18 months. The expansion starting in June 2009, the trough from the Great Recession, was the\nlongest on record\u2014ending 128 months with the pandemic-induced recession.\nTrough Peak Months of Contraction Months of Expansion\nDecember 1900 September 1902 18 21\nAugust 1904 May 1907 23 33\nJune 1908 January 1910 13 19\nJanuary 1912 January 1913 24 12\nDecember 1914 August 1918 23 44\nMarch 1919 January 1920 7 10\nJuly 1921 May 1923 18 22\nJuly 1924 October 1926 14 27\nNovember 1927 August 1929 23 21\nMarch 1933 May 1937 43 50\nJune 1938 February 1945 13 80\nOctober 1945 November 1948 8 37\nOctober 1949 July 1953 11 45\nTABLE19.7U.S. Business Cycles since 1900(Source: http://www.nber.org/cycles/\nmain.html)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 19.4 \u2022 Comparing GDP among Countries 467\nTrough Peak Months of Contraction Months of Expansion\nMay 1954 August 1957 10 39\nApril 1958 April 1960 8 24\nFebruary 1961 December 1969 10 106\nNovember 1970 November 1973 11 36\nMarch 1975 January 1980 16 58\nJuly 1980 July 1981 6 12\nNovember 1982 July 1990 16 92\nMarch 1991 March 2001 8 120\nNovember 2001 December 2007 8 73\nJanuary 2009 February 2020 2 128\nApril 2020 TBD TBD TBD\nTABLE19.7U.S. Business Cycles since 1900(Source: http://www.nber.org/cycles/\nmain.html)\nA private think tank, theNational Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), tracks business cycles for the U.S.\neconomy.

When comparing\nthe GDP of different nations for this purpose, two issues immediately arise. First, we measure a country's GDP\nin its own currency: the United States uses the U.S. dollar; Canada, the Canadian dollar; most countries of\nWestern Europe, the euro; Japan, the yen; Mexico, the peso; and so on. Thus, comparing GDP between two\ncountries requires converting to a common currency. A second issue is that countries have very different\nnumbers of people. For instance, the United States has a much larger economy than Mexico or Canada, but it\nalso has almost three times as many people as Mexico and nine times as many people as Canada. Thus, if we\nare trying to compare standards of living across countries, we need to divide GDP by population.\nConverting Currencies with Exchange Rates\nTo compare the GDP of countries with different currencies, it is necessary to convert to a \u201ccommon\ndenominator\u201d using anexchange rate, which is the value of one currency in terms of another currency. We\nexpress exchange rates either as the units of country A\u2019s currency that need to be traded for a single unit of\ncountry B\u2019s currency (for example, Japanese yen per British pound), or as the inverse (for example, British\npounds per Japanese yen). We can use two types of exchange rates for this purpose, market exchange rates 468 19 \u2022 The Macroeconomic Perspective\nandpurchasing power parity (PPP)equivalent exchange rates. Market exchange rates vary on a day-to-day\nbasis depending on supply and demand in foreign exchange markets. PPP-equivalent exchange rates provide a\nlonger run measure of the exchange rate. For this reason, economists typically use PPP-equivalent exchange\nrates for GDP cross country comparisons. We will discuss exchange rates in more detail inExchange Rates and\nInternational Capital Flows. The following Work It Out feature explains how to convert GDP to a common\ncurrency.\nWORK IT OUT\nConverting GDP to a Common Currency\nUsing the exchange rate to convert GDP from one currency to another is straightforward. Say that the task is to\ncompare Brazil\u2019s GDP in 2020 of 7.4 trillion reals with the U.S. GDP of $20.9 trillion for the same year.\nStep 1. Determine the exchange rate for the specified year. In 2020, the exchange rate was 2.362 reals = $1.\n(These numbers are realistic, but rounded off to simplify the calculations.)\nStep 2. Convert Brazil\u2019s GDP into U.S. dollars:\nStep 3. Compare this value to the GDP in the United States in the same year. The U.S. GDP was $20.9 trillion in\n2020, which is almost seven times that of GDP in Brazil.\nStep 4.

The United States is also a\npopulous country; in fact, it is the third largest country by population in the world, although well behind China\nand India. Is the U.S. economy larger than other countries just because the United States has more people than\nmost other countries, or because the U.S. economy is actually larger on a per-person basis? We can answer this\nquestion by calculating a country\u2019sGDP per capita; that is, the GDP divided by the population.\nThe second column ofTable 19.9lists the GDP of the same selection of countries that appeared in the previous\nTracking Real GDP over TimeandTable 19.8, showing their GDP as converted into U.S. dollars (which is the\nsame as the last column of the previous table). The third column gives the population for each country. The\nfourth column lists the GDP per capita. We obtain GDP per capita in two steps: First, by multiplying column two\n(GDP, in billions of dollars) by 1000 so it has the same units as column three (Population, in millions). Then\ndivide the result (GDP in millions of dollars) by column three (Population, in millions).\nCountry GDP (in billions of U.S. dollars) Population (in millions) Per Capita GDP (in U.S. dollars)\nBrazil 3,153.60 212.56 14,836.27\nCanada 1,827.71 38.00 48,097.62\nChina 24,273.36 1,402.11 17,312.02\nEgypt 1,290.21 102.33 12,608.30\nGermany 4,516.94 83.24 54,263.99\nIndia 8,907.03 1,380.00 6,454.37\nJapan 5,166.00 125.84 41,052.13\nMexico 2,428.20 128.93 18,833.48\nSouth Korea 2,233.00 51.78 43,124.78\nTABLE19.9GDP Per Capita, 2020(Source: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) 470 19 \u2022 The Macroeconomic Perspective\nCountry GDP (in billions of U.S. dollars) Population (in millions) Per Capita GDP (in U.S. dollars)\nUnited Kingdom 3,019.60 67.22 44,913.08\nUnited States 20,936.60 329.48 63,544.37\nTABLE19.9GDP Per Capita, 2020(Source: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD)\nNotice that the rankings by GDP in billions of U.S. dollars, and by GDP per capita, are different than the ranking\nof GDP by each country\u2019s currency. Measured by its own currency, the rupee, India has a somewhat larger GDP\nthan Germany. On a per capita basis in U.S. dollars, Germany has more than 9 times India\u2019s per capita GDP on\nPPP terms.\nCLEAR IT UP\nIs China going to surpass the United States in terms of standard of living?\nChina has the largest GDP in PPP terms: $24 trillion compared to the United States\u2019 $21 trillion. But China has a\nmuch larger population so that in per capita terms, its GDP is less than one fourth that of the United States ($17,000\ncompared to $63,000). The Chinese people are still quite poor relative to the United States and other developed\ncountries. One caveat: For reasons we will discuss shortly, GDP per capita can give us only a rough idea of the\ndifferences in living standards across countries.\nThe world\u2019s high-income nations\u2014including the United States, Canada, the Western European countries, and\nJapan\u2014typically have GDP per capita in the range of $20,000 to $50,000. Middle-income countries, which\ninclude much of Latin America, Eastern Europe, and some countries in East Asia, have GDP per capita in the\nrange of $6,000 to $12,000. The world's low-income countries, many of them located in Africa and Asia, often\nhave GDP per capita of less than $2,000 per year.\n19.5How Well GDP Measures the Well-Being of Society\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Discuss how productivity influences the standard of living\n\u2022 Explain the limitations of GDP as a measure of the standard of living\n\u2022 Analyze the relationship between GDP data and fluctuations in the standard of living\nThe level of GDP per capita clearly captures some of what we mean by the phrase \u201cstandard of living.\u201d Most of\nthe migration in the world, for example, involves people who are moving from countries with relatively low\nGDP per capita to countries with relatively high GDP per capita.\n\u201cStandard of living\u201d is a broader term than GDP. While GDP focuses on production that is bought and sold in\nmarkets,standard of livingincludes all elements that affect people\u2019s well-being, whether they are bought and\nsold in the market or not. To illuminate the difference between GDP and standard of living, it is useful to spell\nout some things that GDP does not cover that are clearly relevant to standard of living.\nLimitations of GDP as a Measure of the Standard of Living\nGDP measures economic activity, not all activity. As a result, economists like Kate Raworth see it as a\nsomewhat outdated and limited indication of well-being and prosperity. While GDP measures output of work\ndone at home, as well as spending on travel, it doesn't capture unpaid work or leisure time. So, two countries\nmay have equal GDP, but one nation's workers may have an average workday of eight hours, while the other has\nan average workday of twelve hours. In that case, is their equal GDP truly measuring the prosperity of those\nAccess for free at openstax.org 19.5 \u2022 How Well GDP Measures the Well-Being of Society 471\nnations? The GDP per capita of the U.S. economy is larger than the GDP per capita of Germany, asTable 19.9\nshowed, but does that prove that the standard of living in the United States is higher? Not necessarily, since it\nis also true that the average U.S. worker works several hundred hours more per year more than the average\nGerman worker. Calculating GDP does not account for the German worker\u2019s extra vacation weeks.\nWhile GDP includes what a country spends on environmental protection, healthcare, and education, it does\nnot include actual levels of environmental cleanliness, health, and learning. GDP includes the cost of buying\npollution-control equipment, but it does not address whether the air and water are actually cleaner or dirtier.\nGDP includes spending on medical care, but does not address whether life expectancy or infant mortality have\nrisen or fallen. Similarly, it counts spending on education, but does not address directly how much of the\npopulation can read, write, or do basic mathematics.\nGDP includes production that is exchanged in the market, but it does not cover production that is not\nexchanged in the market. For example, hiring someone to mow your lawn or clean your house is part of GDP,\nbut doing these tasks yourself is not part of GDP. One remarkable change in the U.S. economy in recent\ndecades is the growth in women\u2019s participation in the labor force. As of 1970, only about 42% of women\nparticipated in the paid labor force. By the second decade of the 2000s, nearly 60% of women participated in\nthe paid labor force according to theBureau of Labor Statistics. As women are now in the labor force, many of\nthe services they used to produce in the non-market economy like food preparation and child care have shifted\nto some extent into the market economy, which makes the GDP appear larger even if people actually are not\nconsuming more services. However, as Raworth points out and was explored in the chapter on the labor\nmarket, even women who are fully employed expend significant effort (generally more than men) in raising\nchildren and maintaining a home. Raworth advocates that economic measures include monetized and un-\nmonetized goods and services, so that the status and contributors to each economy are more accurate.\nGDP has nothing to say about the level of inequality in society.GDP per capitais only an average. When GDP\nper capita rises by 5%, it could mean that GDP for everyone in the society has risen by 5%, or that GDP of some\ngroups has risen by more while that of others has risen by less\u2014or even declined. GDP also has nothing in\nparticular to say about the amount of variety available. If a family buys 100 loaves of bread in a year, GDP does\nnot care whether they are all white bread, or whether the family can choose from wheat, rye, pumpernickel,\nand many others\u2014it just looks at the total amount the family spends on bread.\nLikewise, GDP has nothing much to say about what technology and products are available. The standard of\nliving in, for example, 1950 or 1900 was not affected only by how much money people had\u2014it was also affected\nby what they could buy. No matter how much money you had in 1950, you could not buy an iPhone or a\npersonal computer.\nIn certain cases, it is not clear that a rise in GDP is even a good thing. If a city is wrecked by a hurricane, and\nthen experiences a surge of rebuilding construction activity, it would be peculiar to claim that the hurricane\nwas therefore economically beneficial. If people are led by a rising fear of crime, to pay for installing bars and\nburglar alarms on all their windows, it is hard to believe that this increase in GDP has made them better off.\nSimilarly, some people would argue that sales of certain goods, like pornography or extremely violent movies,\ndo not represent a gain to society\u2019s standard of living.\nDoes a Rise in GDP Overstate or Understate the Rise in the Standard of Living?\nThe fact that GDP per capita does not fully capture the broader idea of standard of living has led to a concern\nthat the increases in GDP over time are illusory. It is theoretically possible that while GDP is rising, the\nstandard of living could be falling if human health, environmental cleanliness, and other factors that are not\nincluded in GDP are worsening. Fortunately, this fear appears to be overstated.\nIn some ways, the rise in GDP understates the actual rise in the standard of living. For example, the typical\nworkweek for a U.S. worker has fallen over the last century from about 60 hours per week to less than 40 hours\nper week. Life expectancy and health have risen dramatically, and so has the average level of education. Since 472 19 \u2022 The Macroeconomic Perspective\n1970, the air and water in the United States have generally been getting cleaner. Companies have developed\nnew technologies for entertainment, travel, information, and health. A much wider variety of basic products\nlike food and clothing is available today than several decades ago. Because GDP does not capture leisure,\nhealth, a cleaner environment, the possibilities that new technology creates, or an increase in variety, the\nactual rise in the standard of living for Americans in recent decades has exceeded the rise in GDP.\nOn the other side, crime rates, traffic congestion levels, and income inequality are higher in the United States\nnow than they were in the 1960s. Moreover, a substantial number of services that women primarily provided in\nthe non-market economy are now part of the market economy that GDP counts. By ignoring these factors, GDP\nwould tend to overstate the true rise in the standard of living.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/amdreamvalue)to read about the American Dream and standards of\nliving.\nGDP is Rough, but Useful\nA high level of GDP should not be the only goal of macroeconomic policy, or government policy more broadly.\nEven though GDP does not measure the broader standard of living with any precision, it does measure\nproduction well and it does indicate when a country is materially better or worse off in terms of jobs and\nincomes. In most countries, a significantly higher GDP per capita occurs hand in hand with other\nimprovements in everyday life along many dimensions, like education, health, and environmental protection.\nNo single number can capture all the elements of a term as broad as \u201cstandard of living.\u201d Nonetheless, GDP per\ncapita is a reasonable, rough-and-ready measure of the standard of living.\nBRING IT HOME\nHow is the Economy Doing? How Does One Tell?\nTo determine the state of the economy, one needs to examine economic indicators, such as GDP. To calculate GDP is\nquite an undertaking. It is the broadest measure of a nation\u2019s economic activity and we owe a debt to Simon\nKuznets, the creator of the measurement, for that.\nThe sheer size of the U.S. economy as measured by nominal GDP is huge\u2014as of the third quarter of 2021, $23.2\ntrillion worth of goods and services were produced annually. During the COVID-19-induced recession, which lasted\njust two months according to NBER and was concentrated across Quarters 1 and 2 of 2020, real GDP dropped\n9%\u2014much larger and quicker of a drop than during the previous economic downturn, the Great Recession\n(2007\u20132009). The economy quickly bounced back, and as of Quarter 1 of 2021, real GDP had slightly surpassed the\nlevel it was at prior to the start of the pandemic. These statistics show the severity of the pandemic-induced\nrecession, and while real GDP fully recovered, there are other ways in which the economy has not. While GDP and\nGDP per capita give us a rough estimate of a nation's standard of living, there are many other ways to track the\nhealth of the economy. This chapter is the building block for other chapters that explore more economic indicators\nsuch as unemployment, inflation, or interest rates, and perhaps more importantly, will explain how they are related\nand what causes them to rise or fall.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 19 \u2022 Key Terms 473\nKey Terms\nbusiness cycle the economy's relatively short-term movement in and out of recession\ndepreciation the process by which capital ages over time and therefore loses its value\ndepression an especially lengthy and deep decline in output\ndouble counting a potential mistake to avoid in measuring GDP, in which output is counted more than once as\nit travels through the stages of production\ndurable good long-lasting good like a car or a refrigerator\nexchange rate the price of one currency in terms of another currency\nfinal good and service output used directly for consumption, investment, government, and trade purposes;\ncontrast with \u201cintermediate good\u201d\nGDP per capita GDP divided by the population\ngross domestic product (GDP) the value of the output of all final goods and services produced within a\ncountry in a year\ngross national product (GNP) includes what is produced domestically and what is produced by domestic\nlabor and business abroad in a year\nintermediate good output provided to other businesses at an intermediate stage of production, not for final\nusers; contrast with \u201cfinal good and service\u201d\ninventory good that has been produced, but not yet been sold\nnational income includes all income earned: wages, profits, rent, and profit income\nnet national product (NNP) GNP minus depreciation\nnominal value the economic statistic actually announced at that time, not adjusted for inflation; contrast with\nreal value\nnondurable good short-lived good like food and clothing\npeak during the business cycle, the highest point of output before a recession begins\nreal value an economic statistic after it has been adjusted for inflation; contrast with nominal value\nrecession a significant decline in national output\nservice product which is intangible (in contrast to goods) such as entertainment, healthcare, or education\nstandard of living all elements that affect people\u2019s happiness, whether people buy or sell these elements in\nthe market or not\nstructure building used as residence, factory, office building, retail store, or for other purposes\ntrade balance gap between exports and imports\ntrade deficit exists when a nation's imports exceed its exports and it calculates them as imports \u2013exports\ntrade surplus exists when a nation's exports exceed its imports and it calculates them as exports \u2013 imports\ntrough during the business cycle, the lowest point of output in a recession, before a recovery begins\nKey Concepts and Summary\n19.1Measuring the Size of the Economy: Gross Domestic Product\nEconomists generally express the size of a nation\u2019s economy as its gross domestic product (GDP), which\nmeasures the value of the output of all goods and services produced within the country in a year. Economists\nmeasure GDP by taking the quantities of all goods and services produced, multiplying them by their prices,\nand summing the total. Since GDP measures what is bought and sold in the economy, we can measure it either\nby the sum of what is purchased in the economy or what is produced.\nWe can divide demand into consumption, investment, government, exports, and imports. We can divide what\nis produced in the economy into durable goods, nondurable goods, services, structures, and inventories. To\navoid double counting, GDP counts only final output of goods and services, not the production of intermediate\ngoods or the value of labor in the chain of production. 474 19 \u2022 Self-Check Questions\n19.2Adjusting Nominal Values to Real Values\nThe nominal value of an economic statistic is the commonly announced value. The real value is the value after\nadjusting for changes in inflation. To convert nominal economic data from several different years into real,\ninflation-adjusted data, the starting point is to choose a base year arbitrarily and then use a price index to\nconvert the measurements so that economists measure them in the money prevailing in the base year.\n19.3Tracking Real GDP over Time\nOver the long term, U.S. real GDP have increased dramatically. At the same time, GDP has not increased the\nsame amount each year. The speeding up and slowing down of GDP growth represents the business cycle.\nWhen GDP declines significantly, a recession occurs. A longer and deeper decline is a depression. Recessions\nbegin at the business cycle's peak and end at the trough.\n19.4Comparing GDP among Countries\nSince we measure GDP in a country\u2019s currency, in order to compare different countries\u2019 GDPs, we need to\nconvert them to a common currency. One way to do that is with the exchange rate, which is the price of one\ncountry\u2019s currency in terms of another. Once we express GDPs in a common currency, we can compare each\ncountry\u2019s GDP per capita by dividing GDP by population. Countries with large populations often have large\nGDPs, but GDP alone can be a misleading indicator of a nation's wealth. A better measure is GDP per capita.\n19.5How Well GDP Measures the Well-Being of Society\nGDP is an indicator of a society\u2019s standard of living, but it is only a rough indicator. GDP does not directly take\naccount of leisure, environmental quality, levels of health and education, activities conducted outside the\nmarket, changes in inequality of income, increases in variety, increases in technology, or the (positive or\nnegative) value that society may place on certain types of output.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

Cross country comparisons of GDP per capita typically use purchasing power parity equivalent exchange\nrates, which are a measure of the long run equilibrium value of an exchange rate. In fact, we used PPP\nequivalent exchange rates in this module. Why could using market exchange rates, which sometimes\nchange dramatically in a short period of time, be misleading?\n26.

The\neconomist Brad DeLong estimates that the average worker in the early 1600s earned wages that could afford him\n2,500 food calories. This worker lived in Western Europe. Two hundred years later, that same worker could afford\n3,000 food calories. However, between 1800 and 1875, just a time span of just 75 years, economic growth was so\nrapid that western European workers could purchase 5,000 food calories a day. By 2012, a low skilled worker in an\naffluent Western European/North American country could afford to purchase 2.4 million food calories per day.\nWhat caused such a rapid rise in living standards between 1800 and 1875 and thereafter? Why is it that many\ncountries, especially those in Western Europe, North America, and parts of East Asia, can feed their populations\nmore than adequately, while others cannot? We will look at these and other questions as we examine long-run\neconomic growth. 478 20 \u2022 Economic Growth\nEvery country worries about economic growth. In the United States and other high-income countries, the\nquestion is whether economic growth continues to provide the same remarkable gains in our standard of living\nas it did during the twentieth century. Meanwhile, can middle-income countries like Brazil, Egypt, or Poland\ncatch up to the higher-income countries, or must they remain in the second tier of per capita income? Of the\nworld\u2019s population of roughly 7.5 billion people, about 1.1 billion are scraping by on incomes that average less\nthan $2 per day, not that different from the standard of living 2,000 years ago. Can the world\u2019s poor be lifted\nfrom their fearful poverty? As the 1995 Nobel laureate in economics, Robert E. Lucas Jr., once noted: \u201cThe\nconsequences for human welfare involved in questions like these are simply staggering: Once one starts to\nthink about them, it is hard to think about anything else.\u201d\nDramatic improvements in a nation\u2019s standard of living are possible. After the Korean War in the late 1950s,\nthe Republic of Korea, often called South Korea, was one of the poorest economies in the world. Most South\nKoreans worked in peasant agriculture. According to the British economist Angus Maddison, who devoted life\u2019s\nwork to measuring GDP and population in the world economy, GDP per capita in 1990 international dollars\nwas $854 per year. From the 1960s to the early twenty-first century, a time period well within the lifetime and\nmemory of many adults, the South Korean economy grew rapidly. Over these four decades, GDP per capita\nincreased by more than 6% per year. According to the World Bank, GDP for South Korea now exceeds $30,000\nin nominal terms, placing it firmly among high-income countries like Italy, New Zealand, and Israel. Measured\nby total GDP in 2015, South Korea is the eleventh-largest economy in the world. For a nation of 50 million\npeople, this transformation is extraordinary.\nSouth Korea is a standout example, but it is not the only case of rapid and sustained economic growth. Other\nEast Asian nations, like Thailand and Indonesia, have seen very rapid growth as well. China has grown\nenormously since it enacted market-oriented economic reforms around 1980. GDP per capita in high-income\neconomies like the United States also has grown dramatically albeit over a longer time frame. Since the Civil\nWar, the U.S. economy has transformed from a primarily rural and agricultural economy to an economy based\non services, manufacturing, and technology.\n20.1The Relatively Recent Arrival of Economic Growth\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain the conditions that have allowed for modern economic growth in the last two centuries\n\u2022 Analyze the influence of public policies on an economy's long-run economic growth\nLet\u2019s begin with a brief overview of spectacular economic growth patterns around the world in the last two\ncenturies. We commonly refer to this as the period ofmodern economic growth. (Later in the chapter we will\ndiscuss lower economic growth rates and some key ingredients for economic progress.) Rapid and sustained\neconomic growth is a relatively recent experience for the human race. Before the last two centuries, although\nrulers, nobles, and conquerors could afford some extravagances and although economies rose above the\nsubsistence level, the average person\u2019s standard of living had not changed much for centuries.\nProgressive, powerful economic and institutional changes started to have a significant effect in the late\neighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. According to the Dutch economic historianJan Luiten van Zanden,\nslavery-based societies, favorable demographics, global trading routes, and standardized trading institutions\nthat spread with different empires set the stage for the Industrial Revolution to succeed. TheIndustrial\nRevolutionrefers to the widespread use of power-driven machinery and the economic and social changes that\nresulted in the first half of the 1800s. Ingenious machines\u2014the steam engine, the power loom, and the steam\nlocomotive\u2014performed tasks that otherwise would have taken vast numbers of workers to do. The Industrial\nRevolution began in Great Britain, and soon spread to the United States, Germany, and other countries.\nThe jobs for ordinary people working with these machines were often dirty and dangerous by modern\nstandards, but the alternative jobs of that time in peasant agriculture and small-village industry were often\nAccess for free at openstax.org 20.1 \u2022 The Relatively Recent Arrival of Economic Growth 479\ndirty and dangerous, too. The new jobs of the Industrial Revolution typically offered higher pay and a chance\nfor social mobility. A self-reinforcing cycle began: New inventions and investments generated profits, the\nprofits provided funds for more new investment and inventions, and the investments and inventions provided\nopportunities for further profits. Slowly, a group of national economies in Europe and North America emerged\nfrom centuries of sluggishness into a period of rapid modern growth. During the last two centuries, the average\nGDP growth rate per capita in the leading industrialized countries has been about 2% per year. What were\ntimes like before then? Read the following Clear It Up feature for the answer.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat were economic conditions like before 1870?\nAngus Maddison, a quantitative economic historian, led the most systematic inquiry into national incomes before\n1870. Economists recently have refined and used his methods to compile GDP per capita estimates from year 1 C.E.\nto 1348.Table 20.1is an important counterpoint to most of the narrative in this chapter. It shows that nations can\ndecline as well as rise. A wide array of forces, such as epidemics, natural and weather-related disasters, the inability\nto govern large empires, and the remarkably slow pace of technological and institutional progress explain declines in\nincome. Institutions are the traditions and laws by which people in a community agree to behave and govern\nthemselves. Such institutions include marriage, religion, education, and laws of governance. Institutional progress is\nthe development and codification of these institutions to reinforce social order, and thus, economic growth.\nOne example of such an institution is the Magna Carta (Great Charter), which the English nobles forced King John to\nsign in 1215. The Magna Carta codified the principles of due process, whereby a free man could not be penalized\nunless his peers had made a lawful judgment against him. The United States in its own constitution later adopted\nthis concept. This social order may have contributed to England\u2019s GDP per capita in 1348, which was second to that\nof northern Italy.\nIn studying economic growth, a country\u2019s institutional framework plays a critical role.Table 20.1also shows relative\nglobal equality for almost 1,300 years. After this, we begin to see significant divergence in income (not in the table).\nYear Northern Italy Spain England Holland Byzantium Iraq Egypt Japan\n1 $800 $600 $600 $600 $700 $700 $700 -\n730 - - - - - $920 $730 $402\n1000 - - - - $600 $820 $600 -\n1150 - - - - $580 $680 $660 $520\n1280 - - - - - - $670 $527\n1300 $1,588 $864 $892 - - - $610 -\n1348 $1,486 $907 $919 - - - - -\nTABLE20.1GDP Per Capita Estimates in Current International Dollars from AD 1 to 1348\n(Source: Bolt and van Zanden. \u201cThe First Update of the Maddison Project. Re-Estimating\nGrowth Before 1820.\u201d 2013)\nAnother fascinating and underreported fact is the high levels of income, compared to others at that time, attained by\nthe Islamic Empire Abbasid Caliphate\u2014which was founded in present-day Iraq in 730 C.E. At its height, the empire\nspanned large regions of the Middle East, North Africa, and Spain until its gradual decline over 200 years. 480 20 \u2022 Economic Growth\nThe Industrial Revolution led to increasing inequality among nations. Some economies took off, whereas\nothers, like many of those in Africa or Asia, remained close to a subsistence standard of living. General\ncalculations show that the 17 countries of the world with the most-developed economies had, on average, 2.4\ntimes the GDP per capita of the world\u2019s poorest economies in 1870. By 1960, the most developed economies\nhad 4.2 times the GDP per capita of the poorest economies.\nHowever, by the middle of the twentieth century, some countries had shown that catching up was possible.\nJapan\u2019s economic growth took off in the 1960s and 1970s, with a growth rate of real GDP per capita averaging\n11% per year during those decades. Certain countries in Latin America experienced a boom in economic\ngrowth in the 1960s as well. In Brazil, for example, GDP per capita expanded by an average annual rate of\n11.1% from 1968 to 1973. In the 1970s, some East Asian economies, including South Korea, Thailand, and\nTaiwan, saw rapid growth. In these countries, growth rates of 11% to 12% per year in GDP per capita were not\nuncommon. More recently, China, with its population of nearly 1.4 billion people, grew at a per capita rate 9%\nper year from 1984 into the 2000s and still average high rates of growth (more than 5% today). India, with a\npopulation of 1.4 billion, has shown promising signs of economic growth, with growth in GDP per capita of\nabout 4% per year during the 1990s and climbing toward 7% to 8% per year in the 2000s and 2010s.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/asiadevbank)to read about the Asian Development Bank.\nThese waves of catch-up economic growth have not reached all shores. In certain African countries like Niger,\nTanzania, and Sudan, for example, GDP per capita at the start of the 2000s was still less than $300, not much\nhigher than it was in the nineteenth century and for centuries before that. In the context of the overall situation\nof low-income people around the world, the good economic news from China (population: 1.4 billion) and India\n(population: 1.3 billion) is, nonetheless, astounding and heartening.\nEconomic growth in the last two centuries has made a striking change in the human condition.Richard\nEasterlin, an economist at the University of Southern California, wrote in 2000:\nBy many measures, a revolution in the human condition is sweeping the world. Most people today are\nbetter fed, clothed, and housed than their predecessors two centuries ago. They are healthier, live\nlonger, and are better educated. Women\u2019s lives are less centered on reproduction and political\ndemocracy has gained a foothold. Although Western Europe and its offshoots have been the leaders of\nthis advance, most of the less developed nations have joined in during the 20th century, with the\nnewly emerging nations of sub-Saharan Africa the latest to participate. Although the picture is not one\nof universal progress, it is the greatest advance in the human condition of the world\u2019s population ever\nachieved in such a brief span of time.\nRule of Law and Economic Growth\nEconomic growth depends on many factors. Key among those factors is adherence to therule of lawand\nprotection ofproperty rightsandcontractual rightsby a country\u2019s government so that markets can work\neffectively and efficiently. Laws must be clear, public, fair, enforced, and equally applicable to all members of\nsociety. Property rights, as you might recall fromEnvironmental Protection and Negative Externalitiesare the\nrights of individuals and firms to own property and use it as they see fit. If you have $100, you have the right to\nuse that money, whether you spend it, lend it, or keep it in a jar. It is your property. The definition of property\nincludes physical property as well as the right to your training and experience, especially since your training is\nwhat determines your livelihood. Using this property includes the right to enter into contracts with other\nparties with your property. Individuals or firms must own the property to enter into a contract.\nContractual rights, then, are based on property rights and they allow individuals to enter into agreements with\nothers regarding the use of their property providing recourse through the legal system in the event of\nAccess for free at openstax.org 20.2 \u2022 Labor Productivity and Economic Growth 481\nnoncompliance. One example is the employment agreement: a skilled surgeon operates on an ill person and\nexpects payment. Failure to pay would constitute property theft by the patient. The theft is property the\nservices that the surgeon provided. In a society with strong property rights and contractual rights, the terms of\nthe patient\u2013surgeon contract will be fulfilled, because the surgeon would have recourse through the court\nsystem to extract payment from that individual. Without a legal system that enforces contracts, people would\nnot be likely to enter into contracts for current or future services because of the risk of non-payment. This\nwould make it difficult to transact business and would slow economic growth.\nThe World Bank considers a country\u2019s legal system effective if it upholds property rights and contractual\nrights. The World Bank has developed a ranking system for countries\u2019 legal systems based on effective\nprotection of property rights and rule-based governance using a scale from 1 to 6, with 1 being the lowest and\n6 the highest rating. In 2020, the world average ranking was 2.9. The three countries with the lowest ranking of\n1.0 were Somalia and Eritrea, with South Sudan at 1.5. Their GDP per capita was $875, $1,625, and $1,234.70\nrespectively. The World Bank also cites Afghanistan (GDP per capita $2,087.60) as having a low standard of\nliving, weak government structure, and lack of adherence to the rule of law, which has stymied its economic\ngrowth. The landlocked Central African Republic (GDP per capita $979.60) has poor economic resources as\nwell as political instability and is a source of children used in human trafficking. Zimbabwe (GDP per capita\n$2,895.40) has had declining and often negative growth for much of the period since 1998. Land redistribution\nand price controls have disrupted the economy, and corruption and violence have dominated the political\nprocess. Although global economic growth has increased, those countries lacking a clear system of property\nrights and an independent court system free from corruption have lagged far behind.\n20.2Labor Productivity and Economic Growth\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Identify the role of labor productivity in promoting economic growth\n\u2022 Analyze the sources of economic growth using the aggregate production function\n\u2022 Measure an economy\u2019s rate of productivity growth\n\u2022 Evaluate the power of sustained growth\nSustained long-term economic growth comes from increases in worker productivity, which essentially means\nhow well we do things. In other words, how efficient is your nation with its time and workers?Labor\nproductivityis the value that each employed person creates per unit of their input. The easiest way to\ncomprehend labor productivity is to imagine a Canadian worker who can make 10 loaves of bread in an hour\nversus a U.S. worker who in the same hour can make only two loaves of bread. In this fictional example, the\nCanadians are more productive. More productivity essentially means you can do more in the same amount of\ntime. This in turn frees up resources for workers to use elsewhere.\nWhat determines how productive workers are? The answer is pretty intuitive. The first determinant of labor\nproductivity is human capital.Human capitalis the accumulated knowledge (from education and experience),\nskills, and expertise that the average worker in an economy possesses. Typically the higher the average level of\neducation in an economy, the higher the accumulated human capital and the higher the labor productivity.\nThe second factor that determines labor productivity is technological change.Technological changeis a\ncombination ofinvention\u2014advances in knowledge\u2014andinnovation, which is putting those advances to use in\na new product or service. For example, the transistor was invented in 1947. It allowed us to miniaturize the\nfootprint of electronic devices and use less power than the tube technology that came before it. Innovations\nsince then have produced smaller and better transistors that are ubiquitous in products as varied as smart-\nphones, computers, and escalators. Developing the transistor has allowed workers to be anywhere with smaller\ndevices. People can use these devices to communicate with other workers, measure product quality or do any\nother task in less time, improving worker productivity. 482 20 \u2022 Economic Growth\nThe third factor that determines labor productivity is economies of scale. Recall that economies of scale are the\ncost advantages that industries obtain due to size. (Read more about economies of scale inProduction, Cost\nand Industry Structure.) Consider again the case of the fictional Canadian worker who could produce 10 loaves\nof bread in an hour. If this difference in productivity was due only to economies of scale, it could be that the\nCanadian worker had access to a large industrial-size oven while the U.S. worker was using a standard\nresidential size oven.\nNow that we have explored the determinants of worker productivity, let\u2019s turn to how economists measure\neconomic growth and productivity.\nSources of Economic Growth: The Aggregate Production Function\nTo analyze the sources of economic growth, it is useful to think about aproduction function, which is the\ntechnical relationship by which economic inputs like labor, machinery, and raw materials are turned into\noutputs like goods and services that consumers use. A microeconomic production function describes a firm's\nor perhaps an industry's inputs and outputs. In macroeconomics, we call the connection from inputs to\noutputs for the entire economy anaggregate production function.\nComponents of the Aggregate Production Function\nEconomists construct different production functions depending on the focus of their studies.Figure 20.2\npresents two examples of aggregate production functions. In the first production function inFigure 20.2(a),\nthe output is GDP. The inputs in this example are workforce, human capital, physical capital, and technology.\nWe discuss these inputs further in the module, Components of Economic Growth.\nFIGURE20.2Aggregate Production FunctionsAn aggregate production function shows what goes into producing\nAccess for free at openstax.org 20.2 \u2022 Labor Productivity and Economic Growth 483\nthe output for an overall economy. (a) This aggregate production function has GDP as its output. (b) This aggregate\nproduction function has GDP per capita as its output. Because we calculate it on a per-person basis, we already\nfigure the labor input into the other factors and we do not need to list it separately.\nMeasuring Productivity\nAn economy\u2019s rate of productivity growth is closely linked to the growth rate of its GDP per capita, although the\ntwo are not identical. For example, if the percentage of the population who holds jobs in an economy increases,\nGDP per capita will increase but the productivity of individual workers may not be affected. Over the long term,\nthe only way that GDP per capita can grow continually is if the productivity of the average worker rises or if\nthere are complementary increases in capital.\nA common measure of U.S. productivity per worker is dollar value per hour the worker contributes to the\nemployer\u2019s output. This measure excludes government workers, because their output is not sold in the market\nand so their productivity is hard to measure. It also excludes farming, which accounts for only a relatively\nsmall share of the U.S. economy.Figure 20.3shows an index of output per hour, with 2012 as the base year\n(when the index equals 100). The index equaled 110.5 in 2020. In 1977, the index equaled about 50, which\nshows that workers have more than doubled their productivity since then.\nFIGURE20.3Output per Hour Worked in the U.S. Economy, 1947\u20132020Output per hour worked is a measure of\nworker productivity. In the U.S. economy, worker productivity rose more quickly in the 1960s and the mid-1990s\ncompared with the 1970s and 1980s. However, these growth-rate differences are only a few percentage points per\nyear. Look carefully to see them in the changing slope of the line. The average U.S. worker produced over twice as\nmuch per hour in 2020 than they did in the 1970s.

The graphed data moves up and down across a zero line indicating change year over year. In 1970, 1974,\n1981, 1983, 2008, and 2020, the rate was quite low, as the U.S. was undergoing recessions.\nAccording to the Department of Labor, U.S. productivity growth was fairly strong in the 1950s but then\ndeclined in the 1970s and 1980s before rising again in the second half of the 1990s and the first half of the\n2000s. In fact, the rate of productivity measured by the change in output per hour worked averaged 2.8% per 484 20 \u2022 Economic Growth\nyear from 1947 to 1973; dropped to 1.2% per year from 1973 to 1979; increased to 1.5% per year from 1979 to\n1990; increased again to 2.2% from 1990 to 2000; increased even more to 2.7% from 2000 to 2007; and then\ndecreased to 1.4% from 2007 to 2020Figure 20.4shows average annual rates of productivity growth averaged\nover time since 1947.\nFIGURE20.4Productivity Growth Since 1947U.S. growth in worker productivity was very high between 1947 and\n1973. It then declined to lower levels in the later 1970s and the 1980s. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw\nproductivity rebound, but then productivity sagged a bit between 2001 and 2020. Some think the productivity\nrebound of the late 1990s and early 2000s marks the start of a \u201cnew economy\u201d built on higher productivity growth,\nbut we cannot determine this until more time has passed. (Source: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor\nStatistics.)\nThe \u201cNew Economy\u201d Controversy\nIn recent years a controversy has been brewing among economists about the resurgence of U.S. productivity in\nthe second half of the 1990s. One school of thought argues that the United States had developed a \u201cnew\neconomy\u201d based on the extraordinary advances in communications and information technology of the 1990s.\nThe most optimistic proponents argue that it would generate higher average productivity growth for decades to\ncome. The pessimists, alternatively, argue that even five or ten years of stronger productivity growth does not\nprove that higher productivity will last for the long term. It is hard to infer anything about long-term\nproductivity trends during the later part of the 2000s, because the steep 2008-2009 recession, with its sharp\nbut not completely synchronized declines in output and employment, complicates any interpretation. While\nproductivity growth was high in 2009 and 2010 (around 3%), it has slowed down over the last decade.\nProductivity growthis also closely linked to the average level of wages. Over time, the amount that firms are\nwilling to pay workers will depend on the value of the output those workers produce. If a few employers tried to\npay their workers less than what those workers produced, then those workers would receive offers of higher\nwages from other profit-seeking employers. If a few employers mistakenly paid their workers more than what\nthose workers produced, those employers would soon end up with losses. In the long run, productivity per\nhour is the most important determinant of the average wage level in any economy.

Compare real GDP growth for both countries.Table 20.2provides an example of a comparison between\nAustralia and Belgium.\nAustralia 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015\nReal GDP/Capita Growth (%) 2.3% 1.5% 1.3% 1.4 0.1%\nReal GDP Growth/Hours Worked (%) 1.7% \u22120.1% 1.4% 2.2% \u22120.2%\nBelgium 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015\nReal GDP/Capita Growth (%) 0.9 \u22120.6 \u22120.5 1.2 1.0\nReal GDP Growth/Hours Worked (%) \u22120.5 \u22120.3 0.4 1.4 0.9\nTABLE20.2\nStep 5. For both measures, growth in Australia is greater than growth in Belgium for the first four years. In\naddition, there are year-to-year fluctuations. Many factors can affect growth. For example, one factor that may\nhave contributed to Australia's stronger growth may be its larger inflows of immigrants, who generally contribute\nto economic growth.\nThe Power of Sustained Economic Growth\nNothing is more important for people\u2019s standard of living than sustained economic growth. Even small\nchanges in the rate of growth, when sustained and compounded over long periods of time, make an enormous\ndifference in the standard of living. ConsiderTable 20.3, in which the rows of the table show several different\nrates of growth in GDP per capita and the columns show different periods of time. Assume for simplicity that\nan economy starts with a GDP per capita of 100. The table then applies the following formula to calculate what\nGDP will be at the given growth rate in the future:\nFor example, an economy that starts with a GDP of 100 and grows at 3% per year will reach a GDP of 209 after\n25 years; that is, 100 (1.03)25= 209.\nThe slowest rate of GDP per capita growth in the table, just 1% per year, is similar to what the United States 486 20 \u2022 Economic Growth\nexperienced during its weakest years of productivity growth. The second highest rate, 3% per year, is close to\nwhat the U.S. economy experienced during the strong economy of the late 1990s and into the 2000s. Higher\nrates of per capita growth, such as 5% or 8% per year, represent the experience of rapid growth in economies\nlike Japan, Korea, and China.\nTable 20.3shows that even a few percentage points of difference in economic growth rates will have a\nprofound effect if sustained and compounded over time. For example, an economy growing at a 1% annual rate\nover 50 years will see its GDP per capita rise by a total of 64%, from 100 to 164 in this example. However, a\ncountry growing at a 5% annual rate will see (almost) the same amount of growth\u2014from 100 to 163\u2014over just\n10 years. Rapid rates of economic growth can bring profound transformation. (See the following Clear It Up\nfeature on the relationship between compound growth rates and compound interest rates.) If the rate of growth\nis 8%, young adults starting at age 20 will see the average standard of living in their country more than double\nby the time they reach age 30, and grow more than sixfold by the time they reach age 45.\nGrowth Value of an original 100 in 10 Value of an original 100 in 25 Value of an original 100 in 50\nRate Years Years Years\n1% 110 128 164\n3% 134 209 438\n5% 163 339 1,147\n8% 216 685 4,690\nTABLE20.3Growth of GDP over Different Time Horizons\nCLEAR IT UP\nHow are compound growth rates and compound interest rates related?\nThe formula for GDP growth rates over different periods of time, asFigure 20.3shows, is exactly the same as the\nformula for how a given amount of financial savings grows at a certain interest rate over time, as presented inChoice\nin a World of Scarcity. Both formulas have the same ingredients:\n\u2022 an original starting amount, in one case GDP and in the other case an amount of financial saving;\n\u2022 a percentage increase over time, in one case the GDP growth rate and in the other case an interest rate;\n\u2022 and an amount of time over which this effect happens.\nRecall that compound interest is interest that is earned on past interest. It causes the total amount of financial\nsavings to grow dramatically over time. Similarly, compound rates of economic growth, or thecompound growth\nrate, means that we multiply the rate of growth by a base that includes past GDP growth, with dramatic effects over\ntime.\nFor example, in 2020, the Central Intelligence Agency's World Fact Book reported that South Korea had a GDP of\n$2.2 trillion. With a growth rate of 2.8% per year, South Korea's GDP will be $2.5 trillion in five years. If we apply the\ngrowth rate to each year\u2019s ending GDP for the next five years, we will calculate that at the end of year one, GDP is\n$2.3 trillion. In year two, we start with the end-of-year one value of $1.72 and increase it by 2.8%. Year three starts\nwith the end-of-year two GDP, and we increase it by 2.8% and so on, asTable 20.4depicts.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 20.3 \u2022 Components of Economic Growth 487\nYear Starting GDP Growth Rate 2.8% Year-End Amount\n1 $2.2 Trillion \u00d7 (1+0.028) $2.3 Trillion\n2 $2.3 Trillion \u00d7 (1+0.028) $2.3 Trillion\n3 $2.3 Trillion \u00d7 (1+0.028) $2.4 Trillion\n4 $2.4 Trillion \u00d7 (1+0.028) $2.5 Trillion\n5 $2.5 Trillion \u00d7 (1+0.028) $2.5 Trillion\nTABLE20.4\nAnother way to calculate the growth rate is to apply the following formula:\nWhere \u201cfuture value\u201d is the value of GDP five years hence, \u201cpresent value\u201d is the starting GDP amount of $1.67\ntrillion, \u201cg\u201d is the growth rate of 2.8%, and \u201cn\u201d is the number of periods for which we are calculating growth.\n20.3Components of Economic Growth\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Discuss the components of economic growth, including physical capital, human capital, and technology\n\u2022 Explain capital deepening and its significance\n\u2022 Analyze the methods employed in economic growth accounting studies\n\u2022 Identify factors that contribute to a healthy climate for economic growth\nOver decades and generations, seemingly small differences of a few percentage points in the annual rate of\neconomic growth make an enormous difference in GDP per capita. In this module, we discuss some of the\ncomponents of economic growth, including physical capital, human capital, and technology.\nThe category ofphysical capitalincludes the plant and equipment that firms use as well as things like roads\n(also calledinfrastructure). Again, greater physical capital implies more output. Physical capital can affect\nproductivity in two ways: (1) an increase in thequantityof physical capital (for example, more computers of\nthe same quality); and (2) an increase in thequalityof physical capital (same number of computers but the\ncomputers are faster, and so on).Human capitalrefers to the skills and knowledge that make workers\nproductive. Human capital and physical capital accumulation are similar: In both cases, investment now pays\noff in higher productivity in the future.\nThe category oftechnologyis the \u201cjoker in the deck.\u201d Earlier we described it as the combination of invention\nand innovation. When most people think of new technology, the invention of new products like the laser, the\nsmartphone, or some new wonder drug come to mind. In food production, developing more drought-resistant\nseeds is another example of technology. Technology, as economists use the term, however, includes still more.\nIt includes new ways of organizing work, like the invention of the assembly line, new methods for ensuring\nbetter quality of output in factories, and innovative institutions that facilitate the process of converting inputs\ninto output. In short, technology comprises all the advances that make the existing machines and other inputs\nproduce more, and at higher quality, as well as altogether new products.\nIt may not make sense to compare the GDPs of China and say, Benin, simply because of the great difference in\npopulation size. To understand economic growth, which is really concerned with the growth in living 488 20 \u2022 Economic Growth\nstandards of an average person, it is often useful to focus onGDP per capita. Using GDP per capita also makes\nit easier to compare countries with smaller numbers of people, like Belgium, Uruguay, or Zimbabwe, with\ncountries that have larger populations, like the United States, the Russian Federation, or Nigeria.\nTo obtain a per capita production function, divide each input inFigure 20.2(a) by the population. This creates a\nsecondaggregate production functionwhere the output is GDP per capita (that is, GDP divided by population).\nThe inputs are the average level of human capital per person, the average level of physical capital per person,\nand the level of technology per person\u2014seeFigure 20.2(b). The result of having population in the denominator\nis mathematically appealing. Increases in population lower per capita income. However, increasing population\nis important for the average person only if the rate of income growth exceeds population growth. A more\nimportant reason for constructing a per capita production function is to understand the contribution of human\nand physical capital.\nCapital Deepening\nWhen society increases the level of capital per person, we call the resultcapital deepening. The idea of capital\ndeepening can apply both to additional human capital per worker and to additional physical capital per\nworker.\nRecall that one way to measure human capital is to look at the average levels of education in an economy.\nFigure 20.5illustrates the human capital deepening for U.S. workers by showing that the proportion of the U.S.\npopulation with a high school and a college degree is rising. As recently as 1970, for example, only about half of\nU.S. adults had at least a high school diploma. By the start of the twenty-first century, more than 80% of adults\nhad graduated from high school. The idea of human capital deepening also applies to the years of experience\nthat workers have, but the average experience level of U.S. workers has not changed much in recent decades.\nThus, the key dimension for deepening human capital in the U.S. economy focuses more on additional\neducation and training than on a higher average level of work experience.\nFIGURE20.5Human Capital Deepening in the U.S.Rising levels of education for persons 25 and older show the\ndeepening of human capital in the U.S. economy. Even today, under one-third of U.S. adults have completed a four-\nyear college degree. There is clearly room for additional deepening of human capital to occur. (Source: Penn World\nTables, 10.0 https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/productivity/pwt/?lang=en)\nFigure 20.6shows physical capital deepening in the U.S. economy. The average U.S. worker in the late 2000s\nwas working with physical capital worth almost three times as much as that of the average worker of the early\nAccess for free at openstax.org 20.3 \u2022 Components of Economic Growth 489\n1950s.\nFIGURE20.6Physical Capital per Worker in the United StatesThe value of the physical capital, measured by plant\nand equipment, used by the average worker in the U.S. economy has risen over the decades. The increase may have\nleveled off a bit in the 1970s and 1980s, which were, not coincidentally, times of slower-than-usual growth in\nworker productivity. We see a renewed increase in physical capital per worker in the late 1990s, followed by a\nflattening in the early 2000s. (Source: Center for International Comparisons of Production, Income and Prices,\nUniversity of Pennsylvania)\nNot only does the current U.S. economy have better-educated workers with more and improved physical\ncapital than it did several decades ago, but these workers have access to more advanced technologies. Growth\nin technology is impossible to measure with a simple line on a graph, but evidence that we live in an age of\ntechnological marvels is all around us\u2014discoveries in genetics and in the structure of particles, the wireless\ninternet, and other inventions almost too numerous to count. TheU.S. Patent and Trademark Officetypically\nhas issued more than 150,000 patents annually in recent years.\nThis recipe for economic growth\u2014investing in labor productivity, with investments in human capital and\ntechnology, as well as increasing physical capital\u2014also applies to other economies. South Korea, for example,\nalready achieved universal enrollment in primary school (the equivalent of kindergarten through sixth grade\nin the United States) by 1965, when Korea\u2019s GDP per capita was still near its rock bottom low. By the late 1980s,\nKorea had achieved almost universal secondary school education (the equivalent of a high school education in\nthe United States). With regard to physical capital, Korea\u2019s rates of investment had been about 15% of GDP at\nthe start of the 1960s, but doubled to 30\u201335% of GDP by the late 1960s and early 1970s. With regard to\ntechnology, South Korean students went to universities and colleges around the world to obtain scientific and\ntechnical training, and South Korean firms reached out to study and form partnerships with firms that could\noffer them technological insights. These factors combined to foster South Korea\u2019s high rate of economic\ngrowth.\nGrowth Accounting Studies\nSince the late 1950s, economists have conducted growth accounting studies to determine the extent to which 490 20 \u2022 Economic Growth\nphysical and human capital deepening and technology have contributed to growth. The usual approach uses\nan aggregate production function to estimate how much of per capita economic growth can be attributed to\ngrowth in physical capital and human capital. We can measure these two inputs at least roughly. The part of\ngrowth that is unexplained by measured inputs, called the residual, is then attributed to growth in technology.\nThe exact numerical estimates differ from study to study and from country to country, depending on how\nresearchers measured these three main factors and over what time horizons. For studies of the U.S. economy,\nthree lessons commonly emerge from growth accounting studies.\nFirst, technology is typically the most important contributor to U.S. economic growth. Growth in human capital\nand physical capital often explains only half or less than half of the economic growth that occurs. New ways of\ndoing things are tremendously important.\nSecond, while investment in physical capital is essential to growth in labor productivity and GDP per capita,\nbuilding human capital is at least as important. Economic growth is not just a matter of more machines and\nbuildings. One vivid example of the power of human capital and technological knowledge occurred in Europe\nin the years after World War II (1939\u20131945). During the war, a large share of Europe\u2019s physical capital, such as\nfactories, roads, and vehicles, was destroyed. Europe also lost an overwhelming amount of human capital in\nthe form of millions of men, women, and children who died during the war. However, the powerful\ncombination of skilled workers and technological knowledge, working within a market-oriented economic\nframework, rebuilt Europe\u2019s productive capacity to an even higher level within less than two decades.\nA third lesson is that these three factors of human capital, physical capital, and technology work together.\nWorkers with a higher level of education and skills are often better at coming up with new technological\ninnovations. These technological innovations are often ideas that cannot increase production until they\nbecome a part of new investment in physical capital. New machines that embody technological innovations\noften require additional training, which builds worker skills further. If the recipe for economic growth is to\nsucceed, an economy needs all the ingredients of the aggregate production function. See the following Clear It\nUp feature for an example of how human capital, physical capital, and technology can combine to significantly\nimpact lives.\nCLEAR IT UP\nHow do girls\u2019 education and economic growth relate in low-income countries?\nIn the early 2000s, according to the World Bank, about 110 million children between the ages of 6 and 11 were not\nin school\u2014and about two-thirds of them were girls. In Afghanistan, for example, the literacy rate for those aged\n15-24 for the period 2005-2014 was 62% for males and only 32% for females. In Benin, in West Africa, it was 55%\nfor males and 31% for females. In Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country, it was 76% for males and 58 percent for\nfemales.\nWhenever any child does not receive a basic education, it is both a human and an economic loss. In low-income\ncountries, wages typically increase by an average of 10 to 20% with each additional year of education. There is,\nhowever, some intriguing evidence that helping girls in low-income countries to close the education gap with boys\nmay be especially important, because of the social role that many of the girls will play as mothers and homemakers.\nGirls in low-income countries who receive more education tend to grow up to have fewer, healthier, better-educated\nchildren. Their children are more likely to be better nourished and to receive basic health care like immunizations.\nEconomic research on women in low-income economies backs up these findings. When 20 women obtain one\nadditional year of schooling, as a group they will, on average, have one less child. When 1,000 women obtain one\nadditional year of schooling, on average one to two fewer women from that group will die in childbirth. When a\nwoman stays in school an additional year, that factor alone means that, on average, each of her children will spend\nan additional half-year in school. Education for girls is a good investment because it is an investment in economic\ngrowth with benefits beyond the current generation.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 20.3 \u2022 Components of Economic Growth 491\nA Healthy Climate for Economic Growth\nWhile physical and human capital deepening and better technology are important, equally important to a\nnation\u2019s well-being is the climate or system within which these inputs are cultivated. Both the type of market\neconomy and a legal system that governs and sustains property rights and contractual rights are important\ncontributors to a healthy economic climate.\nA healthy economic climate usually involves some sort of market orientation at the microeconomic, individual,\nor firm decision-making level. Markets that allow personal and business rewards and incentives for increasing\nhuman and physical capital encourage overall macroeconomic growth. For example, when workers participate\nin a competitive and well-functioning labor market, they have an incentive to acquire additional human\ncapital, because additional education and skills will pay off in higher wages. Firms have an incentive to invest\nin physical capital and in training workers, because they expect to earn higher profits for their shareholders.\nBoth individuals and firms look for new technologies, because even small inventions can make work easier or\nlead to product improvement. Collectively, such individual and business decisions made within a market\nstructure add up to macroeconomic growth. Much of the rapid growth since the late nineteenth century has\ncome from harnessing the power of competitive markets to allocate resources. This market orientation\ntypically reaches beyond national borders and includes openness to international trade.\nA general orientation toward markets does not rule out important roles for government. There are times when\nmarkets fail to allocate capital or technology in a manner that provides the greatest benefit for society as a\nwhole. The government's role is to correct these failures. In addition, government can guide or influence\nmarkets toward certain outcomes. The following examples highlight some important areas that governments\naround the world have chosen to invest in to facilitate capital deepening and technology:\n\u2022 Education. The Danish government requires all children under 16 to attend school. They can choose to\nattend a public school (Folkeskole) or a private school. Students do not pay tuition to attendFolkeskole.\nThirteen percent of primary/secondary (elementary/high) school is private, and the government supplies\nvouchers to citizens who choose private school.\n\u2022 Savings and Investment. In the United States, as in other countries, the government taxes gains from\nprivate investment. Low capital gains taxes encourage investment and so also economic growth.\n\u2022 Infrastructure. The Japanese government in the mid-1990s undertook significant infrastructure projects\nto improve roads and public works. This in turn increased the stock of physical capital and ultimately\neconomic growth.\n\u2022 Special Economic Zones. The island of Mauritius is one of the few African nations to encourage\ninternational trade in government-supportedspecial economic zones (SEZ). These are areas of the\ncountry, usually with access to a port where, among other benefits, the government does not tax trade. As a\nresult of its SEZ, Mauritius has enjoyed above-average economic growth since the 1980s. Free trade does\nnot have to occur in an SEZ however. Governments can encourage international trade across the board, or\nsurrender to protectionism.\n\u2022 Scientific Research. The European Union has strong programs to invest in scientific research. The\nresearchersAbraham Garc\u00edaandPierre Mohnendemonstrate that firms which received support from the\nAustrian government actually increased their research intensity and had more sales. Governments can\nsupport scientific research and technical training that helps to create and spread new technologies.\nGovernments can also provide a legal environment that protects the ability of inventors to profit from their\ninventions.\nThere are many more ways in which the government can play an active role in promoting economic growth.\nWe explore them in other chapters and in particular inMacroeconomic Policy Around the World. A healthy\nclimate for growth in GDP per capita and labor productivity includes human capital deepening, physical\ncapital deepening, and technological gains, operating in a market-oriented economy with supportive\ngovernment policies. 492 20 \u2022 Economic Growth\n20.4Economic Convergence\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain economic convergence\n\u2022 Analyze various arguments for and against economic convergence\n\u2022 Evaluate the speed of economic convergence between high-income countries and the rest of the world\nSome low-income and middle-income economies around the world have shown a pattern ofconvergence, in\nwhich their economies grow faster than those of high-income countries. GDP increased by an average rate of\n2.7% per year in the 1990s and 1.7% per year from 2010 to 2019 in the high-income countries of the world,\nwhich include the United States, Canada, the European Union countries, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.\nTable 20.5lists eight countries that belong to an informal \u201cfast growth club.\u201d These countries averaged GDP\ngrowth (after adjusting for inflation) of at least 5% per year in both the time periods from 1990 to 2000 and\nfrom 2010 to 2019. Since economic growth in these countries has exceeded the average of the world\u2019s high-\nincome economies, these countries may converge with the high-income countries. The second part ofTable\n20.5lists the \u201cslow growth club,\u201d which consists of countries that averaged GDP growth of 2% per year or less\n(after adjusting for inflation) during the same time periods. The final portion ofTable 20.5shows GDP growth\nrates for the countries of the world divided by income.\nAverage Growth Rate of Real GDP Growth Rate of Real GDP\nCountry\n1990\u20132000 2010\u20132019\nFast Growth Club (5% or more per year in both time periods)\nCambodia 7.1% 7.0%\nChina 10.6% 7.3%\nIndia 6.0% 6.7%\nIreland 7.5% 6.3%\nLaos 6.5% 7.3%\nMozambique 6.4% 5.6%\nUganda 7.1% 5.4%\nVietnam 7.9% 6.3%\nSlow Growth Club (2% or less per year in both time periods)\nCentral African Republic 2.0% \u20130.2%\nFrance 2.0% 1.4%\nGermany 1.8% 2.0%\nHaiti \u20131.5% 1.5%\nItaly 1.6% 0.3%\nTABLE20.5Economic Growth around the World(Source: http://databank.worldbank.org/data/views/\nvariableSelection/selectvariables.aspx?source=world-development-indicators#c_u)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 20.4 \u2022 Economic Convergence 493\nAverage Growth Rate of Real GDP Growth Rate of Real GDP\nCountry\n1990\u20132000 2010\u20132019\nJamaica 0.9% 0.7%\nJapan 1.3% 1.3%\nSwitzerland 1.0% 2.0%\nUnited States (for\n3.2% 2.3%\nreference)\nWorld Overview\nHigh income 2.7% 1.7%\nLow income 3.8% 4.5%\nMiddle income 4.7% 4.0%\nTABLE20.5Economic Growth around the World(Source: http://databank.worldbank.org/data/views/\nvariableSelection/selectvariables.aspx?source=world-development-indicators#c_u)\nEach of the countries inTable 20.5has its own unique story of investments in human and physical capital,\ntechnological gains, market forces, government policies, and even lucky events, but an overall pattern of\nconvergence is clear. The low-income countries have GDP growth that is faster than that of the middle-income\ncountries, which in turn have GDP growth that is faster than that of the high-income countries. Two prominent\nmembers of the fast-growth club are China and India, which between them have nearly 40% of the world\u2019s\npopulation. Some prominent members of the slow-growth club are high-income countries like France,\nGermany, Italy, and Japan.\nWill this pattern of economic convergence persist into the future? This is a controversial question among\neconomists that we will consider by looking at some of the main arguments on both sides.\nArguments Favoring Convergence\nSeveral arguments suggest that low-income countries might have an advantage in achieving greater worker\nproductivity and economic growth in the future.\nA first argument is based on diminishing marginal returns. Even though deepening human and physical\ncapital will tend to increase GDP per capita, thelaw of diminishing returnssuggests that as an economy\ncontinues to increase its human and physical capital, the marginal gains to economic growth will diminish. For\nexample, raising the average education level of the population by two years from a tenth-grade level to a high\nschool diploma (while holding all other inputs constant) would produce a certain increase in output. An\nadditional two-year increase, so that the average person had a two-year college degree, would increase output\nfurther, but the marginal gain would be smaller. Yet another additional two-year increase in the level of\neducation, so that the average person would have a four-year-college bachelor\u2019s degree, would increase output\nstill further, but the marginal increase would again be smaller. A similar lesson holds for physical capital. If the\nquantity of physical capital available to the average worker increases, by, say, $5,000 to $10,000 (again, while\nholding all other inputs constant), it will increase the level of output. An additional increase from $10,000 to\n$15,000 will increase output further, but the marginal increase will be smaller.\nLow-income countries like China and India tend to have lower levels of human capital and physical capital, so\nan investment in capital deepening should have a larger marginal effect in these countries than in high- 494 20 \u2022 Economic Growth\nincome countries, where levels of human and physical capital are already relatively high. Diminishing returns\nimplies that low-income economies could converge to the levels that the high-income countries achieve.\nA second argument is that low-income countries may find it easier to improve their technologies than high-\nincome countries. High-income countries must continually invent new technologies, whereas low-income\ncountries can often find ways of applying technology that has already been invented and is well understood.\nThe economistAlexander Gerschenkron(1904\u20131978) gave this phenomenon a memorable name: \u201cthe\nadvantages of backwardness.\u201d Of course, he did not literally mean that it is an advantage to have a lower\nstandard of living. He was pointing out that a country that is behind has some extra potential for catching up.\nFinally, optimists argue that many countries have observed the experience of those that have grown more\nquickly and have learned from it. Moreover, once the people of a country begin to enjoy the benefits of a higher\nstandard of living, they may be more likely to build and support the market-friendly institutions that will help\nprovide this standard of living.\nLINK IT UP\nView thisvideo(http://openstax.org/l/tedhansrosling)to learn about economic growth across the world.\nArguments That Convergence Is neither Inevitable nor Likely\nIf the economy's growth depended only on the deepening of human capital and physical capital, then we would\nexpect that economy's growth rate to slow down over the long run because of diminishing marginal returns.\nHowever, there is another crucial factor in the aggregate production function: technology.\nDeveloping new technology can provide a way for an economy to sidestep the diminishing marginal returns of\ncapital deepening.Figure 20.7shows how. The figure's horizontal axis measures the amount of capital\ndeepening, which on this figure is an overall measure that includes deepening of both physical and human\ncapital. The amount of human and physical capital per worker increases as you move from left to right, from C\n1\nto C to C . The diagram's vertical axis measures per capita output. Start by considering the lowest line in this\n2 3\ndiagram, labeled Technology 1. Along this aggregate production function, the level of technology is held\nconstant, so the line shows only the relationship between capital deepening and output. As capital deepens\nfrom C to C to C and the economy moves from R to U to W, per capita output does increase\u2014but the way in\n1 2 3\nwhich the line starts out steeper on the left but then flattens as it moves to the right shows the diminishing\nmarginal returns, as additional marginal amounts of capital deepening increase output by ever-smaller\namounts. The shape of the aggregate production line (Technology 1) shows that the ability of capital\ndeepening, by itself, to generate sustained economic growth is limited, since diminishing returns will\neventually set in.\nFIGURE20.7Capital Deepening and New TechnologyImagine that the economy starts at point R, with the level of\nphysical and human capital C and the output per capita at G . If the economy relies only on capital deepening,\n1 1\nwhile remaining at the technology level shown by the Technology 1 line, then it would face diminishing marginal\nAccess for free at openstax.org 20.4 \u2022 Economic Convergence 495\nreturns as it moved from point R to point U to point W. However, now imagine that capital deepening is combined\nwith improvements in technology. Then, as capital deepens from C to C , technology improves from Technology 1\n1 2\nto Technology 2, and the economy moves from R to S. Similarly, as capital deepens from C to C , technology\n2 3\nincreases from Technology 2 to Technology 3, and the economy moves from S to T. With improvements in\ntechnology, there is no longer any reason that economic growth must necessarily slow down.\nNow, bring improvements in technology into the picture. Improved technology means that with a given set of\ninputs, more output is possible. The production function labeled Technology 1 in the figure is based on one\nlevel of technology, but Technology 2 is based on an improved level of technology, so for every level of capital\ndeepening on the horizontal axis, it produces a higher level of output on the vertical axis. In turn, production\nfunction Technology 3 represents a still higher level of technology, so that for every level of inputs on the\nhorizontal axis, it produces a higher level of output on the vertical axis than either of the other two aggregate\nproduction functions.\nMost healthy, growing economies are deepening their human and physical capital and increasing technology\nat the same time. As a result, the economy can move from a choice like point R on the Technology 1 aggregate\nproduction line to a point like S on Technology 2 and a point like T on the still higher aggregate production line\n(Technology 3). With the combination of technology and capital deepening, the rise in GDP per capita in high-\nincome countries does not need to fade away because of diminishing returns. The gains from technology can\noffset the diminishing returns involved with capital deepening.\nWill technological improvements themselves run into diminishing returns over time? That is, will it become\ncontinually harder and more costly to discover new technological improvements? Perhaps someday, but, at\nleast over the last two centuries since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, improvements in technology\nhave not run into diminishing marginal returns. Modern inventions, like the internet or discoveries in genetics\nor materials science, do not seem to provide smaller gains to output than earlier inventions like the steam\nengine or the railroad. One reason that technological ideas do not seem to run into diminishing returns is that\nwe often can apply widely the ideas of new technology at a marginal cost that is very low or even zero. A\nspecific worker or group of workers must use a specific additional machine, or an additional year of education.\nMany workers across the economy can use a new technology or invention at very low marginal cost.\nThe argument that it is easier for a low-income country to copy and adapt existing technology than it is for a\nhigh-income country to invent new technology is not necessarily true, either. When it comes to adapting and\nusing new technology, a society\u2019s performance is not necessarily guaranteed, but is the result of whether the\ncountry's economic, educational, and public policy institutions are supportive. In theory, perhaps, low-income\ncountries have many opportunities to copy and adapt technology, but if they lack the appropriate supportive\neconomic infrastructure and institutions, the theoretical possibility that backwardness might have certain\nadvantages is of little practical relevance.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/Indiapoverty)to read more about economic growth in India.\nThe Slowness of Convergence\nAlthough economic convergence between the high-income countries and the rest of the world seems possible\nand even likely, it will proceed slowly. Consider, for example, a country that starts off with a GDP per capita of\n$40,000, which would roughly represent a typical high-income country today, and another country that starts\nout at $4,000, which is roughly the level in low-income but not impoverished countries like Indonesia,\nGuatemala, or Egypt. Say that the rich country chugs along at a 2% annual growth rate of GDP per capita, while\nthe poorer country grows at the aggressive rate of 7% per year. After 30 years, GDP per capita in the rich\ncountry will be $72,450 (that is, $40,000 (1 + 0.02)30) while in the poor country it will be $30,450 (that is,\n$4,000 (1 + 0.07)30). Convergence has occurred. The rich country used to be 10 times as wealthy as the poor 496 20 \u2022 Economic Growth\none, and now it is only about 2.4 times as wealthy. Even after 30 consecutive years of very rapid growth,\nhowever, people in the low-income country are still likely to feel quite poor compared to people in the rich\ncountry. Moreover, as the poor country catches up, its opportunities for catch-up growth are reduced, and its\ngrowth rate may slow down somewhat.\nThe slowness of convergence illustrates again that small differences in annual rates of economic growth\nbecome huge differences over time. The high-income countries have been building up their advantage in\nstandard of living over decades\u2014more than a century in some cases. Even in an optimistic scenario, it will take\ndecades for the low-income countries of the world to catch up significantly.\nBRING IT HOME\nCalories and Economic Growth\nWe can tell the story of modern economic growth by looking at calorie consumption over time. The dramatic rise in\nincomes allowed the average person to eat better and consume more calories. How did these incomes increase?\nThe neoclassical growth consensus uses theaggregate production functionto suggest that the period of modern\neconomic growth came about because of increases in inputs such as technology and physical and human capital.\nAlso important was the way in which technological progress combined with physical and human capital deepening\nto create growth and convergence. The issue of distribution of income notwithstanding, it is clear that the average\nworker can afford more calories in 2020 than in 1875.\nAside from increases in income, there is another reason why the average person can afford more food. Modern\nagriculture has allowed many countries to produce more food than they need. Despite having more than enough\nfood, however, many governments and multilateral agencies have not solved the food distribution problem. In fact,\nfood shortages, famine, or general food insecurity are caused more often by the failure of government\nmacroeconomic policy, according to the Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen. Sen has conducted extensive\nresearch into issues of inequality, poverty, and the role of government in improving standards of living.\nMacroeconomic policies that strive toward stable inflation, full employment, education of women, and preservation\nof property rights are more likely to eliminate starvation and provide for a more even distribution of food.\nBecause we have more food per capita, global food prices have decreased since 1875. The prices of some foods,\nhowever, have decreased more than the prices of others. For example, researchers from the University of\nWashington have shown that in the United States, calories from zucchini and lettuce are 100 times more expensive\nthan calories from oil, butter, and sugar. Research from countries like India, China, and the United States suggests\nthat as incomes rise, individuals want more calories from fats and protein and fewer from carbohydrates. This has\nvery interesting implications for global food production, obesity, and environmental consequences. Affluent urban\nIndia has an obesity problem much like many parts of the United States.

In the last half-century, countries like Japan, South Korea, and\nChina have shown the potential to catch up. The Industrial Revolution facilitated the extensive process of\neconomic growth, that economists often refer to as modern economic growth. This increased worker\nproductivity and trade, as well as the development of governance and market institutions.\n20.2Labor Productivity and Economic Growth\nWe can measure productivity, the value of what is produced per worker, or per hour worked, as the level of GDP\nper worker or GDP per hour. The United States experienced a productivity slowdown between 1973 and 1989.\nSince then, U.S. productivity has rebounded for the most part, but annual growth in productivity in the\nnonfarm business sector has been less than one percent each year between 2011 and 2016. It is not clear what\nproductivity growth will be in the coming years. The rate of productivity growth is the primary determinant of\nan economy\u2019s rate of long-term economic growth and higher wages. Over decades and generations, seemingly\nsmall differences of a few percentage points in the annual rate of economic growth make an enormous\ndifference in GDP per capita. An aggregate production function specifies how certain inputs in the economy,\nlike human capital, physical capital, and technology, lead to the output measured as GDP per capita. 498 20 \u2022 Self-Check Questions\nCompound interest and compound growth rates behave in the same way as productivity rates. Seemingly\nsmall changes in percentage points can have big impacts on income over time.\n20.3Components of Economic Growth\nOver decades and generations, seemingly small differences of a few percentage points in the annual rate of\neconomic growth make an enormous difference in GDP per capita. Capital deepening refers to an increase in\nthe amount of capital per worker, either human capital per worker, in the form of higher education or skills, or\nphysical capital per worker. Technology, in its economic meaning, refers broadly to all new methods of\nproduction, which includes major scientific inventions but also small inventions and even better forms of\nmanagement or other types of institutions. A healthy climate for growth in GDP per capita consists of\nimprovements in human capital, physical capital, and technology, in a market-oriented environment with\nsupportive public policies and institutions.\n20.4Economic Convergence\nWhen countries with lower GDP levels per capita catch up to countries with higher GDP levels per capita, we\ncall the process convergence. Convergence can occur even when both high- and low-income countries increase\ninvestment in physical and human capital with the objective of growing GDP. This is because the impact of new\ninvestment in physical and human capital on a low-income country may result in huge gains as new skills or\nequipment combine with the labor force. In higher-income countries, however, a level of investment equal to\nthat of the low income country is not likely to have as big an impact, because the more developed country most\nlikely already has high levels of capital investment. Therefore, the marginal gain from this additional\ninvestment tends to be successively less and less. Higher income countries are more likely to have diminishing\nreturns to their investments and must continually invent new technologies. This allows lower-income\neconomies to have a chance for convergent growth. However, many high-income economies have developed\neconomic and political institutions that provide a healthy economic climate for an ongoing stream of\ntechnological innovations. Continuous technological innovation can counterbalance diminishing returns to\ninvestments in human and physical capital.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

Between March 2020 and April 2020, the\nU.S. unemployment rate increased from 4.4% to 14.8%. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of people\nwere left without work as businesses shut down and people stayed home and cut their spending, especially on\nrestaurants, tourism, and travel. As confidence and spending were slowly restored, and as the situation with the\nvirus steadily improved, unemployment began to tick down. By 2022, with the availability of vaccines and boosters\nand other improved health measures, things were better still, but the presence of dangerous variants prevented a\nfull return to normal. 502 21 \u2022 Unemployment\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had other effects on the labor market as well. Labor force participation\u2014the rate at which\npeople are employed or actively searching for work\u2014declined and as of early-2022 remained lower than it was in\n2019. Some were forced to stop working because of school and childcare closures. Others were concerned about\nhow safe their workplaces would be in the middle of a global pandemic. And still others simply chose to retire early.\nLabor force participation remains a sore spot in the labor market's recovery.\nThese two statistics\u2014unemployment and labor force participation\u2014show how complicated the labor market can be.\nAs the unemployment rate declined through 2021, the disappointing statistics on labor force participation show\nweak points. One day you may have read a headline about how easy it was to find a job, and the next day a headline\nwould describe how difficult it was for employers to find workers. By the end of this chapter, you will be in a much\nbetter position to make sense of these events.\nUnemployment can be a terrible and wrenching life experience\u2014like a serious automobile accident or a messy\ndivorce\u2014whose consequences only someone who has gone through it can fully understand. For unemployed\nindividuals and their families, there is the day-to-day financial stress of not knowing from where the next\npaycheck is coming. There are painful adjustments, like watching your savings account dwindle, selling a car\nand buying a cheaper one, or moving to a less expensive place to live. Even when the unemployed person finds\na new job, it may pay less than the previous one. For many people, their job is an important part of their self\nworth. When unemployment separates people from the workforce, it can affect family relationships as well as\nmental and physical health.\nThe human costs of unemployment alone would justify making a low level of unemployment an important\npublic policy priority. However, unemployment also includes economic costs to the broader society. When\nmillions of unemployed but willing workers cannot find jobs, economic resource are unused. An economy with\nhigh unemployment is like a company operating with a functional but unused factory. Theopportunity costof\nunemployment is the output that the unemployed workers could have produced.\nThis chapter will discuss how economists define and compute the unemployment rate. It will examine the\npatterns of unemployment over time, for the U.S. economy as a whole, for different demographic groups in the\nU.S. economy, and for other countries. It will then consider an economic explanation for unemployment, and\nhow it explains the patterns of unemployment and suggests public policies for reducing it.\n21.1How Economists Define and Compute Unemployment Rate\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Calculate the labor force participation rate and the unemployment rate\n\u2022 Explain hidden unemployment and what it means to be in or out of the labor force\n\u2022 Evaluate the collection and interpretation of unemployment data\nNewspaper or television reports typically describe unemployment as a percentage or a rate. A recent report\nmight have said, for example,from September 2021 to October 2021, the U.S. unemployment rate declined\nfrom 4.8% to 4.6%. At a glance, the changes between the percentages may seem small. However, remember\nthat the U.S. economy has about 162 million adults (as of the beginning of 2022) who either have jobs or are\nlooking for them. A rise or fall of just 0.1% in the unemployment rate of 162 million potential workers\ntranslates into 160,000 people, which is roughly the total population of a city like Syracuse, New York,\nBrownsville, Texas, or Pasadena, California. Large rises in the unemployment rate mean large numbers of job\nlosses. In April 2020, at the peak of the pandemic-induced recession, over 20 million people were out of work.\nEven with the unemployment rate at 4.2% in November 2021, about 7 million people who were looking for jobs\nwere out of work.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21.1 \u2022 How Economists Define and Compute Unemployment Rate 503\nLINK IT UP\nTheBureau of Labor Statistics(http://openstax.org/l/BLS1)tracks and reports all data related to\nunemployment.\nWho\u2019s In or Out of the Labor Force?\nShould we count everyone without a job as unemployed? Of course not. For example, we should not count\nchildren as unemployed. Surely, we should not count the retired as unemployed. Many full-time college\nstudents have only a part-time job, or no job at all, but it seems inappropriate to count them as suffering the\npains of unemployment. Some people are not working because they are rearing children, ill, on vacation, or on\nparental leave.\nThe point is that we do not just divide the adult population into employed and unemployed. A third group\nexists: people who do not have a job, and for some reason\u2014retirement, looking after children, taking a\nvoluntary break before a new job\u2014are not interested in having a job, either. It also includes those who do want\na job but have quit looking, often due to discouragement due to their inability to find suitable employment.\nEconomists refer to this third group of those who are not working and not looking for work asout of the labor\nforceor not in the labor force.\nThe U.S. unemployment rate, which is based on a monthly survey carried out by the U.S. Bureau of the Census,\nasks a series of questions to divide the adult population into employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force.\nTo be classified as unemployed, a person must be without a job, currently available to work, and actively\nlooking for work in the previous four weeks. Thus, a person who does not have a job but who is not currently\navailable to work or has not actively looked for work in the last four weeks is counted as out of the labor force.\nEmployed: currently working for pay\nUnemployed: Out of work and actively looking for a job\nOut of the labor force: Out of paid work and not actively looking for a job\nLabor force: the number of employed plus the unemployed\nCalculating the Unemployment Rate\nFigure 21.2shows the three-way division of the 16-and-over population. In January 2017, about 62.9% of the\nadult population was \"in the labor force\"; that is, people are either employed or without a job but looking for\nwork. We can divide those in the labor force into the employed and the unemployed.Table 21.1shows those\nvalues. Theunemployment rateis not the percentage of the total adult population without jobs, but rather the\npercentage of adults who are in the labor force but who do not have jobs: 504 21 \u2022 Unemployment\nFIGURE21.2Employed, Unemployed, and Out of the Labor Force Distribution of Adult Population (age 16 and\nolder), January 2021The total adult, working-age population in January 2021 was 262.029 million. Out of this total\npopulation, 155.175 million were classified as employed, and 6.877 million were classified as unemployed. The\nremaining 99.977 million were classified as out of the labor force.

We will\nuse the values inTable 21.1to illustrate the steps.\nTo determine the percentage in the labor force:\nStep 1. Divide the number of people in the labor force (159.716 million) by the total adult (working-age)\npopulation (254.082 million).\nStep 2. Multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21.1 \u2022 How Economists Define and Compute Unemployment Rate 505\nTo determine the percentage out of the labor force:\nStep 1.

Multiply by 100 to obtain the rate.\nHidden Unemployment\nEven with the \u201cout of the labor force\u201d category, there are still some people who are mislabeled in the\ncategorization of employed, unemployed, or out of the labor force. There are some people who have only part\ntime or temporary jobs, and they are looking for full time and permanent employment that are counted as\nemployed, although they are not employed in the way they would like or need to be. Additionally, there are\nindividuals who areunderemployed. This includes those who are trained or skilled for one type or level of\nwork but are working in a lower paying job or one that does not utilize their skills. For example, we would\nconsider an individual with a college degree in finance who is working as a sales clerk underemployed. They\nare, however, also counted in the employed group. All of these individuals fall under the umbrella of the term\n\u201chidden unemployment.\u201dDiscouraged workers, those who have stopped looking for employment and, hence,\nare no longer counted in the unemployed also fall into this group\nLabor Force Participation Rate\nAnother important statistic is thelabor force participation rate. This is the percentage of adults in an\neconomy who are either employed or who are unemployed and looking for a job. Using the data inFigure 21.2\nandTable 21.1, those included in this calculation would be the 162.052 million individuals in the labor force.\nWe calculate the rate by taking the number of people in the labor force, that is, the number employed and the\nnumber unemployed, divided by the total adult population and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage. For\nthe data from November 2021, the labor force participation rate is 61.8%. Historically, the civilian labor force\nparticipation rate in the United States climbed beginning in the 1960s as women increasingly entered the\nworkforce, and it peaked at just over 67% in late 1999 to early 2000. Since then, the labor force participation\nrate has steadily declined, slowly to about 66% in 2008, early in the Great Recession, and then more rapidly\nduring and after that recession. The labor force then climbed slowly during the 2010s but declined again\nduring the pandemic in March\u2013April 2020 and remained lower than pre-pandemic levels as of early 2022. 506 21 \u2022 Unemployment\nThe Establishment Payroll Survey\nWhen the unemployment report comes out each month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) also reports on\nthe number of jobs created\u2014which comes from the establishment payroll survey. The payroll survey is based\non a survey of about 147,000 businesses and government agencies throughout the United States. It generates\npayroll employment estimates by the following criteria: all employees, average weekly hours worked, and\naverage hourly, weekly, and overtime earnings. One of the criticisms of this survey is that it does not count the\nself-employed. It also does not make a distinction between new, minimum wage, part time or temporary jobs\nand full time jobs with \u201cdecent\u201d pay.\nHow Does the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Collect the U.S. Unemployment Data?\nThe unemployment rate announced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on the first Friday of each month for\nthe previous month is based on the Current Population Survey (CPS), which the Bureau has carried out every\nmonth since 1940. The Bureau takes great care to make this survey representative of the country as a whole.\nThe country is first divided into 3,137 areas. The U.S. Bureau of the Census then selects 729 of these areas to\nsurvey. It divides the 729 areas into districts of about 300 households each, and divides each district into\nclusters of about four dwelling units. Every month, Census Bureau employees call about 15,000 of the four-\nhousehold clusters, for a total of 60,000 households. Employees interview households for four consecutive\nmonths, then rotate them out of the survey for eight months, and then interview them again for the same four\nmonths the following year, before leaving the sample permanently.\nBased on this survey, state, industry, urban and rural areas, gender, age, race or ethnicity, and level of\neducation statistics comprise components that contribute to unemployment rates. A wide variety of other\ninformation is available, too. For example, how long have people been unemployed? Did they become\nunemployed because they quit, or were laid off, or their employer went out of business? Is the unemployed\nperson the only wage earner in the family? The Current Population Survey is a treasure trove of information\nabout employment and unemployment. If you are wondering what the difference is between the CPS and EPS,\nread the following Clear it Up feature.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat is the difference between CPS and EPS?\nThe United States Census Bureau conducts the Current Population Survey (CPS), which measures the percentage of\nthe labor force that is unemployed. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' establishment payroll survey (EPS) is a payroll\nsurvey that measures the net change in jobs created for the month.\nCriticisms of Measuring Unemployment\nThere are always complications in measuring the number of unemployed. For example, what about people\nwho do not have jobs and would be available to work, but are discouraged by the lack of available jobs in their\narea and stopped looking? Such people, and their families, may be suffering the pains of unemployment.\nHowever, the survey counts them as out of the labor force because they are not actively looking for work. Other\npeople may tell the Census Bureau that they are ready to work and looking for a job but, truly, they are not that\neager to work and are not looking very hard at all. They are counted as unemployed, although they might more\naccurately be classified as out of the labor force. Still other people may have a job, perhaps doing something\nlike yard work, child care, or cleaning houses, but are not reporting the income earned to the tax authorities.\nThey may report being unemployed, when they actually are working.\nAlthough the unemployment rate gets most of the public and media attention, economic researchers at the\nBureau of Labor Statistics publish a wide array of surveys and reports that try to measure these kinds of issues\nand to develop a more nuanced and complete view of the labor market. It is not exactly a hot news flash that\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21.2 \u2022 Patterns of Unemployment 507\neconomic statistics are imperfect.

However, over time, the unemployment rate seems to return to a range of\n4% to 6%. There does not seem to be a long-term trend toward the rate moving generally higher or generally lower.\n(Source:Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/LRUN64TTUSA156S0)\nAs we look at this data, several patterns stand out:\n1. Unemployment rates do fluctuate over time. During the deep recessions of the early 1980s, 2007\u20132009,\nand 2021, unemployment reached roughly 10%. For comparison, during the 1930s Great Depression, the\nunemployment rate reached almost 25% of the labor force.\n2. Unemployment rates in the late 1990s and into the mid-2000s were rather low by historical standards.\nThe unemployment rate was below 5% from 1997 to 2000, and near 5% during almost all of 2006\u20132007,\nand 5% or less from September 2015 through March 2020. The previous time unemployment had been\nless than 5% for three consecutive years was three decades earlier, from 1968 to 1970.\n3. The unemployment rate never falls all the way to zero. It almost never seems to get below 3%\u2014and it stays\nthat low only for very short periods. (We discuss reasons why this is the case later in this chapter.)\n4. The timing of rises and falls in unemployment matches fairly well with the timing of upswings and 508 21 \u2022 Unemployment\ndownswings in the overall economy, except that unemployment tends to lag changes in economic activity,\nand especially so during upswings of the economy following a recession. During periods ofrecessionand\ndepression, unemployment is high. During periods of economic growth, unemployment tends to be lower.\n5. No significant upward or downward trend in unemployment rates is apparent. This point is especially\nworth noting because the U.S. population more than quadrupled from 76 million in 1900 to over 324\nmillion by 2017. Moreover, a higher proportion of U.S. adults are now in the paid workforce, because\nwomen have entered the paid labor force in significant numbers in recent decades. Women comprised\n18% of the paid workforce in 1900 and nearly half of the paid workforce in 2021. However, despite the\nincreased number of workers, as well as other economic events like globalization and the continuous\ninvention of new technologies, the economy has provided jobs without causing any long-term upward or\ndownward trend in unemployment rates.\nClick to view content(https://openstax.org/books/principles-economics-3e/pages/21-2-patterns-of-\nunemployment)\nUnemployment Rate from 1948. Similar to the graph in the figure above, the rate moves up and down as the\neconomy moves in and out of recessions.\nUnemployment Rates by Group\nUnemployment is not distributed evenly across the U.S. population.Figure 21.4shows unemployment rates\nbroken down in various ways: by gender, age, and race/ethnicity.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21.2 \u2022 Patterns of Unemployment 509\nFIGURE21.4Unemployment Rate by Demographic Group(a) By gender, 1948\u20132020. Unemployment rates for men\nused to be lower than unemployment rates for women, but in recent decades, the two rates have been very close,\noften\u2013 and especially during and soon after the Great Recession \u2013 with the unemployment rate for men somewhat\nhigher. (b) By age, 1948\u20132020. Unemployment rates are highest for the very young and become lower with age. (c)\nBy race and ethnicity, 1974\u20132020. Although unemployment rates for all groups tend to rise and fall together, the\nunemployment rate for Black people is typically about twice as high as that for White people, while the\nunemployment rate for Hispanic people is in between. (Source: www.bls.gov)\nThe unemployment rate for women had historically tended to be higher than the unemployment rate for men,\nperhaps reflecting the historical pattern that women were seen as \u201csecondary\u201d earners. By about 1980,\nhowever, the unemployment rate for women was essentially the same as that for men, asFigure 21.4(a) shows.\nDuring the pandemic-induced recession of 2020 and in the immediate aftermath, the unemployment rate for\nwomen exceeded the unemployment rate for men. Subsequently, however, the gap has narrowed. 510 21 \u2022 Unemployment\nLINK IT UP\nRead thisreport(http://openstax.org/l/BLS_recession)for detailed information on the 2008\u20132009 recession. It\nalso provides some very useful information on the statistics of unemployment.\nYounger workers tend to have higher unemployment, while middle-aged workers tend to have lower\nunemployment, probably because the middle-aged workers feel the responsibility of needing to have a job\nmore heavily. Younger workers move in and out of jobs more than middle-aged workers, as part of the process\nof matching of workers and jobs, and this contributes to their higher unemployment rates. In addition, middle-\naged workers are more likely to feel the responsibility of needing to have a job more heavily. Elderly workers\nhave extremely low rates of unemployment, because those who do not have jobs often exit the labor force by\nretiring, and thus are not counted in the unemployment statistics.Figure 21.4(b) shows unemployment rates\nfor women divided by age. The pattern for men is similar.\nThe unemployment rate for African-Americans is substantially higher than the rate for other racial or ethnic\ngroups, a fact that surely reflects, to some extent, a pattern of discrimination that has constrained Black\npeople\u2019s labor market opportunities. However, the gaps between unemployment rates for White, Black, and\nHispanic people have diminished in the 1990s, asFigure 21.4(c) shows. In fact, unemployment rates for Black\nand Hispanic people were at the lowest levels for several decades in the mid-2000s before rising during the\nrecent Great Recession.\nFinally, those with less education typically suffer higher unemployment. In November 2021, for example, the\nunemployment rate for those with a college degree was 2.3%; for those with some college but not a four year\ndegree, the unemployment rate was 3.7%; for high school graduates with no additional degree, the\nunemployment rate was 5.2%; and for those without a high school diploma, the unemployment rate was 5.7%.\nThis pattern arises because additional education typically offers better connections to the labor market and\nhigher demand. With less attractive labor market opportunities for low-skilled workers compared to the\nopportunities for the more highly-skilled, including lower pay, low-skilled workers may be less motivated to\nfind jobs.\nBreaking Down Unemployment in Other Ways\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics also gives information about the reasons for unemployment, as well as the\nlength of time individuals have been unemployed.Table 21.2, for example, shows the four reasons for\nunemployment and the percentages of the currently unemployed that fall into each category.Table 21.3shows\nthe length of unemployment.

For example, Japan\u2019s unemployment rates appear quite low, but Japan\u2019s economy has\nbeen mired in slow growth and recession since the late 1980s, and Japan\u2019s unemployment rate probably paints\ntoo rosy a picture of its labor market. In Japan, workers who lose their jobs are often quick to exit the labor\nforce and not look for a new job, in which case they are not counted as unemployed. In addition, Japanese\nfirms are often quite reluctant to fire workers, and so firms have substantial numbers of workers who are on\nreduced hours or officially employed, but doing very little. We can view this Japanese pattern as an unusual 512 21 \u2022 Unemployment\nmethod for society to provide support for the unemployed, rather than a sign of a healthy economy.\nLINK IT UP\nWe hear about the Chinese economy in the news all the time. The value of the Chinese yuan in comparison to\nthe U.S. dollar is likely to be part of the nightly business report, so why is the Chinese economy not included in\nthis discussion of international unemployment? The lack of reliable statistics is the reason. Thisarticle\n(http://openstax.org/l/ChinaEmployment)explains why.\nComparing unemployment rates in the United States and other high-income economies with unemployment\nrates in Latin America, Africa, Eastern Europe, and Asia is very difficult. One reason is that the statistical\nagencies in many poorer countries lack the resources and technical capabilities of the U.S. Bureau of the\nCensus. However, a more difficult problem with international comparisons is that in manylow-income\ncountries, most workers are not involved in the labor market through an employer who pays them regularly.\nInstead, workers in these countries are engaged in short-term work, subsistence activities, and barter.\nMoreover, the effect of unemployment is very different in high-income and low-income countries. Unemployed\nworkers in the developed economies have access to various government programs like unemployment\ninsurance, welfare, and food stamps. Such programs may barely exist in poorer countries. Although\nunemployment is a serious problem in many low-income countries, it manifests itself in a different way than\nin high-income countries.\n21.3What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Short Run\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Analyze cyclical unemployment\n\u2022 Explain the relationship between sticky wages and employment using various economic arguments\n\u2022 Apply supply and demand models to unemployment and wages\nWe have seen that unemployment varies across times and places. What causes changes in unemployment?\nThere are different answers in the short run and in the long run. Let's look at the short run first.\nCyclical Unemployment\nLet\u2019s make the plausible assumption that in the short run, from a few months to a few years, the quantity of\nhours that the average person is willing to work for a given wage does not change much, so the labor supply\ncurve does not shift much. In addition, make the standardceteris paribusassumption that there is no\nsubstantial short-term change in the age structure of the labor force, institutions and laws affecting the labor\nmarket, or other possibly relevant factors.\nOne primary determinant of the demand for labor from firms is how they perceive the state of themacro\neconomy. If firms believe that business is expanding, then at any given wage they will desire to hire a greater\nquantity of labor, and the labor demand curve shifts to the right. Conversely, if firms perceive that the economy\nis slowing down or entering a recession, then they will wish to hire a lower quantity of labor at any given wage,\nand the labor demand curve will shift to the left. Economists call the variation in unemployment that the\neconomy causes moving from expansion to recession or from recession to expansion (i.e. the business cycle)\ncyclical unemployment.\nFrom the standpoint of the supply-and-demand model of competitive and flexible labor markets,\nunemployment represents something of a puzzle. In a supply-and-demand model of a labor market, asFigure\n21.5illustrates, thelabor marketshould move toward an equilibrium wage and quantity. At the equilibrium\nwage (We), the equilibrium quantity (Qe) of labor supplied by workers should be equal to the quantity of labor\ndemanded by employers.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21.3 \u2022 What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Short Run 513\nFIGURE21.5The Unemployment and Equilibrium in the Labor MarketIn a labor market with flexible wages, the\nequilibrium will occur at wage We and quantity Qe, where the number of people who want jobs (shown by S) equals\nthe number of jobs available (shown by D).\nOne possibility for unemployment is that people who are unemployed are those who are not willing to work at\nthe current equilibrium wage, say $10 an hour, but would be willing to work at a higher wage, like $20 per hour.\nThe monthly Current Population Survey would count these people as unemployed, because they say they are\nready and looking for work (at $20 per hour). However, from an economist\u2019s perspective, these people are\nchoosing to be unemployed.\nProbably a few people are unemployed because of unrealistic expectations about wages, but they do not\nrepresent the majority of the unemployed. Instead, unemployed people often have friends or acquaintances of\nsimilar skill levels who are employed, and the unemployed would be willing to work at the jobs and wages\nsimilar to what those people are receiving. However, the employers of their friends and acquaintances do not\nseem to be hiring. In other words, these people are involuntarily unemployed. What causesinvoluntary\nunemployment?\nWhy Wages Might Be Sticky Downward\nIf a labor market model with flexible wages does not describe unemployment very well\u2014because it predicts\nthat anyone willing to work at the going wage can always find a job\u2014then it may prove useful to consider\neconomic models in which wages are not flexible or adjust only very slowly. In particular, even though wage\nincreases may occur with relative ease, wage decreases are few and far between.\nOne set of reasons why wages may be \u201csticky downward,\u201d as economists put it, involves economic laws and\ninstitutions. For low-skilled workers receivingminimum wage, it is illegal to reduce their wages. For union\nworkers operating under a multiyear contract with a company, wage cuts might violate the contract and create\na labor dispute or a strike. However, minimum wages and union contracts are not a sufficient reason why\nwages would be sticky downward for the U.S. economy as a whole. After all, out of the 73.3 million or so\nemployed workers in the U.S. economy who earn wages by the hour, only about 1.1 million\u2014less than 2% of the\ntotal\u2014do not receive compensation above the minimum wage. Similarly, labor unions represent only about\n12% of American wage and salary workers. In other high-income countries, more workers may have their\nwages determined by unions or the minimum wage may be set at a level that applies to a larger share of\nworkers. However, for the United States, these two factors combined affect only about 15% or less of the labor\nforce.\nEconomists looking for reasons why wages might bestickydownwards have focused on factors that may\ncharacterize most labor relationships in the economy, not just a few. Many have proposed a number of\ndifferent theories, but they share a common tone. 514 21 \u2022 Unemployment\nOne argument is that even employees who are not union members often work under animplicit contract,\nwhich is that the employer will try to keep wages from falling when the economy is weak or the business is\nhaving trouble, and the employee will not expect huge salary increases when the economy or the business is\nstrong. This wage-setting behavior acts like a form of insurance: the employee has some protection against\nwage declines in bad times, but pays for that protection with lower wages in good times. Clearly, this sort of\nimplicit contract means that firms will be hesitant to cut wages, lest workers feel betrayed and work less hard\nor even leave the firm.\nEfficiency wage theoryargues that workers' productivity depends on their pay, and so employers will often\nfind it worthwhile to pay their employees somewhat more than market conditions might dictate. One reason is\nthat employees who receive better pay than others will be more productive because they recognize that if they\nwere to lose their current jobs, they would suffer a decline in salary. As a result, they are motivated to work\nharder and to stay with the current employer. In addition, employers know that it is costly and time-consuming\nto hire and train new employees, so they would prefer to pay workers a little extra now rather than to lose them\nand have to hire and train new workers. Thus, by avoiding wage cuts, the employer minimizes costs of training\nand hiring new workers, and reaps the benefits of well-motivated employees.\nTheadverse selection of wage cuts argumentpoints out that if an employer reacts to poor business\nconditions by reducing wages for all workers, then the best workers, those with the best employment\nalternatives at other firms, are the most likely to leave. The least attractive workers, with fewer employment\nalternatives, are more likely to stay. Consequently, firms are more likely to choose which workers should\ndepart, through layoffs and firings, rather than trimming wages across the board. Sometimes companies that\nare experiencing difficult times can persuade workers to take a pay cut for the short term, and still retain most\nof the firm\u2019s workers. However, it is far more typical for companies to lay off some workers, rather than to cut\nwages for everyone.\nTheinsider-outsider modelof the labor force, in simple terms, argues that those already working for firms are\n\u201cinsiders,\u201d while new employees, at least for a time, are \u201coutsiders.\u201d A firm depends on its insiders to keep the\norganization running smoothly, to be familiar with routine procedures, and to train new employees. However,\ncutting wages will alienate the insiders and damage the firm\u2019s productivity and prospects.\nFinally, therelative wage coordination argumentpoints out that even if most workers were hypothetically\nwilling to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experiences\nsuch a decline, there is no obvious way for a decentralized economy to implement such a plan. Instead,\nworkers confronted with the possibility of a wage cut will worry that other workers will not have such a wage\ncut, and so a wage cut means being worse off both in absolute terms and relative to others. As a result, workers\nfight hard against wage cuts.\nThese theories of why wages tend not to move downward differ in their logic and their implications, and\nfiguring out the strengths and weaknesses of each theory is an ongoing subject of research and controversy\namong economists. All tend to imply that wages will decline only very slowly, if at all, even when the economy\nor a business is having tough times. When wages are inflexible and unlikely to fall, then either short-run or\nlong-run unemployment can result.Figure 21.6illustrates this.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21.3 \u2022 What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Short Run 515\nFIGURE21.6Sticky Wages in the Labor MarketBecause the wage rate is stuck at W, above the equilibrium, the\nnumber of those who want jobs (Qs) is greater than the number of job openings (Qd). The result is unemployment,\nshown by the bracket in the figure.\nFigure 21.7shows the interaction between shifts in labor demand and wages that are sticky downward.Figure\n21.7(a) illustrates the situation in which the demand for labor shifts to the right from D to D . In this case, the\n0 1\nequilibrium wage rises from W to W and the equilibrium quantity of labor hired increases from Q to Q . It\n0 1 0 1\ndoes not hurt employee morale at all for wages to rise.\nFigure 21.7(b) shows the situation in which the demand for labor shifts to the left, from D to D , as it would\n0 1\ntend to do in a recession. Because wages are sticky downward, they do not adjust toward what would have been\nthe new equilibrium wage (W ), at least not in the short run. Instead, after the shift in the labor demand curve,\n1\nthe same quantity of workers is willing to work at that wage as before; however, the quantity of workers\ndemanded at that wage has declined from the original equilibrium (Q ) to Q . The gap between the original\n0 2\nequilibrium quantity (Q ) and the new quantity demanded of labor (Q ) represents workers who would be\n0 2\nwilling to work at the going wage but cannot find jobs. The gap represents the economic meaning of\nunemployment.\nFIGURE21.7Rising Wage and Low Unemployment: Where Is the Unemployment in Supply and Demand?(a) In a\nlabor market where wages are able to rise, an increase in the demand for labor from D to D leads to an increase in\n0 1\nequilibrium quantity of labor hired from Q to Q and a rise in the equilibrium wage from W to W . (b) In a labor\n0 1 0 1\nmarket where wages do not decline, a fall in the demand for labor from D to D leads to a decline in the quantity of\n0 1 516 21 \u2022 Unemployment\nlabor demanded at the original wage (W ) from Q to Q . These workers will want to work at the prevailing wage\n0 0 2\n(W ), but will not be able to find jobs.\n0\nThis analysis helps to explain the connection that we noted earlier: that unemployment tends to rise in\nrecessions and to decline during expansions. The overall state of the economy shifts the labor demand curve\nand, combined with wages that are sticky downwards, unemployment changes. The rise in unemployment that\noccurs because of a recession is cyclical unemployment.\nLINK IT UP\nThe St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank is the best resource for macroeconomic time series data, known as the\nFederal Reserve Economic Data (FRED).FRED(http://openstax.org/l/FRED_employment)provides complete\ndata sets on various measures of the unemployment rate as well as the monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics\nreport on the results of the household and employment surveys.\n21.4What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Long Run\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain frictional and structural unemployment\n\u2022 Assess relationships between the natural rate of employment and potential real GDP, productivity, and\npublic policy\n\u2022 Identify recent patterns in the natural rate of employment\n\u2022 Propose ways to combat unemployment\nCyclical unemployment explains why unemployment rises during a recession and falls during an economic\nexpansion, but what explains the remaining level of unemployment even in good economic times? Why is the\nunemployment rate never zero? Even when the U.S. economy is growing strongly, the unemployment rate only\nrarely dips as low as 4%. Moreover, the discussion earlier in this chapter pointed out that unemployment rates\nin many European countries like Italy, France, and Germany have often been remarkably high at various times\nin the last few decades. Why does some level of unemployment persist even when economies are growing\nstrongly? Why are unemployment rates continually higher in certain economies, through good economic years\nand bad? Economists have a term to describe the remaining level of unemployment that occurs even when the\neconomy is healthy: they call it thenatural rate of unemployment.\nThe Long Run: The Natural Rate of Unemployment\nThe natural rate of unemployment is not \u201cnatural\u201d in the sense that water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit or\nboils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit. It is not a physical and unchanging law of nature. Instead, it is only the\n\u201cnatural\u201d rate because it is the unemployment rate that would result from the combination of economic, social,\nand political factors that exist at a time\u2014assuming the economy was neither booming nor in recession. These\nforces include the usual pattern of companies expanding and contracting their workforces in a dynamic\neconomy, social and economic forces that affect the labor market, or public policies that affect either the\neagerness of people to work or the willingness of businesses to hire. Let\u2019s discuss these factors in more detail.\nFrictional Unemployment\nIn amarket economy, some companies are always going broke for a variety of reasons: old technology; poor\nmanagement; good management that happened to make bad decisions; shifts in tastes of consumers so that\nless of the firm\u2019s product is desired; a large customer who went broke; or tough domestic or foreign\ncompetitors. Conversely, other companies will be doing very well for just the opposite reasons and looking to\nhire more employees. In a perfect world, all of those who lost jobs would immediately find new ones. However,\nin the real world, even if the number of job seekers is equal to the number of job vacancies, it takes time to find\nout about new jobs, to interview and figure out if the new job is a good match, or perhaps to sell a house and\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21.4 \u2022 What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Long Run 517\nbuy another in proximity to a new job. Economists call the unemployment that occurs in the meantime, as\nworkers move between jobs,frictional unemployment. Frictional unemployment is not inherently a bad\nthing. It takes time on part of both the employer and the individual to match those looking for employment\nwith the correct job openings. For individuals and companies to be successful and productive, you want people\nto find the job for which they are best suited, not just the first job offered.\nIn the mid-2000s, before the 2008\u20132009 recession, it was true that about 7% of U.S. workers saw their jobs\ndisappear in any three-month period. However, in periods of economic growth, these destroyed jobs are\ncounterbalanced for the economy as a whole by a larger number of jobs created. In 2019, for example, there\nwere typically about 6 million unemployed people at any given time in the U.S. economy. Even though about\ntwo-thirds of those unemployed people found a job in 14 weeks or fewer, the unemployment rate did not\nchange much during the year, because those who found new jobs were largely offset by others who lost jobs.\nOf course, it would be preferable if people who were losing jobs could immediately and easily move into newly\ncreated jobs, but in the real world, that is not possible. Someone who is laid off by a textile mill in South\nCarolina cannot turn around and immediately start working for a textile mill in California. Instead, the\nadjustment process happens in ripples. Some people find new jobs near their old ones, while others find that\nthey must move to new locations. Some people can do a very similar job with a different company, while others\nmust start new career paths. Some people may be near retirement and decide to look only for part-time work,\nwhile others want an employer that offers a long-term career path. The frictional unemployment that results\nfrom people moving between jobs in a dynamic economy may account for one to two percentage points of total\nunemployment.\nThe level of frictional unemployment will depend on how easy it is for workers to learn about alternative jobs,\nwhich may reflect the ease of communications about job prospects in the economy. The extent of frictional\nunemployment will also depend to some extent on how willing people are to move to new areas to find\njobs\u2014which in turn may depend on history and culture.\nFrictional unemployment and the natural rate of unemployment also seem to depend on the age distribution of\nthe population.Figure 21.4(b) showed that unemployment rates are typically lower for people between 25\u201354\nyears of age or aged 55 and over than they are for those who are younger. \u201cPrime-age workers,\u201d as those in the\n25\u201354 age bracket are sometimes called, are typically at a place in their lives when they want to have a job and\nincome arriving at all times. In addition, older workers who lose jobs may prefer to opt for retirement. By\ncontrast, it is likely that a relatively high proportion of those who are under 25 will be trying out jobs and life\noptions, and this leads to greater job mobility and hence higher frictional unemployment. Thus, a society with\na relatively high proportion of young workers, like the U.S. beginning in the mid-1960s when Baby Boomers\nbegan entering the labor market, will tend to have a higher unemployment rate than a society with a higher\nproportion of its workers in older ages.\nStructural Unemployment\nAnother factor that influences the natural rate of unemployment is the amount ofstructural unemployment.\nThe structurally unemployed are individuals who have no jobs because they lack skills valued by the labor\nmarket, either because demand has shifted away from the skills they do have, or because they never learned\nany skills. An example of the former would be the unemployment among aerospace engineers after the U.S.\nspace program downsized in the 1970s. An example of the latter would be high school dropouts.\nSome people worry that technology causes structural unemployment. In the past, new technologies have put\nlower skilled employees out of work, but at the same time they create demand for higher skilled workers to use\nthe new technologies. Education seems to be the key in minimizing the amount of structural unemployment.\nIndividuals who have degrees can be retrained if they become structurally unemployed. For people with no\nskills and little education, that option is more limited. 518 21 \u2022 Unemployment\nNatural Unemployment and Potential Real GDP\nThe natural unemployment rate is related to two other important concepts: full employment and potential real\nGDP. Economists consider the economy to be at full employment when the actual unemployment rate is equal\nto the natural unemployment rate. When the economy is at full employment, real GDP is equal to potential real\nGDP. By contrast, when the economy is below full employment, the unemployment rate is greater than the\nnatural unemployment rate and real GDP is less than potential. Finally, when the economy is above full\nemployment, then the unemployment rate is less than the natural unemployment rate and real GDP is greater\nthan potential. Operating above potential is only possible for a short while, since it is analogous to all workers\nworking overtime.\nProductivity Shifts and the Natural Rate of Unemployment\nUnexpected shifts in productivity can have a powerful effect on the natural rate of unemployment. Over time,\nworkers' productivity determines the level of wages in an economy. After all, if a business paid workers more\nthan could be justified by their productivity, the business will ultimately lose money and go bankrupt.\nConversely, if a business tries to pay workers less than their productivity then, in a competitive labor market,\nother businesses will find it worthwhile to hire away those workers and pay them more.\nHowever, adjustments of wages to productivity levels will not happen quickly or smoothly. Employers typically\nreviewwagesonly once or twice a year. In many modern jobs, it is difficult to measure productivity at the\nindividual level. For example, how precisely would one measure the quantity produced by an accountant who\nis one of many people working in the tax department of a large corporation? Because productivity is difficult to\nobserve, employers often determine wage increases based on recent experience with productivity. If\nproductivity has been rising at, say, 2% per year, then wages rise at that level as well. However, when\nproductivity changes unexpectedly, it can affect the natural rate of unemployment for a time.\nThe U.S. economy in the 1970s and 1990s provides two vivid examples of this process. In the 1970s,\nproductivity growth slowed down unexpectedly (as we discussed inEconomic Growth). For example, output\nper hour of U.S. workers in the business sector increased at an annual rate of 3.3% per year from 1960 to 1973,\nbut only 0.8% from 1973 to 1982.Figure 21.8(a) illustrates the situation where the demand for labor\u2014that is,\nthe quantity of labor that business is willing to hire at any given wage\u2014has been shifting out a little each year\nbecause of rising productivity, from D to D to D . As a result, equilibrium wages have been rising each year\n0 1 2\nfrom W to W to W . However, when productivity unexpectedly slows down, the pattern of wage increases\n0 1 2\ndoes not adjust right away. Wages keep rising each year from W to W to W , but the demand for labor is no\n2 3 4\nlonger shifting up. A gap opens where the quantity of labor supplied at wage level W is greater than the\n4\nquantity demanded. The natural rate of unemployment rises. In the aftermath of this unexpectedly low\nproductivity in the 1970s, the national unemployment rate did not fall below 7% from May, 1980 until 1986.\nOver time, the rise in wages will adjust to match the slower gains in productivity, and the unemployment rate\nwill ease back down, but this process may take years.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21.4 \u2022 What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Long Run 519\nFIGURE21.8Unexpected Productivity Changes and Unemployment(a) Productivity is rising, increasing the\ndemand for labor. Employers and workers become used to the pattern of wage increases. Then productivity\nsuddenly stops increasing. However, the expectations of employers and workers for wage increases do not shift\nimmediately, so wages keep rising as before. However, the demand for labor has not increased, so at wage W ,\n4\nunemployment exists where the quantity supplied of labor exceeds the quantity demanded. (b) The rate of\nproductivity increase has been zero for a time, so employers and workers have come to accept the equilibrium wage\nlevel (W). Then productivity increases unexpectedly, shifting demand for labor from D to D . At the wage (W), this\n0 1\nmeans that the quantity demanded of labor exceeds the quantity supplied, and with job offers plentiful, the\nunemployment rate will be low.\nThe late 1990s provide an opposite example: instead of the surprise decline in productivity that occurred in\nthe 1970s, productivity unexpectedly rose in the mid-1990s. The annual growth rate of real output per hour of\nlabor increased from 1.7% from 1980\u20131995, to an annual rate of 2.6% from 1995\u20132001. Let\u2019s simplify the\nsituation a bit, so that the economic lesson of the story is easier to see graphically, and say that productivity\nhad not been increasing at all in earlier years, so the intersection of the labor market was at point E inFigure\n21.8(b), where the demand curve for labor (D ) intersects the supply curve for labor. As a result, real wages\n0\nwere not increasing. Now, productivity jumps upward, which shifts the demand for labor out to the right, from\nD to D . At least for a time, however, wages are still set according to the earlier expectations of no productivity\n0 1\ngrowth, so wages do not rise. The result is that at the prevailing wage level (W), the quantity of labor demanded\n(Qd) will for a time exceed the quantity of labor supplied (Qs), and unemployment will be very low\u2014actually\nbelow the natural level of unemployment for a time. This pattern of unexpectedly high productivity helps to\nexplain why the unemployment rate stayed below 4.5%\u2014quite a low level by historical standards\u2014from 1998\nuntil after the U.S. economy had entered a recession in 2001.\nLevels of unemployment will tend to be somewhat higher on average when productivity is unexpectedly low,\nand conversely, will tend to be somewhat lower on average when productivity is unexpectedly high. However,\nover time, wages do eventually adjust to reflect productivity levels.\nPublic Policy and the Natural Rate of Unemployment\nPublic policy can also have a powerful effect on the natural rate of unemployment. On the supply side of the\nlabor market, public policies to assist the unemployed can affect how eager people are to find work. For\nexample, if a worker who loses a job is guaranteed a generous package of unemployment insurance, welfare\nbenefits, food stamps, and government medical benefits, then the opportunity cost of unemployment is lower\nand that worker will be less eager to seek a new job.\nWhat seems to matter most is not just the amount of these benefits, but how long they last. A society that 520 21 \u2022 Unemployment\nprovides generous help for the unemployed that cuts off after, say, six months, may provide less of an incentive\nfor unemployment than a society that provides less generous help that lasts for several years. Conversely,\ngovernment assistance for job search or retraining can in some cases encourage people back to work sooner.\nSee the Clear it Up to learn how the U.S. handles unemployment insurance.\nCLEAR IT UP\nHow does U.S. unemployment insurance work?\nUnemployment insurance is a joint federal\u2013state program that the federal government enacted in 1935. While the\nfederal government sets minimum standards for the program, state governments conduct most of the\nadministration.\nThe funding for the program is a federal tax collected from employers. The federal government requires tax\ncollection on the first $7,000 in wages paid to each worker; however, states can choose to collect the tax on a higher\namount if they wish, and 41 states have set a higher limit. States can choose the length of time that they pay\nbenefits, although most states limit unemployment benefits to 26 weeks\u2014with extensions possible in times of\nespecially high unemployment. The states then use the fund to pay benefits to those who become unemployed.\nAverage unemployment benefits are equal to about one-third of the wage that the person earned in their previous\njob, but the level of unemployment benefits varies considerably across states.\nBottom 10 States That Pay the Lowest Benefit per Top 10 States That Pay the Highest Benefit per\nWeek Week\nMichigan $362 Washington $929\nNorth Carolina $350 Massachusetts $823\nSouth Carolina $326 Minnesota $740\nMissouri $320 New Jersey $713\nFlorida $275 Connecticut $649\nTennessee $275 Oregon $648\nAlabama $275 Hawaii $648\nLouisiana $275 North Dakota $618\nArizona $240 Colorado $618\nMississippi $235 Rhode Island $586\nTABLE21.5Maximum Weekly Unemployment Benefits by State in 2021(Source: http://www.savingtoinvest.com/\nmaximum-weekly-unemployment-benefits-by-state/)\nOne other interesting thing to note about the classifications of unemployment\u2014an individual does not have to collect\nunemployment benefits to be classified as unemployed. While there are statistics kept and studied relating to how\nmany people are collecting unemployment insurance, this is not the source of unemployment rate information.\nLINK IT UP\nView thisarticle(http://openstax.org/l/NYT_Benefits)for an explanation of exactly who is eligible for\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21.4 \u2022 What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Long Run 521\nunemployment benefits.\nOn the demand side of the labor market, government rules, social institutions, and the presence of unions can\naffect the willingness of firms to hire. For example, if a government makes it hard for businesses to start up or\nto expand, by wrapping new businesses in bureaucratic red tape, then businesses will become more\ndiscouraged about hiring. Government regulations can make it harder to start a business by requiring that a\nnew business obtain many permits and pay many fees, or by restricting the types and quality of products that a\ncompany can sell. Other government regulations, like zoning laws, may limit where companies can conduct\nbusiness, or whether businesses are allowed to be open during evenings or on Sunday.\nWhatever defenses may be offered for such laws in terms of social value\u2014like the value some Christians place\non not working on Sunday, or Orthodox Jews or highly observant Muslims on Saturday\u2014these kinds of\nrestrictions impose a barrier between some willing workers and other willing employers, and thus contribute\nto a higher natural rate of unemployment. Similarly, if government makes it difficult to fire or lay off workers,\nbusinesses may react by trying not to hire more workers than strictly necessary\u2014since laying these workers off\nwould be costly and difficult. High minimum wages may discourage businesses from hiring low-skill workers.\nGovernment rules may encourage and support powerful unions, which can then push up wages for union\nworkers, but at a cost of discouraging businesses from hiring those workers.\nThe Natural Rate of Unemployment in Recent Years\nThe underlying economic, social, and political factors that determine the natural rate of unemployment can\nchange over time, which means that the natural rate of unemployment can change over time, too.\nEstimates by economists of the natural rate of unemployment in the U.S. economy in the early 2000s run at\nabout 4.5 to 5.5%. This is a lower estimate than earlier. We outline three of the common reasons that\neconomists propose for this change below.\n1. The internet has provided a remarkable new tool through which job seekers can find out about jobs at\ndifferent companies and can make contact with relative ease. An internet search is far easier than trying\nto find a list of local employers and then hunting up phone numbers for all of their human resources\ndepartments, and requesting a list of jobs and application forms. Social networking sites such as LinkedIn\nhave changed how people find work as well.\n2. The growth of the temporary worker industry has probably helped to reduce the natural rate of\nunemployment. In the early 1980s, only about 0.5% of all workers held jobs through temp agencies. By the\nearly 2000s, the figure had risen above 2%. Temp agencies can provide jobs for workers while they are\nlooking for permanent work. They can also serve as a clearinghouse, helping workers find out about jobs\nwith certain employers and getting a tryout with the employer. For many workers, a temp job is a stepping-\nstone to a permanent job that they might not have heard about or obtained any other way, so the growth of\ntemp jobs will also tend to reduce frictional unemployment.\n3. The aging of the \u201cbaby boom generation\u201d\u2014the especially large generation of Americans born between\n1946 and 1964\u2014meant that the proportion of young workers in the economy was relatively high in the\n1970s, as the boomers entered the labor market, but is relatively low today. As we noted earlier, middle-\naged and older workers are far more likely to experience low unemployment than younger workers, a\nfactor that tends to reduce the natural rate of unemployment as the baby boomers age.\nThe combined result of these factors is that the natural rate of unemployment was on average lower in the\n1990s and the early 2000s than in the 1980s. The 2008\u20132009 Great Recession pushed monthly unemployment\nrates up to 10% in late 2009. However, even at that time, the Congressional Budget Office was forecasting that\nby 2015, unemployment rates would fall back to about 5%. During the first two months of 2020, the\nunemployment rate held steady at 3.5%. As of the first quarter of 2022, the Congressional Budget Office\nestimates the natural rate to be 4.6%. 522 21 \u2022 Unemployment\nThe Natural Rate of Unemployment in Europe\nBy the standards of other high-income economies, the natural rate of unemployment in the U.S. economy\nappears relatively low. Through good economic years and bad, many European economies have had\nunemployment rates hovering near 10%, or even higher, since the 1970s. European rates of unemployment\nhave been higher not because recessions in Europe have been deeper, but rather because the conditions\nunderlying supply and demand for labor have been different in Europe, in a way that has created a much\nhigher natural rate of unemployment.\nMany European countries have a combination of generous welfare and unemployment benefits, together with\nnests of rules that impose additional costs on businesses when they hire. In addition, many countries have\nlaws that require firms to give workers months of notice before laying them off and to provide substantial\nseverance or retraining packages after laying them off. The legally required notice before laying off a worker\ncan be more than three months in Spain, Germany, Denmark, and Belgium, and the legally required severance\npackage can be as high as a year\u2019s salary or more in Austria, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece. Such laws will\nsurely discourage laying off or firing current workers. However, when companies know that it will be difficult to\nfire or lay off workers, they also become hesitant about hiring in the first place.\nWe can attribute the typically higher levels of unemployment in many European countries in recent years,\nwhich have prevailed even when economies are growing at a solid pace, to the fact that the sorts of laws and\nregulations that lead to a high natural rate of unemployment are much more prevalent in Europe than in the\nUnited States.\nA Preview of Policies to Fight Unemployment\nTheGovernment Budgets and Fiscal PolicyandMacroeconomic Policy Around the Worldchapters provide a\ndetailed discussion of how to fight unemployment, when we can discuss these policies in the context of the full\narray of macroeconomic goals and frameworks for analysis. However, even at this preliminary stage, it is\nuseful to preview the main issues concerning policies to fight unemployment.\nThe remedy for unemployment will depend on the diagnosis. Cyclical unemployment is a short-term problem,\ncaused because the economy is in a recession. Thus, the preferred solution will be to avoid or minimize\nrecessions. AsGovernment Budgets and Fiscal Policydiscusses, governments can enact this policy by\nstimulating the overall buying power in the economy, so that firms perceive that sales and profits are possible,\nwhich makes them eager to hire.\nDealing with the natural rate of unemployment is trickier. In a market-oriented economy, firms will hire and\nfire workers. Governments cannot control this. Furthermore, the evolving age structure of the economy's\npopulation, or unexpected shifts in productivity are beyond a government's control and, will affect the natural\nrate of unemployment for a time. However, as the example of high ongoing unemployment rates for many\nEuropean countries illustrates, government policy clearly can affect the natural rate of unemployment that will\npersist even when GDP is growing.\nWhen a government enacts policies that will affect workers or employers, it must examine how these policies\nwill affect the information and incentives employees and employers have to find one another. For example, the\ngovernment may have a role to play in helping some of the unemployed with job searches. Governments may\nneed to rethink the design of their programs that offer assistance to unemployed workers and protections to\nemployed workers so that they will not unduly discourage the supply of labor. Similarly, governments may\nneed to reassess rules that make it difficult for businesses to begin or to expand so that they will not unduly\ndiscourage the demand for labor. The message is not that governments should repeal all laws affecting labor\nmarkets, but only that when they enact such laws, a society that cares about unemployment will need to\nconsider the tradeoffs involved.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21.4 \u2022 What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Long Run 523\nBRING IT HOME\nUnemployment and the COVID-19 Pandemic\nAlmost two years after the pandemic began, the unemployment rate was on track to go below 4% again by early- to\nmid-2022. While this is great news for workers, we have also seen that the story of the labor market is more\ncomplicated than a single statistic might suggest. Millions remained out of the labor force due to the public health\nsituation, and the percentage of workers unemployed for longer than 26 weeks was still high.\nThe shift to remote work helped the unemployment rate come down by providing greater flexibility for workers\nconcerned with their health and safety. But it didn't help workers, especially women, who continued to be burdened\nwith excessive care responsibilities at home. During 2020, the unemployment rate for women exceeded that of men\nby over a full percentage point. Additionally, virus variants in other countries threatened to disrupt progress made at\nhome and abroad.\nThe pandemic has helped shed light on how we can use information from all areas of the labor market to evaluate\nthe health of the economy. 524 21 \u2022 Key Terms\nKey Terms\nadverse selection of wage cuts argument if employers reduce wages for all workers, the best will leave\ncyclical unemployment unemployment closely tied to the business cycle, like higher unemployment during a\nrecession\ndiscouraged workers those who have stopped looking for employment due to the lack of suitable positions\navailable\nefficiency wage theory the theory that the productivity of workers, either individually or as a group, will\nincrease if the employer pays them more\nfrictional unemployment unemployment that occurs as workers move between jobs\nimplicit contract an unwritten agreement in the labor market that the employer will try to keep wages from\nfalling when the economy is weak or the business is having trouble, and the employee will not expect huge\nsalary increases when the economy or the business is strong\ninsider-outsider model those already working for the firm are \u201cinsiders\u201d who know the procedures; the other\nworkers are \u201coutsiders\u201d who are recent or prospective hires\nlabor force participation rate this is the percentage of adults in an economy who are either employed or who\nare unemployed and looking for a job\nnatural rate of unemployment the unemployment rate that would exist in a growing and healthy economy\nfrom the combination of economic, social, and political factors that exist at a given time\nout of the labor force those who are not working and not looking for work\u2014whether they want employment or\nnot; also termed \u201cnot in the labor force\u201d\nrelative wage coordination argument across-the-board wage cuts are hard for an economy to implement,\nand workers fight against them\nstructural unemployment unemployment that occurs because individuals lack skills valued by employers\nunderemployed individuals who are employed in a job that is below their skills\nunemployment rate the percentage of adults who are in the labor force and thus seeking jobs, but who do not\nhave jobs\nKey Concepts and Summary\n21.1How Economists Define and Compute Unemployment Rate\nUnemployment imposes high costs. Unemployed individuals experience loss of income and stress. An\neconomy with high unemployment suffers an opportunity cost of unused resources. We can divide the adult\npopulation into those in the labor force and those out of the labor force. In turn, we divide those in the labor\nforce into employed and unemployed. A person without a job must be willing and able to work and actively\nlooking for work to be counted as unemployed; otherwise, a person without a job is counted as out of the labor\nforce. Economists define the unemployment rate as the number of unemployed persons divided by the\nnumber of persons in the labor force (not the overall adult population). The Current Population Survey (CPS)\nconducted by the United States Census Bureau measures the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed.\nThe establishment payroll survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics measures the net change in jobs created for\nthe month.\n21.2Patterns of Unemployment\nThe U.S. unemployment rate rises during periods of recession and depression, but falls back to the range of 4%\nto 6% when the economy is strong. The unemployment rate never falls to zero. Despite enormous growth in the\nsize of the U.S. population and labor force in the twentieth century, along with other major trends like\nglobalization and new technology, the unemployment rate shows no long-term rising trend.\nUnemployment rates differ by group: higher for African-Americans and Hispanic people than for White\npeople; higher for less educated than more educated; higher for the young than the middle-aged. Women\u2019s\nunemployment rates used to be higher than men\u2019s, but in recent years men\u2019s and women\u2019s unemployment\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21 \u2022 Self-Check Questions 525\nrates have been very similar. In recent years, unemployment rates in the United States have compared\nfavorably with unemployment rates in most other high-income economies.\n21.3What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Short Run\nCyclical unemployment rises and falls with the business cycle. In a labor market with flexible wages, wages will\nadjust in such a market so that quantity demanded of labor always equals the quantity supplied of labor at the\nequilibrium wage. Economists have proposed many theories for why wages might not be flexible, but instead\nmay adjust only in a \u201csticky\u201d way, especially when it comes to downward adjustments: implicit contracts,\nefficiency wage theory, adverse selection of wage cuts, insider-outsider model, and relative wage coordination.\n21.4What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Long Run\nThe natural rate of unemployment is the rate of unemployment that the economic, social, and political forces\nin the economy would cause even when the economy is not in a recession. These factors include the frictional\nunemployment that occurs when people either choose to change jobs or are put out of work for a time by the\nshifts of a dynamic and changing economy. They also include any laws concerning conditions of hiring and\nfiring that have the undesired side effect of discouraging job formation. They also include structural\nunemployment, which occurs when demand shifts permanently away from a certain type of job skill.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

Using the definition of the unemployment rate, is an increase in the unemployment rate necessarily a bad\nthing for a nation?\n31. Is a decrease in the unemployment rate necessarily a good thing for a nation? Explain.\n32. If many workers become discouraged from looking for jobs, explain how the number of jobs could decline\nbut the unemployment rate could fall at the same time.\n33. Would you expect hidden unemployment to be higher, lower, or about the same when the unemployment\nrate is high, say 10%, versus low, say 4%? Explain.\n34. Is the higher unemployment rates for minority workers necessarily an indication of discrimination? What\ncould be some other reasons for the higher unemployment rate?\n35. While unemployment is highly negatively correlated with the level of economic activity, in the real world it\nresponds with a lag. In other words, firms do not immediately lay off workers in response to a sales\ndecline. They wait a while before responding. Similarly, firms do not immediately hire workers when sales\npick up. What do you think accounts for the lag in response time?\n36. Why do you think that unemployment rates are lower for individuals with more education?\n37. Do you think it is rational for workers to prefer sticky wages to wage cuts, when the consequence of sticky\nwages is unemployment for some workers? Why or why not? How do the reasons for sticky wages\nexplained in this section apply to your argument?\n38. Under what condition would a decrease in unemployment be bad for the economy?\n39. Under what condition would an increase in the unemployment rate be a positive sign?\n40. As the baby boom generation retires, the ratio of retirees to workers will increase noticeably. How will this\naffect the Social Security program? How will this affect the standard of living of the average American?\n41. Unemployment rates have been higher in many European countries in recent decades than in the United\nStates. Is the main reason for this long-term difference in unemployment rates more likely to be cyclical\nunemployment or the natural rate of unemployment? Explain briefly.\n42. Is it desirable to pursue a goal of zero unemployment? Why or why not?\n43. Is it desirable to eliminate natural unemployment? Why or why not?Hint: Think about what our economy\nwould look like today and what assumptions would have to be met to have a zero rate of natural\nunemployment.\n44. The U.S. unemployment rate increased from 4.6% in July 2001 to 5.9% by June 2002.

Inflation is when most prices in\nan entire economy are rising. However, there is an extreme form of inflation called hyperinflation. This occurred in\nGermany between 1921 and 1928, and more recently in Zimbabwe between 2008 and 2009. In November 2008,\nZimbabwe had an inflation rate of 79.6 billion percent. In contrast, in 2014, the United States had an average annual\nrate of inflation of 1.6%. 530 22 \u2022 Inflation\nZimbabwe\u2019s inflation rate was so high it is difficult to comprehend, so let\u2019s put it into context. It is equivalent to price\nincreases of 98% per day. This means that, from one day to the next, prices essentially double. What is life like in an\neconomy afflicted with hyperinflation? Most of you reading this will have never experienced this phenomenon. The\ngovernment adjusted prices for commodities in Zimbabwean dollars several timeseach day. There was no desire to\nhold on to currency since it lost value by the minute. The people there spent a great deal of time getting rid of any\ncash they acquired by purchasing whatever food or other commodities they could find. At one point, a loaf of bread\ncost 550 million Zimbabwean dollars. Teachers' salaries were in the trillions a month; however, this was equivalent\nto only one U.S. dollar a day. At its height, it took 621,984,228 Zimbabwean dollars to purchase one U.S. dollar.\nGovernment agencies had no money to pay their workers so they started printing money to pay their bills rather than\nraising taxes. Rising prices caused the government to enact price controls on private businesses, which led to\nshortages and the emergence of black markets. In 2009, the country abandoned its currency and allowed people to\nuse foreign currencies for purchases.\nHow does this happen? How can both government and the economy fail to function at the most basic level? Before\nwe consider these extreme cases of hyperinflation, let\u2019s first look at inflation itself.\nInflationis a general and ongoing rise in the level of prices in an entire economy. Inflation does not refer to a\nchange in relative prices. A relative price change occurs when you see that the price of tuition has risen, but\nthe price of laptops has fallen. Inflation, on the other hand, means that there is pressure for prices to rise in\nmost markets in the economy. In addition, price increases in the supply-and-demand model were one-time\nevents, representing a shift from a previous equilibrium to a new one. Inflation implies an ongoing rise in\nprices. If inflation happened for one year and then stopped, then it would not be inflation any more.\nThis chapter begins by showing how to combine prices of individual goods and services to create a measure of\noverall inflation. It discusses the historical and recent experience of inflation, both in the United States and in\nother countries around the world. Other chapters have sometimes included a note under an exhibit or a\nparenthetical reminder in the text saying that the numbers have been adjusted for inflation. In this chapter, it\nis time to show how to use inflation statistics to adjust other economic variables, so that you can tell how much\nof, for example, we can attribute the rise in GDP over different periods of time to an actual increase in the\nproduction of goods and services and how much we should attribute to the fact that prices for most items have\nrisen.\nInflation has consequences for people and firms throughout the economy, in their roles as lenders and\nborrowers, wage-earners, taxpayers, and consumers. The chapter concludes with a discussion of some\nimperfections and biases in the inflation statistics, and a preview of policies for fighting inflation that we will\ndiscuss in other chapters.\n22.1Tracking Inflation\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Calculate the annual rate of inflation\n\u2022 Explain and use index numbers and base years when simplifying the total quantity spent over a year for\nproducts\n\u2022 Calculate inflation rates using index numbers\nDinner table conversations where you might have heard about inflation usually entail reminiscing about when\n\u201ceverything seemed to cost so much less. You used to be able to buy three gallons of gasoline for a dollar and\nthen go see an afternoon movie for another dollar.\u201dTable 22.1compares some prices of common goods in\n1970 and 2017. Of course, the average prices in this table may not reflect the prices where you live. The cost of\nliving in New York City is much higher than in Houston, Texas, for example. In addition, certain products have\nevolved over recent decades. A new car in 2021, loaded with antipollution equipment, safety gear,\nAccess for free at openstax.org 22.1 \u2022 Tracking Inflation 531\ncomputerized engine controls, and many other technological advances, is a more advanced machine (and\nmore fuel efficient) than your typical 1970s car. However, put details like these to one side for the moment, and\nlook at the overall pattern. The primary reason behind the price rises inTable 22.1\u2014and all the price increases\nfor the other products in the economy\u2014is not specific to the market for housing or cars or gasoline or movie\ntickets. Instead, it is part of a general rise in the level of all prices. At the beginning of 2021, $1 had about the\nsame purchasing power in overall terms of goods and services as 15 cents did in 1972, because of the amount\nof inflation that has occurred over that time period.\nItems 1970 2021\nPound of ground beef $0.66 $5.96\nPound of butter $0.87 $3.50\nMovie ticket $1.55 $13.70\nSales price of new home (median) $22,000 $408,800\nNew car $3,000 $42,000\nGallon of gasoline $0.36 $3.32\nAverage hourly wage for a manufacturing worker $3.23 $30.11\nPer capita GDP $5,069 $63,543\nTABLE22.1Price Comparisons, 1970 and 2021(Sources: See chapter\nReferences at end of book.)\nMoreover, the power of inflation does not affect just goods and services, butwagesand income levels, too. The\nsecond-to-last row ofTable 22.1shows that the average hourly wage for a manufacturing worker increased\nnearly ten-fold from 1970 to 2021. The average worker in 2021 is better educated and more productive than\nthe average worker in 1970\u2014but not six times more productive.Per capita GDPincreased substantially from\n1970 to 2021, but is the average person in the U.S. economy really more than twelve times better off in just 51\nyears? Not likely.\nA modern economy has millions of goods and services whose prices are continually quivering in the breezes of\nsupply and demand. How can all of these shifts in price attribute to a single inflation rate? As with many\nproblems in economic measurement, the conceptual answer is reasonably straightforward: Economists\ncombine prices of a variety of goods and services into a single price level. The inflation rate is simply the\npercentage change in the price level. Applying the concept, however, involves some practical difficulties.\nThe Price of a Basket of Goods\nTo calculate theprice level, economists begin with the concept of abasket of goods and services, consisting of\nthe different items individuals, businesses, or organizations typically buy. The next step is to look at how the\nprices of those items change over time. In thinking about how to combine individual prices into an overall\nprice level, many people find that their first impulse is to calculate the average of the prices. Such a calculation,\nhowever, could easily be misleading because some products matter more than others.\nChanges in the prices of goods for which people spend a larger share of their incomes will matter more than\nchanges in the prices of goods for which people spend a smaller share of their incomes. For example, an\nincrease of 10% in the rental rate on housing matters more to most people than whether the price of carrots\nrises by 10%. To construct an overall measure of the price level, economists compute a weighted average of the 532 22 \u2022 Inflation\nprices of the items in the basket, where the weights are based on the actual quantities of goods and services\npeople buy. The following Work It Out feature walks you through the steps of calculating the annual rate of\ninflation based on a few products.\nWORK IT OUT\nCalculating an Annual Rate of Inflation\nConsider the simple basket of goods with only three items, represented inTable 22.2. Say that in any given\nmonth, a college student spends money on 20 hamburgers, one bottle of aspirin, and five movies. The table\nprovides prices for these items over four years through each time period (Pd). Prices of some goods in the basket\nmay rise while others fall. In this example, the price of aspirin does not change over the four years, while movies\nincrease in price and hamburgers bounce up and down. The table shows the cost of buying the given basket of\ngoods at the prices prevailing at that time.\nItems Hamburger Aspirin Movies Total Inflation Rate\nQty 20 1 bottle 5 - -\n(Pd 1) Price $3.00 $10.00 $6.00 - -\n(Pd 1) Amount Spent $60.00 $10.00 $30.00 $100.00 -\n(Pd 2) Price $3.20 $10.00 $6.50 - -\n(Pd 2) Amount Spent $64.00 $10.00 $32.50 $106.50 6.5%\n(Pd 3) Price $3.10 $10.00 $7.00 - -\n(Pd 3) Amount Spent $62.00 $10.00 $35.00 $107.00 0.5%\n(Pd 4) Price $3.50 $10.00 $7.50 - -\n(Pd 4) Amount Spent $70.00 $10.00 $37.50 $117.50 9.8%\nTABLE22.2A College Student\u2019s Basket of Goods\nTo calculate the annual rate of inflation in this example:\nStep 1. Find thepercentage changein the cost of purchasing the overall basket of goods between the time\nperiods. The general equation for percentage changes between two years, whether in the context of inflation or\nin any other calculation, is:\nStep 2. From period 1 to period 2, the total cost of purchasing the basket of goods inTable 22.2rises from $100\nto $106.50. Therefore, the percentage change over this time\u2014the inflation rate\u2014is:\nStep 3. From period 2 to period 3, the overall change in the cost of purchasing the basket rises from $106.50 to\n$107. Thus, the inflation rate over this time, again calculated by the percentage change, is approximately:\nAccess for free at openstax.org 22.1 \u2022 Tracking Inflation 533\nStep 4. From period 3 to period 4, the overall cost rises from $107 to $117.50. The inflation rate is thus:\nThis calculation of the change in the total cost of purchasing a basket of goods accounts for how much a student\nspends on each good. Hamburgers are the lowest-priced good in this example, and aspirin is the highest-priced.\nIf an individual buys a greater quantity of a low-price good, then it makes sense that changes in the price of that\ngood should have a larger impact on the buying power of that person\u2019s money. The larger impact of hamburgers\nshows up in the \u201camount spent\u201d row, where, in all time periods, hamburgers are the largest item within the\namount spent row.\nIndex Numbers\nThe numerical results of a calculation based on a basket of goods can get a little messy. The simplified example\ninTable 22.2has only three goods and the prices are in even dollars, not numbers like 79 cents or $124.99. If\nthe list of products were much longer, and we used more realistic prices, the total quantity spent over a year\nmight be some messy-looking number like $17,147.51 or $27,654.92.\nTo simplify the task of interpreting the price levels for more realistic and complex baskets of goods,\neconomists typically report the price level in each period as anindex number, rather than as the dollar\namount for buying the basket of goods. Economists create price indices to calculate an overall average change\nin relative prices over time. To convert the money spent on the basket to an index number, economists\narbitrarily choose one year to be thebase year, or starting point from which we measure changes in prices.\nThe base year, by definition, has an index number equal to 100. This sounds complicated, but it is really a\nsimple math trick. In the example above, say that we choose time period 3 as the base year. Since the total\namount of spending in that year is $107, we divide that amount by itself ($107) and multiply by 100. Again, this\nis because the index number in the base yearalwayshas to have a value of 100. Then, to figure out the values\nof the index number for the other years, we divide the dollar amounts for the other years by 1.07 as well. Note\nalso that the dollar signs cancel out so that index numbers have no units.\nTable 22.3shows calculations for the other values of the index number, based on the example inTable 22.2.\nBecause we calculate the index numbers so that they are in exactly the same proportion as the total dollar cost\nof purchasing the basket of goods, we can calculate the inflation rate based on the index numbers, using the\npercentage change formula. Thus, the inflation rate from period 1 to period 2 would be\nThis is the same answer that we derived when measuring inflation based on the dollar cost of the basket of\ngoods for the same time period.\nTotal Spending Index Number Inflation Rate Since Previous Period\nPeriod 1 $100\nPeriod 2 $106.50\nPeriod 3 $107\nPeriod 4 $117.50\nTABLE22.3Calculating Index Numbers When Period 3 is the Base Year 534 22 \u2022 Inflation\nIf the inflation rate is the same whether it is based on dollar values or index numbers, then why bother with the\nindex numbers? The advantage is that indexing allows easier eyeballing of the inflation numbers. If you glance\nat two index numbers like 107 and 110, you know automatically that the rate of inflation between the two years\nis about, but not quite exactly equal to, 3%. By contrast, imagine that we express the price levels in absolute\ndollars of a large basket of goods, so that when you looked at the data, the numbers were $19,493.62 and\n$20,040.17. Most people find it difficult to eyeball those kinds of numbers and say that it is a change of about\n3%. However, the two numbers expressed in absolute dollars are exactly in the same proportion of 107 to 110\nas the previous example. If you\u2019re wondering why simple subtraction of the index numbers wouldn\u2019t work,\nread the following Clear It Up feature.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhy do you not just subtract index numbers?\nA word of warning: When a price index moves from, say, 107 to 110, the rate of inflation is notexactly3%.\nRemember, the inflation rate is not derived by subtracting the index numbers, but rather through the percentage-\nchange calculation. We calculate the precise inflation rate as the price index moves from 107 to 110 as 100 x (110 \u2013\n107) / 107 = 100 x 0.028 = 2.8%. When the base year is fairly close to 100, a quick subtraction is not a terrible\nshortcut to calculating the inflation rate\u2014but when precision matters down to tenths of a percent, subtracting will\nnot give the right answer.\nTwo final points about index numbers are worth remembering. First, index numbers have no dollar signs or\nother units attached to them. Although we can use index numbers to calculate a percentage inflation rate, the\nindex numbers themselves do not have percentage signs. Index numbers just mirror the proportions that we\nfind in other data. They transform the other data so that it is easier to work with the data.\nSecond, the choice of a base year for the index number\u2014that is, the year that is automatically set equal to\n100\u2014is arbitrary. We choose it as a starting point from which we can track changes in prices. In the official\ninflation statistics, it is common to use one base year for a few years, and then to update it, so that the base\nyear of 100 is relatively close to the present. However, any base year that we choose for the index numbers will\nresult in exactly the same inflation rate. To see this in the previous example, imagine that period 1 is the base\nyear when total spending was $100, and we assign it an index number of 100. At a glance, you can see that the\nindex numbers would now exactly match the dollar figures, and the inflation rate in the first period would be\n6.5%.\nNow that we see how indexes work to track inflation, the next module will show us how economists measure\nthe cost of living.\nLINK IT UP\nWatch thisvideo(http://openstax.org/l/Duck_Tales)from the cartoonDuck Talesto view a mini-lesson on\ninflation.\n22.2How to Measure Changes in the Cost of Living\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Use the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to calculate U.S. inflation rates\n\u2022 Identify several ways the Bureau of Labor Statistics avoids biases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI)\n\u2022 Differentiate among the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Producer Price Index (PPI), the International\nPrice Index, the Employment Cost Index, and the GDP deflator.\nThe most commonly cited measure of inflation in the United States is theConsumer Price Index (CPI).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 22.2 \u2022 How to Measure Changes in the Cost of Living 535\nGovernment statisticians at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics calculate the CPI based on the prices in a fixed\nbasket of goods and services that represents the purchases of the average family of four. In recent years, the\nstatisticians have paid considerable attention to a subtle problem: that the change in the total cost of buying a\nfixed basket of goods and services over time is conceptually not quite the same as the change in thecost of\nliving, because the cost of living represents how much it costs for a person to feel that their consumption\nprovides an equal level of satisfaction or utility.\nTo understand the distinction, imagine that over the past 10 years, the cost of purchasing a fixed basket of\ngoods increased by 25% and your salary also increased by 25%. Has your personal standard of living held\nconstant? If you do not necessarily purchase an identical fixed basket of goods every year, then an inflation\ncalculation based on the cost of a fixed basket of goods may be a misleading measure of how your cost of living\nhas changed. Two problems arise here: substitution bias and quality/new goods bias.\nWhen the price of a good rises, consumers tend to purchase less of it and to seek out substitutes instead.\nConversely, as the price of a good falls, people will tend to purchase more of it. This pattern implies that goods\nwith generally rising prices should tend over time to become less important in the overall basket of goods used\nto calculate inflation, while goods with falling prices should tend to become more important. Consider, as an\nexample, a rise in the price of peaches by $100 per pound. If consumers were utterly inflexible in their\ndemand for peaches, this would lead to a big rise in the price of food for consumers. Alternatively, imagine that\npeople are utterly indifferent to whether they have peaches or other types of fruit. Now, if peach prices rise,\npeople completely switch to other fruit choices and the average price of food does not change at all. A fixed and\nunchanging basket of goods assumes that consumers are locked into buying exactly the same goods,\nregardless of price changes\u2014not a very likely assumption. Thus,substitution bias\u2014the rise in the price of a\nfixed basket of goods over time\u2014tends to overstate the rise in a consumer\u2019s true cost of living, because it does\nnot take into account that the person can substitute away from goods whose relative prices have risen.\nThe other major problem in using a fixed basket of goods as the basis for calculating inflation is how to deal\nwith the arrival of improved versions of older goods or altogether new goods. Consider the problem that arises\nif a cereal is improved by adding 12 essential vitamins and minerals\u2014and also if a box of the cereal costs 5%\nmore. It would clearly be misleading to count the entire resulting higher price as inflation, because the new\nprice reflects a higher quality (or at least different) product. Ideally, one would like to know how much of the\nhigher price is due to the quality change, and how much of it is just a higher price. The Bureau of Labor\nStatistics, which is responsible for computing the Consumer Price Index, must deal with these difficulties in\nadjusting for quality changes.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/Fords)to view a list of Ford car prices between 1909 and 1927.\nConsider how these prices compare to today\u2019s models. Is the product today of a different quality?\nWe can think of a new product as an extreme improvement in quality\u2014from something that did not exist to\nsomething that does. However, the basket of goods that was fixed in the past obviously does not include new\ngoods created since then. The basket of goods and services in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is revised and\nupdated over time, and so new products are gradually included. However, the process takes some time. For\nexample, room air conditioners were widely sold in the early 1950s, but were not introduced into the basket of\ngoods behind the Consumer Price Index until 1964. The VCR and personal computer were available in the late\n1970s and widely sold by the early 1980s, but did not enter the CPI basket of goods until 1987. By 1996, there\nwere more than 40 million cellular phone subscribers in the United States\u2014but cell phones were not yet part of\nthe CPI basket of goods. The parade of inventions has continued, with the CPI inevitably lagging a few years\nbehind.\nThe arrival of new goods creates problems with respect to the accuracy of measuring inflation. The reason 536 22 \u2022 Inflation\npeople buy new goods, presumably, is that the new goods offer better value for money than existing goods.\nThus, if the price index leaves out new goods, it overlooks one of the ways in which the cost of living is\nimproving. In addition, the price of a new good is often higher when it is first introduced and then declines\nover time. If the new good is not included in the CPI for some years, until its price is already lower, the CPI may\nmiss counting this price decline altogether. Taking these arguments together, thequality/new goods bias\nmeans that the rise in the price of a fixed basket of goods over time tends to overstate the rise in a consumer\u2019s\ntrue cost of living, because it does not account for how improvements in the quality of existing goods or the\ninvention of new goods improves the standard of living. The following Clear It Up feature is a must-read on\nhow statisticians comprise and calculate the CPI.\nCLEAR IT UP\nHow do U.S. government statisticians measure the Consumer Price Index?\nWhen the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calculates the Consumer Price Index, the first task is to decide on a\nbasket of goods that is representative of the purchases of the average household. We do this by using the Consumer\nExpenditure Survey, a national survey of about 7,000 households, which provides detailed information on spending\nhabits. Statisticians divide consumer expenditures into eight major groups (seen below), which in turn they divide\ninto more than 200 individual item categories. The BLS currently uses 1982\u20131984 as the base period.\nFor each of the 200 individual expenditure items, the BLS chooses several hundred very specific examples of that\nitem and looks at the prices of those examples. In figuring out the \u201cbreakfast cereal\u201d item under the overall category\nof \u201cfoods and beverages,\u201d the BLS picks several hundred examples of breakfast cereal. One example might be the\nprice of a 24-oz. box of a particular brand of cereal sold at a particular store. The BLS statistically selects specific\nproducts and sizes and stores to reflect what people buy and where they shop. The basket of goods in the Consumer\nPrice Index thus consists of about 80,000 products; that is, several hundred specific products in over 200 broad-\nitem categories. Statisticians rotate about one-quarter of these 80,000 specific products of the sample each year,\nand replace them with a different set of products.\nThe next step is to collect data on prices. Data collectors visit or call about 23,000 stores in 87 urban areas all over\nthe United States every month to collect prices on these 80,000 specific products. The BLS also conducts a survey\nof 50,000 landlords or tenants to collect information about rents.\nStatisticians then calculate the Consumer Price Index by taking the 80,000 prices of individual products and\ncombining them, using weights (seeFigure 22.2) determined by the quantities of these products that people buy\nand allowing for factors like substitution between goods and quality improvements, into price indices for the 200 or\nso overall items. Then, the statisticians combine the price indices for the 200 items into an overall Consumer Price\nIndex. According the Consumer Price Index website, there are eight categories that data collectors use:\nThe Eight Major Categories in the Consumer Price Index\n1. Food and beverages (breakfast cereal, milk, coffee, chicken, wine, full-service meals, and snacks)\n2. Housing (renter\u2019s cost of housing, homeowner\u2019s cost of housing, fuel oil, bedroom furniture)\n3. Apparel (men\u2019s shirts and sweaters, women\u2019s dresses, jewelry)\n4. Transportation (new vehicles, airline fares, gasoline, motor vehicle insurance)\n5. Medical care (prescription drugs and medical supplies, physicians\u2019 services, eyeglasses and eye care, hospital\nservices)\n6.

The next highest category, food and beverage at 15.1%, is less than half the\nsize of housing. Other goods and services, and apparel, are the lowest at 3.2% and 2.7%, respectively. (Source:\nwww.bls.gov/cpi)\nThe CPI and Core Inflation Index\nImagine if you were driving a company truck across the country- you probably would care about things like the\nprices of available roadside food and motel rooms as well as the truck\u2019s operating condition. However, the\nmanager of the firm might have different priorities. He would care mostly about the truck\u2019s on-time\nperformance and much less so about the food you were eating and the places you were staying. In other words,\nthe company manager would be paying attention to the firm's production, while ignoring transitory elements\nthat impacted you, but did not affect the company\u2019s bottom line.\nIn a sense, a similar situation occurs with regard to measures of inflation. As we\u2019ve learned, CPI measures\nprices as they affect everyday household spending. Economists typically calculate acore inflation indexby\ntaking the CPI and excluding volatile economic variables. In this way, economists have a better sense of the\nunderlying trends in prices that affect the cost of living.\nExamples of excluded variables include energy and food prices, which can jump around from month to month\nbecause of the weather. According to an article by Kent Bernhard, during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, a key\nsupply point for the nation\u2019s gasoline was nearly knocked out. Gas prices quickly shot up across the nation, in\nsome places by up to 40 cents a gallon in one day. This was not the cause of an economic policy but rather a\nshort-lived event until the pumps were restored in the region. In this case, the CPI that month would register\nthe change as a cost of living event to households, but the core inflation index would remain unchanged. As a\nresult, the Federal Reserve\u2019s decisions on interest rates would not be influenced. Similarly, droughts can cause\nworld-wide spikes in food prices that, if temporary, do not affect the nation\u2019s economic capability.\nAs former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke noted in 1999 about the core inflation index, \u201cIt\nprovide(s) a better guide to monetary policy than the other indices, since it measures the more persistent\nunderlying inflation rather than transitory influences on the price level.\u201d Bernanke also noted that it helps\ncommunicate that the Federal Reserve does not need to respond to every inflationary shock since some price\nchanges are transitory and not part of a structural change in the economy.\nIn sum, both the CPI and the core inflation index are important, but serve different audiences. The CPI helps\nhouseholds understand their overall cost of living from month to month, while the core inflation index is a\npreferred gauge from which to make important government policy changes. 538 22 \u2022 Inflation\nPractical Solutions for the Substitution and the Quality/New Goods Biases\nBy the early 2000s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics was using alternative mathematical methods for calculating\nthe Consumer Price Index, more complicated than just adding up the cost of a fixed basket of goods, to allow\nfor some substitution between goods. It was also updating the basket of goods behind the CPI more frequently,\nso that it could include new and improved goods more rapidly. For certain products, the BLS was carrying out\nstudies to try to measure the quality improvement. For example, with computers, an economic study can try to\nadjust for changes in speed, memory, screen size, and other product characteristics, and then calculate the\nchange in price after accounting for these product changes. However, these adjustments are inevitably\nimperfect, and exactly how to make these adjustments is often a source of controversy among professional\neconomists.\nBy the early 2000s, the substitution bias and quality/new goods bias had been somewhat reduced, so that since\nthen the rise in the CPI probably overstates the true rise in inflation by only about 0.5% per year. Over one or a\nfew years, this is not much. Over a period of a decade or two, even half of a percent per year compounds to a\nmore significant amount. In addition, the CPI tracks prices from physical locations, and not at online sites like\nAmazon, where prices can be lower.\nWhen measuring inflation (and other economic statistics, too), a tradeoff arises between simplicity and\ninterpretation. If we calculate the inflation rate with a basket of goods that is fixed and unchanging, then the\ncalculation of an inflation rate is straightforward, but the problems of substitution bias and quality/new goods\nbias will arise. However, when the basket of goods is allowed to shift and evolve to reflect substitution toward\nlower relative prices, quality improvements, and new goods, the technical details of calculating the inflation\nrate grow more complex.\nAdditional Price Indices: PPI, GDP Deflator, and More\nThe basket of goods behind the Consumer Price Index represents an average hypothetical U.S. household's\nconsumption, which is to say that it does not exactly capture anyone\u2019s personal experience. When the task is to\ncalculate an average level of inflation, this approach works fine. What if, however, you are concerned about\ninflation experienced by a certain group, like the elderly, or the poor, or single-parent families with children, or\nHispanic-Americans? In specific situations, a price index based on the buying power of the average consumer\nmay not feel quite right.\nThis problem has a straightforward solution. If the Consumer Price Index does not serve the desired purpose,\nthen invent another index, based on a basket of goods appropriate for the group of interest. The Bureau of\nLabor Statistics publishes a number of experimental price indices: some for particular groups like the elderly\nor the poor, some for different geographic areas, and some for certain broad categories of goods like food or\nhousing.\nThe BLS also calculates several price indices that are not based on baskets of consumer goods. For example,\ntheProducer Price Index (PPI)is based on prices paid for supplies and inputs by producers of goods and\nservices. We can break it down into price indices for different industries, commodities, and stages of\nprocessing (like finished goods, intermediate goods, or crude materials for further processing). There is an\nInternational Price Indexbased on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported. AnEmployment\nCost Indexmeasures wage inflation in the labor market. TheGDP deflator, which the Bureau of Economic\nAnalysis measures, is a price index that includes all the GDP components (that is, consumption plus\ninvestment plus government plus exports minus imports). Unlike the CPI, its baskets are not fixed but re-\ncalculate what that year\u2019s GDP would have been worth using the base-year\u2019s prices. MIT's Billion Prices Project\nis a more recent alternative attempt to measure prices: economists collect data online from retailers and then\nput them into an index that they compare to the CPI (Source: http://bpp.mit.edu/usa/).\nWhat\u2019s the best measure of inflation? If one is concerned with the most accurate measure of inflation, one\nshould use the GDP deflator as it picks up the prices of goods and services produced. However, it is not a good\nAccess for free at openstax.org 22.3 \u2022 How the U.S. and Other Countries Experience Inflation 539\nmeasure of the cost of living as it includes prices of many products not purchased by households (for example,\naircraft, fire engines, factory buildings, office complexes, and bulldozers). If one wants the most accurate\nmeasure of inflation as it impacts households, one should use the CPI, as it only picks up prices of products\npurchased by households. That is why economists sometimes refer to the CPI as the cost-of-living index. As the\nBureau of Labor Statistics states on its website: \u201cThe \u2018best\u2019 measure of inflation for a given application depends\non the intended use of the data.\u201d\n22.3How the U.S. and Other Countries Experience Inflation\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Identify patterns of inflation for the United States using data from the Consumer Price Index\n\u2022 Identify patterns of inflation on an international level\nIn the last three decades, inflation has been relatively low in the U.S. economy, with the Consumer Price Index\ntypically rising 2% to 4% per year. Looking back over the twentieth century, there have been several periods\nwhere inflation caused the price level to rise at double-digit rates, but nothing has come close to\nhyperinflation.\nHistorical Inflation in the U.S. Economy\nFigure 22.3(a) shows the level of prices in the Consumer Price Index stretching back to 1913. In this case, the\nbase years (when the CPI is defined as 100) are set for the average level of prices that existed from 1982 to\n1984.Figure 22.3(b) shows the annual percentage changes in the CPI over time, which is the inflation rate.\nFIGURE22.3U.S. Price Level and Inflation Rates since 1947Graph a shows the trends in the U.S. price level from\nthe year 1947 to 2020. In 1947, the graph starts out close to 22. It gradually increases until about 1973, then\nincreases more rapidly through the remainder of the 1970s and beyond, with periodic dips, until 2020, when it\nreached around 260. Graph b shows the trends in U.S. inflation rates from the year 1948 to 2020. In 1948, the\ngraph starts out with inflation at almost 7%, goes up and down periodically, with peaks in the 1940s and the 1970s,\nuntil settling to around 1.2% in 2020.\nClick to view content(https://openstax.org/books/principles-economics-3e/pages/22-3-how-the-us-and-other-\ncountries-experience-inflation) 540 22 \u2022 Inflation\nInflation as measured by the consumer price index reflects the annual percentage change in the cost to the\naverage consumer of acquiring a basket of goods and services that may be fixed or changed at specified\nintervals, such as yearly.\nThe first two waves of inflation are easy to characterize in historical terms: they are right after World War I and\nWorld War II. However, there are also two periods of severe negative inflation\u2014calleddeflation\u2014in the early\ndecades of the twentieth century: one following the deep 1920-21 recession and the other during the Great\nDepression of the 1930s. (Since inflation is a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and\nservices is reduced, deflation will be a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services\nincreases.) For the period from 1900 to about 1960, the major inflations and deflations nearly balanced each\nother out, so the average annual rate of inflation over these years was only about 1% per year. A third wave of\nmore severe inflation arrived in the 1970s and departed in the early 1980s.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/CPI_calculator)to use an inflation calculator and discover how prices\nhave changed in the last 100 years.\nTimes of recession or depression often seem to be times when the inflation rate is lower, as in the recession of\n1920\u20131921, the Great Depression, the recession of 1980\u20131982, and theGreat Recessionin 2008\u20132009. There\nwere a few months in 2009 that were deflationary, but not at an annual rate. High levels of unemployment\ntypically accompany recessions, and the total demand for goods falls, pulling the price level down. Conversely,\nthe rate of inflation often, but not always, seems to start moving up when the economy is growing very strongly,\nlike right after wartime or during the 1960s. The frameworks for macroeconomic analysis, that we developed\nin other chapters, will explain why recession often accompanies higher unemployment and lower inflation,\nwhile rapid economic growth often brings lower unemployment but higher inflation.\nInflation around the World\nAround the rest of the world, the pattern of inflation has been very mixed;Figure 22.4shows inflation rates\nover the last several decades. Many industrialized countries, not just the United States, had relatively high\ninflation rates in the 1970s. For example, in 1975, Japan\u2019s inflation rate was over 8% and the inflation rate for\nthe United Kingdom was almost 25%. In the 1980s, inflation rates came down in the United States and in\nEurope and have largely stayed down.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 22.3 \u2022 How the U.S. and Other Countries Experience Inflation 541\nFIGURE22.4Countries with Relatively Low Inflation Rates, 1961\u20132020This chart shows the annual percentage\nchange in consumer prices compared with the previous year\u2019s consumer prices in the United States, the United\nKingdom, Japan, and Germany.\nCountries with controlled economies in the 1970s, like the Soviet Union and China, historically had very low\nrates of measured inflation\u2014because prices were forbidden to rise by law, except for the cases where the\ngovernment deemed a price increase to be due to quality improvements. However, these countries also had\nperpetual shortages of goods, since forbidding prices to rise acts like a price ceiling and creates a situation\nwhere quantity demanded often exceeds quantity supplied. As Russia and China made a transition toward\nmore market-oriented economies, they also experienced outbursts of inflation, although we should regard the\nstatistics for these economies as somewhat shakier. Inflation in China averaged about 10% per year for much\nof the 1980s and early 1990s, although it has dropped off since then. Russia experiencedhyperinflation\u2014an\noutburst of high inflation\u2014of 2,500% per year in the early 1990s, although by 2006 Russia\u2019s consumer price\ninflation had dipped below 10% per year, asFigure 22.5shows. The closest the United States has ever reached\nhyperinflation was during the 1860\u20131865 Civil War, in the Confederate states. 542 22 \u2022 Inflation\nFIGURE22.5Countries with Relatively High Inflation Rates, 1981\u20132020These charts show the percentage change\nin consumer prices compared with the previous year\u2019s consumer prices in Brazil, China, and Russia.

In 1990, for example, both Brazil and Argentina saw inflation climb\nabove 2000%. Certain countries in Africa experienced extremely high rates of inflation, sometimes bordering\non hyperinflation, in the 1990s. Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, had an inflation rate of 75% in\n1995.\nIn the early 2000s, the problem of inflation appears to have diminished for most countries, at least in\ncomparison to the worst times of recent decades. As we noted in this earlier Bring it Home feature, in recent\nyears, the world\u2019s worst example of hyperinflation was in Zimbabwe, where at one point the government was\nissuing bills with a face value of $100 trillion (in Zimbabwean dollars)\u2014that is, the bills had\n$100,000,000,000,000 written on the front, but were almost worthless. In many countries, the memory of\ndouble-digit, triple-digit, and even quadruple-digit inflation is not very far in the past.\n22.4The Confusion Over Inflation\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain how inflation can cause redistributions of purchasing power\n\u2022 Identify ways inflation can blur the perception of supply and demand\n\u2022 Explain the economic benefits and challenges of inflation\nEconomists usually oppose high inflation, but they oppose it in a milder way than many non-economists.\nRobert Shiller, one of 2013\u2019s Nobel Prize winners in economics, carried out several surveys during the 1990s\nabout attitudes toward inflation. One of his questions asked, \u201cDo you agree that preventing high inflation is an\nimportant national priority, as important as preventing drug use or preventing deterioration in the quality of\nour schools?\u201d Answers were on a scale of 1\u20135, where 1 meant \u201cFully agree\u201d and 5 meant \u201cCompletely\ndisagree.\u201d For the U.S. population as a whole, 52% answered \u201cFully agree\u201d that preventing high inflation was a\nhighly important national priority and just 4% said \u201cCompletely disagree.\u201d However, among professional\neconomists, only 18% answered \u201cFully agree,\u201d while the same percentage of 18% answered \u201cCompletely\ndisagree.\u201d\nThe Land of Funny Money\nWhat are the economic problems caused by inflation, and why do economists often regard them with less\nconcern than the general public? Consider a very short story: \u201cThe Land of Funny Money.\u201d\nOne morning, everyone in the Land of Funny Money awakened to find that everything denominated in money\nhad increased by 20%. The change was completely unexpected. Every price in every store was 20% higher.\nPaychecks were 20% higher. Interest rates were 20 % higher. The amount of money, everywhere from wallets\nto savings accounts, was 20% larger. This overnight inflation of prices made newspaper headlines everywhere\nin the Land of Funny Money. However, the headlines quickly disappeared, as people realized that in terms of\nwhat they could actually buy with their incomes, this inflation had no economic impact. Everyone\u2019s pay could\nstill buy exactly the same set of goods as it did before. Everyone\u2019s savings were still sufficient to buy exactly the\nsame car, vacation, or retirement that they could have bought before. Equal levels of inflation in all wages and\nprices ended up not mattering much at all.\nWhen the people in Robert Shiller\u2019s surveys explained their concern about inflation, one typical reason was\nthat they feared that as prices rose, they would not be able to afford to buy as much. In other words, people\nwere worried because they did not live in a place like the Land of Funny Money, where all prices and wages\nrose simultaneously. Instead, people live here on Planet Earth, where prices might rise while wages do not rise\nat all, or where wages rise more slowly than prices.\nEconomists note that over most periods, the inflation level in prices is roughly similar to the inflation level in\nwages, and so they reason that, on average, over time, people\u2019s economic status is not greatly changed by 544 22 \u2022 Inflation\ninflation. If all prices, wages, and interest rates adjusted automatically and immediately with inflation, as in the\nLand of Funny Money, then no one\u2019s purchasing power, profits, or real loan payments would change. However,\nif other economic variables do not move exactly in sync with inflation, or if they adjust for inflation only after a\ntime lag, then inflation can cause three types of problems: unintendedredistributionsof purchasing power,\nblurred price signals, and difficulties in long-term planning.\nUnintended Redistributions of Purchasing Power\nInflation can cause redistributions of purchasing power that hurt some and help others. People who are hurt\nby inflation include those who are holding considerable cash, whether it is in a safe deposit box or in a\ncardboard box under the bed. When inflation happens, the buying power of cash diminishes. However, cash is\nonly an example of a more general problem: anyone who has financial assets invested in a way that the\nnominal return does not keep up with inflation will tend to be affected by inflation. For example, if a person\nhas money in a bank account that pays 4% interest, but inflation rises to 5%, then the real rate of return for the\nmoney invested in that bank account is negative 1%.\nThe problem of a good-lookingnominal interest ratetransforming into an ugly-lookingreal interest ratecan\nbe worsened by taxes. The U.S. income tax is charged on the nominal interest received in dollar terms, without\nan adjustment for inflation. Thus, the government taxes a person who invests $10,000 and receives a 5%\nnominal rate of interest on the $500 received\u2014no matter whether the inflation rate is 0%, 5%, or 10%. If\ninflation is 0%, then the real interest rate is 5% and all $500 is a gain in buying power. However, if inflation is\n5%, then the real interest rate is zero and the person had no real gain\u2014but owes income tax on the nominal\ngain anyway. If inflation is 10%, then the real interest rate isnegative5% and the person is actually falling\nbehind in buying power, but would still owe taxes on the $500 in nominal gains.\nInflation can cause unintended redistributions for wage earners, too. Wages do typically creep up with inflation\nover time, eventually. The last row ofTable 22.1at the start of this chapter showed that the average hourly\nwage in manufacturing in the U.S. economy increased from $3.23 in 1970 to $30.11 in 2021, which is an\nincrease by a factor of close to ten. Over that time period, the Consumer Price Index increased by about a\nfactor of eight. However, increases in wages may lag behind inflation for a year or two, since wage adjustments\nare often somewhat sticky and occur only once or twice a year. Moreover, the extent to which wages keep up\nwith inflation creates insecurity for workers and may involve painful, prolonged conflicts between employers\nand employees. If the government adjustsminimum wagefor inflation only infrequently, minimum wage\nworkers are losing purchasing power from their nominal wages, asFigure 22.6shows.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 22.4 \u2022 The Confusion Over Inflation 545\nFIGURE22.6U.S. Minimum Wage and InflationAfter adjusting for inflation, the federal minimum wage dropped\nabout 30 percent from 1965\u20132020, even though the nominal figure climbed from $1.40 to $7.25 per hour.\nIncreases in the minimum wage in between 2008 and 2010 kept the decline from being worse\u2014as it would have\nbeen if the wage had remained the same as it did from 1997 through 2007. Since 2010, the real minimum wage has\ncontinued to decline. (Sources: http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/chart.htm and http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/\nsurveymost?cu)\nOne sizable group of people has often received a large share of their income in a form that does not increase\nover time: retirees who receive a private company pension. Mostpensionshave traditionally been set as a fixed\nnominal dollar amount per year at retirement. For this reason, economists call pensions \u201cdefined benefits\u201d\nplans. Even if inflation is low, the combination of inflation and a fixed income can create a substantial problem\nover time. A person who retires on a fixed income at age 65 will find that losing just 1% to 2% of buying power\nper year to inflation compounds to a considerable loss of buying power after a decade or two.\nFortunately, pensions and other defined benefits retirement plans are increasingly rare, replaced instead by\n\u201cdefined contribution\u201d plans, such as 401(k)s and 403(b)s. In these plans, the employer contributes a fixed\namount to the worker\u2019s retirement account on a regular basis (usually every pay check). The employee often\ncontributes as well. The worker invests these funds in a wide range of investment vehicles. These plans are tax\ndeferred, and they are portable so that if the individual takes a job with a different employer, their401(k)\ncomes with them. To the extent that the investments made generate real rates of return, retirees are not\nburdened by the inflation costs of traditional pensioners.\nHowever, ordinary people can sometimes benefit from the unintended redistributions of inflation. Consider\nsomeone who borrows $10,000 to buy a car at a fixed interest rate of 9%. If inflation is 3% at the time the loan\nis made, then the borrower must repay the loan at a real interest rate of 6%. However, if inflation rises to 9%,\nthen the real interest rate on the loan is zero. In this case, the borrower\u2019s benefit from inflation is the lender\u2019s\nloss. A borrower paying a fixed interest rate, who benefits from inflation, is just the flip side of an investor\nreceiving a fixed interest rate, who suffers from inflation. The lesson is that when interest rates are fixed, rises\nin the rate of inflation tend to penalize suppliers of financial capital, who receive repayment in dollars that are 546 22 \u2022 Inflation\nworth less because of inflation, while demanders of financial capital end up better off, because they can repay\ntheir loans in dollars that are worth less than originally expected.\nThe unintended redistributions of buying power that inflation causes may have a broader effect on society.\nAmerica\u2019s widespread acceptance of market forces rests on a perception that people\u2019s actions have a\nreasonable connection to market outcomes. When inflation causes a retiree who built up a pension or invested\nat a fixed interest rate to suffer, however, while someone who borrowed at a fixed interest rate benefits from\ninflation, it is hard to believe that this outcome was deserved in any way. Similarly, when homeowners benefit\nfrom inflation because the price of their homes rises, while renters suffer because they are paying higher rent,\nit is hard to see any useful incentive effects. One of the reasons that the general public dislikes inflation is a\nsense that it makes economic rewards and penalties more arbitrary\u2014and therefore likely to be perceived as\nunfair \u2013 even dangerous, as the next Clear It Up feature shows.\nCLEAR IT UP\nIs there a connection between German hyperinflation and Hitler\u2019s rise to power?\nGermany suffered an intense hyperinflation of its currency, the Mark, in the years after World War I, when the\nWeimar Republic in Germany resorted to printing money to pay its bills and the onset of the Great Depression\ncreated the social turmoil that Adolf Hitler was able to take advantage of in his rise to power. Shiller described the\nconnection this way in a National Bureau of Economic Research 1996 Working Paper:\nA fact that is probably little known to young people today, even in Germany, is that the final collapse of the\nMark in 1923, the time when the Mark\u2019s inflation reached astronomical levels (inflation of 35,974.9% in\nNovember 1923 alone, for an annual rate that month of 4.69 \u00d7 1028%), came in the same month as did\nHitler\u2019s Beer Hall Putsch, his Nazi Party\u2019s armed attempt to overthrow the German government. This failed\nputsch resulted in Hitler\u2019s imprisonment, at which time he wrote his bookMein Kampf, setting forth an\ninspirational plan for Germany\u2019s future, suggesting plans for world domination. . .\n. . . Most people in Germany today probably do not clearly remember these events; this lack of attention to\nit may be because its memory is blurred by the more dramatic events that succeeded it (the Nazi seizure of\npower and World War II). However, to someone living through these historical events in sequence . . . [the\nputsch] may have been remembered as vivid evidence of the potential effects of inflation.\nBlurred Price Signals\nPrices are the messengers in amarket economy, conveying information about conditions of demand and\nsupply. Inflation blurs those price messages. Inflation means that we perceive price signals more vaguely, like\na radio program received with considerable static. If the static becomes severe, it is hard to tell what is\nhappening.\nIn Israel, when inflation accelerated to an annual rate of 500% in 1985, some stores stopped posting prices\ndirectly on items, since they would have had to put new labels on the items or shelves every few days to reflect\ninflation. Instead, a shopper just took items from a shelf and went up to the checkout register to find out the\nprice for that day. Obviously, this situation makes comparing prices and shopping for the best deal rather\ndifficult. When the levels and changes of prices become uncertain, businesses and individuals find it harder to\nreact to economic signals. In a world where inflation is at a high rate, but bouncing up and down to some\nextent, does a higher price of a good mean that inflation has risen, or that supply of that good has decreased, or\nthat demand for that good has increased? Should a buyer of the good take the higher prices as an economic\nhint to start substituting other products\u2014or have the prices of the substitutes risen by an equal amount?\nShould a seller of the good take a higher price as a reason to increase production\u2014or is the higher price only a\nsign of a general inflation in which the prices of all inputs to production are rising as well? The true story will\npresumably become clear over time, but at a given moment, who can say?\nAccess for free at openstax.org 22.4 \u2022 The Confusion Over Inflation 547\nHigh and variable inflation means that the incentives in the economy to adjust in response to changes in prices\nare weaker. Markets will adjust toward their equilibrium prices and quantities more erratically and slowly, and\nmany individual markets will experience a greater chance ofsurplusesandshortages.\nProblems of Long-Term Planning\nInflation can make long-term planning difficult. In discussing unintendedredistributions, we considered the\ncase of someone trying to plan for retirement with a pension that is fixed in nominal terms and a high rate of\ninflation. Similar problems arise for all people trying to save for retirement, because they must consider what\ntheir money will really buy several decades in the future when we cannot know the rate of future inflation.\nInflation, especially at moderate or high levels, will pose substantial planning problems for businesses, too. A\nfirm can make money from inflation\u2014for example, by paying bills and wages as late as possible so that it can\npay in inflated dollars, while collecting revenues as soon as possible. A firm can also suffer losses from\ninflation, as in the case of a retail business that gets stuck holding too much cash, only to see inflation eroding\nthe value of that cash. However, when a business spends its time focusing on how to profit by inflation, or at\nleast how to avoid suffering from it, an inevitable tradeoff strikes: less time is spent on improving products and\nservices or on figuring out how to make existing products and services more cheaply. An economy with high\ninflation rewards businesses that have found clever ways of profiting from inflation, which are not necessarily\nthe businesses that excel at productivity, innovation, or quality of service.\nIn the short term, low or moderate levels of inflation may not pose an overwhelming difficulty for business\nplanning, because costs of doing business and sales revenues may rise at similar rates. If, however, inflation\nvaries substantially over the short or medium term, then it may make sense for businesses to stick to shorter-\nterm strategies. The evidence as to whether relatively low rates of inflation reduce productivity is controversial\namong economists. There is some evidence that if inflation can be held to moderate levels of less than 3% per\nyear, it need not prevent a nation\u2019s real economy from growing at a healthy pace. For some countries that have\nexperienced hyperinflation of several thousand percent per year, an annual inflation rate of 20\u201330% may feel\nbasically the same as zero. However, several economists have pointed to the suggestive fact that when U.S.\ninflation heated up in the early 1970s\u2014to 10%\u2014U.S. growth in productivity slowed down, and when inflation\nslowed down in the 1980s, productivity edged up again not long thereafter, asFigure 22.7shows.\nFIGURE22.7U.S. Inflation Rate and U.S. Labor Productivity, 1961\u20132020Over the last several decades in the United\nStates, there have been times when rising inflation rates have been closely followed by lower productivity rates and\nlower inflation rates have corresponded to increasing productivity rates. As the graph shows, however, this\ncorrelation does not always exist. 548 22 \u2022 Inflation\nAny Benefits of Inflation?\nAlthough the economic effects of inflation are primarily negative, two countervailing points are worth noting.\nFirst, the impact of inflation will differ considerably according to whether it is creeping up slowly at 0% to 2%\nper year, galloping along at 10% to 20% per year, or racing to the point of hyperinflation at, say, 40% per\nmonth. Hyperinflation can rip an economy and a society apart. An annual inflation rate of 2%, 3%, or 4%,\nhowever, is a long way from a national crisis. Low inflation is also better than deflation which occurs with\nsevere recessions.\nSecond, economists sometimes argue that moderate inflation may help the economy by making wages inlabor\nmarketsmore flexible. The discussion inUnemploymentpointed out that wages tend to be sticky in their\ndownward movements and that unemployment can result. A little inflation could nibble away at real wages,\nand thus help real wages to decline if necessary. In this way, even if a moderate or high rate of inflation may act\nas sand in the gears of the economy, perhaps a low rate of inflation serves as oil for the gears of the labor\nmarket. This argument is controversial. A full analysis would have to account for all the effects of inflation. It\ndoes, however, offer another reason to believe that, all things considered, very low rates of inflation may not be\nespecially harmful.\n22.5Indexing and Its Limitations\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain the relationship between indexing and inflation\n\u2022 Identify three ways the government can control inflation through macroeconomic policy\nWhen a price, wage, or interest rate is adjusted automatically with inflation, economists use the termindexed.\nAn indexed payment increases according to the index number that measures inflation. Those inprivate\nmarketsand government programs observe a wide range of indexing arrangements. Since the negative effects\nof inflation depend in large part on having inflation unexpectedly affect one part of the economy but not\nanother\u2014say, increasing the prices that people pay but not the wages that workers receive\u2014indexing will take\nsome of the sting out of inflation.\nIndexing in Private Markets\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, labor unions commonly negotiated wage contracts that hadcost-of-living\nadjustments (COLAs)which guaranteed that their wages would keep up with inflation. These contracts were\nsometimes written as, for example, COLA plus 3%. Thus, if inflation was 5%, the wage increase would\nautomatically be 8%, but if inflation rose to 9%, the wage increase would automatically be 12%. COLAs are a\nform of indexing applied to wages.\nLoans often have built-in inflation adjustments, too, so that if the inflation rate rises by two percentage points,\nthen the interest rate that a financial institution charges on the loan rises by two percentage points as well. An\nadjustable-rate mortgage (ARM)is a type of loan that one can use to purchase a home in which the interest\nrate varies with the rate of inflation. Often, a borrower will be able to receive a lower interest rate if borrowing\nwith an ARM, compared to a fixed-rate loan. The reason is that with an ARM, the lender is protected against the\nrisk that higher inflation will reduce the real loan payments, and so the risk premium part of the interest rate\ncan be correspondingly lower.\nA number of ongoing or long-term business contracts also have provisions that prices will adjust automatically\naccording to inflation. Sellers like such contracts because they are not locked into a low nominal selling price if\ninflation turns out higher than expected. Buyers like such contracts because they are not locked into a high\nbuying price if inflation turns out to be lower than expected. A contract with automatic adjustments for\ninflation in effect agrees on a real price for the borrower to pay, rather than a nominal price.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 22.5 \u2022 Indexing and Its Limitations 549\nIndexing in Government Programs\nMany government programs are indexed to inflation. The U.S. income tax code is designed so that as a person\u2019s\nincome rises above certain levels, the tax rate on the marginal income earned rises as well. That is what the\nexpression \u201cmove into a higher tax bracket\u201d means. For example, according to the basic tax tables from the\nInternal Revenue Service, in 2020, a married person filing jointly owed 10% of all taxable income from $0 to\n$19,750; 12% of all income from $19,751 to $80,250; 22% of all taxable income from $80,251 to $171,050;\n24% of all taxable income from $171,051 to $326,600; 32% of all taxable income from $326,601 to $414,700;\n35% of all taxable income from $414,701 to $622,050; and 37% of all income from $622,051 and above.\nBecause of the many complex provisions in the rest of the tax code, it is difficult to determine exactly the taxes\nan individual owes the government based on these numbers, but the numbers illustrate the basic theme that\ntax rates rise as the marginal dollar of income rises. Until the late 1970s, if nominal wages increased along\nwith inflation, people were moved into higher tax brackets and owed a higher proportion of their income in\ntaxes, even though their real income had not risen. In 1981, the government eliminated this \u201cbracket creep\u201d.\nNow, the income levels where higher tax rates kick in are indexed to rise automatically with inflation.\nThe Social Security program offers two examples of indexing. Since the passage of theSocial Security Indexing\nAct of 1972, the level of Social Security benefits increases each year along with the Consumer Price Index. Also,\nSocial Security is funded by payroll taxes, which the government imposes on the income earned up to a certain\namount\u2014$137,700 in 2020. The government adjusts this level of income upward each year according to the\nrate of inflation, so that an indexed increase in the Social Security tax base accompanies the indexed rise in the\nbenefit level.\nAs yet another example of a government program affected by indexing, in 1996 the U.S., government began\noffering indexedbonds. Bonds are means by which the U.S. government (and many private-sector companies\nas well) borrows money; that is, investors buy the bonds, and then the government repays the money with\ninterest. Traditionally, government bonds have paid a fixed rate of interest. This policy gave a government that\nhad borrowed an incentive to encourage inflation, because it could then repay its past borrowing in inflated\ndollars at a lower real interest rate. However, indexed bonds promise to pay a certain real rate of interest above\nwhatever inflation rate occurs. In the case of a retiree trying to plan for the long term and worried about the\nrisk of inflation, for example, indexed bonds that guarantee a rate of return higher than inflation\u2014no matter\nthe level of inflation\u2014can be a very comforting investment.\nMight Indexing Reduce Concern over Inflation?\nIndexing may seem like an obviously useful step. After all, when individuals, firms, and government programs\nare indexed against inflation, then people can worry less about arbitrary redistributions and other effects of\ninflation.\nHowever, some of the fiercest opponents of inflation express grave concern about indexing. They point out that\nindexing is always partial. Not every employer will provide COLAs for workers. Not all companies can assume\nthat costs and revenues will rise in lockstep with the general rates of inflation. Not all interest rates for\nborrowers and savers will change to match inflation exactly. However, as partial inflation indexing spreads, the\npolitical opposition to inflation may diminish. After all, older people whose Social Security benefits are\nprotected against inflation, or banks that have loaned their money with adjustable-rate loans, no longer have\nas much reason to care whether inflation heats up. In a world where some people are indexed against inflation\nand some are not, financially savvy businesses and investors may seek out ways to be protected against\ninflation, while the financially unsophisticated and small businesses may feel it the most.\nA Preview of Policy Discussions of Inflation\nThis chapter has focused on how economists measure inflation, historical experience with inflation, how to\nadjust nominal variables into real ones, how inflation affects the economy, and how indexing works. We have 550 22 \u2022 Inflation\nbarely hinted at the causes of inflation, and we have not addressed government policies to deal with inflation.\nWe will examine these issues in depth in other chapters. However, it is useful to offer a preview here.\nWe can sum up the cause of inflation in one phrase: Too many dollars chasing too few goods. The great surges\nof inflation early in the twentieth century came after wars, which are a time when government spending is very\nhigh, but consumers have little to buy, because production is going to the war effort. Governments also\ncommonly impose price controls during wartime. After the war, the price controls end and pent-up buying\npower surges forth, driving up inflation. Otherwise, if too few dollars are chasing too many goods, then\ninflation will decline or even turn into deflation. Therefore, we typically associate slowdowns in economic\nactivity, as in major recessions and the Great Depression, with a reduction in inflation or even outright\ndeflation.\nThe policy implications are clear. If we are to avoid inflation, the amount of purchasing power in the economy\nmust grow at roughly the same rate as the production of goods. Macroeconomic policies that the government\ncan use to affect the amount of purchasing power\u2014through taxes, spending, and regulation of interest rates\nand credit\u2014can thus cause inflation to rise or reduce inflation to lower levels.\nBRING IT HOME\nInflation in a Pandemic\u2014A Return to the 1970s, or a Temporary Adjustment?\nThe pandemic-induced recession caused all sorts of disruptions to our economy, including inflation. During the\npandemic, the prices for goods like gas and cars fell as people shifted to remote work and canceled travel plans. But\nas the economy started to recover from the pandemic in early 2021, we started to see large increases in these\nprices. Higher prices were also fueled by the injections of cash into the economy through stimulus checks and\nunemployment benefits. The pandemic also caused shortages throughout the global supply chain, further pushing\nprices up (you'll learn more about this idea in a few chapters when we talk about aggregate supply and demand).\nWith headline annualized inflation rates in 2021 exceeding 6%, the question in the next few years is whether we'll\nsee permanently high inflation rates of 9%, 10%, or more, like we did in the 1970s and early-1980s. Some\neconomists believe the pandemic-induced inflation is just a transitory adjustment\u2014indeed, used car and gasoline\nprices rose dramatically in 2010 and 2011 as well, as we were recovering from the Great Recession. Others are\nmore concerned that the inflation is permanent. Shortages continue to exist throughout the economy as of early\n2022, and if consumers expect higher inflation, it can be a self-fulfilling prophecy, as they start buying things now in\norder to avoid future bouts of inflation.\nAs you learned about earlier, inflation is a major concern of consumers, if less of an issue among economists. But\ninflation should be matched by increases in living standards, otherwise there could be major implications for the\neconomy.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 22 \u2022 Key Terms 551\nKey Terms\nadjustable-rate mortgage (ARM)a loan a borrower uses to purchase a home in which the interest rate varies\nwith market interest rates\nbase yeararbitrary year whose value as an index number economists define as 100; inflation from the base\nyear to other years can easily be seen by comparing the index number in the other year to the index\nnumber in the base year\u2014for example, 100; so, if the index number for a year is 105, then there has been\nexactly 5% inflation between that year and the base year\nbasket of goods and servicesa hypothetical group of different items, with specified quantities of each one\nmeant to represent a \u201ctypical\u201d set of consumer purchases, used as a basis for calculating how the price\nlevel changes over time\nConsumer Price Index (CPI)a measure of inflation that U.S. government statisticians calculate based on the\nprice level from a fixed basket of goods and services that represents the average consumer's purchases\ncore inflation index a measure of inflation typically calculated by taking the CPI and excluding volatile\neconomic variables such as food and energy prices to better measure the underlying and persistent trend\nin long-term prices\ncost-of-living adjustments (COLAs)a contractual provision that wage increases will keep up with inflation\ndeflationnegative inflation; most prices in the economy are falling\nEmployment Cost Indexa measure of inflation based on wages paid in the labor market\nGDP deflatora measure of inflation based on the prices of all the GDP components\nhyperinflationan outburst of high inflation that often occurs (although not exclusively) when economies shift\nfrom a controlled economy to a market-oriented economy\nindex numbera unit-free number derived from the price level over a number of years, which makes\ncomputing inflation rates easier, since the index number has values around 100\nindexeda price, wage, or interest rate is adjusted automatically for inflation\ninflation a general and ongoing rise in price levels in an economy\nInternational Price Indexa measure of inflation based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or\nimported\nProducer Price Index (PPI)a measure of inflation based on prices paid for supplies and inputs by producers\nof goods and services\nquality/new goods biasinflation calculated using a fixed basket of goods over time tends to overstate the true\nrise in cost of living, because it does not account for improvements in the quality of existing goods or the\ninvention of new goods\nsubstitution biasan inflation rate calculated using a fixed basket of goods over time tends to overstate the true\nrise in the cost of living, because it does not take into account that the person can substitute away from\ngoods whose prices rise considerably\nKey Concepts and Summary\n22.1Tracking Inflation\nEconomists measure the price level by using a basket of goods and services and calculating how the total cost\nof buying that basket of goods will increase over time. Economists often express the price level in terms of\nindex numbers, which transform the cost of buying the basket of goods and services into a series of numbers\nin the same proportion to each other, but with an arbitrary base year of 100. We measure the inflation rate as\nthe percentage change between price levels or index numbers over time.\n22.2How to Measure Changes in the Cost of Living\nMeasuring price levels with a fixed basket of goods will always have two problems: the substitution bias, by\nwhich a fixed basket of goods does not allow for buying more of what becomes relatively less expensive and\nless of what becomes relatively more expensive; and the quality/new goods bias, by which a fixed basket\ncannot account for improvements in quality and the advent of new goods. These problems can be reduced in 552 22 \u2022 Self-Check Questions\ndegree\u2014for example, by allowing the basket of goods to evolve over time\u2014but we cannot totally eliminate them.\nThe most commonly cited measure of inflation is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is based on a basket of\ngoods representing what the typical consumer buys. The Core Inflation Index further breaks down the CPI by\nexcluding volatile economic commodities. Several price indices are not based on baskets of consumer goods.\nThe GDP deflator is based on all GDP components. The Producer Price Index is based on prices of supplies and\ninputs bought by producers of goods and services. An Employment Cost Index measures wage inflation in the\nlabor market. An International Price Index is based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported.\n22.3How the U.S. and Other Countries Experience Inflation\nIn the U.S. economy, the annual inflation rate in the last two decades has typically been around 2% to 4%. The\nperiods of highest inflation in the United States in the twentieth century occurred during the years after World\nWars I and II, and in the 1970s. The period of lowest inflation\u2014actually, with deflation\u2014was the 1930s Great\nDepression.\n22.4The Confusion Over Inflation\nUnexpected inflation will tend to hurt those whose money received, in terms of wages and interest payments,\ndoes not rise with inflation. In contrast, inflation can help those who owe money that they can pay in less\nvaluable, inflated dollars. Low rates of inflation have relatively little economic impact over the short term. Over\nthe medium and the long term, even low rates of inflation can complicate future planning. High rates of\ninflation can muddle price signals in the short term and prevent market forces from operating efficiently, and\ncan vastly complicate long-term savings and investment decisions.\n22.5Indexing and Its Limitations\nA payment is indexed if it is automatically adjusted for inflation. Examples of indexing in the private sector\ninclude wage contracts with cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) and loan agreements like adjustable-rate\nmortgages (ARMs). Examples of indexing in the public sector include tax brackets and Social Security\npayments.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

You just affected domestic savings and borrowing.\nNow say you are at the mall and buy two T-shirts \u201cmade in China,\u201d and later contribute to a charity that helps\nrefugees. What is the impact? You affected how much money flows into and out of the United States. If you open an\nIRA savings account and put money in an international mutual fund, you are involved in the flow of money overseas.\nWhile your involvement may not seem as influential as that of someone like the president, who can increase or\ndecrease foreign aid and, thereby, have a huge impact on money flows in and out of the country, you do interact with\nthe global financial system on a daily basis.\nThe balance of payments\u2014a term you will meet soon\u2014seems like a huge topic, but once you learn the specific\ncomponents of trade and money, it all makes sense. Along the way, you may have to give up some common\nmisunderstandings about trade and answer some questions: If a country is running a trade deficit, is that bad? Is a\ntrade surplus good? For example, look at the Democratic Republic of the Congo (often referred to as \u201cCongo\u201d), a\nlarge country in Central Africa. In 2013, it ran a trade surplus of $1 billion, so it must be doing well, right? In\ncontrast, the trade deficit in the United States was $508 billion in 2013. Do these figures suggest that the United\nStates economy is performing worse than the Congolese economy? Not necessarily. The U.S. trade deficit tends to\nworsen as the economy strengthens. In contrast, high poverty rates in the Congo persist, and these rates are not\ngoing down even with the positive trade balance. Clearly, it is more complicated than simply asserting that running a\ntrade deficit is bad for the economy. You will learn more about these issues and others in this chapter.\nThebalance of trade(or trade balance) is any gap between a nation\u2019s dollar value of its exports, or what its\nproducers sell abroad, and a nation\u2019s dollar value of imports, or the foreign-made products and services that\nhouseholds and businesses purchase. Recall fromThe Macroeconomic Perspectivethat if exports exceed\nimports, the economy has atrade surplus. If imports exceed exports, the economy has atrade deficit. If exports\nand imports are equal, then trade is balanced, but what happens when trade is out of balance and large trade\nsurpluses or deficits exist?\nGermany, for example, has had substantial trade surpluses in recent decades, in which exports have greatly\nexceeded imports. According to the World Bank, in 2020, Germany ran a trade surplus of $242 billion. In\ncontrast, the U.S. economy in recent decades has experienced large trade deficits, in which imports have\nconsiderably exceeded exports. In 2020, for example, U.S. imports exceeded exports by $651 billion.\nA series of financial crises triggered by unbalanced trade can lead economies into deep recessions. These\ncrises begin with large trade deficits. At some point, foreign investors become pessimistic about the economy\nand move their money to other countries. The economy then drops into deep recession, withreal GDPoften\nfalling up to 10% or more in a single year. This happened to Mexico in 1995 when their GDP fell 8.1%. A\nnumber of countries in East Asia\u2014Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia\u2014succumbed to the same\neconomic illness in 1997\u20131998 (called the Asian Financial Crisis). In the late 1990s and into the early 2000s,\nRussia and Argentina had the identical experience. What are the connections between imbalances of trade in\ngoods and services and the flows of international financial capital that set off these economic avalanches?\nWe will start by examining the balance of trade in more detail, by looking at some patterns of trade balances in\nthe United States and around the world. Then we will examine the intimate connection between international\nflows of goods and services and international flows of financial capital, which to economists are really just two\nsides of the same coin. People often assume that trade surpluses like those in Germany must be a positive sign\nfor an economy, while trade deficits like those in the United States must be harmful. As it turns out, both trade\nsurpluses and deficits can be either good or bad. We will see why in this chapter.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23.1 \u2022 Measuring Trade Balances 559\n23.1Measuring Trade Balances\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain merchandise trade balance, current account balance, and unilateral transfers\n\u2022 Identify components of the U.S. current account balance\n\u2022 Calculate the merchandise trade balance and current account balance using import and export data for a\ncountry\nA few decades ago, it was common to track the solid or physical items that planes, trains, and trucks\ntransported between countries as a way of measuring the balance of trade. Economists call this measurement\nthemerchandise trade balance. In most high-income economies, including the United States, goods comprise\nless than half of a country\u2019s total production, while services comprise more than half. The last two decades\nhave seen a surge in international trade in services, powered by technological advances in\ntelecommunications and computers that have made it possible to export or import customer services, finance,\nlaw, advertising, management consulting, software, construction engineering, and product design. Most global\ntrade still takes the form of goods rather than services, and the government announces and the media\nprominently report the merchandise trade balance. Old habits are hard to break. Economists, however,\ntypically rely on broader measures such as the balance of trade or thecurrent account balancewhich\nincludes other international flows of income and foreign aid.\nComponents of the U.S. Current Account Balance\nTable 23.1breaks down the four main components of the U.S. current account balance for the last quarter of\n2015 (seasonally adjusted). The first line shows the merchandise trade balance; that is, exports and imports of\ngoods. Because imports exceed exports, the trade balance in the final column is negative, showing a\nmerchandise trade deficit. We can explain how the government collects this trade information in the following\nClear It Up feature.\nValue of Exports (money flowing into Value of Imports (money flowing out\nBalance\nthe United States) of the United States)\nGoods $1,428.8 $2,350.8 \u2013$922.0\nServices $705.6 $460.3 $245.3\nIncome receipts\n$957.9 $769.4 $188.5\nand payments\nUnilateral transfers $166.3 $294.2 \u2013$127.9\nCurrent account\n$3,258.6 $3,874.7 \u2013$616.1\nbalance\nTABLE23.1Components of the U.S. Current Account Balance for 2020 (in billions of dollars).Source:\nhttps://apps.bea.gov/itable/index.cfm, ITA Table 1.1.\nCLEAR IT UP\nHow does the U.S. government collect trade statistics?\nDo not confuse the balance of trade (which tracks imports and exports), with the current account balance, which\nincludes not justexportsandimports, but also income from investment and transfers. 560 23 \u2022 The International Trade and Capital Flows\nTheBureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)within theU.S. Department of Commercecompiles statistics on the balance\nof trade using a variety of different sources. Merchandise importers and exporters must file monthly documents with\nthe Census Bureau, which provides the basic data for tracking trade. To measure international trade in\nservices\u2014which can happen over a telephone line or computer network without shipping any physical goods\u2014the\nBEA carries out a set of surveys. Another set of BEA surveys tracks investment flows, and there are even specific\nsurveys to collect travel information from U.S. residents visiting Canada and Mexico. For measuring unilateral\ntransfers, the BEA has access to official U.S. government spending on aid, and then also carries out a survey of\ncharitable organizations that make foreign donations.\nThe BEA then cross-checks this information on international flows of goods and capital against other available data.\nFor example, the Census Bureau also collects data from the shipping industry, which it can use to check the data on\ntrade in goods. All companies involved in international flows of capital\u2014including banks and companies making\nfinancial investments like stocks\u2014must file reports, which the U.S. Department of the Treasury ultimately checks.\nThe BEA also can cross check information on foreign trade by looking at data collected by other countries on their\nforeign trade with the United States, and also at the data collected by various international organizations. Take these\ndata sources, stir carefully, and you have the U.S. balance of trade statistics. Much of the statistics that we cite in\nthis chapter come from these sources.\nThe second row ofTable 23.1provides data on trade in services. Here, the U.S. economy is running asurplus.\nAlthough the level of trade in services is still relatively small compared to trade in goods, the importance of\nservices has expanded substantially over the last few decades. For example, U.S. exports of services were equal\nto about one-half of U.S. exports of goods in 2020, compared to one-fifth in 1980.\nThe third component of the current account balance, labeled \u201cincome payments,\u201d refers to money that U.S.\nfinancial investors received on their foreign investments (money flowing into the United States) and payments\nto foreign investors who had invested their funds here (money flowing out of the United States). The reason for\nincluding this money on foreign investment in the overall measure of trade, along with goods and services, is\nthat, from an economic perspective, income is just as much an economic transaction as car, wheat, or oil\nshipments: it is just trade that is happening in the financial capital market.\nThe final category of the current account balance isunilateral transfers, which are payments that\ngovernment, private charities, or individuals make in which they send money abroad without receiving any\ndirect good or service. Economic or military assistance from the U.S. government to other countries fits into\nthis category, as does spending abroad by charities to address poverty or social inequalities. When an\nindividual in the United States sends money overseas, as is the case with some immigrants, it is also counted\nin this category. The current account balance treats these unilateral payments like imports, because they also\ninvolve a stream of payments leaving the country. For the U.S. economy, unilateral transfers are almost always\nnegative. This pattern, however, does not always hold. In 1991, for example, when the United States led an\ninternational coalition against Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq in the Gulf War, many other nations agreed that they\nwould make payments to the United States to offset the U.S. war expenses. These payments were large enough\nthat, in 1991, the overall U.S. balance on unilateral transfers was a positive $10 billion.\nThe following Work It Out feature steps you through the process of using the values for goods, services, and\nincome payments to calculate the merchandise balance and the current account balance.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23.1 \u2022 Measuring Trade Balances 561\nWORK IT OUT\nCalculating the Merchandise Balance and the Current Account Balance\nExports (in $ billions) Imports (in $ billions) Balance\nGoods\nServices\nIncome payments\nUnilateral transfers\nCurrent account balance\nTABLE23.2Calculating Merchandise Balance and Current Account Balance\nUse the information given below to fill inTable 23.2, and then calculate:\n\u2022 The merchandise balance\n\u2022 The current account balance\nKnown information:\n\u2022 Unilateral transfers: $130\n\u2022 Exports in goods: $1,046\n\u2022 Exports in services: $509\n\u2022 Imports in goods: $1,562\n\u2022 Imports in services: $371\n\u2022 Income received by U.S. investors on foreign stocks and bonds: $561\n\u2022 Income received by foreign investors on U.S. assets: $472\nStep 1.

The challenge is to understand how the international flows of goods and\nservices are connected with international flows offinancial capital. In this module we will illustrate the\nintimate connection between trade balances and flows of financial capital in two ways: a parable of trade\nbetween Robinson Crusoe and Friday, and a circular flow diagram representing flows of trade and payments.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23.3 \u2022 Trade Balances and Flows of Financial Capital 565\nA Two-Person Economy: Robinson Crusoe and Friday\nTo understand how economists view trade deficits and surpluses, consider a parable based on the story of\nRobinson Crusoe. Crusoe, as you may remember from the classic novel by Daniel Defoe first published in 1719,\nwas shipwrecked on a desert island. After living alone for some time, he is joined by a second person, whom he\nnames Friday. Think about the balance of trade in a two-person economy like that of Robinson and Friday.\nRobinson and Friday trade goods and services. Perhaps Robinson catches fish and trades them to Friday for\ncoconuts, or Friday weaves a hat out of tree fronds and trades it to Robinson for help in carrying water. For a\nperiod of time, each individual trade is self-contained and complete. Because each trade is voluntary, both\nRobinson and Friday must feel that they are receiving fair value for what they are giving. As a result, each\nperson\u2019s exports are always equal to his imports, and trade is always in balance between the two. Neither\nperson experiences either a trade deficit or a trade surplus.\nHowever, one day Robinson approaches Friday with a proposition. Robinson wants to dig ditches for an\nirrigation system for his garden, but he knows that if he starts this project, he will not have much time left to\nfish and gather coconuts to feed himself each day. He proposes that Friday supply him with a certain number\nof fish and coconuts for several months, and then after that time, he promises to repay Friday out of the extra\nproduce that he will be able to grow in his irrigated garden. If Friday accepts this offer, then a trade imbalance\ncomes into being. For several months, Friday will have a trade surplus: that is, he is exporting to Robinson\nmore than he is importing. More precisely, he is giving Robinson fish and coconuts, and at least for the\nmoment, he is receiving nothing in return. Conversely, Robinson will have a trade deficit, because he is\nimporting more from Friday than he is exporting.\nThis parable raises several useful issues in thinking about what a trade deficit and a trade surplus really mean\nin economic terms. The first issue that this story of Robinson and Friday raises is this: Is it better to have a\ntrade surplus or a trade deficit? The answer, as in any voluntary market interaction, is that if both parties agree\nto the transaction, then they may both be better off. Over time, if Robinson\u2019s irrigated garden is a success, it is\ncertainly possible that both Robinson and Friday can benefit from this agreement.\nThe parable raises a second issue: What can go wrong? Robinson\u2019s proposal to Friday introduces an element of\nuncertainty. Friday is, in effect, making a loan of fish and coconuts to Robinson, and Friday\u2019s happiness with\nthis arrangement will depend on whether Robinson repays that loan as planned, in full and on time. Perhaps\nRobinson spends several months loafing and never builds the irrigation system, or perhaps Robinson has been\ntoo optimistic about how much he will be able to grow with the new irrigation system, which turns out not to be\nvery productive. Perhaps, after building the irrigation system, Robinson decides that he does not want to repay\nFriday as much as he previously agreed. Any of these developments will prompt a new round of negotiations\nbetween Friday and Robinson. Why the repayment failed is likely to shape Friday\u2019s attitude toward these\nrenegotiations. If Robinson worked very hard and the irrigation system just did not increase production as\nintended, Friday may have some sympathy. If Robinson loafed or if he just refuses to pay, Friday may become\nirritated.\nA third issue that the parable raises is that an intimate relationship exists between a trade deficit and\ninternational borrowing, and between a trade surplus and international lending. The size of Friday\u2019s trade\nsurplus is exactly how much he is lending to Robinson. The size of Robinson\u2019s trade deficit is exactly how much\nhe is borrowing from Friday. To economists, a trade surplus literally means the same thing as an outflow of\nfinancial capital, and a trade deficit literally means the same thing as an inflow of financial capital. This last\ninsight is worth exploring in greater detail, which we will do in the following section.\nThe story of Robinson and Friday also provides a good opportunity to consider the law ofcomparative\nadvantage, which you learn more about in theInternational Tradechapter. The following Work It Out feature\nsteps you through calculating comparative advantage for the wheat and cloth traded between the United States\nand Great Britain in the 1800s. 566 23 \u2022 The International Trade and Capital Flows\nWORK IT OUT\nCalculating Comparative Advantage\nIn the 1800s, the United States and Britain traded wheat and cloth.Table 23.5shows the varying hours of labor\nper unit of output.\nWheat (in Cloth (in Relative labor cost of wheat Relative labor cost of cloth\nbushels) yards) (Pw/Pc) (Pc/Pw)\nUnited\n8 9 8/9 9/8\nStates\nBritain 4 3 4/3 3/4\nTABLE23.5\nStep 1. Observe fromTable 23.5that, in the United States, it takes eight hours to supply a bushel of wheat and\nnine hours to supply a yard of cloth. In contrast, it takes four hours to supply a bushel of wheat and three hours\nto supply a yard of cloth in Britain.\nStep 2. Recognize the difference between absolute advantage and comparative advantage. Britain has an\nabsolute advantage (lowest cost) in each good, since it takes a lower amount of labor to make each good in\nBritain. Britain also has a comparative advantage in the production of cloth (lower opportunity cost in cloth (3/4\nversus 9/8)). The United States has a comparative advantage in wheat production (lower opportunity cost of 8/9\nversus 4/3).\nStep 3. Determine the relative price of one good in terms of the other good. The price of wheat, in this example, is\nthe amount of cloth you have to give up. To find this price, convert the hours per unit of wheat and cloth into units\nper hour. To do so, observe that in the United States it takes eight hours to make a bushel of wheat, so workers\ncan process 1/8 of a bushel of wheat in an hour. It takes nine hours to make a yard of cloth in the United States,\nso workers can produce 1/9 of a yard of cloth in an hour. If you divide the amount of cloth (1/9 of a yard) by the\namount of wheat you give up (1/8 of a bushel) in an hour, you find the price (8/9) of one good (wheat) in terms of\nthe other (cloth).\nThe Balance of Trade as the Balance of Payments\nThe connection between trade balances and international flows of financial capital is so close that economists\nsometimes describe the balance of trade as thebalance of payments. Each category of the current account\nbalance involves a corresponding flow of payments between a given country and the rest of the world economy.\nFigure 23.3shows the flow of goods and services and payments between one country\u2014the United States in this\nexample\u2014and the rest of the world. The top line shows U.S. exports of goods and services, while the second line\nshows financial payments from purchasers in other countries back to the U.S. economy. The third line then\nshows U.S. imports of goods, services, and investment, and the fourth line shows payments from the home\neconomy to the rest of the world. Flow of goods and services (lines one and three) show up in the current\naccount, while we find flow of funds (lines two and four) in the financial account.\nThe bottom four lines inFigure 23.3show the flows of investment income. In the first of the bottom lines, we\nsee investments made abroad with funds flowing from the home country to the rest of the world. Investment\nincome stemming from an investment abroad then runs in the other direction from the rest of the world to the\nhome country. Similarly, we see on the bottom third line, an investment from the rest of the world into the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23.4 \u2022 The National Saving and Investment Identity 567\nhome country andinvestment income(bottom fourth line) flowing from the home country to the rest of the\nworld. We find the investment income (bottom lines two and four) in the current account, while investment to\nthe rest of the world or into the home country (lines one and three) is in the financial account. This figure does\nnot show unilateral transfers, the fourth item in the current account.\nFIGURE23.3Flow of Investment Goods and CapitalEach element of the current account balance involves a flow of\nfinancial payments between countries. The top line shows exports of goods and services leaving the home country;\nthe second line shows the money that the home country receives for those exports. The third line shows imports\nthat the home country receives; the fourth line shows the payments that the home country sent abroad in exchange\nfor these imports.\nA current account deficit means that, the country is a net borrower from abroad. Conversely, a positive current\naccount balance means a country is a net lender to the rest of the world. Just like the parable of Robinson and\nFriday, the lesson is that a trade surplus means an overall outflow of financial investment capital, as domestic\ninvestors put their funds abroad, while a deficit in the current account balance is exactly equal to the overall or\nnet inflow of foreign investment capital from abroad.\nIt is important to recognize that an inflow and outflow of foreign capital does not necessarily refer to a debt that\ngovernments owe to other governments, although government debt may be part of the picture. Instead, these\ninternational flows of financial capital refer to all of the ways in which private investors in one country may\ninvest in another country\u2014by buying real estate, companies, and financial investments like stocks and bonds.\n23.4The National Saving and Investment Identity\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain the determinants of trade and current account balance\n\u2022 Identify and calculate supply and demand for financial capital\n\u2022 Explain how a nation's own level of domestic saving and investment determines a nation's balance of trade\n\u2022 Predict the rising and falling of trade deficits based on a nation's saving and investment identity\nThe close connection between trade balances and international flows of savings and investments leads to a\nmacroeconomic analysis. This approach views trade balances\u2014and their associated flows of financial 568 23 \u2022 The International Trade and Capital Flows\ncapital\u2014in the context of the overall levels of savings and financial investment in the economy.\nUnderstanding the Determinants of the Trade and Current Account Balance\nThenational saving and investment identityprovides a useful way to understand the determinants of the\ntrade and current account balance. In a nation\u2019sfinancial capital market, the quantity of financial capital\nsupplied at any given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for purposes of making\ninvestments. What is on the supply and demand sides of financial capital? See the following Clear It Up feature\nfor the answer to this question.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat comprises the supply and demand of financial capital?\nA country\u2019s national savings is the total of its domestic savings by household and companies (private savings) as\nwell as the government (public savings). If a country is running a trade deficit, it means money from abroad is\nentering the country and the government considers it part of the supply of financial capital.\nThe demand for financial capital (money) represents groups that are borrowing the money. Businesses need to\nborrow to finance their investments in factories, materials, and personnel. When the federal government runs a\nbudget deficit, it is also borrowing money from investors by selling Treasury bonds. Therefore, both business\ninvestment and the federal government can demand (or borrow) the supply of savings.\nThere are two main sources for the supply of financial capital in the U.S. economy: saving by individuals and\nfirms, called S, and the inflow of financial capital from foreign investors, which is equal to the trade deficit (M \u2013\nX), or imports minus exports. There are also two main sources of demand for financial capital in the U.S.\neconomy: private sector investment, I, and government borrowing, where the government needs to borrow\nwhen government spending, G, is higher than the taxes collected, T. We can express this national savings and\ninvestment identity in algebraic terms:\nAgain, in this equation, S is private savings, T is taxes, G is government spending, M is imports, X is exports,\nand I is investment. This relationship is true as a matter of definition because, for the macro economy, the\nquantity supplied of financial capital must be equal to the quantity demanded.\nHowever, certain components of the national savings and investment identity can switch between the supply\nside and the demand side. Some countries, like the United States in most years since the 1970s, have budget\ndeficits, which mean the government is spending more than it collects in taxes, and so the government needs\nto borrow funds. In this case, the government term would be G \u2013 T > 0, showing that spending is larger than\ntaxes, and the government would be a demander of financial capital on the left-hand side of the equation (that\nis, a borrower), not a supplier of financial capital on the right-hand side. However, if the government runs a\nbudget surplus so that the taxes exceed spending, as the U.S. government did from 1998 to 2001, then the\ngovernment in that year was contributing to the supply of financial capital (T \u2013 G > 0), and would appear on the\nleft (saving) side of the national savings and investment identity.\nSimilarly, if a national economy runs a trade surplus, the trade sector will involve an outflow of financial capital\nto other countries. A trade surplus means that the domestic financial capital is in surplus within a country and\ncan be invested in other countries.\nThe fundamental notion that total quantity offinancial capitaldemanded equals total quantity of financial\ncapital supplied must always remain true. Domestic savings will always appear as part of the supply of\nfinancial capital and domestic investment will always appear as part of the demand for financial capital.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23.4 \u2022 The National Saving and Investment Identity 569\nHowever, the government and trade balance elements of the equation can move back and forth as either\nsuppliers or demanders of financial capital, depending on whether government budgets and the trade balance\nare in surplus or deficit.\nDomestic Saving and Investment Determine the Trade Balance\nOne insight from the national saving and investment identity is that a nation's own levels of domestic saving\nand investment determine a nation\u2019s balance of trade. To understand this point, rearrange the identity to put\nthe balance of trade all by itself on one side of the equation. Consider first the situation with a trade deficit, and\nthen the situation with a trade surplus.\nIn the case of a trade deficit, the national saving and investment identity can be rewritten as:\nIn this case, domestic investment is higher than domestic saving, including both private and government\nsaving. The only way that domestic investment can exceed domestic saving is if capital is flowing into a\ncountry from abroad. After all, that extra financial capital for investment has to come from someplace.\nNow consider a tradesurplusfrom the standpoint of the national saving and investment identity:\nIn this case, domestic savings (both private and public) is higher than domestic investment. That extra\nfinancial capital will be invested abroad.\nThis connection of domestic saving and investment to the trade balance explains why economists view the\nbalance of trade as a fundamentally macroeconomic phenomenon. As the national saving and investment\nidentity shows, the performance of certain sectors of an economy, like cars or steel, do not determine the trade\nbalance. Further, whether the nation\u2019s trade laws and regulations encourage free trade or protectionism also\ndoes not determine the trade balance (seeGlobalization and Protectionism).\nExploring Trade Balances One Factor at a Time\nThe national saving and investment identity also provides a framework for thinking about what will cause\ntrade deficits to rise or fall. Begin with the version of the identity that has domestic savings and investment on\nthe left and the trade deficit on the right:\nNow, consider the factors on the left-hand side of the equation one at a time, while holding the other factors\nconstant.\nAs a first example, assume that the level of domestic investment in a country rises, while the level of private\nand public saving remains unchanged.Table 23.6shows the result in the first row under the equation. Since\nthe equality of the national savings and investment identity must continue to hold\u2014it is, after all, an identity\nthat must be true by definition\u2014the rise in domestic investment will mean a higher trade deficit. This situation\noccurred in the U.S. economy in the late 1990s. Because of the surge of new information and communications\ntechnologies that became available, business investment increased substantially. A fall in private saving\nduring this time and a rise in government saving more or less offset each other. As a result, the financial\ncapital to fund that business investment came from abroad, which is one reason for the very high U.S. trade\ndeficits of the late 1990s and early 2000s. 570 23 \u2022 The International Trade and Capital Flows\nDomestic Private Domestic Public Domestic\n\u2013 \u2013 = Trade Deficit\nInvestment Savings Savings\nI \u2013 S \u2013 (T \u2013 G) = (M \u2013 X)\nThen M \u2013 X must\nUp No change No change\nrise\nNo change Up No change Then M \u2013 X must fall\nThen M \u2013 X must\nNo change No change Down\nrise\nTABLE23.6Causes of a Changing Trade Balance\nAs a second scenario, assume that the level of domestic savings rises, while the level of domestic investment\nand public savings remain unchanged. In this case, the trade deficit would decline. As domestic savings rises,\nthere would be less need for foreign financial capital to meet investment needs. For this reason, a policy\nproposal often made for reducing the U.S. trade deficit is to increase private saving\u2014although exactly how to\nincrease the overall rate of saving has proven controversial.\nAs a third scenario, imagine that the government budget deficit increased dramatically, while domestic\ninvestment and private savings remained unchanged. This scenario occurred in the U.S. economy in the\nmid-1980s. The federal budget deficit increased from $79 billion in 1981 to $221 billion in 1986\u2014an increase\nin the demand for financial capital of $142 billion. The current account balance collapsed from a surplus of $5\nbillion in 1981 to a deficit of $147 billion in 1986\u2014an increase in the supply of financial capital from abroad of\n$152 billion. The connection at that time is clear: a sharp increase in government borrowing increased the U.S.\neconomy\u2019s demand for financial capital, and foreign investors through the trade deficit primarily supplied that\nincrease. The following Work It Out feature walks you through a scenario in which private domestic savings\nhas to rise by a certain amount to reduce a trade deficit.\nWORK IT OUT\nSolving Problems with the Saving and Investment Identity\nUse the saving and investment identity to answer the following question: Country A has a trade deficit of $200\nbillion, private domestic savings of $500 billion, a government deficit of $200 billion, and private domestic\ninvestment of $500 billion. To reduce the $200 billion trade deficit by $100 billion, by how much does private\ndomestic savings have to increase?\nStep 1. Write out the savings investment formula solving for the trade deficit or surplus on the left:\nStep 2. In the formula, put the amount for the trade deficit in as a negative number (X \u2013 M). The left side of your\nformula is now:\nStep 3. Enter the private domestic savings (S) of $500 in the formula:\nStep 4. Enter the private domestic investment (I) of $500 into the formula:\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23.4 \u2022 The National Saving and Investment Identity 571\nStep 5. The government budget surplus or balance is represented by (T \u2013 G). Enter a budget deficit amount for (T\n\u2013 G) of \u2013200:\nStep 6. Your formula now is:\nThe question is: To reduce your trade deficit (X \u2013 M) of \u2013200 to \u2013100 (in billions of dollars), by how much will\nsavings have to rise?\nStep 7. Summarize the answer: Private domestic savings needs to rise by $100 billion, to a total of $600 billion,\nfor the two sides of the equation to remain equal (\u2013100 = \u2013100).\nShort-Term Movements in the Business Cycle and the Trade Balance\nIn the short run, whether an economy is in a recession or on the upswing can affect trade imbalances. A\nrecession tends to make a trade deficit smaller, or a trade surplus larger, while a period of strong economic\ngrowth tends to make a trade deficit larger, or a trade surplus smaller. These are not hard-and-fast rules,\nhowever.\nAs an example, note inFigure 23.2that the U.S. trade deficit declined by almost half from 2006 to 2009. One\nprimary reason for this change is that during the recession, as the U.S. economy slowed down, it purchased\nfewer of all goods, including fewer imports from abroad. However, buying power abroad fell less, and so U.S.\nexports did not fall by as much. On the other hand, during the 2020 pandemic-induced recession, the trade\ndeficit expanded (current account balance plummeted) as the U.S. economy became more reliant on other\ncountries for goods and services.\nConversely, in the mid-2000s, when the U.S. trade deficit became very large, a contributing short-term reason\nis that the U.S. economy was growing. As a result, there was considerable aggressive buying in the U.S.\neconomy, including the buying of imports. Thus, a trade deficit (or a much lower trade surplus) often\naccompanies a rapidly growing domestic economy, while a trade surplus (or a much lower trade deficit)\naccompanies a slowing or recessionary domestic economy.\nRegardless of whether the trade deficit falls or rises during expansions or downturns, when the trade deficit\nrises, it necessarily means a greater net inflow offoreign financial capital. The national saving and investment\nidentity teaches that the rest of the economy can absorb this inflow of foreign financial capital in several\ndifferent ways. For example, reduced private savings could offset the additional inflow of financial capital from\nabroad, leaving domestic investment and public saving unchanged. Alternatively, the inflow of foreign\nfinancial capital could result in higher domestic investment, leaving private and public saving unchanged. Yet\nanother possibility is that greater government borrowing could absorb the inflow of foreign financial capital,\nleaving domestic saving and investment unchanged. The national saving and investment identity does not\nspecify which of these scenarios, alone or in combination, will occur\u2014only that one of them must occur. 572 23 \u2022 The International Trade and Capital Flows\n23.5The Pros and Cons of Trade Deficits and Surpluses\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Identify three ways in which borrowing money or running a trade deficit can result in a healthy economy\n\u2022 Identify three ways in which borrowing money or running a trade deficit can result in a weaker economy\nBecause flows of trade always involve flows of financial payments, flows of international trade are actually the\nsame as flows of international financial capital. The question of whether trade deficits or surpluses are good or\nbad for an economy is, in economic terms, exactly the same question as whether it is a good idea for an\neconomy to rely on net inflows of financial capital from abroad or to make net investments of financial capital\nabroad. Conventional wisdom often holds that borrowing money is foolhardy, and that a prudent country, like a\nprudent person, should always rely on its own resources. While it is certainly possible to borrow too much\u2014as\nanyone with an overloaded credit card can testify\u2014borrowing at certain times can also make sound economic\nsense. For both individuals and countries, there is no economic merit in a policy of abstaining from\nparticipation in financial capital markets.\nIt makes economic sense to borrow when you are buying something with a long-run payoff; that is, when you\nare making an investment. For this reason, it can make economic sense to borrow for a college education,\nbecause the education will typically allow you to earn higher wages, and so to repay the loan and still come out\nahead. It can also make sense for a business to borrow in order to purchase a machine that will last 10 years, as\nlong as the machine will increase output and profits by more than enough to repay the loan. Similarly, it can\nmake economic sense for a national economy to borrow from abroad, as long as it wisely invests the money in\nways that will tend to raise the nation\u2019s economic growth over time. Then, it will be possible for the national\neconomy to repay the borrowed money over time and still end up better off than before.\nOne vivid example of a country that borrowed heavily from abroad, invested wisely, and did perfectly well is\nthe United States during the nineteenth century. The United States ran a trade deficit in 40 of the 45 years\nfrom 1831 to 1875, which meant that it was importing capital from abroad over that time. However, that\nfinancial capital was mostly invested in projects like railroads that brought a substantial economic payoff. (See\nthe following Clear It Up feature for more on this.)\nA more recent example along these lines is the experience of South Korea, which had trade deficits during\nmuch of the 1970s\u2014and so was an importer of capital over that time. However, South Korea also had high rates\nof investment in physical plant and equipment, and its economy grew rapidly. From the mid-1980s into the\nmid-1990s, South Korea often had trade surpluses\u2014that is, it was repaying its past borrowing by sending\ncapital abroad.\nIn contrast, some countries have run large trade deficits, borrowed heavily in global capital markets, and\nended up in all kinds of trouble. Two specific sorts of trouble are worth examining. First, a borrower nation can\nfind itself in a bind if it does not invest the incoming funds from abroad in a way that leads to increased\nproductivity. Several of Latin America's large economies, including Mexico and Brazil, ran large trade deficits\nand borrowed heavily from abroad in the 1970s, but the inflow of financial capital did not boost productivity\nsufficiently, which meant that these countries faced enormous troubles repaying the money borrowed when\neconomic conditions shifted during the 1980s. Similarly, it appears that a number of African nations that\nborrowed foreign funds in the 1970s and 1980s did not invest in productive economic assets. As a result,\nseveral of those countries later faced large interest payments, with no economic growth to show for the\nborrowed funds.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23.5 \u2022 The Pros and Cons of Trade Deficits and Surpluses 573\nCLEAR IT UP\nAre trade deficits always harmful?\nFor most years of the nineteenth century, U.S. imports exceeded exports and the U.S. economy had a trade deficit.\nYet the string of trade deficits did not hold back the economy at all. Instead, the trade deficits contributed to the\nstrong economic growth that gave the U.S. economy the highestper capita GDPin the world by around 1900.\nThe U.S. trade deficits meant that the U.S. economy was receiving a net inflow of foreign capital from abroad. Much\nof that foreign capital flowed into two areas of investment\u2014railroads and public infrastructure like roads, water\nsystems, and schools\u2014which were important to helping the U.S. economy grow.\nWe should not overstate the effect of foreign investment capital on U.S. economic growth. In most years the foreign\nfinancial capital represented no more than 6\u201310% of the funds that the government used for overall physical\ninvestment in the economy. Nonetheless, the trade deficit and the accompanying investment funds from abroad\nwere clearly a help, not a hindrance, to the U.S. economy in the nineteenth century.\nA second \u201ctrouble\u201d is: What happens if the foreign money flows in, and then suddenly flows out again? We\nraised this scenario at the start of the chapter. In the mid-1990s, a number of countries in East Asia\u2014Thailand,\nIndonesia, Malaysia, and South Korea\u2014ran large trade deficits and imported capital from abroad. However, in\n1997 and 1998 many foreign investors became concerned about the health of these economies, and quickly\npulled their money out of stock and bond markets, real estate, and banks. The extremely rapid departure of\nthat foreign capital staggered the banking systems and economies of these countries, plunging them into deep\nrecession. We investigate and discuss the links between international capital flows, banks, and recession in\nThe Impacts of Government Borrowing.\nWhile a trade deficit is not always harmful, there is no guarantee that running a trade surplus will bring robust\neconomic health. For example, Germany and Japan ran substantial trade surpluses for most of the last three\ndecades. Regardless of their persistent trade surpluses, both countries have experienced occasional recessions\nand neither country has had especially robust annual growth in recent years. Read more about Japan\u2019s trade\nsurplus in the next Clear It Up feature.\nLINK IT UP\nWatch thisvideo(http://openstax.org/l/tradedeficit)on whether or not trade deficit is good for the economy.\nThe sheer size and persistence of the U.S. trade deficits and inflows of foreign capital since the 1980s are a\nlegitimate cause for concern. The huge U.S. economy will not be destabilized by an outflow of international\ncapital as easily as, say, the comparatively tiny economies of Thailand and Indonesia were in 1997\u20131998. Even\nan economy that is not knocked down, however, can still be shaken. American policymakers should certainly\nbe paying attention to those cases where a pattern of extensive and sustained current account deficits and\nforeign borrowing has gone badly\u2014if only as a cautionary tale.\nCLEAR IT UP\nAre trade surpluses always beneficial? Considering Japan since the 1990s.\nPerhaps no economy around the world is better known for its trade surpluses than Japan. Since 1990, the size of\nthese surpluses has often been near $100 billion per year. When Japan\u2019s economy was growing vigorously in the\n1960s and 1970s, many, especially non-economists, described its large trade surpluses either a cause or a result of\nits robust economic health. However, from a standpoint of economic growth, Japan\u2019s economy has been teetering in\nand out of recession since 1990, withreal GDPgrowth averaging only about 1% per year, and an unemployment rate 574 23 \u2022 The International Trade and Capital Flows\nthat has been creeping higher. Clearly, a whopping trade surplus is no guarantee of economic good health.\nInstead, Japan\u2019s trade surplus reflects that Japan has a very high rate of domestic savings, more than the Japanese\neconomy can invest domestically, and so it invests the extra funds abroad. In Japan\u2019s slow economy, consumption\nof imports is relatively low, and the growth of consumption is relatively slow. Thus, Japan\u2019s exports continually\nexceed its imports, leaving the trade surplus continually high. Recently, Japan\u2019s trade surpluses began to\ndeteriorate. In 2013, Japan ran a trade deficit due to the high cost of imported oil. By 2015, Japan again had a\nsurplus and continues to run one today.\n23.6The Difference between Level of Trade and the Trade Balance\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Identify three factors that influence a country's level of trade\n\u2022 Differentiate between balance of trade and level of trade\nA nation\u2019slevelof trade may at first sound like much the same issue as thebalanceof trade, but these two are\nactually quite separate. It is perfectly possible for a country to have a very highlevel of trade\u2014measured by its\nexports of goods and services as a share of its GDP\u2014while it also has a near-balance between exports and\nimports. A high level of trade indicates that the nation exports a good portion of its production. It is also\npossible for a country\u2019s trade to be a relatively low share of GDP, relative to global averages, but for the\nimbalance between its exports and its imports to be quite large. We emphasized this general theme earlier in\nMeasuring Trade Balances, which offered some illustrative figures on trade levels and balances.\nA country\u2019s level of trade tells how much of its production it exports. We measure this by the percent of exports\nout of GDP. It indicates the degree of an economy's globalization. Some countries, such as Germany, have a\nhigh level of trade\u2014they export almost 50% of their total production. The balance of trade tells us if the country\nis running a trade surplus or trade deficit. A country can have a low level of trade but a high trade deficit. (For\nexample, the United States only exports around 10% of its GDP, but it has a trade deficit of over $600 billion.)\nThree factors strongly influence a nation\u2019s level of trade: the size of its economy, its geographic location, and its\nhistory of trade. Large economies like the United States can do much of their trading internally, while small\neconomies like Sweden have less ability to provide what they want internally and tend to have higher ratios of\nexports and imports to GDP. Nations that are neighbors tend to trade more, since costs of transportation and\ncommunication are lower. Moreover, some nations have long and established patterns of international trade,\nwhile others do not.\nConsequently, a relatively small economy like Sweden, with many nearby trading partners across Europe and a\nlong history of foreign trade, has a high level of trade. Brazil and India, which are fairly large economies that\nhave often sought to inhibit trade in recent decades, have lower levels of trade; whereas, the United States and\nJapan are extremely large economies that have comparatively few nearby trading partners. Both countries\nactually have quite low levels of trade by world standards. The ratio of exports to GDP in either the United\nStates or in Japan is about half of the world average.\nThebalance of tradeis a separate issue from the level of trade. The United States has a low level of trade, but\nhad enormous trade deficits for most years from the mid-1980s into the 2000s. Japan has a low level of trade\nby world standards, but has typically shown large trade surpluses in recent decades. Nations like Germany and\nthe United Kingdom have medium to high levels of trade by world standards, but Germany had a moderate\ntrade surplus in 2020, while the United Kingdom had a moderate trade deficit. Their trade picture was roughly\nin balance in the late 1990s. Sweden had a high level of trade and a moderate trade surplus in 2020, while\nCanada had a high level of trade and a moderate trade deficit that same year.\nIn short, it is quite possible for nations with a relatively low level of trade, expressed as a percentage of GDP, to\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23.6 \u2022 The Difference between Level of Trade and the Trade Balance 575\nhave relatively large trade deficits. It is also quite possible for nations with a near balance between exports and\nimports to worry about the consequences of high levels of trade for the economy. It is not inconsistent to\nbelieve that a high level of trade is potentially beneficial to an economy, because of the way it allows nations to\nplay to their comparative advantages, and to also be concerned about any macroeconomic instability caused\nby a long-term pattern of large trade deficits. The following Clear It Up feature discusses how this sort of\ndynamic played out in Colonial India.\nCLEAR IT UP\nAre trade surpluses always beneficial? Considering Colonial India.\nIndia was formally under British rule from 1858 to 1947. During that time, India consistently had trade surpluses\nwith Great Britain. Anyone who believes that trade surpluses are a sign of economic strength and dominance while\ntrade deficits are a sign of economic weakness must find this pattern odd, since it would mean that colonial India\nwas successfully dominating and exploiting Great Britain for almost a century\u2014which was not true.\nInstead, India\u2019s trade surpluses with Great Britain meant that each year there was an overall flow of financial capital\nfrom India to Great Britain. In India, many heavily criticized this financial capital flow as the \u201cdrain,\u201d and they viewed\neliminating the financial capital drain as one of the many reasons why India would benefit from achieving\nindependence.\nFinal Thoughts about Trade Balances\nTrade deficits can be a good or a bad sign for an economy, and trade surpluses can be a good or a bad sign.\nEven a trade balance of zero\u2014which just means that a nation is neither a net borrower nor lender in the\ninternational economy\u2014can be either a good or bad sign. The fundamental economic question is not whether a\nnation\u2019s economy is borrowing or lending at all, but whether the particular borrowing or lending in the\nparticular economic conditions of that country makes sense.\nIt is interesting to reflect on how public attitudes toward trade deficits and surpluses might change if we could\nsomehow change the labels that people and the news media affix to them. If we called a trade deficit \u201cattracting\nforeign financial capital\u201d\u2014which accurately describes what a trade deficit means\u2014then trade deficits might\nlook more attractive. Conversely, if we called a trade surplus \u201cshipping financial capital abroad\u201d\u2014which\naccurately captures what a trade surplus does\u2014then trade surpluses might look less attractive. Either way, the\nkey to understanding trade balances is to understand the relationships between flows of trade and flows of\ninternational payments, and what these relationships imply about the causes, benefits, and risks of different\nkinds of trade balances. The first step along this journey of understanding is to move beyond knee-jerk\nreactions to terms like \u201ctrade surplus,\u201d \u201ctrade balance,\u201d and \u201ctrade deficit.\u201d\nBRING IT HOME\nMore than Meets the Eye in the Congo\nNow that you see the big picture, you undoubtedly realize that all of the economic choices you make, such as\ndepositing savings or investing in an international mutual fund, do influence the flow of goods and services as well\nas the flows of money around the world.\nYou now know that a trade surplus does not necessarily tell us whether an economy is performing well or not. The\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo ran a trade surplus in 2013, as we learned in the beginning of the chapter. Yet its\ncurrent account balance was \u2013$2.8 billion. However, the return of political stability and the rebuilding in the\naftermath of the civil war there has meant a flow of investment and financial capital into the country. In this case, a\nnegative current account balance means the country is being rebuilt\u2014and that is a good thing. 576 23 \u2022 Key Terms\nKey Terms\nbalance of trade (trade balance)the gap, if any, between a nation\u2019s exports and imports\ncurrent account balance a broad measure of the balance of trade that includes trade in goods and services, as\nwell as international flows of income and foreign aid\nexports of goods and services as a percentage of GDP the dollar value of exports divided by the dollar value\nof a country\u2019s GDP\nfinancial capital the international flows of money that facilitates trade and investment\nmerchandise trade balance the balance of trade looking only at goods\nnational savings and investment identity the total of private savings and public savings (a government\nbudget surplus)\nunilateral transfers \u201cone-way payments\u201d that governments, private entities, or individuals make that they\nsent abroad with nothing received in return\nKey Concepts and Summary\n23.1Measuring Trade Balances\nThe trade balance measures the gap between a country\u2019s exports and its imports. In most high-income\neconomies, goods comprise less than half of a country\u2019s total production, while services comprise more than\nhalf. The last two decades have seen a surge in international trade in services; however, most global trade still\ntakes the form of goods rather than services. The current account balance includes the trade in goods,\nservices, and money flowing into and out of a country from investments and unilateral transfers.\n23.2Trade Balances in Historical and International Context\nThe United States developed large trade surpluses in the early 1980s, swung back to a tiny trade surplus in\n1991, and then had even larger trade deficits in the late 1990s and early 2000s. As we will see below, a trade\ndeficit necessarily means a net inflow of financial capital from abroad, while a trade surplus necessarily means\na net outflow of financial capital from an economy to other countries.\n23.3Trade Balances and Flows of Financial Capital\nInternational flows of goods and services are closely connected to the international flows of financial capital. A\ncurrent account deficit means that, after taking all the flows of payments from goods, services, and income\ntogether, the country is a net borrower from the rest of the world. A current account surplus is the opposite and\nmeans the country is a net lender to the rest of the world.\n23.4The National Saving and Investment Identity\nThe national saving and investment identity is based on the relationship that the total quantity of financial\ncapital supplied from all sources must equal the total quantity of financial capital demanded from all sources.\nIf S is private saving, T is taxes, G is government spending, M is imports, X is exports, and I is investment, then\nfor an economy with a current account deficit and a budget deficit:\nA recession tends to increase the trade balance (meaning a higher trade surplus or lower trade deficit), while\neconomic boom will tend to decrease the trade balance (meaning a lower trade surplus or a larger trade\ndeficit).\n23.5The Pros and Cons of Trade Deficits and Surpluses\nTrade surpluses are no guarantee of economic health, and trade deficits are no guarantee of economic\nweakness. Either trade deficits or trade surpluses can work out well or poorly, depending on whether a\ngovernment wisely invests the corresponding flows of financial capital.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23 \u2022 Self-Check Questions 577\n23.6The Difference between Level of Trade and the Trade Balance\nThere is a difference between the level of a country\u2019s trade and the balance of trade. The government measures\nits level of trade by the percentage of exports out of GDP, or the size of the economy. Small economies that have\nnearby trading partners and a history of international trade will tend to have higher levels of trade. Larger\neconomies with few nearby trading partners and a limited history of international trade will tend to have lower\nlevels of trade. The level of trade is different from the trade balance. The level of trade depends on a country\u2019s\nhistory of trade, its geography, and the size of its economy. A country\u2019s balance of trade is the dollar difference\nbetween its exports and imports.\nTrade deficits and trade surpluses are not necessarily good or bad\u2014it depends on the circumstances. Even if a\ncountry is borrowing, if it invests that money in productivity-boosting investments it can lead to an\nimprovement in long-term economic growth.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

Between 1990 and\n2006, the U.S. housing market grew. Homeownership rates grew from 64% to a high of over 69% between 2004 and\n2005. For many people, this was a period in which they could either buy first homes or buy a larger and more\nexpensive home. During this time mortgage values tripled. Housing became more accessible to Americans and was\nconsidered to be a safe financial investment.Figure 24.2shows how new single family home sales peaked in 2005\nat 1,279,000 units. 582 24 \u2022 The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model\nFIGURE24.2New Single Family Houses SoldFrom the early 1990s up through 2005, the number of new single\nfamily houses sold rose steadily. In 2006, the number dropped dramatically and this dramatic decline continued\nthrough 2011. Beginning in 2012, the number of new houses sold began to climb back up. (Source: U.S. Census\nBureau)\nThe housing bubble began to show signs of bursting in 2005, as delinquency and late payments began to grow and\nan oversupply of new homes on the market became apparent. Dropping home values contributed to a decrease in\nthe overall wealth of the household sector and caused homeowners to pull back on spending. Several mortgage\nlenders were forced to file for bankruptcy because homeowners were not making their payments, and by 2008 the\nproblem had spread throughout the financial markets. Lenders clamped down on credit and the housing bubble\nburst. Financial markets were now in crisis and unable or unwilling to even extend credit to credit-worthy\ncustomers.\nThe housing bubble and the crisis in the financial markets were major contributors to the Great Recession that led to\nunemployment rates over 10% and falling GDP. While the United States is still recovering from the impact of the\nGreat Recession, it has made substantial progress in restoring financial market stability through implementing\naggressive fiscal and monetary policy.\nThe economic history of the United States is cyclical in nature with recessions and expansions. Some of these\nfluctuations are severe, such as the economic downturn that occurred during the Great Depression in the 1930s\nwhich lasted several years. Why does the economy grow at different rates in different years? What are the causes of\nthe cyclical behavior of the economy? This chapter will introduce an important model, the aggregate\ndemand\u2013aggregate supply model, to begin our understanding of why economies expand and contract over time.\nClick to view content(https://openstax.org/books/principles-economics-3e/pages/24-introduction-to-the-\naggregate-supplyaggregate-demand-model)\nNew One-Family Houses Sold in the United States.\nA key part of macroeconomics is the use of models to analyze macro issues and problems. How is the rate of\neconomic growth connected to changes in the unemployment rate? Is there a reason whyunemploymentand\ninflationseem to move in opposite directions: lower unemployment and higher inflation from 1997 to 2000,\nhigher unemployment and lower inflation in the early 2000s, lower unemployment and higher inflation in the\nmid-2000s, and then higher unemployment and lower inflation in 2009? Why did the current account deficit\nrise so high, but then decline in 2009?\nTo analyze questions like these, we must move beyond discussing macroeconomic issues one at a time, and\nbegin building economic models that will capture the relationships and interconnections between them. The\nnext three chapters take up this task. This chapter introduces the macroeconomic model ofaggregate supply\nandaggregate demand, how the two interact to reach a macroeconomic equilibrium, and how shifts in\naggregate demand or aggregate supply will affect that equilibrium. This chapter also relates the model of\naggregate supply and aggregate demand to the three goals of economic policy (growth, unemployment, and\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24.1 \u2022 Macroeconomic Perspectives on Demand and Supply 583\ninflation), and provides a framework for thinking about many of the connections and tradeoffs between these\ngoals. The chapter onThe Keynesian Perspectivefocuses on the macroeconomy in the short run, where\naggregate demand plays a crucial role. The chapter onThe Neoclassical Perspectiveexplores the\nmacroeconomy in the long run, where aggregate supply plays a crucial role.\n24.1Macroeconomic Perspectives on Demand and Supply\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain Say\u2019s Law and understand why it primarily applies in the long run\n\u2022 Explain Keynes\u2019 Law and understand why it primarily applies in the short run\nMacroeconomists over the last two centuries have often divided into two groups: those who argue that supply\nis the most important determinant of the size of the macroeconomy while demand just tags along, and those\nwho argue that demand is the most important factor in the size of the macroeconomy while supply just tags\nalong.\nSay\u2019s Law and the Macroeconomics of Supply\nThose economists who emphasize the role of supply in the macroeconomy often refer to the work of a famous\nearly nineteenth century French economist namedJean-Baptiste Say(1767\u20131832).Say\u2019s lawis: \u201cSupply\ncreates its own demand.\u201d As a matter of historical accuracy, it seems clear that Say never actually wrote down\nthis law and that it oversimplifies his beliefs, but the law lives on as useful shorthand for summarizing a point\nof view.\nThe intuition behind Say\u2019s law is that each time a good or service is produced and sold, it generates income\nthat is earned for someone: a worker, a manager, an owner, or those who are workers, managers, and owners at\nfirms that supply inputs along the chain of production. We alluded to this earlier in our discussion of the\nNational Income approach to measuring GDP. The forces of supply and demand in individual markets will\ncause prices to rise and fall. The bottom line remains, however, that every sale represents income to someone,\nand so, Say\u2019s law argues, a given value of supply must create an equivalent value of demand somewhere else in\nthe economy. Because Jean-Baptiste Say,Adam Smith, and other economists writing around the turn of the\nnineteenth century who discussed this view were known as \u201cclassical\u201d economists, modern economists who\ngenerally subscribe to the Say\u2019s law view on the importance of supply for determining the size of the\nmacroeconomy are calledneoclassical economists.\nIfsupplyalways creates exactly enough demand at the macroeconomic level, then (as Say himself recognized)\nit is hard to understand why periods of recession and high unemployment should ever occur. To be sure, even\nif total supply always creates an equal amount of total demand, the economy could still experience a situation\nof some firms earning profits while other firms suffer losses. Nevertheless, arecessionis not a situation where\nall business failures are exactly counterbalanced by an offsetting number of successes. A recession is a\nsituation in which the economy as a whole is shrinking in size, business failures outnumber the remaining\nsuccess stories, and many firms end up suffering losses and laying off workers.\nSay\u2019s law that supply creates its owndemanddoes seem a good approximation for the long run. Over periods\nof some years or decades, as the productive power of an economy to supply goods and services increases, total\ndemand in the economy grows at roughly the same pace. However, over shorter time horizons of a few months\nor even years, recessions or even depressions occur in which firms, as a group, seem to face a lack of demand\nfor their products.\nKeynes\u2019 Law and the Macroeconomics of Demand\nThe alternative to Say\u2019s law, with its emphasis on supply, isKeynes\u2019 law: \u201cDemand creates its own supply.\u201d As a\nmatter of historical accuracy, just as Jean-Baptiste Say never wrote down anything as simpleminded as Say\u2019s\nlaw,John Maynard Keynesnever wrote down Keynes\u2019 law, but the law is a useful simplification that conveys a 584 24 \u2022 The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model\ncertain point of view.\nWhen Keynes wrote his influential workThe General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Moneyduring the\n1930sGreat Depression, he pointed out that during the Depression, the economy's capacity to supply goods\nand services had not changed much. U.S. unemployment rates soared higher than 20% from 1933 to 1935, but\nthe number of possible workers had not increased or decreased much. Factories closed, but machinery and\nequipment had not disappeared. Technologies that had been invented in the 1920s were not un-invented and\nforgotten in the 1930s. Thus, Keynes argued that the Great Depression\u2014and many ordinary recessions as\nwell\u2014were not caused by a drop in the ability of the economy to supply goods as measured by labor, physical\ncapital, or technology. He argued the economy often produced less than its full potential, not because it was\ntechnically impossible to produce more with the existing workers and machines, but because a lack of demand\nin the economy as a whole led to inadequate incentives for firms to produce. In such cases, he argued, the level\nof GDP in the economy was not primarily determined by the potential of what the economy could supply, but\nrather by the amount of total demand.\nKeynes\u2019 law seems to apply fairly well in the short run of a few months to a few years, when many firms\nexperience either a drop in demand for their output during a recession or so much demand that they have\ntrouble producing enough during an economic boom. However, demand cannot tell the whole macroeconomic\nstory, either. After all, if demand was all that mattered at the macroeconomic level, then the government could\nmake the economy as large as it wanted just by pumping up total demand through a large increase in the\ngovernment spending component or by legislating large tax cuts to push up the consumption component.\nEconomies do, however, face genuine limits to how much they can produce, limits determined by the quantity\nof labor, physical capital, technology, and the institutional and market structures that bring these factors of\nproduction together. These constraints on what an economy can supply at the macroeconomic level do not\ndisappear just because of an increase in demand.\nCombining Supply and Demand in Macroeconomics\nTwo insights emerge from this overview of Say\u2019s law with its emphasis on macroeconomic supply and Keynes\u2019\nlaw with its emphasis on macroeconomic demand. The first conclusion, which is not exactly a hot news flash,\nis that an economic approach focused only on the supply side or only on the demand side can be only a partial\nsuccess. We need to take into account both supply and demand. The second conclusion is that since Keynes\u2019\nlaw applies more accurately in the short run and Say\u2019s law applies more accurately in the long run, the\ntradeoffs and connections between the three goals of macroeconomics may be different in the short run and\nthe long run.\n24.2Building a Model of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain the aggregate supply curve and how it relates to real GDP and potential GDP\n\u2022 Explain the aggregate demand curve and how it is influenced by price levels\n\u2022 Interpret the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model\n\u2022 Identify the point of equilibrium in the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model\n\u2022 Define short run aggregate supply and long run aggregate supply\nTo build a useful macroeconomic model, we need a model that shows what determines total supply or total\ndemand for the economy, and how total demand and total supply interact at the macroeconomic level. We call\nthis theaggregate demand/aggregate supply model. This module will explain aggregate supply, aggregate\ndemand, and the equilibrium between them. The following modules will discuss the causes of shifts in\naggregate supply and aggregate demand.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24.2 \u2022 Building a Model of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply 585\nThe Aggregate Supply Curve and Potential GDP\nFirms make decisions about what quantity to supply based on the profits they expect to earn. They determine\nprofits, in turn, by the price of the outputs they sell and by the prices of the inputs, like labor or raw materials,\nthat they need to buy.Aggregate supply (AS)refers to the total quantity of output (i.e. real GDP) firms will\nproduce and sell. Theaggregate supply (AS) curveshows the total quantity of output (i.e. real GDP) that firms\nwill produce and sell at each price level.\nFigure 24.3shows an aggregate supply curve. In the following paragraphs, we will walk through the elements\nof the diagram one at a time: the horizontal and vertical axes, the aggregate supply curve itself, and the\nmeaning of the potential GDP vertical line.\nFIGURE24.3The Aggregate Supply CurveAggregate supply (AS) slopes up, because as the price level for outputs\nrises, with the price of inputs remaining fixed, firms have an incentive to produce more to earn higher profits. The\npotential GDP line shows the maximum that the economy can produce with full employment of workers and physical\ncapital.\nThe diagram's horizontal axis shows real GDP\u2014that is, the level of GDP adjusted for inflation. The vertical axis\nshows the price level, which measures the average price of all goods and services produced in the economy. In\nother words, the price level in the AD-AS model is what we called the GDP Deflator inThe Macroeconomic\nPerspective. Remember that the price level is different from the inflation rate. Visualize the price level as an\nindex number, like the Consumer Price Index, while the inflation rate is the percentage change in the price\nlevel over time.\nAs the price level rises, real GDP rises as well. Why? The price level on the vertical axis represents prices for\nfinal goods or outputs bought in the economy\u2014i.e. the GDP deflator\u2014not the price level for intermediate goods\nand services that are inputs to production. Thus, the AS curve describes how suppliers will react to a higher\nprice level for final outputs of goods and services, while holding the prices of inputs like labor and energy\nconstant. If firms across the economy face a situation where the price level of what they produce and sell is\nrising, but their costs of production are not rising, then the lure of higher profits will induce them to expand\nproduction. In other words, an aggregate supply curve shows how producers as a group will respond to an\nincrease in aggregate demand.\nAn AS curve's slope changes from nearly flat at its far left to nearly vertical at its far right. At the far left of the\naggregate supply curve, the level of output in the economy is far belowpotential GDP, which we define as the\namount of real GDP an economy can produce by fully employing its existing levels of labor, physical capital,\nand technology, in the context of its existing market and legal institutions. At these relatively low levels of\noutput, levels of unemployment are high, and many factories are running only part-time, or have closed their 586 24 \u2022 The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model\ndoors. In this situation, a relatively small increase in the prices of the outputs that businesses sell\u2014while\nassuming no rise in input prices\u2014can encourage a considerable surge in the quantity of aggregate supply\nbecause so many workers and factories are ready to swing into production.\nAs the GDP increases, however, some firms and industries will start running into limits: perhaps nearly all of\nthe expert workers in a certain industry will have jobs or factories in certain geographic areas or industries\nwill be running at full speed. In the AS curve's intermediate area, a higher price level for outputs continues to\nencourage a greater quantity of output\u2014but as the increasingly steep upward slope of the aggregate supply\ncurve shows, the increase in real GDP in response to a given rise in the price level will not be as large. (Read the\nfollowing Clear It Up feature to learn why the AS curve crosses potential GDP.)\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhy does AS cross potential GDP?\nEconomists typically draw the aggregate supply curve to cross the potential GDP line. This shape may seem\npuzzling: How can an economy produce at an output level which is higher than its \u201cpotential\u201d or \u201cfull employment\u201d\nGDP? The economic intuition here is that if prices for outputs were high enough, producers would make fanatical\nefforts to produce: all workers would be on double-overtime, all machines would run 24 hours a day, seven days a\nweek. Such hyper-intense production would go beyond using potential labor and physical capital resources fully, to\nusing them in a way that is not sustainable in the long term. Thus, it is possible for production to sprint above\npotential GDP, but only in the short run.\nAt the far right, the aggregate supply curve becomes nearly vertical. At this quantity, higher prices for outputs\ncannot encourage additional output, because even if firms want to expand output, the inputs of labor and\nmachinery in the economy are fully employed. In this example, the vertical line in the exhibit shows that\npotential GDP occurs at a total output of 9,500. When an economy is operating at its potential GDP, machines\nand factories are running at capacity, and the unemployment rate is relatively low\u2014at the natural rate of\nunemployment. For this reason, potential GDP is sometimes also calledfull-employment GDP.\nThe Aggregate Demand Curve\nAggregate demand (AD)refers to the amount of total spending on domestic goods and services in an\neconomy. (Strictly speaking, AD is what economists call total planned expenditure. We will further explain this\ndistinction in the appendixThe Expenditure-Output Model. For now, just think of aggregate demand as total\nspending.) It includes all four components of demand: consumption, investment, government spending, and\nnet exports (exports minus imports). This demand is determined by a number of factors, but one of them is the\nprice level\u2014recall though, that the price level is an index number such as the GDP deflator that measures the\naverage price of the things we buy. Theaggregate demand (AD) curveshows the total spending on domestic\ngoods and services at each price level.\nFigure 24.4presents an aggregate demand (AD) curve. Just like the aggregate supply curve, the horizontal axis\nshows real GDP and the vertical axis shows the price level. The AD curve slopes down, which means that\nincreases in the price level of outputs lead to a lower quantity of total spending. The reasons behind this shape\nare related to how changes in the price level affect the different components of aggregate demand. The\nfollowing components comprise aggregate demand: consumption spending (C), investment spending (I),\ngovernment spending (G), and spending on exports (X) minus imports (M): C + I + G + X \u2013 M.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24.2 \u2022 Building a Model of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply 587\nFIGURE24.4The Aggregate Demand CurveAggregate demand (AD) slopes down, showing that, as the price level\nrises, the amount of total spending on domestic goods and services declines.\nThe wealth effect holds that as the price level increases, the buying power of savings that people have stored up\nin bank accounts and other assets will diminish, eaten away to some extent by inflation. Because a rise in the\nprice level reduces people\u2019s wealth, consumption spending will fall as the price level rises.\nThe interest rate effect is that as prices for outputs rise, the same purchases will take more money or credit to\naccomplish. This additional demand for money and credit will push interest rates higher. In turn, higher\ninterest rates will reduce borrowing by businesses for investment purposes and reduce borrowing by\nhouseholds for homes and cars\u2014thus reducing consumption and investment spending.\nThe foreign price effect points out that if prices rise in the United States while remaining fixed in other\ncountries, then goods in the United States will be relatively more expensive compared to goods in the rest of\nthe world. U.S.exportswill be relatively more expensive, and the quantity of exports sold will fall. U.S.imports\nfrom abroad will be relatively cheaper, so the quantity of imports will rise. Thus, a higher domestic price level,\nrelative to price levels in other countries, will reduce net export expenditures.\nAmong economists all three of these effects are controversial, in part because they do not seem to be very\nlarge. For this reason, the aggregate demand curve inFigure 24.4slopes downward fairly steeply. The steep\nslope indicates that a higher price level for final outputs reduces aggregate demand for all three of these\nreasons, but that the change in the quantity of aggregate demand as a result of changes in price level is not\nvery large.\nRead the following Work It Out feature to learn how to interpret the AD/AS model. In this example, aggregate\nsupply, aggregate demand, and the price level are given for the imaginary country of Xurbia.\nWORK IT OUT\nInterpreting the AD/AS Model\nTable 24.1shows information on aggregate supply, aggregate demand, and the price level for the imaginary\ncountry of Xurbia.

What is the\nequilibrium?\nStep 1. Draw your x- and y-axis. Label the x-axis Real GDP and the y-axis Price Level.\nStep 2. Plot AD on your graph.\nStep 3. Plot AS on your graph.\nStep 4. Look atFigure 24.5which provides a visual to aid in your analysis.\nFIGURE24.5The AD/AS CurvesAD and AS curves created from the data inTable 24.1.\nStep 5. Determine where AD and AS intersect. This is the equilibrium with price level at 130 and real GDP at\n$680.\nStep 6. Look at the graph to determine where equilibrium is located. We can see that this equilibrium is fairly far\nfrom where the AS curve becomes near-vertical (or at least quite steep) which seems to start at about $750 of\nreal output. This implies that the economy is not close to potential GDP. Thus, unemployment will be high. In the\nrelatively flat part of the AS curve, where the equilibrium occurs, changes in the price level will not be a major\nconcern, since such changes are likely to be small.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24.2 \u2022 Building a Model of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply 589\nStep 7. Determine what the steep portion of the AS curve indicates. Where the AS curve is steep, the economy is\nat or close to potential GDP.\nStep 8. Draw conclusions from the given information:\n\u2022 If equilibrium occurs in the flat range of AS, then economy is not close to potential GDP and will be\nexperiencing unemployment, but stable price level.\n\u2022 If equilibrium occurs in the steep range of AS, then the economy is close or at potential GDP and will be\nexperiencing rising price levels or inflationary pressures, but will have a low unemployment rate.\nEquilibrium in the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model\nThe intersection of the aggregate supply and aggregate demand curves shows the equilibrium level of real GDP\nand the equilibrium price level in the economy. At a relatively low price level for output, firms have little\nincentive to produce, although consumers would be willing to purchase a large quantity of output. As the price\nlevel rises, aggregate supply rises and aggregate demand falls until the equilibrium point is reached.\nFigure 24.6combines the AS curve fromFigure 24.3and the AD curve fromFigure 24.4and places them both\non a single diagram. In this example, the equilibrium point occurs at point E, at a price level of 90 and an\noutput level of 8,800.\nFIGURE24.6Aggregate Supply and Aggregate DemandThe equilibrium, where aggregate supply (AS) equals\naggregate demand (AD), occurs at a price level of 90 and an output level of 8,800.\nConfusion sometimes arises between the aggregate supply and aggregate demand model and the\nmicroeconomic analysis of demand and supply in particular markets for goods, services, labor, and capital.\nRead the following Clear It Up feature to gain an understanding of whether AS and AD are macro or micro.\nCLEAR IT UP\nAre AS and AD macro or micro?\nThese aggregate supply and demand models and the microeconomic analysis of demand and supply in particular\nmarkets for goods, services, labor, and capital have a superficial resemblance, but they also have many underlying\ndifferences.\nFor example, the vertical and horizontal axes have distinctly different meanings in macroeconomic and 590 24 \u2022 The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model\nmicroeconomic diagrams. The vertical axis of a microeconomic demand and supply diagram expresses a price (or\nwage or rate of return) for an individual good or service. This price is implicitly relative: it is intended to be compared\nwith the prices of other products (for example, the price of pizza relative to the price of fried chicken). In contrast,\nthe vertical axis of an aggregate supply and aggregate demand diagram expresses the level of a price index like the\nConsumer Price Index or the GDP deflator\u2014combining a wide array of prices from across the economy. The price\nlevel is absolute: it is not intended to be compared to any other prices since it is essentially the average price of all\nproducts in an economy. The horizontal axis of a microeconomic supply and demand curve measures the quantity of\na particular good or service. In contrast, the horizontal axis of the aggregate demand and aggregate supply diagram\nmeasures GDP, which is the sum of all the final goods and services produced in the economy, not the quantity in a\nspecific market.\nIn addition, the economic reasons for the shapes of the curves in the macroeconomic model are different from the\nreasons behind the shapes of the curves in microeconomic models. Demand curves for individual goods or services\nslope down primarily because of the existence of substitute goods, not the wealth effects, interest rate, and foreign\nprice effects associated with aggregate demand curves. The slopes of individual supply and demand curves can\nhave a variety of different slopes, depending on the extent to which quantity demanded and quantity supplied react\nto price in that specific market, but the slopes of the AS and AD curves are much the same in every diagram\n(although as we shall see in later chapters, short-run and long-run perspectives will emphasize different parts of the\nAS curve).\nIn short, just because the AD/AS diagram has two lines that cross, do not assume that it is the same as every other\ndiagram where two lines cross. The intuitions and meanings of the macro and micro diagrams are only distant\ncousins from different branches of the economics family tree.\nDefining SRAS and LRAS\nIn the Clear It Up feature titled \u201cWhy does AS cross potential GDP?\u201d we differentiated between short run\nchanges in aggregate supply which the AS curve shows and long run changes in aggregate supply which the\nvertical line at potential GDP defines. In the short run, if demand is too low (or too high), it is possible for\nproducers to supply less GDP (or more GDP) than potential. In the long run, however, producers are limited to\nproducing at potential GDP. For this reason, we may also refer to what we have been calling the AS curve as the\nshort run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve. We may also refer to the vertical line at potential GDP as thelong\nrun aggregate supply (LRAS) curve.\n24.3Shifts in Aggregate Supply\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain how productivity growth changes the aggregate supply curve\n\u2022 Explain how changes in input prices change the aggregate supply curve\nThe original equilibrium in the AD/AS diagram will shift to a new equilibrium if the AS or AD curve shifts.\nWhen the aggregate supply curve shifts to the right, then at every price level, producers supply a greater\nquantity of real GDP. When the AS curve shifts to the left, then at every price level, producers supply a lower\nquantity of real GDP. This module discusses two of the most important factors that can lead to shifts in the AS\ncurve: productivity growth and changes in input prices.\nHow Productivity Growth Shifts the AS Curve\nIn the long run, the most important factor shifting the AS curve isproductivity growth. Productivity means\nhow much output can be produced with a given quantity of labor. One measure of this is output per worker or\nGDP per capita. Over time, productivity grows so that the same quantity of labor can produce more output.\nHistorically, the real growth in GDP per capita in an advanced economy like the United States has averaged\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24.3 \u2022 Shifts in Aggregate Supply 591\nabout 2% to 3% per year, but productivity growth has been faster during certain extended periods like the\n1960s and the late 1990s through the early 2000s, or slower during periods like the 1970s. A higher level of\nproductivity shifts the AS curve to the right, because with improved productivity, firms can produce a greater\nquantity of output at every price level.Figure 24.7(a) shows an outward shift in productivity over two time\nperiods. The AS curve shifts out from SRAS to SRAS to SRAS , and the equilibrium shifts from E to E to E .\n0 1 2 0 1 2\nNote that with increased productivity, workers can produce more GDP. Thus, full employment corresponds to a\nhigher level of potential GDP, which we show as a rightward shift in LRAS from LRAS to LRAS to LRAS .\n0 1 2\nFIGURE24.7Shifts in Aggregate Supply(a) The rise in productivity causes the SRAS curve to shift to the right. The\noriginal equilibrium E is at the intersection of AD and SRAS . When SRAS shifts right, then the new equilibrium E is\n0 0 1\nat the intersection of AD and SRAS , and then yet another equilibrium, E , is at the intersection of AD and SRAS .\n1 2 2\nShifts in SRAS to the right, lead to a greater level of output and to downward pressure on the price level. (b) A higher\nprice for inputs means that at any given price level for outputs, a lower real GDP will be produced so aggregate\nsupply will shift to the left from SRAS to SRAS . The new equilibrium, E , has a reduced quantity of output and a\n0 1 1\nhigher price level than the original equilibrium (E ).\n0\nA shift in the SRAS curve to the right will result in a greater real GDP and downward pressure on the price\nlevel, if aggregate demand remains unchanged. However, if this shift in SRAS results from gains in productivity\ngrowth, which we typically measure in terms of a few percentage points per year, the effect will be relatively\nsmall over a few months or even a couple of years. Recall how inChoice in a World of Scarcity, we said that a\nnation's production possibilities frontier is fixed in the short run, but shifts out in the long run? This is the\nsame phenomenon using a different model.\nHow Changes in Input Prices Shift the AS Curve\nHigher prices for inputs that are widely used across the entire economy can have a macroeconomic impact on\naggregate supply. Examples of such widely used inputs include labor and energy products. Increases in the\nprice of such inputs will cause the SRAS curve to shift to the left, which means that at each given price level for\noutputs, a higher price for inputs will discourage production because it will reduce the possibilities for earning\nprofits.Figure 24.7(b) shows the aggregate supply curve shifting to the left, from SRAS to SRAS , causing the\n0 1\nequilibrium to move from E to E . The movement from the original equilibrium of E to the new equilibrium\n0 1 0\nof E will bring a nasty set of effects: reduced GDP or recession, higher unemployment because the economy is\n1 592 24 \u2022 The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model\nnow further away from potential GDP, and an inflationary higher price level as well. For example, the U.S.\neconomy experienced recessions in 1974\u20131975, 1980\u20131982, 1990\u201391, 2001, and 2007\u20132009 that were each\npreceded or accompanied by a rise in the key input of oil prices. In the 1970s, this pattern of a shift to the left\nin SRAS leading to a stagnant economy with high unemployment and inflation was nicknamedstagflation.\nConversely, a decline in the price of a key input like oil will shift the SRAS curve to the right, providing an\nincentive for more to be produced at every given price level for outputs. From 1985 to 1986, for example, the\naverage price of crude oil fell by almost half, from $24 a barrel to $12 a barrel. Similarly, from 1997 to 1998,\nthe price of a barrel of crude oil dropped from $17 per barrel to $11 per barrel. In both cases, the plummeting\noil price led to a situation like that which we presented earlier inFigure 24.7(a), where the outward shift of\nSRAS to the right allowed the economy to expand, unemployment to fall, and inflation to decline.\nAlong with energy prices, two other key inputs that may shift the SRAS curve are the cost of labor, or wages,\nand the cost of imported goods that we use as inputs for other products. In these cases as well, the lesson is\nthat lower prices for inputs cause SRAS to shift to the right, while higher prices cause it to shift back to the left.\nNote that, unlike changes in productivity, changes in input prices do not generally cause LRAS to shift, only\nSRAS.\nOther Supply Shocks\nThe aggregate supply curve can also shift due to shocks to input goods or labor. For example, an unexpected\nearly freeze could destroy a large number of agricultural crops, a shock that would shift the AS curve to the left\nsince there would be fewer agricultural products available at any given price.\nSimilarly, shocks to the labor market can affect aggregate supply. An extreme example might be an overseas\nwar that required a large number of workers to cease their ordinary production in order to go fight for their\ncountry. In this case, SRAS and LRAS would both shift to the left because there would be fewer workers\navailable to produce goods at any given price.\nAnother example in this vein is a pandemic, like the COVID-19 pandemic. A pandemic causes many workers to\nbecome sick, temporarily reducing the supply of workers by a large amount. Further, workers might be\ncautious to go back to work in a pandemic because of health or safety concerns. While the shock to labor\nsupply might not be permanent, it can cause a reduction in the supply of many goods and services, reflected in\na leftward shift in the short-run aggregate supply curve. At various points during the COVID-19-induced\npandemic, computer chips for automobiles, meat, and other consumer services were in short supply because\nof worker shortages around the world.\n24.4Shifts in Aggregate Demand\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain how imports influence aggregate demand\n\u2022 Identify ways in which business confidence and consumer confidence can affect aggregate demand\n\u2022 Explain how government policy can change aggregate demand\n\u2022 Evaluate why economists disagree on the topic of tax cuts\nAs we mentioned previously, the components of aggregate demand are consumption spending (C), investment\nspending (I), government spending (G), and spending on exports (X) minus imports (M). (Read the following\nClear It Up feature for explanation of why imports are subtracted from exports and what this means for\naggregate demand.) A shift of the AD curve to the right means that at least one of these components increased\nso that a greater amount of total spending would occur at every price level. A shift of the AD curve to the left\nmeans that at least one of these components decreased so that a lesser amount of total spending would occur\nat every price level.The Keynesian Perspectivewill discuss the components of aggregate demand and the\nfactors that affect them. Here, the discussion will sketch two broad categories that could cause AD curves to\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24.4 \u2022 Shifts in Aggregate Demand 593\nshift: changes in consumer or firm behavior and changes in government tax or spending policy.\nCLEAR IT UP\nDo imports diminish aggregate demand?\nWe have seen that the formula for aggregate demand is AD = C + I + G + X - M, where M is the total value of imported\ngoods. Why is there a minus sign in front of imports? Does this mean that more imports will result in a lower level of\naggregate demand? The short answer is yes, because aggregate demand is defined as total demand for domestically\nproduced goods and services.\nWhen an American buys a foreign product, for example, it gets counted along with all the other consumption. Thus,\nthe income generated does not go to American producers, but rather to producers in another country. It would be\nwrong to count this as part of domestic demand. Therefore, imports added in consumption are subtracted back out\nin the M term of the equation.\nBecause of the way in which we write the demand equation, it is easy to make the mistake of thinking that imports\nare bad for the economy. Just keep in mind that every negative number in the M term has a corresponding positive\nnumber in the C or I or G term, and they always cancel out.\nHow Changes by Consumers and Firms Can Affect AD\nWhen consumers feel more confident about the future of the economy, they tend to consume more. Ifbusiness\nconfidenceis high, then firms tend to spend more on investment, believing that the future payoff from that\ninvestment will be substantial. Conversely, if consumer or business confidence drops, then consumption and\ninvestment spending decline.\nThe University of Michigan publishes a survey ofconsumer confidenceand constructs an index of consumer\nconfidence each month. The survey results are then reported athttp://www.sca.isr.umich.edu\n(http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/), which break down the change in consumer confidence among different\nincome levels. According to that index, consumer confidence averaged around 90 prior to the Great Recession,\nand then it fell to below 60 in late 2008, which was the lowest it had been since 1980. During the 2010s,\nconfidence has climbed from a 2011 low of 55.8 back to a level in the upper 90s, before falling to the lower 70s\nin 2020 due to the COIVD-19 pandemic, which economists consider close to a healthy state.\nThe Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD) publishes one measure of business\nconfidence: the \"business tendency surveys\". The OECD collects business opinion survey data for 21 countries\non future selling prices and employment, among other business climate elements. After sharply declining\nduring the Great Recession, the measure has risen above zero again and is back to long-term averages (the\nindicator dips below zero when business outlook is weaker than usual). Of course, either of these survey\nmeasures is not very precise. They can however, suggest when confidence is rising or falling, as well as when it\nis relatively high or low compared to the past.\nBecause economists associate a rise in confidence with higher consumption and investment demand, it will\nlead to an outward shift in the AD curve, and a move of the equilibrium, from E to E , to a higher quantity of\n0 1\noutput and a higher price level, asFigure 24.8(a) shows.\nConsumer and business confidence often reflect macroeconomic realities; for example, confidence is usually\nhigh when the economy is growing briskly and low during a recession. However, economic confidence can\nsometimes rise or fall for reasons that do not have a close connection to the immediate economy, like a risk of\nwar, election results, foreign policy events, or a pessimistic prediction about the future by a prominent public\nfigure. U.S. presidents, for example, must be careful in their public pronouncements about the economy. If they\noffer economic pessimism, they risk provoking a decline in confidence that reduces consumption and\ninvestment and shifts AD to the left, and in a self-fulfilling prophecy, contributes to causing the recession that 594 24 \u2022 The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model\nthe president warned against in the first place.Figure 24.8(b) shows a shift of AD to the left, and the\ncorresponding movement of the equilibrium, from E to E , to a lower quantity of output and a lower price\n0 1\nlevel.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/consumerconfid)for data on consumer confidence.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/businessconfid)for data on business confidence.\nFIGURE24.8Shifts in Aggregate Demand(a) An increase in consumer confidence or business confidence can shift\nAD to the right, from AD to AD . When AD shifts to the right, the new equilibrium (E ) will have a higher quantity of\n0 1 1\noutput and also a higher price level compared with the original equilibrium (E ). In this example, the new\n0\nequilibrium (E ) is also closer to potential GDP. An increase in government spending or a cut in taxes that leads to a\n1\nrise in consumer spending can also shift AD to the right. (b) A decrease in consumer confidence or business\nconfidence can shift AD to the left, from AD to AD . When AD shifts to the left, the new equilibrium (E ) will have a\n0 1 1\nlower quantity of output and also a lower price level compared with the original equilibrium (E ). In this example,\n0\nthe new equilibrium (E ) is also farther below potential GDP. A decrease in government spending or higher taxes that\n1\nleads to a fall in consumer spending can also shift AD to the left.\nHow Government Macroeconomic Policy Choices Can Shift AD\nGovernment spending is one component of AD. Thus, higher government spending will cause AD to shift to the\nright, as inFigure 24.8(a), while lower government spending will cause AD to shift to the left, as inFigure 24.8\n(b). For example, in the United States, government spending declined by 3.2% of GDP during the 1990s, from\n21% of GDP in 1991, and to 17.8% of GDP in 1998. However, from 2005 to 2009, the peak of the Great\nRecession, government spending increased from 19% of GDP to 21.4% of GDP. If changes of a few percentage\npoints of GDP seem small to you, remember that since GDP was about $14.4 trillion in 2009, a seemingly small\nchange of 2% of GDP is equal to close to $300 billion. Since 2009, government expenditures have gone back\ndown to around 17\u201318% of GDP, although in 2020 they rose to 18.5%.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24.4 \u2022 Shifts in Aggregate Demand 595\nTax policy can affect consumption and investment spending, too. Tax cuts for individuals will tend to increase\nconsumption demand, whiletaxincreases will tend to diminish it. Tax policy can also pump up investment\ndemand by offering lower tax rates for corporations or tax reductions that benefit specific kinds of investment.\nShifting C or I will shift the AD curve as a whole.\nDuring arecession, when unemployment is high and many businesses are suffering low profits or even losses,\nthe U.S. Congress often passes tax cuts. During the 2001 recession, for example, the U.S. Congress enacted a\ntax cut into law. At such times, the political rhetoric often focuses on how people experiencing hard times need\nrelief from taxes. The aggregate supply and aggregate demand framework, however, offers a complementary\nrationale, asFigure 24.9illustrates. The original equilibrium during a recession is at point E , relatively far\n0\nfrom the full employment level of output. The tax cut, by increasing consumption, shifts the AD curve to the\nright. At the new equilibrium (E ), real GDP rises and unemployment falls and, because in this diagram the\n1\neconomy has not yet reached its potential or full employment level of GDP, any rise in the price level remains\nmuted. Read the following Clear It Up feature to consider the question of whether economists favor tax cuts or\noppose them.\nFIGURE24.9Recession and Full Employment in the AD/AS ModelWhether the economy is in a recession is\nillustrated in the AD/AS model by how close the equilibrium is to the potential GDP line as indicated by the vertical\nLRAS line. In this example, the level of output Y at the equilibrium E is relatively far from the potential GDP line, so\n0 0\nit can represent an economy in recession, well below the full employment level of GDP. In contrast, the level of\noutput Y at the equilibrium E is relatively close to potential GDP, and so it would represent an economy with a\n1 1\nlower unemployment rate.\nCLEAR IT UP\nDo economists favor tax cuts or oppose them?\nOne of the most fundamental divisions in American politics over the last few decades has been between those who\nbelieve that the government should cut taxes substantially and those who disagree. Ronald Reagan rode into the\npresidency in 1980 partly because of his promise, soon carried out, to enact a substantial tax cut. George Bush lost\nhis bid for reelection against Bill Clinton in 1992 partly because he had broken his 1988 promise: \u201cRead my lips! No\nnew taxes!\u201d In the 2000 presidential election, both George W. Bush and Al Gore advocated substantial tax cuts and\nBush succeeded in pushing a tax cut package through Congress early in 2001. More recently in 2017 and 2018,\nDonald Trump initiated a new round of tax cuts throughout the economy, and President Biden promised his own set 596 24 \u2022 The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model\nof tax cuts in his 2021 spending bills.\nWhat side do economists take? Do they support broad tax cuts or oppose them? The answer, unsatisfying to zealots\non both sides, is that it depends. One issue is whether equally large government spending cuts accompany the tax\ncuts. Economists differ, as does any broad cross-section of the public, on how large government spending should be\nand what programs the government might cut back. A second issue, more relevant to the discussion in this chapter,\nconcerns how close the economy is to the full employment output level. In a recession, when the AD and AS curves\nintersect far below the full employment level, tax cuts can make sense as a way of shifting AD to the right. However,\nwhen the economy is already performing extremely well, tax cuts may shift AD so far to the right as to generate\ninflationary pressures, with little gain to GDP.\nWith the AD/AS framework in mind, many economists might readily believe that the 1981 Reagan tax cuts, which\ntook effect just after two serious recessions, were beneficial economic policy. Similarly, Congress enacted the 2001\nBush tax cuts and the 2009 Obama tax cuts during recessions. However, some of the same economists who favor\ntax cuts during recession would be much more dubious about identical tax cuts at a time the economy is performing\nwell and cyclical unemployment is low.\nGovernment spending and tax rate changes can be useful tools to affect aggregate demand. We will discuss\nthese in greater detail in theGovernment Budgets and Fiscal Policychapter andThe Impacts of Government\nBorrowing. Other policy tools can shift the aggregate demand curve as well. For example, as we will discuss in\ntheMonetary Policy and Bank Regulationchapter, the Federal Reserve can affect interest rates and credit\navailability. Higher interest rates tend to discourage borrowing and thus reduce both household spending on\nbig-ticket items like houses and cars and investment spending by business. Conversely, lower interest rates\nwill stimulate consumption and investment demand. Interest rates can also affect exchange rates, which in\nturn will have effects on the export and import components of aggregate demand.\nClarifying the details of these alternative policies and how they affect the components of aggregate demand\ncan wait forThe Keynesian Perspectivechapter. Here, the key lesson is that a shift of the aggregate demand\ncurve to the right leads to a greater real GDP and to upward pressure on the price level. Conversely, a shift of\naggregate demand to the left leads to a lower real GDP and a lower price level. Whether these changes in output\nand price level are relatively large or relatively small, and how the change in equilibrium relates to potential\nGDP, depends on whether the shift in the AD curve is happening in the AS curve's relatively flat or relatively\nsteep portion.\n24.5How the AD/AS Model Incorporates Growth, Unemployment, and Inflation\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Use the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model to show periods of economic growth and recession\n\u2022 Explain how unemployment and inflation impact the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model\n\u2022 Evaluate the importance of the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model\nThe AD/AS model can convey a number of interlocking relationships between the three macroeconomic goals\nof growth,unemployment, and lowinflation. Moreover, the AD/AS framework is flexible enough to\naccommodate both the Keynes\u2019 law approach that focuses on aggregate demand and the short run, while also\nincluding the Say\u2019s law approach that focuses on aggregate supply and the long run. These advantages are\nconsiderable. Every model is a simplified version of the deeper reality and, in the context of the AD/AS model,\nthe three macroeconomic goals arise in ways that are sometimes indirect or incomplete. In this module, we\nconsider how the AD/AS model illustrates the three macroeconomic goals of economic growth, low\nunemployment, and low inflation.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24.5 \u2022 How the AD/AS Model Incorporates Growth, Unemployment, and Inflation 597\nGrowth and Recession in the AD/AS Diagram\nIn the AD/AS diagram, long-run economic growth due to productivity increases over time will be represented\nby a gradual shift to the right of aggregate supply. The vertical line representing potential GDP (or the \u201cfull\nemployment level of GDP\u201d) will gradually shift to the right over time as well. EarlierFigure 24.7(a) showed a\npattern of economic growth over three years, with the AS curve shifting slightly out to the right each year.\nHowever, the factors that determine the speed of this long-term economic growth rate\u2014like investment in\nphysical and human capital, technology, and whether an economy can take advantage of catch-up growth\u2014do\nnot appear directly in the AD/AS diagram.\nIn the short run, GDP falls and rises in every economy, as the economy dips into recession or expands out of\nrecession. The AD/AS diagram illustrates recessions when the equilibrium level of real GDP is substantially\nbelow potential GDP, as we see at the equilibrium point E inFigure 24.9. From another standpoint, in years of\n0\nresurgent economic growth the equilibrium will typically be close to potential GDP, as equilibrium point E in\n1\nthat earlier figure shows.\nUnemployment in the AD/AS Diagram\nWe described two types of unemployment in theUnemploymentchapter. Short run variations in\nunemployment (cyclical unemployment) are caused by the business cycle as the economy expands and\ncontracts. Over the long run, in the United States, the unemployment rate typically hovers around 5% (give or\ntake one percentage point or so), when the economy is healthy. In many of the national economies across\nEurope, the unemployment rate in recent decades has only dropped to about 10% or a bit lower, even in good\neconomic years. We call this baseline level of unemployment that occurs year-in and year-out thenatural rate\nof unemploymentand we determine it by how well the structures of market and government institutions in the\neconomy lead to a matching of workers and employers in the labor market. Potential GDP can imply different\nunemployment rates in different economies, depending on the natural rate of unemployment for that\neconomy.\nThe AD/AS diagram shows cyclical unemployment by how close the economy is to the potential or full GDP\nemployment level. Returning toFigure 24.9, relatively low cyclical unemployment for an economy occurs\nwhen the level of output is close to potential GDP, as in the equilibrium point E . Conversely, high cyclical\n1\nunemployment arises when the output is substantially to the left of potential GDP on the AD/AS diagram, as at\nthe equilibrium point E . Although we do not show the factors that determine the natural rate of\n0\nunemployment separately in the AD/AS model, they are implicitly part of what determines potential GDP or\nfull employment GDP in a given economy.\nInflationary Pressures in the AD/AS Diagram\nInflation fluctuates in the short run. Higher inflation rates have typically occurred either during or just after\neconomic booms: for example, the biggest spurts of inflation in the U.S. economy during the twentieth century\nfollowed the wartime booms of World War I and World War II. Conversely, rates of inflation generally decline\nduring recessions. As an extreme example, inflation actually became negative\u2014a situation called\n\u201cdeflation\u201d\u2014during the Great Depression. Even during the relatively short 1991-1992 recession, the inflation\nrate declined from 5.4% in 1990 to 3.0% in 1992. During the relatively short 2001 recession, the rate of\ninflation declined from 3.4% in 2000 to 1.6% in 2002. During the deep recession of 2007\u20132009, the inflation\nrate declined from 3.8% in 2008 to \u20130.4% in 2009. Some countries have experienced bouts of high inflation\nthat lasted for years. In the U.S. economy since the mid\u20131980s, inflation does not seem to have had any long-\nterm trend to be substantially higher. Instead, it has stayed in the 1\u20135% range annually.\nThe AD/AS framework implies two ways that inflationary pressures may arise. One possible trigger is if\naggregate demand continues to shift to the right when the economy is already at or near potential GDP and full\nemployment, thus pushing the macroeconomic equilibrium into the AS curve's steep portion. InFigure 24.10\n(a), there is a shift of aggregate demand to the right. The new equilibrium E is clearly at a higher price level\n1 598 24 \u2022 The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model\nthan the original equilibrium E . In this situation, the aggregate demand in the economy has soared so high\n0\nthat firms in the economy are not capable of producing additional goods, because labor and physical capital\nare fully employed, and so additional increases in aggregate demand can only result in a rise in the price level.\nFIGURE24.10Sources of Inflationary Pressure in the AD/AS Model(a) A shift in aggregate demand, from AD to\n0\nAD , when it happens in the area of the SRAS curve that is near potential GDP, will lead to a higher price level and to\n1\npressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new equilibrium (E1) is at a higher price level (P1) than the\noriginal equilibrium. (b) A shift in aggregate supply, from SRAS to SRAS , will lead to a lower real GDP and to\n0 1\npressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new equilibrium (E ) is at a higher price level (P ), while the\n1 1\noriginal equilibrium (E ) is at the lower price level (P ).\n0 0\nAn alternative source of inflationary pressures can occur due to a rise in input prices that affects many or most\nfirms across the economy\u2014perhaps an important input to production like oil or labor\u2014and causes the\naggregate supply curve to shift back to the left. InFigure 24.10(b), the SRAS curve's shift to the left also\nincreases the price level from P at the original equilibrium (E ) to a higher price level of P at the new\n0 0 1\nequilibrium (E ). In effect, the rise in input prices ends up, after the final output is produced and sold, passing\n1\nalong in the form of a higher price level for outputs.\nThe AD/AS diagram shows only a one-time shift in the price level. It does not address the question of what\nwould cause inflation either to vanish after a year, or to sustain itself for several years. There are two\nexplanations for why inflation may persist over time. One way that continual inflationary price increases can\noccur is if the government continually attempts to stimulate aggregate demand in a way that keeps pushing the\nAD curve when it is already in the SRAS curve's steep portion. A second possibility is that, if inflation has been\noccurring for several years, people might begin to expect a certain level of inflation. If they do, then these\nexpectations will cause prices, wages and interest rates to increase annually by the amount of the inflation\nexpected. These two reasons are interrelated, because if a government fosters a macroeconomic environment\nwith inflationary pressures, then people will grow to expect inflation. However, the AD/AS diagram does not\nshow these patterns of ongoing or expected inflation in a direct way.\nImportance of the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model\nMacroeconomics takes an overall view of the economy, which means that it needs to juggle many different\nconcepts. For example, start with the three macroeconomic goals of growth, low inflation, and low\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24.6 \u2022 Keynes\u2019 Law and Say\u2019s Law in the AD/AS Model 599\nunemployment. Aggregate demand has four elements: consumption, investment, government spending, and\nexports less imports. Aggregate supply reveals how businesses throughout the economy will react to a higher\nprice level for outputs. Finally, a wide array of economic events and policy decisions can affect aggregate\ndemand and aggregate supply, including government tax and spending decisions; consumer and business\nconfidence; changes in prices of key inputs like oil; and technology that brings higher levels of productivity.\nThe aggregate demand/aggregate supply model is one of the fundamental diagrams in this course (like the\nbudget constraint diagram that we introduced in theChoice in a World of Scarcitychapter and the supply and\ndemand diagram in theDemand and Supplychapter) because it provides an overall framework for bringing\nthese factors together in one diagram. Some version of the AD/AS model will appear in every chapter in the\nrest of this book.\n24.6Keynes\u2019 Law and Say\u2019s Law in the AD/AS Model\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Identify the neoclassical zone, the intermediate zone, and the Keynesian zone in the aggregate demand/\naggregate supply model\n\u2022 Use an aggregate demand/aggregate supply model as a diagnostic test to understand the current state of\nthe economy\nWe can use the AD/AS model to illustrate bothSay\u2019s lawthat supply creates its own demand andKeynes\u2019 law\nthat demand creates its own supply. Consider the SRAS curve's three zones whichFigure 24.11identifies: the\nKeynesian zone, the neoclassical zone, and the intermediate zone.\nFIGURE24.11Keynes, Neoclassical, and Intermediate Zones in the Aggregate Supply CurveNear the equilibrium\nEk, in the Keynesian zone at the far left of the SRAS curve, small shifts in AD, either to the right or the left, will affect\nthe output level Yk, but will not much affect the price level. In the Keynesian zone, AD largely determines the\nquantity of output. Near the equilibrium En, in the neoclassical zone at the SRAS curve's far right, small shifts in AD,\neither to the right or the left, will have relatively little effect on the output level Yn, but instead will have a greater\neffect on the price level. In the neoclassical zone, the near-vertical SRAS curve close to the level of potential GDP\nlargely determines the quantity of output. In the intermediate zone around equilibrium Ei, movement in AD to the\nright will increase both the output level and the price level, while a movement in AD to the left would decrease both\nthe output level and the price level. 600 24 \u2022 The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model\nFocus first on theKeynesian zone, that portion of the SRAS curve on the far left which is relatively flat. If the\nAD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like Ek, then certain statements about\nthe economic situation will follow. In the Keynesian zone, the equilibrium level of real GDP is far below\npotential GDP, the economy is in recession, and cyclical unemployment is high. If aggregate demand shifted to\nthe right or left in the Keynesian zone, it will determine the resulting level of output (and thus unemployment).\nHowever, inflationary price pressure is not much of a worry in the Keynesian zone, since the price level does\nnot vary much in this zone.\nNow, focus your attention on theneoclassical zoneof the SRAS curve, which is the near-vertical portion on the\nright-hand side. If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like En where\noutput is at or near potential GDP, then the size of potential GDP pretty much determines the level of output in\nthe economy. Since the equilibrium is near potential GDP, cyclical unemployment is low in this economy,\nalthough structural unemployment may remain an issue. In the neoclassical zone, shifts of aggregate demand\nto the right or the left have little effect on the level of output or employment. The only way to increase the size\nof the real GDP in the neoclassical zone is for AS to shift to the right. However, shifts in AD in the neoclassical\nzone will create pressures to change the price level.\nFinally, consider the SRAS curve'sintermediate zoneinFigure 24.11. If the AD curve crosses this portion of\nthe SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like Ei, then we might expect unemployment and inflation to move in\nopposing directions. For instance, a shift of AD to the right will move output closer to potential GDP and thus\nreduce unemployment, but will also lead to a higher price level and upward pressure on inflation. Conversely, a\nshift of AD to the left will move output further from potential GDP and raise unemployment, but will also lead\nto a lower price level and downward pressure on inflation.\nThis approach of dividing the SRAS curve into different zones works as a diagnostic test that we can apply to\nan economy, like a doctor checking a patient for symptoms. First, figure out in what zone the economy is. This\nwill clarify the economic issues, tradeoffs, and policy choices. Some economists believe that the economy is\nstrongly predisposed to be in one zone or another. Thus, hard-line Keynesian economists believe that the\neconomies are in the Keynesian zone most of the time, and so they view the neoclassical zone as a theoretical\nabstraction. Conversely, hard-line neoclassical economists argue that economies are in the neoclassical zone\nmost of the time and that the Keynesian zone is a distraction.The Keynesian PerspectiveandThe Neoclassical\nPerspectiveshould help to clarify the underpinnings and consequences of these contrasting views of the\nmacroeconomy.\nBRING IT HOME\nThe Pandemic-Induced Recession: Supply or Demand?\nWe mentioned earlier that a pandemic could cause a shock in the short- or long-run aggregate supply curve by\ntemporarily reducing labor supply and slowing or stopping production of goods and services. Pandemics can also\naffect aggregate demand. When people are hesitant to spend or travel, or if they are not allowed to spend or travel\nbecause of social restrictions, this will affect spending in the economy. Consumers spend less at restaurants, hotels,\nand travel, among other areas, while firms stop investing because of the lack of demand and an uncertain future.\nBoth actions lead to a leftward shift in the aggregate demand curve.\nWhile there is some debate over whether the pandemic-induced recession that the U.S. economy experienced in\n2020 was primarily a supply- or demand-driven one, most likely, it is a combination of both. In March and April\n2020, workers left the labor market en masse, and later in the year, they were hesitant to return due to health and\nsafety concerns. Many people were also forced to cancel travel plans or voluntarily did so out of concern for their\nsafety, further reducing aggregate demand. These changes caused deep cuts in the global economy that continued\nto be felt two years after the initial pandemic-induced shocks.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24 \u2022 Key Terms 601\nKey Terms\naggregate demand (AD) the amount of total spending on domestic goods and services in an economy\naggregate demand (AD) curve the total spending on domestic goods and services at each price level\naggregate demand/aggregate supply model a model that shows what determines total supply or total\ndemand for the economy, and how total demand and total supply interact at the macroeconomic level\naggregate supply (AS) the total quantity of output (i.e. real GDP) firms will produce and sell\naggregate supply (AS) curve the total quantity of output (i.e. real GDP) that firms will produce and sell at each\nprice level\nfull-employment GDP another name for potential GDP, when the economy is producing at its potential and\nunemployment is at the natural rate of unemployment\nintermediate zone portion of the SRAS curve where GDP is below potential but not so far below as in the\nKeynesian zone; the SRAS curve is upward-sloping, but not vertical in the intermediate zone\nKeynes\u2019 law \u201cdemand creates its own supply\u201d\nKeynesian zone portion of the SRAS curve where GDP is far below potential and the SRAS curve is flat\nlong run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve vertical line at potential GDP showing no relationship between the\nprice level for output and real GDP in the long run\nneoclassical economists economists who generally emphasize the importance of aggregate supply in\ndetermining the size of the macroeconomy over the long run\nneoclassical zone portion of the SRAS curve where GDP is at or near potential output where the SRAS curve is\nsteep\npotential GDP the maximum quantity that an economy can produce given full employment of its existing\nlevels of labor, physical capital, technology, and institutions\nSay\u2019s law \u201csupply creates its own demand\u201d\nshort run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve positive short run relationship between the price level for output\nand real GDP, holding the prices of inputs fixed\nstagflation an economy experiences stagnant growth and high inflation at the same time\nKey Concepts and Summary\n24.1Macroeconomic Perspectives on Demand and Supply\nNeoclassical economists emphasize Say\u2019s law, which holds that supply creates its own demand. Keynesian\neconomists emphasize Keynes\u2019 law, which holds that demand creates its own supply. Many mainstream\neconomists take a Keynesian perspective, emphasizing the importance of aggregate demand, for the short run,\nand a neoclassical perspective, emphasizing the importance of aggregate supply, for the long run.\n24.2Building a Model of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply\nThe upward-sloping short run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve shows the positive relationship between the\nprice level and the level of real GDP in the short run. Aggregate supply slopes up because when the price level\nfor outputs increases, while the price level of inputs remains fixed, the opportunity for additional profits\nencourages more production. The aggregate supply curve is near-horizontal on the left and near-vertical on\nthe right. In the long run, we show the aggregate supply by a vertical line at the level of potential output, which\nis the maximum level of output the economy can produce with its existing levels of workers, physical capital,\ntechnology, and economic institutions.\nThe downward-sloping aggregate demand (AD) curve shows the relationship between the price level for\noutputs and the quantity of total spending in the economy. It slopes down because of: (a) the wealth effect,\nwhich means that a higher price level leads to lower real wealth, which reduces the level of consumption; (b)\nthe interest rate effect, which holds that a higher price level will mean a greater demand for money, which will\ntend to drive up interest rates and reduce investment spending; and (c) the foreign price effect, which holds\nthat a rise in the price level will make domestic goods relatively more expensive, discouraging exports and 602 24 \u2022 Key Concepts and Summary\nencouraging imports.\n24.3Shifts in Aggregate Supply\nThe aggregate demand/aggregate supply (AD/AS) diagram shows how AD and AS interact. The intersection of\nthe AD and AS curves shows the equilibrium output and price level in the economy. Movements of either AS or\nAD will result in a different equilibrium output and price level. The aggregate supply curve will shift out to the\nright as productivity increases. It will shift back to the left as the price of key inputs rises, and will shift out to\nthe right if the price of key inputs falls. If the AS curve shifts back to the left, the combination of lower output,\nhigher unemployment, and higher inflation, called stagflation, occurs. If AS shifts out to the right, a\ncombination of lower inflation, higher output, and lower unemployment is possible.\n24.4Shifts in Aggregate Demand\nThe AD curve will shift out as the components of aggregate demand\u2014C, I, G, and X\u2013M\u2014rise. It will shift back to\nthe left as these components fall. These factors can change because of different personal choices, like those\nresulting from consumer or business confidence, or from policy choices like changes in government spending\nand taxes. If the AD curve shifts to the right, then the equilibrium quantity of output and the price level will\nrise. If the AD curve shifts to the left, then the equilibrium quantity of output and the price level will fall.\nWhether equilibrium output changes relatively more than the price level or whether the price level changes\nrelatively more than output is determined by where the AD curve intersects with the AS curve.\nThe AD/AS diagram superficially resembles the microeconomic supply and demand diagram on the surface,\nbut in reality, what is on the horizontal and vertical axes and the underlying economic reasons for the shapes\nof the curves are very different. We can illustrate long-term economic growth in the AD/AS framework by a\ngradual shift of the aggregate supply curve to the right. We illustrate a recession when the intersection of AD\nand AS is substantially below potential GDP, while we illustrate an expanding economy when the intersection\nof AS and AD is near potential GDP.\n24.5How the AD/AS Model Incorporates Growth, Unemployment, and Inflation\nCyclical unemployment is relatively large in the AD/AS framework when the equilibrium is substantially below\npotential GDP. Cyclical unemployment is small in the AD/AS framework when the equilibrium is near potential\nGDP. The natural rate of unemployment, as determined by the labor market institutions of the economy, is\nbuilt into what economists mean by potential GDP, but does not otherwise appear in an AD/AS diagram. The\nAD/AS framework shows pressures for inflation to rise or fall when the movement from one equilibrium to\nanother causes the price level to rise or to fall. The balance of trade does not appear directly in the AD/AS\ndiagram, but it appears indirectly in several ways. Increases in exports or declines in imports can cause shifts\nin AD. Changes in the price of key imported inputs to production, like oil, can cause shifts in AS. The AD/AS\nmodel is the key model we use in this book to understand macroeconomic issues.\n24.6Keynes\u2019 Law and Say\u2019s Law in the AD/AS Model\nWe can divide the SRAS curve into three zones. Keynes\u2019 law says demand creates its own supply, so that\nchanges in aggregate demand cause changes in real GDP and employment. We can show Keynes\u2019 law on the\nhorizontal Keynesian zone of the aggregate supply curve. The Keynesian zone occurs at the left of the SRAS\ncurve where it is fairly flat, so movements in AD will affect output, but have little effect on the price level. Say\u2019s\nlaw says supply creates its own demand. Changes in aggregate demand have no effect on real GDP and\nemployment, only on the price level. We can show Say\u2019s law on the vertical neoclassical zone of the aggregate\nsupply curve. The neoclassical zone occurs at the right of the SRAS curve where it is fairly vertical, and so\nmovements in AD will affect the price level, but have little impact on output. The intermediate zone in the\nmiddle of the SRAS curve is upward-sloping, so a rise in AD will cause higher output and price level, while a fall\nin AD will lead to a lower output and price level.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24 \u2022 Self-Check Questions 603\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the\nnumber of unemployed Americans rose from 6.8 million in May 2007 to 15.4 million in October 2009. During that\ntime, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that approximately 170,000 small businesses closed. Mass layoffs peaked\nin February 2009 when employers gave 326,392 workers notice. U.S. productivity and output fell as well. Job\nlosses, declining home values, declining incomes, and uncertainty about the future caused consumption\nexpenditures to decrease. According to the BLS, household spending dropped by 7.8%.\nHome foreclosures and the meltdown in U.S. financial markets called for immediate action by Congress, the\nPresident, and the Federal Reserve Bank. For example, the government implemented programs such as the\nAmerican Restoration and Recovery Act to help millions of people by providing tax credits for homebuyers, paying 610 25 \u2022 The Keynesian Perspective\n\u201ccash for clunkers,\u201d and extending unemployment benefits. From cutting back on spending, filing for\nunemployment, and losing homes, millions of people were affected by the recession. While the United States is now\non the path to recovery, people will feel the impact for many years to come.\nWhat caused this recession and what prevented the economy from spiraling further into another depression?\nPolicymakers looked to the lessons learned from the 1930s Great Depression and to John Maynard Keynes' models\nto analyze the causes and find solutions to the country\u2019s economic woes. The Keynesian perspective is the subject\nof this chapter.\nWe have learned that the level of economic activity, for example output, employment, and spending, tends to\ngrow over time. InThe Keynesian Perspectivewe learned the reasons for this trend.The Macroeconomic\nPerspectivepointed out that the economy tends to cycle around the long-run trend. In other words, the\neconomy does not always grow at its average growth rate. Sometimes economic activity grows at the trend rate,\nsometimes it grows more than the trend, sometimes it grows less than the trend, and sometimes it actually\ndeclines. You can see this cyclical behavior inFigure 25.2.\nFIGURE25.2U.S. Real Domestic Product, Percent Changes 1930\u20132020The chart tracks the percent change in\nReal GDP since 1930. The magnitude of both recessions and peaks was quite large between 1930 and 1945.\n(Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis, \u201cNational Economic Accounts,\u201d https://apps.bea.gov/itable/index.cfm)\nThis empirical reality raises two important questions: How can we explain the cycles, and to what extent can\nwe moderate them? This chapter (on the Keynesian perspective) andThe Neoclassical Perspectiveexplore\nthose questions from two different points of view, building on what we learned inThe Aggregate Demand/\nAggregate Supply Model.\nClick to view content(https://openstax.org/books/principles-economics-3e/pages/25-introduction-to-the-\nkeynesian-perspective)\nPercent Change of U.S. Real Gross Domestic Product.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 25.1 \u2022 Aggregate Demand in Keynesian Analysis 611\n25.1Aggregate Demand in Keynesian Analysis\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain real GDP, recessionary gaps, and inflationary gaps\n\u2022 Recognize the Keynesian AD/AS model\n\u2022 Identify the determining factors of both consumption expenditure and investment expenditure\n\u2022 Analyze the factors that determine government spending and net exports\nThe Keynesian perspective focuses on aggregate demand. The idea is simple: firms produce output only if they\nexpect it to sell. Thus, while the availability of the factors of production determines a nation\u2019spotential GDP,\nthe amount of goods and services that actually sell, known asreal GDP, depends on how much demand exists\nacross the economy.Figure 25.3illustrates this point.\nFIGURE25.3The Keynesian AD/AS ModelThe Keynesian View of the AD/AS Model uses an SRAS curve, which is\nhorizontal at levels of output below potential and vertical at potential output. Thus, when beginning from potential\noutput, any decrease in AD affects only output, but not prices. Any increase in AD affects only prices, not output.\nKeynes argued that, for reasons we explain shortly, aggregate demand is not stable\u2014that it can change\nunexpectedly. Suppose the economy starts where AD intersects SRAS at P and Yp. Because Yp is potential\n0\noutput, the economy is at full employment. Because AD is volatile, it can easily fall. Thus, even if we start at Yp,\nif AD falls, then we find ourselves in what Keynes termed arecessionary gap. The economy is in equilibrium\nbut with less than full employment, as Y inFigure 25.3shows. Keynes believed that the economy would tend\n1\nto stay in a recessionary gap, with its attendant unemployment, for a significant period of time.\nIn the same way (although we do not show it in the figure), if AD increases, the economy could experience an\ninflationary gap, where demand is attempting to push the economy past potential output. Consequently, the\neconomy experiences inflation. The key policy implication for either situation is that government needs to step\nin and close the gap, increasing spending during recessions and decreasing spending during booms to return\naggregate demand to match potential output.\nRecall fromThe Aggregate Supply-Aggregate Demand Modelthataggregate demandis total spending,\neconomy-wide, on domestic goods and services. (Aggregate demand (AD) is actually what economists call total\nplanned expenditure. Read the appendix onThe Expenditure-Output Modelfor more on this.) You may also\nremember that aggregate demand is the sum of four components: consumption expenditure, investment\nexpenditure, government spending, and spending on net exports (exports minus imports). In the following\nsections, we will examine each component through the Keynesian perspective.\nWhat Determines Consumption Expenditure?\nConsumption expenditure is spending by households and individuals on durable goods, nondurable goods,\nand services. Durable goods are items that last and provide value over time, such as automobiles. Nondurable\ngoods are things like groceries\u2014once you consume them, they are gone. Recall fromThe Macroeconomic 612 25 \u2022 The Keynesian Perspective\nPerspectivethatservicesare intangible things consumers buy, like healthcare or entertainment.\nKeynes identified three factors that affect consumption:\n\u2022 Disposable income: For most people, the single most powerful determinant of how much they consume is\nhow much income they have in their take-home pay, also known asdisposable income, which is income\nafter taxes.\n\u2022 Expected future income: Consumer expectations about future income also are important in determining\nconsumption. If consumers feel optimistic about the future, they are more likely to spend and increase\noverall aggregate demand. News of recession and troubles in the economy will make them pull back on\nconsumption.\n\u2022 Wealth or credit: When households experience a rise in wealth, they may be willing to consume a higher\nshare of their income and to save less. When the U.S. stock market rose dramatically in the late 1990s, for\nexample, U.S. savings rates declined, probably in part because people felt that their wealth had increased\nand there was less need to save. How do people spend beyond their income, when they perceive their\nwealth increasing? The answer is borrowing. On the other side, when the U.S. stock market declined about\n40% from March 2008 to March 2009, people felt far greater uncertainty about their economic future, so\nsavings rates increased while consumption declined.\nFinally, Keynes noted that a variety of other factors combine to determine how much people save and spend. If\nhousehold preferences about saving shift in a way that encourages consumption rather than saving, then AD\nwill shift out to the right.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/Diane_Rehm)for more information about how the recession affected\nvarious groups of people.\nWhat Determines Investment Expenditure?\nWe call spending on new capital goodsinvestment expenditure. Investment falls into four categories:\nproducer\u2019s durable equipment and software, nonresidential structures (such as factories, offices, and retail\nlocations), changes in inventories, and residential structures (such as single-family homes, townhouses, and\napartment buildings). Businesses conduct the first three types of investment, while households conduct the\nlast.\nKeynes\u2019s treatment of investment focuses on the key role of expectations about the future in influencing\nbusiness decisions. When a business decides to make an investment in physical assets, like plants or\nequipment, or in intangible assets, like skills or a research and development project, that firm considers both\nthe expected investment benefits (future profit expectations) and the investment costs (interest rates).\n\u2022 Expectations of future profits: The clearest driver of investment benefits is expectations for future profits.\nWhen we expect an economy to grow, businesses perceive a growing market for their products. Their\nhigher degree of business confidence will encourage new investment. For example, in the second half of\nthe 1990s, U.S. investment levels surged from 18% of GDP in 1994 to 21% in 2000. However, when a\nrecession started in 2001, U.S. investment levels quickly sank back to 18% of GDP by 2002.\n\u2022 Interest rates also play a significant role in determining how much investment a firm will make. Just as\nindividuals need to borrow money to purchase homes, so businesses need financing when they purchase\nbig ticket items. The cost of investment thus includes theinterest rate. Even if the firm has the funds, the\ninterest rate measures the opportunity cost of purchasing business capital. Lower interest rates stimulate\ninvestment spending and higher interest rates reduce it.\nMany factors can affect the expected profitability on investment. For example, if the energy prices decline,\nthen investments that use energy as an input will yield higher profits. If government offers special incentives\nAccess for free at openstax.org 25.1 \u2022 Aggregate Demand in Keynesian Analysis 613\nfor investment (for example, through the tax code), then investment will look more attractive; conversely, if\ngovernment removes special investment incentives from the tax code, or increases other business taxes, then\ninvestment will look less attractive. As Keynes noted, business investment is the most variable of all the\ncomponents of aggregate demand.\nWhat Determines Government Spending?\nThe third component of aggregate demand is federal, state, and local government spending. Although we\nusually view the United States as a market economy, government still plays a significant role in the economy.\nAs we discuss inEnvironmental Protection and Negative ExternalitiesandPositive Externalities and Public\nGoods, government provides important public services such as national defense, transportation\ninfrastructure, and education.\nKeynes recognized that the government budget offered a powerful tool for influencing aggregate demand. Not\nonly could more government spending stimulate AD (or less government spending reduce it), but lowering or\nraising tax rates could influence consumption and investment spending. Keynes concluded that during\nextreme times like deep recessions, only the government had the power and resources to move aggregate\ndemand. For example, during the 2020 pandemic-induced recession, the federal government gave money to\nstate and local governments and to households to support the economy when many firms and governments\nneeded to shut down or suffered a large decline in revenue and needed to lay off workers.\nWhat Determines Net Exports?\nRecall thatexportsare domestically produced products that sell abroad whileimportsare foreign produced\nproducts that consumers purchase domestically. Since we define aggregate demand as spending on domestic\ngoods and services, export expenditures add to AD, while import expenditures subtract from AD.\nTwo sets of factors can cause shifts in export and import demand: changes in relative growth rates between\ncountries and changes in relative prices between countries. What is happening in the countries' economies\nthat would be purchasing those exports heavily affects the level of demand for a nation's exports. For example,\nif major importers of American-made products like Canada, Japan, and Germany have recessions, exports of\nU.S. products to those countries are likely to decline. Conversely, the amount of income in the domestic\neconomy directly affects the quantity of a nation's imports: more income will bring a higher level of imports.\nRelative prices of goods in domestic and international markets can also affect exports and imports. If U.S.\ngoods are relatively cheaper compared with goods made in other places, perhaps because a group of U.S.\nproducers has mastered certain productivity breakthroughs, then U.S. exports are likely to rise. If U.S. goods\nbecome relatively more expensive, perhaps because a change in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and\nother currencies has pushed up the price of inputs to production in the United States, then exports from U.S.\nproducers are likely to decline.\nTable 25.1summarizes the reasons we have explained for changes in aggregate demand. 614 25 \u2022 The Keynesian Perspective\nReasons for a Decrease in Aggregate Demand Reasons for an Increase in Aggregate Demand\nConsumption Consumption\n\u2022 Rise in taxes \u2022 Decrease in taxes\n\u2022 Fall in income \u2022 Increase in income\n\u2022 Rise in interest rates \u2022 Fall in interest rates\n\u2022 Desire to save more \u2022 Desire to save less\n\u2022 Decrease in wealth \u2022 Rise in wealth\n\u2022 Fall in future expected income \u2022 Rise in future expected income\nInvestment Investment\n\u2022 Fall in expected rate of return \u2022 Rise in expected rate of return\n\u2022 Rise in interest rates \u2022 Drop in interest rates\n\u2022 Drop in business confidence \u2022 Rise in business confidence\nGovernment Government\n\u2022 Reduction in government spending \u2022 Increase in government spending\n\u2022 Increase in taxes \u2022 Decrease in taxes\nNet Exports Net Exports\n\u2022 Decrease in foreign demand \u2022 Increase in foreign demand\n\u2022 Relative price increase of U.S. goods \u2022 Relative price drop of U.S. goods\nTABLE25.1Determinants of Aggregate Demand\n25.2The Building Blocks of Keynesian Analysis\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Evaluate the Keynesian view of recessions through an understanding of sticky wages and prices and the\nimportance of aggregate demand\n\u2022 Explain the coordination argument, menu costs, and macroeconomic externality\n\u2022 Analyze the impact of the expenditure multiplier\nNow that we have a clear understanding of what constitutes aggregate demand, we return to the Keynesian\nargument using the model of aggregate demand/aggregate supply (AD/AS). (For a similar treatment using\nKeynes\u2019 income-expenditure model, see the appendix onThe Expenditure-Output Model.)\nKeynesian economics focuses on explaining why recessions and depressions occur and offering a policy\nprescription for minimizing their effects. The Keynesian view ofrecessionis based on two key building blocks.\nFirst, aggregate demand is not always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire\nenough workers to reach full employment. Second, the macroeconomy may adjust only slowly to shifts in\naggregate demand because ofsticky wages and prices, which are wages and prices that do not respond to\ndecreases or increases in demand. We will consider these two claims in turn, and then see how they are\nrepresented in the AD/AS model.\nThe first building block of the Keynesian diagnosis is that recessions occur when the level of demand for goods\nand services is less than what is produced when labor is fully employed. In other words, the intersection of\naggregate supply and aggregate demand occurs at a level of output less than the level of GDP consistent with\nfull employment. Suppose the stock market crashes, as in 1929, or suppose the housing market collapses, as in\n2008. In either case, household wealth will decline, and consumption expenditure will follow. Suppose\nAccess for free at openstax.org 25.2 \u2022 The Building Blocks of Keynesian Analysis 615\nbusinesses see that consumer spending is falling or face restrictions from a pandemic that curtail their\noperations. That will reduce expectations of the profitability of investment, so businesses will decrease\ninvestment expenditure.\nThis seemed to be the case during the Great Depression, since the physical capacity of the economy to supply\ngoods did not alter much. No flood or earthquake or other natural disaster ruined factories in 1929 or 1930. No\noutbreak of disease decimated the ranks of workers. No key input price, like the price of oil, soared on world\nmarkets. The U.S. economy in 1933 had just about the same factories, workers, and state of technology as it\nhad had four years earlier in 1929\u2014and yet the economy had shrunk dramatically. This also seems to be what\nhappened in 2008.\nAs Keynes recognized, the events of the Depression contradicted Say\u2019s law that \u201csupply creates its own\ndemand.\u201d Although production capacity existed, the markets were not able to sell their products. As a result,\nreal GDP was less than potential GDP.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/expenditures)for raw data used to calculate GDP.\nWage and Price Stickiness\nKeynes also pointed out that although AD fluctuated, prices and wages did not immediately respond as\neconomists often expected. Instead, prices and wages are \u201csticky,\u201d making it difficult to restore the economy to\nfull employment and potential GDP. Keynes emphasized one particular reason why wages were sticky: the\ncoordination argument. This argument points out that, even if most people would be willing\u2014at least\nhypothetically\u2014to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also\nexperienced such a decline, a market-oriented economy has no obvious way to implement a plan of\ncoordinated wage reductions.Unemploymentproposed a number of reasons why wages might be sticky\ndownward, most of which center on the argument that businesses avoid wage cuts because they may in one\nway or another depress morale and hurt the productivity of the existing workers.\nSome modern economists have argued in a Keynesian spirit that, along with wages, other prices may be sticky,\ntoo. Many firms do not change their prices every day or even every month. When a firm considers changing\nprices, it must consider two sets of costs. First, changing prices uses company resources: managers must\nanalyze the competition and market demand and decide the new prices, they must update sales materials,\nchange billing records, and redo product and price labels. Second, frequent price changes may leave\ncustomers confused or angry\u2014especially if they discover that a product now costs more than they expected.\nThese costs of changing prices are calledmenu costs\u2014like the costs of printing a new set of menus with\ndifferent prices in a restaurant. Prices do respond to forces of supply and demand, but from a macroeconomic\nperspective, the process of changing all prices throughout the economy takes time.\nTo understand the effect of sticky wages and prices in the economy, considerFigure 25.4(a) illustrating the\noverall labor market, whileFigure 25.4(b) illustrates a market for a specific good or service. The original\nequilibrium (E ) in each market occurs at the intersection of the demand curve (D ) and supply curve (S ).\n0 0 0\nWhen aggregate demand declines, the demand for labor shifts to the left (to D ) inFigure 25.4(a) and the\n1\ndemand for goods shifts to the left (to D ) inFigure 25.4(b). However, because of sticky wages and prices, the\n1\nwage remains at its original level (W ) for a period of time and the price remains at its original level (P ).\n0 0\nAs a result, a situation of excess supply\u2014where the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded at the\nexisting wage or price\u2014exists in markets for both labor and goods, and Q is less than Q in bothFigure 25.4(a)\n1 0\nandFigure 25.4(b). When many labor markets and many goods markets all across the economy find\nthemselves in this position, the economy is in a recession; that is, firms cannot sell what they wish to produce\nat the existing market price and do not wish to hire all who are willing to work at the existing market wage. The 616 25 \u2022 The Keynesian Perspective\nClear It Up feature discusses this problem in more detail.\nFIGURE25.4Sticky Prices and Falling Demand in the Labor and Goods MarketIn both (a) and (b), demand shifts\nleft from D to D . However, the wage in (a) and the price in (b) do not immediately decline. In (a), the quantity\n0 1\ndemanded of labor at the original wage (W ) is Q , but with the new demand curve for labor (D ), it will be Q .\n0 0 1 1\nSimilarly, in (b), the quantity demanded of goods at the original price (P ) is Q , but at the new demand curve (D ) it\n0 0 1\nwill be Q . An excess supply of labor will exist, which we call unemployment. An excess supply of goods will also\n1\nexist, where the quantity demanded is substantially less than the quantity supplied. Thus, sticky wages and sticky\nprices, combined with a drop in demand, bring about unemployment and recession.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhy Was the Pace of Wage Adjustments Slow?\nThe recovery after the Great Recession in the United States was slow. In fact, many low-wage workers at\nMcDonalds, Dominos, and Walmart threatened to strike for higher wages. Their plight was part of a larger trend in\njob growth and pay in the post\u2013recession recovery.\nFIGURE25.5Jobs Lost/Gained in the Recession/RecoveryData in the aftermath of the Great Recession suggests\nthat jobs lost were in mid-wage occupations, while jobs gained were in low-wage occupations.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 25.2 \u2022 The Building Blocks of Keynesian Analysis 617\nThe National Employment Law Project compiled data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found that, during the\nGreat Recession, 60% of job losses were in medium-wage occupations. Most of them were replaced during the\nrecovery period with lower-wage jobs in the service, retail, and food industries.Figure 25.5illustrates this data.\nWages in the service, retail, and food industries are at or near minimum wage and tend to be both downwardly and\nupwardly \u201csticky.\u201d Wages are downwardly sticky due to minimum wage laws. They may be upwardly sticky if\ninsufficient competition in low-skilled labor markets enables employers to avoid raising wages that would reduce\ntheir profits. At the same time, however, the Consumer Price Index increased 11% between 2007 and 2012,\npushing real wages down.\nThe Two Keynesian Assumptions in the AD/AS Model\nFigure 25.6is the AD/AS diagram which illustrates these two Keynesian assumptions\u2014the importance of\naggregate demand in causing recession and the stickiness of wages and prices. Note that because of the\nstickiness of wages and prices, the aggregate supply curve is flatter than either supply curve (labor or specific\ngood). In fact, if wages and prices were so sticky that they did not fall at all, the aggregate supply curve would\nbe completely flat below potential GDP, asFigure 25.6shows. This outcome is an important example of a\nmacroeconomic externality, where what happens at the macro level is different from and inferior to what\nhappens at the micro level. For example, a firm should respond to a decrease in demand for its product by\ncutting its price to increase sales. However, if all firms experience a decrease in demand for their products,\nsticky prices in the aggregate prevent aggregate demand from rebounding (which we would show as a\nmovement along the AD curve in response to a lower price level).\nThe original equilibrium of this economy occurs where the aggregate demand function (AD ) intersects with\n0\nAS. Since this intersection occurs at potential GDP (Yp), the economy is operating at full employment. When\naggregate demand shifts to the left, all the adjustment occurs through decreased real GDP. There is no\ndecrease in the price level. Since the equilibrium occurs at Y , the economy experiences substantial\n1\nunemployment.\nFIGURE25.6A Keynesian Perspective of RecessionThis figure illustrates the two key assumptions behind\nKeynesian economics. A recession begins when aggregate demand declines from AD to AD . The recession persists\n0 1\nbecause of the assumption of fixed wages and prices, which makes the SRAS flat below potential GDP. If that were\nnot the case, the price level would fall also, raising GDP and limiting the recession. Instead the intersection E\n1\noccurs in the flat portion of the SRAS curve where GDP is less than potential.\nThe Expenditure Multiplier\nA key concept in Keynesian economics is theexpenditure multiplier. The expenditure multiplier is the idea\nthat not only does spending affect the equilibrium level of GDP, but that spending is powerful. More precisely, it\nmeans that a change in spending causes a more than proportionate change in GDP. 618 25 \u2022 The Keynesian Perspective\nThe reason for the expenditure multiplier is that one person\u2019s spending becomes another person\u2019s income,\nwhich leads to additional spending and additional income so that the cumulative impact on GDP is larger than\nthe initial increase in spending. The appendix onThe Expenditure-Output Modelprovides the details of the\nmultiplier process, but the concept is important enough for us to summarize here. While the multiplier is\nimportant for understanding the effectiveness of fiscal policy, it occurs whenever any autonomous increase in\nspending occurs. Additionally, the multiplier operates in a negative as well as a positive direction. Thus, when\ninvestment spending collapsed during the Great Depression, it caused a much larger decrease in real GDP. The\nsize of the multiplier is critical and was a key element in discussions of the effectiveness of the Obama\nadministration\u2019s fiscal stimulus package, officially titled theAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.\n25.3The Phillips Curve\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain the Phillips curve, noting its impact on the theories of Keynesian economics\n\u2022 Graph a Phillips curve\n\u2022 Identify factors that cause the instability of the Phillips curve\n\u2022 Analyze the Keynesian policy for reducing unemployment and inflation\nThe simplified AD/AS model that we have used so far is fully consistent with Keynes\u2019s original model. More\nrecent research, though, has indicated that in the real world, an aggregate supply curve is more curved than\nthe right angle that we used in this chapter. Rather, the real-world AS curve is very flat at levels of output far\nbelow potential (\u201cthe Keynesian zone\u201d), very steep at levels of output above potential (\u201cthe neoclassical zone\u201d)\nand curved in between (\u201cthe intermediate zone\u201d).Figure 25.7illustrates this. The typical aggregate supply\ncurve leads to the concept of the Phillips curve.\nFIGURE25.7Keynes, Neoclassical, and Intermediate Zones in the Aggregate Supply CurveNear the equilibrium\nEk, in the Keynesian zone at the SRAS curve's far left, small shifts in AD, either to the right or the left, will affect the\noutput level Yk, but will not much affect the price level. In the Keynesian zone, AD largely determines the quantity of\noutput. Near the equilibrium En, in the neoclassical zone, at the SRAS curve's far right, small shifts in AD, either to\nthe right or the left, will have relatively little effect on the output level Yn, but instead will have a greater effect on\nthe price level. In the neoclassical zone, the near-vertical SRAS curve close to the level of potential GDP (as\nAccess for free at openstax.org 25.3 \u2022 The Phillips Curve 619\nrepresented by the LRAS line) largely determines the quantity of output. In the intermediate zone around\nequilibrium Ei, movement in AD to the right will increase both the output level and the price level, while a movement\nin AD to the left would decrease both the output level and the price level.\nThe Discovery of the Phillips Curve\nIn the 1950s,A.W. Phillips, an economist at the London School of Economics, was studying the Keynesian\nanalytical framework. The Keynesian theory implied that during a recession inflationary pressures are low, but\nwhen the level of output is at or even pushing beyond potential GDP, the economy is at greater risk for inflation.\nPhillips analyzed 60 years of British data and did find that tradeoff between unemployment and inflation,\nwhich became known as thePhillips curve.Figure 25.8shows a theoretical Phillips curve, and the following\nWork It Out feature shows how the pattern appears for the United States.\nFIGURE25.8A Keynesian Phillips Curve Tradeoff between Unemployment and InflationA Phillips curve illustrates a\ntradeoff between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate. If one is higher, the other must be lower. For\nexample, point A illustrates a 5% inflation rate and a 4% unemployment. If the government attempts to reduce\ninflation to 2%, then it will experience a rise in unemployment to 7%, as point B shows.\nWORK IT OUT\nThe Phillips Curve for the United States\nStep 1.

Your graph should look likeFigure 25.10.\nFIGURE25.10U.S. Phillips Curve, 1960\u20131979The tradeoff between unemployment and inflation appeared to\nbreak down during the 1970s as the Phillips Curve shifted out to the right.\nOver this longer period of time, the Phillips curve appears to have shifted out. There is no tradeoff any more.\nThe Instability of the Phillips Curve\nDuring the 1960s, economists viewed the Phillips curve as a policy menu. A nation could choose low inflation\nand high unemployment, or high inflation and low unemployment, or anywhere in between. Economies could\nuse fiscal and monetary policy to move up or down the Phillips curve as desired. Then a curious thing\nhappened. When policymakers tried to exploit the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, the result\nwas an increase in both inflation and unemployment. What had happened? The Phillips curve shifted.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 25.3 \u2022 The Phillips Curve 621\nThe U.S. economy experienced this pattern in the deep recession from 1973 to 1975, and again in back-to-\nback recessions from 1980 to 1982. Many nations around the world saw similar increases in unemployment\nand inflation. This pattern became known asstagflation. (Recall fromThe Aggregate Demand/Aggregate\nSupply Modelthat stagflation is an unhealthy combination of high unemployment and high inflation.) Perhaps\nmost important, stagflation was a phenomenon that traditional Keynesian economics could not explain.\nEconomists have concluded that two factors cause the Phillips curve to shift. The first is supply shocks, like the\nmid-1970s oil crisis, which first brought stagflation into our vocabulary. The second is changes in people\u2019s\nexpectations about inflation. In other words, there may be a tradeoff betweeninflationandunemployment\nwhen people expect no inflation, but when they realize inflation is occurring, the tradeoff disappears. Both\nfactors (supply shocks and changes in inflationary expectations) cause the aggregate supply curve, and thus\nthe Phillips curve, to shift.\nIn short, we should interpret a downward-sloping Phillips curve as valid for short-run periods of several years,\nbut over longer periods, when aggregate supply shifts, the downward-sloping Phillips curve can shift so that\nunemployment and inflation are both higher (as in the 1970s and early 1980s) or both lower (as in the early\n1990s or first decade of the 2000s).\nKeynesian Policy for Fighting Unemployment and Inflation\nKeynesian macroeconomics argues that the solution to a recession isexpansionary fiscal policy, such as tax\ncuts to stimulate consumption and investment, or direct increases in government spending that would shift\nthe aggregate demand curve to the right. For example, if aggregate demand was originally at ADr inFigure\n25.11, so that the economy was in recession, the appropriate policy would be for government to shift aggregate\ndemand to the right from ADr to ADf, where the economy would be at potential GDP and full employment.\nKeynes noted that while it would be nice if the government could spend additional money on housing, roads,\nand other amenities, he also argued that if the government could not agree on how to spend money in practical\nways, then it could spend in impractical ways. For example, Keynes suggested building monuments, like a\nmodern equivalent of the Egyptian pyramids. He proposed that the government could bury money\nunderground, and let mining companies start digging up the money again. These suggestions were slightly\ntongue-in-cheek, but their purpose was to emphasize that a Great Depression is no time to quibble over the\nspecifics of government spending programs and tax cuts when the goal should be to pump up aggregate\ndemand by enough to lift the economy topotential GDP.\nFIGURE25.11Fighting Recession and Inflation with Keynesian PolicyIf an economy is in recession, with an\nequilibrium at Er, then the Keynesian response would be to enact a policy to shift aggregate demand to the right\nfrom ADr toward ADf. If an economy is experiencing inflationary pressures with an equilibrium at Ei, then the 622 25 \u2022 The Keynesian Perspective\nKeynesian response would be to enact a policy response to shift aggregate demand to the left, from ADi toward ADf.\nThe other side of Keynesian policy occurs when the economy is operating above potential GDP. In this\nsituation, unemployment is low, but inflationary rises in the price level are a concern. The Keynesian response\nwould becontractionary fiscal policy, using tax increases or government spending cuts to shift AD to the left.\nThe result would be downward pressure on the price level, but very little reduction in output or very little rise\nin unemployment. If aggregate demand was originally at ADi inFigure 25.11, so that the economy was\nexperiencing inflationary rises in the price level, the appropriate policy would be for government to shift\naggregate demand to the left, from ADi toward ADf, which reduces the pressure for a higher price level while\nthe economy remains at full employment.\nIn the Keynesian economic model, too little aggregate demand brings unemployment and too much brings\ninflation. Thus, you can think of Keynesian economics as pursuing a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d level of aggregate demand:\nnot too much, not too little, but looking for what is just right.\n25.4The Keynesian Perspective on Market Forces\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain the Keynesian perspective on market forces\n\u2022 Analyze the role of government policy in economic management\nEver since the birth of Keynesian economics in the 1930s, controversy has simmered over the extent to which\ngovernment should play an active role in managing the economy. In the aftermath of the human devastation\nand misery of the Great Depression, many people\u2014including many economists\u2014became more aware of\nvulnerabilities within the market-oriented economic system. Some supporters of Keynesian economics\nadvocated a high degree of government planning in all parts of the economy.\nHowever, Keynes himself was careful to separate the issue of aggregate demand from the issue of how well\nindividual markets worked. He argued that individual markets for goods and services were appropriate and\nuseful, but that sometimes that level of aggregate demand was just too low. When 10 million people are willing\nand able to work, but one million of them are unemployed, he argued, individual markets may be doing a\nperfectly good job of allocating the efforts of the nine million workers\u2014the problem is that insufficient\naggregate demand exists to support jobs for all 10 million. Thus, he believed that, while government should\nensure that overall level of aggregate demand is sufficient for an economy to reach full employment, this task\ndid not imply that the government should attempt to set prices and wages throughout the economy, nor to take\nover and manage large corporations or entire industries directly.\nEven if one accepts the Keynesian economic theory, a number of practical questions remain. In the real world,\ncan government economists identify potential GDP accurately? Is a desired increase in aggregate demand\nbetter accomplished by a tax cut or by an increase in government spending? Given the inevitable delays and\nuncertainties as governments enact policies into law, is it reasonable to expect that the government can\nimplement Keynesian economics? Can fixing a recession really be just as simple as pumping up aggregate\ndemand?Government Budgets and Fiscal Policywill probe these issues. The Keynesian approach, with its\nfocus on aggregate demand and sticky prices, has proved useful in understanding how the economy fluctuates\nin the short run and why recessions and cyclical unemployment occur. InThe Neoclassical Perspective, we will\nconsider some of the shortcomings of the Keynesian approach and why it is not especially well-suited for long-\nrun macroeconomic analysis.\nBRING IT HOME\nThe Pandemic-Induced Recession and the Keynesian Perspective\nThe pandemic-induced recession of 2020 was unique. Unlike the Great Recession of 2007\u20132009 discussed in most\nAccess for free at openstax.org 25.4 \u2022 The Keynesian Perspective on Market Forces 623\nof this chapter, it was not started by the burst of a housing bubble. It was started by a virus that caused sickness and\ndeath for millions of people worldwide and required substantial social policy in order to control its spread.\nIn some ways, the latest recession was influenced by fluctuations in aggregate demand. At its depth in April 2020,\nover 20 million people were unemployed, causing a massive decline in consumption and aggregate demand. As\nbusinesses were forced to shutter or move their operations online, many were pessimistic or uncertain about the\nfuture state of the economy, causing investment to decline. The federal government attempted to correct this\naggregate demand shock through small business loans, direct aid to state and local governments, expanded\nunemployment insurance, and stimulus checks. As a result of all these measures, the economy was able to bounce\nback somewhat over the remainder of 2020. However, even at the start of 2022, millions of people remained out of\nwork as new variants threatened to upend the economy once again.\nThe Keynesian perspective would have economic policy continue to focus on aggregate and restoring confidence in\nthe economy. President Biden\u2019s proposals largely reflect these goals, but with millions of workers still out of the\nlabor market and a virus that is still not contained, it remains to be seen whether those policy prescriptions will be\nenough \u201cmedicine\u201d to bring the economy back to normalcy. 624 25 \u2022 Key Terms\nKey Terms\ncontractionary fiscal policy tax increases or cuts in government spending designed to decrease aggregate\ndemand and reduce inflationary pressures\ncoordination argument downward wage and price flexibility requires perfect information about the level of\nlower compensation acceptable to other laborers and market participants\ndisposable income income after taxes\nexpansionary fiscal policy tax cuts or increases in government spending designed to stimulate aggregate\ndemand and move the economy out of recession\nexpenditure multiplier Keynesian concept that asserts that a change in autonomous spending causes a more\nthan proportionate change in real GDP\ninflationary gap equilibrium at a level of output above potential GDP\nmacroeconomic externality occurs when what happens at the macro level is different from and inferior to\nwhat happens at the micro level; an example would be where upward sloping supply curves for firms\nbecome a flat aggregate supply curve, illustrating that the price level cannot fall to stimulate aggregate\ndemand\nmenu costs costs firms face in changing prices\nPhillips curve the tradeoff between unemployment and inflation\nreal GDP the amount of goods and services actually sold in a nation\nrecessionary gap equilibrium at a level of output below potential GDP\nsticky wages and prices a situation where wages and prices do not fall in response to a decrease in demand,\nor do not rise in response to an increase in demand\nKey Concepts and Summary\n25.1Aggregate Demand in Keynesian Analysis\nAggregate demand is the sum of four components: consumption, investment, government spending, and net\nexports. Consumption will change for a number of reasons, including movements in income, taxes,\nexpectations about future income, and changes in wealth levels. Investment will change in response to its\nexpected profitability, which in turn is shaped by expectations about future economic growth, the creation of\nnew technologies, the price of key inputs, and tax incentives for investment. Investment will also change when\ninterest rates rise or fall. Political considerations determine government spending and taxes. Exports and\nimports change according to relative growth rates and prices between two economies.\n25.2The Building Blocks of Keynesian Analysis\nKeynesian economics is based on two main ideas: (1) aggregate demand is more likely than aggregate supply\nto be the primary cause of a short-run economic event like a recession; (2) wages and prices can be sticky, and\nso, in an economic downturn, unemployment can result. The latter is an example of a macroeconomic\nexternality. While surpluses cause prices to fall at the micro level, they do not necessarily at the macro level.\nInstead the adjustment to a decrease in demand occurs only through decreased quantities. One reason why\nprices may be sticky is menu costs, the costs of changing prices. These include internal costs a business faces\nin changing prices in terms of labeling, recordkeeping, and accounting, and also the costs of communicating\nthe price change to (possibly unhappy) customers. Keynesians also believe in the existence of the expenditure\nmultiplier\u2014the notion that a change in autonomous expenditure causes a more than proportionate change in\nGDP.\n25.3The Phillips Curve\nA Phillips curve shows the tradeoff between unemployment and inflation in an economy. From a Keynesian\nviewpoint, the Phillips curve should slope down so that higher unemployment means lower inflation, and vice\nversa. However, a downward-sloping Phillips curve is a short-term relationship that may shift after a few years.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 25 \u2022 Self-Check Questions 625\nKeynesian macroeconomics argues that the solution to a recession is expansionary fiscal policy, such as tax\ncuts to stimulate consumption and investment, or direct increases in government spending that would shift\nthe aggregate demand curve to the right. The other side of Keynesian policy occurs when the economy is\noperating above potential GDP. In this situation, unemployment is low, but inflationary rises in the price level\nare a concern. The Keynesian response would be contractionary fiscal policy, using tax increases or\ngovernment spending cuts to shift AD to the left.\n25.4The Keynesian Perspective on Market Forces\nThe Keynesian prescription for stabilizing the economy implies government intervention at the\nmacroeconomic level\u2014increasing aggregate demand when private demand falls and decreasing aggregate\ndemand when private demand rises. This does not imply that the government should be passing laws or\nregulations that set prices and quantities in microeconomic markets.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

One of the most visible signs was in the housing market where many people\nwere forced to abandon their homes and other buildings, including ones midway through construction. (Credit:\nmodification of \"House\" by A McLin/Flickr Creative Commons, CC BY 2.0)\nCHAPTER OBJECTIVES\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\u2022 The Building Blocks of Neoclassical Analysis\n\u2022 The Policy Implications of the Neoclassical Perspective\n\u2022 Balancing Keynesian and Neoclassical Models\nIntroduction to the Neoclassical Perspective\nBRING IT HOME\nNavigating Uncharted Waters\nThe Great Recession ended in June 2009 after 18 months, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research\n(NBER). The NBER examines a variety of measures of economic activity to gauge the economy's overall health.\nThese measures include real income, wholesale and retail sales, employment, and industrial production. In the\nyears since the official end of this historic economic downturn, it has become clear that the Great Recession was\ntwo-pronged, hitting the U.S. economy with the collapse of the housing market and the failure of the financial\nsystem's credit institutions, further contaminating global economies. While the stock market rapidly lost trillions of\ndollars of value, consumer spending dried up, and companies began cutting jobs, economic policymakers were\nstruggling with how to best combat and prevent a national, and even global economic collapse. In the end,\npolicymakers used a number of controversial monetary and fiscal policies to support the housing market and\ndomestic industries as well as to stabilize the financial sector. Some of these initiatives included: 628 26 \u2022 The Neoclassical Perspective\n\u2022 Federal Reserve Bank purchase of both traditional and nontraditional assets off banks' balance sheets. By doing\nthis, the Fed injected money into the banking system and increased the amounts of funds available to lend to\nthe business sector and consumers. This also dropped short-term interest rates to as low as zero percent,\nwhich had the effect of devaluing U.S. dollars in the global market and boosting exports.\n\u2022 The Congress and the President also passed several pieces of legislation that would stabilize the financial\nmarket. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), passed in late 2008, allowed the government to inject cash\ninto troubled banks and other financial institutions and help support General Motors and Chrysler as they faced\nbankruptcy and threatened job losses throughout their supply chain. The American Recovery and Reinvestment\nAct in early 2009 provided tax rebates to low- and middle-income households to encourage consumer\nspending.\nFour years after the end of the Great Recession, the economy had yet to return to its pre-recession levels of\nproductivity and growth. Annual productivity increased only 1.9% between 2009 and 2012 compared to its 2.7%\nannual growth rate between 2000 and 2007, unemployment remained above the natural rate, and real GDP\ncontinued to lag behind potential growth. The actions the government took to stabilize the economy were under\nscrutiny and debate about their effectiveness continues. In this chapter, we will discuss the neoclassical perspective\non economics and compare it to the Keynesian perspective, using both the Great Recession and the more recent\npandemic-induced recession as examples.\nIn Chicago, Illinois, the highest recorded temperature was 105\u00b0 in July 1995, while the lowest recorded\ntemperature was 27\u00b0 below zero in January 1958. Understanding why these extreme weather patterns\noccurred would be interesting. However, if you wanted to understand the typical weather pattern in Chicago,\ninstead of focusing on one-time extremes, you would need to look at the entire pattern of data over time.\nA similar lesson applies to the study of macroeconomics. It is interesting to study extreme situations, like the\n1930sGreat Depression, the 2008\u20132009Great Recession, or the pandemic-induced recession of 2020. If you\nwant to understand the whole picture, however, you need to look at the long term. Consider the unemployment\nrate. The unemployment rate has fluctuated from as low as 3.5% in 1969 to as high as 9.7% in 1982 and 8.1%\nin 2020. Even as the U.S. unemployment rate rose during recessions and declined during expansions, it kept\nreturning to the general neighborhood of 5.0%. When the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office carried out\nits long-range economic forecasts in 2010, it assumed that from 2015 to 2020, after the recession has passed,\nthe unemployment rate would be 5.0%. In February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic, the unemployment\nrate reached a historic low of 3.5% and is back to below 5% as of early 2022. From a long-run perspective, the\neconomy seems to keep adjusting back to this rate of unemployment.\nAs the name \u201cneoclassical\u201d implies, this perspective of how the macroeconomy works is a \u201cnew\u201d view of the\n\u201cold\u201d classical model of the economy. The classical view, the predominant economic philosophy until the Great\nDepression, was that short-term fluctuations in economic activity would rather quickly, with flexible prices,\nadjust back to full employment. This view of the economy implied a vertical aggregate supply curve at full\nemployment GDP, and prescribed a \u201chands off\u201d policy approach. For example, if the economy were to slip into\nrecession (a leftward shift of the aggregate demand curve), it would temporarily exhibit a surplus of goods.\nFalling prices would eliminate this surplus, and the economy would return to full employment level of GDP. No\nactive fiscal or monetary policy was needed. In fact, the classical view was that expansionary fiscal or\nmonetary policy would only cause inflation, rather than increase GDP. The deep and lasting impact of the Great\nDepression changed this thinking and Keynesian economics, which prescribed active fiscal policy to alleviate\nweak aggregate demand, became the more mainstream perspective.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 26.1 \u2022 The Building Blocks of Neoclassical Analysis 629\n26.1The Building Blocks of Neoclassical Analysis\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain the importance of potential GDP in the long run\n\u2022 Analyze the role of flexible prices\n\u2022 Interpret a neoclassical model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply\n\u2022 Evaluate different ways for measuring the speed of macroeconomic adjustment\nTheneoclassical perspectiveon macroeconomics holds that, in the long run, the economy will fluctuate\naround its potential GDP and its natural rate of unemployment. This chapter begins with two building blocks of\nneoclassical economics: (1) potential GDP determines the economy's size and (2) wages and prices will adjust\nin a flexible manner so that the economy will adjust back to its potential GDP level of output. The key policy\nimplication is this: The government should focus more on long-term growth and on controlling inflation than\non worrying about recession or cyclical unemployment. This focus on long-run growth rather than the short-\nrun fluctuations in the business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for long-run\nmacroeconomic analysis andKeynesian economicsis more useful for analyzing the macroeconomic short\nrun. Let's consider the two neoclassical building blocks in turn, and how we can embody them in theaggregate\ndemand/aggregate supply model.\nThe Importance of Potential GDP in the Long Run\nOver the long run, the level of potential GDP determines the size of real GDP. When economists refer to\n\u201cpotential GDP\u201d they are referring to that level of output that an economy can achieve when all resources (land,\nlabor, capital, and entrepreneurial ability) are fully employed. While the unemployment rate in labor markets\nwill never be zero, full employment in the labor market refers to zero cyclical unemployment. There will still be\nsome level of unemployment due to frictional or structural unemployment, but when the economy is operating\nwith zero cyclical unemployment, economists say that the economy is at the natural rate of unemployment or\nat full employment.\nEconomists benchmark actual orreal GDPagainst thepotential GDPto determine how well the economy is\nperforming. As explained inEconomic Growth, we can explain GDP growth by increases in investment in\nphysical capital and human capital per person as well as advances in technology.Physical capital per person\nrefers to the amount and kind of machinery and equipment available to help people get work done. Compare,\nfor example, your productivity in typing a term paper on a typewriter to working on your laptop with word\nprocessing software. Clearly, you will be able to be more productive using word processing software. The\ntechnology and level of capital of your laptop and software has increased your productivity. More broadly, the\ndevelopment of GPS technology and Universal Product Codes (those barcodes on every product we buy) has\nmade it much easier for firms to track shipments, tabulate inventories, and sell and distribute products. These\ntwo technological innovations, and many others, have increased a nation's ability to produce goods and\nservices for a given population. Likewise, increasing human capital involves increasing levels of knowledge,\neducation, and skill sets per person through vocational or higher education. Physical and human capital\nimprovements with technological advances will increase overall productivity and, thus, GDP.\nTo see how these improvements have increased productivity and output at the national level, we should\nexamine evidence from the United States. The United States experienced significant growth in the twentieth\ncentury due to phenomenal changes in infrastructure, equipment, and technological improvements in\nphysical capital and human capital. The population more than tripled in the twentieth century, from 76 million\nin 1900 to over 300 million in 2016. Thehuman capitalof modern workers is far higher today because the\neducation and skills of workers have risen dramatically. In 1900, only about one-eighth of the U.S. population\nhad completed high school and just one person in 40 had completed a four-year college degree. By 2010, about\n8.5% of Americans age 25 or older had a high school degree and about 28% had a four-year college degree as\nwell. In 2019, 33% of Americans age 25 or older had a four-year college degree. The average amount of 630 26 \u2022 The Neoclassical Perspective\nphysical capital per worker has grown dramatically. The technology available to modern workers is\nextraordinarily better than a century ago: cars, airplanes, electrical machinery, smartphones, computers,\nchemical and biological advances, materials science, health care\u2014the list of technological advances could run\non and on. More workers, higher skill levels, larger amounts of physical capital per worker, and amazingly\nbetter technology, and potential GDP for the U.S. economy has clearly increased a great deal since 1900.\nThis growth has fallen below its potential GDP and, at times, has exceeded its potential. For example from\n2008 to 2009, the U.S. economy tumbled into recession and remained below its potential until 2018. After the\npandemic-induced recession of March and April 2020, the economy again fell below potential GDP and\nremains there as of early 2022. At other times, like in the late 1990s or from 2018 to 2020, the economy ran at\npotential GDP\u2014or even slightly ahead.Figure 26.2shows the actual data for the increase in real GDP since\n1960. The slightly smoother line shows the potential GDP since 1960 as estimated by the nonpartisan\nCongressional Budget Office. Most economic recessions and upswings are times when the economy is 1\u20133%\nbelow or above potential GDP in a given year. Clearly, short-run fluctuations around potential GDP do exist, but\nover the long run, the upward trend of potential GDP determines the size of the economy.\nFIGURE26.2Potential and Actual GDP (in 2012 Dollars), 1958\u20132020Actual GDP falls below potential GDP during\nand after recessions, like the recessions of 1980 and 1981\u201382, 1990\u201391, 2001, and 2008\u20132009 and continues\nbelow potential GDP until 2019, when it goes slightly above potential. In other cases, actual GDP can be above\npotential GDP for a time, as in the late 1990s.\nIn the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model, we show potential GDP as a vertical line. Neoclassical\neconomists who focus on potential GDP as the primary determinant of real GDP argue that the long-run\naggregate supply curve is located at potential GDP\u2014that is, we draw the long-run aggregate supply curve as a\nvertical line at the level of potential GDP, asFigure 26.3shows. A vertical LRAS curve means that the level of\naggregate supply(or potential GDP) will determine the economy's real GDP, regardless of the level ofaggregate\ndemand. Over time, increases in the quantity and quality of physical capital, increases in human capital, and\ntechnological advancements shift potential GDP and the vertical LRAS curve gradually to the right. Economists\noften describe this gradual increase in an economy's potential GDP as a nation's long-term economic growth.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 26.1 \u2022 The Building Blocks of Neoclassical Analysis 631\nFIGURE26.3A Vertical AS CurveIn the neoclassical model, we draw the aggregate supply curve as a vertical line\nat the level of potential GDP. If AS is vertical, then it determines the level of real output, no matter where we draw\nthe aggregate demand curve. Over time, the LRAS curve shifts to the right as productivity increases and potential\nGDP expands.\nThe Role of Flexible Prices\nHow does the macroeconomy adjust back to its level of potential GDP in the long run? What if aggregate\ndemand increases or decreases? Economists base the neoclassical view of how the macroeconomy adjusts on\nthe insight that even if wages and prices are \u201csticky\u201d, or slow to change, in the short run, they are flexible over\ntime. To understand this better, let's follow the connections from the short-run to the long-run macroeconomic\nequilibrium.\nThe aggregate demand and aggregate supply diagram inFigure 26.4shows two aggregate supply curves. We\ndraw the original upward sloping aggregate supply curve (SRAS ) is a short-run or Keynesian AS curve. The\n0\nvertical aggregate supply curve (LRASn) is the long-run or neoclassical AS curve, which is located at potential\nGDP. The original aggregate demand curve, labeled AD , so that the original equilibrium occurs at point E , at\n0 0\nwhich point the economy is producing at its potential GDP.\nFIGURE26.4The Rebound to Potential GDP after AD IncreasesThe original equilibrium (E ), at an output level of\n0\n500 and a price level of 120, happens at the intersection of the aggregate demand curve (AD ) and the short-run\n0\naggregate supply curve (SRAS ). The output at E is equal to potential GDP. Aggregate demand shifts right from AD\n0 0 0\nto AD . The new equilibrium is E , with a higher output level of 550 and an increase in the price level to 125. With\n1 1 632 26 \u2022 The Neoclassical Perspective\nunemployment rates unsustainably low, eager employers bid up wages, which shifts short-run aggregate supply to\nthe left, from SRAS to SRAS . The new equilibrium (E ) is at the same original level of output, 500, but at a higher\n0 1 2\nprice level of 130. Thus, the long-run aggregate supply curve (LRASn), which is vertical at the level of potential GDP,\ndetermines the level of real GDP in this economy in the long run.\nNow, imagine that some economic event boosts aggregate demand: perhaps a surge of export sales or a rise in\nbusiness confidence that leads to more investment, perhaps a policy decision like higher government\nspending, or perhaps a tax cut that leads to additional aggregate demand. The short-run Keynesian analysis is\nthat the rise in aggregate demand will shift the aggregate demand curve out to the right, from AD to AD ,\n0 1\nleading to a new equilibrium at point E with higher output, lower unemployment, and pressure for an\n1\ninflationary rise in the price level.\nIn the long-run neoclassical analysis, however, the chain of economic events is just beginning. As economic\noutput rises above potential GDP, the level of unemployment falls. The economy is now above full employment\nand there is a labor shortage. Eager employers are trying to bid workers away from other companies and to\nencourage their current workers to exert more effort and to work longer hours. This high demand for labor will\ndrive up wages. Most employers review their workers salaries only once or twice a year, and so it will take time\nbefore the higher wages filter through the economy. As wages do rise, it will mean a leftward shift in the short-\nrun Keynesian aggregate supply curve back to SRAS , because the price of a major input to production has\n1\nincreased. The economy moves to a new equilibrium (E ). The new equilibrium has the same level of real GDP\n2\nas did the original equilibrium (E ), but there has been an inflationary increase in the price level.\n0\nThis description of the short-run shift from E to E and the long-run shift from E to E is a step-by-step way\n0 1 1 2\nof making a simple point: the economy cannot sustain production above its potential GDP in the long run. An\neconomy may produce above its level of potential GDP in the short run, under pressure from a surge in\naggregate demand. Over the long run, however, that surge in aggregate demand ends up as an increase in the\nprice level, not as a rise in output.\nThe rebound of the economy back to potential GDP also works in response to a shift to the left in aggregate\ndemand.Figure 26.5again starts with two aggregate supply curves, with SRAS showing the original upward\n0\nsloping short-run Keynesian AS curve and LRASn showing the vertical long-run neoclassical aggregate supply\ncurve. A decrease in aggregate demand\u2014for example, because of a decline in consumer confidence that leads\nto less consumption and more saving\u2014causes the original aggregate demand curve AD to shift back to AD .\n0 1\nThe shift from the original equilibrium (E ) to the new equilibrium (E ) results in a decline in output. The\n0 1\neconomy is now below full employment and there is a surplus of labor. As output falls below potential GDP,\nunemployment rises. While a lower price level (i.e., deflation) is rare in the United States, it does happen\noccasionally during very weak periods of economic activity. For practical purposes, we might consider a lower\nprice level in the AD\u2013AS model as indicative of disinflation, which is a decline in the inflation rate. Thus, the\nlong-run aggregate supply curve LRASn, which is vertical at the level of potential GDP, ultimately determines\nthis economy's real GDP.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 26.1 \u2022 The Building Blocks of Neoclassical Analysis 633\nFIGURE26.5A Rebound Back to Potential GDP from a Shift to the Left in Aggregate DemandThe original\nequilibrium (E ), at an output level of 500 and a price level of 120, happens at the intersection of the aggregate\n0\ndemand curve (AD ) and the short-run aggregate supply curve (SRAS ). The output at E is equal to potential GDP.\n0 0 0\nAggregate demand shifts left, from AD to AD . The new equilibrium is at E , with a lower output level of 450 and\n0 1 1\ndownward pressure on the price level of 115. With high unemployment rates, wages are held down. Lower wages\nare an economy-wide decrease in the price of a key input, which shifts short-run aggregate supply to the right, from\nSRAS to SRAS . The new equilibrium (E ) is at the same original level of output, 500, but at a lower price level of\n0 1 2\n110.\nAgain, from the neoclassical perspective, this short-run scenario is only the beginning of the chain of events.\nThe higher level of unemployment means more workers looking for jobs. As a result, employers can hold down\non pay increases\u2014or perhaps even replace some of their higher-paid workers with unemployed people willing\nto accept a lower wage. As wages stagnate or fall, this decline in the price of a key input means that the short-\nrun Keynesian aggregate supply curve shifts to the right from its original (SRAS to SRAS ). The overall impact\n0 1\nin the long run, as the macroeconomic equilibrium shifts from E to E to E , is that the level of output returns\n0 1 2\nto potential GDP, where it started. There is, however, downward pressure on the price level. Thus, in the\nneoclassical view, changes in aggregate demand can have a short-run impact on output and on\nunemployment\u2014but only a short-run impact. In the long run, when wages and prices are flexible, potential\nGDP and aggregate supply determine real GDP's size.\nHow Fast Is the Speed of Macroeconomic Adjustment?\nHow long does it take for wages and prices to adjust, and for the economy to rebound to its potential GDP? This\nsubject is highly contentious. Keynesian economists argue that if the adjustment from recession to potential\nGDP takes a very long time, then neoclassical theory may be more hypothetical than practical. In response to\nJohn Maynard Keynes' immortal words, \u201cIn the long run we are all dead,\u201d neoclassical economists respond that\neven if the adjustment takes as long as, say, ten years the neoclassical perspective remains of central\nimportance in understanding the economy.\nOne subset of neoclassical economists holds that wage and price adjustment in the macroeconomy might be\nquite rapid. The theory ofrational expectationsholds that people form the most accurate possible\nexpectations about the future that they can, using all information available to them. In an economy where most\npeople have rational expectations, economic adjustments may happen very quickly.\nTo understand how rational expectations may affect the speed of price adjustments, think about a situation in\nthe real estate market. Imagine that several events seem likely to push up home values in the neighborhood.\nPerhaps a local employer announces that it plans to hire many more people or the city announces that it will 634 26 \u2022 The Neoclassical Perspective\nbuild a local park or a library in that neighborhood. The theory of rational expectations points out that even\nthough none of the changes will happen immediately, home prices in the neighborhood will rise immediately,\nbecause the expectation that homes will be worth more in the future will lead buyers to be willing to pay more\nin the present. The amount of the immediate increase in home prices will depend on how likely it seems that\nthe announcements about the future will actually happen and on how distant the local jobs and neighborhood\nimprovements are in the future. The key point is that, because of rational expectations, prices do not wait on\nevents, but adjust immediately.\nAt a macroeconomic level, the theory of rational expectations points out that if the aggregate supply curve is\nvertical over time, then people should rationally expect this pattern. When a shift in aggregate demand occurs,\npeople and businesses with rational expectations will know that its impact on output and employment will be\ntemporary, while its impact on the price level will be permanent. If firms and workers perceive the outcome of\nthe process in advance, and if all firms and workers know that everyone else is perceiving the process in the\nsame way, then they have no incentive to go through an extended series of short-run scenarios, like a firm first\nhiring more people when aggregate demand shifts out and then firing those same people when aggregate\nsupply shifts back. Instead, everyone will recognize where this process is heading\u2014toward a change in the\nprice level\u2014and then will act on that expectation. In this scenario, the expected long-run change in the price\nlevel may happen very quickly, without a drawn-out zigzag of output and employment first moving one way\nand then the other.\nThe theory that people and firms have rational expectations can be a useful simplification, but as a statement\nabout how people and businesses actually behave, the assumption seems too strong. After all, many people\nand firms are not especially well informed, either about what is happening in the economy or about how the\neconomy works. An alternate assumption is that people and firms act withadaptive expectations: they look at\npast experience and gradually adapt their beliefs and behavior as circumstances change, but are not perfect\nsynthesizers of information and accurate predictors of the future in the sense of rational expectations theory.\nIf most people and businesses have some form of adaptive expectations, then the adjustment from the short\nrun and long run will be traced out in incremental steps that occur over time.\nThe empirical evidence on the speed of macroeconomic adjustment of prices and wages is not clear-cut. The\nspeed of macroeconomic adjustment probably varies among different countries and time periods. A\nreasonable guess is that the initial short-run effect of a shift in aggregate demand might last two to five years,\nbefore the adjustments in wages and prices cause the economy to adjust back to potential GDP. Thus, one\nmight think of the short run for applying Keynesian analysis as time periods less than two to five years, and the\nlong run for applying neoclassical analysis as longer than five years. For practical purposes, this guideline is\nfrustratingly imprecise, but when analyzing a complex social mechanism like an economy as it evolves over\ntime, some imprecision seems unavoidable.\n26.2The Policy Implications of the Neoclassical Perspective\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Discuss why and how economists measure inflation expectations\n\u2022 Analyze the impacts of fiscal and monetary policy on aggregate supply and aggregate demand\n\u2022 Explain the neoclassical Phillips curve, noting its tradeoff between inflation and unemployment\n\u2022 Identify clear distinctions between neoclassical economics and Keynesian economics\nTo understand the policy recommendations of the neoclassical economists, it helps to start with the Keynesian\nperspective. Suppose a decrease in aggregate demand causes the economy to go into recession with high\nunemployment. The Keynesian response would be to use government policy to stimulate aggregate demand\nand eliminate the recessionary gap. The neoclassical economists believe that the Keynesian response, while\nperhaps well intentioned, will not have a good outcome for reasons we will discuss shortly. Since the\nneoclassical economists believe that the economy will correct itself over time, the only advantage of a\nAccess for free at openstax.org 26.2 \u2022 The Policy Implications of the Neoclassical Perspective 635\nKeynesian stabilization policy would be to accelerate the process and minimize the time that the unemployed\nare out of work. Is that the likely outcome?\nKeynesian macroeconomic policy requires some optimism about the government's ability to recognize a\nsituation of too little or too muchaggregate demand, and to adjust aggregate demand accordingly with the\nright level of changes in taxes or spending, all enacted in a timely fashion. After all, neoclassical economists\nargue, it takes government statisticians months to produce even preliminary estimates of GDP so that\npoliticians know whether a recession is occurring\u2014and those preliminary estimates may be revised\nsubstantially later. Moreover, there is the question of timely action. The political process can take more months\nto enact a tax cut or a spending increase. Political or economic considerations may determine the amount of\ntax or spending changes. Then the economy will take still more months to put into effect changes in aggregate\ndemand through spending and production. When economists and policy makers consider all of these time lags\nand political realities, active fiscal policy may fail to address the current problem, and could even make the\nfuture economy worse. The average U.S. post-World War II recession has lasted only about a year. By the time\ngovernment policy activates, the recession will likely be over. As a consequence, the only result of government\nfine-tuning will be to stimulate the economy when it is already recovering (or to contract the economy when it\nis already falling). In other words, an active macroeconomic policy is likely to exacerbate the cycles rather than\ndampen them. Some neoclassical economists believe a large part of the business cycles we observe are due to\nflawed government policy. To learn about this issue further, read the following Clear It Up feature.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhy and how do economists measure inflation expectations?\nPeople take expectations about inflation into consideration every time they make a major purchase, such as a house\nor a car. As inflation fluctuates, so too does the nominal interest rate on loans to buy these goods. The nominal\ninterest rate is comprised of the real rate, plus anexpected inflationfactor. Expected inflation also tells economists\nabout how the public views the economy's direction. Suppose the public expects inflation to increase. This could be\nthe result of positive demand shock due to an expanding economy and increasing aggregate demand. It could also\nbe the result of a negative supply shock, perhaps from rising energy prices, and decreasing aggregate supply. In\neither case, the public may expect the central bank to engage in contractionary monetary policy to reduce inflation,\nand this policy results in higher interest rates. If, however economists expect inflation to decrease, the public may\nanticipate a recession. In turn, the public may expect expansionary monetary policy, and lower interest rates, in the\nshort run. By monitoring expected inflation, economists garner information about the effectiveness of\nmacroeconomic policies. Additionally, monitoring expected inflation allows for projecting the direction of real\ninterest rates that isolate for the effect of inflation. This information is necessary for making decisions about\nfinancing investments.\nExpectations about inflation may seem like a highly theoretical concept, but, in fact the Federal Reserve Bank\nmeasures, inflation expectations based upon early research conducted by Joseph Livingston, a financial journalist\nfor thePhiladelphia Inquirer. In 1946, he started a twice-a-year survey of economists about their expectations of\ninflation. After Livingston's death in 1969, the Federal Reserve Bank and other economic research agencies such as\nthe Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan, the American Statistical Association, and the National\nBureau of Economic Research continued the survey.\nCurrent Federal Reserve research compares these expectations to actual inflation that has occurred, and the\nresults, so far, are mixed. Economists' forecasts, however, have become notably more accurate in the last few\ndecades. Economists are actively researching how inflation expectations and other economic variables form and\nchange. 636 26 \u2022 The Neoclassical Perspective\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-commentary/\neconomic-commentary-archives/2009-economic-commentaries/ec-20090809-a-new-approach-to-gauging-\ninflation-expectations.aspx)to read \u201cThe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\u2019s Economic Commentary: A New\nApproach to Gauging Inflation Expectations\u201d by Joseph G. Haubrich for more information about how\neconomists forecast expected inflation.\nThe Neoclassical Phillips Curve Tradeoff\nThe Keynesian Perspectiveintroduced thePhillips curveand explained how it is derived from the aggregate\nsupply curve. The short run upward sloping aggregate supply curve implies a downward sloping Phillips\ncurve; thus, there is a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment in the short run. By contrast, a\nneoclassical long-run aggregate supply curve will imply a vertical shape for the Phillips curve, indicating no\nlong run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.Figure 26.6(a) shows the vertical AS curve, with three\ndifferent levels of aggregate demand, resulting in three different equilibria, at three different price levels. At\nevery point along that vertical AS curve, potential GDP and the rate of unemployment remains the same.\nAssume that for this economy, the natural rate of unemployment is 5%. As a result, the long-run Phillips curve\nrelationship, inFigure 26.6(b), is a vertical line, rising up from 5% unemployment, at any level of inflation.\nRead the following Work It Out feature for additional information on how to interpret inflation and\nunemployment rates.\nFIGURE26.6From a Long-Run AS Curve to a Long-Run Phillips Curve(a) With a vertical LRAS curve, shifts in\naggregate demand do not alter the level of output but do lead to changes in the price level. Because output is\nunchanged between the equilibria E , E , and E , all unemployment in this economy will be due to the natural rate of\n0 1 2\nunemployment. (b) If the natural rate of unemployment is 5%, then the Phillips curve will be vertical. That is,\nregardless of changes in the price level, the unemployment rate remains at 5%.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 26.2 \u2022 The Policy Implications of the Neoclassical Perspective 637\nWORK IT OUT\nTracking Inflation and Unemployment Rates\nSuppose that you have collected data for years on inflation and unemployment rates and recorded them in a\ntable, such asTable 26.1. How do you interpret that information?\nYear Inflation Rate Unemployment Rate\n1970 2% 4%\n1975 3% 3%\n1980 2% 4%\n1985 1% 6%\n1990 1% 4%\n1995 4% 2%\n2000 5% 4%\nTABLE26.1\nStep 1. Plot the data points in a graph with inflation rate on the vertical axis and unemployment rate on the\nhorizontal axis. Your graph will appear similar toFigure 26.7.\nFIGURE26.7Inflation Rates\nStep 2. What patterns do you see in the data? You should notice that there are years when unemployment falls\nbut inflation rises, and other years where unemployment rises and inflation falls.\nStep 3. Can you determine the natural rate of unemployment from the data or from the graph? As you analyze the\ngraph, it appears that the natural rate of unemployment lies at 4%. This is the rate that the economy appears to\nadjust back to after an apparent change in the economy. For example, in 1975 the economy appeared to have an\nincrease in aggregate demand. The unemployment rate fell to 3% but inflation increased from 2% to 3%. By\n1980, the economy had adjusted back to 4% unemployment and the inflation rate had returned to 2%. In 1985,\nthe economy looks to have suffered a recession as unemployment rose to 6% and inflation fell to 1%. This would\nbe consistent with a decrease in aggregate demand. By 1990, the economy recovered back to 4%\nunemployment, but at a lower inflation rate of 1%. In 1995 the economy again rebounded and unemployment\nfell to 2%, but inflation increased to 4%, which is consistent with a large increase in aggregate demand. The 638 26 \u2022 The Neoclassical Perspective\neconomy adjusted back to 4% unemployment but at a higher rate of inflation of 5%. Then in 2000, both\nunemployment and inflation increased to 5% and 4%, respectively.\nStep 4. Do you see the Phillips curve(s) in the data? If we trace the downward sloping trend of data points, we\ncould see a short-run Phillips curve that exhibits the inverse tradeoff between higher unemployment and lower\ninflation rates. If we trace the vertical line of data points, we could see a long-run Phillips curve at the 4% natural\nrate of unemployment.\nThe unemployment rate on the long-run Phillips curve will be the natural rate of unemployment. A small\ninflationary increase in the price level from AD to AD will have the same natural rate of unemployment as a\n0 1\nlarger inflationary increase in the price level from AD to AD . The macroeconomic equilibrium along the\n0 2\nvertical aggregate supply curve can occur at a variety of different price levels, and the natural rate of\nunemployment can be consistent with all different rates of inflation. The great economistMilton Friedman\n(1912\u20132006) summed up the neoclassical view of the long-term Phillips curve tradeoff in a 1967 speech:\n\u201c[T]here is always a temporary trade-off between inflation and unemployment; there is no permanent trade-\noff.\u201d\nIn the Keynesian perspective, the primary focus is on getting the level of aggregate demand right in\nrelationship to an upward-sloping aggregate supply curve. That is, the government should adjust AD so that\nthe economy produces at its potential GDP, not so low that cyclical unemployment results and not so high that\ninflation results. In the neoclassical perspective, aggregate supply will determine output at potential GDP, the\nnatural rate of unemployment determines unemployment, and shifts in aggregate demand are the primary\ndeterminant of changes in the price level.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/modeledbehavior)to read about the effects of economic intervention.\nFighting Unemployment or Inflation?\nAs we explained inUnemployment, economists divide unemployment into two categories:cyclical\nunemploymentand thenatural rate of unemployment, which is the sum of frictional and structural\nunemployment. Cyclical unemployment results from fluctuations in the business cycle and is created when\nthe economy is producing below potential GDP\u2014giving potential employers less incentive to hire. When the\neconomy is producing at potential GDP, cyclical unemployment will be zero. Because of labor market\ndynamics, in which people are always entering or exiting the labor force, the unemployment rate never falls to\n0%, not even when the economy is producing at or even slightly above potential GDP. Probably the best we can\nhope for is for the number of job vacancies to equal the number of job seekers. We know that it takes time for\njob seekers and employers to find each other, and this time is the cause of frictional unemployment. Most\neconomists do not consider frictional unemployment to be a \u201cbad\u201d thing. After all, there will always be workers\nwho are unemployed while looking for a job that is a better match for their skills. There will always be\nemployers that have an open position, while looking for a worker that is a better match for the job. Ideally,\nthese matches happen quickly, but even when the economy is very strong there will be some natural\nunemployment and this is what the natural rate of unemployment measures.\nThe neoclassical view of unemployment tends to focus attention away from the cyclical unemployment\nproblem\u2014that is, unemployment caused by recession\u2014while putting more attention on the unemployment\nrate issue that prevails even when the economy is operating at potential GDP. To put it another way, the\nneoclassical view of unemployment tends to focus on how the government can adjust public policy to reduce\nthe natural rate of unemployment. Such policy changes might involve redesigning unemployment and welfare\nprograms so that they support those in need, but also offer greater encouragement for job-hunting. It might\nAccess for free at openstax.org 26.2 \u2022 The Policy Implications of the Neoclassical Perspective 639\ninvolve redesigning business rules with an eye to whether they are unintentionally discouraging businesses\nfrom taking on new employees. It might involve building institutions to improve the flow of information about\njobs and the mobility of workers, to help bring workers and employers together more quickly. For those\nworkers who find that their skills are permanently no longer in demand (for example, the structurally\nunemployed), economists can design policy to provide opportunities for retraining so that these workers can\nreenter the labor force and seek employment.\nNeoclassical economists will not tend to see aggregate demand as a useful tool for reducing unemployment;\nafter all, with a verticalaggregate supply curvedetermining economic output, then aggregate demand has no\nlong-run effect on unemployment. Instead, neoclassical economists believe that aggregate demand should be\nallowed to expand only to match the gradual shifts of aggregate supply to the right\u2014keeping the price level\nmuch the same and inflationary pressures low.\nIfaggregate demandrises rapidly in the neoclassical model, in the long run it leads only to inflationary\npressures.Figure 26.8shows a vertical LRAS curve and three different levels of aggregate demand, rising from\nAD to AD to AD . As the macroeconomic equilibrium rises from E to E to E , the price level rises, but real\n0 1 2 0 1 2\nGDP does not budge; nor does the rate of unemployment, which adjusts to its natural rate. Conversely,\nreducing inflation has no long-term costs, either. Think aboutFigure 26.8in reverse, as the aggregate demand\ncurve shifts from AD to AD to AD , and the equilibrium moves from E to E to E . During this process, the\n2 1 0 2 1 0\nprice level falls, but, in the long run, neither real GDP nor the natural unemployment rate changes.\nFIGURE26.8How Aggregate Demand Determines the Price Level in the Long RunAs aggregate demand shifts to\nthe right, from AD to AD to AD , real GDP in this economy and the level of unemployment do not change. However,\n0 1 2\nthere is inflationary pressure for a higher price level as the equilibrium changes from E to E to E .\n0 1 2\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/inflatemploy)to read about how inflation and unemployment are\nrelated.\nFighting Recession or Encouraging Long-Term Growth?\nNeoclassical economists believe that the economy will rebound out of a recession or eventually contract during\nan expansion because prices and wage rates are flexible and will adjust either upward or downward to restore\nthe economy to its potential GDP. Thus, the key policy question for neoclassicals is how to promote growth of\npotential GDP. We know that economic growth ultimately depends on the growth rate of long-term productivity. 640 26 \u2022 The Neoclassical Perspective\nProductivity measures how effective inputs are at producing outputs. We know that U.S. productivity has\ngrown on average about 2% per year. That means that the same amount of inputs produce 2% more output\nthan the year before. We also know that productivity growth varies a great deal in the short term due to cyclical\nfactors. It also varies somewhat in the long term. From 1953\u20131972, U.S. labor productivity (as measured by\noutput per hour in the business sector) grew at 3.2% per year. From 1973\u20131992, productivity growth declined\nsignificantly to 1.8% per year. Then, from 1993\u20132010, productivity growth increased to around 2% per year. In\nrecent years, it has grown less than 2% per year, although it did pick up in 2019 and 2020 to over 2% again.\nThe neoclassical economists believe the underpinnings of long-run productivity growth to be an economy\u2019s\ninvestments in human capital, physical capital, and technology, operating together in a market-oriented\nenvironment that rewards innovation. Government policy should focus on promoting these factors.\nSummary of Neoclassical Macroeconomic Policy Recommendations\nLet\u2019s summarize what neoclassical economists recommend for macroeconomic policy. Neoclassical\neconomists do not believe in \u201cfine-tuning\u201d the economy. They believe that a stable economic environment with\na low rate of inflation fosters economic growth. Similarly, tax rates should be low and unchanging. In this\nenvironment, private economic agents can make the best possible investment decisions, which will lead to\noptimal investment in physical and human capital as well as research and development to promote\nimprovements in technology.\nSummary of Neoclassical Economics versus Keynesian Economics\nTable 26.2summarizes the key differences between the two schools of thought.\nSummary Neoclassical Economics Keynesian Economics\nFocus: long-term or short term Long-term Short-term\nPrices and wages: sticky or flexible?

When a circus performer stands on two horses, with a foot on each one, much of\nthe excitement for the viewer lies in contemplating the gap between the two. As modern macroeconomists ride\ninto the future on two horses\u2014with one foot on the short-term Keynesian perspective and one foot on the long-\nterm neoclassical perspective\u2014the balancing act may look uncomfortable, but there does not seem to be any\nway to avoid it. Each approach, Keynesian and neoclassical, has its strengths and weaknesses.\nThe short-term Keynesian model, built on the importance of aggregate demand as a cause of business cycles\nand a degree of wage and price rigidity, does a sound job of explaining many recessions and why cyclical\nunemployment rises and falls. By focusing on the short-run aggregate demand adjustments,Keynesian\neconomicsrisks overlooking the long-term causes of economic growth or the natural rate of unemployment\nthat exist even when the economy is producing at potential GDP.\nThe neoclassical model, with its emphasis on aggregate supply, focuses on the underlying determinants of\noutput and employment in markets, and thus tends to put more emphasis on economic growth and how labor\nmarkets work. However, the neoclassical view is not especially helpful in explaining why unemployment\nmoves up and down over short time horizons of a few years. Nor is the neoclassical model especially helpful\nwhen the economy is mired in an especially deep and long-lasting recession, like the 1930sGreat Depression.\nKeynesian economics tends to view inflation as a price that might sometimes be paid for lower unemployment;\nneoclassical economics tends to view inflation as a cost that offers no offsetting gains in terms of lower\nunemployment.\nMacroeconomics cannot, however, be summed up as an argument between one group of economists who are\npure Keynesians and another group who are pure neoclassicists. Instead, many mainstream economists\nbelieve both the Keynesian and neoclassical perspectives.Robert Solow, the Nobel laureate in economics in\n1987, described the dual approach in this way:\nAt short time scales, I think, something sort of \u2018Keynesian\u2019 is a good approximation, and surely better\nthan anything straight \u2018neoclassical.\u2019 At very long time scales, the interesting questions are best\nstudied in a neoclassical framework, and attention to the Keynesian side of things would be a minor\ndistraction. At the five-to-ten-year time scale, we have to piece things together as best we can, and\nlook for a hybrid model that will do the job.\nMany modern macroeconomists spend considerable time and energy trying to construct models that blend the\nmost attractive aspects of the Keynesian and neoclassical approaches. It is possible to construct a somewhat\ncomplex mathematical model where aggregate demand and sticky wages and prices matter in the short run,\nbut wages, prices, and aggregate supply adjust in the long run. However, creating an overall model that\nencompasses both short-term Keynesian and long-term neoclassical models is not easy.\nBRING IT HOME\nNavigating Uncharted Waters\u2014The Great Recession and Pandemic-Induced Recession of 2020\nWere the policies that the government implemented to stabilize the economy and financial markets during the Great\nRecession of 2007\u20132009, and the pandemic-induced recession of 2020 effective? Many economists from both the\nKeynesian and neoclassical schools have found that they were, although to varying degrees. Regarding the Great\nRecession, Alan Blinder of Princeton University and Mark Zandi for Moody\u2019s Analytics found that, without fiscal 642 26 \u2022 The Neoclassical Perspective\npolicy, GDP decline would have been significantly more than its 3.3% in 2008 followed by its 0.1% decline in 2009.\nThey also estimated that there would have been 8.5 million more job losses had the government not intervened in\nthe market with the TARP to support the financial industry and key automakers General Motors and Chrysler.\nFederal Reserve Bank economists Carlos Carvalho, Stefano Eusip, and Christian Grisse found in their study,Policy\nInitiatives in the Global Recession: What Did Forecasters Expect?that once the government implemented policies,\nforecasters adapted their expectations to these policies. They were more likely to anticipate increases in investment\ndue to lower interest rates brought on by monetary policy and increased economic growth resulting from fiscal\npolicy.\nThe neoclassical perspective can also shed light on the country\u2019s experience with policy during the pandemic-\ninduced recession of 2020. It was mentioned earlier that one criticism made by proponents of the neoclassical\nperspective is that government policy is often too slow to react to a recession. However after the pandemic hit, the\nfederal government quickly responded with aid to state and local governments, increased unemployment insurance,\naid to businesses forced to shut down, and stimulus checks to boost spending. There is no doubt that the economic\nfallout from the pandemic would have been much worse without these policies. Some economists even argue that\nthe government helped too much and that the high inflation the U.S. economy experienced starting mid-2021 is due\nto the real output growing faster than potential, but it is too early (as of early 2022) to tell if that argument is correct.\nBy focusing on potential GDP instead of short-run demand, the neoclassical perspective also makes an important\npoint about how the size of the economy determines its ability to grow. Since the pandemic hit, millions of workers\nhave stayed out of the labor market due to early retirement, health and safety concerns, the availability of childcare,\nand school closures. As mentioned inUnemployment, these changes have caused labor force participation to\nremain lower than its historical average. The pandemic has also made it harder for future workers to acquire skills\nthey need to be productive in the labor market. The longer these dynamics are at play, the more harm it will do to\npotential GDP.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 26 \u2022 Key Terms 643\nKey Terms\nadaptive expectations the theory that people look at past experience and gradually adapt their beliefs and\nbehavior as circumstances change\nexpected inflation a future rate of inflation that consumers and firms build into current decision making\nneoclassical perspective the philosophy that, in the long run, the business cycle will fluctuate around the\npotential, or full-employment, level of output\nphysical capital per person the amount and kind of machinery and equipment available to help a person\nproduce a good or service\nrational expectations the theory that people form the most accurate possible expectations about the future\nthat they can, using all information available to them\nKey Concepts and Summary\n26.1The Building Blocks of Neoclassical Analysis\nThe neoclassical perspective argues that, in the long run, the economy will adjust back to its potential GDP\nlevel of output through flexible price levels. Thus, the neoclassical perspective views the long-run AS curve as\nvertical. A rational expectations perspective argues that people have excellent information about economic\nevents and how the economy works and that, as a result, price and other economic adjustments will happen\nvery quickly. In adaptive expectations theory, people have limited information about economic information\nand how the economy works, and so price and other economic adjustments can be slow.\n26.2The Policy Implications of the Neoclassical Perspective\nNeoclassical economists tend to put relatively more emphasis on long-term growth than on fighting recession,\nbecause they believe that recessions will fade in a few years and long-term growth will ultimately determine\nthe standard of living. They tend to focus more on reducing the natural rate of unemployment caused by\neconomic institutions and government policies than the cyclical unemployment caused by recession.\nNeoclassical economists also see no social benefit to inflation. With an upward-sloping Keynesian AS curve,\ninflation can arise because an economy is approaching full employment. With a vertical long-run neoclassical\nAS curve, inflation does not accompany any rise in output. If aggregate supply is vertical, then aggregate\ndemand does not affect the quantity of output. Instead, aggregate demand can only cause inflationary changes\nin the price level. A vertical aggregate supply curve, where the quantity of output is consistent with many\ndifferent price levels, also implies a vertical Phillips curve.\n26.3Balancing Keynesian and Neoclassical Models\nThe Keynesian perspective considers changes to aggregate demand to be the cause of business cycle\nfluctuations. Keynesians are likely to advocate that policy makers actively attempt to reverse recessionary and\ninflationary periods because they are not convinced that the self-correcting economy can easily return to full\nemployment.\nThe neoclassical perspective places more emphasis on aggregate supply. Neoclassical economists believe that\nlong term productivity growth determines the potential GDP level and that the economy typically will return to\nfull employment after a change in aggregate demand. Skeptical of the effectiveness and timeliness of\nKeynesian policy, neoclassical economists are more likely to advocate a hands-off, or fairly limited, role for\nactive stabilization policy.\nWhile Keynesians would tend to advocate an acceptable tradeoff between inflation and unemployment when\ncounteracting a recession, neoclassical economists argue that no such tradeoff exists. Any short-term gains in\nlower unemployment will eventually vanish and the result of active policy will only be inflation. 644 26 \u2022 Self-Check Questions\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

The answer is: Both. For\ncenturies, people used the extremely durable cowrie shell as a medium of exchange in various parts of the world.\n(Credit: modification of \u201cCowry Shell (Cypraeidae)\u201d by Silke Baron/Flickr Creative Commons, CC BY 2.0)\nCHAPTER OBJECTIVES\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\u2022 Defining Money by Its Functions\n\u2022 Measuring Money: Currency, M1, and M2\n\u2022 The Role of Banks\n\u2022 How Banks Create Money\nIntroduction to Money and Banking\nBRING IT HOME\nThe Many Disguises of Money: From Cowries to Crypto\nHere is a trivia question: In the history of the world, what item did people use for money over the broadest\ngeographic area and for the longest period of time? The answer is not gold, silver, or any precious metal. It is the\ncowrie, a mollusk shell found mainly off the Maldives Islands in the Indian Ocean. Cowries served as money as early\nas 700 B.C. in China. By the 1500s, they were in widespread use across India and Africa. For several centuries after\nthat, cowries were the means for exchange in markets including southern Europe, western Africa, India, and China:\neverything from buying lunch or a ferry ride to paying for a shipload of silk or rice. Cowries were still acceptable as a 648 27 \u2022 Money and Banking\nway of paying taxes in certain African nations in the early twentieth century.\nWhat made cowries work so well as money? First, they are extremely durable\u2014lasting a century or more. As the late\neconomic historian Karl Polyani put it, they can be \u201cpoured, sacked, shoveled, hoarded in heaps\u201d while remaining\n\u201cclean, dainty, stainless, polished, and milk-white.\u201d Second, parties could use cowries either by counting shells of a\ncertain size, or\u2014for large purchases\u2014by measuring the weight or volume of the total shells they would exchange.\nThird, it was impossible to counterfeit a cowrie shell, but dishonest people could counterfeit gold or silver coins by\nmaking copies with cheaper metals. Finally, in the heyday of cowrie money, from the 1500s into the 1800s,\ngovernments, first the Portuguese, then the Dutch and English, tightly controlled collecting cowries. As a result, the\nsupply of cowries grew quickly enough to serve the needs of commerce, but not so quickly that they were no longer\nscarce. Money throughout the ages has taken many different forms and continues to evolve even today with the\nadvent of cryptocurrency. What do you think money is?\nThe discussion of money and banking is a central component in studying macroeconomics. At this point, you\nshould have firmly in mind the main goals of macroeconomics fromWelcome to Economics!:economic\ngrowth, lowunemployment, and lowinflation. We have yet to discuss money and its role in helping to achieve\nour macroeconomic goals.\nYou should also understand Keynesian and neoclassical frameworks for macroeconomic analysis and how we\ncan embody these frameworks in theaggregate demand/aggregate supply (AD/AS)model. With the goals and\nframeworks for macroeconomic analysis in mind, the final step is to discuss the two main categories of\nmacroeconomic policy: monetary policy, which focuses on money, banking and interest rates; and fiscal\npolicy, which focuses on government spending, taxes, and borrowing. This chapter discusses what economists\nmean by money, and how money is closely interrelated with the banking system.Monetary Policy and Bank\nRegulationfurthers this discussion.\n27.1Defining Money by Its Functions\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain the various functions of money\n\u2022 Contrast commodity money and fiat money\nMoney for the sake of money is not an end in itself. You cannot eat dollar bills or wear your bank account.\nUltimately, the usefulness of money rests in exchanging it for goods or services. As the American writer and\nhumorist Ambrose Bierce (1842\u20131914) wrote in 1911, money is a \u201cblessing that is of no advantage to us\nexcepting when we part with it.\u201d Money is what people regularly use when purchasing or selling goods and\nservices, and thus both buyers and sellers must widely accept money. This concept of money is intentionally\nflexible, because money has taken a wide variety of forms in different cultures.\nBarter and the Double Coincidence of Wants\nTo understand the usefulness of money, we must consider what the world would be like without money. How\nwould people exchange goods and services? Economies without money typically engage in the barter system.\nBarter\u2014literally trading one good or service for another\u2014is highly inefficient for trying to coordinate the\ntrades in a modern advanced economy. In an economy without money, an exchange between two people would\ninvolve adouble coincidence of wants, a situation in which two people each want some good or service that\nthe other person can provide. For example, if an accountant wants a pair of shoes, this accountant must find\nsomeone who has a pair of shoes in the correct size and who is willing to exchange the shoes for some hours of\naccounting services. Such a trade is likely to be difficult to arrange. Think about the complexity of such trades\nin a modern economy, with its extensive division of labor that involves thousands upon thousands of different\njobs and goods.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 27.1 \u2022 Defining Money by Its Functions 649\nAnother problem with the barter system is that it does not allow us to easily enter into future contracts for\npurchasing many goods and services. For example, if the goods are perishable it may be difficult to exchange\nthem for other goods in the future. Imagine a farmer wanting to buy a tractor in six months using a fresh crop\nof strawberries. Additionally, while the barter system might work adequately in small economies, it will keep\nthese economies from growing. The time that individuals would otherwise spend producing goods and\nservices and enjoying leisure time they spend bartering.\nFunctions for Money\nMoney solves the problems that the barter system creates. (We will get to its definition soon.) First, money\nserves as amedium of exchange, which means that money acts as an intermediary between the buyer and the\nseller. Instead of exchanging accounting services for shoes, the accountant now exchanges accounting services\nfor money. The accountant then uses this money to buy shoes. To serve as a medium of exchange, people must\nwidely accept money as a method of payment in the markets for goods, labor, and financial capital.\nSecond, money must serve as astore of value. In a barter system, we saw the example of the shoemaker\ntrading shoes for accounting services. However, she risks having her shoes go out of style, especially if she\nkeeps them in a warehouse for future use\u2014their value will decrease with each season. Shoes are not a good\nstore of value. Holding money is a much easier way of storing value. You know that you do not need to spend it\nimmediately because it will still hold its value the next day, or the next year. This function of money does not\nrequire that money is aperfectstore of value. In an economy with inflation, money loses some buying power\neach year, but it remains money.\nThird, money serves as aunit of account, which means that it is the ruler by which we measure values. For\nexample, an accountant may charge $100 to file your tax return. That $100 can purchase two pair of shoes at\n$50 a pair. Money acts as a common denominator, an accounting method that simplifies thinking about trade-\noffs.\nFinally, another function of money is that it must serve as astandard of deferred payment. This means that if\nmoney is usable today to make purchases, it must also be acceptable to make purchases today that the\npurchaser will pay in thefuture. Loans and future agreements are stated in monetary terms and the standard\nof deferred payment is what allows us to buy goods and services today and pay in the future. Thus,money\nserves all of these functions\u2014 it is a medium of exchange, store of value, unit of account, and standard of\ndeferred payment.\nCommodity versus Fiat Money\nMoney has taken a wide variety of forms in different cultures. People have used gold, silver, cowrie shells,\ncigarettes, and even cocoa beans as money. Although we use these items ascommodity money, they also have\na value from use as something other than money. For example, people have used gold throughout the ages as\nmoney although today we do not use it as money but rather value it for its other attributes. Gold is a good\nconductor of electricity and the electronics and aerospace industry use it. Other industries use gold too, such\nas to manufacture energy efficient reflective glass for skyscrapers and is used in the medical industry as well.\nOf course, gold also has value because of its beauty and malleability in creating jewelry.\nAs commodity money, gold has historically served its purpose as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and\nas a unit of account.Commodity-backed currenciesare dollar bills or other currencies with values backed up\nby gold or other commodities held at a bank. During much of its history, gold and silver backed the money\nsupply in the United States. Interestingly, antique dollars dated as late as 1957, have \u201cSilver Certificate\u201d\nprinted over the portrait of George Washington, asFigure 27.2shows. This meant that the holder could take\nthe bill to the appropriate bank and exchange it for a dollar\u2019s worth of silver. 650 27 \u2022 Money and Banking\nFIGURE27.2A Silver Certificate and a Modern U.S. BillUntil 1958, silver certificates were commodity-backed\nmoney\u2014backed by silver, as indicated by the words \u201cSilver Certificate\u201d printed on the bill. Today, The Federal\nReserve backs U.S. bills, but as fiat money (inconvertible paper money made legal tender by a government decree).\n(Credit: \"One Dollar Bills\" by \u201cThe.Comedian\u201d/Flickr Creative Commons, CC BY 2.0)\nAs economies grew and became more global in nature, the use of commodity monies became more\ncumbersome. Countries moved towards the use offiat money. Fiat money has no intrinsic value, but is\ndeclared by a government to be a country's legal tender. The United States\u2019 paper money, for example, carries\nthe statement: \u201cTHIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE.\u201d In other words, by\ngovernment decree, if you owe a debt, then legally speaking, you can pay that debt with the U.S. currency, even\nthough it is not backed by a commodity. The only backing of our money is universal faith and trust that the\ncurrency has value, and nothing more.\nLINK IT UP\nWatch thisvideo(http://openstax.org/l/moneyhistory)on the \u201cHistory of Money.\u201d\n27.2Measuring Money: Currency, M1, and M2\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Contrast M1 money supply and M2 money supply\n\u2022 Classify monies as M1 money supply or M2 money supply\nCash in your pocket certainly serves as money; however, what about checks or credit cards? Are they money,\ntoo? Rather than trying to state a single way of measuring money, economists offer broader definitions of\nmoney based on liquidity.Liquidityrefers to how quickly you can use a financial asset to buy a good or service.\nFor example, cash is very liquid. You can use your $10 bill easily to buy a hamburger at lunchtime. However,\n$10 that you have in your savings account is not so easy to use. You must go to the bank or ATM machine and\nwithdraw that cash to buy your lunch. Thus, $10 in your savings account islessliquid.\nTheFederal Reserve Bank, which is the central bank of the United States, is a bank regulator and is\nresponsible for monetary policy and defines money according to its liquidity. There are two definitions of\nmoney: M1 and M2 money supply. Historically,M1 money supplyincluded those monies that are very liquid\nsuch as cash, checkable (demand) deposits, and traveler\u2019s checks, whileM2 money supplyincluded those\nmonies that are less liquid in nature; M2 included M1 plus savings and time deposits, certificates of deposits,\nand money market funds. Beginning in May 2020, the Federal Reserve changed the definition of both M1 and\nAccess for free at openstax.org 27.2 \u2022 Measuring Money: Currency, M1, and M2 651\nM2. The biggest change is that savings moved to be part of M1. M1 money supply now includes cash, checkable\n(demand) deposits, and savings. M2 money supply is now measured as M1 plus time deposits, certificates of\ndeposits, and money market funds.\nM1 money supply includescoins and currency in circulation\u2014the coins and bills that circulate in an\neconomy that the U.S. Treasury does not hold at the Federal Reserve Bank, or in bank vaults. Closely related to\ncurrency are checkable deposits, also known asdemand deposits. These are the amounts held in checking\naccounts. They are called demand deposits or checkable deposits because the banking institution must give\nthe deposit holder his money \u201con demand\u201d when the customer writes a check or uses a debit card. These items\ntogether\u2014currency, and checking accounts in banks\u2014comprise the definition of money known as M1, which\nthe Federal Reserve System measures daily.\nAs mentioned, M1 now includessavings depositsin banks, which are bank accounts on which you cannot\nwrite a check directly, but from which you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or\nbank.\nA broader definition of money, M2 includes everything in M1 but also adds other types of deposits. Many banks\nand other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest inmoney market funds, where they pool together\nthe deposits of many individual investors and invest them in a safe way, such as short-term government bonds.\nAnother ingredient of M2 are the relatively small (that is, less than about $100,000)certificates of deposit (CDs)\nortime deposits, which are accounts that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain\nperiod of time, ranging from a few months to a few years, in exchange for a higher interest rate. In short, all\nthese types of M2 are money that you can withdraw and spend, but which require a greater effort to do so than\nthe items in M1.Figure 27.3should help in visualizing the relationship between M1 and M2. Note that M1 is\nincluded in the M2 calculation. 652 27 \u2022 Money and Banking\nFIGURE27.3The Relationship between M1 and M2 MoneyM1 and M2 money have several definitions, ranging from\nnarrow to broad. M1 = coins and currency in circulation + checkable (demand) deposit + savings deposits. M2 = M1\n+ money market funds + certificates of deposit + other time deposits.\nThe Federal Reserve System is responsible for tracking the amounts of M1 and M2 and prepares a weekly\nrelease of information about the money supply. To provide an idea of what these amounts sound like,\naccording to the Federal Reserve Bank\u2019s measure of the U.S. money stock, at the end of November 2021, M1 in\nthe United States was $20.3 trillion, while M2 was $21.4 trillion.Table 27.1provides a breakdown of the\nportion of each type of money that comprised M1 and M2 in November 2021, as provided by the Federal\nReserve Bank.\nComponents of M1 in the U.S. (November 2021, Seasonally Adjusted) $ billions\nCurrency $2,114.6\nDemand deposits $4,764.1\nSavings and other liquid deposits $13,466.3\nTotal M1 $20,345 (or $21.4 trillion)\nTABLE27.1M1 and M2 Federal Reserve Statistical Release, Money Stock Measures(Source: Federal\nReserve Statistical Release, http://www.federalreserve.gov/RELEASES/h6/current/\ndefault.htm#t2tg1link)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 27.2 \u2022 Measuring Money: Currency, M1, and M2 653\nComponents of M2 in the U.S. (November 2021, Seasonally Adjusted) $ billions\nM1 money supply $19,221\nSmall-denomination time deposits $120\nRetail money market fund balances $1,027\nTotal M2 $20,368 (or $20 trillion)\nTABLE27.1M1 and M2 Federal Reserve Statistical Release, Money Stock Measures(Source: Federal\nReserve Statistical Release, http://www.federalreserve.gov/RELEASES/h6/current/\ndefault.htm#t2tg1link)\nThe lines separating M1 and M2 can become a little blurry. Sometimes businesses do not treat elements of M1\nalike. For example, some businesses will not accept personal checks for large amounts, but will accept\ntraveler\u2019s checks or cash. Changes in banking practices and technology have made the savings accounts in M2\nmore similar to the checking accounts in M1. For example, some savings accounts will allow depositors to\nwrite checks, use automatic teller machines, and pay bills over the internet, which has made it easier to access\nsavings accounts. As with many other economic terms and statistics, the important point is to know the\nstrengths and limitations of the various definitions of money, not to believe that such definitions are as clear-\ncut to economists as, say, the definition of nitrogen is to chemists.\nWhere does \u201cplastic money\u201d like debit cards, credit cards, and smart money fit into this picture? Adebit card,\nlike a check, is an instruction to the user\u2019s bank to transfer money directly and immediately from your bank\naccount to the seller. It is important to note that in our definition of money, it ischeckable depositsthat are\nmoney, not the paper check or the debit card. Although you can make a purchase with acredit card, the\nfinancial institution does not consider it money but rather a short term loan from the credit card company to\nyou. When you make a credit card purchase, the credit card company immediately transfers money from its\nchecking account to the seller, and at the end of the month, the credit card company sends you a bill for what\nyou have charged that month. Until you pay the credit card bill, you have effectively borrowed money from the\ncredit card company. With asmart card, you can store a certain value of money on the card and then use the\ncard to make purchases. Some \u201csmart cards\u201d used for specific purposes, like long-distance phone calls or\nmaking purchases at a campus bookstore and cafeteria, are not really all that smart, because you can only use\nthem for certain purchases or in certain places.\nIn short, credit cards, debit cards, and smart cards are different ways to move money when you make a\npurchase. However, having more credit cards or debit cards does not change the quantity of money in the\neconomy, any more than printing more checks increases the amount of money in your checking account.\nOne key message underlying this discussion of M1 and M2 is that money in a modern economy is not just\npaper bills and coins. Instead, money is closely linked to bank accounts. The banking system largely conducts\nmacroeconomic policies concerning money. The next section explains how banks function and how a nation\u2019s\nbanking system has the power to create money.\nLINK IT UP\nRead a briefarticle(http://openstax.org/l/Sweden)on the monetary challenges in Sweden. 654 27 \u2022 Money and Banking\n27.3The Role of Banks\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain how banks act as intermediaries between savers and borrowers\n\u2022 Evaluate the relationship between banks, savings and loans, and credit unions\n\u2022 Analyze the causes of bankruptcy and recessions\nSomebody once asked the late bank robber named Willie Sutton why he robbed banks. He answered: \u201cThat\u2019s\nwhere the money is.\u201d While this may have been true at one time, from the perspective of modern economists,\nSutton is both right and wrong. He is wrong because the overwhelming majority of money in the economy is\nnot in the form of currency sitting in vaults or drawers at banks, waiting for a robber to appear. Most money is\nin the form of bank accounts, which exist only as electronic records on computers. From a broader\nperspective, however, the bank robber was more right than he may have known. Banking is intimately\ninterconnected with money and consequently, with the broader economy.\nBanks make it far easier for a complex economy to carry out the extraordinary range of transactions that occur\nin goods, labor, and financial capital markets. Imagine for a moment what the economy would be like if\neverybody had to make all payments in cash. When shopping for a large purchase or going on vacation you\nmight need to carry hundreds of dollars in a pocket or purse. Even small businesses would need stockpiles of\ncash to pay workers and to purchase supplies. A bank allows people and businesses to store this money in\neither a checking account or savings account, for example, and then withdraw this money as needed through\nthe use of a direct withdrawal, writing a check, or using a debit card.\nBanks are a critical intermediary in what we call thepayment system, which helps an economy exchange\ngoods and services for money or other financial assets. Also, those with extra money that they would like to\nsave can store their money in a bank rather than look for an individual who is willing to borrow it from them\nand then repay them at a later date. Those who want to borrow money can go directly to a bank rather than\ntrying to find someone to lend them cash.Transaction costsare the costs associated with finding a lender or a\nborrower for this money. Thus, banks lower transactions costs and act as financial intermediaries\u2014they bring\nsavers and borrowers together. Along with making transactions much safer and easier, banks also play a key\nrole in creating money.\nBanks as Financial Intermediaries\nAn \u201cintermediary\u201d is one who stands between two other parties. Banks are afinancial intermediary\u2014that is,\nan institution that operates between a saver who deposits money in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan\nfrom that bank. Financial intermediaries include other institutions in the financial market such as insurance\ncompanies and pension funds, but we will not include them in this discussion because they are notdepository\ninstitutions, which are institutions that accept moneydepositsand then use these to make loans. All the\ndeposited funds mingle in one big pool, which the financial institution then lends.Figure 27.4illustrates the\nposition of banks as financial intermediaries, with deposits flowing into a bank and loans flowing out. Of\ncourse, when banks make loans to firms, the banks will try to funnel financial capital to healthy businesses\nthat have good prospects for repaying the loans, not to firms that are suffering losses and may be unable to\nrepay.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 27.3 \u2022 The Role of Banks 655\nFIGURE27.4Banks as Financial IntermediariesBanks act as financial intermediaries because they stand between\nsavers and borrowers. Savers place deposits with banks, and then receive interest payments and withdraw money.\nBorrowers receive loans from banks and repay the loans with interest. In turn, banks return money to savers in the\nform of withdrawals, which also include interest payments from banks to savers.\nCLEAR IT UP\nHow are banks, savings and loans, and credit unions related?\nBanks have a couple of close cousins: savings institutions and credit unions. Banks, as we explained, receive\ndeposits from individuals and businesses and make loans with the money. Savings institutions are also sometimes\ncalled \u201csavings and loans\u201d or \u201cthrifts.\u201d They also take loans and make deposits. However, from the 1930s until the\n1980s, federal law limited how much interest savings institutions were allowed to pay to depositors. They were also\nrequired to make most of their loans in the form of housing-related loans, either to homebuyers or to real-estate\ndevelopers and builders.\nAcredit unionis a nonprofit financial institution that its members own and run. Members of each credit union decide\nwho is eligible to be a member. Usually, potential members would be everyone in a certain community, or groups of\nemployees, or members of a certain organization. The credit union accepts deposits from members and focuses on\nmaking loans back to its members. While there are more credit unions than banks and more banks than savings and\nloans, the total assets of credit unions are growing.\nIn 2008, there were 7,085 banks. Due to the bank failures of 2007\u20132009 and bank mergers, there were 5,571\nbanks in the United States at the end of the fourth quarter in 2014. By 2020, there were 4,374 commercial banks\nand 627 savings institutions. According to the National Credit Union Association, as of September 2021 there were\n4,990 credit unions with assets totaling $2.0 trillion. A day of \u201cTransfer Your Money\u201d took place in 2009 out of\ngeneral public disgust with big bank bailouts. People were encouraged to transfer their deposits to credit unions.\nThis has grown into the ongoing Move Your Money Project. Consequently, some now hold assets with a total value as\nlarge as $111 billion.\nA Bank\u2019s Balance Sheet\nAbalance sheetis an accounting tool that lists assets and liabilities. Anassetis something of value that you\nown and you can use to produce something. For example, you can use the cash you own to pay your tuition. If\nyou own a home, this is also an asset. Aliabilityis a debt or something you owe. Many people borrow money to\nbuy homes. In this case, a home is the asset, but the mortgage is the liability. Thenet worthis the asset value\nminus how much is owed (the liability). A bank\u2019s balance sheet operates in much the same way. A bank\u2019s net\nworth asbank capital. We also refer to a bank has assets such as cash held in its vaults, monies that the bank 656 27 \u2022 Money and Banking\nholds at the Federal Reserve bank (called \u201creserves\u201d), loans that it makes to customers, and bonds.\nFigure 27.5illustrates a hypothetical and simplified balance sheet for the Safe and Secure Bank. Because of the\ntwo-column format of the balance sheet, with the T-shape formed by the vertical line down the middle and the\nhorizontal line under \u201cAssets\u201d and \u201cLiabilities,\u201d we sometimes call it aT-account.\nFIGURE27.5A Balance Sheet for the Safe and Secure Bank\nThe \u201cT\u201d in a T-account separates the assets of a firm, on the left, from its liabilities, on the right. All firms use\nT-accounts, though most are much more complex. For a bank, the assets are the financial instruments that\neither the bank is holding (its reserves) or those instruments where other parties owe money to the bank\u2014like\nloans made by the bank and U.S. Government Securities, such as U.S. treasury bonds purchased by the bank.\nLiabilities are what the bank owes to others. Specifically, the bank owes any deposits made in the bank to those\nwho have made them. The net worth of the bank is the total assets minus total liabilities. Net worth is included\non the liabilities side to have the T account balance to zero. For a healthy business, net worth will be positive.\nFor a bankrupt firm, net worth will be negative. In either case, on a bank\u2019s T-account, assets will always equal\nliabilities plus net worth.\nWhen bank customers deposit money into a checking account, savings account, or a certificate of deposit, the\nbank views these deposits as liabilities. After all, the bank owes these deposits to its customers, when the\ncustomers wish to withdraw their money. In the example inFigure 27.5, the Safe and Secure Bank holds $10\nmillion in deposits.\nLoans are the first category of bank assets inFigure 27.5. Say that a family takes out a 30-year mortgage loan to\npurchase a house, which means that the borrower will repay the loan over the next 30 years. This loan is\nclearly an asset from the bank\u2019s perspective, because the borrower has a legal obligation to make payments to\nthe bank over time. However, in practical terms, how can we measure the value of the mortgage loan that the\nborrower is paying over 30 years in the present? One way of measuring the value of something\u2014whether a loan\nor anything else\u2014is by estimating what another party in the market is willing to pay for it. Many banks issue\nhome loans, and charge various handling and processing fees for doing so, but then sell the loans to other\nbanks or financial institutions who collect the loan payments. We call the market where financial institutions\nmake loans to borrowers the primaryloan market, while the market in which financial institutions buy and sell\nthese loans is the secondary loan market.\nOne key factor that affects what financial institutions are willing to pay for a loan, when they buy it in the\nsecondary loan market, is the perceived riskiness of the loan: that is, given the borrower's characteristics, such\nas income level and whether the local economy is performing strongly, what proportion of loans of this type\nwill the borrower repay? The greater the risk that a borrower will not repay loan, the less that any financial\ninstitution will pay to acquire the loan. Another key factor is to compare the interest rate the financial\ninstitution charged on the original loan with the current interest rate in the economy. If the original loan\nrequires the borrower to pay a low interest rate, but current interest rates are relatively high, then a financial\ninstitution will pay less to acquire the loan. In contrast, if the original loan requires the borrower to pay a high\ninterest rate, while current interest rates are relatively low, then a financial institution will pay more to acquire\nthe loan. For the Safe and Secure Bank in this example, the total value of its loans if they sold them to other\nfinancial institutions in the secondary market is $5 million.\nThe second category of bank asset isbonds, which are a common mechanism for borrowing, used by the\nfederal and local government, and also private companies, and nonprofit organizations. A bank takes some of\nthe money it has received in deposits and uses the money to buy bonds\u2014typically bonds issued that the U.S.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 27.3 \u2022 The Role of Banks 657\ngovernment issues. Government bonds are low-risk because the government is virtually certain to pay off the\nbond, albeit at a low rate of interest. These bonds are an asset for banks in the same way that loans are an\nasset: The bank will receive a stream of payments in the future. In our example, the Safe and Secure Bank\nholds bonds worth a total value of $4 million.\nThe final entry under assets isreserves, which is money that the bank keeps on hand, and that it does not lend\nor invest in bonds\u2014and thus does not lead to interest payments. The Federal Reserve requires that banks keep\na certain percentage of depositors\u2019 money on \u201creserve,\u201d which means either in their vaults or at the Federal\nReserve Bank. We call this a reserve requirement. (Monetary Policy and Bank Regulationwill explain how the\nlevel of these required reserves are one policy tool that governments have to influence bank behavior.)\nAdditionally, banks may also want to keep a certain amount of reserves on hand in excess of what is required.\nThe Safe and Secure Bank is holding $2 million in reserves.\nWe define net worth of a bank as its total assets minus its total liabilities. For the Safe and Secure Bank in\nFigure 27.5, net worth is equal to $1 million; that is, $11 million in assets minus $10 million in liabilities. For a\nfinancially healthy bank, the net worth will be positive. If a bank has negative net worth and depositors tried to\nwithdraw their money, the bank would not be able to give all depositors their money.\nLINK IT UP\nFor some concrete examples of what banks do, watch thisvideo(http://openstax.org/l/makingsense)from Paul\nSolman\u2019s \u201cMaking Sense of Financial News.\u201d\nHow Banks Go Bankrupt\nA bank that is bankrupt will have a negative net worth, meaning its assets will be worth less than its liabilities.\nHow can this happen? Again, looking at the balance sheet helps to explain.\nA well-run bank will assume that a small percentage of borrowers will not repay their loans on time, or at all,\nand factor these missing payments into its planning. Remember, the calculations of the banks' expenses every\nyear include a factor for loans that borrowers do not repay, and the value of a bank\u2019s loans on its balance sheet\nassumes a certain level of riskiness because some customers will not repay loans. Even if a bank expects a\ncertain number of loan defaults, it will suffer if the number of loan defaults is much greater than expected, as\ncan happen during a recession. For example, if the Safe and Secure Bank inFigure 27.5experienced a wave of\nunexpected defaults, so that its loans declined in value from $5 million to $3 million, then the assets of the Safe\nand Secure Bank would decline so that the bank had negative net worth.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat led to the 2008\u20132009 financial crisis?\nMany banks make mortgage loans so that people can buy a home, but then do not keep the loans on their books as\nan asset. Instead, the bank sells the loan. These loans are \u201csecuritized,\u201d which means that they are bundled\ntogether into a financial security that a financial institution sells to investors. Investors in these mortgage-backed\nsecurities receive a rate of return based on the level of payments that people make on all the mortgages that stand\nbehind the security.\nSecuritizationoffers certain advantages. If a bank makes most of its loans in a local area, then the bank may be\nfinancially vulnerable if the local economy declines, so that many people are unable to make their payments.\nHowever, if a bank sells its local loans, and then buys a mortgage-backed security based on home loans in many\nparts of the country, it can avoid exposure to local financial risks. (In the simple example in the text, banks just own\n\u201cbonds.\u201d In reality, banks can own a number of financial instruments, as long as these financial investments are safe\nenough to satisfy the government bank regulators.) From the standpoint of a local homebuyer, securitization offers 658 27 \u2022 Money and Banking\nthe benefit that a local bank does not need to have significant extra funds to make a loan, because the bank is only\nplanning to hold that loan for a short time, before selling the loan so that it can pool it into a financial security.\nHowever, securitization also offers one potentially large disadvantage. If a bank plans to hold a mortgage loan as an\nasset, the bank has an incentive to scrutinize the borrower carefully to ensure that the customer is likely to repay\nthe loan. However, a bank that plans to sell the loan may be less careful in making the loan in the first place. The\nbank will be more willing to make what we call \u201csubprime loans,\u201d which are loans that have characteristics like low\nor zero down-payment, little scrutiny of whether the borrower has a reliable income, and sometimes low payments\nfor the first year or two that will be followed by much higher payments. Economists dubbed some of thesubprime\nloansmade by financial institutions in the mid-2000s NINJA loans: loans that financial institutions made even\nthough the borrower had demonstrated No Income, No Job, or Assets.\nFinancial institutions typically sold these subprime loans and turned them into financial securities\u2014but with a twist.\nThe idea was that if losses occurred on these mortgage-backed securities, certain investors would agree to take the\nfirst, say, 5% of such losses. Other investors would agree to take, say, the next 5% of losses. By this approach, still\nother investors would not need to take any losses unless these mortgage-backed financial securities lost 25% or\n30% or more of their total value. These complex securities, along with other economic factors, encouraged a large\nexpansion of subprime loans in the mid-2000s.\nThe economic stage was now set for a banking crisis. Banks thought they were buying only ultra-safe securities,\nbecause even though the securities were ultimately backed by risky subprime mortgages, the banks only invested in\nthe part of those securities where they were protected from small or moderate levels of losses. However, as housing\nprices fell after 2007, and the deepening recession made it harder for many people to make their mortgage\npayments, many banks found that their mortgage-backed financial assets could be worth much less than they had\nexpected\u2014and so the banks were faced with staring bankruptcy. In the 2008\u20132011 period, 318 banks failed in the\nUnited States.\nThe risk of an unexpectedly high level of loan defaults can be especially difficult for banks because a bank\u2019s\nliabilities, namely it customers' deposits. Customers can withdraw funds quickly but many of the bank\u2019s assets\nlike loans and bonds will only be repaid over years or even decades. Thisasset-liability time mismatch\u2014the\nability for customers to withdraw bank\u2019s liabilities in the short term while customers repay its assets in the\nlong term\u2014can cause severe problems for a bank. For example, imagine a bank that has loaned a substantial\namount of money at a certain interest rate, but then sees interest rates rise substantially. The bank can find\nitself in a precarious situation. If it does not raise the interest rate it pays to depositors, then deposits will flow\nto other institutions that offer the higher interest rates that are now prevailing. However, if the bank raises the\ninterest rates that it pays to depositors, it may end up in a situation where it is paying a higher interest rate to\ndepositors than it is collecting from those past loans that it at lower interest rates. Clearly, the bank cannot\nsurvive in the long term if it is paying out more in interest to depositors than it is receiving from borrowers.\nHow can banks protect themselves against an unexpectedly high rate of loan defaults and against the risk of an\nasset-liability time mismatch? One strategy is for a bank todiversifyits loans, which means lending to a\nvariety of customers. For example, suppose a bank specialized in lending to a niche market\u2014say, making a\nhigh proportion of its loans to construction companies that build offices in one downtown area. If that one area\nsuffers an unexpected economic downturn, the bank will suffer large losses. However, if a bank loans both to\nconsumers who are buying homes and cars and also to a wide range of firms in many industries and\ngeographic areas, the bank is less exposed to risk. When a bank diversifies its loans, those categories of\nborrowers who have an unexpectedly large number of defaults will tend to be balanced out, according to\nrandom chance, by other borrowers who have an unexpectedly low number of defaults. Thus, diversification of\nloans can help banks to keep a positive net worth. However, if a widespread recession occurs that touches\nmany industries and geographic areas, diversification will not help.\nAlong with diversifying their loans, banks have several other strategies to reduce the risk of an unexpectedly\nAccess for free at openstax.org 27.4 \u2022 How Banks Create Money 659\nlarge number of loan defaults. For example, banks can sell some of the loans they make in the secondary loan\nmarket, as we described earlier, and instead hold a greater share of assets in the form of government bonds or\nreserves. Nevertheless, in a lengthy recession, most banks will see their net worth decline because customers\nwill not repay a higher share of loans in tough economic times.\n27.4How Banks Create Money\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Utilize the money multiplier formulate to determine how banks create money\n\u2022 Analyze and create T-account balance sheets\n\u2022 Evaluate the risks and benefits of money and banks\nBanks and money are intertwined. It is not just that most money is in the form of bank accounts. The banking\nsystem can literally create money through the process of making loans. Let\u2019s see how.\nMoney Creation by a Single Bank\nStart with a hypothetical bank called Singleton Bank. The bank has $10 million in deposits. The T-account\nbalance sheet for Singleton Bank, when it holds all of the deposits in its vaults, is inFigure 27.6. At this stage,\nSingleton Bank is simply storing money for depositors and is using these deposits to make loans. In this\nsimplified example, Singleton Bank cannot earn any interest income from these loans and cannot pay its\ndepositors an interest rate either.\nFIGURE27.6Singleton Bank\u2019s Balance Sheet: Receives $10 million in Deposits\nThe Federal Reserve requires Singleton Bank to keep $1 million on reserve (10% of total deposits). It will loan\nout the remaining $9 million. By loaning out the $9 million and charging interest, it will be able to make\ninterest payments to depositors and earn interest income for Singleton Bank (for now, we will keep it simple\nand not put interest income on the balance sheet). Instead of becoming just a storage place for deposits,\nSingleton Bank can become a financial intermediary between savers and borrowers.\nThis change in business plan alters Singleton Bank\u2019s balance sheet, asFigure 27.7shows. Singleton\u2019s assets\nhave changed. It now has $1 million in reserves and a loan to Hank\u2019s Auto Supply of $9 million. The bank still\nhas $10 million in deposits.\nFIGURE27.7Singleton Bank\u2019s Balance Sheet: 10% Reserves, One Round of Loans\nSingleton Bank lends $9 million to Hank\u2019s Auto Supply. The bank records this loan by making an entry on the\nbalance sheet to indicate that it has made a loan. This loan is an asset, because it will generate interest income\nfor the bank. Of course, the loan officer will not allow let Hank to walk out of the bank with $9 million in cash.\nThe bank issues Hank\u2019s Auto Supply a cashier\u2019s check for the $9 million. Hank deposits the loan in his regular\nchecking account with First National. The deposits at First National rise by $9 million and its reserves also rise\nby $9 million, asFigure 27.8shows. First National must hold 10% of additional deposits as required reserves\nbut is free to loan out the rest 660 27 \u2022 Money and Banking\nFIGURE27.8First National Balance Sheet\nMaking loans that are deposited into a demand deposit account increases the M1 money supply. Remember\nthe definition of M1 includes checkable (demand) deposits, which one can easily use as a medium of exchange\nto buy goods and services. Notice that the money supply is now $19 million: $10 million in deposits in\nSingleton bank and $9 million in deposits at First National. Obviously as Hank\u2019s Auto Supply writes checks to\npay its bills the deposits will draw down. However, the bigger picture is that a bank must hold enough money in\nreserves to meet its liabilities. The rest the bank loans out. In this example so far, bank lending has expanded\nthe money supply by $9 million.\nNow, First National must hold only 10% as required reserves ($900,000) but can lend out the other 90% ($8.1\nmillion) in a loan to Jack\u2019s Chevy Dealership asFigure 27.9shows.\nFIGURE27.9First National Balance Sheet\nIf Jack\u2019s deposits the loan in its checking account at Second National, the money supply just increased by an\nadditional $8.1 million, asFigure 27.10shows.\nFIGURE27.10Second National Bank\u2019s Balance Sheet\nHow is this money creation possible? It is possible because there are multiple banks in the financial system,\nthey are required to hold only a fraction of their deposits, and loans end up deposited in other banks, which\nincreases deposits and, in essence, the money supply.\nLINK IT UP\nWatch thisvideo(http://openstax.org/l/createmoney)to learn more about how banks create money.\nThe Money Multiplier and a Multi-Bank System\nIn a system with multiple banks, Singleton Bank deposited the initial excess reserve amount that it decided to\nlend to Hank\u2019s Auto Supply into First National Bank, which is free to loan out $8.1 million. If all banks loan out\ntheir excess reserves, the money supply will expand. In a multi-bank system, institutions determine the\namount of money that the system can create by using the money multiplier. This tells us by how many times a\nloan will be \u201cmultiplied\u201d as it is spent in the economy and then re-deposited in other banks.\nFortunately, a formula exists for calculating the total of these many rounds of lending in a banking system. The\nmoney multiplier formulais:\nWe then multiply the money multiplier by the change in excess reserves to determine the total amount of M1\nmoney supply created in the banking system. See the Work it Out feature to walk through the multiplier\ncalculation.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 27.4 \u2022 How Banks Create Money 661\nWORK IT OUT\nUsing the Money Multiplier Formula\nUsing the money multiplier for the example in this text:\nStep 1. In the case of Singleton Bank, for whom the reserve requirement is 10% (or 0.10), the money multiplier is\n1 divided by .10, which is equal to 10.\nStep 2. We have identified that the excess reserves are $9 million, so, using the formula we can determine the\ntotal change in the M1 money supply:\nStep 3. Thus, we can say that, in this example, the total quantity of money generated in this economy after all\nrounds of lending are completed will be $90 million.\nCautions about the Money Multiplier\nThe money multiplier will depend on the proportion of reserves that the Federal Reserve Band requires banks\nto hold. Additionally, a bank can also choose to hold extra reserves. Banks may decide to vary how much they\nhold in reserves for two reasons: macroeconomic conditions and government rules. When an economy is in\nrecession, banks are likely to hold a higher proportion of reserves because they fear that customers are less\nlikely to repay loans when the economy is slow. The Federal Reserve may also raise or lower the required\nreserves held by banks as a policy move to affect the quantity of money in an economy, asMonetary Policy and\nBank Regulationwill discuss.\nThe process of how banks create money shows how the quantity of money in an economy is closely linked to\nthe quantity of lending or credit in the economy. All the money in the economy, except for the original reserves,\nis a result of bank loans that institutions repeatedly re-deposit and loan.\nFinally, the money multiplier depends on people re-depositing the money that they receive in the banking\nsystem. If people instead store their cash in safe-deposit boxes or in shoeboxes hidden in their closets, then\nbanks cannot recirculate the money in the form of loans. Central banks have an incentive to assure that bank\ndeposits are safe because if people worry that they may lose their bank deposits, they may start holding more\nmoney in cash, instead of depositing it in banks, and the quantity of loans in an economy will decline. Low-\nincome countries have what economists sometimes refer to as \u201cmattress savings,\u201d or money that people are\nhiding in their homes because they do not trust banks. When mattress savings in an economy are substantial,\nbanks cannot lend out those funds and the money multiplier cannot operate as effectively. The overall quantity\nof money and loans in such an economy will decline.\nLINK IT UP\nWatch avideo(http://openstax.org/l/moneymyth)of Jem Bendell discussing \u201cThe Money Myth.\u201d\nMoney and Banks\u2014Benefits and Dangers\nMoney and banks are marvelous social inventions that help a modern economy to function. Compared with the\nalternative of barter, money makes market exchanges vastly easier in goods, labor, and financial markets.\nBanking makes money still more effective in facilitating exchanges in goods and labor markets. Moreover, the 662 27 \u2022 Money and Banking\nprocess of banks making loans in financial capital markets is intimately tied to the creation of money.\nHowever, the extraordinary economic gains that are possible through money and banking also suggest some\npossible corresponding dangers. If banks are not working well, it sets off a decline in convenience and safety of\ntransactions throughout the economy. If the banks are under financial stress, because of a widespread decline\nin the value of their assets, loans may become far less available, which can deal a crushing blow to sectors of\nthe economy that depend on borrowed money like business investment, home construction, and car\nmanufacturing. The 2008\u20132009 Great Recession illustrated this pattern.\nBRING IT HOME\nThe Many Disguises of Money: From Cowries to Crypto\nThe global economy has come a long way since it started using cowrie shells as currency. We have moved away from\ncommodity and commodity-backed paper money to fiat currency. As technology and global integration increases,\nthe need for paper currency is diminishing, too. Every day, we witness the increased use of debit and credit cards.\nThe latest creation and a new form of money is cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is digital currency that is not\ncontrolled by any single entity, such as a company or country. In this sense, it is not a fiat currency because it is not\nissued by a central bank and is not necessarily supported by governments as legal tender. Instead, transactions and\nownership are maintained in a decentralized manner, and the value (vis-\u00e0-vis, say, the U.S. dollar) is determined\nprimarily by market forces\u2014i.e., supply and demand. Governments can affect the value of a cryptocurrency by\nregulating its use within their country's boundaries, but in the end, the price of a cryptocurrency comes down to\nsupply and demand. Cryptocurrencies have come a long way since 2009 when Bitcoin was first invented, and the\nrecent two to three years has seen an explosion of different cryptocurrencies being used across the globe.\nIt is important to note that in order to be considered as money, cryptocurrency still needs to satisfy the three\nrequirements: it needs to be valid as a store of value, it needs to be valid as a unit of account, and it must be able to\nbe used as a medium of exchange. While the first two of these requirements can be satisfied easily by expressing\nthe currency in terms of another, such as the U.S. dollar, and through its secure ownership rules, its use as a medium\nof exchange\u2014to be used to buy and sell goods and services\u2014is more complicated. While cryptocurrencies are used\nin many illicit transactions, it is less common to see them accepted as forms of payment for regular things like\ngroceries or your rent.\nBitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency, and thus the one most likely to be considered real money since it can be\nused to purchase the most goods and services. Other popular cryptocurrencies as of early 2022 (in terms of trade\nvolume) are Ethereum and Binance Coin. Many other cryptocurrencies exist, but their more widespread adoption as\na medium of exchange is yet to be seen.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 27 \u2022 Key Terms 663\nKey Terms\nasset item of value that a firm or an individual owns\nasset\u2013liability time mismatch customers can withdraw a bank\u2019s liabilities in the short term while customers\nrepay its assets in the long term\nbalance sheet an accounting tool that lists assets and liabilities\nbank capital a bank\u2019s net worth\nbarterliterally, trading one good or service for another, without using money\ncoins and currency in circulationthe coins and bills that circulate in an economy that are not held by the U.S\nTreasury, at the Federal Reserve Bank, or in bank vaults\ncommodity money an item that is used as money, but which also has value from its use as something other\nthan money\ncommodity-backed currencies dollar bills or other currencies with values backed up by gold or another\ncommodity\ncredit cardimmediately transfers money from the credit card company\u2019s checking account to the seller, and at\nthe end of the month the user owes the money to the credit card company; a credit card is a short-term\nloan\ndebit cardlike a check, is an instruction to the user\u2019s bank to transfer money directly and immediately from\nyour bank account to the seller\ndemand deposit checkable deposit in banks that is available by making a cash withdrawal or writing a check\ndepository institution institution that accepts money deposits and then uses these to make loans\ndiversify making loans or investments with a variety of firms, to reduce the risk of being adversely affected by\nevents at one or a few firms\ndouble coincidence of wants a situation in which two people each want some good or service that the other\nperson can provide\nfiat money has no intrinsic value, but is declared by a government to be the country's legal tender\nfinancial intermediary an institution that operates between a saver with financial assets to invest and an\nentity who will borrow those assets and pay a rate of return\nliability any amount or debt that a firm or an individual owes\nM1 money supplya narrow definition of the money supply that includes currency and checking accounts in\nbanks, and to a lesser degree, traveler\u2019s checks.\nM2 money supplya definition of the money supply that includes everything in M1, but also adds savings\ndeposits, money market funds, and certificates of deposit\nmedium of exchange whatever is widely accepted as a method of payment\nmoney whatever serves society in four functions: as a medium of exchange, a store of value, a unit of account,\nand a standard of deferred payment.\nmoney market fundthe deposits of many investors are pooled together and invested in a safe way like short-\nterm government bonds\nmoney multiplier formula total money in the economy divided by the original quantity of money, or change in\nthe total money in the economy divided by a change in the original quantity of money\nnet worth the excess of the asset value over and above the amount of the liability; total assets minus total\nliabilities\npayment system helps an economy exchange goods and services for money or other financial assets\nreservesfunds that a bank keeps on hand and that it does not loan out or invest in bonds\nsavings depositbank account where you cannot withdraw money by writing a check, but can withdraw the\nmoney at a bank\u2014or can transfer it easily to a checking account\nsmart cardstores a certain value of money on a card and then one can use the card to make purchases\nstandard of deferred payment money must also be acceptable to make purchases today that will be paid in\nthe future\nstore of value something that serves as a way of preserving economic value that one can spend or consume in 664 27 \u2022 Key Concepts and Summary\nthe future\nT-account a balance sheet with a two-column format, with the T-shape formed by the vertical line down the\nmiddle and the horizontal line under the column headings for \u201cAssets\u201d and \u201cLiabilities\u201d\ntime depositaccount that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain period of time, in\nexchange for a higher rate of interest; also called certificate of deposit\ntransaction costs the costs associated with finding a lender or a borrower for money\nunit of account the common way in which we measure market values in an economy\nKey Concepts and Summary\n27.1Defining Money by Its Functions\nMoney is what people in a society regularly use when purchasing or selling goods and services. If money were\nnot available, people would need to barter with each other, meaning that each person would need to identify\nothers with whom they have a double coincidence of wants\u2014that is, each party has a specific good or service\nthat the other desires. Money serves several functions: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of\nvalue, and a standard of deferred payment. There are two types of money: commodity money, which is an item\nused as money, but which also has value from its use as something other than money; and fiat money, which\nhas no intrinsic value, but is declared by a government to be the country's legal tender.\n27.2Measuring Money: Currency, M1, and M2\nWe measure money with several definitions: M1 includes currency and money in checking accounts (demand\ndeposits). Traveler\u2019s checks are also a component of M1, but are declining in use. M2 includes all of M1, plus\nsavings deposits, time deposits like certificates of deposit, and money market funds.\n27.3The Role of Banks\nBanks facilitate using money for transactions in the economy because people and firms can use bank accounts\nwhen selling or buying goods and services, when paying a worker or receiving payment, and when saving\nmoney or receiving a loan. In the financial capital market, banks are financial intermediaries; that is, they\noperate between savers who supply financial capital and borrowers who demand loans. A balance sheet\n(sometimes called a T-account) is an accounting tool which lists assets in one column and liabilities in another.\nThe bank's liabilities are its deposits. The bank's assets include its loans, its ownership of bonds, and its\nreserves (which it does not loan out). We calculate a bank's net worth by subtracting its liabilities from its\nassets. Banks run a risk of negative net worth if the value of their assets declines. The value of assets can\ndecline because of an unexpectedly high number of defaults on loans, or if interest rates rise and the bank\nsuffers an asset-liability time mismatch in which the bank is receiving a low interest rate on its long-term\nloans but must pay the currently higher market interest rate to attract depositors. Banks can protect\nthemselves against these risks by choosing to diversify their loans or to hold a greater proportion of their\nassets in bonds and reserves. If banks hold only a fraction of their deposits as reserves, then the process of\nbanks\u2019 lending money, re-depositing those loans in banks, and the banks making additional loans will create\nmoney in the economy.\n27.4How Banks Create Money\nWe define the money multiplier as the quantity of money that the banking system can generate from each $1 of\nbank reserves. The formula for calculating the multiplier is 1/reserve ratio, where the reserve ratio is the\nfraction of deposits that the bank wishes to hold as reserves. The quantity of money in an economy and the\nquantity of credit for loans are inextricably intertwined. The network of banks making loans, people making\ndeposits, and banks making more loans creates much of the money in an economy.\nGiven the macroeconomic dangers of a malfunctioning banking system,Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation\nwill discuss government policies for controlling the money supply and for keeping the banking system safe.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 27 \u2022 Self-Check Questions 665\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

Monetary policy works when the central bank reduces\ninterest rates and makes credit more available. As a result, business investment and other types of spending\nincrease, causing GDP and employment to grow.\nHowever, what if the interest rates banks pay are close to zero already? They cannot be made negative, can they?\nThat would mean that lenders pay borrowers for the privilege of taking their money. Yet, this was the situation the 668 28 \u2022 Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation\nU.S. Federal Reserve found itself in both at the end of the 2008\u20132009 recession and during the COVID-19 recession\nof 2020. The federal funds rate, which is the interest rate for banks that the Federal Reserve targets with its\nmonetary policy, was slightly above 5% in 2007. By 2009, it had fallen to 0.16%. It then fell again from over 2% to\n0.05% in March 2020.\nDuring the Great Recession, the Federal Reserve\u2019s situation was further complicated because fiscal policy, the other\nmajor tool for managing the economy, was constrained by fears that the federal budget deficit and the public debt\nwere already too high. What were the Federal Reserve\u2019s options? How could the Federal Reserve use monetary\npolicy to stimulate the economy? And while fiscal policy was more aggressive in 2020, the economic situation has in\nsome cases been more severe and additional financial support was necessary. The solution to the problem of the\nlower bound in both recessions, as we will see in this chapter, was to change the rules of the game.\nMoney, loans, and banks are all interconnected. Money is deposited in bank accounts, which is then loaned to\nbusinesses, individuals, and other banks. When the interlocking system of money, loans, and banks works\nwell, economic transactions smoothly occur in goods and labor markets and savers are connected with\nborrowers. If the money and banking system does not operate smoothly, the economy can either fall into\nrecession or suffer prolonged inflation.\nThe government of every country has public policies that support the system of money, loans, and banking.\nHowever, these policies do not always work perfectly. This chapter discusses how monetary policy works and\nwhat may prevent it from working perfectly.\n28.1The Federal Reserve Banking System and Central Banks\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain the structure and organization of the U.S. Federal Reserve\n\u2022 Discuss how central banks impact monetary policy, promote financial stability, and provide banking\nservices\nIn making decisions about the money supply, a central bank decides whether to raise or lowerinterest rates\nand, in this way, to influence macroeconomic policy, whose goal is lowunemploymentand lowinflation. The\ncentral bank is also responsible for regulating all or part of the nation\u2019s banking system to protect bank\ndepositors and insure the health of the bank\u2019s balance sheet.\nWe call the organization responsible for conductingmonetary policyand ensuring that a nation\u2019s financial\nsystem operates smoothly thecentral bank. Most nations have central banks or currency boards. Some\nprominent central banks around the world include the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the\nBank of England. In the United States, we call the central bank the Federal Reserve\u2014often abbreviated as just\n\u201cthe Fed.\u201d This section explains the U.S.Federal Reserve's organization and identifies the major central bank's\nresponsibilities.\nStructure/Organization of the Federal Reserve\nUnlike most central banks, the Federal Reserve is semi-decentralized, mixing government appointees with\nrepresentation from private-sector banks. At the national level, it is run by a Board of Governors, consisting of\nseven members appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. Appointments\nare for 14-year terms and they are arranged so that one term expires January 31 of every even-numbered year.\nThe purpose of the long and staggered terms is to insulate the Board of Governors as much as possible from\npolitical pressure so that governors can make policy decisions based only on their economic merits.\nAdditionally, except when filling an unfinished term, each member only serves one term, further insulating\ndecision-making from politics. The Fed's policy decisions do not require congressional approval, and the\nPresident cannot ask for a Federal Reserve Governor to resign as the President can with cabinet positions.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.1 \u2022 The Federal Reserve Banking System and Central Banks 669\nOne member of the Board of Governors is designated as the Chair. For example, from 1987 until early 2006,\nthe Chair was Alan Greenspan. From 2006 until 2014, Ben Bernanke held the post. From 2014 to 2018, Janet\nYellen was the Chair. The current Chair is Jerome Powell. See the following Clear It Up feature to find out more\nabout the former and current Chair.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWho has the most immediate economic power in the world?\nFIGURE28.2Chair of the Federal Reserve BoardJerome H. Powell (Credit: \u201c_NZ79221\u201d by Board of Governors of\nthe Federal Reserve System/Flickr, Public Domain)\nWhat individual can make a financial market crash or soar just by making a public statement? It is not Bill Gates or\nWarren Buffett. It is not even the President of the United States. The answer is the Chair of the Federal Reserve\nBoard of Governors. In 2018, President Donald Trump appointed Jerome H. Powell to a 4-year term as chair of the\nFederal Reserve, replacing Janet Yellen, who served as the first female chair of the Federal Reserve from\n2014\u20132018 and who now serves as the Treasury Secretary in the Biden administration. In November 2021, Powell\nwas nominated for a second term by President Biden; this appointment was confirmed in early-2022.\nPowell played a pivotal role during the COVID-19 recession and its aftermath; in March 2020, under his leadership\nthe Fed acted quickly to reduce the effective federal funds rate and expand its lending and bond-buying actions,\nsimilar to what Ben Bernanke did during the Great Recession. A centrist at heart, Powell has been criticized for\nfueling asset prices, even though in his many speeches and testimony before Congress he has consistently\nemphasized low unemployment rates and has been more tolerant of inflation than others on the Federal Reserve\nBoard. Powell is not an academic economist by training or career\u2014he has a J.D. from Georgetown Law and worked\nfor many years at investment banks and on corporate boards\u2014but this lack of \"ivory tower\" influences has helped\nguide a practical approach to economic problems, for which he is best known.\nThe Fed Chair is first among equals on the Board of Governors. While they have only one vote, the Chair\ncontrols the agenda, and is the Fed's public voice, so they have more power and influence than one might\nexpect.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/Governors)to see who the current members of the Federal Reserve\nBoard of Governors are. You can follow the links provided for each board member to learn more about their\nbackgrounds, experiences, and when their terms on the board will end.\nThe Federal Reserve is more than the Board of Governors. The Fed also includes 12 regional Federal Reserve 670 28 \u2022 Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation\nbanks, each of which is responsible for supporting the commercial banks and economy generally in its district.\nFigure 28.3shows the Federal Reserve districts and the cities where their regional headquarters are located.\nThe commercial banks in each district elect a Board of Directors for each regional Federal Reserve bank, and\nthat board chooses a president for each regional Federal Reserve district. Thus, the Federal Reserve System\nincludes both federally and private-sector appointed leaders.\nFIGURE28.3The Twelve Federal Reserve DistrictsThere are twelve regional Federal Reserve banks, each with its\ndistrict.\nWhat Does a Central Bank Do?\nThe Federal Reserve, like most central banks, is designed to perform three important functions:\n1. To conduct monetary policy\n2. To promote stability of the financial system\n3. To provide banking services to commercial banks and other depository institutions, and to provide\nbanking services to the federal government.\nThe first two functions are sufficiently important that we will discuss them in their own modules. The third\nfunction we will discuss here.\nThe Federal Reserve provides many of the same services to banks as banks provide to their customers. For\nexample, all commercial banks have an account at the Fed where they deposit reserves. Similarly, banks can\nobtain loans from the Fed through the \u201cdiscount window\u201d facility, which we will discuss in more detail later.\nThe Fed is also responsible for check processing. When you write a check, for example, to buy groceries, the\ngrocery store deposits the check in its bank account. Then, the grocery store's bank returns the physical check\n(or an image of that actual check) to your bank, after which it transfers funds from your bank account to the\ngrocery store's account. The Fed is responsible for each of these actions.\nOn a more mundane level, the Federal Reserve ensures that enough currency and coins are circulating\nthrough the financial system to meet public demands. For example, each year the Fed increases the amount of\ncurrency available in banks around the Christmas shopping season and reduces it again in January.\nFinally, the Fed is responsible for assuring that banks are in compliance with a wide variety of consumer\nprotection laws. For example, banks are forbidden from discriminating on the basis of age, race, sex, or marital\nstatus. Banks are also required to disclose publicly information about the loans they make for buying houses\nand how they distribute the loans geographically, as well as by sex and race of the loan applicants.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.2 \u2022 Bank Regulation 671\n28.2Bank Regulation\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Discuss the relationship between bank regulation and monetary policy\n\u2022 Explain bank supervision\n\u2022 Explain how deposit insurance and lender of last resort are two strategies to protect against bank runs\nA safe and stable national financial system is a critical concern of theFederal Reserve. The goal is not only to\nprotect individuals\u2019 savings, but to protect the integrity of the financial system itself. This esoteric task is\nusually behind the scenes, but came into view during the 2008\u20132009 financial crisis, when for a brief period of\ntime, critical parts of the financial system failed and firms became unable to obtain financing for ordinary\nparts of their business. Imagine if suddenly you were unable to access the money in your bank accounts\nbecause your checks were not accepted for payment and your debit cards were declined. This gives an idea of a\nfailure of the payments/financial system.\nBank regulationis intended to maintain banks' solvency by avoiding excessive risk. Regulation falls into a\nnumber of categories, including reserve requirements, capital requirements, and restrictions on the types of\ninvestments banks may make. InMoney and Banking, we learned that banks are required to hold a minimum\npercentage of their deposits on hand asreserves. \u201cOn hand\u201d is a bit of a misnomer because, while a portion of\nbank reserves are held as cash in the bank, the majority are held in the bank\u2019s account at the Federal Reserve,\nand their purpose is to cover desired withdrawals by depositors. Another part of bank regulation is restrictions\non the types of investments banks are allowed to make. Banks are permitted to make loans to businesses,\nindividuals, and other banks. They can purchase U.S. Treasury securities but, to protect depositors, they are\nnot permitted to invest in the stock market or other assets that are perceived as too risky.\nBank capitalis the difference between a bank\u2019s assets and its liabilities. In other words, it is a bank\u2019snet worth.\nA bank must have positive net worth; otherwise it is insolvent or bankrupt, meaning it would not have enough\nassets to pay back its liabilities. Regulation requires that banks maintain a minimum net worth, usually\nexpressed as a percent of their assets, to protect their depositors and other creditors.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/bankregulation)to read the brief article, \u201cStop Confusing Monetary\nPolicy and Bank Regulation.\u201d\nBank Supervision\nSeveral government agencies monitor banks' balance sheets to make sure they have positive net worth and are\nnot taking too high a level of risk. Within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Office of the Comptroller of\nthe Currency has a national staff of bank examiners who conduct on-site reviews of the 1,500 or so of the\nlargest national banks. The bank examiners also review any foreign banks that have branches in the United\nStates. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency also monitors and regulates about 800 savings and loan\ninstitutions.\nTheNational Credit Union Administration (NCUA)supervises credit unions, which are nonprofit banks that\ntheir members run and own. There are about 5,000 credit unions in the U.S. economy today, although the\ntypical credit union is small compared to most banks.\nThe Federal Reserve also has some responsibility for supervising financial institutions. For example, we call\nconglomerate firms that own banks and other businesses \u201cbank holding companies.\u201d While other regulators\nlike the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency supervises the banks, the Federal Reserve supervises the\nholding companies. 672 28 \u2022 Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation\nWhen bank supervision (and bank-like institutions such as savings and loans and credit unions) works well,\nmost banks will remain financially healthy most of the time. If the bank supervisors find that a bank has low or\nnegative net worth, or is making too high a proportion of risky loans, they can require that the bank change its\nbehavior\u2014or, in extreme cases, even force the bank to close or be sold to a financially healthy bank.\nBank supervision can run into both practical and political questions. The practical question is that measuring\nthe value of a bank\u2019s assets is not always straightforward. As we discussed inMoney and Banking, a bank\u2019s\nassetsare its loans, and the value of these assets depends on estimates about the risk that customers will not\nrepay these loans. These issues can become even more complex when a bank makes loans to banks or firms in\nother countries, or arranges financial deals that are much more complex than a basic loan.\nThe political question arises because a bank supervisor's decision to require a bank to close or to change its\nfinancial investments is often controversial, and the bank supervisor often comes under political pressure\nfrom the bank's owners and the local politicians to keep quiet and back off.\nFor example, many observers have pointed out that Japan\u2019s banks were in deep financial trouble through most\nof the 1990s; however, nothing substantial had been done about it by the early 2000s. A similar unwillingness\nto confront problems with struggling banks is visible across the rest of the world, in East Asia, Latin America,\nEastern Europe, Russia, and elsewhere.\nIn the United States, the government passed laws in the 1990s requiring that bank supervisors make their\nfindings open and public, and that they act as soon as they identify a problem. However, as many U.S. banks\nwere staggered by the 2008-2009 recession, critics of the bank regulators asked pointed questions about why\nthe regulators had not foreseen the banks' financial shakiness earlier, before such large losses had a chance to\naccumulate.\nBank Runs\nBack in the nineteenth century and during the first few decades of the twentieth century (around and during\nthe Great Depression), putting your money in a bank could be nerve-wracking. Imagine that the net worth of\nyour bank became negative, so that the bank\u2019s assets were not enough to cover its liabilities. In this situation,\nwhoever withdrew their deposits first received all of their money, and those who did not rush to the bank\nquickly enough, lost their money. We call depositors racing to the bank to withdraw their deposits, asFigure\n28.4shows abank run. In the movieIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life, the bank manager, played by Jimmy Stewart, faces a\nmob of worried bank depositors who want to withdraw their money, but manages to allay their fears by\nallowing some of them to withdraw a portion of their deposits\u2014using the money from his own pocket that was\nsupposed to pay for his honeymoon.\nFIGURE28.4A Run on the BankBank runs during the Great Depression only served to worsen the economic\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.3 \u2022 How a Central Bank Executes Monetary Policy 673\nsituation. (Credit: \u201cDepression: \"Runs on Banks\u201d by National Archives and Records Administration, Public Domain)\nThe risk of bank runs created instability in the banking system. Even a rumor that a bank might experience\nnegative net worth could trigger a bank run and, in a bank run, even healthy banks could be destroyed.\nBecause a bank loans out most of the money it receives, and because it keeps only limited reserves on hand, a\nbank run of any size would quickly drain any of the bank\u2019s available cash. When the bank had no cash\nremaining, it only intensified the fears of remaining depositors that they could lose their money. Moreover, a\nbank run at one bank often triggered a chain reaction of runs on other banks. In the late nineteenth and early\ntwentieth century, bank runs were typically not the original cause of a recession\u2014but they could make a\nrecession much worse.\nDeposit Insurance\nTo protect against bank runs, Congress has put two strategies into place:deposit insuranceand the lender of\nlast resort. Deposit insurance is an insurance system that makes sure depositors in a bank do not lose their\nmoney, even if the bank goes bankrupt. About 70 countries around the world, including all of the major\neconomies, have deposit insurance programs. In the United States, theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(FDIC)is responsible for deposit insurance. Banks pay an insurance premium to the FDIC. The insurance\npremium is based on the bank\u2019s level of deposits, and then adjusted according to the riskiness of a bank\u2019s\nfinancial situation. In 2009, for example, a fairly safe bank with a high net worth might have paid 10\u201320 cents\nin insurance premiums for every $100 in bank deposits, while a risky bank with very low net worth might have\npaid 50\u201360 cents for every $100 in bank deposits.\nBank examiners from the FDIC evaluate the banks' balance sheets, looking at the asset and liability values to\ndetermine the risk level. The FDIC provides deposit insurance for about 4,914 banks (as of the third quarter of\n2021). Even if a bank fails, the government guarantees that depositors will receive up to $250,000 of their\nmoney in each account, which is enough for almost all individuals, although not sufficient for many\nbusinesses. Since the United States enacted deposit insurance in the 1930s, no one has lost any of their\ninsured deposits. Bank runs no longer happen at insured banks.\nLender of Last Resort\nThe problem with bank runs is not that insolvent banks will fail; they are, after all, bankrupt and need to be\nshut down. The problem is that bank runs can cause solvent banks to fail and spread to the rest of the financial\nsystem. To prevent this, the Fed stands ready to lend to banks and other financial institutions when they\ncannot obtain funds from anywhere else. This is known as thelender of last resortrole. For banks, the central\nbank acting as a lender of last resort helps to reinforce the effect of deposit insurance and to reassure bank\ncustomers that they will not lose their money.\nThe lender of last resort task can arise in other financial crises, as well. During the 1987 stock market crash\npanic, when U.S. stock values fell by 25% in a single day, the Federal Reserve made a number of short-term\nemergency loans so that the financial system could keep functioning. During the 2008-2009 recession, we can\ninterpret the Fed's \u201cquantitative easing\u201d policies (discussed below) as a willingness to make short-term credit\navailable as needed in a time when the banking and financial system was under stress.\n28.3How a Central Bank Executes Monetary Policy\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain the reason for open market operations\n\u2022 Evaluate reserve requirements and discount rates\n\u2022 Interpret and show bank activity through balance sheets\nThe Federal Reserve's most important function is to conduct the nation\u2019smonetary policy. Article I, Section 8\nof the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power \u201cto coin money\u201d and \u201cto regulate the value thereof.\u201d As part of 674 28 \u2022 Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation\nthe 1913 legislation that created the Federal Reserve, Congress delegated these powers to the Fed. Monetary\npolicy involves managing interest rates and credit conditions, which influences the level of economic activity,\nas we describe in more detail below.\nA central bank has three traditional tools to implement monetary policy in the economy:\n\u2022 Open market operations\n\u2022 Changing reserve requirements\n\u2022 Changing the discount rate\nIn discussing how these three tools work, it is useful to think of the central bank as a \u201cbank for banks\u201d\u2014that is,\neach private-sector bank has its own account at the central bank. We will discuss each of these monetary\npolicy tools in the sections below.\nOpen Market Operations\nSince the early 1920s, the most common monetary policy tool in the U.S. has beenopen market operations.\nThese take place when the central bank sells or buys U.S. Treasury bonds in order to influence the quantity of\nbank reserves and the level of interest rates. The specific interest rate targeted in open market operations is\nthe federal funds rate. The name is a bit of a misnomer since the federal funds rate is the interest rate that\ncommercial banks charge making overnight loans to other banks. As such, it is a very short term interest rate,\nbut one that reflects credit conditions in financial markets very well.\nTheFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC)makes the decisions regarding these open market operations.\nThe FOMC comprises seven members of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Board of Governors. It also includes five voting\nmembers who the Board draws, on a rotating basis, from the regional Federal Reserve Banks. The New York\ndistrict president is a permanent FOMC voting member and the Board fills other four spots on a rotating,\nannual basis, from the other 11 districts. The FOMC typically meets every six weeks, but it can meet more\nfrequently if necessary. The FOMC tries to act by consensus; however, the Federal Reserve's chairman has\ntraditionally played a very powerful role in defining and shaping that consensus. For the Federal Reserve, and\nfor most central banks, open market operations have, over the last few decades, been the most commonly used\ntool of monetary policy.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/monetarypolicy)for the Federal Reserve to learn more about current\nmonetary policy.\nTo understand how open market operations affect the money supply, consider the balance sheet of Happy\nBank, displayed inFigure 28.5.Figure 28.5(a) shows that Happy Bank starts with $460 million in assets,\ndivided among reserves, bonds and loans, and $400 million in liabilities in the form of deposits, with a net\nworth of $60 million. When the central bank purchases $20 million in bonds from Happy Bank, the bond\nholdings of Happy Bank fall by $20 million and the bank\u2019s reserves rise by $20 million, asFigure 28.5(b)\nshows. However, Happy Bank only wants to hold $40 million in reserves (the quantity of reserves with which it\nstarted inFigure 28.5) (a), so the bank decides to loan out the extra $20 million in reserves and its loans rise by\n$20 million, asFigure 28.5(c) shows. The central bank's open market operation causes Happy Bank to make\nloans instead of holding its assets in the form of government bonds, which expands the money supply. As the\nnew loans are deposited in banks throughout the economy, these banks will, in turn, loan out some of the\ndeposits they receive, triggering the money multiplier that we discussed inMoney and Banking.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.3 \u2022 How a Central Bank Executes Monetary Policy 675\nFIGURE28.5\nWhere did the Federal Reserve get the $20 million that it used to purchase thebonds? A central bank has the\npower to create money. In practical terms, the Federal Reserve would write a check to Happy Bank, so that\nHappy Bank can have that money credited to its bank account at the Federal Reserve. In truth, the Federal\nReserve created the money to purchase the bonds out of thin air\u2014or with a few clicks on some computer keys.\nOpen market operations can also reduce the quantity of money and loans in an economy.Figure 28.6(a) shows\nthe balance sheet of Happy Bank before the central bank sells bonds in the open market. When Happy Bank\npurchases $30 million in bonds, Happy Bank sends $30 million of its reserves to the central bank, but now\nholds an additional $30 million in bonds, asFigure 28.6(b) shows. However, Happy Bank wants to hold $40\nmillion in reserves, as inFigure 28.6(a), so it will adjust down the quantity of its loans by $30 million, to bring\nits reserves back to the desired level, asFigure 28.6(c) shows. In practical terms, a bank can easily reduce its\nquantity of loans. At any given time, a bank is receiving payments on loans that it made previously and also\nmaking new loans. If the bank just slows down or briefly halts making new loans, and instead adds those funds\nto its reserves, then its overall quantity of loans will decrease. A decrease in the quantity of loans also means\nfewer deposits in other banks, and other banks reducing their lending as well, as the money multiplier that we\ndiscussed inMoney and Bankingtakes effect. What about all those bonds? How do they affect the money\nsupply? Read the following Clear It Up feature for the answer. 676 28 \u2022 Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation\nFIGURE28.6\nCLEAR IT UP\nDoes selling or buying bonds increase the money supply?\nIs it a sale of bonds by the central bank which increases bank reserves and lowers interest rates or is it a purchase\nof bonds by the central bank? The easy way to keep track of this is to treat the central bank as beingoutsidethe\nbanking system. When a central bank buys bonds, money is flowing from the central bank to individual banks in the\neconomy, increasing the money supply in circulation. When a central bank sells bonds, then money from individual\nbanks in the economy is flowing into the central bank\u2014reducing the quantity of money in the economy.\nThe Federal Reserve was founded in the aftermath of the 1907 Financial Panic when many banks failed as a\nresult of bank runs. As mentioned earlier, since banks make profits by lending out their deposits, no bank,\neven those that are not bankrupt, can withstand a bank run. As a result of the Panic, the Federal Reserve was\nfounded to be the \u201clender of last resort.\u201d In the event of a bank run, sound banks, (banks that were not\nbankrupt) could borrow as much cash as they needed from the Fed\u2019s discount \u201cwindow\u201d to quell the bank run.\nWe call the interest rate banks pay for such loans thediscount rate. (They are so named because the bank\nmakes loans against its outstanding loans \u201cat a discount\u201d of their face value.) Once depositors became\nconvinced that the bank would be able to honor their withdrawals, they no longer had a reason to make a run\non the bank. In short, the Federal Reserve was originally intended to provide credit passively, but in the years\nsince its founding, the Fed has taken on a more active role with monetary policy.\nThe second traditional method for conducting monetary policy is to raise or lower the discount rate. If the\ncentral bank raises the discount rate, then commercial banks will reduce their borrowing of reserves from the\nFed, and instead call in loans to replace those reserves. Since fewer loans are available, the money supply falls\nand market interest rates rise. If the central bank lowers the discount rate it charges to banks, the process\nworks in reverse.\nIn recent decades, the Federal Reserve has made relatively few discount loans. Before a bank borrows from the\nFederal Reserve to fill out its required reserves, the bank is expected to first borrow from other available\nsources, like other banks. This is encouraged by the Fed charging a higher discount rate than the federal funds\nrate. Given that most banks borrow little at the discount rate, changing the discount rate up or down has little\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.4 \u2022 Monetary Policy and Economic Outcomes 677\nimpact on their behavior. More importantly, the Fed has found from experience that open market operations\nare a more precise and powerful means of executing any desired monetary policy.\nChanging Reserve Requirements\nA potential third method of conducting monetary policy is for the central bank to raise or lower thereserve\nrequirement, which, as we noted earlier, is the percentage of each bank\u2019s deposits that it is legally required to\nhold either as cash in their vault or on deposit with the central bank. If banks are required to hold a greater\namount inreserves, they have less money available to lend out. If banks are allowed to hold a smaller amount\nin reserves, they will have a greater amount of money available to lend out.\nUntil very recently, the Federal Reserve required banks to hold reserves equal to 0% of the first $14.5 million\nin deposits, then to hold reserves equal to 3% of the deposits up to $103.6 million, and 10% of any amount\nabove $103.6 million. The Fed makes small changes in the reserve requirements almost every year. For\nexample, the $103.6 million dividing line is sometimes bumped up or down by a few million dollars. Today,\nthese rates are no longer in effect; as of March 2020 (when the pandemic-induced recession hit), the 10% and\n3% requirements were reduced to 0%, effectively eliminating the reserve requirement for all depository\ninstitutions.\nThe Fed rarely uses large changes in reserve requirements to execute monetary policy; the pandemic was an\nexception for obvious reasons. Also, a sudden demand that all banks increase their reserves would be\nextremely disruptive and difficult for them to comply. While loosening requirements too much might create a\ndanger of banks\u2019 inability to meet withdrawal demands, the benefits of reducing the reserve requirements in\nMarch 2020 exceeded the risks.\nChanging the Discount Rate\nIn the Federal Reserve Act, the phrase \u201c...to afford means of rediscounting commercial paper\u201d is contained in\nits long title. This was the main tool for monetary policy when the Fed was initially created. Today, the Federal\nReserve has even more tools at its disposal, including quantitative easing, overnight repurchase agreements,\nand interest on excess reserves.

Conversely, a monetary policy that raises interest rates and reduces borrowing in the\neconomy is acontractionary monetary policyortight monetary policy. This module will discuss how\nexpansionary and contractionary monetary policies affect interest rates and aggregate demand, and how such\npolicies will affect macroeconomic goals like unemployment and inflation. We will conclude with a look at the 678 28 \u2022 Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation\nFed\u2019s monetary policy practice in recent decades.\nThe Effect of Monetary Policy on Interest Rates\nConsider the market for loanable bank funds inFigure 28.7. The original equilibrium (E ) occurs at an 8%\n0\ninterest rate and a quantity of funds loaned and borrowed of $10 billion. An expansionary monetary policy will\nshift the supply of loanable funds to the right from the original supply curve (S ) to S , leading to an\n0 1\nequilibrium (E ) with a lower 6% interest rate and a quantity $14 billion in loaned funds. Conversely, a\n1\ncontractionary monetary policy will shift the supply of loanable funds to the left from the original supply curve\n(S ) to S , leading to an equilibrium (E ) with a higher 10% interest rate and a quantity of $8 billion in loaned\n0 2 2\nfunds.\nFIGURE28.7Monetary Policy and Interest RatesThe original equilibrium occurs at E . An expansionary monetary\n0\npolicy will shift the supply of loanable funds to the right from the original supply curve (S ) to the new supply curve\n0\n(S ) and to a new equilibrium of E , reducing the interest rate from 8% to 6%. A contractionary monetary policy will\n1 1\nshift the supply of loanable funds to the left from the original supply curve (S ) to the new supply (S ), and raise the\n0 2\ninterest rate from 8% to 10%.\nHow does a central bank \u201craise\u201d interest rates? When describing the central bank's monetary policy actions, it\nis common to hear that the central bank \u201craised interest rates\u201d or \u201clowered interest rates.\u201d We need to be clear\nabout this: more precisely, through open market operations the central bank changes bank reserves in a way\nwhich affects the supply curve of loanable funds. As a result,Figure 28.7shows that interest rates change. If\nthey do not meet the Fed\u2019s target, the Fed can supply more or less reserves until interest rates do.\nRecall that the specific interest rate the Fed targets is thefederal funds rate. The Federal Reserve has, since\n1995, established its target federal funds rate in advance of any open market operations.\nOf course, financial markets display a wide range ofinterest rates, representing borrowers with different risk\npremiums and loans that they must repay over different periods of time. In general, when the federal funds\nrate drops substantially, other interest rates drop, too, and when the federal funds rate rises, other interest\nrates rise. However, a fall or rise of one percentage point in the federal funds rate\u2014which remember is for\nborrowing overnight\u2014will typically have an effect of less than one percentage point on a 30-year loan to\npurchase a house or a three-year loan to purchase a car. Monetary policy can push the entire spectrum of\ninterest rates higher or lower, but the forces of supply and demand in those specific markets for lending and\nborrowing set the specific interest rates.\nThe Effect of Monetary Policy on Aggregate Demand\nMonetary policy affects interest rates and the available quantity of loanable funds, which in turn affects several\ncomponents of aggregate demand. Tight or contractionary monetary policy that leads to higher interest rates\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.4 \u2022 Monetary Policy and Economic Outcomes 679\nand a reduced quantity of loanable funds will reduce two components of aggregate demand. Business\ninvestment will decline because it is less attractive for firms to borrow money, and even firms that have money\nwill notice that, with higher interest rates, it is relatively more attractive to put those funds in a financial\ninvestment than to make an investment in physical capital. In addition, higher interest rates will discourage\nconsumer borrowing for big-ticket items like houses and cars. Conversely, loose or expansionary monetary\npolicy that leads to lower interest rates and a higher quantity of loanable funds will tend to increase business\ninvestment and consumer borrowing for big-ticket items.\nIf the economy is suffering a recession and high unemployment, with output belowpotential GDP,\nexpansionary monetary policy can help the economy return to potential GDP.Figure 28.8(a) illustrates this\nsituation. This example uses a short-run upward-slopingKeynesian aggregate supply curve(SRAS). The\noriginal equilibrium during a recession of E occurs at an output level of 600. An expansionary monetary\n0\npolicy will reduce interest rates and stimulate investment and consumption spending, causing the original\naggregate demand curve (AD ) to shift right to AD , so that the new equilibrium (E ) occurs at the potential GDP\n0 1 1\nlevel of 700.\nFIGURE28.8Expansionary or Contractionary Monetary Policy(a) The economy is originally in a recession with the\nequilibrium output and price shown at E . Expansionary monetary policy will reduce interest rates and shift\n0\naggregate demand to the right from AD to AD , leading to the new equilibrium (E ) at the potential GDP level of\n0 1 1\noutput with a relatively small rise in the price level. (b) The economy is originally producing above the potential GDP\nlevel of output at the equilibrium E and is experiencing pressures for an inflationary rise in the price level.\n0\nContractionary monetary policy will shift aggregate demand to the left from AD to AD , thus leading to a new\n0 1\nequilibrium (E ) at the potential GDP level of output.\n1\nConversely, if an economy is producing at a quantity of output above its potential GDP, a contractionary\nmonetary policy can reduce the inflationary pressures for a rising price level. InFigure 28.8(b), the original\nequilibrium (E ) occurs at an output of 750, which is above potential GDP. A contractionary monetary policy\n0\nwill raise interest rates, discourage borrowing for investment and consumption spending, and cause the\noriginal demand curve (AD ) to shift left to AD , so that the new equilibrium (E ) occurs at the potential GDP\n0 1 1\nlevel of 700.\nThese examples suggest that monetary policy should becountercyclical; that is, it should act to\ncounterbalance the business cycles of economic downturns and upswings. The Fed should loosen monetary\npolicy when a recession has caused unemployment to increase and tighten it when inflation threatens. Of\ncourse, countercyclical policy does pose a danger of overreaction. If loose monetary policy seeking to end a\nrecession goes too far, it may push aggregate demand so far to the right that it triggers inflation. If tight 680 28 \u2022 Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation\nmonetary policy seeking to reduce inflation goes too far, it may push aggregate demand so far to the left that a\nrecession begins.Figure 28.9(a) summarizes the chain of effects that connect loose and tight monetary policy\nto changes in output and the price level.\nFIGURE28.9The Pathways of Monetary Policy(a) In expansionary monetary policy the central bank causes the\nsupply of money and loanable funds to increase, which lowers the interest rate, stimulating additional borrowing for\ninvestment and consumption, and shifting aggregate demand right. The result is a higher price level and, at least in\nthe short run, higher real GDP. (b) In contractionary monetary policy, the central bank causes the supply of money\nand credit in the economy to decrease, which raises the interest rate, discouraging borrowing for investment and\nconsumption, and shifting aggregate demand left. The result is a lower price level and, at least in the short run,\nlower real GDP.\nFederal Reserve Actions Over Last Four Decades\nFor the period from 1970 through 2020, we can summarize Federal Reserve monetary policy by looking at how\nit targeted the federal funds interest rate using open market operations.\nOf course, telling the story of the U.S. economy since 1970 in terms of Federal Reserve actions leaves out many\nother macroeconomic factors that were influencing unemployment, recession, economic growth, and inflation\nover this time. The ten episodes of Federal Reserve action outlined in the sections below also demonstrate that\nwe should consider the central bank as one of the leading actors influencing the macro economy. As we noted\nearlier, the single person with the greatest power to influence the U.S. economy is probably the Federal Reserve\nchairperson.\nFigure 28.10shows how the Federal Reserve has carried out monetary policy by targeting the federal funds\ninterest rate in the last few decades. The graph shows the federal funds interest rate (remember, this interest\nrate is set through open market operations), theunemployment rate, and theinflation ratesince 1970.\nDifferent episodes of monetary policy during this period are indicated in the figure.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.4 \u2022 Monetary Policy and Economic Outcomes 681\nFIGURE28.10Monetary Policy, Unemployment, and InflationThrough the episodes here, the Federal Reserve\ntypically reacted to higher inflation with a contractionary monetary policy and a higher interest rate, and reacted to\nhigher unemployment with an expansionary monetary policy and a lower interest rate.\nEpisode 1\nConsider Episode 1 in the late 1970s. The rate of inflation was very high, exceeding 10% in 1979 and 1980, so\nthe Federal Reserve used tight monetary policy to raise interest rates, with the federal funds rate rising from\n5.5% in 1977 to 16.4% in 1981. By 1983, inflation was down to 3.2%, but aggregate demand contracted sharply\nenough that back-to-back recessions occurred in 1980 and in 1981\u20131982, and the unemployment rate rose\nfrom 5.8% in 1979 to 9.7% in 1982.\nEpisode 2\nIn Episode 2, when economists persuaded the Federal Reserve in the early 1980s that inflation was declining,\nthe Fed began slashing interest rates to reduce unemployment. The federal funds interest rate fell from 16.4%\nin 1981 to 6.8% in 1986. By 1986 or so, inflation had fallen to about 2% and the unemployment rate had come\ndown to 7%, and was still falling.\nEpisode 3\nHowever, in Episode 3 in the late 1980s, inflation appeared to be creeping up again, rising from 2% in 1986 up\ntoward 5% by 1989. In response, the Federal Reserve used contractionary monetary policy to raise the federal\nfunds rates from 6.6% in 1987 to 9.2% in 1989. The tighter monetary policy stopped inflation, which fell from\nabove 5% in 1990 to under 3% in 1992, but it also helped to cause the 1990-1991 recession, and the\nunemployment rate rose from 5.3% in 1989 to 7.5% by 1992.\nEpisode 4\nIn Episode 4, in the early 1990s, when the Federal Reserve was confident that inflation was back under control,\nit reduced interest rates, with the federal funds interest rate falling from 8.1% in 1990 to 3.5% in 1992. As the\neconomy expanded, the unemployment rate declined from 7.5% in 1992 to less than 5% by 1997.\nEpisodes 5 and 6\nIn Episodes 5 and 6, the Federal Reserve perceived a risk of inflation and raised the federal funds rate from 3%\nto 5.8% from 1993 to 1995. Inflation did not rise, and the period of economic growth during the 1990s\ncontinued. Then in 1999 and 2000, the Fed was concerned that inflation seemed to be creeping up so it raised\nthe federal funds interest rate from 4.6% in December 1998 to 6.5% in June 2000. By early 2001, inflation was\ndeclining again, but a recession occurred in 2001. Between 2000 and 2002, the unemployment rate rose from 682 28 \u2022 Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation\n4.0% to 5.8%.\nEpisodes 7 and 8\nIn Episodes 7 and 8, the Federal Reserve conducted a loose monetary policy and slashed the federal funds rate\nfrom 6.2% in 2000 to just 1.7% in 2002, and then again to 1% in 2003. They actually did this because of fear of\nJapan-style deflation. This persuaded them to lower the Fed funds further than they otherwise would have. The\nrecession ended, but, unemployment rates were slow to decline in the early 2000s. Finally, in 2004, the\nunemployment rate declined and the Federal Reserve began to raise the federal funds rate until it reached 5%\nby 2007.\nEpisode 9\nIn Episode 9, as the Great Recession took hold in 2008, the Federal Reserve was quick to slash interest rates,\ntaking them down to 2% in 2008 and to nearly 0% in 2009. When the Fed had taken interest rates down to\nnear-zero, the economy was still deep in recession. Open market operations could not make the interest rate\nturn negative. The Federal Reserve had to think \u201coutside the box.\u201d\nEpisode 10\nIn Episode 10, which started in March 2020, the Fed cut interest rates again, reducing the target federal funds\nrate from 2% to between 0\u20131/4% in a matter of weeks. Limited by the zero lower bound, the Fed once again had\nto think \u201coutside the box\u201d in order to further support the financial system.\nQuantitative Easing\nThe most powerful and commonly used of the three traditional tools of monetary policy\u2014open market\noperations\u2014works by expanding or contracting the money supply in a way that influences the interest rate. In\nlate 2008, as the U.S. economy struggled with recession, the Federal Reserve had already reduced the interest\nrate to near-zero. With the recession still ongoing, the Fed decided to adopt an innovative and nontraditional\npolicy known asquantitative easing (QE). This is the purchase of long-term government and private\nmortgage-backed securities by central banks to make credit available so as to stimulateaggregate demand.\nQuantitative easing differed from traditional monetary policy in several key ways. First, it involved the Fed\npurchasing long termTreasury bonds, rather than short termTreasury bills. In 2008, however, it was\nimpossible to stimulate the economy any further by lowering short term rates because they were already as\nlow as they could get. (Read the closing Bring it Home feature for more on this.) Therefore, Chairman Bernanke\nsought to lower long-term rates utilizing quantitative easing.\nThis leads to a second way QE is different from traditional monetary policy. Instead of purchasing Treasury\nsecurities, the Fed also began purchasing private mortgage-backed securities, something it had never done\nbefore. During the financial crisis, which precipitated the recession, mortgage-backed securities were termed\n\u201ctoxic assets,\u201d because when the housing market collapsed, no one knew what these securities were worth,\nwhich put the financial institutions which were holding those securities on very shaky ground. By offering to\npurchase mortgage-backed securities, the Fed was both pushing long term interest rates down and also\nremoving possibly \u201ctoxic assets\u201d from the balance sheets of private financial firms, which would strengthen\nthe financial system.\nQuantitative easing (QE) occurred in three episodes:\n1. During QE , which began in November 2008, the Fed purchased $600 billion in mortgage-backed\n1\nsecurities from government enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n2. In November 2010, the Fed began QE , in which it purchased $600 billion in U.S. Treasury bonds.\n2\n3. QE , began in September 2012 when the Fed commenced purchasing $40 billion of additional mortgage-\n3\nbacked securities per month. This amount was increased in December 2012 to $85 billion per month. The\nFed stated that, when economic conditions permit, it will begin tapering (or reducing the monthly\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.5 \u2022 Pitfalls for Monetary Policy 683\npurchases). By October 2014, the Fed had announced the final $15 billion bond purchase, ending\nQuantitative Easing.\nWe usually think of the quantitative easing policies that the Federal Reserve adopted (as did other central\nbanks around the world) as temporary emergency measures. If these steps are to be temporary, then the\nFederal Reserve will need to stop making these additional loans and sell off the financial securities it has\naccumulated. The concern is that the process of quantitative easing may prove more difficult to reverse than it\nwas to enact. The evidence suggests that QE was somewhat successful, but that QE and QE have been less\n1 2 3\nso.\nFast forward to March 2020, when the Fed under the leadership of Jerome Powell promised another round of\nasset purchases which was dubbed by some as \u201cQE4,\u201d intended once again to provide liquidity to a distressed\nfinancial system in the wake of the pandemic. This round was much faster, increasing Fed assets by $2 trillion\nin just a few months. Recently, the Fed has begun to slow down the purchase of these assets once again through\na taper, and the pace of the tapering is expected to increase through 2022. But as of the end of 2021, total Fed\nassets exceed $8 trillion, compared to $4 trillion in February 2020.\n28.5Pitfalls for Monetary Policy\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Analyze whether monetary policy decisions should be made more democratically\n\u2022 Calculate the velocity of money\n\u2022 Evaluate the central bank\u2019s influence on inflation, unemployment, asset bubbles, and leverage cycles\n\u2022 Calculate the effects of monetary stimulus\nIn the real world, effective monetary policy faces a number of significant hurdles. Monetary policy affects the\neconomy only after a time lag that is typically long and of variable length. Remember, monetary policy involves\na chain of events: thecentral bankmust perceive a situation in the economy, hold a meeting, and make a\ndecision to react by tightening or loosening monetary policy. The change in monetary policy must percolate\nthrough the banking system, changing the quantity of loans and affecting interest rates. When interest rates\nchange, businesses must change their investment levels and consumers must change their borrowing patterns\nwhen purchasing homes or cars. Then it takes time for these changes to filter through the rest of the economy.\nAs a result of this chain of events, monetary policy has little effect in the immediate future. Instead, its primary\neffects are felt perhaps one to three years in the future. The reality of long and variable time lags does not\nmean that a central bank should refuse to make decisions. It does mean that central banks should be humble\nabout taking action, because of the risk that their actions can create as much or more economic instability as\nthey resolve.\nExcess Reserves\nBanks are legally required to hold a minimum level of reserves, but no rule prohibits them from holding\nadditionalexcess reservesabove the legally mandated limit. For example, during a recession banks may be\nhesitant to lend, because they fear that when the economy is contracting, a high proportion of loan applicants\nbecome less likely to repay their loans.\nWhen many banks are choosing to hold excess reserves, expansionary monetary policy may not work well.\nThis may occur because the banks are concerned about a deteriorating economy, while the central bank is\ntrying to expand the money supply. If the banks prefer to hold excess reserves above the legally required level,\nthe central bank cannot force individual banks to make loans. Similarly, sensible businesses and consumers\nmay be reluctant to borrow substantial amounts of money in arecession, because they recognize that firms\u2019\nsales and employees\u2019 jobs are more insecure in a recession, and they do not want to face the need to make\ninterest payments. The result is that during an especially deep recession, an expansionary monetary policy 684 28 \u2022 Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation\nmay have little effect on either the price level or thereal GDP.\nJapan experienced this situation in the 1990s and early 2000s. Japan\u2019s economy entered a period of very slow\ngrowth, dipping in and out of recession, in the early 1990s. By February 1999, the Bank of Japan had lowered\nthe equivalent of its federal funds rate to 0%. It kept it there most of the time through 2003. Moreover, in the\ntwo years from March 2001 to March 2003, the Bank of Japan also expanded the country's money supply by\nabout 50%\u2014an enormous increase. Even this highly expansionary monetary policy, however, had no\nsubstantial effect on stimulating aggregate demand. Japan\u2019s economy continued to experience extremely slow\ngrowth into the mid-2000s.\nCLEAR IT UP\nShould monetary policy decisions be made more democratically?\nShould a nation\u2019s Congress or legislature comprised of elected representatives conduct monetary policy or should a\npolitically appointed central bank that is more independent of voters take charge? Here are some of the arguments.\nThe Case for Greater Democratic Control of Monetary Policy\nElected representatives pass taxes and spending bills to conduct fiscal policy by passing tax and spending bills.\nThey could handle monetary policy in the same way. They will sometimes make mistakes, but in a democracy, it is\nbetter to have elected officials who are accountable to voters make mistakes instead of political appointees. After\nall, the people appointed to the top governing positions at the Federal Reserve\u2014and to most central banks around\nthe world\u2014are typically bankers and economists. They are not representatives of borrowers like small businesses or\nfarmers nor are they representatives of labor unions. Central banks might not be so quick to raise interest rates if\nthey had to pay more attention to firms and people in the real economy.\nThe Case for an Independent Central Bank\nBecause the central bank has some insulation from day-to-day politics, its members can take a nonpartisan look at\nspecific economic situations and make tough, immediate decisions when necessary. The idea of giving a legislature\nthe ability to create money and hand out loans is likely to end up badly, sooner or later. It is simply too tempting for\nlawmakers to expand the money supply to fund their projects. The long term result will be rampant inflation. Also, a\ncentral bank, acting according to the laws passed by elected officials, can respond far more quickly than a\nlegislature. For example, the U.S. budget takes months to debate, pass, and sign into law, but monetary policy\ndecisions happen much more rapidly. Day-to-day democratic control of monetary policy is impractical and seems\nlikely to lead to an overly expansionary monetary policy and higher inflation.\nThe problem of excess reserves does not affect contractionary policy. Central bankers have an old saying that\nmonetary policy can be like pulling and pushing on a string: when the central bank pulls on the string and uses\ncontractionary monetary policy, it can definitely raise interest rates and reduce aggregate demand. However,\nwhen the central bank tries to push on the string of expansionary monetary policy, the string may sometimes\njust fold up limp and have little effect, because banks decide not to loan out their excess reserves. Do not take\nthis analogy too literally\u2014expansionary monetary policy usually does have real effects, after that\ninconveniently long and variable lag. There are also times, like Japan\u2019s economy in the late 1990s and early\n2000s, when expansionary monetary policy has been insufficient to lift a recession-prone economy.\nUnpredictable Movements of Velocity\nVelocity is a term that economists use to describe how quickly money circulates through the economy. We\ndefine thevelocityof money in a year as:\nSpecific measurements of velocity depend on the definition of the money supply used. Consider the velocity of\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.5 \u2022 Pitfalls for Monetary Policy 685\nM1, the total amount of currency in circulation and checking account balances. In 2009, for example, M1 was\n$1.7 trillion and nominal GDP was $14.3 trillion, so the velocity of M1 was 8.4 (which is $14.3 trillion/$1.7\ntrillion). A higher velocity of money means that the average dollar circulates more times in a year. A lower\nvelocity means that the average dollar circulates fewer times in a year.\nSee the following Clear It Up feature for a discussion of how deflation could affect monetary policy.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat happens during episodes of deflation?\nDeflationoccurs when the rate of inflation is negative; that is, instead of money having less purchasing power over\ntime, as occurs with inflation, money is worth more. Deflation can make it very difficult for monetary policy to\naddress a recession.\nRemember that the real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation. If thenominal interest\nrateis 7% and the rate of inflation is 3%, then the borrower is effectively paying a 4% real interest rate. If the\nnominal interest rate is 7% and there isdeflationof 2%, then the real interest rate is actually 9%. In this way, an\nunexpected deflation raises the real interest payments for borrowers. It can lead to a situation where borrowers do\nnot repay an unexpectedly high number of loans, and banks find that their net worth is decreasing or negative. When\nbanks are suffering losses, they become less able and eager to make new loans. Aggregate demand declines, which\ncan lead to recession.\nThen the double-whammy: After causing a recession, deflation can make it difficult for monetary policy to work. Say\nthat the central bank uses expansionary monetary policy to reduce the nominal interest rate all the way to zero\u2014but\nthe economy has 5% deflation. As a result, the real interest rate is 5%, and because a central bank cannot make the\nnominal interest rate negative, expansionary policy cannot reduce the real interest rate further.\nIn the U.S. economy during the early 1930s, deflation was 6.7% per year from 1930\u20131933, which caused many\nborrowers to default on their loans and many banks to end up bankrupt, which in turn contributed substantially to\nthe Great Depression. Not all episodes of deflation, however, end in economic depression. Japan, for example,\nexperienced deflation of slightly less than 1% per year from 1999\u20132002, which hurt the Japanese economy, but it\nstill grew by about 0.9% per year over this period. There is at least one historical example of deflation coexisting\nwith rapid growth. The U.S. economy experienced deflation of about 1.1% per year over the quarter-century from\n1876\u20131900, but real GDP also expanded at a rapid clip of 4% per year over this time, despite some occasional\nsevere recessions.\nThe central bank should be on guard against deflation and, if necessary, use expansionary monetary policy to\nprevent any long-lasting or extreme deflation from occurring. Except in severe cases like the Great Depression,\ndeflation does not guarantee economic disaster.\nChanges in velocity can cause problems for monetary policy. To understand why, rewrite the definition of\nvelocity so that the money supply is on the left-hand side of the equation. That is:\nRecall fromThe Macroeconomic Perspectivethat\nTherefore,\nWe sometimes call this equation thebasic quantity equation of moneybut, as you can see, it is just the\ndefinition of velocity written in a different form. This equation must hold true, by definition. 686 28 \u2022 Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation\nIf velocity is constant over time, then a certain percentage rise in the money supply on the left-hand side of the\nbasic quantity equation of money will inevitably lead to the same percentage rise innominal GDP\u2014although\nthis change could happen through an increase in inflation, or an increase inreal GDP, or some combination of\nthe two. If velocity is changing over time but in a constant and predictable way, then changes in the money\nsupply will continue to have a predictable effect on nominal GDP. If velocity changes unpredictably over time,\nhowever, then the effect of changes in the money supply on nominal GDP becomes unpredictable.\nFigure 28.11illustrates the actual velocity of money in the U.S. economy as measured by using M1, the most\ncommon definition of the money supply. From 1960 up to about 1980, velocity appears fairly predictable; that\nis, it is increasing at a fairly constant rate. In the early 1980s, however, velocity as calculated with M1 becomes\nmore variable. The reasons for these sharp changes in velocity remain a puzzle. Economists suspect that the\nchanges in velocity are related to innovations in banking and finance which have changed how we are using\nmoney in making economic transactions: for example, the growth of electronic payments; a rise in personal\nborrowing and credit card usage; and accounts that make it easier for people to hold money in savings\naccounts, where it is counted as M2, right up to the moment that they want to write a check on the money and\ntransfer it to M1. So far at least, it has proven difficult to draw clear links between these kinds of factors and the\nspecific up-and-down fluctuations in M1. Given many changes in banking and the prevalence of electronic\nbanking, economists now favorM2as a measure of money rather than the narrower M1.\nFIGURE28.11Velocity Calculated Using M1Velocity is the nominal GDP divided by the money supply for a given\nyear. We can calculate different measures of velocity by using different measures of the money supply. Velocity, as\ncalculated by using M1, has lacked a steady trend since the 1980s, instead bouncing up and down. Note also that\nthe redefinition of M1 to include savings deposits in 2020 (seeMoney and Banking) drastically increased M1 in\n2020, causing velocity to plummet. (credit: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)\nClick to view content(https://openstax.org/books/principles-economics-3e/pages/28-5-pitfalls-for-monetary-\npolicy)\nVelocity Calculated Using M1\nIn the 1970s, when velocity as measured by M1 seemed predictable, a number of economists, led by Nobel\nlaureateMilton Friedman(1912\u20132006), argued that the best monetary policy was for the central bank to\nincrease the money supply at a constant growth rate. These economists argued that with the long and variable\nlags of monetary policy, and the political pressures on central bankers, central bank monetary policies were as\nlikely to have undesirable as to have desirable effects. Thus, these economists believed that the monetary\npolicy should seek steady growth in the money supply of 3% per year. They argued that a steady monetary\ngrowth rate would be correct over longer time periods, since it would roughly match the growth of the real\neconomy. In addition, they argued that giving the central bank less discretion to conduct monetary policy\nwould prevent an overly activist central bank from becoming a source of economic instability and uncertainty.\nIn this spirit, Friedman wrote in 1967: \u201cThe first and most important lesson that history teaches about what\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.5 \u2022 Pitfalls for Monetary Policy 687\nmonetary policy can do\u2014and it is a lesson of the most profound importance\u2014is that monetary policy can\nprevent money itself from being a major source of economic disturbance.\u201d\nAs the velocity of M1 began to fluctuate in the 1980s, having the money supply grow at a predetermined and\nunchanging rate seemed less desirable, because as the quantity theory of money shows, the combination of\nconstant growth in the money supply and fluctuating velocity would cause nominal GDP to rise and fall in\nunpredictable ways. The jumpiness of velocity in the 1980s caused many central banks to focus less on the\nrate at which the quantity of money in the economy was increasing, and instead to set monetary policy by\nreacting to whether the economy was experiencing or in danger of higher inflation or unemployment.\nUnemployment and Inflation\nIf you were to survey central bankers around the world and ask them what they believe should be the primary\ntask of monetary policy, the most popular answer by far would be fighting inflation. Most central bankers\nbelieve that the neoclassical model of economics accurately represents the economy over the medium to long\nterm. Remember that in theneoclassical modelof the economy, we draw the aggregate supply curve as a\nvertical line at the level of potential GDP, asFigure 28.12shows. In the neoclassical model, economists\ndetermine the level of potential GDP (and the natural rate of unemployment that exists when the economy is\nproducing at potential GDP) by real economic factors. If the original level ofaggregate demandis AD , then an\n0\nexpansionary monetary policy that shifts aggregate demand to AD only creates an inflationary increase in the\n1\nprice level, but it does not alter GDP or unemployment. From this perspective, all that monetary policy can do\nis to lead to low inflation or high inflation\u2014and low inflation provides a better climate for a healthy and growing\neconomy. After all, low inflation means that businesses making investments can focus on real economic\nissues, not on figuring out ways to protect themselves from the costs and risks of inflation. In this way, a\nconsistent pattern of low inflation can contribute to long-term growth.\nFIGURE28.12Monetary Policy in a Neoclassical ModelIn a neoclassical view, monetary policy affects only the\nprice level, not the level of output in the economy. For example, an expansionary monetary policy causes aggregate\ndemand to shift from the original AD to AD . However, the adjustment of the economy from the original equilibrium\n0 1\n(E ) to the new equilibrium (E ) represents an inflationary increase in the price level from P to P , but has no effect\n0 1 0 1\nin the long run on output or the unemployment rate. In fact, no shift in AD will affect the equilibrium quantity of\noutput in this model.\nThis vision of focusing monetary policy on a low rate of inflation is so attractive that many countries have\nrewritten their central banking laws since in the 1990s to have their bank practiceinflation targeting, which\nmeans that the central bank is legally required to focus primarily on keeping inflation low. By 2014, central\nbanks in 28 countries, including Austria, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden,\nThailand, and the United Kingdom faced a legal requirement to target the inflation rate. A notable exception is\ntheFederal Reservein the United States, which does not practice inflation-targeting. Instead, the law\ngoverning the Federal Reserve requires it to take both unemployment and inflation into account. 688 28 \u2022 Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation\nEconomists have no final consensus on whether a central bank should be required to focus only on inflation or\nshould have greater discretion. For those who subscribe to the inflation targeting philosophy, the fear is that\npoliticians who are worried about slow economic growth and unemployment will constantly pressure the\ncentral bank to conduct a loose monetary policy\u2014even if the economy is already producing atpotential GDP. In\nsome countries, the central bank may lack the political power to resist such pressures, with the result of higher\ninflation, but no long-term reduction in unemployment. The U.S. Federal Reserve has a tradition of\nindependence, but central banks in other countries may be under greater political pressure. For all of these\nreasons\u2014long and variable lags, excess reserves, unstable velocity, and controversy over economic\ngoals\u2014monetary policy in the real world is often difficult. The basic message remains, however, that central\nbanks can affect aggregate demand through the conduct of monetary policy and in that way influence\nmacroeconomic outcomes.\nAsset Bubbles and Leverage Cycles\nOne long-standing concern about having the central bank focus on inflation and unemployment is that it may\nbe overlooking certain other economic problems that are coming in the future. For example, from 1994 to\n2000 during what was known as the \u201cdot-com\u201d boom, the U.S. stock market, which theDow JonesIndustrial\nIndex measures (which includes 30 very large companies from across the U.S. economy), nearly tripled in\nvalue. TheNasdaqindex, which includes many smaller technology companies, increased in value by a\nmultiple of five from 1994 to 2000. These rates of increase were clearly not sustainable. Stock values as\nmeasured by the Dow Jones were almost 20% lower in 2009 than they had been in 2000. Stock values in the\nNasdaq index were 50% lower in 2009 than they had been in 2000. The drop-off in stock market values\ncontributed to the 2001 recession and the higher unemployment that followed.\nWe can tell a similar story about housing prices in the mid-2000s. During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s,\nhousing prices increased at about 6% per year on average. During what came to be known as the \u201chousing\nbubble\u201d from 2003 to 2005, housing prices increased at almost double this annual rate. These rates of increase\nwere clearly not sustainable. When housing prices fell in 2007 and 2008, many banks and households found\nthat their assets were worth less than they expected, which contributed to the recession that started in 2007.\nAt a broader level, some economists worry about aleverage cycle, where \u201cleverage\u201d is a term financial\neconomists use to mean \u201cborrowing.\u201d When economic times are good, banks and the financial sector are eager\nto lend, and people and firms are eager to borrow. Remember that amoney multiplierdetermines the amount\nof money and credit in an economy \u2014a process of loans made, money deposited, and more loans made. In good\neconomic times, this surge of lending exaggerates the episode of economic growth. It can even be part of what\nlead prices of certain assets\u2014like stock prices or housing prices\u2014to rise at unsustainably high annual rates. At\nsome point, when economic times turn bad, banks and the financial sector become much less willing to lend,\nand credit becomes expensive or unavailable to many potential borrowers. The sharp reduction in credit,\nperhaps combined with the deflating prices of a dot-com stock price bubble or a housing bubble, makes the\neconomic downturn worse than it would otherwise be.\nThus, some economists have suggested that the central bank should not just look at economic growth,\ninflation, and unemployment rates, but should also keep an eye on asset prices and leverage cycles. Such\nproposals are quite controversial. If a central bank had announced in 1997 that stock prices were rising \u201ctoo\nfast\u201d or in 2004 that housing prices were rising \u201ctoo fast,\u201d and then taken action to hold down price increases,\nmany people and their elected political representatives would have been outraged. Neither the Federal\nReserve nor any other central banks want to take the responsibility of deciding when stock prices and housing\nprices are too high, too low, or just right. As further research explores how asset price bubbles and leverage\ncycles can affect an economy, central banks may need to think about whether they should conduct monetary\npolicy in a way that would seek to moderate these effects.\nLet\u2019s end this chapter with a Work it Out exercise in how the Fed\u2014or any central bank\u2014would stir up the\neconomy by increasing the money supply.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.5 \u2022 Pitfalls for Monetary Policy 689\nWORK IT OUT\nCalculating the Effects of Monetary Stimulus\nSuppose that the central bank wants to stimulate the economy by increasing the money supply. The bankers\nestimate that the velocity of money is 3, and that the price level will increase from 100 to 110 due to the\nstimulus. Using the quantity equation of money, what will be the impact of an $800 billion dollar increase in the\nmoney supply on the quantity of goods and services in the economy given an initial money supply of $4 trillion?\nStep 1. We begin by writing the quantity equation of money: MV = PQ. We know that initially V = 3, M = 4,000\n(billion) and P = 100. Substituting these numbers in, we can solve for Q:\nStep 2. Now we want to find the effect of the addition $800 billion in the money supply, together with the\nincrease in the price level. The new equation is:\nStep 3. If we take the difference between the two quantities, we find that the monetary stimulus increased the\nquantity of goods and services in the economy by 10.9 billion.\nThe discussion in this chapter has focused on domestic monetary policy; that is, the view of monetary policy\nwithin an economy.Exchange Rates and International Capital Flowsexplores the international dimension of\nmonetary policy, and how monetary policy becomes involved withexchange ratesand international flows of\nfinancial capital.\nBRING IT HOME\nThe Problem of the Zero Percent Interest Rate Lower Bound\nIn 2008, the U.S. Federal Reserve found itself in a difficult position. The federal funds rate was on its way to near\nzero, which meant that traditional open market operations, by which the Fed purchases U.S. Treasury Bills to lower\nshort term interest rates, was no longer viable. This so called \u201czero bound problem,\u201d prompted the Fed, under then\nChair Ben Bernanke, to attempt some unconventional policies, collectively called quantitative easing. By early 2014,\nquantitative easing nearly quintupled the amount of bank reserves. This likely contributed to the U.S. economy\u2019s\nrecovery, but the impact was muted, probably due to some of the hurdles mentioned in the last section of this\nmodule. The unprecedented increase in bank reserves also led to fears of inflation, which never bore out.\nThroughout the 2010s there have been no serious signs of inflation with core inflation around a stable 1.5\u20132%. As of\nearly 2015, however, there have been no serious signs of a boom, with core inflation around a stable 1.7%.\nThe Zero Lower Bound was encountered again in 2020 due to the pandemic, when the target federal funds rate\ndropped by over two percentage points in a matter of weeks. The Fed further responded by increasing asset\npurchases by an even greater amount, and at a faster rate, than in 2009. When the U.S. started experiencing higher-\nthan-average inflation in 2021, the Fed chair Jerome Powell responded to criticisms by saying that the Fed was\npoised to consider rate increases and start tapering the rate of asset purchases into 2022. It remains to be seen\nwhether inflation can be tamed moving forward, or if more aggressive policy measures will be required. 690 28 \u2022 Key Terms\nKey Terms\nbank run when depositors race to the bank to withdraw their deposits for fear that otherwise they would be\nlost\nbasic quantity equation of money money supply \u00d7 velocity = nominal GDP\ncentral bank institution which conducts a nation\u2019s monetary policy and regulates its banking system\ncontractionary monetary policy a monetary policy that reduces the supply of money and loans\ncountercyclical moving in the opposite direction of the business cycle of economic downturns and upswings\ndeposit insurance an insurance system that makes sure depositors in a bank do not lose their money, even if\nthe bank goes bankrupt\ndiscount rate the interest rate charged by the central bank on the loans that it gives to other commercial\nbanks\nexcess reserves reserves banks hold that exceed the legally mandated limit\nexpansionary monetary policy a monetary policy that increases the supply of money and the quantity of\nloans\nfederal funds rate the interest rate at which one bank lends funds to another bank overnight\ninflation targeting a rule that the central bank is required to focus only on keeping inflation low\nlender of last resort an institution that provides short-term emergency loans in conditions of financial crisis\nloose monetary policy see expansionary monetary policy\nopen market operations the central bank selling or buying Treasury bonds to influence the quantity of money\nand the level of interest rates\nquantitative easing (QE) the purchase of long term government and private mortgage-backed securities by\ncentral banks to make credit available in hopes of stimulating aggregate demand\nreserve requirement the percentage amount of its total deposits that a bank is legally obligated to either hold\nas cash in their vault or deposit with the central bank\ntight monetary policy see contractionary monetary policy\nvelocity the speed with which money circulates through the economy; calculated as the nominal GDP divided\nby the money supply\nKey Concepts and Summary\n28.1The Federal Reserve Banking System and Central Banks\nThe most prominent task of a central bank is to conduct monetary policy, which involves changes to interest\nrates and credit conditions, affecting the amount of borrowing and spending in an economy. Some prominent\ncentral banks around the world include the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of\nJapan, and the Bank of England.\n28.2Bank Regulation\nA bank run occurs when there are rumors (possibly true, possibly false) that a bank is at financial risk of\nhaving negative net worth. As a result, depositors rush to the bank to withdraw their money and put it\nsomeplace safer. Even false rumors, if they cause a bank run, can force a healthy bank to lose its deposits and\nbe forced to close. Deposit insurance guarantees bank depositors that, even if the bank has negative net worth,\ntheir deposits will be protected. In the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) collects\ndeposit insurance premiums from banks and guarantees bank deposits up to $250,000. Bank supervision\ninvolves inspecting the balance sheets of banks to make sure that they have positive net worth and that their\nassets are not too risky. In the United States, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is responsible\nfor supervising banks and inspecting savings and loans and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)\nis responsible for inspecting credit unions. The FDIC and the Federal Reserve also play a role in bank\nsupervision.\nWhen a central bank acts as a lender of last resort, it makes short-term loans available in situations of severe\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28 \u2022 Self-Check Questions 691\nfinancial panic or stress. The failure of a single bank can be treated like any other business failure. Yet if many\nbanks fail, it can reduce aggregate demand in a way that can bring on or deepen a recession. The combination\nof deposit insurance, bank supervision, and lender of last resort policies help to prevent weaknesses in the\nbanking system from causing recessions.\n28.3How a Central Bank Executes Monetary Policy\nA central bank has three traditional tools to conduct monetary policy: open market operations, which involves\nbuying and selling government bonds with banks; reserve requirements, which determine what level of\nreserves a bank is legally required to hold; and discount rates, which is the interest rate charged by the central\nbank on the loans that it gives to other commercial banks. The most commonly used tool is open market\noperations.\n28.4Monetary Policy and Economic Outcomes\nAn expansionary (or loose) monetary policy raises the quantity of money and credit above what it otherwise\nwould have been and reduces interest rates, boosting aggregate demand, and thus countering recession. A\ncontractionary monetary policy, also called a tight monetary policy, reduces the quantity of money and credit\nbelow what it otherwise would have been and raises interest rates, seeking to hold down inflation. During the\n2008\u20132009 recession, central banks around the world also used quantitative easing to expand the supply of\ncredit.\n28.5Pitfalls for Monetary Policy\nMonetary policy is inevitably imprecise, for a number of reasons: (a) the effects occur only after long and\nvariable lags; (b) if banks decide to hold excess reserves, monetary policy cannot force them to lend; and (c)\nvelocity may shift in unpredictable ways. The basic quantity equation of money is MV = PQ, where M is the\nmoney supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the real output of the economy. Some\ncentral banks, like the European Central Bank, practice inflation targeting, which means that the only goal of\nthe central bank is to keep inflation within a low target range. Other central banks, such as the U.S. Federal\nReserve, are free to focus on either reducing inflation or stimulating an economy that is in recession,\nwhichever goal seems most important at the time.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

On January 1,\n2002, one dollar was worth 1.11 euros. On April 24, 2008 it hit its lowest point with a dollar being worth 0.64 euros.\nDuring this period, the trade deficit between the United States and the European Union grew from a yearly total of\napproximately 85.7 billion dollars in 2002 to 95.8 billion dollars in 2008. Was this a good thing or a bad thing for the\nU.S. economy?\nWe live in a global world. U.S. consumers buy trillions of dollars worth of imported goods and services each year, not\njust from the European Union, but from all over the world. U.S. businesses sell trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of exports.\nU.S. citizens, businesses, and governments invest trillions of dollars abroad every year. Foreign investors, 696 29 \u2022 Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows\nbusinesses, and governments invest trillions of dollars in the United States each year. Indeed, foreigners are a major\nbuyer of U.S. federal debt.\nMany people feel that a weaker dollar is bad for America, that it\u2019s an indication of a weak economy, but is it? This\nchapter will help answer that question.\nThe world has over 150 different currencies, from the Afghanistan afghani and the Albanian lek all the way\nthrough the alphabet to the Zambian kwacha and the Zimbabwean dollar. For international economic\ntransactions, households or firms will wish to exchange one currency for another. Perhaps the need for\nexchanging currencies will come from a German firm that exports products to Russia, but then wishes to\nexchange the Russian rubles it has earned for euros, so that the firm can pay its workers and suppliers in\nGermany. Perhaps it will be a South African firm that wishes to purchase a mining operation in Angola, but to\nmake the purchase it must convert South African rand to Angolan kwanza. Perhaps it will be an American\ntourist visiting China, who wishes to convert U.S. dollars to Chinese yuan to pay the hotel bill.\nExchange rates can sometimes change very swiftly. For example, in the United Kingdom the pound was worth\nabout $1.50 just before the nation voted to leave the European Union (also known as the Brexit vote), in June\n2016; the pound fell to $1.37 just after the vote and continued falling to reach 30-year lows a few months later.\nFor firms engaged in international buying, selling, lending, and borrowing, these swings in exchange rates can\nhave an enormous effect on profits.\nThis chapter discusses the international dimension of money, which involves conversions from one currency\nto another at an exchange rate. Anexchange rateis nothing more than a price\u2014that is, the price of one\ncurrency in terms of another currency\u2014and so we can analyze it with the tools ofsupplyanddemand. The first\nmodule of this chapter begins with an overview of foreign exchange markets: their size, their main\nparticipants, and the vocabulary for discussing movements of exchange rates. The following module uses\ndemand and supply graphs to analyze some of the main factors that cause shifts in exchange rates. A final\nmodule then brings the central bank and monetary policy back into the picture. Each country must decide\nwhether to allow the market to determine its exchange rate, or have the central bank intervene. All the choices\nfor exchange rate policy involve distinctive tradeoffs and risks.\n29.1How the Foreign Exchange Market Works\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Define \"foreign exchange market\"\n\u2022 Describe different types of investments like foreign direct investments (FDI), portfolio investments, and\nhedging\n\u2022 Explain how appreciating or depreciating currency affects exchange rates\n\u2022 Identify who benefits from a stronger currency and benefits from a weaker currency\nMost countries have different currencies, but not all. Sometimes small economies use an economically larger\nneighbor's currency. For example, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Panama have decided todollarize\u2014that is, to use\nthe U.S. dollar as their currency. Sometimes nations share a common currency. A large-scale example of a\ncommon currency is the decision by 17 European nations\u2014including some very large economies such as\nFrance, Germany, and Italy\u2014to replace their former currencies with the euro at the start of 1999. With these\nexceptions, most of the international economy takes place in a situation of multiple national currencies in\nwhich both people and firms need to convert from one currency to another when selling, buying, hiring,\nborrowing, traveling, or investing across national borders. We call the market in which people or firms use one\ncurrency to purchase another currency theforeign exchange market.\nYou have encountered the basic concept of exchange rates in earlier chapters. InThe International Trade and\nCapital Flows, for example, we discussed how economists use exchange rates to compareGDPstatistics from\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.1 \u2022 How the Foreign Exchange Market Works 697\ncountries where they measure GDP in different currencies. These earlier examples, however, took the actual\nexchange rate as given, as if it were a fact of nature. In reality, the exchange rate is a price\u2014the price of one\ncurrency expressed in terms of units of another currency. The key framework for analyzing prices, whether in\nthis course, any other economics course, in public policy, or business examples, is the operation of supply and\ndemand in markets.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/exratecalc)for an exchange rate calculator.\nThe Extraordinary Size of the Foreign Exchange Markets\nIf you travel to a foreign country that uses a different currency, you will undoubtedly need to make a trip to a\nbank or foreign currency office to exchange whatever currency you\u2019re holding for that country\u2019s currency. Even\nthough this is a simple transaction, it is part of a very large market. The quantities traded in foreign exchange\nmarkets are breathtaking. A 2019 Bank of International Settlements survey found that $5.3 trillionper daywas\ntraded on foreign exchange markets, which makes the foreign exchange market the largest market in the world\neconomy. In contrast, 2019 U.S. real GDP was $21.4 trillionper year.\nYour transaction is simple enough. Suppose you carry a $100 bill. You bring it into the foreign currency office\nand look up, and you see a bunch of different numbers on a digital board. For example, if you are traveling to\nTurkey, whose national currency is the Turkish Lira, one line of the board might read: \u201cU.S. DOLLARS: BUY\n5.50; SELL 5.80.\u201d This means that the office will give you 5.50 Turkish Lira in exchange for 1 U.S. dollar. If you\nhave $100, the office will give you 550 Turkish Lira. If you want tosellTurkish Lira for U.S. dollars, the office\nwill surely buy them from you, but not at the same exchange rate, since the office will make some money on the\nexchange. So if you bring 550 Turkish Lira and ask for U.S. dollars, it will not give you 100 dollars, but instead\nabout $95. The important point is that this one transaction, when repeated all over the world for all sorts of\ndifferent transactions, ends up totaling $6.6 trillion worth of exchanges per day.\nTable 29.1shows the currencies most commonly traded on foreign exchange markets. The U.S. dollar\ndominates the foreign exchange market, being on one side of 88.3% of all foreign exchange transactions. The\nU.S. dollar is followed by the euro, the British pound, the Australian dollar, and the Japanese yen.\nCurrency % Daily Share\nU.S. dollar 88.3%\nEuro 32.3%\nJapanese yen 16.8%\nBritish pound 12.8%\nAustralian dollar 6.8%\nTABLE29.1Currencies Traded\nMost on Foreign Exchange Markets\nas of September, 2019The \u201c%\nDaily Share\u201d shows the percentage\nof transactions where the currency\nis on one side of the exchange.\n(Source: https://www.bis.org/\nstatistics/rpfx19_fx.pdf) 698 29 \u2022 Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows\nCurrency % Daily Share\nCanadian dollar 5.0%\nSwiss franc 5.0%\nChinese yuan 4.3%\nTABLE29.1Currencies Traded\nMost on Foreign Exchange Markets\nas of September, 2019The \u201c%\nDaily Share\u201d shows the percentage\nof transactions where the currency\nis on one side of the exchange.\n(Source: https://www.bis.org/\nstatistics/rpfx19_fx.pdf)\nDemanders and Suppliers of Currency in Foreign Exchange Markets\nIn foreign exchange markets, demand and supply become closely interrelated, because a person or firm who\ndemands one currency must at the same time supply another currency\u2014and vice versa. To get a sense of this,\nit is useful to consider four groups of people or firms who participate in the market: (1)firmsthat are involved\nin international trade of goods and services; (2) tourists visiting other countries; (3) international investors\nbuying ownership (or part-ownership) of a foreign firm; (4) international investors making financial\ninvestments that do not involve ownership. Let\u2019s consider these categories in turn.\nFirms that buy and sell on international markets find that their costs for workers, suppliers, and investors are\nmeasured in the currency of the nation where their production occurs, but their revenues from sales are\nmeasured in the currency of the different nation where their sales happened. Thus, a Chinese firm exporting\nabroad will earn some other currency\u2014say, U.S. dollars\u2014but will need Chinese yuan to pay the workers,\nsuppliers, and investors who are based in China. In the foreign exchange markets, this firm will be a supplier of\nU.S. dollars and a demander of Chinese yuan.\nInternational tourists will supply their home currency to receive the currency of the country they are visiting.\nFor example, an American tourist who is visiting China will supply U.S. dollars into the foreign exchange\nmarket and demand Chinese yuan.\nWe often divide financial investments that cross international boundaries, and require exchanging currency\ninto two categories.Foreign direct investment (FDI)refers to purchasing a firm (at least ten percent) in\nanother country or starting up a new enterprise in a foreign country For example, in 2008 the Belgian beer-\nbrewing company InBev bought the U.S. beer-maker Anheuser-Busch for $52 billion. To make this purchase,\nInBev would have to supply euros (the currency of Belgium) to the foreign exchange market and demand U.S.\ndollars.\nThe other kind of international financial investment,portfolio investment, involves a purely financial\ninvestment that does not entail any management responsibility. An example would be a U.S. financial investor\nwho purchased U.K. government bonds, or deposited money in a British bank. To make such investments, the\nAmerican investor would supply U.S. dollars in the foreign exchange market and demand British pounds.\nBusiness people often link portfolio investment to expectations about how exchange rates will shift. Look at a\nU.S. financial investor who is considering purchasing U.K. issued bonds. For simplicity, ignore any bond\ninterest payment (which will be small in the short run anyway) and focus on exchange rates. Say that a British\npound is currently worth $1.50 in U.S. currency. However, the investor believes that in a month, the British\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.1 \u2022 How the Foreign Exchange Market Works 699\npound will be worth $1.60 in U.S. currency. Thus, asFigure 29.2(a) shows, this investor would change $24,000\nfor 16,000 British pounds. In a month, if the pound is worth $1.60, then the portfolio investor can trade back to\nU.S. dollars at the new exchange rate, and have $25,600\u2014a nice profit. A portfolio investor who believes that\nthe foreign exchange rate for the pound will work in the opposite direction can also invest accordingly. Say that\nan investor expects that the pound, now worth $1.50 in U.S. currency, will decline to $1.40. Then, asFigure\n29.2(b) shows, that investor could start off with \u00a320,000 in British currency (borrowing the money if\nnecessary), convert it to $30,000 in U.S. currency, wait a month, and then convert back to approximately\n\u00a321,429 in British currency\u2014again making a nice profit. Of course, this kind of investing comes without\nguarantees, and an investor will suffer losses if the exchange rates do not move as predicted.\nFIGURE29.2A Portfolio Investor Trying to Benefit from Exchange Rate MovementsExpectations of a currency's\nfuture value can drive its demand and supply in foreign exchange markets.\nMany portfolio investment decisions are not as simple as betting that the currency's value will change in one\ndirection or the other. Instead, they involve firms trying to protect themselves from movements in exchange\nrates. Imagine you are running a U.S. firm that is exporting to France. You have signed a contract to deliver\ncertain products and will receive 1 million euros a year from now. However, you do not know how much this\ncontract will be worth in U.S. dollars, because the dollar/euro exchange rate can fluctuate in the next year. Let\u2019s\nsay you want to know for sure what the contract will be worth, and not take a risk that the euro will be worth\nless in U.S. dollars than it currently is. You canhedge, which means using a financial transaction to protect\nyourself against a risk from one of your investments (in this case, currency risk from the contract). Specifically,\nyou can sign a financial contract and pay a fee that guarantees you a certain exchange rate one year from\nnow\u2014regardless of what the market exchange rate is at that time. Now, it is possible that the euro will be worth\nmore in dollars a year from now, so your hedging contract will be unnecessary, and you will have paid a fee for\nnothing. However, if the value of the euro in dollars declines, then you are protected by the hedge. When\nparties wish to enter financial contracts like hedging, they normally rely on a financial institution or brokerage\ncompany to handle the hedging. These companies either take a fee or create a spread in the exchange rate in\norder to earn money through the service they provide.\nBoth foreign direct investment and portfolio investment involve an investor who supplies domestic currency\nand demands a foreign currency. With portfolio investment, the client purchases less than ten percent of a\ncompany. As such, business players often get involved with portfolio investment with a short term focus. With\nforeign direct investment the investor purchases more than ten percent of a company and the investor 700 29 \u2022 Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows\ntypically assumes some managerial responsibility. Thus, foreign direct investment tends to have a more long-\nrun focus. As a practical matter, an investor can withdraw portfolio investments from a country much more\nquickly than foreign direct investments. A U.S. portfolio investor who wants to buy or sell U.K. government\nbonds can do so with a phone call or a few computer keyboard clicks. However, a U.S. firm that wants to buy or\nsell a company, such as one that manufactures automobile parts in the United Kingdom, will find that planning\nand carrying out the transaction takes a few weeks, even months.Table 29.2summarizes the main categories\nof currency demanders and suppliers.\nDemand for the U.S. Dollar Comes from\u2026 Supply of the U.S. Dollar Comes from\u2026\nA U.S. exporting firm that earned foreign A foreign firm that has sold imported goods in the United States,\ncurrency and is trying to pay U.S.-based earned U.S. dollars, and is trying to pay expenses incurred in its\nexpenses home country\nForeign tourists visiting the United States U.S. tourists leaving to visit other countries\nForeign investors who wish to make direct U.S. investors who want to make foreign direct investments in other\ninvestments in the U.S. economy countries\nForeign investors who wish to make U.S. investors who want to make portfolio investments in other\nportfolio investments in the U.S. economy countries\nTABLE29.2The Demand and Supply Line-ups in Foreign Exchange Markets\nParticipants in the Exchange Rate Market\nThe foreign exchange market does not involve the ultimate suppliers and demanders of foreign exchange\nliterally seeking each other. If Martina decides to leave her home in Venezuela and take a trip in the United\nStates, she does not need to find a U.S. citizen who is planning to take a vacation in Venezuela and arrange a\nperson-to-person currency trade. Instead, the foreign exchange market works through financial institutions,\nand it operates on several levels.\nMost people and firms who are exchanging a substantial quantity of currency go to a bank, and most banks\nprovide foreign exchange as a service to customers. These banks (and a few other firms), known asdealers,\nthen trade the foreign exchange. This is called theinterbank market.\nIn the world economy, roughly 2,000 firms are foreign exchange dealers. The U.S. economy has less than 100\nforeign exchange dealers, but the largest 12 or so dealers carry out more than half the total transactions. The\nforeign exchange market has no central location, but the major dealers keep a close watch on each other at all\ntimes.\nThe foreign exchange market is huge not because of the demands of tourists, firms, or even foreign direct\ninvestment, but instead because of portfolio investment and the actions of interlocking foreign exchange\ndealers. International tourism is a very large industry, involving about $1 trillion per year. Global exports are\nabout 23.5% of global GDP or about $19 trillion per year. Foreign direct investment totaled about $870 billion\nin the end of 2021. These quantities are dwarfed, however, by the $6.6 trillionper daytraded in foreign\nexchange markets. Most transactions in the foreign exchange market are for portfolio investment\u2014relatively\nshort-term movements of financial capital between currencies\u2014and because of the large foreign exchange\ndealers' actions as they constantly buy and sell with each other.\nStrengthening and Weakening Currency\nWhen the prices of most goods and services change, the price \"rises or \"falls\". For exchange rates, the\nterminology is different. When the exchange rate for a currency rises, so that the currency exchanges for more\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.1 \u2022 How the Foreign Exchange Market Works 701\nof other currencies, we refer to it asappreciatingor \u201cstrengthening.\u201d When the exchange rate for a currency\nfalls, so that a currency trades for less of other currencies, we refer to it asdepreciatingor \u201cweakening.\u201d\nTo illustrate the use of these terms, consider the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar\nsince 1980, inFigure 29.3(a). The vertical axis inFigure 29.3(a) shows the price of $1 in U.S. currency,\nmeasured in terms of Canadian currency. Clearly, exchange rates can move up and down substantially. A U.S.\ndollar traded for $1.17 Canadian in 1980. The U.S. dollar appreciated or strengthened to $1.39 Canadian in\n1986, depreciated or weakened to $1.15 Canadian in 1991, and then appreciated or strengthened to $1.60\nCanadian by early in 2002, fell to roughly $1.20 Canadian in 2009, and then had a sharp spike up and decline\nin 2009 and 2010. In August 2022, the U.S. dollar stood at $1.28 Canadian. The units in which we measure\nexchange rates can be confusing, because we measure the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar exchange using a\ndifferent currency\u2014the Canadian dollar. However, exchange rates always measure the price of one unit of\ncurrency by using a different currency.\nFIGURE29.3Strengthen or Appreciate vs. Weaken or DepreciateExchange rates tend to fluctuate substantially,\neven between bordering companies such as the United States and Canada. By looking closely at the time values (the\nyears vary slightly on these graphs), it is clear that the values in part (a) are a mirror image of part (b), which\ndemonstrates that the depreciation of one currency correlates to the appreciation of the other and vice versa. This\nmeans that when comparing the exchange rates between two countries (in this case, the United States and Canada),\nthe depreciation (or weakening) of one country (the U.S. dollar for this example) indicates the appreciation (or 702 29 \u2022 Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows\nstrengthening) of the other currency (which in this example is the Canadian dollar). (Source:Federal Reserve\nEconomic Data (FRED)https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/EXCAUS)\nIn looking at the exchange rate between two currencies, the appreciation or strengthening of one currency\nmust mean the depreciation or weakening of the other.Figure 29.3(b) shows the exchange rate for the\nCanadian dollar, measured in terms of U.S. dollars. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar measured in Canadian\ndollars, inFigure 29.3(a), is a perfect mirror image with the Canadian dollar exchange rate measured in U.S.\ndollars, inFigure 29.3(b). A fall in the Canada $/U.S. $ ratio means a rise in the U.S. $/Canada $ ratio, and vice\nversa.\nClick to view content(https://openstax.org/books/principles-economics-3e/pages/29-1-how-the-foreign-\nexchange-market-works)\nCanadian Dollars per 1 U.S. Dollar.\nWith the price of a typical good or service, it is clear that higher prices benefit sellers and hurt buyers, while\nlower prices benefit buyers and hurt sellers. In the case of exchange rates, where the buyers and sellers are not\nalways intuitively obvious, it is useful to trace how a stronger or weaker currency will affect different market\nparticipants. Consider, for example, the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on six different groups of economic\nactors, asFigure 29.4shows: (1) U.S. exporters selling abroad; (2) foreign exporters (that is, firms selling\nimports in the U.S. economy); (3) U.S. tourists abroad; (4) foreign tourists visiting the United States; (5) U.S.\ninvestors (either foreign direct investment or portfolio investment) considering opportunities in other\ncountries; (6) and foreign investors considering opportunities in the U.S. economy.\nFIGURE29.4How Do Exchange Rate Movements Affect Each Group?Exchange rate movements affect exporters,\ntourists, and international investors in different ways.\nFor a U.S. firm selling abroad, a stronger U.S. dollar is a curse. A strong U.S. dollar means that foreign\ncurrencies are correspondingly weak. When this exporting firm earns foreign currencies through its export\nsales, and then converts them back to U.S. dollars to pay workers, suppliers, and investors, the stronger dollar\nmeans that the foreign currency buys fewer U.S. dollars than if the currency had not strengthened, and that the\nfirm\u2019s profits (as measured in dollars) fall. As a result, the firm may choose to reduce its exports, or it may raise\nits selling price, which will also tend to reduce its exports. In this way, a stronger currency reduces a country\u2019s\nexports.\nConversely, for a foreign firm selling in the U.S. economy, a stronger dollar is a blessing. Each dollar earned\nthrough export sales, when traded back into the exporting firm's home currency, will now buy more home\ncurrency than expected before the dollar had strengthened. As a result, the stronger dollar means that the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.1 \u2022 How the Foreign Exchange Market Works 703\nimporting firm will earn higher profits than expected. The firm will seek to expand its sales in the U.S.\neconomy, or it may reduce prices, which will also lead to expanded sales. In this way, a stronger U.S. dollar\nmeans that consumers will purchase more from foreign producers, expanding the country\u2019s level of imports.\nFor a U.S. tourist abroad, who is exchanging U.S. dollars for foreign currency as necessary, a stronger U.S.\ndollar is a benefit. The tourist receives more foreign currency for each U.S. dollar, and consequently the cost of\nthe trip in U.S. dollars is lower. When a country\u2019s currency is strong, it is a good time for citizens of that country\nto tour abroad. Imagine a U.S. tourist who has saved up $5,000 for a trip to South Africa. In February 2018, $1\nbought 11.9 South African rand, so the tourist had 59,500 rand to spend. By 2018, $1 bought 14.5 rand, which\nfor the tourist translates to 72,500 rand. For foreign visitors to the United States, the opposite pattern holds\ntrue. A relatively stronger U.S. dollar means that their own currencies are relatively weaker, so that as they shift\nfrom their own currency to U.S. dollars, they have fewer U.S. dollars than previously. When a country\u2019s\ncurrency is strong, it is not an especially good time for foreign tourists to visit.\nA stronger dollar injures the prospects of a U.S. financial investor who has already invested money in another\ncountry. A U.S. financial investor abroad must first convert U.S. dollars to a foreign currency, invest in a foreign\ncountry, and then later convert that foreign currency back to U.S. dollars. If in the meantime the U.S. dollar\nbecomes stronger and the foreign currency becomes weaker, then when the investor converts back to U.S.\ndollars, the rate of return on that investment will be less than originally expected at the time it was made.\nHowever, a stronger U.S. dollar boosts the returns of a foreign investor putting money into a U.S. investment.\nThat foreign investor converts from the home currency to U.S. dollars and seeks a U.S. investment, while later\nplanning to switch back to the home currency. If, in the meantime, the dollar grows stronger, then when the\ntime comes to convert from U.S. dollars back to the foreign currency, the investor will receive more foreign\ncurrency than expected at the time the original investment was made.\nThe preceding paragraphs all focus on the case where the U.S. dollar becomes stronger. The first column in\nFigure 29.4illustrates the corresponding happy or unhappy economic reactions. The following Work It Out\nfeature centers the analysis on the opposite: a weaker dollar.\nWORK IT OUT\nEffects of a Weaker Dollar\nLet\u2019s work through the effects of a weaker dollar on a U.S. exporter, a foreign exporter into the United States, a\nU.S. tourist going abroad, a foreign tourist coming to the United States, a U.S. investor abroad, and a foreign\ninvestor in the United States.\nStep 1. Note that the demand for U.S. exports is a function of the price of those exports, which depends on the\ndollar price of those goods and the exchange rate of the dollar in terms of foreign currency. For example, a Ford\npickup truck costs $25,000 in the United States. When it is sold in the United Kingdom, the price is $25,000 /\n$1.30 per British pound, or \u00a319,231. The dollar affects the price foreigners face who may purchase U.S. exports.\nStep 2. Consider that, if the dollar weakens, the pound rises in value. If the pound rises to $2.00 per pound, then\nthe price of a Ford pickup is now $25,000 / $2.00 = \u00a312,500. A weaker dollar means the foreign currency buys\nmore dollars, which means that U.S. exports appear less expensive.\nStep 3. Summarize that a weaker U.S. dollar leads to an increase in U.S. exports. For a foreign exporter, the\noutcome is just the opposite.\nStep 4. Suppose a brewery in England is interested in selling its Bass Ale to a grocery store in the United States.\nIf the price of a six pack of Bass Ale is \u00a36.00 and the exchange rate is $1.30 per British pound, the price for the\ngrocery store is 6.00 \u00d7 $1.30 = $7.80 per six pack. If the dollar weakens to $2.00 per pound, the price of Bass\nAle is now 6.00 \u00d7 $2.00 = $12. 704 29 \u2022 Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows\nStep 5. Summarize that, from the perspective of U.S. purchasers, a weaker dollar means that foreign currency is\nmore expensive, which means that foreign goods are more expensive also. This leads to a decrease in U.S.\nimports, which is bad for the foreign exporter.\nStep 6. Consider U.S. tourists going abroad. They face the same situation as a U.S. importer\u2014they are purchasing\na foreign trip. A weaker dollar means that their trip will cost more, since a given expenditure of foreign currency\n(e.g., hotel bill) will take more dollars. The result is that the tourist may not stay as long abroad, and some may\nchoose not to travel at all.\nStep 7. Consider that, for the foreign tourist to the United States, a weaker dollar is a boon. It means their\ncurrency goes further, so the cost of a trip to the United States will be less. Foreigners may choose to take longer\ntrips to the United States, and more foreign tourists may decide to take U.S. trips.\nStep 8. Note that a U.S. investor abroad faces the same situation as a U.S. importer\u2014they are purchasing a\nforeign asset. A U.S. investor will see a weaker dollar as an increase in the \u201cprice\u201d of investment, since the same\nnumber of dollars will buy less foreign currency and thus less foreign assets. This should decrease the amount of\nU.S. investment abroad.\nStep 9. Note also that foreign investors in the Unites States will have the opposite experience. Since foreign\ncurrency buys more dollars, they will likely invest in more U.S. assets.\nAt this point, you should have a good sense of the major players in the foreign exchange market: firms involved\nin international trade, tourists, international financial investors, banks, and foreign exchange dealers. The next\nmodule shows how players can use the tools of demand and supply in foreign exchange markets to explain the\nunderlying causes of stronger and weaker currencies (we address \u201cstronger\u201d and \u201cweaker\u201d more in the\nfollowing Clear It Up feature).\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhy is a stronger currency not necessarily better?\nOne common misunderstanding about exchange rates is that a \u201cstronger\u201d or \u201cappreciating\u201d currency must be better\nthan a \u201cweaker\u201d or \u201cdepreciating\u201d currency. After all, is it not obvious that \u201cstrong\u201d is better than \u201cweak\u201d? Do not let\nthe terminology confuse you. When a currency becomes stronger, so that it purchases more of other currencies, it\nbenefits some in the economy and injures others. Stronger currency is not necessarily better, it is just different.\n29.2Demand and Supply Shifts in Foreign Exchange Markets\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain supply and demand for exchange rates\n\u2022 Define arbitrage\n\u2022 Explain purchasing power parity's importance when comparing countries.\nThe foreign exchange market involves firms, households, and investors who demand and supply currencies\ncoming together through their banks and the key foreign exchange dealers.Figure 29.5(a) offers an example\nfor the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican peso. The vertical axis shows the exchange rate\nfor U.S. dollars, which in this case is measured in pesos. The horizontal axis shows the quantity of U.S. dollars\ntraded in the foreign exchange market each day. The demand curve (D) for U.S. dollars intersects with the\nsupply curve (S) of U.S. dollars at the equilibrium point (E), which is an exchange rate of 10 pesos per dollar\nand a total volume of $8.5 billion.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.2 \u2022 Demand and Supply Shifts in Foreign Exchange Markets 705\nFIGURE29.5Demand and Supply for the U.S. Dollar and Mexican Peso Exchange Rate(a) The quantity measured\non the horizontal axis is in U.S. dollars, and the exchange rate on the vertical axis is the price of U.S. dollars\nmeasured in Mexican pesos. (b) The quantity measured on the horizontal axis is in Mexican pesos, while the price on\nthe vertical axis is the price of pesos measured in U.S. dollars. In both graphs, the equilibrium exchange rate occurs\nat point E, at the intersection of the demand curve (D) and the supply curve (S).\nFigure 29.5(b) presents the same demand and supply information from the perspective of the Mexican peso.\nThe vertical axis shows the exchange rate for Mexican pesos, which is measured in U.S. dollars. The horizontal\naxis shows the quantity of Mexican pesos traded in the foreign exchange market. Thedemand curve(D) for\nMexican pesos intersects with thesupply curve(S) of Mexican pesos at the equilibrium point (E), which is an\nexchange rate of 10 cents in U.S. currency for each Mexican peso and a total volume of 85 billion pesos. Note\nthat the two exchange rates are inverses: 10 pesos per dollar is the same as 10 cents per peso (or $0.10 per\npeso). In the actual foreign exchange market, almost all of the trading for Mexican pesos is for U.S. dollars.\nWhat factors would cause the demand or supply to shift, thus leading to a change in theequilibrium exchange\nrate? We discuss the answer to this question in the following section.\nExpectations about Future Exchange Rates\nOne reason to demand a currency on the foreign exchange market is the belief that the currency's value is\nabout to increase. One reason to supply a currency\u2014that is, sell it on the foreign exchange market\u2014is the\nexpectation that the currency's value is about to decline. For example, imagine that a leading business\nnewspaper, like theWall Street Journalor theFinancial Times, runs an article predicting that the Mexican peso\nwill appreciate in value.Figure 29.6illustrates the likely effects of such an article. Demand for the Mexican\npeso shifts to the right, from D to D , as investors become eager to purchase pesos. Conversely, the supply of\n0 1\npesos shifts to the left, from S to S , because investors will be less willing to give them up. The result is that the\n0 1\nequilibrium exchange rate rises from 10 cents/peso to 12 cents/peso and the equilibrium exchange rate rises\nfrom 85 billion to 90 billion pesos as the equilibrium moves from E to E .\n0 1 706 29 \u2022 Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows\nFIGURE29.6Exchange Rate Market for Mexican Peso Reacts to Expectations about Future Exchange RatesAn\nannouncement that the peso exchange rate is likely to strengthen in the future will lead to greater demand for the\npeso in the present from investors who wish to benefit from the appreciation. Similarly, it will make investors less\nlikely to supply pesos to the foreign exchange market. Both the shift of demand to the right and the shift of supply to\nthe left cause an immediate appreciation in the exchange rate.\nFigure 29.6also illustrates some peculiar traits of supply and demand diagrams in the foreign exchange\nmarket. In contrast to all the other cases of supply and demand you have considered, in theforeign exchange\nmarket, supply and demand typically both move at the same time. Groups of participants in the foreign\nexchange market like firms and investors include some who are buyers and some who are sellers. An\nexpectation of a future shift in the exchange rate affects both buyers and sellers\u2014that is, it affects both demand\nand supply for a currency.\nThe shifts in demand and supply curves both cause the exchange rate to shift in the same direction. In this\nexample, they both make the peso exchange rate stronger. However, the shifts in demand and supply work in\nopposing directions on the quantity traded. In this example, the rising demand for pesos is causing the\nquantity to rise while the falling supply of pesos is causing quantity to fall. In this specific example, the result is\na higher quantity. However, in other cases, the result could be that quantity remains unchanged or declines.\nThis example also helps to explain why exchange rates often move quite substantially in a short period of a few\nweeks or months. When investors expect a country\u2019s currency to strengthen in the future, they buy the\ncurrency and cause it to appreciate immediately. The currency's appreciation can lead other investors to\nbelieve that future appreciation is likely\u2014and thus lead to even further appreciation. Similarly, a fear that a\ncurrencymightweaken quickly leads to anactualweakening of the currency, which often reinforces the belief\nthat the currency will weaken further. Thus, beliefs about the future path of exchange rates can be self-\nreinforcing, at least for a time, and a large share of the trading in foreign exchange markets involves dealers\ntrying to outguess each other on what direction exchange rates will move next.\nDifferences across Countries in Rates of Return\nThe motivation for investment, whether domestic or foreign, is to earn a return. If rates of return in a country\nlook relatively high, then that country will tend to attract funds from abroad. Conversely, if rates of return in a\ncountry look relatively low, then funds will tend to flee to other economies. Changes in the expected rate of\nreturn will shift demand and supply for a currency. For example, imagine that interest rates rise in the United\nStates as compared with Mexico. Thus, financial investments in the United States promise a higher return than\npreviously. As a result, more investors will demand U.S. dollars so that they can buy interest-bearing assets\nand fewer investors will be willing to supply U.S. dollars to foreign exchange markets. Demand for the U.S.\ndollar will shift to the right, from D to D , and supply will shift to the left, from S to S , asFigure 29.7shows.\n0 1 0 1\nThe new equilibrium (E ), will occur at an exchange rate of nine pesos/dollar and the same quantity of $8.5\n1\nbillion. Thus, a higher interest rate or rate of return relative to other countries leads a nation\u2019s currency to\nappreciate or strengthen, and a lower interest rate relative to other countries leads a nation\u2019s currency to\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.2 \u2022 Demand and Supply Shifts in Foreign Exchange Markets 707\ndepreciate or weaken. Since a nation\u2019s central bank can use monetary policy to affect its interest rates, a\ncentral bank can also cause changes in exchange rates\u2014a connection that we will discuss in more detail later\nin this chapter.\nFIGURE29.7Exchange Rate Market for U.S. Dollars Reacts to Higher Interest RatesA higher rate of return for U.S.\ndollars makes holding dollars more attractive. Thus, the demand for dollars in the foreign exchange market shifts to\nthe right, from D to D , while the supply of dollars shifts to the left, from S to S . The new equilibrium (E ) has a\n0 1 0 1 1\nstronger exchange rate than the original equilibrium (E ), but in this example, the equilibrium quantity traded does\n0\nnot change.\nRelative Inflation\nIf a country experiences a relatively high inflation rate compared with other economies, then the buying power\nof its currency is eroding, which will tend to discourage anyone from wanting to acquire or to hold the\ncurrency.Figure 29.8shows an example based on an actual episode concerning the Mexican peso. In 1986\u201387,\nMexico experienced an inflation rate of over 200%. Not surprisingly, as inflation dramatically decreased the\npeso's purchasing power in Mexico. The peso's exchange rate value declined as well.Figure 29.8shows that the\ndemand for the peso on foreign exchange markets decreased from D to D , while the peso's supply increased\n0 1\nfrom S to S . The equilibrium exchange rate fell from $2.50 per peso at the original equilibrium (E ) to $0.50\n0 1 0\nper peso at the new equilibrium (E ). In this example, the quantity of pesos traded on foreign exchange\n1\nmarkets remained the same, even as the exchange rate shifted.\nFIGURE29.8Exchange Rate Markets React to Higher InflationIf a currency is experiencing relatively high inflation,\nthen its buying power is decreasing and international investors will be less eager to hold it. Thus, a rise in inflation in\nthe Mexican peso would lead demand to shift from D to D , and supply to increase from S to S . Both movements\n0 1 0 1 708 29 \u2022 Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows\nin demand and supply would cause the currency to depreciate. Here, we draw no effect on the quantity traded, but\nin truth it could be an increase or a decrease, depending on the actual movements of demand and supply.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/bigmac)to learn about the Big Mac index.\nPurchasing Power Parity\nOver the long term, exchange rates must bear some relationship to the currency's buying power in terms of\ninternationally traded goods. If at a certain exchange rate it was much cheaper to buy internationally traded\ngoods\u2014such as oil, steel, computers, and cars\u2014in one country than in another country, businesses would start\nbuying in the cheap country, selling in other countries, and pocketing the profits.\nFor example, if a U.S. dollar is worth $1.30 in Canadian currency, then a car that sells for $20,000 in the United\nStates should sell for $26,000 in Canada. If the price of cars in Canada were much lower than $26,000, then at\nleast some U.S. car-buyers would convert their U.S. dollars to Canadian dollars and buy their cars in Canada. If\nthe price of cars were much higher than $26,000 in this example, then at least some Canadian buyers would\nconvert their Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars and go to the United States to purchase their cars. This is known\nasarbitrage, the process of buying and selling goods or currencies across international borders at a profit. It\nmay occur slowly, but over time, it will force prices and exchange rates to align so that the price of\ninternationally traded goods is similar in all countries.\nWe call the exchange rate that equalizes the prices of internationally traded goods across countries the\npurchasing power parity (PPP)exchange rate. A group of economists at the International Comparison\nProgram, run by the World Bank, have calculated the PPP exchange rate for all countries, based on detailed\nstudies of the prices and quantities of internationally tradable goods.\nThe purchasing power parity exchange rate has two functions. First, economists often use PPP exchange rates\nfor international comparison of GDP and other economic statistics. Imagine that you are preparing a table\nshowing the size ofGDPin many countries in several recent years, and for ease of comparison, you are\nconverting all the values into U.S. dollars. When you insert the value for Japan, you need to use a yen/dollar\nexchange rate. However, should you use the market exchange rate or the PPP exchange rate? Market exchange\nrates bounce around. In 2014, the exchange rate was 105 yen/dollar, but in late 2015 the U.S. dollar exchange\nrate versus the yen was 121 yen/dollar. For simplicity, say that Japan\u2019s GDP was \u00a5500 trillion in both 2014 and\n2015. If you use the market exchange rates, then Japan\u2019s GDP will be $4.8 trillion in 2014 (that is, \u00a5500 trillion\n/(\u00a5105/dollar)) and $4.1 trillion in 2015 (that is, \u00a5500 trillion /(\u00a5121/dollar)).\nThe misleading appearance of a changing Japanese economy occurs only because we used the market\nexchange rate, which often has short-run rises and falls. However, PPP exchange rates stay fairly constant and\nchange only modestly, if at all, from year to year.\nThe second function of PPP is that exchanges rates will often get closer to it as time passes. It is true that in the\nshort and medium run, as exchange rates adjust to relative inflation rates, rates of return, and to expectations\nabout how interest rates and inflation will shift, the exchange rates will often move away from the PPP\nexchange rate for a time. However, knowing the PPP will allow you to track and predict exchange rate\nrelationships.\n29.3Macroeconomic Effects of Exchange Rates\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain how exchange rate shifting influences aggregate demand and supply\n\u2022 Explain how shifting exchange rates also can influence loans and banks\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.3 \u2022 Macroeconomic Effects of Exchange Rates 709\nAcentral bankwill be concerned about the exchange rate for multiple reasons: (1) Movements in the exchange\nrate will affect the quantity of aggregate demand in an economy; (2) frequent substantial fluctuations in the\nexchange rate can disrupt international trade and cause problems in a nation\u2019s banking system\u2013this may\ncontribute to an unsustainable balance of trade and large inflows of international financial capital, which can\nset up the economy for a deep recession if international investors decide to move their money to another\ncountry. Let\u2019s discuss these scenarios in turn.\nExchange Rates, Aggregate Demand, and Aggregate Supply\nForeign trade in goods and services typically involves incurring the costs of production in one currency while\nreceiving revenues from sales in another currency. As a result, movements in exchange rates can have a\npowerful effect on incentives to export and import, and thus onaggregate demandin the economy as a whole.\nFor example, in 1999, when the euro first became a currency, its value measured in U.S. currency was $1.16/\neuro, which dropped to a low of about $0.83/euro in 2000. By the end of 2013, the euro had risen (and the U.S.\ndollar had correspondingly weakened) to $1.37/euro. However, by the beginning of 2021, the exchange rate\nwas down to $1.12/euro. Consider the situation of a French firm that each year incurs \u20ac10 million in costs, and\nsells its products in the United States for $10 million. At a time in 1999, when this firm converted $10 million\nback to euros at the exchange rate of $1.06/euro (that is, $10 million \u00d7 [\u20ac1/$1.06]), it received \u20ac9.4 million, and\nsuffered a loss. In 2013, when this same firm converted $10 million back to euros at the exchange rate of\n$1.37/euro (that is, $10 million \u00d7 [\u20ac1 euro/$1.37]), it received approximately \u20ac7.3 million and an even larger\nloss. In the beginning of 2021, with the exchange rate back at $1.12/euro the firm would suffer a loss once\nagain. This example shows how a stronger euro discourages exports by the French firm, because it makes the\ncosts of production in the domestic currency higher relative to the sales revenues earned in another country.\nFrom the point of view of the U.S. economy, the example also shows how a weaker U.S. dollar encourages\nexports.\nSince an increase in exports results in more dollars flowing into the economy, and an increase in imports\nmeans more dollars are flowing out, it is easy to conclude that exports are \u201cgood\u201d for the economy and imports\nare \u201cbad,\u201d but this overlooks the role of exchange rates. If an American consumer buys a Japanese car for\n$20,000 instead of an American car for $30,000, it may be tempting to argue that the American economy has\nlost out. However, the Japanese company will have to convert those dollars to yen to pay its workers and\noperate its factories. Whoever buys those dollars will have to use them to purchase American goods and\nservices, so the money comes right back into the American economy. At the same time, the consumer saves\nmoney by buying a less expensive import, and can use the extra money for other purposes.\nFluctuations in Exchange Rates\nExchange rates can fluctuate a great deal in the short run. As yet one more example, the Indian rupee moved\nfrom 39 rupees/dollar in February 2008 to 51 rupees/dollar in March 2009, a decline of more than one-fourth\nin the value of the rupee on foreign exchange markets.Figure 29.9earlier showed that even two economically\ndeveloped neighboring economies like the United States and Canada can see significant movements in\nexchange rates over a few years. For firms that depend on export sales, or firms that rely on imported inputs to\nproduction, or even purely domestic firms that compete with firms tied into international trade\u2014which in\nmany countries adds up to half or more of a nation\u2019s GDP\u2014sharp movements in exchange rates can lead to\ndramatic changes in profits and losses. A central bank may desire to keep exchange rates from moving too\nmuch as part of providing a stable business climate, where firms can focus on productivity and innovation, not\non reacting to exchange rate fluctuations.\nOne of the most economically destructive effects of exchange rate fluctuations can happen through the\nbanking system. Financial institutions measure most international loans are measured in a few large\ncurrencies, like U.S. dollars, European euros, and Japanese yen. In countries that do not use these currencies,\nbanks often borrow funds in the currencies of other countries, like U.S. dollars, but then lend in their own 710 29 \u2022 Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows\ndomestic currency. The left-hand chain of events inFigure 29.9shows how this pattern of international\nborrowing can work. A bank in Thailand borrows one million in U.S. dollars. Then the bank converts the\ndollars to its domestic currency\u2014in the case of Thailand, the currency is the baht\u2014at a rate of 40 baht/dollar.\nThe bank then lends the baht to a firm in Thailand. The business repays the loan in baht, and the bank\nconverts it back to U.S. dollars to pay off its original U.S. dollar loan.\nFIGURE29.9International BorrowingThe scenario of international borrowing that ends on the left is a success\nstory, but the scenario that ends on the right shows what happens when the exchange rate weakens.\nThis process of borrowing in a foreign currency and lending in a domestic currency can work just fine, as long\nas the exchange rate does not shift. In the scenario outlined, if the dollar strengthens and the baht weakens, a\nproblem arises. The right-hand chain of events inFigure 29.9illustrates what happens when the baht\nunexpectedly weakens from 40 baht/dollar to 50 baht/dollar. The Thai firm still repays the loan in full to the\nbank. However, because of the shift in the exchange rate, the bank cannot repay its loan in U.S. dollars. (Of\ncourse, if the exchange rate had changed in the other direction, making the Thai currency stronger, the bank\ncould have realized an unexpectedly large profit.)\nIn 1997\u20131998, countries across eastern Asia, like Thailand, Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia, experienced a\nsharp depreciation of their currencies, in some cases 50% or more. These countries had been experiencing\nsubstantial inflows offoreign investment capital, with bank lending increasing by 20% to 30% per year\nthrough the mid-1990s. When their exchange rates depreciated, the banking systems in these countries were\nbankrupt. Argentina experienced a similar chain of events in 2002. When the Argentine peso depreciated,\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.4 \u2022 Exchange Rate Policies 711\nArgentina\u2019s banks found themselves unable to pay back what they had borrowed in U.S. dollars.\nBanks play a vital role in any economy in facilitating transactions and in making loans to firms and consumers.\nWhen most of a country\u2019s largest banks becomebankruptsimultaneously, a sharp decline in aggregate\ndemand and a deep recession results. Since the main responsibilities of a central bank are to control the\nmoney supply and to ensure that the banking system is stable, a central bank must be concerned about\nwhether large and unexpected exchange rate depreciation will drive most of the country\u2019s existing banks into\nbankruptcy. For more on this concern, return to the chapter onThe International Trade and Capital Flows.\nSumming Up Public Policy and Exchange Rates\nEvery nation would prefer a stable exchange rate to facilitateinternational tradeand reduce the degree of risk\nand uncertainty in the economy. However, a nation may sometimes want a weaker exchange rate to stimulate\naggregate demand and reduce a recession, or a stronger exchange rate to fight inflation. The country must also\nbe concerned that rapid movements from a weak to a strong exchange rate may hurt its export industries,\nwhile rapid movements from a strong to a weak exchange rate can hurt its banking sector. In short, every\nchoice of an exchange rate\u2014whether it should be stronger or weaker, or fixed or changing\u2014represents\npotential tradeoffs.\n29.4Exchange Rate Policies\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Differentiate among a floating exchange rate, a soft peg, a hard peg, and a merged currency\n\u2022 Identify the tradeoffs that come with a floating exchange rate, a soft peg, a hard peg, and a merged\ncurrency\nExchange rate policies come in a range of different forms listed inFigure 29.10: let the foreign exchange\nmarket determine the exchange rate; let the market set the value of the exchange rate most of the time, but\nhave the central bank sometimes intervene to prevent fluctuations that seem too large; have the central bank\nguarantee a specific exchange rate; or share a currency with other countries. Let\u2019s discuss each type of\nexchange rate policy and its tradeoffs.\nFIGURE29.10A Spectrum of Exchange Rate PoliciesA nation may adopt one of a variety of exchange rate regimes,\nfrom floating rates in which the foreign exchange market determines the rates to pegged rates where governments\nintervene to manage the exchange rate's value, to a common currency where the nation adopts another country or\ngroup of countries' currency.\nFloating Exchange Rates\nWe refer to a policy which allows the foreign exchange market to set exchange rates as afloating exchange\nrate. The U.S. dollar is a floating exchange rate, as are the currencies of about 40% of the countries in the world\neconomy. The major concern with this policy is that exchange rates can move a great deal in a short time.\nConsider the U.S. exchange rate expressed in terms of another fairly stable currency, the Japanese yen, as\nFigure 29.11shows. On January 1, 2002, the exchange rate was 133 yen/dollar. On January 1, 2005, it was 103\nyen/dollar. On June 1, 2007, it was 122 yen/dollar, on January 1, 2012, it was 77 yen per dollar, and on March 1,\n2015, it was 120 yen per dollar. Since 2015, it has dropped again; by the end of December 2020, the exchange 712 29 \u2022 Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows\nrate stood at 103 yen per dollar. As investor sentiment swings back and forth, driving exchange rates up and\ndown, exporters, importers, and banks involved in international lending are all affected. At worst, large\nmovements in exchange rates can drive companies into bankruptcy or trigger a nationwide banking collapse.\nHowever, even in the moderate case of the yen/dollar exchange rate, these movements of roughly 30 percent\nback and forth impose stress on both economies as firms must alter their export and import plans to take the\nnew exchange rates into account. Especially in smaller countries where international trade is a relatively large\nshare of GDP, exchange rate movements can rattle their economies.\nFIGURE29.11U.S. Dollar Exchange Rate in Japanese YenEven seemingly stable exchange rates such as the\nJapanese Yen to the U.S. Dollar can vary when closely examined over time. This figure shows a relatively stable rate\nbetween 2011 and 2013. In 2013, there was a drastic depreciation of the Yen (relative to the U.S. Dollar) by about\n14% and again at the end of the year in 2014 also by about 14%. Since then, between 2016 and 2020 there was an\nappreciation of about 13% from 118 yen per dollar to 103 yen per dollar. (Source:Federal Reserve Economic Data\n(FRED)https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DEXJPUS)\nHowever, movements of floating exchange rates have advantages, too. After all, prices of goods and services\nrise and fall throughout a market economy, as demand and supply shift. If an economy experiences strong\ninflows or outflows of international financial capital, or has relatively high inflation, or if it experiences strong\nproductivity growth so that purchasing power changes relative to other economies, then it makes economic\nsense for the exchange rate to shift as well.\nFloating exchange rate advocates often argue that if government policies were more predictable and stable,\nthen inflation rates and interest rates would be more predictable and stable. Exchange rates would bounce\naround less, too. The economistMilton Friedman(1912\u20132006), for example, wrote a defense of floating\nexchange rates in 1962 in his bookCapitalism and Freedom:\nBeing in favor of floating exchange rates does not mean being in favor of unstable exchange rates.\nWhen we support a free price system [for goods and services] at home, this does not imply that we\nfavor a system in which prices fluctuate wildly up and down. What we want is a system in which prices\nare free to fluctuate but in which the forces determining them are sufficiently stable so that in fact\nprices move within moderate ranges. This is equally true in a system of floating exchange rates. The\nultimate objective is a world in which exchange rates, while free to vary, are, in fact, highly stable\nbecause basic economic policies and conditions are stable.\nAdvocates of floating exchange rates admit that, yes, exchange rates may sometimes fluctuate. They point out,\nhowever, that if a central bank focuses on preventing either high inflation or deep recession, with low and\nreasonably steady interest rates, then exchange rates will have less reason to vary.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.4 \u2022 Exchange Rate Policies 713\nUsing Soft Pegs and Hard Pegs\nWhen a government intervenes in the foreign exchange market so that the currency's exchange rate is\ndifferent from what the market would have produced, it establishes a \u201cpeg\u201d for its currency. Asoft pegis the\nname for an exchange rate policy where the government usually allows the market to set exchange rate, but in\nsome cases, especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving rapidly in one direction, the central bank will\nintervene in the market. With ahard pegexchange rate policy, the central bank sets a fixed and unchanging\nvalue for the exchange rate. A central bank can implement soft peg and hard peg policies.\nSuppose the market exchange rate for the Brazilian currency, the real, would be 35 cents/real with a daily\nquantity of 15 billion real traded in the market, as the equilibrium E inFigure 29.12(a) andFigure 29.12(b)\n0\nshow. However, Brazil's government decides that the exchange rate should be 30 cents/real, asFigure 29.12(a)\nshows. Perhaps Brazil sets this lower exchange rate to benefit its export industries. Perhaps it is an attempt to\nstimulate aggregate demand by stimulating exports. Perhaps Brazil believes that the current market exchange\nrate is higher than the long-term purchasing power parity value of the real, so it is minimizing fluctuations in\nthe real by keeping it at this lower rate. Perhaps the government set the target exchange rate sometime in the\npast, and it is now maintaining it for the sake of stability. Whatever the reason, if Brazil\u2019s central bank wishes to\nkeep the exchange rate below the market level, it must face the reality that at this weaker exchange rate of 30\ncents/real, the quantity demanded of its currency at 17 billion reals is greater than the quantity supplied of 13\nbillion reals in the foreign exchange market.\nFIGURE29.12Pegging an Exchange Rate(a) If an exchange rate is pegged below what would otherwise be the\nequilibrium, then the currency's quantity demanded will exceed the quantity supplied. (b) If an exchange rate is\npegged above what would otherwise be the equilibrium, then the currency's quantity supplied exceeds the quantity\ndemanded.\nThe Brazilian central bank could weaken its exchange rate in two ways. One approach is to use an\nexpansionary monetary policythat leads to lower interest rates. In foreign exchange markets, the lower\ninterest rates will reduce demand and increase supply of the real and lead to depreciation. Central banks do\nnot use this technique often because lowering interest rates to weaken the currency may be in conflict with the\ncountry\u2019s monetary policy goals. Alternatively, Brazil\u2019s central bank could trade directly in the foreign\nexchange market. The central bank can expand the money supply by creating reals, use the reals to purchase\nforeign currencies, and avoid selling any of its own currency. In this way, it can fill the gap betweenquantity\ndemandedandquantity suppliedof its currency.\nFigure 29.12(b) shows the opposite situation. Here, the Brazilian government desires a stronger exchange rate\nof 40 cents/real than the market rate of 35 cents/real. Perhaps Brazil desires the stronger currency to reduce\naggregate demand and to fight inflation, or perhaps Brazil believes that that current market exchange rate is 714 29 \u2022 Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows\ntemporarily lower than the long-term rate. Whatever the reason, at the higher desired exchange rate, the\nquantity supplied of 16 billion reals exceeds the quantity demanded of 14 billion reals.\nBrazil\u2019s central bank can use acontractionary monetary policyto raise interest rates, which will increase\ndemand and reduce currency supply on foreign exchange markets, and lead to an appreciation. Alternatively,\nBrazil\u2019s central bank can trade directly in the foreign exchange market. In this case, with an excess supply of its\nown currency in foreign exchange markets, the central bank must use reserves of foreign currency, like U.S.\ndollars, to demand its own currency and thus cause an appreciation of its exchange rate.\nBoth a soft peg and a hard peg policy require that the central bank intervene in the foreign exchange market.\nHowever, a hard peg policy attempts to preserve a fixed exchange rate at all times. A soft peg policy typically\nallows the exchange rate to move up and down by relatively small amounts in the short run of several months\nor a year, and to move by larger amounts over time, but seeks to avoid extreme short-term fluctuations.\nTradeoffs of Soft Pegs and Hard Pegs\nWhen a country decides to alter the market exchange rate, it faces a number of tradeoffs. If it usesmonetary\npolicyto alter the exchange rate, it then cannot at the same time use monetary policy to address issues of\ninflation or recession. If it uses direct purchases and sales of foreign currencies in exchange rates, then it must\nface the issue of how it will handle its reserves of foreign currency. Finally, a pegged exchange rate can even\ncreate additional movements of the exchange rate. For example, even the possibility of government\nintervention in exchange rate markets will lead to rumors about whether and when the government will\nintervene, and dealers in the foreign exchange market will react to those rumors. Let\u2019s consider these issues in\nturn.\nOne concern with pegged exchange rate policies is that they imply a country\u2019s monetary policy is no longer\nfocused on controlling inflation or shortening recessions, but now must also take the exchange rate into\naccount. For example, when a country pegs its exchange rate, it will sometimes face economic situations where\nit would like to have an expansionary monetary policy to fight recession\u2014but it cannot do so because that\npolicy would depreciate its exchange rate and break its hard peg. With a soft peg exchange rate policy, the\ncentral bankcan sometimes ignore the exchange rate and focus on domestic inflation or recession\u2014but in\nother cases the central bank may ignore inflation or recession and instead focus on its soft peg exchange rate.\nWith a hard peg policy, domestic monetary policy is effectively no longer determined by domestic inflation or\nunemployment, but only by what monetary policy is needed to keep the exchange rate at the hard peg.\nAnother issue arises when a central bank intervenes directly in the exchange rate market. If a central bank\nends up in a situation where it is perpetually creating and selling its own currency on foreign exchange\nmarkets, it will be buying the currency of other countries, like U.S. dollars or euros, to hold asreserves. Holding\nlarge reserves of other currencies has anopportunity cost, and central banks will not wish to boost such\nreserves without limit.\nIn addition, a central bank that causes a large increase in the supply of money is also risking an inflationary\nsurge in aggregate demand. Conversely, when a central bank wishes to buy its own currency, it can do so by\nusing its reserves of international currency like the U.S. dollar or the euro. However, if the central bank runs\nout of such reserves, it can no longer use this method to strengthen its currency. Thus, buying foreign\ncurrencies in exchange rate markets can be expensive and inflationary, while selling foreign currencies can\nwork only until a central bank runs out of reserves.\nYet another issue is that when a government pegs its exchange rate, it may unintentionally create another\nreason for additional fluctuation. With a soft peg policy, foreign exchange dealers and international investors\nreact to every rumor about how or when the central bank is likely to intervene to influence the exchange rate,\nand as they react to rumors the exchange rate will shift up and down. Thus, even though the goal of a soft peg\npolicy is to reduce short-term fluctuations of the exchange rate, the existence of the policy\u2014when anticipated\nin the foreign exchange market\u2014may sometimes increase short-term fluctuations as international investors\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.4 \u2022 Exchange Rate Policies 715\ntry to anticipate how and when the central bank will act. The following Clear It Up feature discusses the effects\nofinternational capital flows\u2014capital that flows across national boundaries as either portfolio investment or\ndirect investment.\nCLEAR IT UP\nHow do Tobin taxes control the flow of capital?\nSome countries like Chile and Malaysia have sought to reduce movements in exchange rates by limiting international\nfinancial capital inflows and outflows. The government can enact this policy either through targeted taxes or by\nregulations.\nTaxes on international capital flows are sometimes known asTobin taxes, named afterJames Tobin, the 1981\nNobel laureate in economics who proposed such a tax in a 1972 lecture. For example, a government might tax all\nforeign exchange transactions, or attempt to tax short-termportfolio investmentwhile exempting long-term foreign\ndirect investment. Countries can also use regulation to forbid certain kinds of foreign investment in the first place or\nto make it difficult for international financial investors to withdraw their funds from a country.\nThe goal of such policies is to reduce international capital flows, especially short-term portfolio flows, in the hope\nthat doing so will reduce the chance of large movements in exchange rates that can bring macroeconomic disaster.\nHowever, proposals to limitinternational financial flowshave severe practical difficulties. National governments\nimpose taxes, not international ones. If one government imposes a Tobin tax on exchange rate transactions carried\nout within its territory, a firm based someplace like the Grand Caymans, an island nation in the Caribbean well-\nknown for allowing some financial wheeling and dealing might easily operate the exchange rate market. In an\ninterconnected global economy, if goods and services are allowed to flow across national borders, then payments\nneed to flow across borders, too. It is very difficult\u2014in fact close to impossible\u2014for a nation to allow only the flows\nof payments that relate to goods and services, while clamping down or taxing other flows of financial capital. If a\nnation participates in international trade, it must also participate in international capital movements.\nFinally, countries all over the world, especially low-income countries, are crying out for foreign investment to help\ndevelop their economies. Policies that discourage international financial investment may prevent some possible\nharm, but they rule out potentially substantial economic benefits as well.\nA hard peg exchange rate policy will not allow short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate. If the government\nfirst announces a hard peg and then later changes its mind\u2014perhaps the government becomes unwilling to\nkeep interest rates high or to hold high levels of foreign exchange reserves\u2014then the result of abandoning a\nhard peg could be a dramatic shift in the exchange rate.\nIn the mid-2000s, about one-third of the countries in the world used a soft peg approach and about one-\nquarter used a hard peg approach. The general trend in the 1990s was to shift away from a soft peg approach\nin favor of either floating rates or a hard peg. The concern is that a successful soft peg policy may, for a time,\nlead to very little variation in exchange rates, so that firms and banks in the economy begin to act as if a hard\npeg exists. When the exchange rate does move, the effects are especially painful because firms and banks have\nnot planned and hedged against a possible change. Thus, the argument went, it is better either to be clear that\nthe exchange rate is always flexible, or that it is fixed, but choosing an in-between soft peg option may end up\nbeing worst of all.\nA Merged Currency\nA final approach to exchange rate policy is for a nation to choose a common currency shared with one or more\nnations is also called amerged currency. A merged currency approach eliminates foreign exchange risk\naltogether. Just as no one worries about exchange rate movements when buying and selling between New York\nand California, Europeans know that the value of the euro will be the same in Germany and France and other 716 29 \u2022 Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows\nEuropean nations that have adopted the euro.\nHowever, a merged currency also poses problems. Like a hard peg, a merged currency means that a nation has\ngiven up altogether on domestic monetary policy, and instead has put its interest rate policies in other hands.\nWhen Ecuador uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, it has no voice in whether the Federal Reserve raises or\nlowers interest rates. The European Central Bank that determines monetary policy for the euro has\nrepresentatives from all the euro nations. However, from the standpoint of, say, Portugal, there will be times\nwhen the decisions of the European Central Bank about monetary policy do not match the decisions that a\nPortuguese central bank would have made.\nThe lines between these four different exchange rate policies can blend into each other. For example, a soft peg\nexchange rate policy in which the government almost never acts to intervene in the exchange rate market will\nlook a great deal like a floating exchange rate. Conversely, a soft peg policy in which the government intervenes\noften to keep the exchange rate near a specific level will look a lot like a hard peg. A decision to merge\ncurrencies with another country is, in effect, a decision to have a permanently fixed exchange rate with those\ncountries, which is like a very hard exchange rate peg.Table 29.3summarizes the range of exchange rates\npolicy choices, with their advantages and disadvantages.\nFloating\nMerged\nSituation Exchange Soft Peg Hard Peg\nCurrency\nRates\nOften\nMaybe less in the short None, unless a\nLarge short-run fluctuations in considerable\nrun, but still large change in the fixed None\nexchange rates? in the short\nchanges over time rate\nterm\nCannot happen\nunless hard peg\nLarge long-term fluctuations in Can often Cannot\nCan often happen changes, in which\nexchange rates? happen happen\ncase substantial\nvolatility can occur\nFlexible None;\nSome power, although\nexchange nation\nconflicts may arise Very little; central\nPower of central bank to conduct rates make does not\nbetween exchange rate bank must keep\ncountercyclical monetary policy? monetary have its\npolicy and exchange rate fixed\npolicy own\ncountercyclical policy\nstronger currency\nDo not need Hold moderate reserves No need\nCosts of holding foreign exchange\nto hold that rise and fall over Hold large reserves to hold\nreserves?\nreserves time reserves\nRisk of ending up with an\nMay end up over time\nexchange rate that causes a large Adjusts over the medium\neither far above or Cannot\ntrade imbalance and very high Adjusts often term, if not the short\nbelow the market adjust\ninflows or outflows of financial term\nlevel\ncapital?\nTABLE29.3Tradeoffs of Exchange Rate Policies\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.4 \u2022 Exchange Rate Policies 717\nGlobal macroeconomics would be easier if the whole world had one currency and one central bank. The\nexchange rates between different currencies complicate the picture. If financial markets solely set exchange\nrates, they fluctuate substantially as short-term portfolio investors try to anticipate tomorrow\u2019s news. If the\ngovernment attempts to intervene in exchange rate markets through soft pegs or hard pegs, it gives up at least\nsome of the power to use monetary policy to focus on domestic inflations and recessions, and it risks causing\neven greater fluctuations in foreign exchange markets.\nThere is no consensus among economists about which exchange rate policies are best: floating, soft peg, hard\npeg, or merged currencies. The choice depends both on how well a nation\u2019s central bank can implement a\nspecific exchange rate policy and on how well a nation\u2019s firms and banks can adapt to different exchange rate\npolicies. A national economy that does a fairly good job at achieving the four main economic goals of growth,\nlow inflation, low unemployment, and a sustainablebalance of tradewill probably do just fine most of the time\nwith any exchange rate policy. Conversely, no exchange rate policy is likely to save an economy that\nconsistently fails at achieving these goals. Alternatively, a merged currency applied across wide geographic\nand cultural areas carries with it its own set of problems, such as the ability for countries to conduct their own\nindependent monetary policies.\nBRING IT HOME\nIs a Stronger Dollar Good for the U.S. Economy?\nThe foreign exchange value of the dollar is a price and whether a higher price is good or bad depends on where you\nare standing: sellers benefit from higher prices and buyers are harmed. A stronger dollar is good for U.S. imports\n(and people working for U.S. importers) and U.S. investment abroad. It is also good for U.S. tourists going to other\ncountries, since their dollar goes further. However, a stronger dollar is bad for U.S. exports (and people working in\nU.S. export industries); it is bad for foreign investment in the United States (leading, for example, to higher U.S.\ninterest rates); and it is bad for foreign tourists (as well as U.S hotels, restaurants, and others in the tourist industry).\nIn short, whether the U.S. dollar is good or bad is a more complex question than you may have thought.

The\ndemand for dollars comes from those U.S. export firms seeking to convert their earnings in foreign currency\nback into U.S. dollars; foreign tourists converting their earnings in a foreign currency back into U.S. dollars;\nand foreign investors seeking to make financial investments in the U.S. economy. On the supply side of the\nforeign exchange market for the trading of U.S. dollars are foreign firms that have sold imports in the U.S.\neconomy and are seeking to convert their earnings back to their home currency; U.S. tourists abroad; and U.S.\ninvestors seeking to make financial investments in foreign economies. When currency A can buy more of\ncurrency B, then currency A has strengthened or appreciated relative to B. When currency A can buy less of\ncurrency B, then currency A has weakened or depreciated relative to B. If currency A strengthens or\nappreciates relative to currency B, then currency B must necessarily weaken or depreciate with regard to\ncurrency A. A stronger currency benefits those who are buying with that currency and injures those who are\nselling. A weaker currency injures those, like importers, who are buying with that currency and benefits those\nwho are selling with it, like exporters.\n29.2Demand and Supply Shifts in Foreign Exchange Markets\nIn the extreme short run, ranging from a few minutes to a few weeks, speculators who are trying to invest in\ncurrencies that will grow stronger, and to sell currencies that will grow weaker influence exchange rates. Such\nspeculation can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, at least for a time, where an expected appreciation leads to a\nstronger currency and vice versa. In the relatively short run, differences in rates of return influence exchange\nrate markets. Countries with relatively high real rates of return (for example, high interest rates) will tend to\nexperience stronger currencies as they attract money from abroad, while countries with relatively low rates of\nreturn will tend to experience weaker exchange rates as investors convert to other currencies.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29 \u2022 Self-Check Questions 719\nIn the medium run of a few months or a few years, inflation rates influence exchange rate markets. Countries\nwith relatively high inflation will tend to experience less demand for their currency than countries with lower\ninflation, and thus currency depreciation. Over long periods of many years, exchange rates tend to adjust\ntoward the purchasing power parity (PPP) rate, which is the exchange rate such that the prices of\ninternationally tradable goods in different countries, when converted at the PPP exchange rate to a common\ncurrency, are similar in all economies.\n29.3Macroeconomic Effects of Exchange Rates\nA central bank will be concerned about the exchange rate for several reasons. Exchange rates will affect\nimports and exports, and thus affect aggregate demand in the economy. Fluctuations in exchange rates may\ncause difficulties for many firms, but especially banks. The exchange rate may accompany unsustainable flows\nof international financial capital.\n29.4Exchange Rate Policies\nIn a floating exchange rate policy, a government determines its country\u2019s exchange rate in the foreign\nexchange market. In a soft peg exchange rate policy, the foreign exchange market usually determines a\ncountry's exchange rate, but the government sometimes intervenes to strengthen or weaken it. In a hard peg\nexchange rate policy, the government chooses an exchange rate. A central bank can intervene in exchange\nmarkets in two ways. It can raise or lower interest rates to make the currency stronger or weaker. It also can\ndirectly purchase or sell its currency in foreign exchange markets. All exchange rates policies face tradeoffs. A\nhard peg exchange rate policy will reduce exchange rate fluctuations, but means that a country must focus its\nmonetary policy on the exchange rate, not on fighting recession or controlling inflation. When a nation merges\nits currency with another nation, it gives up on nationally oriented monetary policy altogether.\nA soft peg exchange rate may create additional volatility as exchange rate markets try to anticipate when and\nhow the government will intervene. A flexible exchange rate policy allows monetary policy to focus on inflation\nand unemployment, and allows the exchange rate to change with inflation and rates of return, but also raises a\nrisk that exchange rates may sometimes make large and abrupt movements. The spectrum of exchange rate\npolicies includes: (a) a floating exchange rate, (b) a pegged exchange rate, soft or hard, and (c) a merged\ncurrency. Monetary policy can focus on a variety of goals: (a) inflation; (b) inflation or unemployment,\ndepending on which is the most dangerous obstacle; and (c) a long-term rule based policy designed to keep the\nmoney supply stable and predictable.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

Closed! Why?\nFor two weeks in October 2013, the U.S. federal government shut down. Many federal services, like the national\nparks, closed and 800,000 federal employees were furloughed. Tourists were shocked and so was the rest of the\nworld: Congress and the President could not agree on a budget. Inside the Capitol, Republicans and Democrats 724 30 \u2022 Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy\nargued about spending priorities and whether to increase the national debt limit. Each year's budget, which is over\n$3 trillion of spending, must be approved by Congress and signed by the President. Two thirds of the budget are\nentitlements and other mandatory spending which occur without congressional or presidential action once the\nprograms are established. Tied to the budget debate was the issue of increasing the debt ceiling\u2014how high the U.S.\ngovernment's national debt can be. The House of Representatives refused to sign on to the bills to fund the\ngovernment unless they included provisions to stop or change the Affordable Health Care Act (more colloquially\nknown as Obamacare). As the days progressed, the United States came very close to defaulting on its debt.\nOctober 2013 was not the first time the government shut down, and it was not the last. Several brief shutdowns\noccurred in the early 1980s, and they occurred periodically in the following years. The longest shutdown took place\nbetween December 2018 and January 2019, when funding a border wall was a core disagreement.\nWhy does the federal budget create such intense debates? What would happen if the United States actually\ndefaulted on its debt? In this chapter, we will examine the federal budget, taxation, and fiscal policy. We will also\nlook at the annual federal budget deficits and the national debt.\nAll levels of government\u2014federal, state, and local\u2014have budgets that show how much revenue the government\nexpects to receive in taxes and other income and how the government plans to spend it. Budgets, however, can\nshift dramatically within a few years, as policy decisions and unexpected events disrupt earlier tax and\nspending plans.\nIn this chapter, we revisitfiscal policy, which we first covered inWelcome to Economics!Fiscal policy is one of\ntwo policy tools for fine tuning the economy (the other is monetary policy). While policymakers at the Federal\nReserve make monetary policy, Congress and the President make fiscal policy.\nThe discussion of fiscal policy focuses on how federal government taxing and spending affects aggregate\ndemand. All government spending and taxes affect the economy, but fiscal policy focuses strictly on federal\ngovernment policies. We begin with an overview of U.S. government spending and taxes. We then discuss fiscal\npolicy from a short-run perspective; that is, how government uses tax and spending policies to address\nrecession, unemployment, and inflation; how periods of recession and growth affect government budgets; and\nthe merits of balanced budget proposals.\n30.1Government Spending\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Identify U.S. budget deficit and surplus trends over the past five decades\n\u2022 Explain the differences between the U.S. federal budget, and state and local budgets\nGovernment spending covers a range of services that the federal, state, and local governments provide. When\nthe federal government spends more money than it receives in taxes in a given year, it runs abudget deficit.\nConversely, when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in a year, it runs abudget\nsurplus. If government spending and taxes are equal, it has abalanced budget. For example, in 2020, the U.S.\ngovernment experienced its largest budget deficit ever, as the federal government spent $3.1 trillion more than\nit collected in taxes. This deficit was about 15% of the size of the U.S. GDP in 2020, making it by far the largest\nbudget deficit relative to GDP since the mammoth borrowing the government used to finance World War II. To\nput it into perspective, the previous record deficits were experienced during the Great Recession of\n2007\u20132009, when the deficit reached 9.6% of GDP.\nThis section presents an overview of government spending in the United States.\nTotal U.S. Government Spending\nFederal spending in nominal dollars (that is, dollars not adjusted for inflation) has grown by a multiple of more\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30.1 \u2022 Government Spending 725\nthan 38 over the last four decades, from $93.4 billion in 1960 to $6.8 trillion in 2020. Comparing spending over\ntime in nominal dollars is misleading because it does not take into account inflation or growth in population\nand the real economy. A more useful method of comparison is to examine government spending as a percent\nof GDP over time.\nThe top line inFigure 30.2shows the federal spending level since 1960, expressed as a share of GDP. Despite a\nwidespread sense among many Americans that the federal government has been growing steadily larger, the\ngraph shows that federal spending has hovered in a range from 18% to 22% of GDP most of the time since\n1960. For example, throughout the latter part of the 2010s, government expenditures were around 20% of GDP.\nThe other lines inFigure 30.2show the major federal spending categories: national defense, Social Security,\nhealth programs, and interest payments. From the graph, we see that national defense spending as a share of\nGDP has generally declined since the 1960s, although there were some upward bumps in the 1980s buildup\nunder President Ronald Reagan and in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. In\ncontrast, Social Security and healthcare have grown steadily as a percent of GDP. Healthcare expenditures\ninclude both payments for senior citizens (Medicare), and payments for low-income Americans (Medicaid).\nState governments also partially fund Medicaid. Interest payments are the final main category of government\nspending in Figure 30.2.\nFIGURE30.2Federal Spending, 1960\u20132020Since 1960, total federal spending has ranged from about 18% to 22%\nof GDP. It climbed above that level in 2009, quickly dropped back down to that level by 2013, and again climbed\nabove that level in 2020. The share that the government has spent on national defense has generally declined, while\nthe share it has spent on Social Security and on healthcare expenses (mainly Medicare and Medicaid) has increased.\n(Source:Economic Report of the President, 2021, Table B47, https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/erp/2021)\nEach year, the government borrows funds from U.S. citizens and foreigners to cover its budget deficits. It does\nthis by selling securities (Treasury bonds, notes, and bills)\u2014in essence borrowing from the public and\npromising to repay with interest in the future. From 1961 to 1997, the U.S. government has run budget deficits,\nand thus borrowed funds, in almost every year. It had budget surpluses from 1998 to 2001, and then returned\nto deficits.\nThe interest payments on past federal government borrowing were typically 1\u20132% of GDP in the 1960s and\n1970s but then climbed above 3% of GDP in the 1980s and stayed there until the late 1990s. The government\nwas able to repay some of its past borrowing by running surpluses from 1998 to 2001 and, with help from low\ninterest rates, the interest payments on past federal government borrowing had fallen back to 1.6% of GDP by\n2020.\nWe investigate the government borrowing and debt patterns in more detail later in this chapter, but first we 726 30 \u2022 Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy\nneed to clarify the difference between the deficit and the debt.The deficit is not the debt. The difference\nbetween the deficit and the debt lies in the time frame. The government deficit (or surplus) refers to what\nhappens with the federal government budget each year. The government debt is accumulated over time. It is\nthe sum of all past deficits and surpluses. If you borrow $10,000 per year for each of the four years of college,\nyou might say that your annual deficit was $10,000, but your accumulated debt over the four years is $40,000.\nThese four categories\u2014national defense, Social Security, healthcare, and interest payments\u2014generally account\nfor roughly 60% of all federal spending, asFigure 30.3shows. (Due to the large amount of one-time\nexpenditures by the federal government in 2020 due to the pandemic, the 2019 statistics are presented here.)\nThe remaining 40% wedge of the pie chart covers all other categories of federal government spending:\ninternational affairs; science and technology; natural resources and the environment; transportation; housing;\neducation; income support for people in poverty; community and regional development; law enforcement and\nthe judicial system; and the administrative costs of running the government.\nFIGURE30.3Slices of Federal Spending, 2019About 60% of government spending goes to four major areas:\nnational defense, Social Security, healthcare, and interest payments on past borrowing. This leaves about 40% of\nfederal spending for all other functions of the U.S. government. (Source: https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/\nHistoricals/)\nState and Local Government Spending\nAlthough federal government spending often gets most of the media attention, state and local government\nspending is also substantial\u2014at about $3.3 trillion in 2021.Figure 30.4shows that state and local government\nspending has increased during the last four decades from around 8% to around 14% today. The single biggest\nitem is education, which accounts for about one-third of the total. The rest covers programs like highways,\nlibraries, hospitals and healthcare, parks, and police and fire protection. Unlike the federal government, all\nstates (except Vermont) have balanced budget laws, which means any gaps between revenues and spending\nmust be closed by higher taxes, lower spending, drawing down their previous savings, or some combination of\nall of these.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30.2 \u2022 Taxation 727\nFIGURE30.4State and Local Spending, 1960\u20132020Spending by state and local government increased from about\n10% of GDP in the early 1960s to 14\u201316% by the mid-1970s. It has remained at roughly that level since. The single\nbiggest spending item is education, including both K\u201312 spending and support for public colleges and universities,\nwhich has been about 4\u20135% of GDP in recent decades. Source: (Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis,\nhttps://apps.bea.gov/iTable/index_nipa.cfm.)\nU.S. presidential candidates often run for office pledging to improve the public schools or to get tough on\ncrime. However, in the U.S. government system, these tasks are primarily state and local government\nresponsibilities. In fiscal year 2020 state and local governments spent about $970 billion per year on education\n(including K\u201312 and college and university education), compared to only $100 billion by the federal\ngovernment. In other words, about 90 cents of every dollar spent on education happens at the state and local\nlevel. A politician who really wants hands-on responsibility for reforming education or reducing crime might\ndo better to run for mayor of a large city or for state governor rather than for president of the United States.\nTaxes are paid by most, but not all, people who work.

What percentage the government collects and for what it uses that revenue varies\ngreatly. The following sections will briefly explain the taxation system in the United States.\nTaxes are paid by most, but not all, people who work.

Taxes fund vital public services that support our communities. 728 30 \u2022 Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy\nFederal Taxes\nJust as many Americans erroneously think that federal spending has grown considerably, many also believe\nthat taxes have increased substantially. The top line ofFigure 30.5shows total federal taxes as a share of GDP\nsince 1960. Although the line rises and falls, it typically remains within the range of 17% to 20% of GDP, except\nfor 2009\u20132011, when taxes fell substantially below this level, due to the Great Recession.\nFIGURE30.5Federal Taxes, 1960\u20132020Federal tax revenues have been about 17\u201320% of GDP during most\nperiods in recent decades. The primary sources of federal taxes are individual income taxes and the payroll taxes\nthat finance Social Security and Medicare. Corporate income taxes and social insurance taxes provide smaller\nshares of revenue. (Source:Economic Report of the President, 2021. Table B-47, https://www.govinfo.gov/app/\ncollection/erp/2021)\nFigure 30.5also shows the taxation patterns for the main categories that the federal government taxes:\nindividual income taxes, corporate income taxes, and social insurance and retirement receipts. When most\npeople think of federal government taxes, the first tax that comes to mind is theindividual income taxthat is\ndue every year on April 15 (or the first business day after). The personal income tax is the largest single source\nof federal government revenue, but it still represents less than half of federal tax revenue.\nThe second largest source of federal revenue is thepayroll tax(captured in social insurance and retirement\nreceipts), which provides funds for Social Security and Medicare. Payroll taxes have increased steadily over\ntime. Together, the personal income tax and the payroll tax accounted for over 85% of federal tax revenues in\n2020. Although personal income tax revenues account for more total revenue than the payroll tax, nearly\nthree-quarters of households pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes.\nThe income tax is aprogressive tax, which means that the tax rates increase as a household\u2019s income\nincreases. Taxes also vary with marital status, family size, and other factors. Themarginal tax rates(the tax\ndue on all yearly income) for a single taxpayer range from 10% to 35%, depending on income, as the following\nClear It Up feature explains.\nCLEAR IT UP\nHow does the marginal rate work?\nSuppose that a single taxpayer\u2019s income is $35,000 per year. Also suppose that income from $0 to $9,075 is taxed\nat 10%, income from $9,075 to $36,900 is taxed at 15%, and, finally, income from $36,900 and beyond is taxed at\n25%. Since this person earns $35,000, their marginal tax rate is 15%.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30.2 \u2022 Taxation 729\nThe key fact here is that the federal income tax is designed so that tax rates increase as income increases, up to\na certain level. The payroll taxes that support Social Security and Medicare are designed in a different way.\nFirst, the payroll taxes for Social Security are imposed at a rate of 12.4% up to a certain wage limit, set at\n$137,700 in 2020. Medicare, on the other hand, pays for elderly healthcare, and is fixed at 2.9%, with no upper\nceiling.\nIn both cases, the employer and the employee split the payroll taxes. An employee only sees 6.2% deducted\nfrom their paycheck for Social Security, and 1.45% from Medicare. However, as economists are quick to point\nout, the employer\u2019s half of the taxes are probably passed along to the employees in the form of lower wages, so\nin reality, the worker pays all of the payroll taxes. If you are a member of the \u201cgig economy\u201d and receive a 1099\ntax statement, then you are considered an independent contractor and so you must pay the employee and\nemployer side of the payroll tax.\nWe also call the Medicare payroll tax aproportional tax; that is, a flat percentage of all wages earned. The\nSocial Security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit, but above that level it becomes aregressive\ntax, meaning that people with higher incomes pay a smaller share of their income in tax.\nThe third-largest source of federal tax revenue, asFigure 30.5shows is thecorporate income tax. The\ncommon name for corporate income is \u201cprofits.\u201d Over time, corporate income tax receipts have declined as a\nshare of GDP, from about 4% in the 1960s to an average of 1% to 2% of GDP in the past 40 years.\nThe federal government has a few other, smaller sources of revenue. It imposes anexcise tax\u2014that is, a tax on\na particular good\u2014on gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol. As a share of GDP, the amount the government collects\nfrom these taxes has stayed nearly constant over time, from about 2% of GDP in the 1960s to roughly 3% by\n2020, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The government also imposes anestate and\ngift taxon people who pass large amounts of assets to the next generation\u2014either after death or during life in\nthe form of gifts. These estate and gift taxes collected about 0.2% of GDP in 2020. By a quirk of legislation, the\ngovernment repealed the estate and gift tax in 2010, but reinstated it in 2011. Other federal taxes, which are\nalso relatively small in magnitude, include tariffs the government collects on imported goods and charges for\ninspections of goods entering the country.\nState and Local Taxes\nAt the state and local level, taxes have been rising as a share of GDP over the last few decades to match the\ngradual rise in spending, asFigure 30.6illustrates. The main revenue sources for state and local governments\nare sales taxes, property taxes, and revenue passed along from the federal government, but many state and\nlocal governments also levy personal and corporate income taxes, as well as impose a wide variety of fees and\ncharges. The specific sources of tax revenue vary widely across state and local governments. Some states rely\nmore on property taxes, some on sales taxes, some on income taxes, and some more on revenues from the\nfederal government. 730 30 \u2022 Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy\nFIGURE30.6State and Local Tax Revenue as a Share of GDP, 1960\u20132020State and local tax revenues have\nincreased to match the rise in state and local spending.

When the line is below the horizontal axis,\na budget deficit occurred. Clearly, the biggest deficits as a share of GDP during this time were incurred to\nfinance World War II. Deficits were also large during the 1930s, the 1980s, the early 1990s, 2007\u20132009 (the\nGreat Recession), and 2020 (the pandemic-induced recession).\nFIGURE30.7Pattern of Federal Budget Deficits and Surpluses, 1929\u20132020The federal government has run budget\ndeficits for decades. The budget was briefly in surplus in the late 1990s, before heading into deficit again in the first\ndecade of the 2000s\u2014and especially deep deficits in the 2007-2009 and 2020 recessions.

Thenational debtrefers to the total amount that the government has borrowed over time. In contrast,\nthe budget deficit refers to how much the government has borrowed in one particular year.Figure 30.8shows\nthe ratio of debt/GDP since 1966. Until the 1970s, the debt/GDP ratio revealed a fairly clear pattern of federal\nborrowing. The government ran up large deficits and raised the debt/GDP ratio in World War II, but from the\n1950s to the 1970s the government ran either surpluses or relatively small deficits, and so the debt/GDP ratio\ndrifted down. Large deficits in the 1980s and early 1990s caused the ratio to rise sharply. When budget\nsurpluses arrived from 1998 to 2001, the debt/GDP ratio declined substantially. The budget deficits starting in\n2002 then tugged the debt/GDP ratio higher\u2014with a big jump when the recession took hold in 2008\u20132009.\nThere was another leap in the ratio in 2020.\nFIGURE30.8Federal Debt as a Percentage of GDP, 1942\u20132014Federal debt is the sum of annual budget deficits\nand surpluses. Annual deficits do not always mean that the debt/GDP ratio is rising. During the 1960s and 1970s,\nthe government often ran small deficits, but since the debt was growing more slowly than the economy, the debt/\nGDP ratio was declining over this time. In the 2008\u20132009 recession, the debt/GDP ratio rose sharply, before leveling\noff through the later 2010s. In 2020, it rose sharply again.

Why did the deficit become so large in 2020?Figure 30.9suggests some answers. The graph\ncombines the earlier information on total federal spending and taxes in a single graph, but focuses on the\nfederal budget since 1990.\nFIGURE30.9Total Government Spending and Taxes as a Share of GDP, 1990\u20132014When government spending\nexceeds taxes, the gap is the budget deficit. When taxes exceed spending, the gap is a budget surplus. The\nrecessionary period starting in late 2007 saw higher spending and lower taxes, combining to create a large deficit in\n2009. The same thing happened in a more extreme way in 2020. (Source:Economic Report of the President, Tables\nB-46, https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/erp/2021)\nGovernment spending as a share of GDP declined steadily through the 1990s. The biggest single reason was\nthat defense spending declined from 5.2% of GDP in 1990 to 3.0% in 2000, but interest payments by the\nfederal government also fell by about 1.0% of GDP. However, federal tax collections increased substantially in\nthe later 1990s, jumping from 18.1% of GDP in 1994 to 20.8% in 2000. Powerful economic growth in the late\n1990s fueled the boom in taxes. Personal income taxes rise as income goes up; payroll taxes rise as jobs and\npayrolls go up; corporate income taxes rise as profits go up. At the same time, government spending on\ntransfer payments such as unemployment benefits, foods stamps, and welfare declined with more people\nworking.\nThis sharp increase in tax revenues and decrease in expenditures on transfer payments was largely\nunexpected even by experienced budget analysts, and so budget surpluses came as a surprise. However, in the\nearly 2000s, many of these factors started running in reverse. Tax revenues sagged, due largely to the\nrecession that started in March 2001, which reduced revenues. Congress enacted a series of tax cuts and\nPresident George W. Bush signed them into law, starting in 2001. In addition, government spending swelled\ndue to increases in defense, healthcare, education, Social Security, and support programs for those who were\nhurt by the recession and the slow growth that followed. Deficits returned. When the severe recession hit in\nlate 2007, spending climbed and tax collections fell to historically unusual levels, resulting in enormous\ndeficits.\nLonger-term U.S. budget forecasts, a decade or more into the future, predict enormous deficits. The higher\ndeficits during the 2007\u20132009 Great Recession and the 2020 pandemic-induced recession have repercussions,\nand the demographics will be challenging. The primary reason is the \u201cbaby boom\u201d\u2014the exceptionally high\nbirthrates that began in 1946, right after World War II, and lasted for about two decades. Starting in 2010, the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30.4 \u2022 Using Fiscal Policy to Fight Recession, Unemployment, and Inflation 733\nfront edge of the baby boom generation reached age 65, and in the next two decades, the proportion of\nAmericans over the age of 65 will increase substantially. During the 2020 recession, we saw another wave of\nearly retirements, and we are now in the middle of this major demographic shift. The current level of the\npayroll taxes that support Social Security and Medicare will fall well short of the projected expenses of these\nprograms, as the following Clear It Up feature shows; thus, the forecast is for increasingly large budget deficits.\nA decision to collect more revenue to support these programs or to decrease benefit levels would alter this\nlong-term forecast.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat is the long-term budget outlook for Social Security and Medicare?\nIn 1946, just one American in 13 was over age 65. By 2000, it was one in eight. By 2030, one American in five will\nbe over age 65. Two enormous U.S. federal programs focus on the elderly\u2014Social Security and Medicare. The\ngrowing numbers of elderly Americans will increase spending on these programs, as well as on Medicaid. The\ncurrent payroll tax levied on workers, which supports all of Social Security and the hospitalization insurance part of\nMedicare, will not be enough to cover the expected costs, so what are the options?\nLong-term projections from the Congressional Budget Office in 2021 are that Medicare and Social Security spending\ncombined will rise from 8.7% of GDP in 2021 to about 10.8% by 2027\u20132031. If this rise in spending occurs, without\nany corresponding rise in tax collections, then some mix of changes must occur: (1) taxes will need to increase\ndramatically; (2) other spending will need to be cut dramatically; (3) the retirement age and/or age receiving\nMedicare benefits will need to increase, or (4) the federal government will need to run extremely large budget\ndeficits.\nSome proposals suggest removing the cap on wages subject to the payroll tax, so that those with very high incomes\nwould have to pay the tax on the entire amount of their wages. Other proposals suggest moving Social Security and\nMedicare from systems in which workers pay for retirees toward programs that set up accounts where workers save\nfunds over their lifetimes and then draw out after retirement to pay for healthcare.\nThe United States is not alone in this problem. Providing the promised level of retirement and health benefits to a\ngrowing proportion of elderly with a falling proportion of workers is an even more severe problem in many European\nnations and in Japan. How to pay promised levels of benefits to the elderly will be a difficult public policy decision.\nIn the next module we shift to the use of fiscal policy to counteract business cycle fluctuations. In addition, we\nwill explore proposals requiring a balanced budget\u2014that is, for government spending and taxes to be equal\neach year.The Impacts of Government Borrowingwill also cover how fiscal policy and government borrowing\nwill affect national saving\u2014and thus affect economic growth and trade imbalances.\n30.4Using Fiscal Policy to Fight Recession, Unemployment, and Inflation\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain how expansionary fiscal policy can shift aggregate demand and influence the economy\n\u2022 Explain how contractionary fiscal policy can shift aggregate demand and influence the economy\nFiscal policy is the use of government spending and tax policy to influence the path of the economy over time.\nGraphically, we see that fiscal policy, whether through changes in spending or taxes, shifts theaggregate\ndemandoutward in the case ofexpansionary fiscal policyand inward in the case ofcontractionary fiscal\npolicy. We know from the chapter on economic growth that over time the quantity and quality of our resources\ngrow as the population and thus the labor force get larger, as businesses invest in new capital, and as\ntechnology improves. The result of this is regular shifts to the right of the aggregate supply curves, asFigure\n30.10illustrates. 734 30 \u2022 Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy\nThe original equilibrium occurs at E , the intersection of aggregate demand curve AD and aggregate supply\n0 0\ncurve SRAS , at an output level of 200 and a price level of 90. One year later,aggregate supplyhas shifted to the\n0\nright to SRAS in the process of long-term economic growth, and aggregate demand has also shifted to the\n1\nright to AD , keeping the economy operating at the new level of potential GDP. The new equilibrium (E ) is an\n1 1\noutput level of 206 and a price level of 92. One more year later, aggregate supply has again shifted to the right,\nnow to SRAS , and aggregate demand shifts right as well to AD . Now the equilibrium is E , with an output level\n2 2 2\nof 212 and a price level of 94. In short, the figure shows an economy that is growing steadily year to year,\nproducing at its potential GDP each year, with only small inflationary increases in the price level.\nFIGURE30.10A Healthy, Growing EconomyIn this well-functioning economy, each year aggregate supply and\naggregate demand shift to the right so that the economy proceeds from equilibrium E to E to E . Each year, the\n0 1 2\neconomy produces at potential GDP with only a small inflationary increase in the price level. However, if aggregate\ndemand does not smoothly shift to the right and match increases in aggregate supply, growth with deflation can\ndevelop.\nAggregate demand and aggregate supply do not always move neatly together. Think about what causes shifts in\naggregate demand over time. As aggregate supply increases, incomes tend to go up. This tends to increase\nconsumer and investment spending, shifting the aggregate demand curve to the right, but in any given period\nit may not shift the same amount as aggregate supply. What happens to government spending and taxes?\nGovernment spends to pay for the ordinary business of government- items such as national defense, social\nsecurity, and healthcare, asFigure 30.10shows. Tax revenues, in part, pay for these expenditures. The result\nmay be an increase in aggregate demand more than or less than the increase in aggregate supply. Aggregate\ndemand may fail to increase along with aggregate supply, or aggregate demand may even shift left, for a\nnumber of possible reasons: households become hesitant about consuming; firms decide against investing as\nmuch; or perhaps the demand from other countries for exports diminishes.\nFor example, investment by private firms in physical capital in the U.S. economy boomed during the late\n1990s, rising from 14.1% of GDP in 1993 to 17.2% in 2000, before falling back to 15.2% by 2002. Conversely, if\nshifts in aggregate demand run ahead of increases in aggregate supply, inflationary increases in the price level\nwill result. Business cycles of recession and recovery are the consequence of shifts in aggregate supply and\naggregate demand. As these occur, the government may choose to use fiscal policy to address the difference.\nMonetary Policy and Bank Regulationshows us that a central bank can use its powers over the banking system\nto engage in countercyclical\u2014or \u201cagainst the business cycle\u201d\u2014actions. If recession threatens, the central bank\nuses an expansionary monetary policy to increase the money supply, increase the quantity of loans, reduce\ninterest rates, and shift aggregate demand to the right. If inflation threatens, the central bank uses\ncontractionary monetary policy to reduce the money supply, reduce the quantity of loans, raise interest rates,\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30.4 \u2022 Using Fiscal Policy to Fight Recession, Unemployment, and Inflation 735\nand shift aggregate demand to the left. Fiscal policy is another macroeconomic policy tool for adjusting\naggregate demand by using either government spending or taxation policy.\nExpansionary Fiscal Policy\nExpansionary fiscal policy increases the level of aggregate demand, through either increases in government\nspending or reductions in tax rates. Expansionary policy can do this by (1) increasing consumption by raising\ndisposable income through cuts in personal income taxes or payroll taxes; (2) increasing investment spending\nby raising after-tax profits through cuts in business taxes; and (3) increasing government purchases through\nincreased federal government spending on final goods and services and raising federal grants to state and\nlocal governments to increase their expenditures on final goods and services. Contractionary fiscal policy does\nthe reverse: it decreases the level of aggregate demand by decreasing consumption, decreasing investment,\nand decreasing government spending, either through cuts in government spending or increases in taxes. The\naggregate demand/aggregate supply model is useful in judging whether expansionary or contractionary fiscal\npolicy is appropriate.\nConsider first the situation inFigure 30.11, which is similar to the U.S. economy during the 2007-2009\nrecession. The intersection of aggregate demand (AD ) and aggregate supply (SRAS ) is occurring below the\n0 0\nlevel of potential GDP as the LRAS curve indicates. At the equilibrium (E ), a recession occurs and\n0\nunemployment rises. In this case, expansionary fiscal policy using tax cuts or increases in government\nspending can shift aggregate demand to AD , closer to the full-employment level of output. In addition, the\n1\nprice level would rise back to the level P associated with potential GDP.\n1\nFIGURE30.11Expansionary Fiscal PolicyThe original equilibrium (E ) represents a recession, occurring at a\n0\nquantity of output (Y ) below potential GDP. However, a shift of aggregate demand from AD to AD , enacted\n0 0 1\nthrough an expansionary fiscal policy, can move the economy to a new equilibrium output of E at the level of\n1\npotential GDP which the LRAS curve shows. Since the economy was originally producing below potential GDP, any\ninflationary increase in the price level from P to P that results should be relatively small.\n0 1\nShould the government use tax cuts or spending increases, or a mix of the two, to carry out expansionary fiscal\npolicy? During the 2007-2009 Great Recession, the U.S. economy suffered a 3.1% cumulative loss of GDP. That\nmay not sound like much, but it\u2019s more than one year\u2019s average growth rate of GDP. Over that time frame, the\nunemployment rate doubled from 5% to 10%. The choice between whether to use tax or spending tools often\nhas a political tinge. As a general statement, conservatives and Republicans prefer to see expansionary fiscal\npolicy carried out by tax cuts, while liberals and Democrats prefer that the government implement\nexpansionary fiscal policy through spending increases. In a bipartisan effort to address the extreme situation,\nthe Obama administration and Congress passed an $830 billion expansionary policy in early 2009 involving\nboth tax cuts and increases in government spending. At the same time, however, the federal stimulus was 736 30 \u2022 Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy\npartially offset when state and local governments, whose budgets were hard hit by the recession, began cutting\ntheir spending.\nEvents were even more severe during the more recent pandemic-induced recession. In a single quarter\n(Quarter 2 of 2020), GDP fell by over 9%, or at an annualized rate of about 34%. Policymakers were quick to\nrespond with expanded unemployment insurance, aid to state and local governments (so that they didn\u2019t have\nto cut their spending like they did during the Great Recession), grants and tax breaks for small businesses, and\nperhaps most significantly, stimulus checks sent to over 100 million households, totaling thousands of dollars\neach. Since these were mostly spending measures, they were supported more by Democrats than by\nRepublicans, although both groups recognized the severity of the problem and were largely in agreement early\non. Especially during the debates over later rounds of the stimulus checks, many discussions were had over\nthe appropriate size and target of the checks. Ultimately, compromises were made and no side got exactly what\nit wanted.\nThe conflict over which policy tool to use can be frustrating to those who want to categorize economics as\n\u201cliberal\u201d or \u201cconservative,\u201d or who want to use economic models to argue against their political opponents.\nHowever, advocates of smaller government, who seek to reduce taxes and government spending can use the\nAD AS model, as well as advocates of bigger government, who seek to raise taxes and government spending.\nEconomic studies of specific taxing and spending programs can help inform decisions about whether the\ngovernment should change taxes or spending, and in what ways. Ultimately, decisions about whether to use tax\nor spending mechanisms to implement macroeconomic policy is a political decision rather than a purely\neconomic one.\nContractionary Fiscal Policy\nFiscal policy can also contribute to pushing aggregate demand beyond potential GDP in a way that leads to\ninflation. AsFigure 30.12shows, a very large budget deficit pushes up aggregate demand, so that the\nintersection of aggregate demand (AD ) and aggregate supply (SRAS ) occurs at equilibrium E , which is an\n0 0 0\noutput level above potential GDP. Economists sometimes call this an \u201coverheating economy\u201d where demand is\nso high that there is upward pressure on wages and prices, causing inflation. In this situation, contractionary\nfiscal policy involving federal spending cuts or tax increases can help to reduce the upward pressure on the\nprice level by shifting aggregate demand to the left, to AD , and causing the new equilibrium E to be at\n1 1\npotential GDP, where aggregate demand intersects the LRAS curve.\nFIGURE30.12A Contractionary Fiscal PolicyThe economy starts at the equilibrium quantity of output Y , which is\n0\nabove potential GDP. The extremely high level of aggregate demand will generate inflationary increases in the price\nlevel. A contractionary fiscal policy can shift aggregate demand down from AD to AD , leading to a new equilibrium\n0 1\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30.5 \u2022 Automatic Stabilizers 737\noutput E , which occurs at potential GDP, where AD1 intersects the LRAS curve.\n1\nAgain, the AD\u2013AS model does not dictate how the government should carry out this contractionary fiscal\npolicy. Some may prefer spending cuts; others may prefer tax increases; still others may say that it depends on\nthe specific situation. The model only argues that, in this situation, the government needs to reduce aggregate\ndemand.\n30.5Automatic Stabilizers\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Describe how the federal government can use discretionary fiscal policy to stabilize the economy\n\u2022 Identify examples of automatic stabilizers\n\u2022 Understand how a government can use standardized employment budget to identify automatic stabilizers\nIn 2020, more than 20 million people could collect unemployment insurance benefits to replace some of their\nsalaries. Federal fiscal policies includediscretionary fiscal policy, when the government passes a new law\nthat explicitly changes tax or spending levels. The 2020 stimulus checks and increases in state and local\ngovernment aid are an example. Changes in tax and spending levels can also occur automatically, due to\nautomatic stabilizers, such as unemployment insurance and food stamps, which are programs that are\nalready laws that stimulate aggregate demand in a recession and hold down aggregate demand in a potentially\ninflationary boom.\nCounterbalancing Recession and Boom\nConsider first the situation where aggregate demand has risen sharply, causing the equilibrium to occur at a\nlevel of output above potential GDP. This situation will increase inflationary pressure in the economy. The\npolicy prescription in this setting would be a dose of contractionary fiscal policy, implemented through some\ncombination of higher taxes and lower spending. To some extent,bothchanges happen automatically. On the\ntax side, a rise in aggregate demand means that workers and firms throughout the economy earn more.\nBecause taxes are based on personal income and corporate profits, a rise in aggregate demand automatically\nincreases tax payments. On the spending side, stronger aggregate demand typically means lower\nunemployment and fewer layoffs, and so there is less need for government spending on unemployment\nbenefits, welfare, Medicaid, and other programs in the social safety net.\nThe process works in reverse, too. If aggregate demand were to fall sharply so that a recession occurs, then the\nprescription would be for expansionary fiscal policy\u2014some mix of tax cuts and spending increases. The lower\nlevel of aggregate demand and higher unemployment will tend to pull down personal incomes and corporate\nprofits, an effect that will reduce the amount of taxes owed automatically. Higher unemployment and a weaker\neconomy should lead to increased government spending on unemployment benefits, welfare, and other\nsimilar domestic programs. In 2009, the stimulus package included an extension in the time allowed to collect\nunemployment insurance. In addition, the automatic stabilizers react to a weakening of aggregate demand\nwith expansionary fiscal policy and react to a strengthening of aggregate demand with contractionary fiscal\npolicy, just as the AD/AS analysis suggests.\nA combination of automatic stabilizers and discretionary fiscal policy produced the very large budget deficit in\n2020. The pandemic caused high levels of unemployment, meaning less tax-generating economic activity. The\nhigh unemployment rate triggered the automatic stabilizers that reduce taxes and increase spending, due to\nthe increased amount of unemployment insurance paid out by the federal and state governments. Most\neconomists, even those who are concerned about a possible pattern of persistently large budget deficits, are\nmuch less concerned or even quite supportive of larger budget deficits in the short run of a few years during\nand immediately after a severe recession.\nA glance back at economic history provides a second illustration of the power of automatic stabilizers. 738 30 \u2022 Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy\nRemember that the length of economic upswings between recessions has become longer in the U.S. economy\nin recent decades (as we discussed inUnemployment). The three longest economic booms of the twentieth\ncentury happened in the 1960s, the 1980s, and the 1991\u20132001 time period. One reason why the economy has\ntipped into recession less frequently in recent decades is that the size of government spending and taxes has\nincreased in the second half of the twentieth century. Thus, the automatic stabilizing effects from spending\nand taxes are now larger than they were in the first half of the twentieth century. Around 1900, for example,\nfederal spending was only about 2% of GDP. In 1929, just before the Great Depression hit, government\nspending was still just 4% of GDP. In those earlier times, the smaller size of government made automatic\nstabilizers far less powerful than in the last few decades, when government spending often hovers at 20% of\nGDP or more.\nThe Standardized Employment Deficit or Surplus\nEach year, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculates thestandardized employment\nbudget\u2014that is, what the budget deficit or surplus would be if the economy were producing at potential GDP,\nwhere people who look for work were finding jobs in a reasonable period of time and businesses were making\nnormal profits, with the result that both workers and businesses would be earning more and paying more\ntaxes. In effect, the standardized employment deficit eliminates the impact of the automatic stabilizers.Figure\n30.13compares the actual budget deficits of recent decades with the CBO\u2019s standardized deficit.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/CBO)to learn more from the Congressional Budget Office.\nFIGURE30.13Comparison of Actual Budget Deficits with the Standardized Employment DeficitWhen the economy\nis in recession, the standardized employment budget deficit is less than the actual budget deficit because the\neconomy is below potential GDP, and the automatic stabilizers are reducing taxes and increasing spending. When\nthe economy is performing extremely well, the standardized employment deficit (or surplus) is higher than the\nactual budget deficit (or surplus) because the economy is producing about potential GDP, so the automatic\nstabilizers are increasing taxes and reducing the need for government spending. (Sources:Actual and Cyclically\nAdjusted Budget Surpluses/Deficits,https://www.cbo.gov/data/budget-economic-data#8)\nNotice that in recession years, like the early 1990s, 2001, or 2009, the standardized employment deficit is\nsmaller than the actual deficit. (These data are only available up until February 2020, so they do not include\nthe effects of the pandemic.) During recessions, the automatic stabilizers tend to increase the budget deficit, so\nif the economy was instead at full employment, the deficit would be reduced. However, in the late 1990s the\nstandardized employment budget surplus was lower than the actual budget surplus. The gap between the\nstandardized budget deficit or surplus and the actual budget deficit or surplus shows the impact of the\nautomatic stabilizers. More generally, the standardized budget figures allow you to see what the budget deficit\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30.6 \u2022 Practical Problems with Discretionary Fiscal Policy 739\nwould look like with the economy held constant\u2014at its potential GDP level of output.\nAutomatic stabilizers occur quickly. Lower wages means that a lower amount of taxes is withheld from\npaychecks right away. Higher unemployment or poverty means that government spending in those areas rises\nas quickly as people apply for benefits. However, while the automatic stabilizers offset part of the shifts in\naggregate demand, they do not offset all or even most of it. Historically, automatic stabilizers on the tax and\nspending side offset about 10% of any initial movement in the level of output. This offset may not seem\nenormous, but it is still useful. Automatic stabilizers, like shock absorbers in a car, can be useful if they reduce\nthe impact of the worst bumps, even if they do not eliminate the bumps altogether.\nChild Tax Credit\nOne new form of government spending meant to support working families is an expanded Child Tax Credit\n(CTC). Under changes which took effect in 2021, qualifying families will receive the credit as a monthly\npayment directly into their bank accounts. The credit is also an expanded amount: from $2,000 per child to\n$3,600 per child under the age of 6 (less for children older than that). Introduced by President Joe Biden\u2019s\nAmerican Rescue Plan, it is hoped that the newly expanded CTC will help reduce child poverty and support\nfamilies. Because the CTC works like a grant that is automatically extended to households, the CTC is\nconsidered a new kind of fiscal policy that is related to a universal basic income policy which some have\nargued for in the past. By sending money out monthly instead of a lump sum as part of a person\u2019s tax refund,\nthe intention is to help families better manage monthly bills for things like clothes and food.\n30.6Practical Problems with Discretionary Fiscal Policy\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Understand how fiscal policy and monetary policy are interconnected\n\u2022 Explain the three lag times that often occur when solving economic problems\n\u2022 Identify the legal and political challenges of responding to an economic problem\nIn the early 1960s, many leading economists believed that the problem of the business cycle, and the swings\nbetween cyclical unemployment and inflation, were a thing of the past. On the cover of its December 31, 1965,\nissue,Timemagazine, then the premier news magazine in the United States, ran a picture ofJohn Maynard\nKeynes, and the story inside identified Keynesian theories as \u201cthe prime influence on the world\u2019s economies.\u201d\nThe article reported that policymakers have \u201cused Keynesian principles not only to avoid the violent [business]\ncycles of prewar days but to produce phenomenal economic growth and to achieve remarkably stable prices.\u201d\nThis happy consensus, however, did not last. The U.S. economy suffered one recession from December 1969 to\nNovember 1970, a deeper recession from November 1973 to March 1975, and then double-dip recessions\nfrom January to June 1980 and from July 1981 to November 1982. At various times, inflation and\nunemployment both soared. Clearly, the problems of macroeconomic policy had not been completely solved.\nAs economists began to consider what had gone wrong, they identified a number of issues that make\ndiscretionary fiscal policy more difficult than it had seemed in the rosy optimism of the mid-1960s.\nFiscal Policy and Interest Rates\nBecause fiscal policy affects the quantity that the government borrows infinancial capital markets, it not only\naffects aggregate demand\u2014it can also affect interest rates. InFigure 30.14, the original equilibrium (E ) in the\n0\nfinancial capital market occurs at a quantity of $800 billion and an interest rate of 6%. However, an increase in\ngovernment budget deficits shifts the demand for financial capital from D to D . The new equilibrium (E )\n0 1 1\noccurs at a quantity of $900 billion and an interest rate of 7%.\nA consensus estimate based on a number of studies is that an increase in budget deficits (or a fall in budget\nsurplus) by 1% of GDP will cause an increase of 0.5\u20131.0% in the long-term interest rate. 740 30 \u2022 Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy\nFIGURE30.14Fiscal Policy and Interest RatesWhen a government borrows money in the financial capital market, it\ncauses a shift in the demand for financial capital from D to D . As the equilibrium moves from E to E , the\n0 1 0 1\nequilibrium interest rate rises from 6% to 7% in this example. In this way, an expansionary fiscal policy intended to\nshift aggregate demand to the right can also lead to a higher interest rate, which has the effect of shifting aggregate\ndemand back to the left.\nA problem arises here. An expansionary fiscal policy, with tax cuts or spending increases, is intended to\nincrease aggregate demand. If an expansionary fiscal policy also causes higher interest rates, then firms and\nhouseholds are discouraged from borrowing and spending (as occurs with tight monetary policy), thus\nreducing aggregate demand. Even if the direct effect of expansionary fiscal policy on increasing demand is not\ntotally offset by lower aggregate demand from higher interest rates, fiscal policy can end up less powerful than\nwas originally expected. We refer to this ascrowding out, where government borrowing and spending results\nin higher interest rates, which reduces business investment and household consumption.\nThe broader lesson is that the government must coordinate fiscal and monetary policy. If expansionary fiscal\npolicy is to work well, then the central bank can also reduce or keep short-term interest rates low. Conversely,\nmonetary policy can also help to ensure that contractionary fiscal policy does not lead to a recession.\nLong and Variable Time Lags\nThe government can change monetary policy several times each year, but it takes much longer to enact fiscal\npolicy. Imagine that the economy starts to slow down. It often takes some months before the economic\nstatistics signal clearly that a downturn has started, and a few months more to confirm that it is truly a\nrecession and not just a one- or two-month blip. Economists often call the time it takes to determine that a\nrecession has occurred therecognition lag. After this lag, policymakers become aware of the problem and\npropose fiscal policy bills. The bills go into various congressional committees for hearings, negotiations, votes,\nand then, if passed, eventually for the president\u2019s signature. Many fiscal policy bills about spending or taxes\npropose changes that would start in the next budget year or would be phased in gradually over time.\nEconomists often refer to the time it takes to pass a bill as thelegislative lag. Finally, once the government\npasses the bill it takes some time to disperse the funds to the appropriate agencies to implement the programs.\nEconomists call the time it takes to start the projects theimplementation lag.\nMoreover, the exact level of fiscal policy that the government should implement is never completely clear.\nShould it increase the budget deficit by 0.5% of GDP? By 1% of GDP? By 2% of GDP? In an AD/AS diagram, it is\nstraightforward to sketch an aggregate demand curve shifting to the potential GDP level of output. In the real\nworld, we only know roughly, not precisely, the actual level of potential output, and exactly how a spending cut\nor tax increase will affect aggregate demand is always somewhat controversial. Also unknown is the state of the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30.6 \u2022 Practical Problems with Discretionary Fiscal Policy 741\neconomy at any point in time. During the early days of the Obama administration, for example, no one knew\nthe true extent of the economy's deficit. During the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the rapid collapse of the\nbanking system and automotive sector made it difficult to assess how quickly the economy was collapsing.\nThus, it can take many months or even more than a year to begin an expansionary fiscal policy after a\nrecession has started\u2014and even then, uncertainty will remain over exactly how much to expand or contract\ntaxes and spending. When politicians attempt to use countercyclical fiscal policy to fight recession or inflation,\nthey run the risk of responding to the macroeconomic situation of two or three years ago, in a way that may be\nexactly wrong for the economy at that time. George P. Schultz, a professor of economics, former Secretary of\nthe Treasury, and Director of the Office of Management and Budget, once wrote: \u201cWhile the economist is\naccustomed to the concept of lags, the politician likes instant results. The tension comes because, as I have\nseen on many occasions, the economist\u2019s lag is the politician\u2019s nightmare.\u201d\nTemporary and Permanent Fiscal Policy\nA temporary tax cut or spending increase will explicitly last only for a year or two, and then revert to its\noriginal level. A permanent tax cut or spending increase is expected to stay in place for the foreseeable future.\nThe effect of temporary and permanent fiscal policies on aggregate demand can be very different. Consider\nhow you would react if the government announced a tax cut that would last one year and then be repealed, in\ncomparison with how you would react if the government announced a permanent tax cut. Most people and\nfirms will react more strongly to a permanent policy change than a temporary one.\nThis fact creates an unavoidable difficulty for countercyclical fiscal policy. The appropriate policy may be to\nhave an expansionary fiscal policy with large budget deficits during a recession, and then a contractionary\nfiscal policy with budget surpluses when the economy is growing well. However, if both policies are explicitly\ntemporary ones, they will have a less powerful effect than a permanent policy.\nStructural Economic Change Takes Time\nWhen an economy recovers from a recession, it does not usually revert to its exact earlier shape. Instead, the\neconomy's internal structure evolves and changes and this process can take time. For example, much of the\neconomic growth of the mid-2000s was in the construction sector (especially of housing) and finance.\nHowever, when housing prices started falling in 2007 and the resulting financial crunch led into recession (as\nwe discussed inMonetary Policy and Bank Regulation), both sectors contracted. The manufacturing sector of\nthe U.S. economy has been losing jobs in recent years as well, under pressure from technological change and\nforeign competition. Many of the people who lost work from these sectors in the 2008-2009 Great Recession\nwill never return to the same jobs in the same sectors of the economy. Instead, the economy will need to grow\nin new and different directions, as the following Clear It Up feature shows. Fiscal policy can increase overall\ndemand, but the process of structural economic change\u2014the expansion of a new set of industries and the\nmovement of workers to those industries\u2014inevitably takes time.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhy do jobs vanish?\nPeople can lose jobs for a variety of reasons: because of a recession, but also because of longer-run changes in the\neconomy, such as new technology. Productivity improvements in auto manufacturing, for example, can reduce the\nnumber of workers needed, and eliminate these jobs in the long run. The internet has created jobs but also caused\njob loss, from travel agents to book store clerks. Many of these jobs may never come back. Short-run fiscal policy to\nreduce unemployment can create jobs, but it cannot replace jobs that will never return.\nThe Limitations of Fiscal Policy\nFiscal policy can help an economy that is producing below its potential GDP to expand aggregate demand so 742 30 \u2022 Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy\nthat it produces closer to potential GDP, thus lowering unemployment. However, fiscal policy cannot help an\neconomy produce at an output level above potential GDP without causing inflation At this point,\nunemployment becomes so low that workers become scarce and wages rise rapidly.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/fiscalpolicy)to read about how fiscal policies are affecting the recovery.\nPolitical Realties and Discretionary Fiscal Policy\nA final problem for discretionary fiscal policy arises out of the difficulties of explaining to politicians how\ncountercyclical fiscal policy that runs against the tide of the business cycle should work. Some politicians have\na gut-level belief that when the economy and tax revenues slow down, it is time to hunker down, pinch\npennies, and trim expenses. Countercyclical policy, however, says that when the economy has slowed, it is time\nfor the government to stimulate the economy, raising spending, and cutting taxes. This offsets the drop in the\neconomy in the other sectors. Conversely, when economic times are good and tax revenues are rolling in,\npoliticians often feel that it is time for tax cuts and new spending. However, countercyclical policy says that\nthis economic boom should be an appropriate time for keeping taxes high and restraining spending.\nPoliticians tend to prefer expansionary fiscal policy over contractionary policy. There is rarely a shortage of\nproposals for tax cuts and spending increases, especially during recessions. However, politicians are less\nwilling to hear the message that in good economic times, they should propose tax increases and spending\nlimits. In the economic upswing of the late 1990s and early 2000s, for example, the U.S. GDP grew rapidly.\nEstimates from respected government economic forecasters like the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\nand the Office of Management and Budget stated that the GDP was above potential GDP, and that\nunemployment rates were unsustainably low. However, no mainstream politician took the lead in saying that\nthe booming economic times might be an appropriate time for spending cuts or tax increases.\nDiscretionary Fiscal Policy: Summing Up\nExpansionary fiscal policy can help to end recessions and contractionary fiscal policy can help to reduce\ninflation. Given the uncertainties over interest rate effects, time lags, temporary and permanent policies, and\nunpredictable political behavior, many economists and knowledgeable policymakers had concluded by the\nmid-1990s that discretionary fiscal policy was a blunt instrument, more like a club than a scalpel. It might still\nmake sense to use it in extreme economic situations, like an especially deep or long recession. For less\nextreme situations, it was often preferable to let fiscal policy work through the automatic stabilizers and focus\non monetary policy to steer short-term countercyclical efforts.\n30.7The Question of a Balanced Budget\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Understand the arguments for and against requiring the U.S. federal budget to be balanced\n\u2022 Consider the long-run and short-run effects of a federal budget deficit\nFor many decades, going back to the 1930s, various legislators have put forward proposals to require that the\nU.S. government balance its budget every year. In 1995, a proposed constitutional amendment that would\nrequire a balanced budget passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a wide margin, and failed in the U.S.\nSenate by only a single vote. (For the balanced budget to have become an amendment to the Constitution\nwould have required a two-thirds vote by Congress and passage by three-quarters of the state legislatures.)\nMost economists view the proposals for a perpetuallybalanced budgetwith bemusement. After all, in the short\nterm, economists would expect the budget deficits and surpluses to fluctuate up and down with the economy\nand the automatic stabilizers. Economic recessions should automatically lead to larger budget deficits or\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30.7 \u2022 The Question of a Balanced Budget 743\nsmaller budget surpluses, while economic booms lead to smaller deficits or larger surpluses. A requirement\nthat the budget be balanced each and every year would prevent these automatic stabilizers from working and\nwould worsen the severity of economic fluctuations.\nSome supporters of the balanced budget amendment like to argue that, since households must balance their\nown budgets, the government should too. However, this analogy between household and government behavior\nis severely flawed. Most households do not balance their budgets every year. Some years households borrow to\nbuy houses or cars or to pay for medical expenses or college tuition. Other years they repay loans and save\nfunds in retirement accounts. After retirement, they withdraw and spend those savings. Also, the government\nis not a household for many reasons, one of which is that the government has macroeconomic responsibilities.\nThe argument ofKeynesian macroeconomic policyis that the government needs to lean against the wind,\nspending when times are hard and saving when times are good, for the sake of the overall economy.\nThere is also no particular reason to expect a government budget to be balanced in the medium term of a few\nyears. For example, a government may decide that by running large budget deficits, it can make crucial long-\nterm investments inhuman capitaland physicalinfrastructurethat will build the country's long-term\nproductivity. These decisions may work out well or poorly, but they are not always irrational. Such policies of\nongoing government budget deficits may persist for decades. As the U.S. experience from the end of World War\nII up to about 1980 shows, it is perfectly possible to run budget deficits almost every year for decades, but as\nlong as the percentage increases in debt are smaller than the percentage growth of GDP, the debt/GDP ratio will\ndecline at the same time.\nNothing in this argument is a claim that budget deficits are always a wise policy. In the short run, a\ngovernment that runs a very large budget deficit can shift aggregate demand to the right and trigger severe\ninflation. Additionally, governments may borrow for foolish or impractical reasons.The Impacts of\nGovernment Borrowingwill discuss how large budget deficits, by reducing national saving, can in certain cases\nreduce economic growth and even contribute to international financial crises. A requirement that the budget\nbe balanced in each calendar year, however, is a misguided overreaction to the fear that in some cases, budget\ndeficits can become too large.\nBRING IT HOME\nNo Yellowstone Park?\nThe 2013 federal budget shutdown illustrated the many sides to fiscal policy and the federal budget. In 2013,\nRepublicans and Democrats could not agree on which spending policies to fund and how large the government debt\nshould be. Due to the severity of the 2008-2009 recession, the fiscal stimulus, and previous policies, the federal\nbudget deficit and debt was historically high. One way to try to cut federal spending and borrowing was to refuse to\nraise the legal federal debt limit, or tie on conditions to appropriation bills to stop the Affordable Health Care Act.\nThis disagreement led to a two-week federal government shutdown and got close to the deadline where the federal\ngovernment would default on its Treasury bonds. Finally, however, a compromise emerged and the government\navoided default. This shows clearly how closely fiscal policies are tied to politics. 744 30 \u2022 Key Terms\nKey Terms\nautomatic stabilizers tax and spending rules that have the effect of slowing down the rate of decrease in\naggregate demand when the economy slows down and restraining aggregate demand when the economy\nspeeds up, without any additional change in legislation\nbalanced budgetwhen government spending and taxes are equal\nbudget deficitwhen the federal government spends more money than it receives in taxes in a given year\nbudget surpluswhen the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in a year\ncontractionary fiscal policy fiscal policy that decreases the level of aggregate demand, either through cuts in\ngovernment spending or increases in taxes\ncorporate income taxa tax imposed on corporate profits\ncrowding out federal spending and borrowing causes interest rates to rise and business investment to fall\ndiscretionary fiscal policy the government passes a new law that explicitly changes overall tax or spending\nlevels with the intent of influencing the level of overall economic activity\nestate and gift taxa tax on people who pass assets to the next generation\u2014either after death or during life in\nthe form of gifts\nexcise taxa tax on a specific good\u2014on gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol\nexpansionary fiscal policy fiscal policy that increases the level of aggregate demand, either through increases\nin government spending or cuts in taxes\nimplementation lag the time it takes for the funds relating to fiscal policy to be dispersed to the appropriate\nagencies to implement the programs\nindividual income taxa tax based on the income, of all forms, received by individuals\nlegislative lag the time it takes to get a fiscal policy bill passed\nmarginal tax rates or the tax that must be paid on all yearly income\nnational debtthe total accumulated amount the government has borrowed, over time, and not yet paid back\npayroll taxa tax based on the pay received from employers; the taxes provide funds for Social Security and\nMedicare\nprogressive taxa tax that collects a greater share of income from those with high incomes than from those\nwith lower incomes\nproportional taxa tax that is a flat percentage of income earned, regardless of level of income\nrecognition lag the time it takes to determine that a recession has occurred\nregressive taxa tax in which people with higher incomes pay a smaller share of their income in tax\nstandardized employment budget the budget deficit or surplus in any given year adjusted for what it would\nhave been if the economy were producing at potential GDP\nKey Concepts and Summary\n30.1Government Spending\nFiscal policy is the set of policies that relate to federal government spending, taxation, and borrowing. In\nrecent decades, the level of federal government spending and taxes, expressed as a share of GDP, has not\nchanged much, typically fluctuating between about 18% to 22% of GDP. However, the level of state spending\nand taxes, as a share of GDP, has risen from about 12\u201313% to about 20% of GDP over the last four decades. The\nfour main areas of federal spending are national defense, Social Security, healthcare, and interest payments,\nwhich together account for about 70% of all federal spending. When a government spends more than it collects\nin taxes, it is said to have a budget deficit. When a government collects more in taxes than it spends, it is said to\nhave a budget surplus. If government spending and taxes are equal, it is said to have a balanced budget. The\nsum of all past deficits and surpluses make up the government debt.\n30.2Taxation\nThe two main federal taxes are individual income taxes and payroll taxes that provide funds for Social Security\nand Medicare; these taxes together account for more than 80% of federal revenues. Other federal taxes include\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30 \u2022 Key Concepts and Summary 745\nthe corporate income tax, excise taxes on alcohol, gasoline and tobacco, and the estate and gift tax. A\nprogressive tax is one, like the federal income tax, where those with higher incomes pay a higher share of taxes\nout of their income than those with lower incomes. A proportional tax is one, like the payroll tax for Medicare,\nwhere everyone pays the same share of taxes regardless of income level. A regressive tax is one, like the payroll\ntax (above a certain threshold) that supports Social Security, where those with high income pay a lower share\nof income in taxes than those with lower incomes.\n30.3Federal Deficits and the National Debt\nFor most of the twentieth century, the U.S. government took on debt during wartime and then paid down that\ndebt slowly in peacetime. However, it took on quite substantial debts in peacetime in the 1980s and early\n1990s, before a brief period of budget surpluses from 1998 to 2001, followed by a return to annual budget\ndeficits since 2002, with very large deficits in the recession of 2008 and 2009. A budget deficit or budget\nsurplus is measured annually. Total government debt or national debt is the sum of budget deficits and budget\nsurpluses over time.\n30.4Using Fiscal Policy to Fight Recession, Unemployment, and Inflation\nExpansionary fiscal policy increases the level of aggregate demand, either through increases in government\nspending or through reductions in taxes. Expansionary fiscal policy is most appropriate when an economy is\nin recession and producing below its potential GDP. Contractionary fiscal policy decreases the level of\naggregate demand, either through cuts in government spending or increases in taxes. Contractionary fiscal\npolicy is most appropriate when an economy is producing above its potential GDP.\n30.5Automatic Stabilizers\nFiscal policy is conducted both through discretionary fiscal policy, which occurs when the government enacts\ntaxation or spending changes in response to economic events, or through automatic stabilizers, which are\ntaxing and spending mechanisms that, by their design, shift in response to economic events without any\nfurther legislation. The standardized employment budget is the calculation of what the budget deficit or budget\nsurplus would have been in a given year if the economy had been producing at its potential GDP in that year.\nMany economists and politicians criticize the use of fiscal policy for a variety of reasons, including concerns\nover time lags, the impact on interest rates, and the inherently political nature of fiscal policy. We cover the\ncritique of fiscal policy in the next module.\n30.6Practical Problems with Discretionary Fiscal Policy\nBecause fiscal policy affects the quantity of money that the government borrows in financial capital markets, it\nnot only affects aggregate demand\u2014it can also affect interest rates. If an expansionary fiscal policy also causes\nhigher interest rates, then firms and households are discouraged from borrowing and spending, reducing\naggregate demand in a situation called crowding out. Given the uncertainties over interest rate effects, time\nlags (implementation lag, legislative lag, and recognition lag), temporary and permanent policies, and\nunpredictable political behavior, many economists and knowledgeable policymakers have concluded that\ndiscretionary fiscal policy is a blunt instrument and better used only in extreme situations.\n30.7The Question of a Balanced Budget\nBalanced budget amendments are a popular political idea, but the economic merits behind such proposals are\nquestionable. Most economists accept that fiscal policy needs to be flexible enough to accommodate\nunforeseen expenditures, such as wars or recessions. While persistent, large budget deficits can indeed be a\nproblem, a balanced budget amendment prevents even small, temporary deficits that might, in some cases, be\nnecessary. 746 30 \u2022 Self-Check Questions\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

Johnson signed The Higher Education Act of 1965 into law. With a\nstroke of the pen, he implemented what we know as the financial aid, work study, and student loan programs to help\nAmericans pay for a college education. In his remarks, the President said:\nHere the seeds were planted from which grew my firm conviction that for the individual, education is the\npath to achievement and fulfillment; for the Nation, it is a path to a society that is not only free but civilized;\nand for the world, it is the path to peace\u2014for it is education that places reason over force.\nThis Act, he said, \"is responsible for funding higher education for millions of Americans. It is the embodiment of the\nUnited States\u2019 investment in \u2018human capital\u2019.\" Since Johnson signed the Act into law, the government has renewed it\nseveral times. 750 31 \u2022 The Impacts of Government Borrowing\nThe purpose of The Higher Education Act of 1965 was to build the country\u2019s human capital by creating educational\nopportunity for millions of Americans. The three criteria that the government uses to judge eligibility are income,\nfull-time or part-time attendance, and the cost of the institution. According to education.org, in the 2011\u20132012\nschool year, over 80% of all full-time college students received some form of federal financial aid; 43% received\ngrants; and another 41% of students aged 15\u201323 received federal government student loans. The budget to support\nfinancial aid has increased not only because of more enrollment, but also because of increased tuition and fees for\nhigher education. In 2022, the government generally took an approach of increasing student aid through programs\nsuch as Pell Grant expansion, while also taking steps to ease student loan debt.\nGovernments have many competing demands for financial support. Any spending should be tempered by\nfiscal responsibility and by looking carefully at the spending\u2019s impact. When a government spends more than\nit collects in taxes, it runs a budget deficit. It then needs to borrow. When government borrowing becomes\nespecially large and sustained, it can substantially reduce the financial capital available to private sector firms,\nas well as lead to trade imbalances and even financial crises.\nTheGovernment Budgets and Fiscal Policychapter introduced the concepts of deficits and debt, as well as how\na government could use fiscal policy to address recession or inflation. This chapter begins by building on the\nnational savings and investment identity, which we first introduced inThe International Trade and Capital\nFlowschapter, to show how government borrowing affects firms\u2019 physical capital investment levels and trade\nbalances. A prolonged period of budget deficits may lead to lower economic growth, in part because the funds\nthat the government borrows to fund its budget deficits are typically no longer available for private investment.\nMoreover, a sustained pattern of large budget deficits can lead to disruptive economic patterns of high\ninflation, substantial inflows of financial capital from abroad, plummeting exchange rates, and heavy strains\non a country\u2019s banking and financial system.\n31.1How Government Borrowing Affects Investment and the Trade Balance\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain the national saving and investment identity in terms of demand and supply\n\u2022 Evaluate the role of budget surpluses and trade surpluses in national saving and investment identity\nWhen governments are borrowers in financial markets, there are three possible sources for the funds from a\nmacroeconomic point of view: (1) households might save more; (2) private firms might borrow less; and (3) the\nadditional funds for government borrowing might come from outside the country, from foreign financial\ninvestors. Let\u2019s begin with a review of why one of these three options must occur, and then explore how interest\nrates and exchange rates adjust to these connections.\nThe National Saving and Investment Identity\nThe national saving and investment identity, which we first introduced inThe International Trade and Capital\nFlowschapter, provides a framework for showing the relationships between the sources of demand and supply\ninfinancial capital markets. The identity begins with a statement that must always hold true: the quantity of\nfinancial capitalsupplied in the market must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded.\nThe U.S. economy has two main sources for financial capital: private savings from inside the U.S. economy and\npublic savings.\nThese include the inflow of foreign financial capital from abroad. The inflow of savings from abroad is, by\ndefinition, equal to the trade deficit, as we explained inThe International Trade and Capital Flowschapter. We\ncan write this inflow of foreign investment capital as imports (M) minus exports (X). There are also two main\nsources of demand for financial capital: private sector investment (I) and government borrowing. Government\nAccess for free at openstax.org 31.1 \u2022 How Government Borrowing Affects Investment and the Trade Balance 751\nborrowing in any given year is equal to the budget deficit, which we can write as the difference between\ngovernment spending (G) and net taxes (T). Let\u2019s call this equation 1.\nGovernments often spend more than they receive in taxes and, therefore, public savings (T \u2013 G) is negative.\nThis causes a need to borrow money in the amount of (G \u2013 T) instead of adding to the nation\u2019s savings. If this is\nthe case, we can view governments as demanders of financial capital instead of suppliers. In algebraic terms,\nwe can rewrite the national savings and investment identity like this:\nLet\u2019s call this equation 2. We must accompany a change in any part of the national saving and investment\nidentity by offsetting changes in at least one other part of the equation because we assume that the equality of\nquantity supplied and quantity demanded always holds. If the government budget deficit changes, then either\nprivate saving or investment or the trade balance\u2014or some combination of the three\u2014must change as well.\nFigure 31.2shows the possible effects.\nFIGURE31.2Effects of Change in Budget Surplus or Deficit on Investment, Savings, and The Trade BalanceChart\n(a) shows the potential results when the budget deficit rises (or budget surplus falls). Chart (b) shows the potential\nresults when the budget deficit falls (or budget surplus rises).\nWhat about Budget Surpluses and Trade Surpluses?\nThe national saving and investment identity must always hold true because, by definition, the quantity\nsupplied and quantity demanded in the financial capital market must always be equal. However, the formula\nwill look somewhat different if the government budget is in deficit rather than surplus or if the balance of trade\nis insurplusrather thandeficit. For example, in 1999 and 2000, the U.S. government had budget surpluses,\nalthough the economy was still experiencing trade deficits. When the government was running budget\nsurpluses, it was acting as a saver rather than a borrower, and supplying rather than demanding financial\ncapital. As a result, we would write the national saving and investment identity during this time as:\nLet's call this equation 3. Notice that this expression is mathematically the same as equation 2 except the\nsavings and investment sides of the identity have simply flipped sides.\nDuring the 1960s, the U.S. government was often running a budget deficit, but the economy was typically\nrunning trade surpluses. Since a trade surplus means that an economy is experiencing a net outflow of 752 31 \u2022 The Impacts of Government Borrowing\nfinancial capital, we would write the national saving and investment identity as:\nInstead of the balance of trade representing part of the supply of financial capital, which occurs with a trade\ndeficit, a trade surplus represents an outflow of financial capital leaving the domestic economy and invested\nelsewhere in the world.\nWe assume that the point to these equations is that the national saving and investment identity always hold.\nWhen you write these relationships, it is important to engage your brain and think about what is on the supply\nand demand side of the financial capital market before you start your calculations.\nAs you can see inFigure 31.3, the Office of Management and Budget shows that the United States has\nconsistently run budget deficits since 1977, with the exception of 1999 and 2000. What is alarming is the\ndramatic increase in budget deficits that has occurred since 2008, which in part reflects declining tax\nrevenues and increased safety net expenditures due to the Great Recession. While deficits were controlled as\nthe economy began to recover in the mid-2010s, the budget deficit increased again in 2020 during the\npandemic, and forecasters expect deficits to remain high for the foreseeable future. (Recall that T is net taxes.\nWhen the government must transfer funds back to individuals for safety net expenditures like Social Security\nand unemployment benefits, budget deficits rise.) These deficits have implications for the future health of the\nU.S. economy.\nFIGURE31.3United States On-Budget, Surplus, and Deficit, 1952\u20132020 ($ billions)The United States has run a\nbudget deficit for over 30 years, with the exception of 1999 and 2000.

(Source: Office of Management and Budget,\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYFSGDA188S)\nA rising budget deficit may result in a fall in domestic investment, a rise in private savings, or a rise in the\ntrade deficit. The following modules discuss each of these possible effects in more detail.\n31.2Fiscal Policy and the Trade Balance\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Discuss twin deficits as they related to budget and trade deficit\n\u2022 Explain the relationship between budget deficits and exchange rates\n\u2022 Explain the relationship between budget deficits and inflation\n\u2022 Identify causes of recessions\nGovernment budget balances can affect the trade balance. AsThe Keynesian Perspectivechapter discusses, a\nnet inflow of foreign financial investment always accompanies a trade deficit, while a net outflow of financial\ninvestment always accompanies a trade surplus. One way to understand the connection from budget deficits to\ntrade deficits is that when government creates a budget deficit with some combination of tax cuts or spending\nincreases, it will increase aggregate demand in the economy, and some of that increase in aggregate demand\nwill result in a higher level of imports. A higher level of imports, with exports remaining fixed, will cause a\nlarger trade deficit. That means foreigners\u2019 holdings of dollars increase as Americans purchase more imported\ngoods. Foreigners use those dollars to invest in the United States, which leads to an inflow of foreign\ninvestment. One possible source of funding our budget deficit is foreigners buying Treasury securities that the\nU.S. government sells, thus a trade deficit often accompanies a budget deficit.\nTwin Deficits?\nIn the mid-1980s, it was common to hear economists and even newspaper articles refer to the twin deficits, as\nthe budget deficit and trade deficit both grew substantially.Figure 31.4shows the pattern. The federal budget\ndeficit went from 2.6% of GDP in 1981 to 5.1% of GDP in 1985\u2014a drop of 2.5% of GDP. Over that time, the trade\ndeficit moved from 0.5% in 1981 to 2.9% in 1985\u2014a drop of 2.4% of GDP. In the mid-1980s an inflow of foreign\ninvestment capital matched, the considerable increase in government borrowing, so the government budget\ndeficit and the trade deficit moved together.\nFIGURE31.4U.S. Budget Deficits and Trade DeficitsIn the 1980s, the budget deficit and the trade deficit declined\nat the same time. However, since then, the deficits have stopped being twins. The trade deficit grew smaller in the\nearly 1990s as the budget deficit increased, and then the trade deficit grew larger in the late 1990s as the budget 754 31 \u2022 The Impacts of Government Borrowing\ndeficit turned into a surplus. In the first half of the 2000s, both budget and trade deficits increased. However, in\n2009, the trade deficit declined as the budget deficit increased. Through the 2010s, the trade deficit remained\nrelatively stable as the budget deficit declined. While the budget deficit increased in 2020, there has been hardly\nany change in the trade deficit.\nOf course, no one should expect the budget deficit and trade deficit to move in lockstep, because the other\nparts of the national saving and investment identity\u2014investment and private savings\u2014will often change as\nwell. In the late 1990s, for example, the government budget balance turned from deficit to surplus, but the\ntrade deficit remained large and growing. During this time, the inflow of foreign financial investment was\nsupporting a surge of physical capital investment by U.S. firms. In the first half of the 2000s, the budget and\ntrade deficits again increased together, but in 2009, the budget deficit increased while the trade deficit\ndeclined. Through the 2010s, as there were bigger changes in the budget deficit, the trade deficit remained\nstable. The budget deficit and the trade deficits are related to each other, but they are more like cousins than\ntwins.\nBudget Deficits and Exchange Rates\nExchange rates can also help to explain why budget deficits are linked to trade deficits.Figure 31.5shows a\nsituation using theexchange ratefor the U.S. dollar, measured in euros. At the original equilibrium (E ), where\n0\nthe demand for U.S. dollars (D ) intersects with the supply of U.S. dollars (S ) on the foreign exchange market,\n0 0\nthe exchange rate is 0.9 euros per U.S. dollar and the equilibrium quantity traded in the market is $100 billion\nper day. Then the U.S. budget deficit rises and foreign financial investment provides the source of funds for\nthat budget deficit.\nInternational financial investors, as a group, will demand more U.S. dollars on foreign exchange markets to\npurchase the U.S. government bonds, and they will supply fewer of the U.S. dollars that they already hold in\nthese markets. Demand for U.S. dollars on the foreign exchange market shifts from D to D and the supply of\n0 1\nU.S. dollars falls from S to S . At the new equilibrium (E ), the exchange rate has appreciated to 1.05 euros per\n0 1 1\ndollar while, in this example, the quantity of dollars traded remains the same.\nFIGURE31.5Budget Deficits and Exchange RatesImagine that the U.S. government increases its borrowing and\nthe funds come from European financial investors. To purchase U.S. government bonds, those European investors\nwill need to demand more U.S. dollars on foreign exchange markets, causing the demand for U.S. dollars to shift to\nthe right from D to D . European financial investors as a group will also be less likely to supply U.S. dollars to the\n0 1\nforeign exchange markets, causing the supply of U.S. dollars to shift from S to S . The equilibrium exchange rate\n0 1\nstrengthens from 0.9 euro/ dollar at E to 1.05 euros/dollar at E .\n0 1\nA stronger exchange rate, of course, makes it more difficult for exporters to sell their goods abroad while\nmaking imports cheaper, so a trade deficit (or a reduced trade surplus) results. Thus, a budget deficit can easily\nresult in an inflow of foreign financial capital, a stronger exchange rate, and a trade deficit.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 31.2 \u2022 Fiscal Policy and the Trade Balance 755\nYou can also imagine interest rates are driving the exchange rate appreciation. As we explained earlier in\nFigure 31.8, a budget deficit increases demand in markets for domestic financial capital, raising the domestic\ninterest rate. A higher interest rate will attract an inflow of foreign financial capital, and appreciate the\nexchange rate in response to the increase in demand for U.S. dollars by foreign investors and a decrease in\nsupply of U. S. dollars. Because of higher interest rates in the United States, Americans find U.S. bonds more\nattractive than foreign bonds. When Americans are buying fewer foreign bonds, they are supplying fewer U.S.\ndollars. U.S. dollar appreciation leads to a larger trade deficit (or reduced surplus). The connections between\ninflows of foreign investment capital, interest rates, and exchange rates are all just different ways of drawing\nthe same economic connections: a larger budget deficit can result in a larger trade deficit, although do not\nexpect the connection to be one-to-one.\nFrom Budget Deficits to International Economic Crisis\nWe lay out step-by-step the economic story of how an outflow of international financial capital can cause a\ndeep recession in theExchange Rates and International Capital Flowschapter. When international financial\ninvestors decide to withdraw their funds from a country like Turkey, they increase the supply of the Turkish\nlira and reduce the demand for lira, depreciating the lira exchange rate. When firms and the government in a\ncountry like Turkey borrow money in international financial markets, they typically do so in stages. First,\nbanks in Turkey borrow in a widely used currency like U.S. dollars or euros, then convert those U.S. dollars to\nlira, and then lend the money to borrowers in Turkey. If the lira's exchange rate value depreciates, then\nTurkey\u2019s banks will find it impossible to repay the international loans that are in U.S. dollars or euros.\nThe combination of less foreign investment capital and banks that are bankrupt can sharply reduce aggregate\ndemand, which causes a deeprecession. Many countries around the world have experienced this kind of\nrecession: along with Turkey in 2002, Mexico followed this general pattern in 1995, Thailand and countries\nacross East Asia in 1997\u20131998, Russia in 1998, and Argentina in 2002. In many of these countries, large\ngovernment budget deficits played a role in setting the stage for the financial crisis. A moderate increase in a\nbudget deficit that leads to a moderate increase in a trade deficit and a moderate appreciation of the exchange\nrate is not necessarily a cause for concern. However, beyond some point that is hard to define in advance, a\nseries of large budget deficits can become a cause for concern among international investors.\nOne reason for concern is that extremely large budget deficits mean that aggregate demand may shift so far to\nthe right as to cause high inflation. The example of Turkey is a situation where very large budget deficits\nbrought inflation rates well into double digits. In addition, very large budget deficits at some point begin to\nraise a fear that the government would not repay the borrowing. In the last 100 years, the government of\nTurkey has been unable to pay its debts and defaulted on its loans four times. Over the past 175 years, Brazil\u2019s\ngovernment has been unable to pay its debts and defaulted on its loans seven times; Venezuela, nine times;\nand Argentina, five times. The risk of high inflation or a default on repaying international loans will worry\ninternational investors, since both factors imply that the rate of return on their investments in that country\nmay end up lower than expected. If international investors start withdrawing the funds from a country rapidly,\nthe scenario of less investment, a depreciated exchange rate, widespread bank failure, and deep recession can\noccur. The following Clear It Up feature explains other impacts of large deficits.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat are the risks of chronic large deficits in the United States?\nIf a government runs large budget deficits for a sustained period of time, what can go wrong? According to a recent\nBrookings Institution report, a key risk of a large budget deficit is that government debt may grow too high\ncompared to the country\u2019s GDP growth. As debt grows, the national savings rate will decline, leaving less available in\nfinancial capital for private investment. The impact of chronically large budget deficits is as follows:\n\u2022 As the population ages, there will be an increasing demand for government services that may cause higher 756 31 \u2022 The Impacts of Government Borrowing\ngovernment deficits. Government borrowing and its interest payments will pull resources away from domestic\ninvestment in human capital and physical capital that is essential to economic growth.\n\u2022 Interest rates may start to rise so that the cost of financing government debt will rise as well, creating pressure\non the government to reduce its budget deficits through spending cuts and tax increases. These steps will be\npolitically painful, and they will also have a contractionary effect on aggregate demand in the economy.\n\u2022 Rising percentage of debt to GDP will create uncertainty in the financial and global markets that might cause a\ncountry to resort to inflationary tactics to reduce the real value of the debt outstanding. This will decrease real\nwealth and damage confidence in the country\u2019s ability to manage its spending. After all, if the government has\nborrowed at a fixed interest rate of, say, 5%, and it lets inflation rise above that 5%, then it will effectively be\nable to repay its debt at a negative real interest rate.\nThe conventional reasoning suggests that the relationship between sustained deficits that lead to high levels of\ngovernment debt and long-term growth is negative. How significant this relationship is, how big an issue it is\ncompared to other macroeconomic issues, and the direction of causality, is less clear.\nWhat remains important to acknowledge is that the relationship between debt and growth is negative and that for\nsome countries, the relationship may be stronger than in others. It is also important to acknowledge the direction of\ncausality: does high debt cause slow growth, slow growth cause high debt, or are both high debt and slow growth\nthe result of third factors? In our analysis, we have argued simply that high debt causes slow growth. There may be\nmore to this debate than we have space to discuss here.\nUsing Fiscal Policy to Address Trade Imbalances\nIf a nation is experiencing the inflow of foreign investment capital associated with a trade deficit because\nforeign investors are making long-term direct investments in firms, there may be no substantial reason for\nconcern. After all, many low-income nations around the world would welcome direct investment by\nmultinational firms that ties them more closely into the global networks of production and distribution of\ngoods and services. In this case, the inflows of foreign investment capital and the trade deficit are attracted by\nthe opportunities for a good rate of return on private sector investment in an economy.\nHowever, governments should beware of a sustained pattern of high budget deficits and high trade deficits. The\ndanger arises in particular when the inflow of foreign investment capital is not funding long-term physical\ncapital investment by firms, but instead is short-term portfolio investment in government bonds. When\ninflows of foreign financial investment reach high levels, foreign financial investors will be on the alert for any\nreason to fear that the country\u2019s exchange rate may decline or the government may be unable to repay what it\nhas borrowed on time. Just as a few falling rocks can trigger an avalanche; a relatively small piece of bad news\nabout an economy can trigger an enormous outflow of short-term financial capital.\nReducing a nation\u2019s budget deficit will not always be a successful method of reducing its trade deficit, because\nother elements of the national saving and investment identity, like private saving or investment, may change\ninstead. In those cases when the budget deficit is the main cause of the trade deficit, governments should take\nsteps to reduce their budget deficits, lest they make their economy vulnerable to a rapid outflow of\ninternational financial capital that could bring a deep recession.\n31.3How Government Borrowing Affects Private Saving\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Apply Ricardian equivalence to evaluate how government borrowing affects private saving\n\u2022 Interpret a graphic representation of Ricardian equivalence\nA change in government budgets may impact private saving. Imagine that people watch government budgets\nand adjust their savings accordingly. For example, whenever the government runs a budget deficit, people\nAccess for free at openstax.org 31.3 \u2022 How Government Borrowing Affects Private Saving 757\nmight reason: \u201cWell, a higher budget deficit means that I\u2019m just going to owe more taxes in the future to pay off\nall that government borrowing, so I\u2019ll start saving now.\u201d If the government runs budget surpluses, people might\nreason: \u201cWith these budget surpluses (or lower budget deficits), interest rates are falling, so that saving is less\nattractive. Moreover, with a budget surplus the country will be able to afford a tax cut sometime in the future. I\nwon\u2019t bother saving as much now.\u201d\nThe theory that rational private households might shift their saving to offset government saving or borrowing\nis known asRicardian equivalencebecause the idea has intellectual roots in the writings of the early\nnineteenth-century economist David Ricardo (1772\u20131823). If Ricardian equivalence holds completely true,\nthen in the national saving and investment identity, any change in budget deficits or budget surpluses would\nbe completely offset by a corresponding change in private saving. As a result, changes in government\nborrowing would have no effect at all on either physical capital investment or trade balances.\nIn practice, the private sector only sometimes and partially adjusts its savings behavior to offset government\nbudget deficits and surpluses.Figure 31.6shows the patterns of U.S. government budget deficits and surpluses\nand the rate of private saving\u2014which includes saving by both households and firms\u2014since 1980. The\nconnection between the two is not at all obvious. In the mid-1980s, for example, government budget deficits\nwere quite large, but there is no corresponding surge of private saving. However, when budget deficits turn to\nsurpluses in the late 1990s, there is a simultaneous decline in private saving. When budget deficits got very\nlarge in 2008 and 2009, there was another a rise in saving. When the deficit increased again in 2020, saving\njumped up as well. A variety of statistical studies based on the U.S. experience suggests that when government\nborrowing increases by $1, private saving rises by about 30 cents. A World Bank study from the late 1990s,\nlooking at government budgets and private saving behavior in countries around the world, found a similar\nresult.\nFIGURE31.6U.S. Budget Deficits and Private SavingsThe theory of Ricardian equivalence suggests that additional\nprivate saving will offset any increase in government borrowing, while reduced private saving will offset any\ndecrease in government borrowing. Sometimes this theory holds true, and sometimes it does not. (Source: Bureau\nof Economic Analysis and Federal Reserve Economic Data)\nPrivate saving does increase to some extent when governments run large budget deficits, and private saving\nfalls when governments reduce deficits or run large budget surpluses. However, the offsetting effects of private\nsaving compared to government borrowing are much less than one-to-one. In addition, this effect can vary a\ngreat deal from country to country, from time to time, and over the short and the long run.\nIf the funding for a larger budget deficit comes from international financial investors, then a trade deficit may\naccompany a budget deficit. In some countries, this pattern oftwin deficitshas set the stage for international\nfinancial investors first to send their funds to a country and cause an appreciation of its exchange rate and 758 31 \u2022 The Impacts of Government Borrowing\nthen to pull their funds out and cause a depreciation of the exchange rate and a financial crisis as well. It\ndepends on whether funding comes from international financial investors.\n31.4Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic Growth\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain crowding out and its effect on physical capital investment\n\u2022 Explain the relationship between budget deficits and interest rates\n\u2022 Identify why economic growth is tied to investments in physical capital, human capital, and technology\nThe underpinnings of economic growth are investments in physical capital, human capital, and technology, all\nset in an economic environment where firms and individuals can react to the incentives provided by well-\nfunctioning markets and flexible prices. Government borrowing can reduce the financial capital available for\nprivate firms to invest in physical capital. However, government spending can also encourage certain elements\nof long-term growth, such as spending on roads or water systems, on education, or on research and\ndevelopment that creates new technology.\nCrowding Out Physical Capital Investment\nA larger budget deficit will increase demand for financial capital. If private saving and the trade balance\nremain the same, then less financial capital will be available for private investment inphysical capital. When\ngovernment borrowing soaks up available financial capital and leaves less for private investment in physical\ncapital, economists call the resultcrowding out.\nTo understand the potential impact of crowding out, consider the U.S. economy's situation before the\nexceptional circumstances of the recession that started in late 2007. In 2005, for example, the budget deficit\nwas roughly 3% of GDP. Private investment by firms in the U.S. economy has hovered in the range of 14% to\n18% of GDP in recent decades. However, in any given year, roughly half of U.S. investment in physical capital\njust replaces machinery and equipment that has worn out or become technologically obsolete. Only about half\nrepresents an increase in the total quantity of physical capital in the economy. Investment in new physical\ncapital in any year is about 7% to 9% of GDP. In this situation, even U.S. budget deficits in the range of 3% of\nGDP can potentially crowd out a substantial share of new investment spending. Conversely, a smaller budget\ndeficit (or an increased budget surplus) increases the pool of financial capital available for private investment.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/debtclock)to view the \u201cU.S. Debt Clock.\u201d\nFigure 31.7shows the patterns of U.S. budget deficits and private investment since 1980. If greater\ngovernment deficits lead to less private investment in physical capital, and reduced government deficits or\nbudget surpluses lead to more investment in physical capital, these two lines should move up and down\nsimultaneously. This pattern occurred in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The U.S. federal budget went from a\ndeficit of 2.2% of GDP in 1995 to a budget surplus of 2.4% of GDP in 2000\u2014a swing of 4.6% of GDP. From 1995\nto 2000, private investment in physical capital rose from 15% to 18% of GDP\u2014a rise of 3% of GDP. Then, when\nthe U.S. government again started running budget deficits in the early 2000s, less financial capital became\navailable for private investment, and the rate of private investment fell back to about 15% of GDP by 2003.\nHowever, in more recent years, in the 2010s after the economy recovered from the Great Recession, private\ninvestment as a share of GDP increased even as deficits slightly worsened, especially around 2016. And while\nthe deficit increased substantially in 2020, private investment as a share of GDP did not.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 31.4 \u2022 Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic Growth 759\nFIGURE31.7U.S. Budget Deficits/Surpluses and Private InvestmentThe connection between private savings and\nflows of international capital plays a role in budget deficits and surpluses. Consequently, government borrowing and\nprivate investment sometimes rise and fall together. For example, the 1990s show a pattern in which reduced\ngovernment borrowing helped to reduce crowding out so that more funds were available for private investment.\nThis argument does not claim that a government's budget deficits will exactly shadow its national rate of\nprivate investment; after all, we must account for private saving and inflows of foreign financial investment. In\nthe mid-1980s, for example, government budget deficits increased substantially without a corresponding drop\noff in private investment. In 2009, nonresidential private fixed investment dropped by $300 billion from its\nprevious level of $1,941 billion in 2008, primarily because, during a recession, firms lack both the funds and\nthe incentive to invest. Investment growth between 2009 and 2014 averaged approximately 5.9% to $2,210.5\nbillion\u2014only slightly above its 2008 level, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. During that same\nperiod, interest rates dropped from 3.94% to less than a quarter percent as the Federal Reserve took dramatic\naction to prevent a depression by increasing the money supply through lowering short-term interest rates. The\n\"crowding out\" of private investment due to government borrowing to finance expenditures appears to have\nbeen suspended after the Great Recession.\nThe Interest Rate Connection\nAssume that government borrowing of substantial amounts will have an effect on the quantity of private\ninvestment. How will this affect interest rates in financial markets? InFigure 31.8, the original equilibrium (E )\n0\nwhere thedemand curve(D ) for financial capital intersects with thesupply curve(S ) occurs at an interest\n0 0\nrate of 5% and an equilibrium quantity equal to 20% of GDP. However, as the government budget deficit\nincreases, the demand curve for financial capital shifts from D to D . The new equilibrium (E ) occurs at an\n0 1 1\ninterest rate of 6% and an equilibrium quantity of 21% of GDP.\nFIGURE31.8Budget Deficits and Interest RatesIn the financial market, an increase in government borrowing can 760 31 \u2022 The Impacts of Government Borrowing\nshift the demand curve for financial capital to the right from D to D . As the equilibrium interest rate shifts from E\n0 1 0\nto E , the interest rate rises from 5% to 6% in this example. The higher interest rate is one economic mechanism by\n1\nwhich government borrowing can crowd out private investment.\nA survey of economic studies on the connection between government borrowing and interest rates in the U.S.\neconomy suggests that an increase of 1% in the budget deficit will lead to a rise in interest rates of between 0.5\nand 1.0%, other factors held equal. In turn, a higher interest rate tends to discourage firms from making\nphysical capital investments. One reason government budget deficits crowd out private investment, therefore,\nis the increase in interest rates. There are, however, economic studies that show a limited connection between\nthe two (at least in the United States), but as the budget deficit grows, the dangers of rising interest rates\nbecome more real.\nAt this point, you may wonder about theFederal Reserve. After all, can the Federal Reserve not use\nexpansionary monetary policy to reduce interest rates, or in this case, to prevent interest rates from rising?\nThis useful question emphasizes the importance of considering how fiscal and monetary policies work in\nrelation to each other. Imagine a central bank faced with a government that is running large budget deficits,\ncausing a rise in interest rates and crowding out private investment. If the budget deficits are increasing\naggregate demand when the economy is already producing near potential GDP, threatening an inflationary\nincrease in price levels, the central bank may react with acontractionary monetary policy. In this situation, the\nhigher interest rates from the government borrowing would be made even higher by contractionary monetary\npolicy, and the government borrowing might crowd out a great deal of private investment.\nAlternatively, if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing\nsubstantially less than potential GDP, an inflationary increase in the price level is not much of a danger and the\ncentral bank might react withexpansionary monetary policy. In this situation, higher interest rates from\ngovernment borrowing would be largely offset by lower interest rates from expansionary monetary policy, and\nthere would be little crowding out of private investment.\nHowever, even a central bank cannot erase the overall message of the national savings and investment identity.\nIf government borrowing rises, then private investment must fall, or private saving must rise, or the trade\ndeficit must rise. By reacting with contractionary or expansionary monetary policy, the central bank can only\nhelp to determine which of these outcomes is likely.\nPublic Investment in Physical Capital\nGovernment can invest in physical capital directly: roads and bridges; water supply and sewers; seaports and\nairports; schools and hospitals; plants that generate electricity, like hydroelectric dams or windmills;\ntelecommunications facilities; and military weapons. In 2021, the United States spent about $146 billion on\ntransportation, including highways, mass transit, and airports.Table 31.1shows the federal government's\ntotal outlay for 2021 for major public physical capital investment in the United States. We have omitted\nphysical capital related to the military or to residences where people live from this table, because the focus\nhere is on public investments that have a direct effect on raising output in the private sector.\nType of Public Physical Capital Federal Outlays 2014 Federal Outlays 2021\nTransportation $91,915 $146,156\nCommunity and regional development $20,670 $83,619\nNatural resources and the environment $36,171 $40,691\nTABLE31.1Grants for Major Physical Capital Investment, 2014 and 2021, in $ Millions(Source:\nBureau of Economic Analysis, Table 3.15.5, https://apps.bea.gov/itable/index.cfm).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 31.4 \u2022 Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic Growth 761\nType of Public Physical Capital Federal Outlays 2014 Federal Outlays 2021\nEducation, training, employment, and social services $90,615 $236,723\nOther $37,282 $41,227\nTotal $276,653 $548,416\nTABLE31.1Grants for Major Physical Capital Investment, 2014 and 2021, in $ Millions(Source:\nBureau of Economic Analysis, Table 3.15.5, https://apps.bea.gov/itable/index.cfm).\nPublic physical capital investment of this sort can increase the economy's output and productivity. An\neconomy with reliable roads and electricity will be able to produce more. However, it is hard to quantify how\nmuch government investment in physical capital will benefit the economy, because government responds to\npolitical as well as economic incentives. When a firm makes an investment in physical capital, it is subject to\nthe discipline of the market: If it does not receive a positive return on investment, the firm may lose money or\neven go out of business.\nIn some cases, lawmakers make investments in physical capital as a way of spending money in key politicians'\ndistricts. The result may be unnecessary roads or office buildings. Even if a project is useful and necessary, it\nmight be done in a way that is excessively costly, because local contractors who make campaign contributions\nto politicians appreciate the extra business. Alternatively, governments sometimes do not make the\ninvestments they should because a decision to spend on infrastructure does not need to just make economic\nsense. It must be politically popular as well. Managing public investment cost-effectively can be difficult.\nIf a government decides to finance an investment in public physical capital with higher taxes or lower\ngovernment spending in other areas, it need not worry that it is directly crowding out private investment.\nIndirectly however, higher household taxes could cut down on the level of private savings available and have a\nsimilar effect. If a government decides to finance an investment in public physical capital by borrowing, it may\nend up increasing the quantity of public physical capital at the cost of crowding out investment in private\nphysical capital, which could be more beneficial to the economy.\nPublic Investment in Human Capital\nIn most countries, the government plays a large role in society's investment in human capital through the\neducation system. A highly educated and skilled workforce contributes to a higher rate of economic growth.\nFor the low-income nations of the world, additional investment in human capital seems likely to increase\nproductivity and growth. For the United States, critics have raised tough questions about how much increases\nin government spending on education will improve the actual level of education.\nAmong economists, discussions of education reform often begin with some uncomfortable facts. AsFigure\n31.9shows, spending per student for kindergarten through grade 12 (K\u201312) increased substantially in real\ndollars through 2010, declined slightly in 2011 and 2012, and began rising again after that through 2020.\nHowever, as measured by standardized tests like the SAT, the level of student academic achievement has\nbarely budged in recent decades. On international tests, U.S. students lag behind students from many other\ncountries. (Of course, test scores are an imperfect measure of education for a variety of reasons. It would be\ndifficult, however, to argue that there are not real problems in the U.S. education system and that the tests are\njust inaccurate.) 762 31 \u2022 The Impacts of Government Borrowing\nFIGURE31.9Total Spending for Elementary, Secondary, and Vocational Education (1998\u20132020) in the United\nStatesThe graph shows that government spending on education was continually increasing up until 2006 where it\nleveled off until 2008 when it increased dramatically. Since 2010, spending has steadily decreased. (Source: Office\nof Management and Budget)\nThe fact that increased financial resources have not brought greater measurable gains in student performance\nhas led some education experts to question whether the problems may be due to structure, not just to the\nresources spent.\nOther government programs seek to increase human capital either before or after the K\u201312 education system.\nPrograms for early childhood education, like the federalHead Start program, are directed at families where\nthe parents may have limited educational and financial resources. Government also offers substantial support\nfor universities and colleges. For example, in the United States about 60% of students take at least a few college\nor university classes beyond the high school level. In Germany and Japan, about half of all students take\nclasses beyond the comparable high school level. In the countries of Latin America, only about one student in\nfour takes classes beyond the high school level, and in the nations of sub-Saharan Africa, only about one\nstudent in 20.\nNot all spending on educationalhuman capitalneeds to happen through the government: many college\nstudents in the United States pay a substantial share of the cost of their education. If low-income countries of\nthe world are going to experience a widespread increase in their education levels for grade-school children,\ngovernment spending seems likely to play a substantial role. For the U.S. economy, and for other high-income\ncountries, the primary focus at this time is more on how to get a bigger return from existing spending on\neducation and how to improve the performance of the average high school graduate, rather than dramatic\nincreases in education spending.\nHow Fiscal Policy Can Improve Technology\nResearch and development (R&D) efforts are the lifeblood of new technology. According to the National Science\nFoundation, federal outlays for research, development, and physical plant improvements to various\ngovernmental agencies have remained at an average of 8.8% of GDP. About one-fifth of U.S. R&D spending goes\nto defense and space-oriented research. Although defense-oriented R&D spending may sometimes produce\nconsumer-oriented spinoffs, R&D that is aimed at producing new weapons is less likely to benefit the civilian\neconomy than direct civilian R&D spending.\nFiscal policy can encourage R&D using either direct spending or tax policy. Government could spend more on\nthe R&D that it carries out in government laboratories, as well as expanding federal R&D grants to universities\nand colleges, nonprofit organizations, and the private sector. By 2014, the federal share of R&D outlays totaled\n$135.5 billion, or about 4% of the federal government's total budget outlays, according to data from the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 31.4 \u2022 Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic Growth 763\nNational Science Foundation. Fiscal policy can also support R&D through tax incentives, which allow firms to\nreduce their tax bill as they increase spending on research and development.\nSummary of Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic Growth\nInvestment in physical capital, human capital, and new technology is essential for long-term economic growth,\nasTable 31.2summarizes. In a market-oriented economy, private firms will undertake most of the investment\nin physical capital, and fiscal policy should seek to avoid a long series of outsized budget deficits that might\ncrowd out such investment. We will see the effects of many growth-oriented policies very gradually over time,\nas students are better educated, we make physical capital investments, and man invents and implements new\ntechnologies.\nPhysical Capital Human Capital New Technology\nPrivate New investment in On-the-job\nResearch and development\nSector property and equipment training\nPublic Public education Research and development encouraged through private\nPublic infrastructure\nSector Job training sector incentives and direct spending.\nTABLE31.2Investment Role of Public and Private Sector in a Market Economy\nBRING IT HOME\nFinancing Higher Education\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, between 1980 and 2020, the average tuition and fees at a 4-year public\nuniversity increased from $738 to $9,349. This represents a more than 12-fold increase in this 40 year period. To\nput this increase into perspective, median yearly household income in the U.S. has increased from about $20,000 to\n$67,000 during the same time\u2014about a 3.5-fold increase. Clearly, college is becoming increasingly expensive, even\nas it continues to provide the same benefits that were mentioned at the beginning of this chapter by President\nLyndon B. Johnson.\nCrucial to the mission of higher education is the Pell Grant program, which was initiated by President Johnson as\npart of the Higher Education Act of 1965. But Pell Grant amounts have not adequately kept up with the rising costs\nof college tuition and fees. As part of President Joe Biden's Build Back Better proposal, the maximum Pell Grant\naward would increase to $7,045 between 2022\u20132025, representing an 8.5% increase, which is one of the largest\n1-year increases in the last 20 years (the largest increase occurred between 2009 and 2010, during President\nBarack Obama's term in office).

However, a sustained pattern of large budget deficits\nover time risks causing several negative macroeconomic outcomes: a shift to the right in aggregate demand\nthat causes an inflationary increase in the price level; crowding out private investment in physical capital in a\nway that slows down economic growth; and creating a dependence on inflows of international portfolio\ninvestment which can sometimes turn into outflows of foreign financial investment that can be injurious to a\nmacroeconomy.\n31.3How Government Borrowing Affects Private Saving\nThe theory of Ricardian equivalence holds that changes in private saving will offset changes in government\nborrowing or saving. Thus, greater private saving will offset higher budget deficits, while greater private\nborrowing will offset larger budget surpluses. If the theory holds true, then changes in government borrowing\nor saving would have no effect on private investment in physical capital or on the trade balance. However,\nempirical evidence suggests that the theory holds true only partially.\n31.4Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic Growth\nEconomic growth comes from a combination of investment in physical capital, human capital, and technology.\nGovernment borrowing can crowd out private sector investment in physical capital, but fiscal policy can also\nincrease investment in publicly owned physical capital, human capital (education), and research and\ndevelopment. Possible methods for improving education and society\u2019s investment in human capital include\nspending more money on teachers and other educational resources, and reorganizing the education system to\nprovide greater incentives for success. Methods for increasing research and development spending to generate\nnew technology include direct government spending on R&D and tax incentives for businesses to conduct\nadditional R&D.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

He had 768 32 \u2022 Macroeconomic Policy Around the World\nhigh hopes for the future. Like many young South Africans, however, he had difficulty finding a job. \u201cI was just stuck\nat home waiting, waiting for something to come up,\u201d he said in a BBC interview. In South Africa over 60% of young\nadults are unemployed. In fact, the problem is not limited to South Africa. Seventy-three million of the world\u2019s youth\naged 15 to 24 are currently unemployed, according to the International Labour Organization.\nThis chapter will look at macroeconomic policies around the world, specifically those related to reducing\nunemployment, promoting economic growth, and stable inflation and exchange rates.\nThere are extraordinary differences in the composition and performance of economies across the world. What\nexplains these differences? Are countries motivated by similar goals when it comes to macroeconomic policy?\nCan we apply the same macroeconomic framework that we developed in this text to understand the\nperformance of these countries? Let\u2019s take each of these questions in turn.\nExplaining differences: Recall fromUnemploymentthat we explained the difference in composition and\nperformance of economies by appealing to an aggregate production function. We argued that differences in\nproductivity explain the diversity of average incomes across the world, which in turn were affected by inputs\nsuch as capital deepening, human capital, and \u201ctechnology.\u201d Every economy has its own distinctive economic\ncharacteristics, institutions, history, and political realities, which imply that access to these \u201cingredients\u201d will\nvary by country and so will economic performance.\nFor example, South Korea invested heavily in education and technology to increase agricultural productivity in\nthe early 1950s. Some of this investment came from its historical relationship with the United States. As a\nresult of these and many other institutions, its economy has managed to converge to the levels of income in\nleading economies like Japan and the United States.\nSimilar goals and frameworks: Many economies that have performed well in terms of per capita income\nhave\u2014for better or worse\u2014been motivated by a similar goal: to maintain the quality of life of their citizens.\nQuality of life is a broad term, but as you can imagine it includes but is not limited to such things as low level of\nunemployment, price stability (low levels of inflation), and the ability to trade. These seem to be universal\nmacroeconomic goals as we discussed inThe Macroeconomic Perspective. No country would argue against\nthem. To study macroeconomic policy around the world, we begin by comparing standards of living. In\nkeeping with these goals, we also look at indicators such as unemployment, inflation, and the balance of trade\npolicies across countries. Remember that every country has had a diverse set of experiences; therefore\nalthough our goals may be similar, each country may well require macroeconomic policies tailored to its\ncircumstances.\nLINK IT UP\nFor more reading on the topic of youth unemployment, visit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/genjobless)to\nread \u201cGeneration Jobless\u201d in theEconomist.\n32.1The Diversity of Countries and Economies across the World\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Analyze GDP and GNI per capita as a measure of the diversity of international standards of living\n\u2022 Identify what classifies a country as low income, lower-middle income, upper-middle income, or high\nincome\n\u2022 Explain how geography, demographics, industry structure, and economic institutions influence standards\nof living\nThe national economies that comprise the global economy are remarkably diverse. Let us use one key\nindicator of the standard of living,GDP per capita, to quantify this diversity. You will quickly see that\nAccess for free at openstax.org 32.1 \u2022 The Diversity of Countries and Economies across the World 769\nquantifying this diversity is fraught with challenges and limitations. As we explained inThe Macroeconomic\nPerspective, we must consider usingpurchasing power parityor \u201cinternational dollars\u201d to convert average\nincomes into comparable units. Purchasing power parity, as we formally defined inExchange Rates and\nInternational Capital Flows, takes into account that prices of the same good are different across countries.\nThe Macroeconomic Perspectiveexplained how to measure GDP, the challenges of using GDP to compare\nstandards of living, and the difficulty of confusing economic size with distribution. In China\u2019s case, for\nexample, China ranks as the second largest global economy, second to only the United States, with Japan\nranking third. However, when we take China\u2019s GDP of $9.2 trillion and divide it by its population of 1.4 billion,\nthen the per capita GDP is only $6,900, which is significantly lower than that of Japan, at $38,500, and that of\nthe United States, at $52,800. Measurement issues aside, it\u2019s worth repeating that the goal, then, is to not only\nincrease GDP, but to strive toward increased GDP per capita to increase overall living standards for individuals.\nAs we have learned fromEconomic Growth, countries can achieve this at the national level by designing\npolicies that increase worker productivity, deepen capital, and advance technology.\nThe related measure gross national income (GNI) per capita also allows us to rank countries into high-, upper-\nmiddle-, lower-middle-, or low-income groups. The World Bank updates the classifications each year. Low-\nincome countries are those with $1,085 per capita GNI per year; lower-middle-income countries have a per\ncapita GNI between $1,086 and $4,255; upper-middle-income countries have a per capita GDP between\n$4,265 and $13,205; while high-income countries have over $13,206 per year per capita income. According to\nthe 2022 classifications, there are 27 low-income nations and 80 high-income nations. The other 110\nmeasured nations occupy the two tiers of middle-income nations, and are comprised of the vast\nmajority\u201475%, of the world\u2019s population. Despite the population and quantitative majority, these nations only\nproduce one third of global GNI and have nearly two-thirds of the world\u2019s people living in poverty.\nGDP (in % of Global Population % of Global\nIncome Group\nbillions) GDP (millions) Population\nLow income ($1,085 or less) $457.6 0.5% 665.1 8.6%\nLower- and upper-middle income\n$30,535 36.5% 5,853 75.7%\n($1,086\u2013$13,205)\nHigh income (more than $13,205) $53,396 63% 1,215 15.7%\nWorld Total income $84,388 7,773.1\nTABLE32.1World Income versus Global PopulationNote that while the income categories are determined by GNI,\nmany other economic measures use GDP.

AsTable 32.2shows, nominal GDP per capita in 2020 for the 652 million people living in\nLatin America and the Caribbean region (excluding high income countries in that region) was $6,799, which\nfar exceeds that of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

To put things in perspective, North America and the European Union (plus\nthe United Kingdom) have slightly more than 10% of the world\u2019s population, but they produce and consume\nabout 44% of the world\u2019s GDP.\nFIGURE32.3GDP Per Capita in U.S. DollarsThere is a clear imbalance in the GDP across the world.

(Source: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD)\nSuch comparisons between regions are admittedly rough. After all, per capita GDP cannot fully capture the\nquality of life. Many other factors have a large impact on the standard of living, like health, education, human\nrights, crime and personal safety, and environmental quality. These measures also reveal very wide\ndifferences in the standard of living across the regions of the world. Much of this is correlated with per capita\nincome, but there are exceptions. For example, life expectancy at birth in many low-income regions\napproximates those who are more affluent. The data also illustrate that nobody can claim to have perfect\nstandards of living. For instance, despite very high income levels, there is still undernourishment in Europe\nand North America.\nLINK IT UP\nEconomists know that there are many factors that contribute to your standard of living. People in high-income\ncountries may have very little time due to heavy workloads and may feel disconnected from their community.\nLower-income countries may be more community centered, but have little in the way of material wealth. It is\nhard to measure these characteristics of standard of living. The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and\nDevelopment has developed the \u201cOECD Better Life Index.\u201d Visit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/\nstandofliving)to see how countries measure up to your expected standard of living.\nThe differences in economic statistics and other measures of well-being, substantial though they are, do not\nfully capture the reasons for the enormous differences between countries. Aside from theneoclassical\ndeterminants of growth, four additional determinants are significant in a wide range of statistical studies and\nare worth mentioning: geography, demography, industrial structure, and institutions.\nGeographic and Demographic Differences\nCountries have geographic differences: some have extensive coastlines, some are landlocked. Some have large\nrivers that have been a path of commerce for centuries, or mountains that have been a barrier to trade. Some\nhave deserts, some have rain forests. These differences create different positive and negative opportunities for\ncommerce, health, and the environment.\nCountries also have considerable differences in the age distribution of the population. Many high-income 772 32 \u2022 Macroeconomic Policy Around the World\nnations are approaching a situation by 2020 or so in which the elderly will form a much larger share of the\npopulation. Most low-income countries still have a higher proportion of youth and young adults, but by about\n2050, the elderly populations in these low-income countries are expected to boom as well. These demographic\nchanges will have considerable impact on the standard of living of the young and the old.\nDifferences in Industry Structure and Economic Institutions\nCountries have differences in industry structure. In the world\u2019s high-income economies, only about 2% of GDP\ncomes from agriculture; the average for the rest of the world is 12%. Countries have strong differences in\ndegree of urbanization.\nCountries also have strong differences in economic institutions: some nations have economies that are\nextremely market-oriented, while other nations have command economies. Some nations are open to\ninternational trade, while others use tariffs and import quotas to limit the impact of trade. Some nations are\ntorn by long-standing armed conflicts; other nations are largely at peace. There are also differences in\npolitical, religious, and social institutions.\nNo nation intentionally aims for a low standard of living, high rates of unemployment and inflation, or an\nunsustainable trade imbalance. However, nations will differ in their priorities and in the situations in which\nthey find themselves, and so their policy choices can reasonably vary, too. The next modules will discuss how\nnations around the world, from high income to low income, approach the four macroeconomic goals of\neconomic growth, low unemployment, low inflation, and a sustainable balance of trade.\n32.2Improving Countries\u2019 Standards of Living\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Analyze the growth policies of low-income countries seeking to improve standards of living\n\u2022 Analyze the growth policies of middle-income countries, particularly the East Asian Tigers with their focus\non technology and market-oriented incentives\n\u2022 Analyze the struggles facing economically-challenged countries wishing to enact growth policies\n\u2022 Evaluate the success of sending aid to low-income countries\nJobs are created in economies that grow. What is the origin of economic growth? According to most economists\nwho believe in thegrowth consensus, economic growth (as we discussed inEconomic Growth) is built on a\nfoundation of productivity improvements. In turn, productivity increases are the result of greater human and\nphysical capital and technology, all interacting in a market-driven economy. In the pursuit of economic growth,\nhowever, some countries and regions start from different levels, as the differences in per capita GDP presented\nearlier inTable 32.2illustrate.\nGrowth Policies for the High-Income Countries\nFor the high-income countries, the challenge of economic growth is to push continually for a more educated\nworkforce that can create, invest in, and apply new technologies. In effect, the goal of their growth-oriented\npublic policy is to shift their aggregate supply curves to the right (refer toThe Aggregate Demand/Aggregate\nSupply Model). The main public policies targeted at achieving this goal are fiscal policies focused on\ninvestment, including investment in human capital, in technology, and in physical plant and equipment. These\ncountries also recognize that economic growth works best in a stable and market-oriented economic climate.\nFor this reason, they use monetary policy to keep inflation low and stable, and to minimize the risk of\nexchange rate fluctuations, while also encouraging domestic and international competition.\nHowever, early in the second decade of the 2000s, many high-income countries found themselves more\nfocused on the short term than on the long term. The United States, Western Europe, and Japan all\nexperienced a combination of financial crisis and deep recession, and the after-effects of the recession\u2014like\nhigh unemployment rates\u2014seemed likely to linger for several years. Most of these governments took\nAccess for free at openstax.org 32.2 \u2022 Improving Countries\u2019 Standards of Living 773\naggressive, and in some cases controversial, steps to jump-start their economies by running very large budget\ndeficits as part of expansionary fiscal policy. These countries must adopt a course that combines lower\ngovernment spending and higher taxes.\nSimilarly, many central banks ran highly expansionary monetary policies, with both near-zero interest rates\nand unconventional loans and investments. For example, in 2012, Shinzo Abe (seeFigure 32.4), then newly-\nelected Prime Minister of Japan, unveiled a plan to pull his country out of its two-decade-long slump in\neconomic growth. It included both fiscal stimulus and an increase in the money supply. The plan was\nsuccessful in some ways and unsuccessful in others. While real GDP growth in Japan has averaged around 1%\nsince 2012 (and was only 0.2% in 2014 and 0.7% in 2016) and while the inflation rate has struggled to stay\npositive in recent years, the unemployment rate continued to decline through the 2010s. By early 2020, prior\nto the pandemic, the unemployment rate stood at just 2.5%. Public debt has also reached a plateau in the last\n5\u20137 years of about 230\u2013240% of GDP, although this number did increase slightly in 2020 due to the pandemic.\nShinzo Abe stepped down as Prime Minister of Japan in 2020, and was assassinated in 2022.\nFIGURE32.4Japan\u2019s Former Prime Minister, Shinzo AbeJapan used fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate its\neconomy, which has helped bring down unemployment, but inflation remains stubbornly low.

The\nchallenge for many of the developed countries in the next few years will be to grapple with the consequences of\nthe pandemic. With high unemployment and no end of the virus containment in sight, it will be challenging for\nthese governments to refocus their efforts on new technology, education, and physical capital investment.\nGrowth Policies for the Middle-Income Economies\nThe world\u2019s great economic success stories in the last few decades began in the 1970s with that group of\nnations sometimes known as theEast Asian Tigers: South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and\nSingapore. The list sometimes includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, although often under international law they\nare treated as part of China, rather than as separate countries. The economic growth of the Tigers has been\nphenomenal, typically averaging 5.5% real per capita growth for several decades. In the 1980s, other countries\nbegan to show signs of convergence. China began growing rapidly, often at annual rates of 8% to 10% per year.\nIndia began growing rapidly, first at rates of about 5% per year in the 1990s, but then higher still in the first\ndecade of the 2000s.\nWe know the underlying causes of these rapid growth rates:\n\u2022 China and the East Asian Tigers, in particular, have been among the highest savers in the world, often\nsaving one-third or more of GDP as compared to the roughly one-fifth of GDP, which would be a more\ntypical saving rate in Latin America and Africa. These countries harnessed higher savings for domestic\ninvestment to build physical capital.\n\u2022 These countries had policies that supported heavy investments in human capital, first building up\nprimary-level education and then expanding secondary-level education. Many focused on encouraging\nmath and science education, which is useful in engineering and business.\n\u2022 Governments made a concerted effort to seek out applicable technology, by sending students and 774 32 \u2022 Macroeconomic Policy Around the World\ngovernment commissions abroad to look at the most efficient industrial operations elsewhere. They also\ncreated policies to support innovative companies that wished to build production facilities to take\nadvantage of the abundant and inexpensive human capital.\n\u2022 China and India in particular also allowed far greater freedom for market forces, both within their own\ndomestic economies and also in encouraging their firms to participate in world markets.\nThis combination oftechnology,human capital, andphysical capital, combined with the incentives of a\nmarket-oriented economic context, proved an extremely powerful stimulant to growth. Challenges that these\nmiddle-income countries faced are a legacy of government economic controls that for political reasons can be\ndismantled only slowly over time. In many of them, the government heavily regulates the banking and\nfinancial sector. Governments have also sometimes selected certain industries to receive low-interest loans or\ngovernment subsidies. These economies have found that an increased dose of market-oriented incentives for\nfirms and workers has been a critical ingredient in the recipe for faster growth. To learn more about\nmeasuring economic growth, read the following Clear It Up feature.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat is the rule of 72?\nIt is worth pausing a moment to marvel at the East Asian Tigers' growth rates. If per capita GDP grows at, say, 6%\nper year, then you can apply the formula for compound growth rates\u2014that is (1 + 0.06)30\u2014meaning a nation\u2019s level\nof per capita GDP will rise by a multiple of almost six over 30 years. Another strategy is to apply the rule of 72. The\nrule of 72 is an approximation to figure out doubling time. We divide the rule number, 72, by the annual growth rate\nto obtain the approximate number of years it will take for income to double. If we have a 6% growth rate, it will take\n72/6, or 12 years, for incomes to double. Using this rule here suggests that a Tiger that grows at 6% will double its\nGDP every 12 years. In contrast, a technological leader, chugging along with per capita growth rates of about 2% per\nyear, would double its income in 36 years.\nGrowth Policies for Economically-Challenged Countries\nMany economically-challenged or low-income countries are geographically located in Sub-Saharan Africa.\nOther pockets of low income are in the former Soviet Bloc, and in parts of Central America and the Caribbean.\nThere are macroeconomic policies and prescriptions that might alleviate the extreme poverty and low\nstandard of living. However, many of these countries lack the economic and legal stability, along with market-\noriented institutions, needed to provide a fertile climate for domestic economic growth and to attract foreign\ninvestment. Thus, macroeconomic policies for low income economies are vastly different from those of the\nhigh income economies. The World Bank has made it a priority to combat poverty and raise overall income\nlevels through 2030. One of the key obstacles to achieving this is the political instability that seems to be a\ncommon feature of low-income countries.\nFigure 32.5shows the ten lowest income countries as ranked by The World Bank in 2020. These countries\nshare some common traits, the most significant of which is the recent failures of their governments to provide\na legal framework for economic growth. Civil and ethnic wars have impacted Burundi. Command economies,\ncorruption, as well as political factionalism and infighting are commonly adopted elements in these low-\nincome countries. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (often referred to as \u201cCongo\u201d) is a resource-wealthy\ncountry that has not been able to increase its subsistence standard of living due to the political environment.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 32.2 \u2022 Improving Countries\u2019 Standards of Living 775\nFIGURE32.5The Ten Lowest Income CountriesThis bar chart that shows the ten lowest-income countries by per\ncapita income. They are, from lowest income to highest: Burundi, Somalia, Mozambique, Madagascar, Central\nAfrican Republic, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Niger, and Sudan. (Source:\nhttp://databank.worldbank.org/data/views/reports/map.aspx#)\nLow-income countries are at a disadvantage because any incomes that people receive are spent immediately\non necessities such as food. People in these countries live on less than $1,035 per year, which is less than $100\nper month. Lack of saving means a lack of capital accumulation and a lack of loanable funds for investment in\nphysical and human capital. Recent research by two MIT economists,Abhijit BannerjeeandEsther Duflo, has\nconfirmed that the households in these economies are trapped in low incomes because they cannot muster\nenough investment to push themselves out of poverty.\nFor example, the average citizen of Burundi, a low-income country, subsists on $239 per year (adjusted to\n2020 dollars). According to Central Intelligence Agency data in its CIA Factbook, as of 2021, 85% of Burundi\u2019s\npopulation is agrarian, with bananas as the main income producing crop. Only one in two children attends\nschool and, asFigure 32.6shows, many are not in schools comparable to what occurs in developed countries.\nPolitical instability has made it difficult for Burundi to make significant headway toward growth, as verified by\nthe electrification of only 11% of households and 40% of its national income coming from foreign aid.\nFIGURE32.6Lack of Funds for Investing in Human CapitalIn low-income countries, people often spend all income\non necessities for living and cannot accumulate or invest in physical or human capital. The students in this\nphotograph learn in an outside \u201cclassroom\u201d void of not only technology, but even chairs and desks. (Credit: \u201cLiving in\nKuito\u201d by Rafaela Printes/Flickr Creative Commons, CC BY 2.0) 776 32 \u2022 Macroeconomic Policy Around the World\nLINK IT UP\nThe World Factbookwebsite(http://openstax.org/l/worldfactbook)is loaded with maps, flags, and other\ninformation about countries across the globe.\nOther low-income countries share similar stories. These countries have found it difficult to generate\ninvestments for themselves or to find foreign investors willing to put up the money for more than the basic\nneeds. Foreign aid and external investment comprise significant portions of the income in these economies,\nbut are not sufficient to allow for the capital accumulation necessary to invest in physical and human capital.\nHowever, is foreign aid always a contributor to economic growth?\nDevelopment economics is a branch of economics that often focuses on answering that question and others\nlike it. Development economists analyze the forces and outcomes of economics in developing nations. The field\nis typically focused on\u2014and sometimes defined as\u2014understanding and implementing policies and practices to\nimprove economic and social wellbeing in low- and middle-income nations or regions. But it is an extremely\nwide and varied area of study, often blending politics, fiscal policy, education, innovation, health and medicine,\ninternational trade, natural resources, and military/geopolitical considerations.\nMany development economists have focused on understanding the best mix of approaches to foster equitable\nand sustainable growth. Like other economists, they may analyze practices or outcomes from the past and\napply that knowledge to the present and future. And many prominent development economists challenge\ntraditional ways of thinking. Dambisa Moyo, for example, provides evidence indicating that foreign aid is rarely\na positive solution and often does more harm than good. In her bookDead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and\nHow There Is Another Way for Africa(2009), she lays out the failure of past aid, indicating that it typically ends\nup in the pockets of corrupt officials and has the adverse effect of minimizing other types of investment. At the\ntime, Moyo proposed a complete stoppage of foreign aid into Africa. Moyo sees far greater promise in increases\nin trade and direct private investment, as well as other financing options such as bonds.\nCLEAR IT UP\nDoes foreign aid to low-income countries work?\nAccording to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), about $134 billion per year in\nforeign aid flows from the high-income countries of the world to the low-income ones. Relative to the size of their\npopulations or economies, this is not a large amount for either donors or recipients. For low-income countries, aid\naverages about 1.3 percent of their GDP. However, even this relatively small amount has been highly controversial.\nSupporters of additional foreign aid point to the extraordinary human suffering in the world's low-and middle-\nincome countries. They see opportunities all across Africa, Asia, and Latin America to set up health clinics and\nschools. They want to help with the task of building economic infrastructure: clean water, plumbing, electricity, and\nroads. Supporters of this aid include formal state-sponsored institutions like the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for\nInternational Development (DFID) or independent non-governmental organizations (NGOs) like CARE International\nthat also receive donor government funds. For example, because of an outbreak of meningitis in Ethiopia in 2010,\nDFID channeled significant funds to the Ethiopian Ministry of Health to train rural health care workers and also for\nvaccines. These monies helped the Ministry offset shortfalls in their budget.\nOpponents of increased aid do not quarrel with the goal of reducing human suffering, but they suggest that foreign\naid has often proved a poor tool for advancing that goal. For example, according to an article in theAttach\u00e9 Journal\nof International Affairs, the Canadian foreign aid organization (CIDA) provided $100 million to Tanzania to grow\nwheat. The project did produce wheat, but nomadic pastoralists and other villagers who had lived on the land were\ndriven off 100,000 acres of land to make way for the project. The damage in terms of human rights and lost\nlivelihoods was significant. Villagers were beaten and killed because some refused to leave the land. At times, the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 32.3 \u2022 Causes of Unemployment around the World 777\nunintended collateral damage from foreign aid can be significant.\nWilliam Easterly, professor of economics at New York University, argues that countries often receive aid for political\nreasons and the aid does more harm than good. If a country's government creates a reasonably stable and market-\noriented macroeconomic climate, then foreign investors will be likely to provide funds for many profitable activities.\nFor example, Facebook partnered with multiple organizations in a project called Internet.org to provide access in\nremote and low-income areas of the world, and Google began its own initiative called Project Loon in 2011, although\nit was phased out in 2021. Facebook\u2019s first forays into providing internet access via mobile phones began in stable,\nmarket-oriented countries like India, Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, and the Philippines and continues its work in Africa\nby working with telecommunications corporations in China to develop an undersea cable network.\nPolicymakers are now wiser about foreign aid limitations than they were a few decades ago. In targeted and specific\ncases, especially if foreign aid is channeled to long-term investment projects, foreign aid can have a modest role to\nplay in reducing the extreme levels of deprivation that hundreds of millions of people around the world experience.\nLINK IT UP\nWatch thisvideo(http://openstax.org/l/foodafrica)on the complexities of providing economic aid in Africa.\n32.3Causes of Unemployment around the World\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain the nature and causes of unemployment\n\u2022 Analyze the natural rate of unemployment and the factors that affect it\n\u2022 Identify how undeveloped labor markets can result in the same hardships as unemployment\nWe can categorize the causes of unemployment in the world's high-income countries in two ways: either\ncyclical unemployment caused by the economy when in a recession, or the natural rate of unemployment\ncaused by factors in labor markets, such as government regulations regarding hiring and starting businesses.\nUnemployment from a Recession\nForunemploymentcaused by a recession, theKeynesian economic modelpoints out that both monetary and\nfiscal policy tools are available. The monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward:\nrun anexpansionary monetary policyto increase the quantity of money and loans, drive down interest rates,\nand increaseaggregate demand. In arecession, there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off,\nand so even a central bank, with fighting inflation as its top priority, can usually justify some reduction in\ninterest rates.\nWith regard tofiscal policy, theautomatic stabilizersthat we discussed inGovernment Budgets and Fiscal\nPolicyshould be allowed to work, even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession. There is less\nagreement over whether, in addition to automatic stabilizers, governments in a recession should try to adopt\ndiscretionary fiscal policyof additional tax cuts or spending increases. In the case of the Great Recession, the\ncase for this kind of extra-aggressive expansionary fiscal policy is stronger, but for a smaller recession, given\nthe time lags of implementing fiscal policy, countries should use discretionary fiscal policy with caution.\nHowever, the aftermath of the Recession emphasizes that expansionary fiscal and monetary policies do not\nturn off a recession like flipping a switch turns off a lamp. Even after a recession is officially over, and positive\ngrowth has returned, it can take some months\u2014or even a couple of years\u2014before private-sector firms believe\nthe economic climate is healthy enough that they can expand their workforce. 778 32 \u2022 Macroeconomic Policy Around the World\nThe Natural Rate of Unemployment\nUnemployment rates in European nations have typically been higher than in the United States. In 2020, before\nthe start of theCOVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. unemployment rate was 3.5%, compared with 8.5% in France,\n10% in Italy, and 7.1% in Sweden. We can attribute the pattern of generally higher unemployment rates in\nEurope, which dates back to the 1970s, to the fact that European economies have a higher natural rate of\nunemployment because they have a greater number of rules and restrictions that discourage firms from hiring\nand unemployed workers from taking jobs.\nAddressing the natural rate of unemployment is straightforward in theory but difficult in practice. Government\ncan play a useful role in providing unemployment and welfare payments, for example, by passing rules about\nwhere and when businesses can operate, and assuring that the workplace is safe. However, these well-\nintentioned laws can, in some cases, become so intrusive that businesses decide to place limits on their hiring.\nFor example, a law that imposes large costs on a business that tries to fire or lay off workers will mean that\nbusinesses try to avoid hiring in the first place, as is the case in France. According toBusiness Week, \u201cFrance\nhas 2.4 times as many companies with 49 employees as with 50 ... according to the French labor code, once a\ncompany has at least 50 employees inside France, management must create three worker councils, introduce\nprofit sharing, and submit restructuring plans to the councils if the company decides to fire workers for\neconomic reasons.\u201d This labor law essentially limits employment (or raises the natural rate of unemployment).\nUndeveloped and Transitioning Labor Markets\nLow-income and middle-income countries face employment issues that go beyond unemployment as it is\nunderstood in the high-income economies. A substantial number of workers in these economies provide many\nof their own needs by farming, fishing, or hunting. They barter and trade with others and may take a\nsuccession of short-term or one-day jobs, sometimes receiving pay with food or shelter, sometimes with\nmoney. They are not \u201cunemployed\u201d in the sense that we use the term in the United States and Europe, but\nneither are they employed in a regular wage-paying job.\nThe starting point of economic activity, as we discussed inWelcome to Economics!, is the division of labor, in\nwhich workers specialize in certain tasks and trade the fruits of their labor with others. Workers who are not\nconnected to a labor market are often unable to specialize very much. Because these workers are not\n\u201cofficially\u201d employed, they are often not eligible for social benefits like unemployment insurance or old-age\npayments\u2014if such payments are even available in their country. Helping these workers to become more\nconnected to the labor market and the economy is an important policy goal. Recent research by development\neconomists suggests that one of the key factors in raising people in low-income countries out of the worst kind\nof poverty is whether they can make a connection to a somewhat regular wage-paying job.\nEconomist Sir W. Arthur Lewis examined such transitions of labor and the impact on economic development.\nHis core theoretical framework\u2014the dual sector economy\u2014proposes that, essentially, the marginal product of\nlow-skilled workers is greater in the manufacturing sector than it is in the agricultural sector. That\u2019s because\nmost agricultural societies are both mature and have fixed inputs (land, water, and related resources); the\nmarginal product of additional farmers on that land is nearly zero, creating what Lewis termed \u201csurplus\nworkers.\u201d Early-stage manufacturing sectors, however, have great need for low-skilled workers, and can make\nbetter use (greater marginal product) of them. Their wages will remain low, but as stated above, the wages are\nmore likely to be consistent and therefore move toward a large-scale transition of the labor force.\nWe have seen this practically in many nations experiencing a shift in labor, particularly in China. In many\nregions, it is marked by a level of migration\u2014people leaving rural areas for cities or manufacturing zones. At\nsome point, nations achieve what economists call the Lewis turning point, in which the surplus agricultural\nlabor is fully absorbed into the manufacturing sector. Typically, when this occurs, wages in both agricultural\nand manufacturing sectors begin to rise in a sustainable manner. Despite massive transformation in the\nChinese economy over the past decades, economists dispute whether China has actually reached the Lewis\nAccess for free at openstax.org 32.4 \u2022 Causes of Inflation in Various Countries and Regions 779\nturning point.\nEconomic transition is not without its downsides. Many manufacturing-focused countries still rely heavily on\ntheir agricultural sectors for their own sustenance and as a core part of international trade. As the agricultural\nsector faces competition from manufacturing, and as people physically leave rural areas, farming economies\ncan suffer downturns and unpredictability. Finally, countries or individual farmers seeking to make up for\ntheir missing labor may encourage migration and/or immigration that may cause political or financial conflict.\n32.4Causes of Inflation in Various Countries and Regions\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Identify the causes and effects of inflation in various economic markets\n\u2022 Explain the significance of a converging economy\nPolicymakers of the high-income economies appear to have learned some lessons about fightinginflation.\nFirst, whatever happens with aggregate supply and aggregate demand in the short run, countries can use\nmonetary policy to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched in the economy in the medium and long term.\nSecond, there is no long-run gain to letting inflation become established. In fact, allowing inflation to become\nlasting and persistent poses undesirable risks and tradeoffs. When inflation is high, businesses and\nindividuals need to spend time and effort worrying about protecting themselves against inflation, rather than\nseeking better ways to serve customers. In short, the high-income economies appear to have both a political\nconsensus to hold inflation low and the economic tools to do so. Despite this, periods of growing inflation can\nstagnate economic growth and lead to significant political consequences for leaders. In 2022, the U.S. inflation\nrate reached 9.1%, an unexpected peak that the country hadn't seen since 1981. As is often the case, President\nJoe Biden was held politically responsible, and negotiated with Congress to pass a massive economic and\nclimate bill titled the Inflation Reduction Act.\nIn a number of middle- and low-income economies around the world, inflation is far from a solved problem. In\nthe early 2000s, Turkey experienced inflation of more than 50% per year for several years and continues to\nexperience high inflation today. Belarus had inflation of about 100% per year from 2000 to 2001. From 2008 to\n2010, Venezuela and Myanmar had inflation rates of 20% to 30% per year. Indonesia, Iran, Nigeria, the Russian\nFederation, and Ukraine all had double-digit inflation for most of the years from 2000 to 2010. Zimbabwe had\nhyperinflation, with inflation rates that went from more than 100% per year in the mid-2000s to a rate of\nseveral million percent in 2008.\nIn these countries, the problem of very high inflation generally arises from huge budget deficits, which the\ngovernment finances by printing its domestic currency. This is a case of \u201ctoo much money chasing too few\ngoods.\u201d In the case of Venezuela, beginning in 2016 the government covered its widening deficits by printing\never higher currency notes, with inflation reaching 1,000,000% by 2018. The crisis continues today, with high\nrates of inflation and high unemployment (over 40%). There is some discussion of dollarization, or a\nconversion from Venezuelan bolivars to U.S. dollars as the main currency, as a solution to the hyperinflation.\nEven in 2019, over 50% of transactions in Venezuela were reportedly using U.S. dollars, and banks issued debit\ncards denominated in U.S. dollars in 2021.\nA number of countries have managed to sustain solid levels of economic growth for sustained periods of time\nwith inflation levels that would sound high by recent U.S. standards, like 10% to 30% per year. In such\neconomies, the governments index most contracts, wage levels, and interest rates to inflation. Indexing wage\ncontracts and interest rates means that they will increase when inflation increases to retain purchasing power.\nWhen wages do not rise as price levels rise, this leads to a decline in the real wage rate and a decrease in the\nstandard of living. Likewise, interest rates that are not indexed mean that money lenders will receive payment\nin devalued currency and will also lose purchasing power on monies that they lent. It is clearly possible\u2014and\nperhaps sometimes necessary\u2014for aconverging economy(the economy of a country that demonstrates the 780 32 \u2022 Macroeconomic Policy Around the World\nability to catch up to the technology leaders) to live with a degree of uncertainty over inflation that would be\npolitically unacceptable in the high-income economies.\n32.5Balance of Trade Concerns\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain the meaning of trade balance and its implications for the foreign exchange market\n\u2022 Analyze concerns over international trade in goods and services and international flows of capital\n\u2022 Identify and evaluate market-oriented economic reforms\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, and even into the 1970s, low- and middle-income countries often viewed openness to\nglobal flows of goods, services, and financial capital in a negative light. These countries feared that foreign\ntrade would mean both economic losses as high-income trading partners \"exploited\" their economy and they\nlost domestic political control to powerful business interests and multinational corporations.\nThese negative feelings about international trade have evolved. After all, the great economic success stories of\nrecent years like Japan, the East Asian Tiger economies, China, and India, all took advantage of opportunities\nto sell in global markets. European economies thrive with high levels of trade. In theNorth American Free\n1\nTrade Agreement (NAFTA), the United States, Canada, and Mexico pledged themselves to reduce trade\nbarriers. Many countries have clearly learned that reducing barriers to trade is at least potentially beneficial to\nthe economy. Many smaller world economies have learned an even tougher lesson: if they do not participate\nactively in world trade, they are unlikely to join the success stories among the converging economies. There\nare no examples in world history of small economies that remained apart from the global economy but still\nattained a high standard of living.\nAlthough almost every country now claims that its goal is to participate in global trade, the possible negative\nconsequences have remained highly controversial. It is useful to divide these possible negative consequences\ninto issues involving trade of goods and services and issues involving international capital flows. These issues\nare related, but not the same. An economy may have a high level of trade in goods and services relative to GDP,\nbut if exports and imports are balanced, the net flow of foreign investment in and out of the economy will be\nzero. Conversely, an economy may have only a moderate level of trade relative to GDP, but find that it has a\nsubstantial current account trade imbalance. Thus, it is useful to consider the concerns over international\ntrade of goods and services and international flows of financial capital separately.\nConcerns over International Trade in Goods and Services\nThere is a long list of worries about foreign trade in goods and services: fear of job loss, environmental\ndangers, unfair labor practices, and many other concerns. We discuss these arguments at some length in the\nchapter onThe International Trade and Capital Flows.\nOf all of the arguments for limitations on trade, perhaps the most controversial one among economists is the\ninfant industry argument; that is, subsidizing or protecting new industries for a time until they become\nestablished. (Globalization and Protectionismexplains this concept in more detail.) Countries have used such\npolicies with some success at certain points in time, but in the world as a whole, support for key industries is\nfar more often directed at long-established industries with substantial political power that are suffering losses\nand laying off workers, rather than potentially vibrant new industries that are not yet established. If\ngovernment intends to favor certain industries, it needs to do so in a way that is temporary and that orients\nthem toward a future of market competition, rather than a future of unending government subsidies and trade\nprotection.\n1 As of July 1, 2020, NAFTA was officially replaced with the United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) free trade agreement. It is\nbroadly similar to the original NAFTA.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 32.5 \u2022 Balance of Trade Concerns 781\nConcerns over International Flows of Capital\nRecall fromThe Macroeconomic Perspectivethat atrade deficitexists when a nation\u2019s imports exceed its\nexports. In order for a trade deficit to take place, foreign countries must provide loans or investments, which\nthey are willing to do because they expect eventual repayment (that the deficit will become a surplus). Atrade\nsurplus, you may remember, exists when a nation\u2019s exports exceed its imports. Thus, in order for a trade deficit\nto switch to a trade surplus, a nation\u2019s exports must rise and its imports must fall. Sometimes this happens\nwhen the currency decreases in value. For example, if the U.S. had a trade deficit and the dollar depreciated,\nimports would become more expensive. This would, in turn, benefit the foreign countries that provided the\nloans or investments.\nThe expected pattern of trade imbalances in the world economy has been that high-income economies will run\ntrade surpluses, which means they will experience a net outflow of capital to foreign destinations or export\nmore than they import, while low- and middle-income economies will run trade deficits, which means that\nthey will experience a net inflow of foreign capital.\nThis international investing pattern can benefit all sides. Investors in the high-income countries benefit\nbecause they can receive high returns on their investments, and also because they can diversify their\ninvestments so that they are at less risk of a downturn in their own domestic economy. The low-income\neconomies that receive an inflow of capital presumably have potential for rapid catch-up economic growth,\nand they can use the international financial capital inflow to help spur their physical capital investment. In\naddition, financial capital inflows often come with management abilities, technological expertise, and training.\nHowever, for the last couple of decades, this cheerful scenario has faced two \u201cdark clouds.\u201d The first cloud is\nthe very large trade or current account deficits in the U.S. economy. (SeeThe International Trade and Capital\nFlows.) Instead of offering net financial investment abroad, the U.S. economy is soaking up savings from all\nover the world. These substantial U.S. trade deficits may not be sustainable according toSebastian Edwards\nwriting for theNational Bureau of Economic Research. While trade deficits on their own are not bad, the\nquestion is whether governments will reduce them gradually or hastily. In the gradual scenario, U.S. exports\ncould grow more rapidly than imports over a period of years, aided by U.S. dollar depreciation. An unintended\nconsequence of the slow growth since the Great Recession has been a decline in the U.S. current account\ndeficit's from 6% pre-recession to 3% most recently.\nThe other option is that the government could reduce the U.S. trade deficit in a rush. Here is one scenario: if\nforeign investors became less willing to hold U.S. dollar assets, the dollar exchange rate could weaken. As\nspeculators see this process happening, they might rush to unload their dollar assets, which would drive the\ndollar down still further.\nA lower U.S. dollar would stimulate aggregate demand by making exports cheaper and imports more\nexpensive. It would mean higher prices for imported inputs throughout the economy, shifting the short-term\naggregate supply curve to the left. The result could be a burst of inflation and, if theFederal Reservewere to\nrun a tight monetary policy to reduce the inflation, it could also lead to recession. People sometimes talk as if\nthe U.S. economy, with its great size, is invulnerable to this sort of pressure from international markets. While\nit is difficult to rock, it is not impossible for the $17 trillion U.S. economy to face these international pressures.\nThe second \u201cdark cloud\u201d is how the smaller world economies should deal with the possibility of sudden foreign\nfinancial capital inflows and outflows. Perhaps the most vivid recent example of the potentially destructive\nforces of international capital movements occurred in the East Asian Tiger economies in 1997\u20131998. Thanks\nto their excellent growth performance over the previous few decades, these economies had attracted\nconsiderable interest from foreign investors. In the mid-1990s, however, foreign investment into these\ncountries surged even further. Much of this money funneled through banks that borrowed in U.S. dollars and\nloaned in their national currencies. Bank lending surged at rates of 20% per year or more. This inflow of\nforeign capital meant that investment in these economies exceeded the level of domestic savings, so that 782 32 \u2022 Macroeconomic Policy Around the World\ncurrent account deficits in these countries jumped into the 5\u201310% GDP range.\nThe surge in bank lending meant that many banks in these East Asian countries did not do an especially good\njob of screening out safe and unsafe borrowers. Many of the loans\u2014as high as 10% to 15% of all loans in some\nof these countries\u2014started to turn bad. Fearing losses, foreign investors started pulling out their money. As the\nforeign money left, the exchange rates of these countries crashed, often falling by 50% or more in a few\nmonths. The banks were stuck with a mismatch: even if the rest of their domestic loans were repaid, they could\nnever pay back the U.S. dollars that they owed. The banking sector as a whole went bankrupt. The lack of credit\nand lending in the economy collapsed aggregate demand, bringing on a deep recession.\nIf the flow and ebb of international capital markets can flip even the economies of the East Asian Tigers, with\ntheir stellar growth records, into a recession, then it is no wonder that other middle- and low-income countries\naround the world are concerned. Moreover, similar episodes of an inflow and then an outflow of foreign\nfinancial capital have rocked a number of economies around the world: for example, in the last few years,\neconomies like Ireland, Iceland, and Greece have all experienced severe shocks when foreign lenders decided\nto stop extending funds. Especially in Greece, this caused the government to enact austerity measures which\nled to protests throughout the country (Figure 32.7).\nFIGURE32.7Protests in GreeceThe economic conditions in Greece have deteriorated from the Great Recession\nsuch that the government had to enact austerity measures, (strict rules) cutting wages and increasing taxes on its\npopulation. Massive protests are but one byproduct. (Credit: modification of work by Apostolos/Flickr Creative\nCommons)\nMany nations are taking steps to reduce the risk that their economy will be injured if foreign financial capital\ntakes flight, including having their central banks hold large reserves of foreign exchange and stepping up their\nregulation of domestic banks to avoid a wave of imprudent lending. The most controversial steps in this area\ninvolve whether countries should try to take steps to control or reduce the flows of foreign capital. If a country\ncould discourage some speculative short-term capital inflow, and instead only encourage investment capital\nthat it committed for the medium and the long term, then it could be at least somewhat less susceptible to\nswings in the sentiments of global investors.\nIf economies participate in the global trade of goods and services, they will also need to participate in\ninternational flows of financial payments and investments. These linkages can offer great benefits to an\neconomy. However, any nation that is experiencing a substantial and sustained pattern of trade deficits, along\nwith the corresponding net inflow of international financial capital, has some reason for concern. During the\nAsian Financial Crisisin the late 1990s, countries that grew dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis as\ninternational capital flowed in, saw their economies collapse when the capital very quickly flowed out.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 32.5 \u2022 Balance of Trade Concerns 783\nMarket-Oriented Economic Reforms\nThe standard of living has increased dramatically for billions of people around the world in the last half\ncentury. Such increases have occurred not only in the technological leaders like the United States, Canada, the\nnations of Europe, and Japan, but also in the East Asian Tigers and in many nations of Latin America and\nEastern Europe. The challenge for most of these countries is to maintain these growth rates. The economically-\nchallenged regions of the world have stagnated and become stuck in poverty traps. These countries need to\nfocus on the basics: health and education, or human capital development. AsFigure 32.8illustrates, modern\ntechnology allows for the investment in education and human capital development in ways that would have not\nbeen possible just a few short years ago.\nFIGURE32.8Solar-powered TechnologyModern technologies, such as solar-power and Wi-Fi, enable students to\nobtain education even in remote parts of a country without electricity. These students in Ghana are sharing a laptop\nprovided by a van with solar-power. (Credit: \u201cHands on computer class - children in Ho, Volta Region, Ghana\u201d by\nEIFL/Flickr Creative Commons, CC BY 2.0)\nOther than the issue of economic growth, the other three main goals of macroeconomic policy\u2014that is, low\nunemployment, low inflation, and a sustainable balance of trade\u2014all involve situations in which, for some\nreason, the economy fails to coordinate the forces of supply and demand. In the case of cyclical\nunemployment, for example, the intersection of aggregate supply and aggregate demand occurs at a level of\noutput below potential GDP. In the case of the natural rate of unemployment, government regulations create a\nsituation where otherwise-willing employers become unwilling to hire otherwise-willing workers. Inflation is a\nsituation in which aggregate demand outstrips aggregate supply, at least for a time, so that too much buying\npower is chasing too few goods. A trade imbalance is a situation where, because of a net inflow or outflow of\nforeign capital, domestic savings are not aligned with domestic investment. Each of these situations can create\na range of easier or harder policy choices.\nBRING IT HOME\nYouth Unemployment\nSpain and South Africa had the same high youth unemployment in 2020, but the reasons for this unemployment are\ndifferent. Spain\u2019s current account balance is negative, which means it is borrowing heavily. To cure cyclical\nunemployment during a recession, the Keynesian model suggests increases in government spending\u2014fiscal\nexpansion or monetary expansion. Neither option is open to Spain. It currently can borrow at only high interest\nrates, which will be a real problem in terms of debt service. In addition, the rest of the European Union (EU) has\ndragged its feet when it comes to debt forgiveness. Monetary expansion is not possible because Spain uses the euro\nand cannot devalue its currency unless it convinces all of the EU to do so. What can be done? TheEconomist, 784 32 \u2022 Macroeconomic Policy Around the World\nsummarizing some ideas of economists and policymakers, suggests that Spain\u2019s only realistic (although painful)\noption is to reduce government-mandated wages, which would allow it to reduce government spending. As a result,\nthe government would be able to lower tax rates on the working population. With a lower wage or lower tax\nenvironment, firms will hire more workers. This will lower unemployment and stimulate the economy. Spain can also\nencourage greater foreign investment and try to promote policies that encourage domestic savings.\nSouth Africa has more of a natural rate of unemployment problem. It is an interesting case because its youth\nunemployment is mostly because its young are not ready to work. Economists commonly refer to this as an\nemployability problem. According to interviews of South African firms as reported in theEconomist, the young are\nacademically smart but lack practical skills for the workplace. Despite a big push to increase investment in human\ncapital, the results have not yet borne fruit. Recently the government unveiled a plan to pay unemployed youth while\nthey were \u201ctrained-up\u201d or apprenticed in South African firms. The government has room to increase fiscal\nexpenditure, encourage domestic savings, and continue to fund investment in education, vocational training, and\napprentice programs. South Africa can also improve the climate for foreign investment from technology leaders,\nwhich would encourage economic growth.\nIndia has a smaller youth employment problem in terms of percentages. However, bear in mind that since this is a\npopulous country, it turns out to be a significant problem in raw numbers. According to Kaushik Basu, writing for the\nBBC, \u201cthere are 45 national laws governing the hiring and firing decisions of firms and close to four times that\namount at the state level\u201d. These laws make it difficult for companies to fire workers. To stay nimble and responsive\nto markets, Indian companies respond to these laws by hiring fewer workers. The Indian government can do much\nto solve this problem by adjusting its labor laws. Essentially, the government has to remove itself from firms\u2019 hiring\nand firing decisions, so that growing Indian firms can freely employ more workers. Indian workers, like those in\nSouth Africa, do not have workforce skills. Again, the government can increase its spending on education, vocational\ntraining, and workforce readiness programs.\nFinally, India has a significant current account deficit. This deficit is mainly a result of short- and long-term capital\nflows. To solve this deficit, India has experimented by lifting the limitation on domestic savers from investing\nabroad. This is a step in the right direction that may dampen the growth in the current account deficit. A final policy\npossibility is to improve domestic capital markets so many self-employed Indians can obtain access to capital to\nrealize their business ideas. If more Indians can obtain access to capital to start businesses, employment might\nincrease.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 32 \u2022 Key Terms 785\nKey Terms\nconverging economy economy of a country that has demonstrated the ability to catch up to the technology\nleaders by investing in both physical and human capital\nEast Asian Tigers the economies of Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and South Korea, which maintained high\ngrowth rates and rapid export-led industrialization between the early 1960s and 1990 allowing them to\nconverge with the technological leaders in high-income countries\ngrowth consensus a series of studies that show, statistically, that 70% of the differences in income per person\nacross the world is explained by differences in physical capital (savings/investment)\nhigh-income country nation with a per capita income of $12,475 or more; typically has high levels of human\nand physical capital\nlow-income country a nation that has a per capita income of less than $1,025; a third of the world\u2019s\npopulation\nmiddle-income country a nation with per capita income between $1,025 and $12, 475 and that has shown\nsome ability, even if not always sustained, to catch up to the technology leaders in high-income countries\nKey Concepts and Summary\n32.1The Diversity of Countries and Economies across the World\nMacroeconomic policy goals for most countries strive toward low levels of unemployment and inflation, as well\nas stable trade balances. Economists analyze countries based on their GDP per person and ranked as low-,\nmiddle-, and high-income countries. Low-income are those earning less than $1,025 (less than 1%) of global\nincome. They currently have 18.5% of the world population. Middle-income countries are those with per\ncapital income of $1,025\u2013$12,475 (31.1% of global income). They have 69.5% of world population. High-\nincome countries are those with per capita income greater than $12,475 (68.3% of global income). They have\n12% of the world\u2019s population. Regional comparisons tend to be inaccurate because even countries within\nthose regions tend to differ from each other.\n32.2Improving Countries\u2019 Standards of Living\nThe fundamentals of growth are the same in every country: improvements in human capital, physical capital,\nand technology interacting in a market-oriented economy. Countries that are high-income tend to focus on\ndeveloping and using new technology. Countries that are middle-income focus on increasing human capital\nand becoming more connected to technology and global markets. They have charted unconventional paths by\nrelying more on state-led support rather than relying solely on markets. Low-income, economically-challenged\ncountries have many health and human development needs, but they are also challenged by the lack of\ninvestment and foreign aid to develop infrastructure like roads. There are some bright spots when it comes to\nfinancial development and mobile communications, which suggest that low-income countries can become\ntechnology leaders in their own right, but it is too early to claim victory. These countries must do more to\nconnect to the rest of the global economy and find the technologies that work best for them.\n32.3Causes of Unemployment around the World\nWe can address cyclical unemployment by expansionary fiscal and monetary policy. The natural rate of\nunemployment can be harder to solve, because it involves thinking carefully about the tradeoffs involved in\nlaws that affect employment and hiring. Unemployment is understood differently in high-income countries\ncompared to low- and middle-income countries. People in these countries are not \u201cunemployed\u201d in the sense\nthat we use the term in the United States and Europe, but neither are they employed in a regular wage-paying\njob. While some may have regular wage-paying jobs, others are part of a barter economy.\n32.4Causes of Inflation in Various Countries and Regions\nMost high-income economies have learned that their central banks can control inflation in the medium and\nthe long term. In addition, they have learned that inflation has no long-term benefits but potentially 786 32 \u2022 Self-Check Questions\nsubstantial long-term costs if it distracts businesses from focusing on real productivity gains. However,\nsmaller economies around the world may face more volatile inflation because their smaller economies can be\nunsettled by international movements of capital and goods.\n32.5Balance of Trade Concerns\nThere are many legitimate concerns over possible negative consequences of free trade. Perhaps the single\nstrongest response to these concerns is that there are good ways to address them without restricting trade and\nthus losing its benefits. There are two major issues involving trade imbalances. One is what will happen with\nthe large U.S. trade deficits, and whether they will come down gradually or with a rush. The other is whether\nsmaller countries around the world should take some steps to limit flows of international capital, in the hope\nthat they will not be quite so susceptible to economic whiplash from international financial capital flowing in\nand out of their economies.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

In\ninternational trade, there are often \u201cconflicts\u201d like this as each country or company focuses on what it does best.\n(Credit: modification of \u201ciPhone 4's Retina Display v.s. iPhone 3G\u201d by Yutaka Tsutano/Flickr Creative Commons, CC\nBY 2.0)\nCHAPTER OBJECTIVES\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\u2022 Absolute and Comparative Advantage\n\u2022 What Happens When a Country Has an Absolute Advantage in All Goods\n\u2022 Intra-industry Trade between Similar Economies\n\u2022 The Benefits of Reducing Barriers to International Trade\nIntroduction to International Trade\nBRING IT HOME\nJust Whose iPhone Is It?\nThe iPhone is a global product. Apple does not manufacture the iPhone components, nor does it assemble them.\nThe assembly is done by Foxconn Corporation, a Taiwanese company, at its factories in China and India. But,\nSamsung, the electronics firm and competitor to Apple, actually supplies many of the parts that make up an iPhone.\nIn earlier models, Samsung parts made up as much as 26% of the total costs of production. And in more recent\nversions, Samsung manufactures the displays and cameras. In some ways, then, Samsung is both the biggest 790 33 \u2022 International Trade\nsupplier and biggest competitor for Apple. Why do these two firms work together to produce the iPhone? To\nunderstand the economic logic behind international trade, you have to accept, as these firms do, that trade is about\nmutually beneficial exchange. Samsung is one of the world\u2019s largest electronics parts suppliers. Apple lets Samsung\nfocus on making the best parts, which allows Apple to concentrate on its strength\u2014designing elegant products that\nare easy to use. If each company (and by extension each country) focuses on what it does best, there will be gains\nfor all through trade.\nWe live in a global marketplace. The food on your table might include fresh fruit from Chile, cheese from\nFrance, and bottled water from Scotland. Your wireless phone might have been made in Taiwan or Korea. The\nclothes you wear might be designed in Italy and manufactured in China. The toys you give to a child might have\ncome from India. The car you drive might come from Japan, Germany, or Korea. The gasoline in the tank might\nbe refined from crude oil from Saudi Arabia, Mexico, or Nigeria. As a worker, if your job is involved with\nfarming, machinery, airplanes, cars, scientific instruments, or many other technology-related industries, the\nodds are good that a hearty proportion of the sales of your employer\u2014and hence the money that pays your\nsalary\u2014comes from export sales. We are all linked by international trade, and the volume of that trade has\ngrown dramatically in the last few decades.\nThe first wave ofglobalizationstarted in the nineteenth century and lasted up to the beginning of World War I.\nOver that time, global exports as a share of global GDP rose from less than 1% of GDP in 1820 to 9% of GDP in\n1913. As the Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman of Princeton University wrote in 1995:\nIt is a late-twentieth-century conceit that we invented the global economy just yesterday. In fact, world\nmarkets achieved an impressive degree of integration during the second half of the nineteenth\ncentury. Indeed, if one wants a specific date for the beginning of a truly global economy, one might\nwell choose 1869, the year in which both the Suez Canal and the Union Pacific railroad were\ncompleted. By the eve of the First World War steamships and railroads had created markets for\nstandardized commodities, like wheat and wool, that were fully global in their reach. Even the global\nflow of information was better than modern observers, focused on electronic technology, tend to\nrealize: the first submarine telegraph cable was laid under the Atlantic in 1858, and by 1900 all of the\nworld\u2019s major economic regions could effectively communicate instantaneously.\nThis first wave of globalization crashed to a halt early in the twentieth century. World War I severed many\neconomic connections. During theGreat Depressionof the 1930s, many nations misguidedly tried to fix their\nown economies by reducing foreign trade with others. World War II further hindered international trade.\nGlobal flows of goods and financial capital were rebuilt only slowly after World War II. It was not until the early\n1980s that global economic forces again became as important, relative to the size of the world economy, as\nthey were before World War I.\n33.1Absolute and Comparative Advantage\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Define absolute advantage, comparative advantage, and opportunity costs\n\u2022 Explain the gains of trade created when a country specializes\nThe American statesman Benjamin Franklin (1706\u20131790) once wrote: \u201cNo nation was ever ruined by trade.\u201d\nMany economists would express their attitudes toward international trade in an even more positive manner.\nThe evidence that international trade confers overall benefits on economies is pretty strong. Trade has\naccompanied economic growth in the United States and around the world. Many of the national economies\nthat have shown the most rapid growth in the last several decades\u2014for example, Japan, South Korea, China,\nand India\u2014have done so by dramatically orienting their economies toward international trade. There is no\nmodern example of a country that has shut itself off from world trade and yet prospered. To understand the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 33.1 \u2022 Absolute and Comparative Advantage 791\nbenefits of trade, or why we trade in the first place, we need to understand the concepts of comparative and\nabsolute advantage.\nIn 1817,David Ricardo, a businessman, economist, and member of the British Parliament, wrote a treatise\ncalledOn the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation. In this treatise, Ricardo argued that specialization\nand free trade benefit all trading partners, even those that may be relatively inefficient. To see what he meant,\nwe must be able to distinguish between absolute and comparative advantage.\nA country has anabsolute advantageover another country in producing a good if it uses fewer resources to\nproduce that good. Absolute advantage can be the result of a country\u2019s natural endowment. For example,\nextracting oil in Saudi Arabia is pretty much just a matter of \u201cdrilling a hole.\u201d Producing oil in other countries\ncan require considerable exploration and costly technologies for drilling and extraction\u2014if they have any oil at\nall. The United States has some of the richest farmland in the world, making it easier to grow corn and wheat\nthan in many other countries. Guatemala and Colombia have climates especially suited for growing coffee.\nChile and Zambia have some of the world\u2019s richest copper mines. As some have argued, \u201cgeography is destiny.\u201d\nChile will provide copper and Guatemala will produce coffee, and they will trade. When each country has a\nproduct others need and it can produce it with fewer resources in one country than in another, then it is easy to\nimagine all parties benefitting from trade. However, thinking about trade just in terms of geography and\nabsolute advantage is incomplete. Trade really occurs because of comparative advantage.\nRecall from the chapterChoice in a World of Scarcitythat a country has acomparative advantagewhen it can\nproduce a good at a lower cost in terms of other goods. The question each country or company should be\nasking when it trades is this: \u201cWhat do we give up to produce this good?\u201d It should be no surprise that the\nconcept of comparative advantage is based on this idea ofopportunity costfromChoice in a World of Scarcity.\nFor example, if Zambia focuses its resources on producing copper, it cannot use its labor, land and financial\nresources to produce other goods such as corn. As a result, Zambia gives up the opportunity to produce corn.\nHow do we quantify the cost in terms of other goods? Simplify the problem and assume that Zambia just needs\nlabor to produce copper and corn. The companies that produce either copper or corn tell you that it takes two\nhours to mine a ton of copper and one hour to harvest a bushel of corn. This means the opportunity cost of\nproducing a ton of copper is two bushels of corn. The next section develops absolute and comparative\nadvantage in greater detail and relates them to trade.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/WTO)for a list of articles and podcasts pertaining to international trade\ntopics.\nA Numerical Example of Absolute and Comparative Advantage\nConsider a hypothetical world with two countries, Saudi Arabia and the United States, and two products, oil\nand corn. Further assume that consumers in both countries desire both these goods. These goods are\nhomogeneous, meaning that consumers/producers cannot differentiate between corn or oil from either\ncountry. There is only one resource available in both countries, labor hours. Saudi Arabia can produce oil with\nfewer resources, while the United States can produce corn with fewer resources.Table 33.1illustrates the\nadvantages of the two countries, expressed in terms of how many hours it takes to produce one unit of each\ngood. 792 33 \u2022 International Trade\nCountry Oil (hours per barrel) Corn (hours per bushel)\nSaudi Arabia 1 4\nUnited States 2 1\nTABLE33.1How Many Hours It Takes to Produce Oil and Corn\nInTable 33.1, Saudi Arabia has an absolute advantage in producing oil because it only takes an hour to\nproduce a barrel of oil compared to two hours in the United States. The United States has an absolute\nadvantage in producing corn.\nTo simplify, let\u2019s say that Saudi Arabia and the United States each have 100 worker hours (seeTable 33.2).\nFigure 33.2illustrates what each country is capable of producing on its own using aproduction possibility\nfrontier (PPF)graph. Recall fromChoice in a World of Scarcitythat the production possibilities frontier shows\nthe maximum amount that each country can produce given its limited resources, in this case workers, and its\nlevel of technology.\nOil Production using 100 worker hours Corn Production using 100 worker hours\nCountry\n(barrels) (bushels)\nSaudi\n100 or 25\nArabia\nUnited\n50 or 100\nStates\nTABLE33.2Production Possibilities before Trade\nFIGURE33.2Production Possibilities Frontiers(a) Saudi Arabia can produce 100 barrels of oil at maximum and\nzero corn (point A), or 25 bushels of corn and zero oil (point B). It can also produce other combinations of oil and\ncorn if it wants to consume both goods, such as at point C. Here it chooses to produce/consume 60 barrels of oil,\nleaving 40 work hours that to allocate to produce 10 bushels of corn, using the data inTable 33.1. (b) If the United\nStates produces only oil, it can produce, at maximum, 50 barrels and zero corn (point A'), or at the other extreme, it\ncan produce a maximum of 100 bushels of corn and no oil (point B'). Other combinations of both oil and corn are\npossible, such as point C'. All points above the frontiers are impossible to produce given the current level of\nAccess for free at openstax.org 33.1 \u2022 Absolute and Comparative Advantage 793\nresources and technology.\nArguably Saudi and U.S. consumers desire both oil and corn to live. Let\u2019s say that before trade occurs, both\ncountries produce and consume at point C or C'. Thus, before trade, the Saudi Arabian economy will devote 60\nworker hours to produce oil, asTable 33.3shows. Given the information inTable 33.1, this choice implies that\nit produces/consumes 60 barrels of oil. With the remaining 40 worker hours, since it needs four hours to\nproduce a bushel of corn, it can produce only 10 bushels. To be at point C', the U.S. economy devotes 40 worker\nhours to produce 20 barrels of oil and it can allocate the remaining worker hours to produce 60 bushels of\ncorn.\nCountry Oil Production (barrels) Corn Production (bushels)\nSaudi Arabia (C) 60 10\nUnited States (C') 20 60\nTotal World Production 80 70\nTABLE33.3Production before Trade\nThe slope of the production possibility frontier illustrates the opportunity cost of producing oil in terms of\ncorn. Using all its resources, the United States can produce 50 barrels of oilor100 bushels of corn; therefore,\nthe opportunity cost of one barrel of oil is two bushels of corn\u2014or the slope is 1/2. Thus, in the U.S. production\npossibility frontier graph, every increase in oil production of one barrel implies a decrease of two bushels of\ncorn. Saudi Arabia can produce 100 barrels of oilor25 bushels of corn. The opportunity cost of producing one\nbarrel of oil is the loss of 1/4 of a bushel of corn that Saudi workers could otherwise have produced. In terms of\ncorn, notice that Saudi Arabia gives up the least to produce a barrel of oil.Table 33.4summarizes these\ncalculations.\nOpportunity cost of one unit \u2014 Oil (in terms of Opportunity cost of one unit \u2014 Corn (in terms\nCountry\ncorn) of oil)\nSaudi\n\u00bc 4\nArabia\nUnited\n2 \u00bd\nStates\nTABLE33.4Opportunity Cost and Comparative Advantage\nAgain recall that we defined comparative advantage as the opportunity cost of producing goods. Since Saudi\nArabia gives up the least to produce a barrel of oil, ( < inTable 33.4) it has a comparative advantage in oil\nproduction. The United States gives up the least to produce a bushel of corn, so it has a comparative advantage\nin corn production.\nIn this example, there is symmetry between absolute and comparative advantage. Saudi Arabia needs fewer\nworker hours to produce oil (absolute advantage, seeTable 33.1), and also gives up the least in terms of other\ngoods to produce oil (comparative advantage, seeTable 33.4). Such symmetry is not always the case, as we will\nshow after we have discussed gains from trade fully, but first, read the following Clear It Up feature to make\nsure you understand why the PPF line in the graphs is straight. 794 33 \u2022 International Trade\nCLEAR IT UP\nCan a production possibility frontier be straight?\nWhen you first met the production possibility frontier (PPF) in the chapter onChoice in a World of Scarcitywe drew it\nwith an outward-bending shape. This shape illustrated that as we transferred inputs from producing one good to\nanother\u2014like from education to health services\u2014there were increasing opportunity costs. In the examples in this\nchapter, we draw the PPFs as straight lines, which means that opportunity costs are constant. When we transfer a\nmarginal unit of labor away from growing corn and toward producing oil, the decline in the quantity of corn and the\nincrease in the quantity of oil is always the same. In reality this is possible only if the contribution of additional\nworkers to output did not change as the scale of production changed. The linear production possibilities frontier is a\nless realistic model, but a straight line simplifies calculations. It also illustrates economic themes like absolute and\ncomparative advantage just as clearly.\nGains from Trade\nConsider the trading positions of the United States and Saudi Arabia after they have specialized and traded.\nBefore trade, Saudi Arabia produces/consumes 60 barrels of oil and 10 bushels of corn. The United States\nproduces/consumes 20 barrels of oil and 60 bushels of corn. Given their current production levels, if the\nUnited States can trade an amount of corn fewer than 60 bushels and receive in exchange an amount of oil\ngreater than 20 barrels, it willgain from trade. With trade, the United States can consume more of both goods\nthan it did withoutspecializationand trade. (Recall that the chapterWelcome to Economics!defined\nspecialization as it applies to workers and firms. Economists also use specialization to describe the occurrence\nwhen a country shifts resources to focus on producing a good that offers comparative advantage.) Similarly, if\nSaudi Arabia can trade an amount of oil less than 60 barrels and receive in exchange an amount of corn\ngreater than 10 bushels, it will have more of both goods than it did before specialization and trade.Table 33.5\nillustrates the range of trades that would benefit both sides.\nThe U.S. economy, after specialization, will The Saudi Arabian economy, after specialization, will\nbenefit if it: benefit if it:\nExports no more than 60 bushels of corn Imports at least 10 bushels of corn\nImports at least 20 barrels of oil Exports less than 60 barrels of oil\nTABLE33.5The Range of Trades That Benefit Both the United States and Saudi Arabia\nThe underlying reason why trade benefits both sides is rooted in the concept of opportunity cost, as the\nfollowing Clear It Up feature explains. If Saudi Arabia wishes to expand domestic production of corn in a world\nwithout international trade, then based on its opportunity costs it must give up four barrels of oil for every one\nadditional bushel of corn. If Saudi Arabia could find a way to give up less than four barrels of oil for an\nadditional bushel of corn (or equivalently, to receive more than one bushel of corn for four barrels of oil), it\nwould be better off.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhat are the opportunity costs and gains from trade?\nThe range of trades that will benefit each country is based on the country\u2019s opportunity cost of producing each good.\nThe United States can produce 100 bushels of corn or 50 barrels of oil. For the United States, the opportunity cost of\nproducing one barrel of oil is two bushels of corn. If we divide the numbers above by 50, we get the same ratio: one\nAccess for free at openstax.org 33.1 \u2022 Absolute and Comparative Advantage 795\nbarrel of oil is equivalent to two bushels of corn, or (100/50 = 2 and 50/50 = 1). In a trade with Saudi Arabia, if the\nUnited States is going to give up 100 bushels of corn in exports, it must import at least 50 barrels of oil to be just as\nwell off. Clearly, to gain from trade it needs to be able to gain more than a half barrel of oil for its bushel of corn\u2014or\nwhy trade at all?\nRecall that David Ricardo argued that if each country specializes in its comparative advantage, it will benefit\nfrom trade, and total global output will increase. How can we show gains from trade as a result of comparative\nadvantage and specialization?Table 33.6shows the output assuming that each country specializes in its\ncomparative advantage and produces no other good. This is 100% specialization. Specialization leads to an\nincrease in total world production. (Compare the total world production inTable 33.3to that inTable 33.6.)\nQuantity produced after 100% Quantity produced after 100% specialization\nCountry\nspecialization \u2014 Oil (barrels) \u2014 Corn (bushels)\nSaudi Arabia 100 0\nUnited States 0 100\nTotal World\n100 100\nProduction\nTABLE33.6How Specialization Expands Output\nWhat if we did not have complete specialization, as inTable 33.6? Would there still be gains from trade?\nConsider another example, such as when the United States and Saudi Arabia start at C and C', respectively, as\nFigure 33.2shows. Consider what occurs when trade is allowed and the United States exports 20 bushels of\ncorn to Saudi Arabia in exchange for 20 barrels of oil.\nFIGURE33.3Production Possibilities Frontier in Saudi ArabiaTrade allows a country to go beyond its domestic\nproduction-possibility frontier 796 33 \u2022 International Trade\nStarting at point C, which shows Saudi oil production of 60, reduce Saudi oil domestic oil consumption by 20,\nsince 20 is exported to the United States and exchanged for 20 units of corn. This enables Saudi to reach point\nD, where oil consumption is now 40 barrels and corn consumption has increased to 30 (seeFigure 33.3).\nNotice that even without 100% specialization, if the \u201ctrading price,\u201d in this case 20 barrels of oil for 20 bushels\nof corn, is greater than the country\u2019s opportunity cost, the Saudis will gain from trade. Since the post-trade\nconsumption point D is beyond its production possibility frontier, Saudi Arabia has gained from trade.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://wits.worldbank.org/trade-visualization.aspx)for trade-related data visualizations.\n33.2What Happens When a Country Has an Absolute Advantage in All Goods\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Show the relationship between production costs and comparative advantage\n\u2022 Identify situations of mutually beneficial trade\n\u2022 Identify trade benefits by considering opportunity costs\nWhat happens to the possibilities for trade if one country has an absolute advantage in everything? This is\ntypical for high-income countries that often have well-educated workers, technologically advanced equipment,\nand the most up-to-date production processes. These high-income countries can produce all products with\nfewer resources than a low-income country. If the high-income country is more productive across the board,\nwill there still be gains from trade? Good students of Ricardo understand that trade is about mutually\nbeneficial exchange. Even when one country has an absolute advantage in all products, trade can still benefit\nboth sides. This is because gains from trade come from specializing in one\u2019s comparative advantage.\nProduction Possibilities and Comparative Advantage\nConsider the example of trade between the United States and Mexico described inTable 33.7. In this example,\nit takes four U.S. workers to produce 1,000 pairs of shoes, but it takes five Mexican workers to do so. It takes\none U.S. worker to produce 1,000 refrigerators, but it takes four Mexican workers to do so. The United States\nhas an absolute advantage in productivity with regard to both shoes and refrigerators; that is, it takes fewer\nworkers in the United States than in Mexico to produce both a given number of shoes and a given number of\nrefrigerators.\nNumber of Workers needed to produce Number of Workers needed to produce 1,000\nCountry\n1,000 units \u2014 Shoes units \u2014 Refrigerators\nUnited\n4 workers 1 worker\nStates\nMexico 5 workers 4 workers\nTABLE33.7Resources Needed to Produce Shoes and Refrigerators\nAbsolute advantage simply compares theproductivityof a worker between countries. It answers the question,\n\u201cHow many inputs do I need to produce shoes in Mexico?\u201d Comparative advantage asks this same question\nslightly differently. Instead of comparing how many workers it takes to produce a good, it asks, \u201cHow much am\nI giving up to produce this good in this country?\u201d Another way of looking at this is that comparative advantage\nidentifies the good for which the producer\u2019s absolute advantage is relatively larger, or where the producer\u2019s\nabsolute productivity disadvantage is relatively smaller. The United States can produce 1,000 shoes with four-\nfifths as many workers as Mexico (four versus five), but it can produce 1,000 refrigerators with only one-\nAccess for free at openstax.org 33.2 \u2022 What Happens When a Country Has an Absolute Advantage in All Goods 797\nquarter as many workers (one versus four). So, the comparative advantage of the United States, where its\nabsolute productivity advantage is relatively greatest, lies with refrigerators, and Mexico\u2019s comparative\nadvantage, where its absolute productivity disadvantage is least, is in the production of shoes.\nMutually Beneficial Trade with Comparative Advantage\nWhen nations increase production in their area of comparative advantage and trade with each other, both\ncountries can benefit. Again, the production possibility frontier is a useful tool to visualize this benefit.\nConsider a situation where the United States and Mexico each have 40 workers. For example, asTable 33.8\nshows, if the United States divides its labor so that 40 workers are making shoes, then, since it takes four\nworkers in the United States to make 1,000 shoes, a total of 10,000 shoes will be produced. (If four workers can\nmake 1,000 shoes, then 40 workers will make 10,000 shoes). If the 40 workers in the United States are making\nrefrigerators, and each worker can produce 1,000 refrigerators, then a total of 40,000 refrigerators will be\nproduced.\nCountry Shoe Production \u2014 using 40 workers Refrigerator Production \u2014 using 40 workers\nUnited States 10,000 shoes or 40,000 refrigerators\nMexico 8,000 shoes or 10,000 refrigerators\nTABLE33.8Production Possibilities before Trade with Complete Specialization\nAs always, the slope of the production possibility frontier for each country is the opportunity cost of one\nrefrigerator in terms of foregone shoe production\u2013when labor is transferred from producing the latter to\nproducing the former (seeFigure 33.4).\nFIGURE33.4Production Possibility Frontiers(a) With 40 workers, the United States can produce either 10,000\nshoes and zero refrigerators or 40,000 refrigerators and zero shoes. (b) With 40 workers, Mexico can produce a\nmaximum of 8,000 shoes and zero refrigerators, or 10,000 refrigerators and zero shoes. All other points on the\nproduction possibility line are possible combinations of the two goods that can be produced given current\nresources. Point A on both graphs is where the countries start producing and consuming before trade. Point B is\nwhere they end up after trade.\nLet\u2019s say that, in the situation before trade, each nation prefers to produce a combination of shoes and\nrefrigerators that is shown at point A.Table 33.9shows the output of each good for each country and the total 798 33 \u2022 International Trade\noutput for the two countries.\nCountry Current Shoe Production Current Refrigerator Production\nUnited States 5,000 20,000\nMexico 4,000 5,000\nTotal 9,000 25,000\nTABLE33.9Total Production at Point A before Trade\nContinuing with this scenario, suppose that each country transfers some amount of labor toward its area of\ncomparative advantage. For example, the United States transfers six workers away from shoes and toward\nproducing refrigerators. As a result, U.S. production of shoes decreases by 1,500 units (6/4 \u00d7 1,000), while its\nproduction of refrigerators increases by 6,000 (that is, 6/1 \u00d7 1,000). Mexico also moves production toward its\narea of comparative advantage, transferring 10 workers away from refrigerators and toward production of\nshoes. As a result, production of refrigerators in Mexico falls by 2,500 (10/4 \u00d7 1,000), but production of shoes\nincreases by 2,000 pairs (10/5 \u00d7 1,000). Notice that when both countries shift production toward each of their\ncomparative advantages (what they are relatively better at), their combined production of both goods rises, as\nshown inTable 33.10. The reduction of shoe production by 1,500 pairs in the United States is more than offset\nby the gain of 2,000 pairs of shoes in Mexico, while the reduction of 2,500 refrigerators in Mexico is more than\noffset by the additional 6,000 refrigerators produced in the United States.\nCountry Shoe Production Refrigerator Production\nUnited States 3,500 26,000\nMexico 6,000 2,500\nTotal 9,500 28,500\nTABLE33.10Shifting Production Toward Comparative\nAdvantage Raises Total Output\nThis numerical example illustrates the remarkable insight of comparative advantage: even when one country\nhas an absolute advantage in all goods and another country has an absolute disadvantage in all goods, both\ncountries can still benefit from trade. Even though the United States has an absolute advantage in producing\nboth refrigerators and shoes, it makes economic sense for it to specialize in the good for which it has a\ncomparative advantage. The United States will export refrigerators and in return import shoes.\nHow Opportunity Cost Sets the Boundaries of Trade\nThis example shows that both parties can benefit from specializing in their comparative advantages and\ntrading. By using the opportunity costs in this example, it is possible to identify the range of possible trades\nthat would benefit each country.\nMexico started out, before specialization and trade, producing 4,000 pairs of shoes and 5,000 refrigerators (see\nFigure 33.4andTable 33.9). Then, in the numerical example given, Mexico shifted production toward its\ncomparative advantage and produced 6,000 pairs of shoes but only 2,500 refrigerators. Thus, if Mexico can\nexportno more than 2,000 pairs of shoes (giving up 2,000 pairs of shoes) in exchange forimportsof at least\n2,500 refrigerators (a gain of 2,500 refrigerators), it will be able to consume more of both goods than before\ntrade. Mexico will be unambiguously better off. Conversely, the United States started off, before specialization\nAccess for free at openstax.org 33.2 \u2022 What Happens When a Country Has an Absolute Advantage in All Goods 799\nand trade, producing 5,000 pairs of shoes and 20,000 refrigerators. In the example, it then shifted production\ntoward its comparative advantage, producing only 3,500 shoes but 26,000 refrigerators. If the United States\ncan export no more than 6,000 refrigerators in exchange for imports of at least 1,500 pairs of shoes, it will be\nable to consume more of both goods and will be unambiguously better off.\nThe range of trades that can benefit both nations is shown inTable 33.11. For example, a trade where the U.S.\nexports 4,000 refrigerators to Mexico in exchange for 1,800 pairs of shoes would benefit both sides, in the\nsense that both countries would be able to consume more of both goods than in a world without trade.\nThe U.S. economy, after specialization, will benefit The Mexican economy, after specialization, will benefit\nif it: if it:\nExportsfewer than 6,000 refrigerators Importsat least 2,500 refrigerators\nImportsat least 1,500 pairs of shoes Exportsno more than 2,000 pairs of shoes\nTABLE33.11The Range of Trades That Benefit Both the United States and Mexico\nTrade allows each country to take advantage of lower opportunity costs in the other country. If Mexico wants to\nproduce more refrigerators without trade, it must face its domestic opportunity costs and reduce shoe\nproduction. If Mexico, instead, produces more shoes and then trades for refrigerators made in the United\nStates, where theopportunity costof producing refrigerators is lower, Mexico can in effect take advantage of\nthe lower opportunity cost of refrigerators in the United States. Conversely, when the United States specializes\nin its comparative advantage of refrigerator production and trades for shoes produced in Mexico, international\ntrade allows the United States to take advantage of the lower opportunity cost of shoe production in Mexico.\nThe theory of comparative advantage explains why countries trade: they have different comparative\nadvantages. It shows that the gains from international trade result from pursuing comparative advantage and\nproducing at a lower opportunity cost. The following Work It Out feature shows how to calculate absolute and\ncomparative advantage and the way to apply them to a country\u2019s production.\nWORK IT OUT\nCalculating Absolute and Comparative Advantage\nIn Canada a worker can produce 20 barrels of oil or 40 tons of lumber. In Venezuela, a worker can produce 60\nbarrels of oil or 30 tons of lumber.\nCountry Oil (barrels) Lumber (tons)\nCanada 20 or 40\nVenezuela 60 or 30\nTABLE33.12\na. Who has the absolute advantage in the production of oil or lumber? How can you tell?\nb. Which country has a comparative advantage in the production of oil?\nc. Which country has a comparative advantage in producing lumber?\nd. In this example, is absolute advantage the same as comparative advantage, or not?\ne. In what product should Canada specialize? In what product should Venezuela specialize? 800 33 \u2022 International Trade\nStep 1. Make a table likeTable 33.12.\nStep 2. To calculate absolute advantage, look at the larger of the numbers for each product. One worker in\nCanada can produce more lumber (40 tons versus 30 tons), so Canada has the absolute advantage in lumber.\nOne worker in Venezuela can produce 60 barrels of oil compared to a worker in Canada who can produce only 20.\nStep 3. To calculate comparative advantage, find the opportunity cost of producing one barrel of oil in both\ncountries. The country with the lowest opportunity cost has the comparative advantage. With the same labor\ntime, Canada can produce either 20 barrels of oil or 40 tons of lumber. So in effect, 20 barrels of oil is equivalent\nto 40 tons of lumber: 20 oil = 40 lumber. Divide both sides of the equation by 20 to calculate the opportunity cost\nof one barrel of oil in Canada. 20/20 oil = 40/20 lumber. 1 oil = 2 lumber. To produce one additional barrel of oil\nin Canada has an opportunity cost of 2 lumber. Calculate the same way for Venezuela: 60 oil = 30 lumber. Divide\nboth sides of the equation by 60. One oil in Venezuela has an opportunity cost of 1/2 lumber. Because 1/2\nlumber < 2 lumber, Venezuela has the comparative advantage in producing oil.\nStep 4. Calculate the opportunity cost of one lumber by reversing the numbers, with lumber on the left side of the\nequation. In Canada, 40 lumber is equivalent in labor time to 20 barrels of oil: 40 lumber = 20 oil. Divide each\nside of the equation by 40. The opportunity cost of one lumber is 1/2 oil. In Venezuela, the equivalent labor time\nwill produce 30 lumber or 60 oil: 30 lumber = 60 oil. Divide each side by 30. One lumber has an opportunity cost\nof two oil. Canada has the lower opportunity cost in producing lumber.\nStep 5. In this example, absolute advantage is the same as comparative advantage. Canada has the absolute and\ncomparative advantage in lumber; Venezuela has the absolute and comparative advantage in oil.\nStep 6. Canada should specialize in the commodity for which it has a relative lower opportunity cost, which is\nlumber, and Venezuela should specialize in oil. Canada will be exporting lumber and importing oil, and Venezuela\nwill be exporting oil and importing lumber.\nComparative Advantage Goes Camping\nTo build an intuitive understanding of how comparative advantage can benefit all parties, set aside examples\nthat involve national economies for a moment and consider the situation of a group of friends who decide to go\ncamping together. The six friends have a wide range of skills and experiences, but one person in particular,\nJethro, has done lots of camping before and is also a great athlete. Jethro has an absolute advantage in all\naspects of camping: he is faster at carrying a backpack, gathering firewood, paddling a canoe, setting up tents,\nmaking a meal, and washing up. So here is the question: Because Jethro has an absolute productivity\nadvantage in everything, should he do all the work?\nOf course not! Even if Jethro is willing to work like a mule while everyone else sits around, he, like all mortals,\nonly has 24 hours in a day. If everyone sits around and waits for Jethro to do everything, not only will Jethro be\nan unhappy camper, but there will not be much output for his group of six friends to consume. The theory of\ncomparative advantage suggests that everyone will benefit if they figure out their areas of comparative\nadvantage\u2014that is, the area of camping where their productivity disadvantage is least, compared to Jethro. For\nexample, it may be that Jethro is 80% faster at building fires and cooking meals than anyone else, but only 20%\nfaster at gathering firewood and 10% faster at setting up tents. In that case, Jethro should focus on building\nfires and making meals, and others should attend to the other tasks, each according to where their productivity\ndisadvantage is smallest. If the campers coordinate their efforts according to comparative advantage, they can\nall gain.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 33.3 \u2022 Intra-industry Trade between Similar Economies 801\n33.3Intra-industry Trade between Similar Economies\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Identify at least two advantages of intra-industry trading\n\u2022 Explain the relationship between economies of scale and intra-industry trade\nAbsolute and comparative advantages explain a great deal about global trading patterns. For example, they\nhelp to explain the patterns that we noted at the start of this chapter, like why you may be eating fresh fruit\nfrom Chile or Mexico, or why lower productivity regions like Africa and Latin America are able to sell a\nsubstantial proportion of their exports to higher productivity regions like the European Union and North\nAmerica. Comparative advantage, however, at least at first glance, does not seem especially well-suited to\nexplain other common patterns of international trade.\nThe Prevalence of Intra-Industry Trade between Similar Economies\nThe theory of comparative advantage suggests that trade should happen between economies with large\ndifferences in opportunity costs of production. Roughly half of all U.S. trade involves shipping goods between\nthe fairly similar high-income economies of Japan, Canada, and the United States. Furthermore, the trade has\nan important geographic component\u2014the biggest trading partners of the United States are Canada and Mexico\n(seeTable 33.13).\nCountry U.S. Exports Go to ... U.S. Imports Come from ...\nChina 8.6% 17.7%\nCanada 17.6% 12.6%\nJapan 4.3% 4.3%\nMexico 15.8% 13.6%\nSouth Korea 3.8% 3.3%\nTABLE33.13Top Trading Partners (November 2021)(Source:\nhttps://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/highlights/\ntoppartners.html)\nMoreover, the theory of comparative advantage suggests that each economy should specialize to a degree in\ncertain products, and then exchange those products. A high proportion of trade, however, isintra-industry\ntrade\u2014that is, trade of goods within the same industry from one country to another. For example, the United\nStates produces and exports autos and imports autos.Table 33.14shows some of the largest categories of U.S.\nexports and imports. In all of these categories, the United States is both a substantial exporter and a\nsubstantial importer of goods from the same industry. In 2021, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the\nUnited States exported $131 billion worth of autos, and imported $317 billion worth of autos. About 60% of\nU.S. trade and 60% of European trade is intra-industry trade. 802 33 \u2022 International Trade\nSome U.S. Exports Quantity of Exports ($ billions) Quantity of Imports ($ billions)\nAutos $131 $317\nFood and beverages $147 $167\nCapital goods $474 $695\nConsumer goods $201 $699\nIndustrial supplies $578 $589\nOther transportation $63 $113\nTABLE33.14Some Intra-Industry U.S. Exports and Imports in 2021(Source:\nhttps://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/data/index.html)\nWhy do similar high-income economies engage in intra-industry trade? What can be the economic benefit of\nhaving workers of fairly similar skills making cars, computers, machinery and other products which are then\nshipped across the oceans to and from the United States, the European Union, and Japan? There are two\nreasons: (1) Thedivision of laborleads to learning, innovation, and unique skills; and (2) economies of scale.\nGains from Specialization and Learning\nConsider the category of machinery, where the U.S. economy has considerable intra-industry trade. Machinery\ncomes in many varieties, so the United States may be exporting machinery for manufacturing with wood, but\nimporting machinery for photographic processing. The underlying reason why a country like the United\nStates, Japan, or Germany produces one kind of machinery rather than another is usually not related to U.S.,\nGerman, or Japanese firms and workers having generally higher or lower skills. It is just that, in working on\nvery specific and particular products, firms in certain countries develop unique and different skills.\nSpecialization in the world economy can be very finely split. In fact, recent years have seen a trend in\ninternational trade, which economists callsplitting up the value chain. Thevalue chaindescribes how a good\nis produced in stages. As indicated in the beginning of the chapter, producing the iPhone involves designing\nand engineering the phone in the United States, supplying parts from Korea, assembling the parts in China,\nand advertising and marketing in the United States. Thanks in large part to improvements in communication\ntechnology, sharing information, and transportation, it has become easier to split up the value chain. Instead\nof production in a single large factory, different firms operating in various places and even different countries\ncan divide the value chain. Because firms split up the value chain, international trade often does not involve\nnations trading whole finished products like automobiles or refrigerators. Instead, it involves shipping more\nspecialized goods like, say, automobile dashboards or the shelving that fits inside refrigerators. Intra-industry\ntrade between similar countries produces economic gains because it allows workers and firms to learn and\ninnovate on particular products\u2014and often to focus on very particular parts of the value chain.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/iphoneassembly)for some interesting information about the assembly\nof the iPhone.\nEconomies of Scale, Competition, Variety\nA second broad reason that intra-industry trade between similar nations produces economic gains involves\neconomies of scale. The concept ofeconomies of scale, as we introduced inProduction, Costs and Industry\nStructure, means that as the scale of output goes up, average costs of production decline\u2014at least up to a point.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 33.3 \u2022 Intra-industry Trade between Similar Economies 803\nFigure 33.5illustrates economies of scale for a plant producing toaster ovens. The horizontal axis of the figure\nshows the quantity of production by a certain firm or at a certain manufacturing plant. The vertical axis\nmeasures the average cost of production. Production plant S produces a small level of output at 30 units and\nhas an average cost of production of $30 per toaster oven. Plant M produces at a medium level of output at 50\nunits, and has an average cost of production of $20 per toaster oven. Plant L produces 150 units of output with\nan average cost of production of only $10 per toaster oven. Although plant V can produce 200 units of output, it\nstill has the same unit cost as Plant L.\nIn this example, a small or medium plant, like S or M, will not be able to compete in the market with a large or a\nvery large plant like L or V, because the firm that operates L or V will be able to produce and sell its output at a\nlower price. In this example, economies of scale operate up to point L, but beyond point L to V, the additional\nscale of production does not continue to reduce average costs of production.\nFIGURE33.5Economies of ScaleProduction Plant S, has an average cost of production of $30 per toaster oven.\nProduction plant M has an average cost of production of $20 per toaster oven. Production plant L has an average\ncost of production of only $10 per toaster oven. Production plant V still has an average cost of production of $10 per\ntoaster oven. Thus, production plant M can produce toaster ovens more cheaply than plant S because of economies\nof scale, and plants L or V can produce more cheaply than S or M because of economies of scale. However, the\neconomies of scale end at an output level of 150. Plant V, despite being larger, cannot produce more cheaply on\naverage than plant L.\nThe concept of economies of scale becomes especially relevant to international trade when it enables one or\ntwo large producers to supply the entire country. For example, a single large automobile factory could probably\nsupply all the cars consumers purchase in a smaller economy like the United Kingdom or Belgium in a given\nyear. However, if a country has only one or two large factories producing cars, and nointernational trade, then\nconsumers in that country would have relatively little choice between kinds of cars (other than the color of the\npaint and other nonessential options). Little or no competition will exist between different car manufacturers.\nInternational trade provides a way to combine the lower average production costs that come from economies\nof scale and still have competition and variety for consumers. Large automobile factories in different countries\ncan make and sell their products around the world. If General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler were the only players\nin the U.S. automobile market, the level of competition and consumer choice would be considerably lower than\nwhen U.S. carmakers must face competition from Toyota, Honda, Suzuki, Fiat, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Volkswagen,\nKia, Hyundai, BMW, Subaru, and others. Greater competition brings with it innovation and responsiveness to\nwhat consumers want. America\u2019s car producers make far better cars now than they did several decades ago,\nand much of the reason is competitive pressure, especially from East Asian and European carmakers.\nDynamic Comparative Advantage\nThe sources of gains from intra-industry trade between similar economies\u2014namely, the learning that comes\nfrom a high degree of specialization and splitting up the value chain and from economies of scale\u2014do not 804 33 \u2022 International Trade\ncontradict the earlier theory of comparative advantage. Instead, they help to broaden the concept.\nIn intra-industry trade, climate or geography do not determine the level of worker productivity. Even the\ngeneral level of education or skill does not determine it. Instead, how firms engage in specific learning about\nspecialized products, including taking advantage of economies of scale determine the level of worker\nproductivity. In this vision, comparative advantage can be dynamic\u2014that is, it can evolve and change over time\nas one develops new skills and as manufacturers split the value chain in new ways. This line of thinking also\nsuggests that countries are not destined to have the same comparative advantage forever, but must instead be\nflexible in response to ongoing changes in comparative advantage.\n33.4The Benefits of Reducing Barriers to International Trade\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain tariffs as barriers to trade\n\u2022 Identify at least two benefits of reducing barriers to international trade\nTariffsare taxes that governments place on imported goods for a variety of reasons. Some of these reasons\ninclude protecting sensitive industries, for humanitarian reasons, and protecting againstdumping.\nTraditionally, tariffs were used simply as a political tool to protect certain vested economic, social, and cultural\ninterests. TheWorld Trade Organization (WTO)is committed to lowering barriers to trade. The world\u2019s nations\nmeet through the WTO to negotiate how they can reduce barriers to trade, such as tariffs. WTO negotiations\nhappen in \u201crounds,\u201d where all countries negotiate one agreement to encourage trade, take a year or two off,\nand then start negotiating a new agreement. The current round of negotiations is called the Doha Round\nbecause it was officially launched in Doha, the capital city of Qatar, in November 2001. In 2010, the WTO noted\nthat the Doha Round\u2019s emphasis on market access and reforms of agricultural subsidies could add $121\u2013$202\nbillion to the world economy.\nIn the context of a global economy that currently produces more than $80 trillion of goods and services each\nyear, this amount is not large: it is an increase of less than 1%. But before dismissing the gains from trade too\nquickly, it is worth remembering two points.\n\u2022 First, a gain of a few hundred billion dollars is enough money to deserve attention! Moreover, remember\nthat this increase is not a one-time event; it would persist each year into the future.\n\u2022 Second, the estimate of gains may be on the low side because some of the gains from trade are not\nmeasured especially well in economic statistics. For example, it is difficult to measure the potential\nadvantages to consumers of having a variety of products available and a greater degree of competition\namong producers. Perhaps the most important unmeasured factor is that trade between countries,\nespecially when firms are splitting up the value chain of production, often involves a transfer of knowledge\nthat can involve skills in production, technology, management, finance, and law.\nLow-income countries benefit more from trade than high-income countries do. In some ways, the giant U.S.\neconomy has less need for international trade, because it can already take advantage of internal trade within\nits economy. However, many smaller national economies around the world, in regions like Latin America,\nAfrica, the Middle East, and Asia, have much more limited possibilities for trade inside their countries or their\nimmediate regions. Without international trade, they may have little ability to benefit from comparative\nadvantage, slicing up the value chain, or economies of scale. Moreover, smaller economies often have fewer\ncompetitive firms making goods within their economy, and thus firms have less pressure from other firms to\nprovide the goods and prices that consumers want.\nThe economic gains from expanding international trade are measured in hundreds of billions of dollars, and\nthe gains from international trade as a whole probably reach well into the trillions of dollars. The potential for\ngains from trade may be especially high among the smaller and lower-income countries of the world.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 33.4 \u2022 The Benefits of Reducing Barriers to International Trade 805\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/tradebenefits)for a list of some benefits of trade.\nFrom Interpersonal to International Trade\nMost people find it easy to believe that they, personally, would not be better off if they tried to grow and process\nall of their own food, to make all of their own clothes, to build their own cars and houses from scratch, and so\non. Instead, we all benefit from living in economies where people and firms can specialize and trade with each\nother.\nThe benefits of trade do not stop at national boundaries, either. Earlier we explained that the division of labor\ncould increase output for three reasons: (1) workers with different characteristics can specialize in the types of\nproduction where they have a comparative advantage; (2) firms and workers who specialize in a certain\nproduct become more productive with learning and practice; and (3) economies of scale. These three reasons\napply from the individual and community level right up to the international level. If it makes sense to you that\ninterpersonal, intercommunity, and interstate trade offer economic gains, it should make sense that\ninternational trade offers gains, too.\nInternational trade currently involves about $20 trillion worth of goods and services moving around the globe.\nAny economic force of that size, even if it confers overall benefits, is certain to cause disruption and\ncontroversy. This chapter has only made the case that trade brings economic benefits. Other chapters discuss,\nin detail, the public policy arguments over whether to restrict international trade.\nBRING IT HOME\nJust Whose iPhone Is It?\nApple Corporation uses a global platform to produce the iPhone. Now that you understand the concept of\ncomparative advantage, you can see why the engineering and design of the iPhone is done in the United States. The\nUnited States has built up a comparative advantage over the years in designing and marketing products, and\nsacrifices fewer resources to design high-tech devices relative to other countries. China has a comparative\nadvantage in assembling the phone due to its large skilled labor force. Korea has a comparative advantage in\nproducing components. Korea focuses its production by increasing its scale, learning better ways to produce\nscreens and computer chips, and uses innovation to lower average costs of production. Apple, in turn, benefits\nbecause it can purchase these quality products at lower prices. Put the global assembly line together and you have\nthe device with which we are all so familiar. 806 33 \u2022 Key Terms\nKey Terms\nabsolute advantagewhen one country can use fewer resources to produce a good compared to another\ncountry; when a country is more productive compared to another country\ngain from tradea country that can consume more than it can produce as a result of specialization and trade\nintra-industry tradeinternational trade of goods within the same industry\nsplitting up the value chainmany of the different stages of producing a good happen in different geographic\nlocations\ntariffstaxes that governments place on imported goods\nvalue chainhow a good is produced in stages\nKey Concepts and Summary\n33.1Absolute and Comparative Advantage\nA country has an absolute advantage in those products in which it has a productivity edge over other countries;\nit takes fewer resources to produce a product. A country has a comparative advantage when it can produce a\ngood at a lower cost in terms of other goods. Countries that specialize based on comparative advantage gain\nfrom trade.\n33.2What Happens When a Country Has an Absolute Advantage in All Goods\nEven when a country has high levels of productivity in all goods, it can still benefit from trade. Gains from\ntrade come about as a result of comparative advantage. By specializing in a good that it gives up the least to\nproduce, a country can produce more and offer that additional output for sale. If other countries specialize in\nthe area of their comparative advantage as well and trade, the highly productive country is able to benefit from\na lower opportunity cost of production in other countries.\n33.3Intra-industry Trade between Similar Economies\nA large share of global trade happens between high-income economies that are quite similar in having well-\neducated workers and advanced technology. These countries practice intra-industry trade, in which they\nimport and export the same products at the same time, like cars, machinery, and computers. In the case of\nintra-industry trade between economies with similar income levels, the gains from trade come from\nspecialized learning in very particular tasks and from economies of scale. Splitting up the value chain means\nthat several stages of producing a good take place in different countries around the world.\n33.4The Benefits of Reducing Barriers to International Trade\nTariffs are placed on imported goods as a way of protecting sensitive industries, for humanitarian reasons, and\nfor protection against dumping. Traditionally, tariffs were used as a political tool to protect certain vested\neconomic, social, and cultural interests. The WTO has been, and continues to be, a way for nations to meet and\nnegotiate in order to reduce barriers to trade. The gains of international trade are very large, especially for\nsmaller countries, but are beneficial to all.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

While governments can\nlimit the rise in prices of some products, they cannot control how much people want to buy or how much firms are\nwilling to sell. The laws of demand and supply still hold. Trade policy is an example where regulations can redirect\neconomic forces, but it cannot stop them from manifesting themselves elsewhere.\nFlat-panel displays, the displays for laptop computers, tablets, and flat screen televisions, are an example of such\nan enduring principle. In the early 1990s, the vast majority of flat-panel displays used in U.S.-manufactured laptops\nwere imported, primarily from Japan. The small but politically powerful U.S. flat-panel-display industry filed a 812 34 \u2022 Globalization and Protectionism\ndumping complaint with the Commerce Department. They argued that Japanese firms were selling displays at \u201cless\nthan fair value,\u201d which made it difficult for U.S. firms to compete. This argument for trade protection is referred to as\nanti-dumping. Other arguments for protection in this complaint included national security. After a preliminary\ndetermination by the Commerce Department that the Japanese firms were dumping, the U.S. International Trade\nCommission imposed a 63% dumping margin (or tax) on the import of flat-panel displays. Was this a successful\nexercise of U.S. trade policy? See what you think after reading the chapter.\nThe world has become more connected on multiple levels, especially economically. In 1970, imports and\nexports made up 11% of U.S. GDP, while now they make up 32%. However, the United States, due to its size, is\nless internationally connected than most countries. For example, according to the World Bank, 97% of\nBotswana\u2019s economic activity is connected to trade. This chapter explores trade policy\u2014the laws and strategies\na country uses to regulate international trade. This topic is not without controversy.\nAs the world has become more globally connected, firms and workers in high-income countries like the United\nStates, Japan, or the nations of the European Union, perceive a competitive threat from firms in medium-\nincome countries like Mexico, China, or South Africa, that have lower costs of living and therefore pay lower\nwages. Firms and workers in low-income countries fear that they will suffer if they must compete against more\nproductive workers and advanced technology in high-income countries.\nOn a different tack, some environmentalists worry that multinational firms may evade environmental\nprotection laws by moving their production to countries with loose or nonexistent pollution standards, trading\na clean environment for jobs. Some politicians worry that their country may become overly dependent on key\nimported products, like oil, which in a time of war could threaten national security. All of these fears influence\ngovernments to reach the same basic policy conclusion: to protect national interests, whether businesses, jobs,\nor security, imports of foreign products should be restricted. This chapter analyzes such arguments. First,\nhowever, it is essential to learn a few key concepts and understand how the demand and supply model applies\nto international trade.\n34.1Protectionism: An Indirect Subsidy from Consumers to Producers\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain protectionism and its three main forms\n\u2022 Analyze protectionism through concepts of demand and supply, noting its effects on equilibrium\n\u2022 Calculate the effects of trade barriers\nWhen a government legislates policies to reduce or block international trade it is engaging inprotectionism.\nProtectionist policies often seek to shield domestic producers and domestic workers from foreign competition.\nProtectionism takes three main forms: tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers.\nRecall fromInternational Tradethattariffsare taxes that governments impose on imported goods and\nservices. This makes imports more expensive for consumers, discouraging imports. For example, in 2018,\nPresident Trump increased tariffs on Chinese-manufactured goods by 2\u201325%, including TVs, monitors,\ndesktop PCs, smartwatches, and many other consumer goods. The intention behind the policy was to shelter\nU.S. manufacturers from competition, helping companies that operate domestically. China responded with\ntariffs on American goods, launching a trade war. President Biden retained these tariffs and considered\nadditional ones, but as of August 2022, the administration was considering changes designed to reduce\ninflation.\nAnother way to control trade is throughimport quotas, which are numerical limitations on the quantity of\nproducts that a country can import. For instance, during the early 1980s, the Reagan Administration imposed\na quota on the import of Japanese automobiles. In the 1970s, many developed countries, including the United\nStates, found themselves with declining textile industries. Textile production does not require highly skilled\nAccess for free at openstax.org 34.1 \u2022 Protectionism: An Indirect Subsidy from Consumers to Producers 813\nworkers, so producers were able to set up lower-cost factories in developing countries. In order to \u201cmanage\u201d\nthis loss of jobs and income, the developed countries established an international Multifiber Agreement that\nessentially divided the market for textile exports between importers and the remaining domestic producers.\nThe agreement, which ran from 1974 to 2004, specified the exact quota of textile imports that each developed\ncountry would accept from each low-income country. A similar story exists for sugar imports into the United\nStates, which are still governed by quotas.\nNontariff barriersare all the other ways that a nation can draw up rules, regulations, inspections, and\npaperwork to make it more costly or difficult to import products. A rule requiring certain safety standards can\nlimit imports just as effectively as high tariffs or low import quotas, for instance. There are also nontariff\nbarriers in the form of \u201crules-of-origin\u201d regulations; these rules describe the \u201cMade in Country X\u201d label as the\none in which the last substantial change in the product took place. A manufacturer wishing to evade import\nrestrictions may try to change the production process so that the last big change in the product happens in\ntheir own country. For example, certain textiles are made in the United States, shipped to other countries,\ncombined with textiles made in those other countries to make apparel\u2014and then re-exported back to the\nUnited States for a final assembly, to escape paying tariffs or to obtain a \u201cMade in the USA\u201d label.\nDespite import quotas, tariffs, and nontariff barriers, the share of apparel sold in the United States that is\nimported rose from about half in 1999 to about three-quarters today. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor\nStatistics (BLS), estimated the number of U.S. jobs in textiles and apparel fell 44% from 2007 to 2014, and will\nfall by another 25% by 2024. Even more U.S. textile industry jobs would have been lost without tariffs.\nHowever, domestic jobs that are saved by import quotas come at a cost. Because textile and apparel\nprotectionism adds to the costs of imports, consumers end up paying billions of dollars more for clothing each\nyear.\nWhen the United States eliminates trade barriers in one area, consumers spend the money they save on that\nproduct elsewhere in the economy. Thus, while eliminating trade barriers in one sector of the economy will\nlikely result in some job loss in that sector, consumers will spend the resulting savings in other sectors of the\neconomy and hence increase the number of jobs in those other sectors. Of course, workers in some of the\npoorest countries of the world who would otherwise have jobs producing textiles, would gain considerably if\nthe United States reduced its barriers to trade in textiles. That said, there are good reasons to be wary about\nreducing barriers to trade. The 2012 and 2013 Bangladeshi fires in textile factories, which resulted in a\nhorrific loss of life, present complications that our simplified analysis in the chapter will not capture.\nRealizing the compromises between nations that come about due to trade policy, many countries came\ntogether in 1947 to form the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). (We\u2019ll cover the GATT in more\ndetail later in the chapter.) This agreement has since been superseded by theWorld Trade Organization\n(WTO), whose membership includes about 150 nations and most of the world's economies. It is the primary\ninternational mechanism through which nations negotiate their trade rules\u2014including rules about tariffs,\nquotas, and nontariff barriers. The next section examines the results of such protectionism and develops a\nsimple model to show the impact of trade policy.\nDemand and Supply Analysis of Protectionism\nTo the non-economist, restricting imports may appear to be nothing more than taking sales from foreign\nproducers and giving them to domestic producers. Other factors are at work, however, because firms do not\noperate in a vacuum. Instead, firms sell their products either to consumers or to other firms (if they are\nbusiness suppliers), who are also affected by the trade barriers. A demand and supply analysis of\nprotectionism shows that it is not just a matter of domestic gains and foreign losses, but a policy that imposes\nsubstantial domestic costs as well.\nConsider two countries, Brazil and the United States, who produce sugar. Each country has a domestic supply\nand demand for sugar, asTable 34.1details andFigure 34.2illustrates. In Brazil, without trade, the 814 34 \u2022 Globalization and Protectionism\nequilibriumprice of sugar is 12 cents per pound and the equilibrium output is 30 tons. When there is no trade\nin the United States, the equilibrium price of sugar is 24 cents per pound and the equilibrium quantity is 80\ntons. We label these equilibrium points as point E in each part of the figure.\nFIGURE34.2The Sugar Trade between Brazil and the United StatesBefore trade, the equilibrium price of sugar in\nBrazil is 12 cents a pound and it is 24 cents per pound in the United States. When trade is allowed, businesses will\nbuy cheap sugar in Brazil and sell it in the United States. This will result in higher prices in Brazil and lower prices in\nthe United States. Ignoring transaction costs, prices should converge to 16 cents per pound, with Brazil exporting 15\ntons of sugar and the United States importing 15 tons of sugar. If trade is only partly open between the countries, it\nwill lead to an outcome between the free-trade and no-trade possibilities.\nBrazil: Quantity Brazil: Quantity U.S.: Quantity U.S.: Quantity\nPrice\nSupplied (tons) Demanded (tons) Supplied (tons) Demanded (tons)\n8\n20 35 60 100\ncents\n12\n30 30 66 93\ncents\n14\n35 28 69 90\ncents\n16\n40 25 72 87\ncents\n20\n45 21 76 83\ncents\n24\n50 18 80 80\ncents\n28\n55 15 82 78\ncents\nTABLE34.1The Sugar Trade between Brazil and the United States\nAccess for free at openstax.org 34.1 \u2022 Protectionism: An Indirect Subsidy from Consumers to Producers 815\nIf international trade between Brazil and the United States now becomes possible, profit-seeking firms will\nspot an opportunity: buy sugar cheaply in Brazil, and sell it at a higher price in the United States. As sugar is\nshipped from Brazil to the United States, the quantity of sugar produced in Brazil will be greater than Brazilian\nconsumption (with the extra production exported), and the amount produced in the United States will be less\nthan the amount of U.S. consumption (with the extra consumption imported). Exports to the United States will\nreduce the sugar supply in Brazil, raising its price. Imports into the United States will increase the sugar\nsupply, lowering its price. When the sugar price is the same in both countries, there is no incentive to trade\nfurther. AsFigure 34.2shows, the equilibrium with trade occurs at a price of 16 cents per pound. At that price,\nthe sugar farmers of Brazil supply a quantity of 40 tons, while the consumers of Brazil buy only 25 tons.\nThe extra 15 tons of sugar production, shown by the horizontal gap between thedemand curveand thesupply\ncurvein Brazil, is exported to the United States. In the United States, at a price of 16 cents, the farmers produce\na quantity of 72 tons and consumers demand a quantity of 87 tons. The excess demand of 15 tons by American\nconsumers, shown by the horizontal gap between demand and domestic supply at the price of 16 cents, is\nsupplied by imported sugar. Free trade typically results in income distribution effects, but the key is to\nrecognize the overall gains from trade, asFigure 34.3shows. Building on the concepts that we outlined in\nDemand and SupplyandDemand, Supply, and Efficiencyin terms of consumer and producer surplus,Figure\n34.3(a) shows that producers in Brazil gain by selling more sugar at a higher price, whileFigure 34.3(b) shows\nconsumers in the United States benefit from the lower price and greater availability of sugar. Consumers in\nBrazil are worse off (compare their no-trade consumer surplus with the free-trade consumer surplus) and U.S.\nproducers of sugar are worse off. There are gains from trade\u2014an increase in social surplus in each country.\nThat is, both the United States and Brazil are better off than they would be without trade. The following Clear It\nUp feature explains how trade policy can influence low-income countries.\nFIGURE34.3Free Trade of SugarFree trade results in gains from trade. Total surplus increases in both countries,\nas the two blue-shaded areas show. However, there are clear income distribution effects. Producers gain in the\nexporting country, while consumers lose; and in the importing country, consumers gain and producers lose.\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/sugartrade)to read more about the global sugar trade. 816 34 \u2022 Globalization and Protectionism\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhy are there low-income countries?\nWhy are the poor countries of the world poor? There are a number of reasons, but one of them will surprise you: the\ntrade policies of the high-income countries. Following is a stark review of social priorities which the international aid\norganization,Oxfam Internationalhas widely publicized.\nHigh-income countriesof the world\u2014primarily the United States, countries of the European Union, and\nJapan\u2014subsidize their domestic farmers collectively by about $200 billion per year. Why does this matter?\nIt matters because the support of farmers in high-income countries is devastating to the livelihoods of farmers in\nlow-income countries. Even when their climate and land are well-suited to products like cotton, rice, sugar, or milk,\nfarmers in low-income countries find it difficult to compete. Farmsubsidiesin the high-income countries cause\nfarmers in those countries to increase the amount they produce. This increase in supply drives down world prices of\nfarm products below the costs of production. As Michael Gerson of theWashington Postdescribes it: \u201c[T]he effects\nin the cotton-growing regions of West Africa are dramatic . . . keep[ing] millions of Africans on the edge of\nmalnutrition. In some of the poorest countries on Earth, cotton farmers are some of the poorest people, earning\nabout a dollar a day. . . . Who benefits from the current system of subsidies? About 20,000 American cotton\nproducers, with an average annual income of more than $125,000.\u201d\nAs if subsidies were not enough, often, the high-income countries block agricultural exports from low-income\ncountries. In some cases, the situation gets even worse when the governments of high-income countries, having\nbought and paid for an excess supply of farm products, give away those products in poor countries and drive local\nfarmers out of business altogether.\nFor example, shipments of excess milk from the European Union to Jamaica have caused great hardship for\nJamaican dairy farmers. Shipments of excess rice from the United States to Haiti drove thousands of low-income\nrice farmers in Haiti out of business. The opportunity costs of protectionism are not paid just by domestic\nconsumers, but also by foreign producers\u2014and for many agricultural products, those foreign producers are the\nworld\u2019s poor.\nNow, let\u2019s look at what happens withprotectionism. U.S. sugar farmers are likely to argue that, if only they\ncould be protected from sugar imported from Brazil, the United States would have higher domestic sugar\nproduction, more jobs in the sugar industry, and American sugar farmers would receive a higher price. If the\nUnited States government sets a high-enough tariff on imported sugar, or sets an import quota at zero, the\nresult will be that the quantity of sugar traded between countries could be reduced to zero, and the prices in\neach country will return to the levels before trade was allowed.\nBlocking only some trade is also possible. Suppose that the United States passed a sugar import quota of seven\ntons. The United States will import no more than seven tons of sugar, which means that Brazil can export no\nmore than seven tons of sugar to the United States. As a result, the price of sugar in the United States will be 20\ncents, which is the price where the quantity demanded is seven tons greater than the domestic quantity\nsupplied. Conversely, if Brazil can export only seven tons of sugar, then the price of sugar in Brazil will be 14\ncents per pound, which is the price where the domestic quantity supplied in Brazil is seven tons greater than\ndomestic demand.\nIn general, when a country sets a low or medium tariff or import quota, the equilibrium price and quantity will\nbe somewhere between those that prevail with no trade and those with completely free trade. The following\nWork It Out explores the impact of these trade barriers.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 34.1 \u2022 Protectionism: An Indirect Subsidy from Consumers to Producers 817\nWORK IT OUT\nEffects of Trade Barriers\nLet\u2019s look carefully at the effects of tariffs or quotas. If the U.S. government imposes a tariff or quota sufficient to\neliminate trade with Brazil, two things occur: U.S. consumers pay a higher price and therefore buy a smaller\nquantity of sugar. U.S. producers obtain a higher price and they sell a larger quantity of sugar. We can measure\nthe effects of a tariff on producers and consumers in the United States using two concepts that we developed in\nDemand, Supply, and Efficiency:consumer surplusandproducer surplus.\nFIGURE34.4U.S. Sugar Supply and DemandWhen there is free trade, the equilibrium is at point A. When there\nis no trade, the equilibrium is at point E.\nStep 1. Look atFigure 34.4, which shows a hypothetical version of the demand and supply of sugar in the United\nStates.\nStep 2. Note that when there is free trade the sugar market is in equilibrium at point A where Domestic Quantity\nDemanded (Qd) = Quantity Supplied (Domestic Qs + Imports from Brazil) at a price of P .\nTrade\nStep 3. Note, also, that imports are equal to the distance between points C and A.\nStep 4. Recall that consumer surplus is the value that consumers get beyond what they paid for when they buy a\nproduct. Graphically, it is the area under a demand curve but above the price. In this case, the consumer surplus\nin the United States is the area of the triangle formed by the points P , A, and B.\nTrade\nStep 5. Recall, also, that producer surplus is another name for profit\u2014it is the income producers get above the\ncost of production, which is shown by the supply curve here. In this case, the producer surplus with trade is the\narea of the triangle formed by the points P , C, and D.\ntrade\nStep 6. Suppose that the barriers to trade are imposed, imports are excluded, and the price rises to P . Look\nNoTrade\nwhat happens to producer surplus and consumer surplus. At the higher price, the domestic quantity supplied\nincreases from Qs to Q at point E. Because producers are selling more quantity at a higher price, the producer\nsurplus increases to the area of the triangle P , E, and D.\nNoTrade\nStep 7. Compare the areas of the two triangles and you will see the increase in the producer surplus.\nStep 8. Examine the consumer surplus. Consumers are now paying a higher price to get a lower quantity (Q\ninstead of Qd). Their consumer surplus shrinks to the area of the triangle P , E, and B.\nNoTrade\nStep 9. Determine the net effect. The producer surplus increases by the area P , C, E, P . The loss of\ntrade NoTrade\nconsumer surplus, however, is larger. It is the area P , A, E, P . In other words, consumers lose more\ntrade NoTrade 818 34 \u2022 Globalization and Protectionism\nthan producers gain as a result of the trade barriers and the United States has a lower social surplus.\nWho Benefits and Who Pays?\nUsing the demand and supply model, consider the impact of protectionism on producers and consumers in\neach of the two countries. For protected producers like U.S. sugar farmers, restricting imports is clearly\npositive. Without a need to face imported products, these producers are able to sell more, at a higher price. For\nconsumers in the country with the protected good, in this case U.S. sugar consumers, restricting imports is\nclearly negative. They end up buying a lower quantity of the good and paying a higher price for what they do\nbuy, compared to the equilibrium price and quantity with trade. The following Clear It Up feature considers\nwhy a country might outsource jobs even for a domestic product.\nCLEAR IT UP\nWhy are Life Savers, an American product, not made in America?\nIn 1912, Clarence Crane invented Life Savers, the hard candy with the hole in the middle, in Cleveland, Ohio.\nStarting in the late 1960s and for 35 years afterward, a plant in Holland, Michigan produced 46 billion Life Savers a\nyear, in 200 million rolls. However, in 2002, the Kraft Company announced that it would close the Michigan plant\nand move Life Saver production across the border to Montreal, Canada.\nOne reason is that Canadian workers are paid slightly less, especially in healthcare and insurance costs that are not\nlinked to employment there. Another main reason is that the United States government keeps the sugar price high\nfor the benefit of sugar farmers, with a combination of a government price floor program and strict quotas on\nimported sugar. In recent years, the price of U.S. sugar has been about double the price of sugar produced by the\nrest of the world. Life Saver production uses over 100 tons of sugar each day, because the candies are 95% sugar.\nA number of other candy companies have also reduced U.S. production and expanded foreign production. Sugar-\nusing industries have eliminated over 100,000 jobs over the last 20 years, more than seven times the total\nemployment in sugar production. While the candy industry is especially affected by the cost of sugar, the costs are\nspread more broadly. U.S. consumers pay roughly $1 billion per year in higher food prices because of elevated sugar\ncosts. Meanwhile, sugar producers in low-income countries are driven out of business. Because of the sugar\nsubsidies to domestic producers and the quotas on imports, they cannot sell their output profitably, or at all, in the\nUnited States market.\nThe fact that protectionism pushes up prices for consumers in the country enacting such protectionism is not\nalways acknowledged openly, but it is not disputed. After all, if protectionism did not benefit domestic\nproducers, there would not be much point in enacting such policies in the first place. Protectionism is simply a\nmethod of requiring consumers to subsidize producers. The subsidy is indirect, since consumers pay for it\nthrough higher prices, rather than a direct government subsidy paid with money collected from taxpayers.\nHowever, protectionism works like a subsidy, nonetheless. The American satirist Ambrose Bierce defined\n\u201ctariff\u201d this way in his 1911 book,The Devil\u2019s Dictionary: \u201cTariff, n. A scale of taxes on imports, designed to\nprotect the domestic producer against the greed of his consumer.\u201d\nThe effect of protectionism on producers and consumers in the foreign country is complex. When a\ngovernment uses an import quota to impose partial protectionism, Brazilian sugar producers receive a lower\nprice for the sugar they sell in Brazil\u2014but a higher price for the sugar they are allowed to export to the United\nStates. Notice that some of the burden of protectionism, paid by domestic consumers, ends up in the hands of\nforeign producers in this case. Brazilian sugar consumers seem to benefit from U.S. protectionism, because it\nreduces the price of sugar that they pay (compared to the free-trade situation). On the other hand, at least\nsome of these Brazilian sugar consumers also work as sugar farmers, so protectionism reduces their incomes\nAccess for free at openstax.org 34.2 \u2022 International Trade and Its Effects on Jobs, Wages, and Working Conditions 819\nand jobs. Moreover, if trade between the countries vanishes, Brazilian consumers would miss out on better\nprices for imported goods\u2014which do not appear in our single-market example of sugar protectionism.\nThe effects of protectionism on foreign countries notwithstanding, protectionism requires domestic\nconsumers of a product (consumers may include either households or other firms) to pay higher prices to\nbenefit domestic producers of that product. In addition, when a country enacts protectionism, it loses the\neconomic gains it would have been able to achieve through a combination of comparative advantage,\nspecialized learning, and economies of scale, concepts that we discuss inInternational Trade.\n34.2International Trade and Its Effects on Jobs, Wages, and Working\nConditions\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Discuss how international trade influences the job market\n\u2022 Analyze the opportunity cost of protectionism\n\u2022 Explain how international trade impacts wages, labor standards, and working conditions\nIn theory at least, imports might injure workers in several different ways: fewer jobs, lower wages, or poor\nworking conditions. Let\u2019s consider these in turn.\nFewer Jobs?\n1\nIn the early 1990s, the United States was negotiating theNorth American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)\nwith Mexico, an agreement that reduced tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers to trade between the\nUnited States, Mexico, and Canada. H. Ross Perot, a 1992 candidate for U.S. president, claimed, in prominent\ncampaign arguments, that if the United States expanded trade with Mexico, there would be a \u201cgiant sucking\nsound\u201d as U.S. employers relocated to Mexico to take advantage of lower wages. After all, average wages in\nMexico were, at that time, about one-eighth of those in the United States. NAFTA passed Congress, President\nBill Clinton signed it into law, and it took effect in 1995. For the next six years, the United States economy had\nsome of the most rapid job growth and low unemployment in its history. Those who feared that open trade with\nMexico would lead to a dramatic decrease in jobs were proven wrong.\nThis result was no surprise to economists. After all, the trend toward globalization has been going on for\ndecades, not just since NAFTA. If trade reduced the number of available jobs, then the United States should\nhave been seeing a steady loss of jobs for decades. While the United States economy does experience rises and\nfalls in unemployment rates, the number of jobs is not falling over extended periods of time. The number of\nU.S. jobs rose from 71 million in 1970 to 150 million in 2021.\nProtectionismcertainly saves jobs in the specific industry being protected but, for two reasons, it costs jobs in\nother unprotected industries. First, if consumers are paying higher prices to the protected industry, they\ninevitably have less money to spend on goods from other industries, and so jobs are lost in those other\nindustries. Second, if a firm sells the protected product to other firms, so that other firms must now pay a\nhigher price for a key input, then those firms will lose sales to foreign producers who do not need to pay the\nhigher price. Lost sales translate into lost jobs. The hiddenopportunity costof using protectionism to save jobs\nin one industry is jobs sacrificed in other industries. This is why the United States International Trade\nCommission, in its study of barriers to trade, predicts that reducing trade barriers would not lead to an overall\nloss of jobs. Protectionism reshuffles jobs from industries without import protections to industries that are\nprotected from imports, but it does not create more jobs.\nMoreover, the costs of saving jobs through protectionism can be very high. A number of different studies have\nattempted to estimate the cost to consumers in higher prices per job saved through protectionism.Table 34.2\nshows a sample of results, compiled by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Saving a job through\n1 As of July 1, 2020, NAFTA was officially replaced with the United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) free trade agreement. It is\nbroadly similar to the original NAFTA. 820 34 \u2022 Globalization and Protectionism\nprotectionism typically costs much more than the actual worker\u2019s salary. For example, a study published in\n2002 compiled evidence that using protectionism to save an average job in the textile and apparel industry\nwould cost $199,000 per job saved. In other words, those workers could have been paid $100,000 per year to\nbe unemployed and the cost would only be half of what it is to keep them working in the textile and apparel\nindustry. This result is not unique to textiles and apparel.\nIndustry Protected with Import Tariffs or Quotas Annual Cost per Job Saved\nSugar $826,000\nPolyethylene resins $812,000\nDairy products $685,000\nFrozen concentrated orange juice $635,000\nBall bearings $603,000\nMachine tools $479,000\nWomen\u2019s handbags $263,000\nGlassware $247,000\nApparel and textiles $199,000\nRubber footwear $168,000\nWomen\u2019s nonathletic footwear $139,000\nTABLE34.2Cost to U.S. Consumers of Saving a Job through Protectionism\n(Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas)\nWhy does it cost so much to save jobs through protectionism? The basic reason is that not all of the extra\nmoney that consumers pay because of tariffs or quotas goes to save jobs. For example, if the government\nimposes tariffs on steel imports so that steel buyers pay a higher price, U.S. steel companies earn greater\nprofits, buy more equipment, pay bigger bonuses to managers, give pay raises to existing employees\u2014and also\navoid firing some additional workers. Only part of the higher price of protected steel goes toward saving jobs.\nAlso, when an industry is protected, the economy as a whole loses the benefits of playing to its comparative\nadvantage\u2014in other words, producing what it is best at. Therefore, part of the higher price that consumers pay\nfor protected goods is lost economic efficiency, which we can measure as another deadweight loss, like what\nwe discussed inLabor and Financial Markets.\nThere\u2019s a bumper sticker that speaks to the threat some U.S. workers feel from imported products: \u201cBuy\nAmerican\u2014Save U.S. Jobs.\u201d If an economist were driving the car, the sticker might declare: \u201cBlock\nImports\u2014Save Jobs for Some Americans, Lose Jobs for Other Americans, and Also Pay High Prices.\u201d\nTrade and Wages\nEven if trade does not reduce the number of jobs, it could affect wages. Here, it is important to separate issues\nabout the average level of wages from issues about whether the wages of certain workers may be helped or hurt\nby trade.\nBecause trade raises the amount that an economy can produce by letting firms and workers play to their\ncomparative advantage, trade will also cause the average level of wages in an economy to rise. Workers who\nAccess for free at openstax.org 34.2 \u2022 International Trade and Its Effects on Jobs, Wages, and Working Conditions 821\ncan produce more will be more desirable to employers, which will shift the demand for their labor out to the\nright, and increase wages in the labor market. By contrast, barriers to trade will reduce the average level of\nwages in an economy.\nHowever, even if trade increases the overall wage level, it will still benefit some workers and hurt others.\nWorkers in industries that are confronted by competition from imported products may find that demand for\ntheir labor decreases and shifts back to the left, so that their wages decline with a rise in international trade.\nConversely, workers in industries that benefit from selling in global markets may find that demand for their\nlabor shifts out to the right, so that trade raises their wages.\nLINK IT UP\nView thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/fairtradecoffee)to read an article on the issues surrounding fair trade\ncoffee.\nOne concern is that whileglobalizationmay be benefiting high-skilled, high-wage workers in the United States,\nit may also impose costs on low-skilled, low-wage workers. After all, high-skilled U.S. workers presumably\nbenefit from increased sales of sophisticated products like computers, machinery, and pharmaceuticals in\nwhich the United States has acomparative advantage. Meanwhile, low-skilled U.S. workers must now compete\nagainst extremely low-wage workers worldwide for making simpler products like toys and clothing. As a result,\nthe wages of low-skilled U.S. workers are likely to fall. There are, however, a number of reasons to believe that\nwhile globalization has helped some U.S. industries and hurt others, it has not focused its negative impact on\nthe wages of low-skilled Americans. First, about half of U.S. trade is intra-industry trade. That means the U.S.\ntrades similar goods with other high-wage economies like Canada, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom.\nFor instance, in 2014 the U.S. exported over 2 million cars, from all the major automakers, and also imported\nseveral million cars from other countries.\nMost U.S. workers in these industries have above-average skills and wages\u2014and many of them do quite well in\nthe world of globalization. Some evidence suggested that intra-industry trade between similar countries had a\nsmall impact on domestic workers but later evidence indicates that it all depends on how flexible the labor\nmarket is. In other words, the key is how flexible workers are in finding jobs in different industries. The effect\nof trade on low-wage workers depends considerably on the structure of labor markets and indirect effects felt\nin other parts of the economy. For example, in the United States and the United Kingdom, because labor\nmarket frictions are low, the impact of trade on low income workers is small.\nSecond, many low-skilled U.S. workers hold service jobs that imports from low-wage countries cannot replace.\nFor example, we cannot import lawn care services or moving and hauling services or hotel maids from\ncountries long distances away like China or Bangladesh. Competition from imported products is not the\nprimary determinant of their wages.\nFinally, while the focus of the discussion here is on wages, it is worth pointing out that low-wage U.S. workers\nsuffer due to protectionism in all the industries\u2014even those in which they do not work. For example, food and\nclothing are protected industries. These low-wage workers therefore pay higher prices for these basic\nnecessities and as such their dollar stretches over fewer goods.\nThe benefits and costs of increased trade in terms of its effect on wages are not distributed evenly across the\neconomy. However, the growth of international trade has helped to raise the productivity of U.S. workers as a\nwhole\u2014and thus helped to raise the average level of wages.\nLabor Standards and Working Conditions\nWorkers in many low-income countries around the world labor under conditions that would be illegal for a\nworker in the United States. Workers in countries like China, Thailand, Brazil, South Africa, and Poland are\noften paid less than the United Statesminimum wage. For example, in the United States, the national 822 34 \u2022 Globalization and Protectionism\nminimum wage is $7.25 per hour. A typical wage in many low-income countries might be more like $7.25 per\nday, or often much less. Moreover, working conditions in low-income countries may be extremely unpleasant,\nor even unsafe. In the worst cases, production may involve the child labor or even workers who are mistreated,\nabused, or entrapped in their jobs. These concerns over foreign labor standards do not affect most of U.S.\ntrade, which is intra-industry and carried out with other high-income countries that have labor standards\nsimilar to the United States, but it is, nonetheless, morally and economically important.\nIn thinking about labor standards in other countries, it is important to draw some distinctions between what is\ntruly unacceptable and what is painful to think about. Most people, economists included, have little difficulty\nwith the idea that production by six-year-olds confined in factories, by people who are abused or mistreated, or\nby slave labor is morally unacceptable. They would support aggressive efforts to eliminate such\npractices\u2014including shutting out imported products made with such labor. Many cases, however, are less\nclear-cut. An opinion article in theNew York Timesseveral years ago described the case of Ahmed Zia, a\n14-year-old boy from Pakistan. He earned $2 per day working in a carpet factory. He dropped out of school in\nsecond grade. Should the United States and other countries refuse to purchase rugs made by Ahmed and his\nco-workers? If the carpet factories were to close, the likely alternative job for Ahmed is farm work, and as\nAhmed says of his carpet-weaving job: \u201cThis makes much more money and is more comfortable.\u201d\nOther workers may have even less attractive alternative jobs, perhaps scavenging garbage or prostitution. The\nreal problem for Ahmed and many others in low-income countries is not that globalization has made their\nlives worse, but rather that they have so few good life alternatives. The United States went through similar\nsituations during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\nIn closing, there is some irony when the United States government or U.S. citizens take issue with labor\nstandards in low-income countries, because the United States is not a world leader in government laws to\nprotect employees. According to a recent study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and\nDevelopment (OECD), the U.S. is the only one of 41 countries that does not provide mandated paid leave for\nnew parents, and among the 40 countries that do mandate paid leave, the minimum duration is about two\nmonths. Many European workers receive six weeks or more of paid vacation per year. In the United States,\nvacations are often one to three weeks per year. If European countries accused the United States of using\nunfair labor standards to make U.S. products cheaply, and announced that they would shut out all U.S. imports\nuntil the United States adopted paid parental leave, added more national holidays, and doubled vacation time,\nAmericans would be outraged. Yet when U.S. protectionists start talking about restricting imports from poor\ncountries because of low wage levels and poor working conditions, they are making a very similar argument.\nThis is not to say that labor conditions in low-income countries are not an important issue. They are. However,\nlinking labor conditions in low-income countries to trade deflects the emphasis from the real question to ask:\n\u201cWhat are acceptable and enforceable minimum labor standards and protections to have the world over?\u201d\n34.3Arguments in Support of Restricting Imports\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Explain and analyze various arguments that are in support of restricting imports, including the infant\nindustry argument, the anti-dumping argument, the environmental protection argument, the unsafe\nconsumer products argument, and the national interest argument\n\u2022 Explain dumping and race to the bottom\n\u2022 Evaluate the significance of countries\u2019 perceptions on the benefits of growing trade\nAs we previously noted, protectionism requires domestic consumers of a product to pay higher prices to\nbenefit domestic producers of that product. Countries that institute protectionist policies lose the economic\ngains achieved through a combination of comparative advantage, specialized learning, and economies of scale.\nWith these overall costs in mind, let us now consider, one by one, a number of arguments that support\nrestricting imports.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 34.3 \u2022 Arguments in Support of Restricting Imports 823\nThe Infant Industry Argument\nImagine Bhutan wants to start its own computer industry, but it has no computer firms that can produce at a\nlow enough price and high enough quality to compete in world markets. However, Bhutanese politicians,\nbusiness leaders, and workers hope that if the local industry had a chance to get established, before it needed\nto face international competition, then a domestic company or group of companies could develop the skills,\nmanagement, technology, and economies of scale that it needs to become a successful profit-earning domestic\nindustry. Thus, theinfant industry argumentfor protectionism is to block imports for a limited time, to give\nthe infant industry time to mature, before it starts competing on equal terms in the global economy. (Revisit\nMacroeconomic Policy Around the Worldfor more information on the infant industry argument.)\nThe infant industry argument is theoretically possible, even sensible: give an industry a short-term indirect\nsubsidy through protection, and then reap the long-term economic benefits of having a vibrant, healthy\nindustry. Implementation, however, is tricky. In many countries, infant industries have gone from babyhood to\nsenility and obsolescence without ever having reached the profitable maturity stage. Meanwhile, the\nprotectionism that was supposed to be short-term often took a very long time to be repealed.\nAs one example, Brazil treated its computer industry as an infant industry from the late 1970s until about\n1990. In an attempt to establish its computer industry in the global economy, Brazil largely barred imports of\ncomputer products for several decades. This policy guaranteed increased sales for Brazilian computers.\nHowever, by the mid-1980s, due to lack of international competition, Brazil had a backward and out-of-date\nindustry, typically lagging behind world standards for price and performance by three to five years\u2014a long\ntime in this fast-moving industry. After more than a decade, during which Brazilian consumers and industries\nthat would have benefited from up-to-date computers paid the costs and Brazil\u2019s computer industry never\ncompeted effectively on world markets, Brazil phased out its infant industry policy for the computer industry.\nProtectionism for infant industries always imposes costs on domestic users of the product, and typically has\nprovided little benefit in the form of stronger, competitive industries. However, several countries in East Asia\noffer an exception. Japan, Korea, Thailand, and other countries in this region have sometimes provided a\npackage of indirect and direct subsidies targeted at certain industries, including protection from foreign\ncompetition and government loans at interest rates below the market equilibrium. In Japan and Korea, for\nexample, subsidies helped get their domestic steel and auto industries up and running.\nWhy did the infant industry policy of protectionism and other subsidies work fairly well in East Asia? An early\n1990 World Bank study offered three guidelines to countries thinking about infant industry protection:\n1. Do not hand out protectionism and other subsidies to all industries, but focus on a few industries where\nyour country has a realistic chance to be a world-class producer.\n2. Be very hesitant about using protectionism in areas like computers, where many other industries rely on\nhaving the best products available, because it is not useful to help one industry by imposing high costs on\nmany other industries.\n3. Have clear guidelines for when the infant industry policy will end.\nIn Korea in the 1970s and 1980s, a common practice was to link protectionism and subsidies to export sales in\nglobal markets. If export sales rose, then the infant industry had succeeded and the government could phase\nout protectionism. If export sales did not rise, then the infant industry policy had failed and the government\ncould phase out protectionism. Either way, the protectionism would be temporary.\nFollowing these rules is easier said than done. Politics often intrudes, both in choosing which industries will\nreceive the benefits of treatment as \u201cinfants\u201d and when to phase out import restrictions and other subsidies.\nAlso, if the country's government wishes to impose costs on its citizens so that it can provide subsidies to a few\nkey industries, it has many tools for doing such as direct government payments, loans, targeted tax reductions,\nand government support of research and development of new technologies. In other words, protectionism is\nnot the only or even the best way to support key industries. 824 34 \u2022 Globalization and Protectionism\nLINK IT UP\nVisit thiswebsite(http://openstax.org/l/integration)to view a presentation by Pankaj Ghemawat questioning\nhow integrated the world really is.\nThe Anti-Dumping Argument\nDumpingrefers to selling goods below their cost of production.Anti-dumping lawsblock imports that are\nsold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their\ncost of production. Since dumping is not allowed underWorld Trade Organization (WTO)rules, nations that\nbelieve they are on the receiving end of dumped goods can file a complaint with the WTO. According to the\nWTO, between 1995 and 2020, it oversaw 137 anti-dumping disputes. Note that dumping cases are\ncountercyclical. During recessions, case filings increase. During economic booms, case filings go down.\nIndividual countries have also frequently started their own anti-dumping investigations. The U.S. government\nhas dozens of anti-dumping orders in place from past investigations. In 2022, for example, some U.S. imports\nthat were under anti-dumping orders included olives from Spain, steel from South Korea, coated paper from\nIndonesia, light commercial vehicles from Germany and Italy, fish fillets from Vietnam, and cellulose pulp\nfrom Canada.\nWhy Might Dumping Occur?\nWhy would foreign firms export a product at less than its cost of production\u2014which presumably means taking\na loss? This question has two possible answers, one innocent and one more sinister.\nThe innocent explanation is that demand and supply set market prices, not the cost of production. Perhaps\ndemand for a product shifts back to the left or supply shifts out to the right, which drives the market price to\nlow levels\u2014even below the cost of production. When a local store has a going-out-of-business sale, for example,\nit may sell goods at below the cost of production. If international companies find that there is excess supply of\nsteel or computer chips or machine tools that is driving the market price down below their cost of\nproduction\u2014this may be the market in action.\nThe sinister explanation is that dumping is part of a long-term strategy. Foreign firms sell goods at prices\nbelow the cost of production for a short period of time, and when they have driven out the domestic U.S.\ncompetition, they then raise prices. Economists sometimes call this scenario predatory pricing, which we\ndiscuss in theMonopolychapter.\nShould Anti-Dumping Cases Be Limited?\nAnti-dumping cases pose two questions. How much sense do they make in economic theory? How much sense\ndo they make as practical policy?\nIn terms of economic theory, the case for anti-dumping laws is weak. In a market governed by demand and\nsupply, the government does not guarantee that firms will be able to make a profit. After all, low prices are\ndifficult for producers, but benefit consumers. Moreover, although there are plenty of cases in which foreign\nproducers have driven out domestic firms, there are zero documented cases in which the foreign producers\nthen jacked up prices. Instead, foreign producers typically continue competing hard against each other and\nproviding low prices to consumers. In short, it is difficult to find evidence of predatory pricing by foreign firms\nexporting to the United States.\nEven if one could make a case that the government should sometimes enact anti-dumping rules in the short\nterm, and then allow free trade to resume shortly thereafter, there is a growing concern that anti-dumping\ninvestigations often involve more politics than careful analysis. The U.S. Commerce Department is charged\nwith calculating the appropriate \u201ccost of production,\u201d which can be as much an art as a science.\nFor example, if a company built a new factory two years ago, should it count part of the factory\u2019s cost in this\nAccess for free at openstax.org 34.3 \u2022 Arguments in Support of Restricting Imports 825\nyear\u2019s cost of production? When a company is in a country where the government controls prices, like China\nfor example, how can one measure the true cost of production? When a domestic industry complains loudly\nenough, government regulators seem very likely to find that unfair dumping has occurred. A common pattern\nhas arisen where a domestic industry files an anti-dumping complaint, the governments meet and negotiate a\nreduction in imports, and then the domestic producers drop the anti-dumping suit. In such cases, anti-\ndumping cases often appear to be little more than a cover story for imposing tariffs or import quotas.\nIn the 1980s, the United States, Canada, the European Union, Australia, and New Zealand implemented almost\nall the anti-dumping cases. By the 2000s, countries like Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, South Africa, Mexico,\nand India were filing the majority of the anti-dumping cases before the WTO. As the number of anti-dumping\ncases has increased, and as countries such as the United States and the European Union feel targeted by the\nanti-dumping actions of others, the WTO may well propose some additional guidelines to limit the reach of\nanti-dumping laws.\nThe Environmental Protection Argument\nThe potential for global trade to affect the environment has become controversial. A president of the Sierra\nClub, an environmental lobbying organization, once wrote: \u201cThe consequences of globalization for the\nenvironment are not good. \u2026 Globalization, if we are lucky, will raise average incomes enough to pay for\ncleaning up some of the mess that we have made. But before we get there, globalization could also destroy\nenough of the planet\u2019s basic biological and physical systems that prospects for life itself will be radically\ncompromised.\u201d\nIffree trademeant the destruction of life itself, then even economists would convert to protectionism! While\nglobalization\u2014and economic activity of all kinds\u2014can pose environmental dangers, it seems quite possible\nthat, with the appropriate safeguards in place, we can minimize the environmental impacts of trade. In some\ncases, trade may even bring environmental benefits.\nIn general,high-income countriessuch as the United States, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the\nnations of the European Union have relatively strict environmental standards. In contrast, middle- andlow-\nincome countrieslike Brazil, Nigeria, India, and China have lower environmental standards. The general view\nof the governments of such countries is that environmental protection is a luxury: as soon as their people have\nenough to eat, decent healthcare, and longer life expectancies, then they will spend more money on items such\nas sewage treatment plants, scrubbers to reduce air pollution from factory smokestacks, and national parks to\nprotect wildlife.\nThis gap in environmental standards between high-income and low-income countries raises two worrisome\npossibilities in a world of increasing global trade: the \u201crace to the bottom\u201d scenario and the question of how\nquickly environmental standards will improve in low-income countries.\nThe Race to the Bottom Scenario\nTherace to the bottomscenario of global environmental degradation runs like this. Profit-seeking\nmultinational companies shift their production from countries with strong environmental standards to\ncountries with weak standards, thus reducing their costs and increasing their profits. Faced with such\nbehavior, countries reduce their environmental standards to attract multinational firms, which, after all,\nprovide jobs and economic clout. As a result, global production becomes concentrated in countries where\nfirms can pollute the most and environmental laws everywhere \u201crace to the bottom.\u201d\nAlthough the race-to-the-bottom scenario sounds plausible, it does not appear to describe reality. In fact, the\nfinancial incentive for firms to shift production to poor countries to take advantage of their weaker\nenvironmental rules does not seem especially powerful. When firms decide where to locate a new factory, they\nlook at many different factors: the costs of labor and financial capital; whether the location is close to a reliable\nsuppliers of the inputs that they need; whether the location is close to customers; the quality of transportation, 826 34 \u2022 Globalization and Protectionism\ncommunications, and electrical power networks; the level of taxes; and the competence and honesty of the\nlocal government. The cost of environmental regulations is a factor, too, but typically environmental costs are\nno more than 1 to 2% of the costs that a large industrial plant faces. The other factors that determine location\nare much more important to these companies than trying to skimp on environmental protection costs.\nWhen an international company does choose to build a plant in a low-income country with lax environmental\nlaws, it typically builds a plant similar to those that it operates in high-income countries with stricter\nenvironmental standards. Part of the reason for this decision is that designing an industrial plant is a complex\nand costly task, and so if a plant works well in a high-income country, companies prefer to use the same design\neverywhere. Also, companies realize that if they create an environmental disaster in a low-income country, it is\nlikely to cost them a substantial amount of money in paying for damages, lost trust, and reduced sales\u2014by\nbuilding up-to-date plants everywhere they minimize such risks. As a result of these factors, foreign-owned\nplants in low-income countries often have a better record of compliance with environmental laws than do\nlocally-owned plants.\nPressuring Low-Income Countries for Higher Environmental Standards\nIn some cases, the issue is not so much whether globalization will pressure low-income countries to reduce\ntheir environmental standards, but instead whether the threat of blocking international trade can pressure\nthese countries into adopting stronger standards. For example, restrictions on ivory imports in high-income\ncountries, along with stronger government efforts to catch elephant poachers, have been credited with helping\nto reduce the illegal poaching of elephants in certain African countries.\nHowever, it would be highly undemocratic for the well-fed citizens of high-income countries to attempt to\ndictate to the ill-fed citizens of low-income countries what domestic policies and priorities they must adopt, or\nhow they should balance environmental goals against other priorities for their citizens. Furthermore, if high-\nincome countries want stronger environmental standards in low-income countries, they have many options\nother than the threat of protectionism. For example, high-income countries could pay for anti-pollution\nequipment in low-income countries, or could help to pay for national parks. High-income countries could help\npay for and carry out the scientific and economic studies that would help environmentalists in low-income\ncountries to make a more persuasive case for the economic benefits of protecting the environment.\nAfter all, environmental protection is vital to two industries of key importance in many low-income\ncountries\u2014agriculture and tourism. Environmental advocates can set up standards for labeling products, like\n\u201cthis tuna caught in a net that kept dolphins safe\u201d or \u201cthis product made only with wood not taken from\nrainforests,\u201d so that consumer pressure can reinforce environmentalist values. The United Nations also\nreinforces these values, by sponsoring treaties to address issues such as climate change and global warming,\nthe preservation of biodiversity, the spread of deserts, and the environmental health of the seabed. Countries\nthat share a national border or are within a region often sign environmental agreements about air and water\nrights, too. The WTO is also becoming more aware of environmental issues and more careful about ensuring\nthat increases in trade do not inflict environmental damage.\nFinally, note that these concerns about the race to the bottom or pressuring low-income countries for more\nstrict environmental standards do not apply very well to the roughly half of all U.S. trade that occurs with other\nhigh-income countries. Many European countries have stricter environmental standards in certain industries\nthan the United States.\nThe Unsafe Consumer Products Argument\nOne argument for shutting out certain imported products is that they are unsafe for consumers. Consumer\nrights groups have sometimes warned that the World Trade Organization would require nations to reduce their\nhealth and safety standards for imported products. However, the WTO explains its current agreement on the\nsubject in this way: \u201cIt allows countries to set their own standards.\u201d It also says \u201cregulations must be based on\nscience. . . . And they should not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate between countries where identical or\nAccess for free at openstax.org 34.3 \u2022 Arguments in Support of Restricting Imports 827\nsimilar conditions prevail.\u201d Thus, for example, under WTO rules it is perfectly legitimate for the United States\nto pass laws requiring thatallfood products or cars sold in the United States meet certain safety standards\napproved by the United States government, whether or not other countries choose to pass similar standards.\nHowever, such standards must have some scientific basis. It is improper to impose one set of health and safety\nstandards for domestically produced goods but a different set of standards for imports, or one set of standards\nfor imports from Europe and a different set of standards for imports from Latin America.\nIn 2007, Mattel recalled nearly two million toys imported from China due to concerns about high levels of lead\nin the paint, as well as some loose parts. It is unclear if other toys were subject to similar standards. In 2013,\nJapan blocked imports of U.S. wheat because of concerns that genetically modified (GMO) wheat might be\nincluded in the shipments. The science on the impact of GMOs on health is still developing.\nThe National Interest Argument\nSome argue that a nation should not depend too heavily on other countries for supplies of certain key products,\nsuch as oil, or for special materials or technologies that might have national security applications. On closer\nconsideration, this argument for protectionism proves rather weak.\nAs an example, in the United States, oil provides about 36% of all the energy and 21% of the oil used in the\nUnited States economy is imported. Several times in the last few decades, when disruptions in the Middle East\nhave shifted the supply curve of oil back to the left and sharply raised the price, the effects have been felt\nacross the United States economy. This is not, however, a very convincing argument for restricting oil imports.\nIf the United States needs to be protected from a possible cutoff of foreign oil, then a more reasonable strategy\nwould be to import 100% of the petroleum supply now, and save U.S. domestic oil resources for when or if the\nforeign supply is cut off. It might also be useful to import extra oil and put it into a stockpile for use in an\nemergency, as the United States government did by starting a Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 1977. Moreover,\nit may be necessary to discourage people from using oil, and to start a high-powered program to seek out\nalternatives to oil. A straightforward way to do this would be to raise taxes on oil. Additionally, it makes no\nsense to argue that because oil is highly important to the United States economy, then the United States should\nshut out oil imports and use up its domestic supplies more quickly. U.S. domestic oil production is increasing.\nShale oil is adding to domestic supply using fracking extraction techniques.\nWhether or not to limit certain kinds of imports of key technologies or materials that might be important to\nnational security and weapons systems is a slightly different issue. If weapons\u2019 builders are not confident that\nthey can continue to obtain a key product in wartime, they might decide to avoid designing weapons that use\nthis key product, or they can go ahead and design the weapons and stockpile enough of the key high-tech\ncomponents or materials to last through an armed conflict. There is a U.S. Defense National Stockpile Center\nthat has built up reserves of many materials, from aluminum oxides, antimony, and bauxite to tungsten,\nvegetable tannin extracts, and zinc (although many of these stockpiles have been reduced and sold in recent\nyears). Think every country is pro-trade? How about the U.S.? The following Clear It Up might surprise you.\nCLEAR IT UP\nHow does the United States really feel about expanding trade?\nHow do people around the world feel about expanding trade between nations? In summer 2007, the Pew\nFoundation surveyed 45,000 people in 47 countries. One of the questions asked about opinions on growing trade\nties between countries.Table 34.3shows the percentages who answered either \u201cvery good\u201d or \u201csomewhat good\u201d\nfor some of countries surveyed.\nFor those who think of the United States as the world\u2019s leading supporter of expanding trade, the survey results may\nbe perplexing. When adding up the shares of those who say that growing trade ties between countries is \u201cvery good\u201d\nor \u201csomewhat good,\u201d Americans had the least favorable attitude toward increasing globalization, while the Chinese 828 34 \u2022 Globalization and Protectionism\nand South Africans ranked highest. In fact, among the 47 countries surveyed, the United States ranked by far the\nlowest on this measure, followed by Egypt, Italy, and Argentina.\nCountry Very Good Somewhat Good Total\nChina 38% 53% 91%\nSouth Africa 42% 43% 87%\nSouth Korea 24% 62% 86%\nGermany 30% 55% 85%\nCanada 29% 53% 82%\nUnited Kingdom 28% 50% 78%\nMexico 22% 55% 77%\nBrazil 13% 59% 72%\nJapan 17% 55% 72%\nUnited States 14% 45% 59%\nTABLE34.3The Status of Growing Trade Ties between\nCountries(Source: http://www.pewglobal.org/files/pdf/\n258.pdf)\nOne final reason why economists often treat thenational interest argumentskeptically is that lobbyists and\npoliticians can tout almost any product as vital to national security. In 1954, the United States became worried\nthat it was importing half of the wool required for military uniforms, so it declared wool and mohair to be\n\u201cstrategic materials\u201d and began to give subsidies to wool and mohair farmers. Although the government\nremoved wool from the official list of \u201cstrategic\u201d materials in 1960, the subsidies for mohair continued for\nalmost 40 years until the government repealed them in 1993, and then reinstated them in 2002. All too often,\nthe national interest argument has become an excuse for handing out the indirect subsidy of protectionism to\ncertain industries or companies.

In the years\nafter the Great Depression and World War II, there was a worldwide push to build institutions that would tie the\nnations of the world together. The United Nations officially came into existence in 1945. The World Bank,\nwhich assists the poorest people in the world, and the International Monetary Fund, which addresses issues\nraised by international financial transactions, were both created in 1946. The third planned organization was\nto be an International Trade Organization, which would manage international trade. The United Nations was\nunable to agree to this. Instead, 27 nations signed theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)in\nGeneva, Switzerland on October 30, 1947 to provide a forum in which nations could come together to negotiate\nreductions in tariffs and other barriers to trade. In 1995, the GATT transformed into the WTO.\nThe GATT process was to negotiate an agreement to reduce barriers to trade, sign that agreement, pause for a\nwhile, and then start negotiating the next agreement.Table 34.4shows rounds of talks in the GATT, and now\nthe WTO. Notice that the early rounds of GATT talks took a relatively short time, included a small number of\ncountries, and focused almost entirely on reducing tariffs. Since the mid-1960s, however, rounds of trade talks\nhave taken years, included a large number of countries, and have included an ever-broadening range of issues.\nPlace or Number of\nYear Name of Main Subjects Countries\nRound Involved\n1947 Geneva Tariff reduction 23\n1949 Annecy Tariff reduction 13\n1951 Torquay Tariff reduction 38\n1956 Geneva Tariff reduction 26\n1960\u201361 Dillon round Tariff reduction 26\nKennedy\n1964\u201367 Tariffs, anti-dumping measures 62\nround\n1973\u201379 Tokyo round Tariffs, nontariff barriers 102\nUruguay Tariffs, nontariff barriers, services, intellectual property, dispute\n1986\u201394 123\nround settlement, textiles, agriculture, creation of WTO\nAgriculture, services, intellectual property, competition,\n2001\u2013 Doha round 147\ninvestment, environment, dispute settlement\nTABLE34.4The Negotiating Rounds of GATT and the World Trade Organization\nThe sluggish pace of GATT negotiations led to an old joke that GATT really stood for Gentleman\u2019s Agreement to\nTalk and Talk. The slow pace of international trade talks, however, is understandable, even sensible. Having\ndozens of nations agree to any treaty is a lengthy process. GATT often set up separate trading rules for certain\nindustries, like agriculture, and separate trading rules for certain countries, like the low-income countries.\nThere were rules, exceptions to rules, opportunities to opt out of rules, and precise wording to be fought over in\nevery case. Like the GATT before it, the WTO is not a world government, with power to impose its decisions on\nothers. The total staff of the WTO Secretariat in 2021 is 625 people and its annual budget (as of 2020) is $197\nmillion, which makes it smaller in size than many large universities. 830 34 \u2022 Globalization and Protectionism\nRegional Trading Agreements\nThere are different types of economic integration across the globe, ranging fromfree trade agreements, in\nwhich participants allow each other\u2019s imports without tariffs or quotas, tocommon markets, in which\nparticipants have a common external trade policy as well as free trade within the group, to fulleconomic\nunions, in which, in addition to a common market, monetary and fiscal policies are coordinated. Many nations\nbelong both to the World Trade Organization and to regional trading agreements.\nThe best known of these regional trading agreements is theEuropean Union. In the years after World War II,\nleaders of several European nations reasoned that if they could tie their economies together more closely, they\nmight be more likely to avoid another devastating war. Their efforts began with a free trade association,\nevolved into a common market, and then transformed into what is now a full economic union, known as the\nEuropean Union. The EU, as it is often called, has a number of goals. For example, in the early 2000s it\nintroduced a common currency for Europe, the euro, and phased out most of the former national forms of\nmoney like the German mark and the French franc, though a few have retained their own currency. Another\nkey element of the union is to eliminate barriers to the mobility of goods, labor, and capital across Europe. In\n2016, Britain voted to leave the European Union\u2014a move that was completed in January 2020.\nFor the United States, perhaps the best-known regional trading agreement is theNorth American Free Trade\n2\nAgreement (NAFTA). The United States also participates in some less-prominent regional trading\nagreements, like the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which offers reduced tariffs for imports from these countries,\nand a free trade agreement with Israel.\nThe world has seen a flood of regional trading agreements in recent years. About 100 such agreements are now\nin place.Table 34.5lists a few of the more prominent ones. Some are just agreements to continue talking.\nOthers set specific goals for reducing tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers. One economist described\nthe current trade treaties as a \u201cspaghetti bowl,\u201d which is what a map with lines connecting all the countries\nwith trade treaties looks like.\nThere is concern among economists who favor free trade that some of these regional agreements may promise\nfree trade, but actually act as a way for the countries within the regional agreement to try to limit trade from\nanywhere else. In some cases, the regional trade agreements may even conflict with the broader agreements of\nthe World Trade Organization.\nTrade\nParticipating Countries\nAgreements\nAsia Pacific\nAustralia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, People\u2019s Republic of China, Hong Kong, China, Indonesia,\nEconomic\nJapan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru,\nCooperation\nPhilippines, Russia, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, United States, Vietnam\n(APEC)\nAustria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France,\nEuropean Union\nGermany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands,\n(EU)\nPoland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom*\nTABLE34.5Some Regional Trade Agreements* Following the 2016 referendum vote to leave the European Union,\nthe UK government triggered the withdrawal process on March 29, 2017, setting the date for the UK to leave by\nApril 2019.

Also, as of 2020, NAFTA has been replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) free trade\nagreement.\nTrade Policy at the National Level\nYet another dimension of trade policy, along with international and regional trade agreements, happens at the\nnational level. The United States, for example, imposes import quotas on sugar, because of a fear that such\nimports would drive down the price of sugar and thus injure domestic sugar producers. One of the jobs of the\nUnited States Department of Commerce is to determine if there is import dumping from other countries. The\nUnited States International Trade Commission\u2014a government agency\u2014determines whether the dumping has\nsubstantially injured domestic industries, and if so, the president can impose tariffs that are intended to offset\nthe unfairly low price.\nIn the arena of trade policy, the battle often seems to be between national laws that increase protectionism and\ninternational agreements that try to reduce protectionism, like the WTO. Why would a country pass laws or\nnegotiate agreements to shut out certain foreign products, like sugar or textiles, while simultaneously\nnegotiating to reduce trade barriers in general? One plausible answer is that international trade agreements\noffer a method for countries to restrain their own special interests. A member of Congress can say to an\nindustry lobbying for tariffs or quotas on imports: \u201cSure would like to help you, but that pesky WTO agreement\njust won\u2019t let me.\u201d\nLINK IT UP\nIf consumers are the biggest losers from trade, why do they not fight back? The quick answer is because it is\neasier to organize a small group of people around a narrow interest (producers) versus a large group that has\ndiffuse interests (consumers). This is a question about trade policy theory. Visit thiswebsite\n(http://openstax.org/l/tradepolicy)and read the article by Jonathan Rauch. 832 34 \u2022 Globalization and Protectionism\nLong-Term Trends in Barriers to Trade\nIn newspaper headlines, trade policy appears mostly as disputes and acrimony. Countries are almost\nconstantly threatening to challenge other nations' \u201cunfair\u201d trading practices. Cases are brought to the dispute\nsettlement procedures of the WTO, the European Union, NAFTA, and other regional trading agreements.\nPoliticians in national legislatures, goaded on by lobbyists, often threaten to pass bills that will \u201cestablish a fair\nplaying field\u201d or \u201cprevent unfair trade\u201d\u2014although most such bills seek to accomplish these high-sounding\ngoals by placing more restrictions on trade. Protesters in the streets may object to specific trade rules or to the\nentire practice of international trade.\nThrough all the controversy, the general trend in the last 60 years is clearly toward lower barriers to trade. The\naverage level of tariffs on imported products charged by industrialized countries was 40% in 1946. By 1990,\nafter decades of GATT negotiations, it was down to less than 5%. One of the reasons that GATT negotiations\nshifted from focusing on tariff reduction in the early rounds to a broader agenda was that tariffs had been\nreduced so dramatically there was not much more to do in that area. U.S. tariffs have followed this general\npattern: After rising sharply during the Great Depression, tariffs dropped off to less than 2% by the end of the\ncentury. Although measures of import quotas and nontariff barriers are less exact than those for tariffs, they\ngenerally appear to be at lower levels than they had been previously, too.\nThus, the last half-century has seen both a dramatic reduction in government-created barriers to trade, such\nas tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers, and also a number of technological developments that have\nmade international trade easier, like advances in transportation, communication, and information\nmanagement. The result has been the powerful surge of international trade.\nThese trends were altered by two important events in 2016: the UK vote to leave the EU and the election of\nPresident Trump in the United States, whose administration pursued a policy of raising trade barriers. In\n2018, tariffs on a broad range of imports from China were raised by around 25%. As of 2022, the UK has been\nout of the EU for two years, and it remains unclear if President Biden\u2019s administration will adjust or remove\nPresident Trump\u2019s trade barriers.\n34.5The Tradeoffs of Trade Policy\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\u2022 Asses the complexity of international trade\n\u2022 Discuss why a market-oriented economy is so affected by international trade\n\u2022 Explain disruptive market change\nEconomists readily acknowledge that international trade is not all sunshine, roses, and happy endings. Over\ntime, the average person gains from international trade, both as a worker who has greater productivity and\nhigher wages because of the benefits of specialization and comparative advantage, and as a consumer who can\nbenefit from shopping all over the world for a greater variety of quality products at attractive prices. The\n\u201caverage person,\u201d however, is hypothetical, not real\u2014representing a mix of those who have done very well,\nthose who have done all right, and those who have done poorly. It is a legitimate concern of public policy to\nfocus not just on the average or on the success stories, but also on those who have not been so fortunate.\nWorkers in other countries, the environment, and prospects for new industries and materials that might be of\nkey importance to the national economy are also all legitimate issues.\nThe common belief among economists is that it is better to embrace the gains from trade, and then deal with\nthe costs and tradeoffs with other policy tools, than it is to cut off trade to avoid the costs and tradeoffs.\nTo gain a better intuitive understanding for this argument, consider a hypothetical American company called\nTechnotron. Technotron invents a new scientific technology that allows the firm to increase the output and\nquality of its goods with a smaller number of workers at a lower cost. As a result of this technology, other U.S.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 34.5 \u2022 The Tradeoffs of Trade Policy 833\nfirms in this industry will lose money and will also have to lay off workers\u2014and some of the competing firms\nwill even go bankrupt. Should the United States government protect the existing firms and their employees by\nmaking it illegal for Technotron to use its new technology? Most people who live in market-oriented economies\nwould oppose trying to block better products that lower the cost of services. Certainly, there is a case for\nsociety providing temporary support and assistance for those who find themselves without work. Many would\nargue for government support of programs that encourage retraining and acquiring additional skills.\nGovernment might also support research and development efforts, so that other firms may find ways of\noutdoing Technotron. Blocking the new technology altogether, however, seems like a mistake. After all, few\npeople would advocate giving up electricity because it caused so much disruption to the kerosene and candle\nbusiness. Few would suggest holding back on improvements in medical technology because they might cause\ncompanies selling leeches and snake oil to lose money. In short, most people view disruptions due to\ntechnological change as a necessary cost that is worth bearing.\nNow, imagine that Technotron\u2019s new \u201ctechnology\u201d is as simple as this: the company imports what it sells from\nanother country. In other words, think of foreign trade as a type of innovative technology. The objective\nsituation is now exactly the same as before. Because of Technotron\u2019s new technology\u2014which in this case is\nimporting goods from another county\u2014other firms in this industry will lose money and lay off workers. Just as\nit would have been inappropriate and ultimately foolish to respond to the disruptions of new scientific\ntechnology by trying to shut it down, it would be inappropriate and ultimately foolish to respond to the\ndisruptions ofinternational tradeby trying to restrict trade.\nSome workers and firms will suffer because of international trade. In a living, breathing market-oriented\neconomy, some workers and firms will always be experiencing disruptions, for a wide variety of reasons.\nCorporate management can be better or worse. Workers for a certain firm can be more or less productive.\nTough domestic competitors can create just as much disruption as tough foreign competitors. Sometimes a\nnew product is a hit with consumers; sometimes it is a flop. Sometimes a company is blessed by a run of good\nluck or stricken with a run of bad luck. For some firms, international trade will offer great opportunities for\nexpanding productivity and jobs; for other firms, trade will impose stress and pain. The disruption caused by\ninternational trade is not fundamentally different from all the other disruptions caused by the other workings\nof a market economy.\nIn other words, the economic analysis of free trade does not rely on a belief that foreign trade is not disruptive\nor does not pose tradeoffs; indeed, the story of Technotron begins with a particulardisruptive market\nchange\u2014a new technology\u2014that causes real tradeoffs. In thinking about the disruptions of foreign trade, or any\nof the other possible costs and tradeoffs of foreign trade discussed in this chapter, the best public policy\nsolutions typically do not involve protectionism, but instead involve finding ways for public policy to address\nthe particular issues resulting from these disruptions, costs, and tradeoffs, while still allowing the benefits of\ninternational trade to occur.\nBRING IT HOME\nWhat\u2019s the Downside of Protection?\nThe domestic flat-panel display industry employed many workers before the ITC imposed the dumping margin tax.\nFlat-panel displays make up a significant portion of the cost of producing laptop computers\u2014as much as 50%.\nTherefore, the antidumping tax would substantially increase the cost, and thus the price, of U.S.-manufactured\nlaptops. As a result of the ITC\u2019s decision, Apple moved its domestic manufacturing plant for Macintosh computers to\nIreland (where it had an existing plant). Toshiba shut down its U.S. manufacturing plant for laptops. And IBM\ncancelled plans to open a laptop manufacturing plant in North Carolina, instead deciding to expand production at its\nplant in Japan. In this case, rather than having the desired effect of protecting U.S. interests and giving domestic\nmanufacturing an advantage over items manufactured elsewhere, it had the unintended effect of driving the 834 34 \u2022 Globalization and Protectionism\nmanufacturing completely out of the country. Many people lost their jobs and most flat-panel display production\nnow occurs in countries other than the United States.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 34 \u2022 Key Terms 835\nKey Terms\nanti-dumping lawslaws that block imports sold below the cost of production and impose tariffs that would\nincrease the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production\ncommon marketeconomic agreement between countries to allow free trade in goods, services, labor, and\nfinancial capital between members while having a common external trade policy\ndisruptive market changeinnovative new product or production technology which disrupts the status quo in\na market, leading the innovators to earn more income and profits and the other firms to lose income and\nprofits, unless they can come up with their own innovations\ndumpingselling internationally traded goods below their cost of production\neconomic unioneconomic agreement between countries to allow free trade between members, a common\nexternal trade policy, and coordinated monetary and fiscal policies\nfree trade agreementeconomic agreement between countries to allow free trade between members\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)forum in which nations could come together to negotiate\nreductions in tariffs and other barriers to trade; the precursor to the World Trade Organization\nimport quotasnumerical limits on the quantity of products that a country can import\nnational interest argumentthe argument that there are compelling national interests against depending on\nkey imports from other nations\nnontariff barriersways a nation can draw up rules, regulations, inspections, and paperwork to make it more\ncostly or difficult to import products\nprotectionismgovernment policies to reduce or block imports\nrace to the bottomwhen production locates in countries with the lowest environmental (or other) standards,\nputting pressure on all countries to reduce their environmental standards\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO)organization that seeks to negotiate reductions in barriers to trade and to\nadjudicate complaints about violations of international trade policy; successor to the General Agreement\non Tariffs and Trade (GATT)\nKey Concepts and Summary\n34.1Protectionism: An Indirect Subsidy from Consumers to Producers\nThere are three tools for restricting the flow of trade: tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers. When a\ncountry places limitations on imports from abroad, regardless of whether it uses tariffs, quotas, or nontariff\nbarriers, it is said to be practicing protectionism. Protectionism will raise the price of the protected good in the\ndomestic market, which causes domestic consumers to pay more, but domestic producers to earn more.\n34.2International Trade and Its Effects on Jobs, Wages, and Working Conditions\nAs international trade increases, it contributes to a shift in jobs away from industries where that economy does\nnot have a comparative advantage and toward industries where it does have a comparative advantage. The\ndegree to which trade affects labor markets has much to do with the structure of the labor market in that\ncountry and the adjustment process in other industries. Global trade should raise the average level of wages by\nincreasing productivity. However, this increase in average wages may include both gains to workers in certain\njobs and industries and losses to others.\nIn thinking about labor practices in low-income countries, it is useful to draw a line between what is\nunpleasant to think about and what is morally objectionable. For example, low wages and long working hours\nin poor countries are unpleasant to think about, but for people in low-income parts of the world, it may well be\nthe best option open to them. Practices like child labor and forced labor are morally objectionable and many\ncountries refuse to import products made using these practices.\n34.3Arguments in Support of Restricting Imports\nThere are a number of arguments that support restricting imports. These arguments are based around 836 34 \u2022 Self-Check Questions\nindustry and competition, environmental concerns, and issues of safety and security.\nThe infant industry argument for protectionism is that small domestic industries need to be temporarily\nnurtured and protected from foreign competition for a time so that they can grow into strong competitors. In\nsome cases, notably in East Asia, this approach has worked. Often, however, the infant industries never grow\nup. On the other hand, arguments against dumping (which is setting prices below the cost of production to\ndrive competitors out of the market), often simply seem to be a convenient excuse for imposing protectionism.\nLow-income countries typically have lower environmental standards than high-income countries because they\nare more worried about immediate basics such as food, education, and healthcare. However, except for a small\nnumber of extreme cases, shutting off trade seems unlikely to be an effective method of pursuing a cleaner\nenvironment.\nFinally, there are arguments involving safety and security. Under the rules of the World Trade Organization,\ncountries are allowed to set whatever standards for product safety they wish, but the standards must be the\nsame for domestic products as for imported products and there must be a scientific basis for the standard. The\nnational interest argument for protectionism holds that it is unwise to import certain key products because if\nthe nation becomes dependent on key imported supplies, it could be vulnerable to a cutoff. However, it is often\nwiser to stockpile resources and to use foreign supplies when available, rather than preemptively restricting\nforeign supplies so as not to become dependent on them.\n34.4How Governments Enact Trade Policy: Globally, Regionally, and Nationally\nGovernments determine trade policy at many different levels: administrative agencies within government,\nlaws passed by the legislature, regional negotiations between a small group of nations (sometimes just two),\nand global negotiations through the World Trade Organization. During the second half of the twentieth century,\ntrade barriers have, in general, declined quite substantially in the United States economy and in the global\neconomy. One reason why countries sign international trade agreements to commit themselves to free trade is\nto give themselves protection against their own special interests. When an industry lobbies for protection from\nforeign producers, politicians can point out that, because of the trade treaty, their hands are tied.\n34.5The Tradeoffs of Trade Policy\nInternational trade certainly has income distribution effects. This is hardly surprising. All domestic or\ninternational competitive market forces are disruptive. They cause companies and industries to rise and fall.\nGovernment has a role to play in cushioning workers against the disruptions of the market. However, just as it\nwould be unwise in the long term to clamp down on new technology and other causes of disruption in domestic\nmarkets, it would be unwise to clamp down on foreign trade. In both cases, the disruption brings with it\neconomic benefits.\nSelf-Check Questions\n1.

Economics is not math. There\nis no important concept in this course that cannot be explained without mathematics. That said, math is a tool\nthat can be used to illustrate economic concepts. Remember the saying a picture is worth a thousand words?\nInstead of a picture, think of a graph. It is the same thing. Economists use models as the primary tool to derive\ninsights about economic issues and problems. Math is one way of working with (or manipulating) economic\nmodels.\nThere are other ways of representing models, such as text or narrative. But why would you use your fist to bang\na nail, if you had a hammer? Math has certain advantages over text. It disciplines your thinking by making you\nspecify exactly what you mean. You can get away with fuzzy thinking in your head, but you cannot when you\nreduce a model to algebraic equations. At the same time, math also has disadvantages. Mathematical models\nare necessarily based on simplifying assumptions, so they are not likely to be perfectly realistic. Mathematical\nmodels also lack the nuances which can be found in narrative models. The point is that math is one tool, but it\nis not the only tool or even always the best tool economists can use. So what math will you need for this book?\nThe answer is: little more than high school algebra and graphs. You will need to know:\n\u2022 What a function is\n\u2022 How to interpret the equation of a line (i.e., slope and intercept)\n\u2022 How to manipulate a line (i.e., changing the slope or the intercept)\n\u2022 How to compute and interpret a growth rate (i.e., percentage change)\n\u2022 How to read and manipulate a graph\nIn this text, we will use the easiest math possible, and we will introduce it in this appendix. So if you find some\nmath in the book that you cannot follow, come back to this appendix to review. Like most things, math has\ndiminishing returns. A little math ability goes a long way; the more advanced math you bring in, the less\nadditional knowledge that will get you. That said, if you are going to major in economics, you should consider\nlearning a little calculus. It will be worth your while in terms of helping you learn advanced economics more\nquickly.\nAlgebraic Models\nOften economic models (or parts of models) are expressed in terms of mathematical functions. What is a\nfunction? Afunctiondescribes a relationship. Sometimes the relationship is a definition. For example (using\nwords), your professor is Adam Smith. This could be expressed as Professor = Adam Smith. Or Friends = Bob +\nShawn + Margaret.\nOften in economics, functions describe cause and effect. The variable on the left-hand side is what is being\nexplained (\u201cthe effect\u201d). On the right-hand side is what is doing the explaining (\u201cthe causes\u201d). For example,\nsuppose your GPA was determined as follows:\nThis equation states that your GPA depends on three things: your combined SAT score, your class attendance,\nand the number of hours you spend studying. It also says that study time is twice as important (0.50) as either\ncombined_SAT score (0.25) or class_attendance (0.25). If this relationship is true, how could you raise your\nGPA? By not skipping class and studying more. Note that you cannot do anything about your SAT score, since if\nyou are in college, you have (presumably) already taken the SATs.\nOf course, economic models express relationships using economic variables, like Budget = 842 A \u2022 The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics\nmoney_spent_on_econ_books + money_spent_on_music, assuming that the only things you buy are\neconomics books and music.\nMost of the relationships we use in this course are expressed as linear equations of the form:\nExpressing Equations Graphically\nGraphs are useful for two purposes. The first is to express equations visually, and the second is to display\nstatistics or data. This section will discuss expressing equations visually.\nTo a mathematician or an economist, avariableis the name given to a quantity that may assume a range of\nvalues. In the equation of a line presented above, x and y are the variables, with x on the horizontal axis and y\non the vertical axis, and b and m representing factors that determine the shape of the line. To see how this\nequation works, consider a numerical example:\nIn this equation for a specific line, the b term has been set equal to 9 and the m term has been set equal to 3.\nTable A1shows the values of x and y for this given equation.Figure A1shows this equation, and these values,\nin a graph. To construct the table, just plug in a series of different values for x, and then calculate what value of\ny results. In the figure, these points are plotted and a line is drawn through them.\nx y\n0 9\n1 12\n2 15\n3 18\n4 21\n5 24\n6 27\nTABLE\nA1\nValues\nfor the\nSlope\nIntercept\nEquation\nAccess for free at openstax.org A \u2022 The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics 843\nFIGUREA1Slope and the Algebra of Straight LinesThis line graph hasxon the horizontal axis and y on the vertical\naxis. The y-intercept\u2014that is, the point where the line intersects the y-axis\u2014is 9. The slope of the line is 3; that is,\nthere is a rise of 3 on the vertical axis for every increase of 1 on the horizontal axis. The slope is the same all along a\nstraight line.\nThis example illustrates how the b and m terms in an equation for a straight line determine the shape of the\nline. The b term is called the y-intercept. The reason for this name is that, if x = 0, then the b term will reveal\nwhere the line intercepts, or crosses, the y-axis. In this example, the line hits the vertical axis at 9. The m term\nin the equation for the line is the slope. Remember thatslopeis defined as rise over run; more specifically, the\nslope of a line from one point to another is the change in the vertical axis divided by the change in the\nhorizontal axis. In this example, each time the x term increases by one (the run), the y term rises by three.\nThus, the slope of this line is three. Specifying a y-intercept and a slope\u2014that is, specifying b and m in the\nequation for a line\u2014will identify a specific line. Although it is rare for real-world data points to arrange\nthemselves as an exact straight line, it often turns out that a straight line can offer a reasonable approximation\nof actual data.\nInterpreting the Slope\nThe concept of slope is very useful in economics, because it measures the relationship between two variables.\nApositive slopemeans that two variables are positively related; that is, when x increases, so does y, or when x\ndecreases, y decreases also. Graphically, a positive slope means that as a line on the line graph moves from left\nto right, the line rises. The length-weight relationship, shown inFigure A3later in this Appendix, has a positive\nslope. We will learn in other chapters that price and quantity supplied have a positive relationship; that is,\nfirms will supply more when the price is higher.\nAnegative slopemeans that two variables are negatively related; that is, when x increases, y decreases, or\nwhen x decreases, y increases. Graphically, a negative slope means that, as the line on the line graph moves\nfrom left to right, the line falls. The altitude-air density relationship, shown inFigure A4later in this appendix,\nhas a negative slope. We will learn that price and quantity demanded have a negative relationship; that is,\nconsumers will purchase less when the price is higher.\nA slope of zero means that there is no relationship between x and y. Graphically, the line is flat; that is, zero rise\nover the run.Figure A5of the unemployment rate, shown later in this appendix, illustrates a common pattern\nof many line graphs: some segments where the slope is positive, other segments where the slope is negative,\nand still other segments where the slope is close to zero.\nThe slope of a straight line between two points can be calculated in numerical terms. To calculate slope, begin\nby designating one point as the \u201cstarting point\u201d and the other point as the \u201cend point\u201d and then calculating the\nrise over run between these two points. As an example, consider the slope of the air density graph between the 844 A \u2022 The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics\npoints representing an altitude of 4,000 meters and an altitude of 6,000 meters:\nRise: Change in variable on vertical axis (end point minus original point)\nRun: Change in variable on horizontal axis (end point minus original point)\nThus, the slope of a straight line between these two points would be that from the altitude of 4,000 meters up to\n6,000 meters, the density of the air decreases by approximately 0.1 kilograms/cubic meter for each of the next\n1,000 meters.\nSuppose the slope of a line were to increase. Graphically, that means it would get steeper. Suppose the slope of\na line were to decrease. Then it would get flatter. These conditions are true whether or not the slope was\npositive or negative to begin with. A higher positive slope means a steeper upward tilt to the line, while a\nsmaller positive slope means a flatter upward tilt to the line. A negative slope that is larger in absolute value\n(that is, more negative) means a steeper downward tilt to the line. A slope of zero is a horizontal flat line. A\nvertical line has an infinite slope.\nSuppose a line has a larger intercept. Graphically, that means it would shift out (or up) from the old origin,\nparallel to the old line. If a line has a smaller intercept, it would shift in (or down), parallel to the old line.\nSolving Models with Algebra\nEconomists often use models to answer a specific question, like: What will the unemployment rate be if the\neconomy grows at 3% per year? Answering specific questions requires solving the \u201csystem\u201d of equations that\nrepresent the model.\nSuppose the demand for personal pizzas is given by the following equation:\nwhere Qd is the amount of personal pizzas consumers want to buy (i.e., quantity demanded), and P is the price\nof pizzas. Suppose the supply of personal pizzas is:\nwhere Qs is the amount of pizza producers will supply (i.e., quantity supplied).\nFinally, suppose that the personal pizza market operates where supply equals demand, or\nWe now have a system of three equations and three unknowns (Qd, Qs, and P), which we can solve with algebra:\nSince Qd = Qs, we can set the demand and supply equation equal to each other:\nSubtracting 2 from both sides and adding 2P to both sides yields:\nIn other words, the price of each personal pizza will be $2. How much will consumers buy?\nAccess for free at openstax.org A \u2022 The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics 845\nTaking the price of $2, and plugging it into the demand equation, we get:\nSo if the price is $2 each, consumers will purchase 12. How much will producers supply? Taking the price of\n$2, and plugging it into the supply equation, we get:\nSo if the price is $2 each, producers will supply 12 personal pizzas. This means we did our math correctly,\nsince Qd = Qs.\nSolving Models with Graphs\nIf algebra is not your forte, you can get the same answer by using graphs. Take the equations for Qd and Qs and\ngraph them on the same set of axes as shown inFigure A2. Since P is on the vertical axis, it is easiest if you\nsolve each equation for P. The demand curve is then P = 8 \u2013 0.5Qd and the supply curve is P = \u20130.4 + 0.2Qs.\nNote that the vertical intercepts are 8 and \u20130.4, and the slopes are \u20130.5 for demand and 0.2 for supply. If you\ndraw the graphs carefully, you will see that where they cross (Qs = Qd), the price is $2 and the quantity is 12,\njust like the algebra predicted.\nFIGUREA2Supply and Demand GraphThe equations for Qd and Qs are displayed graphically by the sloped lines.\nWe will use graphs more frequently in this book than algebra, but now you know the math behind the graphs.\nGrowth Rates\nGrowth rates are frequently encountered in real world economics. Agrowth rateis simply the percentage\nchange in some quantity. It could be your income. It could be a business\u2019s sales. It could be a nation\u2019s GDP. The\nformula for computing a growth rate is straightforward:\nSuppose your job pays $10 per hour. Your boss, however, is so impressed with your work that he gives you a $2\nper hour raise. The percentage change (or growth rate) in your pay is $2/$10 = 0.20 or 20%.\nTo compute the growth rate for data over an extended period of time, for example, the average annual growth\nin GDP over a decade or more, the denominator is commonly defined a little differently. In the previous\nexample, we defined the quantity as the initial quantity\u2014or the quantity when we started. This is fine for a one-\ntime calculation, but when we compute the growth over and over, it makes more sense to define the quantity as\nthe average quantity over the period in question, which is defined as the quantity halfway between the initial 846 A \u2022 The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics\nquantity and the next quantity. This is harder to explain in words than to show with an example. Suppose a\nnation\u2019s GDP was $1 trillion in 2005 and $1.03 trillion in 2006. The growth rate between 2005 and 2006 would\nbe the change in GDP ($1.03 trillion \u2013 $1.00 trillion) divided by the average GDP between 2005 and 2006 ($1.03\ntrillion + $1.00 trillion)/2. In other words:\nNote that if we used the first method, the calculation would be ($1.03 trillion \u2013 $1.00 trillion) / $1.00 trillion =\n3% growth, which is approximately the same as the second, more complicated method. If you need a rough\napproximation, use the first method. If you need accuracy, use the second method.\nA few things to remember: A positive growth rate means the quantity is growing. A smaller growth rate means\nthe quantity is growing more slowly. A larger growth rate means the quantity is growing more quickly. A\nnegative growth rate means the quantity is decreasing.\nThe same change over times yields a smaller growth rate. If you got a $2 raise each year, in the first year the\ngrowth rate would be $2/$10 = 20%, as shown above. But in the second year, the growth rate would be $2/$12 =\n0.167 or 16.7% growth. In the third year, the same $2 raise would correspond to a $2/$14 = 14.2%. The moral\nof the story is this: To keep the growth rate the same, the change must increase each period.\nDisplaying Data Graphically and Interpreting the Graph\nGraphs are also used to display data or evidence. Graphs are a method of presenting numerical patterns. They\ncondense detailed numerical information into a visual form in which relationships and numerical patterns can\nbe seen more easily. For example, which countries have larger or smaller populations? A careful reader could\nexamine a long list of numbers representing the populations of many countries, but with over 200 nations in\nthe world, searching through such a list would take concentration and time. Putting these same numbers on a\ngraph can quickly reveal population patterns. Economists use graphs both for a compact and readable\npresentation of groups of numbers and for building an intuitive grasp of relationships and connections.\nThree types of graphs are used in this book: line graphs, pie graphs, and bar graphs. Each is discussed below.\nWe also provide warnings about how graphs can be manipulated to alter viewers\u2019 perceptions of the\nrelationships in the data.\nLine Graphs\nThe graphs we have discussed so far are calledline graphs, because they show a relationship between two\nvariables: one measured on the horizontal axis and the other measured on the vertical axis.\nSometimes it is useful to show more than one set of data on the same axes. The data inTable A2is displayed in\nFigure A3which shows the relationship between two variables: length and median weight for American baby\nboys and girls during the first three years of life. (Themedianmeans that half of all babies weigh more than\nthis and half weigh less.) The line graph measures length in inches on the horizontal axis and weight in pounds\non the vertical axis. For example, point A on the figure shows that a boy who is 28 inches long will have a\nmedian weight of about 19 pounds. One line on the graph shows the length-weight relationship for boys and\nthe other line shows the relationship for girls. This kind of graph is widely used by healthcare providers to\ncheck whether a child\u2019s physical development is roughly on track.\nAccess for free at openstax.org A \u2022 The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics 847\nFIGUREA3The Length-Weight Relationship for American Boys and GirlsThe line graph shows the relationship\nbetween height and weight for boys and girls from birth to 3 years. Point A, for example, shows that a boy of 28\ninches in height (measured on the horizontal axis) is typically 19 pounds in weight (measured on the vertical axis).\nThese data apply only to children in the first three years of life.\nBoys from Birth to 36 Months Girls from Birth to 36 Months\nLength (inches) Weight (pounds) Length (inches) Weight (pounds)\n20.0 8.0 20.0 7.9\n22.0 10.5 22.0 10.5\n24.0 13.5 24.0 13.2\n26.0 16.4 26.0 16.0\n28.0 19.0 28.0 18.8\n30.0 21.8 30.0 21.2\n32.0 24.3 32.0 24.0\n34.0 27.0 34.0 26.2\n36.0 29.3 36.0 28.9\n38.0 32.0 38.0 31.3\nTABLEA2Length to Weight Relationship for American Boys and Girls\nNot all relationships in economics are linear. Sometimes they are curves.Figure A4presents another example\nof a line graph, representing the data fromTable A3. In this case, the line graph shows how thin the air\nbecomes when you climb a mountain. The horizontal axis of the figure shows altitude, measured in meters\nabove sea level. The vertical axis measures the density of the air at each altitude. Air density is measured by\nthe weight of the air in a cubic meter of space (that is, a box measuring one meter in height, width, and depth). 848 A \u2022 The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics\nAs the graph shows, air pressure is heaviest at ground level and becomes lighter as you climb.Figure A4shows\nthat a cubic meter of air at an altitude of 500 meters weighs approximately one kilogram (about 2.2 pounds).\nHowever, as the altitude increases, air density decreases. A cubic meter of air at the top of Mount Everest, at\nabout 8,828 meters, would weigh only 0.023 kilograms. The thin air at high altitudes explains why many\nmountain climbers need to use oxygen tanks as they reach the top of a mountain.\nFIGUREA4Altitude-Air Density RelationshipThis line graph shows the relationship between altitude, measured in\nmeters above sea level, and air density, measured in kilograms of air per cubic meter. As altitude rises, air density\ndeclines. The point at the top of Mount Everest has an altitude of approximately 8,828 meters above sea level (the\nhorizontal axis) and air density of 0.023 kilograms per cubic meter (the vertical axis).\nAltitude (meters) Air Density (kg/cubic meters)\n0 1.200\n500 1.093\n1,000 0.831\n1,500 0.678\n2,000 0.569\n2,500 0.484\n3,000 0.415\n3,500 0.357\n4,000 0.307\n4,500 0.231\n5,000 0.182\nTABLEA3Altitude to Air Density Relationship\nAccess for free at openstax.org A \u2022 The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics 849\nAltitude (meters) Air Density (kg/cubic meters)\n5,500 0.142\n6,000 0.100\n6,500 0.085\n7,000 0.066\n7,500 0.051\n8,000 0.041\n8,500 0.025\n9,000 0.022\n9,500 0.019\n10,000 0.014\nTABLEA3Altitude to Air Density Relationship\nThe length-weight relationship and the altitude-air density relationships in these two figures represent\naverages. If you were to collect actual data on air pressure at different altitudes, the same altitude in different\ngeographic locations will have slightly different air density, depending on factors like how far you are from the\nequator, local weather conditions, and the humidity in the air. Similarly, in measuring the height and weight of\nchildren for the previous line graph, children of a particular height would have a range of different weights,\nsome above average and some below. In the real world, this sort of variation in data is common. The task of a\nresearcher is to organize that data in a way that helps to understand typical patterns. The study of statistics,\nespecially when combined with computer statistics and spreadsheet programs, is a great help in organizing\nthis kind of data, plotting line graphs, and looking for typical underlying relationships. For most economics\nand social science majors, a statistics course will be required at some point.\nOne common line graph is called atime series, in which the horizontal axis shows time and the vertical axis\ndisplays another variable. Thus, a time series graph shows how a variable changes over time.Figure A5shows\nthe unemployment rate in the United States since 1975, where unemployment is defined as the percentage of\nadults who want jobs and are looking for a job, but cannot find one. The points for the unemployment rate in\neach year are plotted on the graph, and a line then connects the points, showing how the unemployment rate\nhas moved up and down since 1975. The line graph makes it easy to see, for example, that the highest\nunemployment rate during this time period was slightly less than 10% in the early 1980s and 2010, while the\nunemployment rate declined from the early 1990s to the end of the 1990s, before rising and then falling back\nin the early 2000s, and then rising sharply during the recession from 2008\u20132009. 850 A \u2022 The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics\nFIGUREA5U.S. Unemployment Rate, 1975\u20132014This graph provides a quick visual summary of unemployment\ndata. With a graph like this, it is easy to spot the times of high unemployment and of low unemployment.\nPie Graphs\nApie graph(sometimes called apie chart) is used to show how an overall total is divided into parts. A circle\nrepresents a group as a whole. The slices of this circular \u201cpie\u201d show the relative sizes of subgroups.\nFigure A6shows how the U.S. population was divided among children, working age adults, and the elderly in\n1970, 2000, and what is projected for 2030. The information is first conveyed with numbers inTable A4, and\nthen in three pie charts. The first column ofTable A4shows the total U.S. population for each of the three\nyears. Columns 2\u20134 categorize the total in terms of age groups\u2014from birth to 18 years, from 19 to 64 years, and\n65 years and above. In columns 2\u20134, the first number shows the actual number of people in each age category,\nwhile the number in parentheses shows the percentage of the total population comprised by that age group.\nYear Total Population 19 and Under 20\u201364 years Over 65\n1970 205.0 million 77.2 (37.6%) 107.7 (52.5%) 20.1 (9.8%)\n2000 275.4 million 78.4 (28.5%) 162.2 (58.9%) 34.8 (12.6%)\n2030 351.1 million 92.6 (26.4%) 188.2 (53.6%) 70.3 (20.0%)\nTABLEA4U.S. Age Distribution, 1970, 2000, and 2030 (projected)\nAccess for free at openstax.org A \u2022 The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics 851\nFIGUREA6Pie Graphs of the U.S. Age Distribution (numbers in millions)The three pie graphs illustrate the division\nof total population into three age groups for the three different years.\nIn a pie graph, each slice of the pie represents a share of the total, or a percentage. For example, 50% would be\nhalf of the pie and 20% would be one-fifth of the pie. The three pie graphs inFigure A6show that the share of\nthe U.S. population 65 and over is growing. The pie graphs allow you to get a feel for the relative size of the\ndifferent age groups from 1970 to 2000 to 2030, without requiring you to slog through the specific numbers\nand percentages in the table. Some common examples of how pie graphs are used include dividing the\npopulation into groups by age, income level, ethnicity, religion, occupation; dividing different firms into\ncategories by size, industry, number of employees; and dividing up government spending or taxes into its main\ncategories.\nBar Graphs\nAbar graphuses the height of different bars to compare quantities.Table A5lists the 12 most populous\ncountries in the world.Figure A7provides this same data in a bar graph. The height of the bars corresponds to\nthe population of each country. Although you may know that China and India are the most populous countries\nin the world, seeing how the bars on the graph tower over the other countries helps illustrate the magnitude of\nthe difference between the sizes of national populations. 852 A \u2022 The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics\nFIGUREA7Leading Countries of the World by Population, 2015 (in millions)The graph shows the 12 countries of\nthe world with the largest populations.

InFigure A8(c), still based on the same data, the vertical axis measures\npercentages rather than the number of persons. In this case, all three bar graphs are the same height,\nrepresenting 100% of the population, with each bar divided according to the percentage of population in each\nage group. It is sometimes easier for a reader to run their eyes across several bar graphs, comparing the\nAccess for free at openstax.org A \u2022 The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics 853\nshaded areas, rather than trying to compare several pie graphs.\nFIGUREA8U.S. Population with Bar GraphsPopulation data can be represented in different ways. (a) Shows three\nbars for each year, representing the total number of persons in each age bracket for each year. (b) Shows just one\nbar for each year, but the different age groups are now shaded inside the bar. (c) Sets the vertical axis as a measure\nof percentages rather than the number of persons. All three bar graphs are the same height and each bar is divided\naccording to the percentage of population in each age group.\nFigure A7andFigure A8show how the bars can represent countries or years, and how the vertical axis can\nrepresent a numerical or a percentage value. Bar graphs can also compare size, quantity, rates, distances, and\nother quantitative categories.\nComparing Line Graphs with Pie Charts and Bar Graphs\nNow that you are familiar with pie graphs, bar graphs, and line graphs, how do you know which graph to use for\nyour data? Pie graphs are often better than line graphs at showing how an overall group is divided. However, if\na pie graph has too many slices, it can become difficult to interpret.\nBar graphs are especially useful when comparing quantities. For example, if you are studying the populations\nof different countries, as inFigure A7, bar graphs can show the relationships between the population sizes of\nmultiple countries. Not only can it show these relationships, but it can also show breakdowns of different\ngroups within the population. 854 A \u2022 The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics\nA line graph is often the most effective format for illustrating a relationship between two variables that are both\nchanging. For example, time series graphs can show patterns as time changes, like the unemployment rate\nover time. Line graphs are widely used in economics to present continuous data about prices, wages, quantities\nbought and sold, the size of the economy.\nHow Graphs Can Be Misleading\nGraphs not only reveal patterns; they can also alter how patterns are perceived. To see some of the ways this\ncan be done, consider the line graphs ofFigure A9,Figure A10, andFigure A11. These graphs all illustrate the\nunemployment rate\u2014but from different perspectives.\nFIGUREA9\nAccess for free at openstax.org A \u2022 The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics 855\nFIGUREA10Presenting Unemployment Rates in Different Ways, All of Them AccurateSimply changing the width\nand height of the area in which data is displayed can alter the perception of the data. 856 A \u2022 The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics\nFIGUREA11Presenting Unemployment Rates in Different Ways, All of Them AccurateSimply changing the width\nand height of the area in which data is displayed can alter the perception of the data.\nSuppose you wanted a graph which gives the impression that the rise in unemployment in 2009 was not all\nthat large, or all that extraordinary by historical standards. You might choose to present your data as inFigure\nA9(a).Figure A9(a) includes much of the same data presented earlier inFigure A5, but stretches the\nhorizontal axis out longer relative to the vertical axis. By spreading the graph wide and flat, the visual\nappearance is that the rise in unemployment is not so large, and is similar to some past rises in\nunemployment. Now imagine you wanted to emphasize how unemployment spiked substantially higher in\n2009. In this case, using the same data, you can stretch the vertical axis out relative to the horizontal axis, as in\nFigure A9(b), which makes all rises and falls in unemployment appear larger.\nA similar effect can be accomplished without changing the length of the axes, but by changing the scale on the\nvertical axis. InFigure A10(c), the scale on the vertical axis runs from 0% to 30%, while inFigure A10(d), the\nvertical axis runs from 3% to 10%. Compared toFigure A5, where the vertical scale runs from 0% to 12%,\nFigure A10(c) makes the fluctuation in unemployment look smaller, whileFigure A10(d) makes it look larger.\nAnother way to alter the perception of the graph is to reduce the amount of variation by changing the number\nof points plotted on the graph.Figure A10(e) shows the unemployment rate according to five-year averages. By\naveraging out some of the year-to-year changes, the line appears smoother and with fewer highs and lows. In\nreality, the unemployment rate is reported monthly, andFigure A11(f) shows the monthly figures since 1960,\nwhich fluctuate more than the five-year average.Figure A11(f) is also a vivid illustration of how graphs can\nAccess for free at openstax.org A \u2022 The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics 857\ncompress lots of data. The graph includes monthly data since 1960, which over almost 50 years, works out to\nnearly 600 data points. Reading that list of 600 data points in numerical form would be hypnotic. You can,\nhowever, get a good intuitive sense of these 600 data points very quickly from the graph.\nA final trick in manipulating the perception of graphical information is that, by choosing the starting and\nending points carefully, you can influence the perception of whether the variable is rising or falling. The\noriginal data show a general pattern with unemployment low in the 1960s, but spiking up in the mid-1970s,\nearly 1980s, early 1990s, early 2000s, and late 2000s.Figure A11(g), however, shows a graph that goes back\nonly to 1975, which gives an impression that unemployment was more-or-less gradually falling over time until\nthe 2009 recession pushed it back up to its \u201coriginal\u201d level\u2014which is a plausible interpretation if one starts at\nthe high point around 1975.\nThese kinds of tricks\u2014or shall we just call them \u201cpresentation choices\u201d\u2014 are not limited to line graphs. In a pie\nchart with many small slices and one large slice, someone must decide what categories should be used to\nproduce these slices in the first place, thus making some slices appear bigger than others. If you are making a\nbar graph, you can make the vertical axis either taller or shorter, which will tend to make variations in the\nheight of the bars appear more or less.\nBeing able to read graphs is an essential skill, both in economics and in life. A graph is just one perspective or\npoint of view, shaped by choices such as those discussed in this section. Do not always believe the first quick\nimpression from a graph. View with caution.\nKey Concepts and Summary\nMath is a tool for understanding economics and economic relationships can be expressed mathematically\nusing algebra or graphs. The algebraic equation for a line is y = b + mx, where x is the variable on the\nhorizontal axis and y is the variable on the vertical axis, the b term is the y-intercept and the m term is the\nslope. The slope of a line is the same at any point on the line and it indicates the relationship (positive,\nnegative, or zero) between two economic variables.\nEconomic models can be solved algebraically or graphically. Graphs allow you to illustrate data visually. They\ncan illustrate patterns, comparisons, trends, and apportionment by condensing the numerical data and\nproviding an intuitive sense of relationships in the data. A line graph shows the relationship between two\nvariables: one is shown on the horizontal axis and one on the vertical axis. A pie graph shows how something is\nallotted, such as a sum of money or a group of people. The size of each slice of the pie is drawn to represent the\ncorresponding percentage of the whole. A bar graph uses the height of bars to show a relationship, where each\nbar represents a certain entity, like a country or a group of people. The bars on a bar graph can also be divided\ninto segments to show subgroups.\nAny graph is a single visual perspective on a subject. The impression it leaves will be based on many choices,\nsuch as what data or time frame is included, how data or groups are divided up, the relative size of vertical and\nhorizontal axes, whether the scale used on a vertical starts at zero. Thus, any graph should be regarded\nsomewhat skeptically, remembering that the underlying relationship can be open to different interpretations.\nReview Questions\nExerciseA1\nName three kinds of graphs and briefly state when is most appropriate to use each type of graph.\nExerciseA2\nWhat is slope on a line graph?\nExerciseA3\nWhat do the slices of a pie chart represent?\nExerciseA4 858 A \u2022 The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics\nWhy is a bar chart the best way to illustrate comparisons?\nExerciseA5\nHow does the appearance of positive slope differ from negative slope and from zero slope?\nAccess for free at openstax.org B \u2022 Indifference Curves 859\nAPPENDIX B\nIndifference Curves\nEconomists use a vocabulary of maximizing utility to describe people\u2019s preferences. InConsumer Choices, the\nlevel ofutilitythat a person receives is described in numerical terms. This appendix presents an alternative\napproach to describing personal preferences, called indifference curves, which avoids any need for using\nnumbers to measure utility. By setting aside the assumption of putting a numerical valuation on utility\u2014an\nassumption that many students and economists find uncomfortably unrealistic\u2014theindifference curve\nframework helps to clarify the logic of the underlying model.\nWhat Is an Indifference Curve?\nPeople cannot really put a numerical value on their level of satisfaction. However, they can, and do, identify\nwhat choices would give them more, or less, or the same amount of satisfaction. An indifference curve shows\ncombinations of goods that provide an equal level of utility or satisfaction. For example,Figure B1presents\nthree indifference curves that represent Lilly\u2019s preferences for the tradeoffs that she faces in her two main\nrelaxation activities: eating doughnuts and reading paperback books. Each indifference curve (Ul, Um, and Uh)\nrepresents one level of utility. First we will explore the meaning of one particular indifference curve and then\nwe will look at the indifference curves as a group.\nFIGUREB1Lilly\u2019s Indifference CurvesLilly would receive equal utility from all points on a given indifference curve.\nAny points on the highest indifference curve Uh, like F, provide greater utility than any points like A, B, C, and D on\nthe middle indifference curve Um. Similarly, any points on the middle indifference curve Um provide greater utility\nthan any points on the lowest indifference curve Ul.\nThe Shape of an Indifference Curve 860 B \u2022 Indifference Curves\nThe indifference curve Um has four points labeled on it: A, B, C, and D. Since an indifference curve represents\na set of choices that have the same level of utility, Lilly must receive an equal amount of utility, judged\naccording to her personal preferences, from two books and 120 doughnuts (point A), from three books and 84\ndoughnuts (point B) from 11 books and 40 doughnuts (point C) or from 12 books and 35 doughnuts (point D).\nShe would also receive the same utility from any of the unlabeled intermediate points along this indifference\ncurve.\nIndifference curves have a roughly similar shape in two ways: 1) they are downward sloping from left to right;\n2) they are convex with respect to the origin. In other words, they are steeper on the left and flatter on the right.\nThe downward slope of the indifference curve means that Lilly must trade off less of one good to get more of\nthe other, while holding utility constant. For example, points A and B sit on the same indifference curve Um,\nwhich means that they provide Lilly with the same level of utility. Thus, themarginal utilitythat Lilly would\ngain from, say, increasing her consumption of books from two to three must be equal to the marginal utility\nthat she would lose if her consumption of doughnuts was cut from 120 to 84\u2014so that her overall utility remains\nunchanged between points A and B. Indeed, the slope along an indifference curve as themarginal rate of\nsubstitution, which is the rate at which a person is willing to trade one good for another so that utility will\nremain the same.\nIndifference curves like Um are steeper on the left and flatter on the right. The reason behind this shape\ninvolves diminishing marginal utility\u2014the notion that as a person consumes more of a good, the marginal\nutility from each additional unit becomes lower. Compare two different choices between points that all provide\nLilly an equal amount of utility along the indifference curve Um: the choice between A and B, and between C\nand D. In both choices, Lilly consumes one more book, but between A and B her consumption of doughnuts\nfalls by 36 (from 120 to 84) and between C and D it falls by only five (from 40 to 35). The reason for this\ndifference is that points A and C are different starting points, and thus have different implications for marginal\nutility. At point A, Lilly has few books and many doughnuts. Thus, her marginal utility from an extra book will\nbe relatively high while the marginal utility of additional doughnuts is relatively low\u2014so on the margin, it will\ntake a relatively large number of doughnuts to offset the utility from the marginal book. At point C, however,\nLilly has many books and few doughnuts. From this starting point, her marginal utility gained from extra\nbooks will be relatively low, while the marginal utility lost from additional doughnuts would be relatively\nhigh\u2014so on the margin, it will take a relatively smaller number of doughnuts to offset the change of one\nmarginal book. In short, the slope of the indifference curve changes because the marginal rate of\nsubstitution\u2014that is, the quantity of one good that would be traded for the other good to keep utility\nconstant\u2014also changes, as a result ofdiminishing marginal utilityof both goods.\nThe Field of Indifference Curves\nEach indifference curve represents the choices that provide a single level of utility. Every level of utility will\nhave its own indifference curve. Thus, Lilly\u2019s preferences will include an infinite number of indifference curves\nlying nestled together on the diagram\u2014even though only three of the indifference curves, representing three\nlevels of utility, appear onFigure B1. In other words, an infinite number of indifference curves are not drawn\non this diagram\u2014but you should remember that they exist.\nHigher indifference curves represent a greater level of utility than lower ones. InFigure B1, indifference curve\nUl can be thought of as a \u201clow\u201d level of utility, while Um is a \u201cmedium\u201d level of utility and Uh is a \u201chigh\u201d level of\nutility. All of the choices on indifference curve Uh are preferred to all of the choices on indifference curve Um,\nwhich in turn are preferred to all of the choices on Ul.\nTo understand why higher indifference curves are preferred to lower ones, compare point B on indifference\ncurve Um to point F on indifference curve Uh. Point F has greater consumption of both books (five to three)\nand doughnuts (100 to 84), so point F is clearly preferable to point B. Given the definition of an indifference\ncurve\u2014that all the points on the curve have the same level of utility\u2014if point F on indifference curve Uh is\npreferred to point B on indifference curve Um, then it must be true that all points on indifference curve Uh\nAccess for free at openstax.org B \u2022 Indifference Curves 861\nhave a higher level of utility than all points on Um. More generally, for any point on a lower indifference curve,\nlike Ul, you can identify a point on a higher indifference curve like Um or Uh that has a higher consumption of\nboth goods. Since one point on the higher indifference curve is preferred to one point on the lower curve, and\nsince all the points on a given indifference curve have the same level of utility, it must be true that all points on\nhigher indifference curves have greater utility than all points on lower indifference curves.\nThese arguments about the shapes of indifference curves and about higher or lower levels of utility do not\nrequire any numerical estimates of utility, either by the individual or by anyone else. They are only based on\nthe assumptions that when people have less of one good they need more of another good to make up for it, if\nthey are keeping the same level of utility, and that as people have more of a good, the marginal utility they\nreceive from additional units of that good will diminish. Given these gentle assumptions, a field of indifference\ncurves can be mapped out to describe the preferences of any individual.\nThe Individuality of Indifference Curves\nEach person determines their own preferences and utility. Thus, while indifference curves have the same\ngeneral shape\u2014they slope down, and the slope is steeper on the left and flatter on the right\u2014the specific shape\nof indifference curves can be different for every person.Figure B1, for example, applies only to Lilly\u2019s\npreferences. Indifference curves for other people would probably travel through different points.\nUtility-Maximizing with Indifference Curves\nPeople seek the highest level of utility, which means that they wish to be on the highest possible indifference\ncurve. However, people are limited by their budget constraints, which show what tradeoffs are actually\npossible.\nMaximizing Utility at the Highest Indifference Curve\nReturn to the situation of Lilly\u2019s choice between paperback books and doughnuts. Say that books cost $6,\ndoughnuts are 50 cents each, and that Lilly has $60 to spend. This information provides the basis for the\nbudget line shown inFigure B2. Along with thebudget lineare shown the three indifference curves from\nFigure B1. What is Lilly\u2019s utility-maximizing choice? Several possibilities are identified in the diagram.\nFIGUREB2Indifference Curves and a Budget ConstraintLilly\u2019s preferences are shown by the indifference curves.\nLilly\u2019s budget constraint, given the prices of books and doughnuts and her income, is shown by the straight line. 862 B \u2022 Indifference Curves\nLilly\u2019s optimal choice will be point B, where the budget line is tangent to the indifference curve Um. Lilly would have\nmore utility at a point like F on the higher indifference curve Uh, but the budget line does not touch the higher\nindifference curve Uh at any point, so she cannot afford this choice. A choice like G is affordable to Lilly, but it lies on\nindifference curve Ul and thus provides less utility than choice B, which is on indifference curve Um.\nThe choice of F with five books and 100 doughnuts is highly desirable, since it is on the highest indifference\ncurve Uh of those shown in the diagram. However, it is not affordable given Lilly\u2019s budget constraint. The\nchoice of H with three books and 70 doughnuts on indifference curve Ul is a wasteful choice, since it is inside\nLilly\u2019s budget set, and as a utility-maximizer, Lilly will always prefer a choice on the budget constraint itself.\nChoices B and G are both on the opportunity set. However, choice G of six books and 48 doughnuts is on lower\nindifference curve Ul than choice B of three books and 84 doughnuts, which is on the indifference curve Um. If\nLilly were to start at choice G, and then thought about whether the marginal utility she was deriving from\ndoughnuts and books, she would decide that some additional doughnuts and fewer books would make her\nhappier\u2014which would cause her to move toward her preferred choice B. Given the combination of Lilly\u2019s\npersonal preferences, as identified by her indifference curves, and Lilly\u2019s opportunity set, which is determined\nby prices and income, B will be her utility-maximizing choice.\nThe highest achievable indifference curve touches the opportunity set at a single point of tangency. Since an\ninfinite number of indifference curves exist, even if only a few of them are drawn on any given diagram, there\nwill always exist one indifference curve that touches the budget line at a single point of tangency. All higher\nindifference curves, like Uh, will be completely above the budget line and, although the choices on that\nindifference curve would provide higher utility, they are not affordable given the budget set. All lower\nindifference curves, like Ul, will cross the budget line in two separate places. When one indifference curve\ncrosses the budget line in two places, however, there will be another, higher, attainable indifference curve\nsitting above it that touches the budget line at only one point of tangency.\nChanges in Income\nA rise in income causes the budget constraint to shift to the right. In graphical terms, the newbudget\nconstraintwill now be tangent to a higher indifference curve, representing a higher level of utility. A reduction\nin income will cause the budget constraint to shift to the left, which will cause it to be tangent to a lower\nindifference curve, representing a reduced level of utility. If income rises by, for example, 50%, exactly how\nmuch will a person alter consumption of books and doughnuts? Will consumption of both goods rise by 50%,\nor will the quantity of one good rise substantially, while the quantity of the other good rises only a little, or even\ndeclines?\nSince personal preferences and the shape of indifference curves are different for each individual, the response\nto changes in income will be different, too. For example, consider the preferences of Manuel and Natasha in\nFigure B3(a) andFigure B3(b). They each start with an identical income of $40, which they spend on yogurts\nthat cost $1 and rental movies that cost $4. Thus, they face identical budget constraints. However, based on\nManuel\u2019s preferences, as revealed by his indifference curves, his utility-maximizing choice on the original\nbudget set occurs where his opportunity set is tangent to the highest possible indifference curve at W, with\nthree movies and 28 yogurts, while Natasha\u2019s utility-maximizing choice on the original budget set at Y will be\nseven movies and 12 yogurts.\nAccess for free at openstax.org B \u2022 Indifference Curves 863\nFIGUREB3Manuel and Natasha\u2019s Indifference CurvesManuel and Natasha originally face the same budget\nconstraints; that is, same prices and same income. However, the indifference curves that illustrate their preferences\nare not the same. (a) Manuel\u2019s original choice at W involves more yogurt and more movies, and he reacts to the\nhigher income by mainly increasing consumption of movies at X. (b) Conversely, Natasha\u2019s original choice (Y)\ninvolves relatively more movies, but she reacts to the higher income by choosing relatively more yogurts. Even when\nbudget constraints are the same, personal preferences lead to different original choices and to different reactions in\nresponse to a change in income.\nNow, say that income rises to $60 for both Manuel and Natasha, so their budget constraints shift to the right. As\nshown inFigure B3(a), Manuel\u2019s new utility maximizing choice at X will be seven movies and 32 yogurts\u2014that\nis, Manuel will choose to spend most of the extra income on movies. Natasha\u2019s new utility maximizing choice at\nZ will be eight movies and 28 yogurts\u2014that is, she will choose to spend most of the extra income on yogurt. In\nthis way, the indifference curve approach allows for a range of possible responses. However, if both goods are\nnormal goods, then the typical response to a higher level of income will be to purchase more of them\u2014although\nexactly how much more is a matter of personal preference. If one of the goods is an inferior good, the response\nto a higher level of income will be to purchase less of it.\nResponses to Price Changes: Substitution and Income Effects\nA higher price for a good will cause the budget constraint to shift to the left, so that it is tangent to a lower\nindifference curve representing a reduced level of utility. Conversely, a lower price for a good will cause the\nopportunity set to shift to the right, so that it is tangent to a higher indifference curve representing an\nincreased level of utility. Exactly how much a change in price will lead to the quantity demanded of each good\nwill depend on personal preferences.\nAnyone who faces a change in price will experience two interlinked motivations: a substitution effect and an\nincome effect. Thesubstitution effectis that when a good becomes more expensive, people seek out\nsubstitutes. If oranges become more expensive, fruit-lovers scale back on oranges and eat more apples,\ngrapefruit, or raisins. Conversely, when a good becomes cheaper, people substitute toward consuming more. If\noranges get cheaper, people fire up their juicing machines and ease off on other fruits and foods. Theincome\neffectrefers to how a change in the price of a good alters the effective buying power of one\u2019s income. If the price\nof a good that you have been buying falls, then in effect your buying power has risen\u2014you are able to purchase\nmore goods. Conversely, if the price of a good that you have been buying rises, then the buying power of a given 864 B \u2022 Indifference Curves\namount of income is diminished. (One common source of confusion is that the \u201cincome effect\u201d does not refer\nto a change in actual income. Instead, it refers to the situation in which the price of a good changes, and thus\nthe quantities of goods that can be purchased with a fixed amount of income change. It might be more accurate\nto call the \u201cincome effect\u201d a \u201cbuying power effect,\u201d but the \u201cincome effect\u201d terminology has been used for\ndecades, and it is not going to change during this economics course.) Whenever a price changes, consumers\nfeel the pull of both substitution and income effects at the same time.\nUsing indifference curves, you can illustrate the substitution and income effects on a graph. InFigure B4,\nOgden faces a choice between two goods: haircuts or personal pizzas. Haircuts cost $20, personal pizzas cost\n$6, and he has $120 to spend.\nFIGUREB4Substitution and Income EffectsThe original choice is A, the point of tangency between the original\nbudget constraint and indifference curve. The new choice is B, the point of tangency between the new budget\nconstraint and the lower indifference curve. Point C is the tangency between the dashed line, where the slope shows\nthe new higher price of haircuts, and the original indifference curve. The substitution effect is the shift from A to C,\nwhich means getting fewer haircuts and more pizza. The income effect is the shift from C to B; that is, the reduction\nin buying power that causes a shift from the higher indifference curve to the lower indifference curve, with relative\nprices remaining unchanged. The income effect results in less consumed of both goods. Both substitution and\nincome effects cause fewer haircuts to be consumed. For pizza, in this case, the substitution effect and income\neffect cancel out, leading to the same amount of pizza consumed.\nThe price of haircuts rises to $30. Ogden starts at choice A on the higheropportunity setand the higher\nindifference curve. After the price of haircuts increases, he chooses B on the lower opportunity set and the\nlower indifference curve. Point B with two haircuts and 10 personal pizzas is immediately below point A with\nthree haircuts and 10 personal pizzas, showing that Ogden reacted to a higher price of haircuts by cutting back\nonly on haircuts, while leaving his consumption of pizza unchanged.\nThe dashed line in the diagram, and point C, are used to separate the substitution effect and the income effect.\nTo understand their function, start by thinking about the substitution effect with this question: How would\nOgden change his consumption if the relative prices of the two goods changed, but this change in relative\nprices did not affect his utility? The slope of the budget constraint is determined by the relative price of the two\ngoods; thus, the slope of the original budget line is determined by the original relative prices, while the slope of\nthe new budget line is determined by the new relative prices. With this thought in mind, the dashed line is a\ngraphical tool inserted in a specific way: It is inserted so that it is parallel with the new budget constraint, so it\nreflects the new relative prices, but it is tangent to the original indifference curve, so it reflects the original\nlevel of utility or buying power.\nThus, the movement from the original choice (A) to point C is a substitution effect; it shows the choice that\nAccess for free at openstax.org B \u2022 Indifference Curves 865\nOgden would make if relative prices shifted (as shown by the different slope between the original budget set\nand the dashed line) but if buying power did not shift (as shown by being tangent to the original indifference\ncurve). The substitution effect will encourage people to shift away from the good which has become relatively\nmore expensive\u2014in Ogden\u2019s case, the haircuts on the vertical axis\u2014and toward the good which has become\nrelatively less expensive\u2014in this case, the pizza on the vertical axis. The two arrows labeled with \u201cs\u201d for\n\u201csubstitution effect,\u201d one on each axis, show the direction of this movement.\nThe income effect is the movement from point C to B, which shows how Ogden reacts to a reduction in his\nbuying power from the higher indifference curve to the lower indifference curve, but holding constant the\nrelative prices (because the dashed line has the same slope as the new budget constraint). In this case, where\nthe price of one good increases, buying power is reduced, so the income effect means that consumption of both\ngoods should fall (if they are both normal goods, which it is reasonable to assume unless there is reason to\nbelieve otherwise). The two arrows labeled with \u201ci\u201d for \u201cincome effect,\u201d one on each axis, show the direction of\nthis income effect movement.\nNow, put the substitution and income effects together. When the price of pizza increased, Ogden consumed\nless of it, for two reasons shown in the exhibit: the substitution effect of the higher price led him to consume\nless and the income effect of the higher price also led him to consume less. However, when the price of pizza\nincreased, Ogden consumed the same quantity of haircuts. The substitution effect of a higher price for pizza\nmeant that haircuts became relatively less expensive (compared to pizza), and this factor, taken alone, would\nhave encouraged Ogden to consume more haircuts. However, the income effect of a higher price for pizza\nmeant that he wished to consume less of both goods, and this factor, taken alone, would have encouraged\nOgden to consume fewer haircuts. As shown inFigure B4, in this particular example the substitution effect and\nincome effect on Ogden\u2019s consumption of haircuts are offsetting\u2014so he ends up consuming the same quantity\nof haircuts after the price increase for pizza as before.\nThe size of these income and substitution effects will differ from person to person, depending on individual\npreferences. For example, if Ogden\u2019s substitution effect away from pizza and toward haircuts is especially\nstrong, and outweighs the income effect, then a higher price for pizza might lead to increased consumption of\nhaircuts. This case would be drawn on the graph so that the point of tangency between the new budget\nconstraint and the relevant indifference curve occurred below point B and to the right. Conversely, if the\nsubstitution effect away from pizza and toward haircuts is not as strong, and the income effect on is relatively\nstronger, then Ogden will be more likely to react to the higher price of pizza by consuming less of both goods.\nIn this case, his optimal choice after the price change will be above and to the left of choice B on the new\nbudget constraint.\nAlthough the substitution and income effects are often discussed as a sequence of events, it should be\nremembered that they are twin components of a single cause\u2014a change in price. Although you can analyze\nthem separately, the two effects are always proceeding hand in hand, happening at the same time.\nIndifference Curves with Labor-Leisure and Intertemporal Choices\nThe concept of an indifference curve applies to tradeoffs in any household choice, including the labor-leisure\nchoice or the intertemporal choice between present and future consumption. In the labor-leisure choice, each\nindifference curve shows the combinations of leisure and income that provide a certain level of utility. In an\nintertemporal choice, each indifference curve shows the combinations of present and future consumption that\nprovide a certain level of utility. The general shapes of the indifference curves\u2014downward sloping, steeper on\nthe left and flatter on the right\u2014also remain the same.\nA Labor-Leisure Example\nPetunia is working at a job that pays $12 per hour but she gets a raise to $20 per hour. After family\nresponsibilities and sleep, she has 80 hours per week available for work or leisure. As shown inFigure B5, the\nhighest level of utility for Petunia, on her original budget constraint, is at choice A, where it is tangent to the 866 B \u2022 Indifference Curves\nlower indifference curve (Ul). Point A has 30 hours of leisure and thus 50 hours per week of work, with income\nof $600 per week (that is, 50 hours of work at $12 per hour). Petunia then gets a raise to $20 per hour, which\nshifts her budget constraint to the right. Her new utility-maximizing choice occurs where the new budget\nconstraint is tangent to the higher indifference curve Uh. At B, Petunia has 40 hours of leisure per week and\nworks 40 hours, with income of $800 per week (that is, 40 hours of work at $20 per hour).\nFIGUREB5Effects of a Change in Petunia\u2019s WagePetunia starts at choice A, the tangency between her original\nbudget constraint and the lower indifference curve Ul. The wage increase shifts her budget constraint to the right, so\nthat she can now choose B on indifference curve Uh. The substitution effect is the movement from A to C. In this\ncase, the substitution effect would lead Petunia to choose less leisure, which is relatively more expensive, and more\nincome, which is relatively cheaper to earn. The income effect is the movement from C to B. The income effect in\nthis example leads to greater consumption of both goods. Overall, in this example, income rises because of both\nsubstitution and income effects. However, leisure declines because of the substitution effect but increases because\nof the income effect\u2014leading, in Petunia\u2019s case, to an overall increase in the quantity of leisure consumed.\nSubstitution and income effects provide a vocabulary for discussing how Petunia reacts to a higher hourly\nwage. The dashed line serves as the tool for separating the two effects on the graph.\nThe substitution effect tells how Petunia would have changed her hours of work if her wage had risen, so that\nincome was relatively cheaper to earn and leisure was relatively more expensive, but if she had remained at\nthe same level of utility. The slope of the budget constraint in alabor-leisure diagramis determined by the\nwage rate. Thus, the dashed line is carefully inserted with the slope of the new opportunity set, reflecting the\nlabor-leisure tradeoff of the new wage rate, but tangent to the original indifference curve, showing the same\nlevel of utility or \u201cbuying power.\u201d The shift from original choice A to point C, which is the point of tangency\nbetween the original indifference curve and the dashed line, shows that because of the higher wage, Petunia\nwill want to consume less leisure and more income. The \u201cs\u201d arrows on the horizontal and vertical axes of\nFigure B5show the substitution effect on leisure and on income.\nThe income effect is that the higher wage, by shifting the labor-leisure budget constraint to the right, makes it\npossible for Petunia to reach a higher level of utility. The income effect is the movement from point C to point\nB; that is, it shows how Petunia\u2019s behavior would change in response to a higher level of utility or \u201cbuying\npower,\u201d with the wage rate remaining the same (as shown by the dashed line being parallel to the new budget\nconstraint). The income effect, encouraging Petunia to consume both more leisure and more income, is drawn\nwith arrows on the horizontal and vertical axis ofFigure B5.\nPutting these effects together, Petunia responds to the higher wage by moving from choice A to choice B. This\nmovement involves choosing more income, both because the substitution effect of higher wages has made\nAccess for free at openstax.org B \u2022 Indifference Curves 867\nincome relatively cheaper or easier to earn, and because the income effect of higher wages has made it\npossible to have more income and more leisure. Her movement from A to B also involves choosing more\nleisure because, according to Petunia\u2019s preferences, the income effect that encourages choosing more leisure\nis stronger than the substitution effect that encourages choosing less leisure.\nFigure B5represents only Petunia\u2019s preferences. Other people might make other choices. For example, a\nperson whose substitution and income effects on leisure exactly counterbalanced each other might react to a\nhigher wage with a choice like D, exactly above the original choice A, which means taking all of the benefit of\nthe higher wages in the form of income while working the same number of hours. Yet another person, whose\nsubstitution effect on leisure outweighed the income effect, might react to a higher wage by making a choice\nlike F, where the response to higher wages is to work more hours and earn much more income. To represent\nthese different preferences, you could easily draw the indifference curve Uh to be tangent to the new budget\nconstraint at D or F, rather than at B.\nAn Intertemporal Choice Example\nQuentin has saved up $10,000. He is thinking about spending some or all of it on a vacation in the present, and\nthen will save the rest for another big vacation five years from now. Over those five years, he expects to earn a\ntotal 80% rate of return.Figure B6shows Quentin\u2019s budget constraint and his indifference curves between\npresent consumption and future consumption. The highest level of utility that Quentin can achieve at his\noriginal intertemporal budget constraint occurs at point A, where he is consuming $6,000, saving $4,000 for\nthe future, and expecting with the accumulated interest to have $7,200 for future consumption (that is, $4,000\nin current financial savings plus the 80% rate of return).\nHowever, Quentin has just realized that his expected rate of return was unrealistically high. A more realistic\nexpectation is that over five years he can earn a total return of 30%. In effect, his intertemporal budget\nconstraint has pivoted to the left, so that his original utility-maximizing choice is no longer available. Will\nQuentin react to the lower rate of return by saving more, or less, or the same amount? Again, the language of\nsubstitution and income effects provides a framework for thinking about the motivations behind various\nchoices. The dashed line, which is a graphical tool to separate the substitution and income effect, is carefully\ninserted with the same slope as the new opportunity set, so that it reflects the changed rate of return, but it is\ntangent to the original indifference curve, so that it shows no change in utility or \u201cbuying power.\u201d\nThe substitution effect tells how Quentin would have altered his consumption because the lower rate of return\nmakes future consumption relatively more expensive and present consumption relatively cheaper. The\nmovement from the original choice A to point C shows how Quentin substitutes toward more present\nconsumption and less future consumption in response to the lower interest rate, with no change in utility. The\nsubstitution arrows on the horizontal and vertical axes ofFigure B6show the direction of the substitution\neffect motivation. The substitution effect suggests that, because of the lower interest rate, Quentin should\nconsume more in the present and less in the future.\nQuentin also has an income effect motivation. The lower rate of return shifts the budget constraint to the left,\nwhich means that Quentin\u2019s utility or \u201cbuying power\u201d is reduced. The income effect (assuming normal goods)\nencourages less of both present and future consumption. The impact of the income effect on reducing present\nand future consumption in this example is shown with \u201ci\u201d arrows on the horizontal and vertical axis ofFigure\nB6. 868 B \u2022 Indifference Curves\nFIGUREB6Indifference Curve and an Intertemporal Budget ConstraintThe original choice is A, at the tangency\nbetween the original budget constraint and the original indifference curve Uh. The dashed line is drawn parallel to\nthe new budget set, so that its slope reflects the lower rate of return, but is tangent to the original indifference\ncurve. The movement from A to C is the substitution effect: in this case, future consumption has become relatively\nmore expensive, and present consumption has become relatively cheaper. The income effect is the shift from C to B;\nthat is, the reduction in utility or \u201cbuying power\u201d that causes a move to a lower indifference curve Ul, but with the\nrelative price the same. It means less present and less future consumption. In the move from A to B, the\nsubstitution effect on present consumption is greater than the income effect, so the overall result is more present\nconsumption. Notice that the lower indifference curve could have been drawn tangent to the lower budget\nconstraint point D or point F, depending on personal preferences.\nTaking both effects together, the substitution effect is encouraging Quentin toward more present and less\nfuture consumption, because present consumption is relatively cheaper, while the income effect is\nencouraging him to less present and less future consumption, because the lower interest rate is pushing him\nto a lower level of utility. For Quentin\u2019s personal preferences, the substitution effect is stronger so that, overall,\nhe reacts to the lower rate of return with more present consumption and less savings at choice B. However,\nother people might have different preferences. They might react to a lower rate of return by choosing the same\nlevel of present consumption and savings at choice D, or by choosing less present consumption and more\nsavings at a point like F. For these other sets of preferences, the income effect of a lower rate of return on\npresent consumption would be relatively stronger, while the substitution effect would be relatively weaker.\nSketching Substitution and Income Effects\nIndifference curves provide an analytical tool for looking at all the choices that provide a single level of utility.\nThey eliminate any need for placing numerical values on utility and help to illuminate the process of making\nutility-maximizing decisions. They also provide the basis for a more detailed investigation of the\ncomplementary motivations that arise in response to a change in a price, wage or rate of return\u2014namely, the\nsubstitution and income effects.\nIf you are finding it a little tricky to sketch diagrams that show substitution and income effects so that the\npoints of tangency all come out correctly, it may be useful to follow this procedure.\nStep 1. Begin with a budget constraint showing the choice between two goods, which this example will call\n\u201ccandy\u201d and \u201cmovies.\u201d Choose a point A which will be the optimal choice, where the indifference curve will be\ntangent\u2014but it is often easier not to draw in the indifference curve just yet. SeeFigure B7.\nAccess for free at openstax.org B \u2022 Indifference Curves 869\nFIGUREB7\nStep 2. Now the price of movies changes: let\u2019s say that it rises. That shifts the budget set inward. You know that\nthe higher price will push the decision-maker down to a lower level of utility, represented by a lower\nindifference curve. But at this stage, draw only the new budget set. SeeFigure B8.\nFIGUREB8\nStep 3. The key tool in distinguishing between substitution and income effects is to insert a dashed line,\nparallel to the new budget line. This line is a graphical tool that allows you to distinguish between the two\nchanges: (1) the effect on consumption of the two goods of the shift in prices\u2014with the level of utility remaining\nunchanged\u2014which is the substitution effect; and (2) the effect on consumption of the two goods of shifting\nfrom one indifference curve to the other\u2014with relative prices staying unchanged\u2014which is the income effect.\nThe dashed line is inserted in this step. The trick is to have the dashed line travel close to the original choice A,\nbut not directly through point A. SeeFigure B9. 870 B \u2022 Indifference Curves\nFIGUREB9\nStep 4. Now, draw the original indifference curve, so that it is tangent to both point A on the original budget\nline and to a point C on the dashed line. Many students find it easiest to first select the tangency point C where\nthe original indifference curve touches the dashed line, and then to draw the original indifference curve\nthrough A and C. The substitution effect is illustrated by the movement along the original indifference curve as\nprices change but the level of utility holds constant, from A to C. As expected, the substitution effect leads to\nless consumed of the good that is relatively more expensive, as shown by the \u201cs\u201d (substitution) arrow on the\nvertical axis, and more consumed of the good that is relatively less expensive, as shown by the \u201cs\u201d arrow on the\nhorizontal axis. SeeFigure B10.\nFIGUREB10\nStep 5. With the substitution effect in place, now choose utility-maximizing point B on the new opportunity set.\nWhen you choose point B, think about whether you wish the substitution or the income effect to have a larger\nimpact on the good (in this case, candy) on the horizontal axis. If you choose point B to be directly in a vertical\nline with point A (as is illustrated here), then the income effect will be exactly offsetting the substitution effect\non the horizontal axis. If you insert point B so that it lies a little to right of the original point A, then the\nAccess for free at openstax.org B \u2022 Indifference Curves 871\nsubstitution effect will exceed the income effect. If you insert point B so that it lies a little to the left of point A,\nthen the income effect will exceed the substitution effect. The income effect is the movement from C to B,\nshowing how choices shifted as a result of the decline in buying power and the movement between two levels\nof utility, with relative prices remaining the same. With normal goods, the negative income effect means less\nconsumed of each good, as shown by the direction of the \u201ci\u201d (income effect) arrows on the vertical and\nhorizontal axes. SeeFigure B11.\nFIGUREB11\nIn sketching substitution and income effect diagrams, you may wish to practice some of the following\nvariations: (1) Price falls instead of a rising; (2) The price change affects the good on either the vertical or the\nhorizontal axis; (3) Sketch these diagrams so that the substitution effect exceeds the income effect; the income\neffect exceeds the substitution effect; and the two effects are equal.\nOne final note: The helpful dashed line can be drawn tangent to the new indifference curve, and parallel to the\noriginal budget line, rather than tangent to the original indifference curve and parallel to the new budget line.\nSome students find this approach more intuitively clear. The answers you get about the direction and relative\nsizes of the substitution and income effects, however, should be the same.\nKey Concepts and Summary\nAn indifference curve is drawn on a budget constraint diagram that shows the tradeoffs between two goods. All\npoints along a single indifference curve provide the same level of utility. Higher indifference curves represent\nhigher levels of utility. Indifference curves slope downward because, if utility is to remain the same at all points\nalong the curve, a reduction in the quantity of the good on the vertical axis must be counterbalanced by an\nincrease in the quantity of the good on the horizontal axis (or vice versa). Indifference curves are steeper on\nthe far left and flatter on the far right, because of diminishing marginal utility.\nThe utility-maximizing choice along a budget constraint will be the point of tangency where the budget\nconstraint touches an indifference curve at a single point. A change in the price of any good has two effects: a\nsubstitution effect and an income effect. The substitution effect motivation encourages a utility-maximizer to\nbuy less of what is relatively more expensive and more of what is relatively cheaper. The income effect\nmotivation encourages a utility-maximizer to buy more of both goods if utility rises or less of both goods if\nutility falls (if they are both normal goods).\nIn a labor-leisure choice, every wage change has a substitution and an income effect. The substitution effect of\na wage increase is to choose more income, since it is cheaper to earn, and less leisure, since its opportunity 872 B \u2022 Indifference Curves\ncost has increased. The income effect of a wage increase is to choose more of leisure and income, since they\nare both normal goods. The substitution and income effects of a wage decrease would reverse these directions.\nIn an intertemporal consumption choice, every interest rate change has a substitution and an income effect.\nThe substitution effect of an interest rate increase is to choose more future consumption, since it is now\ncheaper to earn future consumption and less present consumption (more savings), since the opportunity cost\nof present consumption in terms of what is being given up in the future has increased. The income effect of an\ninterest rate increase is to choose more of both present and future consumption, since they are both normal\ngoods. The substitution and income effects of an interest rate decrease would reverse these directions.\nReview Questions\nExerciseB1\nWhat point is preferred along an indifference curve?\nExerciseB2\nWhy do indifference curves slope down?\nExerciseB3\nWhy are indifference curves steep on the left and flatter on the right?\nExerciseB4\nHow many indifference curves does a person have?\nExerciseB5\nHow can you tell which indifference curves represent higher or lower levels of utility?\nExerciseB6\nWhat is a substitution effect?\nExerciseB7\nWhat is an income effect?\nExerciseB8\nDoes the \u201cincome effect\u201d involve a change in income?

The price of a bond\ndepends on the future payments that the bond is expected to make, including both payments of interest and\nthe repayment of the face value of the bond. The price of a stock depends on the expected future profits earned\nby the firm. The concept of apresent discounted value (PDV), which is defined as the amount you should be\nwilling to pay in the present for a stream of expected future payments, can be used to calculate appropriate\nprices for stocks and bonds. To place a present discounted value on a future payment, think about what\namount of money you would need to have in the present to equal a certain amount in the future. This\ncalculation will require aninterest rate. For example, if the interest rate is 10%, then a payment of $110 a year\nfrom now will have a present discounted value of $100\u2014that is, you could take $100 in the present and have\n$110 in the future. We will first shows how to apply the idea of present discounted value to a stock and then we\nwill show how to apply it to a bond.\nApplying Present Discounted Value to a Stock\nConsider the case of Babble, Inc., a company that offers speaking lessons. For the sake of simplicity, say that\nthe founder of Babble is 63 years old and plans to retire in two years, at which point the company will be\ndisbanded. The company is selling 200 shares of stock and profits are expected to be $15 million right away, in\nthe present, $20 million one year from now, and $25 million two years from now. All profits will be paid out as\ndividends to shareholders as they occur. Given this information, what will an investor pay for a share of stock\nin this company?\nA financial investor, thinking about what future payments are worth in the present, will need to choose an\ninterest rate. This interest rate will reflect the rate of return on other available financial investment\nopportunities, which is the opportunity cost of investing financial capital, and also a risk premium (that is,\nusing a higher interest rate than the rates available elsewhere if this investment appears especially risky). In\nthis example, say that the financial investor decides that appropriate interest rate to value these future\npayments is 15%.\nTable C1shows how to calculate the present discounted value of the future profits. For each time period, when\na benefit is going to be received, apply the formula:\nPayments from Firm Present Value\n$15 million in present $15 million\n$20 million in one year $20 million/(1 + 0.15)1= $17.4 million\n$25 million in two years $25 million/(1 + 0.15)2= $18.9 million\nTotal $51.3 million\nTABLEC1Calculating Present Discounted Value of a Stock\nNext, add up all the present values for the different time periods to get a final answer. The present value\ncalculations ask what the amount in the future is worth in the present, given the 15% interest rate. Notice that 874 C \u2022 Present Discounted Value\na different PDV calculation needs to be done separately for amounts received at different times. Then, divide\nthe PDV of total profits by the number of shares, 200 in this case: 51.3 million/200 = 0.2565 million. The price\nper share should be about $256,500 per share.\nOf course, in the real world expected profits are a best guess, not a hard piece of data. Deciding which interest\nrate to apply for discounting to the present can be tricky. One needs to take into account both potential capital\ngains from the future sale of the stock and also dividends that might be paid. Differences of opinion on these\nissues are exactly why some financial investors want to buy a stock that other people want to sell: they are\nmore optimistic about its future prospects. Conceptually, however, it all comes down to what you are willing to\npay in the present for a stream of benefits to be received in the future.\nApplying Present Discounted Value to a Bond\nA similar calculation works in the case of bonds.Financial Marketsexplains that if the interest rate falls after a\nbond is issued, so that the investor has locked in a higher rate, then that bond will sell for more than its face\nvalue. Conversely, if the interest rate rises after a bond is issued, then the investor is locked into a lower rate,\nand the bond will sell for less than its face value. The present value calculation sharpens this intuition.\nThink about a simple two-year bond. It was issued for $3,000 at an interest rate of 8%. Thus, after the first year,\nthe bond pays interest of 240 (which is 3,000 \u00d7 8%). At the end of the second year, the bond pays $240 in\ninterest, plus the $3,000 in principle. Calculate how much this bond is worth in the present if the discount rate\nis 8%. Then, recalculate if interest rates rise and the applicable discount rate is 11%. To carry out these\ncalculations, look at the stream of payments being received from the bond in the future and figure out what\nthey are worth in present discounted value terms. The calculations applying the present value formula are\nshown inTable C2.\nStream of Payments (for Present Value (for the Stream of Payments (for Present Value (for the\nthe 8% interest rate) 8% interest rate) the 11% interest rate) 11% interest rate)\n$240 payment after one $240/(1 + 0.08)1= $240/(1 + 0.11)1=\n$240 payment after one year\nyear $222.20 $216.20\n$3,240 payment after $3,240/(1 + 0.08)2= $3,240 payment after $3,240/(1 + 0.11)2=\nsecond year $2,777.80 second year $2,629.60\nTotal $3,000 Total $2,845.80\nTABLEC2Computing the Present Discounted Value of a Bond\nThe first calculation shows that the present value of a $3,000 bond, issued at 8%, is just $3,000. After all, that is\nhow much money the borrower is receiving. The calculation confirms that the present value is the same for the\nlender. The bond is moving money around in time, from those willing to save in the present to those who want\nto borrow in the present, but the present value of what is received by the borrower is identical to the present\nvalue of what will be repaid to the lender.\nThe second calculation shows what happens if the interest rate rises from 8% to 11%. The actual dollar\npayments in the first column, as determined by the 8% interest rate, do not change. However, the present value\nof those payments, now discounted at a higher interest rate, is lower. Even though the future dollar payments\nthat the bond is receiving have not changed, a person who tries to sell the bond will find that the investment\u2019s\nvalue has fallen.\nAgain, real-world calculations are often more complex, in part because, not only the interest rate prevailing in\nthe market, but also the riskiness of whether the borrower will repay the loan, will change. In any case, the\nprice of a bond is always the present value of a stream of future expected payments.\nAccess for free at openstax.org C \u2022 Present Discounted Value 875\nOther Applications\nPresent discounted value is a widely used analytical tool outside the world of finance. Every time a business\nthinks about making a physical capital investment, it must compare a set of present costs of making that\ninvestment to the present discounted value of future benefits. When government thinks about a proposal to,\nfor example, add safety features to a highway, it must compare costs incurred in the present to benefits\nreceived in the future. Some academic disputes over environmental policies, like how much to reduce carbon\ndioxide emissions because of the risk that they will lead to a warming of global temperatures several decades\nin the future, turn on how one compares present costs of pollution control with long-run future benefits.\nSomeone who wins the lottery and is scheduled to receive a string of payments over 30 years might be\ninterested in knowing what the present discounted value is of those payments. Whenever a string of costs and\nbenefits stretches from the present into different times in the future, present discounted value becomes an\nindispensable tool of analysis. 876 C \u2022 Present Discounted Value\nAccess for free at openstax.org D \u2022 The Expenditure-Output Model 877\nAPPENDIX D\nThe Expenditure-Output Model\n(This appendix should be consulted after first readingThe Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Modeland\nThe Keynesian Perspective.) The fundamental ideas of Keynesian economics were developed before the AD/AS\nmodel was popularized. From the 1930s until the 1970s, Keynesian economics was usually explained with a\ndifferent model, known as the expenditure-output approach. This approach is strongly rooted in the\nfundamental assumptions of Keynesian economics: it focuses on the total amount of spending in the economy,\nwith no explicit mention of aggregate supply or of the price level (although as you will see, it is possible to draw\nsome inferences about aggregate supply and price levels based on the diagram).\nThe Axes of the Expenditure-Output Diagram\nTheexpenditure-output model, sometimes also called theKeynesian cross diagram, determines the\nequilibrium level of real GDP by the point where the total or aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal\nto the amount of output produced. The axes of the Keynesian cross diagram presented inFigure D1show real\nGDP on the horizontal axis as a measure of output and aggregate expenditures on the vertical axis as a\nmeasure of spending.\nFIGURED1The Expenditure-Output DiagramThe aggregate expenditure-output model shows aggregate\nexpenditures on the vertical axis and real GDP on the horizontal axis. A vertical line shows potential GDP where full\nemployment occurs. The 45-degree line shows all points where aggregate expenditures and output are equal. The\naggregate expenditure schedule shows how total spending or aggregate expenditure increases as output or real\nGDP rises. The intersection of the aggregate expenditure schedule and the 45-degree line will be the equilibrium.\nEquilibrium occurs at E , where aggregate expenditure AE is equal to the output level Y .\n0 0 0\nRemember that GDP can be thought of in several equivalent ways: it measures both the value of spending on\nfinal goods and also the value of the production of final goods. All sales of the final goods and services that\nmake up GDP will eventually end up as income for workers, for managers, and for investors and owners of\nfirms. The sum of all the income received for contributing resources to GDP is callednational income(Y). At\nsome points in the discussion that follows, it will be useful to refer to real GDP as \u201cnational income.\u201d Both axes\nare measured in real (inflation-adjusted) terms. 878 D \u2022 The Expenditure-Output Model\nThe Potential GDP Line and the 45-degree Line\nThe Keynesian cross diagram contains two lines that serve as conceptual guideposts to orient the discussion.\nThe first is a vertical line showing the level ofpotential GDP. Potential GDP means the same thing here that it\nmeans in the AD/AS diagrams: it refers to the quantity of output that the economy can produce with full\nemployment of its labor and physical capital.\nThe second conceptual line on the Keynesian cross diagram is the 45-degree line, which starts at the origin\nand reaches up and to the right. A line that stretches up at a 45-degree angle represents the set of points (1, 1),\n(2, 2), (3, 3) and so on, where the measurement on the vertical axis is equal to the measurement on the\nhorizontal axis. In this diagram, the 45-degree line shows the set of points where the level of aggregate\nexpenditure in the economy, measured on the vertical axis, is equal to the level of output or national income in\nthe economy, measured by GDP on the horizontal axis.\nWhen the macroeconomy is in equilibrium, it must be true that the aggregate expenditures in the economy are\nequal to thereal GDP\u2014because by definition, GDP is the measure of what is spent on final sales of goods and\nservices in the economy. Thus, the equilibrium calculated with a Keynesian cross diagram will always end up\nwhere aggregate expenditure and output are equal\u2014which will only occur along the 45-degree line.\nThe Aggregate Expenditure Schedule\nThe final ingredient of the Keynesian cross or expenditure-output diagram is theaggregate expenditure\nschedule, which will show the total expenditures in the economy for each level of real GDP. The intersection of\nthe aggregate expenditure line with the 45-degree line\u2014at point E inFigure D1\u2014will show the equilibrium for\n0\nthe economy, because it is the point where aggregate expenditure is equal to output or real GDP. After\ndeveloping an understanding of what the aggregate expenditures schedule means, we will return to this\nequilibrium and how to interpret it.\nBuilding the Aggregate Expenditure Schedule\nAggregate expenditure is the key to the expenditure-income model. The aggregate expenditure schedule\nshows, either in the form of a table or a graph, how aggregate expenditures in the economy rise as real GDP or\nnational income rises. Thus, in thinking about the components of the aggregate expenditure\nline\u2014consumption, investment, government spending, exports and imports\u2014the key question is how\nexpenditures in each category will adjust as national income rises.\nConsumption as a Function of National Income\nHow do consumption expenditures increase as national income rises? People can do two things with their\nincome: consume it or save it (for the moment, let\u2019s ignore the need to pay taxes with some of it). Each person\nwho receives an additional dollar faces this choice. Themarginal propensity to consume (MPC), is the share of\nthe additional dollar of income a person decides to devote to consumption expenditures. Themarginal\npropensity to save (MPS)is the share of the additional dollar a person decides to save. It must always hold true\nthat:\nFor example, if the marginal propensity to consume out of the marginal amount of income earned is 0.9, then\nthe marginal propensity to save is 0.1.\nWith this relationship in mind, consider the relationship among income, consumption, and savings shown in\nFigure D2. (Note that we use \u201cAggregate Expenditure\u201d on the vertical axis in this and the following figures,\nbecause all consumption expenditures are parts of aggregate expenditures.)\nAn assumption commonly made in this model is that even if income were zero, people would have to consume\nsomething. In this example, consumption would be $600 even if income were zero. Then, the MPC is 0.8 and\nthe MPS is 0.2. Thus, when income increases by $1,000, consumption rises by $800 and savings rises by $200.\nAccess for free at openstax.org D \u2022 The Expenditure-Output Model 879\nAt an income of $4,000, total consumption will be the $600 that would be consumed even without any income,\nplus $4,000 multiplied by the marginal propensity to consume of 0.8, or $ 3,200, for a total of $ 3,800. The total\namount of consumption and saving must always add up to the total amount of income. (Exactly how a situation\nof zero income and negative savings would work in practice is not important, because even low-income\nsocieties are not literally at zero income, so the point is hypothetical.) This relationship between income and\nconsumption, illustrated inFigure D2andTable D1, is called theconsumption function.\nFIGURED2The Consumption FunctionIn the expenditure-output model, how does consumption increase with the\nlevel of national income? Output on the horizontal axis is conceptually the same as national income, since the value\nof all final output that is produced and sold must be income to someone, somewhere in the economy. At a national\nincome level of zero, $600 is consumed. Then, each time income rises by $1,000, consumption rises by $800,\nbecause in this example, the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8.\nThe pattern of consumption shown inTable D1is plotted inFigure D2. To calculate consumption, multiply the\nincome level by 0.8, for the marginal propensity to consume, and add $600, for the amount that would be\nconsumed even if income was zero. Consumption plus savings must be equal to income.\nIncome Consumption Savings\n$0 $600 \u2013$600\n$1,000 $1,400 \u2013$400\n$2,000 $2,200 \u2013$200\n$3,000 $3,000 $0\n$4,000 $3,800 $200\n$5,000 $4,600 $400\n$6,000 $5,400 $600\n$7,000 $6,200 $800\nTABLED1The Consumption\nFunction 880 D \u2022 The Expenditure-Output Model\nIncome Consumption Savings\n$8,000 $7,000 $1,000\n$9,000 $7,800 $1,200\nTABLED1The Consumption\nFunction\nHowever, a number of factors other than income can also cause the entire consumption function to shift. These\nfactors were summarized in the earlier discussion of consumption, and listed inTable D1. When the\nconsumption function moves, it can shift in two ways: either the entire consumption function can move up or\ndown in a parallel manner, or the slope of the consumption function can shift so that it becomes steeper or\nflatter. For example, if a tax cut leads consumers to spend more, but does not affect their marginal propensity\nto consume, it would cause an upward shift to a new consumption function that is parallel to the original one.\nHowever, a change in household preferences for saving that reduced the marginal propensity to save would\ncause the slope of the consumption function to become steeper: that is, if the savings rate is lower, then every\nincrease in income leads to a larger rise in consumption.\nInvestment as a Function of National Income\nInvestment decisions are forward-looking, based on expected rates of return. Precisely because investment\ndecisions depend primarily on perceptions about future economic conditions, they donotdepend primarily on\nthe level of GDP in the current year. Thus, on a Keynesian cross diagram, the investment function can be drawn\nas a horizontal line, at a fixed level of expenditure.Figure D3shows an investment function where the level of\ninvestment is, for the sake of concreteness, set at the specific level of 500. Just as a consumption function\nshows the relationship between consumption levels and real GDP (or national income), theinvestment\nfunctionshows the relationship between investment levels and real GDP.\nFIGURED3The Investment FunctionThe investment function is drawn as a flat line because investment is based\non interest rates and expectations about the future, and so it does not change with the level of current national\nincome. In this example, investment expenditures are at a level of 500. However, changes in factors like\ntechnological opportunities, expectations about near-term economic growth, and interest rates would all cause the\ninvestment function to shift up or down.\nThe appearance of the investment function as a horizontal line does not mean that the level of investment\nnever moves. It means only that in the context of this two-dimensional diagram, the level of investment on the\nvertical aggregate expenditure axis does not vary according to the current level of real GDP on the horizontal\nAccess for free at openstax.org D \u2022 The Expenditure-Output Model 881\naxis. However, all the other factors that vary investment\u2014new technological opportunities, expectations about\nnear-term economic growth, interest rates, the price of key inputs, and tax incentives for investment\u2014can\ncause the horizontal investment function to shift up or down.\nGovernment Spending and Taxes as a Function of National Income\nIn the Keynesian cross diagram, government spending appears as a horizontal line, as inFigure D4, where\ngovernment spending is set at a level of 1,300. As in the case of investment spending, this horizontal line does\nnot mean that government spending is unchanging. It means only that government spending changes when\nCongress decides on a change in the budget, rather than shifting in a predictable way with the current size of\nthe real GDP shown on the horizontal axis.\nFIGURED4The Government Spending FunctionThe level of government spending is determined by political\nfactors, not by the level of real GDP in a given year. Thus, government spending is drawn as a horizontal line. In this\nexample, government spending is at a level of 1,300. Congressional decisions to increase government spending will\ncause this horizontal line to shift up, while decisions to reduce spending would cause it to shift down.\nThe situation of taxes is different because taxes often rise or fall with the volume of economic activity. For\nexample, income taxes are based on the level of income earned and sales taxes are based on the amount of\nsales made, and both income and sales tend to be higher when the economy is growing and lower when the\neconomy is in a recession. For the purposes of constructing the basic Keynesian cross diagram, it is helpful to\nview taxes as a proportionate share of GDP. In the United States, for example, taking federal, state, and local\ntaxes together, government typically collects about 30\u201335 % of income as taxes.\nTable D2revises the earlier table on the consumption function so that it takes taxes into account. The first\ncolumn shows national income. The second column calculates taxes, which in this example are set at a rate of\n30%, or 0.3. The third column shows after-tax income; that is, total income minus taxes. The fourth column\nthen calculates consumption in the same manner as before: multiply after-tax income by 0.8, representing the\nmarginal propensity to consume, and then add $600, for the amount that would be consumed even if income\nwas zero. When taxes are included, the marginal propensity to consume is reduced by the amount of the tax\nrate, so each additional dollar of income results in a smaller increase in consumption than before taxes. For\nthis reason, the consumption function, with taxes included, is flatter than the consumption function without\ntaxes, asFigure D5shows. 882 D \u2022 The Expenditure-Output Model\nFIGURED5The Consumption Function Before and After TaxesThe upper line repeats the consumption function\nfromFigure D2. The lower line shows the consumption function if taxes must first be paid on income, and then\nconsumption is based on after-tax income.\nIncome Taxes After-Tax Income Consumption Savings\n$0 $0 $0 $600 \u2013$600\n$1,000 $300 $700 $1,160 \u2013$460\n$2,000 $600 $1,400 $1,720 \u2013$320\n$3,000 $900 $2,100 $2,280 \u2013$180\n$4,000 $1,200 $2,800 $2,840 \u2013$40\n$5,000 $1,500 $3,500 $3,400 $100\n$6,000 $1,800 $4,200 $3,960 $240\n$7,000 $2,100 $4,900 $4,520 $380\n$8,000 $2,400 $5,600 $5,080 $520\n$9,000 $2,700 $6,300 $5,640 $660\nTABLED2The Consumption Function Before and After Taxes\nExports and Imports as a Function of National Income\nThe export function, which shows how exports change with the level of a country\u2019s own real GDP, is drawn as a\nhorizontal line, as in the example inFigure D6(a) where exports are drawn at a level of $840. Again, as in the\ncase of investment spending and government spending, drawing the export function as horizontal does not\nimply that exports never change. It just means that they do not change because of what is on the horizontal\naxis\u2014that is, a country\u2019s own level of domestic production\u2014and instead are shaped by the level of aggregate\ndemand in other countries. More demand for exports from other countries would cause the export function to\nshift up; less demand for exports from other countries would cause it to shift down.\nAccess for free at openstax.org D \u2022 The Expenditure-Output Model 883\nFIGURED6The Export and Import Functions(a) The export function is drawn as a horizontal line because exports\nare determined by the buying power of other countries and thus do not change with the size of the domestic\neconomy. In this example, exports are set at 840. However, exports can shift up or down, depending on buying\npatterns in other countries. (b) The import function is drawn in negative territory because expenditures on imported\nproducts are a subtraction from expenditures in the domestic economy. In this example, the marginal propensity to\nimport is 0.1, so imports are calculated by multiplying the level of income by \u20130.1.\nImports are drawn in the Keynesian cross diagram as a downward-sloping line, with the downward slope\ndetermined by themarginal propensity to import (MPI), out of national income. InFigure D6(b), the marginal\npropensity to import is 0.1. Thus, if real GDP is $5,000, imports are $500; if national income is $6,000, imports\nare $600, and so on. The import function is drawn as downward sloping and negative, because it represents a\nsubtraction from the aggregate expenditures in the domestic economy. A change in the marginal propensity to\nimport, perhaps as a result of changes in preferences, would alter the slope of the import function.\nWORK IT OUT\nUsing an Algebraic Approach to the Expenditure-Output Model\nIn the expenditure-output or Keynesian cross model, the equilibrium occurs where the aggregate expenditure\nline (AE line) crosses the 45-degree line. Given algebraic equations for two lines, the point where they cross can\nbe readily calculated. Imagine an economy with the following characteristics.\nY = Real GDP or national income\nT = Taxes = 0.3Y\nC = Consumption = 140 + 0.9(Y \u2013 T)\nI = Investment = 400\nG = Government spending = 800\nX = Exports = 600\nM = Imports = 0.15Y\nStep 1. Determine the aggregate expenditure function. In this case, it is:\nStep 2. The equation for the 45-degree line is the set of points where GDP or national income on the horizontal 884 D \u2022 The Expenditure-Output Model\naxis is equal to aggregate expenditure on the vertical axis. Thus, the equation for the 45-degree line is: AE = Y.\nStep 3. The next step is to solve these two equations for Y (or AE, since they will be equal to each other).\nSubstitute Y for AE:\nStep 4. Insert the term 0.3Y for the tax rate T. This produces an equation with only one variable, Y.\nStep 5. Work through the algebra and solve for Y.\nThis algebraic framework is flexible and useful in predicting how economic events and policy actions will affect\nreal GDP.\nStep 6. Say, for example, that because of changes in the relative prices of domestic and foreign goods, the\nmarginal propensity to import falls to 0.1. Calculate the equilibrium output when the marginal propensity to\nimport is changed to 0.1.\nStep 7. Because of a surge of business confidence, investment rises to 500. Calculate the equilibrium output.\nFor issues of policy, the key questions would be how to adjust government spending levels or tax rates so that\nthe equilibrium level of output is the full employment level. In this case, let the economic parameters be:\nY = National income\nT = Taxes = 0.3Y\nC = Consumption = 200 + 0.9(Y \u2013 T)\nI = Investment = 600\nG = Government spending = 1,000\nX = Exports = 600\nY = Imports = 0.1(Y \u2013 T)\nStep 8. Calculate the equilibrium for this economy (remember Y = AE).\nAccess for free at openstax.org D \u2022 The Expenditure-Output Model 885\nStep 9. Assume that the full employment level of output is 6,000. What level of government spending would be\nnecessary to reach that level? To answer this question, plug in 6,000 as equal to Y, but leave G as a variable, and\nsolve for G. Thus:\nStep 10. Solve this problem arithmetically. The answer is: G = 1,240. In other words, increasing government\nspending by 240, from its original level of 1,000, to 1,240, would raise output to the full employment level of\nGDP.\nIndeed, the question of how much to increase government spending so that equilibrium output will rise from\n5,454 to 6,000 can be answered without working through the algebra, just by using the multiplier formula. The\nmultiplier equation in this case is:\nThus, to raise output by 546 would require an increase in government spending of 546/2.27=240, which is the\nsame as the answer derived from the algebraic calculation.\nThis algebraic framework is highly flexible. For example, taxes can be treated as a total set by political\nconsiderations (like government spending) and not dependent on national income. Imports might be based on\nbefore-tax income, not after-tax income. For certain purposes, it may be helpful to analyze the economy without\nexports and imports. A more complicated approach could divide up consumption, investment, government,\nexports and imports into smaller categories, or to build in some variability in the rates of taxes, savings, and\nimports. A wise economist will shape the model to fit the specific question under investigation.\nBuilding the Combined Aggregate Expenditure Function\nAll the components ofaggregate demand\u2014consumption, investment, government spending, and the trade\nbalance\u2014are now in place to build the Keynesian cross diagram.Figure D7builds up an aggregate expenditure\nfunction, based on the numerical illustrations of C, I, G, X, and M that have been used throughout this text. The\nfirst three columns inTable D3are lifted from the earlierTable D2, which showed how to bring taxes into the\nconsumption function. The first column is real GDP or national income, which is what appears on the\nhorizontal axis of the income-expenditure diagram. The second column calculates after-tax income, based on\nthe assumption, in this case, that 30% of real GDP is collected in taxes. The third column is based on an MPC of\n0.8, so that as after-tax income rises by $700 from one row to the next, consumption rises by $560 (700 \u00d7 0.8)\nfrom one row to the next. Investment, government spending, and exports do not change with the level of\ncurrent national income. In the previous discussion, investment was $500, government spending was $1,300,\nand exports were $840, for a total of $2,640. This total is shown in the fourth column. Imports are 0.1 of real\nGDP in this example, and the level of imports is calculated in the fifth column. The final column,aggregate\nexpenditures, sums up C + I + G + X \u2013 M. Thisaggregate expenditure lineis illustrated inFigure D7. 886 D \u2022 The Expenditure-Output Model\nFIGURED7A Keynesian Cross DiagramEach combination of national income and aggregate expenditure (after-tax\nconsumption, government spending, investment, exports, and imports) is graphed. The equilibrium occurs where\naggregate expenditure is equal to national income; this occurs where the aggregate expenditure schedule crosses\nthe 45-degree line, at a real GDP of $6,000. Potential GDP in this example is $7,000, so the equilibrium is occurring\nat a level of output or real GDP below the potential GDP level.\nNational After-Tax Government Spending + Aggregate\nConsumption Imports\nIncome Income Investment + Exports Expenditure\n$3,000 $2,100 $2,280 $2,640 $300 $4,620\n$4,000 $2,800 $2,840 $2,640 $400 $5,080\n$5,000 $3,500 $3,400 $2,640 $500 $5,540\n$6,000 $4,200 $3,960 $2,640 $600 $6,000\n$7,000 $4,900 $4,520 $2,640 $700 $6,460\n$8,000 $5,600 $5,080 $2,640 $800 $6,920\n$9,000 $6,300 $5,640 $2,640 $900 $7,380\nTABLED3National Income-Aggregate Expenditure Equilibrium\nTheaggregate expenditure functionis formed by stacking on top of each other the consumption function (after\ntaxes), the investment function, the government spending function, the export function, and the import\nfunction. The point at which the aggregate expenditure function intersects the vertical axis will be determined\nby the levels of investment, government, and export expenditures\u2014which do not vary with national income.\nThe upward slope of the aggregate expenditure function will be determined by the marginal propensity to\nsave, the tax rate, and the marginal propensity to import. A higher marginal propensity to save, a higher tax\nrate, and a higher marginal propensity to import will all make the slope of the aggregate expenditure function\nflatter\u2014because out of any extra income, more is going to savings or taxes or imports and less to spending on\ndomestic goods and services.\nThe equilibrium occurs where national income is equal to aggregate expenditure, which is shown on the graph\nAccess for free at openstax.org D \u2022 The Expenditure-Output Model 887\nas the point where the aggregate expenditure schedule crosses the 45-degree line. In this example, the\nequilibrium occurs at 6,000. This equilibrium can also be read off the table under the figure; it is the level of\nnational income where aggregate expenditure is equal to national income.\nEquilibrium in the Keynesian Cross Model\nWith the aggregate expenditure line in place, the next step is to relate it to the two other elements of the\nKeynesian cross diagram. Thus, the first subsection interprets the intersection of the aggregate expenditure\nfunction and the 45-degree line, while the next subsection relates this point of intersection to the potential\nGDP line.\nWhere Equilibrium Occurs\nThe point where the aggregate expenditure line that is constructed from C + I + G + X \u2013 M crosses the\n45-degree line will be the equilibrium for the economy. It is the only point on the aggregate expenditure line\nwhere the total amount being spent on aggregate demand equals the total level of production. InFigure D7,\nthis point of equilibrium (E ) happens at 6,000, which can also be read offTable D3.\n0\nThe meaning of \u201cequilibrium\u201d remains the same; that is,equilibriumis a point of balance where no incentive\nexists to shift away from that outcome. To understand why the point of intersection between the aggregate\nexpenditure function and the 45-degree line is a macroeconomic equilibrium, consider what would happen if\nan economy found itself to the right of the equilibrium point E, say point H inFigure D8, where output is higher\nthan the equilibrium. At point H, the level of aggregate expenditure is below the 45-degree line, so that the\nlevel of aggregate expenditure in the economy is less than the level of output. As a result, at point H, output is\npiling up unsold\u2014not a sustainable state of affairs.\nFIGURED8Equilibrium in the Keynesian Cross DiagramIf output was above the equilibrium level, at H, then the\nreal output is greater than the aggregate expenditure in the economy. This pattern cannot hold, because it would\nmean that goods are produced but piling up unsold. If output was below the equilibrium level at L, then aggregate\nexpenditure would be greater than output. This pattern cannot hold either, because it would mean that spending\nexceeds the number of goods being produced. Only point E can be at equilibrium, where output, or national income\nand aggregate expenditure, are equal. The equilibrium (E) must lie on the 45-degree line, which is the set of points\nwhere national income and aggregate expenditure are equal.\nConversely, consider the situation where the level of output is at point L\u2014where real output is lower than the\nequilibrium. In that case, the level of aggregate demand in the economy is above the 45-degree line, indicating\nthat the level of aggregate expenditure in the economy is greater than the level of output. When the level of\naggregate demand has emptied the store shelves, it cannot be sustained, either. Firms will respond by\nincreasing their level of production. Thus, the equilibrium must be the point where the amount produced and 888 D \u2022 The Expenditure-Output Model\nthe amount spent are in balance, at the intersection of the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree\nline.\nWORK IT OUT\nFinding Equilibrium\nTable D4gives some information on an economy. The Keynesian model assumes that there is some level of\nconsumption even without income. That amount is $236 \u2013 $216 = $20. $20 will be consumed when national\nincome equals zero. Assume that taxes are 0.2 of real GDP. Let the marginal propensity to save of after-tax\nincome be 0.1. The level of investment is $70, the level of government spending is $80, and the level of exports\nis $50. Imports are 0.2 of after-tax income. Given these values, you need to completeTable D4and then answer\nthese questions:\n\u2022 What is the consumption function?\n\u2022 What is the equilibrium?\n\u2022 Why is a national income of $300 not at equilibrium?\n\u2022 How do expenditures and output compare at this point?\nNational After-tax I + G + Aggregate\nTaxes Consumption Imports\nIncome income X Expenditures\n$300 $236\n$400\n$500\n$600\n$700\nTABLED4\nStep 1. Calculate the amount of taxes for each level of national income(reminder: GDP = national income) for\neach level of national income using the following as an example:\nStep 2. Calculate after-tax income by subtracting the tax amount from national income for each level of national\nincome using the following as an example:\nStep 3. Calculate consumption. The marginal propensity to save is given as 0.1. This means that the marginal\npropensity to consume is 0.9, since MPS + MPC = 1. Therefore, multiply 0.9 by the after-tax income amount using\nthe following as an example:\nAccess for free at openstax.org D \u2022 The Expenditure-Output Model 889\nStep 4. Consider why the table shows consumption of $236 in the first row. As mentioned earlier, the Keynesian\nmodel assumes that there is some level of consumption even without income. That amount is $236 \u2013 $216 =\n$20.\nStep 5. There is now enough information to write the consumption function. The consumption function is found\nby figuring out the level of consumption that will happen when income is zero. Remember that:\nLet C represent the consumption function, Y represent national income, and T represent taxes.\nStep 6. Use the consumption function to find consumption at each level of national income.\nStep 7. Add investment (I), government spending (G), and exports (X). Remember that these do not change as\nnational income changes:\nStep 8. Find imports, which are 0.2 of after-tax income at each level of national income. For example:\nStep 9. Find aggregate expenditure by adding C + I + G + X \u2013 I for each level of national income. Your completed\ntable should look likeTable D5.\nNational Tax = After-tax Minus\nConsumption C = I + G Aggregate Expenditures\nIncome 0.2 \u00d7 Y income (Y \u2013 Imports\n$20 + 0.9(Y \u2013 T) + X AE = C + I + G + X \u2013 M\n(Y) (T) T) (M)\n$300 $60 $240 $236 $200 $48 $388\n$400 $80 $320 $308 $200 $64 $444\n$500 $100 $400 $380 $200 $80 $500\n$600 $120 $480 $452 $200 $96 $556\n$700 $140 $560 $524 $200 $112 $612\nTABLED5\nStep 10. Answer the question: What is equilibrium? Equilibrium occurs where AE = Y.Table D5shows that\nequilibrium occurs where national income equals aggregate expenditure at $500.\nStep 11. Find equilibrium mathematically, knowing that national income is equal to aggregate expenditure.\nSince T is 0.2 of national income, substitute T with 0.2 Y so that: 890 D \u2022 The Expenditure-Output Model\nSolve for Y.\nStep 12. Answer this question: Why is a national income of $300 not an equilibrium? At national income of $300,\naggregate expenditures are $388.\nStep 13. Answer this question: How do expenditures and output compare at this point? Aggregate expenditures\ncannot exceed output (GDP) in the long run, since there would not be enough goods to be bought.\nRecessionary and Inflationary Gaps\nIn the Keynesian cross diagram, if the aggregate expenditure line intersects the 45-degree line at the level of\npotential GDP, then the economy is in sound shape. There is no recession, and unemployment is low. But there\nis no guarantee that the equilibrium will occur at the potential GDP level of output. The equilibrium might be\nhigher or lower.\nFor example,Figure D9(a) illustrates a situation where the aggregate expenditure line intersects the 45-degree\nline at point E , which is a real GDP of $6,000, and which is below the potential GDP of $7,000. In this situation,\n0\nthe level of aggregate expenditure is too low for GDP to reach its full employment level, and unemployment will\noccur. The distance between an output level like E that is below potential GDP and the level of potential GDP is\n0\ncalled arecessionary gap. Because the equilibrium level of real GDP is so low, firms will not wish to hire the full\nemployment number of workers, and unemployment will be high.\nFIGURED9Addressing Recessionary and Inflationary Gaps(a) If the equilibrium occurs at an output below\npotential GDP, then a recessionary gap exists. The policy solution to a recessionary gap is to shift the aggregate\nAccess for free at openstax.org D \u2022 The Expenditure-Output Model 891\nexpenditure schedule up from AE to AE , using policies like tax cuts or government spending increases. Then the\n0 1\nnew equilibrium E occurs at potential GDP. (b) If the equilibrium occurs at an output above potential GDP, then an\n1\ninflationary gap exists. The policy solution to an inflationary gap is to shift the aggregate expenditure schedule down\nfrom AE to AE , using policies like tax increases or spending cuts. Then, the new equilibrium E occurs at potential\n0 1 1\nGDP.\nWhat might cause a recessionary gap? Anything that shifts the aggregate expenditure line down is a potential\ncause of recession, including a decline in consumption, a rise in savings, a fall in investment, a drop in\ngovernment spending or a rise in taxes, or a fall in exports or a rise in imports. Moreover, an economy that is at\nequilibrium with a recessionary gap may just stay there and suffer high unemployment for a long time;\nremember, the meaning of equilibrium is that there is no particular adjustment of prices or quantities in the\neconomy to chase the recession away.\nThe appropriate response to a recessionary gap is for the government to reduce taxes or increase spending so\nthat the aggregate expenditure function shifts up from AE to AE . When this shift occurs, the new equilibrium\n0 1\nE now occurs at potential GDP as shown inFigure D9(a).\n1\nConversely,Figure D9(b) shows a situation where the aggregate expenditure schedule (AE ) intersects the\n0\n45-degree line above potential GDP. The gap between the level of real GDP at the equilibrium E and potential\n0\nGDP is called aninflationary gap. The inflationary gap also requires a bit of interpreting. After all, a na\u00efve\nreading of the Keynesian cross diagram might suggest that if the aggregate expenditure function is just pushed\nup high enough, real GDP can be as large as desired\u2014even doubling or tripling the potential GDP level of the\neconomy. This implication is clearly wrong. An economy faces some supply-side limits on how much it can\nproduce at a given time with its existing quantities of workers, physical and human capital, technology, and\nmarket institutions.\nThe inflationary gap should be interpreted, not as a literal prediction of how large real GDP will be, but as a\nstatement of how much extra aggregate expenditure is in the economy beyond what is needed to reach\npotential GDP. An inflationary gap suggests that because the economy cannot produce enough goods and\nservices to absorb this level of aggregate expenditures, the spending will instead cause an inflationary increase\nin the price level. In this way, even though changes in the price level do not appear explicitly in the Keynesian\ncross equation, the notion of inflation is implicit in the concept of the inflationary gap.\nThe appropriate Keynesian response to an inflationary gap is shown inFigure D9(b). The original intersection\nof aggregate expenditure line AE and the 45-degree line occurs at $8,000, which is above the level of potential\n0\nGDP at $7,000. If AE shifts down to AE , so that the new equilibrium is at E , then the economy will be at\n0 1 1\npotential GDP without pressures for inflationary price increases. The government can achieve a downward\nshift in aggregate expenditure by increasing taxes on consumers or firms, or by reducing government\nexpenditures.\nThe Multiplier Effect\nThe Keynesian policy prescription has one final twist. Assume that for a certain economy, the intersection of\nthe aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line is at a GDP of 700, while the level of potential GDP\nfor this economy is $800. By how much does government spending need to be increased so that the economy\nreaches the full employment GDP? The obvious answer might seem to be $800 \u2013 $700 = $100; so raise\ngovernment spending by $100. But that answer is incorrect. A change of, for example, $100 in government\nexpenditures will have an effect of more than $100 on the equilibrium level of real GDP. The reason is that a\nchange in aggregate expenditures circles through the economy: households buy from firms, firms pay workers\nand suppliers, workers and suppliers buy goods from other firms, those firms pay their workers and suppliers,\nand so on. In this way, the original change in aggregate expenditures is actually spent more than once. This is\ncalled themultiplier effect: An initial increase in spending, cycles repeatedly through the economy and has a\nlarger impact than the initial dollar amount spent. 892 D \u2022 The Expenditure-Output Model\nHow Does the Multiplier Work?\nTo understand how the multiplier effect works, return to the example in which the current equilibrium in the\nKeynesian cross diagram is a real GDP of $700, or $100 short of the $800 needed to be at full employment,\npotential GDP. If the government spends $100 to close this gap, someone in the economy receives that\nspending and can treat it as income. Assume that those who receive this income pay 30% in taxes, save 10% of\nafter-tax income, spend 10% of total income on imports, and then spend the rest on domestically produced\ngoods and services.\nAs shown in the calculations inFigure D10andTable D6, out of the original $100 in government spending, $53\nis left to spend on domestically produced goods and services. That $53 which was spent, becomes income to\nsomeone, somewhere in the economy. Those who receive that income also pay 30% in taxes, save 10% of after-\ntax income, and spend 10% of total income on imports, as shown inFigure D10, so that an additional $28.09\n(that is, 0.53 \u00d7 $53) is spent in the third round. The people who receive that income then pay taxes, save, and\nbuy imports, and the amount spent in the fourth round is $14.89 (that is, 0.53 \u00d7 $28.09).\nFIGURED10The Multiplier EffectAn original increase of government spending of $100 causes a rise in aggregate\nexpenditure of $100. But that $100 is income to others in the economy, and after they save, pay taxes, and buy\nimports, they spend $53 of that $100 in a second round. In turn, that $53 is income to others. Thus, the original\ngovernment spending of $100 is multiplied by these cycles of spending, but the impact of each successive cycle\ngets smaller and smaller. Given the numbers in this example, the original government spending increase of $100\nraises aggregate expenditure by $213; therefore, the multiplier in this example is $213/$100 = 2.13.\nOriginal increase in aggregate expenditure from government spending 100\nWhich is income to people throughout the economy: Pay 30% in taxes. Save 10% of after-tax\n70 \u2013 7 \u2013 10 = 53\nincome. Spend 10% of income on imports. Second-round increase of\u2026\nWhich is $53 of income to people through the economy: Pay 30% in taxes. Save 10% of 37.1 \u2013 3.71 \u2013 5.3\nafter-tax income. Spend 10% of income on imports. Third-round increase of\u2026 = 28.09\nWhich is $28.09 of income to people through the economy: Pay 30% in taxes. Save 10% of 19.663 \u2013 1.96633\nafter-tax income. Spend 10% of income on imports. Fourth-round increase of\u2026 \u2013 2.809 = 14.89\nTABLED6Calculating the Multiplier Effect\nThus, over the first four rounds of aggregate expenditures, the impact of the original increase in government\nspending of $100 creates a rise in aggregate expenditures of $100 + $53 + $28.09 + $14.89 = $195.98.Figure\nD10shows these total aggregate expenditures after these first four rounds, and then the figure shows the total\nAccess for free at openstax.org D \u2022 The Expenditure-Output Model 893\naggregate expenditures after 30 rounds. The additional boost to aggregate expenditures is shrinking in each\nround of consumption. After about 10 rounds, the additional increments are very small indeed\u2014nearly\ninvisible to the naked eye. After 30 rounds, the additional increments in each round are so small that they have\nno practical consequence. After 30 rounds, the cumulative value of the initial boost in aggregate expenditure is\napproximately $213. Thus, the government spending increase of $100 eventually, after many cycles, produced\nan increase of $213 in aggregate expenditure and real GDP. In this example, the multiplier is $213/$100 = 2.13.\nCalculating the Multiplier\nFortunately for everyone who is not carrying around a computer with a spreadsheet program to project the\nimpact of an original increase in expenditures over 20, 50, or 100 rounds of spending, there is a formula for\ncalculating the multiplier.\nThe data fromFigure D10andTable D6is:\n\u2022 Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS) = 30%\n\u2022 Tax rate = 10%\n\u2022 Marginal Propensity to Import (MPI) = 10%\nThe MPC is equal to 1 \u2013 MPS, or 0.7. Therefore, the spending multiplier is:\nA change in spending of $100 multiplied by the spending multiplier of 2.13 is equal to a change in GDP of\n$213. Not coincidentally, this result is exactly what was calculated inFigure D10after many rounds of\nexpenditures cycling through the economy.\nThe size of the multiplier is determined by what proportion of the marginal dollar of income goes into taxes,\nsaving, and imports. These three factors are known as \u201cleakages,\u201d because they determine how much demand\n\u201cleaks out\u201d in each round of the multiplier effect. If the leakages are relatively small, then each successive\nround of the multiplier effect will have larger amounts of demand, and the multiplier will be high. Conversely,\nif the leakages are relatively large, then any initial change in demand will diminish more quickly in the second,\nthird, and later rounds, and the multiplier will be small. Changes in the size of the leakages\u2014a change in the\nmarginal propensity to save, the tax rate, or the marginal propensity to import\u2014will change the size of the\nmultiplier.\nCalculating Keynesian Policy Interventions\nReturning to the original question: How much should government spending be increased to produce a total\nincrease in real GDP of $100? If the goal is to increase aggregate demand by $100, and the multiplier is 2.13,\nthen the increase in government spending to achieve that goal would be $100/2.13 = $47. Government\nspending of approximately $47, when combined with a multiplier of 2.13 (which is, remember, based on the\nspecific assumptions about tax, saving, and import rates), produces an overall increase in real GDP of $100,\nrestoring the economy to potential GDP of $800, asFigure D11shows. 894 D \u2022 The Expenditure-Output Model\nFIGURED11The Multiplier Effect in an Expenditure-Output ModelThe power of the multiplier effect is that an\nincrease in expenditure has a larger increase on the equilibrium output. The increase in expenditure is the vertical\nincrease from AE to AE . However, the increase in equilibrium output, shown on the horizontal axis, is clearly larger.\n0 1\nThe multiplier effect is also visible on the Keynesian cross diagram.Figure D11shows the example we have\nbeen discussing: a recessionary gap with an equilibrium of $700, potential GDP of $800, the slope of the\naggregate expenditure function (AE ) determined by the assumptions that taxes are 30% of income, savings\n0\nare 0.1 of after-tax income, and imports are 0.1 of before-tax income. At AE , the aggregate expenditure\n1\nfunction is moved up to reach potential GDP.\nNow, compare the vertical shift upward in the aggregate expenditure function, which is $47, with the\nhorizontal shift outward in real GDP, which is $100 (as these numbers were calculated earlier). The rise in real\nGDP is more than double the rise in the aggregate expenditure function. (Similarly, if you look back atFigure\nD9, you will see that the vertical movements in the aggregate expenditure functions are smaller than the\nchange in equilibrium output that is produced on the horizontal axis. Again, this is the multiplier effect at\nwork.) In this way, the power of the multiplier is apparent in the income\u2013expenditure graph, as well as in the\narithmetic calculation.\nThe multiplier does not just affect government spending, but applies to any change in the economy. Say that\nbusiness confidence declines and investment falls off, or that the economy of a leading trading partner slows\ndown so that export sales decline. These changes will reduce aggregate expenditures, and then will have an\neven larger effect on real GDP because of the multiplier effect. Read the following Clear It Up feature to learn\nhow the multiplier effect can be applied to analyze the economic impact of professional sports.\nCLEAR IT UP\nHow can the multiplier be used to analyze the economic impact of professional sports?\nAttracting professional sports teams and building sports stadiums to create jobs and stimulate business growth is\nan economic development strategy adopted by many communities throughout the United States. In his recent\narticle, \u201cPublic Financing of Private Sports Stadiums,\u201d James Joyner ofOutside the Beltwaylooked at public\nfinancing for NFL teams. Joyner\u2019s findings confirm the earlier work of John Siegfried of Vanderbilt University and\nAndrew Zimbalist of Smith College.\nSiegfried and Zimbalist used the multiplier to analyze this issue. They considered the amount of taxes paid and\ndollars spent locally to see if there was a positive multiplier effect. Since most professional athletes and owners of\nsports teams are rich enough to owe a lot of taxes, let\u2019s say that 40% of any marginal income they earn is paid in\nAccess for free at openstax.org D \u2022 The Expenditure-Output Model 895\ntaxes. Because athletes are often high earners with short careers, let\u2019s assume that they save one-third of their\nafter-tax income.\nHowever, many professional athletes do not live year-round in the city in which they play, so let\u2019s say that one-half\nof the money that they do spend is spent outside the local area. One can think of spending outside a local economy,\nin this example, as the equivalent of imported goods for the national economy.\nNow, consider the impact of money spent at local entertainment venues other than professional sports. While the\nowners of these other businesses may be comfortably middle-income, few of them are in the economic\nstratosphere of professional athletes. Because their incomes are lower, so are their taxes; say that they pay only\n35% of their marginal income in taxes. They do not have the same ability, or need, to save as much as professional\nathletes, so let\u2019s assume their MPC is just 0.8. Finally, because more of them live locally, they will spend a higher\nproportion of their income on local goods\u2014say, 65%.\nIf these general assumptions hold true, then money spent on professional sports will have less local economic\nimpact than money spent on other forms of entertainment. For professional athletes, out of a dollar earned, 40\ncents goes to taxes, leaving 60 cents. Of that 60 cents, one-third is saved, leaving 40 cents, and half is spent outside\nthe area, leaving 20 cents. Only 20 cents of each dollar is cycled into the local economy in the first round. For\nlocally-owned entertainment, out of a dollar earned, 35 cents goes to taxes, leaving 65 cents. Of the rest, 20% is\nsaved, leaving 52 cents, and of that amount, 65% is spent in the local area, so that 33.8 cents of each dollar of\nincome is recycled into the local economy.\nSiegfried and Zimbalist make the plausible argument that, within their household budgets, people have a fixed\namount to spend on entertainment. If this assumption holds true, then money spent attending professional sports\nevents is money that was not spent on other entertainment options in a given metropolitan area. Since the multiplier\nis lower for professional sports than for other local entertainment options, the arrival of professional sports to a city\nwould reallocate entertainment spending in a way that causes the local economy to shrink, rather than to grow.\nThus, their findings seem to confirm what Joyner reports and what newspapers across the country are reporting. A\nquick Internet search for \u201ceconomic impact of sports\u201d will yield numerous reports questioning this economic\ndevelopment strategy.\nMultiplier Tradeoffs: Stability versus the Power of Macroeconomic Policy\nIs an economy healthier with a high multiplier or a low one? With a high multiplier, any change in aggregate\ndemand will tend to be substantially magnified, and so the economy will be more unstable. With a low\nmultiplier, by contrast, changes in aggregate demand will not be multiplied much, so the economy will tend to\nbe more stable.\nHowever, with a low multiplier, government policy changes in taxes or spending will tend to have less impact\non the equilibrium level of real output. With a higher multiplier, government policies to raise or reduce\naggregate expenditures will have a larger effect. Thus, a low multiplier means a more stable economy, but also\nweaker government macroeconomic policy, while a high multiplier means a more volatile economy, but also\nan economy in which government macroeconomic policy is more powerful.\nKey Concepts and Summary\nThe expenditure-output model or Keynesian cross diagram shows how the level of aggregate expenditure (on\nthe vertical axis) varies with the level of economic output (shown on the horizontal axis). Since the value of all\nmacroeconomic output also represents income to someone somewhere else in the economy, the horizontal\naxis can also be interpreted as national income. The equilibrium in the diagram will occur where the aggregate\nexpenditure line crosses the 45-degree line, which represents the set of points where aggregate expenditure in\nthe economy is equal to output (or national income). Equilibrium in a Keynesian cross diagram can happen at\npotential GDP, or below or above that level. 896 D \u2022 The Expenditure-Output Model\nThe consumption function shows the upward-sloping relationship between national income and consumption.\nThe marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the amount consumed out of an additional dollar of income. A\nhigher marginal propensity to consume means a steeper consumption function; a lower marginal propensity\nto consume means a flatter consumption function. The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the amount saved\nout of an additional dollar of income. It is necessarily true that MPC + MPS = 1. The investment function is\ndrawn as a flat line, showing that investment in the current year does not change with regard to the current\nlevel of national income. However, the investment function will move up and down based on the expected rate\nof return in the future. Government spending is drawn as a horizontal line in the Keynesian cross diagram,\nbecause its level is determined by political considerations, not by the current level of income in the economy.\nTaxes in the basic Keynesian cross diagram are taken into account by adjusting the consumption function. The\nexport function is drawn as a horizontal line in the Keynesian cross diagram, because exports do not change as\na result of changes in domestic income, but they move as a result of changes in foreign income, as well as\nchanges in exchange rates. The import function is drawn as a downward-sloping line, because imports rise\nwith national income, but imports are a subtraction from aggregate demand. Thus, a higher level of imports\nmeans a lower level of expenditure on domestic goods.\nIn a Keynesian cross diagram, the equilibrium may be at a level below potential GDP, which is called a\nrecessionary gap, or at a level above potential GDP, which is called an inflationary gap.\nThe multiplier effect describes how an initial change in aggregate demand generated several times as much as\ncumulative GDP. The size of the spending multiplier is determined by three leakages: spending on savings,\ntaxes, and imports. The formula for the multiplier is:\nAn economy with a lower multiplier is more stable\u2014it is less affected either by economic events or by\ngovernment policy than an economy with a higher multiplier.\nSelf-Check Questions\nExerciseD1\nSketch the aggregate expenditure-output diagram with the recessionary gap.\nThe following figure shows the aggregate expenditure-output diagram with the recessionary gap.\nExerciseD2\nSketch the aggregate expenditure-output diagram with an inflationary gap.\nAccess for free at openstax.org D \u2022 The Expenditure-Output Model 897\nThe following figure shows the aggregate expenditure-output diagram with an inflationary gap.\nExerciseD3\nAn economy has the following characteristics:\nY = National income\nTaxes = T = 0.25Y\nC = Consumption = 400 + 0.85(Y \u2013 T)\nI = 300\nG = 200\nX = 500\nM = 0.1(Y \u2013 T)\nFind the equilibrium for this economy. If potential GDP is 3,500, then what change in government spending is\nneeded to achieve this level? Do this problem two ways. First, plug 3,500 into the equations and solve for G.\nSecond, calculate the multiplier and figure it out that way.\nFirst, set up the calculation.\nThen insert Y for AE and 0.25Y for T.\nIf full employment is 3,500, then one approach is to plug in 3,500 for Y throughout the equation, but to leave G\nas a separate variable. 898 D \u2022 The Expenditure-Output Model\nA G value of 331.25 is an increase of 131.25 from its original level of 200.\nAlternatively, the multiplier is that, out of every dollar spent, 0.25 goes to taxes, leaving 0.75, and out of after-\ntax income, 0.15 goes to savings and 0.1 to imports. Because (0.75)(0.15) = 0.1125 and (0.75)(0.1) = 0.075, this\nmeans that out of every dollar spent: 1 \u20130.25 \u20130.1125 \u20130.075 = 0.5625.\nThus, using the formula, the multiplier is:\nTo increase equilibrium GDP by 300, it will take a boost of 300/2.2837, which again works out to 131.25.\nExerciseD4\nTable D7represents the data behind a Keynesian cross diagram. Assume that the tax rate is 0.4 of national\nincome; the MPC out of the after-tax income is 0.8; investment is $2,000; government spending is $1,000;\nexports are $2,000 and imports are 0.05 of after-tax income.

Use an MPC of 80% in an example.\nThe multiplier refers to how many times a dollar will turnover in the economy. It is based on the Marginal\nPropensity to Consume (MPC) which tells how much of every dollar received will be spent. If the MPC is 80%\nthen this means that out of every one dollar received by a consumer, $0.80 will be spent. This $0.80 is received\nby another person. In turn, 80% of the $0.80 received, or $0.64, will be spent, and so on. The impact of the\nmultiplier is diluted when the effect of taxes and expenditure on imports is considered. To derive the\nmultiplier, take the 1/1 \u2013 F; where F is equal to percent of savings, taxes, and expenditures on imports.\nReview Questions\nExerciseD6\nWhat is on the axes of an expenditure-output diagram?\nExerciseD7\nWhat does the 45-degree line show?\nExerciseD8\nWhat determines the slope of a consumption function?\nExerciseD9\nWhat is the marginal propensity to consume, and how is it related to the marginal propensity to import?\nExerciseD10\nWhy are the investment function, the government spending function, and the export function all drawn as flat\nlines?\nExerciseD11\nWhy does the import function slope down?

Scarcity means human wants for goods and services exceed the available supply. Supply is limited\nbecause resources are limited. Demand, however, is virtually unlimited. Whatever the supply, it seems\nhuman nature to want more.\n2. 100 people / 10 people per ham = a maximum of 10 hams per month if all residents produce ham. Since\nconsumption is limited by production, the maximum number of hams residents could consume per\nmonth is 10.\n3. She is very productive at her consulting job, but not very productive growing vegetables. Time spent\nconsulting would produce far more income than it what she could save growing her vegetables using the\nsame amount of time. So on purely economic grounds, it makes more sense for her to maximize her\nincome by applying her labor to what she does best (i.e. specialization of labor).\n4. The engineer is better at computer science than at painting. Thus, his time is better spent working for pay\nat his job and paying a painter to paint his house. Of course, this assumes he does not paint his house for\nfun!\n5.

Why are so few AIDS patients in Africa and\nSoutheast Asia treated with the same drugs that are effective in the United States and Europe? It is\nbecause neither those patients nor the countries in which they live have the resources to purchase the\nsame drugs.\n8. Public enterprise means the factors of production (resources and businesses) are owned and operated by\nthe government.\n9. The United States is a large country economically speaking, so it has less need to trade internationally\nthan the other countries mentioned. (This is the same reason that France and Italy have lower ratios than\nBelgium or Sweden.) One additional reason is that each of the other countries is a member of the European\nUnion, where trade between members occurs without barriers to trade, like tariffs and quotas.\nChapter 2\n1. The opportunity cost of bus tickets is the number of burgers that must be given up to obtain one more bus\nticket. Originally, when the price of bus tickets was 50 cents per trip, this opportunity cost was 0.50/2 = .25\nburgers. The reason for this is that at the original prices, one burger ($2) costs the same as four bus tickets\n($0.50), so the opportunity cost of a burger is four bus tickets, and the opportunity cost of a bus ticket is .25\nburgers (the inverse of the opportunity cost of a burger). With the new, higher price of bus tickets, the\nopportunity cost rises to $1/$2 or 0.50 burgers. You can see this graphically since the slope of the new\nbudget constraint is steeper than the original one. If Alphonso spends all of his budget on burgers, the\nhigher price of bus tickets has no impact so the vertical intercept of the budget constraint is the same. If he\nspends his entire budget on bus tickets, he can now afford only half as many, so the horizontal intercept is\nhalf as much. In short, the budget constraint rotates clockwise around the vertical intercept, steepening as\nit goes and the opportunity cost of bus tickets increases. 902\n2. Because of the improvement in technology, the vertical intercept of the PPF would be at a higher level of\nhealthcare. In other words, the PPF would rotate clockwise around the horizontal intercept. This would\nmake the PPF steeper, corresponding to an increase in the opportunity cost of education, since resources\ndevoted to education would now mean forgoing a greater quantity of healthcare.\n3. No. Allocative efficiency requires productive efficiency, because it pertains to choices along the production\npossibilities frontier.\n4. Both the budget constraint and the PPF show the constraint that each operates under. Both show a tradeoff\nbetween having more of one good but less of the other. Both show the opportunity cost graphically as the\nslope of the constraint (budget or PPF).\n5. When individuals compare cost per unit in the grocery store, or characteristics of one product versus\nanother, they are behaving approximately like the model describes.\n6. Since an op-ed makes a case for what should be, it is considered normative.\n7. Assuming that the study is not taking an explicit position about whether soft drink consumption is good or\nbad, but just reporting the science, it would be considered positive.\nChapter 3\n1. Since $1.60 per gallon is above the equilibrium price, the quantity demanded would be lower at 550\ngallons and the quantity supplied would be higher at 640 gallons. (These results are due to the laws of\ndemand and supply, respectively.) The outcome of lower Qd and higher Qs would be a surplus in the\ngasoline market of 640 \u2013 550 = 90 gallons.\n2. To make it easier to analyze complex problems.Ceteris paribusallows you to look at the effect of one factor\nat a time on what it is you are trying to analyze. When you have analyzed all the factors individually, you\nadd the results together to get the final answer.\n3. a. An improvement in technology that reduces the cost of production will cause an increase in supply.\nAlternatively, you can think of this as a reduction in price necessary for firms to supply any quantity.\nEither way, this can be shown as a rightward (or downward) shift in the supply curve.\nb. An improvement in product quality is treated as an increase in tastes or preferences, meaning\nconsumers demand more paint at any price level, so demand increases or shifts to the right. If this\nseems counterintuitive, note that demand in the future for the longer-lasting paint will fall, since\nconsumers are essentially shifting demand from the future to the present.\nc. An increase in need causes an increase in demand or a rightward shift in the demand curve.\nd. Factory damage means that firms are unable to supply as much in the present. Technically, this is an\nincrease in the cost of production. Either way you look at it, the supply curve shifts to the left.\n4. a. More fuel-efficient cars means there is less need for gasoline. This causes a leftward shift in the\ndemand for gasoline and thus oil. Since the demand curve is shifting down the supply curve, the\nequilibrium price and quantity both fall.\nb. Cold weather increases the need for heating oil. This causes a rightward shift in the demand for\nheating oil and thus oil. Since the demand curve is shifting up the supply curve, the equilibrium price\nand quantity both rise.\nc. A discovery of new oil will make oil more abundant. This can be shown as a rightward shift in the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 903\nsupply curve, which will cause a decrease in the equilibrium price along with an increase in the\nequilibrium quantity. (The supply curve shifts down the demand curve so price and quantity follow\nthe law of demand. If price goes down, then the quantity goes up.)\nd. When an economy slows down, it produces less output and demands less input, including energy,\nwhich is used in the production of virtually everything. A decrease in demand for energy will be\nreflected as a decrease in the demand for oil, or a leftward shift in demand for oil. Since the demand\ncurve is shifting down the supply curve, both the equilibrium price and quantity of oil will fall.\ne. Disruption of oil pumping will reduce the supply of oil. This leftward shift in the supply curve will\nshow a movement up the demand curve, resulting in an increase in the equilibrium price of oil and a\ndecrease in the equilibrium quantity.\nf. Increased insulation will decrease the demand for heating. This leftward shift in the demand for oil\ncauses a movement down the supply curve, resulting in a decrease in the equilibrium price and\nquantity of oil.\ng. Solar energy is a substitute for oil-based energy. So if solar energy becomes cheaper, the demand for\noil will decrease as consumers switch from oil to solar. The decrease in demand for oil will be shown\nas a leftward shift in the demand curve. As the demand curve shifts down the supply curve, both\nequilibrium price and quantity for oil will fall.\nh. A new, popular kind of plastic will increase the demand for oil. The increase in demand will be shown\nas a rightward shift in demand, raising the equilibrium price and quantity of oil.\n5. Step 1. Draw the graph with the initial supply and demand curves. Label the initial equilibrium price and\nquantity.\nStep 2. Did the economic event affect supply or demand? Jet fuel is a cost of producing air travel, so an\nincrease in jet fuel price affects supply.\nStep 3. An increase in the price of jet fuel caused an increase in the cost of air travel. We show this as an\nupward or leftward shift in supply.\nStep 4. A leftward shift in supply causes a movement up the demand curve, increasing the equilibrium\nprice of air travel and decreasing the equilibrium quantity.\n6. Step 1. Draw the graph with the initial supply and demand curves. Label the initial equilibrium price and\nquantity.\nStep 2. Did the economic event affect supply or demand? A tariff is treated like a cost of production, so this\naffects supply.\nStep 3. A tariff reduction is equivalent to a decrease in the cost of production, which we can show as a\nrightward (or downward) shift in supply.\nStep 4. A rightward shift in supply causes a movement down the demand curve, lowering the equilibrium\nprice and raising the equilibrium quantity.\n7. A price ceiling (which is below the equilibrium price) will cause the quantity demanded to rise and the\nquantity supplied to fall. This is why a price ceiling creates a shortage.\n8. A price ceiling is just a legal restriction. Equilibrium is an economic condition. People may or may not\nobey the price ceiling, so the actual price may be at or above the price ceiling, but the price ceiling does not\nchange the equilibrium price.\n9. A price ceiling is a legal maximum price, but a price floor is a legal minimum price and, consequently, it\nwould leave room for the price to rise to its equilibrium level. In other words, a price floor below\nequilibrium will not be binding and will have no effect.\n10. Assuming that people obey the price ceiling, the market price will be below equilibrium, which means that\nQd will be more than Qs. Buyers can only buy what is offered for sale, so the number of transactions will\nfall to Qs. This is easy to see graphically. By analogous reasoning, with a price floor the market price will be\nabove the equilibrium price, so Qd will be less than Qs. Since the limit on transactions here is demand, the\nnumber of transactions will fall to Qd. Note that because both price floors and price ceilings reduce the\nnumber of transactions, social surplus is less. 904\n11. Because the losses to consumers are greater than the benefits to producers, so the net effect is negative.\nSince the lost consumer surplus is greater than the additional producer surplus, social surplus falls.\nChapter 4\n1. Changes in the wage rate (the price of labor) cause a movement along the demand curve. A change in\nanything else that affects demand for labor (e.g., changes in output, changes in the production process that\nuse more or less labor, government regulation) causes a shift in the demand curve.\n2. Changes in the wage rate (the price of labor) cause a movement along the supply curve. A change in\nanything else that affects supply of labor (e.g., changes in how desirable the job is perceived to be,\ngovernment policy to promote training in the field) causes a shift in the supply curve.\n3. Since a living wage is a suggested minimum wage, it acts like a price floor (assuming, of course, that it is\nfollowed). If the living wage is binding, it will cause an excess supply of labor at that wage rate.\n4. Changes in the interest rate (i.e., the price of financial capital) cause a movement along the demand curve.\nA change in anything else (non-price variable) that affects demand for financial capital (e.g., changes in\nconfidence about the future, changes in needs for borrowing) would shift the demand curve.\n5. Changes in the interest rate (i.e., the price of financial capital) cause a movement along the supply curve. A\nchange in anything else that affects the supply of financial capital (a non-price variable) such as income or\nfuture needs would shift the supply curve.\n6. If market interest rates stay in their normal range, an interest rate limit of 35% would not be binding. If the\nequilibrium interest rate rose above 35%, the interest rate would be capped at that rate, and the quantity of\nloans would be lower than the equilibrium quantity, causing a shortage of loans.\n7. b and c will lead to a fall in interest rates. At a lower demand, lenders will not be able to charge as much,\nand with more available lenders, competition for borrowers will drive rates down.\n8. a and c will increase the quantity of loans. More people who want to borrow will result in more loans being\ngiven, as will more people who want to lend.\n9. A price floor prevents a price from falling below a certain level, but has no effect on prices above that level. It\nwill have its biggest effect in creating excess supply (as measured by the entire area inside the dotted lines on\nthe graph, from D to S) if it is substantially above the equilibrium price. This is illustrated in the following\nfigure.\nIt will have a lesser effect if it is slightly above the equilibrium price. This is illustrated in the next figure.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 905\nIt will have no effect if it is set either slightly or substantially below the equilibrium price, since an equilibrium\nprice above a price floor will not be affected by that price floor. The following figure illustrates these situations.\n10. A price ceiling prevents a price from rising above a certain level, but has no effect on prices below that level. It\nwill have its biggest effect in creating excess demand if it is substantially below the equilibrium price. The\nfollowing figure illustrates these situations. 906\nWhen the price ceiling is set substantially or slightly above the equilibrium price, it will have no effect on\ncreating excess demand. The following figure illustrates these situations.\n11. Neither. A shift in demand or supply means that at every price, either a greater or a lower quantity is\ndemanded or supplied. A price floor does not shift a demand curve or a supply curve. However, if the price\nfloor is set above the equilibrium, it will cause the quantity supplied on the supply curve to be greater than\nthe quantity demanded on the demand curve, leading to excess supply.\n12. Neither. A shift in demand or supply means that at every price, either a greater or a lower quantity is\ndemanded or supplied. A price ceiling does not shift a demand curve or a supply curve. However, if the\nprice ceiling is set below the equilibrium, it will cause the quantity demanded on the demand curve to be\ngreater than the quantity supplied on the supply curve, leading to excess demand.\nChapter 5\n1. From point B to point C, price rises from $70 to $80, and Qd decreases from 2,800 to 2,600. So:\nAccess for free at openstax.org 907\nThe demand curve is inelastic in this area; that is, its elasticity value is less than one.\nAnswer from Point D to point E:\nThe demand curve is inelastic in this area; that is, its elasticity value is less than one.\nAnswer from Point G to point H:\nThe demand curve is elastic in this interval.\n2. From point J to point K, price rises from $8 to $9, and quantity rises from 50 to 70. So:\nThe supply curve is elastic in this area; that is, its elasticity value is greater than one.\nFrom point L to point M, the price rises from $10 to $11, while the Qs rises from 80 to 88: 908\nThe supply curve has unitary elasticity in this area.\nFrom point N to point P, the price rises from $12 to $13, and Qs rises from 95 to 100:\nThe supply curve is inelastic in this region of the supply curve.\n3. The demand curve with constant unitary elasticity is concave because the absolute value of declines in\nprice are not identical. The left side of the curve starts with high prices, and then price falls by smaller\namounts as it goes down toward the right side. This results in a slope of demand that is steeper on the left\nbut flatter on the right, creating a curved, concave shape.\n4. The constant unitary elasticity is a straight line because the curve slopes upward and both price and\nquantity are increasing proportionally.\n5. Carmakers can pass this cost along to consumers if the demand for these cars is inelastic. If the demand\nfor these cars is elastic, then the manufacturer must pay for the equipment.\n6. If the elasticity is 1.4 at current prices, you would advise the company to lower its price on the product,\nsince a decrease in price will be offset by the increase in the amount of the drug sold. If the elasticity were\n0.6, then you would advise the company to increase its price. Increases in price will offset the decrease in\nnumber of units sold, but increase your total revenue. If elasticity is 1, the total revenue is already\nmaximized, and you would advise that the company maintain its current price level.\n7. The percentage change in quantity supplied as a result of a given percentage change in the price of\ngasoline.\n8.\nIn this example, bread is an inferior good because its consumption falls as income rises.\n9. The formula for cross-price elasticity is % change in Qd for apples / % change in P of oranges. Multiplying\nAccess for free at openstax.org 909\nboth sides by % change in P of oranges yields:\n% change in Qd for apples = cross-price elasticity X% change in P of oranges\n= 0.4 \u00d7 (\u20133%) = \u20131.2%, or a 1.2 % decrease in demand for apples.\nChapter 6\n1. The rows of the table in the problem do not represent the actual choices available on the budget set; that is,\nthe combinations of round trips and phone minutes that Jeremy can afford with his budget. One of the\nchoices listed in the problem, the six round trips, is not even available on the budget set. If Jeremy has only\n$10 to spend and a round trip costs $2 and phone calls cost $0.05 per minute, he could spend his entire\nbudget on five round trips but no phone calls or 200 minutes of phone calls, but no round trips or any\ncombination of the two in between. It is easy to see all of his budget options with a little algebra. The\nequation for a budget line is:\nwhere P and Q are price and quantity of round trips ( ) and phone calls ( ) (per minute). In Jeremy\u2019s case\nRT PC\nthe equation for the budget line is:\nIf we choose zero through five round trips (column 1), the table below shows how many phone minutes can\nbe afforded with the budget (column 3). The total utility figures are given in the table below.\nRound Trips Total Utility for Trips Phone Minutes Total Utility for Minutes Total Utility\n0 0 200 1100 1100\n1 80 160 1040 1120\n2 150 120 900 1050\n3 210 80 680 890\n4 260 40 380 640\n5 300 0 0 300\nAdding up total utility for round trips and phone minutes at different points on the budget line gives total\nutility at each point on the budget line. The highest possible utility is at the combination of one trip and\n160 minutes of phone time, with a total utility of 1120.\n2. The first step is to use the total utility figures, shown in the table below, to calculate marginal utility,\nremembering that marginal utility is equal to the change in total utility divided by the change in trips or\nminutes.\nRound Total Marginal Utility (per Phone Total Marginal Utility (per\nTrips Utility trip) Minutes Utility minute)\n0 0 - 200 1100 -\n1 80 80 160 1040 60/40 = 1.5 910\nRound Total Marginal Utility (per Phone Total Marginal Utility (per\nTrips Utility trip) Minutes Utility minute)\n2 150 70 120 900 140/40 = 3.5\n3 210 60 80 680 220/40 = 5.5\n4 260 50 40 380 300/40 = 7.5\n5 300 40 0 0 380/40 = 9.5\nNote that we cannot directly compare marginal utilities, since the units are trips versus phone minutes.\nWe need a common denominator for comparison, which is price. Dividing MU by the price, yields columns\n4 and 8 in the table below.\nRound Total Marginal Utility Phone Total Marginal utility (per\nMU/P MU/P\nTrips Utility (per trip) Minutes Utility minute)\n1.5/$0.05\n0 0 - - 200 1100 60/40 = 1.5\n= 30\n80/$2 3.5/$0.05\n1 80 80 160 1040 140/40 = 3.5\n= 40 = 70\n70/$2 5.5/$0.05\n2 150 70 120 900 220/40 = 5.5\n= 35 = 110\n60/$2 7.5/$0.05\n3 210 60 80 680 300/40 =7.5\n= 30 = 150\n50/$2 9.5/$0.05\n4 260 50 40 380 380/40 = 9.5\n= 25 = 190\n40/$2\n5 300 40 0 0 - -\n= 20\nStart at the bottom of the table where the combination of round trips and phone minutes is (5, 0). This\nstarting point is arbitrary, but the numbers in this example work best starting from the bottom. Suppose\nwe consider moving to the next point up. At (4, 40), the marginal utility per dollar spent on a round trip is\n25. The marginal utility per dollar spent on phone minutes is 190.\nSince 25 < 190, we are getting much more utility per dollar spent on phone minutes, so let\u2019s choose more\nof those. At (3, 80), MU/P is 30 < 150 (the MU/ ), but notice that the difference is narrowing. We keep\nRT PM\ntrading round trips for phone minutes until we get to (1, 160), which is the best we can do. The MU/P\ncomparison is as close as it is going to get (40 vs. 70). Often in the real world, it is not possible to get MU/P\nexactly equal for both products, so you get as close as you can.\n3. This is the opposite of the example explained in the text. A decrease in price has a substitution effect and\nan income effect. The substitution effect says that because the product is cheaper relative to other things\nthe consumer purchases, the consumer will tend to buy more of the product (and less of the other things).\nThe income effect says that after the price decline, the consumer could purchase the same goods as before,\nand still have money left over to purchase more. For both reasons, a decrease in price causes an increase\nin quantity demanded.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 911\n4. This is a negative income effect. Because your parents\u2019 check failed to arrive, your monthly income is less\nthan normal and your budget constraint shifts in toward the origin. If you only buy normal goods, the\ndecrease in your income means you will buy less of every product.\nChapter 7\n1. Accounting profit = total revenues minus explicit costs = $1,000,000 \u2013 ($600,000 + $150,000 + $200,000) =\n$50,000.\n2. Economic profit = accounting profit minus implicit cost = $50,000 \u2013 $30,000 = $20,000.\n3.\nVariable Fixed Total Average Variable Average Total Marginal\nQuantity\nCost Cost Cost Cost Cost Cost\n0 0 $30 $30 - -\n1 $10 $30 $40 $10.00 $40.00 $10\n2 $25 $30 $55 $12.50 $27.50 $15\n3 $45 $30 $75 $15.00 $25.00 $20\n4 $70 $30 $100 $17.50 $25.00 $25\n5 $100 $30 $130 $20.00 $26.00 $30\n6 $135 $30 $165 $22.50 $27.50 $35\n4. a. Total revenues in this example will be a quantity of five units multiplied by the price of $25/unit,\nwhich equals $125. Total costs when producing five units are $130. Thus, at this level of quantity and\noutput the firm experiences losses (or negative profits) of $5.\nb. If price is less than average cost, the firm is not making a profit. At an output of five units, the average\ncost is $26/unit. Thus, at a glance you can see the firm is making losses. At a second glance, you can\nsee that it must be losing $1 for each unit produced (that is, average cost of $26/unit minus the price of\n$25/unit). With five units produced, this observation implies total losses of $5.\nc. When producing five units, marginal costs are $30/unit. Price is $25/unit. Thus, the marginal unit is\nnot adding to profits, but is actually subtracting from profits, which suggests that the firm should\nreduce its quantity produced.\n5. The marginal product of the third painter is 75 square feet.\n6. The new table should look like this: 912\nLabor Cost Machine Cost Total Cost\nCost of technology 1 10 \u00d7 $40 = $400 2 \u00d7 $50 = $100 $500\nCost of technology 2 7 \u00d7 $40 = $280 4 \u00d7 $50 = $200 $480\nCost of technology 3 3 \u00d7 $40 = $120 7 \u00d7 $50 = $350 $470\nThe firm should choose production technology 3 since it has the lowest total cost. This makes sense since,\nwith cheaper machine hours, one would expect a shift in the direction of more machines and less labor.\n7.\nLabor Cost Machine Cost Total Cost\nCost of technology 1 10 \u00d7 $40 = $400 2 \u00d7 $55 = $110 $510\nCost of technology 2 7 \u00d7 $40 = $280 4 \u00d7 $55 = $220 $500\nCost of technology 3 3 \u00d7 $40 = $120 7 \u00d7 $55 = $385 $505\nThe firm should choose production technology 2 since it has the lowest total cost. Because the cost of\nmachines increased (relative to the previous question), you would expect a shift toward less capital and\nmore labor.\n8. This is the situation that existed in the United States in the 1970s. Since there is only demand enough for\n2.5 firms to reach the bottom of the average cost curve, you would expect one firm will not be around in the\nlong run, and at least one firm will be struggling.\nChapter 8\n1. No, you would not raise the price. Your product is exactly the same as the product of the many other firms\nin the market. If your price is greater than that of your competitors, then your customers would switch to\nthem and stop buying from you. You would lose all your sales.\n2. Possibly. Independent truckers are by definition small and numerous. All that is required to get into the\nbusiness is a truck (not an inexpensive asset, though) and a commercial driver\u2019s license. To exit, one need\nonly sell the truck. All trucks are essentially the same, providing transportation from point A to point B.\n(We\u2019re assuming we not talking about specialized trucks.) Independent truckers must take the going rate\nfor their service, so independent trucking does seem to have most of the characteristics of perfect\ncompetition.\n3. Holding total cost constant, profits at every output level would increase.\n4. When the market price increases, marginal revenue increases. The firm would then increase production\nup to the point where the new price equals marginal cost, at a quantity of 90.\n5. If marginal costs exceeds marginal revenue, then the firm will reduce its profits for every additional unit of\noutput it produces. Profit would be greatest if it reduces output to where MR = MC.\n6. The firm will be willing to supply fewer units at every price level. In other words, the firm\u2019s individual\nsupply curve decreases and shifts to the left.\n7. With a technological improvement that brings about a reduction in costs of production, an adjustment\nprocess will take place in the market. The technological improvement will result in an increase in supply\ncurves, by individual firms and at the market level. The existing firms will experience higher profits for a\nwhile, which will attract other firms into the market. This entry process will stop whenever the market\nsupply increases enough (both by existing and new firms) so profits are driven back to zero.\n8. When wages increase, costs of production increase. Some firms would now be making economic losses\nand would shut down. The supply curve then starts shifting to the left, pushing the market price up. This\nAccess for free at openstax.org 913\nprocess ends when all firms remaining in the market earn zero economic profits. The result is a\ncontraction in the output produced in the market.\n9. Perfect competition is considered to be \u201cperfect\u201d because both allocative and productive efficiency are met\nat the same time in a long-run equilibrium. If a market structure results in long-run equilibrium that does\nnot minimize average total costs and/or does not charge a price equal to marginal cost, then either\nallocative or productive (or both) efficiencies are not met, and therefore the market cannot be labeled\n\u201cperfect.\u201d\n10. Think of the market price as representing the gain to society from a purchase, since it represents what\nsomeone is willing to pay. Think of the marginal cost as representing the cost to society from making the\nlast unit of a good. If P > MC, then the benefits from producing more of a good exceed the costs, and society\nwould gain from producing more of the good. If P < MC, then the social costs of producing the marginal\ngood exceed the social benefits, and society should produce less of the good. Only if P = MC, the rule\napplied by a profit-maximizing perfectly competitive firm, will society\u2019s costs and benefits be in balance.\nThis choice will be the option that brings the greatest overall benefit to society.\nChapter 9\n1. a.

Trademarks are enforced by government, and therefore are a barrier to entry.\nd. This is probably not a barrier to entry, since there are a number of different ways of getting pure water.\ne. This is a barrier to entry, but it is not government-enforced.\n3. Because of economies of scale, each firm would produce at a higher average cost than before. (They would\neach have to build their own power lines.) As a result, they would each have to raise prices to cover their\nhigher costs. The policy would fail.\n4. Shorter patent protection would make innovation less lucrative, so the amount of research and\ndevelopment would likely decline.\n5. If price falls below AVC, the firm will not be able to earn enough revenues even to cover its variable costs. In\nsuch a case, it will suffer a smaller loss if it shuts down and produces no output. By contrast, if it stayed in\noperation and produced the level of output where MR = MC, it would lose all of its fixed costs plus some\nvariable costs. If it shuts down, it only loses its fixed costs.\n6. This scenario is called \u201cperfect price discrimination.\u201d The result would be that the monopolist would\nproduce more output, the same amount in fact as would be produced by a perfectly competitive industry.\nHowever, there would be no consumer surplus since each buyer is paying exactly what they think the\nproduct is worth. Therefore, the monopolist would be earning the maximum possible profits.\nChapter 10\n1. An increase in demand will manifest itself as a rightward shift in the demand curve, and a rightward shift\nin marginal revenue. The shift in marginal revenue will cause a movement up the marginal cost curve to\nthe new intersection between MR and MC at a higher level of output. The new price can be read by drawing\na line up from the new output level to the new demand curve, and then over to the vertical axis. The new\nprice should be higher. The increase in quantity will cause a movement along the average cost curve to a\npossibly higher level of average cost. The price, though, will increase more, causing an increase in total 914\nprofits.\n2. As long as the original firm is earning positive economic profits, other firms will respond in ways that take\naway the original firm\u2019s profits. This will manifest itself as a decrease in demand for the original firm\u2019s\nproduct, a decrease in the firm\u2019s profit-maximizing price and a decrease in the firm\u2019s profit-maximizing\nlevel of output, essentially unwinding the process described in the answer to question 1. In the long-run\nequilibrium, all firms in monopolistically competitive markets will earn zero economic profits.\n3. a. If the firms form a cartel, they will act like a monopoly, choosing the quantity of output where MR =\nMC. Drawing a line from the monopoly quantity up to the demand curve shows the monopoly price.\nAssuming that fixed costs are zero, and with an understanding of cost and profit, we can infer that\nwhen the marginal cost curve is horizontal, average cost is the same as marginal cost. Thus, the cartel\nwill earn positive economic profits equal to the area of the rectangle, with a base equal to the\nmonopoly quantity and a height equal to the difference between price (on the demand above the\nmonopoly quantity) and average cost, as shown in the following figure.\nb. The firms will expand output and cut price as long as there are profits remaining. The long-run\nequilibrium will occur at the point where average cost equals demand. As a result, the oligopoly will\nearn zero economic profits due to \u201ccutthroat competition,\u201d as shown in the next figure.\nc. Pc > Pcc. Qc < Qcc. Profit for the cartel is positive and large. Profit for cutthroat competition is zero.\n4. Firm B reasons that if it cheats and Firm A does not notice, it will double its money. Since Firm A\u2019s profits\nwill decline substantially, however, it is likely that Firm A will notice and if so, Firm A will cheat also, with\nthe result that Firm B will lose 90% of what it gained by cheating. Firm A will reason that Firm B is unlikely\nto risk cheating. If neither firm cheats, Firm A earns $1000. If Firm A cheats, assuming Firm B does not\ncheat, A can boost its profits only a little, since Firm B is so small. If both firms cheat, then Firm A loses at\nleast 50% of what it could have earned. The possibility of a small gain ($50) is probably not enough to\nAccess for free at openstax.org 915\ninduce Firm A to cheat, so in this case it is likely that both firms will collude.\nChapter 11\n1. Yes, it is true. The HHI example is easy enough: since the market shares of all firms are included in the HHI\ncalculation, a merger between two of the firms will change the HHI. For the four-firm concentration ratio, it\nis quite possible that a merger between, say, the fifth and sixth largest firms in the market could create a\nnew firm that is then ranked in the top four in the market. In this case, a merger of two firms, neither in the\ntop four, would still change the four-firm concentration ratio.\n2. No, it is not true. The HHI includes the market shares of all firms in its calculation, but the squaring of the\nmarket shares has the effect of making the impact of the largest firms relatively bigger than in the 4-firm\nor 8-firm ratio.\n3. The bus companies wanted the broader market definition (i.e., the second definition). If the narrow\ndefinition had been used, the combined bus companies would have had a near-monopoly on the market\nfor intercity bus service. But they had only a sliver of the market for intercity transportation when\neverything else was included. The merger was allowed.\n4. The common expectation is that the definition of markets will become broader because of greater\ncompetition from faraway places. However, this broadening doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that antitrust\nauthorities can relax. There is also a fear that companies with a local or national monopoly may use the\nnew opportunities to extend their reach across national borders, and that it will be difficult for national\nauthorities to respond.\n5. Because outright collusion to raise profits is illegal and because existing regulations include gray areas\nwhich firms may be able to exploit.\n6. Yes, all curves have normal shapes.\n7. Yes it is a natural monopoly because average costs decline over the range that satisfies the market\ndemand. For example, at the point where the demand curve and the average cost curve meet, there are\neconomies of scale.\n8.

The original equilibrium (before the external social cost of pollution is taken into account) is where the\nprivate supply curve crosses the demand curve. This original equilibrium is at a price of $15 and a\nquantity of 440. After taking into account the additional external cost of pollution, the production becomes\nmore costly, and the supply curve shifts up. The new equilibrium will be at a price of $30 and a quantity of\n410.\n5.

Even though state or local governments impose these taxes, a company has the flexibility to adopt\ntechnologies that will help it avoid the tax.\n8. First, if each firm is required to reduce its garbage output by one-fourth, then Elm will reduce five tons at a\ncost of $5,500; Maple will reduce 10 tons at a cost of $13,500; Oak will reduce three tons at a cost of\n$22,500; and Cherry will reduce four tons at a cost of $18,000. Total cost of this approach: $59,500. If the\nsystem of marketable permits is put in place, and those permits shrink the weight of allowable garbage by\none-quarter, then pollution must still be reduced by the same overall amount. However, now the reduction\nin pollution will take place where it is least expensive.\nReductions in Garbage Who does the reducing?

At what cost?\nEighth 5 tons Elm $6,500\nNinth and tenth 5 tons Elm and Cherry $7,000 each\nThus, the overall pattern of reductions here will be that Elm reduces garbage by 20 tons and has 15 tons of\npermits to sell. Maple reduces by five tons and needs to buy five tons of permits. Oak does not reduce\ngarbage at all, and needs to buy 15 tons of permits. Cherry reduces garbage by 25 tons, which leaves it with\nfive tons of permits to sell. The total cost of these reductions would be $56,300, a definite reduction in\ncosts from the $59,500 cost of the command-and-control option.\n9.\nFlexibility about Where and How Political Process Creates\nIncentives to Go Beyond\nPollution Will Be Reduced Loopholes and Exceptions\nIf you keep reducing If charge applies to all\nPollution Reducing pollution by any method\npollution you reduce your emissions of pollution then\nCharges is fine\ncharge no loopholes\nReductions of pollution will\nIf you reduce your If all polluters are required\nMarketable happen at firms where it is\npollution you can sell your to have permits then there\nPermits cheapest to do so, by the least\nextra pollution permits are no loopholes\nexpensive methods\nThe party that has to pay If the property rights are\nProperty for the pollution has Reducing pollution by any method clearly defined, then it is not\nRights incentive to do so in a cost is fine legally possible to avoid\neffect way cleanup\n10. a.

The \u201coptimal\u201d level of pollution is where the marginal benefits of reducing it are equal to the marginal\ncost. This is at four million gallons. 918\nc. Marginal analysis tells us if the marginal costs of cleanup are greater than the marginal benefit,\nsociety could use those resources more efficiently elsewhere in the economy.\n11. a. See the next table for the answers, which were calculated using the traditional calculation of marginal\ncost equal to change in total cost divided by change in quantity.\nLand Restored (in acres) Total Cost [marginal cost] Total Benefit [marginal benefit]\n0 $0 $0\n100 $20 [0.2] $140 [1.4]\n200 $80 [0.6] $240 [1]\n300 $160 [0.8] $320 [0.8]\n400 $280 [1.2] $480 [0.6]\nb.

If A is not protecting the environment,\nwe will have losses of 2 if we protect, but have zero if we do not protect, so again, we will not protect it.\nCountry A will reason in a similar manner. The result is that both countries choose to not protect, even\nthough they will achieve the largest social benefits\u2014a combined benefit of 12 for the two countries\u2014if they\nboth choose to protect. Environmental treaties can be viewed as a way for countries to try to extricate\nthemselves from this situation.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 919\n13. a.\nb. Of the choices provided, P, R, and S demonstrate productive efficiency. These are the choices on the\nproduction possibility frontier.\nc. Allocative efficiency is determined by the preferences\u2014in this case by the preferences of society as\nexpressed through government and other social institutions. Because you do not have information\nabout these preferences, you really cannot say much about allocative efficiency.\nd. In the choice between T and R, R should clearly be preferred, because it has both more corn and more\ntrees. This answer illustrates why productive efficiency is beneficial. Compared with choices inside\nthe PPF, it means more of one or both goods.\ne. In the choice between T and S, it is not possible to say which choice is better. True, S is on the PPF and\nT is not\u2014but that only addresses the issue of productive efficiency. If a society has a strong preference\nfor economic output and places a lower value on trees, then allocative efficiency may lead to a choice\nof T over S. Of course, the reverse could also be true, leading to a choice of S. Without information on\nsociety\u2019s preferences to judge allocative efficiency, this question cannot be answered.\nf. Compared with command-and-control policies, market-oriented policies allow either more output\nwith the same environmental protection or more environmental protection with the same level of\noutput\u2014or more of both environmental protection and output. Thus, a choice like Q inside the PPF is\nmore likely to represent a command-and-control policy demand than a choice like S on the frontier of\nthe PPF.\nChapter 13\n1. No. A market demand curve reflects only the private benefits of those who are consuming the product.\nPositive externalities are benefits that spill over to third parties, so they create social benefits, and are not\ncaptured by a market (or private benefit) demand curve.\n2. Clearly Samsung is benefiting from the investment, so the 20% increase in profits is a private benefit. If\nSamsung is unable to capture all of the benefit, perhaps because other companies quickly copy and\nproduce close substitutes, then Samsung\u2019s investment will produce social benefits.\n3. a. $102 million.\nb. If the interest rate is 9%, the cost of financial capital, and the firm can capture the 5% return to society,\nthe firm would invest as if its effective rate of return is 4%, so it will invest $183 million.\n4. When the Junkbuyers Company purchases something for resale, presumably both the buyer and the seller\nbenefit\u2014otherwise, they would not need to make the transaction. However, the company also reduces the\namount of garbage produced, which saves money for households and/or for the city that disposes of\ngarbage. So the social benefits are larger than the private benefits. 920\n5. Government programs that either pay for neighborhood clean-up directly or that provide reduced tax\npayments for those who clean up or fix up their own property could be enacted. It is also easy to imagine\nhow a city might allow its businesses to form a group that would pay for and manage neighborhood\ncleanup.\n6. Government programs that either pay for education directly or that provide loans or reduced tax payments\nfor education could create positive spillovers. A city might allow its businesses to form a group that would\ncoordinate business efforts with schools and local colleges and universities\u2014allowing students to obtain\nreal-world experience in their chosen fields and providing businesses with enthusiastic, trained workers.\n7. a.

It is difficult for two people to simultaneously eat an ice cream cone, so it is rivalrous in consumption.\nChapter 14\n1. a. For a firm operating in a perfectly competitive output market, the value of the marginal product is the\nmarginal product of labor multiplied by the firm\u2019s output price.\nb. In a perfectly competitive labor market where the going market wage is $12, a profit-maximizing firm\nwill hire workers up to the point where the market wage equals the marginal revenue product. In this\ncase, the market wage equals the marginal revenue product when the labor is 5 because at that level,\nthe marginal revenue product is $12.\n2. a. For firms with some market power in their output market, like a monopoly, the value of additional\noutput sold is the firm\u2019s marginal revenue, not the price. This is because they face a downward sloping\ndemand curve for output, which means that in order to sell additional output, the firm must lower its\nprice. The marginal revenue product equals the marginal product of labor multiplied by the marginal\nrevenue.\nb. A profit-maximizing firm will hire workers up to the point where the market wage equals the marginal\nrevenue product. If the going market wage is $20, in this scenario, the profit-maximizing level of\nemployment is 4 because at that point, the marginal revenue product is $20.\n3. a. With no union, the equilibrium wage rate would be $18 per hour and there would be 8,000 bus drivers.\nb. If the union has enough negotiating power to raise the wage to $4 per hour higher than under the\noriginal equilibrium, the new wage would be $22 per hour. At this wage, 4,000 workers would be\ndemanded while 10,000 would be supplied, leading to an excess supply of 6,000 workers.\n4. Unions have sometimes opposed new technology out of a fear of losing jobs, but in other cases unions have\nhelped to facilitate the introduction of new technology because unionized workers felt that the union was\nlooking after their interests or that their higher skills meant that their jobs were essentially protected. And\nthe new technologies meant increased productivity.\n5. In a few other countries (such as France and Spain), the percentage of workers belonging to a union is\nsimilar to that in the United States. Union membership rates, however, are generally lower in the United\nStates. When the share of workers whose wages are determined by union negotiations is considered, the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 921\nUnited States ranks by far the lowest (because in countries like France and Spain, union negotiations often\ndetermine pay even for nonunion employees).\n6. No. While some unions may cause firms to go bankrupt, other unions help firms to become more\ncompetitive. No overall pattern exists.\n7. From a social point of view, the benefits of unions and the costs seem to counterbalance. There is no\nevidence that in countries with a higher percentage of unionized workers, the economies grow more or\nless slowly.\n8. a. The marginal cost of labor is the cost to the firm of hiring one more worker. To find the marginal cost\nof labor, one must divide the change in wage by the change in labor.\nb. Because the monopsonist is the sole employer in the labor market, it can offer any wage that it wishes.\nHowever, the marginal cost of labor will be greater than the wage for any number of workers more\nthan one because hiring more than one worker requires paying a higher wage rate for both the new\nworker and all previous hires. A monopsony will hire workers up to the point where its demand for\nlabor equals the marginal cost of additional labor.\n9. a. Firms have a profit incentive to sell to everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, or gender.\nb. A business that needs to hire workers to expand may also find that if it draws only from its accustomed\npool of workers\u2014say, White men\u2014it lacks the workers it needs to expand production. Such a business\nwould have an incentive to hire more women and minorities.\nc. A discriminatory business that is underpaying its workers may find those workers leaving for jobs\nwith another employer who offers better pay. This market pressure could cause the discriminatory\nbusiness to behave better.\n10. No. The earnings gap does not prove discrimination because it does not compare the wages of men and\nwomen in the same job who have the same amounts of education, experience, and productivity.\n11. If a large share of immigrants have relatively low skills, then reducing the number of immigrants would\nshift the supply curve of low-skill labor back to the left, which would tend to raise the equilibrium wage for\nlow-skill labor.\nChapter 15\n1. a. Poverty falls, inequality rises.\nb. Poverty rises, inequality falls.\n2. Jonathon\u2019s options for working and total income are shown in the following table. His labor-leisure\ndiagram is shown in the figure following the table.\nNumber of Work Hours Earnings from Work Government Benefits Total Income\n1,500 $9,000 $1,000 $10,000\n1,200 $7,200 $2,800 $10,000\n900 $5,400 $4,600 $10,000\n600 $3,600 $6,400 $10,000\n300 $1,800 $8,200 $10,000\n0 $0 $10,000 $10,000 922\n3.

Jonathon\u2019s labor-leisure diagram is shown in the figure following the table.\n\u201cOpportunity set after program\u201d extends from (0, $16,300) to (1,500, $10,000). \u201cOpportunity set before\nprogram\u201d slopes downward from (0, $9,000) to (1,500, $0).\nNumber of Work HoursEarnings from WorkGovernment BenefitsTotal Income\n1,500 $9,000 $7,300 $16,300\n1,200 $7,200 $7,840 $15,040\n900 $5,400 $8,380 $13,780\n600 $3,600 $8,920 $12,520\n300 $1,800 $9,460 $22,260\n0 $0 $10,000 $10,000\n4. The earned income tax credit works like this: a family receives a tax break that increases according to how\nmuch they work. Families that work more get more. In that sense it loosens the poverty trap by\nencouraging work. As families earn above the poverty level, the earned income tax credit is gradually\nreduced. For those near-poor families, the earned income tax credit is a partial disincentive to work.\n5. TANF attempts to loosen the poverty trap by providing incentives to work in other ways. Specifically, it\nrequires that people work (or complete their education) as a condition of receiving TANF benefits, and it\nplaces a time limit on benefits.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 923\n6. A useful first step is to rank the households by income, from lowest to highest. Then, since there are 10\nhouseholds total, the bottom quintile will be the bottom two households, the second quintile will be the\nthird and fourth households, and so on up to the top quintile. The quintiles and percentage of total income\nfor the data provided are shown in the following table. Comparing this distribution to the U.S. income\ndistribution for 2005, the top quintile in the example has a smaller share of total income than in the U.S.\ndistribution and the bottom quintile has a larger share. This pattern usually means that the income\ndistribution in the example is more equal than the U.S. distribution.\nIncome Quintile % of Total Income\n$10,000\nTotal first quintile income: $22,000 6.0%\n$12,000\n$16,000\nTotal second quintile income: $34,000 9.2%\n$18,000\n$24,000\nTotal third quintile income: $48,000 13.0%\n$24,000\n$36,000\nTotal fourth quintile income: $86,000 23.2%\n$50,000\n$80,000\nTotal top quintile income: $180,000 48.6%\n$100,000\n$370,000 Total Income\n7. Just from glancing at the quintile information, it is fairly obvious that income inequality increased in the\nUnited Kingdom over this time: The top quintile is getting a lot more, and the lowest quintile is getting a bit\nless. Converting this information into a Lorenz curve, however, is a little trickier, because the Lorenz curve\ngraphs the cumulative distribution, not the amount received by individual quintiles. Thus, as explained in\nthe text, you have to add up the individual quintile data to convert the data to this form. The following table\nshows the actual calculations for the share of income in 1979 versus 1991. The figure following the table\nshows the perfect equality line and the Lorenz curves for 1979 and 1991. As shown, the income\ndistribution in 1979 was closer to the perfect equality line than the income distribution in 1991\u2014that is,\nthe United Kingdom income distribution became more unequal over time.\nShare of income received 1979 1991\nBottom 20% 7.0% 6.6%\nBottom 40% 18.5% 18.1%\nBottom 60% 35.5% 34.4%\nBottom 80% 60.3% 57.1%\nAll 100% 100.0% 100.0% 924\n8. In the market for low-wage labor, information technology shifts the demand for low-wage labor to the left. One\nreason is that technology can often substitute for low-wage labor in certain kinds of telephone or bookkeeping\njobs. In addition, information technology makes it easier for companies to manage connections with low-wage\nworkers in other countries, thus reducing the demand for low-wage workers in the United States. In the market\nfor high-wage labor, information technology shifts the demand for high-wage labor to the right. By using the\nnew information and communications technologies, high-wage labor can become more productive and can\noversee more tasks than before. The following figure illustrates these two labor markets. The combination of\nlower wages for low-wage labor and higher wages for high-wage labor means greater inequality.\n9. In the market for low-wage labor, a skills program will shift supply to the left, which will tend to drive up wages\nfor the remaining low-skill workers. In the market for high-wage labor, a skills program will shift supply to the\nright (because after the training program there are now more high-skilled workers at every wage), which will\ntend to drive down wages for high-skill workers. The combination of these two programs will result in a lesser\ndegree of inequality. The following figure illustrates these two labor markets. In the market for high-wage labor,\na skills program will shift supply to the right, which will tend to drive down wages for high-skill workers.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 925\n10. A very strong push for economic equality might include extremely high taxes on high-wage earners to pay\nfor extremely large government social payments for people with much lower incomes. Such a policy could\nlimit incentives for the high-wage workers, lock the poor into a poverty trap, and thus reduce output. The\nPPF in this case will have the standard appearance: it will be downward sloping.\n11. For the second hypothesis, a well-funded social safety net might make people feel that even if their\ncompany goes bankrupt or they need to change jobs or industries, they will have some degree of\nprotection. As a result, people may be more willing to allow markets to work without interference, and not\nto lobby as hard for rules that would prevent layoffs, set price controls, or block foreign trade. In this case,\nsafety net programs that increase equality could also allow the market to work more freely in a way that\ncould increase output. In this case, at least some portion of the PPF between equality and economic output\nwould slope up.\n12. Pure redistribution is more likely to cause a sharp tradeoff between economic output and equality than\npolicies aimed at the ladder of opportunity. A production possibility frontier showing a strict tradeoff\nbetween economic output and equality will be downward sloping. A PPF showing that it is possible to\nincrease equality, at least to some extent, while either increasing output or at least not diminishing it\nwould have a PPF that first rises, perhaps has a flat area, and then falls.\n13. Many view the redistribution of income to achieve greater equality as taking away from the rich to pay the\npoor, or as a \u201czero sum\u201d game. By taking taxes from one group of people and redistributing them to\nanother, the tax system is robbing some of the American Dream.\nChapter 16\n1. a. Imperfect information is relatively low; after all, you can see the apples.\nb. Imperfect information is relatively low. The neighborhood restaurant probably has a certain local\nreputation.\nc. Imperfect information is relatively high. How can you tell whether the computer is really in good\nworking order? Why are they selling it?\nd. Imperfect information is relatively high. What do those flowers really look like?\n2. Asymmetric information often exists in the labor market because employers cannot observe many key\nemployee attributes until after the person is hired. Employees, however, know whether they are energetic\nor detailed-oriented. Employers, therefore, often seek schools to pre-screen candidates. Employers may\nnot even interview a candidate unless he has a degree and often a degree from a particular school.\nEmployers may also view awards, a high grade point average, and other accolades as a signal of hard work,\nperseverance, and ability. Finally, employers seek references for insights into key attributes such as\nenergy level, work ethic, and so on. 926\n3. It is almost impossible to distinguish whether a health outcome such as life expectancy was the result of\npersonal preferences that might affect health and longevity, such as diet, exercise, certain risky behavior,\nand consumption of certain items like tobacco, or the result of expenditures on health care (for example,\nannual check-ups).\nChapter 17\n1. a. The management of small companies might rather do an IPO right away, but until they get the\ncompany up and running, most people would not pay very much for the stock because of the risks\ninvolved.\nb. A small company may be earning few or zero profits, and its owners want to reinvest their earnings in\nthe future growth of the company. If this company issues bonds or borrows money, it is obligated to\nmake interest payments, which can eat up the company\u2019s cash. If the company issues stock, it is not\nobligated to make payments to anyone (although it may choose to pay dividends).\nc. Venture capitalists are private investors who can keep close tabs on the management and strategy of\nthe company\u2014and thus reduce the problems of imperfect information about whether the firm is being\nwell run. Venture capitalists often own a substantial portion of the firm and have much better\ninformation than a typical shareholder would.\n2. From a firm\u2019s point of view, a bond is very similar to a bank loan. Both are ways of borrowing money. Both\nrequire paying interest. The major difference is who must be persuaded to lend money: a bank loan\nrequires persuading the bank, while issuing bonds requires persuading a number of separate\nbondholders. Since a bank often knows a great deal about a firm (especially if the firm has its accounts\nwith that bank), bank loans are more common where imperfect information would otherwise be a\nproblem.\n3. a. Remember, equity is the market value of the house minus what is still owed to the bank. Thus: the\nvalue of the house is $200,000, Fred owes $180,000 to the bank, and his equity is $20,000.\nb. The value of Freda\u2019s house is $250,000. It does not matter what price she bought it for. She owes zero\nto the bank, so her equity is the whole $250,000.\nc. The value of Frank\u2019s house is $160,000. He owes $60,000 to the bank (the original $80,000 minus the\n$20,000 he has paid off the loan). His equity is $100,000.\n4. Over a sustained period of time, stocks have an average return higher than bonds, and bonds have an\naverage return higher than a savings account. This is because in any given year the value of a savings\naccount changes very little. In contrast, stock values can grow or decline by a very large amount (for\nexample, the S&P 500 increased 26% in 2009 after declining 37% in 2008. The value of a bond, which\ndepends largely on interest rate fluctuations, varies far less than a stock, but more than a savings account.\n5. When people believe that a high-risk investment must have a low return, they are getting confused\nbetween what risk and return mean. Yes, a high-risk investment might have a low return, but it might also\nhave a high return. Risk refers to the fact that a wide range of outcomes is possible. However, a high-risk\ninvestment must, on average, expect a relatively high return or else no one would be willing to take the\nrisk. Thus, it is quite possible\u2014even likely\u2014for an investment to have high risk and high return. Indeed,\nthe reason that an investment has a high expected return is that it also has a high risk.\n6.

Domestic cotton producers would lobby heavily to protect themselves from the competition, whereas the\nconsumers have little incentive to organize.\n5. True. This is exactly what occurs in a voting cycle. That is, the majority can prefer policy A to policy B,\npolicy B to policy C, but also prefer policy C to policy A. Then, the majority will never reach a conclusive\noutcome.\n6. The problem is an example of a voting cycle. The group will vote for mountain biking over canoeing by\n2\u20131. It will vote for canoeing over the beach by 2\u20131. If mountain biking is preferred to canoeing and\ncanoeing is preferred to the beach, it might seem that it must be true that mountain biking is the favorite.\nBut in a vote of the beach versus mountain biking, the beach wins by a 2\u20131 vote. When a voting cycle\noccurs, choosing a single favorite that is always preferred by a majority becomes impossible.\n7.

GDP = $2,000 billion + $50 billion + $1,000 billion + ($20 billion \u2013 $40 billion) =\n$3,030\n2. a. Hospital stays are part of GDP.\nb. Changes in life expectancy are not market transactions and not part of GDP.\nc. Child care that is paid for is part of GDP.\nd. If Grandma gets paid and reports this as income, it is part of GDP, otherwise not.\ne. A used car is not produced this year, so it is not part of GDP.\nf. A new car is part of GDP.\ng. Variety does not count in GDP, where the cheese could all be cheddar.\nh. The iron is not counted because it is an intermediate good.\n3. From 1980 to 1990, real GDP grew by (8,225.0 \u2013 5,926.5) / (5,926.5) = 39%. Over the same period, prices\nincreased by (72.7 \u2013 48.3) / (48.3/100) = 51%. So about 57% of the growth 51 / (51 + 39) was inflation, and\nthe remainder: 39 / (51 + 39) = 43% was growth in real GDP.\n4. Two other major recessions are visible in the figure as slight dips: those of 1973\u20131975, and 1981\u20131982.\nTwo other recessions appear in the figure as a flattening of the path of real GDP. These were in 1990\u20131991\nand 2001.\n5. 11 recessions in approximately 70 years averages about one recession every six years.\n6. The table lists the \u201cMonths of Contraction\u201d for each recession. Averaging these figures for the post-WWII\nrecessions gives an average duration of 11 months, or slightly less than a year.\n7. The table lists the \u201cMonths of Expansion.\u201d Averaging these figures for the post-WWII expansions gives an\naverage expansion of 60.5 months, or more than five years.\n8. Yes. The answer to both questions depends on whether GDP is growing faster or slower than population. If\npopulation grows faster than GDP, GDP increases, while GDP per capita decreases. If GDP falls, but\npopulation falls faster, then GDP decreases, while GDP per capita increases.\n9. Start with Central African Republic\u2019s GDP measured in francs. Divide it by the exchange rate to convert to\nU.S. dollars, and then divide by population to obtain the per capita figure. That is, 1,107,689 million francs\n/ 284.681 francs per dollar / 4.862 million people = $800.28 GDP per capita.\n10. a. A dirtier environment would reduce the broad standard of living, but not be counted in GDP, so a rise\nin GDP would overstate the standard of living.\nb. A lower crime rate would raise the broad standard of living, but not be counted directly in GDP, and so 928\na rise in GDP would understate the standard of living.\nc. A greater variety of goods would raise the broad standard of living, but not be counted directly in GDP,\nand so a rise in GDP would understate the rise in the standard of living.\nd. A decline in infant mortality would raise the broad standard of living, but not be counted directly in\nGDP, and so a rise in GDP would understate the rise in the standard of living.\nChapter 20\n1. The Industrial Revolution refers to the widespread use of power-driven machinery and the economic and\nsocial changes that resulted in the first half of the 1800s. Ingenious machines\u2014the steam engine, the\npower loom, and the steam locomotive\u2014performed tasks that would have taken vast numbers of workers\nto do. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain, and soon spread to the United States, Germany,\nand other countries.\n2. Property rights are the rights of individuals and firms to own property and use it as they see fit.\nContractual rights are based on property rights and they allow individuals to enter into agreements with\nothers regarding the use of their property providing recourse through the legal system in the event of\nnoncompliance. Economic growth occurs when the standard of living increases in an economy, which\noccurs when output is increasing and incomes are rising. For this to happen, societies must create a legal\nenvironment that gives individuals the ability to use their property to their fullest and highest use,\nincluding the right to trade or sell that property. Without a legal system that enforces contracts, people\nwould not be likely to enter into contracts for current or future services because of the risk of non-\npayment. This would make it difficult to transact business and would slow economic growth.\n3. Yes. Since productivity is output per unit of input, we can measure productivity using GDP (output) per\nworker (input).\n4. In 20 years the United States will have an income of 10,000 \u00d7 (1 + 0.01)20= $12,201.90, and South Korea\nwill have an income of 10,000 \u00d7 (1 + 0.04)20= $21,911.23. South Korea has grown by a multiple of 2.1 and\nthe United States by a multiple of 1.2.\n5. Capital deepening and technology are important. What seems to be more important is how they are\ncombined.\n6. Government can contribute to economic growth by investing in human capital through the education\nsystem, building a strong physical infrastructure for transportation and commerce, increasing investment\nby lowering capital gains taxes, creating special economic zones that allow for reduced tariffs, and\ninvesting in research and development.\n7. Public education, low investment taxes, funding for infrastructure projects, special economic zones\n8. A good way to think about this is how a runner who has fallen behind in a race feels psychologically and\nphysically as he catches up. Playing catch-up can be more taxing than maintaining one\u2019s position at the\nhead of the pack.\n9. a. No. Capital deepening refers to an increase in the amount of capital per person in an economy. A\ndecrease in investment by firms will actually cause the opposite of capital deepening (since the\npopulation will grow over time).\nb. There is no direct connection between an increase in international trade and capital deepening. One\ncould imagine particular scenarios where trade could lead to capital deepening (for example, if\ninternational capital inflows\u2014which are the counterpart to increasing the trade deficit\u2014lead to an\nincrease in physical capital investment), but in general, no.\nc. Yes. Capital deepening refers to an increase in either physical capital or human capital per person.\nContinuing education or any time of lifelong learning adds to human capital and thus creates capital\ndeepening.\n10. The advantages of backwardness include faster growth rates because of the process of convergence, as\nwell as the ability to adopt new technologies that were developed first in the \u201cleader\u201d countries. While\nAccess for free at openstax.org 929\nbeing \u201cbackward\u201d is not inherently a good thing, Gerschenkron stressed that there are certain advantages\nwhich aid countries trying to \u201ccatch up.\u201d\n11. Capital deepening, by definition, should lead to diminished returns because you're investing more and\nmore but using the same methods of production, leading to the marginal productivity declining. This is\nshown on a production function as a movement along the curve. Improvements in technology should not\nlead to diminished returns because you are finding new and more efficient ways of using the same\namount of capital. This can be illustrated as a shift upward of the production function curve.\n12. In high-income economies, diminishing returns to investments in physical and human capital may not\napply because many high-income economies have developed economic and political institutions that\nprovide a healthy economic climate for an ongoing stream of technological innovations. Continuous\ntechnological innovation can counterbalance diminishing returns to investments in human and physical\ncapital. These two factors have the added effect of making additional technological advances even easier\nfor these countries.\nAs a result, productivity growth from new advances in technology will not increase at a diminishing rate\nor otherwise slow down because the new methods of production will be adopted relatively quickly and\neasily, at very low marginal cost.\nChapter 21\n1. The population is divided into those \u201cin the labor force\u201d and those \u201cnot in the labor force.\u201d Thus, the\nnumber of adults not in the labor force is 237.8 \u2013 153.9 = 83.9 million. Since the labor force is divided into\nemployed persons and unemployed persons, the number of unemployed persons is 153.9 \u2013 139.1 = 14.8\nmillion. Thus, the adult population has the following proportions:\n\u2022 139.1/237.8 = 58.5% employed persons\n\u2022 14.8/237.8 = 6.2% unemployed persons\n\u2022 83.9/237.8 = 35.3% persons out of the labor force\n2. The unemployment rate is defined as the number of unemployed persons as a percentage of the labor\nforce or 14.8/153.9 = 9.6%. This is higher than the February 2015 unemployment rate, computed earlier,\nof 5.5%.\n3. Over the long term, the U.S. unemployment rate has remained basically the same level.\n4. a. Non-White people\nb. The young\nc. High school graduates\n5. Because of the influx of women into the labor market, the supply of labor shifts to the right. Since wages\nare sticky downward, the increased supply of labor causes an increase in people looking for jobs (Qs), but\nno change in the number of jobs available (Qe). As a result, unemployment increases by the amount of the\nincrease in the labor supply. This can be seen in the following figure.\nOver time, as labor demand grows, the unemployment will decline and eventually wages will begin to\nincrease again. But this increase in labor demand goes beyond the scope of this problem. 930\n6. The increase in labor supply was a social demographic trend\u2014it was not caused by the economy falling\ninto a recession. Therefore, the influx of women into the work force increased the natural rate of\nunemployment.\n7. New entrants to the labor force, whether from college or otherwise, are counted as frictionally unemployed\nuntil they find a job.\nChapter 22\n1. To compute the amount spent on each fruit in each year, you multiply the quantity of each fruit by the\nprice.\n\u2022 10 apples \u00d7 50 cents each = $5.00 spent on apples in 2001.\n\u2022 12 bananas \u00d7 20 cents each = $2.40 spent on bananas in 2001.\n\u2022 2 bunches of grapes at 65 cents each = $1.30 spent on grapes in 2001.\n\u2022 1 pint of raspberries at $2 each = $2.00 spent on raspberries in 2001.\nAdding up the amounts gives you the total cost of the fruit basket. The total cost of the fruit basket in 2001\nwas $5.00 + $2.40 + $1.30 + $2.00 = $10.70. The total costs for all the years are shown in the following\ntable.\n2001 2002 2003 2004\n$10.70 $13.80 $15.35 $16.31\n2. If 2003 is the base year, then the index number has a value of 100 in 2003. To transform the cost of a fruit\nbasket each year, we divide each year\u2019s value by $15.35, the value of the base year, and then multiply the\nresult by 100. The price index is shown in the following table.\n2001 2002 2003 2004\n69.71 89.90 100.00 106.3\nNote that the base year has a value of 100; years before the base year have values less than 100; and years\nafter have values more than 100.\n3. The inflation rate is calculated as the percentage change in the price index from year to year. For example,\nthe inflation rate between 2001 and 2002 is (89.90 \u2013 69.71) / 69.71 = 0.2137 = 28.96%. The inflation rates\nfor all the years are shown in the last row of the following table, which includes the two previous answers.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 931\n(2001) (2002) (2003) (2004)\n(2001) (2002) (2003) (2004)\nItems Qty Amount Amount Amount Amount\nPrice Price Price Price\nSpent Spent Spent Spent\nApples 10 $0.50 $5.00 $0.75 $7.50 $0.85 $8.50 $0.88 $8.80\nBananas 12 $0.20 $2.40 $0.25 $3.00 $0.25 $3.00 $0.29 $3.48\nGrapes 2 $0.65 $1.30 $0.70 $1.40 $0.90 $1.80 $0.95 $1.90\nRaspberries 1 $2.00 $2.00 $1.90 $1.90 $2.05 $2.05 $2.13 $2.13\nTotal $10.70 $13.80 $15.35 $16.31\nPrice Index 69.71 89.90 100.00 106.3\nInflation\n28.96% 11.23% 6.3%\nRate\n4.

Since the CPI measures the prices of the goods and services purchased by the typical urban consumer, it\nmeasures the prices of things that people buy with their paycheck. For that reason, the CPI would be the\nbest price index to use for this purpose.\n6. The PPI is subject to those biases for essentially the same reasons as the CPI is. The GDP deflator picks up\nprices of what is actually purchased that year, so there are no biases. That is the advantage of using the\nGDP deflator over the CPI.\n7. The calculator requires you to input three numbers:\n\u2022 The first year, in this case the year of your birth\n\u2022 The amount of money you would want to translate in terms of its purchasing power\n\u2022 The last year\u2014now or the most recent year the calculator will accept\nMy birth year is 1955. The amount is $1. The year 2012 is currently the latest year the calculator will\naccept. The simple purchasing power calculator shows that $1 of purchases in 1955 would cost $8.57 in\n2012. The website also explains how the true answer is more complicated than that shown by the simple\npurchasing power calculator.\n8. The state government would benefit because it would repay the loan in less valuable dollars than it\nborrowed. Plus, tax revenues for the state government would increase because of the inflation. 932\n9. Higher inflation reduces real interest rates on fixed rate mortgages. Because ARMs can be adjusted, higher\ninflation leads to higher interest rates on ARMs.\n10. Because the mortgage has an adjustable rate, the rate should fall by 3%, the same as inflation, to keep the\nreal interest rate the same.\nChapter 23\n1. The stock and bond values will not show up in the current account. However, the dividends from the stocks\nand the interest from the bonds show up as an import to income in the current account.\n2. It becomes more negative as imports, which are a negative to the current account, are growing faster than\nexports, which are a positive.\n3. a. Money flows out of the Mexican economy.\nb. Money flows into the Mexican economy.\nc. Money flows out of the Mexican economy.\n4. GDP is a dollar value of all production of goods and services. Exports are produced domestically but\nshipped abroad. The percent ratio of exports to GDP gives us an idea of how important exports are to the\nnational economy out of all goods and services produced. For example, exports represent only 14% of U.S.\nGDP, but 50% of Germany\u2019s GDP\n5. Divide $542 billion by $1,800 billion.\n6. Divide \u2013$400 billion by $16,800 billion.\n7. The trade balance is the difference between exports and imports. The current account balance includes\nthis number (whether it is a trade balance or a trade surplus), but also includes international flows of\nmoney from global investments.\n8. a. An export sale to Germany involves a financial flow from Germany to the U.S. economy.\nb. The issue here is not U.S. investments in Brazil, but the return paid on those investments, which\ninvolves a financial flow from the Brazilian economy to the U.S. economy.\nc. Foreign aid from the United States to Egypt is a financial flow from the United States to Egypt.\nd. Importing oil from the Russian Federation means a flow of financial payments from the U.S. economy\nto the Russian Federation.\ne. Japanese investors buying U.S. real estate is a financial flow from Japan to the U.S. economy.\n9. The top portion tracks the flow of exports and imports and the payments for those. The bottom portion is\nlooking at international financial investments and the outflow and inflow of monies from those\ninvestments. These investments can include investments in stocks and bonds or real estate abroad, as well\nas international borrowing and lending.\n10. If more monies are flowing out of the country (for example, to pay for imports) it will make the current\naccount more negative or less positive, and if more monies are flowing into the country, it will make the\ncurrent account less negative or more positive.\n11. Write out the national savings and investment identity for the situation of the economy implied by this\nquestion:\nIf domestic savings increases and nothing else changes, then the trade deficit will fall. In effect, the\neconomy would be relying more on domestic capital and less on foreign capital. If the government starts\nborrowing instead of saving, then the trade deficit must rise. In effect, the government is no longer\nproviding savings and so, if nothing else is to change, more investment funds must arrive from abroad. If\nthe rate of domestic investment surges, then,ceteris paribus, the trade deficit must also rise, to provide\nthe extra capital. Theceteris paribus\u2014or \u201cother things being equal\u201d\u2014assumption is important here. In all\nAccess for free at openstax.org 933\nof these situations, there is no reason to expect in the real world that the original change will affect only, or\nprimarily, the trade deficit. The identity only says that something will adjust\u2014it does not specify what.\n12. The government is saving rather than borrowing. The supply of savings, whether private or public, is on\nthe left side of the identity.\n13. A trade deficit is determined by a country\u2019s level of private and public savings and the amount of domestic\ninvestment.\n14. The trade deficit must increase. To put it another way, this increase in investment must be financed by an\ninflow of financial capital from abroad.\n15. Incomes fall during a recession, and consumers buy fewer good, including imports.\n16. A booming economy will increase the demand for goods in general, so import sales will increase. If our\ntrading partners\u2019 economies are doing well, they will buy more of our products and so U.S. exports will\nincrease.\n17. a. Increased federal spending on Medicare may not increase productivity, so a budget deficit is not\njustified.\nb. Increased spending on education will increase productivity and foster greater economic growth, so a\nbudget deficit is justified.\nc. Increased spending on the space program may not increase productivity, so a budget deficit is not\njustified.\nd. Increased spending on airports and air traffic control will increase productivity and foster greater\neconomic growth, so a budget deficit is justified.\n18. Foreign investors worried about repayment so they began to pull money out of these countries. The money\ncan be pulled out of stock and bond markets, real estate, and banks.\n19. A rapidly growing trade surplus could result from a number of factors, so you would not want to be too\nquick to assume a specific cause. However, if the choice is between whether the economy is in recession or\ngrowing rapidly, the answer would have to be recession. In a recession, demand for all goods, including\nimports, has declined; however, demand for exports from other countries has not necessarily altered\nmuch, so the result is a larger trade surplus.\n20. Germany has a higher level of trade than the United States. The United States has a large domestic\neconomy so it has a large volume of internal trade.\n21. a. A large economy tends to have lower levels of international trade, because it can do more of its trade\ninternally, but this has little impact on its trade imbalance.\nb. An imbalance between domestic physical investment and domestic saving (including government and\nprivate saving) will always lead to a trade imbalance, but has little to do with the level of trade.\nc. Many large trading partners nearby geographically increases the level of trade, but has little impact\none way or the other on a trade imbalance.\nd. The answer here is not obvious. An especially large budget deficit means a large demand for financial\ncapital which, according to the national saving and investment identity, makes it somewhat more\nlikely that there will be a need for an inflow of foreign capital, which means a trade deficit.\ne. A strong tradition of discouraging trade certainly reduces the level of trade. However, it does not\nnecessarily say much about the balance of trade, since this is determined by both imports and\nexports, and by national levels of physical investment and savings.\nChapter 24\n1. In order to supply goods, suppliers must employ workers, whose incomes increase as a result of their\nlabor. They use this additional income to demand goods of an equivalent value to those they supply.\n2. When consumers demand more goods than are available on the market, prices are driven higher and the\nadditional opportunities for profit induce more suppliers to enter the market, producing an equivalent\namount to that which is demanded. 934\n3. Higher input prices make output less profitable, decreasing the desired supply. This is shown graphically\nas a leftward shift in the AS curve.\n4. Equilibrium occurs at the level of GDP where AD = AS. Insufficient aggregate demand could explain why\nthe equilibrium occurs at a level of GDP less than potential. A decrease (or leftward shift) in aggregate\nsupply could be another reason.\n5. Equilibrium real GDP will decrease and the price level will increase.\n6. Given the assumptions made here, the cuts in R&D funding should reduce productivity growth. The model\nwould show this as a leftward shift in the SRAS curve, leading to a lower equilibrium GDP and a higher\nprice level.\n7. An increase in the value of the stock market would make individuals feel wealthier and thus more\nconfident about their economic situation. This would likely cause an increase in consumer confidence\nleading to an increase in consumer spending, shifting the AD curve to the right. The result would be an\nincrease in the equilibrium level of GDP and an increase in the price level.\n8. Since imports depend on GDP, if Mexico goes into recession, its GDP declines and so do its imports. This\ndecline in our exports can be shown as a leftward shift in AD, leading to a decrease in our GDP and price\nlevel.\n9. Tax cuts increase consumer and investment spending, depending on where the tax cuts are targeted. This\nwould shift AD to the right, so if the tax cuts occurred when the economy was in recession (and GDP was\nless than potential), the tax cuts would increase GDP and \u201clead the economy out of recession.\u201d\n10. A negative report on home prices would make consumers feel like the value of their homes, which for\nmost Americans is a major portion of their wealth, has declined. A negative report on consumer\nconfidence would make consumers feel pessimistic about the future. Both of these would likely reduce\nconsumer spending, shifting AD to the left, reducing GDP and the price level. A positive report on the\nhome price index or consumer confidence would do the opposite.\n11. A smaller labor force would be reflected in a leftward shift in AS, leading to a lower equilibrium level of\nGDP and higher price level.\n12. Higher EU growth would increase demand for U.S. exports, reducing our trade deficit. The increased\ndemand for exports would show up as a rightward shift in AD, causing GDP to rise (and the price level to\nrise as well). Higher GDP would require more jobs to fulfill, so U.S. employment would also rise.\n13. Expansionary monetary policy shifts AD to the right. A continuing expansionary policy would cause larger\nand larger shifts (given the parameters of this problem). The result would be an increase in GDP and\nemployment (a decrease in unemployment) and higher prices until potential output was reached. After\nthat point, the expansionary policy would simply cause inflation.\n14. Since the SRAS curve is vertical in the neoclassical zone, unless the economy is bordering the\nintermediate zone, a decrease in AS will cause a decrease in the price level, but no effect on real economic\nactivity (for example, real GDP or employment).\n15. Because the SRAS curve is horizontal in the Keynesian zone, a decrease in AD should depress real\neconomic activity but have no effect on prices.\nChapter 25\n1. a. An increase in home values will increase consumption spending (due to increased wealth). AD will\nshift to the right and may cause inflation if it goes beyond potential GDP.\nb. Rapid growth by a major trading partner will increase demand for exports. AD will shift to the right\nand may cause inflation if it goes beyond potential GDP.\nc. Increased profit opportunities will increase business investment. AD will shift to the right and may\ncause inflation if it goes beyond potential GDP.\nd. Higher interest rates reduce investment spending. AD will shift to the left and may cause recession if it\nfalls below potential GDP.\ne. Demand for cheaper imports increases, reducing demand for domestic products. AD will shift to the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 935\nleft and may be recessionary.\n2. a. A tax increase on consumer income will cause consumption to fall, pushing the AD curve left, and is a\npossible solution to inflation.\nb. A surge in military spending is an increase in government spending. This will cause the AD curve to\nshift to the right. If real GDP is less than potential GDP, then this spending would pull the economy out\nof a recession. If real GDP is to the right of potential GDP, then the AD curve will shift farther to the\nright and military spending will be inflationary.\nc. A tax cut focused on business investment will shift AD to the right. If the original macroeconomic\nequilibrium is below potential GDP, then this policy can help move an economy out of a recession.\nd. Government spending on healthcare will cause the AD curve to shift to the right. If real GDP is less\nthan potential GDP, then this spending would pull the economy out of a recession. If real GDP is to th\nright of potential GDP, then the AD curve will shift farther to the right and healthcare spending will be\ninflationary.\n3. An inflationary gap is the result of an increase in aggregate demand when the economy is at potential\noutput. Since the AS curve is vertical at potential GDP, any increase in AD will lead to a higher price level\n(i.e. inflation) but no higher real GDP. This is easy to see if you draw AD to the right of AD .\n1 0\n4. A decrease in government spending will shift AD to the left.\n5. A decrease in energy prices, a positive supply shock, would cause the AS curve to shift out to the right,\nyielding more real GDP at a lower price level. This would shift the Phillips curve down toward the origin,\nmeaning the economy would experience lower unemployment and a lower rate of inflation.\n6. Keynesian economics does not require microeconomic price controls of any sort. It is true that many\nKeynesian economic prescriptions were for the government to influence the total amount of aggregate\ndemand in the economy, often through government spending and tax cuts.\n7. The three problems center on government\u2019s ability to estimate potential GDP, decide whether to influence\naggregate demand through tax changes or changes in government spending, and the lag time that occurs\nas Congress and the President attempt to pass legislation.\nChapter 26\n1. No, this statement is false. It would be more accurate to say that rational expectations seek to predict the\nfuture as accurately as possible, using all of past experience as a guide. Adaptive expectations are largely\nbackward looking; that is, they adapt as experience accumulates, but without attempting to look forward.\n2. An unemployment rate of zero percent is presumably well below the rate that is consistent with potential\nGDP and with the natural rate of unemployment. As a result, this policy would be attempting to push AD\nout to the right.\nIn the short run, it is possible to have unemployment slightly below the natural rate for a time, at a price of\nhigher inflation, as shown by the movement from E to E along the short-run AS curve. However, over\n0 1\ntime the extremely low unemployment rates will tend to cause wages to be bid up, and shift the short-run\nAS curve back to the left. The result would be a higher price level, but an economy still at potential GDP\nand the natural rate of unemployment, as determined by the long-run AS curve. If the government\ncontinues this policy, it will continually be pushing the price level higher and higher, but it will not be able\nto achieve its goal of zero percent unemployment, because that goal is inconsistent with market forces.\n3. The statement is accurate. Rational expectations can be thought of as a version of neoclassical economics\nbecause it argues that potential GDP and the rate of unemployment are shaped by market forces as wages\nand prices adjust. However, it is an \u201cextreme\u201d version because it argues that this adjustment takes place\nvery quickly. Other theories, like adaptive expectations, suggest that adjustment to the neoclassical\noutcome takes a few years.\n4. The short-term Keynesian model is built on the importance of aggregate demand as a cause of business\ncycles and a degree of wage and price rigidity, and thus does a sound job of explaining many recessions 936\nand why cyclical unemployment rises and falls. The neoclassical model emphasizes aggregate supply by\nfocusing on the underlying determinants of output and employment in markets, and thus tends to put\nmore emphasis on economic growth and how labor markets work.\nChapter 27\n1. As long as you remain within the walls of the casino, chips fit the definition of money; that is, they serve as\na medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Chips do not work very well as money once\nyou leave the casino, but many kinds of money do not work well in other areas. For example, it is hard to\nspend money from Turkey or Brazil at your local supermarket or at the movie theater.\n2. Many physical items that a person buys at one time but may sell at another time can serve as an answer to\nthis question. Examples include a house, land, art, rare coins or stamps, and so on.\n3. The currency and checks in M1 are easiest to spend. It is harder to spend M2 directly, although if there is\nan automatic teller machine in the shopping mall, you can turn M2 from your savings account into an M1\nof currency quite quickly. If your answer is about \u201ccredit cards,\u201d then you are really talking about spending\nM1\u2014although it is M1 from the account of the credit card company, which you will repay later when you\ncredit card bill comes due.\n4. a. Neither in M1 or M2\nb. That is part of M1, and because M2 includes M1 it is also part of M2\nc. Currency out in the public hands is part of M1 and M2\nd. Checking deposits are in M1 and M2\ne. Money market accounts are in M2\n5. A bank\u2019s assets include cash held in their vaults, but assets also include monies that the bank holds at the\nFederal Reserve Bank (called \u201creserves\u201d), loans that are made to customers, and bonds.\n6. a. A borrower who has been late on a number of loan payments looks perhaps less likely to repay the\nloan, or to repay it on time, and so you would want to pay less for that loan.\nb. If interest rates generally have risen, then this loan made at a time of relatively lower interest rates\nlooks less attractive, and you would pay less for it.\nc. If the borrower is a firm with a record of high profits, then it is likely to be able to repay the loan, and\nyou would be willing to pay more for the loan.\nd. If interest rates in the economy have fallen, then the loan is worth more.\nChapter 28\n1. Longer terms insulate the Board from political forces. Since the presidency can potentially change every\nfour years, the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence prevents drastic swings in monetary policy with every new\nadministration and allows policy decisions to be made only on economic grounds.\n2. Banks make their money from issuing loans and charging interest. The more money that is stored in the\nbank\u2019s vault, the less is available for lending and the less money the bank stands to make.\n3. The fear and uncertainty created by the suggestion that a bank might fail can lead depositors to withdraw\ntheir money. If many depositors do this at the same time, the bank may not be able to meet their demands\nand will, indeed, fail.\n4. The bank has to hold $1,000 in reserves, so when it buys the $500 in bonds, it will have to reduce its loans\nby $500 to make up the difference. The money supply decreases by the same amount.\n5. An increase in reserve requirements would reduce the supply of money, since more money would be held\nin banks rather than circulating in the economy.\n6. Contractionary policy reduces the amount of loanable funds in the economy. As with all goods, greater\nscarcity leads a greater price, so the interest rate, or the price of borrowing money, rises.\n7. An increase in the amount of available loanable funds means that there are more people who want to lend.\nThey, therefore, bid the price of borrowing (the interest rate) down.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 937\n8. In times of economic uncertainty, banks may worry that borrowers will lose the ability to repay their loans.\nThey may also fear that a panic is more likely and they will need the excess reserves to meet their\nobligations.\n9. If consumer optimism changes, spending can speed up or slow down. This could also happen in a case\nwhere consumers need to buy a large number of items quickly, such as in a situation of national\nemergency.\nChapter 29\n1. a. The British use the pound sterling, while Germans use the euro, so a British exporter will receive\neuros from export sales, which will need to be exchanged for pounds. A stronger euro will mean more\npounds per euro, so the exporter will be better off. In addition, the lower price for German imports will\nstimulate demand for British exports. For both these reasons, a stronger euro benefits the British\nexporter.\nb. The Dutch use euros while the Chileans use pesos, so the Dutch tourist needs to turn euros into\nChilean pesos. An increase in the euro means that the tourist will get more pesos per euro. As a\nconsequence, the Dutch tourist will have a less expensive vacation than he planned, so the tourist will\nbe better off.\nc. The Greek use euros while the Canadians use dollars. An increase in the euro means it will buy more\nCanadian dollars. As a result, the Greek bank will see a decrease in the cost of the Canadian bonds, so\nit may purchase more bonds. Either way, the Greek bank benefits.\nd. Since both the French and Germans use the euro, an increase in the euro, in terms of other currencies,\nshould have no impact on the French exporter.\n2. Expected depreciation in a currency will lead people to divest themselves of the currency. We should\nexpect to see an increase in the supply of pounds and a decrease in demand for pounds. The result should\nbe a decrease in the value of the poundvis \u00e0 visthe dollar.\n3. Lower U.S. interest rates make U.S. assets less desirable compared to assets in the European Union. We\nshould expect to see a decrease in demand for dollars and an increase in supply of dollars in foreign\ncurrency markets. As a result, we should expect to see the dollar depreciate compared to the euro.\n4. A decrease in Argentine inflation relative to other countries should cause an increase in demand for pesos,\na decrease in supply of pesos, and an appreciation of the peso in foreign currency markets.\n5. The problem occurs when banks borrow foreign currency but lend in domestic currency. Since banks\u2019\nassets (loans they made) are in domestic currency, while their debts (money they borrowed) are in foreign\ncurrency, when the domestic currency declines, their debts grow larger. If the domestic currency falls\nsubstantially in value, as happened during the Asian financial crisis, then the banking system could fail.\nThis problem is unlikely to occur for U.S. banks because, even when they borrow from abroad, they tend to\nborrow dollars. Remember, there are trillions of dollars in circulation in the global economy. Since both\nassets and debts are in dollars, a change in the value of the dollar does not cause banking system failure\nthe way it can when banks borrow in foreign currency.\n6. While capital flight is possible in either case, if a country borrows to invest in real capital it is more likely to\nbe able to generate the income to pay back its debts than a country that borrows to finance consumption.\nAs a result, an investment-stimulated economy is less likely to provoke capital flight and economic\nrecession.\n7. A contractionary monetary policy, by driving up domestic interest rates, would cause the currency to\nappreciate. The higher value of the currency in foreign exchange markets would reduce exports, since\nfrom the perspective of foreign buyers, they are now more expensive. The higher value of the currency\nwould similarly stimulate imports, since they would now be cheaper from the perspective of domestic\nbuyers. Lower exports and higher imports cause net exports (EX \u2013 IM) to fall, which causes aggregate\ndemand to fall. The result would be a decrease in GDP working through the exchange rate mechanism\nreinforcing the effect contractionary monetary policy has on domestic investment expenditure. However, 938\ncheaper imports would stimulate aggregate supply, bringing GDP back to potential, though at a lower price\nlevel.\n8. For a currency to fall, a central bank need only supply more of its currency in foreign exchange markets. It\ncan print as much domestic currency as it likes. For a currency to rise, a central bank needs to buy its\ncurrency in foreign exchange markets, paying with foreign currency. Since no central bank has an infinite\namount of foreign currency reserves, it cannot buy its currency indefinitely.\n9. Variations in exchange rates, because they change import and export prices, disturb international trade\nflows. When trade is a large part of a nation\u2019s economic activity, government will find it more advantageous\nto fix exchange rates to minimize disruptions of trade flows.\nChapter 30\n1. The government borrows funds by selling Treasury bonds, notes, and bills.\n2. The funds can be used to pay down the national debt or else be refunded to the taxpayers.\n3. Yes, a nation can run budget deficits and see its debt/GDP ratio fall. In fact, this is not uncommon. If the\ndeficit is small in a given year, than the addition to debt in the numerator of the debt/GDP ratio will be\nrelatively small, while the growth in GDP is larger, and so the debt/GDP ratio declines. This was the\nexperience of the U.S. economy for the period from the end of World War II to about 1980. It is also\ntheoretically possible, although not likely, for a nation to have a budget surplus and see its debt/GDP ratio\nrise. Imagine the case of a nation with a small surplus, but in a recession year when the economy shrinks.\nIt is possible that the decline in the nation\u2019s debt, in the numerator of the debt/GDP ratio, would be\nproportionally less than the fall in the size of GDP, so the debt/GDP ratio would rise.\n4. Progressive. People who give larger gifts subject to the higher tax rate would typically have larger incomes\nas well.\n5. Corporate income tax on his profits, individual income tax on his salary, and payroll tax taken out of the\nwages he pays himself.\n6. individual income taxes\n7. The tax is regressive because wealthy income earners are not taxed at all on income above $113,000. As a\npercent of total income, the social security tax hits lower income earners harder than wealthier\nindividuals.\n8. As debt increases, interest payments also rise, so that the deficit grows even if we keep other government\nspending constant.\n9. a. As a share of GDP, this is false. In nominal dollars, it is true.\nb. False.\nc. False.\nd. False. Education spending is much higher at the state level.\ne. False. As a share of GDP, it is up about 50.\nf.

To keep prices from rising too much or too rapidly.\n11. To increase employment.\n12. It falls below because less tax revenue than expected is collected.\n13. Automatic stabilizers take effect very quickly, whereas discretionary policy can take a long time to\nimplement.\n14. In a recession, because of the decline in economic output, less income is earned, and so less in taxes is\nautomatically collected. Many welfare and unemployment programs are designed so that those who fall\nAccess for free at openstax.org 939\ninto certain categories, like \u201cunemployed\u201d or \u201clow income,\u201d are eligible for benefits. During a recession,\nmore people fall into these categories and become eligible for benefits automatically. The combination of\nreduced taxes and higher spending is just what is needed for an economy in recession producing below\npotential GDP. With an economic boom, average income levels rise in the economy, so more in taxes is\nautomatically collected. Fewer people meet the criteria for receiving government assistance to the\nunemployed or the needy, so government spending on unemployment assistance and welfare falls\nautomatically. This combination of higher taxes and lower spending is just what is needed if an economy\nis producing above its potential GDP.\n15. Prices would be pushed up as a result of too much spending.\n16. Employment would suffer as a result of too little spending.\n17. Monetary policy probably has shorter time lags than fiscal policy. Imagine that the data becomes fairly\nclear that an economy is in or near a recession. Expansionary monetary policy can be carried out through\nopen market operations, which can be done fairly quickly, since the Federal Reserve\u2019s Open Market\nCommittee meets six times a year. Also, monetary policy takes effect through interest rates, which can\nchange fairly quickly. However, fiscal policy is carried out through acts of Congress that need to be signed\ninto law by the president. Negotiating such laws often takes months, and even after the laws are\nnegotiated, it takes more months for spending programs or tax cuts to have an effect on the\nmacroeconomy.\n18. The government would have to make up the revenue either by raising taxes in a different area or cutting\nspending.\n19. Programs where the amount of spending is not fixed, but rather determined by macroeconomic\nconditions, such as food stamps, would lose a great deal of flexibility if spending increases had to be met\nby corresponding tax increases or spending cuts.\nChapter 31\n1. We use the national savings and investment identity to solve this question. In this case, the government\nhas a budget surplus, so the government surplus appears as part of the supply of financial capital. Then:\n2. a. Since the government has a budget surplus, the government budget term appears with the supply of\ncapital. The following shows the national savings and investment identity for this economy.\nb. Plugging the given values into the identity shown in part (a), we find that (X \u2013 M) = 0.\nc. Since the government has a budget deficit, the government budget term appears with the demand for\ncapital. You do not know in advance whether the economy has a trade deficit or a trade surplus. But\nwhen you see that the quantity demanded of financial capital exceeds the quantity supplied, you know\nthat there must be an additional quantity of financial capital supplied by foreign investors, which\nmeans a trade deficit of 2000. This example shows that in this case there is a higher budget deficit,\nand a higher trade deficit.\n3. In this case, the national saving and investment identity is written in this way: 940\nThe increase in the government budget surplus and the increase in the trade deficit both increased the\nsupply of financial capital. If investment in physical capital remained unchanged, then private savings\nmust go down, and if savings remained unchanged, then investment must go up. In fact, both effects\nhappened; that is, in the late 1990s, in the U.S. economy, savings declined and investment rose.\n4. Ricardian equivalence means that private saving changes to offset exactly any changes in the government\nbudget. So, if the deficit increases by 20, private saving increases by 20 as well, and the trade deficit and\nthe budget deficit will not change from their original levels. The original national saving and investment\nidentity is written below. Notice that if any change in the (G \u2013 T) term is offset by a change in the S term,\nthen the other terms do not change. So if (G \u2013 T) rises by 20, then S must also increase by 20.\n5. In the last few decades, spending per student has climbed substantially. However, test scores have fallen\nover this time. This experience has led a number of experts to argue that the problem is not resources\u2014or\nis not just resources by itself\u2014but is also a problem of how schools are organized and managed and what\nincentives they have for success. There are a number of proposals to alter the incentives that schools face,\nbut relatively little hard evidence on what proposals work well. Without trying to evaluate whether these\nproposals are good or bad ideas, you can just list some of them: testing students regularly; rewarding\nteachers or schools that perform well on such tests; requiring additional teacher training; allowing\nstudents to choose between public schools; allowing teachers and parents to start new schools; giving\nstudent \u201cvouchers\u201d that they can use to pay tuition at either public or private schools.\n6. The government can direct government spending to R&D. It can also create tax incentives for business to\ninvest in R&D.\nChapter 32\n1. The answers are shown in the following two tables.\nRegion GDP (in millions)\nEast Asia $10,450,032\nLatin America $5,339,390\nSouth Asia $2,288,812\nEurope and Central Asia $1,862,384\nMiddle East and North Africa $1,541,900\nSub-Saharan Africa $1,287,650\nRegion GDP Per Capita (in millions)\nEast Asia $5,246\nLatin America $1,388\nSouth Asia $1,415\nEurope and Central Asia $9,190\nAccess for free at openstax.org 941\nRegion GDP Per Capita (in millions)\nMiddle East and North Africa $4,535\nSub-Saharan Africa $6,847\nEast Asia appears to be the largest economy on GDP basis, but on a per capita basis it drops to third, after\nEurope and Central Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.\n2. A region can have some of high-income countries and some of the low-income countries. Aggregating per\ncapita real GDP will vary widely across countries within a region, so aggregating data for a region has little\nmeaning. For example, if you were to compare per capital real GDP for the United States, Canada, Haiti,\nand Honduras, it looks much different than if you looked at the same data for North America as a whole.\nThus, regional comparisons are broad-based and may not adequately capture an individual country\u2019s\neconomic attributes.\n3. The following table provides a summary of possible answers.\nHigh-Income Middle-Income Low-Income\nCountries Countries Countries\n\u2022 Foster a more educated workforce\n\u2022 Create, invest in, and apply new \u2022 Eradicate poverty and\ntechnologies \u2022 Invest in technology, extreme\n\u2022 Adopt fiscal policies focused on human hunger\ninvestment, including investment in capital, and physical capital \u2022 Achieve universal primary\nhuman capital, in technology, \u2022 Provide incentives of a education\nand in physical plant and market- \u2022 Promote gender equality\nequipment oriented economic context \u2022 Reduce child mortality\n\u2022 Create stable and market-oriented \u2022 Work to reduce government rates\neconomic climate economic controls on \u2022 Improve maternal health\n\u2022 Use monetary policy to keep market \u2022 Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria,\ninflation activities and other diseases\nlow and stable \u2022 Deregulate the banking and \u2022 Ensure environmental\n\u2022 Minimize the risk of exchange rate financial sector sustainability\nfluctuations, while also \u2022 Reduce protectionist \u2022 Develop global\nencouraging policies partnerships\ndomestic and international for development\ncompetition\n4. Low-income countries must adopt government policies that are market-oriented and that educate the\nworkforce and population. After this is done, low-income countries should focus on eradicating other\nsocial ills that inhibit their growth. The economically challenged are stuck in poverty traps. They need to\nfocus more on health and education and create a stable macroeconomic and political environment. This\nwill attract foreign aid and foreign investment. Middle-income countries strive for increases in physical\ncapital and innovation, while higher-income countries must work to maintain their economies through\ninnovation and technology.\n5. If there is a recession and unemployment increases, we can call on an expansionary fiscal policy (lower\ntaxes or increased government spending) or an expansionary monetary policy (increase the money supply\nand lower interest rates). Both policies stimulate output and decrease unemployment.\n6. Aside from a high natural rate of unemployment due to government regulations, subsistence households 942\nmay be counted as not working.\n7. Indexing wage contracts means wages rise when prices rise. This means what you can buy with your\nwages, your standard of living, remains the same. When wages are not indexed, or rise with inflation, your\nstandard of living falls.\n8. An increase in government spending shifts the AD curve to the right, raising both income and price levels.\n9. A decrease in the money supply will shift the AD curve leftward and reduce income and price levels. Banks\nwill have less money to lend. Interest rates will increase, affecting consumption and investment, which are\nboth key determinants of aggregate demand.\n10. Given the high level of activity in international financial markets, it is typically believed that financial\nflows across borders are the real reason for trade imbalances. For example, the United States had an\nenormous trade deficit in the late 1990s and early 2000s because it was attracting vast inflows of foreign\ncapital. Smaller countries that have attracted such inflows of international capital worry that if the inflows\nsuddenly turn to outflows, the resulting decline in their currency could collapse their banking system and\nbring on a deep recession.\n11. The demand for the country\u2019s currency would decrease, lowering the exchange rate.\nChapter 33\n1. False. Anything that leads to different levels of productivity between two economies can be a source of\ncomparative advantage. For example, the education of workers, the knowledge base of engineers and\nscientists in a country, the part of a split-up value chain where they have their specialized learning,\neconomies of scale, and other factors can all determine comparative advantage.\n2. Brazil has the absolute advantage in producing beef and the United States has the absolute advantage in\nautos. The opportunity cost of producing one pound of beef is 1/10 of an auto; in the United States it is 3/4\nof an auto.\n3. In answering questions like these, it is often helpful to begin by organizing the information in a table, such\nas in the following table. Notice that, in this case, the productivity of the countries is expressed in terms of\nhow many workers it takes to produce a unit of a product.\nCountry One Sweater One Bottle of wine\nFrance 1 worker 1 worker\nTunisia 2 workers 3 workers\nIn this example, France has an absolute advantage in the production of both sweaters and wine. You can\ntell because it takes France less labor to produce a unit of the good.\n4. a. In Germany, it takes fewer workers to make either a television or a video camera. Germany has an\nabsolute advantage in the production of both goods.\nb. Producing an additional television in Germany requires three workers. Shifting those three German\nworkers will reduce video camera production by 3/4 of a camera. Producing an additional television\nset in Poland requires six workers, and shifting those workers from the other good reduces output of\nvideo cameras by 6/12 of a camera, or 1/2. Thus, the opportunity cost of producing televisions is lower\nin Poland, so Poland has the comparative advantage in the production of televisions.Note: Do not let\nthe fractions like 3/4 of a camera or 1/2 of a video camera bother you. If either country was to expand\ntelevision production by a significant amount\u2014that is, lots more than one unit\u2014then we will be talking\nabout whole cameras and not fractional ones. You can also spot this conclusion by noticing that\nPoland\u2019s absolute disadvantage is relatively lower in televisions, because Poland needs twice as many\nworkers to produce a television but three times as many to produce a video camera, so the product\nwith the relatively lower absolute disadvantage is Poland\u2019s comparative advantage.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 943\nc. Producing a video camera in Germany requires four workers, and shifting those four workers away\nfrom television production has an opportunity cost of 4/3 television sets. Producing a video camera in\nPoland requires 12 workers, and shifting those 12 workers away from television production has an\nopportunity cost of two television sets. Thus, the opportunity cost of producing video cameras is lower\nin Germany, and video cameras will be Germany\u2019s comparative advantage.\nd. In this example, absolute advantage differs from comparative advantage. Germany has the absolute\nadvantage in the production of both goods, but Poland has a comparative advantage in the production\nof televisions.\ne. Germany should specialize, at least to some extent, in the production of video cameras, export video\ncameras, and import televisions. Conversely, Poland should specialize, at least to some extent, in the\nproduction of televisions, export televisions, and import video cameras.\n5. There are a number of possible advantages of intra-industry trade. Both nations can take advantage of\nextreme specialization and learning in certain kinds of cars with certain traits, like gas-efficient cars,\nluxury cars, sport-utility vehicles, higher- and lower-quality cars, and so on. Moreover, nations can take\nadvantage of economies of scale, so that large companies will compete against each other across\ninternational borders, providing the benefits of competition and variety to customers. This same argument\napplies to trade between U.S. states, where people often buy products made by people of other states, even\nthough a similar product is made within the boundaries of their own state. All states\u2014and all\ncountries\u2014can benefit from this kind of competition and trade.\n6. a. Start by plotting the points on a sketch diagram and then drawing a line through them. The following\nfigure illustrates the average costs of production of semiconductors.\nThe curve illustrates economies of scale by showing that as the scale increases\u2014that is, as production\nat this particular factory goes up\u2014the average cost of production declines. The economies of scale\nexist up to an output of 40,000 semiconductors; at higher outputs, the average cost of production does\nnot seem to decline any further.\nb. At any quantity demanded above 40,000, this economy can take full advantage of economies of scale;\nthat is, it can produce at the lowest cost per unit. Indeed, if the quantity demanded was quite high, like\n500,000, then there could be a number of different factories all taking full advantage of economies of\nscale and competing with each other. If the quantity demanded falls below 40,000, then the economy\nby itself, without foreign trade, cannot take full advantage of economies of scale.\nc. The simplest answer to this question is that the small country could have a large enough factory to\ntake full advantage of economies of scale, but then export most of the output. For semiconductors,\ncountries like Taiwan and Korea have recently fit this description. Moreover, this country could also 944\nimport semiconductors from other countries which also have large factories, thus getting the benefits\nof competition and variety. A slightly more complex answer is that the country can get these benefits\nof economies of scale without producing semiconductors, but simply by buying semiconductors made\nat low cost around the world. An economy, especially a smaller country, may well end up specializing\nand producing a few items on a large scale, but then trading those items for other items produced on a\nlarge scale, and thus gaining the benefits of economies of scale by trade, as well as by direct\nproduction.\n7. A nation might restrict trade on imported products to protect an industry that is important for national\nsecurity. For example, nation X and nation Y may be geopolitical rivals, each with ambitions of increased\npolitical and economic strength. Even if nation Y has comparative advantage in the production of missile\ndefense systems, it is unlikely that nation Y would seek to export those goods to nation X. It is also the case\nthat, for some nations, the production of a particular good is a key component of national identity. In\nJapan, the production of rice is culturally very important. It may be difficult for Japan to import rice from a\nnation like Vietnam, even if Vietnam has a comparative advantage in rice production.\nChapter 34\n1. This is the opposite case of the Work It Out feature. A reduced tariff is like a decrease in the cost of\nproduction, which is shown by a downward (or rightward) shift in the supply curve.\n2. A subsidy is like a reduction in cost. This shifts the supply curve down (or to the right), driving the price of\nsugar down. If the subsidy is large enough, the price of sugar can fall below the cost of production faced by\nforeign producers, which means they will lose money on any sugar they produce and sell.\n3. Trade barriers raise the price of goods in protected industries. If those products are inputs in other\nindustries, it raises their production costs and then prices, so sales fall in those other industries. Lower\nsales lead to lower employment. Additionally, if the protected industries are consumer goods, their\ncustomers pay higher prices, which reduce demand for other consumer products and thus employment in\nthose industries.\n4. Trade based on comparative advantage raises the average wage rate economy-wide, though it can reduce\nthe incomes of import-substituting industries. By moving away from a country\u2019s comparative advantage,\ntrade barriers do the opposite: they give workers in protected industries an advantage, while reducing the\naverage wage economy-wide.\n5. By raising incomes, trade tends to raise working conditions also, even though those conditions may not\n(yet) be equivalent to those in high-income countries.\n6. They typically pay more than the next-best alternative. If a Nike firm did not pay workers at least as much\nas they would earn, for example, in a subsistence rural lifestyle, they many never come to work for Nike.\n7. Since trade barriers raise prices, real incomes fall. The average worker would also earn less.\n8. Workers working in other sectors and the protected sector see a decrease in their real wage.\n9. If imports can be sold at extremely low prices, domestic firms would have to match those prices to be\ncompetitive. By definition, matching prices would imply selling under cost and, therefore, losing money.\nFirms cannot sustain losses forever. When they leave the industry, importers can \u201ctake over,\u201d raising\nprices to monopoly levels to cover their short-term losses and earn long-term profits.\n10. Because low-income countries need to provide necessities\u2014food, clothing, and shelter\u2014to their people. In\nother words, they consider environmental quality a luxury.\n11. Low-income countries can compete for jobs by reducing their environmental standards to attract\nbusiness to their countries. This could lead to a competitive reduction in regulations, which would lead to\ngreater environmental damage. While pollution management is a cost for businesses, it is tiny relative to\nother costs, like labor and adequate infrastructure. It is also costly for firms to locate far away from their\ncustomers, which many low-income countries are.\n12. The decision should not be arbitrary or unnecessarily discriminatory. It should treat foreign companies\nthe same way as domestic companies. It should be based on science.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 945\n13. Restricting imports today does not solve the problem. If anything, it makes it worse since it implies using\nup domestic sources of the products faster than if they are imported. Also, the national security argument\ncan be used to support protection of nearly any product, not just things critical to our national security.\n14. The effect of increasing standards may increase costs to the small exporting country. The supply curve of\ntoys will shift to the left. Exports will decrease and toy prices will rise. Tariffs also raise prices. So the effect\non the price of toys is the same. A tariff is a \u201csecond best\u201d policy and also affects other sectors. However, a\ncommon standard across countries is a \u201cfirst best\u201d policy that attacks the problem at its root.\n15. A free trade association offers free trade between its members, but each country can determine its own\ntrade policy outside the association. A common market requires a common external trade policy in\naddition to free trade within the group. An economic union is a common market with coordinated fiscal\nand monetary policy.\n16. International agreements can serve as a political counterweight to domestic special interests, thereby\npreventing stronger protectionist measures.\n17. Reductions in tariffs, quotas, and other trade barriers, improved transportation, and communication\nmedia have made people more aware of what is available in the rest of the world.\n18. Competition from firms with better or cheaper products can reduce a business\u2019s profits, and may drive it\nout of business. Workers would similarly lose income or even their jobs.\n19. Consumers get better or less expensive products. Businesses with the better or cheaper products increase\ntheir profits. Employees of those businesses earn more income.
