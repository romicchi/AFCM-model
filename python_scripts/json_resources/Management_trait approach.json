These traits include dimensions of personality and motives, sets of skills and capabilities, and\nbehavior in social relationships. Using traits to explain effective leadership considers both characteristics that are inherited and attributes\nthat are learned. This approach has been used to differentiate leaders from non-leaders. Understanding the importance of these traits can\nhelp organizations select, train, and develop leaders.\nLeaders' Traits\nFollowing studies of trait leadership, most leader traits can be organized into four groups:\nPersonality: Patterns of behavior, such as adaptability and comfort with ambiguity, and dispositional tendencies, such as motives and\nvalues, are associated with effective leadership.\nDemographic: In this category, gender has received by far the most attention in terms of leadership; however, most scholars have found\nthat gender is not a determining demographic trait, as male and female leaders are equally effective.\nTask competence: This relates to how individuals approach the execution and performance of tasks. Hoffman groups intelligence,\nconscientiousness, openness to experience, and emotional stability into this category.\nInterpersonal attributes:These relate to how a leader approaches social interactions. According to Hoffman and others (2011), traits such\nas extroversion and agreeableness are included in this category.\nProximal vs. Distal Characteristics\nTrait leadership also takes into account the distinction between proximal and distal character traits. Proximal characteristics are traits that\nare malleable and can be developed over time. These include interpersonal skills, problem-solving skills, and communication skills. Distal\ncharacteristics are more dispositional; that is, people are born with them. These include traits such as self-confidence, creativity, and\ncharisma. Hoffman and others (2011) found that both types of characteristics are correlated with leader effectiveness, implying that while\nleaders can be born, they can also be made.\nTrait Integration in Effective Leaders\nZaccoro and others (2004) introduced a model of leadership that categorized and specified six types of traits that influence leader\neffectiveness. The model rests on two basic premises about leadership traits. The first premise states that effective leadership derives not\nfrom any one trait, but from an integrated set of cognitive abilities, social capabilities, and dispositional tendencies, with each set of traits\nadding to the influence of the other. The second premise maintains that the traits differ in how directly they influence leadership. The\npremise suggests that distal attributes (such as dispositional attributes, cognitive abilities, and motives/values) come first and then lead to\nthe development of proximal characteristics. This model contends the following traits are correlated with strong leadership potential:\nextroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness, neuroticism, honesty, charisma, intelligence, creativity, achievement motivation,\nneed for power, communication skills, interpersonal skills, problem-solving skills, decision-making skills, technical knowledge, and\nmanagement skills.\nZaccaro's trait integration model of effective leadership: This\ndiagram visually represents Zaccaro's theory that distal attributes (e.g.,\ncognitive abilities, personality, values) serve as precursors for the\ndevelopment of proximal personal characteristics (e.g. social skills,\nproblem-solving skills), both of which contribute to leadership.\nHonesty in Leadership: Kouzes and Posner\nKouzes and Posner identify five behaviors of effective leadership, with honesty essential to each.\nLearning Objectives\nAssess the theoretical framework devised by Kouzes and Posner in relating leadership and honesty from a business perspective\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nLeadership is a process of motivating people and mobilizing resources to accomplish a common goal.\nHonesty refers to different aspects of moral character. It indicates positive and virtuous attributes such as integrity, truthfulness, and\nstraightforwardness.\nHonesty is essential to a leader 's legitimacy, credibility, and ability to develop trust with followers.\nKouzes and Posner identify five behaviors of effective leaders: model the way, inspire vision, enable others, challenge the process, and\nencourage the heart.\nEffective leaders set strong behavioral examples while expounding upon the company vision to inspire employees to be fulfilled, and\nhonesty is a necessary component of this behavior.\nKey Terms\nmicromanaging: The act of over-supervising or employing too much detail in delegating a task.\nHonesty: A facet of moral character that connotes positive and virtuous attributes such as integrity, truthfulness, and straightforwardness,\nalong with the absence of lying, cheating, or theft.\nLeadership is the ability to motivate people and mobilize resources to accomplish a common goal. In leadership, honesty is an important\nvirtue, as leaders serve as role models for their subordinates. Honesty refers to different aspects of moral character. It indicates positive\nand virtuous attributes such as integrity, truthfulness, and straightforwardness. These characteristics create trust, which is critical to leaders\nin all positions. Honesty also implies the absence of lying, cheating, or theft.\nSubordinates have faith in the leaders they follow. A leader who is not honest will lose legitimacy in the eyes of followers. Integrity and\nopenness are essential to developing trust, and without honesty a leader cannot gain and maintain the trust needed to build commitment\nto a shared vision.\nLeadership experts Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner find honesty to be the most important trait of effective leaders. In its absence, leaders\nlack credibility, and their ability to influence others is diminished. Honesty also brings a degree of transparency to a leader's interaction\nwith others.\nFor Kouzes and Posner, honesty is a critical element of the five behaviors of effective leaders.\nFive behaviors of effective leaders: This model was\ncreated by Kouzes and Posner to emphasize vital\nleadership practices.\nModel the way: Leaders must clarify their values and set an example for their employees to imitate, underscoring the importance of\nmodeling positive characteristics such as honesty.\nInspire vision: The vision is the emotional element of a company's mission statement, and this vision must be communicated honestly and\nwith passion. Promoting the company's vision allows leaders to inspire employees.\nEnable others to act: Leaders often make the critical mistake of micromanaging, as opposed to trusting others to do their job. Trust stems\nfrom honesty, and creating an honest environment allows other employees more personal autonomy.\nChallenge the process: Leaders need to be attentive to how things are done, not just what gets done, and they must be willing to address\nareas that require change. These practices are essential for continuous improvement, progress toward goals, and innovation.\nEncourage the heart: Leaders must nurture the emotional dimension of their relationships with followers. Showing appreciation, creating a\nsupportive environment, and fostering community sentiment helps build commitment to the leader's vision.\nIn summary, leaders are tasked with balancing the organizational strategies of management with the social elements of leading. This\nrequires leaders to be in tune with their employees' emotions and concerns in a meaningful and honest way. Effective leaders set strong\nbehavioral examples while communicating their vision to inspire employees. The need for honesty is woven throughout the primary\nactivities of effective leaders.\nLeadership and Gender\nStudies on the role of gender in leadership success show mixed results.\nLearning Objectives\nDiscuss the relationship between gender and leadership behavior\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nResearch on leadership differences between men and women shows conflicting results. Some research states that women have a different\nstyle of leadership than men, while other studies reveal no major differences in leadership behaviors between the genders.\nAreas of study have included perceptions of leadership, leadership styles, leadership practices, and leadership effectiveness.\nSome studies have found women leaders tend to demonstrate more communication, cooperation, affiliation, and nurturing than men in\nleadership.\nMale leaders have been shown to be be more goal- and task-oriented and less relationship- and process-focused than women.\nKey Terms\ngender: The sociocultural phenomenon of the division of people into categories of male and female, each having associated clothing,\nroles, stereotypes, etc.\nleadership: The capacity of someone to lead.\nIn many areas of society, men have long dominated leadership positions. This dominance was especially apparent in business, where\nfemale members of boards of directors and corporate executives had been scarce. Over the past three decades, however, women have\nentered more leadership positions throughout industry. The trend has provided an opportunity to examine differences in how men and\nwomen perform in the role of leaders.\nVirginia Rometty, CEO of IBM: As CEO of\none of the largest companies in the U.S.,\nVirginia Rometty is in a highly influential\nand visible leadership role.\nGender Differences in Leadership\nResearch reveals small but significant differences in the way men and women are perceived in leadership roles, their effectiveness in such\npositions, and their leadership styles. Studies conducted in the 1980s and early 1990s found that women adopt participative styles of\nleadership and were more often transformational leaders than men, who more commonly adopted directive, transactional styles. Women\nin management positions tend to demonstrate the importance of communication, cooperation, affiliation, and nurturing more than do\nmen in the same positions. The studies also showed men as more goal- and task-oriented and less relationship- and process-focused\nthan women.\nConflicting Studies\nNonetheless, studies demonstrating distinct leadership styles between men and woman do not represent the final word. Other research\nhas found limited evidence for significant differences between the behaviors of male and female leaders. In 2011, Anderson and Hanson\nfound differences in decision-making styles, but none linked directly to differences in leadership effectiveness. They found no distinction\nin types or degree of motivation or in leadership styles overall. Other studies show similar results, challenging the notion that leaders' sex\nshapes their performance as a leader. Management guru Rosabeth Moss Kanter studied men and women in a large corporation and\nfound that differences in their behavior resulted not from gender but from organizational factors. In Kanter's study, men and women,\ngiven the same degree of power and opportunity, behaved in similar ways.\nThe GLOBE Project\nThe GLOBE Research Project is an international group of social scientists and management scholars who study cross-cultural leadership.\nLearning Objectives\nOutline the nine cultural competences found by the GLOBE project using the six GLOBE dimensions and describe how the project pertains\nto leadership\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nGLOBE (Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness Research Project) is an international group of social scientists and\nmanagement scholars who study cross- cultural leadership.\nThis international team collected data from 17,300 middle managers in 951 organizations and grouped 62 countries into ten geographic\nclusters.\nThe research identified nine cultural competencies that distinguish approaches to leadership.\nThe research also identified six global dimensions by which to compare and contrast leadership behaviors.\nKey Terms\nGLOBE project: Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness study; refers to research into aspects of cross-cultural\nleadership behavior.\nUnder the Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness (GLOBE) Research Project, an international group of social\nscientists and management scholars studied cross-cultural leadership. In 1993, Robert J. House founded the project at the University of\nPennsylvania. The project looked at 62 societies with different cultures, which were studied by researchers working in their home\ncountries. This international team collected data from 17,300 middle managers in 951 organizations. They used qualitative methods to\nassist their development of quantitative instruments. The research identified nine cultural competencies and grouped the 62 countries\ninto ten geographic clusters, including Latin American, Nordic European, Sub-Saharan, and Confucian Asian.\nThe Globe Project: Logo for the Global\nLeadership and Organizational Behavior\nEffectiveness (GLOBE) Project.\nBases for Leadership Comparisons\nThe GLOBE project identified nine cultural dimensions, called competencies, with which the leadership approaches within geographic\nclusters can be compared and contrasted:\nPerformance orientation refers to the extent to which an organization or society encourages and rewards group members for performance\nimprovement and excellence.\nAssertiveness orientation is the degree to which individuals in organizations or societies are assertive, confrontational, and aggressive in\nsocial relationships.\nFuture orientation is the degree to which individuals in organizations or societies engage in future-oriented behaviors such as planning,\ninvesting in the future, and delaying gratification.\nHuman orientation is the degree to which individuals in organizations or societies encourage and reward individuals for being fair,\naltruistic, friendly, generous, caring, and kind to others.\nCollectivism I (institutional collectivism) is the degree to which organizational and societal institutional practices encourage and reward\ncollective distribution of resources and collective action.\nCollectivism II (in-group collectivism) is the degree to which individuals express pride, loyalty, and cohesiveness in their organizations or\nfamilies.\nGender egalitarianism is the extent to which an organization or a society minimizes gender role differences and gender discrimination.\nPower distance is the degree to which members of an organization or society expect and agree that power should be unequally shared.\nUncertainty avoidance is the extent to which members of an organization or society strive to avoid uncertainty by reliance on social\nnorms, rituals, and bureaucratic practices to alleviate the unpredictability of future events.\nGLOBE Leadership Dimensions\nFollowing extensive review of the research, GLOBE participants grouped leadership characteristics into six dimensions. Researchers then\nmade recommendations about how dimensions of culture and leadership could distinguish behavior in one country or culture from\nanother.\nKnown as the six GLOBE dimensions of culturally endorsed implicit leadership, these leadership dimensions include:\nCharismatic or value-based: Characterized by integrity and decisiveness; performance-oriented by appearing visionary, inspirational, and\nself-sacrificing; can also be toxic and allow for autocratic commanding.\nTeam-oriented: Characterized by diplomacy, administrative competence, team collaboration, and integration.\nSelf-protective: Characterized by self-centeredness, face-saving, and procedural behavior capable of inducing conflict when necessary,\nwhile being conscious of status.\nParticipative: Characterized by non-autocratic behavior that encourages involvement and engagement and that is supportive of those\nwho are being led.\nHuman orientation: Characterized by modesty and compassion for others in an altruistic fashion.\nAutonomous: Characterized by ability to function without constant consultation.\nLicenses and Attributions\nPrevious Next\nFreshly uploaded management documents\nEthics in Financial Reporting.edited Rubric Topic 2 Becoming and being an effective\nleader Advocacy and Leadership\n(7041HSV3235)\nSOC110 Wk 5 Assessment MANAGEMENT-889-Slides MANAGEMENT-9257-Analysis\nSOC110 Wk 3 Assessment(1) The topic, aims, objectives and research Employee Turnover.edited\nquestions\nSUBJECTS LEGAL COMPANY CONNECT WITH US\nAccounting Copyright Policy Documents Sitemap Facebook\nBusiness Honor Code Study Guides Instagram\nCommunications Terms YouTube\nEconomics Academic Integrity Twitter\nFinance Cookie Policy\nLaw Privacy Policy\nManagement Do Not Sell or Share My Personal\nInfo\nMarketing\nMathematics\nSociology\nStatistics\n\u00a9 Learneo, Inc. 2023 Course Sidekick is not sponsored or endorsed by any college or university."
