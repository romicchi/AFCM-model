Home Subjects\nBoundless Management\nLeadership\nTypes of Leaders\nTransactional Versus Transformational Leaders\nTransactional leaders are concerned about the status quo, while transformational leaders are more change-oriented.\nLearning Objectives\nDifferentiate between transactional leaders and transformational leaders in a full-range approach, particularly from a behavioral\nperspective\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nTransactional leadership works within set established goals and organizational boundaries, while a transformational approach challenges\nthe status quo and is more future-oriented.\nTransactional leadership emphasizes organization, performance evaluation and rewards, and is task- and outcome-oriented.\nTransformational leadership focuses on motivating and engaging followers with a vision of the future.\nKey Terms\nBuy-in: In management and decision making, the commitment of interested or affected parties (often called stakeholders) to agree to\nsupport a decision, often by having been involved in its formulation.\nLeadership can be described as transactional or transformational. Transactional leaders focuses on the role of supervision, organization,\nand group performance. They are concerned about the status quo and day-to-day progress toward goals. Transformational leaders work\nto enhance the motivation and engagement of followers by directing their behavior toward a shared vision. While transactional leadership\noperates within existing boundaries of processes, structures, and goals, transformational leadership challenges the current state and is\nchange-oriented.\nTransactional Leadership\nTransactional leadership promotes compliance with existing organizational goals and performance expectations through supervision and\nthe use of rewards and punishments. Transactional leaders are task- and outcome-oriented. Especially effective under strict time and\nresource constraints and in highly-specified projects, this approach adheres to the status quo and employs a form of management that\npays close attention to how employees perform their tasks.\nTransformational Leadership\nTransformational leadership focuses on increasing employee motivation and engagement and attempts to link employees' sense of self\nwith organizational values. This leadership style emphasizes leading by example, so followers can identify with the leader's vision and\nvalues. A transformational approach focuses on individual strengths and weaknesses of employees and on enhancing their capabilities\nand their commitment to organizational goals, often by seeking their buy-in for decisions.\nComparing Leadership Types\nTransactional and transformational leadership exhibit five key differences:\nTransactional leadership reacts to problems as they arise, whereas transformational leadership is more likely to address issues before they\nbecome problematic.\nTransactional leaders work within existing an organizational culture, while transformational leaders emphasize new ideas and thereby\n\"transform\" organizational culture.\nTransactional leaders reward and punish in traditional ways according to organizational standards; transformational leaders attempt to\nachieve positive results from employees by keeping them invested in projects, leading to an internal, high-order reward system.\nTransactional leaders appeal to the self-interest of employees who seek out rewards for themselves, in contrast to transformational\nleaders, who appeal to group interests and notions of organizational success.\nTransactional leadership is more akin to the common notions of management, whereas transformational leadership adheres more closely\nto what is colloquially referred to as leadership.\nKey Behaviors of Transactional Leaders\nTransactional leaders focus on performance, promote success with rewards and punishments, and maintain compliance with\norganizational norms.\nLearning Objectives\nIdentify the different behaviors attributed to transactional leaders and how they can motivate an organization\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nTransactional leaders focus on managing and supervising their employees and on group performance. They monitor their employees'\nwork carefully to assess any deviation from expected standards.\nTransactional leaders promote success by doling out both rewards and punishments contingent on performance.\nTransactional leaders work within existing organizational structures and shape their work according to the current organizational culture.\nKey Terms\nMaslow's Hierarchy of Needs: A psychological theory, proposed by Abraham Maslow in the 1943 paper \"A Theory of Human\nMotivation,\" which depicts lower- and higher-level human needs in the form of a pyramid.\nTransactional leaders focus on managing and supervising their employees and on facilitating group performance. The role of a\ntransactional leader is primarily passive, in that it sets policy and assessment criteria and then intervenes only in the event of performance\nproblems or needs for exceptions. Transactional leaders seek to maintain compliance within existing goals and expectations and the\ncurrent organizational culture. They are extrinsic motivators who encourage success through the use of rewards and punishment.\nBenchmarking Measures Performance: Results are the\nparamount concern to a transactional leader. Performance\nratings can be used to measure results.\nTransactional leaders are expected to do the following:\nSet goals and provide explicit guidance regarding what they expect from organizational members and how they will be rewarded for their\nefforts and commitment\nProvide constructive feedback on performance\nFocus on increasing the efficiency of established routines and procedures and show concern for following existing rules rather than\nmaking changes\nEstablish and standardize practices that will help the organization become efficient and productive\nRespond to deviations from expected outcomes and identify corrective actions to improve performance\nPsychologist Abraham Maslow characterized people's motivating factors in terms of needs. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs describes levels\nof needs ranging from the most essential, such as physiological (e.g., food and sleep) and safety, to higher levels of esteem and self-\nactualization. Transactional leadership satisfies lower-level needs but addresses those at a high level only to a limited degree. As such,\ntransactional leaders' behavior appeals to only a portion of followers' motivating factors.\nTransactional leadership can be very effective in the right settings. Coaches of sports teams are a good example of appropriate\ntransactional leadership. The rules for a sports team allow for little flexibility, and adherence to organizational norms is key; even so,\neffective coaches can motivate their team members to play and win, even at risk to themselves.\nKey Behaviors of Transformational Leaders\nTransformational leaders exhibit individualized consideration, intellectual stimulation, inspirational motivation, and idealized influence.\nLearning Objectives\nExplain the varying approaches and behaviors that define transformational leadership\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nTransformational leaders show individualized consideration to followers by paying attention to and meeting the needs of followers.\nTransformational leaders stimulate ideas and creativity from followers by creating a safe environment to challenge the status quo.\nTransformational leaders have a vision that inspires and motivates followers to achieve important goals.\nTransformational leaders serve as role models for their followers, allow them to identify with a shared organizational vision, and provide a\nsense of meaning and achievement.\nKey Terms\nTransformational Leadership: An approach to leading that enhances the motivation, morale, and performance of followers through a\nvariety of mechanisms.\nTransformational leaders challenge followers with an attractive vision and tie that vision to a strategy for its achievement. They engage\nand motivate followers to identify with the organization 's goals and values. Transformational leadership comprises four types of behavior:\nLeading the team: Transformational leaders\ninspire their employees to do more.\nIndividualized consideration or compassionate leadership\nIntellectual stimulation\nInspirational motivation\nIdealized influence or charismatic leadership\nIndividualized Consideration\nIndividualized consideration is the degree to which the leader attends to each follower's needs, acts as a mentor or coach to the follower,\nand listens to the follower's concerns. This behavior can include the following actions:\nDiscussing and empathizing with the needs of individual employees\nMaking interpersonal connections with employees\nShowing genuine compassion\nEncouraging ongoing professional development and personal growth of employees\nIntellectual Stimulation\nTransformational leaders encourage followers to be innovative and creative. Intellectual stimulation springs from leaders who establish\nsafe conditions for experimentation and sharing ideas. They tackle old problems in a novel fashion and inspire employees to think about\ntheir conventional methods critically and share new ideas. This type of behavior includes:\nEncouraging employees' creativity\nChallenging the status quo\nAiming for consistent innovation\nEmpowering employees to disagree with leadership\nRisk-taking when appropriate to achieve goals\nInspirational Motivation\nLeaders with an inspiring vision challenge followers to leave their comfort zones, communicate optimism about future goals, and provide\nmeaning for the task at hand. Purpose and meaning provide the energy that drives a group forward. The visionary aspects of leadership\nare supported by communication skills that make the vision understandable, precise, powerful, and engaging. Followers are willing to\ninvest more effort in their tasks; they are encouraged and optimistic about the future and believe in their abilities. Behaviors that\ndemonstrate inspirational motivation include:\nInspiring employees to improve their outcomes\nExplaining how the organization will change over time\nFostering a strong sense of purpose among employees\nLinking individual employee and organizational goals\nAiding employees to succeed to an even greater extent than they expect\nIdealized Influence\nTransformational leaders act as role models for their followers. Transformational leaders must embody the values that the followers should\nbe learning and internalizing. The foundation of transformational leadership is the promotion of consistent vision and values.\nTransformational leaders guide followers by providing them with a sense of meaning and challenge. They foster the spirit of teamwork\nand commitment in the following ways:\nPromoting a broad, inclusive vision\nLeading by example\nShowing strong commitment to goals\nCreating trust and confidence in employees\nRepresenting organizational goals, culture, and mission\nA Blended Approach to Leadership\nThe full-range leadership theory blends the features of transactional and transformational leadership into one comprehensive approach.\nLearning Objectives\nAssess the intrinsic value of blending transactional leadership behaviors with transformational leadership behaviors\nKey Takeaways\nKey Points\nTransactional and transformational leadership are not mutually exclusive, and leaders often demonstrate traits associated with both\napproaches.\nThe Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire is used in diagnosing leadership styles and for developing leadership.\nLeaders use elements of transformational and transactional leadership as the situation calls for them.\nKey Terms\nTransformational Leadership: A theory of leading that enhances the motivation, morale, and performance of followers through a variety\nof mechanisms.\nTransactional Leadership: A theory of leading that focuses on the role of supervision, organization, and group performance; leader\npromotes compliance through rewards and punishments. Also known as managerial leadership.\nThe full-range theory of leadership seeks to blend the best aspects of transactional and transformational leadership into one\ncomprehensive approach. Transactional leadership focuses on exchanges between leaders and followers. Transformational leadership\ndeals with how leaders help followers go beyond individual interests to pursue a shared vision. These two approaches are neither\nmutually exclusive, nor do leaders necessarily exhibit only one or the other set of behaviors. Depending on the objectives and the\nsituation, a leader may move from using one approach to the other as needed.\nManagement researcher Bernard Bass developed the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ), consisting of 36 items that reflect the\nleadership aspects associated with both approaches. The MLQ also includes several characteristics of a more passive leadership approach\nknown as laissez-faire. Respondents are asked to think about a leader they work with and to rate how frequently the individual exhibits\nthe leadership behaviors. The MLQ is used to help leaders discover how their followers perceive their behaviors, so they can develop their\nleadership abilities. The questionnaire is most effective with eight to twelve respondents, as this feedback gives leaders a broad set of\nperspectives from the people who interact with them.\nLicenses and Attributions\nPrevious Next\nFreshly uploaded management documents\nEthics in Financial Reporting.edited Rubric Topic 2 Becoming and being an effective\nleader Advocacy and Leadership\n(7041HSV3235)\nSOC110 Wk 5 Assessment MANAGEMENT-889-Slides MANAGEMENT-9257-Analysis\nSOC110 Wk 3 Assessment(1) The topic, aims, objectives and research Employee Turnover.edited\nquestions\nSUBJECTS LEGAL COMPANY CONNECT WITH US\nAccounting Copyright Policy Documents Sitemap Facebook\nBusiness Honor Code Study Guides Instagram\nCommunications Terms YouTube\nEconomics Academic Integrity Twitter\nFinance Cookie Policy\nLaw Privacy Policy\nManagement Do Not Sell or Share My Personal\nInfo\nMarketing\nMathematics\nSociology\nStatistics\n\u00a9 Learneo, Inc. 2023 Course Sidekick is not sponsored or endorsed by any college or university."
