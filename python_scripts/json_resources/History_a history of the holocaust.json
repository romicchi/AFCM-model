Keep dancing in heaven, Ava. I miss you all very\nmuch.\nThe entire project is mainly dedicated to Leon Stein, Ph.D.,\nProfessor Emeritus, Roosevelt University, whose guidance and\ninstruction made my work as a Holocaust scholar and professor\npossible. You believed in me first as an undergraduate, then as a\ngraduate student, and then as a professor. Thank you for your\ntraining and the gift of your knowledge and instruction in\nHolocaust and genocide studies. I learned from the very best.\nThe book is dedicated to the other survivors that I have had the\nhonor of knowing throughout my life. Thank you all for making\nthis work possible. To Diana, when I was a tiny girl, you gave me\na book on Corrie ten Boom and told me there will always be good\npeople in the world. You also told me never to apologize for\nstanding up against hate and injustice. To Stella, I am so grateful\nfor your advice, friendship, and kindness. To Deborah, Yvonne,\nand Ralph, I am grateful to both of you for being such good friends\nto me and always supporting my students.\nTo all of my students, past, present, and future: this book is for\nyou. Thank you for being a part of my academic work. All of you\ninspired me to create this project, and I am eternally appreciative.\nFinally, to my beautiful grandparents Marie and Francis. Thank\nyou for always encouraging me to reach for the stars, the moon,\nand the sun. Hug Arabella for me. 8\nAcknowledgements\nThere is more to thank with this second version of the OER, but\nthe rest of the list remains the same.\nThank you to Oakton College for the Teaching Learning\nEnhancement Project (TLEP) award that made a revision to the\nbook possible.\nThank you to Ellie Pearlman, whose volunteer work proved\ninvaluable, as she provided advice and assistance with the updated\nTable of Contents and editorial comments. Her friendship,\nscholarship, and guidance helped shape this new edition; as I had\ndone with Adam, we continually shared ideas back and forth,\nattended the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\n(USHMM) Belfer virtual conference together, and her feedback\nwas incredibly beneficial. Ellie contributed a critical new essay and\nproofread the manuscript. I am so proud of Ellie. Ellie\u2019s goal of\nteaching Holocaust Studies is coming closer, and I am delighted\nthat she is following in the footsteps of other scholars whose life\nwork is devoted to the subject. We must never forget, and Ellie is\nthe next generation to ensure that the topic is not forgotten.\nI remain indebted to Adam Yunis for volunteering to compile the\nfirst index for this text. He assisted with the original editing of the\nfirst edition. As a graduate student, Adam\u2019s help throughout this\nprocess cannot be underestimated. Adam was a critical part of the\nproject. Adam and I emailed dozens of times, bouncing ideas\naround and debating topics. When one author dropped out days\nbefore the deadline, Adam filled that critical gap. I learned from\nhis student\u2019s perspective and am humbly reminded that education\nis never finite. His essays were a critical component of the OER,\nand I am thankful for his scholarship, patience, and eye for detail.\nI must also thank my friend Brian D. Naimola for proofing the\noriginal manuscript and providing editorial comments and\ncorrections. Brian's assistance with proofreading the OER was a 9\ntremendous gift, and I am thankful for the hours he volunteered to\nhelp.\nTo my dear friends Wini and Robi Drell \u2026 a massive thank you\nfor being there and for your generosity towards my students and\nme. Philip had a tremendous impact on students when he came to\nspeak at Oakton, and I work to keep his legacy alive in my US\nHistory and Holocaust classes, as we see from Ameen Khan\u2019s\ntribute and the other mentions of him throughout the book. I thank\nyou both for allowing me to use his images in this text.\nI recognize and appreciate my anonymous reviewers who looked\nover the essays and made suggestions for inclusion, omission, and\ncorrection. I am humbled by the generosity shown to me and this\nproject.\nA thank you to all of my colleagues who contributed to this book.\nI thank my dear friend Katie for revising an essay that was\nespecially important to this project.\nI also thank Talia Langman at the ADL and Sherry Bard at Echoes\n& Reflections for their guidance and generosity in allowing me to\nreference resources.\nMy gratitude is deeply expressed to the Vancouver Holocaust\nEducation Centre for allowing quoted and other references to their\nwork.\nThe United States Holocaust Memorial Museum was also crucial\nfor my research, and I thank my friend Chelsea Halling-Nye for\nher contributions.\nA thank you to Danny M. Cohen for his contributions and\nkindnesses to my students at Oakton. 10\nI acknowledge and deeply appreciate NARA, who make sources\navailable for free use, such as the Eisenhower letter and the pink\ntriangle badge found within this text.\nA thank you to Kelley Szany, Vice President of Education and\nExhibitions, Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center, for\nallowing the reprinting of an important speech that she gave on an\nupstander that Adam Yunis had authored.\nI remain grateful to Robin Throne, Ph.D., whose expertise and\nsupport towards a qualitative approach in writing shaped this\nproject. I also thank Gregory Mullins, Ed.D., for his influence on\nthe shaping of understanding pseudo-transformational leadership\nand the dangers of authority.\nI must acknowledge the influence that historian Donald L. Niewyk\nhas had on me as a scholar. From as an undergraduate, first reading\nhis critical work The Holocaust: Problems and Perspective of\nInterpretation, to assigning it to my students, his writings have had\na major influence on me. It is a dedication to him and his work that\nthis book attempted to emulate. My twist on his approach was that\nI wanted to welcome my former students to contribute to this\ntextbook as I argue that academia and publishing must be more\ninclusive, no matter what stage of the academic journey one is on. I\nam so very honored of what my student contributors Ameen, Ellie,\nEmily, and Sarah, all proud Oakton alumni, accomplished. They\ntook on the challenge of authoring a piece for this OER and they\nall did such an amazing job with their respective works.\nI thank all the guest contributors, whose donation of their critical\nscholarship, first-hand accounts, and other works greatly enhanced\nthis unique book in a way that could not have been done otherwise.\nI am incredibly appreciative of you all.\nThe opinions expressed by the guest contributors are their own.\nShould anything come to your attention that needs correction,\nplease let me know. No matter how many times I read this book, 11\nthere were changes, which again, is reflective of the organic beauty\nof an OER, which can be adjusted and adapted as needed.\nAgain, I must acknowledge all of my students at Oakton College\nwho have either taken my Holocaust class or taken another class\nwith me, and the topic of World War Two, Nazi Germany, or the\nHolocaust came up. Our class discussions inspired me to take this\nchallenge on, and for that, I am grateful. This book is for all of\nyou, past, present, and future students. 12\nTable of Contents\nForeword 17\nIntroduction 23\nUnit One: Introduction to the Holocaust 29\nUnit Two: Antisemitism 36\n1.

I stand at the entrance of the archives at Yad\nVashem, Israel\u2019s Holocaust memorial and museum in Jerusalem.\nFrom her desk, an archivist looks up at me. \u201cI\u2019m looking for my\nfamily,\u201d I say. My heart is racing. The archivist lets out a cynical\nlaugh. \u201cYou\u2019ll never find them.\u201d\nI never met my Grandpa Maurice. A Jewish survivor of\nNazi-occupied Holland, he died when my mother was a young girl.\nAnd yet he is always with me; my middle name is Maurice. I am 9.\nI ask my mother to tell me the names of her great-grandparents.\nShe doesn\u2019t know. The gaps in my family\u2019s history create a\nmirrored silence inside of me. This is an inherited obstruction, as if\ncertain questions must be swallowed rather than spoken.\n\u201cAuschwitz is a must-see,\u201d my friend says, after a trip to\nPoland, as if having experienced some kind of Holocaust epiphany.\nI am 20 and I have no interest in visiting Auschwitz, or any site of\nNazi atrocity. The idea terrifies me. I imagine myself inside 18\ndeteriorating gas chambers. I don\u2019t want to be suffocated by the\nsight of disintegrating piles of human hair. I don\u2019t want that feeling\nof profound horror or numbing defeat. I don\u2019t want to stand where\nmy people\u2014or any people\u2014or my family\u2014choked to death. I\ndon\u2019t want to be seen trying to make sense of what can never be\nunderstood, or to feel obliged to pray or to sing or to be judged if I\ncan\u2019t burst into tears along with everyone else. I\u2019ve become\nfrightened of the ghosts of my grandfather\u2019s family. Surely, they\u2019ll\nonly recognize me as a disrespectful tourist, queuing for that\ncritically acclaimed attraction, that thrill-ride at Birkenau.\nI knew my grandfather through a handful of photographs.\nThe hand-me-down memories I have of him include a list of\nunrelated facts and anecdotes. I am 11. I stare at photographs of\nGrandpa on his wedding day. I know he went bald. I learn how to\npronounce his unusual Dutch surname, Ziekenoppasser. I overhear\npieces of his story, whispered at family events, when the adults\nthink I\u2019m not listening. My grandfather had escaped Nazi-Europe\nbefore the rest of his family\u2014all Jewish\u2014had been sent away. \u201cHe\nlost everyone,\u201d my uncle says. He says \u201clost,\u201d as if my grandfather 19\nhad misplaced his keys, or as if they had all wandered off in the\nwrong direction. But I know that \u201clost\u201d means they had been\nmurdered.\nI am 17. At Yad Vashem, the archivist behind the desk\nlaughs at me. Finding information about my murdered family will\nbe unlikely, she warns. I suppose she\u2019s trying to prepare me for\ndisappointment. But then she adds, \u201cUnless they were Dutch.\u201d My\nneck feels hot. \u201cYes, they were from The Netherlands,\u201d Again, the\narchivist laughs. \u201cStill, you\u2019ll never find them. Unless they had an\nunusual name.\u201d I nod my head. \u201cZiekenoppasser.\u201d The archivist,\nno longer laughing, stands and lead me to the books of the dead.\nI am 42. I am a parent now. And I teach about hidden\nHolocaust histories. I write and teach about the Nazis\u2019 forced\nsterilizations of people of African, Roma, and Jewish descent and\npeople with disabilities, which ran in parallel to the U.S.\ngovernments\u2019 forced sterilizations of people with disabilities and\nBlack, Latina, and Native American women throughout the\ntwentieth century; the Holocaust was an extreme case of White\nSupremacy. When I teach about the Nazis\u2019 use of gas chambers to 20\nmurder entire Jewish families and Jewish communities, I support\nmy students to explore why Holocaust education and\ncommemoration rarely include stories of the Nazis\u2019 Roma and\ndisabled victims who were also murdered in the Nazi gas\nchambers. I teach about the Nazis\u2019 persecution of homosexuals and\nabout sexual violence in the Nazi camps, and I help my students to\nidentify connections between Nazi ideology and contemporary\nhomophobia, transphobia, and misogyny.\nI am 35. My suitcase is packed for my first visit to the site\nof Auschwitz. In general terms, I know what to expect. I\u2019ve studied\nthe photographs of the camp and read the books and taken the\nonline virtual tour. I have a good idea of what I\u2019ll see. But I don\u2019t\nknow how I\u2019ll respond in the moment or how I might be changed\nby this journey. Part of me fears being entirely overwhelmed. Part\nof me fears feeling nothing. Part of me expects, at nighttime, to\nslip back into the surreal Holocaust nightmares of my childhood.\nWe walk in shadows of shadows. We grow up surrounded\nby silence. Perpetrators of violence hide and deny their crimes, and\nbystanders in positions of power pretend that they couldn\u2019t have 21\ntaken a stand against them. Only certain narratives make it into our\ncollective memories and, even then, they are too often\noversimplified into tales of good versus evil, heroes versus\nmonsters. But the truth is dark. Someone\u2019s father drives the train to\nthe Nazi camp. Someone\u2019s sister whips the prisoners. Someone\u2019s\nmother injects lethal chemicals into the veins of her patients.\nSomeone\u2019s son pours the pellets of Zyklon B into the gas chambers\nfilled with other people\u2019s children. Too often we forget that the\nHolocaust was perpetrated by humans against other humans.\nI stand at the ruins of Gas Chamber III at Birkenau and I\nrecite to my group the little I know of my family\u2019s story. I am 35.\nAs I speak, I wonder if this was exactly where my cousins were\nmurdered. Suddenly, unexpectedly, I\u2019m struck with the realization\nthat I will likely return to Auschwitz a number of times in my life.\nI am no longer scared. This is my family\u2019s history. This is my\nhistory. This is my daughter\u2019s history.\nI am 17. I stand in the archives at Yad Vashem. The\narchivist takes me to the books of the dead. In the final book, on\nthe final pages, we find Ziekenoppasser\u2014Ziekenoppasser\u2014 22\nZiekenoppasser\u2014a list of men and women, all with the last name\nZiekenoppasser, dates of birth\u2014Ziekenoppasser\u2014places of\nbirth\u2014Ziekenoppasser\u2014Ziekenoppasser\u2014Ziekenoppasser\u2014\ndeported from Amsterdam and other Dutch cities and towns\u2014\nZiekenoppasser\u2014Ziekenoppasser\u2014murdered at Sobibor\u2014\nZiekenoppasser\u2014murdered at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Sobibor.\nSobibor. Ziekenoppasser. Auschwitz. Ziekenoppasser. Auschwitz.\nAuschwitz. Auschwitz. Ziekenoppasser. I reach to pick up the\nbook, but the archivist stops me. She carries the book, cradles it\nlike a newborn baby, to the photocopier. I fax the pages to my\nmother and my uncles in London. But they don\u2019t know these\nnames. My grandfather hadn\u2019t told them enough. Either these men\nand women are strangers\u2014someone else\u2019s family\u2014or they belong\nto my family\u2019s lost memories. 23\nIntroduction\nWendy Adele-Marie\nThis textbook, an Open Educational Resource (OER), is\ndedicated to the community college student and to the community\nwe serve. Writing this book during a pandemic has lent pathos to\nthis project. So many of us have lost loved ones and have been\naway from normalcy. Reflecting on that, I think about my beloved\nfriend, everyone\u2019s grandma, and Holocaust survivor Magda\nBrown. As Magda said to my student in late March 2020, right\nafter the pandemic began, that you have to have - and these are her\nexact words as she typed them in response to a question my student\nasked: \u201cThank you for paying close attention to my testimony and\nremembering many details. I want to share with you the words I\nlive by. YOU HAVE TO HAVE FAITH, FANTASY, DRIVE,\nDETERMINATION, AND BELIEF THAT TOMORROW WILL\nBE BETTER.\u201d Magda\u2019s words serve us all well. Sadly, we lost\nMagda in July 2020. She was a much-loved member of our\ncommunity, and her drive for Holocaust education was a global\ninspiration to everyone. 24\nFollowing Magda\u2019s example, I note that I have been\nteaching the Holocaust since 2002, and what I have learned since,\nand regret much, is that the cost of textbooks is a systemic barrier\nto higher education. Thus, a primary goal with creating this OER\nwas to develop an affordable, applicable, adaptable, creative, and\nhelpful resource. The OER is meant to introduce the subject and a\nprimer to topics not often discussed and include many\ncontributions from my former students, new researchers, my\ncolleagues, and noted scholars in the field. The subject matter\nincluded in this book is rich in topics and varied in scope.\nFor the students having a free sourcebook that can serve as\na research guide will benefit them. Also, it can serve as a reminder\nof the critical objectives taught in a Holocaust class, supporting the\ndevelopment of student\u2019s critical thinking and emotional literacy\nby providing a framework by which they can challenge\nmisconceptions. The guide is by no means perfect. There are more\nsubject to be added, and corrections to be made. That is the beauty\nof an open-educational resource. The author can adjust, make 25\nadditions, and complete deletions. New information comes out and\nfrom the rarest of places.\nRecently, Wendy Lower\u2019s groundbreaking new book, The\nRavine: a Family, a Photograph, a Holocaust Massacre Revealed\nwas published. It took ten years, but Lower, 80 years after the\nmurder of a mother and a child at the hands of Nazi collaborators,\nsaw that the woman and her child's identity emerged. Through her\nobservation and action research engagement, Lower discovered a\npreviously unknown third victim, a tiny baby whose hand is barely\nvisible in the photograph, as the baby was hidden in the mother's\nlower body. Last, Lower tracked down who took the image. The\nphotographer was a member of the Slovakian resistance. The\nperpetrators\u2019 identities were also exposed. Through rich\nobservation and action research, Lower created a thematic\nframework that resulted in a groundbreaking qualitative study.\nHolocaust education is not finite. There are more topics to\nbe covered, and uncovered; thus, I will add more chapters so the\nreader can expect more additions. Note that citations may also be\nadded, updated, or deleted. I welcome suggestions for future 26\ncontent. If you are interested in contributing an entry, feel free to\nreach out to me. This OER was truly a community effort, and I am\ngrateful to everyone who was a part of this servant leadership\nproject to make a difference and provide a free educational\nresource. The mission and vision of this OER emerged based on\nmy work within the Jewish Studies concentration that I founded in\n2012 at Oakton College.\nThe mission of this text is to uphold a strategic obligation\nto teach Holocaust studies to future generations within a fair,\ntolerant, and academic environment founded on the principles of\npatience, justice, accountability, empathy, and honesty.\nThe vision is clear, as the book demonstrates its\ndetermination to offer a guide to promote critical thinking about\nthe Holocaust. To achieve the mission and vision of the text, the\nspecific goals are as follows. The first goal affirms a commitment\nto Holocaust education. The second goal promotes the study of the\nsubject and provides a free, approachable text for students to learn\nfrom to work towards preventing ignorance, stop hate, racism,\nantisemitism, and anti-immigrant prejudices. The third goal 27\nencourages inclusive discourse encouraged for its student\npopulation via academic research, live seminars, and guided\nlearning communities.\nResearch supports this need for an approachable text that\nnot only teaches students about the dangers of hate but critically,\nthey must be instructed in what motivated the perpetrators.\nLearning about motivation is an essential element to help students\nunderstand motivations and state-sponsored rewards for\nperpetrators and their relationship to the victimization of those\ndesignated as undesirables. We will see how genocidal precursors\ninfluenced Nazi racialist and gender ideologies and practices and\nhow the Holocaust threatened the collapse of humanistic values.\nFor students, learning about the Holocaust can broaden\nhistorical and ethical horizons through a wide variety of sources,\nincluding historical documentation and testimony. My hope and\ngoal are to engage the reader and challenge them to continue\nstudying the subject. As ongoing pedagogical research shows,\nagain, we must lead students towards the intellectual skills needed 28\nto understand how the Nazis came to power, how the Holocaust\nevolved and how ordinary people can make a difference.\nRecommendation for further reading\nKeen, A.

The Holocaust was an intentional,\nsystematic, bureaucratic, nearly successful ideological attempt to\nmurder the Jews totally and cosmically because they existed.\nA central act of state undertaken by the Nazis and collaborators,\nthe Holocaust occurred when six million Jews and five million\nothers were murdered systematically by the Nazi regime (1933\u2013\n1945) and their collaborators. In 2023, the United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum (USHMM) has updated the definition to state\nthat the Holocaust was \u201cthe state-sponsored, systematic\npersecution and annihilation of European Jews by Nazi Germany\nand its collaborators between 1933 and 1945\u201d (United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum, 2023). Xenophobic agrarian-\noriented ideology dictated this need to cleanse the German race by\nthe complete annihilation of all Jews and the cosmic destruction of\nJudaism. The Nazis also murdered five million non-Jews; in 2023\nthe USHMM stated that \u201cRoma, people with disabilities, and Poles 30\nwere targeted for destruction or decimation for racial, ethnic, or\nnational reasons. Millions more, including gay men, Jehovah\u2019s\nWitnesses, Soviet prisoners of war, and political dissident also\nsuffered severe oppression and death under Nazi tyranny\u201d (United\nStates Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2023).\nThe word \u201cHolocaust\u201d was derived from the\nLatin holocaustum, and the Greek holokauston (burnt whole). Due\nto internal accusations and state disorder post WWI, coupled with\neconomic deprivation, hardship, and more, it was part of the reason\nwhy we see the ascent of Hitler and the Nazis. Hitler was\nappointed Chancellor in January 1933 and became F\u00fchrer in\nAugust 1934, after he \u201camalgamated the office of president and\ntook control of the armed forces\u201d (Adele-Marie, 2005). Further,\nresistance to the Nazis was crushed, and many dissidents\nwere sent to concentration camps. The ubiquitous Gestapo\nkept tabs on the population, but the state was not\ncharacterized solely by repression by any means. In the\nfirst several years, Hitler was carried forward on a wave\nof disillusionment with the Weimar Republic, and a 31\nplebiscite showed that a solid majority of Germans\napproved of his actions. Almost on assuming political\npower, Hitler initiated actions against the Jews. They were\nturned into a race of \"untouchables\" within their own\nstate, unable to pursue certain careers and a public life.\nThe Nuremberg Laws of 1935 defined as Jewish anyone\nwith one Jewish grandparent. That a terrible fate would be\ntheir lot was clear in Hitler's remarks that war in Europe\nwould lead to the \u201cextinction of the Jewish race in\nEurope.\u201d (Adele-Marie, 2005)\nNo Jews were safe. The Nazis targeted all Jews, as the regime's\nprimary goal was to exterminate every single Jew in the world and\nwipe out Judaism itself (Adele-Marie, 2009). Once the Jews were\ngone, the Nazis were intent on systematically eliminating millions\nof others, scaffolding their victims to include the disabled,\nJehovah's Witnesses, Catholics, African-Germans, the LGBTQ\ncommunity, and many others (Adele-Marie, 2009). For the non-\nJewish victims of the Nazis, the regime 32\nclassified Jews as the priority \u201cenemy,\u201d the Nazi\nideological concept of race targeted other groups for\npersecution, imprisonment, and annihilation, including\nRoma, people with disabilities, Poles, Soviet\nprisoners of war and Afro-Germans. The Nazis also\nidentified political dissidents, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, Gay\nmen, and others. The Nazis also used the term asocial. This\nwas used, for example, for anyone that did not fit any of\ntheir other categories were asocial. These people were all\nseen as enemies and security risks either because they\nconsciously opposed the Nazi regime, or some aspect of\ntheir behavior did not fit Nazi perceptions of social norms.\nThey sought to eliminate domestic non-conformists and so-\ncalled racial threats through a perpetual self-purge of\nGerman society. (United States Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum, 2019)\nThe Holocaust demonstrates the banality of human evil and\nchallenges us to confront human behavior. When people do not\nstand up to aggressors, actions against their targets begin, and, 33\nbecause of the silence of the general and international\npopulace, genocide emerges. Analysis of the regime's intent\nindicated that the Nazis - who had a psychic obsession with\nthe Jews - intentionally chose the Jews first for separation,\nthen removal, and then destruction. Adolf Hitler's objective\n(1889\u20131945) to obliterate the Jews and others designated as\nenemies of the state. Destruction was facilitated by\nacceptance, industry, and a failure by the world to\nintervene. Moreover, the Holocaust marked an\nindustrialized nation that used the first-time advanced\ntechnology to commit mass murder on such an immense\nscale. (Adele-Marie, 2009)\nEven if people did not follow Nazi beliefs, or acted as impassive\ncitizens (or, at worse, total bystanders), many were convinced\nbecause of what both Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl and author\nDiana Stirling referred to as the implied psychology of fear (Kohl,\n2011).\nKnown as the \u201cpsychology of coercion,\u201d the Nazis used\nhistorical antisemitism, fear, projected hysteria, and coercion to 34\n\"justify\" actions against six million Jews and millions of others,\neven blaming the Jews for having brought the war upon Germany\nas seen with speeches given by Hitler and his cohorts (Kohl, 2011).\nThe Nazis would have 42,500 concentration camps, ghettos, and\nthe six killing centers (formerly known as extermination camps) to\ncarry out unprecedented genocide. Unit two begins with a look at\nthe origins of antisemitism and connects it with the Holocaust.\nReferences\nAdele-Marie, W. (2005). Adolf Hitler. In S.

Elie\nWiesel, Holocaust Survivor\nBefore beginning this chapter, I recommend that the reader\npause, and watch this 14-minute film from the Echoes &\nReflections video toolbox, linked here Antisemitism, and also\nfound here:\nhttp://echoesandreflections.org/video_toolbox/?testvid=1\n(Echoes and Reflections, 2021).\nFrom a lesson that I had developed on antisemitism, I have\nexplained to my students that a stereotype is a distorted\ngeneralization about a person or group. Stereotypes are particularly\ndangerous because they express very negative things about a group\nof people (e.g., violent, greedy). Such stereotypes perpetuate\nhateful attitudes, hurt individuals, and damage entire communities.\nAntisemitism may take the form of rhetoric that proclaims the 37\ninferiority of Jews, their supposedly evil nature, or perpetrates\nother negative ideas about Jews. It may include political efforts to\nisolate, oppress, or otherwise injure them. It may also include\nprejudiced or other stereotyped views about Jews derived from\nhate or other harmful ideologies.\nHistorian John Weiss established five stages of\nantisemitism in his essay \u201cAntisemitism through the Ages,\u201d and he\nlists these stages:\n1. Christian antisemitism (many reject this).\n2. Commercial (\u201cJews were plagued for centuries by\naccusations that they innately preferred to exploit and\nmanipulate others through dishonest commercial practices\nand usurious moneylending), economic crises of war.\n3. Jews were associated with liberalism and progressivism.\nFailed revolution of 1848 to establish national political\nrepresentation.\n4. Anthropology (based on perceived and false racial\ndifferences, physical characteristics, intellect, and morality)\n5. Ethnic nationalism. (Niewyk, 1997) 38\nWhat stands out to me about antisemitism are those courageous\nsurvivors who fought \u2013 and still fight \u2013 against it.\nOne event was a stark reminder of what antisemitism leads\nto when my dear friend Magda Brown told me about a day in\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which was covered by The Washington\nPost. The Post stated that \u201cIn times like these we look to our elders\nto sort things out, to put things in perspective\u201d (Zak, 2018).\nFurther, The Post cited how \u201cMagda Brown has faced far worse\nthan a country gone crazy with guns. She has a scarred bump on\nher left foot, from the wooden slippers at Auschwitz. Every step is\na reminder\u201d (Zak, 2018). Magda survived Auschwitz and\nAllendorf, a sub-camp of Buchenwald.\nIn 2018, as I was heading to Oakton to teach my class on\nthe History of the Holocaust, I had just heard about the mass\nshootings in Pittsburgh at the Tree of Life synagogue. I thought, oh\nno - Magda was there or was on her way there to speak in the\ncontext of her work as a survivor. I thought she would postpone. I\nstarted my Holocaust class and had an idea to call Magda and put\nher on speaker to talk live with my students about what had 39\nhappened. What occurred next was unexpected. I briefly spoke to\nRochelle, Magda\u2019s daughter, and she put her mother on the phone.\nMagda said that she could not talk, she was about to go through\nTSA at the airport. The entire class all asked her where are you\ngoing? She said \u201cI am going to Pittsburgh! They need me more\nthan ever before.\u201d My students and I were in awe of her courage.\nThis excerpt is from her website:\nin October 2018, Magda was scheduled to speak at\nChatham University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The tragic\nshooting at the Tree of Life synagogue took place the day\nbefore. Magda didn\u2019t hesitate to board the plane to\nPittsburgh, saying, \u201cNow the world needs to hear the\nmessage even more. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Magda\u2019s experience was\ncovered by and a variety of other media outlets, reaching\nmillions of people. (Brown, 2021)\nAntisemitism is on the rise. As Elie Wiesel said, it has not gone\naway. In her critical essay, that follows historian Sherry Bard\nexplains antisemitism, why we must learn about it, and she\nprovides additional resources for further research and 40\ninvestigation. Before you move on to the next section, pause here\nto read this essay Antisemitism (Echoes and Reflections, 2021a). It\nwill be critical to an understanding antisemitism, and the role that\nit had in the Holocaust.\nReferences\nBrown, M. (2021, January 11).

Furrow, Jr. walked into the\nlobby of the North Valley Jewish Community Center in Granada\nHills, California, a few miles from where I live, and opened fire\nwith a machine gun, firing 70 bullets. Five people were wounded,\nthree children, a teenage counselor, and an office worker. After the\nshooter left the scene, he drove around and shot and killed a mail\ncarrier and then fled the state before surrendering to authorities. As\nmy family and friends watched in shock as the events unfolded on\nthe news that day, we could not believe that this violent expression\nof hate was happening in our own backyard. The trauma of that\nmemory remains with us today.\nSeveral years later, in 2014, Holocaust survivor, scholar and\nauthor Elie Wiesel shared the following thoughts on the enduring\nnature of antisemitism and its ultimate consequence :\nOnce I thought that anti-Semitism had ended; today it is\nclear to me that it will probably never end. It might weaken 43\nsometimes, but it will continue existing, because in\ndifferent countries there is no shame in being an anti-\nSemite. We must remember that anti-Semitism led to\nAuschwitz. Without anti-Semitism there would have been\nno Auschwitz (Wiesel, 2014).\n\u201cNever again\u201d\nLike many survivors, Elie Wiesel had hoped that after the\nHolocaust the world would have come to recognize the dangers of\nantisemitism, and that the often-uttered mantra, \u201cnever again,\u201d\nwould become a reality. However, as we know, genocides continue\nand antisemitism, the hatred that fueled the Holocaust, persists.\nToday, we are witnessing an alarming rise in antisemitism,\nstoked by current political rhetoric and divisions. According to the\nSouthern Poverty Law Center, there are now more than 1,600\nextremist groups operating across the country, many of which\nespouse antisemitic beliefs. These groups are spreading their\nmessages of hate and recruiting new followers by leveraging\nonline tools, including various social media platforms, many of\nwhich do not regulate their content. One such movement, QAnon, 44\nwhich has captured recent headlines for its global conspiracy\ntheories and antisemitic undertones, was designated as a \u201cdomestic\nterror threat\u201d by the FBI in 2019.\nAccording to the Anti-Defamation League, since 2016, the\nUnited States has experienced a sharp and alarming rise in\nantisemitic acts. In its Audit of Antisemitic Incidents 2020, the\nmost recent report to date, there were more than 2,000 recorded\nincidents of violence, harassment and vandalism against Jews.\nWhile antisemitic incidents declined by 4% in 2020 as compared to\nthe previous year, 2019 saw the largest number since ADL began\ntracking this data more than forty years ago.\nWhy the Jews?\nThe question of why people hate Jews is certainly perplexing\nand one we may never truly understand. Is it that people perceive\nJews as different from themselves? Elie Wiesel concluded that the\nendurance of antisemitism remains a mystery and described it as an\n\u201cirrational disease.\u201d\nThe term \u201cantisemitism\u201d was first coined in Germany in the\n19th century by Wilhelm Marr. Echoes & Reflections, an 45\neducational program and partnership of the Anti-Defamation\nLeague, USC Shoah Foundation, and Yad Vashem, defines it as\nhatred of Jews as a group or concept. To understand the meaning\nof \u201cconcept\u201d in this definition, consider that while Jews today\nmake up less than 1% of the world population, actually just .2%,\nindividuals can hold antisemitic beliefs without ever having met a\nJewish person. These attitudes can be based on stereotypes,\nmisinformation, and falsehoods. In other words, antisemitic\nattitudes can exist in places where there are few or no Jews\nresiding.\nA new or old phenomenon?\nAntisemitism is undoubtedly not a new phenomenon. The\nlate historian Robert Wistrich dubbed antisemitism \u201cthe longest\nhatred,\u201d given that it\u2019s been around for more than 2,000 years.\nThroughout history, antisemitism has taken on different forms.\nIt is influenced and shaped by the time and place in which it occurs\nas well as by culture, beliefs and events. However, there are key\nmotifs or myths, that are constant. For example, Jews have been\naccused of being in league with the devil. 46\nThe roots of antisemitism date back to the beginning of\nChristianity. During this time, leaders in the Catholic hierarchy\nheld Jews responsible for the crucifixion of Christ and believed\nthat they deserved to be punished for not denouncing their faith\nand accepting Christianity.\nOver time, Jews have been blamed for many of humanity\u2019s\nshortfalls and natural disasters. For example, during the Middle\nAges, Jews were blamed for the Black Death and poisoning wells.\nWe also saw the emergence of blood libels against the Jews during\nthis time, another myth that endures today. Blood libel is the\nnotion that Jews lure and kidnap Christian children to use their\nblood for Jewish rituals, such as making matzo (unleavened bread)\nfor the Passover holiday. Today, there are those who believe that\nJews were responsible for the 9/11 attacks and for the Covid-19\npandemic.\nThe most widely circulated and perhaps most notorious\nantisemitic publication is the book Protocols of the Elders of Zion,\nwhich was first published in 1905. It was said to be the secret\nminutes of a Jewish council meeting plotting world domination. In 47\nreality, the publication was a hoax carried out by the Russian secret\npolice. Over the past century, this discredited document has been\ntranslated into dozens of languages and spread worldwide. Here in\nthe United States, Henry Ford, the founder of Ford Motor\nCompany, translated the document into English and printed it in\nhis newspaper, the Dearborn Independent, in the 1920s. Some\ntoday teach the Protocols as fact.\nThe Holocaust is certainly history\u2019s most extreme example of\nantisemitism. The innovation to antisemitism that was central to\nNazi ideology were the ideas about race. The Nazis declared the\nAryan race superior, pure, strong and good and the Jews demonic\nand inferior, intent on world domination. Moreover, Jews made up\nless than 1% of the population in Germany before World War II,\nand over 100,000 of them had fought for their country during\nWorld War I.\nHow does hate spread?\nHow did the Nazis spread their antisemitic messages? They\ntook control of the media, including newspapers and radio, to\nspread hateful propaganda about the Jews. In addition to adults, 48\nchildren were a key target audience. Teachers were required to join\nthe Nazi Party, and Nazi ideology was taught in school.\nThe theoretical aspects of race education were thought to be\ncomplex for young children to grasp, so the Nazis used familiar\ndevices such as fairytales to help children more easily understand\nand embrace antisemitism. An example is The Poisonous\nMushroom, which was published in 1938 by Julius Streicher. The\nbook focuses on the corrupt and evil nature of Jews. It uses the\nmushroom as a metaphor for Jews proclaiming that it is very hard\nto distinguish between poisonous mushrooms and edible ones and\nthat they can spread all over the place without control, just like the\nJews.\nIn the aftermath of the Holocaust, additional antisemitic\nideas have taken hold including denial and distortion of the\nHolocaust. This can range from the assertion that the Holocaust\ndidn\u2019t happen, to accusations that the number of Jews murdered is\ngreatly exaggerated. In addition, there are those who say that there\nwere no gas chambers, and that people died of natural causes, even\nthough the Holocaust is perhaps the most widely documented 49\nevent in history, much of which was detailed by the perpetrators\nthemselves. Deniers say that Jews lie about the Holocaust in order\nto get money and to have a State (Israel). Another recent idea\nbeing spread is termed the \u201cNew Antisemitism,\u201d which is the\ndelegitimization and demonization of Israel and its people.\nWhere do we go from here?\nOn October 27, 2018, we witnessed the attack on the Tree of\nLife Synagogue, in Pittsburgh, in which 11 worshippers were\nmurdered and six others injured. Two years later, Audrey\nGlickman, who survived the shooting told the Pittsburgh Post-\nGazette that \u201cWhen Jews say of the departed, \u2018may their memory\nbe for a blessing,\u2019 the word \u2018for\u2019 is crucial \u2014 moving from\nmemory to future action. The people we lost have a legacy,\u201d she\nsaid. \u201cIt\u2019s on us now to continue to not only build ourselves but\nbuild on the legacy that was left to us\u201d (Smith, 2021).\nIn a recent interview on CBS This Morning, Jonathan\nGreenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League made the\nfollowing remark about contemporary antisemitism and how he\nthinks we need to respond: \u201cI think we\u2019re now moving into a 50\ndangerous new phase and it is going to require government and\nbusiness and civil society to work hand in hand to lock arms to\npush back on the surge of prejudice\u201d (Greenblatt, 2021).\nRising antisemitism is a bellwether, a warning sign of issues\nthat can have far-reaching and long-lasting effects. As Samantha\nPower, author and former ambassador to the United Nations notes,\n\u201cRising anti-Semitism is rarely the lone or the last expression of\nintolerance in a society\u201d (Power, 2014).\nHer statement reminds us that if antisemitism and other forms\nof hatred are ever going to end, we have to be vigilant. And, as\nElie Wiesel warned,\nWe must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never\nthe victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the\ntormented. Sometimes we must interfere. When human\nlives are endangered, when human dignity is in jeopardy,\nnational borders and sensitivities become irrelevant.\nWherever men and women are persecuted because of their\nrace, religion, or political views, that place must - at that 51\nmoment - become the center of the universe (Wiesel,\n2014).\nAs a society, perhaps our most critical obligation is to\nremember that we are all interconnected and need stand up for one\nother.\nNote: Throughout this article, the term antisemitism is written\nas both antisemitism and anti-Semitism. The author has chosen the\nversion \u201cantisemitism,\u201d which is how the Anti-Defamation League\nexpresses this term. Anti-Semitism was used only when it was part\nof a quote.

In YNet News.\nhttps://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-\n4481912,00.html 56\nUnit Three: The Backgrounds to and Stages of Genocide\nWendy Adele-Marie\nAuthor and attorney Raphael Lemkin in 1933 wanted an\ninternational treaty against genocide. In 1944, he defined the word\ngenocide in his book, Axis Rule in Occupied Europe. Genocide is\ndefined as the systematic destruction of a nation or ethnic group\nvia direct or indirect means. How does genocide start? There are\nanswers and many nuances to the subject, but we can begin to\napproach the topic in this way by scaffolding the topic.\nHate can be emotional, reactive, and stir up sentiments such\nas anger and blame. If something is going badly for an individual,\nor if a collective group has an issue about anything, whether micro\nor macro, hate can lead to blaming, and that need to blame\nsomeone for whatever the group is upset about can quickly lead to\ncrimes against humanity. Hate is historical, as are abuses,\ncolonization, enslavement, racism, torture, separation, segregation,\nand assignation of blame. Jews and others have been targeted for\nmillennia. Genocide has occurred since ancient times, as historian\nR.J. Rummel wrote about in his work Power Kills. Rummel noted 57\nhow propaganda led him to draw false and dangerous information\nabout specific groups as a young student. Rummel (1997) further\nelaborated that he was driven to undertake quantitative research to\nunderstand how genocide and mass murder has killed more people\nthan war. Rummel (1997) combines the words genocide and mass\nmurder into the word democide, meaning murder of an\nunprecedent scale. In Power Kills, which has been digitized, he\noutlines how many tens of millions of people worldwide have been\nkilled as a result of democide. Rummel (1997) noted the origins of\nhow he began his research and how the word democide emerged:\nMy true interest was in understanding and doing\nsomething about the legal killing called war and it was a\nhappy surprise to discover that I could actually focus my\nstudies on the history, conditions, and causes of war.\nThrough undergraduate and graduate term papers, my MA\nthesis and Ph.D. dissertation in 1963, and the research\nsince, this has been my ultimate concern. This research has\ntaken numerous paths and has expanded to understand\nviolence and conflict generally and their possible 58\nexplanations, but always down the road and until recent\nyears I hoped to have something specific to recommend\nabout ending war. But in the mid-1980s I was shocked to\ndiscover that several times more people were killed in\ndemocide (genocide and mass murder) by governments\nthan died in warfare. And with that my aim broadened to\nhelp end or at least lessen this killing as well. This book\npresents the sum of that research. And, I believe, I finally\ncan offer what appears a most realistic and practical\nsolution to war, democide, and other collective violence.\n(Rummel, 1997, para. 11)\nSo then, how did Hitler kill millions of people? Start with this\nessay: Without Hitler, would there have been a Holocaust? by Sir\nIan Kershaw Then, to understand the logic behind the statement,\nno Hitler, no Holocaust, consider that \u201cthe Holocaust took place\nbecause individuals, groups, and nations made decisions to act or\nnot to act\u201d (USHMM, 2021). Rummel also explained that\nGenocide is foremost an international crime for which\nindividuals, no matter how high in authority, may be 59\nindicted, tried, and punished by the International Criminal\nCourt (ICC). According to Article 6 of the ICC Statute,\nThis crime involves, \"any of the following acts committed\nwith intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national,\nethnical, racial or religious group, as such:\n(a) Killing members of the group;\n(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to\nmembers of the group;\n(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions\nof life calculated to bring about its physical\ndestruction in whole or in part;\n(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births\nwithin the group;\n(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to\nanother group. (Rummel, 2019)\nRummel (2013) suggested that in addition to the six million Jews\nkilled by the Nazis, that the regime was responsible for upwards of\n20,000,000 deaths.\nRummel used a picture from the Nuremberg Trials to show\nhow the Nazis calculated how countless peoples they murdered,\nnoting that although the Nazis destroyed many records, enough 60\nremained intact that documented ongoing genocide during war,\nwhich Rummel classified as a democide.\nDated from January of 1942, this image with an overview\nof Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Russia, the\nEinsatzgruppe A [task forces, special action groups] note by the\ncoffins how many Jews they killed. In Estonia, they wrote the\nword Judenfrei, which means free of Jews.\n(International Military Tribunal's Office of the United States Chief of Counsel\nFor Prosecution of Axis Criminality, 1946).\nThe above crude map clearly outlined both intent and\naftermath. How do governments convince ordinary people to\nperpetrate such horrific crimes? There are stages of genocide, and 61\npropaganda plays a key role in introducing, implementing, and\ndenying genocide. Whether propaganda is presented in images,\nfilm, radio addresses or speeches, it can be effective. Nazi\npropaganda was certainly used to perpetrate genocide. Here, we\nwill look at some examples of Nazi propaganda images.\nBelow is an image from the children\u2019s book The Poisonous\nMushroom (Der Giftpilz) that the Nazis created for children. Here,\nthe Jew is portrayed as a poisonous mushroom, noting it is\nimpossible to ascertain among the mushrooms \u2013 standing in for\nJews \u2013 who are good and who are bad. The implication is why take\na chance on any of these mushrooms? If one cannot be trusted to\nbe safe, how can any be trusted at all?\n(Echoes & Reflections, 2021). 62\nHere is another propaganda image developed by the Nazis to\nfalsely depict Jews as a threat to children:\n(Echoes & Reflections, 2021).\nThe pictures show that Nazis wanted to portray the Jews as\na threat to Aryan children. Echoes & Reflections stated that this\nimage, also taken from The Poisonous Mushroom, states: \u201cHere\nmy little one, you get something very sweet, but as a reward you\nboth must come with me\u201d (Echoes & Reflections, 2021). Thus, the\nimage was a threat to all parents who feared that something would\nhappen to their children. Another image alleges to show contrast\nbetween an Aryan man and a Jewish man: 63\n(Echoes & Reflections, 2021).\nThe Aryan is presented as strong and fit, with a clear gaze. In\ncontrast, the Jewish man is falsely depicted as out of shape,\nunclean, and with a strange look in his eyes. Propagandic images\nsuch as the ones above classified the Jews as treacherous.\nThe Nazis continually classified Jews as enemies and\ndangerous. Symbolization was used to further antisemitism. Jews\nwere discriminated against and dehumanized through various\nways, from legal, as seen in the 1935 passage of the Nuremberg\nLaws. The Nazis organized actions against Jews, polarized them\nfrom German and later European society. Preparation for the 64\nHolocaust began when the Nazis established the first concentration\ncamp, Dachau, built in March 1933. Persecution of the Jews and\nothers had been ongoing since the regime came to power and\nescalated. Extermination began in earnest with the killing centers\n(formerly known as extermination camps). However, millions died\nin the ghettos and concentration camps, which the Nazis had, in\ntotal, 42,500. Denial began during the Holocaust and continues to\nthis day. Here are the ten stages of genocide:\nTen stages of genocide:\n1. Classification.\n2. Symbolization.\n3. Discrimination.\n4. Dehumanization.\n5. Organization.\n6. Polarization.\n7. Preparation.\n8. Persecution.\n9. Extermination.\n10. Denial. (Stanton, 2016) 65\nIn the case of the Nazi genocide, known as the Holocaust, all ten\nstages existed. Denial is rightfully listed as the tenth stage of\ngenocide. To deny is to defy logic. For the Nazis, xenophobic\nagrarian-oriented ideology dictated a need to cleanse the German\nrace by the complete annihilation of all Jews through genocide.\nReferences\nEchoes & Reflections. (2021).

Gregory Stanton, Ph.D.,\nscholar and founder of Genocide Watch, developed a website that\nscaffolds the stages of genocide, which can be accessed here:\nhttps://www.genocidewatch.com/ (a note of caution for the reader:\nGenocide Watch graphic depiction and discussion on past, current,\nand projected genocides, that include statistics, images and more).\nOn that website, current concerns and ongoing genocidal acts and\nactions are listed. Stanton has updated calls for action, including\nthe persecution of LGBTQ+ communities, to the use of chemical\nweapons against innocent civilians. The current world situation is\ngrievous, and Stanton\u2019s site calls for action, for the world never to\nforget and to act. 68\nFacilitating genocide can emerge as an act of government,\nand genocidal regimes will frequently develop a system of\npropaganda and indoctrination that appealed to a cross-section of\ntheir societies, promising both salvation and rewards to the\nperpetrators. For example, the Turks referred to the Armenians as a\ndire threat, the Soviets and Cambodians made war on the peasants\nand middle class as \u201cclass enemies,\u201d and the Nazis characterized\nthe Jews as \u201csatanic vermin\u201d that had to be wiped off the face of\nthe earth.\nIn the context of this essay, Daniel Patrick Brown and\nAdele Marie discussed other genocides of the past 100 years.\nBrown noted the Rwandan genocide of April-July 1994, which was\nan incredibly vicious effort to annihilate the Tutsi people (hatchets,\nhoes, and machetes were most often the weapon used to kill the\nTutsis). The Hutu media, particularly Radio Television Libre des\nMilie Colines (RTLM), began a campaign in early 1993 of\ntargeting the Tutis as inyenzi (translated roughly as\n\"cockroaches\"). Just as references to the Soviet \"class enemies,\"\nthe Nazis' \"satanic vermin,\" and the Turks' concern for their so- 69\ncalled \"internal security,\" helped pave the way for the mass murder\nof objectified targets, the preparation for the Rwanda genocide\nrequired the Hutus to generate venomous hatred for their victims.\nAlso, the Rwandan genocide had its roots in the European\ncolonization of Africa in the late nineteenth/early twentieth\ncentury. In Rwanda's case, the clash between the Hutus and Tutsis\nwas partly the result of the clash between the Belgians and the\nGerman occupiers of Burundi. Brown also noted that What is so\nchilling about the Rwandan genocide is that the death toll is so\ndifficult to discern as it was just mass carnage at an unimaginable\nlevel for about three months.\nSocial and economic crises caused by social revolution and\nthe great depression enabled these regimes to power. Wars and\ninternational crises provided the preconditions, facilitated, and\ntriggered the genocides. The First World War was one causal\nfactor for the Armenian genocide, the Soviet war on the peasants\nand Ukrainians was prompted by fear of war, and the Vietnam War\nfacilitated the Cambodian genocide. These genocides were led by\nfanatical leaders who coordinated the government\u2019s army, 70\nbureaucracy, police, and propaganda branches.\nOften motivated by extreme nationalism, and in the case of\nthe Nazis, total annihilation coupled with racism, these leaders and\ntheir governments were collectively responsible for the deaths of\ntens of millions. Historian R.J. Rummel referred to these\ngovernments as megamurders. These governments often classified\ntheir victims in such a way as to give the appearance that removal\nand murder were necessary functions to ensure the safety of the\nrest of the populace.\nArguably, genocide was also used as an instrument of\ncontrol, subjugation and, especially with the Nazis, allowed for the\ndevelopment of \u201cordinary men\u201d \u2013 indeed, even women \u2013 into\nmurderous perpetrators. As each country became involved with\ncivil unrest or war, combat created an atmosphere of crisis,\ndestroyed critical thinking, blurred the distinction between soldiers\nand civilians, and provided an opportunity for total domination and\nimperial expansion. All these forces combined to make the\ntwentieth century the age of genocide and the Holocaust. 71\nUnit Four: Nazi Genocide\nNazi Intent: The Holocaust\nWendy Adele-Marie\nThe Holocaust was not inevitable. However, the intent to\nmurder the Jews was always foremost in early Hitlerian policies;\nvalidation of this theory comes from Hitler himself, Historian Sir\nIan Kershaw, the world\u2019s most renowned expert on Adolf Hitler\nconfirms Hitler\u2019s intent, noting that Hitler was not sure how it\nwould be accomplished, but that it would be accomplished. In a\n1920 meeting of the NSDAP, Hitler stated that\nfor us, this is not a problem you can turn a blind eye to-one\nto be solved by small concessions. For us, it is a problem\nof whether our nation can ever recover its health, whether\nthe Jewish spirit can ever really be eradicated. Don't be\nmisled into thinking you can fight a disease without killing\nthe carrier, without destroying the bacillus. (Stein, 2019)\nIn a 2009 interview with historian Laurence Rees, Kershaw noted\nthat \u201cthe aim of destroying the power of the Jews, shall we say, 72\nwas there right from the very beginning. How this would be\nundertaken, nobody knew, not even Hitler\u201d (Rees, 2009).\nConsider Hitler\u2019s words in his 1925 book, Mein Kampf [My\nStruggle]:\nif at the outbreak and during the war, twelve or fifteen\nthousand of these Hebrew nation-corruptors had been held\nunder poison gas once, as hundreds of thousands of our\nbest German workers from all classes and callings had to\nendure on the battlefield, then the sacrifice of millions on\nthe front would not have been in vain.\nHitler also said in Mein Kampf [My Struggle]:\non the contrary: twelve thousand scoundrels eliminated at\nthe right time would perhaps have saved the lives of a\nmillion Germans who are more orderly and more valuable\nfor the future.\nKershaw (2009) stated that once Hitler became Chancellor in\nJanuary 1933, that the intent was to expel the Jews from Germany,\nbut that once the war was underway, the Nazis then had to address\nwhat they called the Jewish question. Hitler and the Nazis had both 73\npower, authority, and later, developed a totalitarian state by the end\nof August 1934. The 1935 passage of the Nuremberg Laws was a\nblueprint that made the Holocaust possible. Then, before the war,\nthe Nazis implemented genocidal policies within Germany itself.\nThe Nazi concentration camps and killing centers originated with\nthe planning and development of a concentration camp called\nDachau, near Munich, Germany, in March of 1933. Dachau would\nbe the prototype of the Nazi concentration camps and later killing\ncenters. After Dachau, in 1933, the very first year that the Nazis\ncame to power, they had already constructed over 100 camps \u201cto\nimprison political opponents and other undesirables\u201d (The Jewish\nVirtual Library, 2018). Concentration camps were designed as\ninmate holding facilities and were used as a labor source.\nSeveral of the concentration camps also provided the Nazi\ndoctors with human subjects for medical and other\nexperimentation. Prisoners were held in the concentration camps\nuntil they were selected for euthanasia or died of disease or illness.\nThe exclusive purpose of the killing centers was to kill. The\nconcentration and later establishment of the six killing centers 74\nbecame a highly organized ideological and bureaucratic enterprise\nof abuse, humiliation, torture, and murder. In some instances,\nflowcharts were created for the Nazis to follow in order to\nachieve maximum output of death.The creation of the Nazi camps\nwas also significant in that, for the first time in history, a form of\ntechnological slaughter was utilized to kill the Jews, and any other\npeople the Nazis targeted as undesirables simply because they\nexisted. Once Nazi Germany began to break their borders, more\nJews were targeted, as \u201cattacks had been happening in Nazi\nGermany\u2019s occupied territories for years\u201d (Boissoneault, 2016).\nAfter the 1939 invasion of Poland, the advent of genocide emerged\ninto an intensity unimaginable in human history.\nFurther, Kershaw said that after 1939, Nazi \u201cpolicies\nbecame more extreme, more radical, and more genocidal\u201d and that\nfrom September 1939 to June 1941, \u201cin those 18 months an\nimmense radicalization in the direction of genocide had already\ntaken place\u201d that would result in the murder of six million Jews\n(Rees, 2009). Kershaw also stated that 75\nthe 'Final Solution' as it came about might have come about\nin different ways, because the original notion was you\ndeport Europe\u2019s Jews into the Soviet Union and there they\nwill starve to death or they will be worked to death or\nwhatever, over a long period of time in the icy wastes of\nthe Soviet Union and they will die out. It was genocidal by\na different route. And, of course, in the meanwhile the\nSoviet Jews had largely been shot. So, genocide was there\nimplicit in that attack on the Soviet Union, and nobody\nreally attempted to hide this at all in the German leadership.\n(Rees, 2009)\nKershaw explained that the intent was there over a decade before\nHitler was appointed as Chancellor and that once he came to\npower, his actions against his enemies were, at first, carefully\nscaffolded in its intensity as laws were passed that enabled the\ngovernment to act against its people. Eventually, the Nazis targeted\nmillions for extermination. Five million non-Jewish victims would\nperish at the hands of the Nazis; these groups included gay men,\nCommunists, Socialists, resisters, POWs, members of religious 76\ninstitutions, the disabled, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, Seventh Day\nAdventists, African-Germans, the Roma and Sinti, criminals, and\nmany more. Victims were categorized as sub-human, akin to\nvermin or a bacterium. No one was left untouched if they were\nclassified as asocial or an enemy of the state. Importantly, as\nKershaw explains, after the invasion of the Soviet Union on 22\nJune 1941, there was a shift in Nazi policy:\nonce it didn\u2019t work out in terms of the Nazi vision of\ntotally destroying the Soviet Union and having this option\nof pushing the European Jews into it then, of course, the\nactual genocide that came out with this so-called 'Final\nSolution' took place in extermination units on Polish soil\nwhich was something that was devised as the war in the\nEast didn\u2019t go according to plan in the autumn and the\nwinter of 1941-2. But genocide was there absolutely as a\ncentral point of this war in the East and therefore you could\nsay that genocide was a central component of the Second\nWorld War itself. (Rees, 2009). 77\nIn January 1942, at the Wannsee Conference, the decision was\nmade to implement the Final Solution: all of the Jews were to die.\nHowever, how could one group led by one man convince a\npopulace to murder millions?\nEven if people did not follow Nazi beliefs, or acted as\nimpassive citizens, some historians have suggested that many in\nGermany were convinced of the implied legitimacy of the laws\nbecause of the aforementioned concept known as the implied\npsychology of fear. Again, Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl\ninvestigated this theory, as have many other psychologists and\nhistorians. Known as the psychology of coercion, using historical\nantisemitism, fear, and projected hysteria, the Nazis used coercion\nto \u201cjustify\u201d actions against the Jews and others, as well as the war\nitself. As Adele-Marie stated, \u201cIn the first several years, Hitler\nwas carried forward on a wave of disillusionment with the\nWeimar Republic, and a plebiscite showed that a solid majority of\nGermans approved of his actions\u201d (Adele-Marie, 2005). Millions\nstood by while people went to the camps. People left and never 78\ncame back. People were both passive and intentional bystanders to\nthese disappearances.\nAccording to Gregory Mullins, professor of educational\nleadership at the University of the Cumberlands, the\nterm authority is often used interchangeably with power in\ngovernment. However, their meanings differ: Power is defined as\n\u201cthe ability to influence somebody to do something that he/she\nwould not have done\u201d (Mullins, 2020). Authority refers to a claim\nof legitimacy, the justification and right to exercise that power.\nMullins (2020) while a mob believes they may hold power to\npunish a criminal, people who believe in the rule of law consider\nthat only a court of law has the authority to punish a criminal. As\nMullins (2020) suggests, if a mob becomes legitimate, and ascends\nto power, twist then destroy laws, implements their own, and then\nacts against that former mob\u2019s categorized enemies - this is now a\nbasic sketch of the Nazis. Mullins (2020) further noted that\n\u2022 Power is the probability that one actor within a social\nrelationship will be in a position to carry out his or her own\nwill - Max Weber 79\n\u2022 A has power over B to the extent that he or she can get B to\ndo something that B would not otherwise do - Robert Dahl\nDoes Mullins\u2019 interpretation of Weber and Dahl then suggest\npeople blindly follow authority because of power? Or does\nfollowing authority also come from a place of fear?\nWhen using chronology and historical constructs that\ndemonstrated how historical antisemitism, combined with the\nadvent of the Nazi party, and then the passage of the subsequent\nNuremberg Laws, how these all came together with the result\nemerging as one of the most racist, horrifically violent regimes in\nhistory. The Holocaust was absolutely not inevitable.\nReferences\nAdele-Marie, W. (2005). Adolf Hitler. In S.

Concentration camps: how\nmany concentration camps? Jewishvirtuallibrary.org.\nhttps://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ 81\nIn our next essay, Emily Minerof writes on how the\nNuremberg Laws made the Holocaust possible.\nHow the Nuremberg Laws Led to the Holocaust\nEmily Minerof\nImagine waking up on September 15th, 1935 and you no\nlonger have the same basic human rights as your neighbor that\nyou\u2019ve lived next to for years, shared meals with, and let your\nchildren grow up with. The Nuremberg Laws just passed, making\nthe Jews and other targeted minority groups second-class citizens\nin their home country (United States Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum, 2000). The Nuremberg Laws prevented Jews from\nmarrying/having children with Germans in order to physically\nprogress the Aryan race and dehumanize the Jews. Implementing\nthese laws was \u201ca major step in clarifying racial policy and\nremoving Jewish influences from Aryan society\u201d (Jewish Virtual\nLibrary, n.d.a). What could have been a semi-normal morning in\npost-World War One (WWI) Germany, became the day the\nHolocaust was made legal. The enactment of the Nuremberg Laws\ncan be considered a definitive act of Nazi intent to perpetrate the 82\nHolocaust because they were the racially discriminative laws that\ntook away the German Citizenship of Jews. This law set a baseline\nfor more dehumanizing laws to be created regarding Jews.\nThe authors of the Nuremberg Laws wrote them with the\nknowledge that the Holocaust would be perpetrated but were not\nnecessarily aware of the end result of mass extermination. More\nspecifically, they were aware of the purification of the Aryan race\nrather than the plan to exterminate the Jews. The authors knew that\nthese laws would racially classify and isolate the Jews. When\nauthor Wilhelm Stuckart was made aware that the Nuremberg\nLaws were ignored in the Final Solution, he \u201cpointed out the\nbureaucratic problems of such a radical course of action - insisting\nthat mandatory sterilization would be a better option in preserving\nthe \u201cspirit\u201d of the Nuremberg laws\u201d (Jewish Virtual Library,\nn.d.b). This evidence shows that Stuckart knew the severity of the\nlaws he had helped write but certainly did not foresee or agree with\nthe Final Solution being executed. Despite the knowledge of the\nauthors and whether they willingly perpetrated the Holocaust,\nAdolf Hitler told them otherwise. 83\nIt is noted that \u201cHitler claimed during a Reichstag session\nthat the Nuremberg Laws would actually help the Jews by creating\n\u201ca level ground on which the German people may find a tolerable\nrelation with the Jewish people.\u201d Hitler\u2019s statement was a \u201cblatant\ndeception, aimed at the outside world\u201d (Jewish Virtual Library,\nn.d.a). Although the authors may have been aware that Hitler\u2019s\n\u201coutside\u201d motives were not exactly true, they may have not been\nmade aware that Hitler would use the Nuremberg Laws as a\n\u201cprecursor to other more degrading decrees\u201d in the future\u201d (Jewish\nVirtual Library, n.d.a). This can be seen when authors \u201cStuckart\nand his assistant, Dr. Hans Globke, in the RMI [Reich Ministry of\nthe Interior] claimed that Nazi racial laws differed little from\nJewish law: \u201cThe German people want to keep their blood pure\nand their culture together just like the Jews have done since the\nprophet Ezra ordered them to do so\u201d (Jewish Virtual Library,\nn.d.a). This explanation provided by the authors shows no\nindication of mass extermination of the Jews, but only to create an\nAryan race. Despite the knowledge of Hitler\u2019s ideologies outlined\nin his book Mein Kampf, the Final Solution was not discussed until 84\n1941, and \u201ceven in his inner circle, Hitler could never bring\nhimself to speak with outright frankness about the killing of Jews\u201d\n(Kershaw, 2011, p. 29).\nUnfortunately, the Nuremberg Laws were not the first set\nof laws/clauses that targeted Jews in their own country. Since the\nend of WWI, Jews have been the scapegoat for the loss of the war\nduring the end of the Weimar Republic and the start of the Third\nReich. These laws/clauses paved the foundation and societal\nacceptance for the Nuremberg Laws to exist. When Hitler was still\nChancellor under President Paul von Hindenburg, an emergency\nclause known as the Reichstag Fire Decree took away the basic\nrights of citizens after the Reichstag building was \u201cmysteriously\u201d\nburnt down (United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2000).\nHitler\u2019s rise to power required the political climate Germany\ndisplayed after the loss of the war. After WWI, the Weimar\nRepublic democracy declined, Germany faced the repercussions of\nthe loss of WWI and struggled financially due to an economic\ncrisis. Hitler had established dictatorship after the Enabling Act\nwas passed on March 23rd, 1933 (United States Holocaust 85\nMemorial Museum, 2000). Thus, he became the F\u00fchrer after he\nassumed presidency (Adele-Marie, 2018a). This meant that he had\nfull dictatorship over Germany. A sense of German nationalism\nwas weak among the people and they were desperate for any\nchange, even if it exploited anti-Semitic ideologies.\nOnce Hitler had full power as F\u00fchrer, nothing could stop\nhim from doing what he wanted despite the illegalities this caused.\nThe Nazi party began to boycott Jewish businesses in April of\n1933. Over the next several months, laws were enacted that\ndirectly impacted the lives of Jews and other groups the Nazis\ntargeted. Laws such as the Law for the Restoration of the\nProfessional Civil Service, Law on the Revocation of\nNaturalization, Law for the Prevention of Offspring with\nHereditary Diseases, and the criminalization of gay acts among\nmen were enacted (United States Holocaust Memorial Museum,\n2000). These laws: prevented Jews from having jobs, Roma of\nGerman citizenship, and legalized sterilization of the disabled\nwhich eventually led to the legal euthanasia of the terminally ill.\nBooks by Jews were burned publicly to eliminate foreign influence 86\nand protect the German sense of Nationalism (Adele-Marie,\n2018a). Having ideas were no longer free, actions were no longer\nfree, and you had to look a certain way. There were more than four\nhundred decrees and regulations that made the personal lives and\npublic lives of Jews difficult during the first six years of Hitler\u2019s\ndictatorship (Adele-Marie, 2018c).\nHitler was able to create a society where these laws were\nconsidered \u201cthe norm\u201d through excessive use of Nazi propaganda\nin varying forms and the incremental laws put into place over time.\nAs each law passed, \u201cthe norm changed\u201d, and this partly explains\nwhy there was a general acceptance of them. The Nazi Party was\nable to dismantle democracy through a combination of political,\neconomic, and emotional circumstances that all happened in a\nshort, overlapping time period. The shared feeling of a lack of\nGerman nationalism after the loss of the war created a loss of faith\nin the Weimar Republic democracy. Hitler started the Nazi Party in\n1919 but failed miserably for almost ten years before slowly\ngaining power. Many people did not see the Nazi Party as a threat.\nHitler emphasized a strong sense of nationalism, and the German 87\npeople wanted that back. This is one reason why people were\nwilling to give up their personal freedoms. Another reason is that\nHitler made specific groups of people, such as women, feel\nimportant to the cause, for example, giving women the right to\nvote in a time where women were considered inferior to men\n(Boak, 2003). In terms of importance, the diffusion of\nresponsibility greatly contributed to the lack of response from\nother religious groups and countries and what they valued as\nimportant.\nThe narrative from Defining a Jew as referenced in Wendy\nAdele-Marie\u2019s online readings discusses the responsibility among\nChristians and their interpretation of their religion in regard to the\nJews and other targeted groups during the Holocaust (Adele-Marie,\n2018d). Since the Church defined the \u201clove thy neighbor\u201d\ncommandment to only extend to other baptized Christians,\nChristians felt guilty that they didn\u2019t help the Jews. For the most\npart, the response from other countries and groups was relatively\nsimilar in that they did nothing, but for different reasons. Although\nDietrich Goldschmidt admits why German Christians \u201ccouldn\u2019t\u201d 88\nfeel responsible for helping the Jews, that did not stop the French\nProtestant Congregation in the Village of Le Chambon sur Lignon.\nMany people in this community felt it was their Christian\nobligation to save the Jews, their neighbors in need, and risked\ntheir lives to do so (Yad Vashem, n.d.).\nIn terms of Pope Pius XII and his non-response to the\nHolocaust as a religious figure, \u201che wanted to play peacemaker\nduring the war\u2026 To safeguard his credentials for such a role\u2026 to\npreserve the Vatican City\u2019s status as an independent state and\nneutral government\u201d (Phayer, 2011, p. 243). What this really\nmeant was that no stance was taken, and with the influence of the\nChurch, many more Jewish lives could have been saved if the\nChurch simply involved itself with politics. This was\nGoldschmidt\u2019s initial finding; the Church did not involve itself in\npolitics and therefore it was not in any way responsible for\nattempting to save the Jews. Overall, the Church could have had a\nsignificant influence on the number of bystanders during the\nHolocaust. 89\nMost of the world failed to react because other countries\ncould not comprehend the severity of what was happening in Nazi-\noccupied Europe. There had never been an event \u201cin recent\nEuropean history for the murderous character of German National\nSocialism\u201d which left responders caught off guard and unprepared\n(Laqueur, 2011, p. 253). It is also believed that despite knowing\ninformation about the Final Solution, it was not believed (Laqueur,\n2011). In the Evian Conference convened by American President\nFranklin D. Roosevelt (FDR), thirty-two countries were\nrepresented, and most did not change their immigration policies to\nhelp Jews emigrate from Eastern Europe (United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum, 2000). FDR chose to be cautious because\n\u201cGermany still owed American investors billions of dollars,\nborrowed to pay World War I reparations, and Roosevelt did not\nbelieve that the United States should intervene in the internal\naffairs of another country\u201d (United States Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum, n.d.). Despite the changes made to this opinion later, it\nwas clear that the existence of Jews in Europe was not the interest\nof FDR. 90\nHitler created the Nuremberg Laws with the intention to\ncreate more laws. In order \u201cto create his homogeneous and\nharmonious Aryan society, Hitler had first to discard the Jews, a\n\u201cpeople\u201d incompatible with \u201ctrue Germans.\u201d The Nuremberg Laws\nhelped Hitler take the first step toward getting rid of \u201cthese\nparasites\u201d and imposing racial conformity on society\u201d (Jewish\nVirtual Library, n.d.a). The result of the Nuremberg Laws were\nmore laws that defined a Jew. Wendy Adele-Marie touches on\n\"The Ten Stages of Genocide\" by Dr. Gregory H. Stanton in her\nonline readings. The Ten Stages of Genocide outline the steps in\nthe order necessary to perpetrate genocide, and the first step is\n\u201cClassification\u201d (Adele-Marie, 2018b). Classification in these\nterms defined an \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d. Jews were classified as \u201cthem\u201d\nby being forced to identify themselves by the yellow \u201cJude\u201d patch\non their clothes. The Nuremberg Laws inevitably opened the doors\nfor laws to be made to determine what a Jew was. For the\nNuremberg Laws to outlaw interracial marriage among Jews and\nGermans, \u201cJew\u201d had to be defined. The chart created by the Nazis\nintended to classify the Jews from the \u201cAryan\u201d ideal by any means 91\nnecessary, even if it was not physically observable. People were\ndefined as mixed-race Jews, known as \u201cMischlings,\u201d based upon\ntheir grandparents and parents\u2019 \u201crace\u201d (Adele Marie, 2018d).\nToday, many might question why people simply listened to this\nNazi propaganda and how it is even reasonable to classify people\nbased on removed generations of their family.\nThe Nuremberg Laws perpetuated the Holocaust by\ncreating the foundation for legal persecution of the Jews via\nobedience. Those who complied yet disagreed with these laws\nwere vital to the dehumanization of the Jews because nothing was\nbeing done to actively save the Jews. In the following statement,\n\u201cObedience to law was the main reason why Germans and their\nallies killed Jews and others during the Holocaust\u201d this means that\nsimply not negating the law was violent towards the Jews. People\nwho did not actively contribute to resistance, whether it was\nviolent or non-violent participated in compliance with the law.\nAlthough it is not as simple as resisting or complying, but rather\nrisking fatal consequences in order to potentially save the lives of\nothers. The diffusion of responsibility plays a crucial role in the 92\nHolocaust and the obedience of Nazi Germany. The more people\nwho complied with the laws, the less responsible each individual\nfelt for the atrocities that were occurring. Metaphorically, the\nNuremberg Laws can be considered the gust of wind that pushed\nthe tumbleweed. These laws put a foot in the door for the future of\nJews to be terrorized, and eventually victims in a mass\nextermination. Without the Nuremberg Laws, it is uncertain that\nthe ultimate consequence Final Solution of the Holocaust would\nhave been permitted.\nReferences\nAdele-Marie, W. (2018a).

It examines\ninfluential figures such as Charles Darwin, Francis Galton, Ernst\nHaeckel, Alfred Ploetz, and Houston Stewart Chamberlain, and the\ndevelopment of pseudo-scientific racial theories such as Nordicism\nand Aryanism. This chapter sheds light on the ideological\nfoundations that laid the groundwork for the implementation of\nhorrific eugenics policies during the Nazi regime.\nThe History of Nazi Eugenics\nAs a consequence of the Beer Hall Putsch, a failed coup\nd'\u00e9tat he attempted in 1923, Adolf Hitler was convicted of high\ntreason and served several months in prison. During his time,\nHitler wrote an autobiographical manifesto called Mein Kampf\n(\u2018My Struggle\u2019), published in 1925 (USHMM, 2015). With his\npolitical career at an all-time low, he hoped that publishing this\nbook would earn him some money and serve as a propaganda\nplatform to convey his radical views and attack those whom he 96\naccused of betraying him and Germany. In Mein Kampf Vol. 1,\nChapter 11: People and Race, Hitler wrote,\n\u201cEverything we admire on this earth today\u2014science, art,\ntechnological developments, and inventions\u2014is only the\ncreative product of a few peoples and originally perhaps\nof one race. The maintenance of this civilization as a\nwhole is entirely dependent on them. Should they perish,\nall that makes this earth beautiful will descend with them\ninto the grave. On them alone depends the existence of\nthis whole culture. If they perish, the beauty of this earth\nwill sink into the grave with them\u201d (Hitler, 1925).\nFrom the very beginning of the Second World War, Hitler and the\nNazis were determined to ensure the strength and purity of the\nGerman race.\nThe Nazis believed that the genetically strong and the\nracially pure had to be encouraged to have more children, while the\ngenetically weak and the racially impure had to be neutralized by\none means or another. These ideas of racial improvement did not 97\nbegin during the Second World War, in fact, they had been\ngrowing in popularity for over one hundred years prior.\nOrigins of Nordicism\nOriginating in the early 19th century, anthropologists\ndivided the Caucasian race into sub-races depending on ancestral\nhomelands and fictitious phenotypical traits (Hutton, 2005).\nAnthropologists created sub-race populations such as Anglo-\nSaxons, Balts, Celts, Slavs, and the Nordic race. The Nordic race\nconsisted of people from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and\nIceland, as well as the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and \u00c5land. The\nsupposed physical traits of the Nordic race included being tall,\nlong-headed, narrow-faced, with a prominent chin; narrow nose\nwith high bridge; soft, smooth, or wavy blonde or reddish-golden\nhair; deep-sunk, light blue eyes, and rosy-white skin (Gunther,\n1927). Very quickly, the belief that the Nordic race constituted the\nsuperior branch of the Caucasian race gave rise to the ideology of\nNordicism.\n1848: The Revolutions Give Germany An Inferiority Complex 98\nA little later, during the middle of the 19th century, a wave\nof anti-monarchism swept through Europe sparking a full-blown\nrevolution starting in the spring of 1848. Paving the way for the\nrevolts, many regions in Europe experienced harvest failures,\nwhich led to mass starvation, migration, and civil unrest (Jelks,\n2022). The harvest failures mostly affected peasants and the\ngrowing urban working classes, only making the caste system and\nunfair treatment more readily apparent. While the middle classes in\nGerman nation-states were committed to liberal principles, the\npeasants and working classes wanted radical improvements to their\nworking and living conditions. Due to the unanimous\ndissatisfaction with the current political leadership, popular unrest\noccurred and change was fought for on all fronts. Ideas such as\nliberalism, socialism, and nationalism took root, and workers\nclamored for more economic rights. Nationalism also played a\nsignificant factor in the Revolutions of 1848. Different nation-\nstates pressed for different things, however, Germany\u2019s most\npopular demand was for an elected representative government and\nthe unification of a nationalist Germany. By August 1848, the 99\nBavarian Army and the Prussian troops completely crushed all\nGerman revolutionary uprisings, marking the end of the political\ninsurgence.\nAt this point, the German nation was feeling defeated and\ninsecure as their foremost aspiration to become a Nationalist state\nhad just faltered, not to mention with the popularized\nanthropological discussions taking place regarding Nordicism, they\nfelt entirely inferior. The Nazis believed that the Nordic race was\nsuperior to all other races, and they were willing to make use of\nany means to fight for the expansion of this race at the expense of\nwhat they perceived to be inferior races.\n1853: Origins of Aryanism\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Revolutions of 1848,\nFrench aristocrat, diplomat, and writer, Arthur de Gobineau\npublished poems and novels where he first expressed his racial\ntheories. Gobineau was an elitist racist, visibly in his 1853 novel\nEssay on the Inequality of the Human Races, he argued that there\nare intellectual differences between human races, that civilizations\ndeteriorate when races are mixed, and that the white race is 100\nsuperior as they are the only race capable of intelligent thought,\ncreating beauty, and the most beautiful (Gobineau, 1853).\nGobineau, along with all of the other German Nationalists,\nparticipated in systematic racial scaffolding when discussing race,\nbecause, regardless of what race was under observation, they found\na way to rank the subgroups within that race, preserving the\ncohesive structure of racism and antisemitism.\nSimilar to the way early 19th century anthropologists\ncreated subdivision within the Caucasian race and as a result\nNordicism was created, Gobineau co-opted the term Aryan for the\npromotion of scientific racism, spawning the ideology of Aryanism\n(Blue, 1999). Since the term had been introduced into Western\nsociety by Gobineau, it was immediately adopted by various racist\nand antisemitic writers and anthropologists notably, Theodor\nPoesche, Houston Chamberlain, and Hans Gunther.\nThe original connotation of the term Aryan was detached\nfrom its proper geographic and linguistic origin as an Indo-Iranian\nbranch of the Indo-European language family by this time. What\nwas once an ethnocultural self-designative identity and epithet to 101\ndescribe a person as noble and virtuous, had suddenly become a\nuniversally accepted concept to describe the white race; the only\ncivilized race, and the superior race.\n1859: Charles Darwin\u2019s Natural Selection\nDuring the 1800s, more and more people were looking to\nscience and biology to justify their racial ideas about who was\nacceptable and who was not. They found support for their\narguments in Charles Darwin\u2019s 1859, On the Origin of Species: a\nwork that seemed unrelated to human societies (Hutton, 2010).\nIn Darwin\u2019s analysis of how various species of plants and\nanimals physically change over time, his work suggested that each\nspecies competes for a limited amount of space and nourishment,\nand consequently only some survive. The individual organism that\nis well suited to its environment has the best chance of living long\nenough to mate and produce offspring, and over many generations,\nthe traits that help the organism to survive are passed on, while the\ntraits that create disadvantages die out. As a result, new traits,\nspecies, and forms of life gradually develop or evolve. Darwin\ncalled this process of evolution natural selection. 102\n1869: Francis Galton and the Birth Of Eugenics\nShortly after On the Origin of Species was published, many\nreaders immediately saw connections between Darwin\u2019s theory of\nevolution and their own society. Darwin\u2019s cousin, an English\nstatistician, explorer, and ethnologist, Francis Galton traveled to\nAfrica and documented his observations in his 1869 book\nHereditary Genius. He believed that, on average, Black persons are\nnaturally inferior to white persons in intelligence and other\nhereditary traits fitted to \u201ccivilized life\u201d (Galton, 1869). Other non-\nwhite races fared little better in his estimation, and some even\nworse. Galton asserted that environmental factors cannot account\nfor these racial differences. Black persons in Europe or raised in\nwhite families remain much like their \u201csavage\u201d ancestors while\nwhite persons visiting or living in Africa maintain their \u201ccivilized\nsuperiority.\u201d These observations convinced him that individuals\ncannot acquire inheritable attributes through nurture or other\nenvironmental factors. 103\nDuring the following years, Galton wrote Inquiries into\nHuman Fertility and Its Development, which is where the term\neugenics was first seen. Galton coined the term deriving from the\nGreek word eugenes meaning good in birth or good in stock\n(Galton, 1869). Eugenics is the use of science to improve the\nhuman race, both by breeding \u201csociety's best with the best\u201d and by\npreventing \u201csociety's worst\u201d from breeding at all. Eugenicists\nbelieved that a nation is a biological community that must be\nprotected from threat, which they often defined as mixing with\nother allegedly inferior races. In Inquiries into Human Fertility and\nIts Development, Galton argued that some are born intelligent, and\nothers are born feeble-minded, and the roots of all such hereditary\ntraits reach deep into one's ancestry and deep within one\u2019s race\n(Galton, 1883). He claimed that only higher races could be\nsuccessful in life. Thus, Galton believed that eugenics could\ncontrol human evolution and development for the better. Galton\ndeveloped his hereditarian notions to such a degree that they\nhelped to lay the foundation for both eugenics and racial hygiene,\nwhich in their formative period were allied, overlapping 104\ndisciplines. The aforementioned Francis Galton and Charles\nDarwin inspired a British philosopher, Herbert Spencer, to create\nhis own theories.\nReferring to Darwin\u2019s work but using his own phrases such\nas \u201cthe struggle for existence\u201d and \u201cthe survival of the fittest,\u201d\nSpencer helped to popularize a theory known as Social Darwinism.\nSocial Darwinists believed that persons at the top of the social and\neconomic pyramid were considered society\u2019s fittest, and contrarily,\npersons at the bottom must be unfit. Many Social Darwinists,\ntherefore, believed that the government should not interfere in the\nsurvival of the fittest by extending rights and privileges to those\nseen as less fit. To illustrate, Social Darwinists would vehemently\ndisagree with giving financial aid to struggling single-parent\nhouseholds as that would interfere with the natural function of the\nbiological social and economic pyramid. Another example of a\nSocial Darwinistic approach to government would be limiting\nimmigration to protect the racially pure from the impure in the\nhopes that they do not reproduce, all as a way to help evolution\nalong to purify the human race. They promoted the idea that some 105\nraces are biologically superior to others and that if the laws of\nnatural selection were allowed to function freely, everyone would\nfind their rightful place in society.\nIt must be said that all of these ideologies are\npseudoscientific beliefs that appropriate the legitimacy of science\nto support or justify racism, racial inferiority, and racial\nsuperiority.\n1878: The Aryan Race and the Jewish Threat\nIn 1878, German American anthropologist Theodor\nPoesche published a survey of historical references demonstrating\nthat the Aryan phenotype is light-skinned, blue-eyes, and blond\nhair. Nazi propaganda posters, photographs, and films showed\npeople who fit this ideal (Maldahiyar, 2022). While this was\nconsidered the master race, many people whom the Nazis\nconsidered to be Aryan Germans did not look like this. Ironically,\nAdolf Hitler did not even fit this ideal as he had brown hair and\nwas of average height (USHMM).\nThe Nazis believed that in order to protect the Aryan race\nand stay strong, they had to stray away from inferior races and 106\nremain racially pure. To Hitler and the Nazis, Jewish people were\nthe biggest threat to the Aryan race. Nazis referred to Jews as a\nparasitic race who were destroying the Aryan race, and needed to\nbe exterminated.\nThe Nazis even tried to use science to prove these racial\ntheories and recruited doctors and other scientists to help them do\nso. These officials tried to categorize people into races. They\nmeasured and described people\u2019s physical features, like noses,\nskulls, eyes, and hair.\n1899: Chamberlain\u2019s Theory: How To Identify A Jew\nIn 1899, British German philosopher Houston Stewart\nChamberlain published, The Foundations of the Nineteenth\nCentury, in which he theorized an existential struggle to the death\nbetween a superior German-Aryan race and the inferior Jewish-\nSemitic race. He viewed the clash between the two as the basis of\nthe entire European history, and according to Chamberlain, the\nGermans are fated to destroy the Jews, as they are the \u201chighest\ncultural achievers and saviors of humanity,\u201d while the Jews are a 107\n\u201cbastard race of greedy, inferior foreigners whose interference in\nthe world can only lead to cultural degeneration.\u201d\nBuilding somewhat on Gobineau\u2019s theories, Chamberlain\ndeveloped a relatively complex theory relating racial origins,\nphysical features, and cultural traits. According to Chamberlain\u2019s\n1912 The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century, the modern Jew\n(Homo judaeica) mixes some of the features of the Hittite (H.\nsyriaca)\u2013 notably the \"Jewish nose that hooks downward,\u201d the\nretreating chin that juts out, and evil exaggerated eyebrows, an\nover-cunning fondness for usury \u2013 and of the true Semite, the\nBedouin Arab (H. arabicus), in particular, the dolichocephalic\nskull (long and narrow), the thick-set body, and a tendency to be\nintellectually inferior and destructive.\nChamberlain\u2019s pseudoscientific, antisemitic theory on how\nto identify a Jewish person had such a mammoth impact on the\nnext 45 years. This was the groundwork for every school\u2019s\ncurriculum during the Second World War. Schools played an\nessential role in spreading Nazi ideas to German youth. When Nazi\nGermany passed new laws to make public education reflect and 108\nteach their nationalist and racial ideologies, German educators\nimplemented new lectures, books, and textbooks compiled with\ninstructional manuals filled with absurd caricatures and wild\nimaginings that taught students how to identify a Jew with exact\nmeasurements and what they should do if they come across one.\nHitler greatly admired Chamberlain\u2019s ideology, in fact, the\ntwo men were close friends who corresponded from the time of\nHitler\u2019s imprisonment (USHMM). It remains a strong possibility\nthat more so than any other German cultural icon, Chamberlain\u2019s\nform of racial antisemitism was critical in the development of\nNazism (Adele-Marie).\n1920s: Eugenics: The Global Movement\nBy the 1920s, eugenics had become a global movement.\nAmongst other countries, there was well-admired governmental\nsupport for eugenics in the United States, Great Britain, Italy,\nMexico, and Canada. In Germany, Ernst Haeckel, a biologist,\npopularized Social Darwinism by combining it with romanticized\nideas about the German Volk, the people who share German\nheritage, language, and culture. Haeckel was also notorious for 109\nracial scaffolding, where he divided humankind into races, which\nhe called breeds, ranking each of them into a pyramid (Adele-\nMarie, 2004). He described Germans as superior and the highest\nspecies of mankind, thus, they were at the top of the ranking, while\nJewish and Black people were at the bottom. Haeckel argued that\nany mixture of the races would lead to the biological deterioration\nof the German or Aryan race.\nHaeckel was taken with the idea of eugenics as a way of\nkeeping the German race pure, as he had been known to say \u201clife\nwas a constant struggle for existence and racial purity,\u201d and he\nsought to forearm Germany against biological decay (Haeckel,\n1905). While Ernst Haeckel popularized Social Darwinism, and in\ndoing so introduced eugenics to Germany, the true founder of\nGermany\u2019s eugenics was Alfred Ploetz as he was the primary\nadvocate for racial hygiene. Racial Hygiene is an approach to\neugenics, mainly used in the early 20th century, and its most\nextensive implementation was in Nazi Germany. The main marker\nbetween racial hygiene and other forms of eugenics is its toiling 110\nexertions to avoid miscegenation, similar to an animal breeder\nseeking pedigree or purebred animals.\nThroughout history, and regrettably still today, we see the\nuse of eugenics everywhere. Be that as it may, the most well-\nknown application of eugenics in the world occurred in Nazi-\ninvaded Europe for the duration of World War II and the\nHolocaust. Directly upon Adolf Hitler\u2019s election to chancellor of\nGermany in 1933, he began authorizing programs, crumbling the\nnation\u2019s democratic institutions, and transforming Germany into a\nwar state, insistent on conquering Europe for the benefit of the\nAryan race (Stahnisch, 2017). He used Germany\u2019s resources at his\ndisposal to cleanse the German people and the Nazi state of those\nunworthy of life.\nNote to the Reader\nWhen we learn about the Holocaust and other genocides it\nis common to feel stressed and perceive it all as a perplexing blend\nof dates and figures, however, history is much richer than that.\nHistory is learning the narratives, the real-life experiences, and the\nfirst-hand knowledge which flows through those dates and 111\nhistorical figures. As a matter of fact, history is the origin story of\nhow things look today. With that being said, I urge you to take\nyour time while reading and set time aside to recuperate, as this\nhistorical narrative contains very graphic and disturbing details of\nabuse, torture, and experimentation on humans. Also, it should be\nnoted that while historians work tirelessly to uncover more and\nmore details about the horrifying medical experimentation in\naddition to the number of fatalities during the Holocaust, it must be\nacknowledged how very little statistically we know and how\nmassively incomprehensible this genocide was.\n1939: Operation T4, The Euthanasia Program\nDuring the Holocaust, the Nazis established killing centers\nfor intentional, methodical, and systematic mass murder. Killing\ncenters were almost exclusively death factories.\nVery recently, there has been an evolving terminology\nconcerning the etymology of the camp system. Now we use the\nterm killing center rather than the words death camp or\nextermination camp or center. The term death camp is a rather\nvague concept that could be applied broadly to all Nazi camps 112\nwhere death occurred (USHMM). Likewise, some scholars have\nobjected to using the Nazi-inspired term extermination camp,\nwhich conveys the notion that the prisoners were akin to vermin or\npests that needed to be eradicated. The term killing center more\nprecisely identifies the function of the facility without any such\npejorative connotations about the victims.\nNazi concentration camps, by contrast, served primarily as\ndetention and labor centers. At the killing centers, Nazi officials\nemployed assembly-line methods to murder Jews and other\nvictims. The Killing centers first appeared in Nazi Germany with\nOperation T4, the Euthanasia Program. The Euthanasia Program\nbegan in 1939, only two years before the Nazis began\nsystematically murdering Europe\u2019s Jews as part of the Final\nSolution. The Euthanasia Program originally targeted children with\nvarying disabilities, and later on, extended the program to adults\nwho were living in institutional settings in Germany and German-\nannexed territories. Public health authorities began to encourage\nparents of children with disabilities to admit their young children\nto one of several specially designated pediatric clinics throughout 113\nGermany and Austria (USHMM). The Euthanasia Program was\ndescribed to the public as a \u201cmercy death,\u201d to relieve the suffering\nof the chronically ill who lacked quality of life. However, the\nuntold goal was to murder anyone diagnosed with Schizophrenia,\nEpilepsy, Dementia, Encephalitis, and other chronic psychiatric or\nneurological disorders, as well as criminals and already-\ninstitutionalized patients, and, cleansing the Aryan race of those\nconsidered genetically defective and financial burden to society. In\nreality, the clinics were children's killing wards. There, specially\nrecruited medical staff murdered their young charges by lethal\noverdoses of medication or by starvation (USHMM).\nOnce the Nazis saw their plan succeed with children, they\nbegan working on exterminating adults with disabilities. When\nadult patients were selected for the Euthanasia Program, they were\npicked up from their home institutions and were transported to one\nof the six gassing installations to be killed. The gas chambers were\ndisguised as shower facilities, and then while the victims were\nlocked within, pure, bottled carbon monoxide gas was released\n(USHMM). Following the gassing, T4 functionaries burned the 114\nbodies in the crematoria attached to the gassing facilities. Other\nworkers took the ashes of cremated victims from one large\ncommon pile and placed them in separate urns to send to the\nrelatives of the victims (Rotzoll, 2006). The families or guardians\nof the victims received an urn, along with a death certificate and\nother documentation, listing a fabricated cause and date of death.\nAdolf Hitler signed a secret authorization to protect the\nparticipating physicians, medical staff, and administrators from\nprosecution (USHMM). On all levels, this operation was permitted\nand approved by persons in positions of power, who under all\nprinciples were accountable for preventing such acts. The\nEuthanasia Program was one of many radical eugenic measures\nwhich aimed to restore the racial honor and righteousness of the\nGerman bloodline. It aimed to eliminate what Nazi eugenicists and\ntheir supporters considered \u201clife unworthy of life\": those\nindividuals who\u2014they believed\u2014because of severe psychiatric,\nneurological, or physical disabilities represented both a genetic and\na financial burden on German society (USHMM). Because the\nprogram was secret, T4 planners and functionaries took extremely 115\nelaborate measures to conceal its deadly designs. Not to mention\nthat in every case of euthanasia, physicians and institutional\nadministrators falsified official records to indicate that the victims\ndied of natural causes. Thus, historians can only estimate that the\nEuthanasia Program, in all its phases, claimed the lives of about\n250,000 persons, however, there were probably far more fatalities\nthan we have accounted for.\nThe Euthanasia Program was, in many ways, a rehearsal for\nNazi Germany's subsequent genocidal policies of the mass\ndestruction of the Jewish people. The Euthanasia Program was a\ngenocide embedded within a genocide. The Nazi leadership\nextended the ideological justification conceived by medical\nperpetrators for the destruction of the disabled to other categories\nof perceived biological enemies. Planners of the Final Solution\nlater borrowed the gas chamber and accompanying crematoria\nspecifically designed for the T4 campaign, to murder Jews in\nGerman-occupied Europe. Despite the program\u2019s efforts to stay\nconfidential, the program quickly became an open secret, and\nprotests concerning the killings began to crop up, forcing Hitler to 116\norder a halt to the Euthanasia Program. Of course, Hitler\u2019s call for\na halt to the Euthanasia Program was just for show; German\nmedical professionals and healthcare workers resumed the killings,\njust in a more carefully concealed manner than before. All of the\nOperation T4 personnel who had proven themselves reliable in the\nfirst mass murder euthanasia program were transferred over and\nfeatured prominently among the German staff stationed at the\ncenterfold of mass destruction, Operation Reinhard. Codenamed\nOperation Reinhard, Nazi Germany built three killing centers, or\ngassing installations which were established as part of this action:\nBelzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka. Operation Reinhard marked the\ndeadliest phase of Nazi Germany\u2019s intention to commit genocide\nagainst the Jewish people (USHMM).\nThe German Goal Of Aryanization and Advancement oOf\nMedicine\nThe Nazi Party carried out a series of medical experiments\nwithin killing centers for two main goals: to mold Germany into a\ncohesive national Aryan race and to advance German medicine.\nWhile some of the experiments had legitimate purposes, most were 117\nracial in nature, thereby violating the principles of medical ethics\nand participating in the scientifically erroneous and immoral theory\nof racial hygiene or eugenics. The experiments were accomplished\nwithout the consent of the patients and with total disregard for their\nsuffering or their survival.\nThese medical experiments were performed on a massive\nscale in Germany and the Nazi-occupied countries on non-German\nnationalists, both prisoners of war and civilians, including Jewish\npeople and other asocial persons. These experiments were not just\nthe isolated and casual acts of individual doctors and scientists\nworking solely on their own responsibility but were the product of\nintricately coordinated policy-making and planning at high\ngovernmental, military, and Nazi Party levels, conducted as an\nintegral part of the total war effort (USHMM). They were\nsanctioned, permitted, or approved by persons in positions of\npower who under all canon were responsible for knowing about\nand taking steps to terminate or prevent them. Scientists in the\nbiomedical fields, especially anthropologists, psychiatrists, and\ngeneticists, many of them medically trained experts, played a very 118\nimportant role in legitimizing these policies and helping to\nimplement them.\nLong before Hitler took power, these scientists, or\neugenicists, had embraced racial hygiene, specifically supporting\nthe ideology that criminality, mental illness, alcoholism, and even\npoverty, stemmed from hereditary factors, and did not result from\nenvironmental factors. Because the Nazi regime was in support of\neugenics, these scientists would welcome the Nazi Party with open\narms.\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century in Germany,\nrace was arguably the single most important category of social-\nscientific views of Jews and Jewishness. One of Hitler\u2019s favorite\nauthors and theoreticians of race, Hans Friedrich Karl Gunther\n(1889-1968), was a crusader for Aryan superiority and racial purity\n(Morris-Reich, 2006). The former literary scholar turned social\nanthropologist produced a series of infamous studies on Racial\nTypology (the categorization of humans by race, based solely on\nphenotypic traits) which became the outline for Nazi racial 119\nanthropology and laid the groundwork for its racial laws and\neugenics programs (Ryback, 2008).\nPolicies to Legally Remove the Undesirable\nAlmost immediately after Hitler was appointed chancellor\nin 1933, the German government passed a law called Gesetz zur\nVerh\u00fctung erbkranken Nachwuchses (Prevention of Offspring with\nHereditary Diseases), mandating that all persons with undesirable\ntraits be forcibly sterilized. This law provided a basis for the\ninvoluntary sterilization of people with physical and mental\ndisabilities, Roma, African-Germans, and other asocials persons.\nWhen Nazi racial hygiene was implemented, the categories\nof persons and groups regarded as biologically threatening to the\nnation's health were greatly expanded. The categories went from\npersons suffering from drug addiction and poverty to ethnic and\nracial identities such as Jewish persons, Roma, Sinti, and BIPOC\ncommunities. This also included persons with physical, mental, or\npsychological disabilities, and persons in the LGBTQ+\ncommunities. 120\nThe Nazis enlisted the help of physicians and medically\ntrained geneticists, psychiatrists, and anthropologists to develop\nracial health policies. These policies began with mass euthanasia\nprograms and then moved to mass sterilization, and ended with the\nnear destruction of European Jewry (USHMM).\nHitler and the Nazi party were called intentionalists,\nmeaning they intended to murder the Jewish people and the\nasocials all along (Adele-Marie). From the very beginning,\ndifferent kinds of legislation and provisions were put in place,\ngiving the Nazi Party complete and total legitimacy.\nTo get a full understanding of how intricately calculated the\nNazi Party was concerning their nationalist campaign to cleanse\nGermany of individuals seen as biological threats to the nation\u2019s\nhealth, it is essential to know one of the men responsible for some\nof the most despicable crimes against humanity.\nThe Doctor Who Experimented On Humans To Prove A Point\nShowing early support for the Nazi ideology, he marched\nwith the Munich unit in 1923 in the failed Hitler putsch (Weisz,\n2014). He was a professor and an orthopedic surgeon who was 121\ninvolved in many sadistic experiments, which took place inside the\nkilling centers. He was the childhood friend and personal physician\nof Heinrich Himmler, the Commander of the SS, and the main\narchitect and implementor of the Final Solution. Born on\nNovember 23, 1897, in Bavaria, within the German Empire, the\nworld introduces one of the worst men of the Third Reich; Karl\nGebhardt.\nDuring the war, Gebhardt was responsible for medical\nexperimentation on prisoners at Ravensbr\u00fcck. In Gebhardt\u2019s\ncapacity as an SS consultant surgeon, he treated a high-ranking\nNazi official Reinhard Heydrich, after an attempt was made on his\nlife by a Czechoslovakian resistance group (Silver, 2011). Initially,\nHeydrich\u2019s recovery appeared to be going well. Dr. Theodor\nMorell, Hitler\u2019s personal physician, suggested the use of\nSulfonamide antibiotics, however, Gebhardt refused the\nsuggestion, assuming Heydrich would recover fully on his own\n(Weisz, 2014).\nUnfortunately for Gebhardt, a few days later, Heydrich\ndied, leaving Hitler and the rest of the Nazi superiors angrily 122\nblaming Gebhardt for Heydrich\u2019s death. They claimed Heydrich\ndied of gangrene and Gebhardt was accused of failing to treat him\nwith Sulfonamides. (The autopsy concluded that Heydrich died of\nsepsis due to bacteria, not gangrene).\nIn an attempt to exonerate himself, he carried out a series of\nexperiments on Ravensbr\u00fcck prisoners to defend his belief that\nSulfonamides did not change the course or mortality rate of gas\ngangrene (Silver, 2011). While some of the experiments had\nlegitimate purposes, Gebhardt's desire to experiment with\nSulfonamide, was not one of them. His experiments investigated\nquestions that had long been resolved by valid medical research.\n1935: Prontosil, First Commercially Available Antibiotic\nSulfa drugs were first discovered by a German man named\nGerhard Domagk in 1931 after curing mice with Streptococcal\ninfection (Grundmann, 2004). By 1935 a Sulfa antibiotic called\nProntosil was regularly sold and recommended.\nIn 1939, Domagk was selected by the Nobel Foundation to\nreceive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the\ndiscovery of Prontosil as an antibiotic, the first commercially 123\navailable drug effective against bacterial infections. Unfortunately,\nNazi Germany banned him from attending the award ceremony\nand forced him to decline the award (Time, 2014). This was\nbecause Carl von Ossietzky, an outspoken anti-Nazi pacifist, had\nwon the Nobel Peace Prize in 1935, which had angered the Nazi\nGerman government. Ossietzky was imprisoned and died in a\nconcentration camp (Ryaman). Because of this, in 1937, Adolf\nHitler made an official decree that prohibited German nationals to\naccept the Nobel Prize.\nDomagk was arrested and detained by the Gestapo for two\nweeks where they questioned him incessantly to verify that he was\npolitically loyal to German National Socialism. Because he was a\nmember of the \u201cGerman Working Front,\u201d the \u201cNational Socialist\nPeople\u2019s Welfare Organization,\u201d the \u201cNational Socialist\nAssociation of Germany Technology,\u201d and the \u201cNational Socialist\nMedical Association,\u201d he was able to verify his support for the\nThird Reich and he was released.\nWhile Domagk held membership in many National\nSocialist organizations, he was never a member of the core 124\nNational Socialist organizations, such as the \u201cNational Socialist\nGerman Worker\u2019s Party\u201d (NSDAP), the \u201cSchutzstaffel\u201d (SS), or\nthe \u201cSturmabteilung\u201d (SA). There is no question that Domagk is\none of the most important pathologists of the 20th century and a\ncrucial pioneer of modern medicine. With that being said, a\ncommon perception regarding Domagk is that his experience of\nbeing arrested and detained, along with being prohibited from\naccepting the Nobel Prize makes him a victim who suffered under\nthe oppression of the Nazi regime.\nAfter his release, Domagk recorded and documented his\nexperiences as if he had a target on his back and feared for his life.\nHe said the regime kept him under constant surveillance; he\navoided any contact with the NSDAP (National Socialist German\nWorkers\u2019 Party), insofar as this may have been for the safety of his\nfamily; and he refused offers from the head of the Reich Central\nOffice at the Central Office for Public Health of the NSDAP Reich\nleadership and the head of the German University Commission in\nthe Department of Deputy of the Fuhrer (Uhlendahl, 2020). 125\nWhile Domagk was not treated exceptionally, he cannot\nportray himself as a victim because then he has absolved himself\nfrom all responsibility. Unlike Ossietzky, who was actually a\nvictim, who was starved, beaten, and murdered for being an Anti-\nNazi Pascifist, Domagk was kept prisoner for a short period,\nmanaged to prove his support for Hitler and the Nazi cause enough\nto be released, and continue his work and life until he died in 1964.\nBut at the same time, Domagk was also not a Nazi perpetrator. He\nnever violated the principles of medical ethics as were written\nclearly in the Trials of War Criminals Before the Nuremberg\nMilitary Tribunals Under Control Council Law No. 10.: Volume II.\nThus, it is evident that he cannot be categorized as a Nazi\nperpetrator or as a Nazi victim.\nThroughout his life, Domagk continued to experiment with\nseveral other sulfonamides, particularly Prontalbin, Debenal,\nUliron, and Sulfathiazol, and by 1940, the application of Prontalbin\ncombined with the gas gangrene serum was clinically\nrecommended. 126\nGebhardt Torturing To Prove A Point\nTherefore, based on the timeline alone, it was completely\nunnecessary for Gebhardt to be testing out any new outcomes with\nthe antibiotic several years later. Not to mention, his entire goal to\nprove Sulfonamides worthless when treating gas gangrene was also\nfruitless. Thereby, violating the principles of medical ethics #2,\n\u201cThe experiment should such as to yield fruitful results for the\ngood of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study,\nand not random and unnecessary in nature\u201d (International Military\nTribunal, 1949).\nGebhardt violated all principles of medical ethics seen\nunder the Permissible Medical Experiments section of The Proof\nas to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity in the Medical\nCase Trials of War Criminals Before the Nuremberg Military\nTribunals Under Control Council Law No. 10.\nThese experiments included breaking prisoners\u2019 legs,\nmaking incisions, and infecting them by rubbing various septic\nmaterials including wood chips, dirt, glass, and infected rags into\nthe wounds (Silverm 2011). After Gebhardt created a realistic 127\nbattlefield wound, he would then test the usefulness of\nSulfanilamides.\nHe also attempted bone grafting, or transplanting the limbs\nfrom camp victims to German soldiers wounded on the Russian\nfront. Once the patient\u2019s limb turned to gangrene, they were simply\nsupposed to suffer, even after the leg had turned black and the pain\nwas unbearable. By the time bone grafts were being performed in\nRavensbr\u00fcck, sufficient experimental histologic data, as well as\nsurgical and clinical experience had already accumulated. Even\nthough the procedure had already been proven successful more\nthan a decade earlier, Gebhardt still wanted to experiment, making\nit clear that the victims of these experiments were being tortured\nfor no plausible scientific purpose (Bollinger, 2008).\nWhile many Germans turned to the Nazi Party to survive or\nwork again, as they had lost their employment due to the Great\nDepression prior, Gebhardt was not driven into this by any means\nbut intrinsic motivation and pure hatred. When he ran out of\nhuman subjects, he demanded more (Smithsonian). When that 128\nproved to be a problem, he went over the head of the Killing\nCenter Commandant to get more. Gebhardt was insatiable.\nGebhardt\u2019s Ravensbruck Rabbits\nDuring the Second World War, 63 young students had been\npart of the Polish underground resistance intent on defying the\nbrutal Nazi regime. Captured by the Gestapo, they were sent to\nRavensbr\u00fcck, the concentration camp known as \"Hitler's Hell for\nWomen.\" These girls called themselves \"the Rabbits\" because they\nwere tested on and mutilated by the Third Reich like a scientist\nwould an innocent laboratory animal (Streit, 2018). Another reason\nwas that the experiments made them unable to walk; they could\nonly hop.\nThe SS physicians at Ravensbr\u00fcck generally performed\nexperimental operations on women more than once, sometimes\neven as many as eight times, barely letting the girls heal before\nthey experimented again.\nResults of the experiments were presented at the Third\nMedical Conference of the Consulting Physicians of the German\nArmed Forces in May 1943, attended by many elite military and 129\ncivilian physicians (Streit, 2018). Gebhardt presented very\ncandidly, explaining that the experimental subjects were not\nvolunteers, but concentration camp inmates. It was quite explicit\nthat medical experimentation was being carried out on human\nbeings without their consent. The attendees voiced no criticism.\nGebhardt was guilty of inflicting heinous pain under the\nguise of research and at the end of the Doctors\u2019 Trial, Karl\nGebhardt received a death sentence and was hanged on June 2,\n1948. Even still, the crimes he committed still haunt the medical\ncommunity today.\nWe Must Learn From Our Past Mistakes\nThe history of eugenics is a sobering reminder of how the\npursuit of scientific knowledge, when unchecked, can lead to\ncatastrophic consequences. The atrocities committed under the\nbanner of eugenics during the Nazi regime serve as a warning\nabout the dangers of combining pseudoscientific ideas with\npolitical ideologies. The racial hygiene policies of the Third Reich,\nfounded upon notions of racial superiority and an insidious desire\nfor a pure Aryan race, led to the systematic murder of millions. 130\nThe connection between eugenics and Nazism is a haunting\nreminder of how prejudice and discrimination can be disguised in\nthe language of science, making it essential for society to remain\nvigilant against any attempts to revive or legitimize such\ndangerous ideologies.\nAs we look back upon this dark era in history, it is crucial\nto ensure that we learn from our past mistakes and commit\nourselves to upholding the principles of equality, human rights,\nand social justice. Only by acknowledging and learning from this\ndark past can we hope to build a more just and inclusive future for\nall of humanity.\nReferences\nAdele-Marie, W. (2018). First Lecture.

The Nazis were relentless in their\ntorture and murder of Jewish children. Using women, National\nSocialism wanted to eliminate, \u201cwithin a hundred years, the dark\nGerman type by mating them with blonde women\u201d in order to\ncreate a super race of \u2018racially\u2019 pure, blonde haired, blue eyed\npeople (Toland, 1976, p. 764). Therefore, Jewish children were\ntargeted for death.\nFor pure Germanic blood to survive, the Nazi regime\nestablished a hundred-year plan, conceived in part by Heinrich\nHimmler, Hitler\u2019s Reichsf\u00fchrer, SS. Himmler established\n\u201cLebensborn [Spring of Life], an SS maternity organization whose\nmain function was to adopt racially suitable children for childless\nSS families and to assist racially sound unwed mothers and their\nchildren\u201d (Toland, 1976, p. 764). Children who matched racial\nAryan tenets, with the hopes of creating the blonde super race, 136\nwere stolen and given to SS families to raise (Malone, 2010, para.\n2). The Nazis kidnapped 12,000 children who were given to SS\nfamilies to raise; these innocent children were forced to become\npart of a racial experiment to create a superior Aryan race (Malone,\n2010, para. 2).\nLebensborn was also described as \u201cstud farms where SS\nmen and suitable young women were mated to breed a master race.\u201d\n(Toland, 1976, p. 764). A government that encouraged fertility in\nsuch a way, and used women to achieve racial goals certainly did\nnot view women in an egalitarian fashion, nor were full civil and\npolitical rights for them promoted. Propaganda, literature, and film\nhelped support these genocidal constructs. The world needed to do\nmore to help children. The Kindertransport was one such mission to\nsave Jewish children from certain death.\nPrecious few children survived, as Rabbi Michael Davis\ndiscusses in the incredible story of how his mother escaped certain\ndeath. Maria Anna Mariani writes about perhaps one of the most\nwell-known writers, and, unfortunately, victims of the Nazis, Anne\nFrank. Mariani carefully considers Holocaust memory in her essay. 137\nReferences\nMalone, A. (2010, April 23).

Doubleday and\nCompany, Inc. 138\nHere, we have a critical essay by Rabbi Michael Davis,\nwriting on the Kindertransport, and how this mission saved\nthousands of Jewish children from certain death.\nHolocaust Memory: The Kindertransport\nRabbi Michael Davis\nThe Kindertransport is the story of the dramatic rescue of\nJewish children from Nazi Europe on the eve of the Second World\nWar, racing against the clock and with a fantastic outcome. As a\nresult of the Kindertransport 10,000 Jewish children survived the\nHolocaust. Without the Kindertransport, these children would\nalmost certainly have perished along with the 1,500,000 other\nminors murdered in the Nazi killing centers. In the last twenty\nyears, awards bestowed on participants and books have been\npublished by survivors. A film version starring Judi Dench won an\nOscar.\nWhat was the Kindertransport?\nAt the end of 1938, the Jewish citizens of Nazi lands faced\nunprecedented harassment and outright violence from their fellow\ncountrymen. Nazi authorities unleashed their uniformed militias on 139\ntheir fellow Jewish citizens. Faced with this betrayal by their\ncountrymen, German-speaking Jews sought ways out.\nBut the world was preparing for a world war that was\nlooming; refugees were not welcome. A public campaign was\nlaunched in England and the British Parliament admitted thousands\nof unaccompanied Jewish children to the United Kingdom - so\nlong as there were British foster families ready to assume\nresponsibility for them. As desperate parents sent their children to\nthe homes of strangers in a foreign land, they told their children -\nand themselves: this separation is only temporary, only until all\nthis blows over.\nHowever, as we know, with few exceptions, these parents\ndid not survive the Holocaust. But their children, safe in England,\ndid. Eighty years later, hundreds of thousands of their children,\ngrandchildren and great-grandchildren are alive today thanks to the\nKindertransport.\nI am one of that next generation. My mother had just turned\n7 years old, when in late December 1938, she and her two older\nsisters kissed their mother Rosa goodbye at the Vienna train 140\nstation. It was the last time they would see her. Under the hostile\ngaze of Nazi police, the sisters boarded the train headed north to\nHolland and on to ferries to cross the English Channel.\nMy maternal grandfather, had already escaped Nazi Austria\nto Belgium. In early November 1938, a red sports car with a Nazi\nofficer and driver drew up to the family\u2019s business, a delicatessen.\nA truckload of Nazi police followed. They had come to take away\nthe Jewish men. My mother watched from high up in the family\u2019s\napartment across the street. As the Nazis entered the shop through\nthe front door, David slipped out of the delicatessen\u2019s back door.\nRosa told the men that her husband was away on business. They\nthreatened to seize her daughter who was working with her as a\nhostage. Meanwhile, David hid in the apartment building\u2019s laundry\nroom up in the attic.\nSeveral days later on the night of November 9, the Nazis\ntorched synagogues across Germany and Austria. This was\nKristallnacht [the November Pogrom, or Night of Broken Glass].\nThe nearby synagogue went up in flames and the sparks threatened\nto ignite the apartment building\u2019s roof. That was when David 141\ndecided it was no longer safe to hide there. He fled Vienna to join\nhis brother in Antwerp, Belgium.\nAt the end of December 1938, after she sent off the girls to\nEngland, Rosa too got out of Austria, travelling through Germany\nto join her husband in Antwerp. She was accompanied by her\nyoungest child, Michael (whom I am named after). At five years\nold, he was too young to be sent away to England with his sisters.\nThe Nazis famously kept meticulous records of their\ncrimes. There\u2019s a record of a transport in 1942 from Antwerp to\nAuschwitz. Rosa is listed there as are her son Michael and an\ninfant daughter, Charlotte, born to David and Rosa after the Nazis\noccupied Belgium. There is another entry in the Nazis\u2019 log\nrecording that transport\u2019s arrival in Auschwitz two days later. But\nin this entry, Rosa is missing. She had died in one of the cattle\ncars. On arrival in Auschwitz, 7-year-old Michael and 18-month-\nold Charlotte were immediately taken to the killing center at\nBirkenau to be murdered.\nMeanwhile in England, the three sisters were assigned to\nJewish foster homes. Following their arrival and for the next 18 142\nmonths, Rosa continued to write to her three daughters\nfrom Antwerp. This ended in May 1940 when the German army\nreached Belgium and cut off shipping routes and postal delivery to\nEngland.\nThe girls stayed in touch by corresponding with each other\nwith handwritten letters. The handwritten letters my mother wrote\nto her older sister throughout the war years tell their own story.\nWithin the space of a few months of arriving in England, the\nangular Gothic handwriting she had learned in school in Vienna\nmorphs into the rounded letters of an English schoolgirl. Her\nGerman gives way to English. Within a few letters, the only\nGerman she still had was the farewell: viele grusse [many\ngreetings]. It was heartbreaking to read one of my mother\u2019s letters\nto her older sister, Ilse: \u201cMami wrote me in German but I don\u2019t\nunderstand it anymore.\u201d\nEven as the Kindertransport children and their foster\nfamilies waited for the war to end and the promised reunion with\ntheir biological parents, the children became assimilated into\nEnglish ways. Like immigrants the world over, the Jewish refugees 143\nwere expected to be grateful and to just fit in. My mother felt the\nshame of being \u201ca refugee girl.\u201d\nMy mother did forget, at least outwardly. She became\nBritish, she married and had her own family. She never spoke\nabout her childhood experiences to me or my siblings. She wasn\u2019t\nin touch with her fellow refugees.\nThis changed suddenly in 1988. London-based Bertha\nLeverton was the first to break the silence when she issued a call\nfor the first reunion of the Kindertransport survivors. For Bertha,\nthe turning point was seeing her 14-year-old granddaughter. It\ndawned on her that that was exactly how old she had been when\nshe said goodbye to her parents in Munich, Germany.\nAt that first Kindertransport reunion in London in 1989,\nmy mother reconnected with people she hadn\u2019t seen in fifty years.\nThe Kindertransport continued to gather annually. Friendships\nwere rekindled. My mother became involved in the\nKindertransport organization.\nThe \u201cKinder\u201d as they affectionately called each other no\nlonger carried the shame of being refugees living off the kindness 144\nof strangers. They were mature, accomplished adults, truly grateful\nto their adopted homeland, proud of having made it.\nWhen the Kinder started to tell their story in public it was\nhalf a century and more after the Holocaust. The generation of\nadult Holocaust survivors - those who had been imprisoned in the\nconcentration camps or survived the war in Europe in other ways -\nwas dying out. In my work as a rabbi, we were finding it\nincreasingly hard to find Holocaust survivors who could speak\nabout their story. So, the Kindertransport and the \u201chidden\nchildren\u201d inherited the role of Holocaust storyteller, teaching\nchildren and adults about what had happened.\nNow, as my mother ages, the task of telling the story has\ndevolved to the next generation, including me. I have told the story\nat the Illinois Holocaust Museum and in various synagogues.\nWhen I tell my Mother\u2019s story, I marvel at the logistical nightmare\nof organizing and transporting this precious cargo across hostile\nborders; the herculean task of mobilizing public figures in England\nto get Parliament to accept the children; and all the Jewish and\nother families who took in a refugee child when their own future 145\nwas so precarious.\nOne detail that stood out for me was the particular\nselflessness of the adult chaperones, those German Jews who\naccompanied the transports of children from Nazi territory to safe\nharbor in England. These Jewish adults were sworn to return home\nafter delivering their charges. The temptation to remain in England\nmust have been great indeed. But the penalty for violating the\nagreement with the British government could have jeopardized the\nentire Kindertransport project: it was children only. So, the\nchaperones did go back to continental Europe to take their chances\nin what would, in a few short years, would become the Holocaust.\nI also wonder at what motivated people to devote\nthemselves to the Kindertransport. Some were established\nactivists, others were Jewish communal leaders like Rabbi\nSolomon Schonfeld, the son-on-law of the Chief Rabbi of the\nUnited Kingdom. But some did not get involved in any similar\nactivity either before or after the Kindertransport like the young\nbusinessman Nicolas Winton, who was later knighted by the\nQueen for his leadership of the Kindertransport. 146\nFinally, there are the untold stories of the Kindertransport.\nYes, it was a phenomenal success story. And yet: most of these\nchildren never saw their parents and other family again. The lucky\nfew parents who somehow survived the Nazi concentration camps\nand war met a much older child or even young adult, one who had\nchanged beyond recognition during the seven years of separation\ngrowing with another family in a foreign language and culture. The\nchild whose dream it was to fit in and shed the stigma of \u201cJewish\nrefugee\u201d now had \u201cHolocaust survivor\u201d parents who spoke English\nwith a heavy accent staring out again in this new post-war world.\nMeanwhile, the Kinder had endured the Blitz and other\ndeprivations of war. Everything was rationed in wartime Britain.\nMy mother remembers going to bed hungry. The children\u2019s\nwellbeing was entirely in the hands of the foster parents. There\nwere no social workers to monitor the families. The children had\nno flesh and blood relatives to look out for them. Some children\ntruly became equal members of their foster family, others were not\nso fortunate.\nI wouldn\u2019t be alive today without the kindness, grit, 147\nbravery and effectiveness of the people of the Kindertransport, the\nselfless courage and foresight of grandparents I never met, the\ngenerosity of the British government and the Jewish foster families\nthat took my mother in and my mother\u2019s resilience under great\nhardship. Also, I wonder what the impact of all these events had on\nmy mother and our family.\nAs I write this in 2021, the Kinder are a dwindling group.\nThe youngest of them is approaching 90 years old. But the\ncommunity of memory they established by telling their story\ncontinues to expand in widening circles. The experience of being a\nchild refugee separated from one\u2019s parents is sadly a universal one,\nas we know all too well here in the U.S. As a parent myself, I am\nreminded of how precious and fragile a child is. This is not an easy\nstory to tell but it is an important one to know. Amidst the\nincomprehensible, dehumanizing bestiality of the Holocaust, the\nKindertransport is a beacon of sanity, kindness and courage. It is\none example of the triumph of humanity against all odds.\nFurther reading/viewing:\nIn the past twenty years since the Kindertransport story 148\nbecame known, a plethora of materials have been published. A\ngood place to start is one of the first such works, the documentary\nInto the Arms of Strangers (2000) Warner Bros starring Judi\nDench. The documentary is based on the book by the same name\nthat is worth reading in its own right. The book, Into the Arms of\nStrangers is by Mark Jonathan Harris and Deborah Oppenheimer.\nAlso, The Children of Willesden Lane (2003) Grand Central\nPublishing by Mona Gollabek and Lee Cohen. A recent, scholarly\nbook that goes into the complicated consequences of the\nKindertransport that I alluded to is The Kindertransport -\nContesting Memory by Jennifer Craig-Norton, published by\nIndiana University Press in 2019. 149\nIn considering children of the Holocaust, often the first\nperson that comes to mind is Anne Frank.

Re-examining the complex editorial history in light of\nnew theoretical concerns regarding universalism and world\nliterature, I ask, not only what is an author, but what is an editor\nand\u2014perhaps most crucially\u2014what responsibilities does this latter\nhave toward the witness.\nI want to begin this essay about the history of a text by\ncontemplating an image (this book is no longer in print): 150\nA girl\u2014almost a Barbie doll\u2014with a dreamy look, her lips tracing\nout the profile of a heart, her teenage bust swaddled in a jean\njacket. To find out who she is, we have to decipher those signs\u2014\nthe syllables above the girl\u2019s elbow and across her shirt. They read:\n\u201cA Jewish girl speaking her mind. Anne\u2019s Diary. Growth of the\nhearth of an adolescent girl, sharp criticism of the adult\u2019s world,\nadmirable courage to \u201cfirmly\u201d overcome difficulties without\nallowing them to break her.\u201d 1\n1 Hwang Hyong-Kyu is the translator of this particular edition of the Diary of\nAnne Frank, published by Samwon, which no longer exists. This book cover does\nnot represent the standard way in which The Diary of Anne Frank circulates in\nKorea, and it has been intensely criticized by Koreans themselves (especially in\nprivate blogs). Nonetheless, the book cover interests me as a symptom, because it\nrepresents the apex of a process of depersonalization of Anne\u2019s story and image\u2014\nas I will argue in my article. I would like to thank Kyeong-Hee Choi, Professor\nof Modern Korean Literature at the University of Chicago, for finding out\nprecious bibliographical information about this edition of the Diary. 151\nAnne\u2019s Diary. Just Anne, without Frank. Stripped to the\nbare absolute of a first name, this is one of the ways in which the\nmost famous diary in history circulated in South Korea. But what\nis startling about this illustration is not the absence of a family\nname. It is the blonde hair, the absent-minded expression, the\nlipstick and the jean jacket that provoke incredulity, indignation, or\nsome other emotion as well. But instead of allowing these\nemotions to coagulate into instantaneous forms of judgment, I\nwould like to try now to understand. I would like to try to\nunderstand what made the conception of this idea and then its\nunimpeded circulation possible. I would like to reflect on Anne\nFrank using this unexpected reproduction of her as my point of\ndeparture.\nLet us take another look at it. The most striking aspect is\nthe complete removal of identifying features, or even human traits:\nwhat we see is a neutral face, with no marks of individuality, no\ndeviations from the norm. It is a depersonalized, almost plastic\nface. It could be a diagram or the idea of a face. The lack of a\nfamily name only accentuates this abstraction of personal traits: 152\nAnne has no ancestry, no roots. She is a girl\u2014and in this case the\nindefinite article signals what she has most in common with all\nother girls.\nHow did this complete erasure of individual data, this\ntransformation of Anne Frank into a generic young girl, become\npossible? The book cover is not an isolated case: rather, it is the\napex in a process of candy-coated rarefication of the image and\nwords of Anne Frank. In Japan, for example, the diary is read\nprimarily as an emblematic representation of adolescence, to the\npoint that \u201cAnne Frank\u201d is the code name that young girls whisper\nto each other when they get their first period.2 But even when the\ndiary is read without isolating its adolescent aspect, and hence,\nmore fully and completely as a testimony of the Shoah, there is\nstill something in its pages that irresistibly invites the reader to\nidentification. What is it? Why is it so easy to submerge ourselves\nin Anne Frank?\n2 On the Japanese reception of the Diary, see \u201cWhy are the Japanese so Fascinated\nwith Anne Frank?\u201d in Haaretz, January 22, 2014,\nhttp://www.haaretz.com/jewish/news/1.569938, and \u201cJapanese Retain\nFascination with Anne Frank\u201d in Deutsche Welle, March 2, 2015,\nhttp://www.dw.com/en/japanese-retain-fascination-with-anne-frank/a-18284457. 153\nA lot of people have wondered about this temptation. Philip\nRoth is one of them. In The Ghost Writer he portrays an Anne\nFrank who somehow managed to survive the concentration camps.\nThis particular Anne is the projection of Zuckerman\u2019s fantasies\u2014\nthe narrator-character whose first appearance as Roth\u2019s alter-ego\nwas in 1979 in The Ghost Writer. Zuckerman imagines that a\nmysterious girl\u2014a femme fatale, he calls her\u2014encountered at the\nhouse of an established writer is the Anne Frank of the diary.\nWhile he scrutinizes the angles of a female face now almost in its\ntwenties, Zuckerman fantasizes a fate for the character that extends\nwell beyond the diary\u2019s ending. After having witnessed the deaths\nof her mother and sister at Bergen-Belsen, Anne decides that it\nwould be better \u201cto put an ocean the size of the Atlantic between\nherself and what she needed to forget.\u201d3 She chooses America as\n3 Philip Roth, The Ghost Writer (New York: Farrar, Strauss and Giroux, 1979),\n126.

Like in this\nsection from the diary: \u201cmy first wish after the war is to become a\nDutch citizen. I love the Dutch, I love this country, I love the\n4 Roth, The Ghost Writer, 134. 155\nlanguage, and I want to work here.\u201d5 The author depicted by Roth\nwho reads her own work understands that it was precisely this\nabsence of Jewish traditions, this insistence on assimilation, that\nfueled the extraordinary success of the book and its ability to\nbecome an emotional mirror for anyone who dives between its\nlines.\nNestled inside Roth\u2019s novel we thus find a preliminary\nhypothesis regarding the remarkable universalization of Anne, one\nthat reveals an unexpected opposition : in this instance, universal is\nthe antithesis of Jewish. But the reason the Franks came to\nsymbolize \u201cthe people next door\u201d6 in the collective imagination is\nnot only because of how they are represented as a perfectly\nassimilated family. There is another factor at work that encourages\n5 Anne Frank, The Diary of a Young Girl: The Definitive Edition, ed. Otto H.\nFrank and Mirjam Pressler, trans. Susan Masotty (New York: Doubleday, 1995),\n263.\n6 See Meyer Levin\u2019s review of the Diary, published in The New York Times on\nJune 15, 1952. After the War, Meyer wrote a play based on the Diary, but it was\nnot produced (according to Levin, who recounts his frustrated reaction to this\nrefusal in his autobiography The Obsession, the decision was based on his\n\u201cexcessively Jewish\u201d approach to the Diary). See Meyer Levin, The Obsession\n(New York: Simon and Schuster, 1974). On Levin\u2019s \u201cobsession\u201d with Anne\nFrank, see Lawrence Graver, An obsession with Anne Frank: Meyer Levin and\nThe Diary (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995), and Francine Prose,\n\u201cThe Play,\u201d in Anne Frank: The Book, The Life, The Afterlife, 177-223. 156\nuntrammeled identification: the patina of hopeful optimism that\nenvelops the diary. \u201cI still believe, in spite of everything, that\npeople are truly good at heart,\u201d7 reads the most famous sentence\nwritten by Anne Frank, played up and canonized by the prestige of\na motto. This is the sentence charged with encapsulating the\ndiary\u2019s message and appearing on the back jacket of every edition,\nproliferating into the more than sixty languages of the countries\nwhere it has been translated, including Italy, of course, where the\npreface to the first edition comes from the pen of Natalia Ginzburg.\nCommenting on \u201cthe innocent voice that was silenced,\u201d she\nwrites that \u201cwe stash away in our memory the trusting, untroubled\nvibration, the courageous goodness of this voice that has overcome\ndeath.\u201d8 Before storing away hope, though, when we approach the\ndiary, explains Ginzburg, we must keep in mind \u201cit\u2019s tragic\nconclusion; without being able to linger on the specific moments\nthat it describes, looking continuously beyond it.\u201d9 While this may\n7 Frank, The Diary of a Young Girl: The Definitive Edition, 328.\n8 Natalia Ginzburg, preface to the first Italian edition of Il diario di Anna Frank,\ntrans.

Because there\nare many who downplay the documentary value of the diary: it\nshould not be read as a paradigmatic text about the Shoah because\nit represents a non-standard testimony. It is nothing but the\nchronicle of a crystallized fear that, in actuality, leaves out the true\nevent: the deportation.10 But the lacuna in the story is precisely\nwhat gives authenticity to this testimony, making it all the more\nprecious and troubling, because that void at the end is the trace of\nAnne\u2019s failure to survive. Her words cannot be discredited because\nof their incompleteness, but rather valued all the more because of\ntheir eloquent partiality. The diary is a story of the truth, even\nthough we know it is not the whole truth.\nBut let us go back to the optimism that crystallized into the\nemotional symbol of the diary. \u201cI still believe, in spite of\neverything, that people are truly good at heart.\u201d I am repeating this\nsentence, which extols human tolerance and goodness no matter\n10 See at least Lawrence L. Langer, \u201cThe Uses-and Misuses-of a Young Girl\u2019s\nDiary: \u2018If Anne Frank Could Return from among the Murdered, She Would Be\nAppaled,\u2019\u201d in Anne Frank: Reflections on Her Life and Legacy, ed.

In Ozik\u2019s view, the\noptimism of the theatrical version is so extreme that it inspired a\ncomment by Natalie Portman, who made her Broadway debut in\n1997 in the role of Anne Frank: \u201cshe\u2019s fun, she\u2019s hopeful, and\nshe\u2019s a happy person,\u201d the actress is reported to have said in an\ninterview given at the end of the show.\nFor Ozik, the candy-coated rarefication of Anne Frank was\nnot set into motion purely by the playwrights of the Broadway\nshow, guided by the idea of smoothing down Anne\u2019s individual\nfeatures to the point of making her a disembodied being. For Ozik,\nthe person responsible first and foremost for this process was Otto\nFrank, her father, the one who survived: the only one to survive.\n11 Cynthia Ozick, \u201cWho Owns Anne Frank?\u201d in Quarrel and Quandary (New\nYork: Vintage, 2000), 74-102. 159\nBefore submitting his daughter\u2019s manuscript to the publisher, Otto\nFrank apparently made a substantial number of cuts to purge the\ntext of its most disturbing elements: the discovery of sexuality, her\ninflammatory comments about her mother, and the darker tones of\nAnne\u2019s reflections. Part of his strategy was to emphasize the\nelement of assimilation in the hope that the diary would gain a\nwider audience.\nWhat was Otto\u2019s role in the text\u2019s reception? Did he really\ncensor the diary for profit motives or, as has been suggested at\ntimes, even prompted by an internalized antisemitism?\nEstablishing the father\u2019s role in the composition of the diary\nbecame a question of legal urgency in 2016, because it determines\nwhen the copyright on the text expires. The Anne Frank Funds\nFoundation12 has recently announced that Otto Frank is the true\ncoauthor of his daughter\u2019s manuscript, a decision that has stunned\neveryone, and that considerably extends the copyright on the diary\npast its original date. The period will henceforth no longer be\n12 Founded in Basel in 1963, the AFF has acted as Otto Frank\u2019s universal heir\nsince his death in 1980; its purpose is to promote his daughter\u2019s writings and\nprotect them from illegal uses. 160\ncalculated starting from Anne\u2019s death, but rather from 1980, the\nyear of Otto\u2019s death.13 There is no lack of controversy surrounding\nthis decision: it would appear that it is nothing but a strategy on the\npart of the Anne Frank foundation to police the manuscript\u2019s\ncontent and ensure that they continue to receive the royalties that it\ngenerates.\nFrom censor to coauthor: that is quite a difference. Otto\u2019s\nnew status as coauthor is astonishing; it is so astonishing that it\ncalls for a patient, close examination of the two philological\neditions of the diary. Yes, two: the critical edition published in\n1986, made indispensable by accusations denying the authenticity\nof the text, labeling it a fraud; and the so-called definitive edition\nof 1991\u2014the only one approved by the Anne Frank Funds.14 In\n13 In the United States the copyright will in any case expire in 2047, because\nAmerican law protects works for 95 years starting from the date of their first\npublication, which took place in 1952.\n14 Here are the bibliographical references:\n- The Diary of Anne Frank: The Critical Edition.

Both the editions show us that the diary is\na layered work; but while the critical edition limits itself to setting\nout the progressive drafts of the diary, the definitive edition also\ngives us a new version of the text that is different from the one\npublished in 1947 when the diary first appeared in print.\nThe new, definitive version is certainly longer (by 25%)\nand the expansion is due to the reintegration of passages that were\nmissing from the first publication.

But, in reality, a careful comparison\nbetween the various editions of the work\u2014of which there are four\n(a, b, c, and d), the beginnings of a philological alphabet\u2014points\nto a different assessment.15 Studying the genesis of this text may\n15 For a philological analysis of the Diary, see also Philippe Lejeune, \u201cHow Anne\nFrank Rewrote the Diary of Anne Frank,\u201d in On Diary, ed.

When\nwe read a diary, we imagine that it is an immediate chronicle of\neveryday events and thoughts, that the traces of its dates have\nspontaneously transferred the flow of time onto the page, without\nany retouching. The features of the diary genre, exhaustively\ninventoried by Philipp Lejeune,16 are as follows: cryptic allusions,\ncontents that are redundant and vague, a presentation that is\nfragmentary and confused.\nThe diary is diametrically opposed to the book: it belongs\ninstead to the order of manuscripts\u2014a manuscript that is eternal,\neternally suspended, ignorant of its end and allergic to any\nretouching. If this is the way things are, an authentic diary,\nmeaning an honest one, is unpublishable. Even more than that: it is\nunreadable. Anne Frank\u2019s diary was no exception: \u201cMy writings all\nmixed up, I\u2019m jumping from one thing to another, and sometimes I\nCaplan, \u201cRevisiting the Diary: Rereading Anne Frank\u2019s Rewriting,\u201d in Bloom\u2019s\nModern Critical Interpretations: Anne Frank\u2019s The Diary of Anne Frank-New\nEdition, ed. and with and introduction by Harold Bloom (New York: Bloom\u2019s\nLiterary Criticism, 2010), 83-100.\n16 Lejeune, \u201cComposing a Diary\u201d, in On Diary, 168-175. 163\nseriously doubt whether anyone will ever be interested in this\ndrivel. They\u2019ll probably call it \u2018The Musings of an Ugly\nDuckling.\u2019\u201d17 The diary was thus a raw proliferation of notes \u2013 this\nwas how it remained until 1944, when Anne listening furtively in\nher hideout heard a radio announcement that encouraged listeners,\nonce the war was over, to publish all personal writings conceived\nduring the years of fear, promoting the creation of a popular,\nprivate archive for the benefit of posterity. This announcement\ngave Anne the momentum to transform her diary into a book, into\na text no longer governed by the idiosyncratic, casual laws of\nsomeone doing something purely for herself, but rather of\nsomething designed for the gaze and judgment of a public. Her\ninstinctive idea was to turn it into a detective novel, a narrative\ncapable of converting the repetitive, documentary flow of the\noriginal notes into a text electrified by a gripping plot.\nShe then started to rewrite the diary, from the beginning,\nand in the new version her style became more controlled and\nmature, more evocative and descriptive. And yet, the project of\n17 Frank, The Diary of a Young Girl: The Definitive Edition, 261. 164\nwriting a novel\u2014a work of fiction\u2014did not really take shape: the\nrewriting instead preserved the essence and structure of the diary.\nAnne consistently manipulates the original notes, but she does so\nprimarily by condensing and reshaping the information conveyed\nand by rearranging the dates so that they line up more uniformly in\ntime, as if each day prompted a new observation.\nShe thus injected a \u201cdiary effect,\u201d an effete de journal,18\ninto the new writing, mimicking the contours of the diary, and\nrestraining the spontaneous impulse of the first notes. This was so\nsuccessful that the new version (b, philologically speaking)\nappears to be more authentic\u2014more honest, as Lejeune would\nsay\u2014than the original one (a). The wish for future readers to see\nher pages inspired the girl to emphasize some parts\u2014especially the\ndesire for assimilation\u2014and to eliminate others: mischievous\nremarks about her family, the most intimate moments of her love\nstory with Peter, the most uninhibited comments about her\nsexuality. Anne was thus the first person to censor herself\u2014or to\nedit herself. A careful philological comparison actually\n18 Lejeune, \u201cThe Diary as \u2018Antifiction,\u2019\u201d in On Diary, 207. 165\ndemonstrates that the appropriate term for describing the passage\nfrom version a to version b is that of editing: a sophisticated,\nconscious self-editing.\nAnd now we come to the father: when Otto Frank finished\nreading the diary that had been preserved from destruction by the\nhands of Miep Gies, he found two different editions of his\ndaughter\u2019s text, both of which were dissatisfying: Anne did not\nactually manage to rewrite draft b, destined for the public, in its\nentirety; it thus covers a shorter period of time than draft a. In\npreparing the version of the text to be given to the publisher\n(indicated by the letter c), Otto was thus forced to meld together\nthese two drafts. He then thought that it would be a good idea to\nreintroduce all the parts about Anne\u2019s love story that she had\nexpunged out of embarrassment and to protect Peter\u2019s anonymity.\nAlthough Otto reintroduced several passages that were\nstreaked with sentimental tones, he also made further cuts: he\neliminated off-putting passages about Anne\u2019s mother and\nexpunged a part that burns with feminist passion. So what is Otto\nFrank\u2019s role in the composition of the text? Censor? Coauthor? 166\nCurator? Editor? According to some, including Philippe Lejeune\nand Francine Prose, what this father performed was an excellent\njob of editing, completing and refining the work that Anne had\nstarted on her own. He might reasonably be criticized for not\nhaving declared the corrective work that he had performed: for\nhaving presented the edition of the diary as a product rather than a\nprocess. Could he have done otherwise? Perhaps he might have,\neven though the diary\u2019s success seems to be intimately connected\nto this philological secretiveness of his, which associated the\nwritings exclusively to his daughter\u2019s name, passing over his own\ncontribution and neutralizing his own self.\nThis affair raises some theoretical issues about the visibility\nand power of the editor, who in this case acquires a pair of\nsynonyms that are difficult to reconcile and that appear to belong\nto different lexical classes: censor and coauthor. The question to\nask ourselves, then, is: what can an editor do? The myth of editing\nfirst appeared, perhaps, with Maxwell Perkins, the legendary editor\nof Hemingway and Fitzgerald. The editor is cast as a sort of hyper-\nreader, who acts on behalf of a community of readers working 167\ntogether to achieve what it considers to be the best publishing\noutcome. What does \u2018best\u2019 mean in the context in which the diary\nwas originally published? The reality that Otto Frank had to\nconfront was limited by a series of constraints that were more\nethical than esthetic in nature: most of his actions seem to have\nbeen motivated by a strategy that was quite common in the\npublishing world after the Second World War, a strategy dictated\nby a sense of emotional delicacy toward the collective psyche,\nwhich was not to be overly upset. (These were the years in Italy\nwhen Primo Levi\u2019s manuscript If This is a Man was rejected\nrepeatedly \u2013 because it was too upsetting. Only a small publisher,\nDe Silva, agreed to publish it for him, and in a limited number of\ncopies.)19\n19 On the publishing vicissitudes of If This Is a Man, see Luisa Mangoni, Pensare\ni libri.

Without editing,\nmany fundamental works would never have been published and\nthis would probably have been the fate of the diary, too, had Otto\nnot intervened to sense the atmosphere of his times, positioning\nhimself between the work and the public, acting as mediator,\nrestorer, and even\u2014yes\u2014impresario. It is true that the diary falls\nunder the realm of nonfiction, despite the rewriting that reshaped\nit, and when nonfiction is involved, the work of editing must be\nmore disciplined and servile than ever. And yet I do not believe\nthat Otto Frank violated the two fundamental precepts of the craft\nformulated by Maxwell Perkins, which go like this: \u201cAn editor\nshould strive for anonymity\u201d and \u201can editor at most releases\nenergy... He creates nothing.\u201d20 Otto Frank creates nothing, and\nthe decision on the part of the Anna Frank Funds to consider him\nmore than simply an editor, and even a coauthor of the diary, is\npuzzling.\n20 Quoted in Gavin James Bower, \u201cThe Age of Amazon still needs editors like\nMax Perkins,\u201d in The Guardian, October 4, 2013,\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/oct/04/age-amazon-\neditors-max-perkins.

Scott Berg, Max Perkins: Editor of Genius (New\nYork: Riverhead, 1997). 169\nIt is more than puzzling: the decision is truly disorienting,\nbecause now we are no longer authorized to read the version edited\nby the father (c), but exclusively the new definitive version (d), the\nonly one approved by the Anne Frank Funds: \u201cthere is no other\nversion of the diary that the world can know,\u201d pronounces Mirjam\nPressler, the writer responsible for this new configuration of the\ntext. \u201cTo restore Anne Frank\u2019s authentic voice,\u201d is the objective to\nwhich Mirjam Pressler aspires, and one of the ways she pursues it\nis to fill in all the gaps that the stratification of the editing opened\nup. The troubling aspect about this new version is how even\nAnne\u2019s self-editing has been neutralized: for Pressler the \u201ctrue\nvoice\u201d of the girl supposedly resides in the totality of the original\nnotes, in the uncensored, magmatic writing that spills out in the\nfirst draft. But doesn\u2019t Anne\u2019s authentic voice also reside in the\nlacunas?\nThe lacunas\u2014the selection of information that carves out\nevocative spaces from between the lines\u2014are just as capable and\nequally entitled to participate in representation as the lines that are\ntraced out. By considering the spaces opened up by Anne as 170\ncavities that swallow up the true, Pressler instead seems to\ncondemn the concept of lacuna to its prime but not exclusive\nmeaning of a geographic depression (from the Latin lacus: cavity\nin the earth). And that is not all: as Lejeune demonstrates, while\nPressler cancels out the work of self-editing that had been required\nto smooth out the rough edges in the original contents, she\nwelcomes the patient, intense syntactic and lexical work to which\nAnne dedicated herself in order to sublimate the stylistic crudeness\nof version a. The conception of the Pressler edition is thus\ncontradictory, because it presupposes that the reader of today will\nappreciate Anne\u2019s boldness but will be put off by her original\nstylistic clumsiness.\nIn addition to denouncing the contradictions of a legal\nmatter that concerns us today, this long exploration into the depths\nof the diary has shown us that the editing begun by Anne and\ncontinued by her father had contributed to the wide diffusion and\ncirculation of the text. Its universalization was therefore\npremeditated: it arose from between the lines. \u201cOne single Anne\nFrank moves us more than the countless others who suffered just 171\nas she did but whose faces have remained in the shadows. Perhaps\nit is better that way; if we were capable of taking in all the\nsuffering of all those people, we would not be able to live.\u201d21 This\ncomes from The Drowned and the Saved by Primo Levi. Faces,\nwrites Primo Levi. It is significant that he uses this word,\nmaterializing before our eyes a conglomerate of anonymous faces\nbeside an endlessly reproduced single face, that of Anne Frank.\nThe face of Anne Frank is a collective face; it is the face of the\nShoah; it is the expressive vector of that event. The features of the\ngirl absorb those of the anonymous faces, who in that oval\nrecapture the possibility of a posthumous existence; just as the\ngirl\u2019s words do, that by proxy also take on the drowned testimonies\nof the others, allowing them to survive.\nPrimo Levi\u2019s remark suggests that Anne Frank\u2019s\npervasiveness is not solely attributable to her words: a crucial role\nis also played by her image, by her face. Why is this the case?\nWhat is special about her face? This, perhaps: it is the face of a\n21 Primo Levi, The Drowned and the Saved (New York: Vintage International,\n1988), 56. 172\nlittle girl. Children are particularly iconic because they are abstract,\nundistorted: the impurities of identity and becoming have not yet\naccumulated on their hollow, malleable structure, which makes\nthem ready to assume any contour or protuberance. Anne\u2019s face, as\na child, is a surface onto which any face can be projected (the\nSouth Korean cover with which we started only takes this process\nto an extreme, generating a synthetic face without qualities that can\nbe endlessly embodied.)22\nThe images of children lend themselves enormously to\nidentification: they become a repository of empathic energy and\noffer themselves up continuously for reproduction, so much so that\ntheir evidence as documents is almost automatically converted into\nthe fascination of icons. Identification \u2014with an image or with a\nnarrated series of events\u2014is certainly not an innocuous process. It\nshould be disciplined, without arriving at the point of dissolving\nthe boundaries between the self and the non-self but participating\n22 On the iconicity of Anne Frank, see Brigitte Sion, \u201cAnne Frank as Icon, from\nHuman Rights to Holocaust Denial\u201d and Daniel Belasco, \u201cSuturing In: Anne\nFrank as Conceptual Model for Visual Art,\u201d both in Anne Frank Unbound, 193-\n215 and 254-265.

We are\nthoughtfully reminded of this by the most self-critical theoreticians\nof Trauma Studies, like Dominick LaCapra23 and Marianne\nHirsch,24 who insists on the risk of indiscriminate appropriation\nspecifically in thinking about Anne Frank and her attractive\niconicity as a little girl: innocent, vulnerable, wise but also erotic.\nDespite all the warnings to approach Anne\u2019s image with the\nappropriate emotional distance, and to read the diary without\nblurring the important areas of difference and alterity that permeate\nit, one can hardly remain unaware of how effortlessly this text\ncirculates, disseminating the memory of Anne Frank and the Shoah\nin a space that by now is definitively globalized.25 It is a space that\n23 Dominick LaCapra, Writing History, Writing Trauma (Baltimore: John\nHopkins University Press, 2001).\n24 Marianne Hirsch, The Generation of Postmemory.

(George W.) Bush was equated to Hitler and the\nNorth Koreans felt persecuted like the Jews. However, although\nthey sympathized with Anne Frank, the students who were\ninterviewed did not approve of the victim character. She is weak,\n26 See Katherine Wilson, \u201cAnne Frank Abroad,\u201d in World Literature Today, Vol.\n87, No. 3 (May/June 2013), 28-33. 175\nthey told the journalists. We must not do what she did: we must\nfight, not hide ourselves.\nThis case of the diary\u2019s reception is really cause for\nthought, a great deal of it: for a variety of reasons. Here is the most\nsensational one. The diary, as a vehicle of the Shoah, allows a\nparallel story of oppression and victimization to be told: the roles\nof victims and perpetrators are reproduced with perfect symmetry.\nAnd yet the North Korean children reject the stance of the victim\nand everything associated with it, including the paradoxical\nheroism that normally acts as the catalyst for identification in the\nposition of the victim. The North Korean children are indifferent to\nthe mythological prestige that has gradually come to be heaped on\nthis category. What they see in a victim is only passivity and\nresignation: aspects of somebody who is in the process of losing\nthe fight for life. Courting paradox, it could even be said that in\nNorth Korea there is a process of reception underway that is more\nnuanced than processes of reception elsewhere that also employ\nthe diary as a paradigm of victimhood and yet signal no difference\nwith respect to the event. 176\nBut our inquiry into the diary\u2019s circulation cannot end here.\nThere is something disturbing about this dislocation\u2014most\nprobably the bare fact that the text is being led into nomadism, into\npermanent exile. It is true that there is always a sense of\ndisorientation associated with the dimension of the beyond27 \u2014and\nyet, in the era of World Literature, we know very well that this is\nthe fate of all texts. The uneasiness that arises comes from the\nhistorical and emotional charge deposited in the pages of Anne\nFrank, which triggers an instinctive sense of protection when the\ndiary is recodified elsewhere. We28 seek to protect the text from\nreadings that alter it\u2014and we almost demand that it circulate with\nethical interpretations stratified on its surface, giving unity or fixity\nto its inked signs.29And yet, whether we like it or not, Anne and\n27 See Homi K. Bhabha, The Location of Culture (New York: Routledge, 1994).\n28 Invoking a shared collective memory alone creates a problem. What are the\nexpanses and limits of the community of memory that clings to The Diary of Anne\nFrank? It almost seems as if the text questions the vastness and cohesiveness of\nthe community of memory that allows us to sympathize with one another at\ndistance: studying the transnational journey of this work, then, might tell us\nsomething, maybe a lot, about the memorial density of human associations.\n29 I believe that the Diary is a special text that could very well take its place among\nthe hard cultural forms theorized by Appadurai, which is to say, cultural\nmanifestations that are difficult to separate and transform, and that are disturbing\nwhen they are exported and altered. See Arjun Appadurai, Modernity at Large.\nCultural Dimensions of Globalization (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota\nPress, 1996). 177\nher father were the first to prepare for the global reception of the\ndiary. They were the first editors to neutralize the specific meaning\nof the Shoah, to transform it into an empty shell: a generic story of\ngeneric victims, generic perpetrators, generic young girls. 178\nBlack-American-German Children of Black-American GIs and\nGerman Women\nWendy Adele-Marie\nA rarely discussed topic is what happened to the children\nfathered by Black-American soldiers and German white women in\nthe aftermath of the Second World War. Children of mixed racial\nbackgrounds were referred to in a racist way, using the\nterm Mischlingskinder (mixed race children), a word earlier used\nby the Nazis to define children of Jewish ancestry. For the\npurposes of this chapter, the focus will be on the Second World\nWar, Black-American GIs, German women, and the Black-\nAmerican response to help these children.\nThe children were referred to as \u201cBrown Babies\u201d by post-\nwar American and German media, some of whom used pejoratives\nto reference these children. They were not always entirely\nwelcomed by either Germany or the United States. However,\nBlack-Americans did fight hard to promote the adoption of these\nchildren; later, West German individuals, families, and groups\nsought to keep the children in the country and to integrate them 179\nfully into a post-Nazi German society. The attitude towards\nchildren of mixed European white and Black ancestry was present.\nNotably after the First World War, children of Black and German\nancestry were called Mischlingskinder before the Nazi party was\neven developed.\nThe children numbered in the several hundred and were\noften abandoned, mistreated, and forgotten (Fehrenbach, 2005, pp.\n75-77). In the 1925 release of Mein Kampf, Adolf Hitler said Jews\nwere to blame for people of African descent living in Germany and\nother areas of Europe. Hitler\u2019s idea that the Jews were polluting the\nAryan race fell under his and the party\u2019s racial ideologies that only\npure Nordic blood was life worth living, and people of color\nundermined the Nazi plan for a pure racial German state. Hence,\nAs Dane (2019) explained, blaming the Jews for people of African\ndescent residing within Germany became another antisemitic belief\nfalsely perpetrated by the Nazis. Black-Germans were ostracized,\nharmed, violated, and mistreated. Persecutions continued, and then\nunder the Nazis, abuses were legalized. 180\nStarting on 14 July 1933, with the passage of the Law for\nthe Prevention of Offspring with Hereditary Diseases, Black-\nGermans in Nazi Germany could be forcibly sterilized. During the\nNazi regime, from 1933-1945, Black-Germans were arrested,\npersecuted, tortured, and killed. As Zane (2019) explained,\nchildren of mixed racial ancestry did not fare well either; these\nchildren fell under the same category as asocials, Roma, Jews, and\nothers once the 1935 Nuremberg Laws were passed. Black children\nand adults were then banned from schools. The United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum (2022) explained that even before\nthe Nuremberg Laws, once the Nazis came to power, interracial\ncouples were attacked, harassed, and abused.\nAfter the end of the Second World War, the fate of Black-\nAmerican-German children was fraught with danger, displacement,\nand abandonment. Abebola (2014) explained how relationships\nbetween German white women and Black-American GIs that\nresulted in children sometimes resulted in the babies being left in\norphanages. Citing the film Brown Babies: The Mischlingskinder\nStory, Abedola (2014) related that 181\nmany of the children ended up being adopted or sent to\norphanages because their German mothers feared the public\nscrutiny that came with having a mixed-race child out of\nwedlock. Some of the Black soldiers who wanted to marry\ntheir German girlfriends found it difficult because the\nrelationships were viewed as forbidden. Those who wanted\nto return home to the African-American girlfriends and\nsometimes wives didn't want to bring along children whose\npresence would indicate they had been unfaithful (Abedola,\n2014, para. 4).\nSo what happened to the children once their fate became publicly\nknown after the war? Abedola (2014) explained that people such as\nthe socialite Mabel Grammer worked as a journalist for the Afro\nAmerican. Grammer, who became a mother of twelve Black-\nAmerican German children, worked tirelessly to campaign for\nBlack-Americans to adopt the abandoned children. Some German\nfamilies took in the children as well, as Fehrenbach (2005)\nrevealed; Fehrenbach also related that sometimes German adopters\nwere pressured by Black-American agencies and individuals to 182\ngive up their children so that they could become American citizens\ninstead and cited the case of the Li\u00dfner family, who refused to give\nup their baby Doni when asked to do so. Not all German families\nwould take in and keep children; the need was great for adopters.\nBlack-Americans such as Walter White of the NAACP and\ncountless others worked tirelessly to support interracial adoptions.\nWhite was horrified that West Germany was said to have\ndeveloped a plan to put Black-American German children in\nholding centers, stating that \u201cis Germany to be allowed to\nsubstitute her concentration camps and persecution of the Jews for\nchildren who happened to be brown in color? Heaven help us!\u201d\n(Fehrenbach, 2005, p. 133). White and others worked to bring\npress and other attention to the Black-American community to\npromote these adoptions, and some white Americans rose to the\ncall to help the children, such as author Pearl Buck, who adopted\nseveral bi-racial children, Fehrenbach (2005) explained, including\nchildren from Germany, India, and Japan, all of whom had\nAmerican ancestry. 183\nMargaret Ethel Butler of Chicago saw a picture of\norphaned Black-American-German children and adopted two\nchildren. However, \u201cunlike Pearl Buck, who sought to demonstrate\nthe irrelevance of skin color in forming affective relationships,\nMargaret Ethel Butler and other prospective African American\nparents tended to be motivated by notions of racial identity and\nresponsibility\u201d (Fehrenbach, 2005, p. 133). Fehrenbach (2005)\nexplained that Black newspapers and magazines,\nincluding Ebony, pleaded with their readers to send money and\nsupplies to the orphans, Black-American German children, and\ntheir mothers who would not relinquish custody. Because of racism\nin the United States, and the lack of support from American\nofficials in Germany, people like Butler, Fehrenbach (2005) noted,\nfaced obstacles, prejudice, and even hate mail for adopting Black-\nAmerican-German children, unlike most German media, which\nwidely praised people like Butler for her desire to help and to\nadopt the unwanted children. Considering this, how many children\nwere unwanted, and how many were adopted by American\nfamilies? 184\nFehrenbach (2005) related that around 10% of Black-\nAmerican-German babies and children were in West German\norphanages and that less than 13% of German mothers would give\nup their children (note that in these studies, East German statistics\nwere not typically provided; Germany had been divided into two\ncountries in 1949). By 1968, \u201cexperts estimated that in the two\ndecades since the war as many as seven thousand Black-German\nchildren had been adopted by American citizens. Virtually all the\nprospective parents were black\u201d (Fehrenbach, 2005, p. 133). Some\nBlack activists like Lester Granger wondered whether the children\nwould be better left in Germany than come to the United States,\narguing that \u201cthese [are] colored children in this country, in\nGeorgia for example, who probably were much worse off than the\ncolored children in Germany\u201d (Fehrenbach, 2005, p. 146). When\nspeaking of whether or not the children would be best left in\nGermany, Granger, and White were considering the issue of Jim\nCrow and segregation, Fehrenbach (2005) elucidated, in contrast to\nthe former Nazi Germany, where schools were moving to full\nintegration, regardless of race. 185\nFehrenbach (2005) explored how West German periodicals\nwrote on American race relations and the Civil Rights movement,\nwith many journalists arguing that Black-American-German\nchildren were better off in West Germany than in the United\nStates, where children faced violence and murder, for example,\nnoting the 1957 events in Little Rock, and then in the 1963\nBirmingham school bombing where four Black girls were killed\nand others severely injured. Further, when speaking of the\nchildren, Nuremberg youth worker Dr. Dorothea Struwe argued\nthat by keeping Black-American-German children in West\nGermany, not only were the children safer, that the children \u201ccan\nhelp us make good some of the guild we have laden upon us in the\npast. We can do so by approaching these children with tolerance\nand free of prejudice and by giving them full possibilities for their\ndevelopment\u201d (Fehrenbach 2014, p. 168). Therefore, following this\nargument, we then see how a post-war West Germany argued that\nthey were more tolerant than their American counterparts by\ngiving Black-American-German children equal access to education\nand societal parity, noting that 186\nin just over a decade, since Hitler\u2019s defeat, a chastened\nnation [West Germany] appeared to have surpassed its tutor\n[the United States] in the lessons of democracy and was\ncredentialed to that effect by the favorable reviews of\nAfrican-American organizations and the press. By the turn\nof the 1960s, West German officials could point to their\ntreatment of the Mischlingskinder and claim a moral\nvictory in the area of race relations. (Fehrenbach 2014, p.\n168).\nDespite this assertion, many mixed-race children in West Germany\nfaced hardship, cruelty, and disdain; many faced the same\nprejudices coming of age in the United States as Black America\nfought for Civil Rights.\nReferences\nAbebola, M.

Here, we examine LGBTQ in the context of\nParagraph 175, LGBTQ and resistance, transactional female\nleadership from a wife of a top-ranking Nazi official, female\nperpetrators, how gender was constructed in Nazi Germany, and\nmuch more. Starting with perhaps the most well-known woman of\nthe Third Reich after Eva Braun is Magda Goebbels, and here,\nAdele-Marie asserts how Magda positioned herself to attain the\ntitle of \u201cfirst lady of the Reich.\u201d\nThe First Lady of the Reich:\nMagda Goebbels and Leadership in Nazi Germany\nWendy Adele-Marie\nJohanna Maria Magdalena \u201cMagda\u201d Goebbels (1901-1945)\nheld power and prestige as a wife, mother, and woman. She served\nas a leader for women in Nazi Germany (1933-1945) because of\nher beauty, fecundity, and close, intimate relationship with Adolf\nHitler. Magda Goebbels was married twice; Meissner (1980) noted\nher first husband, G\u00fcnther Quandt, the multi-millionaire founder of 190\ndozens of companies, including BMW, with whom she had one\nchild, a son, Harald, elevated her status socially in German circles.\nRichter (2018) said that marriage to Quandt gave her financial\nsecurity. However, her second marriage to Joseph Goebbels,\nthe Reichsminister f\u00fcr Propaganda [Reich Minister for\nPropaganda], helped establish her as a leader to German women.\nAccording to Adele-Marie (2010), with Joseph, Magda had six\nmore children in rapid succession. However, the marriage strained\ncontinuously due to Joseph\u2019s constant cheating and belittling\nMagda, sometimes publicly, by criticizing how she looked or\nflirting with other women in her presence.\nAdele-Marie (2010) further related that when the couple\ndiscussed divorce with Hitler personally, Hitler forbade it as the\nimage of the Reich\u2019s first family collapsing would not go over well\nwith the German people. As observed by Spielvogel (2010), Hitler\nimplied that if Joseph Goebbels, a serial philander, went through\nwith the divorce, demotion would be first, with other punishments\nto come; Joseph Goebbels backed down, and the couple stayed\nmarried. 191\nSpielvogel (2010) also noted that Joseph Goebbels was\nkeenly jealous of Magda\u2019s closeness to Hitler. Rupp (1977)\nperceived that Hitler admired Magda so much he unofficially gave\nher the task of opening some of his mail or even acting for him at\npublic functions with a mostly female audience, posing for pictures\ntogether. For Magda, her marriage to Joseph Goebbels elevated her\nsocial status, \u201cwhich in turn positioned them to maintain post-war\nromantic myths of the Third Reich as a new world order based on\nracial supremacy via domesticity and fertility\u201d (Adele-Marie,\n2020, p. 726). A fresh look at how Magda constructed her image\nand how she positioned herself alongside Hitler will demonstrate\nthat she held an unofficial leadership role in the Third Reich.\nMagda Goebbels\nWilliams (2018) stated that Magda was born in 1901 to\nAuguste Behrend, an unwed mother who married Oskar Ritschel.\nWilliams noted that Magda\u2019s birth certificate for the father\u2019s name\nremained blank, even after the marriage to Oskar. Auguste and\nOskar divorced, and after moving to Belgium, Auguste married a\nJewish man, Richard Friedlander, who adopted Magda, gave her 192\nhis last name, and with whom Magda grew close. Meissner (1980)\nwrote of Magda\u2019s mother, Auguste, deciding to send Magda to a\nCatholic school but that Magda was interested in and observed\nmore of Friedlander\u2019s Jewish customs than Catholic ones. After the\nwar, Meissner revealed, Magda\u2019s parents divorced, and Auguste\ntook her daughter back to Berlin. While there is no proof, The\nJewish Chronicle (2016) suggested that Magda did not stay in\ntouch with Friedlander once after the divorce.\nInterestingly, The Jewish Chronicle related that historian\nOliver Hilmes uncovered new research that Magda, who had a\nJewish boyfriend, lied about her background, and denounced the\nFriedlander name, using Ritschel instead. The Jewish\nChronicle (2016) argued that Hilmes proved that Friedlander was\nmurdered in the concentration camp Buchenwald in 1939. Richter\n(2018) suggested that Magda\u2019s relationship with her first husband,\nthe industrialist G\u00fcnther Quandt, who was antisemitic, convinced\nMagda to change her name from Friedlander back to Ritschel and\njoin the Nazi party, where she later met Joseph Goebbels. Quandt 193\nand Magda divorced, and he was quite generous with the divorce\nsettlement, leading to her financial independence.\nPseudo-Transformational Leader\nAfter Magda\u2019s first divorce, since there was enough money\nto live comfortably, she entertained the idea of \u201cgoing to university\nto become a lawyer or a designer\u201d (Vitkine, 2017). Magda\u2019s\nmother, Auguste, said that \u201cMagda was bored\u201d but soon would\nfind her cause, which ended up being Nazisim (Vitkine, 2017). In\nthe summer of 1930, due to her ex-husband Quandt\u2019s\nencouragement, Magda attended a meeting of the Nazi party, was\nimpressed, and joined. Still, it was when Magda, \u201cwho had\npreviously not been interested in politics, first heard Joseph\nGoebbels speak,\u201d that she became obsessed with the idea of herself\nas an ultimate Aryan feminine archetype leader (Schaake and\nB\u00e4urle, 2001, p. 180).\nWhen Magda and Joseph first met, Schaake and B\u00e4urle\n(2001) revealed that at first, she was not attracted to Joseph \u201con\naccount of his small stature, as he was a contradiction to the ideal\nof the big blond Teuton\u201d male (p.180). What probably enticed her 194\nto start a relationship with the eccentric propagandist Joseph was\nnot his intellect, even though he was well-spoken, with a Ph.D., the\nattraction was undoubtedly his direct connection to Hitler, whom\nshe deeply admired. For Joseph, Magda was the epitome of Aryan\nbeauty, and in turn, marriage to her because of her beauty, wealth,\nand elegance brought him a form of status. Marriage for the two,\nthen, was mutually beneficial. Once she met Goebbels, Meissner\n(1980) promoted the idea that it was Hitler who pushed for the\nmarriage between Magda and Goebbels. Hitler encouraged the\nwedding so that he could use his propaganda expert\u2019s wife as de-\nfacto first lady, staying single as to promote himself as every\nwoman\u2019s man: \u201cHitler saw himself as the father of the nation, and\nas a surrogate husband of sorts for the German women, their\nultimate and omnipresent protector\u201d (Adele-Marie, 2020, p. 728).\nConsequently, for her if Magda could not become a lawyer,\nshe could become a leader. By marrying Joseph Goebbels, one of\nthe most powerful men in Nazi Germany, the Reichsminister f\u00fcr\nPropaganda [Reich Minister for Propaganda], \u201cshe successfully\ncombined her public role as an important Aryan woman with 195\nmarriage and then motherhood\u201d (Adele-Marie, 2020, p. 727). Once\nthey married, the Goebbels became a power couple and enjoyed a\nclose relationship with Hitler. At least at first with Joseph, and then\nwith Hitler, for Magda, these relationships may have fulfilled all\nfive of Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of Maslow\u2019s, especially esteem and\nself-actualization, which psychologist Margarete Mitscherlich\nalluded to in the documentary Hitler\u2019s Women: Magda Goebbels\n(Hartl, 2001). Many German women adopted Magda for Hitler a\nnotion of a stand-in first lady of the Reich, including this author\u2019s\npaternal grandparents; their son was given the names of two top\nNazi figures (Adele-Marie, 2010, p. 35).\nSince Magda had many babies, she could publicly fill\ndifferent forms of pseudo-transformational leadership: elegance,\nfertility, motherhood, and above all, undying commitment to Hitler\nas his companion, and who she lovingly encouraged her children to\nrefer to Hitler as an uncle. In turn, Hitler was devoted to the\nchildren, as Meissner (1980) revealed, visiting them often, and\nposing for pictures, especially with the eldest daughter Helga (pp.\n95-105). The Goebbels children posed for film and photos with 196\ntheir parents and Hitler, which further enhanced their mother\u2019s\npseudo-transformational leadership role as the ultimate fertile\nAryan woman (Meissner, 1980, pp. 95-105).\nNazi Views on Fertility\nThe Nazis continually emphasized fertility, especially when\nWorld War One and the global flu pandemic decimated the\nGerman population. Joseph Goebbels (1934) gave a speech to a\ngroup of women in Berlin. Joseph said that countries with low\nbirthrates declined and blamed modernity, stating that \u201ca\ncharacteristic of the modern era is a rapidly declining birthrate in\nour big cities\u201d (Goebbels, 1934, para. 11). In the same speech, he\nalso (1934) acknowledged that some women had to work and that\nworking women deserved recognition, but ultimately, as he said,\nfor the German woman that\nher most glorious duty is to give children to her people and\nnation, children who can continue the line of generations\nand who guarantee the immortality of the nation. The\nwoman is the teacher of the youth, and therefore the builder\nof the foundation of the future. If the family is the nation\u2019s 197\nsource of strength, the woman is its core and center. The\nbest place for the woman to serve her people is in her\nmarriage, in the family, in motherhood. This is her highest\nmission. (para. 8)\nAdele-Marie (2010) affirmed how the Nazis underscored this\ncharge and related that the Nazi view on women was that they had\n\u201cHitler saw himself as the father of the nation, and as a surrogate\nhusband of sorts for the German women, their ultimate and\nomnipresent protector. Women were to be wedded to the state by\ndevoting their bodies for reproductive purposes of Nazi Germany\u201d\n(p. 728). For some incredibly fertile women, they received\nthe Mutterkreuz, the Cross of Honour of the German mother, a\nmedal developed in honor of Hitler\u2019s mother that came in bronze,\nsilver, or gold, much like an Olympic medal: \u201cthese medals came\nin three versions, bronze (four children), silver (six children) and\ngold (eight children)\u201d with Magda \u2013 the recipient of the very first\nmedal - received a silver medal for having seven children, Harald\nwith her first husband G\u00fcnther Quandt and six more with Joseph\nGoebbels (Adele-Marie, 2010, p. 5). Therefore, Magda Goebbels, 198\nwho was pregnant through most of her second marriage, was the\nperfect archetype of a fertile, feminine leader, ready to serve the\nstate.\nFirst Lady of the Reich\nMagda\u2019s relationship with Hitler was deeply intimate and\nsupposedly caused Joseph Goebbels some concern. However,\nGuenther (2004) related that Goebbels was a serial adulterer whose\nbehavior embarrassed Magda and caused Hitler to admonish him.\nMagda \u201cseemed like the perfect candidate for First Lady of the\nReich. She was blonde, and had ice-cold blue eyes, which was\npractically the prerequisite for the Aryan ideal\u201d (Guenther, 2004, p.\n131). Furthermore, Guenther (2004) stated that Magda was\n\u201cfiercely loyal to Hitler. Magda also shared Hitler\u2019s fervent\nantisemitism, conveniently forgetting her past Jewish connections.\nWilliams (2018) noted that once she had joined the party, she\nworked to recruit more women and campaigned for the Nazis.\nMore importantly, she embodied the party\u2019s leading tenet about\nwomen \u2013 motherhood. 199\nGuenther (2004) also noted that Magda was simply a close\nfriend of Hitler who loved to spend time with her and their\nchildren, who adored Hitler (pp. 131-133). As Williams (2018)\nalleged, Joseph Goebbels wanted his family to be the nation\u2019s\n\u201cfirst family\u201d and his wife as Hitler\u2019s non-sexual companion. As\nlong as his self-serving interests were never subverted or\nthreatened by other party members who jumped at the chance to\npromote their wives, Goebbels was only too happy to leave Magda\nwith Hitler, knowing how much her presence pleased the F\u00fchrer.\nHowever, even though Magda was intelligent, ambitious, elegant,\nand close to Hitler, Magda was ambitious, outspoken, wore\nmakeup, smoked in public. She had also been the target of ongoing\ngossip that she was a \u201cJew-lover\u201d who had a \u201ctorrid love affair\u201d\nwith a \u201cfervent Zionist, Chaim Vitalty Arlosoroff\u201d (Guenther,\n2004, p. 132). Proven, even Magda would not have been safe.\nA relationship with a Jew like Arlosoroff was unlawful:\n\u201cWe must always attempt to persuade each German-blooded\nwoman who is considering a relationship with a foreigner that her\nbehavior is improper, inconsistent with the racial expectations of 200\nsociety. It must be clear that such behavior is a crime\u201d\n(Nachrichtendienst der Reichsfrauenf\u00fchrung Sonderdienst, 1941,\npara. 17). Magda, who had a \u201clove of fashionable and expensive\nclothes,\u201d always promoting herself as \u201cbest-dressed women in\nGermany that collided with images of home-spun, homemade\ndirndls\u201d (Guenther, 2004, p. 133). Nonetheless, Magda had severe\ncompetition for the first lady\u2019s title. It was not a woman who, like\nthe outlandish Emmy, wore tiaras to the opera and had ballgowns\nmade from confiscated curtains from Polish castles (Guenther,\n2004, p. 133). Consequently, one woman came close to\nsupplanting Magda in the public\u2019s opinion as Germany\u2019s number-\none mother, Gertrud Scholtz-Klink.\nGertrud Scholtz-Klink\nGuenther (2004) advanced the idea that the Nazi party\ninstead preferred Gertrud Scholtz-Klink as the Reich\u2019s first\nmother. Guenther (2004) said this was especially true of Scholtz-\nKlink, who liked to wear her hair in tight braids and traditional\ncostume; thus, she \u201cembodied female perfection as constructed by\nNazi ideologies \u2013 a Nordic priestess preaching the cult of 201\nwomanhood.\u201d Scholtz-Klink, whose image was on hundreds of\npropaganda posters, was a widow who remarried a General, had\nseveral children, and not politically connected. She was, however,\na fanatical Nazi who embraced everything the party stood for,\nincluding the image of a German woman as peasant-like; this\nperhaps led to Magda referring to Scholtz-Klink as a \u201ccow\u201d and\n\u201cinsolent and impertinent\u201d (Guenther, 2004, p. 138). Adele-Marie\n(2020) said that\nGertrud Scholtz-Klink, a widow and mother of four\nchildren, was the head of the Nazi Women\u2019s League (NS-\nFrauenschaft). The League recruited thousands of women\nto help construct a Nazi woman\u2019s proper imaging in\nthe Volksgemeinschaft [national community]. This woman\nwas subservient to men, understood her role in the private\nsphere, and emphasized profound fertility. (p. 738)\nDespite many female candidates jockeying for a position at\nHitler\u2019s side, he preferred to remain single with elegant ladies\npublicly accompanying him. If Hitler did not have a current love\ninterest, he often asked the Goebbels to accompany him, whether 202\nto a theater opening or a speech. Although Hitler had proclaimed\nother women as his first lady, such as Hermann G\u00f6ring\u2019s second\nwife Emmy, she fell out of favor due to her ostentatious displays of\nwealth during wartime rationing (Guenther, 2004, p. 134).\nTherefore, it was Magda continually constructed as Hitler\u2019s\nacceptable first lady. Notably, Guenther (2004) illustrated that\nHitler loved to be surrounded by elegant women, and the more, the\nbetter, and especially by a woman like Magda who never tired of\nhim. She accompanied him everywhere to the opera or dinners,\nalways paying rapt attention to his diatribes, referring to Hitler as\ngodlike; in reverence, she said he was \u201cnot human, unreachable,\nuntouchable,\u201d which was wholly unrealistic (Spielvogel, 2010, p.\n124).\nOutcomes\nThe significance of studying leadership roles in times of\nwar contributes to scholarship that has largely ignored women\u2019s\nleadership roles in wartime in previous decades. Recently, scholars\nsuch as Daniel Patrick Brown, Irene Guenther, and Rochelle Saidel\nbegan to change that shift in scholarship to address the gap in 203\nexamining women\u2019s roles during the Third Reich. Hitler\u2019s inner\ncircle, and those he enjoyed surrounding himself with, were mainly\nwomen. Rupp (1977) revealed Hitler\u2019s intimate associates were\nmostly women. Rupp (1977) asserted that this circle consisted of a\nfemale chef, secretaries, and women like Winifred Wagner,\ndaughter-in-law of famed composer and Hitler\u2019s favorite cultural\nicon Richard Wagner, to Hannah Reitsch, a test pilot who was the\nonly woman decorated by the Luftwaffe [German Airforce]. In\nvain, the latter tried to help Hitler escape from his Berlin bunker as\nthe Soviets were closing in in April 1945. Other women played\ncritical roles in Nazi Germany. Baroness Karin von Kantzow,\nHermann G\u00f6ring\u2019s first wife, Adele-Marie (2020), revealed played\na role in helping Hitler secure a publishing deal for Mein Kampf\n[My Struggle].\nSummary\nMagda Goebbels served as a leader to millions of German\nwomen who wanted to emulate her beauty, style, and image. Her\nbeauty, public professionalism, leadership abilities represented\nthrough public appearances constructed her as the Reich\u2019s ultimate 204\nfirst lady. Adele-Marie (2010) noted that for Magda, this was a\nleadership position that even Hitler\u2019s long-suffering girlfriend, Eva\nBraun, whom he considered provincial and often mocked to her\nface, could not have held. Eva\u2019s primary achievement was staying\nloyal to Hitler even as he hid her away, never publicly\nacknowledging his relationship with her. Guenther (2004)\nobserved that Hitler also allegedly mentally and emotionally\nabused Eva, making fun of her, which may have led to two suicide\nattempts. Hitler preferred to remain publicly single since \u201cHitler\nsaw himself as the father of the nation, and as a surrogate husband\nof sorts for the German women, their ultimate and omnipresent\nprotector\u201d (Adele-Marie, 2020, pp. 727-728). Therefore, Hitler\nbecame every woman\u2019s man; whether she needed a father,\nhusband, or patriarchal support figure, he would be that for\nGerman women.\nWith married women as his social companions to the\nfemale public, Adele-Marie (2020) argued, Hitler seemed available\nto all women, as he \u201crelied on the devotion and support of women\neven though he banished them to the periphery of political life\u201d (p. 205\n731). Compared to the Nazi agrarian female typification, Magda\nwas overly stylish. To Hitler, Magda was the ultimate companion\nwho adored him but was ultimately unattainable and not a threat to\nthe female public; this was due to her marriage to Joseph\nGoebbels, a factor which may have been why Hitler refused to\nallow the couple to divorce.\nAlthough Magda had carefully crafted her image, Meissner\n(1980) stated that she was a depressed woman in constant pain due\nto neurological nerve disease. She was obsessively devoted to\nHitler, married to a serial adulterer, and chose to kill herself and\nher six children with Goebbels at the end of the war rather than\nlive in a world without Nazism. According to Vitkine (2017),\nMagda revealed that in her suicide note to her eldest son, Harald\nQuandt, how honored she was that on the day Hitler died, Hitler\ngave her his personal Nazi party pin. Magda related that Hitler had\ntold her how proud he was that she had always stood by\nhim. Magda also wrote to her eldest son that she was going to kill\nhis six half-siblings: 206\nThe world that comes after the F\u00fchrer and national\nsocialism is not any longer worth living in, and therefore, I\ntook the children with me, for they are too good for the life\nthat would follow, and a merciful God will understand me\nwhen I will give them the salvation.\u201d (Adele-Marie, 2020,\np. 725)\nMagda\u2019s suicide note suggested how she saw herself at the start of\nthe regime as a transformational leader that would transform\nGerman women. Then, in the end, in her twisted logic, she set\nanother example as a woman ready to sacrifice herself and her\nchildren for the one man who sacrificed himself for Germany.\nFor the brief thirteen years of the Third Reich, Magda\nserved as an ultimate maternal pseudo-transformational leader for\nwomen. While Magda held no official title, Adele-Marie (2020)\nsaid that Magda\u2019s leadership role was one that she underscored in\n\u201can interview with the Vossische Zeitung, a German newspaper\u201d\n(Adele-Marie, 2020, p. 733). Magda, referred to as the \u201cFirst Lady\nof the Reich,\u201d strongly asserted that 207\nwhen the German woman is confronted with the choice\nbetween marriage and career, she will always be\nencouraged to choose marriage since that is undoubtedly\nbest for a woman. I am attempting to make the German\nwoman more beautiful. (Adele-Marie, 2020, p. 733)\nMagda believed it was her moral duty to make German\nwomen the most elegant women globally, and her devotion to\nHitler indicates, perhaps, a frustrated woman. Magda never\nbecame a lawyer or a designer, had two unhappy marriages, and\nwas ultimately unable to hold political power herself. She could\nnot have done so in a hypermasculine regime that excluded most\nwomen from political service, as even though women could\nbecome Nazi party members, \u201cwomen were categorically denied\nany position of power within the party\u201d (Adele-Marie, 2020, p.\n25). Ultimately, as a beautiful maternal role model, Magda failed,\nas she was a monstrous murderer that directly participated in the\nmurder of her six youngest children before she killed herself.\nTherefore, this essay, which supported analysis, research,\nand affirmed specialized content knowledge, deconstructed 208\nMagda\u2019s image. Outlining her role as a pseudo-transformational\nleader in the Third Reich offers critical intervention towards\nstudies that privilege Nazi women\u2019s status, moral and political\nrighteousness.\nReferences\nAdele-Marie, W.

The Palgrave Handbook of Holocaust Literature and\nCulture. New York: Palgrave, 2020. Citations are left intact from\nthe original work.\nThe cultural production of World War II memory and\nmemorialization has focused primarily on the conflict between\nAllies and Axis powers, or the Nazi perpetrated\nHolocaust. Consistent with the neglected narratives of women in\nother polities who wielded power \u201cbehind the scenes,\u201d women\ninvolved in the Nazi party and their self-representations offer a\nmore comprehensive history of women\u2019s critical influences. My\nanalysis will consider how marriage to the primary architects of the\nFinal Solution elevated the social status of most women, which in\nturn positioned them to maintain romantic myths of the Third\nReich as a new world order based on racial supremacy. 212\nTheoretically, this paper will offer critical intervention in\nstudies that privilege women\u2019s moral and political righteousness\nand resistance to oppression. Three primary foci will emerge:\ncontemporary identity in the \u201cquest for Nazi female perfection\u201d to\nstand as \u201cthe First Lady of the Reich; imaging of wives and their\nhusbands post-war, and some filmic constructions of \u201cNazi\nwomen\u201d from the past five decades.30\nMy study of Magda Goebbels, Lina Heydrich, and\nVeronika (Vera) Eichmann, wives of powerful Nazi officials,\nprovides key examples of women's influential roles within Adolf\nHitler's innermost circle as well as their influence on Nazi ideology\nand practice. Although Nazi ideology and policy pressured women\nto activate the new romantic domesticity that was sweeping\nGermany, a study of these women's self-representations\n30 Irene Guenther, Nazi Chic: Fashioning Women in the Third Reich\n(Oxford: Berg, 2004), p. 138. Guenther further explained that \u201cClearly, grabbing\na top spot in German society as the wife of a Nazi official did not always\ntranslate into a step-up in style or refinement. But then, the National Socialists\nwere not always known for their sophisticated taste. In an effort to broaden the\nappeal of the Party symbol, the swastika surfaced as a decorative motif on\nvirtually every consumer product available \u2013 on dog collars, bed sheets,\nmatchbooks, and the water glasses of Nazi dignitaries. It even appeared as head\nornament in the form of a woman\u2019s hat, on fruit drop candies, and embroidered\nonto sexy silk camisoles.\u201d Ibid., 136. 213\ndemonstrates that Nazi women were instrumental in designing and\nexecuting their state-constructed subservient role. My analysis will\nthen argue that their influence extended to constructing a memory\nthat shaped their husbands as innocent bystanders and their images\nas exemplary German patriots in the postwar period. Critical\nexamination of these women's self-representations shows that Nazi\nwives knew much more about their husbands' roles than they\nwould admit. Focusing on their disavowal of their own and their\nspouse's culpability reveals significant new insights into a different\nkind of resistance: against the exposure of Nazi atrocities and\nattempts to de-Nazify the nation.\nA key example of how this resistance to de-Nazification\nprevailed decades later is a 1979 interview in which Lina Heydrich\nasserted that her husband Reinhard, SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer,\nGeneral der Polizei as well as chief of the Reich Main Security\nOffice, \u201chad nothing to do with [the Final Solution].\u201d31 Lina was\n31 \u201cWidow of Heydrich Says \u2018Holocaust\u2019 Ignores Facts\u201d The New York\nTimes. February 7, 1979, p. 2. Lina also wrote to many periodicals \u201ccorrecting\u201d\nthem for what she alleged were falsehoods against Reinhard Heydrich\u2019s\nmemory. 214\nblonde, curvy, and maternal, and saw herself as an ideal\nrepresentative of the Nazi government, (yet she sought little public\nattention until much after the war had ended and then only in the\ncontext of \u201crighting the wrongs\u201d against what she considered false\nattacks on her husband\u2019s memory), as it was believed that she was\nthe one who had encouraged Heydrich to apply to the SS for\nemployment.\nAfter Heydrich rose in power, later Lina was not afraid to\nstate her opinion about her contemporaries, and was said to have\nbelittled even Margarete Himmler, the wife of Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS\nHeinrich Himmler \u2013 her husband\u2019s superior officer - calling her\n\u201cbourgeous, humourless, and stingy\u201d with \u201cfacial twitches.\u201d32 This\ndemonstrates that women competed amongst themselves as to who\nlooked the part of the ideal Aryan woman; status and marriage did\nnot stop women from engaging critical commentary of one\nanother. This criticisms of each other shows that women like Lina\nsought an informal agency of status within the regime as the\nultimate model of Aryan femininity. After her husband\u2019s death in\n32 Guenther, p. 136. 215\n1942, she continued to memorialize him until her death. In 1976,\nshe wrote a book Leben mit einem Kriegsverbrecher (Life with a\nwar criminal; later reissued as My Life with Reinhard). Because\nHeydrich died a general, after the war she successfully petitioned\nthe West German government for a pension, which she received.33\nIn 1979, Lina, at the time of the interview, was photographed with\na brass funeral mask of her husband over her head. She was also\nfilmed lovingly polishing it, denying the entire time that her first\nhusband had any culpability for the Holocaust, instead, she argued,\nhe was a wonderful husband who got caught up in Nazi politics.\nAlong with other Nazi wives, Lina Heydrich remained\ncommitted to the myth of Nazi triumphalism. Lina constructed\nherself as an innocent widow, a mother of four children, whose\nfather was not in any way responsible for the crimes of the Third\nReich.34 This insistent denial offers an opportunity to combine\n33 Note Robert Gerwarth\u2019s Hitler\u2019s Hangman: The Life of Heydrich\n(New Haven, CT: Yale University Press), 2011, passim.\n34 The Heydrich\u2019s daughter, Silke, also sought a post-war\nmemorialization of her father. In a December 28, 1971 interview, Silke, a\nmodel, argued that \u201cwas my father an evil man? If he really was, I should be\nable to feel this within myself. I have watched myself for a long time and didn\u2019t\nfeel anything of the sort.\u201d See Joachim Moskau, \u201cNazi Children Reflect on\nDad.\u201d Boca Raton News, December 28, 1971. 216\nhistorical and rhetorical analysis of the construction of a counter\nWorld War II memory by women whose gender identities and\nroles advance research on the war and its aftermath. The great\nirony is that millions of women (it has been estimated that some\nthirteen million women were active in Nazi party groups from\n1933-1945) supported to the end a regime that at heart had an\nabiding contempt for the female gender.\nNational Socialists sought to return women to subordinate\npositions in German society, which meant from the 1933 onset of\npower that women were to disregard any prior economic, political,\nor societal quest for emancipation. Women were to return to their\ndomestic spheres, and, preferably, proudly have babies for the\nFatherland (Hitler had emphasized this in a 1935 speech where he\nargued women could fight for her country via her fertility), with\nfertilization used as a racial weapon, a fertility armament overseen\nby women (although answerable to men, and, ultimately, Hitler\nhimself).\nUsing women, National Socialism wanted to eliminate,\n\u201cwithin a hundred years, the dark German type by mating them with 217\nblonde women\u201d in order to create a super race of \u2018racially\u2019 pure,\nblonde haired, blue eyed people.35 To succeed in this goal, which\nthe Nazis believed was necessary so that pure Germanic blood\nwould survive, the regime established a hundred-year plan,\nconceived in part by Heinrich Himmler, Hitler\u2019s Reichsf\u00fchrer, SS.\nHimmler established \u201cLebensborn [Spring of Life], an SS maternity\norganization whose main function was to adopt racially suitable\nchildren for childless SS families and to assist racially sound unwed\nmothers and their children.\u201d36 Children who matched racial Aryan\ntenets, with the hopes of creating the blonde super race, were stolen\nand given to SS families to raise; over 12,000 children were\nkidnapped and given to SS families. 37 Lebensborn was also\ndescribed as \u201cstud farms where SS men and suitable young women\n35 John Toland, Adolf Hitler (New York: Doubleday & Co., Inc.,\n1976), p. 764.\n36 Ibid.\n37 Andrew Malone. \u201cStolen by the Nazis: The tragic tale of 12,000\nblue-eyed blond children taken by the SS to create an Aryan super-race.\u201d The\nDaily Mail Online. www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1111170/Stolen-Nazis-\nThe-tragic-tale-12-000-blue-eyed-blond-children-taken-SS-create-Aryan-super-\nrace.html (23 April 2010). 218\nwere mated to breed a master race.\u201d 38 A government that\nencouraged fertility in such a way, and used women to achieve racial\ngoals certainly did not view women in an egalitarian fashion, nor\nwere full civil and political rights for them promoted.

Although women could\nnot join the elite sectors of the Nazi party, they could marry a Nazi\nofficial to gain authority.\nWomen such as Magda Goebbels, wife of propaganda\nminister Joseph Goebbels, especially personified the ideal Aryan\nGerman wife and also the mother. She and Goebbels had six\nchildren, and a very troubled marriage. Perhaps in way to escape\nher misery, Magda constructed a role for herself as the leading lady\nof Nazi Germany. In an interview with the Vossische Zeitung, a\nGerman newspaper, Magda, referred to as the \u201cFirst Lady of the\nReich,\u201d strongly asserted that \u201cwhen the German woman is\n40 Enemies that were non-Jews were defined as, but not limited to:\nCommunists, the disabled, mentally ill, political dissenters, Roma, and people\nbelonging to various religious sects such as the Seventh Day Adventists. 220\nconfronted with the choice between marriage and career then she\nalways will be encouraged to choose marriage since that is\nundoubtedly best for a woman.

Following in her\nexample and within the framework of this new role, women were\nto be the perfect wife and also, with the Nazi hyper-emphasis on\nfertility, have as many babies as possible to ensure the continuation\nof the German Volk (nation, people).

As we\nhave seen, current law does not prohibit the marriage of a German girl to a\nracially-unrelated foreigner. A marriage with a racially-related foreigner means\nthe girl is lost to German ethnicity. In both cases, the marriage is more\ndangerous and less desirable that the marriage of a German man to a foreigner.\nEducating German women about this is urgently necessary. As a last resort, of\ncourse, there is the possibility of legal measures to combat racial threats to the\nGerman people. It is much better, however, to avoid letting it come to that, but\nrather lead each German girl to be aware of and proud of her German ethnicity.\u201d\nSee: Nachrichtendienst der Reichsfrauenf\u00fchrung Sonderdienst, v. 10, # 16\n(September 1941). https://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/rff-\nsonderdienst.htm (11 January 2018).\n43 Donald D.

Also, The National Socialist Women's Yearbook of\n1934 \u201creveals women without makeup, without jewelry, and with large hips\nwere considered the ideal Aryan woman in Nazi Germany. The Chairwoman of\nthe Association for German Women's Culture, Agnes Gerlach claimed the ideal\nwoman had become the \u201cbig Germanic type of woman\u201d instead of the France's\n\u201csmall, romantic type.\u201d Gerlach\u2019s article stated it was un-German to use\nproducts to change hair color or to change one's looks with cosmetics. The\nimage of the thin French woman was emotionally damaging to German women\nin Gerlach's opinion. Similarly, the Jewish influence was thought to include too\nmuch focus on accessorizing and overly made-up women. According to Nazi\npropaganda, Jewish and French woman were not strong or able to bear as many\nchildren because they were petite. The German woman was superior and did not\nneed to use these enhancing products to be beautiful. Nazis associated gaudiness\nwith Jewish women and easy women because of tradition. Dressing plainly\nwithout make up or jewelry had been popular since the earliest Europeans.\nThere were even periods where Europeans believed wearing make-up was\nimmoral. Anglo-Saxons may have never worn make up; there is no evidence of\nthem wearing make-up. Eventually cosmetics, dying hair, and wearing gaudy\njewelry became associated with easy women. Nazis often stated the Western\ncultures had created an ugly and unnatural beauty. Women in Germany were\nbeautiful naturally and did not need to look like the Western and Jewish's flawed\nidea of beauty. Nazis promoted women who were larger and who could bear\nchildren easier because this is the role the woman played in the Nazi culture.\nAgnes article demonstrates the opinions of the Nazis. The ideal German woman\ndid not need to blend in with other women of the world. They were supposed to\nbe the superior race; therefore, their women did not need doctoring to be\nbeautiful and perfect.\u201d See Agnes Gerlach, The National Socialist Women's\nYearbook of 1934 (Germany: National Socialist Women's Organization, 1934),\n1, found at https://alphahistory.com/nazigermany/women-in-nazi-germany/ (15\nDecember 2018). 223\nher six youngest children.

Post-war, the quest for what the ultimate Aryan woman\nshould be constructed continues in a disturbing content. Thus,\nlinking the images of high-status Nazi women to the \u201ceveryday\u201d\nwoman in Nazi Germany shows us that during the Third Reich,\nwomen competed as to who best represented the \u201crefashion of its\nfemale citizenry,\u201d and entered an unspoken contest of sorts to\nembody what the ideal German woman was thought to look like.\n50 Guenther, p. 131. 227\nThe Nazi Persecution of the LGBTQ communities\nWendy Adele-Marie\nPersecution of all peoples not designated as Aryan and not\nfitting a specific legal and racial construct began before the Nazis\ncame to power and escalated once Hitler was installed as\nChancellor in January 1933. Gay men and others from the LGBTQ\ncommunity were primarily targeted by the Nazis, with gay men the\nsecond highest targeted group of prisoners after the Jews. The\nNazis viewed men as a more significant threat than women,\narguing that women played a minor role in society. Further, in the\nNazi view, even if a woman was a lesbian, as Gerdes (2015)\nrevealed, the Nazis felt that the fertility of the lesbian community\ncould be controlled by brutal force and sexual assaults, as\nmandated by the fierce belief in the Aryan reproductive construct.\nAs Gerdes (2015) suggests, in the Nazi framework of\ngender, the Nazis viewed men as more vital and necessary than\nwomen. Gay relations were already classified as a punishable\noffense; this was in Paragraph 175, which preceded the Nazis by\nseveral decades. Paragraph 175 \u201cwas the national German law that 228\nprohibited sex between men. It was incorporated into the German\npenal code in 1871,\u201d and this law allowed for the brutal\npersecution and incarceration of gay men that went on even before\nthe Nazis came to power and was not revoked until decades after\nthe Nazis were gone (Kaczorowski, 2015).\nHowever, even though Paragraph 175 was in place before\nthe Nazis came to power and were invoked during the Weimar\nRepublic (1919-1933), there were LGBTQ nightclubs and\ncabarets. Germany was also where the critical and influential\nMagnus Hirschfeld\u2019s \u201cInstitut f\u00fcr Sexualwissenschaft [the Institute\nfor Sexual Science], which contained thousands of books and\njournals on sexuality and gender,\u201d resided (Astrup Jensen, 2021).\nThe Nazis would burn the Institute down, denouncing Hirschfeld\nand all research conducted there.\nTherefore, there was a legal precedent in Paragraph 175\nthat was in place against gay men, and because in a hyper-\nmasculinized regime like Nazi Germany, where men held power,\ngay men represented a dual-threat against Nazi masculine identity: 229\nthey would not have sex with women and reproduce, which went\nagainst the Nazi heterosexual construct of the male agency.\nGay Men\nGay men were one of the primary targets of the Nazis. The\nLGBTQ community was overall considered asocial and immoral;\nanything related to gay identity, from clubs to organizations, was\ndestroyed by the Nazis. Gay men did not fit the Nazi ideal of racial\npurity or the Hitlerian goal of perpetuating the future \u201cmaster\u201d\nrace. Gay men were not viewed as beneficial for reproductive\npurposes, as were lesbians, and were, therefore, a threat to the Nazi\nview of manhood. However, one man blurred the lines of sexuality\nand represented the Nazi construct of masculinity.\nThat man was Ernst R\u00f6hm, a World War One veteran, a\nfriend of Hitler, and a leader of the Sturmabteilung (SA)\n[Stormtroopers, Brown Shirts], was gay and presented himself as a\nman who \u201cattached paramount importance to the values of\nmilitarized masculinity\u201d (Wills, 2019, para. 4). The Nazi construct\nof masculinity was the weapon against \u201cthe threatening \u201cwave\u201d of\nthe bourgeoisie, women, Jews, socialists, Bolsheviks, all of whom 230\nrepresented weakness, chaos, and disorder\u201d (Wills, 2019, para. 4).\nR\u00f6hm presented himself as the Nazi hypermasculinized ideal, and\nwith his relationship with Hitler seemingly assured, he felt\nconfident as the chief of staff of the Sturmabteilung (SA, the\nBrownshirts), even to the point where he opposed Paragraph 175.\nR\u00f6hm was Hitler\u2019s right-hand man as head of\nthe Sturmabteilung (SA, the Brownshirts), the Nazi\nparamilitary wing. Instrumental in the rise of the party via\nthe street-fighting and extra-judicial murders of the late\n1920s and early 1930s, R\u00f6hm\u2019s sexual orientation was no\nsecret after the mid-1920s. Hitler either ignored it or said it\nwas immaterial, depending on who he was talking to,\nincluding other Nazis. (Wills, 2019)\nHitler already knew that R\u00f6hm was gay. So why act against him?\nR\u00f6hm was seen as a threat to Hitler\u2019s authority.\nThere was an alleged conspiracy that R\u00f6hm had a desire to\nmerge the SA with the army; another threat came from R\u00f6hm\nhimself, who was supposed to have said that the SA was the only\nlegitimate body to fight the communists. Hitler moved against 231\nR\u00f6hm because he was a political threat; any threat against Hitler\nhad to be dealt with immediately. R\u00f6hm, who did not approve of\nsome of Hitler\u2019s policies, began to criticize other top Nazis and\nspread rumours openly.\nSimkin (2016) stated that R\u00f6hm alleged that Joseph\nGoebbels, the Reichsminister f\u00fcr Propaganda [Reich Minister for\nPropaganda] was interested in his wife Magda Goebbels\u2019s son\nfrom her first marriage in a sexual way. Goebbels hated R\u00f6hm and\nadvised Hitler that R\u00f6hm had to go. Hermann G\u00f6ring,\nReichsmarshall des Gro\u00dfdeutschen Reiches [Marshal of the\nEmpire] and the second most powerful Nazi after Hitler, and\nHeinrich Himmler, the Reichsf\u00fchrer of the Schutzstaffel [Protection\nSquadron, SS], were united against R\u00f6hm. Both were concerned\nthat the SA, who, Simkin (2016) noted, had a membership of over\nfour million men, whose allegiance was with R\u00f6hm.\nAs Simkin (2016) pointed out, G\u00f6ring and others made a\nlist of those in the regime, all of whom had to be eliminated.\nG\u00f6ring especially denounced R\u00f6hm and hated gay men; thus,\nR\u00f6hm was at the top of the list. Evidence against R\u00f6hm grew, 232\nespecially when R\u00f6hm said that \u201cAdolf is a swine... He only\nassociates with the reactionaries now. His old friends aren\u2019t good\nenough for him. Getting matey with the East Prussian generals.\nThey\u2019re his cronies now. Are we revolutionaries, or aren\u2019t we?\u201d\n(Simkin, 2016, para. 56). Therefore, for Hitler\u2019s political gains,\nR\u00f6hm had to go, and the only way to deal with this famous figure\nwas to discredit gay men and denounce R\u00f6hm\u2019s sexuality as\nimmoral, asocial and place gay men on the list of threats against\nthe Nazi world order.\nIn 1934, the president of Germany, Paul von Hindenburg,\nwas ill, and Hitler was convinced it was important that he be seen\nas von Hindenburg\u2019s rightful and only heir. Thus, when it was\nevident in the summer of 1934 that von Hindenburg had weeks to\nlive, Hitler and his intimates decided it was necessary to\nconsolidate power and secure Hitler\u2019s position.\nThe plan was to now use R\u00f6hm\u2019s sexuality against him in\nwhat Hitler referred to as a morality campaign against gay men.\nEvans (2005) revealed that on trumped-up charges of corruption,\nR\u00f6hm was arrested in the early hours of 30 June 1934, with Hitler 233\npresent at his arrest: \u201cHitler entered R\u00f6hm's bedroom alone with a\nwhip in his hand. Behind him were two detectives with pistols at\nthe ready. He spat out the words; R\u00f6hm, you are under arrest\u201d\n(Simkin, 2016, para. 97). Although Hitler did not want R\u00f6hm to\ndie, he was convinced there was no other way R\u00f6hm could be\nallowed to live. R\u00f6hm was murdered in his jail cell on 1 July 1934.\nHis close friends and their partners were then murdered under\nHitler\u2019s direct orders.\nAs Evans (2005) noted, Hitler continued to publicly\nweaponize R\u00f6hm\u2019s sexual orientation as a reason to remove him\nfrom power. Evans (2005) elaborated that Hitler denounced what\nhe referred to as anyone considered asocial, and attacks against gay\nmen increased.\nAs the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has\nrecorded, \u201cBetween 1933 and 1945, an estimated 100,000 men\nwere arrested for violating Nazi Germany\u2019s laws\u201d that were against\ngay men, \u201cand of these, approximately 50,000 were sentenced to\nprison.\u201d United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2019b). On 234\nthe 28th of June 1935, the Nazis amended Paragraph 175 to allow\nfor broader persecution of gay men.\nThe Nazi Amendment to Paragraph 175 is as follows:\nThe German Ministry of Justice revises Paragraphs 175 and\n175a of the German criminal code with the intent of 1)\nexpanding the range of criminal offenses to encompass any\ncontact between men, either physical or in form of word or\ngesture, that could be construed as sexual; and 2)\nstrengthening penalties for all violations of the revised law.\nThe revision facilitates the systematic persecution of\ngay men and provides police with broader means for\nprosecuting them. (United States Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum, 2019b)\nWithin the camp system, after 1937, prisoners were identified by a\nbadge or symbol. Gay men were marked with a pink triangle, as 235\nseen here in this 1938 image:\nThe men in the image were imprisoned in Sachsenhausen and were wearing the\npink triangle badge. The image is in the public domain and made possible\nthrough the National Archives and Records Administration.\nThroughout the Holocaust, gay men were subject to brutal\nmistreatment, torture, abuse, and medical experimentations. Few\nsurvived; the death rate of gay men in the Holocaust has been\n\u201cestimated to be as high as 60 percent--among the highest of non-\nJewish prisoners. By 1945, with the end of World War II and the\ndissolution of the Nazi government, only about 4,000 gay prisoners\nin the camps had survived\u201d (Kaczorowski, 2015). As Kaczorowski\n(2015) proved, reparations for gay men were not acknowledged\nafter the war, and only in the late twentieth century did 236\nconversations begin to recognize gay men as victims of the Nazis\nformally. Kaczorowski (2015) noted that \u201cIn May 2002, the\nGerman parliament completed legislation to pardon all gays\nconvicted under Paragraph 175 during the Nazi era.\u201d The Nazis\nalso targeted lesbians. Although their gender as viewed through a\nNazi lens lent a difference to how the Nazis perceived their\nsexuality.\nLesbians\nLesbians were also the targets of the Nazis, but as Gerdes\n(2015) discovered, \u201cwhen the Nazis considered expanding\nParagraph 175 in 1935, to include same-sex acts between women,\nthe discussions were halted on the basis that women played a\nrelatively minor role in public life\u201d (Gerdes, 2015). Therefore,\nthere are gender implications here that include biological\norientation. Because the Nazis viewed women as inferior to men,\nand since the \u201cReichsminister of Justice also concluded lesbian\nacts could not be clearly determined given women\u2019s generally\nmore intimate public contact\u201d(Gerdes, 2015). The Nazis viewed\nwomen as fertility vessels and believed all women could be used 237\nfor reproductive purposes. Gerdes (2015) argued that this\nmarginalization saved lesbians since the Nazis saw their sexuality\nas curable, intending to preserve women for reproductive purposes.\nScholars have further suggested that the \u201cimage of the\nGerman mother and wife is what likely saved the majority of\nGerman lesbians from being arrested and detained in one of the\nconcentration camps: their sexuality was seen as \u2018fixable\u2019 by the\nNazis\u201d (Gerdes, 2015). However, due to mistreatment within the\ncamp structure, as Gerdes (2015) elaborated, lesbians had a short\nlifespan and were subjected to barbaric sexual abuse and torture.\nNevertheless, why were lesbians not as much of a threat as gay\nmen were?\nWhat can be ascertained about the differences comes\ndirectly from the Reichminister\u2019s view, where he made a case for\nthe Nazi viewpoint that \u201cwomen\u2019s marginal role in public offices\nwould not allow them to falsify or bastardize public life like gay\nmen\u201d (Gerdes, 2015). Lesbianism was not criminalized, and\ninstead of pink triangles, lesbians wore a \u201cgreen badge,\ndenouncing them as Berufsverbrecher [established or \u2018career\u2019 238\ncriminals] or the black triangle, the \u2018asocial\u2019 badge, also worn by\nRomani and homeless people\u201d (Gerdes, 2015). Lesbians were also\nforced into brothels, where they were subjected to horrific acts of\ngendercide. More research is needed into this area of Holocaust\nstudies, where for decades, women\u2019s experiences were often\nexcluded from general scholarships. Historians such as Rochelle\nSaidel and Danny M. Cohen have worked tirelessly on narratives\nfrom marginalized survivors and victims of the Nazis.\nConcerning the LGBTQ experience during the Holocaust,\nscholarship is not as inclusive as it must be. Much more research\nand scholarship are needed. For LGBTQ survivors, many hid their\ntrauma; as government-sanctioned persecution went on, hate\ncrimes rose and today are still on the increase. Therefore, we can\nconclude that as Astrup Jensen (2021) stated, \u201cdue to limited\nresearch funding, the high death rate of gay men in the camps that\nthese victims are often forgotten by the world.\u201d Further, as Astrup\nJensen (2021) noted, with more inclusive scholarship, opening up\nthe stories of other non-Jewish victims of the Nazis will help 239\nexpand our understanding of how the Nazis targeted the LGBTQ\ncommunity.\nReferences\nAstrup Jensen, M.

The nature of this war meant that individuals who\nactively resisted faced constant threats of death or torture by the\nNazis if they were captured. This essay will highlight the role two\ngay men played in these movements and discuss the motivating\nfactors for gay men who put themselves in danger to oppose the\nNazis. As Adele-Marie pointed out, further study is needed on the\nrole of LGBTQ individuals who were persecuted and those who\nactively resisted the Nazis. The legacy of courage left by these men\nis crucial to remember when discussing different forms of\nresistance.\nNazi Germany was a mix of reactionary and revolutionary\npolitics, which means its revolutionary policies sought to transform\nsociety, but often these policies were reactions to liberal or left-\nwing beliefs. The Weimar government of the 1920s was one of the\nmost liberal social regimes of the time; this included gay rights and 242\nthe study of sexuality. The Nazi persecution of gay men was a part\nof their \u201csocial cleansing\u201d policies to eliminate gay men/ Jewish/\nCommunist/ influence in society that they believed was\nrepresented by the Weimar regime. By the 1930s, the very public\nactions of the Nazis in their book burnings, racial policies,\npersecution of Jews, and hatred for modern art made it clear to gay\nmen and artistic communities that the Nazis were a threat.\nThe social policies of Nazi Germany in occupied Western\nEurope included cultural censorship and a return to \u201cClassical\nArt.\u201d The artistic communities of the major European cities were\nthriving during the 20s and 30s, and the Nazi invasion of Western\nEurope brought this to an end. In the Netherlands, the Nazi\noccupation cultural committee was imposed by the Kulturkammer,\nwhich issued edicts on who could work in the arts and what could\nbe produced. It is in this context that the story of William\nArondeus\u2019 resistance begins.\nWilliam Arondeus was born in 1894 to a large family, the\nyoungest son of an Amsterdam fuel trader. At the age of 17,\ndeclaring his intention to become an artist and the fact that he was 243\na gay man, he fought with his parents and left home, beginning a\ncareer as a painter and later a writer. He authored and illustrated\nseveral short stories and books but led a modest life among the\nAmsterdam artistic circle. After the Nazi invasion, Arondeus\nbelieved it was his duty to resist and encouraged others to help in\nany way they can. In the spring of 1942, he founded\nBrandarisbrief, an illegal periodical in which he expressed his\nopposition to the occupying forces, their anti-Jewish actions, and\nthe Kulturkammer.\nDutch artists Gerrit van der Veen and composer, Jan van\nGilse had been publishing a similar underground resistance paper,\nthe De Vrije Kunsteenaar [The Free Artist], and in 1943, the two\npapers merged, and Arondeus became friends with van der Veen\nand his small band of resistance members in Amsterdam. Van der\nVeen was a specialist in forging documents for Jews and began the\nactivity shortly after refusing to declare himself an Aryan during\nthe first months of Nazi rule. After the merger, Arondeus began\nforging documents and using his artistic skills to produce quality\nforgeries rapidly. Frieda Belinfante, a Dutch cellist, conductor, and 244\nlesbian, was also a member of this resistance group and forged\ndocuments alongside Arondeus. They became great friends.\nThere was one major problem with producing forged\ndocuments in Amsterdam during this time, the Municipal Office\nfor Population Registration in the city centers meant that a\nresident\u2019s data could be checked, so forged cards could be easily\ndetected. Precise record-keeping by the Dutch was one of many\nreasons that 102,000 of the 140,000 Dutch Jews were murdered in\nthe Holocaust. The existence of this bureau posed an obstacle to\nrescuing Jews. Arondeus and van der Veen saw only one solution.\nGuards were consistently placed at strategic points all around the\nAmsterdam office, as a similar attack had occurred late in 1942.\nKnowing they would be on high alert for an attack, the resistance\ngroup would use this to their advantage. On March 27, 1943,\nWillem, dressed in an officer\u2019s uniform made from scratch\nalongside his lieutenant (van der Veen), four \u201cpoliceman\u201d and\nthree more \u201cofficers\u201d greeted the guards, stating they were there to\nsearch for bombs. Arondeus had pulled off his most significant\nartistic performance. The guards believed the story, and the group 245\nwalked in with several pounds of explosives, ready to destroy the\nbuilding. Two medical students among the group sedated the\nguards with phenobarbital and dragged them from the building.\nThe attack went as planned, with fire and explosives destroying\nmuch of the building; 800,000 identify cards were destroyed, and\n600 blank cards and 50,000 guilders were removed from the\nbuilding.\nThe group who carried out the attack all got away initially,\nbut the head of police in the German occupation administration\nwas infuriated and offered vast sums of money for information on\nthe group. In early April, Willem was captured, and later 13 other\nmembers of the group were arrested. Willem was found guilty and\nsentenced to death on June 18, 1943.\nLau Mazirel, a lawyer, and Dutch resistance member who\nwould later become one of the first activist attorneys for LGBTQ\nrights, visited Willem in prison shortly before his execution. He\nasked her to \u201ctell the world that gays are no less courageous than\nanyone else\u201d (Legacy Chicago, 2021). 246\nArondeus was murdered on July 1, 1943, along with 12\nother members of the resistance captured after the attack. In 1986,\nYad Vashem honored Willem and the planners and participants of\nthe attack as Righteous Among the Nations.\nFrieda Belinfante survived the war, moved to the U.S., and\nwas the founding artistic director and conductor of the Orange\nCounty Philharmonic.\nLau Marizel would become a lawyer for the COC\nNederland, founded in 1946, the oldest LGBT rights group in the\nworld, still operating today.\nWillem Arondeus\u2019s courage and character were something\nhe had his whole life, but his words can give us some insight into\nwhy some gay men sought out dangerous positions during the war.\nFor gay men growing up in the early 20th century, they were\nconstantly reminded that being gay was associated with a lack of\ncourage and forced to think that there was something medically\nwrong with them. Resistance movements in Western Europe\nprovided opportunities for gay men to fight back against the Nazis\nin any way they could, as distinctions such as someone\u2019s sexuality 247\nwas not a concern to these groups. Another example of this\nsentiment can be found in Denis Rake, whose interviews are\nluckily preserved in Marcel Ophuls\u2019 masterpiece on the occupation\nof France, The Sorrow and the Pity.\nDenis Rake was a British agent whose war records are filled\nwith talks of his bravery, character, and sense of duty. He operated\nfor most of the war in the underground with the resistance\nmovements in France. Born in 1901 in England, Rake was older\nthan most men serving in the SOE-the special operations\nexecutive. Rake led an exciting life before the war, starring in\nmusicals and touring Europe. He stated that he wanted to be in the\nunderground due to his anxiety about being gay. Rake also said\nthat he wanted to prove to himself that he was as courageous as\nothers. As Marcel Ophuls points out in the interview, he was\naffected by the prejudice of others that he had internalized,\nconstantly volunteering for dangerous missions. His theater\nbackground, mastery of French, and his determination to act with\ncourage made him an outstanding agent. 248\nDuring the war, thousands of gay men fought to defeat the\nNazis, and we will never know the precise number. Studying the\nbackgrounds of resistance members and rescuers during the\nHolocaust is an essential task for future scholars. You will find that\nmany resistance fighters and rescuers during the Holocaust often\nhad a history of helping social causes or came from groups that\nfaced persecution themselves. A valuable lesson, and I encourage\nthe next generation of scholars to be active in scholarship and their\ncommunities, as you never know when a moment of steadfast\nresistance to injustice will present itself.\nReferences\nLegacy Chicago.

She had served in three notorious\ncamps: Ravensbr\u00fcck, Auschwitz-Birkenau, and Bergen-Belsen and\nshe held the distinction of being one of the youngest women to\nwork on behalf of the SS. Because of her startling beauty, her\nyouth, and enraged cruelty against concentration camp victims,\nIrma Grese became the center of attention at her postwar trial.\nThere had been so much publicity about her in newspapers,\nmagazines, and other periodicals around the world that she became\nbetter known than many of Hitler\u2019s notorious henchmen.\nMany simply could not believe that such a pretty, young\nblonde girl with an innocent face could be capable of committing 251\nthe crimes that she had been indicted for by the British. Grese is\nremembered by many survivors as to just how calloused and brutal\na human being could be. Even after many years, the memory of\nGrese would still conjure up horrendous flashbacks of her sadistic\nacts against defenseless people. Sadly, there is no way one can\ncount just how many deaths she was responsible for, but it had to\nhave been thousands, especially during the May 1944 mass\nselections of the Hungarians Jews who flooded into Auschwitz-\nBirkenau.\nThe childhood and early life of Irma Grese is well\ndocumented in several published accounts; as a result, my study\nwill only examine the basic facts of her childhood years and place\nmore emphasis on her time in the camps.\nIrma Grese was born on October 7, 1923, in a small\nGerman village of Wrechen, approximately forty kilometers from\nNeustrelitz. Her parents were worked as managers of an estate and\nIrma was one of five children\u2014she had two brothers and two\nsisters. Irma Grese\u2019s mother committed suicide by ingesting a\ncleaning agent that contained hydrogen chloride in January 1936. 252\nGrese was only twelve at that time and it must have had an effect\non her because she discovered her mother as she began to die from\nthis horrific method of killing herself (Brown, 2004, p. 11, 13-14).\nThe people from Wrechen never spoke about her much\nafter the war because the small village is mainly known for the\nbirthplace of the most notorious female guard and the residents\nwere, of course, not proud of it. Also, Wrechen was located in the\nformer German Democratic Republic (GDR), or \u201cEast Germany,\u201d\nand one had to shed any connection to Nazism for self-\npreservation.\nAs many young German children, Irma Grese was\nfascinated with Nazi ideology, its symbolism, and exuberance.\nWith her sister, she joined the organization Bund Deutscher M\u00e4del\n(\u201cLeague of German Girls\u201d), which was the female version of the\nmale Hitlerjugend (\u201cHitler Youth\u201d) Nazi organization. Their father\ndid not want them to join the group, but the two sisters joined it\neven with their father\u00b4s opposition.\nIrma Grese attended primary school for eight years and, in\n1938, at the age of fourteen, she left school. Some sources say that 253\nshe was bullied and did not see a reason for going to school\nanymore. (Prima ZOOM, 2020). She worked at the F\u00fcrstenberg\ndairy factory and then as a sales assistant in a small shop in nearby\nLychen, Germany. From 1939 until 1941, she served as an\nassistant nurse at the SS sanatorium in Hohenlychen. She worked\nunder the head of the hospital, Karl Gebhardt, who later performed\nhorrific experiments on women in the female concentration camp,\nRavensbr\u00fcck. Grese tried to become a nurse, but it did not work\nout. Failing at that, she applied for the women\u00b4s SS service and\nvolunteered to train for a position as an Aufseherin (\u201csupervisor\u201d)\nin Ravensbr\u00fcck (Brown, 2004, p. 17, 19, 23-27 and Gedenkst\u00e4tte,\n2004).\nRavensbr\u00fcck 1942-1943\nIrma Grese\u2019s application was accepted by the Nazi\nauthorities and she enrolled in the female guards\u2019 training program\nat Ravensbr\u00fcck in July 1942. She completed the course and\nbecame Aufseherin. Because she was one of the youngest female\nguards, her pay salary was 54 Reichsmarks a month, which was 254\nmuch less than the salary of her colleagues received. (Brown,\n2004, p. 38 and 40-41).\nApart from being the biggest concentration camp for\nwomen, Ravensbr\u00fcck was also a training center for the new female\nguards. Between 1939 and 1945 more than 1,000 male SS guards\nand over 3 000 female guards served in the camp and its subcamps.\nThe first commandant was SS Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer Max Koegel. He\nwas succeeded in the summer of 1942 by SS Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer\nFritz Suhren. The replacement of the commandant was the time\nwhen Grese began serving in Ravensbr\u00fcck (Be\u00dfmann &\nEschebach, 2013, p. 167, 173-174). In July 1942, the chief guard\n(Oberaufseherin) was Maria Mandl.\nBecause the chief female guard was also responsible for the\ntraining program of the new female guards, it is possible that\nMandl herself was in charge of Grese\u00b4s training. Grese with other\nAufseherinnen learned their regulations and were taught how to\noversee the prisoners as well as how to punish and beat them. It\nwas then when Grese was instructed in the finer points of cruelty\nand callousness toward her prisoners. Indeed, it was well known 255\nthat these young women changed dramatically after completing\ntheir training program (H\u00e1jkov\u00e1, 1963, p. 32, 288).\nGrese finished her training after about three weeks and then\nwas assigned to oversee several work details. She oversaw\nprisoners the laundry detail as well as the Opitz Nursery and\nGardening operation. During her leave, Irma Grese returned to\nvisit her family in Wrechen for the last time. She came home\nwearing her uniform to impress her family with her position in the\nfemale guard unit. It was during this visit that a fight between her\nand her father ensued and Grese never returned home again\n(Brown, 2004, p. 37-40).\nAuschwitz-Birkenau 1943-1945\nIn March 1943, Irma Grese was deployed to Auschwitz-\nBirkenau. At first, she worked as a telephone operator in the office\nof a Blockf\u00fchrer (Brown, 2004, p. 43). After that she supervised\nseveral female details for about a year. As former prisoner Erich\nKulka noted in his account, \u201cShe was in Birkenau for a long time\nand had lots of different duties.\u201d (Kraus & Kulka, 1964, p. 242). 256\nIn addition, Grese supervised a women\u2019s detail that built\nroads., Then, for some infraction of camp regulations, she was\nassigned to monitor a punishment detail where prisoners worked in\nthe worst conditions and where the death rate was the greatest in\nthe whole camp. Following this, Grese was given a gardening\ndetail in Rajsko, one of the subcamps of Birkenau (Cywi\u0144ski et al.,\n2017, p.77). She also oversaw a detail that picked herbs for the\ncamp hospital. This particular detail was set up with the agreement\nof SS Dr. Werner Rhode. After nearly three months of operation,\nthis particular detail was cancelled (Zeszyty O\u015bwiecimskie 24,\n2006, p. 65).\nIrma Grese developed a reputation for excessive cruelty\nwhile overseeing all of these different work details. She would\noften release her dog on the defenseless prisoners under her\ncommand, especially on those details that took place outside the\ncamp complex (Brown, 2004, p. 52). Her cruelty was soon known\nthroughout Auschwitz-Birkenau. During 1943, Grese served as the\nblock, or barracks, leader (Blockf\u00fchrerin) of various barracks of\nthe women\u00b4s camp in Birkenau. For a time, she oversaw the 257\npackages section where female prisoners sorted parcels that had\nbeen sent by the prisoners\u2019 friends and relatives. Grese helped\nherself to some of the packages and also delighted in making\ninmates wait for their packages during rollcalls in frigid weather.\nIn December 1943, she worked in the postal department where she\ncensored the prisoner\u00b4s letters (Posmysz & W\u00f3jcik, 2017, p. 395;\nBrown, 2004, p. 44; and Cywi\u0144ski et al., 2017, p. 77).\nPromotion in 1944\nThe most important time for Grese came in May 1944\nwhen Auschwitz-Birkenau was awaiting mass transports from\nHungary. At this time, she became directly involved with the\nselections of the Hungarian Jews, which was the biggest killing\naction in the history of Auschwitz. She was promoted to be the\nLagerf\u00fchrerin (camp leader) of the new camp, BIIc, also known as\nC Lager (Camp C), which contained approximately 30,000\nHungarian female Jews. However, it must be pointed out that\nGrese had not become the chief guard of the whole Women\u00b4s\nBirkenau camp, but only of the \u201cC\u201d component. By the summer of\n1944, BIIc had been reduced to roughly 20,000 young women 258\nmainly from Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Poland (Expressen,\n1945 and Smole\u0144, 1972, p. 106).\nDue to the Soviet advance, the prisoners were awaiting\ntransports to other camps in the West. By this time, there was a\nshortage of the already meager rations and the hygienic conditions\nhad deteriorated (Smole\u0144, 1972, p. 105-106). Grese was bears\nsome of the responsibility for the inhuman conditions in her area of\nthe camp and the poor inmates under her charge had to bear the\nconsequences of her calloused behavior. Due to her elevated\nposition within the women\u2019s camp, Irma Grese would become\nknown as one of the most ruthless and brutal of all the camp\nguards.\nMost of the prisoners got to know firsthand about Irma\nGrese\u2019s cruelty during the daily and dreaded roll calls. She would\nusually arrive at the roll calls by bicycle, and she would gleefully\nwhistle while the nearly 20,000-30,000 inmates had already been\nstanding a couple of hours on their feet, in formation, in front of\ntheir blocks, waiting for her arrival, regardless of what it was like\noutside (Expressen, 1945). The prisoners who saw her for the very 259\nfirst time could not believe that such a beautiful blonde woman\nwith an angelic face could be cruel. They had no idea what they\nwere about to experience.\nAs other SS guards arrived at the roll call to commence the\nprisoner count, Grese stood out: she would generally wear well-\ntailored greenish grey culottes, usually with a white blouse or a\nlight blue shirt, her blonde hair pulled up into a bun, her SS hat\ncurtly placed atop her hair, and she had on black high boots that\nwere highly polished (Heged\u00fcs, 2014, p. 50-51; Expressen, 1945;\nand Lengyelov\u00e1, 2018, p. 263). She also carried a silver pistol in\nher holster (Moskovits, 1993, p. 172). During the count, Grese\nwould whip individual prisoners for the smallest movement with\nher infamous whip that was fashioned from brown-red leather.\nGrese always carried her whip inside one of her boots (Sch\u00f6n &\nKraus, 1945, p. 87 and Lengyelov\u00e1, 2018, p. 263). Grese hit the\nprisoners with such powerful blows that they would fall to the\nground instantaneously. One survivor from Slovakia described\nhow Grese once broke an arm of a woman who did not want to\nkneel as a punishment for religious reasons (USC Shoah 260\nFoundation's Visual History Archive, Interview with Livia\nVogelmann). She was also capable of kicking or beating inmates to\ndeath if they fell out due to weakness or if they were not able to\nstand up straight. Often her beatings were simply wanton acts of\nbrutality for which the victim was simply close enough for Grese\nto attack. Finally, Grese never hit the inmates without her hands in\ngloves (Expressen, 1945).\nGrese would very often make the whole camp stand for\nhours at a time. Sometimes she ordered the prisoners to stand in\nplace completely naked. The prisoners were not allowed to leave\nthe formation until she gave the order to disperse (Expressen,\n1945). Because of these conditions, some prisoners fainted then\nGrese trampled on them and/or set her big German shepherd on\nthem (Erlichman, 2000, p. 36). She was known for punishing\nindividual prisoners, blocks or even the whole camp with long\nhours of kneeling and sometimes the prisoners were forced to hold\nbricks above their heads (Cywi\u0144ski et al., 2017, p. 77 and\nExpressen, 1945).\nSelections 261\nDuring the roll calls, Grese and some other guards selected\nindividual prisoners for direct transport to the gas chambers. Many\nprisoners mentioned that they witnessed Irma Grese and Dr. Josef\nMengele conducting these selections the more than others. Her\nmere presence struck feared in the prisoners and a few even\nbecame hysterical when they saw her approaching. Again, due to\nher striking physical features, immaculate dress, flawless\ncomplexion, and relentless brutality, her image was etched in the\nmemory of those who survived.\nThere were terrible scenes that occurred during the macabre\nselection process. Grese would often join a few of the other SS\nguards and Dr. Mengele. She would then conduct a \u201cparade,\u201d a\nprocedure in which prisoners would pass in front of her. She\npicked whoever she found desired. Once she picked the most\nemaciated women, but the next time, she would those who had\nskin rash (Expressen, 1945). She shot at prisoners who tried to\nescape their selection to be transported to the gas chambers\n(Brown, 2004, p. 80). She would even whip the prisoners chosen.\nDuring the selections she would not show any mercy and calmly 262\nsend thousands of women to their deaths (Lengyelov\u00e1, 2018, p.\n170, 264). She purposefully tore relatives apart who attempted to\ngo together on a work detail (Brown, 2004, p. 53)\nActs of Kindness\nAlthough Grese was known for her brutal acts, it must be\nnoted that there were occasions in which she behaved much\ndifferently; indeed, she even acted with kindness. During some\nselections, she would save some of the prisoners. For example, this\nhappened when she saved a woman on sixteen separate occasions\nfrom a selection overseen by Dr. Mengele (Camurati, 2017). Grese\nwas able also to help in some way the prisoners who worked for\nher and she arranged their meeting with their relatives in the camp\n(Schnurmacher. 2019, p. 152). She picked the prisoners whom she\nwanted for personal assistance. An excellent seamstress from\nMunk\u00e1cs, Hungary, personally sewed uniforms for her while a\ndifferent seamstress from Budapest attended to other clothing\nGrese wanted to add to her wardrobe (Heged\u00fcs, 2014, p. 51 and\nLengyelov\u00e1, 2018, p. 263, 269). 263\nWhen Grese was on duty at Bergen-Belsen, she once\ncaught young girls picking up potatoes which they found and let\nthem go without any punishment or beating (Verolme, 2016, p.\n217-218). She took a liking to some prisoners too. This happened\nto a Polish prisoner named Nina Kaleska. Grese made her work for\nher and she gave her extra rations from her private food supply\n(Miller, 2000, p. 36).\nFinally, Irma Grese had a friendly relationship with\nLager\u00e4lteste (Head prisoner of compound BIIc), Magda (nee\nHellinger) Blau. However, as Mrs. Blau later said, \u201cShe could talk\nto me like a friend; and the next minute she was a devil\u201d (Miller,\n2000, p. 139).\nThe Daily Hunt for Victims\nApart from roll calls and selections, Irma Grese had\nauthority over the administration of her camp. She seemed to be\nubiquitous. She seemingly could appear anywhere, at any time, and\nshe took great satisfaction when she saw prisoners were quickly\nevading her. She spied on the starving prisoners who were trying to\nget some food by the camp kitchen and then she would take delight 264\nin brutally punishing them on the spot or she would shoot them\noutright (Perl & Preston 2017, p. 140 and Schnurmacher, 2019, p.\n152). She was active in the camp during curfew lockdown when\nprisoners were supposed to be in their blocks. If she located\nsomeone not in her designated place, Grese would give the\noffender a thrashing (Expressen, 1945).\nSurvivor of Lager C, Isabella Leitner wrote: \u201cYou\u00b4d rather\ngo to the crematorium than get into her hands\u201d (Leitner& Leitner,\n1994, p. 228). However, Grese was not alone in her enjoyment of\ninflicting pain on violators. Other female wardens in the\nAuschwitz-Birkenau retinue took part in these daily acts of\nSchadenfreude, making the prisoners\u2019 lives miserable. These\nnotorious female overseers included the Rapportf\u00fchrerin Margot\nDrechsel, Luise Brunner and Elisabeth Hasse (Heged\u00fcs, 2014, p.\n50).\nThe Most Beautiful Women Prisoners\nGrese was known for her perverse inclinations (Sch\u00f6n &\nKraus, 1945, p. 87). She specifically picked out and sexually\nabused attractive and/or well-endowed young Jewish girls. Grese 265\nwas relentless in hunting down those who did not want to have\nanything with her or were seen purposefully evading her (Kraus &\nKulka, 1964, p. 126). She would usually dispatch the female\nprisoners she had raped to the crematorium. (Lengyelov\u00e1, 2018, p.\n314). On one occasion, Irma Grese made another prisoner stand as\na guard in front of a barracks where she was raping other Jewish\ngirls (Miller, 2000, p. 36). She focused on the pretty women in\nother ways than sexually. At times, she would walk around the\ncamp and beat them on their breasts with her whip (Langbein,\n2004, p. 400). She would take pretty girls, throw them on the\nground, beat them until they were bleeding and then send them to\nthe crematorium (USC Shoah Foundation's Visual History\nArchive, Interview with Relly Geller).\nGrese sent a large number of prisoners to their deaths every\nday in this manner and she did so completely on her own. Because\nher beauty, Grese had numerous lovers in the Birkenau camp.\nThere were rumors that at one time she was the girlfriend of Dr.\nJosef Mengele, because she joined him very often. But the most\nimportant affair she had was with an enlisted SS guard named 266\nFranz Wolfgang Hatzinger, who later died of typhus in the Bergen-\nBelsen camp (Lengyelov\u00e1, 2018, p. 263; Brown, 2004, p. 64).\nLiquidation of Lager C and Her Promotion to Rapportf\u00fchrerin\nGrese and Dr. Mengele led the final selection in compound\nBIIc (Perl with Preston 2017: 178-187). In December 1944, after\nthe liquidation, the remaining strong prisoners were sent on\ntransports to other camps as slave laborers and the sick prisoners\nwere dispatched to the gas chambers, Grese was promoted to\nRapportf\u00fchrerin in the main women\u00b4s camp of Birkenau\n(Cywi\u0144ski et al., 2017, p. 77). The rank of Rapportf\u00fchrerin was the\nsecond highest rank for a female guard and it entailed Grese being\nresponsible for the daily roll call parades, disciplinary\ninvestigation, and oversight of punishments (Ian Baxter, personal\ncommunication, December 11, 2020).\nWhen the evacuation of Auschwitz began, Grese guarded\none of the last transports sent from the Auschwitz-Birkenau\ncomplex to Ravensbr\u00fcck. Other female guards from Auschwitz\nalso assigned to the same transport bound for Ravensbr\u00fcck. She\nwas there only for a couple of weeks before being sent to Bergen- 267\nBelsen camp in March 1945 (Mahn-und Gedenkstatte\nRavensbr\u00fcck, 2004).\nBergen-Belsen\nGrese arrived in Bergen-Belsen with a huge prisoner\ntransport in March 1945 and this time she was appointed as\nArbeitsdienstf\u00fchrerin (the work service leader, who was\nresponsible for assigning prisoners to their work details as well as\noverseeing the prisoners\u2019 labor). She also was given the duty of\nbeing a Rapportf\u00fchrein. Irma Grese was only at Bergen-Belsen for\nthree and a half weeks and, even as the war was rapidly coming to\na close, she continued her brutal treatment of the prisoners (Brown,\n2004, p. 63, 65). Indeed, Grese did not relinquish her favorite\nactivity--beating women on the face until they fell to the ground.\nThe prisoners who knew Grese at Auschwitz could see that there\nhad been some physical changes taking place with her physical\nappearance. For one thing, she seemed to be pale. As in\nAuschwitz-Birkenau, Irma Grese was attired in her work uniform\nand wore a cap with a peak (Expressen, 1945). 268\nGrese did not attempt to improve the terrible conditions\nwhich existed in the camp and she seemed content to let thousands\nof prisoners to die of hunger (RFU, 2019). As the camp\nArbeitsdienstf\u00fchrerin, it was her job to monitor the daily prisoners\nmarch to work and their return to the camp compound. She also\nsupervised new transports that came into the camp. (Ian Baxter,\npersonal communication, December 11, 2020) She had an office\nnear the women\u00b4s camp gate (Verolme, 2016, p. 217-218). Since\nthere were many children brought to Belsen with their mothers,\nGrese often visited them and tormented the young inmates\npsychologically.\nSurvivor Barry Spanjaard, who was a young boy when he\nwas imprisoned in Belsen, described in his memoir how Grese\noften purposely stood in front of the starving inmates while eating\ncheese or a sandwich (Spanjaard, 1982, p. 147-148). I was lucky\nenough to get in contact with few survivors from Bergen-Belsen\nwho saw Grese there. One of them Mr. Maurice Blik from the New\nNetherlands had a similar experience like Spanjaard and told me\nabout one visit of Grese into their barracks with her dog while 269\nenjoying eating an apple in front of the prisoners. He noted that all\nthe while she had a smile on her face (Maurice Blik, personal\ncommunication, February 29, 2020). Mr. Tomi Reichental from\nSlovakia told me about Grese\u00b4s visit to the children\u00b4s barracks with\nher whip. He also told me that there were rumors that when Grese\ncaught inmates trying to communicate through separate sections of\nBelsen camp, she beat them (Reichental, personal communication,\nDecember 16, 2018; January 9, 2019). Mr. Ivan Lefkovits from\nSlovakia was one of the children of Belsen and he remembered\nseeing Grese with her whip in the street. His mother warned him\nnot to make eye contact with her because they learned from other\ninmates that even an eye contact could make her use her whip\n(Lefkovits, personal communication, February 5, 2019).\nWhile watching the prisoner marches, Grese inspected\nthem as they returned from work. She once attacked a Czech\nprisoner whom she found a knife hiding in her socks. The prisoner\nwas Zdenka Fantl who shared her testimony with me. Fantl\nconfirmed Grese was wearing a working uniform, a jacket and a\ncap with peak. She continued by saying that Grese \u201cgave orders 270\nnot only to the prisoners but also other female guards and had huge\npower over everybody in the Belsen camp\u201d (Zdenka Fantl,\npersonal communication, December 7-8, 2018). As in Auschwitz-\nBirkenau, Irma Grese continued the practice of making the\nprisoners endure standing for lengthy period of time during roll\ncalls. She and other guards sometime enjoyed throwing water over\nthe female prisoners standing in freezing temperatures (Ian Baxter,\npersonal communication, September 30, 2020).\nTrial\nGrese was arrested on April 17, 1945, shortly after British\nunits liberated Bergen-Belsen. The liberators were in profoundly\naffected by what they saw in the camp, as appeared to be \u201chell on\nearth.\u201d In fact, even years after the event, many still found it\ndifficult to articulate what they witnessed.\nIrma Grese was put on trial with other guards on September\n17, 1945 in L\u00fcneburg. She and the camp commandant, Josef\nKramer, became the immediate focus for the press covering the\nproceedings (Mahn-und Gedenkstatte, Ravensbr\u00fcck, 2004). Even\nat the trial, Irma Grese made sure that she looked picture-perfect. 271\nShe also transformed her hairstyle as she now flaunted \u201c. . . a\ncoiffured look accenting her blonde ringlets\u201d (Brown, 2004, 77).\nJournalists who observed the trial described how beautiful she was.\nHowever, most of the time her demeanor was cold, distant, and\ncontemptuous. On some occasions the 21-year-old would laugh,\nbut these incidents were usually the result of some false and absurd\nconcern for the plight of the prisoners that a defense witness made.\nOnce in a while she would also provide court photographers with a\ndemure smile. One of the more damning admissions Irma Grese\nhad to make in court was when she admitted that she continued to\ncarry a whip in violation of the camp commandant\u2019s order against\nguards using them (Langbein, 2004, p. 400).\nWitnesses described Grese\u00b4s extraordinary brutality and\ntestified that she had taken part in selections for the gas chambers,\nshot at women prisoners, had beaten and kicked them, and forced\nthem to kneel for hours at roll calls while holding heavy stones\nabove their heads (Cywi\u0144ski et al., 2017, p. 77).\nThe court sentenced her to death by hanging and the\nsentence was carried out on December 13, 1945. On the eve of 272\ntheir executions, Grese is said to have sung Nazi songs in her cell\nwith the two other condemned female guards (Langbein, 2004,\n401). She was the youngest woman ever executed under the\nauspices of British legal practices (RFU, 2019).\nReferences\nAnna Moln\u00e1r Heged\u0171s (2014).

Gender cannot be ignored when\nanalyzing the horrors that occurred during the Third Reich\u2019s\nattempt to eradicate European Jewry and other marginalized\ncommunities. Indoctrinated with hate, Nazi women such as Dr.\nHerta Oberheuser and Irma Grese blurred gender roles by imitating\nmen. These same women glorified in taking part in abuse and\nmurder.\nNazi Women\nWith the Nazi party's rise to power in Germany in 1933,\nNational Socialists sought to return women to subordinate\npositions in society. Women were to return to their domestic\nspheres, and preferably, proudly have blonde hair, blue-eyed\nbabies for the Fatherland. Despite the dominant misogynistic\norientation of the ideology, Nazism attracted some women who\nsaw the party as one that restored feminine honor and ideals,\nnevertheless, most women found it difficult to achieve any real 278\nstatus within the Nazi party. Women could not join the elite sectors\nof the Nazi party; however, they could marry a Nazi official to\ngain authority or influence.\nOutside of marriage, female allegiance further manifested\nitself via employment as Aufseherinnen [female overseer], or in\nother positions found throughout different sectors of the\ncamps. The camp structure was one of the only ways which\nallowed for women to be promoted to better positions and\ntherefore provide them with a sense of purpose. Despite traditional\nstereotypes which see women portrayed as homely and nurturing,\nNazi women were responsible for many of the atrocities committed\nwithin the camps. Indoctrinated with hate, Nazi women\nsuch as Herta Oberheuser and Irma Grese blurred gender roles by\ndirectly participating in the Holocaust.\nHerta Oberheuser\nIt was extremely rare in pre-WWII society for women to\nbecome practicing doctors. A woman's highest calling was\nmotherhood. In 1934, Hitler said that a woman's world is her\nhusband, her family, her children, and her house (Travis, 2018). 279\nThe Nazi party repealed laws that had previously protected\nwomen's rights and introduced new laws barring women from\ngovernment and university positions, restricting women to the\nhome.\nWomen's rights groups, such as the moderate Bund\nDeutscher Frauenvereine [Federation of German Women's\nAssociations] were disbanded; replaced with new social groups\nreinforcing Nazi values (Gruesbeck, n.d.). When the circumstances\nof the war became unfavorable to Nazi Germany in the early\n1940s, more men were required to join the ranks on the front lines,\nallowing for women to be reluctantly called upon to fill positions\nwhich were predominantly held by men (Wodenshek, 2015).\nDespite the fact that women were granted a license to practice,\nthey were always given less of a chance to establish themselves as\npractitioners.\nBorn in May of 1911 in Cologne, Germany, Dr. Herta\nOberheuser received her medical degree in Bonn in 1937,\nspecializing in Dermatology (Mikaberidze, 2013). Following the\ncompletion of her medical training, 26-year-old Oberheuser joined 280\nthe Nazi party as an intern and later as a physician for the League\nof German Maidens (Frankenburg, 2017). By 1940, Oberheuser\nwas assigned as assistant physician to Dr. Karl Gebhardt, Chief\nSurgeon of the Nazi policing organization known as the\nSchutzstaffel or SS and was the personal physician to Reichsf\u00fchrer\nSS Heinrich Himmler (Mikaberidze, 2019). With hopes to expand\ntheir knowledge of infections, Dr. Gebhardt and Dr. Oberheuser\narrived at Ravensbr\u00fcck eager to use prisoners as their experimental\nvictims (Helm, 2016).\nAlthough Oberheuser was very much a doctor, as a female,\nshe was never granted membership to the SS (Adele-Marie, 2019).\nOberheuser, like many of the other women of the Third Reich took\nadvantage of the \u201copportunity\u201d granted them within the\nuntraditional concentration camp domain. To prove herself,\nOberheuser acted without regard for male superior officer\u2019s orders,\noften stepping outside of the chain of command to conduct her\nresearch. She performed some of the cruelest and most appalling\nmedical experiments on prisoners; during her trial the survivors of\nher experiments stated that she purposely acted cruelly, 281\nwithholding beneficial medicines seemingly at her whim (Adele-\nMarie, 2019).\nIt was Oberheuser\u2019s job as a physician to examine the\nwomen and evaluate suitability for experiments. Prisoners had\ntheir legs cut open, bacteria placed in the wounds, and then sewed\nup to study the healing process (Galberg, 2020). To analyze\nbattlefield wounds, prisoners were subject to gunshots and broken\nbones (Clarke et al., 2013). Blood flow would then be restricted\nto the injury and foreign objects such as wood or glass were\nintroduced to simulate damage from shrapnel (Nuremberg Military\nTribunals, 1949). Many prisoners were subjected to multiple\nrounds of injuries. Additionally, once a patient was no longer\nuseful, Oberheuser would inject them with gasoline to kill them\nfaster. These experiments were executed without the use of\nanesthesia or other medicines, causing immense pain, permanent\nnerve damage, paralysis, or death from shock (Nuremberg Military\nTribunals, 1949). 282\nFollowing the end of the war, Oberheuser was the only\nwoman to stand trial at the Nuremberg Doctors\u2019 Trial. Victims\u2019\ntestimonies from the trial emphasized that the doctors\nignored hygiene standards, using unsterilized medical dressings\nand instruments, while not adhering to the principles of asepsis\n(Stefaniak-Mr\u00f3wczy\u0144ska, 1946). One of the patients who\nsurvived, Stanislaw Michalak, described removing the stitches of\nher wounds in the hope that letting the pus out would relieve some\nof the physical anguish brought on by the removal of parts\nof her leg bones (Doris Ronowicz Symonowicz, 1970). Describing\nthe lack of sanitation, Zofia Stefaniak-Mr\u00f3wczy\u0144ska, recalled that\nwhen doctors removed the plaster from her leg, they found\na nest of bugs in her wound (Symonowicz, 1970).\nIn August of 1947, Oberheuser was found guilty of\ncommitting war crimes and crimes against humanity and sentenced\nto 20 years in prison for her part in conducting human\nexperimentation at Ravensbr\u00fcck (Annas & Grodin, 1992). After\njust five years in prison, she was released for good behavior and\nreturned to work as a doctor at a family medical practice 283\n(Wodenshek, 2015).\nAfter six years, she was recognized by a former\nRavensbr\u00fcck inmate, resulting in the loss of her medical license.\nWhile Oberheuser\u2019s victims survived the horrific experiments she\nconducted, they were left to suffer permanent and painful damages\nwhile she resumed a normal life until her death in 1978, unmarred\nby her past actions (Townsend, 1958). Dr. Herta Oberheuser\u2019s\nstrength and success within the male-dominated Nazi medical field\ninspired other female Nazis like Irma Grese to have the confidence\nto try and rise through the ranks, despite the sexism of Nazi\nideology.\nIrma Grese\nIrma Grese, also known as The Beautiful Beast, was born\nto Berta and Alfred Grese, on October 7th, 1923. She grew up in\nWrechen, Mecklenburg, just 50 miles north of Berlin, as one\nof five children, in a rural community where her conservative,\nchurchgoing father worked as a dairy farmer (Daniel Patrick\nBrown, 2004). When Grese was just a child, her mother committed 284\nsuicide, leaving Grese and her siblings to be raised by her abusive\nfather. In 1933, the Nazi Party enacted the Enabling Act. This act\nmandated all schools teach Nazi ideals and ideas to students.\nThis is where Grese\u2019s Nazi indoctrination began.\nLike her sisters, Grese wanted to join the highly\nromanticized Bund Deutscher M\u00e4del or BDM, the female version\nof the Hitler youth (Adele-Marie, 2012). Grese\u2019s father forbade his\ndaughters from joining the BDM or any other Nazi organization\n(Southern, 2018), but per contra, the BDM became compulsory for\nall Aryan female youth (The League of German Girls , 2015).\nGrese\u2019s troubled home left her seeking support and acceptance\nwhich she found as a member of the BDM, but as a result of her\nmembership, tensions with her father escalated.\nAfter unsuccessfully pursuing careers in farming and\nbusiness, Grese settled for an apprenticeship as a nurse\u2019s aide\nunder the guidance of Dr. Karl Gebhardt and Dr. Herta\nOberheuser, at the SS convalescent Hohenlychen Medical Hospital\n(Silver, 2011). Gebhardt took a special interest in Grese, as she\nwas very young, beautiful, and eager. Although Grese would 285\nnot succeed within the medical field, Gebhardt recognized Grese\u2019s\n\u2018ambition\u2019, and wanted her to put forth what \u2018talents\u2019 she did have\nto work in furthering the success of the Third Reich (Adele-Marie,\n2019).\nWhen a position at the all-women\u2019s camp for a new female-\nguard became available, Gebhart helped eighteen-year-old Grese\nget the job. Having been trained by Nazis, and previously exposed\nto the Ravensbr\u00fcck experiments performed by Oberheuser and\nthe other SS doctors at Hohenlychen, the young, impressionable\ngirl had been desensitized to the sadistic treatment of Nazi\nprisoners and would stop at nothing to be seen as an equal to her\nmale counterparts, no matter the human cost (Adele-Marie, 2019).\nGrese quickly made her way up the latter as the youngest Nazi\nwoman with status, authority, and relative autonomy as\ncompared to other women who worked for the SS.\nIn 1943 she was promoted to a guard position at\nAuschwitz-Birkenau. There, at age 21, Grese was placed in charge\nof 30,000 Jewish female prisoners. Grese relished her power and 286\nused it to abuse, and rape prisoners. She also took great joy and\nsexual gratification from watching the torture of the prisoners by\ncamp doctors, sometimes participating in the torture despite not\nbeing a doctor (Adele-Marie, 2019).\nPer various recollections of survivors, Grese is said to have\nkilled at least 30 people per day. Grese was also notorious for\nsetting vicious dogs on prisoners as part of her brutal reign in\nthe Birkenau women\u2019s camp. Among Grese\u2019s other notorious\nexploits at Auschwitz-Birkenau was tying the legs together of a\nwoman about to give birth and watching her writhe in agony\n(Southern, 2018). Grese\u2019s violent nature did not always sit well\nwith the other SS men, as they saw her actions as beyond the scope\nof what they considered \u201cappropriate\u201d for a female guard\n(Adele-Marie, 2019). However, she used her youth and sexual\nattractiveness as a way to make up for this.\nGisella Perl, an inmate physician, recalls some of Grese\u2019s\nmasochistic behaviors during operations:\nI happened to look up and encountered the most horrible\nsight I have ever seen, the memory of which will haunt me 287\nfor the rest of my life. Irma Grese was enjoying the sight of\nthis human suffering. Her tense body swung back and forth\nin a revealing, rhythmical motion. Her cheeks were flushed,\nand her wide-open eyes had the rigid, staring look of\ncomplete sexual paroxysm. She did this on multiple\noccasions so she could relive this sadistic moment\nrepeatedly. She always came to watch the operations of\nthese women whose breasts had been slashed open and had\nbecome infected with the lice and dirt which pervaded the\nwomen\u2019s camp. (Southern, 2018)\nPerl also noted how Grese would invariably arrive to watch the\noperation, kicking the victim if their screams interfered with her\nmasturbating pleasure and \u201cgiving herself completely to the\norgasmic spasms which shook her entire body and made saliva run\ndown from the corner of her mouth\u201d (Southern, 2018).\nOn June 16, 1945, Grese was indicted with Josef Kramer\nand 43 other Belsen personnel on charges of murder and\nmaltreatment of prisoners. During the Nuremberg trial\ninvestigation interrogations, Grese stood firm, stating that she was 288\n\u201cconvinced all that had happened was right\u201d (Southern, 2018).\nGrese was convicted and sentenced to be hanged, along with two\nother female guards. She was executed on the morning of\nDecember 13, 1945, in Hamelin prison. Grese remained\nunrepentant and unremorseful till her execution, continuing to\nbelieve that her acts were justified by the principles on which\nNazism was based.\nThe cases of Dr. Herta Oberheuser and Irma Grese\ndemonstrate just two of many women who attained great power\nunder the Nazi regime. All of the concentration camps were\ndeadly, regardless these women and their particularly sadistic\napproaches immensely contributed to the survivor's memorable\ntrauma. While Oberheuser and Grese were not unique in their\nparticipation as there were many disturbing Nazi women, they\nwere still believed to be remarkably ruinous.\nWhile we can learn about Oberheuser and Grese because\nthey were found and put on trial, it must be considered that there\nwere many more like these women who managed to escape 289\njustices\u2019 grip. These women had extensive scope for action\nconsidering the male-oriented hierarchy in concentration camps\nand the killing center, and rather than taking culpability, they took\nadvantage of their situation to try and prove themselves and break\nthrough the glass ceiling. Learning about these Nazi women was a\nchilling reminder that women can be just as cruel as men and even\ntry to outdo their male counterparts, no matter the cost. The\nvictims' voices cannot be forgotten, but, perhaps, to understand\nwhy we must understand them. Studying and remembering the\nHolocaust is of dire importance as understanding the past is key to\nchanging the future. It is important to remember that gender cannot\nbe ignored when analyzing the heinousness that occurred during\nthe Third Reich\u2019s attempt to eradicate European Jewry and other\nmarginalized communities.\nReferences\nAdele-Marie, W.

On November 30 and December 8, 1941, a total 26,000\npeople were murdered in the outskirts of Riga. Of these 25,000\nwere Latvian citizens and about 1,000 were brought in from the\nThird Reich. Please (WARNING: graphic textual descriptions)\nread: Remembering Rumbula\nAs Adam Yunis illustrates in his critical essay, accounts\nand studies from the East were obstructed by the emergent Cold\nWar. Eastern survivors that I have spoken with bolster the\nconclusions that Yunis draws in that the designation of a survivor\nfor those in the East was complicated and varied from their\nwestern counterparts. 294\nThe Memory of the Holocaust on the Nazi Occupied Territory\nof the Former Soviet Union\nAdam Yunis\nThe Nazi Holocaust in the East was one of the most\ndestructive events in history and the memory of this time continues\nto impact Soviet survivors and global politics. The pace of memory\nand remembrance was impacted greatly by post war social and\npolitical conditions, creating a silence that was not present in\nCentral and Western Europe. The lack of access to Soviet records,\nthe fall of the Soviet Union and a wave of Jewish immigrants in\nthe 1980s and 1990s to the U.S. all contributed to a greater\nrecognition of the Holocaust by Bullets in the East. Many Soviet\nHolocaust survivors did not consider themselves survivors, and the\nUSSR generally did not recognize the separate experience of Jews\ndue to a focus on the uniform suffering of the Soviet people. The\nlack of research into the details of Nazi operations in the USSR has\nbeen confronted by several groups that seek to shed light on places\nof mass murder. This essay will discuss the memory of the 295\nHolocaust in the former Soviet Union and recent efforts to both\nrecognize Jewish suffering during the war and research sites of\nmass killing.\nThe memory of the Holocaust in the former Soviet Union\nhas developed at a slower pace than in Central and Western Europe\ndue to several factors to be discussed. During the existence of the\nSoviet Union, Soviet authorities cultivated their own interpretation\nof historical memory which aimed to dismiss existing ethnic\ntension, conceal the effects of the Soviet invasion of Eastern\nEurope in 1939, and sought to replace the memories of individuals\nand communities with the narrative of the new imagined\ncommunity-the Soviet people. The fall of the Soviet Union, a wave\nof Jewish immigration to the United States and Israel, and\nsignificant increase in research into the Holocaust in the FSU\n(Former Soviet Union) all contributed to a greater understanding of\nthe Holocaust by Bullets and recognition of Soviet survivors. This\nessay will discuss the memory of the Holocaust on the Nazi\noccupied territory of the former Soviet Union and recent efforts to\nboth document and recognize the Soviet Jewish experience. 296\nMemory of the Holocaust in the Soviet Union, 1945-1991\nWhile decades of silences would follow, immediate\nwartime and post-war research was done to compile experiences of\nSoviet Jewry under Nazism. Chief among this was the work done\nby Soviet Jewish novelist Ilya Ehrenburg and Soviet Jewish war\ncorrespondent Vasilij Grossman. Grossman interviewed Jewish\nsurvivors as well as non-Jewish wartime residents about the fate of\nSoviet Jews and documented the liberation of Treblinka and\nMajdanek, publishing some of the first accounts of Nazi killing\ncenters. The material intended to form The Black Book: The\nRuthless Murder of Jews by German-Fascist Invaders Throughout\nthe Temporarily Occupied Regions of the Soviet Union and in the\nDeath Camps of Poland during the War 1941-1945, to be\npublished in 1946 in Russian and Yiddish.\nThe correspondence between Grossman and Ehrenburg is\ntelling, as it predicts future Soviet treatment of the Holocaust.\nGrossman observed that the word \u2018Jews\u2019 was used too frequently\nand suggested to avoid repetition of this word in order not to\nirritate the reader and to substitute it with general terms like 297\n\u2018people or \u2018civilians\u2019\u2019 (Baranova, 2015). On October 7th, 1947, the\ndecision was made by Department for Propaganda of the Central\nCommittee of the Soviet Communist party that since the book\n\u201ccontains grave political errors\u201d, it \u201cmay not be published.\u201d All\ncopies were sent to storage warehouses where they were destroyed\nin 1948 (Baranova, 2015). Thus, because it singled out Jewish\nsuffering and because it questioned the image of friendship of\npeoples in Soviet society, the major and probably the only post-\nwar work that treated the Holocaust in the Soviet Union as a\nseparate Jewish phenomenon was never published in the USSR.\nCopies survived and were later published in Yiddish, English and\neventually in Russian after the fall of the Soviet Union.\nThe immediate post war Stalinist censorship also prevented\nthe publishing of works of Soviet Jewish photographers who were\non the front lines documenting the Nazi Holocaust with the Soviet\nArmy. Professor of Jewish History at the University of Colorado,\nDavid Shneer, has recently written Through Soviet Jewish Eyes\n(2010), which published for the first time many photographs taken\nby an elite group of two dozen Soviet-Jewish photographers who 298\nwere charged by the Stalinist state to document the Holocaust and\nother crimes against Soviet citizens. An important work in the\nstudy of Soviet Jewry, it removes Jews and their relationship to the\nSoviet Union from a lens of repression and silence, and instead\nshows Soviet Jewish agency in their own struggle and in their\ncontributions to building the Soviet Union and documenting Nazi\ncrimes. Post-war Stalinist antisemitism had the effect of silencing\nthe patriotic contributions Jews had made to the Soviet Union, and\nfuture work must continue to recognize that the Jewish struggle to\ndocument Nazi crimes was also a part of a larger patriotic\ncontribution that Soviet Jews made during the war.\nSoviet historiography in the post war decades that followed\nthe Second World War did not treat the Holocaust as a separate,\nJewish event and fate. The event was not erased from official\nSoviet history but adapted within the confines of the post war\nideological framework. Soviet martyrdom emphasized a universal\nsuffering and the defeat of the racist and murderous Nazism\n(Baranova, 2015). Discouraging any emphasis of the Jewish origin 299\nof Nazi policies became standard in Soviet history and in public\ncommemorations.\nAmerican Jewish scholar Zvi Gitelman (1991) in his article\n\u201cPolitics and the Historiography of the Holocaust in the Soviet\nUnion\u201d claims that a survey of Soviet literature reveals that there\nwas no uniform treatment of the Holocaust in the Soviet Union.\nSome works do admit and describe a Jewish tragedy, others\ndiscuss some parts, while others prefer to refrain from any national\nand ethnic origin of victims. Unity among all Soviet people meant\nnot interrogating the recent past. This was the goal of Soviet policy\nafter the Second World War. The Soviets authorities viewed any\nnationalist movement as a threat to its control. To create a Soviet\nidentity, this unifying experience of suffering played a large role in\ncreating a feeling of community among all Soviet people.\nTherefore, recognition of a separate experience, a Jewish tragedy,\none that involved local collaboration and capitalized on native\nantisemitism, did not fit Soviet postwar interests, meaning it could\nnot exist. 300\nAntisemitism certainly played a role in Soviet treatment of\nthe Holocaust, but not addressing how the Holocaust occurred in\nthe western territories-Western Belarus, Western Ukraine,\nLithuania, Latvia, areas briefly annexed by the Soviet Union from\n1939-41, also had the practical concern of suppressing ethnic\ntension. The reluctance to address collaboration in accounts of\nNazi massacres is reflective of Soviet acknowledgment of existing\nantisemitism among its population. Soviet authorities tried to avoid\nany discussion that could explain why so many people in Soviet\nsociety were so inflicted by antisemitism and hostile to the existing\nSoviet regime of \u201839-41, that they participated in Nazi massacres.\nBy doing this, Soviet authorities suppressed the fact that the\noccupation of Eastern Europe and the Baltic by the Soviet Union\nfrom \u201839-41 created an enormous amount of antisemitism, local\npopulations scapegoating the Jews for their problems and\nassociating Jews with the new communist regime. For Soviet\nauthorities it was better not to get into the details of how the\nHolocaust occurred in the Soviet Union, to assign the killing of 301\nJews to the Nazis as a part of their greater policy for Europe which\ninvolved cruelty and killings of every Soviet ethnic group.\nThis is not to say that there were not efforts by individuals\nin the Soviet Union to commemorate the Holocaust. The most\nfamous of these efforts was the controversy over the ravine at Babi\nYar. Babi Yar was a site near Kiev, where 33,771 Jews were killed\nin 2 days -September 29-30, and where 100,000 people would be\nmurdered. When the war ended, no monument was placed there to\ncommemorate this event and there were plans to turn this site into\na park and a stadium.\nSoviet writer Evgeniy Evtushenko published the famous\npoem \u201c\u0411\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0439 \u042f\u0440\u201d [Babi Yar]. The poem spoke not only of Jews\nmurdered in Babi Yar but of Soviet mistreatment of Jews. Famous\nSoviet composer Dmitry Shostakovich included the poem in his\nSymphony No. 13 (Lebovic, 2017). These artistic and musical\npieces by Soviet intellectuals attracted world attention to the\nproblem of Soviet remembrance of the Holocaust and revealed that\nSoviet society was far from free of antisemitism. It also\nimportantly demonstrated that some intellectuals were 302\nuncomfortable with the lack of commemoration of Jewish\nsuffering in the war. Finally, public pressure resulted in a memorial\nplaced at Babi Yar, but the inscription reads: \u201chere in 1941- 1943,\nthe German fascist invaders executed more than 100.000 citizens\nof Kiev and prisoners of war\u201d. Despite the fact that more than 30\npercent of victims killed by the Nazis in Babi Yar were Jews, as\nwell as the fact that over one million Ukrainian Jews were\nmurdered in the Holocaust by the Nazis and Ukrainian militias,\nthere was no reference to a Jewish tragedy.\nThe Fall of Communism\nThe fall of the Soviet Union brought about many changes\nto Holocaust research and memory in the former Soviet Union. As\nimmigration restrictions began to loosen, there was a large increase\nin Jewish immigration to the United States and Israel during the\n80s and 90s. This played a crucial role in the growth of recognition\nof Soviet survivors. Soviet Jews who had survived the Holocaust\ndid not find an environment in the Soviet Union that was receptive\nto any recognition of the tragedy of Soviet Jewry. Antisemitism\nremained a constant force for Jews in the Soviet Union in the post- 303\nwar period, as religion of any kind was actively suppressed in the\nSoviet territories. Mentioning the Jewish roots of the tragedy of\nthat was the Holocaust by Bullets was not advisable, and for many\nsecond-generation survivors, children who fled or hid with their\nparents, they grew up not knowing the details of their survival. The\nsituation of Jews is further complicated by the fact that they were\nliving in areas where local people took part in the killing of Soviet\nJews. This created a prominent sentiment that it was best to move\non and not bring up any history that could hurt their current\nsituation. Upon immigration to the United States and Israel, there\ncame opportunities for Jewish survivors from the USSR to finally\ncome out and speak about their experiences.\nThe 1990s saw an increase in Holocaust documentation,\norganizations like the Shoah foundation recorded survivor\ntestimony in the United States, this coincided with the immigration\nof Soviet survivors whose stories had never been fully recognized\nor told. Many recent Jewish immigrants to the U.S. did not view\nthemselves as survivors, as the dominant view in the latter half of\nthe 20th century associated a survivor with someone who had 304\nsurvived a Nazi concentration camp. This perception of the\nHolocaust and survivors was harmful as it does not account for\nthose who hid, fled, or even fought against the Nazis. With the fall\nof the Soviet Union, new opportunities for researchers and\nhistorians developed to explore the Holocaust by Bullets, as Soviet\narchives were opened, and historians and researchers could freely\nwork in areas of mass killing. This combination of new historical\nresearch of the Holocaust in the FSU, and the awakening of\nmemory by Soviet Jews with the help of American Jewish\norganizations allowed for greater recognition and publication of\nthe brutality of Nazi and their collaborators\u2019 actions.\nIt also allowed for Soviet survivors to receive recognition\nfor their suffering and be thought of as Holocaust survivors, their\nindividual and familial stories of survival under the most horrible\nconditions documented by historical institutions and NGOs. This\nhelped in the creation of a Soviet Jewish survivor identity for those\nnow living abroad.\nPolitics of Memory 305\nA contentious politics of memory developed in the newly\ncreated states after the fall of the USSR. With independence from\nthe USSR came a new issue of how these states would\ncommemorate their history. Ukrainian, Latvian, Belarusian,\nEstonian involvement in the Holocaust is generally not recognized\nby their respective governments, and public memorials of the\nHolocaust have created political or social problems. The question\nof the local population\u2019s collaboration with the Nazis remains the\nmost problematic issue. This issue arose during the 2014-onging\nconflict in Eastern Ukraine, where some Ukrainian militia groups\nand protesters evoked Nazi imagery, tattoos and uniforms in their\nrebellion.\nMany celebrated Stephen Bandera, founder of the OUN B,\nan organization that collaborated with Nazi Germany and that\nmurdered thousands of Jews as well as perpetrated a brutal ethnic\ncleansing campaign against Poles in Eastern Galicia, killing\nbetween 50,000 and 100,000 (Snyder, 2003). The OUN B and\nBandera\u2019s Ukrainian ultra-nationalism ideology have remained a\nconstant force on the Ukrainian far right. 306\nThe cycle then begins of Russian propaganda claiming that\nthere is a broad sympathy to Neo Nazism in Ukraine, which\nprevents Ukrainian society from addressing the Ukrainian far right\nand their history, as they do not want to feed into Russian\npropaganda. Russian nationalism has also been on a dramatic rise,\nwith a mythical version of Russia\u2019s history at its core. History\nremains a constant political issue in the states of the former Soviet\nUnion.\nOn one hand, progress has evidently been made in\ncomparison with the Soviet era and the years of Perestroika. On the\nother hand, public discourse often remains either hostile or\nuninformed about what took place. Significant progress remains in\nthe former Soviet Union for Holocaust remembrance, as the recent\nwar and unrest in Ukraine has shown a weaponization of history on\nboth sides of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\nRecent Research into the Holocaust by Bullets\nState run organizations and NGOs emerged after the fall of\nthe FSU that now document and research the Holocaust in the\nformer Soviet Union. This essay will focus on the work of Father 307\nPatrick Debois. Debois was the grandson of a French soldier who\nhad been deported the Nazi prison camp Rava-Ruska, located on\nthe Ukrainian-Polish border (Desbois, 2008). This area has a\nparticularly brutal war history, the Holocaust and other ethnic\nbased killings still haunt the region. After being ordained in 1986,\nDebois worked with the Jewish community of France in a variety\nof roles facilitating relations between the Catholic and Jewish\ncommunities, eventually serving nationally as the secretary of the\nFrench conference of Bishops for Relations with the Jewish\ncommunity from 1999 to 2016.\nDue to his grandfather\u2019s experiences and silence about the\nHolocaust, Debois developed an intense interest in the Holocaust,\nstarting from childhood. In 2002 he travelled to Ukraine to visit\nwhere his father was imprisoned and to pay his respects to the\nJewish victims. Upon arrival he did not see a marking or\ncommemoration to the victims of the Holocaust in Ukraine.\nDesbois knew that before World War II more than 15,000 Jews\nhad lived in the town, but when he asked to see where they had\nbeen murdered, the mayor brushed him off and said no one knew 308\nanything about it. \"How could more than 10,000 Jews be killed in\nthe village and nobody knows?\" he says. \"I knew I needed to find\nout what happened. So, I came back two times, three times, four\ntimes to Rawa-Ruska. And then the mayor lost the election, and a\nnew mayor was elected, much less Soviet\u201d (Breger, 2011). Upon\nreturning the new mayor led Desbois to a forest, a place of mass\nkilling, where 50 elderly men and women gathered to tell of their\nexperiences witnessing the Holocaust.\nThey gave detailed testimony to the murder of the Jewish\ncommunity in their city. This testimony had never been given\nbefore, and Desbois saw an opportunity for a larger scale project.\nDesbois realized what a wealth of information on the Holocaust\nwas available on the Holocaust in Eastern Europe if you\ninterviewed the last witnesses and marked sites of killing. In order\nto right the historical wrong of neglecting areas of mass killing,\nDesbois helped found Yahad-In Unum, combing the Hebrew\nword-Yahad, meaning \u201ctogether,\u201d with the Latin phrase In Unum,\nmeaning \u201cin one.\u201d 309\nThe global organization collects eyewitness testimony and\nforensic evidence about the mass killing of Jews and Roma in\nUkraine, Russia, Belarus, Lithuania, Poland, Moldova and\nRomania between 1941 and 1944. Local contemporary witnesses\nare interviewed about the mass shootings that occurred near their\nhomes and the mass graves are located and documented. Desbois\n(2008) estimates that there are no less than 1 million victims buried\nin 1,200 graves in Ukraine. Yahad-In Unum\u2019s work is crucial to\ncounter claims of Holocaust deniers who use lack of official\ndocumentation to makes claims on the validity of Holocaust\nevidence. Yahad-In Unum has received widespread praise among\nHolocaust institutions and their work has documented at this\nmoment 1,843 execution sites.\nYahad-In Unum hopes by exposing evidence of these\nlesser-known crimes against humanity, they are bringing closure to\nthe memory of the victims. A forward-thinking organization, they\nhope to spread awareness of the need to recognize and denounce\nthe ongoing epidemic of global genocide. Yahad-In Unum and\nPatrick Desbois have also worked to document the Yazidi 310\ngenocide in Iraq committed by the Islamic State. As time passes, it\nseems that NGOs will be some of the leading institutions that seek\nto properly commemorate and document the Holocaust by Bullets\nin the former Soviet Union. Father Debois and his team have\nrecently interviewed Chicago Holocaust survivors from the FSU\nwho witnessed or learned about the killings of their families.\nThe Soviet Jewish Experience\nSignificant progress has been made in the documentation\nof killing sites and in remembrance of Soviet Jewish victims of the\nHolocaust and in recognition of the survivors from the USSR. This\nwork has had the unfortunate burden of beginning just as the last\nsurvivor and witness generations reach old age. Only since the fall\nof the Soviet Union have Soviet Jews gained an opportunity to tell\ntheir stories of survival and commemorate their family members\nmurdered by the Nazis. Crucial to this development has been the\nwork of individuals and organizations to recognize the separate\nexperiences of Jews during the war, and document and research the\nHolocaust by Bullets in Eastern Europe. During the post war years\nof the USSR, Soviet authorities prevented the recognition of a 311\nseparate Jewish experience during the Second World War due to\npolitical concerns and antisemitism. The fall of the USSR allowed\nfor Jewish immigration to places where some found communities\nmore welcome to hearing their stories of persecution.\nThere is still much work to do in gaining wider\nrecognition for Soviet Jewish survivors. Local to Chicago,\nHolocaust Community Services is an organization that seeks to\npublicize and educate on the Holocaust in the former Soviet Union\nand document the stories of Soviet Jewish Holocaust survivors that\nnow live in the United States. Abroad, the politics of memory of\nthe Holocaust in the former Soviet states often remains\ncontentious, with patriotic celebration of history often turning into\na whitewashing of collaboration with the Nazis. The Holocaust by\nBullets, and those Soviet Jews who survived must be a crucial part\nof any narrative of the Holocaust. The final generation of Soviet\nsurvivors are now in old age, many children or teenagers during\nthe war. Their memories of their families murdered by the Nazis,\nand often of their parents who never got a chance to speak about\ntheir survival, offer some of our last personal connections to the 312\nvictims of the Holocaust. Their stories must be listened to and\ndocumented. Soviet survivor Yakov Mozyrsky was interviewed\nonly recently on his wartime experience as a Jewish child. His\nfather had fought with the Soviet army for the complete duration of\nthe war. He recounts:\nIn October 1945 Papa was discharged and came back to\nTimashevo to find us, and together we returned to Kiev. I\nremember that we walked along poorly lit railroads to the\nhouse in which we lived before the war. No one knew\nwhat to expect. I stumbled and fell on a rail. When Dad\npicked me up and lifted me up high, I saw tears in his\neyes. These were the eyes of a man who had gone\nthrough the entire war, who had seen blood and death,\nwho was wounded several times, and who now simply\ngot scared for his son. These eyes I would never forget.\n(Mozyrsky, 2020)\nFor this last generation of Soviet survivors, the memories of the\nwar never left, we should cherish the opportunity to learn from and\nrecognize the Soviet Jewish experience. 313\nFurther Resources\nBooks\nThrough Soviet Jewish Eyes: Photography, War and the Holocaust\nby David Shneer\nNever Heard Never Forget produced by Holocaust Community\nServices.

Bodies were\nthen incinerated or dumped in mass graves. In one such grave\noutside the city of Kharkov, a ravine called Drobitsky Yar, were\napproximately fifteen thousand Jews who were murdered on Dec.\n15, 1941. Among them were my grandmother Dvoyra, aunt Sonya\nand cousin Riva. My father also died. Heavy fighting took place in\nthe region near Kharkov, the Ukraine\u2019s second largest city. Control\nof the area shifted four times before the Red Army gained control\nfor the last time with Operation Rumyantsev on Aug. 23, 1943. It\nwas later that year that the Soviets put three captured Germans and\none Soviet collaborator on trial. Unlike the later Nuremburg trials,\nin which war criminals were prosecuted for \u201ccrimes against\npeace,\u201d the Kharkov trial, while not specifying the victims as\nJewish citizens, conducted the proceedings against the criminals\nspecifically for their part in killing Soviet citizens. Multiple Nazi\narmy and police units perpetrated the killing of Jews and others 320\nusing both guns and carbon monoxide death vans. Death squads\nwould follow the Nazi forces in order to gather and kill Soviet\nJews in newly-conquered territory. Once Nazi forces tested carbon\nmonoxide in their operations, the number of vans in use increased\nthroughout the Kharkov region. By the end of fighting, Soviet\nJewish writer Vassily Grossman described the scene at the time\nthat there were no Jews left as every single one had been\nmurdered. The defendants in the Kharkov trial were charged under\nboth international and Soviet law. The Soviets used the Moscow\nDeclaration, in which Allies had agreed that war criminals would\nbe tried for their crimes in the countries where their atrocities\noccurred. The Kharkov trial was the first trial of Germans by any\nAllied country and the only trial to take place before Germany\u2019s\nunconditional surrender in May 1945. During the trial, the\ndefendants pleaded guilty to their crimes, but evidence was still\noffered to both satisfy the court of their guilt and give context for\ntheir sentence. The court sentenced the defendants to death. A\nreference consulted for the above was Bazyler, M., & Rose Gold,\nK. (2012).

We examine\narchitecture with Nathan Harpaz, then Holocaust biographical film\nwith Phyllis Lassner, and finally music in the Holocaust with\nSusan Eischeid. Examining the Holocaust through these unique\nlenses provide a deeper understanding of the many facets of\nHolocaust studies.\nArchitect Alexander Levy: Berlin \u2013 Tel Aviv \u2013\nAuschwitz\nNathan Harpaz\nWhen I was working on my book Zionist Architecture and\nTown Planning: The Building of Tel Aviv (1919 - 1929), I found in\nthe intriguing life of architect Alexander Levy, who is one of the\ncentral figures in this book, several connections to my family\u2019s\nhistory. Levy and my maternal grandfather Moshe Yehuda Kaplan\nacquired their artistic education in Berlin, both got involved with\nZionism and arrived in Tel Aviv during the same year (1920), and\nboth struggled financially trying to pursue their professions. My\ngrandfather stayed in Tel Aviv despite the difficulties, while Levy 323\nreturned to Europe and, like my paternal grandparents Sarah and\nIsiah Fenster and my uncle Max Fenster from Vienna, perished in\nAuschwitz. This essay is an homage to architect Alexander Levy\nand his tragic saga. Levy offered his services to the Zionist\nOrganization in Berlin, the hub of Zionism at that time, during a\ncrucial time after World War I, when a new hope for massive\nimmigration to the Land of Israel was expected. Ironically, Levy,\nwho attempted to build an advanced shelter for future persecuted\nJews in then Palestine, returned to Europe after his failed career to\nbe victimized by the Nazi regime.\nArchitect Alexander Levy (1883-1942) expressed interest\nin Zionism after finishing his studies in architecture and starting\nwork for a building company in Berlin in 1907. Levy followed the\nidea of re-establishing the Jewish state, serving as a shelter or\nrefuge to Jews escaping from antisemitism. In 1908, he offered his\nservices as an architect to Arthur Ruppin (1876-1943), then the\ndirector of the Palestine office of the Zionist Organization in Jaffa.\nIn November of 1912, Levy prepared four different housing plans\nfor new immigrants in Palestine, and a year later, he proposed to 324\norganize an exhibition on housing to be displayed during the\neleventh Congress in Vienna. In the same year, he also sent several\nproposals for building projects, including the port of Jaffa,\nprototypes for residential units, housing for new Yemenite Jewish\nimmigrants, a plan for a hotel, and a new approach to building\nmaterials. None of Levy\u2019s proposals were accepted by the Zionist\nOrganization (Meyer-Maril, 1994).\nIn 1913, Levy applied for two positions in Palestine offered\nby the Zionist Organization, but he failed to obtain either of them.\nThe position of building engineer in Palestine was given to Richard\nMichel, and the position of the director of the technical department\nin Palestine was given to Wilhelm Hecker. Levy sent an angry\nletter to Ruppin, but he still proposed cooperation in planning\nworking-class housing. Ruppin, in his reply, explained to Levy that\nthe difficult conditions in Palestine prevented his office from\nhiring architects, and he encouraged Levy to move to Palestine and\npractice as a private architect (Meyer-Mari,1994).\nIn the spring of 1919, with the support of the Association of\nJewish Architects and Engineers, Levy founded a new 325\norganization, the Association of the Builders of the Land of Israel.\nThe goal of the Association of the Builders of the Land of Israel\nwas to resolve the problems of building and housing in Palestine,\naccompanying the anticipated mass immigration of Jews to the\nland of Israel. In May of 1919, the association organized a\nconference on future building in Palestine, including an exhibition\nof plans and models of housing solutions. The ideas introduced in\nthe exhibition were published with plans and photos by Alexander\nLevy in Davis Trietsch\u2019s magazine Volk und Land. Levy\u2019s essay in\nthis magazine titled \u201cOn Building and Housing\u201d spread over four\nissues between September and November 1919. The majority of\nthe text and a portion of the illustrations for Levy's future book\nwas published in this magazine.\nIn May of 1920, Levy proposed another plan to the Builder\nCompany in London to work together on the foundation of a\nquarry, a cement factory, a wood workshop, and machinery shops\nto assist with the building of 1000 small dwellings per year. This\nplan was also rejected. In the same year, Levy continued to\npromote his ideas and recruit architects to the Association of the 326\nBuilders of the Land of Israel, and in Berlin, he published a 56-\npage booklet entitled Building and Housing in New Palestine.\nThe publication of Alexander Levy\u2019s Building and Housing\nin New Palestine is the most comprehensive proposal for\ninexpensive and rapid building construction in the early days of the\nZionist movement. It meticulously and methodologically reviews\nthe most advanced European theories and studies relevant to the\ntopic and concludes with concrete and realistic recommendations\nfor implementation. The plan covers such topics as the company's\nrole in initiating and executing building construction, the crucial\navailability of materials, the presentation of different types of\naccommodations, and the utilization of standardization of materials\nand labor techniques.\nThe historical rationale for Levy\u2019s plan was in the new\npolitical arena that emerged after World War I: the end of the\nOttoman occupation of Palestine and the beginning of the British\nmandate. In the publication, Levy expressed his hope that soon the\nBritish administration would permit a large number of Jewish\nimmigrants to settle in Palestine, and therefore a detailed and 327\npractical plan would be needed to construct mass housing. This\nprediction of mass Jewish immigration to Palestine was triggered\nby the Balfour Declaration of 1917, where the British government\nrecognized the rights of the Jewish people to establish their\nhomeland in Palestine, and it was intensified later when the British\ngoverned the region after the war. Levy\u2019s plan was part of massive\npost-war publications that dealt with the expectations of a \u201cNew\nPalestine.\u201d\nLevy based his plan on current European concepts, and, as\na scientist, he presented data from the field, theories of prominent\nexperts, and then practical conclusions. Like a classical technocrat,\nLevy filled his writing with plenty of details like statistics, costs,\nand dimensions to give his plan credibility and practicality, but he\nignored significant obstacles that might derail his proposal.\nFrom a personal perspective, Levy demonstrated\nthroughout his publication integrity and truthfulness through his\ncomments, and sometimes he revealed outspoken criticism. He\nstated that laymen led current Jewish construction in Palestine\nwithout any skill and very few notable achievements. Furthermore, 328\nhe labeled the administrators in charge of building construction in\nPalestine \u201cprimitive\u201d and lacking in business skills due to\nphilanthropic dependency and patronage. Ironically, with his blunt\nattitude, Levy was a freethinker himself and an unconventional\nscholar, which might illuminate his difficulties with promoting his\nplan to the Zionist Organization during his activities in Berlin and\nlater when he worked in Tel Aviv.\nAlexander Levy finally paid attention to Dr. Ruppin\u2019s\nadvice, and he arrived in Palestine in 1920, the same year that he\npublished his book. Levy came to Tel Aviv, together with Nadja\nStrasser (1871-1955), a writer concentrating on socialism and\nfeminism in a Jewish context. They met each other in Berlin after\nStrasser studied at Vienna University (Archive of the International\nInstitute of Social History).\nUpon arrival to Tel Aviv, Levy founded the building\ncompany Kedem (Orient) based on the same idea as the\nAssociation of the Builders of the Land of Israel in Berlin. Levy\nconverted the Bella Vista Hotel in Jaffa into the company\u2019s\nheadquarters, including a department for public works, a 329\ndepartment for architectural design, a laboratory for examining\nlocal and imported building materials, and carpentry and metal\nworkshops. The movie hall of the former hotel became a drawing\nroom and exhibition space, and the employees of the company\nlived in other rooms. The company\u2019s early projects included the\nconstruction of roads in Tel Aviv and the building of the\nexperimental agricultural station near the Herzliya Hebrew High\nSchool in 1921, a project initiated by the Zionist leader Otto\nWarburg who wrote the introduction to Levy\u2019s publication in\nBerlin (Meyer-Maril, 1994).i\nOne of the early experiments with the modern-oriental style\nin Tel Aviv was conducted by Alexander Levy. His first major\nprivate commissioned project was the residence for Menachem\nUssishkin (1863-1941), the Zionist leader and head of the Jewish\nNational Fund.\nAt the peak of the cooperation between the Bezalel Art\nAcademy and Tel Aviv architects in 1924, Alexander Levy\nparticipated in an exhibition of Tel Aviv architecture at Bezalel in\nJerusalem. One of the exhibition's goals was to encourage the use 330\nof Bezalel\u2019s artistic ceramic tiles in Tel Aviv. That event also\nfacilitated the development of a personal relationship between\nLevy and Boris Schatz, the founder and head of the academy, and\nthey began to correspond with each other(Meyer-Maril, 1994).\nDespite the close relations with Schatz Levy, inspiration from\nBezalel was manifested only in his few early designs.\nIronically, Alexander Levy, who rejected eclecticism and\nspoke out against \u201cfa\u00e7ade artists\u201d in his Berlin publication, became\none of the most eclectic architects in Tel Aviv. He designed the\nKleisler house as a neo-classical building decorated with pilasters,\ncement reliefs, and even Greek metopes and triglyphs. In the\nLifshitz House, Levy kept the classical tradition of rustic stone on\nthe ground floor, and he added cement-made classical\nornamentation throughout the fa\u00e7ade. In the same year, Levy\ndesigned the Ussishkin House utilizing a modern oriental style, and\nin the Schlossberg House, he attached oriental arches to a western\nEuropean building.\nThe peak of the eclectic trend in the architecture of Tel\nAviv in the mid-1920s can be noticed in the exotic building that 331\nAlexander Levy designed for Morris Bloch on the intersection of\nthree streets. The three-story building was built on a lot shaped like\na triangle and featured arched porches on each floor. The stepped\nroof in the front of the building granted the structure the name\n\u201cThe Pagoda House.\u201d\nAfter his arrival to Tel Aviv, Levy attempted to re-establish\nthe settlement company that he led in Berlin, and through its\nactivities, he tried to implement his ideas as presented in his book.\nAfter several projects under his company, Kedem, Levy struggled\nfinancially and gradually compromised his ideal architectural\nconcepts. This early monetary difficulty can be seen in his\nadvertisement posted in the Haaretz newspaper in 1921: \u201cOne who\nis willing to invest money in the purpose of gaining decent profits\nshould build houses in Tel Aviv by the architect Alexander Levy,\nthe author of the book Building and Housing in New Palestine.\u201d In\nthis advertisement, Levy departs from his idealistic approach to\nbuilding in Palestine and tries to convince potential clients to\ninitiate building construction for investment. The illustration of a\nplain functional building in this advertisement is not a typical 332\ndesign for Levy\u2019s buildings in Tel Aviv at that time. The majority\nof Levy\u2019s designs were vastly eclectic, except his 1924 renovation\nof a house on Rothschild Boulevard.\nIn the same year that Alexander Levy designed one of the\nmost eclectic and picturesque buildings in Tel Aviv (the Pagoda\nHouse, 1925), he bitterly criticized the state of the city\u2019s\narchitecture:\nWhat we need now is a system and not temporality. Tel\nAviv must turn into a city, organic structure, and not a\nchaos of streets and buildings. Tel Aviv also must become\na city of the Land of Israel and not the new Pinsk [a town in\nBelarus] \u2026 Even the greatest friend of Tel Aviv would not\nbe able to claim that the construction of the city was based\non a serious principle. On a vast area of the city there is not\none awkward street that can be deemed rational. (Levy,\n1925)\nLevy\u2019s statement on the chaotic and irrational architectural design\nof Tel Aviv is another example of the gap between his desired, 333\nideal concepts and the gloomy reality of his inability to elevate the\ncity to a professional and advanced level.\nDespite a relatively successful career in the early 1920s,\nand with the decline of building in Tel Aviv in the late 1920s,\narchitect Alexander Levy struggled financially. His criticisms of\nthe establishment and the state of architecture in Tel Aviv raised\nhis level of frustration, and in 1927, the beginning of the economic\ncrisis, he and Nadja Strasser left Palestine and returned to Berlin.\nThree years after leaving Tel Aviv to return to Germany,\nAlexander Levy finally materialized one of his theoretical\nconcepts, and in 1930 he started a company that manufactured\nsmall, compact houses. Levy, who changed his last name to Lee,\nnamed the company \u201cLee Klienhausbau,\u201d and he displayed models\nof such houses in an exhibition in 1932, together with other\narchitects, including Walter Gropius, Bruno Taut, and Erich\nMendelsohn. As the economic crisis worsened in Germany, Levy\u2019s\ncompany prospered from the need for inexpensive\naccommodations. Unfortunately, Levy\u2019s architectural success\nlasted for only a few years, and after the rise of the Nazi regime, he 334\nand Nadja Strasser fled to France. During this time, he managed to\ndesign several buildings in Paris, and he also wrote several essays,\nincluding the \u201cHistory of Jewish Achievements.\u201d Levy, motivated\nby his past failures and frustrations, continued to criticize the\nZionist Organization on the same issues he argued about during his\ncareers in Berlin and Tel Aviv.\nCelebrated German architect Peter Behrens, whom Levy\nadmired and inspired from, was called back to Germany in 1936\nfrom the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts to teach at the Prussian\nAcademy of Fine Arts under Hitler's approval. Behrens\nparticipated in Hitler\u2019s grand urban plan for Berlin, and he worked\nunder the chief Nazi architect Albert Speer. Behrens died from a\nheart attack in the Hotel Bristol in Berlin in 1940.\nSimilarly, German architect Paul Schultze-Naumburg,\nwhom Levy appreciated in his book for his innovative concepts\nregarding the arrangement of houses, became a prominent Nazi\narchitect and artist. Schultze-Naumburg convinced Hitler to reject\nmodern architecture and to adapt classical and medieval designs. 335\nTragically, while waiting to receive a visa to the United\nStates, Alexander Levy was sent to a French detention camp, and\neventually, he was deported to Auschwitz in August of 1942. On\nthe way to the death camp Levy wrote his last postcard to Nadja\nStrasser:\nMy dear, the more we approach the realities, the less they\nare frightening. I am in the train and tolerant the ride well.\nOur friends promised me to take care of you. Everything is\nthe best in the best of these worlds, and I hope to see you\nsoon. I will write no more before Christmas. I congratulate\nyou on your birthday on September 25th. (Meyer-Maril,\n1994).\nLevy perished in Auschwitz in the same year before the arrival of\nChristmas (Meyer-Maril, 1994).\nReferences\nArchive of the International Institute of Social History,\nAmsterdam, the Netherlands. 336\nHarpaz N.

Her important essay\nreveals how the Holocaust has been represented in filmic format.\nBiographical Holocaust Films\nPhyllis Lassner\nFeature films, docudramas, and documentaries have\nbecome the most widely disseminated source of Holocaust history.\nThis essay focuses on biographical films or Biopics, that is stories\nbased on the experiences of actual individuals at the time, recorded\nin diaries during or after the war, as with memoirs, or compilations\nof autobiographical materials by others. The categories of biopics\nconsidered here are children, gender and sexuality, perpetrators,\nand resisters.\nIntroduction: Witness Testimony\nResearched focused on the Holocaust was propelled by the\ndiscovery of massive numbers of detailed written records kept by\nthe many departments and agencies of Nazi Germany\u2019s vast\nbureaucracy. Much of this documentation served as evidence\nagainst high-ranking Nazi officials at the thirteen Nuremberg trials 338\nbetween 1945 and 1949. The prosecution of these trials and later\nones also depended on other forms of evidence, such as oral\ninterrogation of the plaintiffs. While necessary for judicial reasons,\nthis focus on perpetrators offered only one side of the Holocaust. It\nwas the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem in 1960 that\ndemonstrated the crucial perspective of victims and the oral\ntestimonies of survivors to learn how the Holocaust was\nexperienced by those who were targeted for extermination by Nazi\nGermany. Despite the lapses and traumas that would affect\nsurvivors\u2019 memories, their individual testimonies have served\nmany purposes, including legal decisions, ethical judgments, and\nhistorical knowledge regarding perpetrators, the conditions of the\ncamps, forms of punishment, methods of extermination, and a wide\nvariety of resistance and attempts to escape. Individual testimony\nhas also illuminated the observations, experiences and responses of\nvictims, survivors, bystanders, and onlookers in the countless sites\nof the Nazi genocide, including the ghettoes, concentration and\nslave labor camps, killing centers, hiding places, on the run, and\nescape and rescue efforts. 339\nWritten Survivor Accounts\nIn addition to these oral testimonies, written accounts,\nmostly by survivors, have become object of intense historical and\nliterary study and a rewarding source for teaching. Written\ntestimony includes memoirs, such as Elie Wiesel\u2019s Night and\nPrimo Levi\u2019s Survival in Auschwitz, diaries, such as Anne Frank\u2019s,\nand court and transcripts of trials and interviews. It is important to\nnote that our access to written survivor testimony depends on\ntranslation from the witnesses\u2019 native languages, including\nGerman, Czech, Polish, Russian, Italian, and Yiddish. However,\neven considering inexact word choices, grammar, and written\nemphases, these sources remain crucial. Even when written\ntestimony consists only of rescued pieces of paper, as in the Oneg\nShabbos Project,51 being able to read these personal recollections\nmeans that we can closely examine the many strands of their\n51 The project was organized by Emanuel Ringelblum, a Polish Jewish\njournalist, who asked people throughout the Warsaw Ghetto to record their\nobservations and experiences as a historical record. The story is recounted by\nSamuel Kassow. 340\nmeaning, including their emotional and behavioral responses and\nintended effects on readers and the historical record. Helpfully,\nwhen written testimony is published, it is most often accompanied\nby introductions to their historical, geographical, political, and\nexperiential contexts, and by explanatory footnotes, glossaries of\ntechnical terms, maps, and on occasion, photographs.\nFilm\nThe medium that has been responsible for the most\nwidespread dissemination of Holocaust experience is film. In 1978,\nthe enormous popularity of the four-part television miniseries\nHolocaust launched widespread interest in the Nazi genocide.52\nAlthough the series was fictional and contained historical\ninaccuracies, it succeeded in depicting innocent people of all ages\nbeing brutally rounded up on November 9, 1938 in the pogrom\ncalled Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass), and being\ntransported in stifling cattle cars to ghettoes, concentration camps,\n52 An estimated 15 million households or 20 million people viewed the series,\nincluding about 50% of West German adults. 341\nand killing centers. This was a history that for most Americans had\nbeen unknown and for audiences elsewhere, had been ignored,\nneglected, or unacknowledged.\nFollowing the success of Holocaust, the number of films\ndealing with Holocaust experiences proliferated both in the United\nStates and Europe. The vast European terrain on which the\nHolocaust was perpetrated, the Nazis\u2019 myriad forms of persecution\nand murder, and various kinds of resistance, escape attempts, and\nsurvival have been translated into feature films, docudramas, and\ndocumentaries. The most popular of these films, including Steven\nSpielberg\u2019s Schindler\u2019s List (1993), Roberto Benigni\u2019s Life is\nBeautiful (1998), Roman Polanski\u2019s The Pianist (2002), and\nEdward Zwick\u2019s Defiance (2008), have drawn large audiences but\nhave also been criticized by scholars and teachers for the very\nreasons that make them popular, including suspenseful and\nsuccessful stories of heroic rescue, the will to survive against all\nodds, risky and adventurous escapes, and romance. In response to\nthese features, many scholars and teachers argue that such\nsentimental and sensational distortions of the complex characters 342\nof victims, their relationships or successful attempts to survive lead\nto misunderstanding the Holocaust. In addition to misrepresenting\na vast and complicated history, the most damaging effect of such\nexceptional stories is to give support to Holocaust deniers who\nclaim that there were far fewer than six million deaths and that\nmost were caused by disease, not Nazi perpetration.53 Therefore,\nHolocaust scholars and educators maintain that it is crucial for\nfilms to represent the Holocaust with historical accuracy.\nHolocaust film expert Laurence Baron argues that the value of\nHolocaust films is that they\nfiguratively or literally evoke a sense of the collective and\nindividual choices and historical circumstances that enabled\nHitler to persecute or liquidate millions of civilians he\ndesignated as asocial, deviant, ideological, racial, or\nreligious enemies. (2005, viii-ix)54\n53 See Deborah Lipstadt (1993).\n54 Baron (2005) is the major source for developing Holocaust film categories\nand explicating individual films within them. Other comprehensive sources 343\nThe Biopic and Its Sources\nThe primary and most prevalent source and form of\nHolocaust filmmaking has been the \u201cbiopic,\u201d that is stories based\non the experiences of actual individuals at the time, recorded in\ndiaries during or after the war, as with memoirs, or compilations of\nautobiographical materials by others. One of the first diaries to be\nadapted into a feature film was Anne Frank\u2019s, in the 1959\nproduction directed by George Stevens. With the restoration and\npublication of Anne\u2019s original, uncensored diary, the 2001 two-\npart television mini-series adapted from Melissa M\u00fcller\u2019s book\nAnne Frank: The Biography (2014) offers Anne\u2019s candid self-\nreflections about her developing sexuality and tense relationships\nwith her mother and other occupants of the Annex that her father\nOtto Frank edited out of the first published version.\nGender and Sexuality as Biopic Subjects\ninclude Loshitsky (1997), Doneson (2001), Insdorf (2003), Bartov (2005),\nHirsch (2004), Haggith (2005), 344\nSome Holocaust films dramatize aspects of the Holocaust\nthat had previously been neglected because the subject was\nassumed to be offensive or marginal or because their film style was\nconsidered less accessible for many viewers. For example, Bent\n(1997), directed by Sean Mathias, was the first feature film to\ndramatize the Nazi persecution of gays. In addition to being filmed\nin black and white and directed and acted in a stylized, non-realist\nform, it offered little action or heroism and ended on a bleak if\ndeeply felt note. Bent drew a very small audience but in the\nintervening years, since the subject of gays has become more\nmainstream in all public media, the film has gained a wide\naudience.55\nThe 1999 German film, Aim\u00e9e and Jaguar, directed by\nMax F\u00e4rberb\u00f6ck was a landmark production for several reasons.\n55 The film was based on the 1979 play of the same name by Martin Sherman,\nwho also wrote the screenplay. Bent won the Best Feature Film award in the\n1998 Torino International Gay & Lesbian Film Festival. The (1999)\ndocumentary Paragraph 175 explains Nazi laws against gay men. For further\nstudy of gay men in the Third Reich, see Seifert (2003). 345\nSet in wartime Berlin, in vividly dramatic color, the film\ndramatizes a love relationship between a German woman and a\nJewish woman. Lilly Wust is a pure Aryan Nazi whose husband is\nserving in the German army; because she is the mother of four\nAryan boys, she has been awarded the Reich\u2019s Mother\u2019s Cross.\nFelice Schragenheim is Jewish and a lesbian and therefore\nthreatened twice over. Their relationship would have been\nforbidden on several grounds, including the charge of\nrassenschande (sexual relations between an Aryan and non-\nAryan). The film was based on the book by the Austrian-Jewish\nwriter Erica Fischer, whose sources include Felice\u2019s letters and\npoems, Lilly\u2019s letters and diary, as well as interviews with Lilly\nand friends of Felice\u2019s who survived. Felice did not survive\nincarceration in Bergen-Belsen. Aim\u00e9e and Jaguar enhances our\nknowledge of the Holocaust by dramatizing one of its key 346\nelements: women\u2019s gender roles and sexual relationships under the\nThird Reich.56\nFilming the Perspective of Children in the Holocaust\nThe perspective of children during the Holocaust includes\nthose targeted for murder, those who were complicit with the\nGermans, and those who understand how despite their innocence,\nthey bear the responsibility of witnessing. All three groups are\ndepicted by French director Louis Malle in his autobiographical\nfilms Lacombe Lucien (1974) and Revoir les Enfants (Goodbye\nChildren 1987). Based on his recollections of attending a Catholic\nboarding school during the Nazi occupation of France, the film\nportrays his development from innocence to revelation as he is\nshown befriending a Jewish boy being sheltered by the priests,\nrecognizing his friend\u2019s devotion to his Jewish identity, and\nwitnessing his betrayal and capture. The film attests to the moral\n56 Studies of women in the Holocaust include Koonz (1987), Ofer and Weitzman\n(1998), Hedgepeth and Saidel (2010). 347\nresponsibility borne by all onlookers to Holocaust events,\nregardless of age or innocence.\nThe 2014 German-Polish-French film Run Boy Run,\ndirected by Pepe Danquart, is adapted from the 2000 novel Run,\nBoy, Run by Uri Orlev and is based on the life of Yoram Fridman\n(Srulik in the film), who escaped from the Warsaw Ghetto in 1942\nas German troops were rounding up its Jews. Beginning when the\nboy is eight years old, the film tracks his relentless efforts to stay\nalive throughout the rest of the war as he traipses across the Polish\ncountryside, from farm to farm, from icy winters to blistering\nsummers, encountering occasional kindness but more often, he was\ngreeted with indifference or betrayal. Like the 1991 film Europa\nEuropa, directed by Agnieszka Holland, Run Boy Run is narrated\nfrom a boy\u2019s perspective as he struggles not only to live, but to\nsave his Jewish identity as his life is threatened because of it.57\n57 On this film and fiction about boys on the run during the Holocaust, see\nLassner (2020). 348\nEuropa Europa is based on the 1989 autobiography of\nSolomon Perel (Solly and Solek in the film), a German Jewish boy\nwho on the evening of his Bar Mitzvah, escapes the deadly pogrom\nof Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass) on November 9, 1938.\nLike Srulik, Solly\u2019s attempts to conceal his Jewish identity are\nconstantly threatened because a circumcised penis would prove not\nonly their Jewish identity, but that they embody Jewish racial and\nsexual depravity. Narrated entirely from the boys\u2019 perspective,\nboth films depict the boys\u2019 struggle to retain their Jewish identity,\nwhich each boy had promised his father before escaping. Although\nSolly is saved by his successful disguise as a Nazi hero, he reveals\nthe agony of his dual identity when he tries to reconstruct his\nforeskin and then when he rides a trolley through the ghetto\nstraining for a glimpse of his parents.\nSrulik\u2019s dual identity is put to a conclusive test at the end of\nthe war when a representative of the Jewish Agency, on a mission\nto locate surviving Jewish children, finds the boy living happily at\nthe Polish farm that has sheltered him. The agent charges Srulik\nwith the responsibility of acknowledging his Jewish identity and 349\nreturning to his place in the remaining Jewish community. When\nhe is taken back to the village of his birth and peeks into the\nwindow of his father\u2019s shop, he recalls a Jewish lullaby that\ntriggers his memory and desire for a Jewish life. Both films feature\nepilogues that show Solly and Srulik as elderly, but robustly\nasserting their Jewish identities as fulfilled in their children and\ngrandchildren. Although these epilogues evoke a sense of\nsentimental nostalgia, they serve as reminders to Srulik and Solly\nand to audiences that these are moments of memorializing those\nwho were lost.58\nPerpetrators\nThe primary focus of film biopics depicting perpetrators\nhas been their leader, Adolf Hitler. And yet, as Holocaust scholar\nAlvin H. Rosenfeld (1985) argues, \u201cno representations of Hitler,\nhighbrow or low, seem able adequately to present the man or\nsatisfactorily to explain him\u201d (xx). Despite this serious\nshortcoming, Holocaust film expert Lawrence Baron (2005)\n58 \u015aliwowska (1998) presents child survivors\u2019 testimonies. 350\ndemonstrates that \u201cpublic interest in Hitler has not diminished\u201d\n(68). Some of the films representing Hitler try to account for the\nbackground that motivated his animus against the Jews and other\nvictim groups, such as The Death of Adolf Hitler (1972). Our\nHitler: A Film from Germany (1978) uses an experimental\ntechnique to acknowledge that there is no single explanation for\nHitler\u2019s character and cruel policies. As described by Baron\n(2005), Our Hitler is\nan inventive pastiche of different actors articulating Hitler\u2019s\nopinions and puppets symbolizing the myriad of personas\nGermans project onto him: the common man, the military\ngenius, the Wagnerian hero, the tragic prince. (71).\nResisters\nAlthough wartime resistance is typically considered to be\nan armed struggle, as in the example of the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto\nuprising, given the Nazis\u2019 broad reach and countless forms of\nbrutal oppression, resisters responded to their specific\ncircumstances in many different ways. Examples include secretly\nobserving the Jewish holidays, women\u2019s emotionally supportive 351\ngroups in the camps, keeping diaries to bear witness, escape\nattempts, and most famously, blowing up Crematorium four at\nAuschwitz.59 All of the films discussed above illuminate how\nsurvival in the Holocaust involved psychological as well as\nphysical endurance to resist being exterminated or to demonstrate\ntheir humanity in opposition to Nazi barbarism. Biopic films that\nillustrate various types of resistance include the following.\nOut of the Ashes (2003), based on the memoir I Was a\nDoctor in Auschwitz (2018) tells the story of Gisella Perl, a\nHungarian obstetrician who was deported to Auschwitz where\nJosef Mengele, the camp\u2019s sadistic doctor, forced her to assist him\nin his experiments. In secret, agonizing over the moral dilemma\nshe faced, she helped over a thousand women by performing\nabortions and infanticide. She made her decision knowing that\n59 In Auschwitz-Birkenau, a group of Sonderkommando, those men forced to\ndeceive prisoners into the gas chambers and who operated the ovens, enlisted\nthe help of several teenage girl prisoners to gather gunpowder. On October 7,\n1944, they succeeded in blowing up the one crematorium, but all were caught\nand executed. www.holocaustresearchproject.org/revolt/sonderevolt.html 352\notherwise, both mother and child would be murdered. Perl\nsurvived and immigrated to the United States but was accused of\nchoosing to assist Mengele. She was ultimately acquitted and\neventually made her home in Israel where she worked for many\nyears at Shaare Zedek hospital in Jerusalem.\nThe White Rose (1981) directed by Michael Verhoeven,\nand Sophie Scholl: The Final Days (2005), directed by Marc\nRothemund, dramatize the story of the student resistance group the\nWhite Rose. Dedicated to non-violence, the group was caught\ndistributing their anti-Nazi leaflets at their university. Sophie and\nher brother were declared guilty of high treason and executed in\nFebruary 1943. The film Korczak (1990), directed by Andrzej\nWajda, details the selfless heroism of another active resister,\nJanusz Korczak, the Director of a Jewish children\u2019s orphanage who\naccompanied the children to their deaths in the Warsaw Ghetto.\nHanna\u2019s War (1988), directed by Menachem Golan, is based in\npart on the diary of young Hungarian Jewish woman, Hanna\nSenesh. The film focuses on Hanna\u2019s tragic adventure of ignoring\nher orders to help fallen paratroopers behind German lines and 353\ninstead, fatefully attempting to rescue her mother in Budapest.\nHanna was arrested, tortured, and killed by the Hungarian Fascist\nregime.60\nOther films of resistance to the Third Reich include:\nWallenberg: A Hero\u2019s Story (1985), profiles the Swedish diplomat\nwho saved countless Hungarian Jews and who was arrested and\nprobably killed by the Soviets at the end of the war.\nBonhoeffer: Agent of Grace (2003), is the story of Dietrich\nBonhoeffer who was a German Protestant theologian who helped\nJews escape from Germany and took part in the plot to assassinate\nHitler. He was ultimately captured and hanged by the Nazis.\nOne of the important contributions of biographical\nHolocaust films is that their representations of actual people\nindividualize the otherwise overwhelming numbers of those who\nwere deported, tortured, and killed for no other reason than to\nsatisfy the hatred targeting their identities. Dramatizing the\ninnocence of all Holocaust victims, these films offer a varied range\n60 For further discussion, see Lawrence Baron (1999). 354\nof age groups, gender and sexual identities, national origins, and\nexperiences.

In this essay, Eischeid\npresents a short overview of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Women\u2019s\nOrchestra. Utilizing memoirs, interviews, and other archival\nresources and texts, we learn about the personnel, function,\nrepertoire, leadership, and heroes of the orchestra, all within the\ngreater context of the largest concentration and death camp of the\nThird Reich. The essay closes with the liquidation of the orchestra\nand ultimate fate of the musicians. A brief discussion about an\nongoing controversy in remembrance is included, as are recent\nwords of one of the last living survivors.\nCourage, Resilience, and Artistry in the Land of Death:\nThe Women\u2019s Orchestra of Auschwitz-Birkenau\nSusan J. Eischeid\nIn many ways, music was an essential part of the Hitler\u2019s\nregime. Music was used for propaganda, for glorification, for\ndiscipline, and for entertainment. It was also abused in profane\nways including the exploitation of musicians and composers for 360\nNazi self-aggrandizement, the facilitation of hard labor details, and\nfor lulling victims into a false sense of security before murder in\nthe gas chambers.\nAs Hitler\u2019s implementation of The Final Solution\nprogressed, music and musical activity were evident in all stages of\nthe Holocaust. Many of the ghettos and camps of the Third Reich\nhad performing groups, composers wrote songs and other music\nexpressing the circumstances in which they found themselves, and\nmusic was integrated into daily routines of discipline and death by\nNazi officials.\nAll of these things provided a means of survival for\nmusicians and, in some cases, spiritual hope. However, after the\nwar others were tortured with thoughts of guilt, dismay, and\nsorrow. The use of music at a place like Auschwitz was, for many,\nan abomination.61\nThere were varied musical activities in the Auschwitz\ncomplex in southwestern Poland, including men\u2019s orchestras in\n61 Szymon Laks, Music of Another World (Evanston, Illinois:\nNorthwestern University Press, 1989), 5. See also Zofia Cykowiak, (interviews\nwith Susan Eischeid, June 3, 2003 & May 15 2004, Krakow, Poland). 361\nAuschwitz I, Auschwitz II Birkenau, and Auschwitz III Monowitz.\nAuschwitz-Birkenau was also home to the only women\u2019s orchestra\nin the Nazi camp system.\nThe women\u2019s orchestra at Auschwitz-Birkenau was formed\nin the spring of 1943 by two high-ranking Nazi officials; SS\nHauptsturmf\u00fchrer Franz H\u00f6ssler and Oberaufseherin (Head\nOverseer) of the women\u2019s camp, Maria Mandl. Both were\ncognizant of the successful men\u2019s orchestras and believed the\nformation of a unique women\u2019s orchestra would bring them added\nstatus and respect.62\nAfter receiving permission to move ahead, recruitment\nbegan among the prison population. By early summer a nucleus of\n20 musicians had been formed and a conductor named Zofia\nCzajkowska appointed. Over the next several months performers\nwere added as the orchestra increased in size and status. At its\n62 Zofia Cykowiak, \u201cZarys historii kobiecej orkiestry w O\u015bwi\u0119cimiu-\nBrzezinka\u201d (An Outline History of the Women\u2019s Orchestra in O\u015bwi\u0119cim-\nBrzezinka), Krakow, 1985, nr rejestracyjny 44527, Pa\u0144stwowe Muzuem\nAuschwitz-Birkenau w O\u015bwi\u0119cimiu (APMO).

At first, the orchestra\nstruggled. Most of the musicians were young and inexperienced,\nmany teenagers. Although Czajkowska had provided a starting\npoint, she was not a particularly inspired artist and initial concerts\nwere not of high quality.64\nThe struggles of playing under the appalling conditions and\nstresses of the death camp and daily seeing arriving transports and\nmass murder on a heretofore inconceivable scale, made the\nproduction of beautiful music almost impossible for the young\nmusicians. To add to the stress, everyone knew that if the level of\nperformance did not improve, all could be re-assigned to hard\nlabor or to death.\n63 Helena Dunicz Niwi\u0144ska, One of the Girls in the Band (O\u015bwi\u0119cim,\nPoland: Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, 2014), 171-176.\n64 Eischeid, Susan. 2016. The Truth about Fania F\u00e9nelon and the\nWomen\u2019s Orchestra of Auschwitz-Birkenau. London: Palgrave Macmillan. 7. 363\nThe savior of the orchestra arrived in the person of a\nwoman named Alma Ros\u00e9. Ros\u00e9 was an established artist,\nconductor and virtuoso violinist who had been deported into the\nAuschwitz I camp. She came from a prominent family of\nmusicians \u2013 her father was the respected violinist Arnold Ros\u00e9 and\nher uncle, the esteemed composer Gustav Mahler. Mandl was\nnotified of Alma\u2019s presence and arranged to have her transferred to\nBirkenau to conduct the struggling women\u2018s orchestra.\nIn a herculean effort and utilizing all of the talent and\nstrength of spirit she possessed, Alma created a viable orchestra.\nMolding and teaching the musicians, many of whom had little if\nany previous training, and strictly regulating rehearsals, she rose\nabove the conditions of the death camp and began to present\nconcerts of high quality.\nThe orchestration of the orchestra was unusual, consisting\nof strings, guitar, flute, recorder, a few singers, percussion, cello,\ndouble bass, mandolin, and accordion. Alma arranged standard\norchestral repertoire for the resources they had. Germanic\ncomposers like Mozart, Schumann and Schubert were performed 364\nas well as more popular selections, German marches, and military\nsongs.65\nAlthough the musicians struggled with the omnipresent\nhunger in the camp, they were also permitted a barracks of their\nown which was heated for rehearsals and provided a separate\nliving area in the back. Conditions were primitive but infinitely\nbetter than those of the prison population at large. Some of this\nwas due to the SS, who did not want to come in close contact with\nlouse ridden individuals at concerts so permitted the musicians to\nkeep clean. Despite this, many of the women did suffer with\nmaladies common to the camp such as typhus, bacterial infections,\nand scabies.66\nThe young performers endured long rehearsals, often\nextending all day, and presented weekly concerts in both the camp\nhospital and in and outside of the Sauna building. Another of their\nmajor responsibilities was to play at the entrance of the camp while\n65 Helena Dunicz Niwi\u0144ska, \u201cTruth and Fantasy,\u201d Pro Memoria Nr. 3-4\n(Pa\u0144stwowe Muzeum Auschwitz-Birkenau, 1996), 65.\n66 Cykowiak, An Outline History, APMO. 365\nslave labor details were marched out in the morning and back\nagain at night.\nSadly, Alma Ros\u00e9, the guiding light of the orchestra, did\nnot survive the war. On April 5, 1944, she died under suspicious\ncircumstances, most probably from botulism.67 After her death the\norchestra floundered and ultimately was dispersed as the camp was\nliquidated. The musicians were deported to various other camps\nincluding Bergen-Belsen, Ravensbr\u00fcck and Neustadt-Glewe.\nAlthough a few of the women died, most survived the war - largely\ndue to their position in the women\u2019s orchestra and the efforts of\nAlma Ros\u00e9.\nIn the years following liberation survivors of the orchestra\nstruggled to build new lives after the devastation of the Holocaust.\nFew spoke of their experiences in Auschwitz-Birkenau. Then, in\n1976, a singer named Fania F\u00e9nelon published her memoir of the\norchestra. Titled \u201cSursis pour l\u2019orchestre\u201d (Reprieve for the\nOrchestra) it was shortly thereafter released in English, first as\n67 Richard Newman, and Karen Kirtley. 2000.

Quickly translated into multiple languages it\nsold hundreds of thousands of copies all over the world. In 1980\nPlaying for Time was made into a television movie which aired on\nCBS to great acclaim and occasional controversy and continues to\nstream on Netflix today.\nPlaying for Time was viewed with horror by other\nsurvivors of the orchestra, who were appalled by F\u00e9nelon\u2019s\nmemoir and her often embellished and manufactured prose. Most\negregiously they were upset by F\u00e9nelon\u2019s inaccurate portrayal of\nAlma Ros\u00e9, the inflation of her own importance and role in the\norchestra, and the mean-spirited and devastating portrayal of her\nformer friends. From its inception the other women banded\ntogether and fought to draw attention to the problems and\n68 Fania F\u00e9nelon, Sursis pour l\u2019orchestre, (Paris: Stock Publishers, 1976).

We can look to philosophy\nto understand how faith was challenged, denied, reformed,\ndisregarded, and preserved - during a time of total genocide.\nPhilosophical narratives provide a discussion on how to try to\nreach an impossible understanding as to why the Holocaust\noccurred. Here, we have an opportunity to scaffold a fascinating\nphilosophical examination of the implications of the Holocaust.\nScholar and Oakton professor Peter Hudis provides a critical look\nat one of the 20th century\u2019s most influential Jewish philosophers,\nEmmanuel Levinas.\nEmmanuel Levinas\nPeter Hudis\nEmmanuel Levinas (1906-1995), a widely influential\nJewish philosopher, was born in 1906 in Kaunas, Lithuania. He\nimmigrated to France in 1923, took up the study of philosophy,\nand became influenced by Edmund Husserl, the founder of\nphenomenology. In 1929, when barely 24 years old, he published 373\nthe first book-length study of Husserl in French. He also became\nenthralled with the work of Martin Heidegger, whose pathbreaking\nwork Being and Time sent shockwaves through European\nphilosophy. The gravest shock, however, was when Heidegger\njoined the Nazi party in 1933, openly promoted Nazism, and\nsubjected many of his Jewish colleagues (including Husserl\nhimself) to persecution. The shock hardly lessened by 1940, when\nLevinas (now a French citizen and military officer) was captured\nand imprisoned in a forced labor camp for Jewish prisoners.\nThough he avoided deportation to Germany, that was not the case\nwith his parents and brothers, who perished in the Shoah\u2014an\nevent that evoked not a word of criticism or remorse on the part of\nHeidegger from then to the end of his life.\nLevinas\u2019s response to the Holocaust largely defines the\nterrain of his subsequent thought. But he did so in a particular way,\nby arguing (often in direct contrast to Heidegger\u2019s\nphenomenological ontology) that \u201cphilosophy cannot not be an\nethics\u201d (Levinas, 1999, p. 97). Throughout his evolving body of\nwork, Levinas argued against the tendency to reduce the Other to a 374\nreflection of an absorbing or constituting consciousness by first of\nall distinguishing between two concepts of truth.\nMuch of Western thought has treated truth as the identity\nbetween phenomena and a comprehending consciousness that\nreduces \u201cthe Same to all that is opposed to it as Other\u201d (Levinas,\n1993, p. 91). Truth is viewed in terms of the conquest or\nconsumption of exteriority and otherness in the name of \u201cfreedom\u201d\nand \u201cautonomy.\u201d The distinctiveness of the Other, its heteronomy,\ngets flattened out and neutralized in the pursuit of apodictic self-\ncertainty. In contrast, Levinas argues, \u201cin the truth, a thinker\nmaintains a relationship with a reality distinct from him, other than\nhim\u2014'absolutely other\u2019\u201d (Levinas, 1993, pp. 88-89). A journey of\ndiscovery that returns us to the point from where we began after\nhaving absorbed the world into itself\u2014the motif that haunts\nWestern consciousness from Homer\u2019s Odyssey to\nHegel\u2019s Phenomenology of Sprit\u2014allows for no irreducible gap\nbetween the self and the Other.\nThe problem with such standpoints is that they remove the\nground for ethical obligation. If all that is separate from me can 375\neventually be reintegrated into myself in a higher totality, wherein\nlies the compulsion to respond to the obligations posed by others\nwho overflow my ideas and even my life? Wherein lies the\ncompulsion to take responsibility for those outside my circle of\nfriends, family, religion and nationality? People are rarely diffident\nabout addressing the needs of those like themselves; but what\nabout those who are not, who are absolutely other? Is not the\nHolocaust the ultimate expression of the refusal to posit a\nparticularism free from all that interferes with its universalism? To\nlive a truly ethical life we must put aside the temptation to treat\nevery obstacle as something to be surmounted and eventually\nintegrated into our orbit of experience. This poses a sharp\nchallenge to prevailing notions of freedom and autonomy, but it\ndoes not entail a rejection of the idea of freedom itself.\nFreedom is not possible without some kind of separation,\nwithout a tear or a rupture in the fabric of the totality. In lieu of\nsuch a separation it is hardly possible to contemplate and engage\nthe marvel of lived life. Levinas suggests that Western thought\ngrows impatient with the very separation that gives rise to it and 376\nseeks to reintegrate the separate elements into a higher synthesis.\nBy reducing otherness to what can be absorbed and appropriated\nby a comprehending consciousness, much of Western thought\nleaves us without access to that which inevitably escapes our\ngrasp\u2014that which is \u201cinfinite,\u201d the Other. And what escapes our\ngrasp in thought is often forcefully annulled in life, as the history\nof colonialism, imperialism, racism, and their accompanying\ngenocides suggest.\nLevinas\u2019s challenge to the egology that characterizes\nmodernity involves recovering \u201cthe heteronomous relationship\nwith an unknown God\u201d (Levinas, 1993, p. 96). God is not\n\u201cknown.\u201d God reveals. God in the Judaic tradition is unknown. The\ngravest crimes are justified in the name of a known God. The\ninfinite, the idea of God, escapes any effort at self-appropriation.\nBut that does not mean the infinite exerts no determinant pull on\nthe life of humanity, as is shown by the persistence of the idea of\nan infinite, unknowable God in human history. The fact that the\nidea of an infinite being cannot be made transparent to the\nknowing self does not render it superfluous. Levinas is not simply, 377\nor even primarily, providing the basis of a religious exegesis: his\npoint is that the other person can no more be reduced to a moment\nof our self-awareness than can the idea of God. The Other\nconfronts us from across a divide that is not exhausted by our\nefforts to define or appropriate her. The Other is in this sense\n\u201cinfinite.\u201d The Other comes to us from \u201con high,\u201d as a gift or as a\nthreat, but never as a result of our grasping and self-awareness.\nThe Other maintains itself in distinction from our subjectivity; she\nis irreducible, and in this sense, divine.\nLevinas develops these insights through a decades-long\nengagement with Ren\u00e9 Descartes\u2019s Mediations on First\nPhilosophy, which he considered among the five most important\nworks in the history of philosophy. This may be counter-intuitive:\nis not Descartes\u2019 introspective meditation on the self as the ground\nfor veridical knowledge the very opposite the \u201cI-Thou\u201d relation\nthat Levinas and Martin Buber take as their point of departure? It\nis important to recall, however, that Descartes\u2019s discourse on the\nself as a \u201cthinking thing\u201d raises the question of how a finite being\ncan have thought of the infinite. The latter is not constituted by the 378\nknowing subject; it is a priori. From where does this innate idea\nderive? Not from the knowing self, but from that which is itself\ninfinite. Descartes identifies the latter with God, whereas Levinas\nidentifies it with the relation between the self and the interminable\nobligations posed by the presence of the other person. It is not\nwithout reason that Levinas objected to defining his work in\nreligious terms, even though the terms of religious (and especially\nJudaic) discourse frames much of his thinking.\nThe cogito necessarily maintains a relationship with the\ninfinite. But what is the nature of this relationship? The infinite\noverflows any effort to comprehend it, seize it, conceptualize it. It\ndoes not derive from our freedom of thought. How then can we\nknow what is finite, and hence imperfect, unless there is an infinite\npower that \u201ccomes to humanity\u201d? This infinite power is the face of\nthe other. Herein lies the great intellectual revolution inaugurated\nby Levinas: the most mundane phenomenon of everyday life\u2014the\npresence of a face, the most exposed and vulnerable part of the\nbody\u2014is not only the source of our consciousness of others but of 379\nthe discovery that our obligation to them is inexhaustible. There is\nsimply no excuse not to save the lives of the damned:\nWhen we look at the face of the Other we know that we are\ncommanded to honor the alterity of the other by\nrecognizing an asymmetry between us. We also know that\nsomething has \"happened\" in the intersubjective \"space\"\nbetween us which transcends any knowledge we may have\nof it. But far from gaining an objective knowledge of God's\npurpose, we feel a deepened sense of responsibility, the\nweight of the other's suffering, an enhanced sense of the\nother's creatureliness. We do not interpret what we feel as\nbelonging to a teleological nexus but as bearing a moral\nimperative. (Wyschogrod, 2005, p. 362)\nLevinas\u2019s \u201cphilosophy of the face\u201d does not immediately\ntranslate into political action, although it has influenced numerous\npolitical theorists, including Frantz Fanon and Enrique Dussel. But\nit did lead Levinas to conclude that Heidegger, his initial\nphilosophic mentor, \u201cin the end does not escape from the\ntotalitarian and egological tendencies of the Western tradition\u201d 380\n(Peperzak, 1993, p. 16). It was not alone the Shoah\u2014and\nHeidegger\u2019s silence about it\u2014that led Levinas to embark on a new\npath in thought. He wrote, \u201cThe circumstances of Marxism having\nturned into Stalinism is the greatest offense to the cause of the\nhuman, because Marxism bore the hopes of humanity: it may be\nthe one of the greatest psychological shocks for the twentieth-\ncentury European\u201d (Levinas, 1999, p. 107). It is a shock humanity\nis still trying to recover from.\nLevinas did not despair of humanity, nor did he proclaim\n\u201cthe end of man\u201d\u2014unlike many of his later interlocutors in French\nphilosophy. He stated, \u201cBut in the decay of human relations, in that\nsociological misery, goodness persists. In the relation of one\nperson to another person, goodness is possible\u2026it is a goodness\nbeyond all systems, all religions, all social organizations.\nGratuitous, that goodness is eternal (Levinas, 1999, pp. 107-9).\nAnd as he argued in Totality and Infinity, his greatest philosophic\nwork, \u201cFreedom consists in knowing that freedom is in peril\u201d\n(Levinas, 1969, p. 35). Human freedom has perhaps never been 381\nmore in peril than it is today, which makes the thought of Levinas\nof such enduring value.\nReferences\nLevinas, E. (1969).

Some heroes have names\nbut are unknown because they did not want fame or glory. Some\nheroes become known because they people they helped save make\nsure that they are known. People fought back against the Nazis in\nany way that they could. Resistance took on many forms, including\narmed resistance. Non-Jews also aided in resistance. Ordinary\npeople within Germany resisted, from plotting assassination\nattempts to hiding children. An excellent place to start with\nunderstanding armed resistance in the ghettos and camps comes\nfrom this reading from Echoes & Reflections: Armed Resistance in\nGhettos and Camps; see also Rescuers and Non-Jewish Resistance.\nMotivations for becoming involved in helping Jews varied.\nWhy would people risk their lives to help? In his essay, survivor\nRalph Rehbock cited several people, some total strangers, who\nhelped his family survive. Upstanders were the opposite of\nbystanders. They acted. They resisted, they saved lives. They got 384\ninvolved. Upstanders rescued Jews, made up false papers to help\nJews escape, and acted because they had to. Irena Sendler, a\nmember of the Polish Underground Resistance, saved 2,500\nchildren. In Hungary, Charles Lutz, the Swiss Vice-Consul, saved\nover 60,000 Jews by providing safe places to hide and papers of\nsafe conduct. The Japanese diplomat Chiune Sugihara and his wife\nsaved thousands of Lithuanian Jews, issuing them visas. 385\nMuslim Upstanders\nWendy Adele-Marie\nAccording to Teaching Tolerance, \"Many religions have\nthings in common. At the same time, each is unique. In the shared\ncategory, Islam, like Christianity and Judaism, descends from the\nfirst five books of the Bible. That's why some people refer to\nmembers of all three religions as \"followers of the Book.\" Further,\nTeaching Tolerance, in a lesson on how to combat religious bias,\nand in the context of combating stereotypes, promotes an\nunderstanding that Islam promotes peace and tolerance. Ameena\nJandali of the Islamic Networks Group, reminds us that in Islam,\n\"killing an innocent person is considered to be the greatest crime,\"\nan important statement to remember as students progress through\nthis chapter studying upstanders.\nMoreover, these statements ask the reader to reflect on how\nMuslims put themselves in grave danger to save Jewish lives in\nEurope and in Northern Africa during the Holocaust. Muslims and\nothers acted because it was the right thing to do to save lives\nduring a time when millions remained silent. 386\nThe Holocaust was one of the greatest government\nsanctioned crimes against humanity in modern history. Genocide,\nas perpetrated by the Nazis, occurred when six million Jews and\nfive million others were systematically murdered by the Nazi\nregime (1933-1945) and their collaborators. Genocide is defined as\nthe systematic destruction of all or part of a racial, ethnic, religious\nor national group. Everyone was in danger when the Nazis were in\npower.\nThe Nazis intentionally targeted the Jews in a premeditated\nplan of unprecedented scale, which proved that \"analysis of the\nregimes intent indicated that the Nazis who had a psychic\nobsession with the Jews intentionally chose the Jews first for\nseparation, then removal, and then destruction. It was the objective\nof Adolf Hitler (1889-1945) to obliterate the Jews and others\ndesignated as ''enemies of the state.\" Destruction was facilitated by\nacceptance, industry, and a failure by the world to intervene.\nHowever, many did stand up and their contributions must be\nrecognized. 387\nMany Muslims during the Holocaust, at great risk and peril\nto themselves, their family, friends, and any known associates,\nsaved lives. The website, Holocaust: A Call to Conscience, reveals\nin the essay \u201cThe Holocaust and Muslims\u201d that in Europe,\nthere were also stories of great courage and sacrifice on\nthe part of Muslims who risked their own lives to save the\nJews from the Nazis. Muslim Albania was the only country\nin Europe in which there were more Jews after the war than\nthere had been before the war. Before World War II, there\nwere only 200 Jews in Albania, which had a total\npopulation of 800,000. After the war, there were many\nmore Jews after Jewish refugees from some half dozen\nEuropean countries fled the Nazi persecution and sought\nshelter in Albania. These Muslim heroes included the\nBosnian Dervis Korkut, who harbored a young Jewish\nwoman resistance fighter named Mira Papo and saved the\nSarajevo Haggadah, one of the most valuable Hebrew\nmanuscripts in the world; the Turk Selahattin Ulkumen,\nwhose rescue of fifty Jews from the ovens of Auschwitz led 388\nto the death of his wife Mihrinissa soon after she gave birth\nto their son Mehmet when the Nazis retaliated for his\nheroism; and the Albanian Refik Vesili who - at the age of\n16 - saved eight Jews by hiding them in his family's\nmountain home. (Holocaust: A Call to Conscience, 2009)\nOne of the most famous Muslim upstanders was Iranian diplomat\nAbdol Hossein Sardari, who rescued thousands of Jews from\nFrance\u2019s occupied zone. Holocaust: A Call to Conscience also\ndiscussed Northern African responses to the Holocaust. Geography\nplayed a role in the Holocaust as well. Jews in countries like\nMorocco had a greater chance of survival than they did in\nEuropean countries. Remarkable stories of upstanders come from\nthese Northern African nations, such as:\nArabs welcomed Jews into their homes, guarded Jews\u2019\nvaluables so Germans could not confiscate them, shared\nwith Jews their meager rations and warned Jewish leaders\nof coming SS raids. The sultan of Morocco and the bey of\nTunis provided moral support and, at times, practical help\nto Jewish subjects. In Vichy-controlled Algiers, mosque 389\npreachers gave Friday sermons forbidding believers from\nserving as conservators of confiscated Jewish property. In\nthe words of Yaacov Zrivy, from a small town near Sfax,\nTunisia, \u201cThe Arabs watched over the Jews.\u201d I found\nremarkable stories of rescue, too. In the rolling hills west of\nTunis, 60 Jewish internees escaped from an Axis labor\ncamp and banged on the farm door of a man named Si Ali\nSakkat, who courageously hid them until liberation by the\nAllies. In the Tunisian coastal town of Mahdia, a dashing\nlocal notable named Khaled Abdelwahhab scooped up\nseveral families in the middle of the night and whisked\nthem to his countryside estate to protect one of the women\nfrom the predations of a German officer bent on rape.\nAnd there is strong evidence that the most influential Arab\nin Europe\u2014Si Kaddour Benghabrit, the rector of the Great\nMosque of Paris\u2014saved as many as 100 Jews by having\nthe mosque\u2019s administrative personnel give them\ncertificates of Muslim identity, with which they could 390\nevade arrest and deportation. These men, and others, were\ntrue heroes.\nAccording to the Koran: \u201cWhoever saves one life, saves the\nentire world.\u201d This passage echoes the Talmud\u2019s\ninjunction, \u201cIf you save one life, it is as if you have saved\nthe world.\u201d\nArabs need to hear these stories\u2014both of heroes and of\nvillains. They especially need to hear them from their own\nteachers, preachers and leaders. If they do, they may\nrespond as did that one Arab prince who visited the\nHolocaust museum. \u201cWhat we saw today,\u201d he commented\nafter his tour, \u201cmust help us change evil into good and hate\ninto love and war into peace.\u201d (Satloff, 2006)\nThese stories of upstanders prove that actions saved lives.\nConsequently, it also demands analysis into why so few world\nleaders and individuals stood by. People who did not act during the\nHolocaust are known as bystanders.\nMore resources on Muslim upstanders and the Holocaust\ncan be found here: 391\nThe readings:\n1a. \"Abdol Hossein Sardari, an Iranian diplomat stationed\nin Paris, saved thousands of Jews during the Holocaust by\nconvincing the Germans that Persian Jews weren\u2019t Semites.

It was a speech written by Adam\nYunis and presented to the Polish American Medical Society by\nKelley Szany, Vice President of Education and Exhibitions\nIMHEC, in October 2019.\nThe Life of Janusz Korczak\nAdam Yunis\nJanusz Korczak represents all the creativity, talent,\nempathy and ambition to make the world a better place that was\nlost in the tragedy of the Holocaust. But Korczak also represents\ncourage, the courage to put others before yourself, the courage to\nnot abandon your beliefs, your friends, your children. Writing in\nthe Warsaw Ghetto, Korczak writes of staking his life on a single\ncard, the care of destitute children. Korczak is known for his\nactions during this time in the Ghetto, where he heroically cared\nfor the children in his orphanage, but his actions throughout his life\ndisplay a profound sense of moral duty to help not only\nindividuals, but society. What strikes us most from Kozak\u2019s life is 397\nan intense belief in humanity and his message that we cannot let\nour world, our society, fail our children.\nJanusz Korczak was born Henryk Goldszmit on July 22nd,\n1878 or 1879 to a well off, assimilated Jewish family in Warsaw,\nPoland. Korczak writings tell us of his own shock on learning as a\nfive-year-old that he was a Jew from a janitor\u2019s son, who\nthreatened him with a dark place much like Hell if he did not do\nhis bidding. We do not know if his father, J\u00f3zef, a lawyer, took\nhim to synagogue or had him bar mitzvahed, but he passed on to\nhim the aspirations of his own father, a physician, to liberate the\nJews from their segregated lives and propel them into Polish\nculture. This belief in a strong bond between Jews and Poles, that\none could be both Jewish and Polish and not sacrifice either\nidentity would be a driving force in his life. Korczak states in his\nmemoir \u201cI pursue in life that which my father strove for and for\nwhich my grandfather tortured himself for many years. \u201cThis belief\nin one common humanity would be a defining principle in his\nwork as an educator. 398\nWhen Korczak father died after a long illness in 1896, the\nfamily was left without a source of income. Korczak was forced to\nbe the sole breadwinner for his mother, sister, and grandmother.\nChildren became Korczak savior in his youth, just as he would\nbecome theirs. He forgot his own anxieties while tutoring\npampered, rich boys, much like he had been, in order to help\nsupport his family, and in the process developed some of the\ncreative strategies that he would later use in his own orphanages.\nThis close family environment and the death of his father by illness\nundoubtedly influenced his awareness to the plight of societal\nproblems and his early pursuit of medicine. Korczak studied\nmedicine at the University of Warsaw from 1898-1904. During this\ntime, he began writing professionally, using the name we now\nknow today, Janusz Korczak, a name he chose from one of his\nfavorite Polish novels. Korczak was immediately successful,\nwriting in several newspapers and publishing well received\nchildren\u2019s books. In medicine he specialized in pediatrics but\nimmediately after graduating was drafted into the Russian army\nand was posted in East Asia. Even during those war years, Korczak 399\nwas always himself, always sensitive to the fate of children. In his\nmemoirs he recalls buying a beating rod off a sadistic Chinese\nteacher in one of the villages \u2013 it would later serve as a skipping\nrope for children at his Orphans\u2019 Home. He then worked for\nBersohns and Baumans Children's Hospital in Warsaw from 1905-\n1912. During this time, he continued to write children\u2019s books and\nbooks for adults on raising their children and became well known\nin Warsaw society for his successful private practice in medicine\nand as an influential author.\nBoth as a doctor and a writer, Korczak was drawn to the\nworld of the child. He worked in a Jewish children\u2019s hospital and\ntook groups of children to summer camps, and in 1908 he began to\nwork with orphans. By working with orphans, he met Stefania\nWilczynska, a superb educator, and the daughter of a wealthy\nJewish family who dedicated her life to the care of orphans and\ngreatly influenced Korczak and his career as an educator. It was\nthe work with orphans and with the help of a great mind as\nStefania that led him to open his own orphanage, one where he\ncould implement his own progressive ideas. 400\nIn 1912, Korczak and Stefania opened Dom Sierot at\nKrochmalna 92 street, a Jewish orphanage with a hundred boys\nand girls, ages seven to fourteen. Members of Warsaw society had\nbeen amazed that the famous Janusz Korczak would give up his\nliterary career and successful medical practice to take care of poor\nchildren. They did not understand that medicine was no longer\nenough for this visionary pediatrician. \u201cThe road I have chosen\ntoward my goal is neither the shortest nor the most convenient,\u201d he\ntold an interviewer. \u201cBut it is the best for me because it is my own.\nI found it not without effort or pain.\u201d Part of the difficulty in\nmaking the decision lay in assuring himself that he was not\nbetraying medicine. He reasoned that medicine is involved only\nwith curing the sick child, but he had a chance to cure the whole\nchild in running an orphanage. As a scientist he could use the\norphanage as a laboratory for clinical observation and as an\neducator, he could be, in his own words, \u201csculptor of the child\u2019s\nsoul.\u201d The children\u2019s republic he built was designed as a just\ncommunity where its young citizens would have their own\nparliament, newspaper, and court of peers. 401\nKorczak was a pioneer in what we now call moral\neducation. Central to his ideas in his orphanage and in his ideas of\nchildhood development was his Declaration of Children\u2019s Rights.\nThat children have a right to be loved, respected and given optimal\nconditions in which to grow. They have a right to be taken\nseriously and that children are not people of tomorrow but people\nof today. Korczak believed that \u201cthe unknown person inside each\nchild is the hope for the future.\u201d It was for this reason children\ncould be as religious as they wanted and allowed to pursue creative\noutlets as they wish.\nAs a form of tonic, Pan Doctor, as the orphans called him,\ndevised ingenious strategies \u2014 his \u201cpedagogical arsenal\u201d \u2014 to\nhelp his charges strengthen their will. One favorite was the make-\nbelieve gambling casino he set up for them to bet on how many\nfights they would have each week, until they were motivated to\nhave none. However, he considered the children\u2019s court of peers\nthe cornerstone of his system because it would show the children\nthat there could be justice even in an unjust world. Rather than\nretaliating a child could call out \u201cI sue you,\u201d and sign his or her 402\nname on the list of court cases that were heard each Saturday\nmorning. Five children with no cases against them that week were\nthe judges, who followed a Code of Laws that Korczak had drawn\nup, with forgiveness being the usual resolution to a court case.\nBehind Korczak creative techniques was a keen psychological\nunderstanding of children that came from years of practice,\nexperience that most doctors who worked with adults did not have.\nKorczak once told a friend \u201cI am a doctor by training, a pedagogue\nby chance, a writer by passion, and a psychologist by necessity.\u201d\nKorczak was also striving to fulfill the goals of his father\nand grandfather and to reinforce the bridge between Jewish and\nCatholics. He made Polish the language in his Jewish orphanage,\nco-directed a second orphanage in Warsaw for poor Catholic\nchildren and wrote humorous books on his experiences in both\nJewish and Polish summer camps. He learned at camp that all\nchildren are alike because they speak the common language of\nchildhood. They laugh at the same things; they feel the same\nweight of life and they weep at the same things. As Korczak\ninfluence grew he founded the first children\u2019s newspaper, The 403\nLittle Review, and had a radio program as the Old Doctor, whose\nwarmth and wit endeared him to Polish children all over the\ncountry. The Little Review was press phenomenon of an\nunprecedented scale \u2013 a paper edited and written by children,\nwhich maintained the appearance of a real paper and which was\ndevoid of any paternalistic and moralizing approach typical of\npublications addressed to children. His last radio broadcast took\nplace in 1939 during the start of the war, when he addressed\nchildren to soothe them and prepare them for what was coming.\nOn September 1st, 1939, Germany invaded Poland after\nhaving staged several false flag border incidents as a pretext to\ninitiate the attack. Korczak volunteered for military service but was\nrefused due to his age. Shortly after Warsaw fell to the Germans in\n1939, Korczak began a memoir, starting with the line,\n\u201cReminiscences make a sad, depressing literature.\u201d Certainly, he\ndid not expect at the age of sixty-one to be writing a memoir in\noccupied Warsaw, in what he called \u201cthe hour of reckoning in the\nsaddest hospital in the world.\u201d 404\nIn early November 1940, one year after the creation of the\nghetto, together with Ms. Stefa and his children, Korczak was\nforced to leave Krochmalna (which now found itself outside of the\nghetto) and to transfer into a building of the State Trade School on\n33 Ch\u0142odna Street. As part of his resistance to the Nazis, Korczak\nkept the same structure and routine in his ghetto orphanage. Every\nSaturday morning, the children were weighed, the court or peers\nmet and handed down its verdicts, and he read aloud the orphanage\nnewspaper. He added an underground school in the orphanage,\nwhich included Hebrew in the curriculum to prepare those children\nif there was an opportunity to escape to Palestine. Korczak\nstruggled to keep his spirits up. This educator who could not bear\nto see a child suffer from any injustice or an unkind word, who had\na taken a vow to uphold the cause of children and to defend their\nrights, had to pass dead or dying children on the street every day.\nHe records without comment that three boy boys playing on the\nsidewalk were annoyed that the body of a dead child was in their\nway. Korczak unsuccessfully pleaded with the Judenrat to provide 405\na place where terminally ill children could die with dignity. In the\nGhetto, Korczak refused to wear an armband with a star of David.\nHe felt this demeaned the Jewish star to be used in such a way, but\nthis resistance almost cost him his life. During the move to the\nGhetto, in 1940, Korczak protested to the Gestapo that these\norphanages potatoes had been confiscated during the move. He\nwas thrown into the notorious Pawiak prison for not wearing his\narmband. He survived only because of one of his former orphans\nhad the contacts and funds to get him out.\nDuring his time in the ghetto, Korczak spent his days\ncaring for his orphans and attempting to raise funds for food and\nmedicine. When he was a child, Korczak father invited in\nunemployed workers who went from house to house performing a\npuppet play during Christmastime. After it was over an old man\nwith a bag appeared to take up donations. The boy, \u201ctrembling\nwith excitement,\u201d would toss his little coins into the sack. The old\nman would peer inside, shake his long white beard, and say: \u201cVery\nlittle, very little, young gentleman, a bit more.\u201d The old man with\nthe sack had taught Korczak a great deal: He writes in the ghetto 406\nthat \u201cThe hopelessness of defense against persistent requests and\nunbounded demands that are impossible to meet. At first, you give\neagerly, then less enthusiastically, from a sense of duty, then,\nfollowing the laws of inertia, from habit and without heart, and\nthen resentfully, angrily, with despair.\u201d Each morning in the ghetto\nhe got up, slung a sack over his aching shoulder, and went out to\nmakes his rounds of wealthy contacts and social service agencies\nto plead, then demand, money and food for his two hundred\nchildren. He was as relentless as the old man: no matter what they\ngave, it was never enough.\nKorczak took a break from writing in his memoir until May\nof 1942, nearly a two-year break. We can surmise that he started\nwriting again because of the increasing violence of Nazi death\nsquads and rumors of impending mass deportations. For the first\ntwo weeks in July, when smugglers of food and supplies were\nbeing slaughtered, Korczak, the writer, emerges imagining a planet\ncalled Ro. The astronomer who lives on it, Professor Zi, can\nconvert heat radiation into moral power and can bestow order and\ntranquility everywhere except on \u201cthat restless spark, Planet 407\nEarth.\u201d Looking down on the wars of the planet, Professor Zi\nwonders if he should simply put an end to this senseless, bloody\ngame. But with the compassion of the Old Doctor, he concludes:\n\u201cPlanet Earth is still young. And a beginning is painful labor.\u201d\nProfessor Zi has all-encompassing power on Planet Ro, but Janusz\nKorczak has no control down in the smoldering ghetto, except in\nhis children\u2019s republic. Still the inventive pedagogue, he makes a\ngame out of catching the flies that swarm over the toilet buckets.\nHe writes of the thrill he received when one of the boys asks:\n\u201cMay I pay the flies later? I can\u2019t wait,\u201d and another offers to catch\nhis flies for him. \u201cCommunity good will, what a mighty force,\u201d\nKorczak writes.\nRumors, impossible to verify, continued to spread through\nthe ghetto that Jews were being gassed in other cities and that\nrailroad cars were waiting to deport everyone from the Warsaw\nghetto. Korczak Polish disciples on the Aryan side also heard the\nrumors, and sent Igor Newerly, his former secretary, into the\nghetto disguised as a water and sewer inspector with a false\nidentity card to bring Korczak out. According to Newerly, Korczak 408\nrefused to abandon the children at such a perilous time. He did,\nhowever, promise to send Newerly the diary he was working on for\nsafekeeping.\nIn the ghetto Korczak attempted to keep kids occupied and\nthought that they might enjoy acting in a play The Post Office,\nwritten by the Indian writer and philosopher Rabindranath Tagore,\nwhose empathy for children was much like his own. The\nproduction, which took place on July 18 \u2014 four days before\ndeportations were announced and three weeks before the young\nactors would march to their deaths \u2014 has become legendary. In the\nplay, Amal, a gentle and imaginative orphan adopted by a poor\ncouple, is confined to his room with a serious illness, shut in from\nthe outside world, like everyone in the ghetto, awaiting an\nuncertain future. He longs to fly to that land to which the King\u2019s\ndoctor, greater than the one he has now, will lead him by the hand.\nThe invited guests gasp along with Amal when the royal doctor\nsuddenly appears and orders all the doors and windows to be\nopened. Amal\u2019s pain is gone, and he can see the stars twinkling on\nthe other side of the darkness. Asked why he chose that play, 409\nKorczak is reported to have said that he wanted to help the children\nface death without fear. But in his diary, he makes only a short\nnotation about the afternoon: \u201cApplause, handshakes, smiles,\nefforts at cordial conversation.\u201d\nJuly 22 was Korczak sixty-fourth birthday. It was also the\nday the Gestapo informed the ghetto that there would be\ndeportations. By 4 PM that afternoon, six thousand people were to\nbe at the Umschlagplatz, a large loading area just north of the\nghetto, where freight trains were waiting to take them to\n\u201cResettlement in the East.\u201d Korczak surely stood in the hysterical\ncrowds looking at the notices posted on the ghetto walls, but rather\nthan accept his inability to alter the surreal events of that day, he\ndid battle where he could.\nIn the final entry of August 5 or August 6, Korczak is\nwatering the \u201cpoor orphanage plants,\u201d which had been smuggled\ninto the ghetto by his Polish friends. He muses about the young\nGerman soldier standing with his rifle by the ghetto wall across the\nstreet. The soldier was not shooting at him, even though his \u201cbald\nhead in the window\u201d would make a \u201csplendid target.\u201d Korczak 410\ntries to see him as a young man with an identity other than a killer\nwith a gun. \u201cPerhaps he was a village teacher, a street sweeper in\nLeipzig, a waiter in Cologne.\u201d He considers waving his hand in a\nfriendly gesture. He writes what will be the final words of his\nghetto diary: \u201cPerhaps he doesn\u2019t even know that things are as they\nare? He may have arrived only yesterday from far away...\u201d We see\nthat to his last day in the ghetto Korczak tries to hold on to his\nhumanity.\nOn Thursday, August 6, 1942, he and the children were\nsitting down to their meager breakfast when they heard the dread\ncall: \u201cAll Jews out.\u201d We can be certain that Korczak tried to\nreassure the children as they lined up fearfully, clutching their little\nflasks of water, their few possessions, their diaries. No one had yet\nescaped from Treblinka to reveal the truth: they were not going\nEast, but sixty miles northeast of Warsaw to immediate\nextermination in gas chambers. We know from survivors who\nwatched from behind closed shutters, and from Gestapo records,\nthat Korczak, hatless, in high military boots, holding two young\nchildren by the hand, was at the head of the orderly procession of 411\n192 children and 10 staff members, including the loyal Stefa, who\nhad also turned down offers to escape. They marched four abreast\nin the broiling heat, holding high the flag of King Matt, green on\none side, with the blue Star of David set against a field of white on\nthe other, escorted by soldiers, whips, and dogs. Wladyslaw\nSzpilman in his memoir, The Pianist says of the scene \u201cHe told the\norphans they were going out into the country, so they ought to be\ncheerful. At last, they would be able to exchange the horrible\nsuffocating city walls for meadows of flowers, streams where they\ncould bathe, woods full of berries and mushrooms. He told them to\nwear their best clothes, and so they came out into the yard, two by\ntwo, nicely dressed and in a happy mood.\u201d\nWe learn from the memoir of Nahum Remba, a Judenrat\n[Jewish council] official who ran a small first aid station on the\nUmschlagplatz, that 4,000 orphans, with their caretakers, went on\nthe transports with Korczak and the children that day. He tried to\npersuade Korczak to go with him to ask the Judenrat to intercede,\nbut Korczak would not consider leaving the children even for a\nmoment in this terrifying place. Remba states \u201cI shall never forget 412\nthis scene as long as I live,\u201d Remba wrote. \u201cThis was no march to\nthe trains, but rather a mute protest, with eyes full of contempt for\nthis murderous regime.\u201d The Jewish police jumped to attention and\nsaluted when they saw Korczak helping the children into the\ncrowded freight cars. The Germans asked: \u201cWho is that man?\u201d The\ndoors closed. There were no survivors.\nOutside the ghetto a red-haired boy appeared at his door\nwith a package for Igor Newerly. Newerly realized that Korczak\nhad kept his promise to send him the diary. He took it immediately\nto Korczak Polish orphanage and helped the caretaker brick it up\nunder the eaves. After the war, when Poland was part of the Soviet\nbloc, Newerly, who had survived two years in Auschwitz (where\nhe thought he spotted the red-haired boy), was able to retrieve the\ndiary from its hiding place.\nOnly one rock is engraved: \u201cJanusz Korczak (Henryk\nGoldszmit) and the children.\u201d At Treblinka today. Over the years,\nthe Korczak legend has gathered momentum in Europe as poets\nand playwrights continue to recreate his march with the children to\nthe trains. Korczak societies have sprung up in many countries and 413\nhold international conferences to spread his educational ideas and\nto advocate for the welfare of children. The Poles claim Korczak as\na martyr, who would have been canonized if he had converted; the\nIsraelis claim him as one of the Thirty-Six Just Men, whose pure\nsouls make possible the world\u2019s salvation. UNESCO declared\n1978-79 the Year of Janusz Korczak, to coincide with the Year of\nthe Child and the centenary of his birth. In 1971, the Russians\ndiscovered a new asteroid and named it 2163 Korczak. Now the\nOld Doctor really does have a planet very much like Planet Ro\nfrom which to control the moral forces in the universe and to put\ninto effect his Declaration of Children\u2019s Rights. Janusz Korczak\noften said life is a strange dream, I ask you today to remember him\nnot for how he died, but for the values he lived his life.\nFurther Resources:\nNotes from the Warsaw Ghetto: The Journal of Emmanuel\nRingelblum\nThe Warsaw Ghetto : Memoirs of Janusz Korcza\nReferences 414\nKorczak, Janusz and E P Kulawiec.

Sarah\nreminds us that people were not willing victims.\nResistance: Warsaw Ghetto Uprising\nSarah Gawo\nJewish resistance against Nazi Germany occurred in a\nvariety of ways ranging from minor to major offenses. Resistance\nranged from actively using violence to using non-violent tactics.\nThis essay will discuss the form of Jewish resistance undertaken in\nthe Warsaw ghetto, as well as describing the various conditions of\neach type of ghetto.\nThe ghettos were used to separate the Jewish people from\nsociety. They were segregated because the Nazis believed that\nJewish people were like vermin. Thus, the Nazis believed that they\nneeded to contain the Jews in an enclosed space in order to not\nincrease disease. Consequently, the Jewish residents of the ghettos\nwere mistreated and discriminated against. The Nazis created three\ntypes of ghettos: destruction, closed, and open. Closed ghettos 416\nwere fenced with barbed wire similar to that of a concentration\ncamp. Open ghettos restricted the Jews from freely leaving and\nentering. Lastly, destruction ghettos were heavily enforced with\nNazi workers who would either kill or deport the Jews. Under\nthese circumstances, Jewish resistance grew in response to all the\nterror that they have endured from the Nazis as well as its\ncollaborators.\nA notable example of Jewish resistance is the Uprising of\nthe Warsaw Ghetto in 1943. Heinrich Himmler, one of the main\narchitect of the Holocaust, ordered that the Jews in the Warsaw\nGhetto be rounded up, and then deported to the Treblinka death\ncamp. When the Jewish Fighting Organization (ZOB) and other\ngroups heard about this plan, they decided it was time for the\nJewish to resist the deportation. Many Jews used smuggled\nweapons such as machine guns and grenades to attack the Nazis.\nThere were approximately 800 Jewish fighters and double the\namount of the German troops. The Jews were able to stop the\nGermans but not for long. \u201cThe rebellion led by the ZOB and ZZW\nwas crushed, and most of the ghetto residents were either deported 417\nto the death camps or killed in the fighting and subsequent razing\nof the ghetto by German troops\u201d (Einwohner, 663). After the\ndestruction of the ghetto, the Nazis demolished the Great\nSynagogue of Warsaw. Approximately 7,000 Jews died in the\nWarsaw Ghetto Uprising, and 50,000 Jews were sent to\nconcentration camps and killing centers.\nUnderstanding Jewish resistance, one must consider the\nconditions of the ghettos and the high-risk activism undertaken by\nthe resistors in the Warsaw ghetto. Not only did the Warsaw\nGhetto Uprising exemplify the Jewish people\u2019s strength of spirit,\nbut it also set precedent for the varying Jewish communities to also\nget involved in high-risk action to resist the Nazis.\nReferences\nEinwohner, R.

Professor, historian and German\nscholar Stephani Richards-Wilson presents her work on the White\nRose and their American connections, along with assessments and\ncritical resources for further research.\nThe White Rose and Their American Connections\nStephani Richards-Wilson\nThe White Rose resistance group (Die Wei\u00dfe Rose in\nGerman) was a circle of friends and classmates studying at Ludwig\nMaximilian University of Munich, Germany during the Second\nWorld War. In 1942-1943, they composed six flyers and\ndistributed thousands of copies calling for nonviolent resistance\nagainst Hitler and the National Socialists (Nazis). The group\nincluded adult mentors who provided spiritual, financial, or other\ntypes of support. One of their professors, Kurt Huber, joined their\nefforts and was arrested, tried, and executed in 1943 similar to five\nother core members. The story of the White Rose is well known in\nGermany, however, connections to the United States are lesser\nknown. This essay explores those connections then and now. 419\nThe courageous story of the White Rose, the Nazi\nresistance circle consisting of mostly university students, is well\nknown in Germany and much of the world. You can find many\nbooks and resources about the core members on the Internet.\nToday, many streets, schools, and events throughout Germany\nmemorialize the core members and their professor, especially in\nFebruary when they were arrested by the Gestapo in 1943. In\n1942-1943, during the Second World War, the White Rose\nstudents produced six flyers and made thousands of copies in the\ncover of night and in secret. They called for nonviolent resistance\nagainst Hitler\u2019s dictatorship. They typed the original flyers on a\nRemington typewriter manufactured in New York.71\nDuring that same month of February 1943, Hans Scholl,\nAlexander Schmorell, and Willi Graf ventured out into the city\nstreets of Munich three late nights and early hours of the morning.\nThey painted freedom (Freiheit) slogans in the form of graffiti on\n71 The core members who were executed by the Nazis included Hans Scholl\n(1918-1943) and his younger sister Sophie Scholl (1921-1943), Alexander\nSchmorell (1917-1943), Christoph Probst (1919-1943), Willi Graf (1918-1943)\nand Professor Kurt Huber (1893-1943). 420\ncity walls and buildings near the university where they were\nstudying medicine (Graf, 2004, pp. 322-323).72 In less than a year,\nfive of the students and their professor, Kurt Huber, were tried and\nexecuted by the Nazis for high treason. Only one of the core\nmembers who was also arrested and jailed, Traute Lafrenz,\nsurvived the trial and war. After a year in various Gestapo prisons,\nshe was liberated by the Americans.\nThe students first got to know each other by attending\nprivate literary evenings near Ludwig Maximillian University of\nMunich where they were enrolled. The White Rose circle began as\na group of friends and classmates who shared similar interests,\nmost notably in books and literature. They mostly read European\nliterature, however, one of the members, Willi Graf, was\nparticularly impressed with award-winning American novelist and\nplaywright Thornton Wilder (1897-1975). Wilder was born in\nMadison, Wisconsin and served in the US Army Air Force\n72 They painted \u201cFreedom,\u201d \u201cDown with Hitler,\u201d and \u201cMass murderer Hitler.\u201d\nGraf, Scholl, and Schmorell were student soldiers and assigned to a student\ncompany affiliated with the German army. 421\nIntelligence in the Second World War. Graf especially liked his\nnovel The Bridge of San Luis Rey (1927), which he read in the\nsummer of 1942.73\nThe group that originally met to discuss books and\neventually emerged as the White Rose was informally started by\nTraute Lafrenz, Hans Scholl, and Alexander Schmorell, all medical\nstudents at LMU (Waage, 2012, p. 256). They shared an interest in\nculture, music, books, theological and philosophical questions, as\nwell as resistance to Hitler and the Nazis. Traute brought the third\nWhite Rose flyer to students in Hamburg in November 1942,\nthereby cultivating a White Rose branch among her former\nclassmates (Waage, 2012, p. 171). Along with Sophie Scholl, she\nobtained paper and envelopes as well. When the Scholls were\narrested, she tried to warn others and removed evidence. She was\nalso arrested and stood trial April 19, 1943. She was in various\nGestapo jails until liberated by American troops on April 16, 1945.\n73 In this fable, Wilder explores the meaning of the human condition and the\nconnection between the individual and cosmic dimensions. Ironically, Graf\nhimself was fictionalized in a historical novel called All God\u2019s Children\npublished in 2013 by Wisconsin writer Anna Schmidt. 422\nShe came to the United States in 1947 and completed her medical\nstudies in California. She married a fellow physician, became an\nAmerican citizen, and had four children whom she raised in\nEvanston, Illinois.74\nThere were five White Rose trials in total with numerous\ndefendants. After Hans Scholl was arrested in February 1943, he\ntold the Gestapo that he arbitrarily picked the name, the White\nRose, however Newborn (2006) suspects that might not have been\nthe case. It\u2019s possible Scholl said that to protect a friend (p. 4.).\nNewborn believes he intentionally tried to mislead the interrogator\nand to protect Josef S\u00f6hngen, a bookseller who offered the White\nRose students a safe place to meet and hid banned books in his\nshop. He had also allowed the group to hide the flyers and\n74 Traute ran a small medical practice and led the Esperanza School in Chicago\nfrom 1971 to 1992. The school provides special education for developmentally\nchallenged children from the poorer sections of the city. She retired in 1994. In\n2009, she was awarded the Herbert Weichmann medal from the Jewish\nCommunity in Hamburg, Germany. After retiring and as of 2021, she lives in\nSouth Carolina and goes by the name Traute Page, MD. She was awarded the\nBundesverdienstkreuz (Federal Cross of Merit or Order of Merit), a prestigious\nhonor in Germany, on May 3, 2019, her 100th birthday. 423\nduplicating materials in his cellar (Wei\u00dfe Rose Stiftung, 2006, p.\n76).75\nDie Wei\u00dfe Rose (The White Rose), a novel by B. Traven,\nwas originally published in 1929 in Germany. It was serialized in\nthe last issues of the Munich Post newspaper which like the White\nRose students, fought to expose the truth about Hitler and his\nsinister agenda (Rosenbaum, 2017). After the Nazis seized power\nin 1933 and took control of the media, they shut down the Post and\nbanned Traven\u2019s novel. The story takes place in the 1920s, partly\nin the United States and partly in Mexico. An American oil\ncompany purchased the oil rights to the haciendas encircling the\nRosa Blanca or White Rose. The plot revolves around the evils of\nAmerican corporate greed contrasted against First Nation\nreverence for their land and tradition. The struggle between good\n75 Newborn wrote an essay entitled, \u201cSolving Mysteries: The Secret of the White\nRose.\u201d Originally it was intended to be the afterword of his book which he co-\nauthored with Annette Dumbach, Sophie Scholl and the White Rose: The\nRemarkable German Students who Defied Hitler. In this essay, he suggests that\nthe White Rose novel was the inspiration for the group\u2019s name. For more\ninformation about the origins of the name and how the novel resonated with\nHans Scholl and Alexander Schmorell who co-authored the first four White\nRose flyers in summer 1942, see http://www.judnewborn.com/jud-\nsolvingmysteries.html). 424\nversus evil, against overwhelming odds, most likely resonated with\nthe White Rose students and the Munich Post.\nIn late 1942 and early 1943, the White Rose students\nattempted to expand their circle of helpers. Through a mutual\nfriend, they met with Falk Harnack (1913-1991). Falk\u2019s older\nbrother, Arvid Harnack and his American born wife, Mildred Fish-\nHarnack were leading members of the Berlin resistance network\ncalled the Red Orchestra. Similar to the White Rose students, they\nwere arrested and executed by the Nazis. There were never able to\nconnect and combine their resistance efforts.\nDr. Arvid Harnack (1901-1942), was a German economist\nand senior governmental official in the Third Reich. He secretly\nworked to undermine the Nazi war efforts in a resistance circle\ncalled the Red Orchestra (Rote Kapelle). He and another leading\nfigure in the Red Orchestra, German solider Harro Schulze-Boysen\n(1909-1942) provided critical information to the American and\nSoviet embassies, including information about Nazi preparations to\ninvade the Soviet Union in 1941. They were sentenced to death for\nhigh treason and hanged in Pl\u00f6tzensee Prison in Berlin in 425\nDecember 1942. The first of the eleven leading resisters in the\nHarnack/Schulze-Boysen group were hung at that time (Scholl,\n2016, p. 149).76 Arvid\u2019s wife, Dr. Mildred Fish-Harnack, was\nbeheaded February 16, 1943 in Berlin. She was born in 1902 in\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin. She graduated from the University of\nWisconsin-Madison where she had met Arvid who was studying\nthere on a Rockefeller scholarship. They married and moved to\nGermany where they secretly led resistance activities. Fish-\nHarnack is the only American woman executed on Hitler\u2019s direct\norders.77\nSimilar to the Red Orchestra, the White Rose resistance\ngroup embodied independent thinking, individual responsibility,\n76 Falk Harnack had contacted his cousins Dietrich and Klaus Bonhoeffer in\nBerlin. They encouraged him to try to save what was left of his brother\u2019s\nresistance circle and indicated they would help him. They were eager for him to\nconnect them with the White Rose students in Munich.\n77 Mildred was a translator, journalist, and highly educated academic and\neducator. The Harnacks were arrested in September 1942, tried separately,\ndetained, and tortured. Arvid was found guilty and executed for treason in\nDecember, and although Mildred was originally sentenced to six years of hard\nlabor, Hitler himself intervened. He ordered a retrial and execution. Since 1986,\nMildred\u2019s birthday, September 16, has been recognized as a special day of\nobservance in Wisconsin public schools. In 2019, a monument/sculpture was\ndedicated to her in Madison, Wisconsin. German schools and streets are named\nafter her and the oldest public school in Milwaukee is named after her.

American publications such as The New York Times\nand TIME Newsmagazine referenced the White Rose students and\nthe fatal consequences of their actions soon after they were\narrested in 1943. The White Rose continues to impact people\naround the world and their spirit lives on in social media, books,\nand cultural events that commemorate their short but significant\nlives. American playwright Lillian Garrett-Groag, for example,\nwrote the play The White Rose. It premiered in the Old Globe\nTheatre in San Diego, California in 1991. As recent as 2017,\nstudents affiliated with the University of Wisconsin-Madison and\nKnow Better Productions performed the play in the Broom Street\nTheater in Madison, Wisconsin. Finally in February 2021, Plough\nPublishing House based in New York, released Freiheit! The White\nRose Graphic Novel. Despite the passage of time and the distance\nof Europe, the legacy of the White Rose inspires Germans and\nAmericans alike. We remain connected in hope and humanity. 427\nAppendix A\nSelf-reflect, join the narrative, and share their story\n\u201cCarry on what we began.\u201d\n\u201cWeitertragen, was wir begonnen haben.\u201d\nWilli Graf on the day of his execution. He was 25 years old.\nOctober 12, 1943\nWilli Graf was the last of the Munich students to be\nexecuted by the Nazis. Of those who were executed in\n1943, he spent the longest time in prison as well (8\nmonths). He didn\u2019t ask, \u201cWhat can be done?\u201d He asked,\n\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d Here are examples of what he did.\n\u2022 As a teenager, he refused to join the Hitler Youth and\njoined illegal Catholic youth groups instead.\n\u2022 He refused to enroll in the liberal arts, his ideal\nuniversity curriculum, and chose medical studies\ninstead because they were less Nazified.\n\u2022 Throughout his short life, he refused to relinquish his\nfreedom of thought and read books and authors banned\nby the Nazis.\n\u2022 He refused to take a life and served as a combat\nparamedic when drafted by the German army. He was\nalso a member of the German Red Cross.\n\u2022 When deployed to the Russian front twice during the\nSecond World War, he refused to treat innocent 428\ncivilians as the enemy and helped them at risk of severe\nreprimand/punishment by his military superiors.\n\u2022 When arrested and interrogated by the Gestapo after the\nWhite Rose members were apprehended in February\n1943, Willi Graf refused to cooperate and give up the\nnames of his friends whom he had contacted or\nrecruited. He spared their lives at the expense of his\nown.\nQuestions for consideration\nThe White Rose students had no formal authority or\npositional power.

Philip Drell related to me\nand then to my students that when he served in the SPECOU Unit\nfor the U.S. Army during the Second World War, American troops\nwere still segregated and would not be desegregated until 1948.\nLargely, Black soldiers who served in the French Armed Forces\nwere not segregated but faced discrimination, abuse, and lack of\nrecognition for their bravery and service in the war. The German\nmilitary targeted black soldiers, no matter what Allied country they\ncame from. In one example, Trouillard (2020) explained that\nduring World War One, Black soldiers were falsely accused of war\ncrimes and crimes against humanity, including mass murder and\nrape, and these lies were used as anti-Black propaganda during the\nSecond World War. Noted that German troops especially targeted\nBlack soldiers, which led to the start of events of 19 June 1940,\nknown as the Chasselay massacre:\nAfter the Wehrmacht won the first battles in the afternoon,\nthey executed French as well as African prisoners. But on 446\nthe next day \u2013 after the last pockets of resistance were\ndefeated \u2013 they divided the prisoners into two: The French\non one side, the Africans on the other. They led the latter\ndown an isolated road. They were sent to a field and\nmachine-gunned.\u201d During these massacres, some French\nsoldiers were also executed or wounded for trying to\nintervene. The Senegalese riflemen\u2019s' bodies were left on\nthe ground. Despite the Germans forbidding it, people from\nChasselay buried the remains in a mass grave. One man\nthen took an interest in their fate: Jean-Baptiste Marchiani,\nhead of the local office for victims of the war. In the\nsummer of 1940, he offered to give them a proper burial,\nsuggesting a memorial in the model of an African cemetery\nusing red ochre. (Trouillard, 2020, paras. 10-11).\nWhen Drell and the SPECOU unit took part in the liberation of\nFrance, they met with a group of French soldiers. Drell and his\nteam took many pictures, including the Black soldiers serving for\nFrance that they met up with outside of Paris. Drell insisted that\nthey stay in the pictures, noting that the Black Allied soldiers 447\ntaking part in the capture of the German soldiers was, in part, some\nsmall justice. In the three pictures below, courtesy of the Drell\nfamily, he explained the purpose of these images:\nA few weeks after the liberation of Paris, Allied troops\nsurrounded 20,000 Germans. We went down to photograph\nthe proceedings. Unfortunately, the Germans refused to\nsurrender. But when we said we were leaving, they said,\n\u201cWell, wouldn\u2019t you care to be our guests?\u201d So we were\nguests of the German Army for about a week. They cleaned\nup the chateau they gave us, and they brought in food\u2014\nchickens and so forth\u2014which they cooked for us. I told\nthem that Jewish Law requires a certain way of killing the\nchicken. I wanted the Germans to know I was Jewish.\n\u00a9Phil Drell (Drell, 2008)\nNote to the reader: in the third image, Philip is wearing a top hat,\nkneeling with a sword on the lower right-hand side of the picture.\nExcluding Drell and the Black soldiers, the rest of the white people\nin the images were captured Germans. Drell told the German 448\nsoldiers to smile for the camera. Images courtesy and permission for use\nin this OER only, the Drell family 449\nReferences\nDrell, P. (2008).

As Zane\n(2019) explained, Black people, who saw themselves as Germans,\nsuffered under the Nazis, were subjected to the Nuremberg Laws,\nand could be arrested for engaging in relations with white people.\nThe United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (2022) stated that\nBlacks were sterilized, subjected to arrest, prohibited from\nbecoming involved with white Germans and even banned from\nperforming in public venues excepting state-mandated\npropagandistic films. Additionally, Zane (2019) revealed that\nunder Nazi rule, Black-Germans became stateless and prohibited\nfrom most work and education. Children also suffered.\nAfter 1941, Black children \u2013 and adults - as the United\nStates Holocaust Memorial Museum (2022) further explained,\nwere not allowed to attend schools in Germany. Black children,\nteenagers, and adults, as Zane (2019) revealed, were forced to\nundergo sterilization beginning in 1937, stating that an estimated\n385 Black-Germans were sterilized. Zane explained that the 452\nsterilized people were then forced to sign documents that mandated\nthat they not engage in sexual relations with any whites or marry a\nwhite German. Black-Germans were also subjected to public\natrocities.\nReucher (2019) related the story of Theodor Wonja\nMichael, born in Germany in 1925, to a mother who was a white\nGerman and a father who was Cameroonian. For decades,\npredating the Nazis in Germany and other countries, Reucher\n(2019) explained, Black-Germans and people of other races were\ndisplayed in zoos, as Michael\u2019s parents forced him and his siblings\nto do. Further,\nas a young boy, Theodor Wonja Michael also had to\nperform in raffia skirts as a \"typical African.\" It was a\nterrible time for him and his siblings, he told DW in a 2017\ninterview: \"People would smell me to check if I was real\nand talked to me in broken German or with signs. Michael's\nfamily was torn apart after the death of his mother when he\nwas only a one-year-old. A court determined that the father\ncouldn't properly raise his four children, and operators of a 453\nhuman zoo officially became young Theodor's foster\nparents in the 1920s. \"Their only interest in us was for our\nlabor\" Michael said (Reucher, 2019, paras. 5-6).\nAdditionally, Reucher (2019) noted that Michael spoke about how\nonce the Nazis came to power, Black-German rights were further\neroded, and it was the Nuremberg Laws that banned him and other\nBlacks from going to school; Michael recounted that to avoid\nbeing charged with racial violations, he avoided all contact with\nwhites. However, when Michael found work as an actor under the\nfilm offices of Joseph Goebbels, the Reichsminister f\u00fcr\nPropaganda [Reich Minister for Propaganda], Black-German\nactors could then interact with whites, but only for supervised\nfilmic purposes.\nGoebbels\u2019s office routinely cast Black-German actors in\npropaganda films, as Michael had been, which the United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum (2022) also discussed, relating that\n\u201ca notable exception to the ban was made for the film industry.\nBlack men, women, and children were allowed to appear in\npropaganda films which served the purpose of promoting the Nazi 454\nworldview\u201d (United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 2022,\npara. 37). However, outside of filmic interactions under strict\nguidelines, avoidance of whites was necessary for the survival of\nBlack-Germans, as Michael could have been arrested, forcibly\nsterilized, or even killed.\nOften Black people in Germany went missing, with a fate\nunknown; Zane (2019) noted that dozens of Black-Germans were\nsent to Nazi camps, including Dachau, the first Nazi concentration\ncamp. Black-Germans were classified by the Nazis as asocial and\nsubjected to racial laws that targeted Jews, Roma, and others. Was\nit a goal of the Nazis to kill all Black-Germans or Blacks residing\nin Nazi-occupied countries? Zane suggested that sometime in\n1942, Heinrich Himmler, \u201cone of the architects of the Holocaust,\nordered a census of the Black people living in Germany. This\ncould indicate the beginnings of a plan of mass murder, though no\nsuch plan was ever put in place\u201d (Zane, 2019, para. 44), suggesting\nto us that in the scaffolding of Nazi intent, Blacks were to be\npossibly exterminated after the Jews and others were eliminated.\nReferences 455\nPosner, D.

However, once the Nazis came to power on 30 January\n1933, it was no longer safe for Black-Americans to be in Nazi\nGermany because of racial laws against Jews, Blacks, and other\npeople, including the Roma. When the Nuremberg Laws were\npassed in September 1935, it was virtually impossible for Black-\nAmericans to find work or to live in peace and security.\nHowever, some Black-Americans went to Germany in the\n1930s, including W.E.B. Du Bois, who visited in 1936, the same\nyear Nazi Germany held the Summer Olympics. Du Bois was\nstruck by the fact that \u201clife was less restrictive for him as a Black\nvisitor in Nazi Germany than it was for him in many parts of the\nUnited States.\u201d (USHMM, 2023, para. 14). Du Bois, the United\nStates Holocaust Memorial Museum (2023) further explained,\nwrote a column about antisemitism in Nazi Germany, exposing 457\nwhat was happening in the country, but as the United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum related, his experiences intersected\nwith the racism he faced in his country of residence, the United\nStates. Once the war began, everything shifted, and no Black-\nAmerican resident in Nazi Germany or Black Allied soldier would\nindeed be safe if captured by the Nazis. Black-Germans and some\nBlack-Americans were ostracized, punished severely, and sent to\nconcentration camps.\nDuring the Second World War, if captured by the Axis,\nNazi Germany, Black-American GIs were persecuted, tortured, and\nmurdered by the German Armed Forces and members of the SS;\nyet, their stories have typically not been present in more extensive\nscholarship. When the book Breath of Freedom was published, it\nwas groundbreaking because it covered the history of over\n1,000,000 Black-American soldiers who fought to liberate the\nworld from the Axis when the US Armed Forces were still\nsegregated. Significantly, historians, Denise George and Robert\nChild noted that the German Army killed eleven Black-American 458\nsoldiers, and the United States government allegedly hid the truth\nabout their deaths for over seventy years:\nmore than seven decades ago, on December 17, 1944,\neleven Black-American GIs, were butchered in an isolated\ncow pasture in Wereth, Belgium, by a four-man German\npatrol of the 1st SS Division. Two months later, on\nFebruary 15, a twelve-year-old Belgian boy, Hermann\nLanger, discovered the frozen bodies rotting in the melting\nsnow. When U.S. officials examined the remains, they\nfound multiple stab wounds, gouged eyes, shattered skulls,\nbroken bones, and severed fingers, injuries meant to torture\nthe men before the final kill. The dead men\u2019s pockets\ncontained small bibles, letters and photographs from loved\nones, a silver cross, and a broken diamond engagement\nring. After a four-day investigation, Col. Burton Ellis\nclosed the files, marking them \u201csecret,\u201d and burying them\nin the National Archives, where they gathered dust for 70\nyears. No one was ever brought to justice for the crimes.\nTheir tragedy was omitted from the final congressional war 459\nCrimes Report of 1949, which recorded the names of all\nmassacred victims\u2014both civilian and military\u2014and where\neach crime took place. (George & Child, 2017, para. 1)\nH\u00f6hn (2008) argued that while white Americans were mainly\nquick to condemn Hitler and Nazi racism, most did nothing to fight\nagainst Jim Crow. The continuation of the denunciation of what\nthe Axis was doing, yet the American silence on the treatment of\nBlack-Americans at home, was a shame on society.\nMoreover, as H\u00f6hn (2008) and Dickerson (2019)\nexplained, in the United States, Black-American GIs were chosen\nspecifically because of their race for medical experimentation in\nwhich included barbaric chemical experiments. Dickerson (2019)\nrevealed that the American military had gas chambers, where\n60,000 Black-American GIs (Puerto Rican and Japanese-\nAmericans were also victimized in this way) were interred in the\nchambers, and then poisons such as mustard gas were released;\nwhen and if the men survived, their bodies were tested for the\nreactions that the gasses had on their skins. Note that the Nazis 460\nalso used gas chambers and killed millions in this way. Consider\nthen, after the war ended,\nthe military occupation of Germany by American troops\nelicited two striking responses that were organized around\nirony and issues of race. One came from Germans, who\nnoted with incredulity and derision that they were being\ndemocratized by a nation \u2026 with a host of\nantimiscegenation laws at home. The second came from\nAfrican American GIs who, in their interactions with\nGermans, were stunned by the apparent absence of racism\nin the formerly fascist land and, comparing their reception\nwith treatment by white Americans, experienced their stay\nthere as unexpectedly liberatory. Both responses criticized\nthe glaring gap between democratic American principles\nand practices; both exposed as false the universalist\nlanguage employed by the United States government to\ncelebrate and propagate its political system and social\nvalues at home and abroad (Fehrenbach, 2005, p. 17). 461\nThus, we can conclude Germany was now a nation that was rid of\nHitler and was, on its surface, more accepting of Black-American\nGIs than the country they served: the United States of America.\nReferences\nDickerson, C.

Drell would often\ncome to Oakton and show his images of World War Two. These\nimages were taken from when he was in the U.S. Army as part of\nthe SPECOU unit. The SPECOU unit had special orders from\nGeneral Dwight D. Eisenhower. What this meant was that the\nSPECOU unit was unattached to a specific unit and could, as Drell\nsaid once in a lecture at Oakton, go anywhere \u201cwhere the action\nwas.\u201d\nHe was a master photographer, capturing the world through\nhis lens, from Camp Henry Horner to World War Two. Drell\ndocumented the liberation of the beaches in Normandy, France, to\nthe liberation of camps and Berlin's fall. He used both moving and 464\nstill film to document what he witnessed. Drell had said that after\nfilming the war, the motion picture film was immediately sent back\nto the U.S. government. However, he took still images of his\nwitness, which formed the basis for many exhibitions and student\npresentations.\nI loved hearing his stories, especially the ones about then-\nSenator John F. Kennedy and Hollywood star Doris Day. Day was\nin Chicago for a movie premiere, Drell recalled, but would not\nleave her hotel suite unless someone could watch her pets. A fan\nclub member was called, agreed to watch Day's pets, and the\npremiere went on.\nDrell also had great stories about Ernest Hemingway, his\nfriend Irwin Shaw, and many other famous figures. He\ndocumented an attempted assassination attempt on General Charles\nde Gaulle. On the 25th of August 1944, the day that Paris was\nliberated, Drell also took the surrender of several hundred German\nsoldiers in Paris, speaking Yiddish to them while holding up his\ncamera. Irwin Shaw wrote a book called Paris, Paris. In this book,\nShaw documented how Drell, all alone, took the surrender of this 465\ngroup of German soldiers. Drell had told the Germans \u2013 in Yiddish\n\u2013 to walk out slowly so that he could take their pictures. Drell also\ntold students how he took part in another surrender of German\ntroops in the south of France. There was a meal being served to the\nGerman troops, and in that context of the surrender and the dinner,\nDrell revealed he was Jewish.\nAfter his passing, I have continually included his slides in\nlectures in tribute to him to honor Drell. I also show D-Day to\nBerlin, a documentary that highlights the SPECOU unit's work,\nalso known as the Stevens Irregulars, that Drell was part of. The\nman in charge of the SPECOU unit was George Stevens, who\ndirected dozens of films, notably Giant and The Diary of Anne\nFrank. If you ever watch D-Day to Berlin, look for Drell\nreading Life or in many other scenes. Hundreds of students have\nseen his work through my lens, and I try my best to recall minutiae\nas Drell presented it. He also loved to read, and as I have many of\nhis books, I think he would be pleased to know how many students\nhave benefited from them.

Ameen had an idea to honor\nDrell. He put together a photographic exhibit displayed at Oakton's\nSkokie campus. In May of 2019, along with a presentation by\nMagda Brown, a dear friend, and a survivor, Ameen presented his\nwork on Drell. His wife Wini, and his daughter Robi, are my dear\nfriends and graciously agreed to spend time with Ameen to review\nhis presentation. Here are Ameen's recollections of that day. The\npicture of the camera is one that Drell used to document the war. 472\nPhilip Drell: The Liberator and Documentarian\nAmeen Khan\nThe Holocaust was an extremely dark period of time when\nmillions of Jewish and other peoples were oppressed, tortured, and\nviciously murdered. Adolf Hitler, Germany\u2019s Nazi party leader,\nand his soldiers carried out one of the largest mass genocides in\nhistory. They brutally tortured millions of Jewish people before\nthey would mercilessly murder them. While today we have a great\ndeal of information on what exactly transpired during the\nHolocaust and the horrors that came of it, it is impossible truly to\nput into words the senseless and barbaric actions that took place\nduring World War II. The most valuable documentation of the\nHolocaust we have is the powerful, heart-wrenching photographs\nthat remind us how important it is never to forget the events that 473\ntranspired between the years 1938-1945. While the Holocaust was\na dark and horrific period of time, it also serves as a reminder that\nthere is good in people, even in the darkest of times. There were\nmany heroes during the Holocaust that risked their own lives,\nintending to rescue as many Jewish people as possible. One of\nthese heroes was a man named Philip Drell, a photographer during\nthe Holocaust, who will always be remembered for his bravery and\nselflessness during a very dark period of time.\nPhilip Drell, born in Chicago, IL, in 1919, was assigned to\nthe Special Motion Pictures Coverage Unit (SPECOU) when he\nwas enlisted in the army back in September of 1942. Philip Drell\nwas assigned to film and document special events such as the\nBattle of the Bulge and the liberation of Paris. A few weeks after\nthe liberation of Paris, Philip Drell and his unit went to capture\nphotographs of Allied troops surrounding 20,000 Germans. The\nGermans refused to surrender and took Philip Drell and his unit in\nas guests for a week. While Philip Drell was in the care of the\nGerman army, he was strong-willed and wanted them to know that\nhe was of the Jewish faith. However, it was not until Philip Drell\u2019s 474\nunit moved through France and into Germany after they had\ndocumented the invasion of Normandy that he would witness the\nhorrors of the Holocaust. On April 29, 1945, Philip Drell and his\nunit arrived at the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp. He\ntook photographs in the Dachau concentration camps and\nwitnessed some of the most unspeakable acts of violence that no\none should ever have to witness. Some of the photographs that he\nhad captured depicted hundreds of dead bodies of Jewish prisoners\npiled upon each other. It is estimated that 25,000 people died at the\nDachau concentration camp. While extremely difficult to look at,\nthe photographs themselves are essential pieces of history that\nshow us honestly how much pain and suffering Jewish people had\nto endure during the Holocaust.\nAfter years of being mentally and physically tortured by\nHitler and the Nazi regime, the Jewish prisoners of Dachau were\nliberated by the U.S. Seventh Army\u2019s 45th Infantry Division in\nApril of 1945. The concentration camp was filled with thousands\nof dead bodies; however, there were roughly 30,000 survivors that\nwere liberated, many of whom were severely malnourished. Philip 475\nDrell, along with his SPECOU unit, spent time documenting the\nhorrors that had taken place at the camp.\nOne of the photographs that Philip Drell captured was of a\nNazi guard that was beaten to death by one of the liberated\nprisoners in the act of rage. The amount of emotional and physical\nabuse that these prisoners were put through is unfathomable.\nAnother photograph that Philip Drell managed to capture, shortly\nafter the liberation, was a truckload of bread for the survivors.\nUnfortunately, due to severe malnourishment, some of them could\nnot tolerate solid food and died as a result. Since many could not\ntolerate the bread, they were given soup to nourish them for a\nwhile. Unfortunately, many of the liberated survivors still did not\nsurvive due to the extreme torture that they had suffered.\nDuring my time at Oakton College, I can without a doubt\nsay that taking Professor Adele-Marie\u2019s, History of the Holocaust\ncourse was one of the best decisions I have ever made. Before\ntaking this course, I had a fundamental understanding of the events\nthat transpired during the Holocaust; however, after taking this 476\ncourse, it has immensely expanded my knowledge of the subject\nand changed how I view certain things.\nWhenever I thought about the Holocaust, I associated everything\nand everyone with as completely evil without having a broader\nunderstanding of it. This course taught me that even in the darkest\nof times, people such as Philip Drell would do anything they can to\nshed some light on the atrocities humans can perpetrate. In 2019, I\nhad the privilege of creating and displaying memorial artwork that\nshowcased a few of the photographs that Philip Drell captured\nduring the Holocaust. I also had the honor of meeting and speaking\nto the wife and daughter of Philip Drell, Wini and Robi Drell, who\ncould not have been more helpful and gracious with their time.\nFinally, I want to thank Professor Adele-Marie, Wini Drell, and\nRobi Drell for taking the time out of their busy schedules and\nanswering any questions on Philip Drell. Philip Drell is a man who\nwill always be remembered for his courage, bravery, and\nselflessness. He serves as a reminder that good people will shine\ntheir light even in the darkest of times. 477\nPatton: Building of a Great Military Leader\nBrian D. Naimola\nGeneral George S. Patton Jr. was a complicated\nleader. He had the talent to motivate and inspire soldiers like no\nother leader, but he also had the temperament to degrade and go\nagainst the norm. He had a flair for leadership that was direct and\nbordered on unforgiving; nevertheless, he truly cared for his\nsoldiers. His rigid toughness and self-sacrifice prompted pride\nwithin his command. However, his aggressive acts and volatile\ntemper led to many controversies throughout his career. He was a\nreligious man who read the Bible often and could recite many\npassages, but his frequent use of profanity was unparalleled.\nAlthough these complications may be accurate, General Patton\u2019s\nearlier life built an incomparable leader.\nThe building blocks of General Patton\u2019s early childhood\nestablished his leadership characteristics. His family upbringing is\nthe primary building block, followed by his educational\nexperiences. Building on that foundation, he continued to add\nleadership responsibilities throughout his career. Patton established 478\nand continually refined his unique set of leadership characteristics.\nThese leadership characteristics eventually allowed Patton to\nbecome a great military leader.\nEarly Life\nGeorge S. Patton Jr. was born to an affluent family and\nenjoyed a privileged upbringing. Early in his life, he had\ndifficulties in reading and writing. Dyslexia and Attention Deficit\nDisorder (ADD) potentially contributed to his low ability to read\nand write (Blumenson, 1985). Blumenson highlighted that little\nwas known at this time in history about these Learning Disabilities\n(LD), so Patton was never officially diagnosed with a learning\ndisability. Throughout these early years, his aunt and parents\ndevoted a significant amount of time reading to him and telling\nhim stories. Many of these stories involved the discussions of his\nmilitary foregathers and the Bible (Blumenson, 1985).\nDue to his inability to read and write and not wanting him\nto have to deal with cruel classmates, Blumenson (1985) also\ncommented that Mama and Papa kept Patton out of the school\nsystem until he was 11 years old. At that time, he began his formal 479\neducation. Patton first attended Steven Cutter Clark\u2019s Classical\nSchool for Boys, then Virginia Military Institute, and finally, West\nPoint before officially entering the Army (Hirshson, 2002).\nFamily\nFamily structure and upbringing shape our adult life.\nBakhsh et al. (2018) observed that personal traits mature when\nparents oversee the child\u2019s learning. Vries and Treacy (1999)\nasserted that early years and family are significant life factors that\nsignificantly influence personal characteristics, notably leadership\ncapabilities. Patton\u2019s family life helped form the distinctive\nleadership style he exercised later in life.\nAunt Annie (Nannie). One of the more unusual fixtures in\nthe Patton house was Patton\u2019s Aunt Nannie. When Ruth Wilson\nmarried George Patton II, her sister, Annie, affixed herself to the\nmarried couple and became like a surrogate mother and spoiled the\nyoung Patton (The National Interest, 2020). Nannie was the Patton\nhousehold dictatorial ruler and did not allow Patton to be punished,\nas reported by The National Interest (2020). The National Interest\nalso observes that Nannie read the Bible to Patton for up to four 480\nhours daily. From these readings, Jesus emerged as the\nprototypical example of human courage.\nMother. Ruth Wilson (Mama) hailed from an affluent\nfamily and married George Patton II on December 10, 1884\n(Hirshson, 2002). The bond between Mama and son was not as\nstrong as the bond he shared with Papa. Nightly, Patton gave his\nmother one good night kiss but then showered his father with many\nkisses (Blumenson, 1985). Mama was very protective of her son\nand did not want Patton to go to school until later than most\nchildren in an attempt to shield him from being ridiculed for his\nlack of reading and writing abilities.\nFather. George Patton II (Papa) was a graduate of the\nVirginia Military Institute (VMI) before making his way to\nCalifornia with his wife, Ruth. Hirshson (2002) note that Patton\u2019s\nfather spent several terms as the district attorney of Los Angeles\nand had ineffective attempts at running for other public offices,\nincluding one as a Congressional Democratic candidate. When\nPatton was born in 1885, Papa gave up practicing law and took 481\nover his father-in-law\u2019s business to save it from another relative\u2019s\nmishandling.\nBlumenson (1985) reported that there was a healthy and\nclose bond between Papa and his son. He pointed out that Patton\nwould wield a wooden sword that Papa had carved for him, and the\ntwo would play soldiers often. Also, every day, Papa would salute\nPatton and ask how the private was doing. Papa taught Patton how\nto ride a horse in the horse saddle from which his late Grandfather,\nColonel George S. Patton, was fatally wounded during the Civil\nWar. Papa also spent much time reading to him from Greek\nMythology, William Shakespeare, and Sir Walter Scott, and he\nwould also tell military stories based on his ancestry (Blumenson,\n1985).\nMilitary Influences at a young age\nDue to Patton\u2019s early life\u2019s influence, Patton believed that\nhe would be a General someday, predisposed by his father\u2019s stories\nof the heroic ancestors that preceded Patton. Blumenson (1985)\npoints out that Papa was an excellent storyteller and would speak\nof extravagant and possibly inflated tales of his forefathers, 482\nincluding Robert Patton, a Brigadier General, a friend of George\nWashington who fought in the Revolutionary War. Also, he would\nspeak of the six great-uncles who were Confederate Soldiers in the\nCivil War; and their brother, Patton\u2019s Grandfather, who was fatally\nwounded while fighting with his troops. In addition to these great\nPatton soldiers, Blumenson also suggests that there were several of\nPatton\u2019s cousins that Papa would tell tales of who held high ranks\nwithin the military. Papa also had a short military career. Through\nall of these real-life heroes, Papa was able to tell the tales of war,\ncourage, and gallantry.\nMama\u2019s side of the family also contributed to Patton\u2019s\nmilitary influences. The National Interest (2020) indicates that\namong the living military benchmarks was Patton\u2019s step-\ngrandfather, Colonel George Hugh Smith, whose accounts of the\nCivil War introduced a deep sense of purpose in Patton.\nBlumenson (1985) observes that Smith might have been the most\nsignificant influence on Patton\u2019s determination to become a soldier\nand continue the family\u2019s military heritage. Blumenson (1985)\nstates that Patton idolized his military forefathers, and what Patton 483\nfeared the most was to discredit himself in their eyes by coming up\nshort of their standards.\nSchooling\nBesides what a student learns from books, schools shape\nhow students act, what they are, and whom they will grow into\nover a period of time. Riley (2019) notes that a student\u2019s ability to\nfit into school is \u201cshaped by what they bring to it \u2013 their histories,\ntheir day-to-day lived realities \u2013 as well as schools\u2019 practices and\nexpectations\u201d (p. 96). Different types of environments enable\nstudents to experience various kinds of learning and different\nexperiences for students. Patton experienced an eclectic range of\nschooling experiences, including homeschooling, private school,\nand military education. Even with his learning disabilities, he\nsurvived the rigors of schooling.\nLearning Disabilities. Merriam-Webster (2020) defines\ndyslexia as \u201ca learning disability involving difficulties in acquiring\nand processing language typically manifested by a lack of\nproficiency in reading, spelling, and writing.\u201d Hirshson (2002)\nexplains that Patton could neither read nor write until he was 484\nalmost twelve years old. However, Patton could recite from\nmemory Bible passages, poetry, and large portions of history.\nDyslexia is not just a matter of inverting letters and numbers but is\na complex condition whose symptoms include hyperactivity,\nintolerance, attitude swings, and recklessness. In a letter Patton\nwrote to his future wife, while he was a West Point Cadet, he\ncalled attention to his dyslexia, saying, \u201cit is beastly hard for me to\nlearn\u201d (Dietrich, 1989, p. 389). Patton recognized his reading and\nwriting limitations while in school, but he continued to push\nhimself to overcome and eventually became an avid reader.\nBlumenson (1985) also emphasizes that Patton had another\nlearning disability, which eventually came to be known as\nAttention Deficit Disorder (ADD), a neurological-chemical\ncondition. Merriam-Webster (2020) notes that individuals with\nADD show signs of hyperactivity and impulsivity. The National\nInterest (2020) points out that other ADD symptoms include\ncompulsiveness, extreme mood swings, and bad tempers. Patton\nexhibited these symptoms even at an early age. Costello and Stone\n(2012) maintain that individuals with these learning disabilities 485\ntend to avoid events where they feel inadequate and become\nfrustrated but overcompensate these issues by achieving in other\nareas. Blumenson (1985) suggests that Papa and Mama hired tutors\nto help Patton overcome his learning disabilities. Once they were\ncomfortable with his reading and writing abilities, they sent him to\nprivate school.\nPrivate school. Dietrich (1989) points out that Patton\nbegan his schooling at Stephen Clark\u2019s Classical School for Boys.\nPatton spent six years getting an excellent private school education\nfulfilling his high school requirements. He was a hardworking\nstudent who struggled with many of his subjects because of his\ndyslexia. Dietrich also pointed out that Patton meticulously made\nmany annotations throughout his books, possibly to make up for\nhis dyslexia.\nMilitary schools. After graduating from Stephen Clark\u2019s\nClassical School for Boys, Patton went on to VMI for one year.\nBlumenson and Hymel (2008) note that at VMI, Patton was in\n\u201cPatton country,\u201d as VMI is where his father and Grandfather and\nsix of his great uncles had all attended school. The National 486\nInterest (2020) emphasizes that even with Patton\u2019s average school\nrecord at the Classical School for Boys, it was a given that Patton\nwould be admitted into VMI as there had been a Patton presence at\nVMI since its founding.\nPatton started to come into his own at VMI. The college\u2019s\natmosphere was an excellent opportunity to begin acclimating to\nthe military mindset. What he did at VMI would pave his way to\nWest Point. National Interest (2020) also pointed out that even\nthough his academic grades were average, he was applying himself\nwith passion, and his military work surpassed his VMI classmates.\nBlumenson and Hymel (2008) pointed out how hard Papa worked\nhis political allies to include Judge Harry Lee and Senator Barb to\nget Patton\u2019s appointment to West Point. Like his time at VMI,\nBlumenson and Hymel also remark that after getting to West Point,\nPatton excelled in the military aspects but was just middle of the\nroad from an academic point of view.\nLeeman (2015) indicates that Patton had a few setbacks in\nhis first year, as he failed mathematics and then had to repeat a\nyear. Leeman also noted that Patton was demoted from First 487\nCorporal to Sixth Corporal after failing to follow directions and\nprotocol by putting more of his men on report than his fellow\nCorporals. Even with these setbacks, Patton was coming into his\nelement and eventually graduated with West Point\u2019s second-\nhighest rank of corporal adjutant (National Interest, 2020). Patton\u2019s\nunique decisions and break in protocol while at West Point began\nto establish his leadership style that would be evident throughout\nthe remainder of his military career\nLeadership\nLeadership is complex to explain with a singular definition.\nThe understanding of leadership is generally known; however, no\ntwo descriptions are precisely the same. To search for the\n\u201cdefinition of leadership,\u201d on April 11, 2020, Google yielded about\n1,800,000,000 results. In its purest form, Merriam-Webster (2020)\ndefines leadership as \u201cthe act or an instance of leading.\u201d Even\nthough leadership is unique to every person, some common ways\nand characteristics define the term.\nMilitary Leadership 488\nThere are specific military leadership characteristics that\nhave demonstrated themselves time and again. The Army defines\nleadership as \u201cthe process of influencing people by providing\npurpose, direction, and motivation to accomplish the mission and\nimprove the organization\u201d (Department of the Army, 2019, p. 1\u2013\n3). The military builds and continuously refines individuals\u2019\nleadership skills. Patton exemplified these sound leadership\ncharacteristics.\nLeadership Characteristics\nLeadership characteristics are traits that define successful\nleaders. Leaders need to perfect and cultivate these characteristics\nto have an impact on the individuals they lead. Successful leaders\nmust possess these traits to reach the highest levels of leadership.\nPatton uniquely epitomized these leadership characteristics.\nMaxwell\u2019s Leadership Attributes\nIn Developing the Leader Within You 2.0, John Maxwell\n(2018) identified eight components of leadership characteristics\nthat define a leader\u2019s success. Possessing these characteristics can\nmake the difference between ordinary leaders and great leaders. He 489\nobserves that \u201cleadership can be developed\u201d (p. ix). Some\nindividuals are born with these characteristics, but Patton\ndeveloped these traits and refined them throughout his life.\nInfluence. Maxwell (2018), in quoting John C. Georges,\n\u201cLeadership is the ability to obtain followers\u201d (p. 3). If no one\nwants to follow a leader in the first place, they are not a true leader.\nThe ability to influence is to affect the actions and opinions of\nothers into following. It is also about understanding what motivates\nindividuals and using that understanding to leverage their\nperformance. When looking at leadership as the ability to influence\nothers towards achieving a common goal, it becomes apparent that\ninfluence is the foundation of leadership. Patton had a fantastic\nability to influence his soldiers. Major Isaac White illustrates this:\n[Patton] really inspired everybody with the idea that when\nyou have gone just as far as you can go, you can still go a\nlittle bit further. You might not have loved him, but you\nrespected him and admired him, and you wanted to put out\nfor him. Every unit in the division developed a very fierce 490\nand intense pride in its accomplishments. (as cited in\nAxelrod, 1999, p.183)\nLeaders must lead from the front and motivate their Soldiers to\nfollow.\nMajor White\u2019s analysis shows the epitome of Patton\u2019s\nability to obtain followers. Patton\u2019s men believed that when a\nperson gives their all, they always had more to deliver. Patton\nunderstood how to motivate and get the most out of the Soldiers.\nPatton led by example and would not put his soldiers in a position\nthat he felt they could not win. Patton always showed pride in his\norganizations. Patton\u2019s pride was infectious, causing his soldiers to\nfollow him into intense war situations out of personal satisfaction\nand dedication.\nPriorities. Maxwell (2018) notes that leaders look forward\nand prioritize requirements. Thought-out priorities enable leaders\nto ascertain the most significant priorities and where they need to\nfocus their attention. Successful leaders prioritize based on the\nfollowing principles: 491\nSmarter over Harder. Working smarter over harder\ngenerally means thinking through projects to minimize steps so\nthat individuals are using their time effectively. Maxwell (2018)\nnotes that it is \u201cfinding better ways to work and making the most\nof the moments you have\u201d (p. 30). Williamson (2009) summed up\nPatton\u2019s working smarter, not harder mentality in remembering\nPatton\u2019s words \u201cWhen you make a mistake in war, the punishment\nis death! The trouble in your mistake could cause hundreds of\nsoldiers to die\u201d (p.54). It is better to teach the team the best way to\nwork, not to lose productivity from a leadership perspective. The\nemphasis should be on focusing on the proper requirements at the\nright time or experiencing consequences in the long run.\nYou Can\u2019t Have It All. Maxwell (2018) notes that to be\nsuccessful, individuals need to make tough choices and prioritize.\nAxelrod (1999) alludes to the \u201cyou cannot have it all\u201d theme with a\nPatton quote of \u201cA good plan, violently executed now, is better\nthan a perfect plan next week\u201d (p. 130). As a General Officer with\nthe responsibility of thousands of soldiers, Patton often had to\nmake judgments based on what information was available at that 492\ntime. However, he knew he had to decide and execute the best he\ncould with the limited information; otherwise, the enemy would\nhave an opportunity to destroy them. Leadership is about\nestablishing a level of balance.\nBest over Good. Maxwell (2018) observes that sometimes\nleaders need to forego the good and go for the best. Axelrod (1999)\nestablishes that Patton lectured, \u201cMan is the only war machine.\nAlways remember that man is the only machine that can win the\nwar. It\u2019s nice to have good equipment, but man is the key\u201d (p.\n145). Patton understood that the best thing he had going for him\nwas his Soldiers. With all the technology in the world, men are still\nrequired to use that technology.\nProactive over Reactive. Maxwell (2018) highlights that\n\u201cto be an effective leader, you need to be proactive\u201d and also notes\nthat \u201creactive means losing\u201d (p. 32). Axelrod (1999) highlights a\nproactive versus reactive Patton leadership characteristic quote in\n\u201cWe are not going to dig any foxholes and wait for the enemy to\ncome shootin\u2019 at us. We will be shootin\u2019 at them first\u201d (p.53).\nFrom the quote, Patton shows that he is about pushing forward and 493\nnot allowing his soldier to sit back and react. Patton\u2019s leadership\nphilosophy showed that attacking the problem and being proactive\nencourages the soldiers to move and progress.\nCharacter. Maxwell (2018) notes that within a character is\ntrust and that \u201ctrust is a relationship between a trustor and a\ntrustee\u201d (p. 53). Without trust, even if people follow a leader today,\nthey will not follow for long. With as brash as Patton was, he built\nan extreme level of trust within his organizations. He had the\nhighest confidence and trust in his soldiers to accomplish his\naudacious goals. Williamson (2009) pointed out that Patton would\nsay this about soldiers, \u201cthey will not trust you if you do not trust\nthem\u201d (p. 31). Trust is a critical component of character and goes\nto show that trust is a two-way street.\nPositive Change. People are not generally opposed to\nchange; they tend to refrain from being changed (Maxwell, 2018).\nChange requires individuals to get out of their safe havens and face\nnew circumstances. Williamson (2009) related a story of Patton\nand the necktie order with the I Armored Corps. Before Patton\ntook over command of the I Armored Corps, the soldiers were a 494\nragtag bunch that did not wear proper uniforms. Patton wanted his\nsoldiers to have pride in themselves and knew the change should\nstart with appearance. He lectured to the troops that pride builds\nconfidence, confidence builds courage, and courage builds a\nsignificant level of bravery. Immediately all soldiers were dressed\nbetter than the average soldier, which gave them the pride and\nstrength to walk tall. A key to successfully implementing positive\nchange is that leaders ensure they communicate ahead of time the\nchange\u2019s goal and why it is happening. Patton was successful in\ncommunicating and thus built a strong band of soldiers.\nProblem Solving. Successful leaders allow for problem-\nsolving at the lowest level (Maxwell, 2018). Leaders need to know\nhow to solve the issues and prioritize them, but more notably, they\nneed to delegate them. So, the task of a leader is to build\nconfidence in individuals to handle issues for themselves. Two\nnotable Patton quotes that epitomize his leadership belief in\nallowing for problem-solving at the lowest level is \u201cnever tell\npeople how to do things. Tell them what to do, and they will\nsurprise you with their ingenuity\u201d and \u201cif you tell people where to 495\ngo, but not how to get there, you\u2019ll be amazed at the results\u201d\n(Axelrod, 1999, pp. 165 & 167). These quotes showed that Patton\nhad trust in his soldiers. He was willing and confident to let his\nstaff solve problems creatively at the lowest possible level through\nhis military knowledge.\nAttitude. Maxwell (2018) notes that a \u201cleader\u2019s attitude\nmust exemplify resolve, tenacity, focus, determination, and\ncommitment\u201d (p. 121). It is an attitude that motivates and\nultimately sustains success. Axelrod (1999) highlighted a Patton\nquote that sums up his ideals with \u201cwe will win because we will\nnever lose. There can never be defeat if a man refuses to accept\ndefeat\u201d (p. 55). The attitude of a leader is what will drive the team\nto success versus failure. Successful leaders understand that the\ncorrect attitude will set the right tone, enabling the team\u2019s best\nresponse.\nServing People. Maxwell (2018) notes that \u201cleadership is\nbased on serving others, not ourselves\u201d (p. 146). Great leaders\nserve their followers. A common theme in the Army is that if\nleaders take care of their soldiers, the soldiers will, in turn, support 496\ntheir leader. Williamson (2009) explained how Patton was always\nconcerned about all his soldiers regardless of their rank or\nassignment. He also points out how Patton was adamant about his\nsoldiers not having to do things that were not essential to the\nmission. Servant leaders provide growth and opportunities for\nothers. Axelrod (1999) pointed out that Patton believed in training\na person to do his job then getting out of the way. Successful\nleaders prepare followers to take over their job.\nVision. A vision focuses on the future of the organization.\nSuccessful leaders have a vision of what they have to accomplish\nin supporting the mission. Maxwell (2018) explains that vision sets\nthe direction for which the team will follow. Patton was able to\ninspire his troops by proclaiming his vision in a style that only he\ncould do. \u201cThe very thought of losing is hateful to Americans. An\narmy is a team. It lives, eats, sleeps, and fights as a team. This\nindividuality stuff is a bunch of bullshit\u201d (Axelrod, 1999, p. 4).\nGreat leaders know how to inspire a team through a vision, and\nfrom that, they motivate others to follow.\nLiberation 497\nPatton was not only a complicated leader; he was also a\ncomplicated human being. Patton was not very sympathetic to the\nJewish community, but much credit is bestowed upon him in the\nliberation of the Buchenwald, Mauthausen-Gusen, Dachau, and\nsatellite camps (Laufer, 2018). Laufer explains that as many\nsurvivors were near death in these camps, Patton\u2019s Army\npenetrated deep into German territory and drove the German\u2019s\naway from the concentration camps.\nBuchenwald was the first concentration camp that Patton\u2019s\nSixth Armored Division liberated on April 11, 1945, where there\nwere 21,000 known survivors (Hirschman & Hill, 1996). Laufer\nreported that \u201cPatton was the miracle they prayed for\u201d (p.313).\nHirschman and Hill noted that as Patton\u2019s Sixth Armored Division\nwas driving towards the Buchenwald camp, the Nazis fled, and the\nconcentration camp survivors gathered up the weapons and took\ncontrol of the camp by 3:15 p.m. The Buchenwald clock tower\nremains forever fixed at 3:15 p.m., as this was when the camp was\nliberated (Rodden, 2005). As flawed as General Patton was, many\nconcentration camp survivors are devoted to him as they \u201cthought 498\ntheir lives were certainly over, only to be given a second chance by\na magnificent general\u201d (Washington Post, 2014).\nSummary\nPatton\u2019s early life shaped who he would become. Patton\nbecame one of the most outstanding military leaders ever known.\nPatton\u2019s learning disabilities (dyslexia and ADD), solid family\nstructure, forefathers, and schooling developed Patton into a\nsuccessful leader. Patton sought excellence and was never satisfied\nwith his performance. Patton\u2019s upbringing revolved around an\naffluent and caring family structure.\nPatton was well taken care of by his Papa, Mama, and Aunt\nNannie. These family members took much of their time to ensure\nPatton had a stable upbringing. The family often read and talked to\nPatton about his heroic forefathers due to his limited ability to\nlearn. Blumenson (1985) states that Patton thought that genetics\nplays a role in shaping a leader. Patton also believed that\nsuccessful military leaders were a blending of lineage and abilities.\nPatton was not flawless. Numerous faults sometimes tainted his\nleadership proficiencies, which were of the highest magnitude. 499\nPatton rose to be a fantastic but complicated leader when the Army\nneeded a leader with his leadership characteristics. His stern\ndiscipline, resilience, and selflessness elicited extraordinary pride\nwithin his troops.\nToday\u2019s Army would not have tolerated Patton, and he\nwould have been relieved from duty before he had to chance to\nbecome the military leader he was. Patton was not born to be a\nleader, but his life\u2019s experiences molded him into a great military\nleader with strong leadership characteristics.\nReferences\nAxelrod, A. (1999).

Two survivors who are no longer with us, but\nwho often spoke to my students, were Magda Brown and Yakov\nZakon. I know that they would love to be a part of this project if\nthey were with us. In their honor, and with the deepest gratitude to\nour three survivor contributors, I present to you their stories, from\nDeborah, Ralph, Yvonne, and Stella. All three have spoken to my\nstudents many times. Following their entries, we have an important\ncontribution on caring for Holocaust survivors from Adam Yunis.\nWe begin with Deborah, whose parents both survived the\nHolocaust, and she considers telling their stories a sacred\nobligation. Following Deborah\u2019s story, we have Ralph\u2019s miracle\nsurvival story, then Yvonne\u2019s incredible story of how she survived\nas a hidden child. All are often honored guests at Oakton where\nthey speak about their experiences. 505\nSecond Generation Survivor\nDeborah Leonard\nI was born in a Displaced Persons Camp, Landsberg, and\ncame to the US in October 1951. The lessons of resistance,\ntolerance and hope that I learned from my parents, both survivors,\nhave laid the foundation for how I have lived my life and how I\ninteract with the world around me. These lessons have become\nincreasingly important as our country and the world faces divisive\nand challenging times. With the Holocaust Survivor Community\nboth aging and dwindling, the children of survivors are obligated\nto continue to tell their parents\u2019 stories.\nBeing a Second Generation (2G) Survivor has always\nplayed a major role in my life. I am the daughter of two Holocaust\nsurvivors from Poland. My father\u2019s family was among the 800,000\nJews that survived World War II in hard labor camps in the Gulag\n(Soviet Union and Siberia). Of the 3800 Jews from Tyszowicz, my\nfather\u2019s town, only 32 remained after the war. My mother was\nfrom Hrbeiszow near the Ukrainian border. She was only eleven\nyears old when the war broke out and spent most of the next four 506\nyears as a hidden child in the forest and in barns, surviving on what\nshe could gather and constantly moving from one place to another.\nOf thee 11,750 Jews in Hrbeiszow, only 176 remained after the\nwar.\nIn Poland, only 10% of the prewar 3.3 million Jewish\npopulation survived. My parents were a part of this small group of\nsurvivors. Introduced by mutual friends after the war, my parents\nmarried in June of 1946 in the transient town of Waldenberg, on\nthe Polish-German border, with the intent to travel to Landsberg, a\nGerman Displaced Persons (DP) Camp and then on to the United\nStates. However, as a result of their sponsor in the US dying, they\nwere forced to spend five years in Germany in four different DP\nCamps. They did not arrive in the US until October 1951.\nThere is much to talk about my parents\u2019 survival story\nduring the war. However, of late, I realized that there is an equally\namazing story of the resilience, hope, and optimism that are part of\ntheir story in the DP camps and their arrival in the United States.\nMy parents, like other survivors, used their time in the DP Camps\nto start new families, have children and celebrate Shabbat and 507\nJewish holidays. All the DP camps had schools (for both children\nand adults), synagogues, theatres, newspapers and libraries. These\nresilient people were doing their very best to lead normal lives.\nKeep in mind that some of these DP camps had been Nazi\nconcentration camps.\nIn October 1951, when my parents finally arrived in the\nUS, their \u201chit the ground running\u201d attitude followed them. They\ngot jobs, sent their kids to school and immediately became active\nmembers in their communities, including going to night school to\nlearn English and become American citizens. My father worked\nextremely hard and eventually became a business owner.\nThe lessons from my parents\u2019 lives are with me on a daily\nbasis. Their optimism and resilience have especially guided me\nduring the Covid-19 pandemic. These lessons have become\nincreasingly important as our country, and the world faces divisive\nand challenging times. I also am obligated to raise my voice\nagainst any kind of bigotry, including antisemitism. Eli Wiesel\u2019s\nquote is even more meaningful and powerful today. \u201cNever be\nsilent, neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence 508\nencourages the tormentor.\u201d If you see some, say something has\nbecome a core value that we must all live our lives by. 509\nSurvival Story of Ralph Rehbock\nRalph Rehbock\nI was born in July 1934 in Gotha Germany. I am an only\nchild and my parents, and I were living a peaceful and comfortable\nlife in Germany.\nThose people who are willing to take a stand, offer tangible\nevidence that freedom of choice and opportunities to fight injustice\nexist even in the darkest of times. Without the assistance of five\nextraordinary upstanders, my personal story would have had a very\ndifferent ending.\n1. Cousin Max. By spring 1938, the intensifying pace of\nlaws against the Jews prompted my mother and father to plan to\nleave our home in Gotha, Germany This was not an easy task. We,\nand so many others like us, tried to contact family members in the\nUnited States. Some were not willing or ablet o help. Thankfully,\nmy mother\u2019s cousin Max agreed to prepare the affidavit of support\nthat would sponsor our family of 3 for admission to the United\nStates. That was the only way to be able to be accepted as German\nJEWISH Refugees into the US. My mother by herself sailed to 510\nAmerica to Hyde Park in Chicago in April 1938 to retrieve and\nhand carry all of the documents THAT HAD BEEN PREPARED\nBY MAX --back to the US Consulate in Berlin for THE hopeful\nISSUE OF visas. We ultimately received a letter inviting us to\ncome to Berlin for an appointment on November 10.\n2. The House Sitter. During the evening of Nov. 9, we\nwatched from our Berlin hotel window as fire destroyed the\nsynagogue across the street. ONE OF THE 1400 synagogues\ntorched that night. ANOTHER WAS OURS IN GOTHA. With\nTHE cooperation from the local population, Nazis smashed\nwindows, vandalized storefronts and murdered 91 men. My uncle\nwas one of them. The Nazis also arrested 30,000 Jewish men\nbetween the ages of 16 and 60 and sent them to concentration\ncamps. Back at our home in Gotha, the Gestapo came to arrest my\nfather, but a young Jewish girl who was housesitting for us told\nthem she did not know where he was, and they left in disgust. Back\nin 1933 all Jews were required to register. That is how they knew\nwhere every Jew lived. 511\nThat evening we received a telephone call from the\nSITTER at OUR hotel. \u201cThe English lesson is canceled,\" she said.\nIt was A prearranged code meaning, \u201cDo not come home,\u201d and he\nnever did again. All German phones were tapped OF COURSE.\n3. The US Marine. On Nov. 10, we went to our\nSCHEDULED appointment at the U.S. Consulate to secure our\nvisas, but paperwork delays required us to return the following\nday. We did, only to find the consulate closed for \u201cArmistice Day\u201d,\nthe holiday we now call Veterans Day. It was NOV 11 THE DAY\nTHAT WW2 ENDED AT 11AM. A Marine guard standing at the\ngate, was compassionate to our plight AND tracked down the\nconsul general AT HIS HOME. He went to find AND BRING\nHIM BACKTO HIS OFFICE.\n4. The Consul General. Despite the holiday, the consul\ngeneral returned to his office to complete our visas. His signature\nmeant freedom FOR US. All that was left was getting out of\nGermany.\n5. The Stranger. My mother and I traveled to the\nGERMAN/Dutch border where all Jews were forced off the train. 512\nFor reasons still unknown, and with all the suspense of an old noir\nfilm, a Dutchman -- A TOTAL STRANGER tapped my mother on\nthe shoulder and quietly separated us from the other Jews THAT\nWERE ALSO WAITING. His signal to us, a slight tip of his hat,\ntold us to follow him to a local train track and board a train to\nsafety in Holland. From Holland we went to England where we\nwere joined by my father, who HAD traveled separately, and on\nDec. 15, 1938, we left for the United States on the SS Manhattan\nwhich docked on Dec 22ND. I do remember seeing the Statue of\nLiberty in NY harbor.\nWe are reminded of our responsibility to each other. We\nhave the moral obligation to take a stand for humanity. We have\nthe power, through actions both big and small, to become\nupstanders as our five upstanders had been on our behalf.\nOur community must defend against those who attack others based\non race or religion and unite against antisemitism and all forms of\nbigotry. Sometimes, the simplest of actions \u2014 writing a letter to a\ncongressman, making a phone call to support a cause, showing up 513\nto a rally or event, or tipping a hat to a stranger \u2014 can make all the\ndifference in the lives of others. 514\nA Hidden Child\u2019s Story of Survival: Yvonne Aronson\nYvonne Aronson\nMy journey begins in 1887 when my great grandparents\ncame to America from Vienna Austria. They probably ended up in\nthe ghetto in New York City and that wasn\u2019t the life my great\ngrandmother knew in Vienna. My grandmother was born in New\nYork in August 1888 and when she was 2 in 1890 my great\ngrandmother packed herself and her daughter up and went back to\nVienna. My great grandfather stayed another year thinking his\nfamily would return but when they didn\u2019t, he returned to Vienna\nalso and that\u2019s how my family was in Europe when Hitler struck in\n1938. My mother was engaged to be married and saw to it that\nboth families emigrated to Brussels Belgium which was neutral at\nthat time. My mother had two first cousins-the male went on the\nlast Kindertransport and landed in Montevideo Uruguay and the\nfemale ended up being a governess for a Jewish family outside of\nLondon.\nI was born in Brussels on April 5, 1939. My father and his\nbrother were picked up on the street (everyone had false papers) 515\nand were taken to a labor camp outside Carcassonne France. My\nmother\u2019s sister was also picked up and went directly to Auschwitz\nand killed upon arrival. My mother, great grandmother, great aunt\nand I went into a convent. My mother posed as a novice nun but\npassing out three times after attending when they came up the aisle\nwas made governess of the 25 children in the convent. I was the\nonly one with a parent. My mother took one child every evening\nand shared the little food we had.\nWhen she found out that the Mother Superior was\nreceiving food packages, she asked her to share them with the\nchildren she refused, and my mother and I went back to our\napartment where she became very ill. The local pharmacist hid us\nin his cellar where I sat on a wooden chair holding a doll I had\nbeen given by a Belgian friend of my mother\u2019s. There was a small\nwindow with metal bars at street level and all I could see were\npeople\u2019s feet as they walked by. The pharmacist\u2019s wife would\nbring us food and take care of my mother. We were there about 3\nmonths and when my mother recovered, we went briefly back to\nour apartment until she found a widow and her adult son(through 516\nBelgian underground)who was willing to hide me. They lived in\nAudergam which was a picturesque suburb-white picket fences,\ngreen shutters, pretty gardens. My days were spent picking\nvegetables in the garden and twice a week we walked to the local\ncemetery where the widow tended to her husband\u2019s grave.\nWhen I went to live with the widow, I was given 5\nchildren\u2019s books by the same friend who had given me the doll.\nSince I had nothing to do and no one with whom I could play I\ntaught myself to read by the time I was 3-1/2. I read and reread\nthose books countless times-that saved me. My mother would\ncome every Sunday and one Sunday there was a streetcar strike,\nand I was told my mother wouldn\u2019t be coming but I knew she\nwould. She walked 15 miles and never missed a Sunday in the 3+\nyears I was with the widow. Every time she came, I always asked\nwhen the war would be over, and my mother said 1945 to appease\nme. Of course, I cried every time she left. In the meantime, my\ngrandmother landed in New York on April 6,1939, was met by an\nex-boyfriend of my mothers who gave her $100 and put her on a\ngreyhound bus to Chicago to meet up with a friend from Vienna. 517\nMy grandmother was a princess as she was beautiful, charming\nand played bridge; she just couldn\u2019t boil water.\nHer friend got her a job as a cook for a Jewish family, in\nHyde Park, at Passover. She made matzo balls from her friend\u2019s\nrecipe which turned out to be like hockey pucks! They did improve\nand we still make them from that recipe. After this job she went to\nwork as a housekeeper for a widower in Glencoe and that was\nfollowed by a job as housekeeper/companion to Harriet Adler Wile\nwho was the sister of Max Adler of the Adler Planetarium and the\nRosenwald family of the museum of science and industry. When I\ncame back to Brussels, I started kindergarten and had the first\nfriend my own age. I went on to Catholic school because that was\nthe only neighborhood school. During that time my mother would\ngo to the American Consulate in Antwerp several times a month,\nbut it appeared that counsel was anti-Semitic and made it very\ndifficult to get the necessary papers to emigrate to America. It was\nfinally accomplished, and we left Brussels mid-March 1947.\nWe brought an orphan with us, who was the niece of my\ngrandmother\u2019s friends in Chicago. We went by train to Antwerp, 518\nCopenhagen then by ferry to Gothenburg, Sweden where we\nboarded our ship to America. It was a very turbulent crossing. My\ngreat grandmother crossed the Atlantic for the second time. She\nwas the only person who didn\u2019t miss a meal. The morning we\nsailed into New York Harbor everyone was on deck as we sailed\nby the Statue of Liberty. That vision is still permanently imprinted\nin my mind. We were met by my mother\u2019s cousin and husband and\nhe took me on double-decker buses all over New York. I got a stiff\nneck looking at all the tall buildings as there weren\u2019t any in Europe\nat that time. My mother\u2019s cousin took me, by train, to meet my\ngrandmother for the first time. It was scary because it was another\nstranger in my life. It took a couple of days to adapt again. I spoke\nonly French and German-no English.\nMy mother registered me at Kenwood grammar school\nwhere they put me back 2 years because I didn\u2019t know English.\nThe teacher was the daughter of German-Jewish immigrants and\nshe took me home 3 days a week and with the help of her parents\ntutored me. Also, Mrs. Wile tutored me in English 7 days a week\nand within a month I spoke fluently and with no accent. The 519\nchildren weren\u2019t very nice to me and I didn\u2019t have many friends. I\ngraduated in June 1953, went to Hyde Park High School for 2\nmonths and then moved north where I attended Senn High School.\nI was taken by one girl who introduced me to her friends, and I still\nhave 2 friends from those days. I then went on to university of\nIllinois navy pier for 3 years. I married in November 1959. I have\n3 children: Larry 58 who owns advertising agencies, Richard 56,\nan attorney and real estate broker, and Lori 52 who is a pediatric\nanesthesiologist at children\u2019s hospital in Cincinnati. I have three\ngrandchildren ages 13-32 and one great grandchild who is eight.\nIn 1961, (I\u2019m since divorced) my husband and I took a 9-\nweek trip to Europe. I went back to Brussels and saw the widow\u2019s\nson and his family. Sadly, the widow had died in November 1960.\nIt was very strange walking back into that house-nothing had\nchanged except it was part of Brussels proper. When I got to Paris,\nI tried to find my uncle but without success. When I came back\nhome, we placed an ad in the Aufbau which was a paper geared to\nimmigrants. Within 2 days I heard from my grandfather\u2019s brother\nin San Francisco, his daughter in New York and ultimately my 520\nuncle in Paris. We had a family reunion in Paris and Vienna in\n1964 and again in 1966 in Vienna. I went to DC Holocaust\nmuseum in 1996 and learned what happened to him. He was on the\nlast transport of 1500 men, women and children taken from France\nto Auschwitz in February 1944 and was killed January 22, 1945,\nfive days before the Russians liberated Auschwitz.78 Four years\nago, my daughter and her family and I did a family history trip to\nVienna, Berlin and Brussels. Vienna and Berlin were fine but\nbecause there had been a bombing at the Brussels airport, we had\nto take two trains from Berlin to Brussels and another train to\nAmsterdam to fly home. I hired a car in Brussels to take us to all\nthe places where I had grown up. The kindergarten and pharmacy\nwere gone. I consider myself very lucky in my life. I am on the\nspeaker\u2019s bureau for the Illinois Holocaust museum which is my\nway of giving back and is more important now than ever before!\n78 On 26 March 2021, Adam Yunis discovered that Yvonne\u2019s father was in a\nlabor camp in France, then sent to Drancy before his deportation to Auschwitz,\non what Adam believes was transport 68. French records may have more\ninformation as to his experiences in the labor camp. We will continue to\ninvestigate. 521\nCaring for Holocaust Survivors as they Age\nHeather Klain, Nora Bergman, and Yonit Hoffman, Holocaust\nCommunity Services\nHolocaust Community Services is a social service agency\nthat began providing social welfare services to Holocaust survivors\nstarting in 1999, including financial and non-financial assistance.\nOver two decades, the program learned from survivors and\ndeveloped a person-centered, trauma informed (PCTI) model of\ncare. This model uses a holistic and individualized approach to\nservice that takes into account the survivor\u2019s persecution history,\ntriggers, and needs as they age. This essay will discuss the\ndevelopment of this model, its use with aging Holocaust survivors,\nand its future use with other older adult populations who have\nexperienced trauma.\nCaring for Holocaust Survivors as they Age\nAs one of the largest human tragedies in history, the\nHolocaust has had inconceivable ramifications \u2013 to nations,\nfamilies, and individuals. Trauma caused by the Holocaust \u2013 and 522\naccompanying resilience in survivors \u2013 has been studied since the\nHolocaust ended. These studies have led to an ever-growing body\nof knowledge about how to care for the individuals and families\nwho carry the memories of atrocities leveled during World War II\nin both their bodies and their minds.\nBackground\nMany Holocaust survivors moved away from their places\nof birth after World War II ended, making new lives for\nthemselves in Israel, America, and elsewhere around the globe.\nThey got married, had families, and started businesses. Though\nhaunted by the past and continuing to mourn lost family members,\nfriends, homelands, belongings, traditions, and more, they prided\nthemselves on their resilience and ability to persevere and ensure a\ngood life for future generations through hard work. As survivors\naged, they have faced the significant challenges and declines of\naging, often layered and exacerbated by the long-term\nconsequences of the trauma and losses of their past.\nThe Challenges Associated with Aging 523\nAging is associated with physical, cognitive, and emotional\ndecline, leading a majority of older adults to require increasing\ncare and assistance to complete Activities of Daily Living (ADLs).\nFor survivors, this decline and loss of independence can be\nespecially upsetting and frustrating given that many were forced to\nfight for their lives to achieve it and have formed identities around\nthe ability to sustain themselves and their families. Furthermore, as\nsurvivors approach end of life, cognitive decline and \u201clife review\u201d\ncan bring memories of the Holocaust to the fore, forcing survivors\nto re-engage with terrifying and tragic experiences they\u2019d\npreviously suppressed or with which they\u2019d previously been better\nable to cope.\nPerson-Centered Trauma-Informed Care Background\nPerson-centered, trauma informed (PCTI) care is defined as\n\u201can approach to engaging people with histories of trauma that\nrecognizes the presence of trauma symptoms and acknowledges\nthe role that trauma has played in their lives.\u201d (National Center for\nTrauma Informed Care, 2021) It is a framework that \u201cfocuses on\nhow trauma affects an individual\u2019s life and response to behavioral 524\nor health services from prevention through treatment\u201d (Wisconsin\nDepartment of Health Services, 2014)\nPCTI care is founded on the principles of the four Rs (citation):\n1. Realizes the widespread impact of trauma and understands\npotential paths for recovery.\n2. Recognizes the signs and symptoms of trauma in clients,\nfamilies, staff, and others involved with the system.\n3. Responds by fully integrating knowledge about trauma into\npolicies, procedures, and practices; and\n4. Seeks to actively resist re-traumatization.\nAlso important is a \u201cfifth R\u201d- resilience \u2013 which emphasizes a\nstrength-based approach of understanding how survivors coped\nwith hardship and providing opportunities and interventions to\nbolster the ways they can best manage current challenges. PCTI\ncare is the preferred framework from which to approach Holocaust\nsurvivor care. With survivors, PCTI care takes into account not\nonly each individual\u2019s background and needs, but also the\nhistorical, cultural, and religious issues unique to Jewish people 525\ngrowing up in Europe and the former Soviet Union, both before the\nSecond World War and after.\nIntegrating PCTI care\nUnder PCTI care, both the setting of care and the way that\ncare is provided are modified to ensure the comfort and safety of\nsurvivors. Institutional care settings \u2013 such as hospitals, nursing\nhomes, and rehabilitation centers \u2013 typically pose salient threats of\nre-traumatization and are therefore a useful case study in how such\nmodifications can be made. Without attention to providing PCTI\ncare, such facilities contain many potential trauma triggers \u2013\nreminders of past experiences that lead to harmful physical,\npsychological, and emotional reactions. For example, institutional\ncare settings are traditionally cold and clinical; they are filled with\nindividuals in uniforms, loud voices, and different accents; they\nregularly restrict movement and choice; sometimes they require\nindividuals to line up for food; important information commonly\ngoes unshared with patients or residents. Each of these examples\nmay remind a survivor of their past interactions with Nazis and\nNazi collaborators, including being in confined spaces and ordered 526\nto move around involuntarily; undergoing medical\nexperimentation; and lacking access to vital resources.\nIt is critical for staff to realize when an individual being\ncared for in a facility has a trauma history (e.g., by asking relevant\nquestions during intake), to recognize signs and symptoms of\ntraumatic responses (e.g., fear, aggression, dissociation), and to\nrespond by making efforts to decrease triggers in the care setting\n(e.g., grant as much choice as possible, speak softly). All of these\nefforts contribute to resisting re-traumatization and fall within a\nframework of PCTI care.\nThough institutionalized care settings are rife with potential\ntrauma triggers, re-traumatization can occur outside of such\nfacilities as well. As with all traumas, different experiences trigger\ndifferent individuals differently. PCTI care must incorporate this\nknowledge at every turn, by viewing each survivor as an\nindividual. Someone who was in hiding in a forest during the\nHolocaust may be triggered by nightfall, while wasting food may\nupset a survivor who faced hunger and starvation (Baycrest\nManual, 2003). 527\nPCTI Care for Holocaust Survivors at a Social Service Agency\nUse of PCTI principles at a social services agency, such as\nHolocaust Community Services at CJE SeniorLife in Chicago,\nrequires commitment and adaptation at all levels of the agency,\nand is an ongoing process. The impact of services is considered in\nterms of people (staff and clients), places, and policies. Every\ndetail is examined and adapted to create an environment where\nboth clients and staff feel safe, comfortable, and empowered by\nknowledge, voice, and choice.\nPCTI care manifests in several ways at Holocaust\nCommunity Services. At the personnel level, all staff \u2013 from front\ndesk receptionist to Director \u2013 learn about trauma and how\nindividuals with trauma histories may have different needs or\nexhibit different behaviors from other older adults served by the\nagency. Staff are trained to present calmly, speak clearly, and\nprovide options to survivors and other clients. The office space is\nclean, well-lit, and has multiple exits to ensure that survivors are\nnot reminded of previous experiences in dark, dirty, cramped, or\ninescapable settings. While some potentially triggering processes 528\nare unavoidable, such as the collection of personal information,\ninterviews and assessments are conducted as sensitively as\npossible. Staff members clearly explain why different questions are\nbeing asked and how the information will be used, and they assure\nclients that the information will not be shared with others.\nInformation about services is offered in clients\u2019 native language to\npromote understanding, autonomy, and choice. At events, staff and\nvolunteers are instructed to be sensitive to survivor triggers, such\nas not requiring them to stand in lines to register, and not removing\nor discarding food from the table while they are present.\nService Provision during the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic carried great potential to be\nespecially re-traumatizing for Holocaust survivors, as they were\nonce again separated from friends and family, uncertain about\nadequate supplies of food and other essential resources, living in\nfear of losing loved ones, and generally uncertain and anxious\nabout what was to come. Furthermore, throughout 2020, news\nchannels were airing stories not only about the pandemic, but also\nabout economic issues and increasing racial tensions, adding to 529\nsurvivors\u2019 worries. In Chicago, for example, protests and\nassociated destruction of property \u2013 including broken glass on\nmany downtown storefronts \u2013 evoked memories of Kristallnacht.\nFor many, these worries manifested in stress, sleep issues,\nnightmares, and other symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.\nHolocaust Community Services responded at the beginning\nof the pandemic by calling every survivor connected to the\nprogram to ensure that they had food and medication, that they\nwere safe in their homes, and to provide reassurance that the\nagency would still provide support. After these basic needs were\nmet, the agency increased financial support and expanded remote\nservices to decrease social isolation. Support groups were\ntransferred online so that survivors did not lose their sense of\ncommunity and had a place to discuss their anxieties and share\nways to remain resilient. Care packages were sent with clear\ninformation about the pandemic, PPE for protection, and, around\nholidays, with treats and wishes to let survivors know they were\npart of a caring community. These seemingly simple adaptations\nwere made thoughtfully, with consideration of survivors\u2019 unique 530\nneeds, and they made a huge difference to survivors who expressed\noverwhelming gratitude for each outreach effort.\nApplicability of Model to Other Older Adult Populations with\nHistories of Trauma\nWithin the next 20-30 years, the last living Holocaust\nsurvivor will have passed away. The Jewish social services\ncommunity recognizes this fast-approaching reality, as exemplified\nby the Jewish Federations of North America\u2019s (JFNA) recent\nexpansion from the \u201cCenter for Advancing Holocaust Survivor\nCare\u201d to the \u201cJFNA Center on Aging and Trauma and Holocaust\nSurvivor Initiative.\u201d Practices developed by agencies serving\nHolocaust survivors are now being adapted to work with other\npopulations with histories of trauma. These groups include\nminorities in America, older adults with disabilities, survivors of\ngenocides, domestic violence survivors, and more. JFNA has\ncompiled resources with various topics \u2013 trainings for caregivers,\ncreative arts intervention, and PCTI care during a pandemic are\nonly a few examples. 531\nJust as American medicine has moved away from the \u201cone\nsize fits all\u201d care model, PCTI initiatives developed for survivors\nwill continue to grow and develop over time as they are put into\nuse with other populations. While flexibility is a key part of the\nmodel, the PCTI model for working with Holocaust survivors has\nset the groundwork from which lessons will be learned and better\ncare models developed to meet the unique needs of many different\npopulations and future generations who may face trauma.\nReferences\nCenter for Health Care Strategies.

What is Holocaust denial? Denial is\n\u201cHolocaust denial is a movement that exists to deny the existence\nof the Holocaust. Deniers vary in theory, but all employ anti-\nSemitic rhetoric in the formulation of their arguments\u201d (Adele-\nMarie, 2009). Why does denial still exist? Antisemitism did not\nend with the Holocaust because the hatred of the Jews did not end.\nHatred of the Jews was global, and it has not ended. Denial takes\non many forms, from falsification of data, to faux scholars who use\ntheir body of work to justify their stance on denial. Denial\nquestions facts. Deniers will say Hitler never directly ordered this,\nor he never signed that. Also, conferences whose purpose,\norganizers will say is not to deny the Holocaust, but to \u201cdebate\u201d it\nin a \u201cscientific\u201d context. What belief systems are behind this? The\nUnited States Holocaust Memorial Museum stated this about\ndenial and distortion: 534\nHolocaust denial is any attempt to negate the established\nfacts of the Nazi genocide of European Jews. Holocaust\ndenial and distortion are forms of antisemitism,\nprejudice against or hatred of Jews. Holocaust denial\nand distortion generally claim that the Holocaust was\ninvented or exaggerated by Jews as part of a plot to\nadvance Jewish interests. These views perpetuate long-\nstanding antisemitic stereotypes, hateful beliefs that\nhelped lay the groundwork for the Holocaust. Holocaust\ndenial, distortion, and misuse all undermine the truth\nand our understanding of history. (United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum, 2019, para. 1-2)\nImportantly, for more on denial and distortion, see also the essay in\nchapter two of this book \u201cWill antisemitism ever end\u201d by Sherry\nBard. Last, \u201cdeniers refer to the Holocaust as a hoax, arguing that\nJews have used the Holocaust as a construction to create a multi-\nmillion-dollar industry revolving around scholarship and\ncommemoration\u201d (Adele-Marie, 2009). Education challenges hate. 535\nReferences\nAdele-Marie, W. (2009). \u201cHistory of the Holocaust.\u201d\nEncyclopedia of the modern world.

Thus, we begin here with Daniel Patrick Brown. Brown is a\nnoted historian for his work on female perpetrators of the\nHolocaust and other topics related to the intersections of American\nand German history. Here, he explores the intersection of America\nand the Holocaust, ending with comments on denial.\nAmerica and the Holocaust\nDaniel Patrick Brown\n\u201cThe past is never dead. It's not even past.\u201d William Faulkner,\nRequiem for a Nun\nTo some, it may seem incongruous to examine the United\nStates of America and the Holocaust together. In the first place, the\nhorrific attempt to annihilate those the Nazis targeted as so-called\nundesirables (Jews, Sinti/Roma, Slavs, gay men, and more)\noccurred in Europe and the western Asiatic regions of the former\nUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). America lies over\n3,550 miles from the west coast of France, which was the most\nwestern area of Nazi occupied Europe. Consequently, the United 537\nStates was safely cushioned by the Atlantic Ocean from the\natrocities and mass murder that the Third Reich committed. While\ntoday people live in a truly global community, during the era of the\nThird Reich, there were no transatlantic aircraft flights, maritime\ntravel took weeks, and instantaneous communication could only be\naccomplished via telegraph or telephone services.\nSecondly, America and Nazi Germany were ostensibly\ndiametrical opposites. The United States, a nation that aspired to\nfulfil the noble principles of \u201clife, liberty, and the pursuit of\nhappiness,\u201d stood in stark contrast to everything that the\nauthoritarian Nazi police state represented. America was the\nworld\u2019s great experiment in representative self-government. The\nThird Reich was unabashedly dedicated to elevating its so-called\nAryan citizens while simultaneously denigrating those it\nconsidered to be inferior and/or burdens on the body politic. The\nThird Reich would ultimately plunge the world into war and the\nGerman people into ruin. 538\nFinally, from a business perspective, America was a country\nthat championed free market capitalist business practices, whereas\nthe Third Reich embraced a mercantile economic model that only\nallowed businesses to operate that benefited the state first and\nafforded the accumulation of wealth\u2014if sanctioned\u2014a distant\nsecond. Although there were no profit limitations placed on\nAmerican commercial interests during the 1930s and early 1940s, in\n1936 one of the Nazi mandates on those doing business in the Third\nReich limited the maximum profit margin any commercial\nenterprise could earn at a maximum of nine percent.\nSo, how are America and the Holocaust linked together?\nAmerica, despite its lofty ideals and representative form of\ngovernment, was in some ways a more racist and bigoted country\nthan the Third Reich. Long before the Nazis imposed their\n\"euthanasia\" or so-called \u201cmercy killing\u201d of those deemed \u201cunfit\" or\n\"handicapped\" in Germany, they took elements of the American\neugenics movement to construct their raison d'\u00eatre for murdering\nGermans who were physically and mentally disabled. 539\nThe term \u201ceugenics\u201d was coined in 1883 by Sir Francis\nGalton, a cousin of Charles Darwin, who advocated a new science\nof human improvement through better breeding. This new approach,\nwhich sometimes was referred to as \u201cpositive eugenics,\u201d caught on\nin the United States in the first third of the twentieth century.\nHowever, a more sinister side, \u201cnegative eugenics,\u201d soon was touted\nas a requisite piece of the purification process it would be of no use\nto create a better stock if the \u201cimmoral minorities,\u201d \u201cuseless eaters,\u201d\nand \u201cmental defectives\u201d were allowed to continue to multiply and\nperhaps overwhelm the healthy group. Respected American\nhistorians, such as Lothrop Stoddard and American legal scholars,\nlike Madison Grant, advocated forced sterilizations of the \u201cbeings\nwith ballast existences\u201d as well as the exclusion of certain\nimmigrants from entry into the United States.\nHistorian Stefan K\u00fchl\u2019s 1994 study, The Nazi Connection:\nEugenics, American Racism, and German National Socialism,\ncreated a sensation in the United States when he documented the\nopen and ongoing dialogue between American and Nazi eugenicists\nthat continued until the late 1930s. This is not to say that the 540\nAmerican eugenics movement ever advocated murdering those\ndetermined to be \u201cunworthy of life.\u201d Nevertheless, Nazi social\nengineers, who were echoing similar pronouncements Hitler had\nmade in Mein Kampf, were able to directly apply these American\ntenets of eugenics and gradually link them to their concerns about\nthe health of the \u201ccommunity of ethnic Germans\u201d\n(Volksgemeinschaft). Just as some American states had passed\nlegislation to sterilize epileptics, and/or \"confirmed criminals,\nidiots, imbeciles and rapists,\" Nazi statutes also gave public health\nofficials the right to sterilize all citizens who were objectified as \u201clife\nunworthy of life,\u201d \u201cbeings of lesser worth,\u201d and/or \u201cbeings with\nballast existences.\u201d Furthermore, to justify this law, Nazi legislators\ncited Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes\u2019s opinion in\nBuck v. Bell (1927) that allowed for state-mandated sterilization,\nwriting \u201cit would be strange if it could not call upon those who\nalready sap the strength of the state for these lesser sacrifices . . . in\norder to prevent our being swamped with incompetence . . . Three\ngenerations of imbeciles is [sic] enough\u201d (Brown, 2019, p. 149). 541\nHitler and his acolytes also viewed the manner in which Jim\nCrow legislation stripped African Americans from all meaningful\nsocio-political rights to serve as the model for the infamous\nNuremberg Laws, which did essentially the same thing to German\nJews. Also, the seventeen legal scholars and Nazi bureaucrats who\nassembled in Berlin during the summer of 1934 were particularly\nimpressed with the way in which Southern African Americans had\nbeen relegated to perpetual economic servitude via sharecropping\nand tenet-farming. In her study of institutionalized hierarchies,\nCaste: The Origins of Our Discontent, Isabel Wilkerson has shown\nthat India\u2019s vanquished caste system, the Third Reich\u2019s racial state,\nand America\u2019s Jim Crow legislation, all share the same unsettling\nmethodologies.\nAmerican Jews were also subjected to unrelenting\ndiscrimination and denigration as well. Antisemites were found in\nall three branches of the U.S. government. On the legislative side,\nmany representatives and senators held anti-Jewish beliefs, most\nnotably Representative John Rankin (D-MS). Rankin\u2019s disdain for\nall varieties of non-Anglo-Saxons is found throughout the 542\nCongressional Record during his sixteen consecutive terms (March\n4, 1921\u2013January 3, 1953). In 1941 (but prior to America\u2019s entry into\nthe Second World War) Rankin railed against \u201cWall Street and a\nlittle group of our international Jewish brethren\u201d (Brown, 2019, p.\n37). He claimed Jews were attempting to get America into the\nconflict. Four months after the United States joined the war effort,\nRankin derided a Supreme Court decision that he disagreed with,\ndeclaring that he was tired and the American people were tired, \u201cof\nthis [Felix] Frankfurter bureaucracy\u201d (Brown, 2019, p. 37).The\nranking senator from Mississippi, Theodore Bilbo (D-MS) was a\nNew Deal supporter who was also a white supremacist, and he was\nfixated on the idea that racial decay occurred through race mixing.\nIn fact, Bilbo contended that \u201cone drop of blood placed in the veins\nof the purest Caucasian destroys the inventive genius of his mind\nand palsies the creative faculty\u201d (Whitman, 2017, p. 77). It may be\ndifficult for Americans to believe, but Bilbo\u2019s declaration went\nfurther than what the Nazis espoused, as they flatly rejected Bilbo\u2019s\n\u201cone-drop\u201d contention as too extreme. 543\nAs for the judicial branch, Supreme Court justice James\nMcReynolds never hid his contempt for Jews. He refused to speak\nto his fellow justices who were Jewish (Benjamin N. Cardozo and\nLouis B. Brandeis). Sensing the mood of the country, many Jewish\nleaders urged FDR not to appoint Felix Frankfurter to the Supreme\nCourt when Cardozo died in July 1938. They feared a backlash.\nIndeed, Time Magazine had characterized Frankfurter as a Jewish\nradical New Dealer and that to replace Cardozo (a moderate Jew)\nwith a Jewish activist would provide the antisemites with more\nammunition\u2014not only to be used against American Jews, but\npotentially against Jews abroad as well.\nWhen synagogues were torched and Jews openly attacked in\nGermany on Reichskristallnacht [Night of the Broken Glass,\nNovember 9-10, 1938], two members of Congress, Senator Robert\nWagner (D-NY) and Representative Edith Rogers (R-MA),\nsympathetic to the plight of the defenseless German-Jewish\ncommunity, were so moved that they introduced legislation to at\nleast assist the young victims of Nazi racism. The measure, the\nbipartisan Wagner-Rogers Bill, would have allowed the United 544\nStates to admit 20,000 Jewish children above and beyond the\nestablished immigration quota. An immediate backlash occurred.\nFDR\u2019s cousin and wife of the U.S. Commissioner of Immigration,\nLaura Delano Houghteling, stated that \u201c20,000 charming children\nwould all too soon grow into 20,000 ugly adults\u201d (Brown, 2019, p.\n37).\nFather Charles E. Coughlin, the \u201cRadio Priest,\u201d had a huge\nfollowing as he railed against Jewish bankers, whom he blamed for\nthe worldwide Depression. After Hitler assumed power in Germany,\nWilliam D. Pelley founded his antisemitic and para-militaristic\n\u201cSilver Legion\u201d (his followers were known as \u201cSilver Shirts\u201d and/or\n\u201cChristian Patriots\u201d). The Silver Legion attracted a large number of\nnew recruits and there were chapters in virtually every state in the\nUnion. The Reverend Gerald L. K. Smith was another prominent\nantisemitic agitator who amassed a legion of likeminded followers.\nAfter the assassination of \u201cthe Kingfish,\u201d Huey P. Long, in\nSeptember 1935, Smith was left in charge of the \u201cShare the Wealth\u201d\nmovement that the two had started. The two had initiated this\nprogram as a means to remedy the economic inequity that they 545\nperceived to have caused the Great Depression. Smith then shifted\nthe organization into a vehicle for his white supremacist agenda.\nThe U.S. State Department, an arm of the executive branch,\ndid all it could to stop Jewish immigration to America. During a time\nof when Jews were desperately seeking foreign sanctuary, the State\nDepartment created complex and detailed application forms and\npetitioners were required to submit six copies in order to generate a\nvalid file. To even be considered for entry, an applicant had to have\nan American sponsor. Also, applications were rejected with no\nexplanation as to why their request was denied. Furthermore, an\nunsuccessful application required a six-month waiting period prior\nto any reapplication. In March 1943, the Assistant Secretary of\nState, Breckinridge Long, proclaimed that saving European Jews\nwas not prudent because it \u201cwould take the burden and the curse off\nHitler\u201d (Brown, 2019, p. 37). Historian Frank Bajohr\u2019s 2003 work\nentitled, Unser Hotel ist Juden-frei: B\u00e4der- Antisemitismus im 19.\nund 20. Jahrhundert [Our Hotel Forbids Jews: Temporary-Housing\nAntisemitism in the 19th and 20th Centuries] documented the harsh\nreality for Jewish travelers: until the 1950s, hotel and resort 546\nantisemitism in the United States was so pronounced that\napproximately 30% of all American vacation accommodations did\nnot allow Jewish guests to stay at their properties. Bajohr pointed\nout that this was a higher exclusion rate for American Jews than for\nJews residing in the Third Reich at the same time.\nThankfully, the Third Reich was utterly defeated in May\n1945 and its monstrous assault on humanity was exposed for the\nworld to see. Yet, only seventy-five years later, a blink of an eye in\nthe history of humankind, white supremacists, many espousing the\nsame sort of virulent antisemitism as the Nazis, have even been\nchampioned by Americans leaders and lawmakers. Therefore, it\nwould be beneficial to remember that after visiting the newly\nliberated KL-Buchenwald subcamp at Gotha, American General\nDwight David Eisenhower, the commander of the Allied\nExpeditionary Force in Europe, ordered the following: \u201cGet it all on\nrecord now\u2014get the films\u2014get the witnesses\u2014because somewhere\ndown the road of history some bastard will get up and say that this\nnever happened\u201d (Letter, General Eisenhower to General Marshall\nConcerning His Visit to a Germany Internment Camp near Gotha 547\n(Ohrdruf), April 15, 1945 [Dwight D.

We can\nempower the learner through Holocaust education to prevent\nbullying, hate, intolerance, racism, antisemitism, and anti-\nimmigrant prejudices.\nWe must educate, especially as genocide is still ongoing as\nI write this book. Once, my students reviewed Genocide watch, a\nwebsite that noted genocide scholar Gregory Stanton founded. All\nwere shocked at how many genocides occurred after 1945. One\nstudent then asked why was the Holocaust only a paragraph in\ntheir high school history textbook? Another said that they did not\neven know Germany was an enemy during the Second World War.\nSo there seems to be an educational disconnect somewhere. All of\nus have a responsibility to fill that gap. Through education, we can 554\nbecome empowered to combat hate and stop genocide before it\nbegins. Hate can be emotional, reactive, and stir up sentiments\nsuch as anger and blame. If something is going badly for an\nindividual, or if a collective group has an issue about anything,\nwhether micro or macro, hate can lead to blaming, and that need to\nblame someone for whatever the group is upset about can quickly\nlead to crimes against humanity. Education is a preventative.\nClasses in Holocaust studies are essential, especially true\nsince there are precious few Holocaust survivors left, some of\nwhom still have not recorded their testimonies, as \u201cthere are only\n400,000 [survivors] around the world\u201d (Kirshner, 2020, para. 12).\nThe next generation of scholars has the mandate to teach these\nhistories so that the world never forgets. There is critical work to\nbe done to record their testimonies.\nWith so few survivors left,\nthis means that there are significantly fewer witnesses who\ncan tell their incredible tales of survival on a first-hand\nbasis to their children, grandchildren, Holocaust\norganizations, school assemblies, journalists, and 555\nhistorians. Once they are gone, their voices will forever be\nstilled, and the Holocaust will gradually fade into the vast\nstillness and dimness of obscurity. (Kirshner, 2020, para. 7)\nIn 2018, the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against\nGermany contracted a survey to determine what Millennials (18-\n34) knew about the Holocaust, noting that \u201cthe issue is that it is\nreceding from memory\u201d (Kirshner, 2020, para. 10). Few even\nknew what the word Holocaust meant, which is disconcerting,\nespecially given the current rise of antisemitism, racism, and terror\nattacks against people, religious houses of worship, and public\ninstitutions. Therefore, more than ever before, Holocaust education\nis necessary.\nTo know how to recognize historical constructs of bullying,\nhate, indifference, and intolerance, provides educators with tools to\nempower their students (United States Holocaust Memorial\nMuseum, 2020). Becoming educated in genocide and\nunderstanding what bullying, hate and more lead to, Holocaust\ninstruction presents both student and instructor with a multi- 556\nperspective framework to present an ethical imperative to why\nHolocaust education matters.\nReferences\nAdele-Marie, W.

As\nChelsea Halling-Nye writes in her abstract,\nIn light of the COVID-19 pandemic, many museums,\nincluding the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum,\nmoved all resources and trainings online. Through these\nnew virtual offerings, teachers and students have the\nopportunity to continue to receive high-quality information\nand content without having to step through the doors of the\nbuilding. Museums empower and educate audiences to\nlearn from the past and strive for a better future.\nHere, Halling-Nye explains the importance and the role of\nmuseums in education.\nAll my life, I have loved history. Even as a young child, I\nwould dig through the \u201cbig kid books\u201d on my parents\u2019\nbookshelves, studying the grainy black and white photographs and\ntrying to make sense of the complicated words. As I got older, I\ncraved trips to libraries, galleries, planetariums, historical sites, and 558\nmuseums, but as I lived in a rural farming community on the\nUtah/Idaho border, most of these types of institutions were hours\naway. I dreamed of visiting Washington, DC and exploring the\nwealth of history there. It wasn\u2019t until my senior year of high\nschool that I finally had the opportunity to visit DC and explore the\nplaces that until then I had only read about.\nI never imagined then that over a decade later I\u2019d be living\nin DC and working at one of the museums that impacted me most\ndeeply, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. I am\nhonored to be able to work at this remarkable institution and help\nshare its lessons and resources with teachers and knowledge-\nhungry students. Even if they have never been through the doors of\nthe Museum, we strive to make the content as available and\naccessible as possible to anyone who seeks more information.\nThe Museum\u2019s website explains more about the\ndevelopment and history of the institution:\nOn November 1, 1978, President Jimmy Carter established\nthe President's Commission on the Holocaust, chaired by\nauthor and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel. The 559\nCommission submitted a report to President Carter on\nSeptember 27, 1979, recommending the establishment of a\nmemorial with three main components: a national\nHolocaust memorial/museum, an educational foundation,\nand a Committee on Conscience. In 1980, the United States\nCongress unanimously voted to form the United States\nHolocaust Memorial Council. Its mandate was the creation\nof a living memorial to the 6 million Jews and millions of\nother victims who perished during the Holocaust.\n(ushmm.org, n.d.)\nWhile the events of the Holocaust happened on the other side of\nthe world over half a century ago, the lessons and history transcend\nlocation and time.\nThe Museum strives to show its visitors the human cost of\nthe Holocaust \u2013 that every victim and survivor had families,\ndreams, hopes, and fears. They were unique individuals, all living\ntheir own journey and experience. By turning an incomprehensible\nnumber \u2013 six million \u2013 into individual faces and stories, it aims to\nbring humanity and dignity back to every victim. My team, 560\nEducation Initiatives, works hard to ensure that teachers and\nstudents have access to the Museum\u2019s rich library of content and\nfeel confident as they navigate Holocaust history. Whether you are\na new student to this history or a well-seasoned educator, we have\nresources for you.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Museum staff\nquickly realized that our resources needed to be more readily\navailable online. The website ushmm.org/teach contains lessons,\nbibliographies, videos, podcast links, virtual tours, posters, online\nexhibits, and more, so even while the Museum is closed to the\npublic, visitors can still experience aspects of the Museum\nremotely and learn more about our foundational lessons. We also\nknew that teachers still needed to have access to our trainings, even\nif in a virtual setting. For example, in 2020, we hosted the Belfer\nNational Conference for Educators online. While this conference\ntypically hosts around 250 teachers in-person, we were able to\nreach over 1000 teachers, administrators, professors, education\nstudents, and more by holding it virtually, allowing us to share 561\npedagogy, lessons, and training with three times the number of\nattendees we typically can reach in a single year.\nThe Holocaust Museum, and indeed all museums, are\ncritical institutions in society today. They collect, conserve, and\ndisplay irreplaceable artifacts, perform valuable research, discover\nand share untold stories, and educate audiences. Museums help\nprovide tangible links to history and keep stories from being lost.\nEven when museum doors are closed, resources, online collections\nrecords, virtual tours, and trainings allow anyone with a hunger to\nlearn and explore the chance to do so. I am forever grateful for the\nopportunity to play a tiny part in helping educators gain the\nconfidence and receive the training and resources they need to\nteach the next generation of students about the moral and spiritual\nquestions raised by the history of the Holocaust and to humanize\nand preserve the memories of those who died.\nReferences\nThe President\u2019s Commission on the Holocaust.

The author, Emily Minerof, developed a unique way to teach\nthe Holocaust via a podcast during the COVID-10 pandemic. It\nstarted out as a project for my class on the History of Nazi\nGermany but developed into a unique instructional way to share\nhistory. I am proud of how Emily transformed this project into\nsomething very different for Holocaust education.\nWomen and the Holocaust: Podcast Transcript\nEmily Minerof\nHello and welcome to COVID N\u2019 College, a podcast by\nyour host: me, Emily Minerof, a college student during the COVID\ntimes. I initially made this podcast as an one-and-done type of\nthing as a project for my Chemistry class. Long story short, it\ndidn\u2019t have much to do with Chemistry. However, I found this\nplatform as a really interesting way to convey information to others\nand I figured it would be a perfect way to do my history project.\nSo, without further ado, the second episode of COVID N\u2019 College\nis about women during the Holocaust and women perpetrators of\nthe Holocaust. 564\nBefore I get into the details of my actual project, I\u2019m just\ngonna talk a little bit about this semester, what I\u2019ve been doing,\nand how I got to this point. So, this is my fifth semester as an\nundergrad; however, I actually spent my first two years of\nundergrad at the University of Wisconsin- Madison. Then when\nCOVID hit, I made the decision to start taking classes at Oakton\nCollegefull time. Alright, before I go on, I know what you\u2019re\nthinking: \u201cEmily, you did things a little backwards. You went to a\nfour-year institution, did all your gen-eds, and now you\u2019re at a\ncommunity college and you have no more gen-eds left.\u201d\nLucky for me I actually did have two gen-eds left, so there\nwas something for me to do and I was excited to do them. Initially,\nI began taking classes at Oakton over the summer during COVID\nbecause I was so bored and at home and had nothing to do, and I\nwas like, \u201cYou know what? I have some gen-eds left, I have time,\nwhy don\u2019t I just do it?\u201d and to my luck, I found History 228, which\nwas history of the Holocaust, and I- somehow, everything worked\nout for me, but I actually needed a European history credit for- to\ntransfer for my degree. For whatever reason, when I run my, you 565\nknow, degree audit, my history credit specifically needs to be U.S.\nhistory or European history. So, when I saw this class about the\nHolocaust, I was like, \u201cThis is great! I get to learn about something\nI\u2019m interested in and it transfers back to UW, which is super cool\nbecause UW Madison is really picky sometimes.\u201d\nI have always been interested about learning more about\nthe Holocaust. I grew up in a Jewish household, um, I\u2019m from\nEvanston, I also lived in Skokie for a period of time, so, you know\nthat\u2019s a very Jewish neighborhood. I traveled to Amsterdam and\nvisited the Anne Frank house, so I had a lot of knowledge of the\nHolocaust, like that it had happened and, you know, very known\nthings that had happened, but I didn\u2019t learn much in depth about it\nand I have always wanted to learn more. So, when I saw this class,\nI was like, \u201cThis is great! I\u2019m so excited, I\u2019m gonna learn\nsomething in depth about a topic that I think is really fascinating.\u201d\nSo, the class starts, we start learning, and there\u2019s a topic\nabout women in the Holocaust and how women played a role,\nwhether it was active or passive, all sorts of stuff, and it was\nsomething I had never heard about. I had never known that women 566\nplayed such a large role, so that was something that I was really\ninterested in because I was so, like, \u201cWow, this is just so crazy to\nme,\u201d so when the opportunity to take History 200, the independent\nstudy of, you know, the history of Germany, I was like, \u201cHeck\nyeah, let\u2019s do it,\u201d and now I get to do a whole project on this topic\nthat I learned about that I never knew about before.\nLong story short, I have an immense amount of gratitude\nfor Oakton Collegefor giving me an opportunity that I don\u2019t think I\nwould have had if COVID did not happen, and I have a lot of\ngratitude for Professor Adele-Marie, who inspired me to keep\nlearning about this topic and has been very supportive in my\nlearning endeavors, and also the Jewish Studies department at\nOakton because they have so many resources and honestly, every\ntime I learn something about the Holocaust from the Jewish\nStudies department it\u2019s always something I\u2019ve never learned\nbefore. So, thanks for listening thus far, sorry it took four minutes\nto get to the point, but I hope you enjoy this podcast and I hope\nyou learn a little something about women in the Holocaust. 567\nSo, the first thing I really want to talk about is the role\nwomen did play in the Holocaust because initially I never really\nthought of women playing a large role. I thought it was more of a\npassive role, a compliance role where nothing was done to stop the\nHolocaust, but nothing was added to the violence that was\noccurring. I want to talk about how women were mobilized by\nHitler to make the Holocaust as powerful as it was. And I want to\nclarify that when I say I didn\u2019t really think of women as having a\nlarge role, I don\u2019t mean that in a sexist way or a misogynist type of\nway, I mean that more in a way of at that time in the 1920\u2019s,\nwomen did not have a lot of power; so, it didn\u2019t occur to me that\nthat is what happened. And, in the simplest of terms, women did\nperpetrate the Holocaust. Women did play a role. It wasn\u2019t a\nquestion of \u201cdid women play a role or not play a role?\u201d because\nthey certainly did, so that\u2019s the first point I want to establish\nbecause that is definitely a misconception that people have and in\norder to move on to the actual roles that they played, you\u2019ve got to\nknow that they did, in fact, play a role. 568\nJust a personal tidbit here, but I grew up going to JRC\n(Jewish Reconstructionist Congregation). That was my\ncongregation and temple that I went to and I remember at one\npoint, I can\u2019t remember what year, but it was very close to the year\nthat the Holocaust Museum opened up in Skokie, so maybe\nsometime around 2010, but I remember that during the high\nholidays my temple had to last-minute change the location of\nservices because there were people protesting outside of the\ntemple. You know, the signs had swastikas and slander and terrible\nthings on them, but what I remember specifically about that was\nthat there were women there with their children, like, infants\nsometimes in the strollers, and the women were participating just\nas much as the men were and even had the children, you know, the\ntoddlers who could walk participating as well, so that adds to the\ncompliance and the not knowing and more so that the hatred of\nJews and antisemitism is still out there.\nNow, some people know that there are women like Irma\nGrese, among others, who were very publicly known for actively\nplaying a role in being a woman in the Holocaust and perpetuating 569\nviolence, but what a lot of people don\u2019t know is how Hitler\nmobilized the woman\u2019s vote in the Third Reich. In fact, the\nnumber of women that did vote is what made it possible for the\nNational Socialist Party to rise to power, because the National\nSocialist Party gave women the right to vote. However, I think it is\nimportant to note that during the rise of the National Socialist Party\nand the Nazi party, the country of Germany was still in the Weimar\nRepublic, which was a democratic form of government. Once\nHitler took over and made himself a dictator essentially, he\nchanged that to a more, obviously a National Socialist government,\nwhere it wasn\u2019t a democracy at that point anymore.\nBut Hitler, according to Helen Boak who wrote Mobilizing\nwomen for Hitler: the female Nazi voter, um, more than fifty\npercent of the vote was the female vote and it was clear that in\nareas, in 1932 in Protestant areas, the NSDAP/ the National\nSocialist Party was receiving more votes from women than it had\nfrom men. So, a question a lot of people may be asking themselves\nat this point is, \u201cWhy did Hitler appeal to women so much so that\nmore women than men voted for him?\u201d and that\u2019s a great question. 570\nThere are several answers to this question, one being he made\nwomen feel important by targeting them with his manipulative\npropaganda, making women feel that they had power and giving\nthem the right to vote. Obviously, if women had never had the\nability to vote in the past, having this opportunity now is gonna\nmake them feel important. Another essential piece to why Hitler\nmade women feel compelled to vote was that he allowed them, um,\non November 12th, 1918, to attend political movements and\nmeetings and parties.\nNot only could women vote, but they could also participate\nin political discussion and actually know that they were doing. In\nthe 1920\u2019s and 30\u2019s, women were more or less housewives and\nwhat made them compelled to vote was that these political\nmeetings, parties, etc., they could be held in the home, so\nessentially politics became accessible to women and it was able to\nreach housewives, which was the majority of women, uh, aged\nover twenty. What\u2019s interesting is that many of these meetings\nconsisted of women\u2019s issues, which sounds kind of backwards,\nlike, why would a woman vote for the National Socialist Party if 571\nthey want rights for women? But that inherently was backwards.\nUm, well at the time, when, like, obviously I was not around in,\nyou know, pre-World War II/post World War I Germany, but in\nthat time the climate was insane.\nThey had just come out of a war, there was a loss of\nnationalism, the democracy was failing, women didn\u2019t have the\nright to vote, so when something positive happens when, you\nknow, the women get the right to vote and when they get access to\nsomething that they didn\u2019t have before, that\u2019s one positive thing.\nSo, at the time women may have not considered the negative\nfactors of national socialism but took it as an opportunity to\ndiscuss problems that they wanted to fix for themselves. On the\nsurface that sounds great, but obviously this led to terrible things.\nUm, what\u2019s also super important to note about this is that young\nwomen were the ones doing this. Older women felt more\nuncomfortable according to Helen Boak in that article. But again,\nlike the current election that just happened, uh, young voters are\nessential and can make a large difference. 572\nFor example, I am in Wisconsin, I became a resident and\nthis year. Wisconsin was blue and I voted in Wisconsin, so, you\nknow, the young vote is important. Not to say anything about my\npolitical beliefs, that could be a whole podcast on its own, but the\ngist of what I\u2019m saying is that the young vote is really important to\nthe overall vote. Basically, what Hitler did is in the beginning of\nthe Nazi Party\u2019s rise to National Socialism and dictatorship, he got\nthe women to be on his side by allowing them to vote and giving\nthem a platform to voice their problems like, you know, women\u2019s\nrights, women\u2019s ability to be in the workplace, abortion, things like\nthat and he gave women the power to have a voice in politics and\nthat\u2019s what let them to voting because he gave them that\nopportunity.\nHelen Boak also writes that the role of a housewife, like,\nwomen expressed that the role of a housewife should be\nrecognized as a profession, and honestly any woman at that time,\nlike, that makes sense. If someone told me right now, \u201cOh you\u2019re a\ncollege student, that should be considered a job,\u201d I\u2019d be like, \u201cYou\nknow? You raise a fair point.\u201d Now I am in no way saying that 573\nwhat Hitler did to mobilize the women\u2019s vote was right, I\u2019m just\nsaying how it makes sense that it appealed to women. And more\nso, women felt important because they could actually contribute to\nHitler\u2019s ideal Aryan race. Women could have children, they could\nactually populate this perfect ideal race that Hitler wanted, so since\nthey could do something and actually contribute to the effort, that\nmade them feel, like, important and that they could do something.\nIt was no longer just men going to war and the women\nstaying home and taking care of the children, it was now women\ncan actually participate by doing other things other than going to\nwar. They can actually go to political rallies or they could voice\ntheir political opinions, or they could have a ton of babies you\nknow, things like this. And what\u2019s important to know here is that\nin the Weimar Republic, that was a democracy so someone with\nthe majority of votes would have one power, right? But with the\nThird Reich coming and the change to National Socialism, the way\ngovernment worked was that however much percentage of a\ncertain party was voted for was how much was represented in the\ngovernment. So slowly over time, the Nazi Party gained seats in 574\nthe government, like they started with a really small amount and\nthen over time more people voted and there was more\nrepresentation but since the government was formatted in a way\nthat that was possible, that\u2019s how the Nazi Party was able to get\ntheir place in government and then slowly, over time, take up more\nspace and be more represented.\nIf we think in terms of numbers, giving fifty percent of the\npopulation, you know, women, a right to vote that\u2019s certainly\ngoing to sway an election or voting process or campaign because\nthat\u2019s a lot of people. Although Helen Boak notes that it is clear\nthat before 1932 the Nationalist Socialist party was attracting\nwomen\u2019s votes without targeting women as a group, but it did not\nactively seek to win the female vote until 1932 until it realized the\nsignificance of the women\u2019s vote if that makes sense. So, at first,\nthey were targeting more votes and then they realized that, you\nknow, the women\u2019s vote makes a big difference so, \u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201d\nJust to clarify, when I say them or it or they, I\u2019m referring to the\nNational Socialist party. 575\nBoak ends her paper with saying, \u201cThe way in which\nmillions of women cast their vote ensured that women\u2019s rights\nwould not be on the electoral agenda again for some considerable\ntime.\u201d Now when you dissect that, women were voting for their\nown rights. Women had the opportunity to vote against abortion\nlaws and against things that would harm them. So, at that time\nwomen, maybe in the beginning of the Holocaust and the\nbeginning of World War II, didn\u2019t realize that by exercising this\npower to vote they were also being manipulated into something\nterrible. So, when the Holocaust started and Hitler rose to power,\nthat wasn\u2019t the start of the Holocaust.\nThe start of the Holocaust, I mean obviously this is\narguable, but the way Hitler rose to power was very well thought-\nout, if that\u2019s a good way to put it. He slowly gained power over\ntime and he slowly did things so that people wouldn\u2019t find, like,\nthe general public wouldn\u2019t find what he was doing outrageous.\nSo, if he started with the Final Solution or something so terrible, I\nmean that is terrible but, another thing that was terrible, for\nexample, people would have been outraged, right? But since he 576\nstarted slowly, people weren\u2019t able to see the malicious intent that\nhe had until much later. So overall, by mobilizing women\u2019s ability\nto vote in, you know, the end of the Weimar Republic and the\nbeginning of the Third Reich, that was how he gained a lot of\npublic approval and support of what he was doing, and without that\nit may have been difficult for Hitler to carry out the rest of his\noutrageous acts during the Holocaust and that\u2019s a role that women\nplayed, whether they understood what was going on or whether\nthey understood that it was manipulative, I\u2019ll never know, we\u2019ll\nnever know, but that\u2019s where it started. And again, with Hitler\u2019s\nvery well-thought-out plan in the beginning, you know, women\ngetting the right to vote and voting for themselves and their health\nor whatever, like, that doesn\u2019t seem outrageous at the time so that\u2019s\nhow he got women interested in politics.\nObviously there were some women who committed very\nactive and malicious acts towards Jews and other target groups\nduring the Holocaust, and there were also women who didn\u2019t do\nthings that were so malicious and really acted more passive, but the\nidea of compliance in this case really contributed to the violence of 577\nthe Holocaust and, obviously this is hard to argue but in this period\nof time, I think it is valid to argue that that women who continued\nto support the cause and support the war effort, even though it was\nnon-violent, were compliant and therefore contributed to the\nviolence of the Holocaust. Before I get into the heinous acts that\nwomen actively caused, people such as Irma Grese who committed\nvery violent acts as an S.S. guard, I want to talk about how women\ngot there.\nObviously, women were allowed to work in the\nconcentration camps and when you think about that, people didn\u2019t\njust offer to work in the concentration camps. There had to be\nmalicious intent. There had to be something deep within that\nperson, deeply rooted antisemitism. It\u2019s not some job that people\nwould just pick up because it\u2019s easy and it\u2019s there, it\u2019s not one of\nthose jobs. That\u2019s a job that someone understands what they\u2019re\ndoing and wants to do it. Back in History 228, there was a textbook\nwe used for that class called Problems in the European\nCivilization: the Holocaust Fourth Edition by Donald Niewyk and\nthere were, I want to say six chapters and they were very detailed, 578\nand it talked about the motivation of the killers, it\u2019s actually\nchapter two, and it talks about how basically there was no way that\npeople didn\u2019t know what they were doing. But this was also a\nquestion of compliance, so Christopher Browning, who writes part\nof this chapter, writes that, \u201cTo break ranks and step out, to adopt\novertly non-conformist behavior was simply beyond most of the\nmen. It was easier for them to shoot. If the men of the Reserve\nPolice Battalion 101 could become killers, what group of men\ncould not?\u201d And what that means is basically, people, I mean\nsoldiers, this obviously isn\u2019t about women but I\u2019m gonna talk\nabout the mentality because the mentality between men and\nwomen, I mean obviously I don\u2019t know but it probably could not\nhave differed that much.\nThey both committed acts that were terrible, so it was just\neasier, once you were in it was just easier to comply with what you\nwere told. Hitler gave a lot of blanket approvals to people, so they\ndidn\u2019t feel the blame for what they did. They were like, \u201cWell,\nHitler okay-ed it, so I can do it,\u201d so it was easier for people to just\nlisten and do terrible things than to stand out and do what\u2019s right 579\nbecause that would cost them their lives, and obviously at this time\npeople are going to act selfishly because they want to live. Robert\nJ. Lifton, in this chapter of this textbook as well, talks about how\npeople would basically have two senses of self. They would have\ntheir normal self and their Nazi self, and they would differentiate\nthese personalities so that, you know, they were, it was essentially\nsplitting a personality so that you, personally as your personal self,\nwould not be committing these terrible acts and you cannot\nattribute what you were doing as your Nazi personality to yourself\npersonality.\nObviously, that\u2019s a more psychological explanation, but\nbasically what he says is, \u201cThe Auschwitz self is also called upon\nthe relation mechanism of derealization, of divesting oneself from\nthe actuality of what one is part of, not experiencing it as real.\u201d\nLater he says, \u201cThe numbing of Auschwitz self was greatly aided\nby the diffusion of responsibility,\u201d like I mentioned before. More\nso, he says, \u201cThe Auschwitz self of the individual doctor,\u201d at this\npoint he\u2019s talking about the Nazi doctors, \u201ccould readily feel \u2018it is\nnot I who killed.\u2019 He was likely to perceive what he did as a 580\ncombination of a military order designated role.\u201d So, when people\nwere told to do terrible things, their mentality was basically, \u201cWell\nsomeone else told me to do it so I\u2019m not to blame here.\u201d\nNow like I said before with women, it\u2019s a little bit different\nbecause women had to actually marry someone of higher status or\ndo something to be able to become a guard in the concentration\ncamp. For men, it was a job that was expected of them, but for\nwomen it was a job that they had to seek out even more. So, they\nwanted to do terrible things and then once they were put in this\nposition of, \u201cWell, I need to listen to my superior,\u201d obviously they\ncommitted the act because they were told to but there\u2019s also\nsomething that I feel is more deeply rooted, and it was malicious\nintent.\nLater in this anthology, there is an excerpt from Zoe\nWaxman called Women in the Holocaust which greatly details,\nagain, women\u2019s roles. She writes, \u201cTo show that people are fallible\nand act just like human beings is not to demonize them, but to\nattempt to present a more rounded picture of responses to extreme\nsuffering.\u201d So, what she\u2019s basically saying is that it\u2019s important to 581\nnote that it wasn\u2019t just one group or the other, this was real, and\nthis is happening. She later says, \u201cLittle reference is made to the\nJewish women who, as a result of intolerable circumstances, acted\ncontrary to traditional expectations of female behavior.\u201d She here\nis referencing some women who would put the survival of\nthemselves above their children, and some of the female Jewish\nKapos who came to mimic the behavior of the S.S. guards. Now\nWaxman is talking about both the women in the concentration\ncamps and the women who acted as guards in the concentration\ncamps, but overall, her message is that women, or anybody really,\ncan act in really unexpected ways under extreme circumstances,\nand this shows both in the sense of a victim and in the sense of a\nperpetrator.\nThe point I\u2019m trying to make here is that, although it is a\nlittle confusing, the women who stepped up to do more than just\nact in politics and have children and listen to the propaganda and\nsimply comply with what was going on in the world, the women\nwho actually became S.S. guards, the women who committed acts\nof violence against the Jews and other targeted groups, they did 582\nmore than just comply. They actually committed violence. I am\nalso saying that compliance is violence, but it\u2019s important to know\nthat it wasn\u2019t just compliance. Women did not just comply; women\nalso did contribute actively to the Holocaust.\nSo, from Jewish Virtual Library, there is a woman named\nVera Wohlauf and she married captain Julius Wohlauf. In 1942, he\nwas the commanding officer of the First Company Police Battalion\n101. They did terrible things. They did mass executions of Jews in\nEastern Poland, and she married him knowing that she did this,\nlike, she married him! There\u2019s no way that you can marry someone\nwho supports something so terrible and not support it yourself.\nEven more so, Jewish Virtual Library says that these wives\nof these people, of the men in the Police Battalion 101, they would\nwitness all these terrible acts against Jews and the deportation of\nall the Jews and they would just sit and watch and that was a way\nthat these women liked to spend their time. They enjoyed it.\nAnother woman was named Hermine Braunsteiner and she was a\nfemale guard in various camps, and not just camps, she also\nworked in killing centers, and she was tried for her heinous acts 583\nand she actually ended up in New York, given U.S. citizenship and\nthen it was revoked when she was tried in Germany and sentenced\nto life in prison.\nAnother woman who actively contributed was named\nMagda Goebbels, forgive me for saying these names wrong, but\nshe was actually the former wife of Joseph Goebbels, who was an\nimportant man in the Holocaust, and she killed her own children,\nwillingly with force. She actually decided to name all of her\nchildren after Hitler by giving them each a name that started with\nthe letter H. The point is that she was a huge admirer of Hitler and\nthen her and her husband committed suicide themselves, and it was\nlater thought that she killed her children because of what they\nwould hear about what her and her husband did as Nazis, and like,\nthey would hear of what their parents did and be so disgusted that\nthey had to kill them.\nThere was another woman known, excuse my language,\nIlse Koch, the Bitch of Buchenwald, and she was married to an\nS.S. commander and she eventually also became the commander of\na camp. She was sentenced to life in prison, but it was reduced 584\neventually, she was rearrested by the West Germans who\nsentenced her to life in prison, but when she ended up dying and\nthey found the letter that she wrote, she wrote, \u201cI cannot do\notherwise. Death is the only deliverance.\u201d So people were so\npassionate about their hatred towards the Jews and perpetrating the\nHolocaust that they would rather die as a result. They would give\nup their life to do what they did. Margaret White, another woman,\nshe married William Joyce, the leader of the British National\nSocialist League and then became the secretary, so she, obviously I\ndon\u2019t know why she married him, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a\ncoincidence that she was able to have that position as a woman\nwithout having married her husband.\nI could go on and on listing different women who did\ndifferent terrible things, who could show you that women did\nperpetrate the Holocaust and women did end up committing\nheinous acts and actively contributed, but the point is here is that\nit\u2019s, people can\u2019t go on learning about the Holocaust think that\nwomen were not as susceptible to acting terrible under extreme\nsituations. 585\nIn the preface of Professor Wendy Adele-Marie\u2019s book that\nshe graciously let me use as a source for this podcast, the book is\ntitled Women as Nazis: Female Perpetrators of the Holocaust, and\nin the preface, she says, \u201cit\u2019s important to remember that German\nand other women during World War II played an important role in\nall levels of the war, from maintaining farms while the men were\naway to conducting business for the Nazi regime.\u201d Millions were\nnot perpetrators, and it is unfair to portray all women that way, but\nwomen\u2019s contributions, whether to the benefit of society or not,\nhave been largely ignored, especially in the context of war. So\nbasically, people didn\u2019t recognize, like obviously not all women\ndid terrible things, but it is so crucial to not ignore the women who\ndid do terrible things.\nProfessor Adele-Marie later says, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand\nwhy women would do something so terrible against themselves,\u201d\nbecause at the end of the day the Nazi party did not support\nwomen. However, she realized that, with regard to crimes against\nhumanity, there was no separation of the sexes, which is essentially\nwhat I\u2019m trying to emphasize here. She says, \u201cWar atrocities 586\ncannot be segregated by gender.\u201d And it\u2019s hard to understand that\nbecause for so long, there wasn\u2019t any evidence or data or public\ninformation that people knew about women, so they just assumed\nthat women did not play a role. And of course, I want to believe\nthat women did good, and there are women out there who did\nwonderful things like saving children, providing homes for\nchildren, risking their own lives to house these children, but at the\nend of the day, it\u2019s, you have to know that gender doesn\u2019t\ndiscriminate against perpetrators of something terrible.\nGiven that women were not typically guards of\nconcentration camps, they actually volunteered to do it. They\nvolunteered. And when, like, going back to the mobilization of\nwomen\u2019s votes, when you give a group of people something that\ngives them more ability to participate in life, government, politics,\netc., that\u2019s something that women, or anybody really, would take.\nBut here, Professor Adele-Marie says, \u201cIf women return to the\ndomestic sphere, and if the enemy of German man was destroyed,\nthe Nazi ideal of masculinity would remain supreme, and Germany\nwould better for it.\u201d So basically, by mobilizing the women to 587\nvote, women were not the enemy anymore. It was the Jews and the\nother targeted groups. It was a way to change the scapegoat. So\nhow could women who volunteered to do something or married\nsomeone with status and got a job become actively violent and\nhorrific in the Holocaust?\nAnd that\u2019s really because women, as Professor Adele-\nMarie puts it, they were in this domestic lifestyle. They were\nmoms, they were housewives, and then, once given the opportunity\nto do something else, they fully stepped into that role. So, if a\nwoman became an S.S. guard, they would do what an S.S. guard\nwould do regardless of their gender. They would do what the male\nS.S. guards do as well, and that\u2019s the importance of women\nperpetrators is that because they were women, that doesn\u2019t make a\ndifference of the crimes they committed. They still committed\nthem regardless of gender or sex. They did them because they had\nthe power to do so.\nAgain, with the sense of purpose, when women held these\npositions, and this is no excuse, only a reason, they felt purpose in\nwhat they did. They felt that they had importance, and again that 588\nstems back to propaganda, Hitler\u2019s very well-thought-out way to\nmanipulate people, but he was able to manipulate women who\npreviously did not have the opportunity to have a terrible role such\nas an S.S. guard, or even more than that, to become someone who\ncan because they can get that power.\nAnother thing is by asking women to have children, he\ncould be seen as protecting womanhood, according to Professor\nAdele-Marie. She writes, \u201cBut sought to downplay the sexuality of\nwomen while promoting fertility. He did this by portraying himself\nas the protector of German womanhood against the incursions of\nthe Vampire Master, which was the Jew. Overall, Hitler made\nwomen feel important even though they could never actually hold\npositions of actual authority or even be considered equal. On\nanother note, as men were getting sent to war, women were able to\nfulfill the roles that men had previously had and that made them\nless domesticated, less of a housewife and more functional in\nsociety, and that was a thing that women liked. That was a thing\nthat was good for women. 589\nHowever, the other hand, you know, the other side of that\nproblem or that scenario is that they were contributing to the war\neffort, which was inevitably bad. Like I said before, women were\nencouraged to have as many babies as possible with different men\nso that they could help create the Aryan race, but even though\nwomen\u2019s sexuality was highly judged by men, this was a way that\nwomen could be sexually free because they were helping the effort\nof National Socialism. So essentially women were given all of\nthese things like the ability to talk about politics, engage in\npolitics, vote, have jobs that were not in the house and become\nmore equal in terms of what they can do that men can do, but were\nnever seen as equal and were used as women for a man\u2019s gain. Not\njust a man\u2019s gain, but a dictatorship\u2019s gain, if you will.\nAs we come to the end of this podcast, there are a few more\nthings I want to talk about. One being Irma Grese, who is infamous\nfor the crimes she committed as a woman during the Holocaust as\nan S.S. guard, as someone who seemingly had authority and then I\nalso want to conclude things. So, let\u2019s start with Irma Grese. Irma\nGrese was a concentration camp guard. She was only twenty-one, 590\nand in retrospect, I\u2019m twenty years old turning twenty-one in April,\nand as a twenty-year-old I really have no idea what I\u2019m doing with\nmy life and for someone so young and so impressionable to do\nsomething so heinous says a lot.\nShe served at Auschwitz and later Bergen-Belsen, actually\njust Belsen, where she was later arrested by the British. She was\ncondemned to death and was hanged. Um, she was actually beat by\nher father for proudly wearing her S.S. uniform, and she was said\nto have a love affair with Josef Mengele- forgive me for the\nnames- but he was one of the doctors in Auschwitz who, again, did\nterrible things. To that regard of her relationship with him, I don\u2019t\nthink it\u2019s a coincidence that their relationship existed and her role\nas a guard existed. So I know that was a lot of information and a\nlot of opinionated things too, so hopefully you\u2019re still with me, but\nI want to summarize how Hitler mobilized women and then in turn\nmade them perpetrators. So initially, national socialism appealed to\nwomen because it gave women all these things. It gave women a\nvoice in politics. It gave women the ability to do things like work\noutside the home. It gave women the ability to voice their opinion 591\nabout women\u2019s rights, and that was something that was great for\nwomen.\nIn a backwards way, it gave women the opportunity to be\nsexually free because children were encouraged. But in turn, that\nwas a manipulative thing that he did because by giving women\nfake power- well, they believed it was real but to Hitler, he knew\nobviously that it was not actual power- by giving them this power\nand making them feel important, he could coerce them into being\nfor the cause of national socialism. So once he gave the women all\nof these things, it makes sense for women to be like, \u201cWell I like\nnational socialism because it does all of this stuff for me as a\nwoman and that\u2019s good\u201d. Thus, women, once they supported the\ncause, began to volunteer to be S.S. guards and work in\nconcentration camps and over time as they would do these jobs,\nthey would get promoted to higher levels of power because they\nfelt a purpose in the thing that they did because they could. And\nthat\u2019s how Hitler mobilized the women\u2019s vote and in turn had\nwomen support the cause. 592\nHe coerced them into believing that it was something good\nwhile having them commit heinous acts and at this point, you can\u2019t\nsay that they were phased by Hitler\u2019s whatever. Because at that\npoint, they believed in national socialism. By giving women rights,\nthey also would need to believe in the terrible things that Hitler\npreached because that was the only way they could get it, right?\nWomen began to believe in Hitler\u2019s nationalist, socialist ideals and\nthat\u2019s how women perpetrated the Holocaust.\nAt this point, you may be thinking, \u201cHow can these women\nbe blamed for what they did?\u201d because they were coerced and\nmanipulated into following national socialism. My answer to that\nis despite the way they were convinced, coerced, however they\nfollowed national socialism, these women still did it and believed\nin what they did until they died. Irma Grese for example, when she\nwas hanged the last thing she said was, in German, translated to\nEnglish: \u201cQuickly.\u201d She didn\u2019t have remorse; she knew what she\ndid was wrong. And like I said, there were other people who, when\nthey died- other women who were tried and sentenced to death,\nthey believed that what they did was right and said death was the 593\nonly way. Alright, and that wraps up this podcast. I hope you\nenjoyed it and I hope you learned something about women\nperpetrators, why women felt that national socialism appealed to\nthem, how women went from being coerced into national socialism\ninto actually carrying out the beliefs of national socialism, and how\nwomen perpetrated the Holocaust.

Over a decade later, in 1944, Henry Morgenthau, then\nSecretary of the Treasury, wrote a report to President Franklin\nDelano Roosevelt about what had been happening to the Jews and\nothers in Nazi occupied Europe. In it, Morgenthau noted that\nOne of the greatest crimes in history, the slaughter of the\nJewish people in Europe, is continuing unabated. This\nGovernment has for a long time maintained that its policy\nis to work out programs to save those Jews and other\npersecuted minorities of Europe who could be saved.\nYou are probably not as familiar as I with the utter failure\nof certain officials in our State Department, who are\ncharged with actually carrying out this policy, to take any\neffective action to prevent the extermination of the Jews\nin German-controlled Europe. (Morgenthau, 1944) 596\nMorgenthau (1943) further stated that the general public did not\nknow of the 1943 documents that showed how the U.S. State\nDepartment stalled on negotiating for the rescue of Jews. The\nWorld Jewish Congress attempted to negotiate with the U.S. State\nDepartment and other agencies to rescue Jews from France and\nRomania, citing specific information about other mass murders of\nthe Jews. Morgenthau (1944) lamented at the inaction of the\ngovernment to intervene, but when finally, there was an agreement,\nMorgenthau cited that the British government was in\ndisagreement about how to handle the rescue of Jews. Morgenthau\nwrote: \u201cin simple terms, the British were apparently prepared to\naccept the probable death of thousands of Jews in enemy territory\nbecause of \u201cthe difficulties of disposing of any considerable\nnumber of Jews should they be rescued\u201d Morgenthau (1944). He\nalso alluded to the fact that the U.S. State Department\u2019s\nBreckinridge Long about-face when it came to Jewish matters was\nperhaps to absolve his guilt towards not allowing more Jews to\nmigrate safely to the U.S. In 1944, millions were already dead. 597\nIn the second part of his report to the president,\nMorgenthau (1944) titled it SUPRESSION OF FACTS\nREGARDING HITLER\u2019S EXTERMINATION OF JEWS IN\nEUROPE, and he specifically cited an earlier reports and cables\nthat specifically stated the \u201cmany thousands of Jews in Eastern\nEurope were being slaughtered pursuant to a policy embarked\nupon the German Government for the complete extermination of\nthe Jews in Europe\u201d (Morgenthau, 1944). Morgenthau (1944) then\nasserted that the murder of the Jews was accelerating, and that in\n1942, the world governments knew about the Holocaust. He ends\nhis report with these words:\nJudging from the almost complete failure of the State\nDepartment to achieve any results, the strong suspicion\nmust be that they are not few. This much is certain,\nhowever. The matter of rescuing the Jews from\nextermination is a trust too great to remain in the hands of\nmen who are indifferent, callous, and perhaps even hostile.\nThe task is filled with difficulties. Only a fervent will to 598\naccomplish, backed by persistent and untiring effort can\nsucceed where time is so precious. (Morgenthau, 1944)\nHowever, the goal was to win the war then rescue, a conclusion\ndrawn from this and other documents from the time. By the time\nliberation of the camps began on 23 June 1944, when the Soviets\nhad liberated Majdanek, it was too late for action when the war in\nthe west was being waged hard. Auschwitz was liberated on 27\nJanuary 1945, and other liberations followed.\nNazi Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945. Between\n1933 and 1945, the enormity of the crimes perpetrated against\nhumanity, war crimes, and crimes against the peace came out in\nwar crimes trials, conducted by the Allies and then within\nindividual countries. The hunt for the perpetrators is still\nunderway, even though these individuals are elderly.\nHolocaust education is vital, given the current global\nclimate, especially in the United States. Genocide occurs when\n\u201cgovernments pass laws allowing legal racism to become a part of\nmainstream norms; the public accepts these actions because of the\nuse of propaganda and terror. Consequently, genocide arises 599\nbecause of ignorance, and acceptance or silence of the populace\u201d\n(Adele-Marie, 2009). Attacks against marginalized groups and\npeoples have not ended. Holocaust education is vital in the 21st\ncentury, since \u201cwith xenophobia, antisemitism, and racism on the\nrise, there is a pressing need for Holocaust education in schools.\nSuch history lessons, taught by competent teachers, could be an\neffective antidote to all these ugly ills\u201d (Kirshner, 2020, para. 12).\nTherefore, education empowers and provides a framework of\nprevention and is a weapon against hate.\nIn 2020, Representative Carolyn Maloney authored H.R.\n943, the Never Again Education Act. The U.S. House then passed\na law to \u201callocate $10 million in federal funding over five years to\nfurther Holocaust education\u201d (Maloney, 2020, para. 7). This bill\ncements the rationale for mission, vision, and goals of this text.\nEducation combats antisemitism, hate, and racism, as \u201cHolocaust\neducation provides a context in which to learn about the danger of\nwhat can happen when hate goes unchallenged and when there is\nindifference to the oppression of others\u201d (Maloney, 2020, para. 4).\nBullying can lead to hate, and hate can lead to rage, violence, 600\nmurder, and even genocide. Together, we have a responsibility to\nwork towards preventing ignorance, that leads to hate, racism,\nantisemitism, and anti-immigrant prejudices.\nReferences\nAdele-Marie, W.

Wiedergutmachung is the German word for an\nagreement made in 1953 by the German government to pay the\ndirect Jewish survivors for their loss of family, livelihood and the\ncrimes committed directly against them. Since these original\npayments, several other funds have been created for survivors. The\nGerman government has handed over most reparations\u2019 claims to\nthe Claims Conference, a Jewish organization which provides\ndirect reparations payments and funding to social welfare\norganizations around the world. This essay will trace the decision\nto accept reparations in the 1950s, later developments with the\nClaims Conference and will finish with an explanation of the role\nsocial services agencies have in the restitution process. 602\nHistory of Reparations Agreements and the Role of Social\nServices Agencies\nRestitution means to make whole again. After the Second\nWorld War there was nothing Germany could do to ever restore\nEuropean Jewry, and the future relationship between Jews and\nGermany remained a polarizing issue in both communities.\nReparations being made available to Jewish survivors shortly after\nthe Second World War was an important step for German society\nto acknowledge their crimes and attempt to financially compensate\nthe survivors of the crimes of National Socialism. From the\nvantage point of 2021, the fact that Germany would compensate\nhundreds of thousands of Jewish survivors since 1953 is generally\ntaken for granted. Among Jews, the decision to accept German\nfunds was fiercely debated and had an enormous impact on Israeli\nsociety.\nThe issue was controversial in West Germany as well, with\nlarge portions of the population feeling little guilt towards the\nJews, or if they did, felt their current circumstances in immediate\npost war Germany should be the priority, not dwelling on the past. 603\nEventually the agreement was a major step in normalizing relations\nbetween Israel and West Germany and created an important model\nfor compensating victims of state violence. Payments to survivors\nmeant for many an important step in rebuilding their lives. An\nacknowledgment of suffering is one of the most important roles\nreparation payments can play in a survivor\u2019s life, and the funds are\na lifeline for many survivors. The expansion of criteria for\neligibility as time went on also was an important step in\nrecognizing survivors who suffered persecution but never received\ncompensation because their persecution did not meet the original\nrequirements of German law. This essay will trace the decision to\naccept reparations from Germany, the creation of the Claims\nConference and BEG laws from West Germany, later\ndevelopments with the Claims Conference, and will finish with an\noverview of the important role social services agencies play\nhelping in the reparations process.\nDecision to Accept Reparations\nReparations from Germany to the Jewish people had\nalready been discussed during the Second World War and the issue 604\nby the end of the war was in the hands of the 4 Allied governments\nthat had gained power over a defeated Germany: the US, USSR,\nUK, and France (Rosensaft, 2001). Offices were set up for future\nrestitution claims in various administrative zones, but no new\nmajor developments came on the issue until March 1951, when\nIsraeli foreign minister Moshe Sharett submitted a note to the 4\nAllied governments claiming a recompense of $1.5 billion to the\nState of Israel from the German Federal Republic (Rosensaft,\n2001). The number was based on the cost of resettling 500,000\nJewish victims in Israel, at $3,000 per person.\nIn their replies to Israel\u2019s claim, the three Western Allies\ndeclined to take any action, the U.S. and UK noting that they\nwould not \u201cimpose\u201d upon the FRG (West Germany) the debt of\nreparations payments to Israel (Rosensaft, 2001). The implication\nbeing that if Israel wanted reparations, they would have to deal\ndirectly with the FRG (Rosensaft, 2001). On September 27, 1951,\nWest German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer gave a speech to his\ngovernment that stated his government was ready to compensate 605\nIsrael and representatives of Diaspora Jewry for reparations\n(Henry, 2002).\nWhat followed this announcement, which would be a\ncrucial moment in German history, was the creation of the Claims\nConference in New York, a collection of 23 major Jewish national\nand international organizations, with each member agency\ndesignating two members to the Board (Henry, 2002). The Claims\nConference had the task of negotiating with the German\ngovernment a program of indemnification for the material damages\nto Jewish individuals and to the Jewish people caused by Germany\nthrough the Holocaust. The organizations on the Claims\nConference Board have remained almost entirely the same to this\nday. The Claims Conference continues this role today and has been\nnegotiating new funds for survivors throughout the decades. In its\nopening statement, the Claims Conference delegation gave support\nfor the claims of their future negotiating partner, the young state of\nIsrael (Claims Conference Publications, 2021). Important for\ndistinction is that the Israeli claims bore no relationship to the 606\nJewish material losses that the Claims Conference would\nadminister.\nThe Claims Conference pursued compensation for\nindividual victims for damages resulting from Nazi persecution,\nand a \"global payment\" for relief and rehabilitation of Nazi victims\n(Rosensaft, 2001). The Claims Conference demands came with a\nstrong caveat. \"We are ready to negotiate on certain claims of a\nmaterial nature. But we want to make clear from the beginning that\nthere can be no negotiation on moral claims\u201d (Henry, 2002). Public\ndebate on the issue of reparations from Germany to Israel remains\none of the fiercest in Israeli history.\nSupporting reparations on the basis to sustain Israel\u2019s\neconomy was Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, the first prime\nminister of Israel. In a telling statement to the members of the\ncentral committee of his Mapai party he claimed that there are two\napproaches on the matter. \u201cOne is the Ghetto Jew\u2019s approach and\nother is of an independent people. I don\u2019t want to run after a\nGerman and spit in his face. I don\u2019t want to run after anybody. I\nwant to sit here and build here. I\u2019m not going to America to take 607\npart in a vigil against Adenauer (West German Chancellor)\u201d\n(Sharett, 2011). This view of \u201cGhetto Jews\u201d would remain a\nnegative stereotype in Israeli post-war society and speaks to the\ndivide between settlers and recent immigrants present in the\ncountry. One of the main figures vehemently opposed to the\nagreement was Menachem Begin, head of the Jewish nationalist\nparty, Herut, precursor to the Likud, who also held personal\nanimosity for Ben-Gurion (Sharett, 2011). This was not just a\npersonal grudge but stemmed from the Altalena Affair, a\nconfrontation between the IDF and Begin-led Irgun forces in 1948\nwhich resulted in more than a dozen dead.\nDebate in the Knesset on the issue of an agreement with\nGermany began in early January of 1952, immediately Begin\ncalled for organized demonstrations in the streets against an\nIsraeli-West German agreement (Sharett, 2011). Inside the\nKnesset, socialists and right-wing deputies attacked the idea of\ncooperating with West Germany, protesting the agreement on\nvarious grounds. In January of 1952, riots broke out as some\n15,000 demonstrators gathered outside the Knesset, some hurled 608\nstones and the police used tear gas to disperse the crowd\n(Rosensaft, 2001). Begin and Ben-Gurion exchanged insults during\ndebate in the Knesset and Begin was suspended for three months\nfor his \u201cunruly behavior\u201d (Rosensaft, 2001). In the end, the Ben-\nGurion government narrowly obtained Knesset endorsement of\ndirect Israeli-German negotiations by a vote of sixty to fifty-one,\nwith five abstentions and four members absent (Sharett, 2011).\nSegments of the Jewish population viewed the payments as\nblood money and did not want to enter any negotiation with the\nGermans (National Library of Israel. 2021). The scale and\nimportance of the issue is remarkable, as the historical context\ninvolved so many emotional and political issues during the first\nyears of a new nation. Central to the critique of an Israeli-West\nGerman agreement was that a nation should not create economic\nties with a government that not only 6 years before was murdering\nJews up until the liberation of the camps, and had almost destroyed\nEuropean Jewry (Sharett, 2011). To accept money and financial\ncompensation for the Holocaust, by definition, reparations does\nenter the realm of monetizing suffering, and who would receive 609\nthat compensation was an important question that Israeli society\nfaced only 6 years after the Holocaust.\nThe matter was so sensitive that Israeli state authorities\nrelied on a little used Hebrew term, shilumim, which stresses\npayment and avoids describing the nature of the payment (National\nLibrary of Israel, 2021). From the perspective of those approving\nof negotiations, Jewish assets in Europe had been looted, and the\nyoung Jewish state was struggling economically, relying heavily\non foreign investment and lacking infrastructure. In the world we\nhave built, monetary compensation is generally our only way of\nlegal compensation for wrongs done against an individual and a\ncommunity, this the basis of civil judgments in our American legal\nsystem. Israel would be receiving large scale financial\ncompensation for the Holocaust, and the degree to which Israel\nwas a representative of the whole of the Jewish people was fiercely\ndebated, as it still is today, though beyond the scope of this essay.\nIn contrast, payments directly to survivors were supported by those\nopposed to Israel making an economic agreement with Germany\n(Sharett, 2011). This view resulted from a concern among 610\npoliticians on the right and left over the Ben-Gurion government\nmaking an agreement with West Germany, even though it did not\nnormalize relations, this came in 1965.\nA very different political and social situation existed in the\nearly 1950s in Israel, and understanding the various political\nideologies and factions is crucial for studying the debate around\naccepting a reparations agreement with West Germany in 1952.\nThe short period of time since the Holocaust, the shock\nexperienced by the Jewish public as its existence was realized, and\nthe signs of Germany\u2019s quick rebound aroused understandable\napprehension in Israeli society.\nWho are you going to demand the assets from? I shall bring\na simple example: Simon set fire to the house of Ruben\u2019s\nfather and Ruben\u2019s father died in the raging flames. What\ndoes Ruben do? He might give up the house where his\nfather burned to death. He might go to court and appoint\nhimself a prosecutor in a civil lawsuit and demand that he\nshould be compensated for the value of the house. But in\nwhat untamed tribe will you witness the son of the 611\nmurdered person demand the value of the house from the\nmurderer? But in your view, the orphans who lost their\nparents go directly to the murderer. Not to demand\n\u201cransom\u201d as you say, but supposedly to receive the value of\nthe homes in which your parents were burned to death. In\nwhat uncivilized tribe can you witness such a disgusting\nact? What are you wishing to turn the People of Israel into\n\u2013 people who nurtured and taught culture for 4,000 years?\u201d\n(excerpt of speech given to Knesset on January 7, 1952 by\nMenachem Begin)\nAs evidence of the militant opposition to the agreement, the\nactions of Menachem Begin and other Jewish nationalist actions\nduring this time are telling.\nThe speech above is one of the many Begin gave in his\nimpassioned denouncement of negotiations to members of the\nKnesset during debate (Sharett, 2011). In March of 1952, one year\nafter the Israeli note to the 4 Allied powers, a bomb addressed to\nWest German Chancellor Adenauer was detected, killing a\ndisposal expert and injuring two others (Sharett, 2011). French 612\ndetectives arrested five Israelis in Paris, all of whom were linked to\nthe Zionist group Irgun Tsvai Leumi, of which Begin had many\nties (Sharett, 2011).\nAdenauer did not want the incident to derail the\nnegotiations between the Claims Conference and Israel and\ndismissed the acts to \u201cmadmen\u201d (Sharett, 2011). One of the\nconspirators, Elieser Sundit, implicated Menachem Begin in the\nplot in a memoir written shortly after the former Prime Minister\npassed away in 1992. He was summoned by Begin to his Tel Aviv\nhome (during this time Begin was politically isolated, and\nincreasingly impulsive), and claimed that Begin supported\nsomething being done against Adenauer and reparations (Sharett,\n2011). Sudit remarked in an interview with Haaretz in 2006, \u201cWe\nthought the Germans should pay directly to the survivors of the\nHolocaust and that the government of Israel should not take the\nmoney from them in the name of the Jewish people and buy\ntractors with it for the kibbutzim\u201d (Harding, 2006). The political\nunrest of this time is one reflection of the trauma the Holocaust had\non Jewish life. Varying political responses resulted from its 613\naftermath, and these came into conflict during the Israeli debate on\nreparations.\nBEG and Expansion\nIn the end, even with the protests, the Knesset approved\npursuit of reparations with West Germany, and an agreement was\nmade between the 3 parties involved to provide financial\nrestitution to Jewish victims, signed on September 10, 1952, in\nLuxembourg. Under the agreement in 1953, West Germany agreed\nto pay a total of $845 million: $100 million earmarked for\nallocation by the Claims Conference and the remainder to Israel\n(Rosensaft, 2001). Direct compensation distributed by the Claims\nConference to individuals would be paid in annual installments\nover a period of 14 years (between April 1, 1953, and March 31,\n1966). This form of compensation was referred to by the German\ngovernment as Wiedergutmachung [making good again]; however\nthe Claims Conference did not accept this term, and the program is\nknown as BEG, shorthand for Bundesentsch\u00e4digungsgesetz, the\nWest German laws covering compensation for Holocaust\nsurvivors. The money to Israel was split - 30 percent was to pay for 614\nIsrael's crude oil purchases in the United Kingdom and with the\nbalance of 70 percent, Israel was to buy ferrous and nonferrous\nmetals, steel, chemical, industrial, and agricultural products from\nGermany (Honig, 1954). The agreement with West Germany had\nan enormous impact on the Israeli economy and helped build the\ninfrastructure of the young Jewish state.\nThe agreement made between Israel, the Claims\nConference and West Germany was a historic event as it\nrecognized that governments should attempt to right their historical\nwrongs in the form of financial compensation. All three entities\nthat signed the agreement did not exist during the war, reflective of\nthe large changes to world politics that occurred directly after the\nHolocaust. Survivors now began their process of applying and\nbeing evaluated for their individual compensation under BEG. The\nClaims Conference also began distributing funds to Jewish\ncommunities and agencies across Europe and the world, with a\ngoal of helping rebuild Jewish life. Hundreds of thousands of\nindividual claims were submitted between the 1950s and 60s\n(Rosensaft, 2001). 615\nCompensation was not uniform, and there were anomalies\nin which victims who endured the same persecution received\nwidely disparate treatment under the German laws. Compensation\ndepended on prewar citizenship, the location and duration of\nincarceration, the extent and nature of the damages suffered, and\nassorted other criteria, including where the survivor lived after the\nwar (Henry, 2002). The Claims Conference continued to negotiate\nwith Germany for compensation for individual victims after the\nthree indemnification laws had been enacted. The last deadline for\napplying to BEG was in 1969. It is believed there were serious\ndeficiencies in West Germany's indemnification laws, which\noriginally were limited to certain Nazi victims who were in the\nWest by October 1953. Scores of thousands of victims were\nsubsequently able to flee from Eastern Europe and the Soviet\nUnion in the post war decades (Claims Conference Publications,\n2021).\nBeginning in 1975, the Claims Conference began\nnegotiating for compensation for survivors who were refugees\nfrom Soviet Bloc countries, including efforts to extend the BEG 616\ndeadline (Claims Conference Publications, 2021). Finally, in 1980\nthe Conference reached an agreement with West Germany for the\ncreation of the Hardship Fund, which provided one-time payments\nto victims, primarily from Eastern Europe, who arrived in the West\nafter the BEG deadline. After the fall of the Soviet Union,\nsurvivors in the FSU also received compensation through further\nnegotiations between the Claims Conference and Germany,\nresulting in the Central and Eastern European Fund (CEEF). The\nClaims Conference has approved over 33,000 Holocaust survivors\nfor this type of payment (Claims Conference Publications, 2021).\nFor those survivors residing in the West, the Claims Conference\nhas approved approximately 495,983 Jewish victims of Nazi\npersecution for payment from the Hardship Fund, approximately\n1.5$ billion (Claims Conference Publications, 2021). During the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, the German Government and Claims\nConference negotiated for an additional 2,200 Euro to be paid to\nall Hardship Fund recipients, with distribution to be split into\npayments in 2021 and 2022. 617\nIn 1990, seeking to compensate those survivors who hid,\nwere in a ghetto, or in a concentration camp who did not receive\nBEG, the Claims Conference negotiated with the German\ngovernment for a new fund, the Article II fund. This agreement\nresulted from the unification of Germany, furthering the Claims\nConference pursuit of compensation for survivors of the Holocaust\nwho had received little or no indemnification (Claims Conference\nPublications, 2021). East Germany did not enter into any\nreparations\u2019 agreements during its existence. Under Article II, a\nunified Germany agreed to establish a fund for victims who had\nreceived little or no compensation previously, meaning BEG\nrecipients would not be eligible.\nThe \"Article II Fund\" is still administered by the Claims\nConference and provides monthly pensions of \u20ac580 (as of most\nrecent negotiations for 2021). Applicants must meet the eligibility\nelements of Article 2, which has certain time restrictions and\ncriteria related to type of persecution. The income of the applicant\nis also considered as one of many factors determining eligibility.\nUnlike B.E.G. pensions, it did not provide for cost-of-living 618\nadjustments, and all recipients receive the same amount. The\nClaims Conference has approved over 100,000 Holocaust\nsurvivors for payment from this fund and has paid a total of\napproximately 4.9 billion dollars total to survivors throughout its\nexistence (Claims Conference, 2021).\nThe Role of Social Services Agencies\nSince its founding, the Claims Conference has worked\nwith Jewish Social Services agencies to distribute services and\nfinancial help to Holocaust survivors. One of these institutions is\nHolocaust Community Services (HCS) in Chicago, which is a\nprogram of the Jewish United Fund and is administered under CJE\nSeniorLife, a larger elder care organization. The Claims\nConference provides Social Welfare funds for survivors in 47\ncountries through partnerships with local social service\norganizations. Social Welfare funds are distinct from persecution-\nbased reparations, social welfare funds are awarded to social\nservices agencies to provide services to a survivor community. The\nClaims Conference annually and meticulously negotiates with 619\nGerman government on the amount of Social Welfare funds\nawarded to agencies.\nHCS serves over 1,900 Holocaust Survivors living in\nIllinois with financial, functional and psychosocial assistance.\nBeyond conducting comprehensive assessments to determine need\nfor financial assistance for food, medication, and homecare, HCS\nalso helps with one-time emergency needs, transportation, and\nprovides support groups, wellness classes, social events, education\nand professional training, and restitution and reparations\nassistance. During evaluations, care managers take down a\npersecution history of new clients, review their compensation, and\nthen work with the survivor and their family to evaluate options for\npotentially eligible funds, and compile their story, and help file\nclaims or appeals. Many survivors were children during the war, so\nhelp in researching the conditions of place and time is extremely\nimportant when memories and documentation are lacking.\nMost of the clients Holocaust Community Services serve\nreceive reparations from one of the two funds administrated by the\nClaims Conference. As outlined above, the Article 2 fund, agreed 620\nto in 1990, was designated for survivors who were in camps,\nghettos, living in hiding or under false identity, while the Hardship\nFund, agreed to in 1980, is for those survivors who fled, hid or\nsuffered other persecution by the Nazis. The Child Survivor Fund,\nnegotiated in 2015, is also administered by Claims Conference and\nprovides an additional one-time compensation to those who were\nchildren during the war (defined as being born in 1928 or later) and\nsuffered similar persecution as required for approval by the Article\n2 Fund. HCS also aids in the application process and handling of\nfunds directly administered by the German Government, but not\nthrough Claims Conference. These pension programs include a\n\u201cghetto work pension\u201d called ZRBG, a slave labor fund (negotiated\nin 2000 in order to indemnify German corporations such as BMW\nfor their use of slave labor) and management of ongoing BEG\npensions. When negotiations result in the expansion of criteria, it is\nthe role of social services agencies to reach out and inform the\ncommunity of survivors and help coordinate the application and\napproval process. 621\nThere are compensation and pension programs not under\ncontrol of the Claims Conference or the German government.\nPension programs and Holocaust reparations programs offered by\nother European states to survivors living abroad only developed\nafter most of the survivors had passed away, many of the changes\nhappening within the past decade. A complete summary of these\nprograms is out of scope for this paper but there has been a great\ndisparity in how non-German, (including Austrian) countries have\ncompensated victims of the Holocaust. This has been especially\ntrue for victims living abroad, most of whom were not German but\nwhose only recourse for compensation for their suffering during\nthe Holocaust was through the German government or the Claims\nConference and their negotiations.\nRecent compensation opportunities have also often had a\nlimited time window for application. In 2015, after years of failed\nattempts by survivors living in United States to sue the French\nstate railway SNCF, the French government agreed to a 60$\nmillion fund, available to direct family members, spouses or\nchildren of victims who had been transported to their deaths on 622\nSNCF trains (BBC, 2014). The SNCF was in the middle of bidding\non U.S. rail contracts during this time, and the agreement\nindemnified the SNCF from further legal claims by U.S. survivors\n(BBC, 2014). The program offered comparably large sums of\ndirect payments, successful applicants receiving approximately\n100,000$, and was only open for application for 2 years. In 2018,\nthe Claims Conference negotiated a one-time payment of 200$ to\nbe paid to Jewish victims who lived under the Romanian regime\nbetween 1937-1944, the window for applications closed in\nNovember of 2019 (Claims Conference Publications, 2021). As\nevidenced, the compensation offered to Jewish victims varies\nhighly, and although the past two decades have seen an increase in\ncompensation programs offered by European countries, it is\nimportant to remember that most of the survivors who suffered\npersecution by collaborating forces or local populations had\nalready passed away before these were offered.\nHCS staff has experience working with these various\nothers restitution programs offered by a European state that a\nsurvivor may be eligible for. When the Claims Conference- 623\nRomanian Fund was announced in 2018 it was the job of social\nservices agencies like HCS to help identify survivors and facilitate\nthe application process. Poland has a war pension program titled\n\u201cThe Legislation on War Veterans and Victims of War and Post-\nWar Oppression\u201d, and many HCS clients have applied and been\napproved for this pension in the past 6 years. This program was\nonly made available to Polish survivors without a Polish bank\naccount in March of 2014 and provides a monthly pension for Jews\nand non-Jews who were detained in either a ghetto, camp, prison;\nor were forcibly deported to the Soviet Union; or had served in the\nPolish military (WRJO, 2015).\nTo receive approval from the Claims Conference or any\nEuropean government, there are requirements in the type and\nlength of persecution. Many survivors had various experiences\nduring the war, some qualifying for Article 2 or Hardship Fund or\nanother compensation program, while other experiences that were\njust as harrowing for the survivor, do not. Survivors also might\nperceive, remember, and tell their stories in a different manner, not\nrecognizing what details could be important. An example of this is 624\nhelping a survivor apply to the ZRBG (Ghetto Work Pension),\nmeant to compensate those who performed \u201cvoluntary\u201d work in the\nghetto, thus contributing to the German economy. For Jewish\nsurvivors, the thought of any work being done during the\nHolocaust as voluntary can be difficult to grasp, and the definition\nof what constates \u201cwork\u201d for eligibility is highly fraught. Survivors\nhad a myriad of experiences during the war , but with knowing the\nright questions to ask, HCS can consistently act as advocates for\nour clients.\nReparations\u2019 requirements are further complicated by\nthe fact that borders and allegiances changed throughout the period\nof 1938-1945, and this can later impact reparation fund eligibility\nfrom various countries. HCS staff with a knowledge of the\ncomplex history of the Holocaust geographic and Nazi occupation\ntimelines can evaluate a survivor\u2019s story, identify what funds they\ncould apply to and perform research and inquiries on more\ncomplex cases. Dealing with European governments can be\ndifficult for the survivors, and HCS acts as an advocate in their\npursuit of reparations, limiting the contact a survivor must have 625\nwith the Claims Conference or German government, while still\nrelentlessly working with them in the application and approval\nprocess.\nTo demonstrate the impact reparations payments can have\nfor a survivor, the history that reparations can help revive, and the\nnuances involved in the application process, a case study is helpful.\nDirector of Holocaust Community Services, Yonit Hoffman, wrote\nan account of Shika Kuperman\u2019s Holocaust experience for\nChicago Jewish News in 2018, the following is information\nobtained from her research and writing. Shika Kuperman was born\nin New York in 1916 to recent immigrants from Ukraine, his\nparents moved back to Ukraine shortly after his birth partly due to\nhis mother\u2019s political beliefs and the call of revolution. They\nmoved back to Dunayetsky, which was established as a Shtetl in\nthe 16th century and later was known as a hub of Jewish and\nZionist literary scholars and collective farming.\nShika met his wife Anna in Kiev, where he was studying in\ntrade school, they moved back to Dunayetsky shortly before the\nNazi invasion. Shika was working as a blacksmith when the Nazis 626\ncame to Dunayevtsky and he was immediately drafted in the Red\nArmy to defend the Soviet Union. The Germans occupied\nDunayevetsky in summer of 1941. Shika\u2019s parents, siblings, and\nhis wife Anna were forcibly moved there. During the three-year\noccupation, the Nazis carried out public hangings and mass\nexecutions of the Jews. A witness interviewed by Yahad-In Unum\n(Father Patrick Desbois\u2019 organization) described one of these\nexecutions: \u201cThe Germans gathered 700 Jews. They took them into\nthe mine where the water rose until their knees. Afterwards, the\nentrance was exploded, and Jews were suffocated inside.\u201d In fact,\nrecords show that on May 8, 1942, nearly 2,300 Jews were buried\nalive in those phosphate mines. This history is crucial for\nunderstanding how the Nazis immediately implemented a variety\nof ways of killing during the deadliest phase of the Holocaust in\n1942.\nAnna, Shika\u2019s wife survived but his parents, siblings, and\ntheir families died there. Shika only learned about this tragedy\nwhen he returned to his native Dunayevtsy in search of his family.\nHis military battalion was surrounded by Nazis, and except for a 627\nfew people who managed to get out, everyone was killed. Shika,\nescaped and knew how to survive in the woods. He was on his own\nfor about a month, and then he was able to walk and crawl to\nDunayevtsy to meet with his wife, Anna, in the ghetto.\nThe local Jews and the Jews from neighboring villages\nhad been herded into an area fenced with barbed wire that\nstretched from the market square to a pond. Those leaving the\nghetto were either going to work or headed to their deaths. Jews\nworked long days with the threat of cruelty and death ever present.\nThe work being voluntary in that Shika on his own initiative\npresented himself to work to the occupying forces. Anyone who\npaused to catch a breath, stumbled or sat down was lashed or was\nshot on the spot. While working, some Ukrainians secretly passed\nfood through the barbed wire fence. Workers carried stones from\ntown to town, building German military outposts and Aryan settler\nstructures. Again, by studying the work Shika was doing, we gain\ninsight into the policies of the Nazis for Ukraine, which was to be\ncolonized by Aryans after the Nazi project of the Holocaust. 628\nHis work thus allows us to see how the Holocaust in Ukraine was\nmotivated not only by racial hatred, but also due to the Nazi plans\nfor a new Europe.\nOne of these projects involved the installation of a\nwaterwheel, connected to power a pump and a fountain so that the\nGebietskommissar - the head of administration of the Dunayevtsy\ndistrict - exhausted after the daily executions, could enjoy his quiet\nevenings of meditation. In late October 1942, Shika and his wife\nappeared at the home of Iosif and Anna Gavelskiy, non-Jewish\nfamily friends. They told the Gaveslkiys how they had escaped\nwhen, yet another group of Jews was taken to death pits. They hid\ninitially in an attic, but every night Shika would go down and help\nbuild a small hiding place in a barn. Shika and his wife spent 18\nmonths hidden there. They were liberated on March 26, 1944.\nIn the spring of 2018, more than 75 years after his life\nwas forever disrupted and changed, he received compensation for\nhis suffering, specifically the work done under brutal conditions in\nand outside the ghetto. The work Shika had done in the ghetto had\nbeen correctly identified by HCS as qualifying for the \u201cGhetto 629\nWork Pension\u201d who reached out to William Marks, Esq, a\nreparations expert who helped navigate a claim with the German\ncourts. He was awarded a significant sum of back pay and monthly\ncompensation. Shika was 105 years old. Shortly after reaching\nthese two milestones, Shika passed away. Shika\u2019s story reflects the\nbroad range of harrowing circumstances and atrocities Jews in the\nSoviet Union were subjected to and contributes to our\nunderstanding of the variety of methods which Germany, along\nwith local collaborators, used to murder Jews in Ukraine. By\ncontinuing to pursue reparations for victims of the Holocaust, we\nare allowed to actively participate in commemorating the lost and\nto gain recognition for the suffering of the survivors.\nWe also gain valuable eyewitness testimony to the\nHolocaust in areas such as the Soviet Union, lesser known or\nmemorialized, which documents death and survival \u2013 and is an\nimportant and crucial task for Holocaust memory for Soviet Jewry.\nBy pursuing a small bit of justice for the victims of the Shoah, we\nalso call attention to details of the implementation of the Holocaust\nthat are generally less known to the public. The pain survivors had 630\nin their lives, knowing how their loved ones were murdered, and of\ntheir own struggle in survival, is something societies around the\nglobe must never forget. The pursuit of reparations for survivors\nplays an important role in documenting the evidence of the\nHolocaust and in ensuring recognition and some modicum of\njustice for elderly Holocaust survivors. Social services agencies\nthat serve Holocaust survivors will continue in their role as\nadvocates for survivors, and in partnership with the Claims\nConference, can help ensure that survivors live their last years with\nthe dignity they deserve.\nPartial List of Current Claims Conference Funds Available to\nSurvivors\nArticle 2 Fund\nLimited to Jewish Nazi victims who were persecuted as\nJews and who meet the following eligibility criteria: Were\nincarcerated in a concentration camp* or labor battalion during\nspecific time periods as defined by the German Ministry of\nFinance on its website; or were imprisoned for at least 3 months in\na ghetto as defined by the German Ministry of Finance; or Were 631\nimprisoned for at least 3 months in certain \u201copen ghettos\u201d as\ndefined by the German Ministry of Finance; or were in hiding for\nat least 4 months, under inhumane conditions, without access to the\noutside world in German Nazi-occupied territory or Nazi satellite\nstates (Nazi instigation); or Lived illegally under false identity or\nwith false papers for at least 4 months under inhumane conditions\nin German Nazi-occupied territory or Nazi satellite states (Nazi\ninstigation); or were a fetus during the time that their mother\nsuffered persecution as described above.\nHardship Fund\nEligibility under the Hardship Fund is limited to Jewish\nNazi victims who were persecuted as Jews and who meet the\nfollowing eligibility criteria: Suffered deprivation of liberty (such\nas, ghetto, forced labor, camp, hiding or false identity); or Fled\nfrom the Nazi regime; or Fled between June 22, 1941 and January\n27, 1944 from areas of the Soviet Union that were generally up to\n100 kilometers from the most easterly advance of the German\narmy (Wehrmacht) but were not later occupied by the Nazis; or\nStayed in Leningrad at some time between September 1941 and 632\nJanuary 1944 or if they fled from there during this period; or\nSuffered \u201crestriction of liberty\u201d as defined by the German\nGovernment, (such as were forced to wear the Star of David); or\nwere restricted in movement, like lived under curfew, suffered\ncompulsory registration with limitation of residence, (e.g.\nr\u00e9sidence forc\u00e9e), etc; or Suffered during the relevant period Nazi\npersecution in Algeria such as loss of education, loss of property or\neconomic, professional and social restrictions; or were a fetus at\nthe time that their mother suffered persecution described above.\nChild Survivor Fund\nSame eligibility as Article 2, additional payment to\nsurvivors born after January 1, 1928.\nIf you know of a Holocaust survivor who might be eligible\nfor any fund listed here or has not received any type of\ncompensation, please feel free to contact either myself\nAdam.Yunis@cje.net or Heather.Klain@cje.net\nSpecial thanks to New York based social worker Robert\nLebowitz, who through his website and NGO- 633\npolishpensionhelp.org has helped many HCS clients receive a\nmonthly pension from the Polish government.\nReferences\nBegin, M.

Terrible stuff. Why does the F\u00fchrer put up with\nit?\u201d What does this statement reveal about the Nazi reaction to\ntheir own propaganda? Consider the reaction from Joseph\nGoebbels, the Reich Minister of Propaganda, a vile anti-Semite\nwho bore responsibility for the Holocaust. Why did he react the\nway that he did towards The Poisonous Mushroom?\nStephani Richards-Wilson (by special permission)\nThe White Rose 639\n1.

Education is\nkey to this process. We must acknowledge, examine, and grow\nfrom our past mistakes to not see such atrocities again. Yom\nKippur, the Jewish New Year, is the time when Jews acknowledge\nthe year\u2019s shortcomings and ask for forgiveness. We recall our\nancestors during a memorial service called Yizkor (Hebrew for\n\u201cremember\u201d), during which we bring light into the world by\nlighting a candle or turning on a Yahrzeit light (memorial\nlightbulb) which sits on our synagogue\u2019s walls, our way of\nbringing our family members\u2019 light back into our world. We ask\nGod to remember those who are no longer with us, whether\nexecuted or departed. When we recite Yizkor, we renew and\nstrengthen the connection between our loved ones and us.\nRegardless of if my family was decimated during the Holocaust or 647\nescaped the violence of antisemitism, we are all connected and\nafflicted by the millions of Jews and other marginalized groups\nthat perished during the Holocaust.\nHolocaust and genocide education goes far beyond learning\nthe historical significance of affection. Holocaust and genocide\neducation leads to an intersectional understanding of ethics and the\nramifications of prejudice, racism, and stereotyping. It can be used\nas a platform to encourage tolerance of diversity in a pluralistic\nsociety and for nurturing and protecting democratic values and\ninstitutions. The lessons derived from the Holocaust and other past\ngenocides are worth studying and understanding to reflect on and\nconnect to our present critically. Knowledge is our call to action.\nKnowledge is the most powerful tool to build a world where\neveryone can feel free and comfortable to exist, be free, safe, and\ncomfortable to live.\nA long-held tradition among Jews is the hectic banter,\nfurious debate, and questioning of everything. Teachers function as\nquestion provokers, truth-seekers, and advocates of justice. They\ncan recognize how justice in one community is a threat to justice in 648\nevery community. We have a civic responsibility to educate\nourselves and our children about the Holocaust and the many other\nhorrible genocides that have taken place throughout our history.\nWe must acknowledge them, examine them, and discuss them.\nHistory is doomed to be repeated if new generations are not\nencouraged to learn it.\nThe concept of Yizkor and remembrance is so deeply\nembedded in the Jewish culture that it manifests in many ways.\nWhen Yizkor is said, all of a synagogue\u2019s Yahrzeit lights are lit. I\nremember skipping down the long hallway of my temple many\ntimes, all of the Yahrzeit lights glimmering on the walls around me\nlike fireflies. The lights symbolize the souls of my ancestors,\nreminding me that even when we are gone, the generations to\nfollow will never forget. Similarly, this is why Holocaust and\ngenocide education matters. Education will serve as a reminder and\na lesson of the universal consequences of naked prejudice and\nunchecked hate. If education and remembrance are abandoned,\nhistory is sure to repeat itself. We must forgive but never forget. 649\nAbout the Author and Editor\nWendy Adele-Marie is a Distinguished Professor of History and\nCoordinator of Jewish Studies at Oakton College.

My mom fled\nfrom the city just one week before Germans occupied it. But my\ngrandma, aunt and a cousin could not flee and were killed in\nDrobitsy Yar (ravine) which is on outskirts of the city of Kharkov\n(now Ukraine). It was mass grave for about 16000 Jews. After\nvictory over Germany we came to Kharkov, but big part of family\nperished on the fronts of the war, including my father. Life in the\nSoviet Union was hard and humiliating for me as a Jew. So, when\nGorbachev opened \"gates\" for Jews to leave, I did it. I came to the\nUnited States in 1989. In 2009, Yakov Zakon and me created task\nforce \u201cEvidence of Holocaust,\u201d which in 2010 became an\nAssociation. Together with the newspaper Reklama we issued\nthree bilingual (English/Russian) albums, or books, including In\nMemoriam of the Victims of the Holocaust. These albums tell\nstories about not well known in the west, which was the Holocaust\non the territories of the former Soviet Union. When Yakov learned\nabout book by Professor Adele-Marie and contacted her, we\nbecame friends. Since then, Professor Adele-Marie invited us to\nconduct lessons in her class and to the Oakton community about\nthe Holocaust in the former Soviet Union. 658\nLeon Stein, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus of History at Roosevelt\nUniversity, is a pioneer in Holocaust education.

His teaching and research fields\nincluded the history of the Holocaust, history of ideas, social\nmovements, and nationalism. Stein believes it is important for\nstudents to understand that what happened to Jews in the Holocaust\ncould happen to any group. \u201cThe Holocaust reminds us how\nimportant our human rights are and the terrible consequences of\nprejudice,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople tend to forget that it happened only 70\nyears ago.\u201d Stein played a major role in making Illinois the first\nstate in the nation to require all students in public elementary and\nsecondary schools to be taught about the Holocaust; he created a\nstate-wide curriculum for public schools and since enactment of\nthe law on Jan. 1, 1990, has conducted scores of teacher training\ninstitutes that have provided more than 1,500 Illinois teachers with\ninformation about Holocaust education.
