Access for free at openstax.org Preface 1\nPreface\nWelcome toAstronomy 2e, an OpenStax resource. This textbook was written to increase student access to\nhigh-quality learning materials, maintaining highest standards of academic rigor at little to no cost.\nAbout OpenStax\nOpenStax is a nonprofit based at Rice University, and it\u2019s our mission to improve student access to education.\nOur first openly licensed college textbook was published in 2012 and our library has since scaled to over 50\nbooks for college and AP\u00aecourses used by hundreds of thousands of students. OpenStax Tutor, our low-cost\npersonalized learning tool, is being used in college courses throughout the country. Through our partnerships\nwith philanthropic foundations and our alliance with other educational resource organizations, OpenStax is\nbreaking down the most common barriers to learning and empowering students and instructors to succeed.\nAbout OpenStax resources\nCustomization\nAstronomy 2eis licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license, which means\nthat you can distribute, remix, and build upon the content, as long as you provide attribution to OpenStax and\nits content contributors.\nBecause our books are openly licensed, you are free to use the entire book or pick and choose the sections\nthat are most relevant to the needs of your course. Feel free to remix the content by assigning your students\ncertain chapters and sections in your syllabus, in the order that you prefer. You can even provide a direct link\nin your syllabus to the sections in the web view of your book.\nInstructors also have the option of creating a customized version of their OpenStax book. The custom version\ncan be made available to students in low-cost print or digital form through their campus bookstore. Visit your\nbook page on OpenStax.org for more information.\nErrata\nAll OpenStax textbooks undergo a rigorous review process. However, like any professional-grade textbook,\nerrors sometimes occur. Since our books are web based, we can make updates periodically when deemed\npedagogically necessary. If you have a correction to suggest, submit it through the link on your book page on\nOpenStax.org. Subject-matter experts review all errata suggestions. OpenStax is committed to remaining\ntransparent about all updates, so you will also find a list of past errata changes on your book page on\nOpenStax.org.\nFormat\nYou can access this textbook for free in web view or PDF through OpenStax.org, and for a low cost in print.\nAboutAstronomy 2e\nAstronomy 2eis written in clear non-technical language, with the occasional touch of humor and a wide range\nof clarifying illustrations. It has many analogies drawn from everyday life to help non-science majors\nappreciate, on their own terms, what our modern exploration of the universe is revealing. The book can be\nused for either a one-semester or two-semester introductory course (bear in mind, you can customize your\nversion and include only those chapters or sections you will be teaching.) It is made available free of charge in\nelectronic form (and low cost in printed form) to students around the world.\nCoverage and scope\nAstronomy 2ewas written by its three senior authors (see below) and was updated, reviewed, and vetted by a\nwide range of astronomers and astronomy educators in a strong community effort. It is designed to meet\nscope and sequence requirements of introductory astronomy courses nationwide. 2 Preface\nChapter 1: Science and the Universe: A Brief Tour\nChapter 2: Observing the Sky: The Birth of Astronomy\nChapter 3: Orbits and Gravity\nChapter 4: Earth, Moon, and Sky\nChapter 5: Radiation and Spectra\nChapter 6: Astronomical Instruments\nChapter 7: Other Worlds: An Introduction to the Solar System\nChapter 8: Earth as a Planet\nChapter 9: Cratered Worlds\nChapter 10: Earthlike Planets: Venus and Mars\nChapter 11: The Giant Planets\nChapter 12: Rings, Moons, and Pluto\nChapter 13: Comets and Asteroids: Debris of the Solar System\nChapter 14: Cosmic Samples and the Origin of the Solar System\nChapter 15: The Sun: A Garden-Variety Star\nChapter 16: The Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse\nChapter 17: Analyzing Starlight\nChapter 18: The Stars: A Celestial Census\nChapter 19: Celestial Distances\nChapter 20: Between the Stars: Gas and Dust in Space\nChapter 21: The Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar System\nChapter 22: Stars from Adolescence to Old Age\nChapter 23: The Death of Stars\nChapter 24: Black Holes and Curved Spacetime\nChapter 25: The Milky Way Galaxy\nChapter 26: Galaxies\nChapter 27: Active Galaxies, Quasars, and Supermassive Black Holes\nChapter 28: The Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies\nChapter 29: The Big Bang\nChapter 30: Life in the Universe\nAppendix A: How to Study for Your Introductory Astronomy Course\nAppendix B: Astronomy Websites, Pictures, and Apps\nAppendix C: Scientific Notation\nAppendix D: Units Used in Science\nAppendix E: Some Useful Constants for Astronomy\nAppendix F: Physical and Orbital Data for the Planets\nAppendix G: Selected Moons of the Planets\nAppendix H: Upcoming Total Eclipses\nAppendix I: The Nearest Stars, Brown Dwarfs, and White Dwarfs\nAppendix J: The Brightest Twenty Stars\nAppendix K: The Chemical Elements\nAppendix L: The Constellations\nAppendix M: Star Charts and Sky Event Resources\nCurrency and accuracy\nAstronomy 2ehas information and images from the LIGO and VIRGO gravitational-wave detectors, the\nPerseverance/Ingenuity mission to Mars, the Juno mission to Jupiter, and many other recent projects in\nastronomy. The discussion of exoplanets has been updated with recent information\u2014indicating not just\nindividual examples, but trends in what sorts of planets seem to be most common. Black holes receive their\nown chapter, and the role of supermassive black holes in active galaxies and galaxy evolution is clearly\nAccess for free at openstax.org Preface 3\nexplained. Chapters have been reviewed by subject-matter experts for accuracy and currency.\nFlexibility\nBecause there are many different ways to teach introductory astronomy, we have made the text as flexible as\nwe could. Math examples are shown in separate sections throughout, so that you can leave out the math or\nrequire it as you deem best. Each section of a chapter treats a different aspect of the topic being covered; a\nnumber of sections could be omitted in shorter overview courses and can be included where you need more\ndepth. And, as we have already discussed, you can customize the book in a variety of ways that have never\nbeen possible in traditional textbooks.\nStudent-centered focus\nThis book is written to help students understand the big picture rather than get lost in random factoids to\nmemorize. The language is accessible and inviting. Helpful diagrams and summary tables review and\nencapsulate the ideas being covered. Each chapter contains interactive group activities you can assign to help\nstudents work in teams and pool their knowledge.\nInteractive online resources\nInteresting \u201cLinks to Learning\u201d are scattered throughout the chapters, which direct students to online\nanimations, short videos, or enrichment readings to enhance their learning. Also, the resources listed at the\nend of each chapter include links to websites and other useful educational videos.\nFeature boxes that help students think outside the box\nA variety of feature boxes within the chapters connect astronomy to the students\u2019 other subjects and\nhumanize the face of astronomy by highlighting the lives of the men and women who have been key to its\nprogress. Besides the math examples that we\u2019ve already mentioned, the boxes include:\nMaking Connections.This feature connects the chapter topic to students\u2019 experiences with other fields,\nfrom poetry to engineering, popular culture, and natural disasters.\nVoyagers in Astronomy.This feature presents brief and engaging biographies of the people behind\nhistorically significant discoveries, as well as emerging research.\nAstronomy Basics.This feature explains basic science concepts that we often (incorrectly) assume\nstudents know from earlier classes.\nSeeing for Yourself.This feature provides practical ways that students can make astronomical\nobservations on their own.\nEnd-of-chapter materials to extend students\u2019 learning\nChapter Summaries.Summaries give the gist of each section for easy review.\nFor Further Exploration.This section offers a list of suggested articles, websites, and videos so students\ncan delve into topics of interest, whether for their own learning, for homework, extra credit, or papers.\nReview Questions.Review questions allow students to show you (or themselves) how well they\nunderstood the chapter.\nThought Questions.Thought questions help students assess their learning by asking for critical reflection\non principles or ideas in the chapter.\nFiguring For Yourself.Mathematical questions, using only basic algebra and arithmetic, allow students to\napply the math principles given in the example boxes throughout the chapter.\nCollaborative Group Activities.This section suggests ideas for group discussion, research, or reports.\nBeautiful art program\nOur comprehensive art program is designed to enhance students\u2019 understanding of concepts through clear\nand effective illustrations, diagrams, and photographs. Here are a few examples. 4 Preface\nFigure1How a Pulsar Beam Sweeps over Earth.\nFigure2Structure of the Milky Way Galaxy.\nAccess for free at openstax.org Preface 5\nFigure3Masses in the Stellar Graveyard.\nFigure4Pluto Close Up. 6 Preface\nAdditional resources\nStudent and instructor resources\nWe\u2019ve compiled additional resources for both students and instructors, including Getting Started Guides,\nPowerPoint slides, and an instructor answer guide. Instructor resources require a verified instructor account,\nwhich you can apply for when you log in or create your account on OpenStax.org.

Beyond Earth are vast and magnificent realms full of objects that have no counterpart on our home\nplanet. Nevertheless, we hope to show you that the evolution of the universe has been directly responsible for\nyour presence on Earth today.\nAlong your journey, you will encounter:\n\u2022 a canyon system so large that, on Earth, it would stretch from Los Angeles to Washington, DC (Figure 1.2). 10 1 \u2022 Science and the Universe: A Brief Tour\nFigure1.2Mars Mosaic.This image ofMarsis centered on theValles Marineris(Mariner Valley) complex of canyons, which is as\nlong as the United States is wide. (credit: modification of work by NASA)\n\u2022 a crater and other evidence on Earth that tell us that the dinosaurs (and many other creatures) died\nbecause of a cosmic collision.\n\u2022 a tiny moon whose gravity is so weak that one good throw from its surface could put a baseball into orbit.\n\u2022 a collapsed star so dense that to duplicate its interior we would have to squeeze every human being on\nEarth into a single raindrop.\n\u2022 exploding stars whose violent end could wipe clean all of the life-forms on a planet orbiting a neighboring\nstar (Figure 1.3).\n\u2022 a \u201ccannibal galaxy\u201d that has already consumed a number of its smaller galaxy neighbors and is not yet\nfinished finding new victims.\n\u2022 a radio echo that is the faint but unmistakable signal of the creation event for our universe.\nFigure1.3Stellar Corpse.We observe the remains of a star that was seen to explode in our skies in 1054 (and was, briefly, bright\nenough to be visible during the daytime). Today, the remnant is called theCrab Nebulaand its central region is seen here. Such\nexploding stars are crucial to the development of life in the universe. (credit: NASA, ESA, J. Hester (Arizona State University))\nSuch discoveries are what make astronomy such an exciting field for scientists and many others\u2014but you will\nAccess for free at openstax.org 1.1 \u2022 The Nature of Astronomy 11\nexplore much more than just the objects in our universe and the latest discoveries about them. We will pay\nequal attention to theprocessby which we have come to understand the realms beyond Earth and the tools\nwe use to increase that understanding.\nWe gather information about the cosmos from the messages the universe sends our way. Because the stars\nare the fundamental building blocks of the universe, decoding the message of starlight has been a central\nchallenge and triumph of modern astronomy. By the time you have finished reading this text, you will know a\nbit about how to read that message and how to understand what it is telling us.\n1.1 The Nature of Astronomy\nAstronomyis defined as the study of the objects that lie beyond our planet Earth and the processes by which\nthese objects interact with one another. We will see, though, that it is much more. It is also humanity\u2019s attempt\nto organize what we learn into a clear history of the universe, from the instant of its birth in the Big Bang to\nthe present moment. Throughout this book, we emphasize that science is aprogress report\u2014one that\nchanges constantly as new techniques and instruments allow us to probe the universe more deeply.\nIn considering the history of the universe, we will see again and again that the cosmosevolves; it changes in\nprofound ways over long periods of time. For example, the universe made the carbon, the calcium, and the\noxygen necessary to construct something as interesting and complicated as you. Today, many billions of years\nlater, the universe has evolved into a more hospitable place for life. Tracing the evolutionary processes that\ncontinue to shape the universe is one of the most important (and satisfying) parts of modernastronomy.\n1.2 The Nature of Science\nThe ultimate judge inscienceis always what nature itself reveals based on observations, experiments, models,\nand testing. Science is not merely a body of knowledge, but amethodby which we attempt to understand\nnature and how it behaves. This method begins with many observations over a period of time. From the trends\nfound through observations, scientists canmodelthe particular phenomena we want to understand. Such\nmodels are always approximations of nature, subject to further testing.\nAs a concrete astronomical example, ancient astronomers constructed a model (partly from observations and\npartly from philosophical beliefs) that Earth was the center of the universe and everything moved around it in\ncircular orbits. At first, our available observations of the Sun, Moon, and planets did fit this model; however,\nafter further observations, the model had to be updated by adding circle after circle to represent the\nmovements of the planets around Earth at the center. As the centuries passed and improved instruments were\ndeveloped for keeping track of objects in the sky, the old model (even with a huge number of circles) could no\nlonger explain all the observed facts. As we will see in the chapter onObserving the Sky: The Birth of\nAstronomy, a new model, with the Sun at the center, fit the experimental evidence better. After a period of\nphilosophical struggle, it became accepted as our view of the universe.\nWhen they are first proposed, new models or ideas are sometimes calledhypotheses. You may think there can\nbe no new hypotheses in a science such as astronomy\u2014that everything important has already been learned.\nNothing could be further from the truth. Throughout this textbook you will find discussions of recent, and\noccasionally still controversial, hypotheses in astronomy. For example, the significance that the huge chunks of\nrock and ice that hit Earth have for life on Earth itself is still debated. And while the evidence is strong that vast\nquantities of invisible \u201cdark energy\u201d make up the bulk of the universe, scientists have no convincing\nexplanation for what the dark energy actually is. Resolving these issues will require difficult observations done\nat the forefront of our technology, and all such hypotheses need further testing before we incorporate them\nfully into our standard astronomical models.\nThis last point is crucial: a hypothesis must be a proposed explanation that can betested. The most\nstraightforward approach to such testing in science is to perform an experiment. If the experiment is 12 1 \u2022 Science and the Universe: A Brief Tour\nconducted properly, its results either will agree with the predictions of the hypothesis or they will contradict it.\nIf the experimental result is truly inconsistent with the hypothesis, a scientist must discard the hypothesis and\ntry to develop an alternative. If the experimental result agrees with predictions, this does not necessarily prove\nthat the hypothesis is absolutely correct; perhaps later experiments will contradict crucial parts of the\nhypothesis. But, the more experiments that agree with the hypothesis, the more likely we are to accept the\nhypothesis as a useful description of nature.\nOne way to think about this is to consider a scientist who was born and lives on an island where only black\nsheep live. Day after day the scientist encounters black sheep only, so he or she hypothesizes that all sheep\nare black. Although every observed sheep adds confidence to the hypothesis, the scientist only has to visit the\nmainland and observe one white sheep to prove the hypothesis wrong.\nWhen you read about experiments, you probably have a mental picture of a scientist in a laboratory\nconducting tests or taking careful measurements. This is certainly the case for a biologist or a chemist, but\nwhat can astronomers do when our laboratory is the universe? It\u2019s impossible to put a group of stars into a\ntest tube or to order another comet from a scientific supply company.\nAs a result, astronomy is sometimes called anobservationalscience; we often make our tests by observing\nmany samples of the kind of object we want to study and noting carefully how different samples vary. New\ninstruments and technology can let us look at astronomical objects from new perspectives and in greater\ndetail. Our hypotheses are then judged in the light of this new information, and they pass or fail in the same\nway we would evaluate the result of a laboratory experiment.\nMuch of astronomy is also ahistoricalscience\u2014meaning that what we observe has already happened in the\nuniverse and we can do nothing to change it. In the same way, a geologist cannot alter what has happened to\nour planet, and a paleontologist cannot bring an ancient animal back to life. While this can make astronomy\nchallenging, it also gives us fascinating opportunities to discover the secrets of our cosmic past.\nYou might compare an astronomer to a detective trying to solve a crime that occurred before the detective\narrived at the scene. There is lots of evidence, but both the detective and the scientist must sift through and\norganize the evidence to test various hypotheses about what actually happened. And there is another way in\nwhich the scientist is like a detective: they both must prove their case. The detective must convince the district\nattorney, the judge, and perhaps ultimately the jury that his hypothesis is correct. Similarly, the scientist must\nconvince colleagues, editors of journals, and ultimately a broad cross-section of other scientists that her\nhypothesis is provisionally correct. In both cases, one can only ask for evidence \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\nAnd sometimes new evidence will force both the detective and the scientist to revise their last hypothesis.\nThis self-correcting aspect of science sets it off from most human activities. Scientists spend a great deal of\ntime questioning and challenging one another, which is why applications for project funding\u2014as well as\nreports for publication in academic journals\u2014go through an extensive process ofpeer review, which is a\ncareful examination by other scientists in the same field. In science (after formal education and training),\neveryone is encouraged to improve upon experiments and to challenge any and all hypotheses. New scientists\nknow that one of the best ways to advance their careers is to find a weakness in our current understanding of\nsomething and to correct it with a new or modified hypothesis.\nThis is one of the reasons science has made such dramatic progress. An undergraduate science major today\nknows more about science and math than did Sir Isaac Newton, one of the most renowned scientists who ever\nlived. Even in this introductory astronomy course, you will learn about objects and processes that no one a few\ngenerations ago even dreamed existed.\n1.3 The Laws of Nature\nOver centuries scientists have extracted variousscientific lawsfrom countless observations, hypotheses, and\nexperiments. These scientific laws are, in a sense, the \u201crules\u201d of the game that nature plays. One remarkable\nAccess for free at openstax.org 1.4 \u2022 Numbers in Astronomy 13\ndiscovery about nature\u2014one that underlies everything you will read about in this text\u2014is that the same laws\napply everywhere in the universe. The rules that determine the motion of stars so far away that your eye\ncannot see them are the same laws that determine the arc of a baseball after a batter has hit it out of the park.\nNote that without the existence of such universal laws, we could not make much headway in astronomy. If\neach pocket of the universe had different rules, we would have little chance of interpreting what happened in\nother \u201cneighborhoods.\u201d But, the consistency of the laws of nature gives us enormous power to understand\ndistant objects without traveling to them and learning the local laws. In the same way, if every region of a\ncountry had completely different laws, it would be very difficult to carry out commerce or even to understand\nthe behavior of people in those different regions. A consistent set of laws, though, allows us to apply what we\nlearn or practice in one state to any other state.\nThis is not to say that our current scientific models and laws cannot change. New experiments and\nobservations can lead to new, more sophisticated models\u2014models that can include new phenomena and laws\nabout their behavior. The general theory of relativity proposed by Albert Einstein is a perfect example of such a\ntransformation that took place about a century ago; it led us to predict, and eventually to observe, a strange\nnew class of objects that astronomers callblack holes. Only the patient process of observing nature ever more\ncarefully and precisely can demonstrate the validity of such new scientific models.\nOne important problem in describing scientific models has to do with the limitations of language. When we try\nto describe complex phenomena in everyday terms, the words themselves may not be adequate to do the job.\nFor example, you may have heard the structure of the atom likened to a miniature solar system. While some\naspects of our modern model of the atom do remind us of planetary orbits, many other of its aspects are\nfundamentally different.\nThis problem is the reason scientists often prefer to describe their models using equations rather than words.\nIn this book, which is designed to introduce the field of astronomy, we use mainly words to discuss what\nscientists have learned. We avoid complex math, but if this course piques your interest and you go on in\nscience, more and more of your studies will involve the precise language of mathematics.\n1.4 Numbers in Astronomy\nIn astronomy we deal with distances on a scale you may never have thought about before, with numbers\nlarger than any you may have encountered. We adopt two approaches that make dealing with astronomical\nnumbers a little bit easier. First, we use a system for writing large and small numbers calledscientific notation\n(or sometimespowers-of-ten notation). This system is very appealing because it eliminates the many zeros\nthat can seem overwhelming to the reader. In scientific notation, if you want to write a number such as\n500,000,000, you express it as . The small raised number after the 10, called anexponent, keeps track of\nthe number of places we had to move the decimal point to the left to convert 500,000,000 to 5. If you are\nencountering this system for the first time or would like a refresher, we suggest you look atAppendix Cand\nExample 1.1for more information. The second way we try to keep numbers simple is to use a consistent set of\nunits\u2014the metric International System of Units, or SI (from the FrenchSyst\u00e8me International d\u2019Unit\u00e9s). The\nmetric system is summarized inAppendix D(seeExample 1.2).\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch thisbrief PBS animation(https://openstax.org/l/30scinotation)that explains how scientific notation\nworks and why it\u2019s useful.\nA common unit astronomers use to describe distances in the universe is a light-year, which is the distance light 14 1 \u2022 Science and the Universe: A Brief Tour\ntravels during one year. Because light always travels at the same speed, and because its speed turns out to be\nthe fastest possible speed in the universe, it makes a good standard for keeping track of distances. You might\nbe confused because a \u201clight-year\u201d seems to imply that we are measuring time, but this mix-up of time and\ndistance is common in everyday life as well. For example, when your friend asks where the movie theater is\nlocated, you might say \u201cabout 20 minutes from downtown.\u201d\nSo, how many kilometers are there in a light-year? Light travels at the amazing pace of kilometers per\nsecond (km/s), which makes a light-year kilometers. You might think that such a large unit would\nreach the nearest star easily, but the stars are far more remote than our imaginations might lead us to believe.\nEven the nearest star is 4.3 light-years away\u2014more than 40 trillion kilometers. Other stars visible to the\nunaided eye are hundreds to thousands of light-years away (Figure 1.4).\nFigure1.4Orion Nebula.This beautiful cloud of cosmic raw material (gas and dust from which new stars and planets are being\nmade) called theOrion Nebulais about 1400 light-years away. That\u2019s a distance of roughly kilometers\u2014a pretty big\nnumber. The gas and dust in this region are illuminated by the intense light from a few extremely energetic adolescent stars.

Robberto (Space Telescope Science Institute/ESA) and the Hubble Space Telescope Orion Treasury Project Team)\nEXAMPLE 1.1\nScientific Notation\nIn 2015, the richest human being on our planet had a net worth of $79.2 billion. Some might say this is an\nastronomical sum of money. Express this amount in scientific notation.\nSolution\n$79.2 billion can be written $79,200,000,000. Expressed in scientific notation it becomes\nEXAMPLE 1.2\nGetting Familiar with a Light-Year\nHow many kilometers are there in a light-year?\nAccess for free at openstax.org 1.5 \u2022 Consequences of Light Travel Time 15\nSolution\nLight travels km in 1 s. So, let\u2019s calculate how far it goes in a year:\n\u2022 There are 60 ( ) s in 1 min, and min in 1 h.\n\u2022 Multiply these together and you find that there are s/h.\n\u2022 Thus, light covers\n\u2022 There are 24 or h in a day, and 365.25 ( ) days in 1 y.\n\u2022 The product of these two numbers is h/y.\n\u2022 Multiplying this by km/h gives km/light-year.\nThat\u2019s almost 10,000,000,000,000 km that light covers in a year. To help you imagine how long this distance\nis, we\u2019ll mention that a string 1 light-year long could fit around the circumference of Earth 236 million times.\n1.5 Consequences of Light Travel Time\nThere is another reason the speed of light is such a natural unit of distance for astronomers. Information\nabout the universe comes to us almost exclusively through various forms of light, and all such light travels at\nthe speed of light\u2014that is, 1 light-year every year. This sets a limit on how quickly we can learn about events in\nthe universe. If a star is 100 light-years away, the light we see from it tonight left that star 100 years ago and is\njust now arriving in our neighborhood. The soonest we can learn about any changes in that star is 100 years\nafter the fact. For a star 500 light-years away, the light we detect tonight left 500 years ago and is carrying\n500-year-old news.\nBecause many of us are accustomed to instant news from the Internet, some might find this frustrating.\n\u201cYou mean, when I see that star up there,\u201d you ask, \u201cI won\u2019t know what\u2019s actually happening there for another\n500 years?\u201d\nBut this isn\u2019t the most helpful way to think about the situation. For astronomers,nowis when the light reaches\nus here on Earth. There is no way for us to know anything about that star (or other object) until its light\nreaches us.\nBut what at first may seem a great frustration is actually a tremendous benefit in disguise. If astronomers\nreally want to piece together what has happened in the universe since its beginning, they must find evidence\nabout each epoch (or period of time) of the past. Where can we find evidence today about cosmic events that\noccurred billions of years ago?\nThe delay in the arrival of light provides an answer to this question. The farther out in space we look, the\nlonger the light has taken to get here, and the longer ago it left its place of origin. By looking billions of light-\nyears out into space, astronomers are actually seeing billions of years into the past. In this way, we can\nreconstruct the history of the cosmos and get a sense of how it has evolved over time.\nThis is one reason why astronomers strive to build telescopes that can collect more and more of the faint light\nin the universe. The more light we collect, the fainter the objects we can observe. On average, fainter objects\nare farther away and can, therefore, tell us about periods of time even deeper in the past. Instruments such as\nthe Hubble Space Telescope (Figure 1.5) and the Very Large Telescope in Chile (which you will learn about in\nthe chapter onAstronomical Instruments), are giving astronomers views of deep space and deep time better\nthan any we have had before. 16 1 \u2022 Science and the Universe: A Brief Tour\nFigure1.5Telescope in Orbit.The Hubble Space Telescope, shown here in orbit around Earth, is one of many astronomical\ninstruments in space. (credit: modification of work by European Space Agency)\n1.6 A Tour of the Universe\nWe can now take a brief introductory tour of the universe as astronomers understand it today to get\nacquainted with the types of objects and distances you will encounter throughout the text. We begin at home\nwith Earth, a nearly spherical planet about 13,000 kilometers in diameter (Figure 1.6). A space traveler entering\nour planetary system would easily distinguish Earth from the other planets in our solar system by the large\namount of liquid water that covers some two thirds of its crust. If the traveler had equipment to receive radio\nor television signals, or came close enough to see the lights of our cities at night, she would soon find signs\nthat this watery planet has sentient life.\nFigure1.6Humanity\u2019s Home Base.This image shows the Western hemisphere as viewed from space 35,400 kilometers (about\n22,000 miles) above Earth. Data about the land surface from one satellite was combined with another satellite\u2019s data about the\nclouds to create the image. (credit: modification of work by R. Stockli, A. Nelson, F. Hasler, NASA/ GSFC/ NOAA/ USGS)\nOur nearest astronomical neighbor is Earth\u2019s satellite, commonly called theMoon.Figure 1.7shows Earth and\nthe Moon drawn to scale on the same diagram. Notice how small we have to make these bodies to fit them on\nAccess for free at openstax.org 1.6 \u2022 A Tour of the Universe 17\nthe page with the right scale. The Moon\u2019s distance from Earth is about 30 times Earth\u2019s diameter, or\napproximately 384,000 kilometers, and it takes about a month for the Moon to revolve around Earth. The\nMoon\u2019s diameter is 3476 kilometers, about one fourth the size of Earth.\nFigure1.7Earth and Moon, Drawn to Scale.This image showsEarthand theMoonshown to scale for both size and distance.\n(credit: modification of work by NASA)\nLight (or radio waves) takes 1.3 seconds to travel between Earth and the Moon. If you\u2019ve seen videos of the\nApollo flights to the Moon, you may recall that there was a delay of about 3 seconds between the time Mission\nControl asked a question and the time the astronauts responded. This was not because the astronauts were\nthinking slowly, but rather because it took the radio waves almost 3 seconds to make the round trip.\nEarth revolves around our star, the Sun, which is about 150 million kilometers away\u2014approximately 400 times\nas far away from us as the Moon. We call the average Earth\u2013Sun distance anastronomical unit(AU) because,\nin the early days of astronomy, it was the most important measuring standard. Light takes slightly more than 8\nminutes to travel 1 astronomical unit, which means the latest news we receive from the Sun is always 8\nminutes old. The diameter of the Sun is about 1.5 million kilometers; Earth could fit comfortably inside one of\nthe minor eruptions that occurs on the surface of our star. If the Sun were reduced to the size of a basketball,\nEarth would be a small apple seed about 30 meters from the ball.\nIt takes Earth 1 year (3 \u00d7 107seconds) to go around the Sun at our distance; to make it around, we must travel\nat approximately 110,000 kilometers per hour. (If you, like many students, still prefer miles to kilometers, you\nmight find the following trick helpful. To convert kilometers to miles, just multiply kilometers by 0.6. Thus,\n110,000 kilometers per hour becomes 66,000 miles per hour.) Because gravity holds us firmly to Earth and\nthere is no resistance to Earth\u2019s motion in the vacuum of space, we participate in this extremely fast-moving\ntrip without being aware of it day to day.\nEarth is only one of eight planets that revolve around the Sun. These planets, along with their moons and\nswarms of smaller bodies such as dwarf planets, make up the solar system (Figure 1.8). A planet is defined as a\nbody of significant size that orbits a star and does not produce its own light. (If a large body consistently\nproduces its own light, it is then called astar.) Later in the book this definition will be modified a bit, but it is\nperfectly fine for now as you begin your voyage. 18 1 \u2022 Science and the Universe: A Brief Tour\nFigure1.8Our Solar Family.The Sun, the planets, and some dwarf planets are shown with their sizes drawn to scale. The orbits of\nthe planets are much more widely separated than shown in this drawing. Notice the size of Earth compared to the giant planets.\n(credit: modification of work by NASA)\nWe are able to see the nearby planets in our skies only because they reflect the light of our local star, the Sun.\nIf the planets were much farther away, the tiny amount of light they reflect would usually not be visible to us.\nThe planets we have so far discovered orbiting other stars were found from the pull their gravity exerts on\ntheir parent stars, or from the light they block from their stars when they pass in front of them. We can\u2019t see\nmost of these planets directly, although a few are now being imaged directly.\nTheSunis our local star, and all the other stars are also enormous balls of glowing gas that generate vast\namounts of energy by nuclear reactions deep within. We will discuss the processes that cause stars to shine in\nmore detail later in the book. The other stars look faint only because they are so very far away. If we continue\nour basketball analogy,Proxima Centauri, the nearest star beyond the Sun, which is 4.3 light-years away,\nwould be almost 7000 kilometers from the basketball.\nWhen you look up at a star-filled sky on a clear night, all the stars visible to the unaided eye are part of a single\ncollection of stars we call theMilky Way Galaxy, or simply theGalaxy. (When referring to the Milky Way, we\ncapitalizeGalaxy; when talking about other galaxies of stars, we use lowercasegalaxy.) The Sun is one of\nhundreds of billions of stars that make up the Galaxy; its extent, as we will see, staggers the human\nimagination. Within a sphere 10 light-years in radius centered on the Sun, we find roughly ten stars. Within a\nsphere 100 light-years in radius, there are roughly 10,000 (104) stars\u2014far too many to count or name\u2014but we\nhave still traversed only a tiny part of theMilky Way Galaxy. Within a 1000-light-year sphere, we find some ten\nmillion (107) stars; within a sphere of 100,000 light-years, we finally encompass the entire Milky Way Galaxy.\nOur Galaxy looks like a giant disk with a small ball in the middle. If we could move outside our Galaxy and look\ndown on the disk of the Milky Way from above, it would probably resemble the galaxy inFigure 1.9, with its\nspiral structure outlined by the blue light of hot adolescent stars.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 1.6 \u2022 A Tour of the Universe 19\nFigure1.9Spiral Galaxy.This galaxy of billions of stars, called by its catalog number NGC 1073, is thought to be similar to our own\nMilky Way Galaxy. Here we see the giant wheel-shaped system with a bar of stars across its middle. (credit: NASA, ESA)\nThe Sun is somewhat less than 30,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy, in a location with nothing\nmuch to distinguish it. From our position inside the Milky Way Galaxy, we cannot see through to its far rim (at\nleast not with ordinary light) because the space between the stars is not completely empty. It contains a\nsparse distribution of gas (mostly the simplest element, hydrogen) intermixed with tiny solid particles that we\ncallinterstellar dust. This gas and dust collect into enormous clouds in many places in the Galaxy, becoming\nthe raw material for future generations of stars.Figure 1.10shows an image of the disk of the Galaxy as seen\nfrom our vantage point. 20 1 \u2022 Science and the Universe: A Brief Tour\nFigure1.10Milky Way Galaxy.Because we are inside theMilky Way Galaxy, we see its disk in cross-section flung across the sky like\na great milky white avenue of stars with dark \u201crifts\u201d of dust. In this dramatic image, part of it is seen above Trona Pinnacles in the\nCalifornia desert. (credit: Ian Norman)\nTypically, the interstellar material is so extremely sparse that the space between stars is a much better vacuum\nthan anything we can produce in terrestrial laboratories. Yet, the dust in space, building up over thousands of\nlight-years, can block the light of more distant stars. Like the distant buildings that disappear from our view on\na smoggy day in Los Angeles, the more distant regions of the Milky Way cannot be seen behind the layers of\ninterstellar smog. Luckily, astronomers have found that stars and raw material shine with various forms of\nlight, some of which do penetrate the smog, and so we have been able to develop a pretty good map of the\nGalaxy.\nRecent observations, however, have also revealed a rather surprising and disturbing fact. There appears to be\nmore\u2014much more\u2014to the Galaxy than meets the eye (or the telescope). From various investigations, we have\nevidence that much of our Galaxy is made of material we cannot currently observe directly with our\ninstruments. We therefore call this component of the Galaxydark matter. We know the dark matter is there by\nthe pull its gravity exerts on the stars and raw material we can observe, but what this dark matter is made of\nand how much of it exists remain a mystery. Furthermore, this dark matter is not confined to our Galaxy; it\nappears to be an important part of other star groupings as well.\nBy the way, not all stars live by themselves, as the Sun does. Many are born in double or triple systems with\ntwo, three, or more stars revolving about each other. Because the stars influence each other in such close\nsystems, multiple stars allow us to measure characteristics that we cannot discern from observing single stars.\nIn a number of places, enough stars have formed together that we recognized them as star clusters (Figure\n1.11). Some of the largest of the star clusters that astronomers have cataloged contain hundreds of thousands\nof stars and take up volumes of space hundreds of light-years across.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 1.7 \u2022 The Universe on the Large Scale 21\nFigure1.11Star Cluster.This large star cluster is known by its catalog number, M9. It contains some 250,000 stars and is seen more\nclearly from space using the Hubble Space Telescope. It is located roughly 25,000 light-years away. (credit: NASA, ESA)\nYou may hear stars referred to as \u201ceternal,\u201d but in fact no star can last forever. Since the \u201cbusiness\u201d of stars is\nmaking energy, and energy production requires some sort of fuel to be used up, eventually all stars run out of\nfuel. This news should not cause you to panic, though, because our Sun still has at least 5 or 6 billion years to\ngo. Ultimately, the Sun and all stars will die, and it is in their death throes that some of the most intriguing and\nimportant processes of the universe are revealed. For example, we now know that many of the atoms in our\nbodies were once inside stars. These stars exploded at the ends of their lives, recycling their material back into\nthe reservoir of the Galaxy. In this sense, all of us are literally made of recycled \u201cstar dust.\u201d\n1.7 The Universe on the Large Scale\nIn a very rough sense, you could think of the solar system as your house or apartment and the Galaxy as your\ntown, made up of many houses and buildings. In the twentieth century, astronomers were able to show that,\njust as our world is made up of many, many towns, so the universe is made up of enormous numbers of\ngalaxies. (We define the universe to be everything that exists that is accessible to our observations.) Galaxies\nstretch as far into space as our telescopes can see, many billions of them within the reach of modern\ninstruments. When they were first discovered, some astronomers called galaxiesisland universes, and the\nterm is aptly descriptive; galaxies do look like islands of stars in the vast, dark seas of intergalactic space.\nThe nearest galaxy, discovered in 1993, is a small one that lies 70,000 light-years from the Sun in the direction\nof the constellation Sagittarius, where the smog in our own Galaxy makes it especially difficult to discern. (A\nconstellation, we should note, is one of the 88 sections into which astronomers divide the sky, each named\nafter a prominent star pattern within it.) Beyond this Sagittarius dwarf galaxy lie two other small galaxies,\nabout 160,000 light-years away. First recorded by Magellan\u2019s crew as he sailed around the world, these are\ncalled theMagellanic Clouds(Figure 1.12). All three of these small galaxies are satellites of the Milky Way\nGalaxy, interacting with it through the force of gravity. Ultimately, all three may even be swallowed by our\nmuch larger Galaxy, as other small galaxies have been over the course of cosmic time. 22 1 \u2022 Science and the Universe: A Brief Tour\nFigure1.12Neighbor Galaxies.This image shows both theLarge Magellanic Cloudand theSmall Magellanic Cloudabove the\ntelescopes of the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. (credit: ESO, C.\nMalin)\nThe nearest large galaxy is a spiral quite similar to our own, located in the constellation of Andromeda, and is\nthus called theAndromeda galaxy; it is also known by one of its catalog numbers, M31 (Figure 1.13). M31 is a\nlittle more than 2 million light-years away and, along with the Milky Way, is part of a small cluster of more than\n50 galaxies referred to as theLocal Group.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 1.7 \u2022 The Universe on the Large Scale 23\nFigure1.13Closest Spiral Galaxy.TheAndromeda galaxy(M31) is a spiral-shaped collection of stars similar to our own Milky Way.\n(credit: Adam Evans)\nAt distances of 10 to 15 million light-years, we find other small galaxy groups, and then at about 50 million\nlight-years there are more impressive systems with thousands of member galaxies. We have discovered that\ngalaxies occur mostly in clusters, both large and small (Figure 1.14). 24 1 \u2022 Science and the Universe: A Brief Tour\nFigure1.14Fornax Cluster of Galaxies.In this image, you can see part of a cluster of galaxies located about 60 million light-years\naway in the constellation of Fornax. All the objects that are not pinpoints of light in the picture are galaxies of billions of stars. (credit:\nESO, J. Emerson, VISTA. Acknowledgment: Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit)\nSome of the clusters themselves form into larger groups calledsuperclusters. TheLocal Groupis part of a\nsupercluster of galaxies, called theVirgo Supercluster, which stretches over a diameter of 110 million light-\nyears. We are just beginning to explore the structure of the universe at these enormous scales and are already\nencountering some unexpected findings.\nAt even greater distances, where many ordinary galaxies are too dim to see, we findquasars. These are\nbrilliant centers of galaxies, glowing with the light of an extraordinarily energetic process. The enormous\nenergy of the quasars is produced by gas that is heated to a temperature of millions of degrees as it falls\ntoward a massive black hole and swirls around it. The brilliance of quasars makes them the most distant\nbeacons we can see in the dark oceans of space. They allow us to probe the universe 10 billion light-years away\nor more, and thus 10 billion years or more in the past.\nWith quasars we can see way back close to the Big Bang explosion that marks the beginning of time. Beyond\nthe quasars and the most distant visible galaxies, we have detected the feeble glow of the explosion itself,\nfilling the universe and thus coming to us from all directions in space. The discovery of this \u201cafterglow of\ncreation\u201d is considered to be one of the most significant events in twentieth-century science, and we are still\nexploring the many things it has to tell us about the earliest times of the universe.\nMeasurements of the properties of galaxies and quasars in remote locations require large telescopes,\nsophisticated light-amplifying devices, and painstaking labor. Every clear night, at observatories around the\nworld, astronomers and students are at work on such mysteries as the birth of new stars and the large-scale\nstructure of the universe, fitting their results into the tapestry of our understanding.\n1.8 The Universe of the Very Small\nThe foregoing discussion has likely impressed on you that the universe is extraordinarily large and\nextraordinarily empty. On average, it is 10,000 times more empty than our Galaxy. Yet, as we have seen, even\nAccess for free at openstax.org 1.8 \u2022 The Universe of the Very Small 25\nthe Galaxy is mostly empty space. The air we breathe has about 1019atoms in each cubic centimeter\u2014and we\nusually think of air as empty space. In the interstellar gas of the Galaxy, there is about one atom in every cubic\ncentimeter. Intergalactic space is filled so sparsely that to find one atom, on average, we must search through\na cubic meter of space. Most of the universe is fantastically empty; places that are dense, such as the human\nbody, are tremendously rare.\nEven our most familiar solids are mostly space. If we could take apart such a solid, piece by piece, we would\neventually reach the tiny molecules from which it is formed. Molecules are the smallest particles into which\nany matter can be divided while still retaining its chemical properties. A molecule of water (H O), for example,\n2\nconsists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom bonded together.\nMolecules, in turn, are built of atoms, which are the smallest particles of an element that can still be identified\nas that element. For example, an atom of gold is the smallest possible piece of gold. Nearly 100 different kinds\nof atoms (elements) exist in nature. Most of them are rare, and only a handful account for more than 99% of\neverything with which we come in contact. The most abundant elements in the cosmos today are listed in\nTable 1.1; think of this table as the \u201cgreatest hits\u201d of the universe when it comes to elements. Note that the list\nincludes the four elements most common in life on Earth\u2014hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen.\nThe Cosmically Abundant Elements\n1\nElement Symbol Number of Atoms per\nMillion Hydrogen Atoms\nHydrogen H 1,000,000\nHelium He 80,000\nCarbon C 450\nNitrogen N 92\nOxygen O 740\nNeon Ne 130\nMagnesium Mg 40\nSilicon Si 37\nSulfur S 19\nIron Fe 32\nTable1.1\nAll atoms consist of a central, positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons. The bulk\nof the matter in each atom is found in the nucleus, which consists of positive protons and electrically neutral\nneutrons all bound tightly together in a very small space. Each element is defined by the number of protons in\nits atoms. Thus, any atom with 6 protons in its nucleus is calledcarbon, any with 50 protons is calledtin, and\n1 This list of elements is arranged in order of the atomic number, which is the number of protons in each nucleus. 26 1 \u2022 Science and the Universe: A Brief Tour\nany with 70 protons is calledytterbium. (For a list of the elements, seeAppendix K.)\nThe distance from an atomic nucleus to its electrons is typically 100,000 times the size of the nucleus itself. This\nis why we say that even solid matter is mostly space. The typical atom is far emptier than the solar system out\nto Neptune. (The distance from Earth to the Sun, for example, is only 100 times the size of the Sun.) This is one\nreason atoms are not like miniature solar systems.\nRemarkably, physicists have discovered that everything that happens in the universe, from the smallest atomic\nnucleus to the largest superclusters of galaxies, can be explained through the action of only four forces:\ngravity, electromagnetism (which combines the actions of electricity and magnetism), and two forces that act\nat the nuclear level. The fact that there are four forces (and not a million, or just one) has puzzled physicists\nand astronomers for many years and has led to a quest for a unified picture of nature.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTo construct an atom, particle by particle, check out thisguided animation(https://openstax.org/l/\n30buildanatom)for building an atom.\n1.9 A Conclusion and a Beginning\nIf you are new to astronomy, you have probably reached the end of our brief tour in this chapter with mixed\nemotions. On the one hand, you may be fascinated by some of the new ideas you\u2019ve read about and you may\nbe eager to learn more. On the other hand, you may be feeling a bit overwhelmed by the number of topics we\nhave covered, and the number of new words and ideas we have introduced. Learning astronomy is a little like\nlearning a new language: at first it seems there are so many new expressions that you\u2019ll never master them\nall, but with practice, you soon develop facility with them.\nAt this point you may also feel a bit small and insignificant, dwarfed by the cosmic scales of distance and time.\nBut, there is another way to look at what you have learned from our first glimpses of the cosmos. Let us\nconsider the history of the universe from the Big Bang to today and compress it, for easy reference, into a\nsingle year. (We have borrowed this idea from Carl Sagan\u2019s 1977 Pulitzer Prize-winning book,The Dragons of\nEden.)\nOn this scale, the Big Bang happened at the first moment of January 1, and this moment, when you are\nreading this chapter would be the end of the very last second of December 31. When did other events in the\ndevelopment of the universe happen in this \u201ccosmic year?\u201d Our solar system formed around September 10,\nand the oldest rocks we can date on Earth go back to the third week in September (Figure 1.15).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 1.9 \u2022 A Conclusion and a Beginning 27\nFigure1.15Charting Cosmic Time.On a cosmic calendar, where the time since the Big Bang is compressed into 1 year, creatures\nwe would call human do not emerge on the scene until the evening of December 31.

The answer turns out to be\nthe evening of December 31. The invention of the alphabet doesn\u2019t occur until the fiftieth second of 11:59 p.m.\non December 31. And the beginnings of modern astronomy are a mere fraction of a second before the New\nYear. Seen in a cosmic context, the amount of time we have had to study the stars is minute, and our success\nin piecing together as much of the story as we have is remarkable.\nCertainly our attempts to understand the universe are not complete. As new technologies and new ideas allow\nus to gather more and better data about the cosmos, our present picture of astronomy will very likely undergo\nmany changes. Still, as you read our current progress report on the exploration of the universe, take a few\nminutes every once in a while just to savor how much you have already learned. 28 1 \u2022 For Further Exploration\nFor Further Exploration\nBooks\nMiller, Ron, and William Hartmann.The Grand Tour: A Traveler\u2019s Guide to the Solar System. 3rd ed.

He believes that Earth is flat and\nall the NASA images of a spherical Earth are either faked or simply show the round (but flat) disk of Earth from\nabove. How could you prove to your new neighbor that Earth really is a sphere? (When you\u2019ve thought about\nthis on your own, you can check later in the chapter for some suggested answers.)\nToday, few people really spend much time looking at the night sky. In ancient days, before electric lights\nrobbed so many people of the beauty of the sky, the stars and planets were an important aspect of everyone\u2019s\ndaily life. All the records that we have\u2014on paper and in stone\u2014show that ancient civilizations around the\nworld noticed, worshipped, and tried to understand the lights in the sky and fit them into their own view of the\nworld. These ancient observers found both majestic regularity and never-ending surprise in the motions of the\nheavens. Through their careful study of the planets, the Greeks and later the Romans laid the foundation of\nthe science of astronomy. 30 2 \u2022 Observing the Sky: The Birth of Astronomy\n2.1 The Sky Above\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDefine the main features of the celestial sphere\nExplain the system astronomers use to describe the sky\nDescribe how motions of the stars appear to us on Earth\nDescribe how motions of the Sun, Moon, and planets appear to us on Earth\nUnderstand the modern meaning of the termconstellation\nOur senses suggest to us that Earth is the center of the universe\u2014the hub around which the heavens turn.\nThisgeocentric(Earth-centered) view was what almost everyone believed until the European Renaissance.\nAfter all, it is simple, logical, and seemingly self-evident. Furthermore, the geocentric perspective reinforced\nthose philosophical and religious systems that taught the unique role of human beings as the central focus of\nthe cosmos. However, the geocentric view happens to be wrong. One of the great themes of our intellectual\nhistory is the overthrow of the geocentric perspective. Let us, therefore, take a look at the steps by which we\nreevaluated the place of our world in the cosmic order.\nThe Celestial Sphere\nIf you go on a camping trip or live far from city lights, your view of the sky on a clear night is pretty much\nidentical to that seen by people all over the world before the invention of the telescope. Gazing up, you get the\nimpression that the sky is a great hollow dome with you at the center (Figure 2.2), and all the stars are an\nequal distance from you on the surface of the dome. The top of that dome, the point directly above your head,\nis called thezenith, and where the dome meets Earth is called thehorizon. From the sea or a flat prairie, it is\neasy to see the horizon as a circle around you, but from most places where people live today, the horizon is at\nleast partially hidden by mountains, trees, buildings, or smog.\nFigure2.2The Sky around Us.The horizon is where the sky meets the ground; an observer\u2019s zenith is the point directly overhead.\nIf you lie back in an open field and observe the night sky for hours, as ancient shepherds and travelers\nregularly did, you will see stars rising on the eastern horizon (just as the Sun and Moon do), moving across the\ndome of the sky in the course of the night, and setting on the western horizon. Watching the sky turn like this\nnight after night, you might eventually get the idea that the dome of the sky is really part of a great sphere\nthat is turning around you, bringing different stars into view as it turns. The early Greeks regarded the sky as\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.1 \u2022 The Sky Above 31\njust such acelestial sphere(Figure 2.3). Some thought of it as an actual sphere of transparent crystalline\nmaterial, with the stars embedded in it like tiny jewels.\nFigure2.3Circles on the Celestial Sphere.Here we show the (imaginary) celestial sphere around Earth, on which objects are fixed,\nand which rotates around Earth on an axis. In reality, it is Earth that turns around this axis, creating the illusion that the sky revolves\naround us. Note that Earth in this picture has been tilted so that your location is at the top and the North Pole is where the N is. The\napparent motion of celestial objects in the sky around the pole is shown by the circular arrow.\nToday, we know that it is not the celestial sphere that turns as night and day proceed, but rather the planet on\nwhich we live. We can put an imaginary stick through Earth\u2019s North and South Poles, representing our planet\u2019s\naxis. It is because Earth turns on this axis every 24 hours that we see the Sun, Moon, and stars rise and set with\nclockwork regularity. Today, we know that these celestial objects are not really on a dome, but at greatly\nvarying distances from us in space. Nevertheless, it is sometimes still convenient to talk about the celestial\ndome or sphere to help us keep track of objects in the sky. There is even a special theater, called a\nplanetarium, in which we project a simulation of the stars and planets onto a white dome.\nAs the celestial sphere rotates, the objects on it maintain their positions with respect to one another. A\ngrouping of stars such as the Big Dipper has the same shape during the course of the night, although it turns\nwith the sky. During a single night, even objects we know to have significant motions of their own, such as the\nnearby planets, seem fixed relative to the stars. Only meteors\u2014brief \u201cshooting stars\u201d that flash into view for\njust a few seconds\u2014move appreciably with respect to other objects on the celestial sphere. (This is because\nthey are not stars at all. Rather, they are small pieces of cosmic dust, burning up as they hit Earth\u2019s\natmosphere.) We can use the fact that the entire celestial sphere seems to turn together to help us set up\nsystems for keeping track of what things are visible in the sky and where they happen to be at a given time.\nCelestial Poles and Celestial Equator\nTo help orient us in the turning sky, astronomers use a system that extends Earth\u2019s axis points into the sky. 32 2 \u2022 Observing the Sky: The Birth of Astronomy\nImagine a line going through Earth, connecting the North and South Poles. This is Earth\u2019s axis, and Earth\nrotates about this line. If we extend this imaginary line outward from Earth, the points where this line\nintersects the celestial sphere are called thenorth celestial poleand thesouth celestial pole. As Earth rotates\nabout its axis, the sky appears to turn in the opposite direction around thosecelestial poles(Figure 2.4). We\nalso (in our imagination) throw Earth\u2019s equator onto the sky and call this thecelestial equator. It lies halfway\nbetween the celestial poles, just as Earth\u2019s equator lies halfway between our planet\u2019s poles.\nFigure2.4Circling the South Celestial Pole.This long-exposure photo shows trails left by stars as a result of the apparent rotation\nof the celestial sphere around the south celestial pole. (In reality, it is Earth that rotates.) (Credit: ESO/Iztok Bon\u010dina)\nNow let\u2019s imagine how riding on different parts of our spinning Earth affects our view of the sky. The apparent\nmotion of the celestial sphere depends on your latitude (position north or south of the equator). First of all,\nnotice that Earth\u2019s axis is pointing at the celestial poles, so these two points in the sky do not appear to turn.\nIf you stood at the North Pole of Earth, for example, you would see the north celestial pole overhead, at your\nzenith. The celestial equator, 90\u00b0 from the celestial poles, would lie along your horizon. As you watched the\nstars during the course of the night, they would all circle around the celestial pole, with none rising or setting.\nOnly that half of the sky north of the celestial equator is ever visible to an observer at the North Pole. Similarly,\nan observer at the South Pole would see only the southern half of the sky.\nIf you were at Earth\u2019s equator, on the other hand, you see the celestial equator (which, after all, is just an\n\u201cextension\u201d of Earth\u2019s equator) pass overhead through your zenith. The celestial poles, being 90\u00b0 from the\ncelestial equator, must then be at the north and south points on your horizon. As the sky turns, all stars rise\nand set; they move straight up from the east side of the horizon and set straight down on the west side.\nDuring a 24-hour period, all stars are above the horizon exactly half the time. (Of course, during some of those\nhours, the Sun is too bright for us to see them.)\nWhat would an observer in the latitudes of the United States or Europe see? Remember, we are neither at\nEarth\u2019s pole nor at the equator, but in between them. For those in the continental United States and Europe,\nthe north celestial pole is neither overhead nor on the horizon, but in between. It appears above the northern\nhorizon at an angular height, or altitude, equal to the observer\u2019s latitude. In San Francisco, for example, where\nthe latitude is 38\u00b0 N, the north celestial pole is 38\u00b0 above the northern horizon.\nFor an observer at 38\u00b0 N latitude, the south celestial pole is 38\u00b0 below the southern horizon and, thus, never\nvisible. As Earth turns, the whole sky seems to pivot about the north celestial pole. For this observer, stars\nwithin 38\u00b0 of the North Pole can never set. They are always above the horizon, day and night. This part of the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.1 \u2022 The Sky Above 33\nsky is called the northcircumpolar zone. For observers in the continental United States, the Big Dipper, Little\nDipper, and Cassiopeia are examples of star groups in the north circumpolar zone. On the other hand, stars\nwithin 38\u00b0 of the south celestial pole never rise. That part of the sky is the south circumpolar zone. To most\nU.S. observers, the Southern Cross is in that zone. (Don\u2019t worry if you are not familiar with the star groups just\nmentioned; we will introduce them more formally later on.)\nAt this particular time in Earth\u2019s history, there happens to be a star very close to the north celestial pole. It is\ncalledPolaris, the pole star, and has the distinction of being the star that moves the least amount as the\nnorthern sky turns each day. Because it moved so little while the other stars moved much more, it played a\nspecial role in the mythology of several Native American tribes, for example (some called it the \u201cfastener of the\nsky\u201d).\nASTRONOMY BASICS\nWhat\u2019s Your Angle?\nAstronomers measure how far apart objects appear in the sky by using angles. By definition, there are 360\u00b0\nin a circle, so a circle stretching completely around the celestial sphere contains 360\u00b0. The half-sphere or\ndome of the sky then contains 180\u00b0 from horizon to opposite horizon. Thus, if two stars are 18\u00b0 apart, their\nseparation spans about 1/10 of the dome of the sky. To give you a sense of how big a degree is, the full\nMoon is about half a degree across. This is about the width of your smallest finger (pinkie) seen at arm\u2019s\nlength.\nRising and Setting of the Sun\nWe described the movement of stars in the night sky, but what about during the daytime? The stars continue\nto circle during the day, but the brilliance of the Sun makes them difficult to see. (The Moon can often be seen\nin the daylight, however.) On any given day, we can think of the Sun as being located at some position on the\nhypothetical celestial sphere. When the Sun rises\u2014that is, when the rotation of Earth carries the Sun above the\nhorizon\u2014sunlight is scattered by the molecules of our atmosphere, filling our sky with light and hiding the\nstars above the horizon.\nFor thousands of years, astronomers have been aware that the Sun does more than just rise and set. It\nchanges position gradually on the celestial sphere, moving each day about 1\u00b0 to the east relative to the stars.\nVery reasonably, the ancients thought this meant the Sun was slowly moving around Earth, taking a period of\ntime we call 1yearto make a full circle. Today, of course, we know it is Earth that is going around the Sun, but\nthe effect is the same: the Sun\u2019s position in our sky changes day to day. We have a similar experience when we\nwalk around a campfire at night; we see the flames appear in front of each person seated about the fire in\nturn.\nThe path the Sun appears to take around the celestial sphere each year is called theecliptic(Figure 2.6).\nBecause of its motion on the ecliptic, the Sun rises about 4 minutes later each day with respect to the stars.\nEarth must make just a bit more than one complete rotation (with respect to the stars) to bring the Sun up\nagain. 34 2 \u2022 Observing the Sky: The Birth of Astronomy\nFigure2.5Star Circles at Different Latitudes.The turning of the sky looks different depending on your latitude on Earth. The red\ncircle in each case is your horizon. Your zenith is the point above your head. (a) At the North Pole, the stars circle the zenith and do\nnot rise and set. (b) At the equator, the celestial poles are on the horizon, and the stars rise straight up and set straight down. (c) At\nintermediate latitudes, the north celestial pole is at some position between overhead and the horizon. Its angle above the horizon\nturns out to be equal to the observer\u2019s latitude. Stars rise and set at an angle to the horizon.\nAs the months go by and we look at the Sun from different places in our orbit, we see it projected against\ndifferent places in our orbit, and thus against different stars in the background (Figure 2.6andTable 2.1)\u2014or\nwe would, at least, if we could see the stars in the daytime. In practice, we must deduce which stars lie behind\nand beyond the Sun by observing the stars visible in the opposite direction at night. After a year, when Earth\nhas completed one trip around the Sun, the Sun will appear to have completed one circuit of the sky along the\necliptic.\nFigure2.6Constellations on the Ecliptic.As Earth revolves around the Sun, we sit on \u201cplatform Earth\u201d and see the Sun moving\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.1 \u2022 The Sky Above 35\naround the sky. The circle in the sky that the Sun appears to make around us in the course of a year is called theecliptic. This circle\n(like all circles in the sky) goes through a set ofconstellations. The ancients thought these constellations, which the Sun (and the\nMoon and planets) visited, must be special and incorporated them into their system of astrology. Note that at any given time of the\nyear, some of the constellations crossed by the ecliptic are visible in the night sky; others are in the day sky and are thus hidden by\nthe brilliance of the Sun. (The term constellation will be defined more precisely in the next subsection.)\nConstellations on the Ecliptic\nConstellation on the Ecliptic Dates When the Sun Crosses It\nCapricornus January 21\u2013February 16\nAquarius February 16\u2013March 11\nPisces March 11\u2013April 18\nAries April 18\u2013May 13\nTaurus May 13\u2013June 22\nGemini June 22\u2013July 21\nCancer July 21\u2013August 10\nLeo August 10\u2013September 16\nVirgo September 16\u2013October 31\nLibra October 31\u2013November 23\nScorpius November 23\u2013November 29\nOphiuchus November 29\u2013December 18\nSagittarius December 18\u2013January 21\nTable2.1\nThe ecliptic does not lie along the celestial equator but is inclined to it at an angle of about 23.5\u00b0. In other\nwords, the Sun\u2019s annual path in the sky is not linked with Earth\u2019s equator. This is because our planet\u2019s axis of\nrotation is tilted by about 23.5\u00b0 from a vertical line sticking out of the plane of theecliptic(Figure 2.7). Being\ntilted from \u201cstraight up\u201d is not at all unusual among celestial bodies; Uranus and Pluto are actually tilted so\nmuch that they orbit the Sun \u201con their side.\u201d 36 2 \u2022 Observing the Sky: The Birth of Astronomy\nFigure2.7The Celestial Tilt.The celestial equator is tilted by 23.5\u00b0 to the ecliptic. As a result, North Americans and Europeans see\nthe Sun north of the celestial equator and high in our sky in June, and south of the celestial equator and low in the sky in December.\nThe inclination of the ecliptic is the reason the Sun moves north and south in the sky as the seasons change. In\nEarth, Moon, and Sky, we discuss the progression of the seasons in more detail.\nFixed and Wandering Stars\nThe Sun is not the only object that moves among the fixed stars. The Moon and each of the planets that are\nvisible to the unaided eye\u2014Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus (although just barely)\u2014also\nchange their positions slowly from day to day. During a single day, the Moon and planets all rise and set as\nEarth turns, just as the Sun and stars do. But like the Sun, they have independent motions among the stars,\nsuperimposed on the daily rotation of the celestial sphere. Noticing these motions, the Greeks of 2000 years\nago distinguished between what they called thefixed stars\u2014those that maintain fixed patterns among\nthemselves through many generations\u2014and thewandering stars, orplanets. The word \u201cplanet,\u201d in fact,\nmeans \u201cwanderer\u201d in ancient Greek.\nToday, we do not regard the Sun and Moon as planets, but the ancients applied the term to all seven of the\nmoving objects in the sky. Much of ancient astronomy was devoted to observing and predicting the motions of\nthese celestial wanderers. They even dedicated a unit of time, the week, to the seven objects that move on\ntheir own; that\u2019s why there are 7 days in a week. The Moon, being Earth\u2019s nearest celestial neighbor, has the\nfastest apparent motion; it completes a trip around the sky in about 1 month (ormoonth). To do this, the\nMoon moves about 12\u00b0, or 24 times its own apparent width on the sky, each day.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.1 \u2022 The Sky Above 37\nEXAMPLE 2.1\nAngles in the Sky\nA circle consists of 360 degrees (\u00b0). When we measure the angle in the sky that something moves, we can\nuse this formula:\nThis is true whether the motion is measured in kilometers per hour or degrees per hour; we just need to\nuse consistent units.\nAs an example, let\u2019s say you notice the bright starSiriusdue south from your observing location in the\nNorthern Hemisphere. You note the time, and then later, you note the time that Sirius sets below the\nhorizon. You find that Sirius has traveled an angular distance of about 75\u00b0 in 5 h. About how many hours\nwill it take for Sirius to return to its original location?\nSolution\nThe speed of Sirius is If we want to know the time required for Sirius to return to its original\nlocation, we need to wait until it goes around a full circle, or 360\u00b0. Rearranging the formula for speed we\nwere originally given, we find:\nThe actual time is a few minutes shorter than this, and we will explore why in a later chapter.\nCheck Your Learning\nThe Moon moves in the sky relative to the background stars (in addition to moving with the stars as a result\nof Earth\u2019s rotation.) Go outside at night and note the position of the Moon relative to nearby stars. Repeat\nthe observation a few hours later. How far has the Moon moved? (For reference, the diameter of the Moon\nis about 0.5\u00b0.) Based on your estimate of its motion, how long will it take for the Moon to return to the\nposition relative to the stars in which you first observed it?\nAnswer:\nThe speed of the moon is 0.5\u00b0/1 h. To move a full 360\u00b0, the moon needs 720 h: Dividing\n720 h by the conversion factor of 24 h/day reveals the lunar cycle is about 30 days.\nThe individual paths of the Moon and planets in the sky all lie close to the ecliptic, although not exactly on it.\nThis is because the paths of the planets about the Sun, and of the Moon about Earth, are all in nearly the same\nplane, as if they were circles on a huge sheet of paper. The planets, the Sun, and the Moon are thus always\nfound in the sky within a narrow 18-degree-wide belt, centered on the ecliptic, called thezodiac(Figure 2.6).\n(The root of the term \u201czodiac\u201d is the same as that of the word \u201czoo\u201d and means a collection of animals; many\nof the patterns of stars within the zodiac belt reminded the ancients of animals, such as a fish or a goat.)\nHow the planets appear to move in the sky as the months pass is a combination of their actual motions plus\nthe motion of Earth about the Sun; consequently, their paths are somewhat complex. As we will see, this\ncomplexity has fascinated and challenged astronomers for centuries.\nConstellations\nThe backdrop for the motions of the \u201cwanderers\u201d in the sky is the canopy of stars. If there were no clouds in\nthe sky and we were on a flat plain with nothing to obstruct our view, we could see about 3000 stars with the 38 2 \u2022 Observing the Sky: The Birth of Astronomy\nunaided eye. To find their way around such a multitude, the ancients found groupings of stars that made some\nfamiliar geometric pattern or (more rarely) resembled something they knew. Each civilization found its own\npatterns in the stars, much like a modern Rorschach test in which you are asked to discern patterns or pictures\nin a set of inkblots. The ancient Chinese, Egyptians, and Greeks, among others, found their own groupings\u2014or\nconstellations\u2014of stars. These were helpful in navigating among the stars and in passing their star lore on to\ntheir children.\nYou may be familiar with some of the old star patterns we still use today, such as the Big Dipper, Little Dipper,\nand Orion the hunter, with his distinctive belt of three stars (Figure 2.8). However, many of the stars we see are\nnot part of a distinctive star pattern at all, and a telescope reveals millions of stars too faint for the eye to see.\nTherefore, during the early decades of the 20th century, astronomers from many countries decided to\nestablish a more formal system for organizing the sky.\nFigure2.8Orion.(a) The winter constellation of Orion, the hunter, is surrounded by neighboring constellations, as illustrated in the\nseventeenth-century atlas by Hevelius. (b) A photograph shows the Orion region in the sky. Note the three blue stars that make up\nthe belt of the hunter. The bright red star above the belt denotes his armpit and is calledBetelgeuse(pronounced \u201cBeetel-juice\u201d).\nThe bright blue star below the belt is his foot and is called Rigel. (credit a: modification of work by Johannes Hevelius; b: modification\nof work by Matthew Spinelli)\nToday, we use the termconstellationto mean one of 88 sectors into which we divide the sky, much as the\nUnited States is divided into 50 states. The modern boundaries between the constellations are imaginary lines\nin the sky running north\u2013south and east\u2013west, so that each point in the sky falls in a specific constellation,\nalthough, like the states, not all constellations are the same size. All the constellations are listed inAppendix L.\nWhenever possible, we have named each modernconstellationafter the Latin translations of one of the\nancient Greek star patterns that lies within it. Thus, the modern constellation of Orion is a kind of box on the\nsky, which includes, among many other objects, the stars that made up the ancient picture of the hunter.\nSome people use the termasterismto denote an especially noticeable star pattern within a constellation (or\nsometimes spanning parts of several constellations). For example, the Big Dipper is an asterism within the\nconstellation of Ursa Major, the Big Bear.\nStudents are sometimes puzzled because the constellations seldom resemble the people or animals for which\nthey were named. In all likelihood, the Greeks themselves did not name groupings of stars because they\nlooked like actual people or subjects (any more than the outline of Washington state resembles George\nWashington). Rather, they named sections of the sky in honor of the characters in their mythology and then fit\nthe star configurations to the animals and people as best they could.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.2 \u2022 Ancient Astronomy 39\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThiswebsite about objects in the sky(https://openstax.org/l/30heavensabove)allows users to construct a\ndetailed sky map showing the location and information about the Sun, Moon, planets, stars, constellations,\nand even satellites orbiting Earth.

Much of modern Western civilization is derived in one way or another\nfrom the ideas of the ancient Greeks and Romans, and this is true in astronomy as well. However, many other\nancient cultures also developed sophisticated systems for observing and interpreting the sky.\nAstronomy around the World\nAncient Babylonian, Assyrian, and Egyptian astronomers knew the approximate length of the year. The\nEgyptians of 3000 years ago, for example, adopted a calendar based on a 365-day year. They kept careful track\nof the rising time of the bright star Sirius in the predawn sky, which has a yearly cycle that corresponded with\nthe flooding of the Nile River. The Chinese also had a working calendar; they determined the length of the year\nat about the same time as the Egyptians. The Chinese also recorded comets, bright meteors, and dark spots\non the Sun. (Many types of astronomical objects were introduced inScience and the Universe: A Brief Tour. If\nyou are not familiar with terms likecometsandmeteors, you may want to review that chapter.) Later, Chinese\nastronomers kept careful records of \u201cguest stars\u201d\u2014those that are normally too faint to see but suddenly flare\nup to become visible to the unaided eye for a few weeks or months. We still use some of these records in\nstudying stars that exploded a long time ago.\nThe Mayan culture in Mexico and Central America developed a sophisticated calendar based on the planet\nVenus, and they made astronomical observations from sites dedicated to this purpose a thousand years ago.\nThe Polynesians learned to navigate by the stars over hundreds of kilometers of open ocean\u2014a skill that\nenabled them to colonize new islands far away from where they began.\nIn Britain, before the widespread use of writing, ancient people used stones to keep track of the motions of\nthe Sun and Moon. We still find some of the great stone circles they built for this purpose, dating from as far\n1\nback as 2800 BCE. The best known of these is Stonehenge, which is discussed inEarth, Moon, and Sky.\nEarly Greek and Roman Cosmology\nOur concept of the cosmos\u2014its basic structure and origin\u2014is calledcosmology, a word with Greek roots.\nBefore the invention of telescopes, humans had to depend on the simple evidence of their senses for a picture\nof the universe. The ancients developed cosmologies that combined their direct view of the heavens with a\n1 For resources providing more information about the astronomy of diverse cultures around the world, please seehttp://bit.ly/\nastrocultures(http://bit.ly/astrocultures). 40 2 \u2022 Observing the Sky: The Birth of Astronomy\nrich variety of philosophical and religious symbolism.\nAt least 2000 years before Columbus, educated people in the eastern Mediterranean region knew Earth was\nround. Belief in a spherical Earth may have stemmed from the time ofPythagoras, a philosopher and\nmathematician who lived 2500 years ago. He believed circles and spheres to be \u201cperfect forms\u201d and suggested\nthat Earth should therefore be a sphere. As evidence that the gods liked spheres, the Greeks cited the fact that\nthe Moon is a sphere, using evidence we describe later.\nThe writings ofAristotle(384\u2013322 BCE), the tutor of Alexander the Great, summarize many of the ideas of his\nday. They describe how the progression of the Moon\u2019s phases\u2014its apparent changing shape\u2014results from\nour seeing different portions of the Moon\u2019s sunlit hemisphere as the month goes by (seeEarth, Moon, and\nSky). Aristotle also knew that the Sun has to be farther away from Earth than is the Moon because occasionally\nthe Moon passed exactly between Earth and the Sun and hid the Sun temporarily from view. We call this a\nsolar eclipse.\nAristotle cited convincing arguments that Earth must be round. First is the fact that as the Moon enters or\nemerges from Earth\u2019s shadow during an eclipse of the Moon, the shape of the shadow seen on the Moon is\nalways round (Figure 2.9). Only a spherical object always produces a round shadow. If Earth were a disk, for\nexample, there would be some occasions when the sunlight would strike it edge-on and its shadow on the\nMoon would be a line.\nFigure2.9Earth\u2019s Round Shadow.A lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves into and out of Earth\u2019s shadow. Note the curved\nshape of the shadow\u2014evidence for a spherical Earth that has been recognized since antiquity. (credit: modification of work by Brian\nPaczkowski)\nAs a second argument, Aristotle explained that travelers who go south a significant distance are able to\nobserve stars that are not visible farther north. And the height of the North Star\u2014the star nearest the north\ncelestial pole\u2014decreases as a traveler moves south. On a flat Earth, everyone would see the same stars\noverhead. The only possible explanation is that the traveler must have moved over a curved surface on Earth,\nshowing stars from a different angle. (See theHow Do We Know Earth Is Round?feature for more ideas on\nproving Earth is round.)\nOne Greek thinker,Aristarchusof Samos (310\u2013230 BCE), even suggested that Earth was moving around the\nSun, but Aristotle and most of the ancient Greek scholars rejected this idea. One of the reasons for their\nconclusion was the thought that if Earth moved about the Sun, they would be observing the stars from\ndifferent places along Earth\u2019s orbit. As Earth moved along, nearby stars should shift their positions in the sky\nrelative to more distant stars. In a similar way, we see foreground objects appear to move against a more\ndistant background whenever we are in motion. When we ride on a train, the trees in the foreground appear\nto shift their position relative to distant hills as the train rolls by. Unconsciously, we use this phenomenon all of\nthe time to estimate distances around us.\nThe apparent shift in the direction of an object as a result of the motion of the observer is calledparallax. We\ncall the shift in the apparent direction of a star due to Earth\u2019s orbital motionstellar parallax. The Greeks made\ndedicated efforts to observe stellar parallax, even enlisting the aid of Greek soldiers with the clearest vision,\nbut to no avail. The brighter (and presumably nearer) stars just did not seem to shift as the Greeks observed\nthem in the spring and then again in the fall (when Earth is on the opposite side of the Sun).\nThis meant either that Earth was not moving or that the stars had to be so tremendously far away that the\nparallax shift was immeasurably small. A cosmos of such enormous extent required a leap of imagination that\nmost ancient philosophers were not prepared to make, so they retreated to the safety of the Earth-centered\nview, which would dominate Western thinking for nearly two millennia.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.2 \u2022 Ancient Astronomy 41\nASTRONOMY BASICS\nHow Do We Know Earth Is Round?\nIn addition to the two ways (from Aristotle\u2019s writings) discussed in this chapter, you might also reason as\nfollows:\n1. Let\u2019s watch a ship leave its port and sail into the distance on a clear day. On a flat Earth, we would just\nsee the ship get smaller and smaller as it sails away. But this isn\u2019t what we actually observe. Instead,\nships sink below the horizon, with the hull disappearing first and the mast remaining visible for a while\nlonger. Eventually, only the top of the mast can be seen as the ship sails around the curvature of Earth.\nFinally, the ship disappears under the horizon.\n2. The International Space Station circles Earth once every 90 minutes or so. Photographs taken from the\nshuttle and other satellites show that Earth is round from every perspective.\n3. Suppose you made a friend in each time zone of Earth. You call all of them at the same hour and ask,\n\u201cWhere is the Sun?\u201d On a flat Earth, each caller would give you roughly the same answer. But on a\nround Earth you would find that, for some friends, the Sun would be high in the sky whereas for others\nit would be rising, setting, or completely out of sight (and this last group of friends would be upset with\nyou for waking them up).\nMeasurement of Earth by Eratosthenes\nThe Greeks not only knew Earth was round, but also they were able to measure its size. The first fairly accurate\ndetermination of Earth\u2019s diameter was made in about 200 BCE byEratosthenes(276\u2013194 BCE), a Greek living in\nAlexandria, Egypt. His method was a geometric one, based on observations of the Sun.\nThe Sun is so distant from us that all the light rays that strike our planet approach us along essentially parallel\nlines. To see why, look atFigure 2.10. Take a source of light near Earth\u2014say, at position A. Its rays strike\ndifferent parts of Earth along diverging paths. From a light source at B, or at C (which is still farther away), the\nangle between rays that strike opposite parts of Earth is smaller. The more distant the source, the smaller the\nangle between the rays. For a source infinitely distant, the rays travel along parallel lines.\nFigure2.10Light Rays from Space.The more distant an object, the more nearly parallel the rays of light coming from it.\nOf course, the Sun is not infinitely far away, but given its distance of 150 million kilometers, light rays striking\nEarth from a point on the Sun diverge from one another by an angle far too small to be observed with the\nunaided eye. As a consequence, if people all over Earth who could see the Sun were to point at it, their fingers\nwould, essentially, all be parallel to one another. (The same is also true for the planets and stars\u2014an idea we\nwill use in our discussion of how telescopes work.)\nEratosthenes was told that on the first day of summer at Syene, Egypt (near modern Aswan), sunlight struck 42 2 \u2022 Observing the Sky: The Birth of Astronomy\nthe bottom of a vertical well at noon. This indicated that the Sun was directly over the well\u2014meaning that\nSyene was on a direct line from the center of Earth to the Sun. At the corresponding time and date in\nAlexandria, Eratosthenes observed the shadow a column made and saw that the Sun was not directly\noverhead, but was slightly south of the zenith, so that its rays made an angle with the vertical equal to about\n1/50 of a circle (7\u00b0). Because the Sun\u2019s rays striking the two cities are parallel to one another, why would the\ntwo rays not make the same angle with Earth\u2019s surface? Eratosthenes reasoned that the curvature of the\nround Earth meant that \u201cstraight up\u201d was not the same in the two cities. And the measurement of the angle in\nAlexandria, he realized, allowed him to figure out the size of Earth. Alexandria, he saw, must be 1/50 of Earth\u2019s\ncircumference north of Syene (Figure 2.11). Alexandria had been measured to be 5000 stadia north of Syene.\n(Thestadiumwas a Greek unit of length, derived from the length of the racetrack in a stadium.) Eratosthenes\nthus found that Earth\u2019s circumference must be 50 \u00d7 5000, or 250,000 stadia.\nFigure2.11How Eratosthenes Measured the Size of Earth.Eratosthenesmeasured the size of Earth by observing the angle at\nwhich the Sun\u2019s rays hit our planet\u2019s surface. The Sun\u2019s rays come in parallel, but because Earth\u2019s surface curves, a ray at Syene\ncomes straight down whereas a ray at Alexandria makes an angle of 7\u00b0 with the vertical. That means, in effect, that at Alexandria,\nEarth\u2019s surface has curved away from Syene by 7\u00b0 of 360\u00b0, or 1/50 of a full circle. Thus, the distance between the two cities must be 1/\n50 the circumference of Earth. (credit: modification of work by NOAA Ocean Service Education)\nIt is not possible to evaluate precisely the accuracy of Eratosthenes solution because there is doubt about\nwhich of the various kinds of Greek stadia he used as his unit of distance. If it was the common Olympic\nstadium, his result is about 20% too large. According to another interpretation, he used a stadium equal to\nabout 1/6 kilometer, in which case his figure was within 1% of the correct value of 40,000 kilometers. Even if his\nmeasurement was not exact, his success at measuring the size of our planet by using only shadows, sunlight,\nand the power of human thought was one of the greatest intellectual achievements in history.\nHipparchus and Precession\nPerhaps the greatest astronomer of antiquity wasHipparchus, born in Nicaea in what is present-day Turkey.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.2 \u2022 Ancient Astronomy 43\nHe erected an observatory on the island of Rhodes around 150 BCE, when the Roman Republic was expanding\nits influence throughout the Mediterranean region. There he measured, as accurately as possible, the\npositions of objects in the sky, compiling a pioneering star catalog with about 850 entries. He designated\ncelestial coordinates for each star, specifying its position in the sky, just as we specify the position of a point on\nEarth by giving its latitude and longitude.\nHe also divided the stars intoapparent magnitudesaccording to their apparent brightness. He called the\nbrightest ones \u201cstars of the first magnitude\u201d; the next brightest group, \u201cstars of the second magnitude\u201d; and\nso forth. This rather arbitrary system, in modified form, still remains in use today (although it is less and less\nuseful for professional astronomers).\nBy observing the stars and comparing his data with older observations, Hipparchus made one of his most\nremarkable discoveries: the position in the sky of the north celestial pole had altered over the previous century\nand a half. Hipparchus deduced correctly that this had happened not only during the period covered by his\nobservations, but was in fact happening all the time: the direction around which the sky appears to rotate\nchanges slowly but continuously. Recall from the section on celestial poles and the celestial equator that the\nnorth celestial pole is just the projection of Earth\u2019s North Pole into the sky. If the north celestial pole is\nwobbling around, then Earth itself must be doing the wobbling. Today, we understand that the direction in\nwhich Earth\u2019s axis points does indeed change slowly but regularly\u2014a motion we callprecession. If you have\never watched a spinning top wobble, you observed a similar kind of motion. The top\u2019s axis describes a path in\nthe shape of a cone, as Earth\u2019s gravity tries to topple it (Figure 2.12).\nFigure2.12Precession.Just as the axis of a rapidly spinning top wobbles slowly in a circle, so the axis of Earth wobbles in a\n26,000-year cycle. Today the north celestial pole is near the star Polaris, but about 5000 years ago it was close to a star called Thuban,\nand in 14,000 years it will be closest to the star Vega.\nBecause our planet is not an exact sphere, but bulges a bit at the equator, the pulls of the Sun and Moon cause\nit to wobble like a top. It takes about 26,000 years for Earth\u2019s axis to complete one circle of precession. As a\nresult of this motion, the point where our axis points in the sky changes as time goes on. WhilePolarisis the\nstar closest to the north celestial pole today (it will reach its closest point around the year 2100), the starVega\nin the constellation of Lyra will be the North Star in 14,000 years. 44 2 \u2022 Observing the Sky: The Birth of Astronomy\nPtolemy\u2019s Model of the Solar System\nThe last great astronomer of the Roman era was ClaudiusPtolemy(or Ptolemaeus), who flourished in\nAlexandria in about the year 140. He wrote a mammoth compilation of astronomical knowledge, which today\nis called by its Arabic name,Almagest(meaning \u201cThe Greatest\u201d).Almagestdoes not deal exclusively with\nPtolemy\u2019s own work; it includes a discussion of the astronomical achievements of the past, principally those of\nHipparchus. Today, it is our main source of information about the work of Hipparchus and other Greek\nastronomers.\nPtolemy\u2019s most important contribution was a geometric representation of the solar system that predicted the\npositions of the planets for any desired date and time. Hipparchus, not having enough data on hand to solve\nthe problem himself, had instead amassed observational material for posterity to use. Ptolemy supplemented\nthis material with new observations of his own and produced a cosmological model that endured more than a\nthousand years, until the time of Copernicus.\nThe complicating factor in explaining the motions of the planets is that their apparent wandering in the sky\nresults from the combination of their own motions with Earth\u2019s orbital revolution. As we watch the planets\nfrom our vantage point on the moving Earth, it is a little like watching a car race while you are competing in it.\nSometimes opponents\u2019 cars pass you, but at other times you pass them, making them appear to move\nbackward for a while with respect to you.\nFigure 2.13shows the motion of Earth and a planet farther from the Sun\u2014in this case,Mars. Earth travels\naround the Sun in the same direction as the other planet and in nearly the same plane, but its orbital speed is\nfaster. As a result, it overtakes the planet periodically, like a faster race car on the inside track. The figure\nshows where we see the planet in the sky at different times. The path of the planet among the stars is\nillustrated in the star field on the right side of the figure.\nFigure2.13Retrograde Motion of a Planet beyond Earth\u2019s Orbit.The letters on the diagram show where Earth and Mars are at\ndifferent times. By following the lines from each Earth position through each corresponding Mars position, you can see how the\nretrograde path of Mars looks against the background stars.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.2 \u2022 Ancient Astronomy 45\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTheplanetary configurations simulator from Foothill AstroSims(https://openstax.org/l/30planetconfig)\nallows you to see the usual prograde and occasional retrograde motion of other planets. You can switch\nback and forth between viewing motion from Earth and Mars (as well as other planets).\nNormally, planets move eastward in the sky over the weeks and months as they orbit the Sun, but from\npositions B to D inFigure 2.13, as Earth passes the planets in our example, it appears to drift backward,\nmoving west in the sky. Even though it is actually moving to the east, the faster-moving Earth has overtaken it\nand seems, from our perspective, to be leaving it behind. As Earth rounds its orbit toward position E, the\nplanet again takes up its apparent eastward motion in the sky. The temporary apparent westward motion of a\nplanet as Earth swings between it and the Sun is calledretrograde motion. Such backward motion is much\neasier for us to understand today, now that we know Earth is one of the moving planets and not the unmoving\ncenter of all creation. But Ptolemy was faced with the far more complex problem of explaining such motion\nwhile assuming a stationary Earth.\nFurthermore, because the Greeks believed that celestial motions had to be circles, Ptolemy had to construct\nhis model using circles alone. To do it, he needed dozens of circles, some moving around other circles, in a\ncomplex structure that makes a modern viewer dizzy. But we must not let our modern judgment cloud our\nadmiration for Ptolemy\u2019s achievement. In his day, a complex universe centered on Earth was perfectly\nreasonable and, in its own way, quite beautiful. However, as Alfonso X, the King of Castile, was reported to\nhave said after having the Ptolemaic system of planet motions explained to him, \u201cIf the Lord Almighty had\nconsulted me before embarking upon Creation, I should have recommended something simpler.\u201d\nPtolemy solved the problem of explaining the observed motions of planets by having each planet revolve in a\nsmall orbit called anepicycle. The center of the epicycle then revolved about Earth on a circle called adeferent\n(Figure 2.14). When the planet is at positionxinFigure 2.14on the epicycle orbit, it is moving in the same\ndirection as the center of the epicycle; from Earth, the planet appears to be moving eastward. When the planet\nis aty, however, its motion is in the direction opposite to the motion of the epicycle\u2019s center around Earth. By\nchoosing the right combination of speeds and distances, Ptolemy succeeded in having the planet moving\nwestward at the correct speed and for the correct interval of time, thus replicating retrograde motion with his\nmodel.\nFigure2.14Ptolemy\u2019s Complicated Cosmological System.Each planet orbits around a small circle called anepicycle. Each epicycle\norbits on a larger circle called thedeferent. This system is not centered exactly on Earth but on an offset point called theequant. The 46 2 \u2022 Observing the Sky: The Birth of Astronomy\nGreeks needed all this complexity to explain the actual motions in the sky because they believed that Earth was stationary and that\nall sky motions had to be circular.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nUse thePtolemaic System simulator from Foothill AstroSims(https://openstax.org/l/30ptolemaic)to\nexplore how Ptolemy's system of deferents and epicycles explained the apparent motion of the planets.\nHowever, we shall see inOrbits and Gravitythat the planets, like Earth, travel about the Sun in orbits that are\nellipses, not circles. Their actual behavior cannot be represented accurately by a scheme of uniform circular\nmotions. In order to match the observed motions of the planets, Ptolemy had to center the deferent circles,\nnot on Earth, but at points some distance from Earth. In addition, he introduced uniform circular motion\naround yet another axis, called theequant point. All of these considerably complicated his scheme.\nIt is a tribute to the genius ofPtolemyas a mathematician that he was able to develop such a complex system\nto account successfully for the observations of planets. It may be that Ptolemy did not intend for his\ncosmological model to describe reality, but merely to serve as a mathematical representation that allowed him\nto predict the positions of the planets at any time. Whatever his thinking, his model, with some modifications,\nwas eventually accepted as authoritative in the Muslim world and (later) in Christian Europe.\n2.3 Astrology and Astronomy\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain the origins of astrology\nExplain what a horoscope is\nSummarize the arguments that invalidate astrology as a scientific practice\nMany ancient cultures regarded the planets and stars as representatives or symbols of the gods or other\nsupernatural forces that controlled their lives. For them, the study of the heavens was not an abstract subject;\nit was connected directly to the life-and-death necessity of understanding the actions of the gods and currying\nfavor with them. Before the time of our scientific perspectives, everything that happened in nature\u2014from the\nweather, to diseases and accidents, to celestial surprises such as eclipses or new comets\u2014was thought to be\nan expression of the whims or displeasure of the gods. Any signs that helped people understand what these\ngods had in mind were considered extremely important.\nThe movements of the seven objects that had the power to \u201cwander\u201d through the realm of the sky\u2014the Sun,\nthe Moon, and five planets visible to the unaided eye\u2014clearly must have special significance in such a system\nof thinking.\nMost ancient cultures associated these seven objects with various supernatural rulers in their pantheon and\nkept track of them for religious reasons. Even in the comparatively sophisticated Greece of antiquity, the\nplanets had the names of gods and were credited with having the same powers and influences as the gods\nwhose names they bore. From such ideas was born the ancient system calledastrology, still practiced by\nsome people today, in which the positions of these bodies among the stars of the zodiac are thought to hold\nthe key to understanding what we can expect from life.\nThe Beginnings of Astrology\nAstrology began in Babylonia about two and half millennia ago. The Babylonians, believing the planets and\ntheir motions influenced the fortunes of kings and nations, used their knowledge of astronomy to guide their\nrulers. When the Babylonian culture was absorbed by the Greeks, astrology gradually came to influence the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.3 \u2022 Astrology and Astronomy 47\nentire Western world and eventually spread to Asia as well.\nBy the 2nd century BCE the Greeks democratized astrology by developing the idea that the planets influence\nevery individual. In particular, they believed that the configuration of the Sun, Moon, and planets at the\nmoment of birth affected a person\u2019s personality and fortune\u2014a doctrine callednatal astrology. Natal\nastrology reached its peak with Ptolemy 400 years later. As famous for his astrology as for his astronomy,\nPtolemy compiled theTetrabiblos, a treatise on astrology that remains the \u201cbible\u201d of the subject. It is\nessentially this ancient religion, older than Christianity or Islam, that is still practiced by today\u2019s astrologers.\nThe Horoscope\nThe key to natal astrology is thehoroscope, a chart showing the positions of the planets in the sky at the\nmoment of an individual\u2019s birth. The word \u201choroscope\u201d comes from the Greek wordshora(meaning \u201ctime\u201d)\nandskopos(meaning a \u201cwatcher\u201d or \u201cmarker\u201d), so \u201choroscope\u201d can literally be translated as \u201cmarker of the\nhour.\u201d When a horoscope is charted, the planets (including the Sun and Moon, classed aswanderersby the\nancients) must first be located in the zodiac. At the time astrology was set up, the zodiac was divided into 12\nsectors calledsigns(Figure 2.15), each 30\u00b0 long. Each sign was named after a constellation in the sky through\nwhich the Sun, Moon, and planets were seen to pass\u2014the sign of Virgo after the constellation of Virgo, for\nexample.\nFigure2.15Zodiac Signs.The signs of the zodiac are shown in a medieval woodcut.\nWhen someone today casually asks you your \u201csign,\u201d they are asking for your \u201csun sign\u201d\u2014which zodiac sign\nthe Sun was in at the moment you were born. However, more than 2000 years have passed since the signs\nreceived their names from the constellations. Because of precession, the constellations of the zodiac slide\nwestward along the ecliptic, going once around the sky in about 26,000 years. Thus, today the real stars have\nslipped around by about 1/12 of the zodiac\u2014about the width of one sign.\nIn most forms of astrology, however, the signs have remained assigned to the dates of the year they had when\nastrology was first set up. This means that the astrological signs and the real constellations are out of step; the\nsign of Aries, for example, now occupies the constellation of Pisces. When you look up your sun sign in a\nnewspaper astrology column, the name of the sign associated with your birthday is no longer the name of the\nconstellation in which the Sun was actually located when you were born. To know that constellation, you must 48 2 \u2022 Observing the Sky: The Birth of Astronomy\nlook for the sign before the one that includes your birthday.\nA complete horoscope shows the location of not only the Sun, but also the Moon and each planet in the sky by\nindicating its position in the appropriate sign of the zodiac. However, as the celestial sphere turns (owing to\nthe rotation of Earth), the entire zodiac moves across the sky to the west, completing a circuit of the heavens\neach day. Thus, the position in the sky (or \u201chouse\u201d in astrology) must also be calculated. There are more or\nless standardized rules for the interpretation of the horoscope, most of which (at least in Western schools of\nastrology) are derived from theTetrabiblosof Ptolemy. Each sign, each house, and each planet\u2014the last acting\nas a center of force\u2014is supposed to be associated with particular matters in a person\u2019s life.\nThe detailed interpretation of a horoscope is a very complicated business, and there are many schools of\nastrological thought on how it should be done. Although some of the rules may be standardized, how each\nrule is to be weighed and applied is a matter of judgment\u2014and \u201cart.\u201d It also means that it is very difficult to tie\ndown astrology to specific predictions or to get the same predictions from different astrologers.\nAstrology Today\nAstrologers today use the same basic principles laid down by Ptolemy nearly 2000 years ago. They cast\nhoroscopes (a process much simplified by the development of appropriate computer programs) and suggest\ninterpretations. Sun sign astrology (which you read in the newspapers and many magazines) is a recent,\nsimplified variant of natal astrology. Although even professional astrologers do not place much trust in such a\nlimited scheme, which tries to fit everyone into just 12 groups, sun sign astrology is taken seriously by many\npeople (perhaps because it is discussed so commonly in the media).\nToday, we know much more about the nature of the planets as physical bodies, as well as about human\ngenetics, than the ancients could. It is hard to imagine how the positions of the Sun, Moon, or planets in the\nsky at the moment of our birth could have anything to do with our personality or future. There are no known\nforces, not gravity or anything else, that could cause such effects. (For example, a straightforward calculation\nshows that the gravitational pull of the obstetrician delivering a newborn baby is greater than that of Mars.)\nAstrologers thus have to argue there must be unknown forces exerted by the planets that depend on their\nconfigurations with respect to one another and that do not vary according to the distance of the\nplanet\u2014forces for which there is no shred of evidence.\nAnother curious aspect of astrology is its emphasis on planet configurations at birth. What about the forces\nthat might influence us at conception? Isn\u2019t our genetic makeup more important for determining our\npersonality than the circumstances of our birth? Would we really be a different person if we had been born a\nfew hours earlier or later, as astrology claims? (Back when astrology was first conceived, birth was thought of\nas a moment of magic significance, but today we understand a lot more about the long process that precedes\nit.)\nActually, very few well-educated people today buy the claim that our entire lives are predetermined by\nastrological influences at birth, but many people apparently believe that astrology has validity as an indicator\nof affinities and personality. A surprising number of Americans make judgments about people\u2014whom they\nwill hire, associate with, and even marry\u2014on the basis of astrological information. To be sure, these are\ndifficult decisions, and you might argue that we should use any relevant information that might help us to\nmake the right choices. But does astrology actually provide any useful information on human personality? This\nis the kind of question that can be tested using the scientific method (seeTesting Astrology).\nThe results of hundreds of tests are all the same: there is no evidence that natal astrology has any predictive\npower, even in a statistical sense. Why, then, do people often seem to have anecdotes about how well their\nown astrologer advised them? Effective astrologers today use the language of the zodiac and the horoscope\nonly as the outward trappings of their craft. Mostly they work as amateur therapists, offering simple truths\nthat clients like or need to hear. (Recent studies have shown that just about any sort of short-term therapy\nmakes people feel a little better because the very act of talking about our problems with someone who listens\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.3 \u2022 Astrology and Astronomy 49\nattentively is, in itself, beneficial.)\nThe scheme of astrology has no basis in scientific fact, however; at best, it can be described as a\npseudoscience. It is an interesting historical system, left over from prescientific days and best remembered for\nthe impetus it gave people to learn the cycles and patterns of the sky. From it grew the science of astronomy,\nwhich is our main subject for discussion.\nMAKING CONNECTIONS\nTesting Astrology\nIn response to modern public interest in astrology, scientists have carried out a wide range of statistical\ntests to assess its predictive power. The simplest of these examine sun sign astrology to determine\nwhether\u2014as astrologers assert\u2014some signs are more likely than others to be associated with some\nobjective measure of success, such as winning Olympic medals, earning high corporate salaries, or\nachieving elective office or high military rank. (You can devise such a test yourself by looking up the birth\ndates of all members of Congress, for example, or all members of the U.S. Olympic team.) Are our political\nleaders somehow selected at birth by their horoscopes and thus more likely to be Leos, say, than Scorpios?\nYou do not even need to be specific about your prediction in such tests. After all, many practitioners of\nastrology disagree about which signs go with which personality characteristics. To demonstrate the validity\nof the astrological hypothesis, it would be sufficient if the birthdays of all our leaders clustered in any one\nor two signs in some statistically significant way. Dozens of such tests have been performed, and all have\ncome up completely negative: the birth dates of leaders in all fields tested have been found to be\ndistributed randomly amongallthe signs. Sun sign astrology does not predict anything about a person\u2019s\nfuture occupation or strong personality traits.\nIn a fine example of such a test, two statisticians examined the reenlistment records of the United States\nMarine Corps. We suspect you will agree that it takes a certain kind of personality not only to enlist, but also\nto reenlist in the Marines. If sun signs can predict strong personality traits\u2014as astrologers claim\u2014then\nthose who reenlisted (with similar personalities) should have been distributed preferentially in those one or\nfew signs that matched the personality of someone who loves being a Marine. However, the reenlisted\nwere distributed randomly among all the signs.\nMore sophisticated studies have also been done, involving full horoscopes calculated for thousands of\nindividuals. The results of all these studies are also negative: none of the systems of astrology has been\nshown to be at all effective in connecting astrological aspects to personality, success, or finding the right\nperson to love.\nOther tests show that it hardly seems to matter what a horoscope interpretation says, as long as it is vague\nenough, and as long as each subject feels it was prepared personally just for him or her. The French\nstatistician Michel Gauquelin, for example, sent the horoscope interpretation for one of the worst mass\nmurderers in history to 150 people, but told each recipient that it was a \u201creading\u201d prepared exclusively for\nhim or her. Ninety-four percent of the readers said they recognized themselves in the interpretation of the\nmass murderer\u2019s horoscope.\nGeoffrey Dean, an Australian researcher, reversed the astrological readings of 22 subjects, substituting\nphrases that were the opposite of what the horoscope actually said. Yet, his subjects said that the resulting\nreadings applied to them just as often (95%) as the people to whom the original phrases were given. 50 2 \u2022 Observing the Sky: The Birth of Astronomy\nLINK TO LEARNING\nFor more on astrology and science from an astronomer\u2019s point of view, read thisarticle\n(https://openstax.org/l/30astrosociety)that shines light on the topic through an accessible Q&A.\n2.4 The Birth of Modern Astronomy\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain how Copernicus developed the heliocentric model of the solar system\nExplain the Copernican model of planetary motion and describe evidence or arguments in favor of it\nDescribe Galileo\u2019s discoveries concerning the study of motion and forces\nExplain how Galileo\u2019s discoveries tilted the balance of evidence in favor of the Copernican model\nAstronomy made no major advances in strife-torn medieval Europe. The birth and expansion of Islam after the\nseventh century led to a flowering of Arabic and Jewish cultures that preserved, translated, and added to many\nof the astronomical ideas of the Greeks. Many of the names of the brightest stars, for example, are today\ntaken from the Arabic, as are such astronomical terms as \u201czenith.\u201d\nAs European culture began to emerge from its long, dark age, trading with Arab countries led to a rediscovery\nof ancient texts such asAlmagestand to a reawakening of interest in astronomical questions. This time of\nrebirth (in French, \u201crenaissance\u201d) in astronomy was embodied in the work of Copernicus (Figure 2.16).\nFigure2.16Nicolaus Copernicus (1473\u20131543).Copernicus was a cleric and scientist who played a leading role in the emergence of\nmodern science. Although he could not prove that Earth revolves about the Sun, he presented such compelling arguments for this\nidea that he turned the tide of cosmological thought and laid the foundations upon which Galileo and Kepler so effectively built in\nthe following century.\nCopernicus\nOne of the most important events of the Renaissance was the displacement of Earth from the center of the\nuniverse, an intellectual revolution initiated by a Polish cleric in the sixteenth century. NicolausCopernicuswas\nborn in Torun, a mercantile town along the Vistula River. His training was in law and medicine, but his main\ninterests were astronomy and mathematics. His great contribution to science was a critical reappraisal of the\nexisting theories of planetary motion and the development of a new Sun-centered, orheliocentric, model of\nthe solar system. Copernicus concluded that Earth is a planet and that all the planets circle the Sun. Only the\nMoon orbits Earth (Figure 2.17).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.4 \u2022 The Birth of Modern Astronomy 51\nFigure2.17Copernicus\u2019 System.Copernicus developed a heliocentric plan of the solar system. This system was published in the\nfirst edition ofDe Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium. Notice the wordSolfor \u201cSun\u201d in the middle. (credit: Nicolai Copernici)\nCopernicusdescribed his ideas in detail in his bookDe Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium(On the Revolution\nof Celestial Orbs), published in 1543, the year of his death. By this time, the old Ptolemaic system needed\nsignificant adjustments to predict the positions of the planets correctly. Copernicus wanted to develop an\nimproved theory from which to calculate planetary positions, but in doing so, he was himself not free of all\ntraditional prejudices.\nHe began with several assumptions that were common in his time, such as the idea that the motions of the\nheavenly bodies must be made up of combinations of uniform circular motions. But he did not assume (as\nmost people did) that Earth had to be in the center of the universe, and he presented a defense of the\nheliocentric system that was elegant and persuasive. His ideas, although not widely accepted until more than a\ncentury after his death, were much discussed among scholars and, ultimately, had a profound influence on the\ncourse of world history.\nOne of the objections raised to the heliocentric theory was that if Earth were moving, we would all sense or\nfeel this motion. Solid objects would be ripped from the surface, a ball dropped from a great height would not\nstrike the ground directly below it, and so forth. But a moving person is not necessarily aware of that motion.\nWe have all experienced seeing an adjacent train, bus, or ship appear to move, only to discover that it is we\nwho are moving.\nCopernicus argued that the apparent motion of the Sun about Earth during the course of a year could be\nrepresented equally well by a motion of Earth about the Sun. He also reasoned that the apparent rotation of\nthe celestial sphere could be explained by assuming that Earth rotates while the celestial sphere is stationary.\nTo the objection that if Earth rotated about an axis it would fly into pieces, Copernicus answered that if such\nmotion would tear Earth apart, the still faster motion of the much larger celestial sphere required by the\ngeocentric hypothesis would be even more devastating.\nThe Heliocentric Model\nThe most important idea in Copernicus\u2019De Revolutionibusis that Earth is one of six (then-known) planets that\nrevolve about the Sun. Using this concept, he was able to work out the correct general picture of the solar\nsystem. He placed the planets, starting nearest the Sun, in the correct order: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,\nJupiter, and Saturn. Further, he deduced that the nearer a planet is to the Sun, the greater its orbital speed. 52 2 \u2022 Observing the Sky: The Birth of Astronomy\nWith his theory, he was able to explain the complex retrograde motions of the planets without epicycles and to\nwork out a roughly correct scale for the solar system.\nCopernicus could not prove that Earth revolves about the Sun. In fact, with some adjustments, the old\nPtolemaic system could have accounted, as well, for the motions of the planets in the sky. But Copernicus\npointed out that the Ptolemaic cosmology was clumsy and lacking the beauty and symmetry of its successor.\nIn Copernicus\u2019 time, in fact, few people thought there were ways to prove whether the heliocentric or the older\ngeocentric system was correct. A long philosophical tradition, going back to the Greeks and defended by the\nCatholic Church, held that pure human thought combined with divine revelation represented the path to truth.\nNature, as revealed by our senses, was suspect. For example, Aristotle had reasoned that heavier objects\n(having more of the quality that made them heavy) must fall to Earth faster than lighter ones. This is\nabsolutely incorrect, as any simple experiment dropping two balls of different weights shows. However, in\nCopernicus\u2019 day, experiments did not carry much weight (if you will pardon the expression); Aristotle\u2019s\nreasoning was more convincing.\nIn this environment, there was little motivation to carry out observations or experiments to distinguish\nbetween competing cosmological theories (or anything else). It should not surprise us, therefore, that the\nheliocentric idea was debated for more than half a century without any tests being applied to determine its\nvalidity. (In fact, in the North American colonies, the older geocentric system was still taught at Harvard\nUniversity in the first years after it was founded in 1636.)\nContrast this with the situation today, when scientists rush to test each new hypothesis and do not accept any\nideas until the results are in. For example, when two researchers at the University of Utah announced in 1989\nthat they had discovered a way to achieve nuclear fusion (the process that powers the stars) at room\ntemperature, other scientists at more than 25 laboratories around the United States attempted to duplicate\n\u201ccold fusion\u201d within a few weeks\u2014without success, as it turned out. The cold fusion theory soon went down in\nflames.\nHow would we look at Copernicus\u2019 model today? When a new hypothesis or theory is proposed in science, it\nmust first be checked for consistency with what is already known. Copernicus\u2019 heliocentric idea passes this\ntest, for it allows planetary positions to be calculated at least as well as does the geocentric theory. The next\nstep is to determine which predictions the new hypothesis makes that differ from those of competing ideas. In\nthe case ofCopernicus, one example is the prediction that, if Venus circles the Sun, the planet should go\nthrough the full range of phases just as the Moon does, whereas if it circles Earth, it should not (Figure 2.18).\nAlso, we should not be able to see the full phase of Venus from Earth because the Sun would then be between\nVenus and Earth.

You can also see its\ndistance from Earth as it orbits the Sun.\nGalileo and the Beginning of Modern Science\nMany of the modern scientific concepts of observation, experimentation, and the testing of hypotheses\nthrough careful quantitative measurements were pioneered by a man who lived nearly a century after\nCopernicus.GalileoGalilei (Figure 2.19), a contemporary of Shakespeare, was born in Pisa. Like Copernicus, he\nbegan training for a medical career, but he had little interest in the subject and later switched to mathematics.\nHe held faculty positions at the University of Pisa and the University of Padua, and eventually became\nmathematician to the Grand Duke of Tuscany in Florence.\nFigure2.19Galileo Galilei (1564\u20131642).Galileo advocated that we perform experiments or make observations to ask nature its\nways. When Galileo turned the telescope to the sky, he found things were not the way philosophers had supposed. 54 2 \u2022 Observing the Sky: The Birth of Astronomy\nGalileo\u2019s greatest contributions were in the field of mechanics, the study of motion and the actions of forces\non bodies. It was familiar to all persons then, as it is to us now, that if something is at rest, it tends to remain at\nrest and requires some outside influence to start it in motion. Rest was thus generally regarded as the natural\nstate of matter. Galileo showed, however, that rest is no more natural than motion.\nIf an object is slid along a rough horizontal floor, it soon comes to rest because friction between it and the\nfloor acts as a retarding force. However, if the floor and the object are both highly polished, the object, given\nthe same initial speed, will slide farther before stopping. On a smooth layer of ice, it will slide farther still.\nGalileo reasoned that if all resisting effects could be removed, the object would continue in a steady state of\nmotion indefinitely. He argued that a force is required not only to start an object moving from rest but also to\nslow down, stop, speed up, or change the direction of a moving object. You will appreciate this if you have ever\ntried to stop a rolling car by leaning against it, or a moving boat by tugging on a line.\nGalileoalso studied the way objectsaccelerate\u2014change their speed or direction of motion. Galileo watched\nobjects as they fell freely or rolled down a ramp. He found that such objects accelerate uniformly; that is, in\nequal intervals of time they gain equal increments in speed. Galileo formulated these newly found laws in\nprecise mathematical terms that enabled future experimenters to predict how far and how fast objects would\nmove in various lengths of time.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nIn theory, if Galileo is right, a feather and a hammer, dropped at the same time from a height, should land\nat the same moment. On Earth, this experiment is not possible because air resistance and air movements\nmake the feather flutter, instead of falling straight down, accelerated only by the force of gravity. For\ngenerations, physics teachers had said that the place to try this experiment is somewhere where there is no\nair, such as the Moon. In 1971,Apollo 15astronaut David Scott took a hammer and feather to the Moon and\ntried it, to the delight of physics nerds everywhere. NASA provides thevideo of the hammer and feather\n(https://openstax.org/l/30HamVsFeath)as well as a brief explanation.\nSometime in the 1590s, Galileo adopted the Copernican hypothesis of a heliocentric solar system. In Roman\nCatholic Italy, this was not a popular philosophy, for Church authorities still upheld the ideas of Aristotle and\nPtolemy, and they had powerful political and economic reasons for insisting that Earth was the center of\ncreation. Galileo not only challenged this thinking but also had the audacity to write in Italian rather than\nscholarly Latin, and to lecture publicly on those topics. For him, there was no contradiction between the\nauthority of the Church in matters of religion and morality, and the authority of nature (revealed by\nexperiments) in matters of science. It was primarily because of Galileo and his \u201cdangerous\u201d opinions that, in\n1616, the Church issued a prohibition decree stating that the Copernican doctrine was \u201cfalse and absurd\u201d and\nnot to be held or defended.\nGalileo\u2019s Astronomical Observations\nIt is not certain who first conceived of the idea of combining two or more pieces of glass to produce an\ninstrument that enlarged images of distant objects, making them appear nearer. The first such \u201cspyglasses\u201d\n(now calledtelescopes) that attracted much notice were made in 1608 by the Dutch spectacle maker Hans\nLippershey (1570\u20131619). Galileo heard of the discovery and, without ever having seen an assembled telescope,\nconstructed one of his own with a three-power magnification (3\u00d7), which made distant objects appear three\ntimes nearer and larger (Figure 2.20).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2.4 \u2022 The Birth of Modern Astronomy 55\nFigure2.20Telescope Used by Galileo.Thetelescopehas a wooden tube covered with paper and a lens 26 millimeters across.\nOn August 25, 1609,Galileodemonstrated a telescope with a magnification of 9\u00d7 to government officials of the\ncity-state of Venice. By a magnification of 9\u00d7, we mean the linear dimensions of the objects being viewed\nappeared nine times larger or, alternatively, the objects appeared nine times closer than they really were.\nThere were obvious military advantages associated with a device for seeing distant objects. For his invention,\nGalileo\u2019s salary was nearly doubled, and he was granted lifetime tenure as a professor. (His university\ncolleagues were outraged, particularly because the invention was not even original.)\nOthers had used the telescope before Galileo to observe things on Earth. But in a flash of insight that changed\nthe history of astronomy, Galileo realized that he could turn the power of the telescope toward the heavens.\nBefore using his telescope for astronomical observations, Galileo had to devise a stable mount and improve\nthe optics. He increased the magnification to 30\u00d7. Galileo also needed to acquire confidence in the telescope.\nAt that time, human eyes were believed to be the final arbiter of truth about size, shape, and color. Lenses,\nmirrors, and prisms were known to distort distant images by enlarging, reducing, or inverting them, or\nspreading the light into a spectrum (rainbow of colors). Galileo undertook repeated experiments to convince\nhimself that what he saw through the telescope was identical to what he saw up close. Only then could he\nbegin to believe that the miraculous phenomena the telescope revealed in the heavens were real.\nBeginning his astronomical work late in 1609, Galileo found that many stars too faint to be seen with the\nunaided eye became visible with his telescope. In particular, he found that some nebulous blurs resolved into\nmany stars, and that the Milky Way\u2014the strip of whiteness across the night sky\u2014was also made up of a\nmultitude of individual stars.\nExamining the planets, Galileo found four moons revolving aboutJupiterin times ranging from just under 2\ndays to about 17 days. This discovery was particularly important because it showed that not everything has to\nrevolve around Earth. Furthermore, it demonstrated that there could be centers of motion that are themselves\nin motion. Defenders of the geocentric view had argued that if Earth was in motion, then the Moon would be\nleft behind because it could hardly keep up with a rapidly moving planet. Yet, here were Jupiter\u2019s moons doing\nexactly that. (To recognize this discovery and honor his work, NASA named a spacecraft that explored the\nJupiter system Galileo.)\nWith his telescope, Galileo was able to carry out the test of the Copernican theory mentioned earlier, based on\nthe phases ofVenus. Within a few months, he had found that Venus goes through phases like the Moon,\nshowing that it must revolve about the Sun, so that we see different parts of its daylight side at different times\n(seeFigure 2.18.) These observations could not be reconciled with Ptolemy\u2019s model, in which Venus circled\nabout Earth. In Ptolemy\u2019s model, Venus could also show phases, but they were the wrong phases in the wrong\norder from what Galileo observed.\nGalileo also observed the Moon and saw craters, mountain ranges, valleys, and flat, dark areas that he thought\nmight be water. These discoveries showed that the Moon might be not so dissimilar to Earth\u2014suggesting that\nEarth, too, could belong to the realm of celestial bodies.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nFor more information about the life and work of Galileo, see theGalileo Project(https://openstax.org/l/\n30GalProj)at Rice University. 56 2 \u2022 Observing the Sky: The Birth of Astronomy\nAfter Galileo\u2019s work, it became increasingly difficult to deny the Copernican view, and Earth was slowly\ndethroned from its central position in the universe and given its rightful place as one of the planets attending\nthe Sun. Initially, however, Galileo met with a great deal of opposition. The Roman Catholic Church, still reeling\nfrom the Protestant Reformation, was looking to assert its authority and chose to make an example of Galileo.\nHe had to appear before the Inquisition to answer charges that his work was heretical, and he was ultimately\ncondemned to house arrest. His books were on the Church\u2019s forbidden list until 1836, although in countries\nwhere the Roman Catholic Church held less sway, they were widely read and discussed. Not until 1992 did the\nCatholic Church admit publicly that it had erred in the matter of censoring Galileo\u2019s ideas.\nThe new ideas ofCopernicusandGalileobegan a revolution in our conception of the cosmos. It eventually\nbecame evident that the universe is a vast place and that Earth\u2019s role in it is relatively unimportant. The idea\nthat Earth moves around the Sun like the other planets raised the possibility that they might be worlds\nthemselves, perhaps even supporting life. As Earth was demoted from its position at the center of the\nuniverse, so, too, was humanity. The universe, despite what we may wish, does not revolve around us.\nMost of us take these things for granted today, but four centuries ago such concepts were frightening and\nheretical for some, immensely stimulating for others. The pioneers of the Renaissance started the European\nworld along the path toward science and technology that we still tread today. For them, nature was rational\nand ultimately knowable, and experiments and observations provided the means to reveal its secrets.\nSEEING FOR YOURSELF\nObserving the Planets\nAt most any time of the night, and at any season, you can spot one or more bright planets in the sky. All five\nof the planets known to the ancients\u2014Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn\u2014are more prominent than\nany but the brightest stars, and they can be seen even from urban locations if you know where and when to\nlook. One way to tell planets from bright stars is that planets twinkle less.\nVenus, which stays close to the Sun from our perspective, appears either as an \u201cevening star\u201d in the west\nafter sunset or as a \u201cmorning star\u201d in the east before sunrise. It is the brightest object in the sky after the\nSun and Moon. It far outshines any real star, and under the most favorable circumstances, it can even cast a\nvisible shadow. Some young military recruits have tried to shoot Venus down as an approaching enemy\ncraft or UFO.\nMars, with its distinctive red color, can be nearly as bright as Venus is when close to Earth, but normally it\nremains much less conspicuous. Jupiter is most often the second-brightest planet, approximately equaling\nin brilliance the brightest stars. Saturn is dimmer, and it varies considerably in brightness, depending on\nwhether its large rings are seen nearly edge-on (faint) or more widely opened (bright).\nMercury is quite bright, but few people ever notice it because it never moves very far from the Sun (it\u2019s\nnever more than 28\u00b0 away in the sky) and is always seen against bright twilight skies.\nTrue to their name, the planets \u201cwander\u201d against the background of the \u201cfixed\u201d stars. Although their\napparent motions are complex, they reflect an underlying order upon which the heliocentric model of the\nsolar system, as described in this chapter, was based. The positions of the planets are often listed in\nnewspapers (sometimes on the weather page), and clear maps and guides to their locations can be found\neach month in such magazines asSky & TelescopeandAstronomy(available at most libraries and online).\nThere are also a number of computer programs and phone and tablet apps that allow you to display where\nthe planets are on any night.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 2 \u2022 Key Terms 57\nKey Terms\naccelerate to change velocity; to speed up, slow down, or change direction.\napparent magnitude a measure of how bright a star looks in the sky; the larger the number, the dimmer\nthe star appears to us\nastrology the pseudoscience that deals with the supposed influences on human destiny of the\nconfigurations and locations in the sky of the Sun, Moon, and planets\ncelestial equator a great circle on the celestial sphere 90\u00b0 from the celestial poles; where the celestial sphere\nintersects the plane of Earth\u2019s equator\ncelestial poles points about which the celestial sphere appears to rotate; intersections of the celestial sphere\nwith Earth\u2019s polar axis\ncelestial sphere the apparent sphere of the sky; a sphere of large radius centered on the observer;\ndirections of objects in the sky can be denoted by their position on the celestial sphere\ncircumpolar zone those portions of the celestial sphere near the celestial poles that are either always above\nor always below the horizon\ncosmology the study of the organization and evolution of the universe\necliptic the apparent annual path of the Sun on the celestial sphere\nepicycle the circular orbit of a body in the Ptolemaic system, the center of which revolves about another\ncircle (the deferent)\ngeocentric centered on Earth\nheliocentric centered on the Sun\nhorizon (astronomical) a great circle on the celestial sphere 90\u00b0 from the zenith; more popularly, the circle\naround us where the dome of the sky meets Earth\nhoroscope a chart used by astrologers that shows the positions along the zodiac and in the sky of the Sun,\nMoon, and planets at some given instant and as seen from a particular place on Earth\u2014usually\ncorresponding to the time and place of a person\u2019s birth\nparallax the apparent displacement of a nearby star that results from the motion of Earth around the Sun\nplanet today, any of the larger objects revolving about the Sun or any similar objects that orbit other stars; in\nancient times, any object that moved regularly among the fixed stars\nprecession (of Earth) the slow, conical motion of Earth\u2019s axis of rotation caused principally by the\ngravitational pull of the Moon and Sun on Earth\u2019s equatorial bulge\nretrograde motion the apparent westward motion of a planet on the celestial sphere or with respect to the\nstars\nyear the period of revolution of Earth around the Sun\nzenith the point on the celestial sphere opposite the direction of gravity; point directly above the observer\nzodiac a belt around the sky about 18\u00b0 wide centered on the ecliptic\nSummary\n2.1The Sky Above\nThe direct evidence of our senses supports a geocentric perspective, with the celestial sphere pivoting on the\ncelestial poles and rotating about a stationary Earth. We see only half of this sphere at one time, limited by the\nhorizon; the point directly overhead is our zenith. The Sun\u2019s annual path on the celestial sphere is the\necliptic\u2014a line that runs through the center of the zodiac, which is the 18-degree-wide strip of the sky within\nwhich we always find the Moon and planets. The celestial sphere is organized into 88 constellations, or sectors.\n2.2Ancient Astronomy\nAncient Greeks such as Aristotle recognized that Earth and the Moon are spheres, and understood the phases\nof the Moon, but because of their inability to detect stellar parallax, they rejected the idea that Earth moves.\nEratosthenes measured the size of Earth with surprising precision. Hipparchus carried out many astronomical 58 2 \u2022 For Further Exploration\nobservations, making a star catalog, defining the system of stellar magnitudes, and discovering precession\nfrom the apparent shift in the position of the north celestial pole. Ptolemy of Alexandria summarized classic\nastronomy in hisAlmagest; he explained planetary motions, including retrograde motion, with remarkably\ngood accuracy using a model centered on Earth. This geocentric model, based on combinations of uniform\ncircular motion using epicycles, was accepted as authority for more than a thousand years.\n2.3Astrology and Astronomy\nThe ancient religion of astrology, with its main contribution to civilization a heightened interest in the heavens,\nbegan in Babylonia. It reached its peak in the Greco-Roman world, especially as recorded in theTetrabiblosof\nPtolemy. Natal astrology is based on the assumption that the positions of the planets at the time of our birth,\nas described by a horoscope, determine our future. However, modern tests clearly show that there is no\nevidence for this, even in a broad statistical sense, and there is no verifiable theory to explain what might\ncause such an astrological influence.\n2.4The Birth of Modern Astronomy\nNicolaus Copernicus introduced the heliocentric cosmology to Renaissance Europe in his bookDe\nRevolutionibus. Although he retained the Aristotelian idea of uniform circular motion, Copernicus suggested\nthat Earth is a planet and that the planets all circle about the Sun, dethroning Earth from its position at the\ncenter of the universe. Galileo was the father of both modern experimental physics and telescopic astronomy.\nHe studied the acceleration of moving objects and, in 1610, began telescopic observations, discovering the\nnature of the Milky Way, the large-scale features of the Moon, the phases of Venus, and four moons of Jupiter.\nAlthough he was accused of heresy for his support of heliocentric cosmology, Galileo is credited with\nobservations and brilliant writings that convinced most of his scientific contemporaries of the reality of the\nCopernican theory.\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nAncient Astronomy\nGingerich, O. \u201cFrom Aristarchus to Copernicus.\u201dSky & Telescope(November 1983): 410.\nGingerich, O. \u201cIslamic Astronomy.\u201dScientific American(April 1986): 74.\nAstronomy and Astrology\nFraknoi, A. \u201cYour Astrology Defense Kit.\u201dSky & Telescope(August 1989): 146.\nCopernicus and Galileo\nGingerich, O. \u201cGalileo and the Phases of Venus.\u201dSky & Telescope(December 1984): 520.\nGingerich, O. \u201cHow Galileo Changed the Rules of Science.\u201dSky & Telescope(March 1993): 32.\nMaran, S., and Marschall, L. \u201cThe Moon, the Telescope, and the Birth of the Modern World.\u201dSky & Telescope\n(February 2009): 28.\nSobel, D. \u201cThe Heretic\u2019s Daughter: A Startling Correspondence Reveals a New Portrait of Galileo.\u201dThe New\nYorker(September 13, 1999): 52.\nWebsites\nAncient Astronomy\nAristarchos of Samos:http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/JRASC/0075//0000029.000.html\n(http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/JRASC/0075//0000029.000.html).

This was the problem confronting\nastronomers during the nineteenth century as they tried to pin down a full inventory of our solar system.\nIf we could look down on the solar system from somewhere out in space, interpreting planetary motions\nwould be much simpler. But the fact is, we must observe the positions of all the other planets from our own\nmoving planet. Scientists of the Renaissance did not know the details of Earth\u2019s motions any better than the\nmotions of the other planets. Their problem, as we saw inObserving the Sky: The Birth of Astronomy, was that\nthey had to deduce the nature of all planetary motion using only their earthbound observations of the other\nplanets\u2019 positions in the sky. To solve this complex problem more fully, better observations and better models\nof the planetary system were needed. 64 3 \u2022 Orbits and Gravity\n3.1 The Laws of Planetary Motion\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe how Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler contributed to our understanding of how planets move\naround the Sun\nExplain Kepler\u2019s three laws of planetary motion\nAt about the time thatGalileowas beginning his experiments with falling bodies, the efforts of two other\nscientists dramatically advanced our understanding of the motions of the planets. These two astronomers\nwere the observer Tycho Brahe and the mathematician Johannes Kepler. Together, they placed the\nspeculations of Copernicus on a sound mathematical basis and paved the way for the work of Isaac Newton in\nthe next century.\nTycho Brahe\u2019s Observatory\nThree years after the publication of Copernicus\u2019De Revolutionibus, TychoBrahewas born to a family of Danish\nnobility. He developed an early interest in astronomy and, as a young man, made significant astronomical\nobservations. Among these was a careful study of what we now know was an exploding star that flared up to\ngreat brilliance in the night sky. His growing reputation gained him the patronage of the Danish King Frederick\nII, and at the age of 30, Brahe was able to establish a fine astronomical observatory on the North Sea island of\nHven (Figure 3.2). Brahe was the last and greatest of the pre-telescopic observers in Europe.\nFigure3.2Tycho Brahe (1546\u20131601) and Johannes Kepler (1571\u20131630).(a) A stylized engraving shows Tycho Brahe using his\ninstruments to measure the altitude of celestial objects above the horizon. The large curved instrument in the foreground allowed\nhim to measure precise angles in the sky. Note that the scene includes hints of the grandeur of Brahe\u2019s observatory at Hven. (b)\nKepler was a German mathematician and astronomer. His discovery of the basic laws that describe planetary motion placed the\nheliocentric cosmology of Copernicus on a firm mathematical basis.\nAt Hven, Brahe made a continuous record of the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets for almost 20 years.\nHis extensive and precise observations enabled him to note that the positions of the planets varied from those\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.1 \u2022 The Laws of Planetary Motion 65\ngiven in published tables, which were based on the work of Ptolemy. These data were extremely valuable, but\nBrahe didn\u2019t have the ability to analyze them and develop a better model than what Ptolemy had published.\nHe was further inhibited because he was an extravagant and cantankerous fellow, and he accumulated\nenemies among government officials. When his patron, Frederick II, died in 1597, Brahe lost his political base\nand decided to leave Denmark. He took up residence in Prague, where he became court astronomer to\nEmperor Rudolf of Bohemia. There, in the year before his death, Brahe found a most able young\nmathematician, Johannes Kepler, to assist him in analyzing his extensive planetary data.\nJohannes Kepler\nJohannesKeplerwas born into a poor family in the German province of W\u00fcrttemberg and lived much of his life\namid the turmoil of the Thirty Years\u2019 War (seeFigure 3.2). He attended university at Tubingen and studied for a\ntheological career. There, he learned the principles of the Copernican system and became converted to the\nheliocentric hypothesis. Eventually, Kepler went to Prague to serve as an assistant to Brahe, who set him to\nwork trying to find a satisfactory theory of planetary motion\u2014one that was compatible with the long series of\nobservations made at Hven. Brahe was reluctant to provide Kepler with much material at any one time for fear\nthat Kepler would discover the secrets of the universal motion by himself, thereby robbing Brahe of some of\nthe glory. Only after Brahe\u2019s death in 1601 did Kepler get full possession of the priceless records. Their study\noccupied most of Kepler\u2019s time for more than 20 years.\nThrough his analysis of the motions of the planets, Kepler developed a series of principles, now known as\nKepler\u2019s three laws,which described the behavior of planets based on their paths through space. The first two\nlaws of planetary motion were published in 1609 inThe New Astronomy. Their discovery was a profound step\nin the development of modern science.\nThe First Two Laws of Planetary Motion\nThe path of an object through space is called itsorbit. Kepler initially assumed that the orbits of planets were\ncircles, but doing so did not allow him to find orbits that were consistent with Brahe\u2019s observations. Working\nwith the data for Mars, he eventually discovered that the orbit of that planet had the shape of a somewhat\nflattened circle, orellipse. Next to the circle, the ellipse is the simplest kind of closed curve, belonging to a\nfamily of curves known asconic sections(Figure 3.3).\nFigure3.3Conic Sections.The circle, ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola are all formed by the intersection of a plane with a cone. This\nis why such curves are called conic sections.\nYou might recall from math classes that in a circle, the center is a special point. The distance from the center to\nanywhere on the circle is exactly the same. In an ellipse, the sum of the distance from two special points inside\nthe ellipse to any point on the ellipse is always the same. These two points inside the ellipse are called its foci\n(singular:focus), a word invented for this purpose by Kepler.\nThis property suggests a simple way to draw an ellipse (Figure 3.4). We wrap the ends of a loop of string 66 3 \u2022 Orbits and Gravity\naround two tacks pushed through a sheet of paper into a drawing board, so that the string is slack. If we push\na pencil against the string, making the string taut, and then slide the pencil against the string all around the\ntacks, the curve that results is an ellipse. At any point where the pencil may be, the sum of the distances from\nthe pencil to the two tacks is a constant length\u2014the length of the string. The tacks are at the two foci of the\nellipse.\nThe widest diameter of the ellipse is called itsmajor axis. Half this distance\u2014that is, the distance from the\ncenter of the ellipse to one end\u2014is thesemimajor axis, which is usually used to specify the size of the ellipse.\nFor example, the semimajor axis of the orbit of Mars, which is also the planet\u2019s average distance from the Sun,\nis 228 million kilometers.\nFigure3.4Drawing an Ellipse.(a) We can construct an ellipse by pushing two tacks (the white objects) into a piece of paper on a\ndrawing board, and then looping a string around the tacks. Each tack represents a focus of the ellipse, with one of the tacks being\nthe Sun. Stretch the string tight using a pencil, and then move the pencil around the tacks. The length of the string remains the\nsame, so that the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the foci is always constant. (b) In this illustration, each\nsemimajor axis is denoted bya. The distance 2ais called the major axis of the ellipse.\nThe shape (roundness) of an ellipse depends on how close together the two foci are, compared with the major\naxis. The ratio of the distance between the foci to the length of the major axis is called theeccentricityof the\nellipse.\nIf the foci (or tacks) are moved to the same location, then the distance between the foci would be zero. This\nmeans that the eccentricity is zero and the ellipse is just a circle; thus, a circle can be called an ellipse of zero\neccentricity. In a circle, the semimajor axis would be the radius.\nNext, we can make ellipses of various elongations (or extended lengths) by varying the spacing of the tacks (as\nlong as they are not farther apart than the length of the string). The greater the eccentricity, the more\nelongated is the ellipse, up to a maximum eccentricity of 1.0, when the ellipse becomes \u201cflat,\u201d the other\nextreme from a circle.\nThe size and shape of an ellipse are completely specified by its semimajor axis and its eccentricity. Using\nBrahe\u2019s data, Kepler found thatMarshas an elliptical orbit, with the Sun at one focus (the other focus is\nempty). The eccentricity of the orbit of Mars is only about 0.1; its orbit, drawn to scale, would be practically\nindistinguishable from a circle, but the difference turned out to be critical for understanding planetary\nmotions.\nKeplergeneralized this result in his first law and said thatthe orbits of all the planets are ellipses. Here was a\ndecisive moment in the history of human thought: it was not necessary to have only circles in order to have an\nacceptable cosmos. The universe could be a bit more complex than the Greek philosophers had wanted it to\nbe.\nKepler\u2019s second law deals with the speed with which each planet moves along its ellipse, also known as its\norbital speed. Working with Brahe\u2019s observations of Mars, Kepler discovered that the planet speeds up as it\ncomes closer to the Sun and slows down as it pulls away from the Sun. He expressed the precise form of this\nrelationship by imagining that the Sun and Mars are connected by a straight, elastic line. When Mars is closer\nto the Sun (positions 1 and 2 inFigure 3.5), the elastic line is not stretched as much, and the planet moves\nrapidly. Farther from the Sun, as in positions 3 and 4, the line is stretched a lot, and the planet does not move\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.1 \u2022 The Laws of Planetary Motion 67\nso fast. As Mars travels in its elliptical orbit around the Sun, the elastic line sweeps out areas of the ellipse as it\nmoves (the colored regions in our figure). Kepler found that in equal intervals of time (t), the areas swept out\nin space by this imaginary line are always equal; that is, the area of the region B from 1 to 2 is the same as that\nof region A from 3 to 4.\nIf a planet moves in a circular orbit, the elastic line is always stretched the same amount and the planet moves\nat a constant speed around its orbit. But, as Kepler discovered, in most orbits that speed of a planet orbiting its\nstar (or moon orbiting its planet) tends to vary because the orbit is elliptical.\nFigure3.5Kepler\u2019s Second Law: The Law of Equal Areas.The orbital speed of a planet traveling around the Sun (the circular object\ninside the ellipse) varies in such a way that in equal intervals of time (t), a line between the Sun and a planet sweeps out equal areas\n(A and B). Note that the eccentricities of the planets\u2019 orbits in our solar system are substantially less than shown here.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTheKepler's Second Law demonstrator(https://openstax.org/l/30kepsecond)from CCNY's ScienceSims\nproject shows how an orbiting planet sweeps out the same area in the same time.\nKepler\u2019s Third Law\nKepler\u2019s first two laws of planetary motion describe the shape of a planet\u2019s orbit and allow us to calculate the\nspeed of its motion at any point in the orbit. Kepler was pleased to have discovered such fundamental rules,\nbut they did not satisfy his quest to fully understand planetary motions. He wanted to know why the orbits of\nthe planets were spaced as they are and to find a mathematical pattern in their movements\u2014a \u201charmony of\nthe spheres\u201d as he called it. For many years he worked to discover mathematical relationships governing\nplanetary spacing and the time each planet took to go around the Sun.\nIn 1619,Keplerdiscovered a basic relationship to relate the planets\u2019 orbits to their relative distances from the\nSun. We define a planet\u2019sorbital period, (P), as the time it takes a planet to travel once around the Sun. Also,\nrecall that a planet\u2019s semimajor axis,a,is equal to its average distance from the Sun. The relationship, now\nknown asKepler\u2019s third law, says that a planet\u2019s orbital period squared is proportional to the semimajor axis\nof its orbit cubed, or\nWhenP(the orbital period) is measured in years, andais expressed in a quantity known as anastronomical\nunit (AU), the two sides of the formula are not only proportional but equal. One AU is the average distance\nbetween Earth and the Sun and is approximately equal to 1.5 \u00d7 108kilometers. In these units, 68 3 \u2022 Orbits and Gravity\nKepler\u2019s third law applies to all objects orbiting the Sun, including Earth, and provides a means for calculating\ntheir relative distances from the Sun from the time they take to orbit. Let\u2019s look at a specific example to\nillustrate how useful Kepler\u2019s third law is.\nFor instance, suppose you time how long Mars takes to go around the Sun (in Earth years). Kepler\u2019s third law\ncan then be used to calculate Mars\u2019 average distance from the Sun. Mars\u2019 orbital period (1.88 Earth years)\nsquared, orP2, is 1.882= 3.53, and according to the equation for Kepler\u2019s third law, this equals the cube of its\nsemimajor axis, ora3. So what number must be cubed to give 3.53? The answer is 1.52 (since 1.52 \u00d7 1.52 \u00d7 1.52\n= 3.53). Thus, Mars\u2019 semimajor axis in astronomical units must be 1.52 AU. In other words, to go around the\nSun in a little less than two years, Mars must be about 50% (half again) as far from the Sun as Earth is.\nEXAMPLE 3.1\nCalculating Periods\nImagine an object is traveling around the Sun. What would be the orbital period of the object if its orbit has\na semimajor axis of 50 AU?\nSolution\nFrom Kepler\u2019s third law, we know that (when we use units of years and AU)\nIf the object\u2019s orbit has a semimajor axis of 50 AU (a= 50), we can cube 50 and then take the square root of\nthe result to get P:\nTherefore, the orbital period of the object is about 350 years. This would place our hypothetical object\nbeyond the orbit of Pluto.\nCheck Your Learning\nWhat would be the orbital period of an asteroid (a rocky chunk between Mars and Jupiter) with a semimajor\naxis of 3 AU?\nAnswer:\nKepler\u2019s three laws of planetary motion can be summarized as follows:\n\u2022 Kepler\u2019s first law: Each planet moves around the Sun in an orbit that is an ellipse, with the Sun at one\nfocus of the ellipse.\n\u2022 Kepler\u2019s second law: The straight line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in space in\nequal intervals of time.\n\u2022 Kepler\u2019s third law: The square of a planet\u2019s orbital period is directly proportional to the cube of the\nsemimajor axis of its orbit.\nKepler\u2019s three laws provide a precise geometric description of planetary motion within the framework of the\nCopernican system. With these tools, it was possible to calculate planetary positions with greatly improved\nprecision. Still, Kepler\u2019s laws are purely descriptive: they do not help us understand what forces of nature\nconstrain the planets to follow this particular set of rules. That step was left to Isaac Newton.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.2 \u2022 Newton\u2019s Great Synthesis 69\nEXAMPLE 3.2\nApplying Kepler\u2019s Third Law\nUsing the orbital periods and semimajor axes for Venus and Earth that are provided here, calculateP2and\na3, and verify that they obeyKepler\u2019s third law. Venus\u2019 orbital period is 0.62 year, and its semimajor axis is\n0.72 AU. Earth\u2019s orbital period is 1.00 year, and its semimajor axis is 1.00 AU.\nSolution\nWe can use the equation for Kepler\u2019s third law,P2 \u221da3. For Venus,P2= 0.62 \u00d7 0.62 = 0.38 anda3= 0.72 \u00d7 0.72\n\u00d7 0.72 = 0.37 (rounding numbers sometimes causes minor discrepancies like this). The square of the orbital\nperiod (0.38) approximates the cube of the semimajor axis (0.37). Therefore, Venus obeys Kepler\u2019s third law.\nFor Earth,P2= 1.00 \u00d7 1.00 = 1.00 anda3= 1.00 \u00d7 1.00 \u00d7 1.00 = 1.00. The square of the orbital period (1.00)\napproximates (in this case, equals) the cube of the semimajor axis (1.00). Therefore, Earth obeys Kepler\u2019s\nthird law.\nCheck Your Learning\nUsing the orbital periods and semimajor axes for Saturn and Jupiter that are provided here, calculateP2and\na3, and verify that they obey Kepler\u2019s third law.

Jupiter\u2019s orbital period is 11.86 years, and its semimajor axis is 5.20 AU.\nAnswer:\nFor Saturn,P2= 29.46 \u00d7 29.46 = 867.9 anda3= 9.54 \u00d7 9.54 \u00d7 9.54 = 868.3. The square of the orbital period\n(867.9) approximates the cube of the semimajor axis (868.3).

Newton was born in Lincolnshire,\nEngland, in the year after Galileo\u2019s death (Figure 3.6). Against the advice of his mother, who wanted him to\nstay home and help with the family farm, he entered Trinity College at Cambridge in 1661 and eight years later\nwas appointed professor of mathematics. Among Newton\u2019s contemporaries in England were architect\nChristopher Wren, authors Aphra Behn and Daniel Defoe, and composer G. F. Handel. 70 3 \u2022 Orbits and Gravity\nFigure3.6Isaac Newton (1643\u20131727), 1689 Portrait by Sir Godfrey Kneller.Isaac Newton\u2019s work on the laws of motion, gravity,\noptics, and mathematics laid the foundations for much of physical science.\nNewton\u2019s Laws of Motion\nAs a young man in college, Newton became interested in natural philosophy, as science was then called. He\nworked out some of his first ideas on machines and optics during the plague years of 1665 and 1666, when\nstudents were sent home from college. Newton, a moody and often difficult man, continued to work on his\nideas in private, even inventing new mathematical tools to help him deal with the complexities involved.\nEventually, his friend EdmundHalley(profiled inComets and Asteroids: Debris of the Solar System) prevailed\non him to collect and publish the results of his remarkable investigations on motion and gravity. The result\nwas a volume that set out the underlying system of the physical world,Philosophiae Naturalis Principia\nMathematica. ThePrincipia, as the book is generally known, was published at Halley\u2019s expense in 1687.\nAt the very beginning of thePrincipia, Newton proposes three laws that would govern the motions of all\nobjects:\n\u2022 Newton\u2019s first law: Every object will continue to be in a state of rest or move at a constant speed in a\nstraight line unless it is compelled to change by an outside force.\n\u2022 Newton\u2019s second law: The change of motion of a body is proportional to and in the direction of the force\nacting on it.\n\u2022 Newton\u2019s third law: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction (or:the mutual actions of\ntwo bodies upon each other are always equal and act in opposite directions).\nIn the original Latin, the three laws contain only 59 words, but those few words set the stage for modern\nscience. Let us examine them more carefully.\nInterpretation of Newton\u2019s Laws\nNewton\u2019s first law is a restatement of one of Galileo\u2019s discoveries, called theconservation of momentum. The\nlaw states that in the absence of any outside influence, there is a measure of a body\u2019s motion, called its\nmomentum, that remains unchanged. You may have heard the term momentum used in everyday\nexpressions, such as \u201cThis bill in Congress has a lot of momentum; it\u2019s going to be hard to stop.\u201d\nNewton\u2019s first law is sometimes called thelaw of inertia, where inertia is the tendency of objects (and\nlegislatures) to keep doing what they are already doing. In other words, a stationary object stays put, and a\nmoving object keeps moving unless some force intervenes.\nLet\u2019s define the precise meaning of momentum\u2014it depends on three factors: (1) speed\u2014how fast a body\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.2 \u2022 Newton\u2019s Great Synthesis 71\nmoves (zero if it is stationary), (2) the direction of its motion, and (3) its mass\u2014a measure of the amount of\nmatter in a body, which we will discuss later. Scientists use the termvelocityto describe the speed and\ndirection of motion. For example, 20 kilometers per hour due south is velocity, whereas 20 kilometers per hour\njust by itself is speed. Momentum then can be defined as an object\u2019s mass times its velocity.\nIt\u2019s not so easy to see this rule in action in the everyday world because of the many forces acting on a body at\nany one time. One important force is friction, which generally slows things down. If you roll a ball along the\nsidewalk, it eventually comes to a stop because the sidewalk exerts a rubbing force on the ball. But in the\nspace between the stars, where there is so little matter that friction is insignificant, objects can in fact continue\nto move (to coast) indefinitely.\nThe momentum of a body can change only under the action of an outside influence. Newton\u2019s second law\nexpressesforcein terms of its ability to change momentum with time. A force (a push or a pull) has both size\nand direction. When a force is applied to a body, the momentum changes in the direction of the applied force.\nThis means that a force is required to change either the speed or the direction of a body, or both\u2014that is, to\nstart it moving, to speed it up, to slow it down, to stop it, or to change its direction.\nAs you learned inObserving the Sky: The Birth of Astronomy, the rate of change in an object\u2019s velocity is called\nacceleration. Newton showed that the acceleration of a body was proportional to the force being applied to it.\nSuppose that after a long period of reading, you push an astronomy book away from you on a long, smooth\ntable. (We use a smooth table so we can ignore friction.) If you push the book steadily, it will continue to speed\nup as long as you are pushing it. The harder you push the book, the larger its acceleration will be. How much a\nforce will accelerate an object is also determined by the object\u2019s mass. If you kept pushing a pen with the same\nforce with which you pushed the textbook, the pen\u2014having less mass\u2014would be accelerated to a greater\nspeed.\nNewton\u2019s third law is perhaps the most profound of the rules he discovered. Basically, it is a generalization of\nthe first law, but it also gives us a way to define mass. If we consider a system of two or more objects isolated\nfrom outside influences, Newton\u2019s first law says that the total momentum of the objects should remain\nconstant. Therefore, any change of momentum within the system must be balanced by another change that is\nequal and opposite so that the momentum of the entire system is not changed.\nThis means that forces in nature do not occur alone: we find that in each situation there is always apairof\nforces that are equal to and opposite each other. If a force is exerted on an object, it must be exerted by\nsomething else, and the object will exert an equal and opposite force back on that something. We can look at a\nsimple example to demonstrate this.\nSuppose that a daredevil astronomy student\u2014and avid skateboarder\u2014wants to jump from his second-story\ndorm window onto his board below (we don\u2019t recommend trying this!). The force pulling him down after\njumping (as we will see in the next section) is the force of gravity between him and Earth. Both he and Earth\nmust experience the same total change of momentum because of the influence of these mutual forces. So,\nboth the student and Earth are accelerated by each other\u2019s pull. However, the student does much more of the\nmoving. Because Earth has enormously greater mass, it can experience the same change of momentum by\naccelerating only a very small amount. Things fall toward Earth all the time, but the acceleration of our planet\nas a result is far too small to be measured.\nA more obvious example of the mutual nature of forces between objects is familiar to all who have batted a\nbaseball. The recoil you feel as you swing your bat shows that the ball exerts a force on it during the impact,\njust as the bat does on the ball. Similarly, when a rifle you are bracing on your shoulder is discharged, the\nforce pushing the bullet out of the muzzle is equal to the force pushing backward upon the gun and your\nshoulder.\nThis is the principle behind jet engines and rockets: the force that discharges the exhaust gases from the rear\nof the rocket is accompanied by the force that pushes the rocket forward. The exhaust gases need not push 72 3 \u2022 Orbits and Gravity\nagainst air or Earth; a rocket actually operates best in a vacuum (Figure 3.7).\nFigure3.7Demonstrating Newton\u2019s Third Law.The U.S. Space Shuttle (here launchingDiscovery), powered by three fuel engines\nburning liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, with two solid fuel boosters, demonstrates Newton\u2019s third law.

We begin withmass,which is a measure of the amount of material within an\nobject.\nThevolumeof an object is the measure of the physical space it occupies. Volume is measured in cubic units,\nsuch as cubic centimeters or liters. Thevolumeis the \u201csize\u201d of an object. A penny and an inflated balloon may\nboth have the samemass, but they have very different volumes. The reason is that they also have very\ndifferentdensities, which is a measure of how much mass there is per unit volume. Specifically,densityis the\nmass divided by the volume. Note that in everyday language we often use \u201cheavy\u201d and \u201clight\u201d as indications of\ndensity (rather than weight) as, for instance, when we say that iron is heavy or that whipped cream is light.\n(g/cm3).1\nThe units of density that will be used in this book are grams per cubic centimeter If a block of some\nmaterial has a mass of 300 grams and a volume of 100 cm3, its density is 3 g/cm3. Familiar materials span a\nconsiderable range in density, from artificial materials such as plastic insulating foam (less than 0.1 g/cm3) to\ngold (19.3 g/cm3).Table 3.1gives the densities of some familiar materials. In the astronomical universe, much\nmore remarkable densities can be found, all the way from a comet\u2019s tail (10\u201316g/cm3) to a collapsed \u201cstar\ncorpse\u201d called a neutron star (1015g/cm3).\n1 Generally we use standard metric (or SI) units in this book. The proper metric unit of density in that system is kg/m3. But to most\npeople, g/cm3provides a more meaningful unit because the density of water is exactly 1 g/cm3, and this is useful information for\ncomparison. Density expressed in g/cm3is sometimes called specific density or specific weight.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.2 \u2022 Newton\u2019s Great Synthesis 73\nDensities of Common Materials\nMaterial Density (g/cm3)\nGold 19.3\nLead 11.3\nIron 7.9\nEarth (bulk) 5.5\nRock (typical) 2.5\nWater 1\nWood (typical) 0.8\nInsulating foam 0.1\nSilica gel 0.02\nTable3.1\nTo sum up, mass ishow much, volume ishow big, and density ishow tightly packed.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nYou can play with asimple animation(https://openstax.org/l/30phetsimdenmas)demonstrating the\nrelationship between the concepts of density, mass, and volume, and find out why objects like wood float in\nwater.\nAngular Momentum\nA concept that is a bit more complex, but important for understanding many astronomical objects, isangular\nmomentum, which is a measure of the rotation of a body as it revolves around some fixed point (an example\nis a planet orbiting the Sun). The angular momentum of an object is defined as the product of its mass, its\nvelocity, and its distance from the fixed point around which it revolves.\nIf these three quantities remain constant\u2014that is, if the motion of a particular object takes place at a constant\nvelocity at a fixed distance from the spin center\u2014then the angular momentum is also a constant. Kepler\u2019s\nsecond law is a consequence of theconservation of angular momentum. As a planet approaches the Sun on its\nelliptical orbit and the distance to the spin center decreases, the planet speeds up to conserve the angular\nmomentum. Similarly, when the planet is farther from the Sun, it moves more slowly.\nTheconservation of angular momentumis illustrated by figure skaters, who bring their arms and legs in to\nspin more rapidly, and extend their arms and legs to slow down (Figure 3.8). You can duplicate this yourself on\na well-oiled swivel stool by starting yourself spinning slowly with your arms extended and then pulling your\narms in. Another example of the conservation of angular momentum is a shrinking cloud of dust or a star 74 3 \u2022 Orbits and Gravity\ncollapsing on itself (both are situations that you will learn about as you read on). As material moves to a lesser\ndistance from the spin center, the speed of the material increases to conserve angular momentum.\nFigure3.8Conservation of Angular Momentum.When a spinning figure skater brings in her arms, their distance from her spin\ncenter is smaller, so her speed increases. When her arms are out, their distance from the spin center is greater, so she slows down.\n3.3 Newton\u2019s Universal Law of Gravitation\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain what determines the strength of gravity\nDescribe how Newton\u2019s universal law of gravitation extends our understanding of Kepler\u2019s laws\nNewton\u2019s laws of motion show that objects at rest will stay at rest and those in motion will continue moving\nuniformly in a straight line unless acted upon by a force. Thus, it is thestraight linethat defines the most\nnatural state of motion. But the planets move in ellipses, not straight lines; therefore, some force must be\nbending their paths. That force, Newton proposed, wasgravity.\nIn Newton\u2019s time, gravity was something associated with Earth alone. Everyday experience shows us that\nEarth exerts a gravitational force upon objects at its surface. If you drop something, it accelerates toward Earth\nas it falls. Newton\u2019s insight was that Earth\u2019s gravity might extend as far as the Moon and produce the force\nrequired to curve the Moon\u2019s path from a straight line and keep it in its orbit. He further hypothesized that\ngravity is not limited to Earth, but that there is a general force of attraction between all material bodies. If so,\nthe attractive force between the Sun and each of the planets could keep them in their orbits. (This may seem\npart of our everyday thinking today, but it was a remarkable insight in Newton\u2019s time.)\nOnceNewtonboldly hypothesized that there was a universal attraction among all bodies everywhere in space,\nhe had to determine the exact nature of the attraction. The precise mathematical description of that\ngravitational force had to dictate that the planets move exactly as Kepler had described them to (as expressed\nin Kepler\u2019s three laws). Also, that gravitational force had to predict the correct behavior of falling bodies on\nEarth, as observed by Galileo. How must the force of gravity depend on distance in order for these conditions\nto be met?\nThe answer to this question required mathematical tools that had not yet been developed, but this did not\ndeter Isaac Newton, who invented what we today call calculus to deal with this problem. Eventually he was\nable to conclude that the magnitude of the force of gravity must decrease with increasing distance between\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.3 \u2022 Newton\u2019s Universal Law of Gravitation 75\nthe Sun and a planet (or between any two objects) in proportion to the inverse square of their separation. In\nother words, if a planet were twice as far from the Sun, the force would be (1/2)2, or 1/4 as large. Put the\nplanet three times farther away, and the force is (1/3)2, or 1/9 as large.\nNewton also concluded that the gravitational attraction between two bodies must be proportional to their\nmasses. The more mass an object has, the stronger the pull of its gravitational force. The gravitational\nattraction between any two objects is therefore given by one of the most famous equations in all of science:\nwhereF is the gravitational force between two objects,M andM are the masses of the two objects, and\ngravity 1 2\nRis their separation.Gis a constant number known as theuniversal gravitational constant, and the equation\nitself symbolically summarizes Newton\u2019suniversal law of gravitation. With such a force and the laws of motion,\nNewton was able to show mathematically that the only orbits permitted were exactly those described by\nKepler\u2019s laws.\nNewton\u2019suniversal law of gravitationworks for the planets, but is it really universal? The gravitational theory\nshould also predict the observed acceleration of the Moon toward Earth as it orbits Earth, as well as of any\nobject (say, an apple) dropped near Earth\u2019s surface. The falling of an apple is something we can measure quite\neasily, but can we use it to predict the motions of the Moon?\nRecall that according to Newton\u2019s second law, forces cause acceleration. Newton\u2019s universal law of gravitation\nsays that the force acting upon (and therefore the acceleration of) an object toward Earth should be inversely\nproportional to the square of its distance from the center of Earth. Objects like apples at the surface of Earth,\nat a distance of one Earth-radius from the center of Earth, are observed to accelerate downward at 9.8 meters\nper second per second (9.8 m/s2).\nIt is this force of gravity on the surface of Earth that gives us our sense ofweight.Unlike your mass, which\nwould remain the same on any planet or moon, your weight depends on the local force of gravity. So you\nwould weigh less on Mars and the Moon than on Earth, even though there is no change in your mass. (Which\nmeans you would still have to go easy on the desserts in the college cafeteria when you got back!)\nThe Moon is 60 Earth radii away from the center of Earth. If gravity (and the acceleration it causes) gets weaker\nwith distance squared, the acceleration the Moon experiences should be a lot less than for the apple. The\nacceleration should be (1/60)2= 1/3600 (or 3600 times less\u2014about 0.00272 m/s2). This is precisely the\nobserved acceleration of the Moon in its orbit. (As we shall see, the Moon does not falltoEarth with this\nacceleration, but fallsaroundEarth.) Imagine the thrill Newton must have felt to realize he had discovered,\nand verified, a law that holds for Earth, apples, the Moon, and, as far as he knew, everything in the universe.\nEXAMPLE 3.3\nCalculating Weight\nBy what factor would a person\u2019s weight at the surface of Earth change if Earth had its present mass but\neight times its present volume?\nSolution\nWith eight times the volume, Earth\u2019s radius would double. This means the gravitational force at the surface\nwould reduce by a factor of (1/2)2= 1/4, so a person would weigh only one-fourth as much.\nCheck Your Learning\nBy what factor would a person\u2019s weight at the surface of Earth change if Earth had its present size but only\none-third its present mass? 76 3 \u2022 Orbits and Gravity\nAnswer:\nWith one-third its present mass, the gravitational force at the surface would reduce by a factor of 1/3, so a\nperson would weight only one-third as much.\nGravity is a \u201cbuilt-in\u201d property of mass. Whenever there are masses in the universe, they will interact via the\nforce of gravitational attraction. The more mass there is, the greater the force of attraction. Here on Earth, the\nlargest concentration of mass is, of course, the planet we stand on, and its pull dominates the gravitational\ninteractions we experience. But everything with mass attracts everything else with mass anywhere in the\nuniverse.\nNewton\u2019s law also implies that gravity never becomes zero. It quickly gets weaker with distance, but it\ncontinues to act to some degree no matter how far away you get. The pull of the Sun is stronger at Mercury\nthan at Pluto, but it can be felt far beyond Pluto, where astronomers have good evidence that it continuously\nmakes enormous numbers of smaller icy bodies move around huge orbits. And the Sun\u2019s gravitational pull\njoins with the pull of billions of others stars to create the gravitational pull of our Milky Way Galaxy. That force,\nin turn, can make other smaller galaxies orbit around the Milky Way, and so on.\nWhy is it then, you may ask, that the astronauts aboard the Space Shuttle appear to have no gravitational\nforces acting on them when we see images on television of the astronauts and objects floating in the\nspacecraft? After all, the astronauts in the shuttle are only a few hundred kilometers above the surface of\nEarth, which is not a significant distance compared to the size of Earth, so gravity is certainly not a great deal\nweaker that much farther away. The astronauts feel \u201cweightless\u201d (meaning that they don\u2019t feel the\ngravitational force acting on them) for the same reason that passengers in an elevator whose cable has\n2\nbroken or in an airplane whose engines no longer work feel weightless: they are falling (Figure 3.9).\nFigure3.9Astronauts in Free Fall.While in space, astronauts are falling freely, so they experience \u201cweightlessness.\u201d Clockwise\nfrom top left: Tracy Caldwell Dyson (NASA), Naoko Yamazaki (JAXA), Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger (NASA), and Stephanie Wilson\n2 In the filmApollo 13, the scenes in which the astronauts were \u201cweightless\u201d were actually filmed in a falling airplane. As you might\nimagine, the plane fell for only short periods before the engines engaged again.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.3 \u2022 Newton\u2019s Universal Law of Gravitation 77\n(NASA). (credit: NASA)\nWhenfalling, they are in free fall and accelerate at the same rate as everything around them, including their\nspacecraft or a camera with which they are taking photographs of Earth. When doing so, astronauts\nexperience no additional forces and therefore feel \u201cweightless.\u201d Unlike the falling elevator passengers,\nhowever, the astronauts are fallingaroundEarth, nottoEarth; as a result they will continue to fall and are said\nto be \u201cin orbit\u201d around Earth (see the next section for more about orbits).\nOrbital Motion and Mass\nKepler\u2019s laws describe the orbits of the objects whose motions are described by Newton\u2019s laws of motion and\nthe law of gravity. Knowing that gravity is the force that attracts planets toward the Sun, however, allowed\nNewton to rethink Kepler\u2019s third law. Recall that Kepler had found a relationship between the orbital period of\na planet\u2019s revolution and its distance from the Sun. But Newton\u2019s formulation introduces the additional factor\nof the masses of the Sun (M) and the planet (M), both expressed in units of the Sun\u2019s mass. Newton\u2019s\n1 2\nuniversal law of gravitation can be used to show mathematically that this relationship is actually\nwhereais the semimajor axis andPis the orbital period.\nHow did Kepler miss this factor? In units of the Sun\u2019s mass, the mass of the Sun is 1, and in units of the Sun\u2019s\nmass, the mass of a typical planet is a negligibly small factor. This means that the sum of the Sun\u2019s mass and a\nplanet\u2019s mass, (M +M), is very, very close to 1. This makes Newton\u2019s formula appear almost the same as\n1 2\nKepler\u2019s; the tiny mass of the planets compared to the Sun is the reason that Kepler did not realize that both\nmasses had to be included in the calculation. There are many situations in astronomy, however, in which we\ndoneed to include the two mass terms\u2014for example, when two stars or two galaxies orbit each other.\nIncluding the mass term allows us to use this formula in a new way. If we can measure the motions (distances\nand orbital periods) of objects acting under their mutual gravity, then the formula will permit us to deduce\ntheir masses. For example, we can calculate the mass of the Sun by using the distances and orbital periods of\nthe planets, or the mass of Jupiter by noting the motions of its moons.\nIndeed, Newton\u2019s reformulation of Kepler\u2019s third law is one of the most powerful concepts in astronomy. Our\nability to deduce the masses of objects from their motions is key to understanding the nature and evolution of\nmany astronomical bodies. We will use this law repeatedly throughout this text in calculations that range from\nthe orbits of comets to the interactions of galaxies.\nEXAMPLE 3.4\nCalculating the Effects of Gravity\nA planet like Earth is found orbiting its star at a distance of 1 AU in 0.71 Earth-year. Can you use Newton\u2019s\nversion of Kepler\u2019s third law to find the mass of the star? (Remember that compared to the mass of a star,\nthe mass of an earthlike planet can be considered negligible.)\nSolution\nIn the formulaa3= (M +M) \u00d7P2, the factorM +M would now be approximately equal toM (the mass of\n1 2 1 2 1\nthe star), since the planet\u2019s mass is so small by comparison. Then the formula becomesa3=M \u00d7P2, and we\n1\ncan solve forM:\n1\nSincea= 1,a3= 1, so 78 3 \u2022 Orbits and Gravity\nSo the mass of the star is twice the mass of our Sun. (Remember that this way of expressing the law has\nunits in terms of Earth and the Sun, so masses are expressed in units of the mass of our Sun.)\nCheck Your Learning\nSuppose a star with twice the mass of our Sun had an earthlike planet that took 4 years to orbit the star. At\nwhat distance (semimajor axis) would this planet orbit its star?\nAnswer:\nAgain, we can neglect the mass of the planet. SoM = 2 andP= 4 years. The formula isa3=M \u00d7P2, soa3= 2\n1 1\n\u00d7 42= 2 \u00d7 16 = 32. Soais the cube root of 32. To find this, you can just ask Google, \u201cWhat is the cube root of\n32?\u201d and get the answer 3.2 AU.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nYou might like to try asimulation(https://openstax.org/l/30phetsimsunear)that lets you move the Sun,\nEarth, Moon, and space station to see the effects of changing their distances on their gravitational forces\nand orbital paths. You can even turn off gravity and see what happens.\n3.4 Orbits in the Solar System\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nCompare the orbital characteristics of the planets in the solar system\nCompare the orbital characteristics of asteroids and comets in the solar system\nRecall that the path of an object under the influence of gravity through space is called its orbit, whether that\nobject is a spacecraft, planet, star, or galaxy. An orbit, once determined, allows the future positions of the\nobject to be calculated.\nTwo points in any orbit in our solar system have been given special names. The place where the planet is\nclosest to the Sun (heliosin Greek) and moves the fastest is called theperihelionof its orbit, and the place\nwhere it is farthest away and moves the most slowly is theaphelion. For the Moon or a satellite orbiting Earth\n(geein Greek), the corresponding terms areperigeeandapogee. (In this book, we use the wordmoonfor a\nnatural object that goes around a planet and the wordsatelliteto mean a human-made object that revolves\naround a planet.)\nOrbits of the Planets\nToday, Newton\u2019s work enables us to calculate and predict the orbits of the planets with marvelous precision.\nWe know eight planets, beginning with Mercury closest to the Sun and extending outward to Neptune. The\naverage orbital data for the planets are summarized inTable 3.2. (Ceres is the largest of theasteroids,now\nconsidered a dwarf planet.)\nAccording to Kepler\u2019s laws, Mercury must have the shortest orbital period (88 Earth-days); thus, it has the\nhighest orbital speed, averaging 48 kilometers per second. At the opposite extreme, Neptune has a period of\n165 years and an average orbital speed of just 5 kilometers per second.\nAll the planets have orbits of rather low eccentricity. The most eccentric orbit is that of Mercury (0.21); the rest\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.4 \u2022 Orbits in the Solar System 79\nhave eccentricities smaller than 0.1. It is fortunate that among the rest, Mars has an eccentricity greater than\nthat of many of the other planets. Otherwise the pre-telescopic observations of Brahe would not have been\nsufficient for Kepler to deduce that its orbit had the shape of an ellipse rather than a circle.\nThe planetary orbits are also confined close to a common plane, which is near the plane of Earth\u2019s orbit (called\nthe ecliptic). The strange orbit of the dwarf planet Pluto is inclined about 17\u00b0 to the ecliptic, and that of the\ndwarf planet Eris (orbiting even farther away from the Sun than Pluto) by 44\u00b0, but all the major planets lie\nwithin 10\u00b0 of the common plane of the solar system.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nJavaLab\u2019ssolar system simulator(https://openstax.org/l/30solarsim)allows you to explore the size and\nspeed of the planets\u2019 orbits, and view the orbits from different perspectives.\nOrbits of Asteroids and Comets\nIn addition to the eight planets, there are many smaller objects in the solar system. Some of these are moons\n(natural satellites) that orbit all the planets except Mercury and Venus. In addition, there are two classes of\nsmaller objects in heliocentric orbits:asteroidsandcomets. Both asteroids and comets are believed to be\nsmall chunks of material left over from the formation process of the solar system.\nIn general, asteroids have orbits with smaller semimajor axes than do comets (Figure 3.10). The majority of\nthem lie between 2.2 and 3.3 AU, in the region known as theasteroid belt(seeComets and Asteroids: Debris\nof the Solar System). As you can see inTable 3.2, the asteroid belt (represented by its largest member, Ceres) is\nin the middle of a gap between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. It is because these two planets are so far apart\nthat stable orbits of small bodies can exist in the region between them. 80 3 \u2022 Orbits and Gravity\nFigure3.10Solar System Orbits.We see the orbits of typical comets and asteroids compared with those of the planets Mercury,\nVenus, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter (black circles).

Typically, the\neccentricity of their orbits is 0.8 or higher. According to Kepler\u2019s second law, therefore, they spend most of\ntheir time far from the Sun, moving very slowly. As they approach perihelion, the comets speed up and whip\nthrough the inner parts of their orbits more rapidly.\n3.5 Motions of Satellites and Spacecraft\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain how an object (such as a satellite) can be put into orbit around Earth\nExplain how an object (such as a planetary probe) can escape from orbit\nNewton\u2019s universal law of gravitation and Kepler\u2019s laws describe the motions of Earthsatellites and\ninterplanetary spacecraft as well as the planets. Sputnik, the first artificial Earth satellite, was launched by what\nwas then called the Soviet Union on October 4, 1957. Since that time, thousands of satellites have been placed\ninto orbit around Earth, and spacecraft have also orbited the Moon, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and a\nnumber of asteroids and comets.\nOnce an artificial satellite is in orbit, its behavior is no different from that of a natural satellite, such as our\nMoon. If the satellite is high enough to be free of atmospheric friction, it will remain in orbit forever. However,\nalthough there is no difficulty in maintaining a satellite once it is in orbit, a great deal of energy is required to\nlift the spacecraft off Earth and accelerate it to orbital speed.\nTo illustrate how a satellite is launched, imagine a gun firing a bullet horizontally from the top of a high\nmountain, as inFigure 3.11, which has been adapted from a similar diagram by Newton. Imagine, further, that\nthe friction of the air could be removed and that nothing gets in the bullet\u2019s way. Then the only force that acts\non the bullet after it leaves the muzzle is the gravitational force between the bullet and Earth. 82 3 \u2022 Orbits and Gravity\nFigure3.11Firing a Bullet into Orbit.(a) For pathsaandb, the velocity is not enough to prevent gravity from pulling the bullet\nback to Earth; in casec, the velocity allows the bullet to fall completely around Earth. (b) This diagram by Newton in hisDe Mundi\nSystemate, 1731 edition, illustrates the same concept shown in (a).\nIf the bullet is fired with a velocity we can callv, the gravitational force acting upon it pulls it downward\na\ntoward Earth, where it strikes the ground at pointa. However, if it is given a higher muzzle velocity,v, its\nb\nhigher speed carries it farther before it hits the ground at pointb.\nIf our bullet is given a high enough muzzle velocity,v, the curved surface of Earth causes the ground to\nc\nremain the same distance from the bullet so that the bullet fallsaroundEarth in a complete circle. The speed\nneeded to do this\u2014called the circular satellite velocity\u2014is about 8 kilometers per second, or about 17,500\nmiles per hour in more familiar units.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nUse theNewton\u2019s Mountain simulator(https://openstax.org/l/30newmtnsim)to see for yourself the effects\nof increasing an object\u2019s speed. You can raise the speed until you find the speed that is just fast enough for\nan object to orbit the Earth, the circular satellite velocity, and also the speed at which an object leaves the\nEarth forever, or the escape speed.\nEach year, more than 50 new satellites are launched into orbit by such nations as Russia, the United States,\nChina, Japan, India, and Israel, as well as by the European Space Agency (ESA), a consortium of European\nnations (Figure 3.12). Today, these satellites are used for weather tracking, ecology, global positioning\nsystems, communications, and military purposes, to name a few uses. Most satellites are launched into low\nEarth orbit, since this requires the minimum launch energy. At the orbital speed of 8 kilometers per second,\nthey circle the planet in about 90 minutes. Some of the very low Earth orbits are not indefinitely stable\nbecause, as Earth\u2019s atmosphere swells from time to time, a frictional drag is generated by the atmosphere on\nthese satellites, eventually leading to a loss of energy and \u201cdecay\u201d of the orbit.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.5 \u2022 Motions of Satellites and Spacecraft 83\nFigure3.12Satellites in Earth Orbit.This figure shows the larger pieces of orbital debris that are being tracked by NASA in Earth\u2019s\norbit. (credit: NASA/JSC)\nInterplanetary Spacecraft\nThe exploration of the solar system has been carried out largely by robot spacecraft sent to the other planets.\nTo escape Earth, these craft must achieveescape speed, the speed needed to move away from Earth forever,\nwhich is about 11 kilometers per second (about 25,000 miles per hour). After escaping Earth, these craft coast\nto their targets, subject only to minor trajectory adjustments provided by small thruster rockets on board. In\ninterplanetary flight, these spacecraft follow orbits around the Sun that are modified only when they pass near\none of the planets.\nAs it comes close to its target, a spacecraft is deflected by the planet\u2019s gravitational force into a modified orbit,\neither gaining or losing energy in the process. Spacecraft controllers have actually been able to use a planet\u2019s\ngravity to redirect a flyby spacecraft to a second target. For example, Voyager 2 used a series of gravity-\nassisted encounters to yield successive flybys of Jupiter (1979), Saturn (1980), Uranus (1986), and Neptune\n(1989). The Galileo spacecraft, launched in 1989, flew past Venus once and Earth twice to gain the energy\nrequired to reach its ultimate goal of orbiting Jupiter.\nIf we wish to orbit a planet, we must slow the spacecraft with a rocket when the spacecraft is near its\ndestination, allowing it to be captured into an elliptical orbit. Additional rocket thrust is required to bring a\nvehicle down from orbit for a landing on the surface. Finally, if a return trip to Earth is planned, the landed\npayload must include enough propulsive power to repeat the entire process in reverse. 84 3 \u2022 Orbits and Gravity\n3.6 Gravity with More Than Two Bodies\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain how the gravitational interactions of many bodies can causes perturbations in their motions\nExplain how the planet Neptune was discovered\nUntil now, we have considered the Sun and a planet (or a planet and one of its moons) as nothing more than a\npair of bodies revolving around each other. In fact, all the planets exert gravitational forces upon one another\nas well. These interplanetary attractions cause slight variations from the orbits than would be expected if the\ngravitational forces between planets were neglected. The motion of a body that is under the gravitational\ninfluence of two or more other bodies is very complicated and can be calculated properly only with large\ncomputers. Fortunately, astronomers have such computers at their disposal in universities and government\nresearch institutes.\nThe Interactions of Many Bodies\nAs an example, suppose you have a cluster of a thousand stars all orbiting a common center (such clusters are\nquite common, as we shall see inStar Clusters). If we know the exact position of each star at any given instant,\nwe can calculate the combined gravitational force of the entire group on any one member of the cluster.\nKnowing the force on the star in question, we can therefore find how it will accelerate. If we know how it was\nmoving to begin with, we can then calculate how it will move in the next instant of time, thus tracking its\nmotion.\nHowever, the problem is complicated by the fact that the other stars are also moving and thus changing the\neffect they will have on our star. Therefore, we must simultaneously calculate the acceleration of each star\nproduced by the combination of the gravitational attractions of all the others in order to track the motions of\nall of them, and hence of any one. Such complex calculations have been carried out with modern computers to\ntrack the evolution of hypothetical clusters of stars with up to a million members (Figure 3.13).\nFigure3.13Modern Computing Power.These supercomputers at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center are capable of tracking the\nmotions of more than a million objects under their mutual gravitation. (credit: NASA Ames Research Center/Pleiades)\nWithin the solar system, the problem of computing the orbits of planets and spacecraft is somewhat simpler.\nWe have seen that Kepler\u2019s laws, which do not take into account the gravitational effects of the other planets\non an orbit, really work quite well. This is because these additional influences are very small in comparison\nwith the dominant gravitational attraction of the Sun. Under such circumstances, it is possible to treat the\neffects of other bodies as smallperturbations(or disturbances). During the eighteenth and nineteenth\ncenturies, mathematicians developed many elegant techniques for calculating perturbations, permitting them\nto predict very precisely the positions of the planets. Such calculations eventually led to the prediction and\ndiscovery of a new planet in 1846.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.6 \u2022 Gravity with More Than Two Bodies 85\nThe Discovery of Neptune\nThe discovery of the eighth planet,Neptune, was one of the high points in the development of gravitational\ntheory. In 1781, WilliamHerschel, a musician and amateur astronomer, accidentally discovered the seventh\nplanet,Uranus. It happens that Uranus had been observed a century before, but in none of those earlier\nsightings was it recognized as a planet; rather, it was simply recorded as a star. Herschel\u2019s discovery showed\nthat there could be planets in the solar system too dim to be visible to the unaided eye, but ready to be\ndiscovered with a telescope if we just knew where to look.\nBy 1790, an orbit had been calculated for Uranus using observations of its motion in the decade following its\ndiscovery. Even after allowance was made for the perturbing effects of Jupiter and Saturn, however, it was\nfound that Uranus did not move on an orbit that exactly fit the earlier observations of it made since 1690. By\n1840, the discrepancy between the positions observed for Uranus and those predicted from its computed orbit\namounted to about 0.03\u00b0\u2014an angle barely discernable to the unaided eye but still larger than the probable\nerrors in the orbital calculations. In other words, Uranus just did not seem to move on the orbit predicted from\nNewtonian theory.\nIn 1843, John CouchAdams, a young Englishman who had just completed his studies at Cambridge, began a\ndetailed mathematical analysis of the irregularities in the motion of Uranus to see whether they might be\nproduced by the pull of an unknown planet. He hypothesized a planet more distant from the Sun than Uranus,\nand then determined the mass and orbit it had to have to account for the departures in Uranus\u2019 orbit. In\nOctober 1845, Adams delivered his results to George Airy, the British Astronomer Royal, informing him where\nin the sky to find the new planet. We now know that Adams\u2019 predicted position for the new body was correct to\nwithin 2\u00b0, but for a variety of reasons, Airy did not follow up right away.\nMeanwhile, French mathematician Urbain Jean JosephLe Verrier, unaware of Adams or his work, attacked the\nsame problem and published its solution in June 1846. Airy, noting that Le Verrier\u2019s predicted position for the\nunknown planet agreed to within 1\u00b0 with that of Adams, suggested to James Challis, Director of the Cambridge\nObservatory, that he begin a search for the new object. The Cambridge astronomer, having no up-to-date star\ncharts of the Aquarius region of the sky where the planet was predicted to be, proceeded by recording the\npositions of all the faint stars he could observe with his telescope in that location. It was Challis\u2019 plan to repeat\nsuch plots at intervals of several days, in the hope that the planet would distinguish itself from a star by its\nmotion. Unfortunately, he was negligent in examining his observations; although he had actually seen the\nplanet, he did not recognize it.\nAbout a month later, Le Verrier suggested to JohannGalle, an astronomer at the Berlin Observatory, that he\nlook for the planet. Galle received Le Verrier\u2019s letter on September 23, 1846, and, possessing new charts of the\nAquarius region, found and identified the planet that very night. It was less than a degree from the position Le\nVerrier predicted. The discovery of the eighth planet, now known as Neptune (the Latin name for the god of\nthe sea), was a major triumph for gravitational theory for it dramatically confirmed the generality of Newton\u2019s\nlaws. The honor for the discovery is properly shared by the two mathematicians, Adams and Le Verrier (Figure\n3.14). 86 3 \u2022 Orbits and Gravity\nFigure3.14Mathematicians Who Discovered a Planet.(a) John Couch Adams (1819\u20131892) and (b) Urbain J. J. Le Verrier\n(1811\u20131877) share the credit for discovering the planet Neptune.\nWe should note that the discovery of Neptune was not a complete surprise to astronomers, who had long\nsuspected the existence of the planet based on the \u201cdisobedient\u201d motion of Uranus. On September 10, 1846,\ntwo weeks before Neptune was actually found, John Herschel, son of the discoverer of Uranus, remarked in a\nspeech before the British Association, \u201cWe see [the new planet] as Columbus saw America from the shores of\nSpain. Its movements have been felt trembling along the far-reaching line of our analysis with a certainty\nhardly inferior to ocular demonstration.\u201d\nThis discovery was a major step forward in combining Newtonian theory with painstaking observations. Such\nwork continues in our own times with the discovery of planets around other stars.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nFor the fuller story of how Neptune was predicted and found (and the effect of the discovery on the search\nfor Pluto), you can readthis page(https://openstax.org/l/30nepplumatdis)on the mathematical discovery\nof planets.\nMAKING CONNECTIONS\nAstronomy and the Poets\nWhen Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton formulated the fundamental rules that underlie everything\nin the physical world, they changed much more than the face of science. For some, they gave humanity the\ncourage to let go of old superstitions and see the world as rational and manageable; for others, they upset\ncomforting, ordered ways that had served humanity for centuries, leaving only a dry, \u201cmechanical\nclockwork\u201d universe in their wake.\nPoets of the time reacted to such changes in their work and debated whether the new world picture was an\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3.6 \u2022 Gravity with More Than Two Bodies 87\nappealing or frightening one. John Donne (1573\u20131631), in a poem called \u201cAnatomy of the World,\u201d laments\nthe passing of the old certainties:\nThe new Philosophy [science] calls all in doubt,\nThe element of fire is quite put out;\nThe Sun is lost, and th\u2019 earth, and no man\u2019s wit\nCan well direct him where to look for it.\n(Here the \u201celement of fire\u201d refers also to the sphere of fire, which medieval thought placed between Earth\nand the Moon.)\nBy the next century, however, poets like Alexander Pope were celebrating Newton and the Newtonian world\nview. Pope\u2019s famous couplet, written upon Newton\u2019s death, goes\nNature, and nature\u2019s laws lay hid in night.\nGod said, Let Newton be! And all was light.\nIn his 1733 poem,An Essay on Man, Pope delights in the complexity of the new views of the world,\nincomplete though they are:\nOf man, what see we, but his station here,\nFrom which to reason, to which refer? . . .\nHe, who thro\u2019 vast immensity can pierce,\nSee worlds on worlds compose one universe,\nObserve how system into system runs,\nWhat other planets circle other suns,\nWhat vary\u2019d being peoples every star,\nMay tell why Heav\u2019n has made us as we are . . .\nAll nature is but art, unknown to thee;\nAll chance, direction, which thou canst not see;\nAll discord, harmony not understood;\nAll partial evil, universal good:\nAnd, in spite of pride, in erring reason\u2019s spite,\nOne truth is clear, whatever is, is right.\nPoets and philosophers continued to debate whether humanity was exalted or debased by the new views of\nscience. The nineteenth-century poet Arthur Hugh Clough (1819\u20131861) cries out in his poem \u201cThe New\nSinai\u201d:\nAnd as old from Sinai\u2019s top God said that God is one,\nBy science strict so speaks He now to tell us, there is None!\nEarth goes by chemic forces; Heaven\u2019s a M\u00e9canique Celeste!\nAnd heart and mind of humankind a watchwork as the rest!\n(A \u201cm\u00e9canique celeste\u201d is a clockwork model to demonstrate celestial motions.)\nThe twentieth-century poet Robinson Jeffers (whose brother was an astronomer) saw it differently in a\npoem called \u201cStar Swirls\u201d:\nThere is nothing like astronomy to pull the stuff out of man.\nHis stupid dreams and red-rooster importance:\nLet him count the star-swirls. 88 3 \u2022 Key Terms\nKey Terms\nangular momentum the measure of the motion of a rotating object in terms of its speed and how widely the\nobject\u2019s mass is distributed around its axis\naphelion the point in its orbit where a planet (or other orbiting object) is farthest from the Sun\napogee the point in its orbit where an Earth satellite is farthest from Earth\nasteroid belt the region of the solar system between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter in which most asteroids\nare located; the main belt, where the orbits are generally the most stable, extends from 2.2 to 3.3 AU from\nthe Sun\nastronomical unit (AU) the unit of length defined as the average distance between Earth and the Sun; this\ndistance is about 1.5 \u00d7 108kilometers\ndensity the ratio of the mass of an object to its volume\neccentricity in an ellipse, the ratio of the distance between the foci to the major axis\nellipse a closed curve for which the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to two points inside\n(called the foci) is always the same\nescape speed the speed a body must achieve to break away from the gravity of another body\nfocus (plural: foci) one of two fixed points inside an ellipse from which the sum of the distances to any point\non the ellipse is constant\ngravity the mutual attraction of material bodies or particles\nKepler\u2019s first law each planet moves around the Sun in an orbit that is an ellipse, with the Sun at one focus\nof the ellipse\nKepler\u2019s second law the straight line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in space in equal\nintervals of time\nKepler\u2019s third law the square of a planet\u2019s orbital period is directly proportional to the cube of the\nsemimajor axis of its orbit\nmajor axis the maximum diameter of an ellipse\nmass a measure of the amount of material within an object\nmomentum the measure of the amount of motion of a body; the momentum of a body is the product of its\nmass and velocity; in the absence of an unbalanced force, momentum is conserved\nNewton\u2019s first law every object will continue to be in a state of rest or move at a constant speed in a straight\nline unless it is compelled to change by an outside force\nNewton\u2019s second law the change of motion of a body is proportional to and in the direction of the force\nacting on it\nNewton\u2019s third law for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction (or:the mutual actions of two\nbodies upon each other are always equal and act in opposite directions)\norbit the path of an object that is in revolution about another object or point\norbital period (P) the time it takes an object to travel once around the Sun\norbital speed the speed at which an object (usually a planet) orbits around the mass of another object; in\nthe case of a planet, the speed at which each planet moves along its ellipse\nperigee the point in its orbit where an Earth satellite is closest to Earth\nperihelion the point in its orbit where a planet (or other orbiting object) is nearest to the Sun\nperturbation a small disturbing effect on the motion or orbit of a body produced by a third body\nsatellite an object that revolves around a planet\nsemimajor axis half of the major axis of a conic section, such as an ellipse\nvelocity the speed and direction a body is moving\u2014for example, 44 kilometers per second toward the north\ngalactic pole\nAccess for free at openstax.org 3 \u2022 Summary 89\nSummary\n3.1The Laws of Planetary Motion\nTycho Brahe\u2019s accurate observations of planetary positions provided the data used by Johannes Kepler to\nderive his three fundamental laws of planetary motion. Kepler\u2019s laws describe the behavior of planets in their\norbits as follows: (1) planetary orbits are ellipses with the Sun at one focus; (2) in equal intervals, a planet\u2019s\norbit sweeps out equal areas; and (3) the relationship between the orbital period (P) and the semimajor axis\n(a) of an orbit is given byP2=a3(whenais in units of AU andPis in units of Earth years).\n3.2Newton\u2019s Great Synthesis\nIn hisPrincipia, Isaac Newton established the three laws that govern the motion of objects: (1) objects\ncontinue to be at rest or move with a constant velocity unless acted upon by an outside force; (2) an outside\nforce causes an acceleration (and changes the momentum) for an object; and (3) for every action there is an\nequal and opposite reaction. Momentum is a measure of the motion of an object and depends on both its\nmass and its velocity. Angular momentum is a measure of the motion of a spinning or revolving object and\ndepends on its mass, velocity, and distance from the point around which it revolves. The density of an object is\nits mass divided by its volume.\n3.3Newton\u2019s Universal Law of Gravitation\nGravity, the attractive force between all masses, is what keeps the planets in orbit. Newton\u2019s universal law of\ngravitation relates the gravitational force to mass and distance:\nThe force of gravity is what gives us our sense of weight. Unlike mass, which is constant, weight can vary\ndepending on the force of gravity (or acceleration) you feel. When Kepler\u2019s laws are reexamined in the light of\nNewton\u2019s gravitational law, it becomes clear that the masses of both objects are important for the third law,\nwhich becomesa3= (M +M) \u00d7P2. Mutual gravitational effects permit us to calculate the masses of\n1 2\nastronomical objects, from comets to galaxies.\n3.4Orbits in the Solar System\nThe closest point in a satellite orbit around Earth is its perigee, and the farthest point is its apogee\n(corresponding to perihelion and aphelion for an orbit around the Sun). The planets follow orbits around the\nSun that are nearly circular and in the same plane. Most asteroids are found between Mars and Jupiter in the\nasteroid belt, whereas comets generally follow orbits of high eccentricity.\n3.5Motions of Satellites and Spacecraft\nThe orbit of an artificial satellite depends on the circumstances of its launch. The circular satellite velocity\nneeded to orbit Earth\u2019s surface is 8 kilometers per second, and the escape speed from our planet is 11\nkilometers per second. There are many possible interplanetary trajectories, including those that use gravity-\nassisted flybys of one object to redirect the spacecraft toward its next target.\n3.6Gravity with More Than Two Bodies\nCalculating the gravitational interaction of more than two objects is complicated and requires large\ncomputers. If one object (like the Sun in our solar system) dominates gravitationally, it is possible to calculate\nthe effects of a second object in terms of small perturbations. This approach was used by John Couch Adams\nand Urbain Le Verrier to predict the position of Neptune from its perturbations of the orbit of Uranus and thus\ndiscover a new planet mathematically. 90 3 \u2022 For Further Exploration\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nBrahe and Kepler\nChristianson, G. \u201cThe Celestial Palace of Tycho Brahe.\u201dScientific American(February 1961): 118.\nGingerich, O. \u201cJohannes Kepler and the Rudolphine Tables.\u201dSky & Telescope(December 1971): 328.

And why are the seasons in Australia or Peru the opposite of those in\nthe United States or Europe?\nThe story is told thatGalileo, as he left the Hall of the Inquisition following his retraction of the doctrine that\nEarth rotates and revolves about the Sun, said under his breath, \u201cBut nevertheless it moves.\u201d Historians are\nnot sure whether the story is true, but certainly Galileo knew that Earth was in motion, whatever church\nauthorities said.\nIt is the motions of Earth that produce the seasons and give us our measures of time and date. The Moon\u2019s\nmotions around us provide the concept of the month and the cycle of lunar phases. In this chapter we\nexamine some of the basic phenomena of our everyday world in their astronomical context. 96 4 \u2022 Earth, Moon, and Sky\n4.1 Earth and Sky\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe how latitude and longitude are used to map Earth\nExplain how right ascension and declination are used to map the sky\nIn order to create an accurate map, a mapmaker needs a way to uniquely and simply identify the location of all\nthe major features on the map, such as cities or natural landmarks. Similarly, astronomical mapmakers need a\nway to uniquely and simply identify the location of stars, galaxies, and other celestial objects. On Earth maps,\nwe divide the surface of Earth into a grid, and each location on that grid can easily be found using itslatitude\nandlongitudecoordinate. Astronomers have a similar system for objects on the sky. Learning about these can\nhelp us understand the apparent motion of objects in the sky from various places on Earth.\nLocating Places on Earth\nLet\u2019s begin by fixing our position on the surface of planetEarth. As we discussed inObserving the Sky: The\nBirth of Astronomy, Earth\u2019s axis of rotation defines the locations of its North and South Poles and of its\nequator, halfway between. Two other directions are also defined by Earth\u2019s motions: east is the direction\ntoward which Earth rotates, and west is its opposite. At almost any point on Earth, the four directions\u2014north,\nsouth, east, and west\u2014are well defined, despite the fact that our planet is round rather than flat. The only\nexceptions are exactly at the North and South Poles, where the directions east and west are ambiguous\n(because points exactly at the poles do not turn).\nWe can use these ideas to define a system ofcoordinatesattached to our planet. Such a system, like the layout\nof streets and avenues in Manhattan or Salt Lake City, helps us find where we are or want to go. Coordinates\non a sphere, however, are a little more complicated than those on a flat surface. We must define circles on the\nsphere that play the same role as the rectangular grid that you see on city maps.\nAgreat circleis any circle on the surface of a sphere whose center is at the center of the sphere. For example,\nEarth\u2019s equator is a great circle on Earth\u2019s surface, halfway between the North and South Poles. We can also\nimagine a series of great circles that pass through both the North and South Poles. Each of the circles is called\nameridian; they are each perpendicular to the equator, crossing it at right angles.\nAny point on the surface of Earth will have a meridian passing through it (Figure 4.2). The meridian specifies\nthe east-west location, or longitude, of the place. By international agreement (and it took many meetings for\nthe world\u2019s countries to agree), longitude is defined as the number of degrees of arc along the equator\nbetween your meridian and the one passing through Greenwich, England, which has been designated as the\nPrime Meridian. The longitude of the Prime Meridian is defined as 0\u00b0.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.1 \u2022 Earth and Sky 97\nFigure4.2Latitude and Longitude of Washington, DC.We use latitude and longitude to find cities like Washington, DC, on a globe.\nLatitude is the number of degrees north or south of the equator, and longitude is the number of degrees east or west of the Prime\nMeridian. Washington, DC\u2019s coordinates are 38\u00b0 N and 77\u00b0 W.\nWhy Greenwich, you might ask? Every country wanted 0\u00b0 longitude to pass through its own capital. Greenwich,\nthe site of the old Royal Observatory (Figure 4.3), was selected because it was between continental Europe and\nthe United States, and because it was the site for much of the development of the method to measure\nlongitude at sea. Longitudes are measured either to the east or to the west of the Greenwich meridian from 0\u00b0\nto 180\u00b0. As an example, the longitude of the clock-house benchmark of the U.S. Naval Observatory in\nWashington, DC, is 77.066\u00b0 W.\nFigure4.3Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England.At the internationally agreed-upon zero point of longitude at the Royal\nObservatory Greenwich, tourists can stand and straddle the exact line where longitude \u201cbegins.\u201d(credit left: modification of work by\n\u201cpdbreen\u201d/Flickr; credit right: modification of work by Ben Sutherland)\nYour latitude (or north-south location) is the number of degrees of arc you are away from the equator along\nyour meridian. Latitudes are measured either north or south of the equator from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0. (The latitude of the\nequator is 0\u00b0.) As an example, the latitude of the previously mentioned Naval Observatory benchmark is\n38.921\u00b0 N. The latitude of the South Pole is 90\u00b0 S, and the latitude of the North Pole is 90\u00b0 N.\nLocating Places in the Sky\nPositions in the sky are measured in a way that is very similar to the way we measure positions on the surface\nof Earth. Instead of latitude and longitude, however, astronomers use coordinates calleddeclinationand\nright ascension. To denote positions of objects in the sky, it is often convenient to make use of the fictitious\ncelestial sphere. We saw inObserving the Sky: The Birth of Astronomythat the sky appears to rotate about 98 4 \u2022 Earth, Moon, and Sky\npoints above the North and South Poles of Earth\u2014points in the sky called the north celestial pole and the\nsouth celestial pole. Halfway between the celestial poles, and thus 90\u00b0 from each pole, is thecelestial equator,\na great circle on the celestial sphere that is in the same plane as Earth\u2019s equator. We can use these markers in\nthe sky to set up a system of celestial coordinates.\nDeclination on the celestial sphere is measured the same way that latitude is measured on the sphere of Earth:\nfrom the celestial equator toward the north (positive) or south (negative). SoPolaris, the star near the north\ncelestial pole, has a declination of almost +90\u00b0.\nRight ascension (RA) is like longitude, except that instead of Greenwich, the arbitrarily chosen point where we\nstart counting is thevernal equinox, a point in the sky where theecliptic(the Sun\u2019s path) crosses the celestial\nequator. RA can be expressed either in units of angle (degrees) or in units of time. This is because the celestial\nsphere appears to turn around Earth once a day as our planet turns on its axis. Thus the 360\u00b0 of RA that it\ntakes to go once around the celestial sphere can just as well be set equal to 24 hours. Then each 15\u00b0 of arc is\nequal to 1 hour of time. For example, the approximate celestial coordinates of the bright star Capella are RA 5h\n= 75\u00b0 and declination +50\u00b0.\nOne way to visualize these circles in the sky is to imagine Earth as a transparent sphere with the terrestrial\ncoordinates (latitude and longitude) painted on it with dark paint. Imagine the celestial sphere around us as a\ngiant ball, painted white on the inside. Then imagine yourself at the center of Earth, with a bright light bulb in\nthe middle, looking out through its transparent surface to the sky. The terrestrial poles, equator, and\nmeridians will be projected as dark shadows on the celestial sphere, giving us the system of coordinates in the\nsky.\nThe Turning Earth\nWhy do many stars rise and set each night? Why, in other words, does the night sky seem to turn? We have\nseen that the apparent rotation of the celestial sphere could be accounted for either by a daily rotation of the\nsky around a stationary Earth or by the rotation of Earth itself. Since the seventeenth century, it has been\ngenerally accepted that it is Earth that turns, but not until the nineteenth century did the French physicist Jean\nFoucaultprovide an unambiguous demonstration of this rotation. In 1851, he suspended a 60-meter\npendulum with a mass of about 25 kilograms from the dome of the Pantheon in Paris and started the\npendulum swinging evenly. If Earth had not been turning, there would have been no alteration of the\npendulum\u2019s plane of oscillation, and so it would have continued tracing the same path. Yet after a few minutes\nFoucault could see that the pendulum\u2019s plane of motion was turning. Foucault explained that it was not the\npendulum that was shifting, but rather Earth that was turning beneath it (Figure 4.4). You can now find such\npendulums in many science centers and planetariums around the world.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.2 \u2022 The Seasons 99\nFigure4.4Foucault\u2019s Pendulum.As Earth turns, the plane of oscillation of the Foucault pendulum shifts gradually so that over the\ncourse of 12 hours, all the targets in the circle at the edge of the wooden platform are knocked over in sequence. (credit: Manuel M.\nVicente)\nCan you think of other pieces of evidence that indicate that it is Earth and not the sky that is turning? (See\nCollaborative Group Activity Aat the end of this chapter.)\n4.2 The Seasons\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe how the tilt of Earth\u2019s axis causes theseasons\nExplain how seasonal differences on Earth vary with latitude\nOne of the fundamental facts of life at Earth\u2019s midlatitudes, where most of this book\u2019s readers live, is that\nthere are significant variations in the heat we receive from the Sun during the course of the year. We thus\ndivide the year intoseasons, each with its different amount of sunlight. The difference between seasons gets\nmore pronounced the farther north or south from the equator we travel, and the seasons in the Southern\nHemisphere are the opposite of what we find on the northern half of Earth. With these observed facts in mind,\nlet us ask what causes the seasons.\nMany people have believed that the seasons were the result of the changing distance between Earth and the\nSun. This sounds reasonable at first: it should be colder when Earth is farther from the Sun. But the facts don\u2019t\nbear out this hypothesis. Although Earth\u2019s orbit around the Sun is an ellipse, its distance from the Sun varies\nby only about 3%. That\u2019s not enough to cause significant variations in the Sun\u2019s heating. To make matters\nworse for people in North America who hold this hypothesis, Earth is actually closest to the Sun in January,\nwhen the Northern Hemisphere is in the middle of winter. And if distance were the governing factor, why\nwould the two hemispheres have opposite seasons? As we shall show, the seasons are actually caused by the\n23.5\u00b0 tilt of Earth\u2019s axis.\nThe Seasons and Sunshine\nFigure 4.5shows Earth\u2019s annual path around theSun, with Earth\u2019s axis tilted by 23.5\u00b0. Note that our axis\ncontinues to point the same direction in the sky throughout the year. As Earth travels around the Sun, in June\nthe Northern Hemisphere \u201cleans into\u201d the Sun and is more directly illuminated. In December, the situation is\nreversed: the Southern Hemisphere leans into the Sun, and the Northern Hemisphere leans away. In 100 4 \u2022 Earth, Moon, and Sky\nSeptember and March, Earth leans \u201csideways\u201d\u2014neither into the Sun nor away from it\u2014so the two\nhemispheres are equally favored with sunshine.\nFigure4.5Seasons.We see Earth at different seasons as it circles the Sun. In June, the Northern Hemisphere \u201cleans into\u201d the Sun,\nand those in the North experience summer and have longer days. In December, during winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the\nSouthern Hemisphere \u201cleans into\u201d the Sun and is illuminated more directly. In spring and autumn, the two hemispheres receive\nmore equal shares of sunlight.1\nHow does the Sun\u2019s favoring one hemisphere translate into making it warmer for us down on the surface of\nEarth? There are two effects we need to consider. When we lean into the Sun, sunlight hits us at a more direct\nangle and is more effective at heating Earth\u2019s surface (Figure 4.6). You can get a similar effect by shining a\nflashlight onto a wall. If you shine the flashlight straight on, you get an intense spot of light on the wall. But if\nyou hold the flashlight at an angle (if the wall \u201cleans out\u201d of the beam), then the spot of light is more spread\nout. Like the straight-on light, the sunlight in June is more direct and intense in the Northern Hemisphere, and\nhence more effective at heating.\nFigure4.6The Sun\u2019s Rays in Summer and Winter.(a) In summer, the Sun appears high in the sky and its rays hit Earth more\ndirectly, spreading out less. (b) In winter, the Sun is low in the sky and its rays spread out over a much wider area, becoming less\neffective at heating the ground.\nThe second effect has to do with the length of time the Sun spends above the horizon (Figure 4.7). Even if\nyou\u2019ve never thought about astronomy before, we\u2019re sure you have observed that the hours of daylight\nincrease in summer and decrease in winter. Let\u2019s see why this happens.\n1 Note that the dates indicated for the solstices and equinoxes are approximate; depending on the year, they may occur a day or\ntwo earlier or later.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.2 \u2022 The Seasons 101\nFigure4.7The Sun\u2019s Path in the Sky for Different Seasons.On June 21, the Sun rises north of east and sets north of west. For\nobservers in the Northern Hemisphere of Earth, the Sun spends about 15 hours above the horizon in the United States, meaning\nmore hours of daylight. On December 21, the Sun rises south of east and sets south of west. It spends 9 hours above the horizon in\nthe United States, which means fewer hours of daylight and more hours of night in northern lands (and a strong need for people to\nhold celebrations to cheer themselves up). On March 21 and September 21, the Sun spends equal amounts of time above and below\nthe horizon in both hemispheres.\nAs we saw inObserving the Sky: The Birth of Astronomy, an equivalent way to look at our path around the Sun\neach year is to pretend that the Sun moves around Earth (on a circle called the ecliptic). Because Earth\u2019s axis is\ntilted, the ecliptic is tilted by about 23.5\u00b0 relative to the celestial equator (reviewFigure 2.7). As a result, where\nwe see the Sun in the sky changes as the year wears on.\nIn June, the Sun is north of the celestial equator and spends more time with those who live in the Northern\nHemisphere. It rises high in the sky and is above the horizon in the United States for as long as 15 hours. Thus,\nthe Sun not only heats us with more direct rays, but it also has more time to do it each day. (Notice inFigure\n4.7that the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s gain is the Southern Hemisphere\u2019s loss. There the June Sun is low in the\nsky, meaning fewer daylight hours. In Chile, for example, June is a colder, darker time of year.) In December,\nwhen the Sun is south of the celestial equator, the situation is reversed.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTheMotions of the Sun Simulator(https://openstax.org/l/30motionsunsim)from Columbia University's\nCenter for Teaching and Learning provides a demonstration of the Sun's apparent motion in the sky as the\nEarth rotates each day, and its changing altitude with latitude and time of year.\nLet\u2019s look at what the Sun\u2019s illumination on Earth looks like at some specific dates of the year, when these\neffects are at their maximum. On or about June 21 (the date we who live in the Northern Hemisphere call the\nsummer solsticeor sometimes the first day of summer), the Sun shines down most directly upon the Northern\nHemisphere of Earth. It appears about 23\u00b0 north of the equator, and thus, on that date, it passes through the\nzenith of places on Earth that are at 23\u00b0 N latitude. The situation is shown in detail inFigure 4.8. To a person at\n23\u00b0 N (near Hawaii, for example), the Sun is directly overhead at noon. This latitude, where the Sun can appear\nat the zenith at noon on the first day of summer, is called theTropic of Cancer.\nWe also see inFigure 4.8that the Sun\u2019s rays shine down all around the North Pole at thesolstice. As Earth\nturns on its axis, the North Pole is continuously illuminated by the Sun; all places within 23\u00b0 of the pole have\nsunshine for 24 hours. The Sun is as far north on this date as it can get; thus, 90\u00b0 \u2013 23\u00b0 (or 67\u00b0 N) is the 102 4 \u2022 Earth, Moon, and Sky\nsouthernmost latitude where the Sun can be seen for a full 24-hour period (sometimes called the \u201cland of the\nmidnight Sun\u201d). That circle of latitude is called theArctic Circle.\nFigure4.8Earth on June 21.This is the date of the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere. Note that as Earth turns on its axis\n(the line connecting the North and South Poles), the North Pole is in constant sunlight while the South Pole is veiled in 24 hours of\ndarkness. The Sun is at the zenith for observers on the Tropic of Cancer.\nMany early cultures scheduled special events around the summer solstice to celebrate the longest days and\nthank their gods for making the weather warm. This required people to keep track of the lengths of the days\nand the northward trek of the Sun in order to know the right day for the \u201cparty.\u201d (You can do the same thing\nby watching for several weeks, from the same observation point, where the Sun rises or sets relative to a fixed\nlandmark. In spring, the Sun will rise farther and farther north of east, and set farther and farther north of\nwest, reaching the maximum around the summer solstice.)\nNow look at the South Pole inFigure 4.8. On June 21, all places within 23\u00b0of the South Pole\u2014that is, south of\nwhat we call theAntarctic Circle\u2014do not see the Sun at all for 24 hours.\nThe situation is reversed 6 months later, about December 21 (the date of thewinter solstice, or the first day of\nwinter in the Northern Hemisphere), as shown inFigure 4.9. Now it is the Arctic Circle that has the 24-hour\nnight and the Antarctic Circle that has the midnight Sun. At latitude 23\u00b0 S, called theTropic of Capricorn, the\nSun passes through the zenith at noon. Days are longer in the Southern Hemisphere and shorter in the north.\nIn the United States and Southern Europe, there may be only 9 or 10 hours of sunshine during the day. It is\nwinter in the Northern Hemisphere and summer in the Southern Hemisphere.\nFigure4.9Earth on December 21.This is the date of the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere. Now the North Pole is in\ndarkness for 24 hours and the South Pole is illuminated. The Sun is at the zenith for observers on the Tropic of Capricorn and thus is\nlow in the sky for the residents of the Northern Hemisphere.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.2 \u2022 The Seasons 103\nEXAMPLE 4.1\nSeasonal Variations\nAs you can see inFigure 4.8, the Tropic of Cancer is the latitude for which the Sun is directly overhead on\nthe summer solstice. At this time, the Sun is at a declination of 23\u00b0 N of the celestial equator, and the\ncorresponding latitude on Earth is 23\u00b0 N of the equator. If Earth were tilted a bit less, then the Tropic of\nCancer would be at a lower latitude, closer to the equator.\nThe Arctic Circle marks the southernmost latitude for which the day length is 24 hours on the day of the\nsummer solstice. This is located at 90\u00b0 \u2013 23\u00b0 = 67\u00b0 N of Earth\u2019s equator. If Earth were tilted a bit less, then\nthe Arctic Circle would move farther North. In the limit at which Earth is not tilted at all (its axis is\nperpendicular to the ecliptic), the Tropic of Cancer would be right on Earth\u2019s equator, and the Arctic Circle\nwould simply be the North Pole. Suppose the tilt of Earth\u2019s axis were tilted only 5\u00b0. What would be the effect\non the seasons and the locations of the Tropic of Cancer and Arctic Circle?\nSolution\nIf Earth were tilted less, the seasons would be less extreme. The variation in day length and direct sunlight\nwould be very small over the course of a year, and the Sun\u2019s daily path in the sky would not vary much. If\nEarth were tilted by 5\u00b0, the Sun\u2019s position on the day of the summer solstice would be 5\u00b0 N of the celestial\nequator, so the Tropic of Cancer would be at the corresponding latitude on Earth of 5\u00b0 N of the Equator. The\nArctic Circle would be located at 90\u00b0 \u2013 5\u00b0 = 85\u00b0 N of the equator.\nCheck Your Learning\nSuppose the tilt of Earth\u2019s axis were 16\u00b0. What, then, would be the difference in latitude between the Arctic\nCircle and the Tropic of Cancer? What would be the effect on the seasons compared with that produced by\nthe actual tilt of 23\u00b0?\nAnswer:\nThe Tropic of Cancer is at a latitude equal to Earth\u2019s tilt, so in this case, it would be at 16\u00b0 N latitude. The\nArctic Circle is at a latitude equal to 90\u00b0 minus Earth\u2019s tilt, or 90\u00b0 \u2013 16\u00b0 = 74\u00b0. The difference between these\ntwo latitudes is 74\u00b0 \u2013 16\u00b0 = 58\u00b0. Since the tilt of Earth is less, there would be less variation in the tilt of Earth\nand less variation in the Sun\u2019s paths throughout the year, so there would be milder seasonal changes.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe Columbia University\u2019s Center for Teaching and Learning\u2019sMotions of the Sun Simulator\n(https://openstax.org/l/30motionsunsim)allows you to see how the Sun\u2019s changing altitude over the\ncourse of the year changes the intensity of lighting experienced on Earth. Select the \u201cStep by day\u201d option\nbefore running the animation to illustrate this effect.\nMany cultures that developed some distance north of the equator have a celebration around December 21 to\nhelp people deal with the depressing lack of sunlight and the often dangerously cold temperatures. Originally,\nthis was often a time for huddling with family and friends, for sharing the reserves of food and drink, and for\nrituals asking the gods to return the light and heat and turn the cycle of the seasons around. Many cultures\nconstructed elaborate devices for anticipating when the shortest day of the year was coming. Stonehenge in\nEngland, built long before the invention of writing, is probably one such device. In our own time, we continue\nthe winter solstice tradition with various holiday celebrations around that December date. 104 4 \u2022 Earth, Moon, and Sky\nHalfway between the solstices, on about March 21 and September 21, the Sun is on the celestial equator. From\nEarth, it appears above our planet\u2019s equator and favors neither hemisphere. Every place on Earth then\nreceives roughly 12 hours of sunshine and 12 hours of night. The points where the Sun crosses the celestial\nequator are called thevernal(spring) andautumnal(fall)equinoxes.\nThe Seasons at Different Latitudes\nThe seasonal effects are different at different latitudes on Earth. Near the equator, for instance, allseasonsare\nmuch the same. Every day of the year, the Sun is up half the time, so there are approximately 12 hours of\nsunshine and 12 hours of night. Local residents define the seasons by the amount of rain (wet season and dry\nseason) rather than by the amount of sunlight. As we travel north or south, the seasons become more\npronounced, until we reach extreme cases in the Arctic and Antarctic.\nAt the North Pole, all celestial objects that are north of the celestial equator are always above the horizon and,\nas Earth turns, circle around parallel to it. The Sun is north of the celestial equator from about March 21 to\nSeptember 21, so at the North Pole, the Sun rises when it reaches the vernal equinox and sets when it reaches\nthe autumnal equinox. Each year there are 6 months of sunshine at each pole, followed by 6 months of\ndarkness.\nEXAMPLE 4.2\nThe Position of the Sun in the Sky\nThe Sun\u2019s coordinates on the celestial sphere range from a declination of 23\u00b0 N of the celestial equator (or\n+23\u00b0) to a declination 23\u00b0 S of the celestial equator (or \u201323\u00b0). So, the Sun\u2019s altitude at noon, when it crosses\nthe meridian, varies by a total of 46\u00b0. What is the altitude of the Sun at noon on March 21, as seen from a\nplace on Earth\u2019s equator? What is its altitude on June 21, as seen from a place on Earth\u2019s equator?\nSolution\nOn Earth\u2019s equator, the celestial equator passes through the zenith. On March 21, the Sun is crossing the\ncelestial equator, so it should be found at the zenith (90\u00b0) at noon. On June 21, the Sun is 23\u00b0 N of the\ncelestial equator, so it will be 23\u00b0 away from the zenith at noon. The altitude above the horizon will be 23\u00b0\nless than the altitude of the zenith (90\u00b0), so it is 90\u00b0 \u2013 23\u00b0 = 67\u00b0 above the horizon.\nCheck Your Learning\nWhat is the altitude of the Sun at noon on December 21, as seen from a place on the Tropic of Cancer?\nAnswer:\nOn the day of the winter solstice, the Sun is located about 23\u00b0 S of the celestial equator. From the Tropic of\nCancer, a latitude of 23\u00b0 N, the zenith would be a declination of 23\u00b0 N. The difference in declination between\nzenith and the position of the Sun is 46\u00b0, so the Sun would be 46\u00b0 away from the zenith. That means it\nwould be at an altitude of 90\u00b0 \u2013 46\u00b0 = 44\u00b0.\nClarifications about the Real World\nIn our discussions so far, we have been describing the rising and setting of the Sun and stars as they would\nappear if Earth had little or no atmosphere. In reality, however, the atmosphere has the curious effect of\nallowing us to see a little way \u201cover the horizon.\u201d This effect is a result ofrefraction, the bending of light\npassing through air or water, something we will discuss inAstronomical Instruments. Because of this\natmospheric refraction (and the fact that the Sun is not a point of light but a disk), the Sun appears to rise\nearlier and to set later than it would if no atmosphere were present.\nIn addition, the atmosphere scatters light and provides some twilight illumination even when the Sun is below\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.3 \u2022 Keeping Time 105\nthe horizon. Astronomers define morning twilight as beginning when the Sun is 18\u00b0 below the horizon, and\nevening twilight extends until the Sun sinks more than 18\u00b0 below the horizon.\nThese atmospheric effects require small corrections in many of our statements about the seasons. At the\nequinoxes, for example, the Sun appears to be above the horizon for a few minutes longer than 12 hours, and\nbelow the horizon for fewer than 12 hours. These effects are most dramatic at Earth\u2019s poles, where the Sun\nactually can be seen more than a week before it reaches the celestial equator.\nYou probably know that the summer solstice (June 21) is not the warmest day of the year, even if it is the\nlongest. The hottest months in the Northern Hemisphere are July and August. This is because our weather\ninvolves the air and water covering Earth\u2019s surface, and these large reservoirs do not heat up instantaneously.\nYou have probably observed this effect for yourself; for example, a pond does not get warm the moment the\nSun rises but is warmest late in the afternoon, after it has had time to absorb the Sun\u2019s heat. In the same way,\nEarth gets warmer after it has had a chance to absorb the extra sunlight that is the Sun\u2019s summer gift to us.\nAnd the coldest times of winter are a month or more after the winter solstice.\n4.3 Keeping Time\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain the difference between the solar day and the sidereal day\nExplain mean solar time and the reason fortime zones\nThe measurement of time is based on the rotation of Earth. Throughout most of human history, time has been\nreckoned by positions of the Sun and stars in the sky. Only recently have mechanical and electronic clocks\ntaken over this function in regulating our lives.\nThe Length of the Day\nThe most fundamental astronomical unit of time is the day, measured in terms of the rotation of Earth. There\nis, however, more than one way to define the day. Usually, we think of it as the rotation period of Earth with\nrespect to the Sun, called thesolar day. After all, for most people sunrise is more important than the rising\ntime of Arcturus or some other star, so we set our clocks to some version of Sun-time. However, astronomers\nalso use asidereal day, which is defined in terms of the rotation period of Earth with respect to the stars.\nA solar day is slightly longer than a sidereal day because (as you can see fromFigure 4.10) Earth not only turns\nbut also moves along its path around the Sun in a day. Suppose we start when Earth\u2019s orbital position is at day\n1, with both the Sun and some distant star (located in the direction indicated by the long white arrow pointing\nleft), directly in line with the zenith for the observer on Earth. When Earth has completed one rotation with\nrespect to the distant star and is at day 2, the long arrow again points to the same distant star. However,\nnotice that because of the movement of Earth along its orbit from day 1 to 2, the Sun has not yet reached a\nposition above the observer. To complete a solar day, Earth must rotate an additional amount, equal to 1/365\nof a full turn. The time required for this extra rotation is 1/365 of a day, or about 4 minutes. So the solar day is\nabout 4 minutes longer than the sidereal day. 106 4 \u2022 Earth, Moon, and Sky\nFigure4.10Difference Between a Sidereal Day and a Solar Day.This is a top view, looking down as Earth orbits the Sun. Because\nEarth moves around the Sun (roughly 1\u00b0 per day), after one complete rotation of Earth relative to the stars, we do not see the Sun in\nthe same position.\nBecause our ordinary clocks are set to solar time, stars rise 4 minutes earlier each day. Astronomers prefer\nsidereal time for planning their observations because in that system, a star rises at the same time every day.\nEXAMPLE 4.3\nSidereal Time and Solar Time\nThe Sun makes a complete circle in the sky approximately every 24 hours, while the stars make a complete\ncircle in the sky in 4 minutes less time, or 23 hours and 56 minutes. This causes the positions of the stars at\na given time of day or night to change slightly each day. Since stars rise 4 minutes earlier each day, that\nworks out to about 2 hours per month (4 minutes \u00d7 30 = 120 minutes or 2 hours). So, if a particular\nconstellation rises at sunset during the winter, you can be sure that by the summer, it will rise about 12\nhours earlier, with the sunrise, and it will not be so easily visible in the night sky. Let\u2019s say that tonight the\nbright starSiriusrises at 7:00 p.m. from a given location so that by midnight, it is very high in the sky. At\nwhat time will Sirius rise in three months?\nSolution\nIn three months\u2019 time, Sirius will be rising earlier by:\nIt will rise at about 1:00 p.m. and be high in the sky at around sunset instead of midnight. Sirius is the\nbrightest star in the constellation of Canis Major (the big dog). So, some other constellation will be\nprominently visible high in the sky at this later date.\nCheck Your Learning\nIf a star rises at 8:30 p.m. tonight, approximately what time will it rise two months from now?\nAnswer:\nIn two months, the star will rise:\nThis means it will rise at 4:30 p.m.\nApparent Solar Time\nWe can defineapparent solar timeas time reckoned by the actual position of the Sun in the sky (or, during\nthe night, its position below the horizon). This is the kind of time indicated by sundials, and it probably\nrepresents the earliest measure of time used by ancient civilizations. Today, we adopt the middle of the night\nas the starting point of the day and measure time in hours elapsed since midnight.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.3 \u2022 Keeping Time 107\nDuring the first half of the day, the Sun has not yet reached the meridian (the great circle in the sky that\npasses through our zenith). We designate those hours as before midday (ante meridiem, or a.m.), before the\nSun reaches the local meridian. We customarily start numbering the hours after noon over again and\ndesignate them by p.m. (post meridiem), after the Sun reaches the local meridian.\nAlthough apparent solar time seems simple, it is not really very convenient to use. The exact length of an\napparent solar day varies slightly during the year. The eastward progress of the Sun in its annual journey\naround the sky is not uniform because the speed of Earth varies slightly in its elliptical orbit. Another\ncomplication is that Earth\u2019s axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the plane of its revolution. Thus, apparent\nsolar time does not advance at a uniform rate. After the invention of mechanical clocks that run at a uniform\nrate, it became necessary to abandon the apparent solar day as the fundamental unit of time.\nMean Solar Time and Standard Time\nInstead, we can consider themean solar time, which is based on the average value of the solar day over the\ncourse of the year. A mean solar day contains exactly 24 hours and is what we use in our everyday\ntimekeeping. Although mean solar time has the advantage of progressing at a uniform rate, it is still\ninconvenient for practical use because it is determined by the position of the Sun. For example, noon occurs\nwhen the Sun is highest in the sky on the meridian (but not necessarily at the zenith). But because we live on a\nround Earth, the exact time of noon is different as you change your longitude by moving east or west.\nIf mean solar time were strictly observed, people traveling east or west would have to reset their watches\ncontinually as the longitude changed, just to read the local mean time correctly. For instance, a commuter\ntraveling from Oyster Bay on Long Island to New York City would have to adjust the time on the trip through\nthe East River tunnel because Oyster Bay time is actually about 1.6 minutes more advanced than that of\nManhattan. (Imagine an airplane trip in which an obnoxious flight attendant gets on the intercom every\nminute, saying, \u201cPlease reset your watch for local mean time.\u201d)\nUntil near the end of the nineteenth century, every city and town in the United States kept its own local mean\ntime. With the development of railroads and the telegraph, however, the need for some kind of\nstandardization became evident. In 1883, the United States was divided into four standard time zones (now six,\nincluding Hawaii and Alaska), each with one system of time within that zone.\nBy 1900, most of the world was using the system of 24 standardized global time zones. Within each zone, all\nplaces keep the samestandard time, with the local mean solar time of a standard line of longitude running\nmore or less through the middle of each zone. Now travelers reset their watches only when the time change\nhas amounted to a full hour. Pacific standard time is 3 hours earlier than eastern standard time, a fact that\nbecomes painfully obvious in California when someone on the East Coast forgets and calls you at 5:00 a.m.\nGlobally, almost all countries have adopted one or more standard time zones, although one of the largest\nnations, India, has settled on a half-zone, being 5.5 hours from Greenwich standard. Also, China officially uses\nonly one time zone, so all the clocks in that country keep the same time. In Tibet, for example, the Sun rises\nwhile the clocks (which keep Beijing time) say it is midmorning already.\nDaylight saving timeis simply the local standard time of the place plus 1 hour. It has been adopted for spring\nand summer use in most states in the United States, as well as in many countries, to prolong the sunlight into\nevening hours, on the apparent theory that it is easier to change the time by government action than it would\nbe for individuals or businesses to adjust their own schedules to produce the same effect. It does not, of\ncourse, \u201csave\u201d any daylight at all\u2014because the amount of sunlight is not determined by what we do with our\nclocks\u2014and its observance is a point of legislative debate in some states.\nThe International Date Line\nThe fact that time is always advancing as you move toward the east presents a problem. Suppose you travel\neastward around the world. You pass into a new time zone, on the average, about every 15\u00b0 of longitude you 108 4 \u2022 Earth, Moon, and Sky\ntravel, and each time you dutifully set your watch ahead an hour. By the time you have completed your trip,\nyou have set your watch ahead a full 24 hours and thus gained a day over those who stayed at home.\nThe solution to this dilemma is theInternational Date Line, set by international agreement to run\napproximately along the 180\u00b0 meridian of longitude. The date line runs down the middle of the Pacific Ocean,\nalthough it jogs a bit in a few places to avoid cutting through groups of islands and through Alaska (Figure\n4.11). By convention, at the date line, the date of the calendar is changed by one day. Crossing the date line\nfrom west to east, thus advancing your time, you compensate by decreasing the date; crossing from east to\nwest, you increase the date by one day. To maintain our planet on a rational system of timekeeping, we simply\nmust accept that the date will differ in different cities at the same time. A good example is the date when the\nImperial Japanese Navy bombed Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, known in the United States as Sunday, December 7,\n1941, but taught to Japanese students as Monday, December 8.\nFigure4.11Where the Date Changes.The International Date Line is an arbitrarily drawn line on Earth where the date changes. So\nthat neighbors do not have different days, the line is located where Earth\u2019s surface is mostly water.\n4.4 The Calendar\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nUnderstand how calendars varied among different cultures\nExplain the origins of our modern calendar\n\u201cWhat\u2019s today\u2019s date?\u201d is one of the most common questions you can ask (usually when signing a document\nor worrying about whether you should have started studying for your next astronomy exam). Long before the\nera of digital watches, smartphones, and fitness bands that tell the date, people used calendars to help\nmeasure the passage of time.\nThe Challenge of the Calendar\nThere are two traditional functions of anycalendar. First, it must keep track of time over the course of long\nspans, allowing people to anticipate the cycle of the seasons and to honor special religious or personal\nanniversaries. Second, to be useful to a large number of people, a calendar must use natural time intervals\nthat everyone can agree on\u2014those defined by the motions of Earth, the Moon, and sometimes even the\nplanets. The natural units of our calendar are theday, based on the period of rotation of Earth; themonth,\nbased on the cycle of the Moon\u2019s phases (see later in this chapter) about Earth; and the year, based on the\nperiod of revolution of Earth about the Sun. Difficulties have resulted from the fact that these three periods\nare not commensurable; that\u2019s a fancy way of saying that one does not divide evenly into any of the others.\nThe rotation period of Earth is, by definition, 1.0000 day (and here the solar day is used, since that is the basis\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.4 \u2022 The Calendar 109\nof human experience). The period required by the Moon to complete its cycle of phases, called themonth, is\n29.5306 days. The basic period of revolution of Earth, called thetropical year, is 365.2422 days. The ratios of\nthese numbers are not convenient for calculations. This is the historic challenge of the calendar, dealt with in\nvarious ways by different cultures.\nEarly Calendars\nEven the earliest cultures were concerned with the keeping of time and the calendar. Some interesting\nexamples include monuments left by Bronze Age people in northwestern Europe, especially the British Isles.\nThe best preserved of the monuments is Stonehenge, about 13 kilometers from Salisbury in southwest\nEngland (Figure 4.12). It is a complex array of stones, ditches, and holes arranged in concentric circles. Carbon\ndating and other studies show that Stonehenge was built during three periods ranging from about 2800 to\n1500 BCE. Some of the stones are aligned with the directions of the Sun and Moon during their risings and\nsettings at critical times of the year (such as the summer and winter solstices), and it is generally believed that\nat least one function of the monument was connected with the keeping of a calendar.\nFigure4.12Stonehenge.The ancient monument known as Stonehenge was used to keep track of the motions of the Sun and Moon.\n(credit: modification of work by Adriano Aurelio Araujo)\nThe Maya in Central America, who thrived more than a thousand years ago, were also concerned with the\nkeeping of time. Their calendar was as sophisticated as, and perhaps more complex than, contemporary\ncalendars in Europe. The Maya did not attempt to correlate their calendar accurately with the length of the\nyear or lunar month. Rather, their calendar was a system for keeping track of the passage of days and for\ncounting time far into the past or future. Among other purposes, it was useful for predicting astronomical\nevents, such as the position of Venus in the sky (Figure 4.13).\nFigure4.13El Caracol.This Mayan observatory at Chichen Itza in the Yucatan, Mexico, dates from around the year 1000. (credit:\n\u201cwiredtourist.com\u201d/Flickr) 110 4 \u2022 Earth, Moon, and Sky\nThe ancient Chinese developed an especially complex calendar, largely limited to a few privileged hereditary\ncourt astronomer-astrologers. In addition to the motions of Earth and the Moon, they were able to fit in the\napproximately 12-year cycle of Jupiter, which was central to their system of astrology. The Chinese still\npreserve some aspects of this system in their cycle of 12 \u201cyears\u201d\u2014the Year of the Dragon, the Year of the Pig,\nand so on\u2014that are defined by the position of Jupiter in the zodiac.\nOur Western calendar derives from a long history of timekeeping beginning with the Sumerians, dating back\nto at least the second millennium BCE, and continuing with the Egyptians and the Greeks around the eighth\ncentury BCE. These calendars led, eventually, to theJulian calendar, introduced by Julius Caesar, which\napproximated the year at 365.25 days, fairly close to the actual value of 365.2422. The Romans achieved this\napproximation by declaring years to have 365 days each, with the exception of every fourth year. Theleap year\nwas to have one extra day, bringing its length to 366 days, and thus making the average length of the year in\nthe Julian calendar 365.25 days.\nIn this calendar, the Romans had dropped the almost impossible task of trying to base their calendar on the\nMoon as well as the Sun, although a vestige of older lunar systems can be seen in the fact that our months\nhave an average length of about 30 days. However, lunar calendars remained in use in other cultures, and\nIslamic calendars, for example, are still primarily lunar rather than solar.\nThe Gregorian Calendar\nAlthough the Julian calendar (which was adopted by the early Christian Church) represented a great advance,\nits average year still differed from the true year by about 11 minutes, an amount that accumulates over the\ncenturies to an appreciable error. By 1582, that 11 minutes per year had added up to the point where the first\nday of spring was occurring on March 11, instead of March 21. If the trend were allowed to continue,\neventually the Christian celebration of Easter would be occurring in early winter. Pope Gregory XIII, a\ncontemporary of Galileo, felt it necessary to institute further calendar reform.\nTheGregorian calendarreform consisted of two steps. First, 10 days had to be dropped out of the calendar to\nbring the vernal equinox back to March 21; by proclamation, the day following October 4, 1582, became\nOctober 15. The second feature of the new Gregorian calendar was a change in the rule for leap year, making\nthe average length of the year more closely approximate the tropical year. Gregory decreed that three of every\nfour century years\u2014all leap years under the Julian calendar\u2014would be common years henceforth. The rule\nwas that only century years divisible by 400 would be leap years. Thus, 1700, 1800, and 1900\u2014all divisible by 4\nbut not by 400\u2014were not leap years in the Gregorian calendar. On the other hand, the years 1600 and 2000,\nboth divisible by 400, were leap years. The average length of this Gregorian year, 365.2425 mean solar days, is\ncorrect to about 1 day in 3300 years.\nThe Catholic countries immediately put the Gregorian reform into effect, but countries of the Eastern Church\nand most Protestant countries did not adopt it until much later. It was 1752 when England and the American\ncolonies finally made the change. By parliamentary decree, September 2, 1752, was followed by September 14.\nAlthough special laws were passed to prevent such abuses as landlords collecting a full month\u2019s rent for\nSeptember, there were still riots, and people demanded their 12 days back. Russia did not abandon the Julian\ncalendar until the time of the Bolshevik revolution. The Russians then had to omit 13 days to come into step\nwith the rest of the world. The anniversary of the October Revolution (old calendar) of 1917, bringing the\ncommunists to power, thus ended up being celebrated in November (new calendar), a difference that is\nperhaps not so important since the fall of communism.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.5 \u2022 Phases and Motions of the Moon 111\n4.5 Phases and Motions of the Moon\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain the cause of the lunar phases\nUnderstand how the Moon rotates and revolves around Earth\nAfter the Sun, theMoonis the brightest and most obvious object in the sky. Unlike the Sun, it does not shine\nunder its own power, but merely glows with reflected sunlight. If you were to follow its progress in the sky for\na month, you would observe a cycle ofphases(different appearances), with the Moon starting dark and\ngetting more and more illuminated by sunlight over the course of about two weeks. After the Moon\u2019s disk\nbecomes fully bright, it begins to fade, returning to dark about two weeks later.\nThese changes fascinated and mystified many early cultures, which came up with marvelous stories and\nlegends to explain the cycle of the Moon. Even in the modern world, many people don\u2019t understand what\ncauses the phases, thinking that they are somehow related to the shadow of Earth. Let us see how the phases\ncan be explained by the motion of the Moon relative to the bright light source in the solar system, the Sun.\nLunar Phases\nAlthough we know that the Sun moves 1/12 of its path around the sky each month, for purposes of explaining\nthe phases, we can assume that the Sun\u2019s light comes from roughly the same direction during the course of a\nfour-week lunar cycle. The Moon, on the other hand, moves completely around Earth in that time. As we watch\nthe Moon from our vantage point on Earth, how much of its face we see illuminated by sunlight depends on\nthe angle the Sun makes with the Moon.\nHere is a simple experiment to show you what we mean: stand about 6 feet in front of a bright electric light in\na completely dark room (or outdoors at night) and hold in your hand a small round object such as a tennis ball\nor an orange. Your head can then represent Earth, the light represents the Sun, and the ball the Moon. Move\nthe ball around your head (making sure you don\u2019t cause an eclipse by blocking the light with your head). You\nwill see phases just like those of the Moon on the ball. (Another good way to get acquainted with the phases\nand motions of the Moon is to follow our satellite in the sky for a month or two, recording its shape, its\ndirection from the Sun, and when it rises and sets.)\nLet\u2019s examine the Moon\u2019s cycle of phases usingFigure 4.14, which depicts the Moon\u2019s behavior for the entire\nmonth. The trick to this figure is that you must imagine yourself standing on Earth, facing the Moon in each of\nits phases. So, for the position labeled \u201cNew,\u201d you are on the right side of Earth and it\u2019s the middle of the day;\nfor the position \u201cFull,\u201d you are on the left side of Earth in the middle of the night. Note that in every position\nonFigure 4.14, the Moon is half illuminated and half dark (as a ball in sunlight should be). The difference at\neach position has to do with what part of the Moon faces Earth. 112 4 \u2022 Earth, Moon, and Sky\nFigure4.14Phases of the Moon.The appearance of the Moon changes over the course of a complete monthly cycle. The pictures of\nthe Moon on the white circle show the perspective from space, with the Sun off to the right in a fixed position. The outer images\nshow how the Moon appears to you in the sky from each point in the orbit. Imagine yourself standing on Earth, facing the Moon at\neach stage. In the position \u201cNew,\u201d for example, you are facing the Moon from the right side of Earth in the middle of the day. (Note\nthat the distance of the Moon from Earth is not to scale in this diagram: the Moon is roughly 30 Earth-diameters away from us.)\n(credit: modification of work by NASA)\nThe Moon is said to benewwhen it is in the same general direction in the sky as the Sun (position A). Here, its\nilluminated (bright) side is turned away from us and its dark side is turned toward us. You might say that the\nSun is shining on the \u201cwrong \u201d side of the Moon from our perspective. In this phase the Moon is invisible to us;\nits dark, rocky surface does not give off any light of its own. Because the new moon is in the same part of the\nsky as the Sun, it rises at sunrise and sets at sunset.\nBut the Moon does not remain in this phase long because it moves eastward each day in its monthly path\naround us. Since it takes about 30 days to orbit Earth and there are 360\u00b0 in a circle, the Moon will move about\n12\u00b0 in the sky each day (or about 24 times its own diameter). A day or two after the new phase, the thin\ncrescentfirst appears, as we begin to see a small part of the Moon\u2019s illuminated hemisphere. It has moved\ninto a position where it now reflects a little sunlight toward us along one side. The bright crescent increases in\nsize on successive days as the Moon moves farther and farther around the sky away from the direction of the\nSun (position B). Because the Moon is moving eastward away from the Sun, it rises later and later each day\n(like a student during summer vacation).\nAfter about one week, the Moon is one-quarter of the way around its orbit (position C) and so we say it is at\nthefirst quarterphase. Half of the Moon\u2019s illuminated side is visible to Earth observers. Because of its\neastward motion, the Moon now lags about one-quarter of the day behind the Sun, rising around noon and\nsetting around midnight.\nDuring the week after the first quarter phase, we see more and more of the Moon\u2019s illuminated hemisphere\n(position D), a phase that is calledwaxing(or growing) gibbous (from the Latingibbus, meaning hump).\nEventually, the Moon arrives at position E in our figure, where it and the Sun are opposite each other in the\nsky. The side of the Moon turned toward the Sun is also turned toward Earth, and we have thefullphase.\nWhen the Moon is full, it is opposite the Sun in the sky. The Moon does the opposite of what the Sun does,\nrising at sunset and setting at sunrise. Note what that means in practice: the completely illuminated (and thus\nvery noticeable) Moon rises just as it gets dark, remains in the sky all night long, and sets as the Sun\u2019s first rays\nare seen at dawn. Its illumination throughout the night helps lovers on a romantic stroll and students finding\ntheir way back to their dorms after a long night in the library or an off-campus party.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.5 \u2022 Phases and Motions of the Moon 113\nAnd when is the full moon highest in the sky and most noticeable? At midnight, a time made famous in\ngenerations of horror novels and films. (Note how the behavior of a vampire like Dracula parallels the behavior\nof the full Moon: Dracula rises at sunset, does his worst mischief at midnight, and must be back down in his\ncoffin by sunrise. The old legends were a way of personifying the behavior of the Moon, which was a much\nmore dramatic part of people\u2019s lives in the days before electric lights and television.)\nFolklore has it that more crazy behavior is seen during the time of the full moon (the Moon even gives a name\nto crazy behavior\u2014\u201clunacy\u201d). But, in fact, statistical tests of this \u201chypothesis\u201d involving thousands of records\nfrom hospital emergency rooms and police files do not reveal any correlation of human behavior with the\nphases of the Moon. For example, homicides occur at the same rate during the new moon or the crescent\nmoon as during the full moon. Most investigators believe that the real story is not that more crazy behavior\nhappens on nights with a full moon, but rather that we are more likely to notice or remember such behavior\nwith the aid of a bright celestial light that is up all night long.\nDuring the two weeks following the full moon, the Moon goes through the same phases again in reverse order\n(points F, G, and H inFigure 4.14), returning to new phase after about 29.5 days. About a week after the full\nmoon, for example, the Moon is atthird quarter, meaning that it is three-quarters of the way around (not that\nit is three-quarters illuminated\u2014in fact, half of the visible side of the Moon is again dark). At this phase, the\nMoon is now rising around midnight and setting around noon.\nNote that there is one thing quite misleading aboutFigure 4.14. If you look at the Moon in position E, although\nit is full in theory, it appears as if its illumination would in fact be blocked by a big fat Earth, and hence we\nwould not see anything on the Moon except Earth\u2019s shadow. In reality, the Moon is nowhere near as close to\nEarth (nor is its path so identical with the Sun\u2019s in the sky) as this diagram (and the diagrams in most\ntextbooks) might lead you to believe.\nThe Moon is actually 30Earth-diametersaway from us;Science and the Universe: A Brief Tourcontains a\ndiagram that shows the two objects to scale. And, since the Moon\u2019s orbit is tilted relative to the path of the Sun\nin the sky, Earth\u2019s shadow misses the Moon most months. That\u2019s why we regularly get treated to a full moon.\nThe times when Earth\u2019s shadow does fall on the Moon are called lunar eclipses and are discussed inEclipses of\nthe Sun and Moon.\nMAKING CONNECTIONS\nAstronomy and the Days of the Week\nThe week seems independent of celestial motions, although its length may have been based on the time\nbetween quarter phases of the Moon. In Western culture, the seven days of the week are named after the\nseven \u201cwanderers\u201d that the ancients saw in the sky: the Sun, the Moon, and the five planets visible to the\nunaided eye (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn).\nIn English, we can easily recognize the names Sun-day (Sunday), Moon-day (Monday), and Saturn-day\n(Saturday), but the other days are named after the Norse equivalents of the Roman gods that gave their\nnames to the planets. In languages more directly related to Latin, the correspondences are clearer.\nWednesday, Mercury\u2019s day, for example, ismercolediin Italian,mercrediin French, andmi\u00e9rcolesin\nSpanish. Mars gives its name to Tuesday (martesin Spanish), Jupiter or Jove to Thursday (giovediin Italian),\nand Venus to Friday (vendrediin French).\nThere is no reason that the week has to have seven days rather than five or eight. It is interesting to\nspeculate that if we had lived in a planetary system where more planets were visible without a telescope,\nthe Beatles could have been right and we might well have had \u201cEight Days a Week.\u201d 114 4 \u2022 Earth, Moon, and Sky\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThissimulation of the Moon orbiting the Earth(https://openstax.org/l/30moonorbit)shows both a \u201ctop-\ndown\u201d view and the view from Earth\u2019s surface.\nThe Moon\u2019s Revolution and Rotation\nThe Moon\u2019s sidereal period\u2014that is, the period of its revolution about Earth measured with respect to the\nstars\u2014is a little over 27 days: thesidereal monthis 27.3217 days to be exact. The time interval in which the\nphases repeat\u2014say, from full to full\u2014is thesolar month, 29.5306 days. The difference results from Earth\u2019s\nmotion around the Sun. TheMoonmust make more than a complete turn around the moving Earth to get\nback to the same phase with respect to the Sun. As we saw, the Moon changes its position on the celestial\nsphere rather rapidly: even during a single evening, the Moon creeps visibly eastward among the stars,\ntraveling its own width in a little less than 1 hour. The delay in moonrise from one day to the next caused by\nthis eastward motion averages about 50 minutes.\nThe Moonrotateson its axis in exactly the same time that it takes torevolveabout Earth. As a consequence,\nthe Moon always keeps the same face turned toward Earth (Figure 4.15). You can simulate this yourself by\n\u201corbiting\u201d your roommate or another volunteer. Start by facing your roommate. If you make one rotation\n(spin) with your shoulders in the exact same time that you revolve around him or her, you will continue to face\nyour roommate during the whole \u201corbit.\u201d As we will see in coming chapters, our Moon is not the only world\nthat exhibits this behavior, which scientists callsynchronous rotation.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.5 \u2022 Phases and Motions of the Moon 115\nFigure4.15The Moon without and with Rotation.In this figure, we stuck a white arrow into a fixed point on theMoonto keep\ntrack of its sides. (a) If the Moon did not rotate as it orbited Earth, it would present all of its sides to our view; hence the white arrow\nwould point directly toward Earth only in the bottom position on the diagram. (b) Actually, the Moon rotates in the same period that\nit revolves, so we always see the same side (the white arrow keeps pointing to Earth).\nThe differences in the Moon\u2019s appearance from one night to the next are due to changing illumination by the\nSun, not to its own rotation. You sometimes hear the back side of the Moon (the side we never see) called the\n\u201cdark side.\u201d This is a misunderstanding of the real situation: which side is light and which is dark changes as\nthe Moon moves around Earth. The back side is dark no more frequently than the front side. Since the Moon\nrotates, the Sun rises and sets on all sides of the Moon. With apologies to Pink Floyd, there is simply no regular\n\u201cDark Side of the Moon.\u201d 116 4 \u2022 Earth, Moon, and Sky\n4.6 Ocean Tides and the Moon\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe what causes tides on Earth\nExplain why the amplitude of tides changes during the course of a month\nAnyone living near the sea is familiar with the twice-daily rising and falling of thetides. Early in history, it was\nclear that tides must be related to theMoonbecause the daily delay in high tide is the same as the daily delay\nin the Moon\u2019s rising. A satisfactory explanation of the tides, however, awaited the theory of gravity, supplied\nby Newton.\nThe Pull of the Moon on Earth\nThe gravitational forces exerted by the Moon at several points on Earth are illustrated inFigure 4.16. These\nforces differ slightly from one another because Earth is not a point, but has a certain size: all parts are not\nequally distant from the Moon, nor are they all in exactly the same direction from the Moon. Moreover, Earth is\nnot perfectly rigid. As a result, the differences among the forces of the Moon\u2019s attraction on different parts of\nEarth (calleddifferential forces) cause Earth to distort slightly. The side of Earth nearest the Moon is attracted\ntoward the Moon more strongly than is the center of Earth, which in turn is attracted more strongly than is the\nside opposite the Moon. Thus, the differential forces tend to stretch Earth slightly into anoblate spheroid\n(which is something like an American football shape), with its long diameter pointed toward the Moon.\nFigure4.16Pull of the Moon.The Moon\u2019s differential attraction is shown on different parts of Earth. (Note that the differences have\nbeen exaggerated for educational purposes.)\nIf Earth were made of water, it would distort until the Moon\u2019s differential forces over different parts of its\nsurface came into balance with Earth\u2019s own gravitational forces pulling it together. Calculations show that in\nthis case, Earth would distort from a sphere by amounts ranging up to nearly 1 meter. Measurements of the\nactual deformation of Earth show that the solid Earth does distort, but only about one-third as much as water\nwould, because of the greater rigidity of Earth\u2019s interior.\nBecause the tidal distortion of the solid Earth amounts\u2014at its greatest\u2014to only about 20 centimeters, Earth\ndoes not distort enough to balance the Moon\u2019s differential forces with its own gravity. Hence, objects at\nEarth\u2019s surface experience tiny horizontal tugs, tending to make them slide about. Thesetide-raising forces\nare too insignificant to affect solid objects like astronomy students or rocks in Earth\u2019s crust, but they do affect\nthe waters in the oceans.\nThe Formation of Tides\nThe tide-raising forces, acting over a number of hours, produce motions of the water that result in measurable\ntidal bulges in the oceans. Water on the side of Earth facing the Moon flows toward it, with the greatest depths\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.6 \u2022 Ocean Tides and the Moon 117\nroughly at the point below the Moon. On the side of Earth opposite the Moon, water also flows to produce a\ntidal bulge (Figure 4.17).\nFigure4.17Tidal Bulges in an \u201cIdeal\u201d Ocean.Differences in gravity cause tidal forces that push water in the direction of tidal\nbulges on Earth.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nYou can run thisanimation(https://openstax.org/l/30visdemotidal)for a visual demonstration of the tidal\nbulge.\nNote that the tidal bulges in the oceans do not result from the Moon\u2019s compressing or expanding the water,\nnor from the Moon\u2019s lifting the water \u201caway from Earth.\u201d Rather, they result from an actual flow of water over\nEarth\u2019s surface toward the two regions below and opposite the Moon, causing the water to pile up to greater\ndepths at those places (Figure 4.18).\nFigure4.18High and Low Tides.This is a side-by-side comparison of the Bay of Fundy in Canada at high and low tides. (credit a, b:\nmodification of work by Dylan Kereluk)\nIn the idealized (and, as we shall see, oversimplified) model just described, the height of the tides would be\nonly a few feet. The rotation of Earth would carry an observer at any given place alternately into regions of\ndeeper and shallower water. An observer being carried toward the regions under or opposite the Moon, where\nthe water was deepest, would say, \u201cThe tide is coming in\u201d; when carried away from those regions, the\nobserver would say, \u201cThe tide is going out.\u201d During a day, the observer would be carried through two tidal\nbulges (one on each side of Earth) and so would experience two high tides and two low tides.\nThe Sun also produces tides on Earth, although it is less than half as effective as the Moon at tide raising. The\nactual tides we experience are a combination of the larger effect of the Moon and the smaller effect of the\nSun. When the Sun and Moon are lined up (at new moon or full moon), the tides produced reinforce each 118 4 \u2022 Earth, Moon, and Sky\nother and so are greater than normal (Figure 4.19). These are called spring tides (the name is connected not to\nthe season but to the idea that higher tides \u201cspring up\u201d). Spring tides are approximately the same, whether\nthe Sun and Moon are on the same or opposite sides of Earth, because tidal bulges occur on both sides. When\nthe Moon is at first quarter or last quarter (at right angles to the Sun\u2019s direction), the tides produced by the\nSun partially cancel the tides of the Moon, making them lower than usual. These are called neap tides.\nFigure4.19Tides Caused by Different Alignments of the Sun and Moon.(a) In spring tides, the Sun\u2019s and Moon\u2019s pulls reinforce\neach other. (b) In neap tides, the Sun and the Moon pull at right angles to each other and the resulting tides are lower than usual.\nThe \u201csimple\u201d theory of tides, described in the preceding paragraphs, would be sufficient if Earth rotated very\nslowly and were completely surrounded by very deep oceans. However, the presence of land masses stopping\nthe flow of water, the friction in the oceans and between oceans and the ocean floors, the rotation of Earth,\nthe wind, the variable depth of the ocean, and other factors all complicate the picture. This is why, in the real\nworld, some places have very small tides while in other places huge tides become tourist attractions. If you\nhave been in such places, you may know that \u201ctide tables\u201d need to be computed and published for each\nlocation; one set of tide predictions doesn\u2019t work for the whole planet. In this introductory chapter, we won\u2019t\ndelve further into these complexities.\nVOYAGERS IN ASTRONOMY\nGeorge Darwin and the Slowing of Earth\nThe rubbing of water over the face of Earth involves an enormous amount of energy. Over long periods of\ntime, the friction of the tides is slowing down the rotation of Earth. Our day gets longer by about 0.002\nsecond each century. That seems very small, but such tiny changes can add up over millions and billions of\nyears.\nAlthough Earth\u2019s spin is slowing down, the angular momentum (seeOrbits and Gravity) in a system such as\nthe Earth-Moon system cannot change. Thus, some other spin motion must speed up to take the extra\nangular momentum. The details of what happens were worked out over a century ago by GeorgeDarwin,\nthe son of naturalist Charles Darwin. George Darwin (seeFigure 4.20) had a strong interest in science but\nstudied law for six years and was admitted to the bar. However, he never practiced law, returning to science\ninstead and eventually becoming a professor at Cambridge University. He was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Lord Kelvin, one\nof the great physicists of the nineteenth century, and he became interested in the long-term evolution of\nthe solar system. He specialized in making detailed (and difficult) mathematical calculations of how orbits\nand motions change over geologic time.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.7 \u2022 Eclipses of the Sun and Moon 119\nFigure4.20George Darwin (1845\u20131912).George Darwin is best known for studying Earth\u2019s spin in relation to angular\nmomentum.\nWhat Darwin calculated for the Earth-Moon system was that the Moon will slowly spiral outward, away from\nEarth. As it moves farther away, it will orbit less quickly (just as planets farther from the Sun move more\nslowly in their orbits). Thus, the month will get longer. Also, because the Moon will be more distant, total\neclipses of the Sun will no longer be visible from Earth.\nBoth the day and the month will continue to get longer, although bear in mind that the effects are very\ngradual. Darwin\u2019s calculations were confirmed by mirrors placed on the Moon by Apollo 11 astronauts.\nThese show that the Moon is moving away by 3.8 centimeters per year, and that ultimately\u2014billions of\nyears in the future\u2014the day and the month will be the same length (about 47 of our present days). At this\npoint the Moon will be stationary in the sky over the same spot on Earth, meaning some parts of Earth will\nsee the Moon and its phases and other parts will never see them. This kind of alignment is already true for\nPluto\u2019s moon Charon (among others). Its rotation and orbital period are the same length as a day on Pluto.\n4.7 Eclipses of the Sun and Moon\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe what causes lunar and solar eclipses\nDifferentiate between a total and partial solar eclipse\nExplain why lunar eclipses are much more common than solar eclipses\nOne of the coincidences of living onEarthat the present time is that the two most prominent astronomical\nobjects, theSunand theMoon, have nearly the same apparent size in the sky. Although the Sun is about 400\ntimes larger in diameter than the Moon, it is also about 400 times farther away, so both the Sun and the Moon\nhave the same angular size\u2014about 1/2\u00b0. As a result, the Moon, as seen from Earth, can appear to cover the\nSun, producing one of the most impressive events in nature.\nAny solid object in the solar system casts a shadow by blocking the light of the Sun from a region behind it.\nThis shadow in space becomes apparent whenever another object moves into it. In general, aneclipseoccurs\nwhenever any part of either Earth or the Moon enters the shadow of the other. When the Moon\u2019s shadow\nstrikes Earth, people within that shadow see the Sun at least partially covered by the Moon; that is, they\nwitness asolar eclipse. When the Moon passes into the shadow of Earth, people on the night side of Earth see\nthe Moon darken in what is called alunar eclipse. Let\u2019s look at how these happen in more detail. 120 4 \u2022 Earth, Moon, and Sky\nThe shadows of Earth and the Moon consist of two parts: a cone where the shadow is darkest, called the\numbra, and a lighter, more diffuse region of darkness called thepenumbra. As you can imagine, the most\nspectacular eclipses occur when an object enters the umbra.Figure 4.21illustrates the appearance of the\nMoon\u2019s shadow and what the Sun and Moon would look like from different points within the shadow.\nFigure4.21Solar Eclipse.(a) The shadow cast by a spherical body (the Moon, for example) is shown. Notice the dark umbra and the\nlighter penumbra. Four points in the shadow are labeled with numbers. In (b) you see what the Sun and Moon would look like in the\nsky at the four labeled points. At position 1, you see a total eclipse. At positions 2 and 3, the eclipse is partial. At position 4, the Moon\nis farther away and thus cannot cover the Sun completely; a ring of light thus shows around the Sun, creating what is called an\n\u201cannular\u201d eclipse.\nIf the path of the Moon in the sky were identical to the path of the Sun (the ecliptic), we might expect to see an\neclipse of the Sun and the Moon each month\u2014whenever the Moon got in front of the Sun or into the shadow\nof Earth. However, as we mentioned, the Moon\u2019s orbit is tilted relative to the plane of Earth\u2019s orbit about the\nSun by about 5\u00b0 (imagine two hula hoops with a common center, but tilted a bit). As a result, during most\nmonths, the Moon is sufficiently above or below the ecliptic plane to avoid an eclipse. But when the two paths\ncross (twice a year), it is then \u201ceclipse season\u201d and eclipses are possible.\nEclipses of the Sun\nThe apparent or angular sizes of both the Sun and Moon vary slightly from time to time as their distances from\nEarth vary. (Figure 4.21shows the distance of the observer varying at points 1\u20134, but the idea is the same.)\nMuch of the time, the Moon looks slightly smaller than the Sun and cannot cover it completely, even if the two\nare perfectly aligned. In this type of \u201cannular eclipse,\u201d there is a ring of light around the dark sphere of the\nMoon.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.7 \u2022 Eclipses of the Sun and Moon 121\nHowever, if an eclipse of the Sun occurs when the Moon is somewhat nearer than its average distance, the\nMoon can completely hide the Sun, producing atotalsolar eclipse. Another way to say it is that atotal eclipse\nof the Sun occurs at those times when the umbra of the Moon\u2019s shadow reaches the surface of Earth.\nThe geometry of a total solar eclipse is illustrated inFigure 4.22. If the Sun and Moon are properly aligned,\nthen the Moon\u2019s darkest shadow intersects the ground at a small point on Earth\u2019s surface. Anyone on Earth\nwithin the small area covered by the tip of the Moon\u2019s shadow will, for a few minutes, be unable to see the Sun\nand will witness a total eclipse. At the same time, observers on a larger area of Earth\u2019s surface who are in the\npenumbra will see only a part of the Sun eclipsed by the Moon: we call this apartialsolar eclipse.\nBetween Earth\u2019s rotation and the motion of the Moon in its orbit, the tip of the Moon\u2019s shadow sweeps\neastward at about 1500 kilometers per hour along a thin band across the surface of Earth. The thin zone\nacross Earth within which a total solar eclipse is visible (weather permitting) is called the eclipse path. Within a\nregion about 3000 kilometers on either side of the eclipse path, a partial solar eclipse is visible. It does not take\nlong for the Moon\u2019s shadow to sweep past a given point on Earth. The duration of totality may be only a brief\ninstant; it can never exceed about 7 minutes.\nFigure4.22Geometry of a Total Solar Eclipse.Note that our diagram is not to scale. The Moon blocks the Sun during new moon\nphase as seen from some parts of Earth and casts a shadow on our planet.\nBecause a total eclipse of the Sun is so spectacular, it is well worth trying to see one if you can. There are some\npeople whose hobby is \u201ceclipse chasing\u201d and who brag about how many they have seen in their lifetimes.\nBecause much of Earth\u2019s surface is water, eclipse chasing can involve lengthy boat trips (and often requires air\ntravel as well). As a result, eclipse chasing is rarely within the budget of a typical college student. Nevertheless,\na list of future eclipses is given for your reference inAppendix H, just in case you strike it rich early. (And, as\nyou can see in the Appendix, there will be total eclipses visible in the United States in 2017 and 2024, to which\neven college students may be able to afford travel.)\nAppearance of a Total Eclipse\nWhat can you see if you are lucky enough to catch a total eclipse? A solar eclipse starts when the Moon just\nbegins to silhouette itself against the edge of the Sun\u2019s disk. A partial phase follows, during which more and\nmore of the Sun is covered by the Moon. About an hour after the eclipse begins, the Sun becomes completely\nhidden behind the Moon. In the few minutes immediately before this period of totality begins, the sky\nnoticeably darkens, some flowers close up, and chickens may go to roost. As an eerie twilight suddenly\ndescends during the day, other animals (and people) may get disoriented. During totality, the sky is dark\nenough that planets become visible in the sky, and usually the brighter stars do as well. 122 4 \u2022 Earth, Moon, and Sky\nAs the bright disk of the Sun becomes entirely hidden behind the Moon, the Sun\u2019s remarkable corona flashes\ninto view (Figure 4.23). Thecoronais the Sun\u2019s outer atmosphere, consisting of sparse gases that extend for\nmillions of miles in all directions from the apparent surface of the Sun. It is ordinarily not visible because the\nlight of the corona is feeble compared with the light from the underlying layers of the Sun. Only when the\nbrilliant glare from the Sun\u2019s visible disk is blotted out by the Moon during a total eclipse is the pearly white\ncorona visible. (We\u2019ll talk more about the corona in the chapter onThe Sun: A Garden-Variety Star.)\nFigure4.23The Sun\u2019s Corona.The corona (thin outer atmosphere) of the Sun is visible during a total solar eclipse. (It looks more\nextensive in photographs than it would to the unaided eye.) (credit: modification of work by Lutfar Rahman Nirjhar)\nThe total phase of the eclipse ends, as abruptly as it began, when the Moon begins to uncover the Sun.\nGradually, the partial phases of the eclipse repeat themselves, in reverse order, until the Moon has completely\nuncovered the Sun. We should make one important safety point here: while the few minutes of thetotal\neclipse are safe to look at, if any part of the Sun is uncovered, you must protect your eyes with safe eclipse\n2\nglasses or by projecting an image of the Sun (instead of looking at it directly). For more, read theHow to\nObserve Solar Eclipsesbox in this chapter.\nEclipses of the Moon\nA lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon enters the shadow of Earth. The geometry of a lunar eclipse is shown in\nFigure 4.24. Earth\u2019s dark shadow is about 1.4 million kilometers long, so at the Moon\u2019s distance (an average of\n384,000 kilometers), it could cover about four full moons. Unlike a solar eclipse, which is visible only in certain\nlocal areas on Earth, a lunar eclipse is visible to everyone who can see the Moon. Because a lunar eclipse can\nbe seen (weather permitting) from the entire night side of Earth, lunar eclipses are observed far more\nfrequently from a given place on Earth than are solar eclipses.\n2 Eclipse glasses are available in many planetarium and observatory gift stores, and also from the two main U.S. manufacturers:\nAmerican Paper Optics and Rainbow Symphony.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.7 \u2022 Eclipses of the Sun and Moon 123\nFigure4.24Geometry of a Lunar Eclipse.The Moon is shown moving through the different parts of Earth\u2019s shadow during a total\nlunar eclipse. Note that the distance the Moon moves in its orbit during the eclipse has been exaggerated here for clarity.\nAn eclipse of the Moon is total only if the Moon\u2019s path carries it though Earth\u2019s umbra. If the Moon does not\nenter the umbra completely, we have apartial eclipseof the Moon. But because Earth is larger than the Moon,\nits umbra is larger, so that lunar eclipses last longer than solar eclipses, as we will discuss below.\nA lunar eclipse can take place only when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are in a line. The Moon is opposite the Sun,\nwhich means the Moon will be in full phase before the eclipse, making the darkening even more dramatic.\nAbout 20 minutes before the Moon reaches the dark shadow, it dims somewhat as Earth partly blocks the\nsunlight. As the Moon begins to dip into the shadow, the curved shape of Earth\u2019s shadow upon it soon\nbecomes apparent.\nEven when totally eclipsed, the Moon is still faintly visible, usually appearing a dull coppery red. The\nillumination on the eclipsed Moon is sunlight that has been bent into Earth\u2019s shadow by passing through\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere.\nAfter totality, the Moon moves out of the shadow and the sequence of events is reversed. The total duration of\nthe eclipse depends on how closely the Moon\u2019s path approaches the axis of the shadow. For an eclipse where\nthe Moon goes through the center of Earth\u2019s shadow, each partial phase consumes at least 1 hour, and totality\ncan last as long as 1 hour and 40 minutes. Eclipses of the Moon are much more \u201cdemocratic\u201d than solar\neclipses. Since the full moon is visible on the entire night side of Earth, the lunar eclipse is visible for all those\nwho live in that hemisphere. (Recall that a total eclipse of the Sun is visible only in a narrow path where the\nshadow of the umbra falls.) Total eclipses of the Moon occur, on average, about once every two or three years.\nA list of future total eclipses of the Moon is inAppendix H. In addition, since the lunar eclipse happens to a full\nmoon, and a full moon is not dangerous to look at, everyone can look at the Moon during all the parts of the\neclipse without worrying about safety.\nThanks to our understanding of gravity and motion (seeOrbits and Gravity), eclipses can now be predicted\ncenturies in advance. We\u2019ve come a long way since humanity stood frightened by the darkening of the Sun or\nthe Moon, fearing the displeasure of the gods. Today, we enjoy the sky show with a healthy appreciation of the\nmajestic forces that keep our solar system running.\nUse theSolar and Lunar Eclipse simulation(https://openstax.org/l/30solueclips)to explore the conditions of\nsolar and lunar eclipses yourself. 124 4 \u2022 Earth, Moon, and Sky\nSEEING FOR YOURSELF\nHow to Observe Solar Eclipses\nA total eclipse of the Sun is a spectacular sight and should not be missed. However, it is extremely\ndangerous to look directly at the Sun: even a brief exposure can damage your eyes. Normally, few rational\npeople are tempted to do this because it is painful (and something your mother told you never to do!). But\nduring the partial phases of a solar eclipse, the temptation to take a look is strong. Think before you give in.\nThe fact that the Moon is covering part of the Sun doesn\u2019t make the uncovered part any less dangerous to\nlook at. Still, there are perfectly safe ways to follow the course of a solar eclipse, if you are lucky enough to\nbe in the path of the shadow.\nThe easiest technique is to make a pinhole projector. Take a piece of cardboard with a small (1 millimeter)\nhole punched in it, and hold it several feet above a light surface, such as a concrete sidewalk or a white\nsheet of paper, so that the hole is \u201caimed\u201d at the Sun. The hole produces a fuzzy but adequate image of the\neclipsed Sun. Alternatively, if it\u2019s the right time of year, you can let the tiny spaces between a tree\u2019s leaves\nform multiple pinhole images against a wall or sidewalk. Watching hundreds of little crescent Suns dancing\nin the breeze can be captivating. A kitchen colander also makes an excellent pinhole projector.\nAlthough there are safe filters for looking at the Sun directly, people have suffered eye damage by looking\nthrough improper filters, or no filter at all. For example, neutral density photographic filters are not safe\nbecause they transmit infrared radiation that can cause severe damage to the retina. Also unsafe are\nsmoked glass, completely exposed color film, sunglasses, and many other homemade filters. Safe filters\ninclude welders\u2019 goggles and specially designed eclipse glasses.\nYou should certainly look at the Sun directly when it is totally eclipsed, even through binoculars or\ntelescopes. Unfortunately, the total phase, as we discussed, is all too brief. But if you know when it is\ncoming and going, be sure you look, for it\u2019s an unforgettably beautiful sight. And, despite the ancient\nfolklore that presents eclipses as dangerous times to be outdoors, the partial phases of eclipses\u2014as long as\nyou are not looking directly at the Sun\u2014are not any more dangerous than being out in sunlight.\nDuring past eclipses, unnecessary panic has been created by uninformed public officials acting with the\nbest intentions. There were two marvelous total eclipses in Australia in the twentieth century during which\ntownspeople held newspapers over their heads for protection and schoolchildren cowered indoors with\ntheir heads under their desks. What a pity that all those people missed what would have been one of the\nmost memorable experiences of their lifetimes.\nOn August 21, 2017, a total eclipse of the Sun was visible across a large swath of the continental United\nStates, and was seen by millions of people from around the country and the world (a).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4.7 \u2022 Eclipses of the Sun and Moon 125\nFigure4.252017 Total Solar and Lunar Eclipse(a) The eclipsed Sun August 21, 2017, showing remarkable detail in the Sun\u2019s\nouter atmosphere.

The Moon moves slowly\ninto the Earth\u2019s shadow, looks red when the eclipse is total and red sunlight refracts through the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, and then\nslowly moves out of the shadow.

Longitude is\narbitrarily set to 0\u00b0 at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, England. An analogous celestial coordinate system\nis called right ascension (RA) and declination, with 0\u00b0 of declination starting at the vernal equinox. These\ncoordinate systems help us locate any object on the celestial sphere. The Foucault pendulum is a way to\ndemonstrate that Earth is turning.\n4.2The Seasons\nThe familiar cycle of the seasons results from the 23.5\u00b0 tilt of Earth\u2019s axis of rotation. At the summer solstice,\nthe Sun is higher in the sky and its rays strike Earth more directly. The Sun is in the sky for more than half of\nthe day and can heat Earth longer. At the winter solstice, the Sun is low in the sky and its rays come in at more\nof an angle; in addition, it is up for fewer than 12 hours, so those rays have less time to heat. At the vernal and\nautumnal equinoxes, the Sun is on the celestial equator and we get about 12 hours of day and night. The\nseasons are different at different latitudes.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 4 \u2022 For Further Exploration 127\n4.3Keeping Time\nThe basic unit of astronomical time is the day\u2014either the solar day (reckoned by the Sun) or the sidereal day\n(reckoned by the stars). Apparent solar time is based on the position of the Sun in the sky, and mean solar\ntime is based on the average value of a solar day during the year. By international agreement, we define 24\ntime zones around the world, each with its own standard time. The convention of the International Date Line is\nnecessary to reconcile times on different parts of Earth.\n4.4The Calendar\nThe fundamental problem of the calendar is to reconcile the incommensurable lengths of the day, month, and\nyear. Most modern calendars, beginning with the Roman (Julian) calendar of the first century BCE, neglect the\nproblem of the month and concentrate on achieving the correct number of days in a year by using such\nconventions as the leap year. Today, most of the world has adopted the Gregorian calendar established in\n1582 while finding ways to coexist with the older lunar calendars\u2019 system of months.\n4.5Phases and Motions of the Moon\nThe Moon\u2019s monthly cycle of phases results from the changing angle of its illumination by the Sun. The full\nmoon is visible in the sky only during the night; other phases are visible during the day as well. Because its\nperiod of revolution is the same as its period of rotation, the Moon always keeps the same face toward Earth.\n4.6Ocean Tides and the Moon\nThe twice-daily ocean tides are primarily the result of the Moon\u2019s differential force on the material of Earth\u2019s\ncrust and ocean. These tidal forces cause ocean water to flow into two tidal bulges on opposite sides of Earth;\neach day, Earth rotates through these bulges. Actual ocean tides are complicated by the additional effects of\nthe Sun and by the shape of the coasts and ocean basins.\n4.7Eclipses of the Sun and Moon\nThe Sun and Moon have nearly the same angular size (about 1/2\u00b0). A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon\nmoves between the Sun and Earth, casting its shadow on a part of Earth\u2019s surface. If the eclipse is total, the\nlight from the bright disk of the Sun is completely blocked, and the solar atmosphere (the corona) comes into\nview. Solar eclipses take place rarely in any one location, but they are among the most spectacular sights in\nnature. A lunar eclipse takes place when the Moon moves into Earth\u2019s shadow; it is visible (weather\npermitting) from the entire night hemisphere of Earth.\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nBakich, M. \u201cYour Twenty-Year Solar Eclipse Planner.\u201dAstronomy(October 2008): 74.

Yet we very much want to know what material this neighbor star is composed of and how it\ndiffers from our own Sun. How can we learn about the chemical makeup of stars that we cannot hope to visit\nor sample?\nIn astronomy, most of the objects that we study are completely beyond our reach. The temperature of the Sun\nis so high that a spacecraft would be fried long before it reached it, and the stars are much too far away to visit\nin our lifetimes with the technology now available. Even light, which travels at a speed of 300,000 kilometers\nper second (km/s), takes more than 4 years to reach us from the nearest star. If we want to learn about the\nSun and stars, we must rely on techniques that allow us to analyze them from a distance. 136 5 \u2022 Radiation and Spectra\n5.1 The Behavior of Light\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain the evidence for Maxwell\u2019s electromagnetic model of light\nDescribe the relationship between wavelength, frequency, and speed of light\nDiscuss the particle model of light and the definition of photon\nExplain how and why the amount of light we see from an object depends upon its distance\nCoded into the light and other kinds of radiation that reach us from objects in the universe is a wide range of\ninformation about what those objects are like and how they work. If we can decipher this code and read the\nmessages it contains, we can learn an enormous amount about the cosmos without ever having to leave Earth\nor its immediate environment.\nThe visible light and other radiation we receive from the stars and planets is generated by processes at the\natomic level\u2014by changes in the way the parts of an atom interact and move. Thus, to appreciate how light is\ngenerated, we must explore how atoms work. There is a bit of irony in the fact that in order to understand\nsome of the largest structures in the universe, we must become acquainted with some of the smallest.\nNotice that we have twice used the phrase \u201clight and other radiation.\u201d One of the key ideas explored in this\nchapter is that visible light is not unique; it is merely the most familiar example of a much larger family of\nradiation that can carry information to us.\nThe word \u201cradiation\u201d will be used frequently in this book, so it is important to understand what it means. In\neveryday language, \u201cradiation\u201d is often used to describe certain kinds of energetic subatomic particles\nreleased by radioactive materials in our environment. (An example is the kind of radiation used to treat some\ncancers.) But this is not what we mean when we use the word \u201cradiation\u201d in an astronomy text.Radiation, as\nused in this book, is a general term for waves (including light waves) thatradiateoutward from a source.\nAs we saw inOrbits and Gravity, Newton\u2019s theory of gravity accounts for the motions of planets as well as\nobjects on Earth. Application of this theory to a variety of problems dominated the work of scientists for nearly\ntwo centuries. In the nineteenth century, many physicists turned to the study of electricity and magnetism,\nwhich are intimately connected with the production of light.\nThe scientist who played a role in this field comparable to Newton\u2019s role in the study of gravity was physicist\nJames ClerkMaxwell, born and educated in Scotland (Figure 5.2). Inspired by a number of ingenious\nexperiments that showed an intimate relationship between electricity and magnetism, Maxwell developed a\ntheory that describes both electricity and magnetism with only a small number of elegant equations. It is this\ntheory that gives us important insights into the nature and behavior of light.\nFigure5.2James Clerk Maxwell (1831\u20131879).Maxwell unified the rules governing electricity and magnetism into a coherent theory.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.1 \u2022 The Behavior of Light 137\nMaxwell\u2019s Theory of Electromagnetism\nWe will look at the structure of the atom in more detail later, but we begin by noting that the typical atom\nconsists of several types of particles, a number of which have not only mass but an additional property called\nelectric charge. In the nucleus (central part) of every atom areprotons, which are positively charged; outside\nthe nucleus are electrons, which have a negative charge.\nMaxwell\u2019s theory deals with these electric charges and their effects, especially when they are moving. In the\nvicinity of an electron charge, another charge feels a force of attraction or repulsion: opposite charges attract;\nlike charges repel. When charges are not in motion, we observe only this electric attraction or repulsion. If\ncharges are in motion, however (as they are inside every atom and in a wire carrying a current), then we\nmeasure another force calledmagnetism.\nMagnetism was well known for much of recorded human history, but its cause was not understood until the\nnineteenth century. Experiments with electric charges demonstrated thatmagnetismwas the result of moving\ncharged particles. Sometimes, the motion is clear, as in the coils of heavy wire that make an industrial\nelectromagnet. Other times, it is more subtle, as in the kind of magnet you buy in a hardware store, in which\nmany of the electrons inside the atoms are spinning in roughly the same direction; it is the alignment of their\nmotion that causes the material to become magnetic.\nPhysicists use the wordfieldto describe the action of forces that one object exerts on other distant objects. For\nexample, we say the Sun produces agravitational fieldthat controls Earth\u2019s orbit, even though the Sun and\nEarth do not come directly into contact. Using this terminology, we can say that stationary electric charges\nproduceelectric fields, and moving electric charges also producemagnetic fields.\nActually, the relationship between electric and magnetic phenomena is even more profound. Experiments\nshowed that changing magnetic fields could produce electric currents (and thus changing electric fields), and\nchanging electric currents could in turn produce changing magnetic fields. So once begun, electric and\nmagnetic field changes could continue to trigger each other.\nMaxwellanalyzed what would happen if electric charges were oscillating (moving constantly back and forth)\nand found that the resulting pattern of electric and magnetic fields would spread out and travel rapidly\nthrough space. Something similar happens when a raindrop strikes the surface of water or a frog jumps into a\npond. The disturbance moves outward and creates a pattern we call awavein the water (Figure 5.3). You\nmight, at first, think that there must be very few situations in nature where electric charges oscillate, but this is\nnot at all the case. As we shall see, atoms and molecules (which consist of charged particles) oscillate back and\nforth all the time. The resulting electromagnetic disturbances are among the most common phenomena in the\nuniverse. 138 5 \u2022 Radiation and Spectra\nFigure5.3Making Waves.An oscillation in a pool of water creates an expanding disturbance called a wave. (credit: modification of\nwork by \"vastateparksstaff\"/Flickr)\nMaxwell was able to calculate the speed at which an electromagnetic disturbance moves through space; he\nfound that it is equal to the speed of light, which had been measured experimentally. On that basis, he\nspeculated that light was one form of a family of possible electromagnetic disturbances called\nelectromagnetic radiation, a conclusion that was again confirmed in laboratory experiments. When light\n(reflected from the pages of an astronomy textbook, for example) enters a human eye, its changing electric\nand magnetic fields stimulate nerve endings, which then transmit the information contained in these changing\nfields to the brain. The science of astronomy is primarily about analyzing radiation from distant objects to\nunderstand what they are and how they work.\nThe Wave-Like Characteristics of Light\nThe changing electric and magnetic fields in light are similar to thewavesthat can be set up in a quiet pool of\nwater. In both cases, the disturbance travels rapidly outward from the point of origin and can use its energy to\ndisturb other things farther away. (For example, in water, the expanding ripples moving away from our frog\ncould disturb the peace of a dragonfly resting on a leaf in the same pool.) In the case of electromagnetic\nwaves, the radiation generated by a transmitting antenna full of charged particles and moving electrons at\nyour local radio station can, sometime later, disturb a group of electrons in your car radio antenna and bring\nyou the news and weather while you are driving to class or work in the morning.\nThe waves generated by charged particles differ from water waves in some profound ways, however. Water\nwaves require water to travel in. The sound waves we hear, to give another example, are pressure\ndisturbances that require air to travel though. But electromagnetic waves do not require water or air: the\nfields generate each other and so can move through a vacuum (such as outer space). This was such a\ndisturbing idea to nineteenth-century scientists that they actually made up a substance to fill all of space\u2014one\nfor which there was not a single shred of evidence\u2014just so light waves could have something to travel\nthrough: they called it theaether. Today, we know that there is no aether and that electromagnetic waves have\nno trouble at all moving through empty space (as all the starlight visible on a clear night must surely be\ndoing).\nThe other difference is thatallelectromagnetic waves move at the same speed in empty space (the speed of\nlight\u2014approximately 300,000 kilometers per second, or 300,000,000 meters per second, which can also be\nwritten as 3 \u00d7 108m/s), which turns out to be the fastest possible speed in the universe. No matter where\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.1 \u2022 The Behavior of Light 139\nelectromagnetic waves are generated from and no matter what other properties they have, when they are\nmoving (and not interacting with matter), they move at the speed of light. Yet you know from everyday\nexperience that there are different kinds of light. For example, we perceive that light waves differ from one\nanother in a property we call color. Let\u2019s see how we can denote the differences among the whole broad\nfamily of electromagnetic waves.\nThe nice thing about a wave is that it is a repeating phenomenon. Whether it is the up-and-down motion of a\nwater wave or the changing electric and magnetic fields in a wave of light, the pattern of disturbance repeats\nin a cyclical way. Thus, any wave motion can be characterized by a series of crests and troughs (Figure 5.4).\nMoving from one crest through a trough to the next crest completes one cycle. The horizontal length covered\nby one cycle is called thewavelength. Ocean waves provide an analogy: the wavelength is the distance that\nseparates successive wave crests.\nFigure5.4Characterizing Waves.Electromagnetic radiation has wave-like characteristics. The wavelength (\u03bb) is the distance\nbetween crests, the frequency (f) is the number of cycles per second, and the speed (c) is the distance the wave covers during a\nspecified period of time (e.g., kilometers per second).\nFor visible light, our eyes perceive different wavelengths as different colors: red, for example, is the longest\nvisible wavelength, and violet is the shortest. The main colors of visible light from longest to shortest\nwavelength can be remembered using the mnemonic ROY G BIV\u2014forRed,Orange,Yellow,Green,Blue,\nIndigo, andViolet. Other invisible forms of electromagnetic radiation have different wavelengths, as we will\nsee in the next section.\nWe can also characterize different waves by theirfrequency, the number of wave cycles that pass by per\nsecond. If you count 10 crests moving by each second, for example, then the frequency is 10 cycles per second\n(cps). In honor of Heinrich Hertz, the physicist who\u2014inspired by Maxwell\u2019s work\u2014discovered radio waves, a\ncps is also called ahertz(Hz). Take a look at your radio, for example, and you will see the channel assigned to\neach radio station is characterized by its frequency, usually in units of KHz (kilohertz, or thousands of hertz) or\nMHz (megahertz, or millions of hertz).\nWavelength (\u03bb) and frequency (f) are related because all electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed. To\nsee how this works, imagine a parade in which everyone is forced by prevailing traffic conditions to move at\nexactly the same speed. You stand on a corner and watch the waves of marchers come by. First you see row\nafter row of miniature ponies. Because they are not very large and, therefore, have a shorter wavelength, a\ngood number of the ponies can move past you each minute; we can say they have a high frequency. Next,\nhowever, come several rows of circus elephants. The elephants are large and marching at the same speed as\nthe ponies, so far fewer of them can march past you per minute: Because they have a wider spacing (longer\nwavelength), they represent a lower frequency.\nThe formula for this relationship can be expressed as follows: for any wave motion, the speed at which a wave\nmoves equals the frequency times the wavelength. Waves with longer wavelengths have lower frequencies.\nMathematically, we can express this as\nwhere the Greek letter for \u201cl\u201d\u2014lambda, \u03bb\u2014is used to denote wavelength andcis the scientific symbol for the\nspeed of light. Solving for the wavelength, this is expressed as: 140 5 \u2022 Radiation and Spectra\nEXAMPLE 5.1\nDeriving and Using the Wave Equation\nThe equation for the relationship between the speed and other characteristics of a wave can be derived\nfrom our basic understanding of motion. The average speed of anything that is moving is:\n(So, for example, a car on the highway traveling at a speed of 100 km/h covers 100 km during the time of 1\nh.) For an electromagnetic wave to travel the distance of one of its wavelengths, \u03bb, at the speed of light,c,\nwe havec= \u03bb/t. The frequency of a wave is the number of cycles per second. If a wave has a frequency of a\nmillion cycles per second, then the time for each cycle to go by is a millionth of a second. So, in general,t=\n1/f. Substituting into ourwave equation, we getc= \u03bb \u00d7f. Now let\u2019s use this to calculate an example. What is\nthe wavelength of visible light that has a frequency of 5.66 \u00d7 1014Hz?\nSolution\nSolving the wave equation for wavelength, we find:\nSubstituting our values gives:\nThis answer can also be written as 530 nm, which is in the yellow-green part of the visible spectrum (nm\nstands for nanometers, where the term \u201cnano\u201d means \u201cbillionths\u201d).\nCheck Your Learning\n\u201cTidal waves,\u201d or tsunamis, are waves caused by earthquakes that travel rapidly through the ocean. If a\ntsunami travels at the speed of 600 km/h and approaches a shore at a rate of one wave crest every 15 min\n(4 waves/h), what would be the distance between those wave crests at sea?\nAnswer:\nLight as a Photon\nThe electromagnetic wave model of light (as formulated by Maxwell) was one of the great triumphs of\nnineteenth-century science. In 1887, when HeinrichHertzactually made invisible electromagnetic waves (what\ntoday are called radio waves) on one side of a room and detected them on the other side, it ushered in a new\nera that led to the modern age of telecommunications. His experiment ultimately led to the technologies of\ntelevision, cell phones, and today\u2019s wireless networks around the globe.\nHowever, by the beginning of the twentieth century, more sophisticated experiments had revealed that light\nbehaves in certain ways that cannot be explained by the wave model. Reluctantly, physicists had to accept that\nsometimes light behaves more like a \u201cparticle\u201d\u2014or at least a self-contained packet of energy\u2014than a wave.\nWe call such a packet of electromagnetic energy aphoton.\nThe fact that light behaves like a wave in certain experiments and like a particle in others was a very surprising\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.1 \u2022 The Behavior of Light 141\nand unlikely idea. After all, our common sense says that waves and particles are opposite concepts. On one\nhand, a wave is a repeating disturbance that, by its very nature, is not in only one place, but spreads out. A\nparticle, on the other hand, is something that can be in only one place at any given time. Strange as it sounds,\nthough, countless experiments now confirm that electromagnetic radiation can sometimes behave like a wave\nand at other times like a particle.\nThen, again, perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that something that always travels at the \u201cspeed limit\u201d of the\nuniverse and doesn\u2019t need a medium to travel through might not obey our everyday common sense ideas. The\nconfusion that this wave-particle duality of light caused in physics was eventually resolved by the introduction\nof a more complicated theory of waves and particles, now called quantum mechanics. (This is one of the most\ninteresting fields of modern science, but it is mostly beyond the scope of our book. If you are interested in it,\nsee some of the suggested resources at the end of this chapter.)\nIn any case, you should now be prepared when scientists (or the authors of this book) sometimes discuss\nelectromagnetic radiation as if it consisted of waves and at other times refer to it as a stream of photons. A\nphoton (being a packet of energy) carries a specific amount of energy. We can use the idea of energy to\nconnect the photon and wave models. How much energy a photon has depends on its frequency when you\nthink about it as a wave. A low-energy radio wave has a low frequency as a wave, while a high-energy X-ray at\nyour dentist\u2019s office is a high-frequency wave. Among the colors of visible light, violet-light photons have the\nhighest energy and red-light photons have the lowest.\nTest whether the connection between photons and waves is clear to you. In the above example, which photon\nwould have the longer wavelength as a wave: the radio wave or the X-ray? If you answered the radio wave, you\nare correct. Radio waves have a lower frequency, so the wave cycles are longer (they are elephants, not\nminiature ponies).\nPropagation of Light\nLet\u2019s think for a moment about howlightfrom a lightbulb moves through space. As waves expand, they travel\naway from the bulb, not just toward your eyes but in all directions. They must therefore cover an ever-\nwidening space. Yet the total amount of light available can\u2019t change once the light has left the bulb. This\nmeans that, as the same expanding shell of light covers a larger and larger area, there must be less and less of\nit in any given place. Light (and all other electromagnetic radiation) gets weaker and weaker as it gets farther\nfrom its source.\nThe increase in the area that the light must cover is proportional to the square of the distance that the light\nhas traveled (Figure 5.5). If we stand twice as far from the source, our eyes will intercept two-squared (2 \u00d7 2),\nor four times less light. If we stand 10 times farther from the source, we get 10-squared, or 100 times less light.\nYou can see how this weakening means trouble for sources of light at astronomical distances. One of the\nnearest stars,Alpha CentauriA, emits about the same total energy as the Sun. But it is about 270,000 times\nfarther away, and so it appears about 73 billion times fainter. No wonder the stars, which close-up would look\nmore or less like the Sun, look like faint pinpoints of light from far away. 142 5 \u2022 Radiation and Spectra\nFigure5.5Inverse Square Law for Light.As light radiates away from its source, it spreads out in such a way that the energy per\nunit area (the amount of energy passing through one of the small squares) decreases as the square of the distance from its source.\nThis idea\u2014that the apparent brightness of a source (how bright it looks to us) gets weaker with distance in the\nway we have described\u2014is known as theinverse square lawfor light propagation. In this respect, the\npropagation of light is similar to the effects of gravity. Remember that the force of gravity between two\nattracting masses is also inversely proportional to the square of their separation.\nEXAMPLE 5.2\nThe Inverse Square Law for Light\nThe intensity of a 120-W lightbulb observed from a distance 2 m away is 2.4 W/m2. What would be the\nintensity if this distance was doubled?\nSolution\nIf we move twice as far away, then the answer will change according to the inverse square of the distance,\nso the new intensity will be (1/2)2= 1/4 of the original intensity, or 0.6 W/m2.\nCheck Your Learning\nHow many times brighter or fainter would a star appear if it were moved to:\na. twice its present distance?\nb. ten times its present distance?\nc. half its present distance?\nAnswer:\na. ; b. ; c.\n5.2 The Electromagnetic Spectrum\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nUnderstand the bands of the electromagnetic spectrum and how they differ from one another\nUnderstand how each part of the spectrum interacts with Earth\u2019s atmosphere\nExplain how and why the light emitted by an object depends on its temperature\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.2 \u2022 The Electromagnetic Spectrum 143\nObjects in the universe send out an enormous range of electromagnetic radiation. Scientists call this range the\nelectromagnetic spectrum, which they have divided into a number of categories. The spectrum is shown in\nFigure 5.6, with some information about the waves in each part or band.\nFigure5.6Radiation and Earth\u2019s Atmosphere.This figure shows the bands of the electromagnetic spectrum and how well Earth\u2019s\natmosphere transmits them. Note that high-frequency waves from space do not make it to the surface and must therefore be\nobserved from space. Some infrared and microwaves are absorbed by water and thus are best observed from high altitudes. Low-\nfrequency radio waves are blocked by Earth\u2019s ionosphere. (credit: modification of work by STScI/JHU/NASA)\nTypes of Electromagnetic Radiation\nElectromagnetic radiation with the shortest wavelengths, no longer than 0.01 nanometer, is categorized as\ngamma rays(1 nanometer = 10\u20139meters; seeAppendix D). The namegammacomes from the third letter of\nthe Greek alphabet: gamma rays were the third kind of radiation discovered coming from radioactive atoms\nwhen physicists first investigated their behavior. Because gamma rays carry a lot of energy, they can be\ndangerous for living tissues. Gamma radiation is generated deep in the interior of stars, as well as by some of\nthe most violent phenomena in the universe, such as the deaths of stars and the merging of stellar corpses.\nGamma rays coming to Earth are absorbed by our atmosphere before they reach the ground (which is a good\nthing for our health); thus, they can only be studied using instruments in space.\nElectromagnetic radiation with wavelengths between 0.01 nanometer and 20 nanometers is referred to asX-\nrays. Being more energetic than visible light, X-rays are able to penetrate soft tissues but not bones, and so 144 5 \u2022 Radiation and Spectra\nallow us to make images of the shadows of the bones inside us. While X-rays can penetrate a short length of\nhuman flesh, they are stopped by the large numbers of atoms in Earth\u2019s atmosphere with which they interact.\nThus, X-ray astronomy (like gamma-ray astronomy) could not develop until we invented ways of sending\ninstruments above our atmosphere (Figure 5.7).\nFigure5.7X-Ray Sky.This is a map of the sky tuned to certain types of X-rays (seen from above Earth\u2019s atmosphere). The map tilts\nthe sky so that the disk of our Milky Way Galaxy runs across its center. It was constructed and artificially colored from data gathered\nby the European ROSAT satellite. Each color (red, yellow, and blue) shows X-rays of different frequencies or energies. For example,\nred outlines the glow from a hot local bubble of gas all around us, blown by one or more exploding stars in our cosmic vicinity.\nYellow and blue show more distant sources of X-rays, such as remnants of other exploded stars or the active center of our Galaxy (in\nthe middle of the picture). (credit: modification of work by NASA)\nRadiation intermediate between X-rays and visible light isultraviolet(meaning higher energy than violet).\nOutside the world of science, ultraviolet light is sometimes called \u201cblack light\u201d because our eyes cannot see it.\nUltraviolet radiation is mostly blocked by the ozone layer of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, but a small fraction of\nultraviolet rays from our Sun do penetrate to cause sunburn or, in extreme cases of overexposure, skin cancer\nin human beings. Ultraviolet astronomy is also best done from space.\nElectromagnetic radiation with wavelengths between roughly 400 and 700 nm is calledvisible lightbecause\nthese are the waves that human vision can perceive. This is also the band of the electromagnetic spectrum\nthat most readily reaches Earth\u2019s surface. These two observations are not coincidental: human eyes evolved to\nsee the kinds of waves that arrive from the Sun most effectively. Visible light penetrates Earth\u2019s atmosphere\neffectively, except when it is temporarily blocked by clouds.\nBetween visible light and radio waves are the wavelengths ofinfraredor heat radiation. Astronomer William\nHerschel first discovered infrared in 1800 while trying to measure the temperatures of different colors of\nsunlight spread out into a spectrum. He noticed that when he accidently positioned his thermometer beyond\nthe reddest color, it still registered heating due to some invisible energy coming from the Sun. This was the\nfirst hint about the existence of the other (invisible) bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, although it would\ntake many decades for our full understanding to develop.\nA heat lamp radiates mostly infrared radiation, and the nerve endings in our skin are sensitive to this band of\nthe electromagnetic spectrum. Infrared waves are absorbed by water and carbon dioxide molecules, which are\nmore concentrated low in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. For this reason, infrared astronomy is best done from high\nmountaintops, high-flying airplanes, and spacecraft.\nAfter infrared comes the familiarmicrowave, used in short-wave communication and microwave ovens.\n(Wavelengths vary from 1 millimeter to 1 meter and are absorbed by water vapor, which makes them effective\nin heating foods.) The \u201cmicro-\u201d prefix refers to the fact that microwaves are small in comparison to radio\nwaves, the next on the spectrum. You may remember that tea\u2014which is full of water\u2014heats up quickly in your\nmicrowave oven, while a ceramic cup\u2014from which water has been removed by baking\u2014stays cool in\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.2 \u2022 The Electromagnetic Spectrum 145\ncomparison.\nAll electromagnetic waves longer than microwaves are calledradio waves, but this is so broad a category that\nwe generally divide it into several subsections. Among the most familiar of these are radar waves, which are\nused in radar guns by traffic officers to determine vehicle speeds, and AM radio waves, which were the first to\nbe developed for broadcasting. The wavelengths of these different categories range from over a meter to\nhundreds of meters, and other radio radiation can have wavelengths as long as several kilometers.\nWith such a wide range of wavelengths, not all radio waves interact with Earth\u2019s atmosphere in the same way.\nFM and TV waves are not absorbed and can travel easily through our atmosphere. AM radio waves are\nabsorbed or reflected by a layer in Earth\u2019s atmosphere called the ionosphere (the ionosphere is a layer of\ncharged particles at the top of our atmosphere, produced by interactions with sunlight and charged particles\nthat are ejected from the Sun).\nWe hope this brief survey has left you with one strong impression: although visible light is what most people\nassociate with astronomy, the light that our eyes can see is only a tiny fraction of the broad range of waves\ngenerated in the universe. Today, we understand that judging some astronomical phenomenon by using only\nthe light we can see is like hiding under the table at a big dinner party and judging all the guests by nothing\nbut their shoes. There\u2019s a lot more to each person than meets our eye under the table. It is very important for\nthose who study astronomy today to avoid being \u201cvisible light chauvinists\u201d\u2014to respect only the information\nseen by their eyes while ignoring the information gathered by instruments sensitive to other bands of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum.\nTable 5.1summarizes the bands of the electromagnetic spectrum and indicates the temperatures and typical\nastronomical objects that emit each kind of electromagnetic radiation. While at first, some of the types of\nradiation listed in the table may seem unfamiliar, you will get to know them better as your astronomy course\ncontinues. You can return to this table as you learn more about the types of objects astronomers study.\nTypes of Electromagnetic Radiation\nType of Wavelength Radiated by Objects at Typical Sources\nRadiation Range (nm) This Temperature\nGamma Produced in nuclear reactions; require very\nLess than 0.01 More than 108K\nrays high-energy processes\nGas in clusters of galaxies, supernova\nX-rays 0.01\u201320 106\u2013108K\nremnants, solar corona\nUltraviolet 20\u2013400 104\u2013106K Supernova remnants, very hot stars\nVisible 400\u2013700 103\u2013104K Stars\nCool clouds of dust and gas, planets,\nInfrared 103\u2013106 10\u2013103K\nmoons\nActive galaxies, pulsars, cosmic\nMicrowave 106\u2013109 Less than 10 K\nbackground radiation\nRadio More than 109 Less than 10 K Supernova remnants, pulsars, cold gas\nTable5.1 146 5 \u2022 Radiation and Spectra\nRadiation and Temperature\nSome astronomical objects emit mostly infrared radiation, others mostly visible light, and still others mostly\nultraviolet radiation. What determines the type of electromagnetic radiation emitted by the Sun, stars, and\nother dense astronomical objects? The answer often turns out to be theirtemperature.\nAt the microscopic level, everything in nature is in motion. A solid is composed of molecules and atoms in\ncontinuous vibration: they move back and forth in place, but their motion is much too small for our eyes to\nmake out. A gas consists of atoms and/or molecules that are flying about freely at high speed, continually\nbumping into one another and bombarding the surrounding matter. The hotter the solid or gas, the more\nrapid the motion of its molecules or atoms. The temperature of something is thus a measure of the average\nmotion energy of the particles that make it up.\nThis motion at the microscopic level is responsible for much of the electromagnetic radiation on Earth and in\nthe universe. As atoms and molecules move about and collide, or vibrate in place, their electrons give off\nelectromagnetic radiation. The characteristics of this radiation are determined by the temperature of those\natoms and molecules. In a hot material, for example, the individual particles vibrate in place or move rapidly\nfrom collisions, so the emitted waves are, on average, more energetic. And recall that higher energy waves\nhave a higher frequency. In very cool material, the particles have low-energy atomic and molecular motions\nand thus generate lower-energy waves.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCheck out theNASA briefing(https://openstax.org/l/30elmagsp1)orNASA\u2019s 5-minute introductory video\n(https://openstax.org/l/30elmagsp2)to learn more about the electromagnetic spectrum.\nRadiation Laws\nTo understand, in more quantitative detail, the relationship between temperature and electromagnetic\nradiation, we imagine an idealized object called ablackbody. Such an object (unlike your sweater or your\nastronomy instructor\u2019s head) does not reflect or scatter any radiation, but absorbs all the electromagnetic\nenergy that falls onto it. The energy that is absorbed causes the atoms and molecules in it to vibrate or move\naround at increasing speeds. As it gets hotter, this object will radiate electromagnetic waves until absorption\nand radiation are in balance. We want to discuss such an idealized object because, as you will see, stars behave\nin very nearly the same way.\nThe radiation from a blackbody has several characteristics, as illustrated inFigure 5.8. The graph shows the\npower emitted at each wavelength by objects of different temperatures. In science, the wordpowermeans the\nenergy coming off per second (and it is typically measured inwatts, which you are probably familiar with from\nbuying lightbulbs).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.2 \u2022 The Electromagnetic Spectrum 147\nFigure5.8Radiation Laws Illustrated.This graph shows in arbitrary units how many photons are given off at each wavelength for\nobjects at four different temperatures. The wavelengths corresponding to visible light are shown by the colored bands. Note that at\nhotter temperatures, more energy (in the form of photons) is emitted at all wavelengths. The higher the temperature, the shorter\nthe wavelength at which the peak amount of energy is radiated (this is known as Wien\u2019s law).\nFirst of all, notice that the curves show that, at each temperature, our blackbody object emits radiation\n(photons) at all wavelengths (all colors). This is because in any solid or denser gas, some molecules or atoms\nvibrate or move between collisions slower than average and some move faster than average. So when we look\nat the electromagnetic waves emitted, we find a broad range, or spectrum, of energies and wavelengths. More\nenergy is emitted at the average vibration or motion rate (the highest part of each curve), but if we have a\nlarge number of atoms or molecules, some energy will be detected at each wavelength.\nSecond, note that an object at a higher temperature emits more power at all wavelengths than does a cooler\none. In a hot gas (the taller curves inFigure 5.8), for example, the atoms have more collisions and give off\nmore energy. In the real world of stars, this means that hotter stars give off more energy at every wavelength\nthan do cooler stars.\nThird, the graph shows us that the higher the temperature, the shorter the wavelength at which the maximum\npower is emitted. Remember that a shorter wavelength means a higher frequency and energy. It makes sense,\nthen, that hot objects give off a larger fraction of their energy at shorter wavelengths (higher energies) than\ndo cool objects. You may have observed examples of this rule in everyday life. When a burner on an electric\nstove is turned on low, it emits only heat, which is infrared radiation, but does not glow with visible light. If the\nburner is set to a higher temperature, it starts to glow a dull red. At a still-higher setting, it glows a brighter\norange-red (shorter wavelength). At even higher temperatures, which cannot be reached with ordinary stoves,\nmetal can appear brilliant yellow or even blue-white.\nWe can use these ideas to come up with a rough sort of \u201cthermometer\u201d for measuring the temperatures of\nstars. Because many stars give off most of their energy in visible light, the color of light that dominates a star\u2019s\nappearance is a rough indicator of its temperature. If one star looks red and another looks blue, which one has\nthe higher temperature? Because blue is the shorter-wavelength color, it is the sign of a hotter star. (Note that\nthe temperatures we associate with different colors in science are not the same as the ones artists use. In art,\nred is often called a \u201chot\u201d color and blue a \u201ccool\u201d color. Likewise, we commonly see red on faucet or air\nconditioning controls to indicate hot temperatures and blue to indicate cold temperatures. Although these are\ncommon uses to us in daily life, in nature, it\u2019s the other way around.) 148 5 \u2022 Radiation and Spectra\nWe can develop a more precise star thermometer by measuring how much energy a star gives off at each\nwavelength and by constructing diagrams likeFigure 5.8. The location of the peak (or maximum) in the power\ncurve of each star can tell us its temperature. The average temperature at the surface of the Sun, which is\nwhere the radiation that we see is emitted, turns out to be 5800 K. (Throughout this text, we use the kelvin or\nabsolute temperature scale. On this scale, water freezes at 273 K and boils at 373 K. All molecular motion\nceases at 0 K. The various temperature scales are described inAppendix D.) There are stars cooler than the\nSun and stars hotter than the Sun.\nThe wavelength at which maximum power is emitted can be calculated according to the equation\nwhere the wavelength is in nanometers (one billionth of a meter) and the temperature is in K (the constant 3 x\n10^6 has units of nm \u00d7 K). This relationship is calledWien\u2019s law. For the Sun, the wavelength at which the\nmaximum energy is emitted is 520 nanometers, which is near the middle of that portion of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum called visible light. Characteristic temperatures of other astronomical objects, and\nthe wavelengths at which they emit most of their power, are listed inTable 5.1.\nEXAMPLE 5.3\nCalculating the Temperature of a Blackbody\nWe can use Wien\u2019s law to calculate the temperature of a star provided we know the wavelength of peak\nintensity for its spectrum. If the emitted radiation from a red dwarf star has a wavelength of maximum\npower at 1200 nm, what is the temperature of this star, assuming it is a blackbody?\nSolution\nSolving Wien\u2019s law for temperature gives:\nCheck Your Learning\nWhat is the temperature of a star whose maximum light is emitted at a much shorter wavelength of 290\nnm?\nAnswer:\nSince this star has a peak wavelength that is at a shorter wavelength (in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum)\nthan that of our Sun (in the visible part of the spectrum), it should come as no surprise that its surface\ntemperature is much hotter than our Sun\u2019s.\nWe can also describe our observation that hotter objects radiate more power at all wavelengths in a\nmathematical form. If we sum up the contributions from all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, we obtain\nthe total energy emitted by a blackbody. What we usually measure from a large object like a star is theenergy\nflux, the power emitted per square meter. The wordfluxmeans \u201cflow\u201d here: we are interested in the flow of\npower into an area (like the area of a telescope mirror). It turns out that the energy flux from a blackbody at\ntemperatureTis proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature. This relationship is known as\ntheStefan-Boltzmann lawand can be written in the form of an equation as\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.2 \u2022 The Electromagnetic Spectrum 149\nwhereFstands for the energy flux (in units of watts per square meter), T is given in Kelvins, and \u03c3 (Greek letter\nsigma) is a constant number (5.67 \u00d7 10-8).\nNotice how impressive this result is. Increasing the temperature of a star would have a tremendous effect on\nthe power it radiates. If the Sun, for example, were twice as hot\u2014that is, if it had a temperature of 11,600 K\u2014it\nwould radiate 24, or 16 times more power than it does now. Tripling the temperature would raise the power\noutput 81 times. Hot stars really shine away a tremendous amount of energy.\nEXAMPLE 5.4\nCalculating the Power of a Star\nWhile energy flux tells us how much power a star emits per square meter, we would often like to know how\nmuch total power is emitted by the star. We can determine that by multiplying the energy flux by the\nnumber of square meters on the surface of the star. Stars are mostly spherical, so we can use the formula\n4\u03c0R2for the surface area, whereRis the radius of the star. The total power emitted by the star (which we\ncall the star\u2019s \u201cabsolute luminosity\u201d) can be found by multiplying the formula for energy flux and the\nformula for the surface area:\nTwo stars have the same size and are the same distance from us. Star A has a surface temperature of 6000\nK, and star B has a surface temperature twice as high, 12,000 K. How much more luminous is star B\ncompared to star A?\nSolution\nTake the ratio of the luminosity of Star A to Star B:\nBecause the two stars are the same size,R =R , leaving\nA B\nCheck Your Learning\nTwo stars with identical diameters are the same distance away. One has a temperature of 8700 K and the\nother has a temperature of 2900 K. Which is brighter? How much brighter is it?\nAnswer:\nThe 8700 K star has triple the temperature, so it is 34= 81 times brighter.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nYou can use theBlackbody Spectrum simulator(https://openstax.org/l/30blackbodysim)to explore the\nrelationship between an object\u2019s temperature, peak wavelength, overall brightness, and apparent color. 150 5 \u2022 Radiation and Spectra\n5.3 Spectroscopy in Astronomy\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the properties of light\nExplain how astronomers learn the composition of a gas by examining its spectral lines\nDiscuss the various types of spectra\nElectromagnetic radiation carries a lot of information about the nature of stars and other astronomical\nobjects. To extract this information, however, astronomers must be able to study the amounts of energy we\nreceive at different wavelengths of light in fine detail. Let\u2019s examine how we can do this and what we can\nlearn.\nProperties of Light\nLight exhibits certain behaviors that are important to the design of telescopes and other instruments. For\nexample, light can bereflectedfrom a surface. If the surface is smooth and shiny, as with a mirror, the\ndirection of the reflected light beam can be calculated accurately from knowledge of the shape of the\nreflecting surface. Light is also bent, orrefracted, when it passes from one kind of transparent material into\nanother\u2014say, from the air into a glass lens.\nReflection and refraction of light are the basic properties that make possible allopticalinstruments (devices\nthat help us to see things better)\u2014from eyeglasses to giant astronomical telescopes. Such instruments are\ngenerally combinations of glass lenses, which bend light according to the principles of refraction, and curved\nmirrors, which depend on the properties of reflection. Small optical devices, such as eyeglasses or binoculars,\ngenerally use lenses, whereas large telescopes depend almost entirely on mirrors for their main optical\nelements. We will discuss astronomical instruments and their uses more fully inAstronomical Instruments. For\nnow, we turn to another behavior of light, one that is essential for the decoding of light.\nIn 1672, in the first paper that he submitted to the Royal Society, Sir IsaacNewtondescribed an experiment in\nwhich he permitted sunlight to pass through a small hole and then through a prism. Newton found that\nsunlight, which looks white to us, is actually made up of a mixture of all the colors of the rainbow (Figure 5.9).\nFigure5.9Action of a Prism.When we pass a beam of white sunlight through a prism, we see a rainbow-colored band of light that\nwe call a continuous spectrum.\nFigure 5.9shows how light is separated into different colors with a prism\u2014a piece of glass in the shape of a\ntriangle with refracting surfaces. Upon entering one face of the prism, the path of the light is refracted (bent),\nbut not all of the colors are bent by the same amount. The bending of the beam depends on the wavelength of\nthe light as well as the properties of the material, and as a result, different wavelengths (or colors of light) are\nbent by different amounts and therefore follow slightly different paths through the prism. The violet light is\nbent more than the red. This phenomenon is calleddispersionand explains Newton\u2019s rainbow experiment.\nUpon leaving the opposite face of the prism, the light is bent again and further dispersed. If the light leaving\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.3 \u2022 Spectroscopy in Astronomy 151\nthe prism is focused on a screen, the different wavelengths or colors that make up white light are lined up side\nby side just like a rainbow (Figure 5.10). (In fact, a rainbow is formed by the dispersion of light though\nraindrops; seeThe Rainbowfeature box.) Because this array of colors is a spectrum of light, the instrument\nused to disperse the light and form the spectrum is called aspectrometer.\nFigure5.10Continuous Spectrum.When white light passes through a prism, it is dispersed and forms a continuous spectrum of all\nthe colors. Although it is hard to see in this printed version, in a well-dispersed spectrum, many subtle gradations in color are visible\nas your eye scans from one end (violet) to the other (red).\nThe Value of Stellar Spectra\nWhen Newton described the laws of refraction and dispersion in optics, and observed the solar spectrum, all\nhe could see was a continuous band of colors. If the spectrum of the white light from the Sun and stars were\nsimply a continuous rainbow of colors, astronomers would have little interest in the detailed study of a star\u2019s\nspectrum once they had learned its average surface temperature. In 1802, however, William Wollaston built an\nimproved spectrometer that included a lens to focus the Sun\u2019s spectrum on a screen. With this device,\nWollaston saw that the colors were not spread out uniformly, but instead, some ranges of color were missing,\nappearing as dark bands in the solar spectrum. He mistakenly attributed these lines to natural boundaries\nbetween the colors. In 1815, German physicist JosephFraunhofer, upon a more careful examination of the\nsolar spectrum, found about 600 such dark lines (missing colors), which led scientists to rule out the boundary\nhypothesis (Figure 5.11).\nFigure5.11Visible Spectrum of the Sun.Our star\u2019s spectrum is crossed by dark lines produced by atoms in the solar atmosphere\nthat absorb light at certain wavelengths. (credit: modification of work by Nigel Sharp, NOAO/National Solar Observatory at Kitt Peak/\nAURA, and the National Science Foundation)\nLater, researchers found that similar dark lines could be produced in the spectra (\u201cspectra\u201d is the plural of\n\u201cspectrum\u201d) of artificial light sources. They did this by passing their light through various apparently\ntransparent substances\u2014usually containers with just a bit of thin gas in them.\nThese gases turned out not to be transparent atallcolors: they were quite opaque at a few sharply defined\nwavelengths. Something in each gas had to be absorbing just a few colors of light and no others. All gases did\nthis, but each different element absorbed a different set of colors and thus showed different dark lines. If the\ngas in a container consisted of two elements, then light passing through it was missing the colors (showing\ndark lines) for both of the elements. So it became clear that certain lines in the spectrum \u201cgo with\u201d certain\nelements. This discovery was one of the most important steps forward in the history of astronomy. 152 5 \u2022 Radiation and Spectra\nWhat would happen if there were no continuous spectrum for our gases to remove light from? What if,\ninstead, we heated the same thin gases until they were hot enough to glow with their own light? When the\ngases were heated, a spectrometer revealed no continuous spectrum, but several separate bright lines. That\nis, these hot gases emitted light only at certain specific wavelengths or colors.\nWhen the gas was pure hydrogen, it would emit one pattern of colors; when it was pure sodium, it would emit\na different pattern. A mixture of hydrogen and sodium emitted both sets of spectral lines. The colors the gases\nemitted when they were heated were the very same colors as those they had absorbed when a continuous\nsource of light was behind them. From such experiments, scientists began to see that different substances\nshowed distinctivespectral signaturesby which their presence could be detected (Figure 5.12). Just as your\nsignature allows the bank to identify you, the unique pattern of colors for each type of atom (its spectrum) can\nhelp us identify which element or elements are in a gas.\nFigure5.12Continuous Spectrum and Line Spectra from Different Elements.Each type of glowing gas (each element) produces\nits own unique pattern of lines, so the composition of a gas can be identified by its spectrum. The spectra of sodium, hydrogen,\ncalcium, and mercury gases are shown here.\nTypes of Spectra\nIn these experiments, then, there were three different types ofspectra. Acontinuous spectrum(formed\nwhen a solid or very dense gas gives off radiation) is an array of all wavelengths or colors of the rainbow. A\ncontinuous spectrum can serve as a backdrop from which the atoms of much less dense gas can absorb light.\nA dark line, orabsorption spectrum, consists of a series or pattern of dark lines\u2014missing\ncolors\u2014superimposed upon the continuous spectrum of a source. A bright line, oremission spectrum,\nappears as a pattern or series of bright lines; it consists of light in which only certain discrete wavelengths are\npresent. (Figure 5.11shows an absorption spectrum, whereasFigure 5.12shows the emission spectrum of a\nnumber of common elements along with an example of a continuous spectrum.)\nWhen we have a hot, thin gas, each particular chemical element or compound produces its own characteristic\npattern of spectral lines\u2014its spectral signature. No two types of atoms or molecules give the same patterns. In\nother words, each particular gas can absorb or emit only certain wavelengths of the light peculiar to that gas.\nIn contrast, absorption spectra occur when passing white light through a cool, thin gas. The temperature and\nother conditions determine whether the lines are bright or dark (whether light is absorbed or emitted), but the\nwavelengths of the lines for any element are the same in either case. It is the precise pattern of wavelengths\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.3 \u2022 Spectroscopy in Astronomy 153\nthat makes the signature of each element unique. Liquids and solids can also generate spectral lines or bands,\nbut they are broader and less well defined\u2014and hence, more difficult to interpret. Spectral analysis, however,\ncan be quite useful. It can, for example, be applied to light reflected off the surface of a nearby asteroid as well\nas to light from a distant galaxy.\nThe dark lines in the solar spectrum thus give evidence of certain chemical elements between us and the Sun\nabsorbing those wavelengths of sunlight. Because the space between us and the Sun is pretty empty,\nastronomers realized that the atoms doing the absorbing must be in a thin atmosphere of cooler gas around\nthe Sun. This outer atmosphere is not all that different from the rest of the Sun, just thinner and cooler. Thus,\nwe can use what we learn about its composition as an indicator of what the whole Sun is made of. Similarly, we\ncan use the presence of absorption and emission lines to analyze the composition of other stars and clouds of\ngas in space.\nSuch analysis of spectra is the key to modern astronomy. Only in this way can we \u201csample\u201d the stars, which are\ntoo far away for us to visit. Encoded in the electromagnetic radiation from celestial objects is clear information\nabout the chemical makeup of these objects. Only by understanding what the stars were made of could\nastronomers begin to form theories about what made them shine and how they evolved.\nIn 1860, German physicist Gustav Kirchhoff became the first person to use spectroscopy to identify an element\nin the Sun when he found the spectral signature of sodium gas. In the years that followed, astronomers found\nmany other chemical elements in the Sun and stars. In fact, the element helium was found first in the Sun\nfrom its spectrum and only later identified on Earth. (The word \u201chelium\u201d comes fromhelios, the Greek name\nfor the Sun.)\nWhy are there specific lines for each element? The answer to that question was not found until the twentieth\ncentury; it required the development of a model for the atom. We therefore turn next to a closer examination\nof the atoms that make up all matter.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nYou can use theSpectrum Constructor(https://openstax.org/l/30spectcoord)to explore the three types of\nspectra and how they appear through a diffraction grating when the brightness of each wavelength is\nmeasured with a spectrometer.\nMAKING CONNECTIONS\nThe Rainbow\nRainbows are an excellent illustration of the dispersion of sunlight. You have a good chance of seeing a\nrainbow any time you are between the Sun and a rain shower, as illustrated inFigure 5.13. The raindrops\nact like little prisms and break white light into the spectrum of colors. Suppose a ray of sunlight encounters\na raindrop and passes into it. The light changes direction\u2014is refracted\u2014when it passes from air to water;\nthe blue and violet light are refracted more than the red. Some of the light is then reflected at the backside\nof the drop and reemerges from the front, where it is again refracted. As a result, the white light is spread\nout into a rainbow of colors. 154 5 \u2022 Radiation and Spectra\nFigure5.13Rainbow Refraction.(a) This diagram shows how light from the Sun, which is located behind the observer, can be\nrefracted by raindrops to produce (b) a rainbow. (c) Refraction separates white light into its component colors.\nNote that violet light lies above the red light after it emerges from the raindrop. When you look at a\nrainbow, however, the red light is higher in the sky. Why? Look again atFigure 5.13. If the observer looks at\na raindrop that is high in the sky, the violet light passes over her head and the red light enters her eye.\nSimilarly, if the observer looks at a raindrop that is low in the sky, the violet light reaches her eye and the\ndrop appears violet, whereas the red light from that same drop strikes the ground and is not seen. Colors\nof intermediate wavelengths are refracted to the eye by drops that are intermediate in altitude between the\ndrops that appear violet and the ones that appear red. Thus, a single rainbow always has red on the outside\nand violet on the inside.\n5.4 The Structure of the Atom\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the structure of atoms and the components of nuclei\nExplain the behavior of electrons within atoms and how electrons interact with light to move among\nenergy levels\nThe idea that matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms is at least 25 centuries old. It took until the\ntwentieth century, however, for scientists to invent instruments that permitted them to probe inside an atom\nand find that it is not, as had been thought, hard and indivisible. Instead, the atom is a complex structure\ncomposed of still smaller particles.\nProbing the Atom\nThe first of these smaller particles was discovered by British physicist James (J. J.)Thomsonin 1897. Named the\nelectron, this particle is negatively charged. (It is the flow of these particles that produces currents of\nelectricity, whether in lightning bolts or in the wires leading to your lamp.) Because an atom in its normal state\nis electrically neutral, each electron in an atom must be balanced by the same amount of positive charge.\nThe next step was to determine where in the atom the positive and negative charges are located. In 1911,\nBritish physicist ErnestRutherforddevised an experiment that provided part of the answer to this question. He\nbombarded an extremely thin piece of gold foil, only about 400 atoms thick, with a beam of alpha particles\n(Figure 5.14).Alpha particles(\u03b1 particles) are helium atoms that have lost their electrons and thus are\npositively charged. Most of these particles passed though the gold foil just as if it and the atoms in it were\nnearly empty space. About 1 in 8000 of the alpha particles, however, completely reversed direction and\nbounced backward from the foil. Rutherford wrote, \u201cIt was quite the most incredible event that has ever\nhappened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper\nand it came back and hit you.\u201d\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.4 \u2022 The Structure of the Atom 155\nFigure5.14Rutherford\u2019s Experiment.(a) When Rutherford allowed \u03b1 particles from a radioactive source to strike a target of gold\nfoil, he found that, although most of them went straight through, some rebounded back in the direction from which they came. (b)\nFrom this experiment, he concluded that the atom must be constructed like a miniature solar system, with the positive charge\nconcentrated in the nucleus and the negative charge orbiting in the large volume around the nucleus. Note that this drawing is not\nto scale; the electron orbits are much larger relative to the size of the nucleus.\nThe only way to account for the particles that reversed direction when they hit the gold foil was to assume that\nnearly all of the mass, as well as all of the positive charge in each individual gold atom, is concentrated in a tiny\ncenter ornucleus. When a positively charged alpha particle strikes a nucleus, it reverses direction, much as a\ncue ball reverses direction when it strikes another billiard ball. Rutherford\u2019s model placed the other type of\ncharge\u2014the negative electrons\u2014in orbit around this nucleus.\nRutherford\u2019s model required that the electrons be in motion. Positive and negative charges attract each other,\nso stationary electrons would fall into the positive nucleus. Also, because both the electrons and the nucleus\nare extremely small, most of the atom is empty, which is why nearly all of Rutherford\u2019s particles were able to\npass right through the gold foil without colliding with anything. Rutherford\u2019s model was a very successful\nexplanation of the experiments he conducted, although eventually scientists would discover that even the\nnucleus itself has structure.\nThe Atomic Nucleus\nThe simplest possible atom (and the most common one in the Sun and stars) is hydrogen. The nucleus of\nordinary hydrogen contains a single proton. Moving around this proton is a single electron. The mass of an\nelectron is nearly 2000 times smaller than the mass of a proton; the electron carries an amount of charge\nexactly equal to that of the proton but opposite in sign (Figure 5.15). Opposite charges attract each other, so it\nis an electromagnetic force that holds the proton and electron together, just as gravity is the force that keeps\nplanets in orbit around the Sun.\nFigure5.15Hydrogen Atom.This is a schematic diagram of a hydrogen atom in its lowest energy state, also called the ground state.\nThe proton and electron have equal but opposite charges, which exert an electromagnetic force that binds the hydrogen atom\ntogether. In the illustration, the size of the particles is exaggerated so that you can see them; they are not to scale. They are also\nshown much closer than they would actually be as it would take more than an entire page to show their actual distance to scale.\nThere are many other types of atoms in nature. Helium, for example, is the second-most abundant element in 156 5 \u2022 Radiation and Spectra\nthe Sun. Helium has two protons in its nucleus instead of the single proton that characterizes hydrogen. In\naddition, the helium nucleus contains two neutrons, particles with a mass comparable to that of the proton\nbut with no electric charge. Moving around this nucleus are two electrons, so the total net charge of the\nhelium atom is also zero (Figure 5.16).\nFigure5.16Helium Atom.Here we see a schematic diagram of a helium atom in its lowest energy state. Two protons are present in\nthe nucleus of all helium atoms. In the most common variety of helium, the nucleus also contains two neutrons, which have nearly\nthe same mass as the proton but carry no charge. Two electrons orbit the nucleus.\nFrom this description of hydrogen and helium, perhaps you have guessed the pattern for building up all the\nelements (different types of atoms) that we find in the universe. The type of element is determined by the\nnumber of protons in the nucleus of the atom. For example, any atom with six protons is the element carbon,\nwith eight protons is oxygen, with 26 is iron, and with 92 is uranium. On Earth, a typical atom has the same\nnumber of electrons as protons, and these electrons follow complex orbital patterns around the nucleus. Deep\ninside stars, however, it is so hot that the electrons get loose from the nucleus and (as we shall see) lead\nseparate yet productive lives.\nThe ratio of neutrons to protons increases as the number of protons increases, but each element is unique.\nThe number of neutrons is not necessarily the same for all atoms of a given element. For example, most\nhydrogen atoms contain no neutrons at all. There are, however, hydrogen atoms that contain one proton and\none neutron, and others that contain one proton and two neutrons. The various types of hydrogen nuclei with\ndifferent numbers of neutrons are calledisotopesof hydrogen (Figure 5.17), and all other elements have\nisotopes as well. You can think of isotopes as siblings in the same element \u201cfamily\u201d\u2014closely related but with\ndifferent characteristics and behaviors.\nFigure5.17Isotopes of Hydrogen.A single proton in the nucleus defines the atom to be hydrogen, but there may be zero, one, or\ntwo neutrons. The most common isotope of hydrogen is the one with only a single proton and no neutrons.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTo explore the structure of atoms, go to thePhET Build an Atom website(https://openstax.org/l/\n30atombld)where you can add protons, neutrons, or electrons to a model and the name of the element\nyou have created will appear. You can also see the net charge, the mass number, whether it is stable or\nunstable, and whether it is an ion or a neutral atom.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.4 \u2022 The Structure of the Atom 157\nThe Bohr Atom\nRutherford\u2019s model for atoms has one serious problem. Maxwell\u2019s theory of electromagnetic radiation says\nthat when electrons change either speed or the direction of motion, they must emit energy. Orbiting electrons\nconstantly change their direction of motion, so they should emit a constant stream of energy. Applying\nMaxwell\u2019s theory to Rutherford\u2019s model, all electrons should spiral into the nucleus of the atom as they lose\nenergy, and this collapse should happen very quickly\u2014in about 10\u201316seconds.\nIt was Danish physicist NielsBohr(1885\u20131962) who solved the mystery of how electrons remain in orbit. He\nwas trying to develop a model of the atom that would also explain certain regularities observed in the\nspectrum of hydrogen. He suggested that the spectrum of hydrogen can be understood if we assume that\norbits of only certain sizes are possible for the electron. Bohr further assumed that as long as the electron\nmoves in only one of these allowed orbits, it radiates no energy: its energy would change only if it moved from\none orbit to another.\nThis suggestion, in the words of science historian Abraham Pais, was \u201cone of the most audacious hypotheses\never introduced in physics.\u201d If something equivalent were at work in the everyday world, you might find that,\nas you went for a walk after astronomy class, nature permitted you to walk two steps per minute, five steps\nper minute, and 12 steps per minute, but no speeds in between. No matter how you tried to move your legs,\nonly certain walking speeds would be permitted. To make things more bizarre, it would take no effort to walk\nat any one of the allowed speeds, but it would be difficult to change from one speed to another. Luckily, no\nsuch rules apply at the level of human behavior. But at the microscopic level of the atom, experiment after\nexperiment has confirmed the validity of Bohr\u2019s strange idea. Bohr\u2019s suggestions became one of the\nfoundations of the new (and much more sophisticated) model of the subatomic world called quantum\nmechanics.\nIn Bohr\u2019s model, if the electron moves from one orbit to another closer to the atomic nucleus, it must give up\nsome energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. If the electron goes from an inner orbit to one farther\nfrom the nucleus, however, it requires some additional energy. One way to obtain the necessary energy is to\nabsorb electromagnetic radiation that may be streaming past the atom from an outside source.\nA key feature of Bohr\u2019s model is that each of the permitted electron orbits around a given atom has a certain\nenergy value; we therefore can think of each orbit as anenergy level. To move from one orbit to another\n(which will have its own specific energy value) requires a change in the electron\u2019s energy\u2014a change\ndetermined by the difference between the two energy values. If the electron goes to a lower level, the energy\ndifference will be given off; if the electron goes to a higher level, the energy difference must be obtained from\nsomewhere else. Each jump (or transition) to a different level has a fixed and definite energy change\nassociated with it.\nA crude analogy for this situation might be life in a tower of luxury apartments where the rent is determined\nby the quality of the view. Such a building has certain, definite numbered levels or floors on which apartments\nare located. No one can live on floor 5.37 or 22.5. In addition, the rent gets higher as you go up to higher\nfloors. If you want to exchange an apartment on the twentieth floor for one on the second floor, you will not\nowe as much rent. However, if you want to move from the third floor to the twenty-fifth floor, your rent will\nincrease. In an atom, too, the \u201ccheapest\u201d place for an electron to live is the lowest possible level, and energy is\nrequired to move to a higher level.\nHere we have one of the situations where it is easier to think of electromagnetic radiation as particles\n(photons) rather than as waves. As electrons move from one level to another, they give off or absorb little\npackets of energy. When an electron moves to a higher level, it absorbs a photon of just the right energy\n(provided one is available). When it moves to a lower level, it emits a photon with the exact amount of energy\nit no longer needs in its \u201clower-cost living situation.\u201d\nThe photon and wave perspectives must be equivalent: light is light, no matter how we look at it. Thus, each 158 5 \u2022 Radiation and Spectra\nphoton carries a certain amount of energy that is proportional to the frequency (f) of the wave it represents.\nThe value of its energy (E) is given by the formula\nwhere the constant of proportionality,h, is called Planck\u2019s constant.\nThe constant is named for MaxPlanck, the German physicist who was one of the originators of the quantum\ntheory (Figure 5.18). If metric units are used (that is, if energy is measured in joules and frequency in hertz),\nthen Planck\u2019s constant has the valueh= 6.626 \u00d7 10\u201334joule-seconds (J-s). Higher-energy photons correspond\nto higher-frequency waves (which have a shorter wavelength); lower-energy photons are waves of lower\nfrequency.\nFigure5.18Niels Bohr (1885\u20131962) and Max Planck (1858\u20131947).(a) Bohr, shown at his desk in this 1935 photograph, and (b)\nPlanck helped us understand the energy behavior of photons.\nTo take a specific example, consider a calcium atom inside the Sun\u2019s atmosphere in which an electron jumps\nfrom a lower level to a higher level. To do this, it needs about 5 \u00d7 10\u201319joules of energy, which it can\nconveniently obtain by absorbing a passing photon of that energy coming from deeper inside the Sun. This\nphoton is equivalent to a wave of light whose frequency is about 7.5 \u00d7 1014hertz and whose wavelength is\nabout 3.9 \u00d7 10\u20137meters (393 nanometers), in the deep violet part of the visible light spectrum. Although it may\nseem strange at first to switch from picturing light as a photon (or energy packet) to picturing it as a wave,\nsuch switching has become second nature to astronomers and can be a handy tool for doing calculations\nabout spectra.\nEXAMPLE 5.5\nThe Energy of a Photon\nNow that we know how to calculate the wavelength and frequency of aphoton, we can use this\ninformation, along with Planck\u2019s constant, to determine how much energy each photon carries. How much\nenergy does a red photon of wavelength 630 nm have?\nSolution\nFirst, as we learned earlier, we can find the frequency of the photon:\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.5 \u2022 Formation of Spectral Lines 159\nNext, we can use Planck\u2019s constant to determine the energy (remember that a Hz is the same as 1/s):\nCheck Your Learning\nWhat is the energy of a yellow photon with a frequency of 5.5 \u00d7 1014Hz?\nAnswer:\n5.5 Formation of Spectral Lines\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain how emission line spectra and absorption line spectra are formed\nDescribe what ions are and how they are formed\nExplain how spectral lines and ionization levels in a gas can help us determine its temperature\nWe can use Bohr\u2019s model of the atom to understand how spectral lines are formed. The concept of energy\nlevels for the electron orbits in an atom leads naturally to an explanation of why atoms absorb or emit only\nspecific energies or wavelengths of light.\nThe Hydrogen Spectrum\nLet\u2019s look at the hydrogen atom from the perspective of theBohr model. Suppose a beam of white light (which\nconsists of photons of all visible wavelengths) shines through a gas of atomic hydrogen. A photon of\nwavelength 656 nanometers has just the right energy to raise an electron in a hydrogen atom from the second\nto the third orbit. Thus, as all the photons of different energies (or wavelengths or colors) stream by the\nhydrogen atoms, photons withthisparticular wavelength can be absorbed by those atoms whose electrons\nare orbiting on the second level. When they are absorbed, the electrons on the second level will move to the\nthird level, and a number of the photons of this wavelength and energy will be missing from the general\nstream of white light.\nOther photons will have the right energies to raise electrons from the second to the fourth orbit, or from the\nfirst to the fifth orbit, and so on. Only photons with these exact energies can be absorbed. All of the other\nphotons will stream past the atoms untouched. Thus, hydrogen atoms absorb light at only certain\nwavelengths and produce dark lines at those wavelengths in the spectrum we see.\nSuppose we have a container of hydrogen gas through which a whole series of photons is passing, allowing\nmany electrons to move up to higher levels. When we turn off the light source, these electrons \u201cfall\u201d back\ndown from larger to smaller orbits and emit photons of light\u2014but, again, only light of those energies or\nwavelengths that correspond to the energy difference between permissible orbits. The orbital changes of\nhydrogen electrons that give rise to some spectral lines are shown inFigure 5.19. 160 5 \u2022 Radiation and Spectra\nFigure5.19Bohr Model for Hydrogen.In this simplified model of a hydrogen atom, the concentric circles shown represent\npermitted orbits or energy levels. An electron in a hydrogen atom can only exist in one of these energy levels (or states). The closer\nthe electron is to the nucleus, the more tightly bound the electron is to the nucleus. By absorbing energy, the electron can move to\nenergy levels farther from the nucleus (and even escape if enough energy is absorbed).\nSimilar pictures can be drawn for atoms other than hydrogen. However, because these other atoms ordinarily\nhave more than one electron each, the orbits of their electrons are much more complicated, and the spectra\nare more complex as well. For our purposes, the key conclusion is this:each type of atom has its own unique\npattern of electron orbits, and no two sets of orbits are exactly alike. This means that each type of atom shows\nits own unique set of spectral lines, produced by electrons moving between its unique set of orbits.\nAstronomers and physicists have worked hard to learn the lines that go with each element by studying the way\natoms absorb and emit light in laboratories here on Earth. Then they can use this knowledge to identify the\nelements in celestial bodies. In this way, we now know the chemical makeup of not just any star, but even\ngalaxies of stars so distant that their light started on its way to us long before Earth had even formed.\nEnergy Levels and Excitation\nBohr\u2019s model of the hydrogen atom was a great step forward in our understanding of the atom. However, we\nknow today that atoms cannot be represented by quite so simple a picture. For example, the concept of\nsharply defined electron orbits is not really correct; however, at the level of this introductory course, the notion\nthat only certain discrete energies are allowable for an atom is very useful. The energy levels we have been\ndiscussing can be thought of as representing certain average distances of the electron\u2019s possible orbits from\nthe atomic nucleus.\nOrdinarily, an atom is in the state of lowest possible energy, itsground state. In the Bohr model of the\nhydrogen atom, the ground state corresponds to the electron being in the innermost orbit. An atom can\nabsorb energy, which raises it to a higher energy level (corresponding, in the simple Bohr picture, to an\nelectron\u2019s movement to a larger orbit)\u2014this is referred to asexcitation. The atom is then said to be in an\nexcited state. Generally, an atom remains excited for only a very brief time. After a short interval, typically a\nhundred-millionth of a second or so, it drops back spontaneously to its ground state, with the simultaneous\nemission of light. The atom may return to its lowest state in one jump, or it may make the transition in steps of\ntwo or more jumps, stopping at intermediate levels on the way down. With each jump, it emits a photon of the\nwavelength that corresponds to the energy difference between the levels at the beginning and end of that\njump.\nAn energy-level diagram for a hydrogen atom and several possible atomic transitions are shown inFigure 5.20.\nWhen we measure the energies involved as the atom jumps between levels, we find that the transitions to or\nfrom the ground state, called theLyman seriesof lines, result in the emission or absorption of ultraviolet\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.5 \u2022 Formation of Spectral Lines 161\nphotons. But the transitions to or from the first excited state (labeled n = 2 in part (a) ofFigure 5.20), called the\nBalmer series, produce emission or absorption in visible light. In fact, it was to explain this Balmer series that\nBohr first suggested his model of the atom.\nFigure5.20Energy-Level Diagrams for Hydrogen.(a) Here we follow the emission or absorption of photons by a hydrogen atom\naccording to the Bohr model. Several different series of spectral lines are shown, corresponding to transitions of electrons from or to\ncertain allowed orbits. Each series of lines that terminates on a specific inner orbit is named for the physicist who studied it. At the\ntop, for example, you see the Balmer series, and arrows show electrons jumping from the second orbit (n= 2) to the third, fourth,\nfifth, and sixth orbits. Each time a \u201cpoor\u201d electron from a lower level wants to rise to a higher position in life, it must absorb energy\nto do so. It can absorb the energy it needs from passing waves (or photons) of light. The next set of arrows (Lyman series) show\nelectrons falling down to the first orbit from different (higher) levels. Each time a \u201crich\u201d electron goes downward toward the nucleus,\nit can afford to give off (emit) some energy it no longer needs. (In this idealized diagram, the energy levels are shown equally\nspaced; in real life, they are not.) (b) At higher and higher energy levels, the levels become more and more crowded together,\napproaching a limit. The region above the top line represents energies at which the atom is ionized (the electron is no longer\nattached to the atom). Each series of arrows represents electrons falling from higher levels to lower ones, releasing photons or\nwaves of energy in the process.\nAtoms that have absorbed specific photons from a passing beam of white light and have thus become excited\ngenerally de-excite themselves and emit that light again in a very short time. You might wonder, then, why\ndarkspectral lines are ever produced. In other words, why doesn\u2019t this reemitted light quickly \u201cfill in\u201d the\ndarker absorption lines?\nImagine a beam of white light coming toward you through some cooler gas. Some of the reemitted lightis\nactually returned to the beam of white light you see, but this fills in the absorption lines only to a slight extent.\nThe reason is that the atoms in the gas reemit lightin all directions, and only a small fraction of the reemitted\nlight is in the direction of the original beam (toward you). In a star, much of the reemitted light actually goes in\ndirections leading back into the star, which does observers outside the star no good whatsoever.\nFigure 5.21summarizes the different kinds of spectra we have discussed. An incandescent lightbulb produces\na continuous spectrum. When that continuous spectrum is viewed through a thinner cloud of gas, an\nabsorption line spectrum can be seen superimposed on the continuous spectrum. If we look only at a cloud of\nexcited gas atoms (with no continuous source seen behind it), we see that the excited atoms give off an\nemission line spectrum. 162 5 \u2022 Radiation and Spectra\nFigure5.21Three Kinds of Spectra.When we see a lightbulb or other source of continuous radiation, all the colors are present.\nWhen the continuous spectrum is seen through a thinner gas cloud, the cloud\u2019s atoms produce absorption lines in the continuous\nspectrum. When the excited cloud is seen without the continuous source behind it, its atoms produce emission lines. We can learn\nwhich types of atoms are in the gas cloud from the pattern of absorption or emission lines.\nAtoms in a hot gas are moving at high speeds and continually colliding with one another and with any loose\nelectrons. They can be excited (electrons moving to a higher level) and de-excited (electrons moving to a lower\nlevel) by these collisions as well as by absorbing and emitting light. The speed of atoms in a gas depends on\nthe temperature. When the temperature is higher, so are the speed and energy of the collisions. The hotter\nthe gas, therefore, the more likely that electrons will occupy the outermost orbits, which correspond to the\nhighest energy levels. This means that the level where electronsstarttheir upward jumps in a gas can serve as\nan indicator of how hot that gas is. In this way, the absorption lines in a spectrum give astronomers\ninformation about the temperature of the regions where the lines originate.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nUse thissimulation(https://openstax.org/l/30Hatom)to play with a hydrogen atom and see what happens\nwhen electrons move to higher levels and then give off photons as they go to a lower level.\nIonization\nWe have described how certain discrete amounts of energy can be absorbed by an atom, raising it to an\nexcited state and moving one of its electrons farther from its nucleus. If enough energy is absorbed, the\nelectron can be completely removed from the atom\u2014this is calledionization. The atom is then said to be\nionized. The minimum amount of energy required to remove one electron from an atom in its ground state is\ncalled its ionization energy.\nStill-greater amounts of energy must be absorbed by the now-ionized atom (called anion) to remove an\nadditional electron deeper in the structure of the atom. Successively greater energies are needed to remove\nthe third, fourth, fifth\u2014and so on\u2014electrons from the atom. If enough energy is available, an atom can\nbecome completely ionized, losing all of its electrons. A hydrogen atom, having only one electron to lose, can\nbe ionized only once; a helium atom can be ionized twice; and an oxygen atom up to eight times. When we\nexamine regions of the cosmos where there is a great deal of energetic radiation, such as the neighborhoods\nwhere hot young stars have recently formed, we see a lot of ionization going on.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.6 \u2022 The Doppler Effect 163\nAn atom that has become positively ionized has lost a negative charge\u2014the missing electron\u2014and thus is left\nwith a net positive charge. It therefore exerts a strong attraction on any free electron. Eventually, one or more\nelectrons will be captured and the atom will become neutral (or ionized to one less degree) again. During the\nelectron-capture process, the atom emits one or more photons. Which photons are emitted depends on\nwhether the electron is captured at once to the lowest energy level of the atom or stops at one or more\nintermediate levels on its way to the lowest available level.\nJust as the excitation of an atom can result from a collision with another atom, ion, or electron (collisions with\nelectrons are usually most important), so can ionization. The rate at which such collisional ionizations occur\ndepends on the speeds of the atoms and hence on the temperature of the gas\u2014the hotter the gas, the more\nof its atoms will be ionized.\nThe rate at which ions and electrons recombine also depends on their relative speeds\u2014that is, on the\ntemperature. In addition, it depends on the density of the gas: the higher the density, the greater the chance\nfor recapture, because the different kinds of particles are crowded more closely together. From a knowledge\nof the temperature and density of a gas, it is possible to calculate the fraction of atoms that have been ionized\nonce, twice, and so on. In the Sun, for example, we find that most of the hydrogen and helium atoms in its\natmosphere are neutral, whereas most of the calcium atoms, as well as many other heavier atoms, are ionized\nonce.\nThe energy levels of an ionized atom are entirely different from those of the same atom when it is neutral.\nEach time an electron is removed from the atom, the energy levels of the ion, and thus the wavelengths of the\nspectral lines it can produce, change. This helps astronomers differentiate the ions of a given element. Ionized\nhydrogen, having no electron, can produce no absorption lines.\n5.6 The Doppler Effect\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain why the spectral lines of photons we observe from an object will change as a result of the object\u2019s\nmotion toward or away from us\nDescribe how we can use the Doppler effect to deduce how fast astronomical objects are moving through\nspace\nThe last two sections introduced you to many new concepts, and we hope that through those, you have seen\none major idea emerge. Astronomers can learn about the elements in stars and galaxies by decoding the\ninformation in their spectral lines. There is a complicating factor in learning how to decode the message of\nstarlight, however. If a star is moving toward or away from us, its lines will be in a slightly different place in the\nspectrum from where they would be in a star at rest. And most objects in the universe do have some motion\nrelative to the Sun.\nMotion Affects Waves\nIn 1842, ChristianDopplerfirst measured the effect of motion on waves by hiring a group of musicians to play\non an open railroad car as it was moving along the track. He then applied what he learned to all waves,\nincluding light, and pointed out that if a light source is approaching or receding from the observer, the light\nwaves will be, respectively, crowded more closely together or spread out. The general principle, now known as\ntheDoppler effect, is illustrated inFigure 5.22. 164 5 \u2022 Radiation and Spectra\nFigure5.22Doppler Effect.(a) A source, S, makes waves whose numbered crests (1, 2, 3, and 4) wash over a stationary observer. (b)\nThe source S now moves toward observerAand away from observerC. Wave crest 1 was emitted when the source was at position\nS1, crest 2 at position S2, and so forth. ObserverAsees waves compressed by this motion and sees a blueshift (if the waves are light).\nObserverCsees the waves stretched out by the motion and sees a redshift. ObserverB, whose line of sight is perpendicular to the\nsource\u2019s motion, sees no change in the waves (and feels left out).\nIn part (a) of the figure, the light source (S) is at rest with respect to the observer. The source gives off a series\nof waves, whose crests we have labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The light waves spread out evenly in all directions, like\nthe ripples from a splash in a pond. The crests are separated by a distance, \u03bb, where \u03bb is the wavelength. The\nobserver, who happens to be located in the direction of the bottom of the image, sees the light waves coming\nnice and evenly, one wavelength apart. Observers located anywhere else would see the same thing.\nOn the other hand, if the source of light is moving with respect to the observer, as seen in part (b), the\nsituation is more complicated. Between the time one crest is emitted and the next one is ready to come out,\nthe source has moved a bit, toward the bottom of the page. From the point of view of observerA, this motion\nof the source has decreased the distance between crests\u2014it\u2019s squeezing the crests together, this observer\nmight say.\nIn part (b), we show the situation from the perspective of three observers. The source is seen in four positions,\nS , S , S , and S , each corresponding to the emission of one wave crest. To observerA, the waves seem to\n1 2 3 4\nfollow one another more closely, at a decreased wavelength and thus increased frequency. (Remember, all\nlight waves travel at the speed of light through empty space, no matter what. This means that motion cannot\naffect the speed, but only the wavelength and the frequency. As the wavelength decreases, the frequency\nmust increase. If the waves are shorter, more will be able to move by during each second.)\nThe situation is not the same for other observers. Let\u2019s look at the situation from the point of view of observer\nC, located opposite observerAin the figure. For her, the source is moving away from her location. As a result,\nthe waves are not squeezed together but instead are spread out by the motion of the source. The crests arrive\nwith an increased wavelength and decreased frequency. To observerB, in a direction at right angles to the\nmotion of the source, no effect is observed. The wavelength and frequency remain the same as they were in\npart (a) of the figure.\nWe can see from this illustration that the Doppler effect is produced only by a motion toward or away from the\nobserver, a motion calledradial velocity. Sideways motion does not produce such an effect. Observers\nbetweenAandBwould observe some shortening of the light waves for that part of the motion of the source\nAccess for free at openstax.org 5.6 \u2022 The Doppler Effect 165\nthat is along their line of sight. Observers betweenBandCwould observe lengthening of the light waves that\nare along their line of sight.\nYou may have heard the Doppler effect with sound waves. When a train whistle or police siren approaches you\nand then moves away, you will notice a decrease in the pitch (which is how human senses interpret sound\nwave frequency) of the sound waves. Compared to the waves at rest, they have changed from slightly more\nfrequent when coming toward you, to slightly less frequent when moving away from you.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nA nice example of this change in the sound of a train whistle can be heard at the end of the classic Beach\nBoys song \u201cCaroline, No\u201d on their albumPet Sounds. To hear this sound, go to thisYouTube\n(https://openstax.org/l/30BBtrain)version of the song. The sound of the train begins at approximately 2:20.\nColor Shifts\nWhen the source of waves moves toward you, the wavelength decreases a bit. If the waves involved are visible\nlight, then the colors of the light change slightly. As wavelength decreases, they shift toward the blue end of\nthe spectrum: astronomers call this ablueshift(since the end of the spectrum is really violet, the term should\nprobably bevioletshift, but blue is a more common color). When the source moves away from you and the\nwavelength gets longer, we call the change in colors aredshift. Because the Doppler effect was first used with\nvisible light in astronomy, the terms \u201cblueshift\u201d and \u201credshift\u201d became well established. Today, astronomers\nuse these words to describe changes in the wavelengths of radio waves or X-rays as comfortably as they use\nthem to describe changes in visible light.\nThe greater the motion toward or away from us, the greater the Doppler shift. If the relative motion is entirely\nalong the line of sight, the formula for the Doppler shift of light is\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength emitted by the source, \u0394\u03bb is the difference between \u03bb and the wavelength measured\nby the observer,cis the speed of light, andvis the relative speed of the observer and the source in the line of\nsight. The variablevis counted as positive if the velocity is one of recession, and negative if it is one of\napproach. Solving this equation for the velocity, we findv=c\u00d7 \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nClick-and-drag the object emitting waves or the object receiving waves in thissimulator\n(https://openstax.org/l/30doppsim)to experiment with the Doppler effect yourself. The plots along the top\nshow how the detected wavelengths change if the objects are approaching each other or moving further\napart.\nIf a star approaches or recedes from us, the wavelengths of light in its continuous spectrum appear shortened\nor lengthened, respectively, as do those of the dark lines. However, unless its speed is tens of thousands of\nkilometers per second, the star does not appear noticeably bluer or redder than normal. The Doppler shift is\nthus not easily detected in a continuous spectrum and cannot be measured accurately in such a spectrum. The\nwavelengths of the absorption lines can be measured accurately, however, and their Doppler shift is relatively\nsimple to detect. 166 5 \u2022 Radiation and Spectra\nEXAMPLE 5.6\nThe Doppler Effect\nWe can use theDoppler effectequation to calculate the radial velocity of an object if we know three things:\nthe speed of light, the original (unshifted) wavelength of the light emitted, and the difference between the\nwavelength of the emitted light and the wavelength we observe. For particular absorption or emission\nlines, we usually know exactly what wavelength the line has in our laboratories on Earth, where the source\nof light is not moving. We can measure the new wavelength with our instruments at the telescope, and so\nwe know the difference in wavelength due to Doppler shifting. Since the speed of light is a universal\nconstant, we can then calculate the radial velocity of the star.\nA particular emission line of hydrogen is originally emitted with a wavelength of 656.3 nm from a gas cloud.\nAt our telescope, we observe the wavelength of the emission line to be 656.6 nm. How fast is this gas cloud\nmoving toward or away from Earth?\nSolution\nBecause the light is shifted to a longer wavelength (redshifted), we know this gas cloud is moving away\nfrom us. The speed can be calculated using the Doppler shift formula:\nCheck Your Learning\nSuppose a spectral line of hydrogen, normally at 500 nm, is observed in the spectrum of a star to be at\n500.1 nm. How fast is the star moving toward or away from Earth?\nAnswer:\nBecause the light is shifted to a longer wavelength, the star is moving away from us:\nIts speed is\n60,000 m/s.\nYou may now be asking: if all the stars are moving and motion changes the wavelength of each spectral line,\nwon\u2019t this be a disaster for astronomers trying to figure out what elements are present in the stars? After all, it\nis the precise wavelength (or color) that tells astronomers which lines belong to which element. And we first\nmeasure these wavelengths in containers of gas in our laboratories, which are not moving. If every line in a\nstar\u2019s spectrum is now shifted by its motion to a different wavelength (color), how can we be sure which lines\nand which elements we are looking at in a star whose speed we do not know?\nTake heart. This situation sounds worse than it really is. Astronomers rarely judge the presence of an element\nin an astronomical object by a single line. It is thepatternof lines unique to hydrogen or calcium that enables\nus to determine that those elements are part of the star or galaxy we are observing. The Doppler effect does\nnot change the pattern of lines from a given element\u2014it only shifts the whole pattern slightly toward redder\nor bluer wavelengths. The shifted pattern is still quite easy to recognize. Best of all, when we do recognize a\nfamiliar element\u2019s pattern, we get a bonus: the amount the pattern is shifted can enable us to determine the\nspeed of the objects in our line of sight.\nThe training of astronomers includes much work on learning to decode light (and other electromagnetic\nradiation). A skillful \u201cdecoder\u201d can learn the temperature of a star, what elements are in it, and even its speed\nin a direction toward us or away from us.

Light is one form of this electromagnetic radiation. The\nwavelength of light determines the color of visible radiation. Wavelength (\u03bb) is related to frequency (f) and the\nspeed of light (c) by the equationc= \u03bbf. Electromagnetic radiation sometimes behaves like waves, but at other\ntimes, it behaves as if it were a particle\u2014a little packet of energy, called a photon. The apparent brightness of a\nsource of electromagnetic energy decreases with increasing distance from that source in proportion to the\nsquare of the distance\u2014a relationship known as the inverse square law.\n5.2The Electromagnetic Spectrum\nThe electromagnetic spectrum consists of gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet radiation, visible light, infrared, and\nradio radiation. Many of these wavelengths cannot penetrate the layers of Earth\u2019s atmosphere and must be\nobserved from space, whereas others\u2014such as visible light, FM radio and TV\u2014can penetrate to Earth\u2019s\nsurface. The emission of electromagnetic radiation is intimately connected to the temperature of the source.\nThe higher the temperature of an idealized emitter of electromagnetic radiation, the shorter is the wavelength\nat which the maximum amount of radiation is emitted. The mathematical equation describing this relationship\nis known as Wien\u2019s law: \u03bb = (3 \u00d7 106)/T. The total power emitted per square meter increases with increasing\nmax\ntemperature. The relationship between emitted energy flux and temperature is known as the Stefan-\nBoltzmann law:F= \u03c3T4.\n5.3Spectroscopy in Astronomy\nA spectrometer is a device that forms a spectrum, often utilizing the phenomenon of dispersion. The light from\nan astronomical source can consist of a continuous spectrum, an emission (bright line) spectrum, or an\nabsorption (dark line) spectrum. Because each element leaves its spectral signature in the pattern of lines we\nobserve, spectral analyses reveal the composition of the Sun and stars.\n5.4The Structure of the Atom\nAtoms consist of a nucleus containing one or more positively charged protons. All atoms except hydrogen can\nalso contain one or more neutrons in the nucleus. Negatively charged electrons orbit the nucleus. The number\nof protons defines an element (hydrogen has one proton, helium has two, and so on) of the atom. Nuclei with\nthe same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are different isotopes of the same element. In\nthe Bohr model of the atom, electrons on permitted orbits (or energy levels) don\u2019t give off any\nelectromagnetic radiation. But when electrons go from lower levels to higher ones, they must absorb a photon\nof just the right energy, and when they go from higher levels to lower ones, they give off a photon of just the\nright energy. The energy of a photon is connected to the frequency of the electromagnetic wave it represents\nby Planck\u2019s formula,E=hf.\n5.5Formation of Spectral Lines\nWhen electrons move from a higher energy level to a lower one, photons are emitted, and an emission line can\nbe seen in the spectrum. Absorption lines are seen when electrons absorb photons and move to higher energy\nlevels. Since each atom has its own characteristic set of energy levels, each is associated with a unique pattern\nof spectral lines. This allows astronomers to determine what elements are present in the stars and in the\nclouds of gas and dust among the stars. An atom in its lowest energy level is in the ground state. If an electron 170 5 \u2022 For Further Exploration\nis in an orbit other than the least energetic one possible, the atom is said to be excited. If an atom has lost one\nor more electrons, it is called an ion and is said to be ionized. The spectra of different ions look different and\ncan tell astronomers about the temperatures of the sources they are observing.\n5.6The Doppler Effect\nIf an atom is moving toward us when an electron changes orbits and produces a spectral line, we see that line\nshifted slightly toward the blue of its normal wavelength in a spectrum. If the atom is moving away, we see the\nline shifted toward the red. This shift is known as the Doppler effect and can be used to measure the radial\nvelocities of distant objects.\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nAugensen, H. & Woodbury, J. \u201cThe Electromagnetic Spectrum.\u201dAstronomy(June 1982): 6.\nDarling, D. \u201cSpectral Visions: The Long Wavelengths.\u201dAstronomy(August 1984): 16; \u201cThe Short Wavelengths.\u201d\nAstronomy(September 1984): 14.\nGingerich, O. \u201cUnlocking the Chemical Secrets of the Cosmos.\u201dSky & Telescope(July 1981): 13.\nStencil, R. et al. \u201cAstronomical Spectroscopy.\u201dAstronomy(June 1978): 6.\nWebsites\nDoppler Effect:http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/waves/Lesson-3/The-Doppler-Effect\n(http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/waves/Lesson-3/The-Doppler-Effect).

In reality, only about 9000 stars are visible to the unaided eye (from both hemispheres of our\nplanet). The light from most stars is so weak that by the time it reaches Earth, it cannot be detected by the\nhuman eye. How can we learn about the vast majority of objects in the universe that our unaided eyes simply\ncannot see?\nIn this chapter, we describe the tools astronomers use to extend their vision into space. We have learned\nalmost everything we know about the universe from studying electromagnetic radiation, as discussed in the\nchapter onRadiation and Spectra. In the twentieth century, our exploration of space made it possible to detect\nelectromagnetic radiation at all wavelengths, from gamma rays to radio waves. The different wavelengths\ncarry different kinds of information, and the appearance of any given object often depends on the wavelength\nat which the observations are made. 176 6 \u2022 Astronomical Instruments\n6.1 Telescopes\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the three basic components of a modern system for measuring astronomical sources\nDescribe the main functions of a telescope\nDescribe the two basic types of visible-light telescopes and how they form images\nSystems for Measuring Radiation\nThere are three basic components of a modern system for measuring radiation from astronomical sources.\nFirst, there is atelescope, which serves as a \u201cbucket\u201d for collecting visible light (or radiation at other\nwavelengths, as shown in (Figure 6.2). Just as you can catch more rain with a garbage can than with a coffee\ncup, large telescopes gather much more light than your eye can. Second, there is an instrument attached to\nthe telescope that sorts the incoming radiation by wavelength. Sometimes the sorting is fairly crude. For\nexample, we might simply want to separate blue light from red light so that we can determine the\ntemperature of a star. But at other times, we want to see individual spectral lines to determine what an object\nis made of, or to measure its speed (as explained in theRadiation and Spectrachapter). Third, we need some\ntype ofdetector, a device that senses the radiation in the wavelength regions we have chosen and\npermanently records the observations.\nFigure6.2Orion Region at Different Wavelengths.The same part of the sky looks different when observed with instruments that\nare sensitive to different bands of the spectrum. (a) Visible light: this shows part of the Orion region as the human eye sees it, with\ndotted lines added to show the figure of the mythical hunter, Orion. (b) X-rays: here, the view emphasizes the point-like X-ray\nsources nearby. The colors are artificial, changing from yellow to white to blue with increasing energy of the X-rays. The bright, hot\nstars in Orion are still seen in this image, but so are many other objects located at very different distances, including other stars, star\ncorpses, and galaxies at the edge of the observable universe. (c) Infrared radiation: here, we mainly see the glowing dust in this\nregion. (credit a: modification of work by Howard McCallon/NASA/IRAS; credit b: modification of work by Howard McCallon/NASA/\nIRAS; credit c: modification of work by Michael F. Corcoran)\nThe history of the development of astronomical telescopes is about how new technologies have been applied\nto improve the efficiency of these three basic components: the telescopes, the wavelength-sorting device, and\nthe detectors. Let\u2019s first look at the development of the telescope.\nMany ancient cultures built special sites for observing the sky (Figure 6.3). At these ancientobservatories, they\ncould measure the positions of celestial objects, mostly to keep track of time and date. Many of these ancient\nobservatories had religious and ritual functions as well. The eye was the only device available to gather light,\nall of the colors in the light were observed at once, and the only permanent record of the observations was\nmade by human beings writing down or sketching what they saw.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.1 \u2022 Telescopes 177\nFigure6.3Two Pre-Telescopic Observatories.(a) Machu Picchu is a fifteenth century Incan site located in Peru. (b) Stonehenge, a\nprehistoric site (3000\u20132000 BCE), is located in England. (credit a: modification of work by Allard Schmidt)\nWhile HansLippershey, ZacchariasJanssen, and JacobMetiusare all credited with the invention of the\ntelescope around 1608\u2014applying for patents within weeks of each other\u2014it wasGalileowho, in 1610, used\nthis simple tube with lenses (which he called a spyglass) to observe the sky and gather more light than his\neyes alone could. Even his small telescope\u2014used over many nights\u2014revolutionized ideas about the nature of\nthe planets and the position of Earth.\nHow Telescopes Work\nTelescopes have come a long way since Galileo\u2019s time. Now they tend to be huge devices; the most expensive\ncost hundreds of millions to billions of dollars. (To provide some reference point, however, keep in mind that\njust renovating college football stadiums typically costs hundreds of millions of dollars\u2014with the most\nexpensive recent renovation, at Texas A&M University\u2019s Kyle Field, costing $450 million.) The reason\nastronomers keep building bigger and bigger telescopes is that celestial objects\u2014such as planets, stars, and\ngalaxies\u2014send much more light to Earth than any human eye (with its tiny opening) can catch, and bigger\ntelescopes can detect fainter objects. If you have ever watched the stars with a group of friends, you know that\nthere\u2019s plenty of starlight to go around; each of you can see each of the stars. If a thousand more people were\nwatching, each of them would also catch a bit of each star\u2019s light. Yet, as far as you are concerned, the light not\nshining into your eye is wasted. It would be great if some of this \u201cwasted\u201d light could also be captured and\nbrought to your eye. This is precisely what a telescope does.\nThe most important functions of a telescope are (1) tocollectthe faint light from an astronomical source and\n(2) tofocusall the light into a point or an image. Most objects of interest to astronomers are extremely faint:\nthe more light we can collect, the better we can study such objects. (And remember, even though we are\nfocusing on visible light first, there are many telescopes that collect other kinds of electromagnetic radiation.)\nTelescopes that collect visible radiation use a lens or mirror to gather the light. Other types of telescopes may\nuse collecting devices that look very different from the lenses and mirrors with which we are familiar, but they\nserve the same function. In all types of telescopes, the light-gathering ability is determined by the area of the\ndevice acting as the light-gathering \u201cbucket.\u201d Since most telescopes have mirrors or lenses, we can compare\ntheir light-gathering power by comparing theapertures, or diameters, of the opening through which light\ntravels or reflects.\nThe amount of light a telescope can collect increases with the size of the aperture. A telescope with a mirror\nthat is 4 meters in diameter can collect 16 times as much light as a telescope that is 1 meter in diameter. (The\ndiameter is squared because the area of a circle equals \u03c0d2/4, wheredis the diameter of the circle.) 178 6 \u2022 Astronomical Instruments\nEXAMPLE 6.1\nCalculating the Light-Collecting Area\nWhat is the area of a 1-m diameter telescope? A 4-m diameter one?\nSolution\nUsing the equation for the area of a circle,\nthe area of a 1-m telescope is\nand the area of a 4-m telescope is\nCheck Your Learning\nShow that the ratio of the two areas is 16:1.\nAnswer:\nTherefore, with 16 times the area, a 4-m telescope collects 16 times the light of a 1-m\ntelescope.\nAfter the telescope forms an image, we need some way to detect and record it so that we can measure,\nreproduce, and analyze the image in various ways. Before the nineteenth century, astronomers simply viewed\nimages with their eyes and wrote descriptions of what they saw. This was very inefficient and did not lead to a\nvery reliable long-term record; you know from crime shows on television that eyewitness accounts are often\ninaccurate.\nIn the nineteenth century, the use of photography became widespread. In those days, photographs were a\nchemical record of an image on a specially treated glass plate. Today, the image is generally detected with\nsensors similar to those in digital cameras, recorded electronically, and stored in computers. This permanent\nrecord can then be used for detailed and quantitative studies. Professional astronomers rarely look through\nthe large telescopes that they use for their research.\nFormation of an Image by a Lens or a Mirror\nWhether or not you wear glasses, you see the world through lenses; they are key elements of your eyes. A lens\nis a transparent piece of material that bends the rays of light passing through it. If the light rays are parallel as\nthey enter, the lens brings them together in one place to form an image (Figure 6.4). If the curvatures of the\nlens surfaces are just right, all parallel rays of light (say, from a star) are bent, orrefracted, in such a way that\nthey converge toward a point, called thefocusof the lens. At the focus, an image of the light source appears.\nIn the case of parallel light rays, the distance from the lens to the location where the light rays focus, or image,\nbehind the lens is called thefocal lengthof the lens.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.1 \u2022 Telescopes 179\nFigure6.4Formation of an Image by a Simple Lens.Parallel rays from a distant source are bent by the convex lens so that they all\ncome together in a single place (the focus) to form an image.\nAs you look atFigure 6.4, you may ask why two rays of light from the same star would be parallel to each\nother. After all, if you draw a picture of star shining in all directions, the rays of light coming from the star\ndon\u2019t look parallel at all. But remember that the stars (and other astronomical objects) are all extremely far\naway. By the time the few rays of light pointed toward us actually arrive at Earth, they are, for all practical\npurposes, parallel to each other. Put another way, any rays that werenotparallel to the ones pointed at Earth\nare now heading in some very different direction in the universe.\nTo view the image formed by the lens in a telescope, we use an additional lens called aneyepiece. The\neyepiece focuses the image at a distance that is either directly viewable by a human or at a convenient place\nfor a detector. Using different eyepieces, we can change themagnification(or size) of the image and also\nredirect the light to a more accessible location. Stars look like points of light, and magnifying them makes little\ndifference, but the image of a planet or a galaxy, which has structure, can often benefit from being magnified.\nMany people, when thinking of a telescope, picture a long tube with a large glass lens at one end. This design,\nwhich uses a lens as its main optical element to form an image, as we have been discussing, is known as a\nrefractor(Figure 6.5), and a telescope based on this design is called arefracting telescope. Galileo\u2019s\ntelescopes were refractors, as are today\u2019s binoculars and field glasses. However, there is a limit to the size of a\nrefracting telescope. The largest one ever built was a 49-inch refractor built for the Paris 1900 Exposition, and it\nwas dismantled after the Exposition. Currently, the largest refracting telescope is the 40-inch refractor at\nYerkes Observatory in Wisconsin. 180 6 \u2022 Astronomical Instruments\nFigure6.5Refracting and Reflecting Telescopes.Light enters a refracting telescope through a lens at the upper end, which\nfocuses the light near the bottom of the telescope. An eyepiece then magnifies the image so that it can be viewed by the eye, or a\ndetector like a photographic plate can be placed at the focus. The upper end of a reflecting telescope is open, and the light passes\nthrough to the mirror located at the bottom of the telescope. The mirror then focuses the light at the top end, where it can be\ndetected. Alternatively, as in this sketch, a second mirror may reflect the light to a position outside the telescope structure, where an\nobserver can have easier access to it. Professional astronomers\u2019 telescopes are more complicated than this, but they follow the same\nprinciples of reflection and refraction.\nOne problem with a refracting telescope is that the light must passthroughthe lens of a refractor. That means\nthe glass must be perfect all the way through, and it has proven very difficult to make large pieces of glass\nwithout flaws and bubbles in them. Also, optical properties of transparent materials change a little bit with the\nwavelengths (or colors) of light, so there is some additional distortion, known aschromatic aberration. Each\nwavelength focuses at a slightly different spot, causing the image to appear blurry.\nIn addition, since the light must pass through the lens, the lens can only be supported around its edges (just\nlike the frames of our eyeglasses). The force of gravity will cause a large lens to sag and distort the path of the\nlight rays as they pass through it. Finally, because the light passes through it, both sides of the lens must be\nmanufactured to precisely the right shape in order to produce a sharp image.\nA different type of telescope uses a concaveprimary mirroras its main optical element. The mirror is curved\nlike the inner surface of a sphere, and it reflects light in order to form an image (Figure 6.5). Telescope mirrors\nare coated with a shiny metal, usually silver, aluminum, or, occasionally, gold, to make them highly reflective. If\nthe mirror has the correct shape, all parallel rays are reflected back to the same point, the focus of the mirror.\nThus, images are produced by a mirror exactly as they are by a lens.\nTelescopes designed with mirrors avoid the problems of refracting telescopes. Because the light is reflected\nfrom the front surface only, flaws and bubbles within the glass do not affect the path of the light. In a\ntelescope designed with mirrors, only the front surface has to be manufactured to a precise shape, and the\nmirror can be supported from the back. For these reasons, most astronomical telescopes today (both amateur\nand professional) use a mirror rather than a lens to form an image; this type of telescope is called areflecting\ntelescope. The first successful reflecting telescope was built by Isaac Newton in 1668.\nIn a reflecting telescope, the concave mirror is placed at the bottom of a tube or open framework. The mirror\nreflects the light back up the tube to form an image near the front end at a location called theprime focus.\nThe image can be observed at the prime focus, or additional mirrors can intercept the light and redirect it to a\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.1 \u2022 Telescopes 181\nposition where the observer can view it more easily (Figure 6.6). Since an astronomer at the prime focus can\nblock much of the light coming to the main mirror, the use of a smallsecondary mirrorallows more light to\nget through the system.\nFigure6.6Focus Arrangements for Reflecting Telescopes.Reflecting telescopes have different options for where the light is\nbrought to a focus. With prime focus, light is detected where it comes to a focus after reflecting from the primary mirror. With\nNewtonian focus, light is reflected by a small secondary mirror off to one side, where it can be detected (see alsoFigure 6.5). Most\nlarge professional telescopes have a Cassegrain focus in which light is reflected by the secondary mirror down through a hole in the\nprimary mirror to an observing station below the telescope.\nMAKING CONNECTIONS\nChoosing Your Own Telescope\nIf the astronomy course you are taking whets your appetite for exploring the sky further, you may be\nthinking about buying your own telescope. Many excellent amateur telescopes are available, and some\nresearch is required to find the best model for your needs. Some good sources of information about\npersonal telescopes are the two popular US magazines aimed at amateur astronomers:Sky & Telescope\nandAstronomy. Both carry regular articles with advice, reviews, and advertisements from reputable\ntelescope dealers.\nSome of the factors that determine which telescope is right for you depend upon your preferences:\n\u2022 Will you be setting up the telescope in one place and leaving it there, or do you want an instrument\nthat is portable and can come with you on outdoor excursions? How portable should it be, in terms of\nsize and weight?\n\u2022 Do you want to observe the sky with your eyes only, or do you want to take photographs? (Long-\nexposure photography, for example, requires a good clock drive to turn your telescope to compensate\nfor Earth\u2019s rotation.)\n\u2022 What types of objects will you be observing? Are you interested primarily in comets, planets, star\nclusters, or galaxies, or do you want to observe all kinds of celestial sights?\nYou may not know the answers to some of these questions yet. For this reason, you may want to \u201ctest- 182 6 \u2022 Astronomical Instruments\ndrive\u201d some telescopes first. Most communities have amateur astronomy clubs that sponsor star parties\nopen to the public. The members of those clubs often know a lot about telescopes and can share their ideas\nwith you. Your instructor may know where the nearest amateur astronomy club meets; or, to find a club\nnear you, use the websites suggested inAppendix B.\nFurthermore, you may already have an instrument like a telescope at home (or have access to one through\na relative or friend). Many amateur astronomers recommend starting your survey of the sky with a good\npair of binoculars. These are easily carried around and can show you many objects not visible (or clear) to\nthe unaided eye.\nWhen you are ready to purchase a telescope, you might find the following ideas useful:\n\u2022 The key characteristic of a telescope is the aperture of the main mirror or lens; when someone says\nthey have a 6-inch or 8-inch telescope, they mean the diameter of the collecting surface. The larger the\naperture, the more light you can gather, and the fainter the objects you can see or photograph.\n\u2022 Telescopes of a given aperture that use lenses (refractors) are typically more expensive than those\nusing mirrors (reflectors) because both sides of a lens must be polished to great accuracy. And,\nbecause the light passes through it, the lens must be made of high-quality glass throughout. In\ncontrast, only the front surface of a mirror must be accurately polished.\n\u2022 Magnification is not one of the criteria on which to base your choice of a telescope. As we discussed,\nthe magnification of the image is done by a smaller eyepiece, so the magnification can be adjusted by\nchanging eyepieces. However, a telescope will magnify not only the astronomical object you are\nviewing but also the turbulence of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. If the magnification is too high, your image will\nshimmer and shake and be difficult to view. A good telescope will come with a variety of eyepieces that\nstay within the range of useful magnification.\n\u2022 The mount of a telescope (the structure on which it rests) is one of its most critical elements. Because a\ntelescope shows a tiny field of view, which is magnified significantly, even the smallest vibration or\njarring of the telescope can move the object you are viewing around or out of your field of view. A\nsturdy and stable mount is essential for serious viewing or photography (although it clearly affects how\nportable your telescope can be).\n\u2022 A telescope requires some practice to set up and use effectively. Don\u2019t expect everything to go\nperfectly on your first try. Take some time to read the instructions. If a local amateur astronomy club is\nnearby, use it as a resource.\n6.2 Telescopes Today\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nRecognize the largest visible-light and infrared telescopes in operation today\nDiscuss the factors relevant to choosing an appropriate telescope site\nDefine the technique of adaptive optics and describe the effects of the atmosphere on astronomical\nobservations\nSince Newton\u2019s time, when the sizes of the mirrors in telescopes were measured in inches, reflecting\ntelescopes have grown ever larger. In 1948, US astronomers built a telescope with a 5-meter (200-inch)\ndiameter mirror on Palomar Mountain in Southern California. It remained the largest visible-light telescope in\nthe world for several decades. The giants of today, however, have primary mirrors (the largest mirrors in the\ntelescope) that are 8- to 10-meters in diameter, and larger ones are being built (Figure 6.7).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.2 \u2022 Telescopes Today 183\nFigure6.7Large Telescope Mirror.This image shows one of the primary mirrors of the European Southern Observatory\u2019s Very\nLarge Telescope, named Yepun, just after it was recoated with aluminum.

Huedepohl)\nModern Visible-Light and Infrared Telescopes\nThe decades starting in 1990 saw telescope building around the globe grow at an unprecedented rate. (See\nTable 6.1, which also includes websites for each telescope in case you want to visit or learn more about them.)\nTechnological advancements had finally made it possible to build telescopes significantly larger than the\n5-meter telescope at Palomar at a reasonable cost.

The Palomar telescope is a massive steel structure designed to hold the 14.5-ton\nprimary mirror with a 5-meter diameter. Glass tends to sag under its own weight; hence, a huge steel\nstructure is needed to hold the mirror. A mirror 8 meters in diameter, the size of the Gemini North telescope, if\nit were built using the same technology as the Palomar telescope, would have to weigh at least eight times as\nmuch and would require an enormous steel structure to support it.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.2 \u2022 Telescopes Today 185\nFigure6.8Modern Reflecting Telescopes.(a) The Palomar 5-meter reflector: The Hale telescope on Palomar Mountain has a\ncomplex mounting structure that enables the telescope (in the open \u201ctube\u201d pointing upward in this photo) to swing easily into any\nposition.

(credit a: modification of work by Caltech/Palomar Observatory; credit b:\nmodification of work by Gemini Observatory/AURA)\nThe 8-meter Gemini North telescope looks like a featherweight by contrast, and indeed it is. The mirror is only\nabout 8 inches thick and weighs 24.5 tons, less than twice as much as the Palomar mirror. The Gemini North\ntelescope was completed about 50 years after the Palomar telescope. Engineers took advantage of new\ntechnologies to build a telescope that is much lighter in weight relative to the size of the primary mirror. The\nGemini mirror does sag, but with modern computers, it is possible to measure that sag many times each\nsecond and apply forces at 120 different locations to the back of the mirror to correct the sag, a process called\nactive control. Seventeen telescopes with mirrors 6.5 meters in diameter and larger have been constructed\nsince 1990.\nThe twin 10-meter Keck telescopes on Maunakea, which were the first of these new-technology instruments,\nuse precision control in an entirely novel way. Instead of a single primary mirror 10 meters in diameter, each\nKeck telescope achieves its larger aperture by combining the light from 36 separate hexagonal mirrors, each\n1.8 meters wide (Figure 6.9). Computer-controlled actuators (motors) constantly adjust these 36 mirrors so\nthat the overall reflecting surface acts like a single mirror with just the right shape to collect and focus the light\ninto a sharp image. 186 6 \u2022 Astronomical Instruments\nFigure6.9Thirty-Six Eyes Are Better Than One.The mirror of the 10-meter Keck telescope is composed of 36 hexagonal sections.\n(credit: NASA)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nLearn more about theKeck Observatory on Maunakea(https://openstax.org/l/30KeckObserv)through this\nHistory Channel clip on the telescopes and the work that they do.\nIn addition to holding the mirror, the steel structure of a telescope is designed so that the entire telescope can\nbe pointed quickly toward any object in the sky. Since Earth is rotating, the telescope must have a motorized\ndrive system that moves it very smoothly from east to west at exactly the same rate that Earth is rotating from\nwest to east, so it can continue to point at the object being observed. All this machinery must be housed in a\ndome to protect the telescope from the elements. The dome has an opening in it that can be positioned in\nfront of the telescope and moved along with it, so that the light from the objects being observed is not\nblocked.\nVOYAGERS IN ASTRONOMY\nGeorge Ellery Hale: Master Telescope Builder\nGeorge ElleryHale(Figure 6.10) was a giant among early telescope builders. Not once, but four times, he\ninitiated projects that led to the construction of what was the world\u2019s largest telescope at the time. And he\nwas a master at winning over wealthy benefactors to underwrite the construction of these new\ninstruments.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.2 \u2022 Telescopes Today 187\nFigure6.10George Ellery Hale (1868\u20131938).Hale\u2019s work led to the construction of several major telescopes, including the\n40-inch refracting telescope at Yerkes Observatory, and three reflecting telescopes: the 60-inch Hale and 100-inch Hooker\ntelescopes at Mount Wilson Observatory, and the 200-inch Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory.\nHale\u2019s training and early research were in solar physics. In 1892, at age 24, he was named associate\nprofessor of astral physics and director of the astronomical observatory at the University of Chicago. At the\ntime, the largest telescope in the world was the 36-inch refractor at the Lick Observatory near San Jose,\nCalifornia. Taking advantage of an existing glass blank for a 40-inch telescope, Hale set out to raise money\nfor a larger telescope than the one at Lick. One prospective donor was Charles T.Yerkes, who, among other\nthings, ran the trolley system in Chicago.\nHale wrote to Yerkes, encouraging him to support the construction of the giant telescope by saying that\n\u201cthe donor could have no more enduring monument. It is certain that Mr. Lick\u2019s name would not have been\nnearly so widely known today were it not for the famous observatory established as a result of his\nmunificence.\u201d Yerkes agreed, and the new telescope was completed in May 1897; it remains the largest\nrefractor in the world (Figure 6.11). 188 6 \u2022 Astronomical Instruments\nFigure6.11World\u2019s Largest Refractor.The Yerkes 40-inch (1-meter) telescope.\nEven before the completion of the Yerkes refractor, Hale was not only dreaming of building a still larger\ntelescope but was also taking concrete steps to achieve that goal. In the 1890s, there was a major\ncontroversy about the relative quality of refracting and reflecting telescopes. Hale realized that 40 inches\nwas close to the maximum feasible aperture for refracting telescopes. If telescopes with significantly larger\napertures were to be built, they would have to be reflecting telescopes.\nUsing funds borrowed from his own family, Hale set out to construct a 60-inch reflector. For a site, he left\nthe Midwest for the much better conditions on Mount Wilson\u2014at the time, a wilderness peak above the\nsmall city of Los Angeles. In 1904, at the age of 36, Hale received funds from the Carnegie Foundation to\nestablish the Mount Wilson Observatory. The 60-inch mirror was placed in its mount in December 1908.\nTwo years earlier, in 1906, Hale had already approached John D. Hooker, who had made his fortune in\nhardware and steel pipe, with a proposal to build a 100-inch telescope. The technological risks were\nsubstantial. The 60-inch telescope was not yet complete, and the usefulness of large reflectors for\nastronomy had yet to be demonstrated. George Ellery Hale\u2019s brother called him \u201cthe greatest gambler in\nthe world.\u201d Once again, Hale successfully obtained funds, and the 100-inch telescope was completed in\nNovember 1917. (It was with this telescope that EdwinHubblewas able to establish that the spiral nebulae\nwere separate islands of stars\u2014or galaxies\u2014quite removed from our own Milky Way.)\nHale was not through dreaming. In 1926, he wrote an article inHarper\u2019s Magazineabout the scientific value\nof a still larger telescope. This article came to the attention of the Rockefeller Foundation, which granted $6\nmillion for the construction of a 200-inch telescope. Hale died in 1938, but the 200-inch (5-meter) telescope\non Palomar Mountain was dedicated 10 years later and is now named in Hale\u2019s honor.\nPicking the Best Observing Sites\nA telescope like the Gemini or Keck telescope costs about $100 million to build. That kind of investment\ndemands that the telescope be placed in the best possible site. Since the end of the nineteenth century,\nastronomers have realized that the best observatory sites are on mountains, far from the lights and pollution\nof cities. Although a number of urban observatories remain, especially in the large cities of Europe, they have\nbecome administrative centers or museums. The real action takes place far away, often on desert mountains\nor isolated peaks in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, where we find the staff\u2019s living quarters, computers,\nelectronic and machine shops, and of course the telescopes themselves. A large observatory today requires a\nsupporting staff of 20 to 100 people in addition to the astronomers.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.2 \u2022 Telescopes Today 189\nThe performance of a telescope is determined not only by the size of its mirror but also by its location. Earth\u2019s\natmosphere, so vital to life, presents challenges for the observational astronomer. In at least four ways, our air\nimposes limitations on the usefulness of telescopes:\n1. The most obvious limitation is weather conditions such as clouds, wind, and rain. At the best sites, the\nweather is clear as much as 75% of the time.\n2. Even on a clear night, the atmosphere filters out a certain amount of starlight, especially in the infrared,\nwhere the absorption is due primarily to water vapor. Astronomers therefore prefer dry sites, generally\nfound at high altitudes.\n3. The sky above the telescope should be dark. Near cities, the air scatters the glare from lights, producing\nan illumination that hides the faintest stars and limits the distances that can be probed by telescopes.\n(Astronomers call this effectlight pollution.) Observatories are best located at least 100 miles from the\nnearest large city.\n4. Finally, the air is often unsteady; light passing through this turbulent air is disturbed, resulting in blurred\nstar images. Astronomers call these effects \u201cbadseeing.\u201d When seeing is bad, images of celestial objects\nare distorted by the constant twisting and bending of light rays by turbulent air.\nThe best observatory sites are therefore high, dark, and dry. The world\u2019s largest telescopes are found in such\nremote mountain locations as the Andes Mountains of Chile (Figure 6.12), the desert peaks of Arizona, the\nCanary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, and Maunakea in Hawaii, a dormant volcano with an altitude of 13,700\nfeet (4200 meters).\nLINK TO LEARNING\nLight pollution is a problem not just for professional astronomers but for everyone who wants to enjoy the\nbeauty of the night sky. In addition research is now showing that it can disrupt the life cycle of animals with\nwhom we share the urban and suburban landscape. And the light wasted shining into the sky leads to\nunnecessary municipal expenses and use of fossil fuels. Concerned people have formed an organization,\nthe International Dark-Sky Association, whosewebsite(https://openstax.org/l/30IntDSA)is full of good\ninformation. A citizen science project calledGlobe at Night(https://openstax.org/l/30GlbatNght)allows you\nto measure the light levels in your community by counting stars and to compare it to others around the\nworld. Recently, a new threat to dark skies has emerged. A number of commercial companies are planning\nand launching large swarms of satellites into low-Earth orbit to provide internet access around the world.\nUnfortunately, these satellites reflect sunlight and have already begun to ruin astronomical photographs\nthe world over. See theFurther Explorationsection at the end of this chapter for more resources on this\ntopic. If you get interested in this topic and want to do a paper for your astronomy course or another\ncourse while you are in college, theDark Night Skiesguide(https://openstax.org/l/30DNSGuide)can point\nyou to a variety of resources on the topic. 190 6 \u2022 Astronomical Instruments\nFigure6.12High and Dry Site.Cerro Paranal, a mountain summit 2.7 kilometers above sea level in Chile\u2019s Atacama Desert, is the\nsite of the European Southern Observatory\u2019s Very Large Telescope. This photograph shows the four 8-meter telescope buildings on\nthe site and vividly illustrates that astronomers prefer high, dry sites for their instruments. The 4.1-meter Visible and Infrared Survey\nTelescope for Astronomy (VISTA) can be seen in the distance on the next mountain peak. (credit: ESO)\nThe Resolution of a Telescope\nIn addition to gathering as much light as they can, astronomers also want to have the sharpest images\npossible.Resolutionrefers to the precision of detail present in an image: that is, the smallest features that can\nbe distinguished. Astronomers are always eager to make out more detail in the images they study, whether\nthey are following the weather on Jupiter or trying to peer into the violent heart of a \u201ccannibal galaxy\u201d that\nrecently ate its neighbor for lunch.\nOne factor that determines how good the resolution will be is the size of the telescope. Larger apertures\nproduce sharper images. Until very recently, however, visible-light and infrared telescopes on Earth\u2019s surface\ncould not produce images as sharp as the theory of light said they should.\nThe problem\u2014as we saw earlier in this chapter\u2014is our planet\u2019s atmosphere, which is turbulent. It contains\nmany small-scale blobs or cells of gas that range in size from inches to several feet. Each cell has a slightly\ndifferent temperature from its neighbor, and each cell acts like a lens, bending (refracting) the path of the light\nby a small amount. This bending slightly changes the position where each light ray finally reaches the detector\nin a telescope. The cells of air are in motion, constantly being blown through the light path of the telescope by\nwinds, often in different directions at different altitudes. As a result, the path followed by the light is constantly\nchanging.\nFor an analogy, think about watching a parade from a window high up in a skyscraper. You decide to throw\nsome confetti down toward the marchers. Even if you drop a handful all at the same time and in the same\ndirection, air currents will toss the pieces around, and they will reach the ground at different places. As we\ndescribed earlier, we can think of the light from the stars as a series of parallel beams, each making its way\nthrough the atmosphere. Each path will be slightly different, and each will reach the detector of the telescope\nat a slightly different place. The result is a blurred image, and because the cells are being blown by the wind,\nthe nature of the blur will change many times each second. You have probably noticed this effect as the\n\u201ctwinkling\u201d of stars seen from Earth. The light beams are bent enough that part of the time they reach your\neye, and part of the time some of them miss, thereby making the star seem to vary in brightness. In space,\nhowever, the light of the stars is steady.\nAstronomers search the world for locations where the amount of atmospheric blurring, or turbulence, is as\nsmall as possible. It turns out that the best sites are in coastal mountain ranges and on isolated volcanic peaks\nin the middle of an ocean. Air that has flowed long distances over water before it encounters land is especially\nstable.\nThe resolution of an image is measured in units of angle on the sky, typically in units of arcseconds. One\narcsecond is 1/3600 degree, and there are 360 degrees in a full circle. So we are talking about tiny angles on\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.2 \u2022 Telescopes Today 191\nthe sky. To give you a sense of just how tiny, we might note that 1 arcsecond is how big a quarter would look\nwhen seen from a distance of 5 kilometers. The best images obtained from the ground with traditional\ntechniques reveal details as small as several tenths of an arcsecond across. This image size is remarkably\ngood. One of the main reasons for launching theHubble Space Telescopewas to escape Earth\u2019s atmosphere\nand obtain even sharper images.\nBut since we can\u2019t put every telescope into space, astronomers have devised a technique calledadaptive\nopticsthat can beat Earth\u2019s atmosphere at its own game of blurring. This technique (which is most effective in\nthe infrared region of the spectrum with our current technology) makes use of a small flexible mirror placed in\nthe beam of a telescope. A sensor measures how much the atmosphere has distorted the image, and as often\nas 500 times per second, it sends instructions to the flexible mirror on how to change shape in order to\ncompensate for distortions produced by the atmosphere. The light is thus brought back to an almost perfectly\nsharp focus at the detector.Figure 6.13shows just how effective this technique is. With adaptive optics,\nground-based telescopes can achieve resolutions of 0.1 arcsecond or a little better in the infrared region of the\nspectrum. This impressive figure is the equivalent of the resolution that the Hubble Space Telescope achieves\nin the visible-light region of the spectrum.\nFigure6.13Power of Adaptive Optics.One of the clearest pictures ofJupiterever taken from the ground, this image was produced\nwith adaptive optics using an 8-meter-diameter telescope at the Very Large Telescope in Chile. Adaptive optics uses infrared\nwavelengths to remove atmospheric blurring, resulting in a much clearer image.

Most astronomers do not live at\nobservatories, but near the universities or laboratories where they work. An astronomer might spend only a\nweek or so each year observing at the telescope and the rest of the time measuring or analyzing the data\nacquired from large project collaborations and dedicated surveys. Many astronomers use radio telescopes\nfor space experiments, which work just as well during the daylight hours. Still others work at purely\ntheoretical problems using supercomputers and never observe at a telescope of any kind. 192 6 \u2022 Astronomical Instruments\nEven when astronomers are observing with large telescopes, they seldom peer through them. Electronic\ndetectors permanently record the data for detailed analysis later. At some observatories, observations may\nbe made remotely, with the astronomer sitting at a computer thousands of miles away from the telescope.\nTime on major telescopes is at a premium, and an observatory director will typically receive many more\nrequests for telescope time than can be accommodated during the year. Astronomers must therefore write\na convincing proposal explaining how they would like to use the telescope and why their observations will\nbe important to the progress of astronomy. A committee of astronomers is then asked to judge and rank\nthe proposals, and time is assigned only to those with the greatest merit. Even if your proposal is among\nthe high-rated ones, you may have to wait many months for your turn. If the skies are cloudy on the nights\nyou have been assigned, it may be more than a year before you get another chance.\nSome older astronomers still remember long, cold nights spent alone in an observatory dome, with only\nmusic from a tape recorder or an all-night radio station for company. The sight of the stars shining\nbrilliantly hour after hour through the open slit in the observatory dome was unforgettable. So, too, was\nthe relief as the first pale light of dawn announced the end of a 12-hour observation session. Astronomy is\nmuch easier today, with teams of observers working together, often at their computers, in a warm room.\nThose who are more nostalgic, however, might argue that some of the romance has gone from the field,\ntoo.\n6.3 Visible-Light Detectors and Instruments\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the difference between photographic plates and charge-coupled devices\nDescribe the unique difficulties associated with infrared observations and their solutions\nDescribe how a spectrometer works\nAfter a telescope collects radiation from an astronomical source, the radiation must bedetectedand\nmeasured. The first detector used for astronomical observations was the human eye, but it suffers from being\nconnected to an imperfect recording and retrieving device\u2014the human brain. Photography and modern\nelectronic detectors have eliminated the quirks of human memory by making a permanent record of the\ninformation from the cosmos.\nThe eye also suffers from having a very shortintegration time; it takes only a fraction of a second to add light\nenergy together before sending the image to the brain. One important advantage of modern detectors is that\nthe light from astronomical objects can be collected by the detector over longer periods of time; this technique\nis called \u201ctaking a long exposure.\u201d Exposures of several hours are required to detect very faint objects in the\ncosmos.\nBefore the light reaches the detector, astronomers today normally use some type of instrument to sort the\nlight according to wavelength. The instrument may be as simple as colored filters, which transmit light within a\nspecified range of wavelengths. A red transparent plastic is an everyday example of a filter that transmits only\nthe red light and blocks the other colors. After the light passes through a filter, it forms an image that\nastronomers can then use to measure the apparent brightness and color of objects. We will show you many\nexamples of such images in the later chapters of this book, and we will describe what we can learn from them.\nAlternatively, the instrument between telescope and detector may be one of several devices that spread the\nlight out into its full rainbow of colors so that astronomers can measure individual lines in the spectrum. Such\nan instrument (which you learned about in the chapter onRadiation and Spectra) is called aspectrometer\nbecause it allows astronomers to measure (to meter) the spectrum of a source of radiation. Whether a filter or\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.3 \u2022 Visible-Light Detectors and Instruments 193\na spectrometer, both types of wavelength-sorting instruments still have to use detectors to record and\nmeasure the properties of light.\nPhotographic and Electronic Detectors\nThroughout most of the twentieth century, photographic film orglass platesserved as the prime astronomical\ndetectors, whether for photographing spectra or direct images of celestial objects. In a photographic plate, a\nlight-sensitive chemical coating is applied to a piece of glass that, when developed, provides a lasting record of\nthe image. At observatories around the world, vast collections of photographs preserve what the sky has\nlooked like during the past 100 years. Photography represents a huge improvement over the human eye, but it\nstill has limitations. Photographic films are inefficient: only about 1% of the light that actually falls on the film\ncontributes to the chemical change that makes the image; the rest is wasted.\nAstronomers today have much more efficient electronic detectors to record astronomical images. Most often,\nthese arecharge-coupled devices (CCDs), which are similar to the detectors used in video camcorders or in\ndigital cameras (like the one more and more students have on their cell phones) (seeFigure 6.14). In a CCD,\nphotons of radiation hitting any part of the detector generate a stream of charged particles (electrons) that\nare stored and counted at the end of the exposure. Each place where the radiation is counted is called a pixel\n(picture element), and modern detectors can count the photons in millions of pixels (megapixels, or MPs).\nFigure6.14Charge-Coupled Devices (CCDs).(a) This CCD is a mere 300-micrometers thick (thinner than a human hair) yet holds\nmore than 21 million pixels. (b) This matrix of 42 CCDs served the Kepler telescope. (credit a: modification of work by US Department\nof Energy; credit b: modification of work by NASA and Ball Aerospace)\nBecause CCDs typically record as much as 60\u201370% of all the photons that strike them, and the best silicon and\ninfrared CCDs exceed 90% sensitivity, we can detect much fainter objects. Among these are many small moons\naround the outer planets, icy dwarf planets beyond Pluto, and dwarf galaxies of stars. CCDs also provide more\naccurate measurements of the brightness of astronomical objects than photography, and their output is\ndigital\u2014in the form of numbers that can go directly into a computer for analysis.\nInfrared Observations\nObserving the universe in the infrared band of the spectrum presents some additional challenges. The\ninfrared region extends from wavelengths near 1 micrometer (\u00b5m), which is about the long wavelength\nsensitivity limit of both CCDs and photography, to 100 micrometers or longer. Recall from the discussion on\nradiation and spectra that infrared is \u201cheat radiation\u201d (given off at temperatures that we humans are\ncomfortable with). The main challenge to astronomers using infrared is to distinguish between the tiny\namount of heat radiation that reaches Earth from stars and galaxies, and the much greater heat radiated by 194 6 \u2022 Astronomical Instruments\nthe telescope itself and our planet\u2019s atmosphere.\nTypical temperatures on Earth\u2019s surface are near 300 K, and the atmosphere through which observations are\nmade is only a little cooler. According to Wien\u2019s law (from the chapter onRadiation and Spectra), the\ntelescope, the observatory, and even the sky are radiating infrared energy with a peak wavelength of about 10\nmicrometers. To infrared eyes, everything on Earth is brightly aglow\u2014including the telescope and camera\n(Figure 6.15). The challenge is to detect faint cosmic sources against this sea of infrared light. Another way to\nlook at this is that an astronomer using infrared must always contend with the situation that a visible-light\nobserver would face if working in broad daylight with a telescope and optics lined with bright fluorescent\nlights.\nFigure6.15Infrared Eyes.Infrared waves can penetrate places in the universe from which light is blocked, as shown in this infrared\nimage where the plastic bag blocks visible light but not infrared. (credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/R. Hurt (SSC))\nTo solve this problem, astronomers must protect the infrared detector from nearby radiation, just as you\nwould shield photographic film from bright daylight. Since anything warm radiates infrared energy, the\ndetector must be isolated in very cold surroundings; often, it is held near absolute zero (1 to 3 K) by immersing\nit in liquid helium. The second step is to reduce the radiation emitted by the telescope structure and optics,\nand to block this heat from reaching the infrared detector.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCheck outThe Infrared Zoo(https://openstax.org/l/30IFZoo)to get a sense of what familiar objects look\nlike with infrared radiation. Slide the slider to change the wavelength of radiation for the picture, and click\nthe arrow to see other animals.\nSpectroscopy\nSpectroscopy is one of the astronomer\u2019s most powerful tools, providing information about the composition,\ntemperature, motion, and other characteristics of celestial objects. More than half of the time spent on most\nlarge telescopes is used for spectroscopy.\nThe many different wavelengths present in light can be separated by passing them through a spectrometer to\nform a spectrum. The design of a simple spectrometer is illustrated inFigure 6.16. Light from the source\n(actually, the image of a source produced by the telescope) enters the instrument through a small hole or\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.4 \u2022 Radio Telescopes 195\nnarrow slit, and is collimated (made into a beam of parallel rays) by a lens. The light then passes through a\nprism, producing a spectrum: different wavelengths leave the prism in different directions because each\nwavelength is bent by a different amount when it enters and leaves the prism. A second lens placed behind\nthe prism focuses the many different images of the slit or entrance hole onto a CCD or other detecting device.\nThis collection of images (spread out by color) is the spectrum that astronomers can then analyze at a later\npoint. As spectroscopy spreads the light out into more and more collecting bins, fewer photons go into each\nbin, so either a larger telescope is needed or the integration time must be greatly increased\u2014usually both.\nFigure6.16Prism Spectrometer.The light from the telescope is focused on a slit. A prism (or grating) disperses the light into a\nspectrum, which is then photographed or recorded electronically.\nIn practice, astronomers today are more likely to use a different device, called agrating, to disperse the\nspectrum. A grating is a piece of material with thousands of grooves on its surface. While it functions\ncompletely differently, a grating, like a prism, also spreads light out into a spectrum.\n6.4 Radio Telescopes\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe how radio waves from space are detected\nIdentify the world\u2019s largest radio telescopes\nDefine the technique of interferometry and discuss the benefits of interferometers over single-dish\ntelescopes\nIn addition to visible and infrared radiation, radio waves from astronomical objects can also be detected from\nthe surface of Earth. In the early 1930s, Karl G.Jansky, an engineer at Bell Telephone Laboratories, was\nexperimenting with antennas for long-range radio communication when he encountered some mysterious\nstatic\u2014radio radiation coming from an unknown source (Figure 6.17). He discovered that this radiation came\nin strongest about four minutes earlier on each successive day and correctly concluded that since Earth\u2019s\nsidereal rotation period (how long it takes us to rotate relative to the stars) is four minutes shorter than a solar\nday, the radiation must be originating from some region fixed on the celestial sphere. Subsequent\ninvestigation showed that the source of this radiation was part of theMilky Way Galaxy; Jansky had discovered\nthe first source of cosmic radio waves. 196 6 \u2022 Astronomical Instruments\nFigure6.17First Radio Telescope.This rotating radio antenna was used by Jansky in his serendipitous discovery of radio radiation\nfrom the Milky Way.\nIn 1936, GroteReber, who was an amateur astronomer interested in radio communications, used galvanized\niron and wood to build the first antenna specifically designed to receive cosmic radio waves. Over the years,\nReber built several such antennas and used them to carry out pioneering surveys of the sky for celestial radio\nsources; he remained active in radio astronomy for more than 30 years. During the first decade, he worked\npractically alone because professional astronomers had not yet recognized the vast potential of radio\nastronomy.\nDetection of Radio Energy from Space\nIt is important to understand that radio waves cannot be \u201cheard\u201d: they are not the sound waves you hear\ncoming out of the radio receiver in your home or car. Like light, radio waves are a form of electromagnetic\nradiation, but unlike light, we cannot detect them with our senses\u2014we must rely on electronic equipment to\npick them up. In commercial radio broadcasting, we encode sound information (music or a newscaster\u2019s voice)\ninto radio waves. These must be decoded at the other end and then turned back into sound by speakers or\nheadphones.\nThe radio waves we receive from space do not, of course, have music or other program information encoded\nin them. If cosmic radio signals were translated into sound, they would sound like the static you hear when\nscanning between stations. Nevertheless, there is information in the radio waves we receive\u2014information that\ncan tell us about the chemistry and physical conditions of the sources of the waves.\nJust as vibrating charged particles can produce electromagnetic waves (see theRadiation and Spectra\nchapter), electromagnetic waves can make charged particles move back and forth. Radio waves can produce a\ncurrent in conductors of electricity such as metals. An antenna is such a conductor: it intercepts radio waves,\nwhich create a feeble current in it. The current is then amplified in a radio receiver until it is strong enough to\nmeasure or record. Like your television or radio, receivers can be tuned to select a single frequency (channel).\nIn astronomy, however, it is more common to use sophisticated data-processing techniques that allow\nthousands of separate frequency bands to be detected simultaneously. Thus, the astronomical radio receiver\noperates much like a spectrometer on a visible-light or infrared telescope, providing information about how\nmuch radiation we receive at each wavelength or frequency. After computer processing, the radio signals are\nrecorded on magnetic disks for further analysis.\nRadio waves are reflected by conducting surfaces, just as light is reflected from a shiny metallic surface, and\naccording to the same laws of optics. A radio-reflecting telescope consists of a concave metal reflector (called a\ndish), analogous to a telescope mirror. The radio waves collected by the dish are reflected to a focus, where\nthey can then be directed to a receiver and analyzed. Because humans are such visual creatures, radio\nastronomers often construct a pictorial representation of the radio sources they observe.Figure 6.18shows\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.4 \u2022 Radio Telescopes 197\nsuch a radio image of a distant galaxy, where radio telescopes reveal vast jets and complicated regions of\nradio emissions that are completely invisible in photographs taken with light.\nFigure6.18Radio Image.This image has been constructed of radio observations at the Very Large Array of a galaxy called Cygnus\nA. Colors have been added to help the eye sort out regions of different radio intensities. Red regions are the most intense, blue the\nleast. The visible galaxy would be a small dot in the center of the image. The radio image reveals jets of expelled material (more than\n160,000 light-years long) on either side of the galaxy. (credit: NRAO/AUI)\nRadio astronomy is a young field compared with visible-light astronomy, but it has experienced tremendous\ngrowth in recent decades. The world\u2019s largest radio reflectors that can be pointed to any direction in the sky\nhave apertures of 100 meters.

The longer the\nwaves, the harder it is to resolve fine detail in the images or maps we make. Because radio waves have such\nlong wavelengths, they present tremendous challenges for astronomers who need good resolution. In fact,\neven the largest radio dishes on Earth, operating alone, cannot make out as much detail as the typical small\nvisible-light telescope used in a college astronomy lab. To overcome this difficulty, radio astronomers have\nlearned to sharpen their images by linking two or more radio telescopes together electronically. Two or more\ntelescopes linked together in this way are called aninterferometer.\n\u201cInterferometer\u201d may seem like a strange term because the telescopes in an interferometer work\ncooperatively; they don\u2019t \u201cinterfere\u201d with each other.Interference, however, is a technical term for the way\nthat multiple waves interact with each other when they arrive in our instruments, and this interaction allows us\nto coax more detail out of our observations. The resolution of an interferometer depends upon the separation\nof the telescopes, not upon their individual apertures. Two telescopes separated by 1 kilometer provide the\nsame resolution as would a single dish 1 kilometer across (although they are not, of course, able to collect as\nmuch radiation as a radio-wave bucket that is 1 kilometer across).\nTo get even better resolution, astronomers combine a large number of radio dishes into aninterferometer\narray. In effect, such an array works like a large number of two-dish interferometers, all observing the same 200 6 \u2022 Astronomical Instruments\npart of the sky together. Computer processing of the results permits the reconstruction of a high-resolution\nradio image. The most extensive such instrument in the United States is the National Radio Astronomy\nObservatory\u2019s Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) near Socorro, New Mexico. It consists of 27 movable radio\ntelescopes (on railroad tracks), each having an aperture of 25 meters, spread over a total span of about 36\nkilometers. By electronically combining the signals from all of its individual telescopes, this array permits the\nradio astronomer to make pictures of the sky at radio wavelengths comparable to those obtained with a\nvisible-light telescope, with a resolution of about 1 arcsecond.\nThe Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter array (ALMA) in the Atacama Desert of Northern Chile (Figure\n6.20), at an altitude of 16,400 feet, consists of 12 7-meter and 54 12-meter telescopes, and can achieve\nbaselines up to 16 kilometers. Since it became operational in 2013, it has made observations at resolutions\ndown to 6 milliarcseconds (0.006 arcseconds), a remarkable achievement for radio astronomy.\nFigure6.20Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA).Located in the Atacama Desert of Northern Chile, ALMA\ncurrently provides the highest resolution for radio observations. (credit: ESO/S. Guisard)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch thisdocumentary(https://openstax.org/l/30ALMAdoc)that explains the work that went into\ndesigning and building ALMA, discusses some of its first images, and explores its future.\nInitially, the size of interferometer arrays was limited by the requirement that all of the dishes be physically\nwired together. The maximum dimensions of the array were thus only a few tens of kilometers. However,\nlarger interferometer separations can be achieved if the telescopes do not require a physical connection.\nAstronomers, with the use of current technology and computing power, have learned to time the arrival of\nelectromagnetic waves coming from space very precisely at each telescope and combine the data later. If the\ntelescopes are as far apart as California and Australia, or as West Virginia and Crimea in Ukraine, the resulting\nresolution far surpasses that of visible-light telescopes.\nThe United States operates the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), made up of 10 individual telescopes\nstretching from the Virgin Islands to Hawaii (Figure 6.21). The VLBA, completed in 1993, can form astronomical\nimages with a resolution of 0.0001 arcseconds, permitting features as small as 10 astronomical units (AU) to be\ndistinguished at the center of our Galaxy.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.4 \u2022 Radio Telescopes 201\nFigure6.21Very Long Baseline Array.This map shows the distribution of 10 antennas that constitute an array of radio telescopes\nstretching across the United States and its territories.\nRecent advances in technology have also made it possible to do interferometry at visible-light and infrared\nwavelengths. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, three observatories with multiple telescopes each\nbegan using their dishes as interferometers, combining their light to obtain a much greater resolution. In\naddition, a dedicated interferometric array was built on Mt. Wilson in California. Just as in radio arrays, these\nobservations allow astronomers to make out more detail than a single telescope could provide.\nVisible-Light Interferometers\nLongest Telescope Name Location Mirrors Status\nBaseline (m)\nCHARAArray (Center for High Angular Mount Six 1-m Operational\n400\nResolution Astronomy) Wilson, CA telescopes since 2004\nCerro\nFour 8.2-m\n200 Very Large Telescope Paranal, Completed 2000\ntelescopes\nChile\nMaunakea, Two 10-m Operated from\n85 Keck I and IItelescopes\nHI telescopes 2001 to 2012\nMount Two 8.4-m\n22.8 Large Binocular Telescope First light 2004\nGraham, AZ telescopes\nTable6.3\nRadar Astronomy\nRadaris the technique of transmitting radio waves to an object in our solar system and then detecting the\nradio radiation that the object reflects back. The time required for the round trip can be measured\nelectronically with great precision. Because we know the speed at which radio waves travel (the speed of light),\nwe can determine the distance to the object or a particular feature on its surface (such as a mountain).\nRadar observations have been used to determine the distances to planets and how fast things are moving in\nthe solar system (using the Doppler effect, discussed in theRadiation and Spectrachapter). Radar waves have\nplayed important roles in navigating spacecraft throughout the solar system. In addition, as will be discussed\nin later chapters, radar observations have determined the rotation periods of Venus and Mercury, probed tiny\nEarth-approaching asteroids, and allowed us to investigate the mountains and valleys on the surfaces of\nMercury, Venus, Mars, and the large moons of Jupiter.\nAny radio dish can be used as a radar telescope if it is equipped with a powerful transmitter as well as a 202 6 \u2022 Astronomical Instruments\nreceiver. For many years, the most spectacular facility in the world for radar astronomy was the 1000-foot\n(305-meter) telescope at Arecibo in Puerto Rico (Figure 6.22). The Arecibo telescope was too large to be\npointed directly at different parts of the sky. Instead, it was constructed in a huge natural \u201cbowl\u201d (more than a\nmere dish) formed by several hills, and it was lined with reflecting metal panels. A limited ability to track\nastronomical sources was achieved by moving the receiver system, which was suspended on cables 100\nmeters above the surface of the bowl. Unfortunately, the telescope was seriously damaged in the powerful\nstorms of 2020 and had to be decommissioned. An even larger (500-meter) radar telescope has recently gone\ninto operation in China and is called theFive-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope(FAST).\nFigure6.22Largest Radio and Radar Dish.The Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico was the largest and most powerful astronomical\nradar faculty in the world and was often featured in films. In November 2020 it collapsed, damaging the 300-meter diameter \u201cdish\u201d\nand destroying the radar transmitter and receiver.

Getting above the distorting effects of the atmosphere is also an advantage at visible and\ninfrared wavelengths. The stars don\u2019t \u201ctwinkle\u201d in space, so the amount of detail you can observe is limited\nonly by the size of your instrument. On the other hand, it is expensive to place telescopes into space, and\nrepairs can present a major challenge. This is why astronomers continue to build telescopes for use on the\nground as well as for launching into space.\nAirborne and Space Infrared Telescopes\nWater vapor, the main source of atmospheric interference for making infrared observations, is concentrated in\nthe lower part of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. For this reason, a gain of even a few hundred meters in elevation can\nmake an important difference in the quality of an infrared observatory site. Given the limitations of high\nmountains, most of which attract clouds and violent storms, and the fact that the ability of humans to perform\ncomplex tasks degrades at high altitudes, it was natural for astronomers to investigate the possibility of\nobserving infrared waves from airplanes and ultimately from space.\nInfrared observations from airplanes have been made since the 1960s, starting with a 15-centimeter telescope\non board a Learjet. From 1974 through 1995, NASA operated a 0.9-meter airborne telescope flying regularly\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.5 \u2022 Observations outside Earth\u2019s Atmosphere 203\nout of the Ames Research Center south of San Francisco. Observing from an altitude of 12 kilometers, the\ntelescope was above 99% of the atmospheric water vapor. More recently, NASA (in partnership with the\nGerman Aerospace Center) has constructed a much larger 2.5-meter telescope, called the Stratospheric\nObservatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), which flies in a modified Boeing 747SP (Figure 6.23).\nFigure6.23Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA).SOFIA allows observations to be made above most of\nEarth\u2019s atmospheric water vapor. (credit: NASA)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTo find out more about SOFIA, watch thisvideo(https://openstax.org/l/30SOFIAvid)provided by NASA\u2019s\nArmstrong Flight Research Center.\nGetting even higher and making observations from space itself have important advantages for infrared\nastronomy. First is the elimination of all interference from the atmosphere. Equally important is the\nopportunity to cool the entire optical system of the instrument in order to nearly eliminate infrared radiation\nfrom the telescope itself. If we tried to cool a telescope within the atmosphere, it would quickly become coated\nwith condensing water vapor and other gases, making it useless. Only in the vacuum of space can optical\nelements be cooled to hundreds of degrees below freezing and still remain operational.\nThe first orbiting infrared observatory, launched in 1983, was the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), built as\na joint project by the United States, the Netherlands, and Britain. IRAS was equipped with a 0.6-meter\ntelescope cooled to a temperature of less than 10 K. For the first time, the infrared sky could be seen as if it\nwere night, rather than through a bright foreground of atmospheric and telescope emissions. IRAS carried out\na rapid but comprehensive survey of the entire infrared sky over a 10-month period, cataloging about 350,000\nsources of infrared radiation. Since then, several other infrared telescopes have operated in space with much\nbetter sensitivity and resolution due to improvements in infrared detectors. The most powerful of these\ninfrared telescopes is the 0.85-meter Spitzer Space Telescope, which launched in 2003. A few of its\nobservations are shown inFigure 6.24. With infrared observations, astronomers can detect cooler parts of\ncosmic objects, such as the dust clouds around star nurseries and the remnants of dying stars, that visible-\nlight images don\u2019t reveal. 204 6 \u2022 Astronomical Instruments\nFigure6.24Observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST).These infrared images\u2014a region of star formation, the remnant\nof an exploded star, and a region where an old star is losing its outer shell\u2014show just a few of the observations made and\ntransmitted back to Earth from the SST. Since our eyes are not sensitive to infrared rays, we don\u2019t perceive colors from them. The\ncolors in these images have been selected by astronomers to highlight details like the composition or temperature in these regions.\n(credit \u201cFlame nebula\u201d: modification of work by NASA (X-ray: NASA/CXC/PSU/K.Getman, E.Feigelson, M.Kuhn & the MYStIX team;\nInfrared:NASA/JPL-Caltech); credit \u201cCassiopeia A\u201d: modification of work by NASA/JPL-Caltech; credit \u201cHelix nebula\u201d: modification of\nwork by NASA/JPL-Caltech)\nHubble Space Telescope\nIn April 1990, a great leap forward in astronomy was made with the launch of theHubble Space Telescope\n(HST). With an aperture of 2.4 meters, this is the largest telescope put into space so far. (Its aperture was\nlimited by the size of the payload bay in the Space Shuttle that served as its launch vehicle.) It was named for\nEdwin Hubble, the astronomer who discovered the expansion of the universe in the 1920s (whose work we will\ndiscuss in the chapters onGalaxies).\nHST is operated jointly by NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center and the Space Telescope Science Institute in\nBaltimore. It was the first orbiting observatory designed to be serviced by Shuttle astronauts and, over the\nyears since it was launched, they made several visits to improve or replace its initial instruments and to repair\nsome of the systems that operate the spacecraft (Figure 6.1)\u2014though this repair program has now been\ndiscontinued, and no more visits or improvements will be made.\nWith the Hubble, astronomers have obtained some of the most detailed images of astronomical objects from\nthe solar system outward to the most distant galaxies. Among its many great achievements is the Hubble\nUltra-Deep Field, an image of a small region of the sky observed for almost 100 hours. It contains views of\nabout 10,000 galaxies, some of which formed when the universe was just a few percent of its current age\n(Figure 6.25).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.5 \u2022 Observations outside Earth\u2019s Atmosphere 205\nFigure6.25Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF).The Hubble Space Telescope has provided an image of a specific region of space built\nfrom data collected between September 24, 2003, and January 16, 2004. These data allow us to search for galaxies that existed\napproximately 13 billion years ago. (credit: modification of work by NASA)\nThe HST\u2019s mirror was ground and polished to a remarkable degree of accuracy. If we were to scale up its\n2.4-meter mirror to the size of the entire continental United States, there would be no hill or valley larger than\nabout 6 centimeters in its smooth surface. Unfortunately, after it was launched, scientists discovered that the\nprimary mirror had a slight error in itsshape,equal to roughly 1/50 the width of a human hair. Small as that\nsounds, it was enough to ensure that much of the light entering the telescope did not come to a clear focus\nand that all the images were blurry. (In a misplaced effort to save money, a complete test of the optical system\nhad not been carried out before launch, so the error was not discovered until HST was in orbit.)\nThe solution was to do something very similar to what we do for astronomy students with blurry vision: put\ncorrective optics in front of their eyes. In December 1993, in one of the most exciting and difficult space\nmissions ever flown, astronauts captured the orbiting telescope and brought it back into the shuttle payload\nbay. There they installed a package containing compensating optics as well as a new, improved camera before\nreleasing HST back into orbit. The telescope now works as it was intended to, and further missions to it were\nable to install even more advanced instruments to take advantage of its capabilities.\nHigh-Energy Observatories\nUltraviolet, X-ray, and direct gamma-ray (high-energy electromagnetic wave) observations can be made only\nfrom space. Such observations first became possible in 1946, with V2 rockets captured from Germany after\nWorld War II. The US Naval Research Laboratory put instruments on these rockets for a series of pioneering\nflights, used initially to detect ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. Since then, many other rockets have been\nlaunched to make X-ray and ultraviolet observations of the Sun, and later of other celestial objects.\nBeginning in the 1960s, a steady stream of high-energy observatories has been launched into orbit to reveal\nand explore the universe at short wavelengths. Among recent X-ray telescopes is the Chandra X-ray\nObservatory, which was launched in 1999 (Figure 6.26). It is producing X-ray images with unprecedented\nresolution and sensitivity. Designing instruments that can collect and focus energetic radiation like X-rays and\ngamma rays is an enormous technological challenge. The 2002 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to Riccardo\nGiacconi, a pioneer in the field of building and launching sophisticated X-ray instruments. In 2008, NASA 206 6 \u2022 Astronomical Instruments\nlaunched the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, designed to measure cosmic gamma rays at energies\ngreater than any previous telescope, and thus able to collect radiation from some of the most energetic events\nin the universe.\nFigure6.26Chandra X-Ray Satellite.Chandra, the world\u2019s most powerful X-ray telescope, was developed by NASA and launched in\nJuly 1999. (credit: modification of work by NASA)\nOne major challenge is to design \u201cmirrors\u201d to reflect such penetrating radiation as X-rays and gamma rays,\nwhich normally pass straight through matter. However, although the technical details of design are more\ncomplicated, the three basic components of an observing system, as we explained earlier in this chapter, are\nthe same at all wavelengths: a telescope to gather up the radiation, filters or instruments to sort the radiation\naccording to wavelength, and some method of detecting and making a permanent record of the observations.\nTable 6.4lists some of the most important active space observatories that humanity has launched.\nGamma-ray detections can also be made from Earth\u2019s surface by using the atmosphere as the primary\ndetector. When a gamma ray hits our atmosphere, it accelerates charged particles (mostly electrons) in the\natmosphere. Those energetic particles hit other particles in the atmosphere and give off their own radiation.\nThe effect is a cascade of light and energy that can be detected on the ground. The VERITAS array in Arizona\nand the H.E.S.S. array in Namibia are two such ground-based gamma-ray observatories.\nRecent Observatories in Space\nObservatory Date Bands of Notes Website\nOperation the\nBegan Spectrum\n2.4-m mirror;\nHubble Space Telescope visible,\n1990 images and www.hubblesite.org\n(HST) UV, IR\nspectra\nX-ray images and\nChandra X-Ray Observatory 1999 X-rays www.chandra.si.edu\nspectra\nTable6.4\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.6 \u2022 The Future of Large Telescopes 207\nObservatory Date Bands of Notes Website\nOperation the\nBegan Spectrum\nX-ray http://www.cosmos.esa.int/\nXMM-Newton 1999 X-rays\nspectroscopy web/xmm-newton\nInternational Gamma-Ray X- and higher resolution\nAstrophysics Laboratory 2002 gamma- gamma-ray http://sci.esa.int/integral/\n(INTEGRAL) rays images\nSpitzer Space Telescope 2003 IR 0.85-m telescope www.spitzer.caltech.edu\nfirst high-energy\nFermi Gamma-ray Space gamma-\n2008 gamma-ray fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov\nTelescope rays\nobservations\nvisible-\nKepler 2009 planet finder http://kepler.nasa.gov\nlight\nWide-field Infrared Survey whole-sky map, www.nasa.gov/\n2009 IR\nExplorer(WISE) asteroid searches mission_pages/WISE/main\nvisible- Precise map of\nGaia 2013 http://sci.esa.int/gaia/\nlight the Milky Way\nTransiting Exoplanet Survey visible-\n2018 Planet finder http://tess.mit.edu\nSatellite (TESS) light\nTable6.4\n6.6 The Future of Large Telescopes\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the next generation of ground- and space-based observatories\nExplain some of the challenges involved in building these observatories\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone on a hike, you have probably been eager to see what lies just around the next bend in the\npath. Researchers are no different, and astronomers and engineers are working on the technologies that will\nallow us to explore even more distant parts of the universe and to see them more clearly.\nThe premier space facility planned for the next decade is theJames Webb Space Telescope(Figure 6.27), which\nwas launched on December 25, 2021. James Webb was one of the early administrators in NASA. As we write\nthis (in December 2021), the telescope is on its way to a stable orbit point, some 1.5 million kilometers from\nEarth (where no astronauts can currently travel if the facility needs repair). During its 29-day journey, a\nnumber of activities must be successfully executed in order to prepare the JWST to make observations. A solar\narray will be deployed to provide energy, and a sunshield will be stretched out to protect the telescope from\nthe intense heat of the Sun. The secondary and primary mirrors will then be unfolded. The primary mirror is 6\nmeters in diameter, made up, like the Keck telescopes, of 36 small hexagons. JWST has been designed to 208 6 \u2022 Astronomical Instruments\noperate at infrared wavelengths and will have the sensitivity needed to detect the very first generation of\nstars, formed when the universe was only a few hundred million years old.\nFigure6.27James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).This image shows some of the mirrors of the JWST as they underwent cryogenic\ntesting. The mirrors were exposed to extreme temperatures in order to gather accurate measurements on changes in their shape as\nthey heated and cooled.

Visit\nNASA's James Webb Space Telescope site(https://openstax.org/l/30JWSTtrack)to keep track of how the\nJWST is doing.\n1\nOn the ground, astronomers have started building the Vera Rubin Observatory , which has an 8.4-meter\ntelescope with a significantly larger field of view than any existing telescopes. It will rapidly scan the sky to find\ntransients, phenomena that change quickly, such as exploding stars and chunks of rock that orbit near Earth.\nIt is expected to see first light in 2022.\nThe international gamma-ray community is planning theCherenkov Telescope Array(CTA), two arrays of\ntelescopes, one in each hemisphere, which will indirectly measure gamma rays from the ground. The CTA will\nmeasure gamma-ray energies a thousand times as great as the Fermi telescope can detect.\nSeveral groups of astronomers around the globe interested in studying visible light and the infrared are\nexploring the feasibility of building ground-based telescopes with mirrors larger than 30 meters across. Stop\nand think what this means: 30 meters is one-third the length of a football field. It is technically impossible to\nbuild and transport a single astronomical mirror that is 30 meters or larger in diameter. The primary mirror of\nthese giant telescopes will consist of smaller mirrors, all aligned so that they act as a very large mirror in\ncombination.\nThe most ambitious of these projects is theEuropean Extremely Large Telescope(ELT) (Figure 6.28).\n(Astronomers try to outdo each other not only with the size of these telescopes, but also their names!) The\ndesign of the European ELT calls for a 39.3-meter primary mirror, which will follow the Keck design and be\nmade up of 798 hexagonal mirrors, each 1.4 meters in diameter and all held precisely in position so that they\nform a continuous surface. Construction on the site in the Atacama Desert in Northern Chile started in 2014,\nand operations are expected to begin in about 2025.\nInternational consortia with major contributions from U.S. astronomers have developed plans for the\n1 The observatory is named after the American astronomer whose work led us to the understanding that much of the universe is\nmade of a mysterious substance that scientists call dark matter (which we explain inThe Mass of the Galaxy).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6.6 \u2022 The Future of Large Telescopes 209\nconstruction of two large new telescopes. One is a Thirty-Meter Telescope (TMT) for which the preferred site is\nMaunakea in Hawaii. The design of this telescope is similar to that of the European ELT and will make use of\n492 hexagonal elements. Each segment is about 1.44 meters (56.6 inches) across corners. The segments are\nclosely spaced, with gaps between the segments only 2.5 mm (0.1 inch) wide.\nThe Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) is the second ELT project with major participation by U.S. astronomers.\nThe GMT is also a segmented mirror telescope that employs seven stiff monolith 8.4-meter mirrors as\nsegments. Construction has started at the selected site, which is near the Las Campanas Observatory on the\nsouthern edge of the Atacama Desert.\nThese giant telescopes will combine light-gathering power with high-resolution imaging. These powerful new\ninstruments will enable astronomers to tackle many important astronomical problems. As just one example,\nthey provide us images and spectra of planets around other stars and thus, perhaps, give us the first real\nevidence (from the chemistry of these planets\u2019 atmospheres) that life exists elsewhere.\nFigure6.28Artist\u2019s Conception of the European Extremely Large Telescope.The primary mirror in this telescope is 39.3 meters\nacross.

Light is then directed to a detector, where a permanent record is made.\nThe light-gathering power of a telescope is determined by the diameter of its aperture, or opening\u2014that is, by\nthe area of its largest or primary lens or mirror. The primary optical element in a telescope is either a convex\nlens (in a refracting telescope) or a concave mirror (in a reflector) that brings the light to a focus. Most large\ntelescopes are reflectors; it is easier to manufacture and support large mirrors because the light does not have\nto pass through glass.\n6.2Telescopes Today\nNew technologies for creating and supporting lightweight mirrors have led to the construction of a number of\nlarge telescopes since 1990. The site for an astronomical observatory must be carefully chosen for clear\nweather, dark skies, low water vapor, and excellent atmospheric seeing (low atmospheric turbulence). The\nresolution of a visible-light or infrared telescope is degraded by turbulence in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The\ntechnique of adaptive optics, however, can make corrections for this turbulence in real time and produce\nexquisitely detailed images.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6 \u2022 For Further Exploration 211\n6.3Visible-Light Detectors and Instruments\nVisible-light detectors include the human eye, photographic film, and charge-coupled devices (CCDs).\nDetectors that are sensitive to infrared radiation must be cooled to very low temperatures since everything in\nand near the telescope gives off infrared waves. A spectrometer disperses the light into a spectrum to be\nrecorded for detailed analysis.\n6.4Radio Telescopes\nIn the 1930s, radio astronomy was pioneered by Karl G. Jansky and Grote Reber. A radio telescope is basically a\nradio antenna (often a large, curved dish) connected to a receiver. Significantly enhanced resolution can be\nobtained with interferometers, including interferometer arrays like the 27-element VLA and the 66-element\nALMA. Expanding to very long baseline interferometers, radio astronomers can achieve resolutions as precise\nas 0.0001 arcsecond. Radar astronomy involves transmitting as well as receiving. The largest radar telescope\ncurrently in operation is a 305-meter bowl at Arecibo.\n6.5Observations outside Earth\u2019s Atmosphere\nInfrared observations are made with telescopes aboard aircraft and in space, as well as from ground-based\nfacilities on dry mountain peaks. Ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma-ray observations must be made from above\nthe atmosphere. Many orbiting observatories have been flown to observe in these bands of the spectrum in\nthe last few decades. The largest-aperture telescope in space is the Hubble Space telescope (HST), the most\nsignificant infrared telescope is Spitzer, and Chandra and Fermi are the premier X-ray and gamma-ray\nobservatories, respectively.\n6.6The Future of Large Telescopes\nNew and even larger telescopes are on the drawing boards. The James Webb Space Telescope, a 6-meter\nsuccessor to Hubble, is currently scheduled for launch in 2021. Gamma-ray astronomers are planning to build\nthe CTA to measure very energetic gamma rays. Astronomers are building the LSST to observe with an\nunprecedented field of view and a new generation of visible-light/infrared telescopes with apertures of 24.5 to\n39 meters in diameter.\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nBlades, J.

Most large telescopes get many more proposals for observing projects than there is night observing time\navailable in a year. Suppose your group is the telescope time allocation committee reporting to an\nobservatory director. What criteria would you use in deciding how to give out time on the telescope? What\nsteps could you take to make sure all your colleagues thought the process was fair and people would still\ntalk to you at future astronomy meetings?\nB. Your group is a committee of nervous astronomers about to make a proposal to the government\nministers of your small European country to chip in with other countries to build the world\u2019s largest\ntelescope in the high, dry desert of the Chilean Andes Mountains. You expect the government ministers to\nbe very skeptical about supporting this project. What arguments would you make to convince them to\nparticipate?\nC. The same government ministers we met in the previous activity ask you to draw up a list of the pros and\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6 \u2022 Exercises 213\ncons of having the world\u2019s largest telescope in the mountains of Chile (instead of a mountain in Europe).\nWhat would your group list in each column?\nD. Your group should discuss and make a list of all the ways in which an observing session at a large visible-\nlight telescope and a large radio telescope might differ. (Hint: Bear in mind that because the Sun is not\nespecially bright at many radio wavelengths, observations with radio telescopes can often be done during\nthe day.)\nE. Another \u201cenvironmental threat\u201d to astronomy (besides light pollution) comes from the spilling of\nterrestrial communications into the \u201cchannels\u201d\u2014wavelengths and frequencies\u2014previously reserved for\nradio astronomy. For example, the demand for cellular phones means that more and more radio channels\nwill be used for this purpose. The faint signals from cosmic radio sources could be drowned in a sea of\nearthly conversation (translated and sent as radio waves). Assume your group is a congressional\ncommittee being lobbied by both radio astronomers, who want to save some clear channels for doing\nastronomy, and the companies that stand to make a lot of money from expanding cellular phone use.\nWhat arguments would sway you to each side?\nF. When the site for the new Thirty-Meter Telescope on Hawaii\u2019s Maunakea was dedicated, a group of native\nHawaiians announced opposition to the project because astronomers were building too many telescopes\non a mountain that native Hawaiians consider a sacred site. You can read more about this controversy at\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/science/space/hawaii-court-rescinds-permit-to-build-thirty-meter-\ntelescope.html?_r=0 and at http://www.nature.com/news/the-mountain-top-battle-over-the-thirty-meter-\ntelescope-1.18446. Once your group has the facts, discuss the claims of each side in the controversy. How\ndo you think it should be resolved?\nG. If you could propose to use a large modern telescope, what would you want to find out? What telescope\nwould you use and why?\nH. Light pollution (spilled light in the night sky making it difficult to see the planets and stars) used to be an\nissue that concerned mostly astronomers. Now spilled light at night is also of concern to\nenvironmentalists and those worrying about global warming. Can your group come up with some non-\nastronomical reasons to be opposed to light pollution?\nExercises\nReview Questions\n1. What are the three basic components of a modern astronomical instrument? Describe each in one to two\nsentences.\n2. Name the two spectral windows through which electromagnetic radiation easily reaches the surface of\nEarth and describe the largest-aperture telescope currently in use for each window.\n3. List the largest-aperture single telescope currently in use in each of the following bands of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum: radio, X-ray, gamma ray.\n4. When astronomers discuss the apertures of their telescopes, they say bigger is better. Explain why.\n5. The Hooker telescope at Palomar Observatory has a diameter of 5 m, and the Keck I telescope has a\ndiameter of 10 m. How much more light can the Keck telescope collect than the Hooker telescope in the\nsame amount of time?\n6. What is meant by \u201creflecting\u201d and \u201crefracting\u201d telescopes?\n7. Why are the largest visible-light telescopes in the world made with mirrors rather than lenses? 214 6 \u2022 Exercises\n8. Compare the eye, photographic film, and CCDs as detectors for light. What are the advantages and\ndisadvantages of each?\n9. What is a charge-coupled device (CCD), and how is it used in astronomy?\n10. Why is it difficult to observe at infrared wavelengths? What do astronomers do to address this difficulty?\n11. Radio and radar observations are often made with the same antenna, but otherwise they are very\ndifferent techniques. Compare and contrast radio and radar astronomy in terms of the equipment\nneeded, the methods used, and the kind of results obtained.\n12. Look back atFigure 6.18of Cygnus A and read its caption again. The material in the giant lobes at the\nedges of the image had to have been ejected from the centerat leasthow many years ago?\n13. Why do astronomers place telescopes in Earth\u2019s orbit? What are the advantages for the different regions\nof the spectrum?\n14. What was the problem with the Hubble Space Telescope and how was it solved?\n15. Describe the techniques radio astronomers use to obtain a resolution comparable to what astronomers\nworking with visible light can achieve.\n16. What kind of visible-light and infrared telescopes on the ground are astronomers planning for the future?\nWhy are they building them on the ground and not in space?\n17. Describe one visible-light or infrared telescope that astronomers are planning to launch into space in the\nfuture.\nThought Questions\n18. What happens to the image produced by a lens if the lens is \u201cstopped down\u201d (the aperture reduced,\nthereby reducing the amount of light passing through the lens) with an iris diaphragm\u2014a device that\ncovers its periphery?\n19. What would be the properties of an ideal astronomical detector? How closely do the actual properties of a\nCCD approach this ideal?\n20. Many decades ago, the astronomers on the staff of Mount Wilson and Palomar Observatories each\nreceived about 60 nights per year for their observing programs. Today, an astronomer feels fortunate to\nget 10 nights per year on a large telescope. Can you suggest some reasons for this change?\n21. The largest observatory complex in the world is on Maunakea, the tallest mountain on Earth. What are\nsome factors astronomers consider when selecting an observatory site? Don\u2019t forget practical ones.\nShould astronomers, for example, consider building an observatory on Denali (Mount McKinley) or Mount\nEverest?\n22. Suppose you are looking for sites for a visible-light observatory, an infrared observatory, and a radio\nobservatory. What are the main criteria of excellence for each? What sites are actually considered the best\ntoday?\n23. Radio astronomy involves wavelengths much longer than those of visible light, and many orbiting\nobservatories have probed the universe for radiation of very short wavelengths. What sorts of objects and\nphysical conditions would you expect to be associated with emission of radiation at very long and very\nshort wavelengths?\n24. The dean of a university located near the ocean (who was not a science major in college) proposes\nbuilding an infrared telescope right on campus and operating it in a nice heated dome so that\nastronomers will be comfortable on cold winter nights. Criticize this proposal, giving your reasoning.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 6 \u2022 Exercises 215\nFiguring for Yourself\n25. What is the area, in square meters, of a 10-m telescope?\n26. Approximately 9000 stars are visible to the naked eye in the whole sky (imagine that you could see around\nthe entire globe and both the northern and southern hemispheres), and there are about 41,200 square\ndegrees on the sky. How many stars are visible per square degree? Per square arcsecond?\n27. Theoretically (that is, if seeing were not an issue), the resolution of a telescope is inversely proportional to\nits diameter. How much better is the resolution of the ALMA when operating at its longest baseline than\nthe resolution of the Arecibo telescope?\n28. In broad daylight, the size of your pupil is typically 3 mm. In dark situations, it expands to about 7 mm.\nHow much more light can it gather?\n29. How much more light can be gathered by a telescope that is 8 m in diameter than by your fully dark-\nadapted eye at 7 mm?\n30. How much more light can the Keck telescope (with its 10-m diameter mirror) gather than an amateur\ntelescope whose mirror is 25 cm (0.25 m) across?\n31. People are often bothered when they discover that reflecting telescopes have a second mirror in the\nmiddle to bring the light out to an accessible focus where big instruments can be mounted. \u201cDon\u2019t you\nlose light?\u201d people ask. Well, yes, you do, but there is no better alternative. You can estimate how much\nlight is lost by such an arrangement. The primary mirror (the one at the bottom inFigure 6.6) of the\nGemini North telescope is 8 m in diameter. The secondary mirror at the top is about 1 m in diameter. Use\nthe formula for the area of a circle to estimate what fraction of the light is blocked by the secondary\nmirror.\n32. Telescopes can now be operated remotely from a warm room, but until about 25 years ago, astronomers\nworked at the telescope to guide it so that it remained pointed in exactly the right place. In a large\ntelescope, like the Palomar 200-inch telescope, astronomers sat in a cage at the top of the telescope,\nwhere the secondary mirror is located, as shown inFigure 6.6. Assume for the purpose of your calculation\nthat the diameter of this cage was 40 inches. What fraction of the light is blocked?\n33. The HST cost about $1.7 billion for construction and $300 million for its shuttle launch, and it costs $250\nmillion per year to operate. If the telescope lasts for 20 years, what is the total cost per year? Per day? If\nthe telescope can be used just 30% of the time for actual observations, what is the cost per hour and per\nminute for the astronomer\u2019s observing time on this instrument? What is the cost per person in the United\nStates? Was your investment in the Hubble Space telescope worth it?\n34. How much more light can the James Webb Space Telescope (with its 6-m diameter mirror) gather than the\nHubble Space Telescope (with a diameter of 2.4 m)?\n35. The Palomar telescope\u2019s 5-m mirror weighs 14.5 tons. If a 10-m mirror were constructed of the same\nthickness as Palomar\u2019s (only bigger), how much would it weigh? 216 6 \u2022 Exercises\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7 \u2022 Thinking Ahead 217\n7\nOther Worlds: An Introduction to the Solar System\nFigure7.1\u201cSelf-Portrait\u201d of Mars.This picture was taken by theCuriosityRover onMarsin 2012.

Thanks largely to visits by spacecraft, we can\nnow envision the members of the solar system as other worlds like our own, each with its own chemical and\ngeological history, and unique sights that interplanetary tourists may someday visit. Some have called these\npast few decades the \u201cgolden age of planetary exploration,\u201d comparable to the golden age of exploration in\nthe fifteenth century, when great sailing ships plied Earth\u2019s oceans and humanity became familiar with our\nown planet\u2019s surface.\nIn this chapter, we discuss our planetary system and introduce the idea of comparative planetology\u2014studying\nhow the planets work by comparing them with one another. We want to get to know the planets not only for\nwhat we can learn about them, but also to see what they can tell us about the origin and evolution of the\nentire solar system. In the upcoming chapters, we describe the better-known members of the solar system\nand begin to compare them to the thousands of planets that have been discovered recently, orbiting other\nstars. 218 7 \u2022 Other Worlds: An Introduction to the Solar System\n7.1 Overview of Our Planetary System\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe how the objects in our solar system are identified, explored, and characterized\nDescribe the types of small bodies in our solar system, their locations, and how they formed\nModel the solar system with distances from everyday life to better comprehend distances in space\n1\nThe solar system consists of the Sun and many smaller objects: the planets, their moons and rings, and such\n\u201cdebris\u201d as asteroids, comets, and dust. Decades of observation and spacecraft exploration have revealed that\nmost of these objects formed together with the Sun about 4.5 billion years ago. They represent clumps of\nmaterial that condensed from an enormous cloud of gas and dust. The central part of this cloud became the\nSun, and a small fraction of the material in the outer parts eventually formed the other objects.\nDuring the past 50 years, we have learned more about the solar system than anyone imagined before the\nspace age. In addition to gathering information with powerful new telescopes, we have sent spacecraft directly\nto many members of the planetary system. (Planetary astronomy is the only branch of our science in which we\ncan, at least vicariously, travel to the objects we want to study.) With evocative names such asVoyager,\nPioneer,Curiosity, andPathfinder, our robot explorers have flown past, orbited, or landed on every planet,\nreturning images and data that have dazzled both astronomers and the public. In the process, we have also\ninvestigated two dwarf planets, hundreds of fascinating moons, four ring systems, a dozen asteroids, and\nseveral comets (smaller members of our solar system that we will discuss later).\nOur probes have penetrated the atmosphere of Jupiter and landed on the surfaces of Venus, Mars, ourMoon,\nSaturn\u2019s moon Titan, the asteroids Eros, Itokawa, Ryugu, and Bennu, and the Comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko\n(usually referred to as 67P). Humans have set foot on the Moon and returned samples of its surface soil for\nlaboratory analysis (Figure 7.2). We have flown a helicopter drone on Mars. We have even discovered other\nplaces in our solar system that might be able to support some kind of life.\nFigure7.2Astronauts on the Moon.The lunar lander and surface rover from the Apollo 15 mission are seen in this view of the one\nplace beyond Earth that has been explored directly by humans. (credit: modification of work by David R. Scott, NASA)\n1 The generic term for a group of planets and other bodies circling a star isplanetary system. Ours is called thesolar system\nbecause our Sun is sometimes calledSol. Strictly speaking, then, there is only one solar system; planets orbiting other stars are in\nplanetary systems.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.1 \u2022 Overview of Our Planetary System 219\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView this gallery ofNASA images(https://openstax.org/l/30projapolloarc)that trace the history of the\nApollo mission.\nAn Inventory\nThe Sun, a star that is brighter than about 80% of the stars in the Galaxy, is by far the most massive member of\nthe solar system, as shown inTable 7.1. It is an enormous ball about 1.4 million kilometers in diameter, with\nsurface layers of incandescent gas and an interior temperature of millions of degrees. The Sun will be\ndiscussed in later chapters as our first, and best-studied, example of a star.\nMass of Members of the Solar System\nObject Percentage of Total Mass of Solar System\nSun 99.80\nJupiter 0.10\nComets 0.0005\u20130.03 (estimate)\nAll other planets and dwarf planets 0.04\nMoons and rings 0.00005\nAsteroids 0.000002 (estimate)\nCosmic dust 0.0000001 (estimate)\nTable7.1\nTable 7.1also shows that most of the material of the planets is actually concentrated in the largest one,Jupiter,\nwhich is more massive than all the rest of the planets combined. Astronomers were able to determine the\nmasses of the planets centuries ago using Kepler\u2019s laws of planetary motion and Newton\u2019s law of gravity to\nmeasure the planets\u2019 gravitational effects on one another or on moons that orbit them (seeOrbits and\nGravity). Today, we make even more precise measurements of their masses by tracking their gravitational\neffects on the motion of spacecraft that pass near them.\nBeside Earth, five other planets were known to the ancients\u2014Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn\u2014and\ntwo were discovered after the invention of the telescope: Uranus and Neptune. The eight planets all revolve in\nthe same direction around the Sun. They orbit in approximately the same plane, like cars traveling on\nconcentric tracks on a giant, flat racecourse. Each planet stays in its own \u201ctraffic lane,\u201d following a nearly\ncircular orbit about the Sun and obeying the \u201ctraffic\u201d laws discovered by Galileo, Kepler, and Newton. Besides\nthese planets, we have also been discovering smaller worlds beyond Neptune that are calledtrans-Neptunian\nobjects or TNOs (seeFigure 7.3). The first to be found, in 1930, wasPluto, but others have been discovered\nduring the twenty-first century. One of them,Eris, is about the same size as Pluto and has at least one moon\n(Pluto has five known moons.) The largest TNOs are also classed asdwarf planets,as is the largest asteroid, 220 7 \u2022 Other Worlds: An Introduction to the Solar System\nCeres. (Dwarf planets will be discussed further in the chapter onRings, Moons, and Pluto). To date, more than\n2600 of these TNOs have been discovered, and one, called Arrokoth, was explored by the New Horizons\nspacecraft.\nFigure7.3Orbits of the Planets.All eight major planets orbit the Sun in roughly the same plane. The five currently known dwarf\nplanets are also shown:Eris,Haumea,Pluto,Ceres, andMakemake. Note that Pluto\u2019s orbit is not in the plane of the planets.\nEach of the planets and dwarf planets also rotates (spins) about an axis running through it, and in most cases\nthe direction of rotation is the same as the direction of revolution about the Sun. The exceptions areVenus,\nwhich rotates backward very slowly (that is, in a retrograde direction), and Uranus andPluto, which also have\nstrange rotations, each spinning about an axis tipped nearly on its side. We do not yet know the spin\norientations of Eris, Haumea, and Makemake.\nThe four planets closest to the Sun (Mercury through Mars) are called the inner orterrestrial planets. Often,\ntheMoonis also discussed as a part of this group, bringing the total of terrestrial objects to five. (We generally\ncall Earth\u2019s satellite \u201cthe Moon,\u201d with a capital M, and the other satellites \u201cmoons,\u201d with lowercase m\u2019s.) The\nterrestrial planets are relatively small worlds, composed primarily of rock and metal. All of them have solid\nsurfaces that bear the records of their geological history in the forms of craters, mountains, and volcanoes\n(Figure 7.4).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.1 \u2022 Overview of Our Planetary System 221\nFigure7.4Surface of Mercury.The pockmarked face of the terrestrial world ofMercuryis more typical of the inner planets than the\nwatery surface of Earth. This black-and-white image, taken with the Mariner 10 spacecraft, shows a region more than 400 kilometers\nwide. (credit: modification of work by NASA/John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Carnegie Institution of Washington)\nThe next four planets (Jupiter through Neptune) are much larger and are composed primarily of lighter ices,\nliquids, and gases. We call these four the jovian planets (after \u201cJove,\u201d another name for Jupiter in mythology)\norgiant planets\u2014a name they richly deserve (Figure 7.5). About 1,300 Earths could fit inside Jupiter, for\nexample. These planets do not have solid surfaces on which future explorers might land. They are more like\nvast, spherical oceans with much smaller, dense cores.\nFigure7.5The Four Giant Planets.This montage shows the four giant planets:Jupiter,Saturn,Uranus, andNeptune.

Let\u2019s use Saturn\u2019s moon Mimas as our example, with a mass of 4 \u00d7 1019\nkg and a diameter of approximately 400 km (radius, 200 km = 2 \u00d7 105m).\nSolution\nThe volume of Mimas is\nDensity is mass divided by volume:\nNote that the density of water in these units is 1000 kg/m3, so Mimas must be made mainly of ice, not rock.\n(Note that the density of Mimas given inAppendix Gis 1.2, but the units used there are different.

There are more than 210 known moons orbiting planets and dwarf planets (seeAppendix Gfor a listing\nof the larger ones), and undoubtedly many other small ones remain undiscovered. The largest of the moons\nare as big as small planets and just as interesting. In addition to our Moon, they include the four largest\nmoons of Jupiter (called the Galilean moons, after their discoverer) and the largest moons of Saturn and\nNeptune (confusingly named Titan and Triton).\nEach of the giant planets also has rings made up of countless small bodies ranging in size from mountains to 224 7 \u2022 Other Worlds: An Introduction to the Solar System\nmere grains of dust, all in orbit about the equator of the planet. The bright rings ofSaturnare, by far, the\neasiest to see. They are among the most beautiful sights in the solar system (Figure 7.7). But, all four ring\nsystems are interesting to scientists because of their complicated forms, influenced by the pull of the moons\nthat also orbit these giant planets.\nFigure7.7Saturn and Its Rings.This 2007 Cassini image showsSaturnand its complex system of rings, taken from a distance of\nabout 1.2 million kilometers. This natural-color image is a composite of 36 images taken over the course of 2.5 hours. (credit:\nmodification of work by NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute)\nThe solar system has many other less-conspicuous members. Another group is theasteroids, rocky bodies\nthat orbit the Sun like miniature planets, mostly in the space between Mars and Jupiter (although some do\ncross the orbits of planets like Earth\u2014seeFigure 7.8). Most asteroids are remnants of the initial population of\nthe solar system that existed before the planets themselves formed. Some of the smallest moons of the\nplanets, such as the moons of Mars, are very likely captured asteroids.\nFigure7.8Asteroid Eros.This small Earth-crossing asteroid image was taken by the NEAR-Shoemaker spacecraft from an altitude of\nabout 100 kilometers. This view of the heavily cratered surface is about 10 kilometers wide. The spacecraft orbited Eros for a year\nbefore landing gently on its surface. (credit: modification of work by NASA/JHUAPL)\nAnother class of small bodies is composed mostly of ice, made of frozen gases such as water, carbon dioxide,\nand carbon monoxide; these objects are calledcomets(seeFigure 7.9). Comets also are remnants from the\nformation of the solar system, but they were formed and continue (with rare exceptions) to orbit the Sun in\ndistant, cooler regions\u2014stored in a sort of cosmic deep freeze. This is also the realm of the larger icy worlds,\ncalled dwarf planets.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.1 \u2022 Overview of Our Planetary System 225\nFigure7.9Comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P).This image shows Comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko, also known as 67P, near its\nclosest approach to the Sun in 2015, as seen from theRosettaspacecraft.

When these particles enter Earth\u2019s atmosphere (as millions do each day) they burn up, producing a\nbrief flash of light in the night sky known as ameteor(meteors are often referred to as shooting stars).\nOccasionally, some larger chunk of rocky or metallic material survives its passage through the atmosphere\nand lands on Earth. Any piece that strikes the ground is known as ameteorite. (You can see meteorites on\ndisplay in many natural history museums and can sometimes even purchase pieces of them from gem and\nmineral dealers.)\nVOYAGERS IN ASTRONOMY\nCarl Sagan: Solar System Advocate\nThe best-known astronomer in the world during the 1970s and 1980s, CarlSagandevoted most of his\nprofessional career to studying the planets and considerable energy to raising public awareness of what we\ncan learn from exploring the solar system (seeFigure 7.10). Born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1934, Sagan\nbecame interested in astronomy as a youngster; he also credits science fiction stories for sustaining his\nfascination with what\u2019s out in the universe. 226 7 \u2022 Other Worlds: An Introduction to the Solar System\nFigure7.10Carl Sagan (1934\u20131996) and Neil deGrasse Tyson.Sagan was Tyson\u2019s inspiration to become a scientist. (credit\n\u201cSagan\u201d: modification of work by NASA, JPL; credit \u201cTyson\u201d: modification of work by Bruce F. Press)\nIn the early 1960s, when many scientists still thought Venus might turn out to be a hospitable place, Sagan\ncalculated that the thick atmosphere of Venus could act like a giant greenhouse, keeping the heat in and\nraising the temperature enormously. He showed that the seasonal changes astronomers had seen on Mars\nwere caused, not by vegetation, but by wind-blown dust. He was a member of the scientific teams for many\nof the robotic missions that explored the solar system and was instrumental in getting NASA to put a\nmessage-bearing plaque aboard the Pioneer spacecraft, as well as audio-video records on the Voyager\nspacecraft\u2014all of them destined to leave our solar system entirely and send these little bits of Earth\ntechnology out among the stars.\nTo encourage public interest and public support of planetary exploration, Sagan helped found The\nPlanetary Society, now the largest space-interest organization in the world. He was a tireless and eloquent\nadvocate of the need to study the solar system close-up and the value of learning about other worlds in\norder to take better care of our own.\nSagan simulated conditions on early Earth to demonstrate how some of life\u2019s fundamental building blocks\nmight have formed from the \u201cprimordial soup\u201d of natural compounds on our planet. In addition, he and his\ncolleagues developed computer models showing the consequences of nuclear war for Earth would be even\nmore devastating than anyone had thought (this is now called the nuclear winter hypothesis) and\ndemonstrating some of the serious consequences of continued pollution of our atmosphere.\nSagan was perhaps best known, however, as a brilliant popularizer of astronomy and the author of many\nbooks on science, including the best-sellingCosmos, and several evocative tributes to solar system\nexploration such asThe Cosmic ConnectionandPale Blue Dot. His bookThe Demon Haunted World,\ncompleted just before his death in 1996, is perhaps the best antidote to fuzzy thinking about pseudo-\nscience and irrationality in print today. An intriguing science fiction novel he wrote, titledContact, which\nbecame a successful film as well, is still recommended by many science instructors as a scenario for making\ncontact with life elsewhere that is much more reasonable than most science fiction.\nSagan was a master, too, of the television medium. His 13-part public television series,Cosmos, was seen by\nan estimated 500 million people in 60 countries and has become one of the most-watched series in the\nhistory of public broadcasting. A few astronomers scoffed at a scientist who spent so much time in the\npublic eye, but it is probably fair to say that Sagan\u2019s enthusiasm and skill as an explainer won more friends\nfor the science of astronomy than anyone or anything else in the second half of the twentieth century.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.1 \u2022 Overview of Our Planetary System 227\nIn the two decades since Sagan\u2019s death, no other scientist has achieved the same level of public\nrecognition. Perhaps closest is the director of the Hayden Planetarium, Neil deGrasseTyson, who followed\nin Sagan\u2019s footsteps by making an updated version of theCosmosprogram in 2014. Tyson is quick to point\nout that Sagan was his inspiration to become a scientist, telling how Sagan invited him to visit for a day at\nCornell when he was a high school student looking for a career. However, the media environment has\nfragmented a great deal since Sagan\u2019s time. It is interesting to speculate whether Sagan could have\nadapted his communication style to the world of cable television, Twitter, Facebook, and podcasts.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTwo imaginative videos provide a tour of the solar system objects we have been discussing. Shane Gellert\u2019s\nI Need Some Space(https://openstax.org/l/30needsomespace)uses NASA photography and models to\nshow the various worlds with which we share our system. In the more science fiction-orientedWanderers\n(https://openstax.org/l/30wanderers)video, we see some of the planets and moons as tourist destinations\nfor future explorers, with commentary taken from recordings by Carl Sagan.\nA Scale Model of the Solar System\nAstronomy often deals with dimensions and distances that far exceed our ordinary experience. What does 1.4\nbillion kilometers\u2014the distance from the Sun to Saturn\u2014really mean to anyone? It can be helpful to visualize\nsuch large systems in terms of a scale model.\nIn our imaginations, let us build a scale model of the solar system, adopting a scale factor of 1 billion\n(109)\u2014that is, reducing the actual solar system by dividing every dimension by a factor of 109. Earth, then, has\na diameter of 1.3 centimeters, about the size of a grape. The Moon is a pea orbiting this at a distance of 40\ncentimeters, or a little more than a foot away. The Earth-Moon system fits into a standard backpack.\nIn this model, the Sun is nearly 1.5 meters in diameter, about the average height of an adult, and our Earth is\nat a distance of 150 meters\u2014about one city block\u2014from the Sun. Jupiter is five blocks away from the Sun, and\nits diameter is 15 centimeters, about the size of a very large grapefruit. Saturn is 10 blocks from the Sun;\nUranus, 20 blocks; and Neptune, 30 blocks. Pluto, with a distance that varies quite a bit during its 249-year\norbit, is currently just beyond 30 blocks and getting farther with time. Most of the moons of the outer solar\nsystem are the sizes of various kinds of seeds orbiting the grapefruit, oranges, and lemons that represent the\nouter planets.\nIn our scale model, a human is reduced to the dimensions of a single atom, and cars and spacecraft to the size\nof molecules. Sending the Voyager spacecraft to Neptune involves navigating a single molecule from the\nEarth\u2013grape toward a lemon 5 kilometers away with an accuracy equivalent to the width of a thread in a\nspider\u2019s web.\nIf that model represents the solar system, where would the nearest stars be? If we keep the same scale, the\nclosest stars would be tens of thousands of kilometers away. If you built this scale model in the city where you\nlive, you would have to place the representations of these stars on the other side of Earth or beyond.\nBy the way, model solar systems like the one we just presented have been built in cities throughout the world.\nIn Sweden, for example, Stockholm\u2019s huge Globe Arena has become a model for the Sun, and Pluto is\nrepresented by a 12-centimeter sculpture in the small town of Delsbo, 300 kilometers away. Another model\nsolar system is in Washington on the Mall between the White House and Congress (perhaps proving they are\nworlds apart?). 228 7 \u2022 Other Worlds: An Introduction to the Solar System\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThismodel of the solar system(https://openstax.org/l/30modsolsys)shows all orbits and sizes to scale, and\nit lets you fly between the planets at an enhanced speed.\nMAKING CONNECTIONS\nNames in the Solar System\nWe humans just don\u2019t feel comfortable until something has a name. Types of butterflies, new elements, and\nthe mountains of Venus all need names for us to feel we are acquainted with them. How do we give names\nto objects and features in the solar system?\nPlanets and moons are named after gods and heroes in Greek and Roman mythology (with a few\nexceptions among the moons of Uranus, which have names drawn from English literature). When William\nHerschel, a German immigrant to England, first discovered the planet we now call Uranus, he wanted to\nname it Georgium Sidus (George\u2019s star) after King George III of his adopted country. This caused such an\noutcry among astronomers in other nations, however, that the classic tradition was upheld\u2014and has been\nmaintained ever since. Luckily, there were a lot of minor gods in the ancient pantheon, so plenty of names\nare left for the many small moons we are discovering around the giant planets. (Appendix Glists the larger\nmoons). More recently, the names of dwarf planets and their moons have been drawn from the mythology\nof other cultures besides Greek and Roman.\nComets are often named after their discoverers (offering an extra incentive to comet hunters). Asteroids\nare named by their discoverers after just about anyone or anything they want. Recently, asteroid names\nhave been used to recognize people who have made significant contributions to astronomy, including the\nthree senior authors of this book.\nThat was pretty much all the naming that was needed while our study of the solar system was confined to\nEarth. But now, our spacecraft have surveyed and photographed many worlds in great detail, and each\nworld has a host of features that also need names. To make sure that naming things in space remains\nmultinational, rational, and somewhat dignified, astronomers have given the responsibility of approving\nnames to a special committee of theInternational Astronomical Union(IAU), the body that includes\nscientists from every country that does astronomy.\nThis IAU committee has developed a set of rules for naming features on other worlds. For example, craters\non Venus are named for women who have made significant contributions to human knowledge and\nwelfare. Volcanic features on Jupiter\u2019s moon Io, which is in a constant state of volcanic activity, are named\nafter gods of fire and thunder from the mythologies of many cultures. Craters on Mercury commemorate\nfamous novelists, playwrights, artists, and composers. On Saturn\u2019s moon Tethys, all the features are named\nafter characters and places in Homer\u2019s great epic poem,The Odyssey. As we explore further, it may well\nturn out that more places in the solar system need names than Earth history can provide. Perhaps by then,\nexplorers and settlers on these worlds will be ready to develop their own names for the places they may (if\nbut for a while) call home.\nYou may be surprised to know that the meaning of the wordplanethas recently become controversial\nbecause we have discovered many other planetary systems that don\u2019t look very much like our own. Even\nwithin our solar system, the planets differ greatly in size and chemical properties. The biggest dispute\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.2 \u2022 Composition and Structure of Planets 229\nconcerns Pluto, which is much smaller than the other eight major planets. The category of dwarf planet was\ninvented to include Pluto and similar icy objects beyond Neptune. But is a dwarf planet also a planet?\nLogically, it should be, but even this simple issue of grammar has been the subject of heated debate among\nboth astronomers and the general public.\n7.2 Composition and Structure of Planets\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the characteristics of the giant planets, terrestrial planets, and small bodies in the solar system\nExplain what influences the temperature of a planet\u2019s surface\nExplain why there is geological activity on some planets and not on others\nThe fact that there are two distinct kinds of planets\u2014the rocky terrestrial planets and the gas-rich jovian\nplanets\u2014leads us to believe that they formed under different conditions. Certainly their compositions are\ndominated by different elements. Let us look at each type in more detail.\nThe Giant Planets\nThe two largest planets,JupiterandSaturn, have nearly the same chemical makeup as the Sun; they are\ncomposed primarily of the two elements hydrogen and helium, with 75% of their mass being hydrogen and\n25% helium. On Earth, both hydrogen and helium are gases, so Jupiter and Saturn are sometimes called gas\nplanets. But, this name is misleading. Jupiter and Saturn are so large that the gas is compressed in their\ninterior until the hydrogen becomes a liquid. Because the bulk of both planets consists of compressed,\nliquefied hydrogen, we should really call them liquid planets.\nUnder the force of gravity, the heavier elements sink toward the inner parts of a liquid or gaseous planet. Both\nJupiter and Saturn, therefore, have cores composed of heavier rock, metal, and ice, but we cannot see these\nregions directly. In fact, when we look down from above, all we see is the atmosphere with its swirling clouds\n(Figure 7.11). We must infer the existence of the denser core inside these planets from studies of each planet\u2019s\ngravity.\nFigure7.11Jupiter.This true-color image ofJupiterwas taken from the Cassini spacecraft in 2000. The dark spot is the shadow of\none of the giant planet\u2019s moons. (credit: modification of work by NASA/JPL/University of Arizona)\nUranusandNeptuneare much smaller than Jupiter and Saturn, but each also has a core of rock, metal, and\nice. Uranus and Neptune were less efficient at attracting hydrogen and helium gas, so they have much smaller 230 7 \u2022 Other Worlds: An Introduction to the Solar System\natmospheres in proportion to their cores.\nChemically, each giant planet is dominated by hydrogen and its many compounds. Nearly all the oxygen\npresent is combined chemically with hydrogen to form water (H O). Chemists call such a hydrogen-dominated\n2\ncompositionreduced. Throughout the outer solar system, we find abundant water (mostly in the form of ice)\nand reducing chemistry.\nThe Terrestrial Planets\nThe terrestrial planets are quite different from the giants. In addition to being much smaller, they are\ncomposed primarily of rocks and metals. These, in turn, are made of elements that are less common in the\nuniverse as a whole. The most abundant rocks, called silicates, are made of silicon and oxygen, and the most\ncommon metal is iron. We can tell from their densities (seeTable 7.2) thatMercuryhas the greatest proportion\nof metals (which are denser) and the Moon has the lowest.Earth,Venus, andMarsall have roughly similar\nbulk compositions: about one third of their mass consists of iron-nickel or iron-sulfur combinations; two thirds\nis made of silicates. Because these planets are largely composed of oxygen compounds (such as the silicate\nminerals of their crusts), their chemistry is said to beoxidized.\nWhen we look at the internal structure of each of the terrestrial planets, we find that the densest metals are in\na central core, with the lighter silicates near the surface. If these planets were liquid, like the giant planets, we\ncould understand this effect as the result the sinking of heavier elements due to the pull of gravity. This leads\nus to conclude that, although the terrestrial planets are solid today, at one time they must have been hot\nenough to melt.\nDifferentiationis the process by which gravity helps separate a planet\u2019s interior into layers of different\ncompositions and densities. The heavier metals sink to form a core, while the lightest minerals float to the\nsurface to form a crust. Later, when the planet cools, this layered structure is preserved. In order for a rocky\nplanet to differentiate, it must be heated to the melting point of rocks, which is typically more than 1300 K.\nMoons, Asteroids, and Comets\nChemically and structurally, Earth\u2019sMoonis like the terrestrial planets, but most moons are in the outer solar\nsystem, and they have compositions similar to the cores of the giant planets around which they orbit. The\nthree largest moons\u2014Ganymede and Callisto in the jovian system, andTitanin the saturnian system\u2014are\ncomposed half of frozen water, and half of rocks and metals. Most of these moons differentiated during\nformation, and today they have cores of rock and metal, with upper layers and crusts of very cold and\u2014thus\nvery hard\u2014ice (Figure 7.12).\nFigure7.12Ganymede.This view of Jupiter\u2019s moonGanymedewas taken in June 1996 by the Galileo spacecraft. The brownish gray\ncolor of the surface indicates a dusty mixture of rocky material and ice. The bright spots are places where recent impacts have\nuncovered fresh ice from underneath. (credit: modification of work by NASA/JPL)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.2 \u2022 Composition and Structure of Planets 231\nMost of the asteroids and comets, as well as the smallest moons, were probably never heated to the melting\npoint. However, some of the largest asteroids, such asVesta, appear to be differentiated; others are fragments\nfrom differentiated bodies. Many of the smaller objects seem to be fragments or rubble piles that are the\nresult of collisions. Because most asteroids and comets retain their original composition, they represent\nrelatively unmodified material dating back to the time of the formation of the solar system. In a sense, they act\nas chemical fossils, helping us to learn about a time long ago whose traces have been erased on larger worlds.\nTemperatures: Going to Extremes\nGenerally speaking, the farther a planet or moon is from the Sun, the cooler its surface. The planets are heated\nby the radiant energy of the Sun, which gets weaker with the square of the distance. You know how rapidly the\nheating effect of a fireplace or an outdoor radiant heater diminishes as you walk away from it; the same effect\napplies to the Sun.Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, has a blistering surface temperature that ranges\nfrom 280\u2013430 \u00b0C on its sunlit side, whereas the surface temperature onPlutois only about \u2013220 \u00b0C, colder than\nliquid air.\nMathematically, the temperatures decrease approximately in proportion to the square root of the distance\nfrom the Sun. Pluto is about 30 AU at its closest to the Sun (or 100 times the distance of Mercury) and about 49\nAU at its farthest from the Sun. Thus, Pluto\u2019s temperature is less than that of Mercury by the square root of\n100, or a factor of 10: from 500 K to 50 K.\nIn addition to its distance from the Sun, the surface temperature of a planet can be influenced strongly by its\natmosphere. Without our atmospheric insulation (the greenhouse effect, which keeps the heat in), the oceans\nof Earth would be permanently frozen. Conversely, if Mars once had a larger atmosphere in the past, it could\nhave supported a more temperate climate than it has today. Venus is an even more extreme example, where\nits thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide acts as insulation, reducing the escape of heat built up at the surface,\nresulting in temperatures greater than those on Mercury. Today, Earth is the only planet where surface\ntemperatures generally lie between the freezing and boiling points of water. As far as we know, Earth is the\nonly planet to support life.\nASTRONOMY BASICS\nThere\u2019s No Place Like Home\nIn the classic filmThe Wizard of Oz, Dorothy, the heroine, concludes after her many adventures in \u201calien\u201d\nenvironments that \u201cthere\u2019s no place like home.\u201d The same can be said of the other worlds in our solar\nsystem. There are many fascinating places, large and small, that we might like to visit, but humans could\nnot survive on any without a great deal of artificial assistance.\nA thick carbon dioxide atmosphere keeps the surface temperature on our neighbor Venus at a sizzling 700\nK (near 900 \u00b0F). Mars, on the other hand, has temperatures generally below freezing, with air (also mostly\ncarbon dioxide) so thin that it resembles that found at an altitude of 30 kilometers (100,000 feet) in Earth\u2019s\natmosphere. And the red planet is so dry that it has not had any rain for billions of years.\nThe outer layers of the jovian planets are neither warm enough nor solid enough for human habitation. Any\nbases we build in the systems of the giant planets may well have to be in space or one of their\nmoons\u2014none of which is particularly hospitable to a luxury hotel with a swimming pool and palm trees.\nPerhaps we will find warmer havens deep inside the clouds of Jupiter or in the ocean under the frozen ice of\nits moon Europa.\nAll of this suggests that we had better take good care of Earth because it is the only site where life as we\nknow it could survive. Recent human activity may be reducing the habitability of our planet by adding 232 7 \u2022 Other Worlds: An Introduction to the Solar System\npollutants to the atmosphere, especially the potent greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Human civilization is\nchanging our planet dramatically, and these changes are not necessarily for the better. In a solar system\nthat seems unready to receive us, making Earth less hospitable to life may be a grave mistake.\nGeological Activity\nThe crusts of all of the terrestrial planets, as well as of the larger moons, and Pluto, have been modified over\ntheir histories by both internal and external forces. Externally, each has been battered by a slow rain of\nprojectiles from space, leaving their surfaces pockmarked by impact craters of all sizes (seeFigure 7.4). We\nhave good evidence that this bombardment was far greater in the early history of the solar system, but it\ncertainly continues to this day, even if at a lower rate. The collision of more than 20 large pieces ofComet\nShoemaker\u2013Levy 9with Jupiter in the summer of 1994 (seeFigure 7.13) is one dramatic example of this\nprocess.\nFigure7.13Comet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9.In this image of Comet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9 taken on May 17, 1994, by NASA\u2019s Hubble Space\nTelescope, you can see about 20 icy fragments into which the comet broke. The comet was approximately 660 million kilometers\nfrom Earth, heading on a collision course with Jupiter. (credit: modification of work by NASA, ESA, H. Weaver (STScl), E. Smith (STScl))\nFigure 7.14shows the aftermath of these collisions, when debris clouds larger than Earth could be seen in\nJupiter\u2019s atmosphere.\nFigure7.14Jupiter with Huge Dust Clouds.The Hubble Space Telescope took this sequence of images ofJupiterin summer 1994,\nwhen fragments ofComet Shoemaker\u2013Levy 9collided with the giant planet. Here we see the site hit by fragment G, from five\nminutes to five days after impact. Several of the dust clouds generated by the collisions became larger than Earth. (credit:\nmodification of work by H. Hammel, NASA)\nDuring the time all the planets have been subject to such impacts, internal forces on the terrestrial planets\nhave buckled and twisted their crusts, built up mountain ranges, erupted as volcanoes, and generally\nreshaped the surfaces in what we call geological activity. (The prefixgeomeans \u201cEarth,\u201d so this is a bit of an\n\u201cEarth-chauvinist\u201d term, but it is so widely used that we bow to tradition.) Among the terrestrial planets, Earth\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.3 \u2022 Dating Planetary Surfaces 233\nand Venus have experienced the most geological activity over their histories, although some of the moons in\nthe outer solar system are also surprisingly active. In contrast, our own Moon is a dead world where geological\nactivity ceased billions of years ago.\nGeological activity on a planet is the result of a hot interior. The forces of volcanism and mountain building are\ndriven by heat escaping from the interiors of planets. As we will see, each of the planets was heated at the\ntime of its birth, and this primordial heat initially powered extensive volcanic activity, even on our Moon. But,\nsmall objects such as the Moon soon cooled off. The larger the planet or moon, the longer it retains its internal\nheat, and therefore the more we expect to see surface evidence of continuing geological activity. The effect is\nsimilar to our own experience with a hot baked potato: the larger the potato, the more slowly it cools. If we\nwant a potato to cool quickly, we cut it into small pieces.\nFor the most part, the history of volcanic activity on the terrestrial planets conforms to the predictions of this\nsimple theory. The Moon, the smallest of these objects, is a geologically dead world. Although we know less\nabout Mercury, it seems likely that this planet, too, ceased most volcanic activity about the same time the\nMoon did. Mars represents an intermediate case. It has been much more active than the Moon, but less so\nthan Earth. Earth and Venus, the largest terrestrial planets, still have molten interiors even today, some 4.5\nbillion years after their birth.\n7.3 Dating Planetary Surfaces\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain how astronomers can tell whether a planetary surface is geologically young or old\nDescribe different methods for dating planets\nHow do we know the age of the surfaces we see on planets and moons? If a world has a surface (as opposed\nto being mostly gas and liquid), astronomers have developed some techniques for estimating how long ago\nthat surface solidified. Note that the age of these surfaces is not necessarily the age of the planet as a whole.\nOn geologically active objects (including Earth), vast outpourings of molten rock or the erosive effects of water\nand ice, which we call planet weathering, have erased evidence of earlier epochs and present us with only a\nrelatively young surface for investigation.\nCounting the Craters\nOne way to estimate the age of a surface is by counting the number of impactcraters. This technique works\nbecause the rate at which impacts have occurred in the solar system has been roughly constant for several\nbillion years. Thus, in the absence of forces to eliminate craters, the number of craters is simply proportional\nto the length of time the surface has been exposed. This technique has been applied successfully to many\nsolid planets and moons (Figure 7.15). 234 7 \u2022 Other Worlds: An Introduction to the Solar System\nFigure7.15Our Cratered Moon.This composite image of the Moon\u2019s surface was made from many smaller images taken between\nNovember 2009 and February 2011 by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and shows craters of many different sizes. (credit:\nmodification of work by NASA/GSFC/Arizona State University)\nBear in mind that crater counts can tell us only the time since the surface experienced a major change that\ncould modify or erase preexisting craters. Estimating ages from crater counts is a little like walking along a\nsidewalk in a snowstorm after the snow has been falling steadily for a day or more. You may notice that in\nfront of one house the snow is deep, while next door the sidewalk may be almost clear. Do you conclude that\nless snow has fallen in front of Ms. Jones\u2019 house than Mr. Smith\u2019s? More likely, you conclude that Jones has\nrecently swept the walk clean and Smith has not. Similarly, the numbers of craters indicate how long it has\nbeen since a planetary surface was last \u201cswept clean\u201d by ongoing lava flows or by molten materials ejected\nwhen a large impact happened nearby.\nStill, astronomers can use the numbers of craters on different parts of the same world to provide important\nclues about how regions on that world evolved. On a given planet or moon, the more heavily cratered terrain\nwill generally be older (that is, more time will have elapsed there since something swept the region clean).\nRadioactive Rocks\nAnother way to trace the history of a solid world is to measure the age of individual rocks. After samples were\nbrought back from theMoonby Apollo astronauts, the techniques that had been developed to date rocks on\nEarth were applied to rock samples from the Moon to establish a geological chronology for the Moon.\nFurthermore, a few samples of material from the Moon, Mars, and the large asteroidVestahave fallen to Earth\nas meteorites and can be examined directly (see the chapter onCosmic Samples and the Origin of the Solar\nSystem).\nScientists measure the age of rocks using the properties of naturalradioactivity. Around the beginning of the\ntwentieth century, physicists began to understand that some atomic nuclei are not stable but can split apart\n(decay) spontaneously into smaller nuclei. The process of radioactive decay involves the emission of particles\nsuch as electrons, or of radiation in the form of gamma rays (see the chapter onRadiation and Spectra).\nFor any one radioactive nucleus, it is not possible to predict when the decay process will happen. Such decay is\nrandom in nature, like the throw of dice: as gamblers have found all too often, it is impossible to say just when\nthe dice will come up 7 or 11. But, for a very large number of dice tosses, we can calculate the odds that 7 or 11\nwill come up. Similarly, if we have a very large number of radioactive atoms of one type (say, uranium), there is\na specific time period, called itshalf-life, during which the chances are fifty-fifty that decay will occur for any of\nthe nuclei.\nA particular nucleus may last a shorter or longer time than its half-life, but in a large sample, almost exactly\nhalf of the nuclei will have decayed after a time equal to one half-life. Half of the remaining nuclei will have\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.3 \u2022 Dating Planetary Surfaces 235\ndecayed after two half-lives pass, leaving only one half of a half\u2014or one quarter\u2014of the original sample\n(Figure 7.16).\nFigure7.16Radioactive Decay.This graph shows (in pink) the amount of a radioactive sample that remains after several half-lives\nhave passed. After one half-life, half the sample is left; after two half-lives, one half of the remainder (or one quarter) is left; and after\nthree half-lives, one half of that (or one eighth) is left. Note that, in reality, the decay of radioactive elements in a rock sample would\nnot cause any visible change in the appearance of the rock; the splashes of color are shown here for conceptual purposes only.\nIf you had 1 gram of pure radioactive nuclei with a half-life of 100 years, then after 100 years you would have\n1/2 gram; after 200 years, 1/4 gram; after 300 years, only 1/8 gram; and so forth. However, the material does\nnot disappear. Instead, the radioactive atoms are replaced with their decay products. Sometimes the\nradioactive atoms are calledparentsand the decay products are calleddaughterelements.\nIn this way, radioactive elements with half-lives we have determined can provide accurate nuclear clocks. By\ncomparing how much of a radioactive parent element is left in a rock to how much of its daughter products\nhave accumulated, we can learn how long the decay process has been going on and hence how long ago the\nrock formed.Table 7.3summarizes the decay reactions used most often to date lunar and terrestrial rocks.\n4\nRadioactive Decay Reaction Used to Date Rocks\nParent Daughter Half-Life (billions of years)\nSamarium-147 Neodymium-143 106\nRubidium-87 Strontium-87 48.8\nThorium-232 Lead-208 14.0\nUranium-238 Lead-206 4.47\nPotassium-40 Argon-40 1.31\nTable7.3\n4 The number after each element is its atomic weight, equal to the number of protons plus neutrons in its nucleus. This specifies\ntheisotopeof the element; different isotopes of the same element differ in the number of neutrons. 236 7 \u2022 Other Worlds: An Introduction to the Solar System\nLINK TO LEARNING\nPBS provides anevolution series excerpt(https://openstax.org/l/30pbsradiomat)that explains how we use\nradioactive elements to date Earth.\nThisScience Channel video(https://openstax.org/l/30billnyevideo)features Bill Nye the Science Guy\nshowing how scientists have used radioactive dating to determine the age of Earth.\nThisradioactive(https://openstax.org/l/30radiodecay)decay simulator lets you examine how the number\nof atoms of a radioactive element decreases over time and see how the ratio of parent to child atoms could\nbe used to figure out the age of the whole set of atoms.\nWhen astronauts first flew to the Moon, one of their most important tasks was to bring back lunar rocks for\nradioactive age-dating. Until then, astronomers and geologists had no reliable way to measure the age of the\nlunar surface. Counting craters had let us calculate relative ages (for example, the heavily cratered lunar\nhighlands were older than the dark lava plains), but scientists could not measure the actual age in years. Some\nthought that the ages were as young as those of Earth\u2019s surface, which has been resurfaced by many\ngeological events. For the Moon\u2019s surface to be so young would imply active geology on our satellite. Only in\n1969, when the first Apollo samples were dated, did we learn that the Moon is an ancient, geologically dead\nworld. Using such dating techniques, we have been able to determine the ages of both Earth and the Moon:\neach was formed about 4.5 billion years ago (although, as we shall see, Earth probably formed earlier than the\nMoon).\nWe should also note that the decay of radioactive nuclei generally releases energy in the form of heat.\nAlthough the energy from a single nucleus is not very large (in human terms), the enormous numbers of\nradioactive nuclei in a planet or moon (especially early in its existence) can be a significant source of internal\nenergy for that world. Geologists estimate that about half of Earth\u2019s current internal heat budget comes from\nthe decay of radioactive isotopes in its interior.\n7.4 Origin of the Solar System\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the characteristics of planets that are used to create formation models of the solar system\nDescribe how the characteristics of extrasolar systems help us to model our own solar system\nExplain the importance of collisions in the formation of the solar system\nMuch of astronomy is motivated by a desire to understand the origin of things: to find at least partial answers\nto age-old questions of where the universe, the Sun, Earth, and we ourselves came from. Each planet and\nmoon is a fascinating place that may stimulate our imagination as we try to picture what it would be like to\nvisit. Taken together, the members of the solar system preserve patterns that can tell us about the formation\nof the entire system. As we begin our exploration of the planets, we want to introduce our modern picture of\nhow the solar system formed.\nThe recent discovery of thousands of planets in orbit around other stars has shown astronomers that many\nexoplanetary systems can be quite different from our own solar system. For example, it is common for these\nsystems to include planets intermediate in size between our terrestrial and giant planets. These are often\ncalledsuperearths. Some exoplanet systems even have giant planets close to the star, reversing the order we\nsee in our system. InThe Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar System, we will look at\nthese exoplanet systems. But for now, let us focus on theories of how our own particular system has formed\nAccess for free at openstax.org 7.4 \u2022 Origin of the Solar System 237\nand evolved.\nLooking for Patterns\nOne way to approach our question of origin is to look for regularities among the planets. We found, for\nexample, that all the planets lie in nearly the same plane and revolve in the same direction around the Sun.\nThe Sun also spins in the same direction about its own axis. Astronomers interpret this pattern as evidence\nthat the Sun and planets formed together from a spinning cloud of gas and dust that we call thesolar nebula\n(Figure 7.17).\nFigure7.17Solar Nebula.This artist\u2019s conception of the solar nebula shows the flattened cloud of gas and dust from which our\nplanetary system formed. Icy and rockyplanetesimals (precursors of the planets) can be seen in the foreground. The bright center is\nwhere the Sun is forming. (credit: William K. Hartmann, Planetary Science Institute)\nThe composition of the planets gives another clue about origins. Spectroscopic analysis allows us to determine\nwhich elements are present in the Sun and the planets. The Sun has the same hydrogen-dominated\ncomposition as Jupiter and Saturn, and therefore appears to have been formed from the same reservoir of\nmaterial. In comparison, the terrestrial planets and our Moon are relatively deficient in the light gases and the\nvarious ices that form from the common elements oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen. Instead, on Earth and its\nneighbors, we see mostly the rarer heavy elements such as iron and silicon. This pattern suggests that the\nprocesses that led to planet formation in the inner solar system must somehow have excluded much of the\nlighter materials that are common elsewhere. These lighter materials must have escaped, leaving a residue of\nheavy stuff.\nThe reason for this is not hard to guess, bearing in mind the heat of the Sun. The inner planets and most of the\nasteroids are made of rock and metal, which can survive heat, but they contain very little ice or gas, which\nevaporate when temperatures are high. (To see what we mean, just compare how long a rock and an ice cube\nsurvive when they are placed in the sunlight.) In the outer solar system, where it has always been cooler, the\nplanets and their moons, as well as icy dwarf planets and comets, are composed mostly of ice and gas.\nThe Evidence from Far Away\nA second approach to understanding the origins of the solar system is to look outward for evidence that other\nsystems of planets are forming elsewhere. We cannot look back in time to the formation of our own system,\nbut many stars in space are much younger than the Sun. In these systems, the processes of planet formation\nmight still be accessible to direct observation. We observe that there are many other \u201csolar nebulas\u201d or\ncircumstellar disks\u2014flattened, spinning clouds of gas and dust surrounding young stars. These disks resemble\nour own solar system\u2019s initial stages of formation billions of years ago (Figure 7.18). 238 7 \u2022 Other Worlds: An Introduction to the Solar System\nFigure7.18Atlas of Planetary Nurseries.These Hubble Space Telescope photos show sections of theOrion Nebula, a relatively\nclose-by region where stars are currently forming. Each image shows an embedded circumstellar disk orbiting a very young star.\nSeen from different angles, some are energized to glow by the light of a nearby star while others are dark and seen in silhouette\nagainst the bright glowing gas of the Orion Nebula. Each is a contemporary analog of our own solar nebula\u2014a location where\nplanets are probably being formed today. (credit: modification of work by NASA/ESA, L. Ricci (ESO))\nBuilding Planets\nCircumstellar disks are a common occurrence around very young stars, suggesting that disks and stars form\ntogether. Astronomers can use theoretical calculations to see how solid bodies might form from the gas and\ndust in these disks as they cool. These models show that material begins to coalesce first by forming smaller\nobjects, precursors of the planets, which we callplanetesimals.\nToday\u2019s fast computers can simulate the way millions of planetesimals, probably no larger than 100 kilometers\nin diameter, might gather together under their mutual gravity to form the planets we see today. We are\nbeginning to understand that this process was a violent one, with planetesimals crashing into each other and\nsometimes even disrupting the growing planets themselves. As a consequence of those violent impacts (and\nthe heat from radioactive elements in them), all the planets were heated until they were liquid and gas, and\ntherefore differentiated, which helps explain their present internal structures.\nThe process of impacts and collisions in the early solar system was complex and, apparently, often random.\nThe solar nebula model can explain many of the regularities we find in the solar system, but the random\ncollisions of massive collections of planetesimals could be the reason for some exceptions to the \u201crules\u201d of\nsolar system behavior. For example, why do the planets Uranus and Pluto spin on their sides? Why does Venus\nspin slowly and in the opposite direction from the other planets? Why does the composition of the Moon\nresemble Earth in many ways and yet exhibit substantial differences? The answers to such questions probably\nlie in enormous collisions that took place in the solar system long before life on Earth began.\nToday, some 4.5 billion years after its origin, the solar system is\u2014thank goodness\u2014a much less violent place.\nAs we will see, however, some planetesimals have continued to interact and collide, and their fragments move\nabout the solar system as roving \u201ctransients\u201d that can make trouble for the established members of the Sun\u2019s\nfamily, such as our own Earth.

The planets can be divided into two groups: the inner terrestrial planets and the\nouter giant planets. Pluto, Eris, Haumea, and Makemake do not fit into either category; as icy dwarf planets,\nthey exist in an ice realm on the fringes of the main planetary system. The giant planets are composed mostly\nof liquids and gases. Smaller members of the solar system include asteroids (including the dwarf planet\nCeres), which are rocky and metallic objects found mostly between Mars and Jupiter; comets, which are made\nmostly of frozen gases and generally orbit far from the Sun; and countless smaller grains of cosmic dust.\nWhen a meteor survives its passage through our atmosphere and falls to Earth, we call it a meteorite.\n7.2Composition and Structure of Planets\nThe giant planets have dense cores roughly 10 times the mass of Earth, surrounded by layers of hydrogen and\nhelium. The terrestrial planets consist mostly of rocks and metals. They were once molten, which allowed their\nstructures to differentiate (that is, their denser materials sank to the center). The Moon resembles the\nterrestrial planets in composition, but most of the other moons\u2014which orbit the giant planets\u2014have larger\nquantities of frozen ice within them. In general, worlds closer to the Sun have higher surface temperatures.\nThe surfaces of terrestrial planets have been modified by impacts from space and by varying degrees of\ngeological activity.\n7.3Dating Planetary Surfaces\nThe ages of the surfaces of objects in the solar system can be estimated by counting craters: on a given world,\na more heavily cratered region will generally be older than one that is less cratered. We can also use samples\nof rocks with radioactive elements in them to obtain the time since the layer in which the rock formed last\nsolidified. The half-life of a radioactive element is the time it takes for half the sample to decay; we determine\nhow many half-lives have passed by how much of a sample remains the radioactive element and how much 240 7 \u2022 For Further Exploration\nhas become the decay product. In this way, we have estimated the age of the Moon and Earth to be roughly\n4.5 billion years.\n7.4Origin of the Solar System\nRegularities among the planets have led astronomers to hypothesize that the Sun and the planets formed\ntogether in a giant, spinning cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula. Astronomical observations show\ntantalizingly similar circumstellar disks around other stars. Within the solar nebula, material first coalesced\ninto planetesimals; many of these gathered together to make the planets and moons. The remainder can still\nbe seen as comets and asteroids. Probably all planetary systems have formed in similar ways, but many\nexoplanet systems have evolved along quite different paths, as we will see inCosmic Samples and the Origin\nof the Solar System.\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nDavidson, K. \u201cCarl Sagan\u2019s Coming of Age.\u201dAstronomy.(November 1999): 40.

Earth, on the other hand, has\nfew craters, but a thick atmosphere and much surface activity. Although impacts occurred on Earth at the\nsame rate, craters have since been erased by forces in the planet\u2019s crust and atmosphere. What can the\ncomparison between the obvious persistent cratering on so many other worlds, and the different appearance\nof Earth, tell us about the history of our planet?\nAs our first step in exploring the solar system in more detail, we turn to the most familiar planet, our own\nEarth. The first humans to see Earth as a blue sphere floating in the blackness of space were the astronauts\nwho made the first voyage around the Moon in 1968. For many people, the historic images showing our world\nas a small, distant globe represent a pivotal moment in human history, when it became difficult for educated\nhuman beings to view our world without a global perspective. In this chapter, we examine the composition\nand structure of our planet with its envelope of ocean and atmosphere. We ask how our terrestrial\nenvironment came to be the way it is today, and how it compares with other planets. 246 8 \u2022 Earth as a Planet\n8.1 The Global Perspective\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the components of Earth\u2019s interior and explain how scientists determined its structure\nSpecify the origin, size, and extent of Earth\u2019s magnetic field\nEarthis a medium-size planet with a diameter of approximately 12,760 kilometers (Figure 8.2). As one of the\ninner or terrestrial planets, it is composed primarily of heavy elements such as iron, silicon, and oxygen\u2014very\ndifferent from the composition of the Sun and stars, which are dominated by the light elements hydrogen and\nhelium. Earth\u2019s orbit is nearly circular, and Earth is warm enough to support liquid water on its surface. It is\nthe only planet in our solar system that is neither too hot nor too cold, but \u201cjust right\u201d for the development of\nlife as we know it. Some of the basic properties of Earth are summarized inTable 8.1.\nFigure8.2Blue Marble.This image of Earth from space, taken by the Apollo 17 astronauts, is known as the \u201cBlue Marble.\u201d This is\none of the rare images of a full Earth taken during the Apollo program; most images show only part of Earth\u2019s disk in sunlight.\n(credit: modification of work by NASA)\nSome Properties of Earth\nProperty Measurement\nSemimajor axis 1.00 AU\nPeriod 1.00 year\nMass 5.98 \u00d7 1024kg\nDiameter 12,756 km\nRadius 6378 km\nEscape velocity 11.2 km/s\nTable8.1\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.1 \u2022 The Global Perspective 247\nProperty Measurement\nRotational period 23 h 56 m 4 s\nSurface area 5.1 \u00d7 108km2\nDensity 5.514 g/cm3\nAtmospheric pressure 1.00 bar\nTable8.1\nEarth\u2019s Interior\nThe interior of a planet\u2014even our own Earth\u2014is difficult to study, and its composition and structure must be\ndetermined indirectly. Our only direct experience is with the outermost skin of Earth\u2019s crust, a layer no more\nthan a few kilometers deep. It is important to remember that, in many ways, we know less about our own\nplanet 5 kilometers beneath our feet than we do about the surfaces of Venus and Mars.\nEarth is composed largely of metal and silicate rock (see theComposition and Structure of Planetssection).\nMost of this material is in a solid state, but some of it is hot enough to be molten. The structure of material in\nEarth\u2019s interiorhas been probed in considerable detail by measuring the transmission ofseismic waves\nthrough Earth. These are waves that spread through the interior of Earth from earthquakes or explosion sites.\nSeismic waves travel through a planet rather like sound waves through a struck bell. Just as the sound\nfrequencies vary depending on the material the bell is made of and how it is constructed, so a planet\u2019s\nresponse depends on its composition and structure. By monitoring the seismic waves in different locations,\nscientists can learn about the layers through which the waves have traveled. Some of these vibrations travel\nalong the surface; others pass directly through the interior. Seismic studies have shown that Earth\u2019s interior\nconsists of several distinct layers with different compositions, illustrated inFigure 8.3. As waves travel through\ndifferent materials in Earth\u2019s interior, the waves\u2014just like light waves in telescope lenses\u2014bend (or refract) so\nthat some seismic stations on Earth receive the waves and others are in \u201cshadows.\u201d Detecting the waves in a\nnetwork of seismographs helps scientists construct a model of Earth\u2019s interior, showing liquid and solid layers.\nThis type of seismic imaging is not unlike that used in ultrasound, a type of imaging used to see inside the\nbody. 248 8 \u2022 Earth as a Planet\nFigure8.3Interior Structure of Earth.The crust, mantle, and inner and outer cores (solid and liquid, respectively) as shown as\nrevealed by seismic studies.\nThe top layer is thecrust, the part of Earth we know best (Figure 8.4). Oceanic crust covers 55% ofEarth\u2019s\nsurfaceand lies mostly submerged under the oceans. It is typically about 6 kilometers thick and is composed\nof volcanic rocks calledbasalt. Produced by the cooling of volcanic lava, basalts are made primarily of the\nelements silicon, oxygen, iron, aluminum, and magnesium. The continental crust covers 45% of the surface,\nsome of which is also beneath the oceans. The continental crust is 20 to 70 kilometers thick and is composed\npredominantly of a different volcanic class of silicates (rocks made of silicon and oxygen) calledgranite. These\ncrustal rocks, both oceanic and continental, typically have densities of about 3 g/cm3. (For comparison, the\ndensity of water is 1 g/cm3.) The crust is the easiest layer for geologists to study, but it makes up only about\n0.3% of the total mass of Earth.\nFigure8.4Earth\u2019s Crust.This computer-generated image shows the surface ofEarth\u2019s crustas determined from satellite images\nand ocean floor radar mapping. Oceans and lakes are shown in blue, with darker areas representing depth. Dry land is shown in\nshades of green and brown, and the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are depicted in shades of white. (credit: modification of work\nby C. Amante, B. W. Eakins, National Geophysical Data Center, NOAA)\nThe largest part of the solid Earth, called themantle, stretches from the base of the crust downward to a\ndepth of 2900 kilometers. The mantle is more or less solid, but at the temperatures and pressures found there,\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.1 \u2022 The Global Perspective 249\nmantle rock can deform and flow slowly. The density in the mantle increases downward from about 3.5 g/cm3\nto more than 5 g/cm3as a result of the compression produced by the weight of overlying material. Samples of\nupper mantle material are occasionally ejected from volcanoes, permitting a detailed analysis of its chemistry.\nBeginning at a depth of 2900 kilometers, we encounter the dense metalliccoreof Earth. With a diameter of\n7000 kilometers, our core is substantially larger than the entire planet Mercury. The outer core is liquid, but the\ninnermost part of the core (about 2400 kilometers in diameter) is probably solid. In addition to iron, the core\nprobably also contains substantial quantities of nickel and sulfur, all compressed to a very high density.\nThe separation of Earth into layers of different densities is an example ofdifferentiation,the process of sorting\nthe major components of a planet by density. The fact that Earth is differentiated suggests that it was once\nwarm enough for its interior to melt, permitting the heavier metals to sink to the center and form the dense\ncore. Evidence for differentiation comes from comparing the planet\u2019s bulk density (5.5 g/cm3) with the surface\nmaterials (3 g/cm3) to suggest that denser material must be buried in the core.\nMagnetic Field and Magnetosphere\nWe can find additional clues about Earth\u2019s interior from its magnetic field. Our planet behaves in some ways as\nif a giant bar magnet were inside it, aligned approximately with the rotational poles of Earth. This magnetic\nfield is generated by moving material in Earth\u2019s liquid metallic core. As the liquid metal inside Earth circulates,\nit sets up a circulating electric current. When many charged particles are moving together like that\u2014in the\nlaboratory or on the scale of an entire planet\u2014they produce a magnetic field.\nEarth\u2019s magnetic fieldextends into surrounding space. When a charged particle encounters a magnetic field in\nspace, it becomes trapped in the magnetic zone. Above Earth\u2019s atmosphere, our field is able to trap small\nquantities of electrons and other atomic particles. This region, called themagnetosphere, is defined as the\nzone within which Earth\u2019s magnetic field dominates over the weak interplanetary magnetic field that extends\noutward from the Sun (Figure 8.5).\nFigure8.5Earth\u2019s Magnetosphere.A cross-sectional view of our magnetosphere (or zone of magnetic influence), as revealed by\nnumerous spacecraft missions. Note how the wind of charged particles from the Sun \u201cblows\u201d the magnetic field outward like a wind\nsock.\nWhere do the charged particles trapped in our magnetosphere come from? They flow outward from the hot\nsurface of the Sun; this is called thesolar wind. It not only provides particles for Earth\u2019s magnetic field to trap,\nit also stretches our field in the direction pointing away from the Sun. Typically,Earth\u2019s magnetosphere\nextends about 60,000 kilometers, or 10 Earth radii, in the direction of the Sun. But, in the direction away from\nthe Sun, the magnetic field can reach as far as the orbit of the Moon, and sometimes farther. 250 8 \u2022 Earth as a Planet\nThe magnetosphere was discovered in 1958 by instruments on the first US Earth satellite,Explorer 1, which\nrecorded the ions (charged particles) trapped in its inner part. The regions of high-energy ions in the\nmagnetosphere are often called theVan Allen beltsin recognition of the University of Iowa professor who built\nthe scientific instrumentation forExplorer 1. Since 1958, hundreds of spacecraft have explored various regions\nof the magnetosphere. You can read more about its interaction with the Sun in a later chapter.\n8.2 Earth\u2019s Crust\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDenote the primary types of rock that constitute Earth\u2019s crust\nExplain the theory of plate tectonics\nDescribe the difference between rift and subduction zones\nDescribe the relationship between fault zones and mountain building\nExplain the various types of volcanic activity occurring on Earth\nLet us now examine our planet\u2019s outer layers in more detail.Earth\u2019s crust is a dynamic place. Volcanic\neruptions, erosion, and large-scale movements of the continents rework the surface of our planet constantly.\nGeologically, ours is the most active planet. Many of the geological processes described in this section have\ntaken place on other planets as well, but usually in their distant pasts. Some of the moons of the giant planets\nalso have impressive activity levels. For example, Jupiter\u2019s moonIohas a remarkable number of active\nvolcanoes.\nComposition of the Crust\nEarth\u2019s crustis largely made up of oceanic basalt and continental granite. These are bothigneous rock, the\nterm used for any rock that has cooled from a molten state. All volcanically produced rock is igneous (Figure\n8.6).\nFigure8.6Formation of Igneous Rock as Liquid Lava Cools and Freezes.This is a lava flow from a basaltic eruption. Basaltic lava\nflows quickly and can move easily over distances of more than 20 kilometers. (credit: USGS)\nTwo other kinds of rock are familiar to us on Earth, although it turns out that neither is common on other\nplanets.Sedimentary rocksare made of fragments of igneous rock or the shells of living organisms\ndeposited by wind or water and cemented together without melting. On Earth, these rocks include the\ncommon sandstones, shales, and limestones.Metamorphic rocksare produced when high temperature or\npressure alters igneous or sedimentary rock physically or chemically (the wordmetamorphicmeans \u201cchanged\nin form\u201d). Metamorphic rocks are produced on Earth because geological activity carries surface rocks down to\nconsiderable depths and then brings them back up to the surface. Without such activity, these changed rocks\nwould not exist at the surface.\nThere is a fourth very important category of rock that can tell us much about the early history of the planetary\nsystem:primitive rock, which has largely escaped chemical modification by heating. Primitive rock represents\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.2 \u2022 Earth\u2019s Crust 251\nthe original material out of which the planetary system was made. No primitive material is left on Earth\nbecause the entire planet was heated early in its history. To find primitive rock, we must look to smaller objects\nsuch as comets, asteroids, and small planetary moons. We can sometimes see primitive rock in samples that\nfall to Earth from these smaller objects.\nA block of quartzite on Earth is composed of materials that have gone through all four of these states.\nBeginning as primitive material before Earth was born, it was heated in the early Earth to form igneous rock,\ntransformed chemically and redeposited (perhaps many times) to form sedimentary rock, and finally changed\nseveral kilometers below Earth\u2019s surface into the hard, white metamorphic stone we see today.\nPlate Tectonics\nGeologyis the study of Earth\u2019s crust and the processes that have shaped its surface throughout history.\n(Althoughgeo- means \u201crelated to Earth,\u201d astronomers and planetary scientists also talk about the geology of\nother planets.) Heat escaping from the interior provides energy for the formation of our planet\u2019s mountains,\nvalleys, volcanoes, and even the continents and ocean basins themselves. But not until the middle of the\ntwentieth century did geologists succeed in understanding just how these landforms are created.\nPlate tectonicsis an idea that explains how slow motions within the mantle of Earth move large segments of\nthe crust, resulting in a gradual \u201cdrifting\u201d of the continents as well as the formation of mountains and other\nlarge-scale geological features. Plate tectonics is a concept as basic to geology as evolution by natural\nselection is to biology or gravity is to understanding the orbits of planets. Looking at it from a different\nperspective, plate tectonics is a mechanism for Earth to transport heat efficiently from the interior, where it\nhas accumulated, out to space. It is a cooling system for the planet. All planets develop a heat transfer process\nas they evolve; mechanisms may differ from that on Earth as a result of chemical makeup and other\nconstraints.\nEarth\u2019s crustand upper mantle (to a depth of about 60 kilometers) are divided into about a dozen tectonic\nplates that fit together like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle (Figure 8.7). In some places, such as the Atlantic\nOcean, the plates are moving apart; in others, such as off the western coast of South America, they are being\nforced together. The power to move the plates is provided by slowconvectionof the mantle, a process by\nwhich heat escapes from the interior through the upward flow of warmer material and the slow sinking of\ncooler material. (Convection, in which energy is transported from a warm region, such as the interior of Earth,\nto a cooler region, such as the upper mantle, is a process we encounter often in astronomy\u2014in stars as well as\nplanets. It is also important in boiling water for coffee while studying for astronomy exams.)\nFigure8.7Earth\u2019s Continental Plates.This map shows the major plates into which the crust of Earth is divided. Arrows indicate the 252 8 \u2022 Earth as a Planet\nmotion of the plates at average speeds of 4 to 5 centimeters per year, similar to the rate at which your hair grows.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe US Geological Survey provides amap of recent earthquakes(https://openstax.org/l/30geosurmapeart)\nand shows the boundaries of the tectonic plates and where earthquakes occur in relation to these\nboundaries. You can look close-up at the United States or zoom out for a global view.\nAs the plates slowly move, they bump into each other and cause dramatic changes in Earth\u2019s crust over time.\nFour basic kinds of interactions between crustal plates are possible at their boundaries: (1) they can pull apart,\n(2) one plate can burrow under another, (3) they can slide alongside each other, or (4) they can jam together.\nEach of these activities is important in determining the geology of Earth.\nVOYAGERS IN ASTRONOMY\nAlfred Wegener: Catching the Drift of Plate Tectonics\nWhen studying maps or globes of Earth, many students notice that the coast of North and South America,\nwith only minor adjustments, could fit pretty well against the coast of Europe and Africa. It seems as if these\ngreat landmasses could once have been together and then were somehow torn apart. The same idea had\noccurred to others (including Francis Bacon as early as 1620), but not until the twentieth century could such\na proposal be more than speculation. The scientist who made the case for continental drift in 1920 was a\nGerman meteorologist and astronomer named AlfredWegener(Figure 8.8).\nFigure8.8Alfred Wegener (1880\u20131930).Wegener proposed a scientific theory for the slow shifting of the continents.\nBorn in Berlin in 1880, Wegener was, from an early age, fascinated by Greenland, the world\u2019s largest island,\nwhich he dreamed of exploring. He studied at the universities in Heidelberg, Innsbruck, and Berlin,\nreceiving a doctorate in astronomy by reexamining thirteenth-century astronomical tables. But, his\ninterests turned more and more toward Earth, particularly its weather. He carried out experiments using\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.2 \u2022 Earth\u2019s Crust 253\nkites and balloons, becoming so accomplished that he and his brother set a world record in 1906 by flying\nfor 52 hours in a balloon.\nWegener first conceived of continental drift in 1910 while examining a world map in an atlas, but it took 2\nyears for him to assemble sufficient data to propose the idea in public. He published the results in book\nform in 1915. Wegener\u2019s evidence went far beyond the congruence in the shapes of the continents. He\nproposed that the similarities between fossils found only in South America and Africa indicated that these\ntwo continents were joined at one time. He also showed that resemblances among living animal species on\ndifferent continents could best be explained by assuming that the continents were once connected in a\nsupercontinent he calledPangaea(from Greek elements meaning \u201call land\u201d).\nWegener\u2019s suggestion was met with a hostile reaction from most scientists. Although he had marshaled an\nimpressive list of arguments for his hypothesis, he was missing amechanism. No one could explainhow\nsolid continents could drift over thousands of miles. A few scientists were sufficiently impressed by\nWegener\u2019s work to continue searching for additional evidence, but many found the notion of moving\ncontinents too revolutionary to take seriously. Developing an understanding of the mechanism (plate\ntectonics) would take decades of further progress in geology, oceanography, and geophysics.\nWegener was disappointed in the reception of his suggestion, but he continued his research and, in 1924,\nhe was appointed to a special meteorology and geophysics professorship created especially for him at the\nUniversity of Graz (where he was, however, ostracized by most of the geology faculty). Four years later, on\nhis fourth expedition to his beloved Greenland, he celebrated his fiftieth birthday with colleagues and then\nset off on foot toward a different camp on the island. He never made it; he was found a few days later, dead\nof an apparent heart attack.\nCritics of science often point to the resistance to the continental drift hypothesis as an example of the\nflawed way that scientists regard new ideas. (Many people who have advanced crackpot theories have\nclaimed that they are being ridiculed unjustly, just as Wegener was.) But we think there is a more positive\nlight in which to view the story of Wegener\u2019s suggestion. Scientists in his day maintained a skeptical\nattitude because they needed more evidence and a clear mechanism that would fit what they understood\nabout nature. Once the evidence and the mechanism were clear, Wegener\u2019s hypothesis quickly became the\ncenterpiece of our view of a dynamic Earth.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nSee how thedrift of the continents(https://openstax.org/l/30contintdrift)has changed the appearance of\nour planet\u2019s crust.\nRift and Subduction Zones\nPlates pull apart from each other alongrift zones, such as the Mid-Atlantic ridge, driven by upwelling currents\nin the mantle (Figure 8.9). A few rift zones are found on land. The best known is the central African rift\u2014an\narea where the African continent is slowly breaking apart. Most rift zones, however, are in the oceans. Molten\nrock rises from below to fill the space between the receding plates; this rock is basaltic lava, the kind of\nigneous rock that forms most of the ocean basins. 254 8 \u2022 Earth as a Planet\nFigure8.9Rift Zone and Subduction Zone.Rift and subduction zones are the regions (mostly beneath the oceans) where new crust\nis formed and old crust is destroyed as part of the cycle of plate tectonics.\nFrom a knowledge of how the seafloor is spreading, we can calculate the average age of the oceanic crust.\nAbout 60,000 kilometers of active rifts have been identified, with average separation rates of about 5\ncentimeters per year. The new area added to Earth each year is about 2 square kilometers, enough to renew\nthe entire oceanic crust in a little more than 100 million years. This is a very short interval in geological\ntime\u2014less than 3% of the age of Earth. The present ocean basins thus turn out to be among the youngest\nfeatures on our planet.\nAs new crust is added to Earth, the old crust must go somewhere. When two plates come together, one plate is\noften forced beneath another in what is called asubductionzone (Figure 8.9). In general, the thick continental\nmasses cannot be subducted, but the thinner oceanic plates can be rather readily thrust down into the upper\nmantle. Often a subduction zone is marked by an ocean trench; a fine example of this type of feature is the\ndeep Japan trench along the coast of Asia. The subducted plate is forced down into regions of high pressure\nand temperature, eventually melting several hundred kilometers below the surface. Its material is recycled\ninto a downward-flowing convection current, ultimately balancing the flow of material that rises along rift\nzones. The amount of crust destroyed at subduction zones is approximately equal to the amount formed at rift\nzones.\nAll along the subduction zone, earthquakes and volcanoes mark the death throes of the plate. Some of the\nmost destructive earthquakes in history have taken place along subduction zones, including the 1923\nYokohama earthquake and fire that killed 100,000 people, the 2004 Sumatra earthquake and tsunami that\nkilled more than 200,000 people, and the 2011 Tohoku earthquake that resulted in the meltdown of three\nnuclear power reactors in Japan.\nFault Zones and Mountain Building\nAlong much of their length, the crustal plates slide parallel to each other. These plate boundaries are marked\nby cracks orfaults. Along active fault zones, the motion of one plate with respect to the other is several\ncentimeters per year, about the same as the spreading rates along rifts.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.2 \u2022 Earth\u2019s Crust 255\nOne of the most famous faults is the San Andreas Fault in California, which lies at the boundary between the\nPacific plate and the North American plate (Figure 8.10). This fault runs from the Gulf of California to the Pacific\nOcean northwest of San Francisco. The Pacific plate, to the west, is moving northward, carrying Los Angeles,\nSan Diego, and parts of the southern California coast with it. In several million years, Los Angeles may be an\nisland off the coast of San Francisco.\nFigure8.10San Andreas Fault.We see part of a very active region in California where one crustal plate is sliding sideways with\nrespect to the other. The fault is marked by the valley running up the right side of the photo. Major slippages along this fault can\nproduce extremely destructive earthquakes. (credit: John Wiley)\nUnfortunately for us, the motion along fault zones does not take place smoothly. The creeping motion of the\nplates against each other builds up stresses in the crust that are released in sudden, violent slippages that\ngenerate earthquakes. Because the average motion of the plates is constant, the longer the interval between\nearthquakes, the greater the stress and the more energy released when the surface finally moves.\nFor example, the part of the San Andreas Fault near the central California town of Parkfield has slipped every\n25 years or so during the past century, moving an average of about 1 meter each time. In contrast, the\naverage interval between major earthquakes in the Los Angeles region is about 150 years, and the average\nmotion is about 7 meters. The last time the San Andreas fault slipped in this area was in 1857; tension has\nbeen building ever since, and sometime soon it is bound to be released. Sensitive instruments placed within\nthe Los Angeles basin show that the basin is distorting and contracting in size as these tremendous pressures\nbuild up beneath the surface.\nEXAMPLE 8.1\nFault Zones and Plate Motion\nAfter scientists mapped the boundaries between tectonic plates in Earth\u2019s crust and measured the annual\nrate at which the plates move (which is about 5 cm/year), we could estimate quite a lot about the rate at\nwhich the geology of Earth is changing. As an example, let\u2019s suppose that the next slippage along the San\nAndreas Fault in southern California takes place in the year 2027 and that it completely relieves the\naccumulated strain in this region. How much slippage is required for this to occur?\nSolution\nThe speed of motion of the Pacific plate relative to the North American plate is 5 cm/y. That\u2019s 500 cm (or 5\nm) per century. The last southern California earthquake was in 1857. The time from 1857 to 2027 is 256 8 \u2022 Earth as a Planet\n170 y, or 1.7 centuries, so the slippage to relieve the strain completely would be\n5 m/century \u00d7 1.7 centuries = 8.5 m.\nCheck Your Learning\nIf the next major southern California earthquake occurs in 2047 and only relieves one-half of the\naccumulated strain, how much slippage will occur?\nAnswer:\nThe difference in time from 1857 to 2047 is 190 y, or 1.9 centuries. Because only half the strain is released,\nthis is equivalent to half the annual rate of motion. The total slippage comes to\n0.5 \u00d7 5 m/century \u00d7 1.9 centuries = 4.75 m.\nWhen two continental masses are moving on a collision course, they push against each other under great\npressure. Earth buckles and folds, dragging some rock deep below the surface and raising other folds to\nheights of many kilometers. This is the way many, but not all, of the mountain ranges on Earth were formed.\nThe Alps, for example, are a result of the African plate bumping into the Eurasian plate. As we will see,\nhowever, quite different processes produced the mountains on other planets.\nOnce a mountain range is formed by upthrusting of the crust, its rocks are subject to erosion by water and ice.\nThe sharp peaks and serrated edges have little to do with the forces that make the mountains initially. Instead,\nthey result from the processes that tear down mountains. Ice is an especially effective sculptor of rock (Figure\n8.11). In a world without moving ice or running water (such as the Moon or Mercury), mountains remain\nsmooth and dull.\nFigure8.11Mountains on Earth.The Torres del Paine are a young region of Earth\u2019s crust where sharp mountain peaks are being\nsculpted by glaciers. We owe the beauty of our young, steep mountains to the erosion by ice and water. (credit: David Morrison)\nVolcanoes\nVolcanoesmark locations where lava rises to the surface. One example is mid ocean ridges, which are long\nundersea mountain ranges formed by lava rising from Earth\u2019s mantle at plate boundaries. A second major\nkind of volcanic activity is associated with subduction zones, and volcanoes sometimes also appear in regions\nwhere continental plates are colliding. In each case, the volcanic activity gives us a way to sample some of the\nmaterial from deeper within our planet.\nOther volcanic activity occurs above mantle \u201chot spots\u201d\u2014areas far from plate boundaries where heat is\nnevertheless rising from the interior of Earth. One of the best-known hot spots is under the island of Hawaii,\nwhere it currently supplies the heat to maintain three active volcanoes, two on land and one under the ocean.\nThe Hawaii hot spot has been active for at least 100 million years. As Earth\u2019s plates have moved during that\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.3 \u2022 Earth\u2019s Atmosphere 257\ntime, the hot spot has generated a 3500-kilometer-long chain of volcanic islands. The tallest Hawaiian\nvolcanoes are among the largest individual mountains on Earth, more than 100 kilometers in diameter and\nrising 9 kilometers above the ocean floor. One of the Hawaiian volcanic mountains, the now-dormant\nMaunakea, has become one of the world\u2019s great sites for doing astronomy.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe US Geological Service providesan interactive map(https://openstax.org/l/30mapringoffire)of the\nfamous \u201cring of fire,\u201d which is the chain of volcanoes surrounding the Pacific Ocean, and shows the\nHawaiian \u201chot spot\u201d enclosed within.\nNot all volcanic eruptions produce mountains. If lava flows rapidly from long cracks, it can spread out to form\nlava plains. The largest known terrestrial eruptions, such as those that produced the Snake River basalts in the\nnorthwestern United States or the Deccan plateau in India, are of this type. Similar lava plains are found on the\nMoon and the other terrestrial planets.\n8.3 Earth\u2019s Atmosphere\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDifferentiate between Earth\u2019s various atmospheric layers\nDescribe the chemical composition and possible origins of our atmosphere\nExplain the difference between weather and climate\nWe live at the bottom of the ocean of air that envelops our planet. The atmosphere, weighing down upon\nEarth\u2019s surface under the force of gravity, exerts a pressure at sea level that scientists define as 1bar(a term\nthat comes from the same root asbarometer, an instrument used to measure atmospheric pressure). A bar of\npressure means that each square centimeter of Earth\u2019s surface has a weight equivalent to 1.03 kilograms\npressing down on it. Humans have evolved to live at this pressure; make the pressure a lot lower or higher and\nwe do not function well.\nThe total mass ofEarth\u2019s atmosphereis about 5 \u00d7 1018kilograms. This sounds like a large number, but it is\nonly about a millionth of the total mass of Earth. The atmosphere represents a smaller fraction of Earth than\nthe fraction of your mass represented by the hair on your head.\nStructure of the Atmosphere\nThe structure of the atmosphere is illustrated inFigure 8.12. Most of the atmosphere is concentrated near the\nsurface of Earth, within about the bottom 10 kilometers where clouds form and airplanes fly. Within this\nregion\u2014called thetroposphere\u2014warm air, heated by the surface, rises and is replaced by descending\ncurrents of cooler air; this is an example of convection. This circulation generates clouds and wind. Within the\ntroposphere, temperature decreases rapidly with increasing elevation to values near 50 \u00b0C below freezing at its\nupper boundary, where thestratospherebegins. Most of the stratosphere, which extends to about 50\nkilometers above the surface, is cold and free of clouds. 258 8 \u2022 Earth as a Planet\nFigure8.12Structure of Earth\u2019s Atmosphere.Height increases up the left side of the diagram, and the names of the different\natmospheric layers are shown at the right. In the upper ionosphere, ultraviolet radiation from the Sun can strip electrons from their\natoms, leaving the atmosphere ionized. The curving red line shows the temperature (see the scale on thex-axis).\nNear the top of the stratosphere is a layer ofozone(O ), a form of oxygen with three atoms per molecule\n3\ninstead of the usual two. Because ozone is a good absorber of ultraviolet light, it protects the surface from\nsome of the Sun\u2019s dangerous ultraviolet radiation, making it possible for life to exist on Earth. The breakup of\nozone adds heat to the stratosphere, reversing the decreasing temperature trend in the troposphere. Because\nozone is essential to our survival, we reacted with justifiable concern to evidence that became clear in the\n1980s that atmospheric ozone was being destroyed by human activities. By international agreement, the\nproduction of industrial chemicals that cause ozone depletion, called chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, has been\nphased out. As a result, ozone loss has stopped and the \u201cozone hole\u201d over the Antarctic is shrinking gradually.\nThis is an example of how concerted international action can help maintain the habitability of Earth.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit NASA\u2019s scientific visualization studio for ashort video(https://openstax.org/l/302065regcfc)of what\nwould have happened to Earth\u2019s ozone layer by 2065 if CFCs had not been regulated.\nAt heights above 100 kilometers, the atmosphere is so thin that orbiting satellites can pass through it with very\nlittle friction. Many of the atoms are ionized by the loss of an electron, and this region is often called the\nionosphere. At these elevations, individual atoms can occasionally escape completely from the gravitational\nfield of Earth. There is a continuous, slow leaking of atmosphere\u2014especially of lightweight atoms, which move\nfaster than heavy ones. Earth\u2019s atmosphere cannot, for example, hold on for long to hydrogen or helium,\nwhich escape into space. Earth is not the only planet to experience atmosphere leakage. Atmospheric leakage\nalso createdMars\u2019 thin atmosphere.Venus\u2019 dry atmosphere evolved because its proximity to the Sun\nvaporized and dissociated any water, with the component gases lost to space.\nAtmospheric Composition and Origin\nAt Earth\u2019s surface, the atmosphere consists of 78% nitrogen (N ), 21% oxygen (O ), and 1% argon (Ar), with\n2 2\ntraces of water vapor (H O), carbon dioxide (CO ), and other gases. Variable amounts of dust particles and\n2 2\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.3 \u2022 Earth\u2019s Atmosphere 259\nwater droplets are also found suspended in the air.\nA complete census of Earth\u2019s volatile materials, however, should look at more than the gas that is now present.\nVolatilematerials are those that evaporate at a relatively low temperature. If Earth were just a little bit warmer,\nsome materials that are now liquid or solid might become part of the atmosphere. Suppose, for example, that\nour planet were heated to above the boiling point of water (100 \u00b0C, or 373 K); that\u2019s a large change for\nhumans, but a small change compared to the range of possible temperatures in the universe. At 100 \u00b0C, the\noceans would boil and the resulting water vapor would become a part of the atmosphere.\nTo estimate how much water vapor would be released, note that there is enough water to cover the entire\nEarth to a depth of about 300 meters. Because the pressure exerted by 10 meters of water is equal to about 1\nbar, the average pressure at the ocean floor is about 300 bars. Water weighs the same whether in liquid or\nvapor form, so if the oceans boiled away, the atmospheric pressure of the water would still be 300 bars. Water\nwould therefore greatly dominateEarth\u2019s atmosphere, with nitrogen and oxygen reduced to the status of\ntrace constituents.\nOn a warmer Earth, another source of additional atmosphere would be found in the sedimentary carbonate\nrocks of the crust. These minerals contain abundant carbon dioxide. If all these rocks were heated, they would\nrelease about 70 bars of CO , far more than the current CO pressure of only 0.0005 bar. Thus, the atmosphere\n2 2\nof a warm Earth would be dominated by water vapor and carbon dioxide, with a surface pressure nearing 400\nbars.\nSeveral lines of evidence show that the composition of Earth\u2019s atmosphere has changed over our planet\u2019s\nhistory. Scientists can infer the amount of atmospheric oxygen, for example, by studying the chemistry of\nminerals that formed at various times. We examine this issue in more detail later in this chapter.\nToday we see that CO , H O, sulfur dioxide (SO ), and other gases are released from deeper within Earth\n2 2 2\nthrough the action of volcanoes. (For CO , the primary source today is the burning of fossil fuels, which\n2\nreleases far more CO than that from volcanic eruptions.) Much of this apparently new gas, however, is\n2\nrecycled material that has been subducted through plate tectonics. But where did our planet\u2019s original\natmosphere come from?\nThree possibilities exist for the original source of Earth\u2019s atmosphere and oceans: (1) the atmosphere could\nhave been formed with the rest of Earth as it accumulated from debris left over from the formation of the Sun;\n(2) it could have been released from the interior through volcanic activity, subsequent to the formation of\nEarth; or (3) it may have been derived from impacts by comets and asteroids from the outer parts of the solar\nsystem. Current evidence favors a combination of the interior and impact sources.\nWeather and Climate\nAll planets with atmospheres haveweather, which is the name we give to the circulation of the atmosphere.\nThe energy that powers theweatheris derived primarily from the sunlight that heats the surface. Both the\nrotation of the planet and slower seasonal changes cause variations in the amount of sunlight striking\ndifferent parts of Earth. The atmosphere and oceans redistribute the heat from warmer to cooler areas.\nWeather on any planet represents the response of its atmosphere to changing inputs of energy from the Sun\n(seeFigure 8.13for a dramatic example). 260 8 \u2022 Earth as a Planet\nFigure8.13Storm from Space.This satellite image shows Hurricane Irene in 2011, shortly before the storm hit land in New York\nCity. The combination of Earth\u2019s tilted axis of rotation, moderately rapid rotation, and oceans of liquid water can lead to violent\nweather on our planet. (credit: NASA/NOAA GOES Project)\nClimateis a term used to refer to the effects of the atmosphere that last through decades and centuries.\nChanges inclimate(as opposed to the random variations in weather from one year to the next) are often\ndifficult to detect over short time periods, but as they accumulate, their effect can be devastating. One saying\nis that \u201cClimate is what you expect, and weather is what you get.\u201d Modern farming is especially sensitive to\ntemperature and rainfall; for example, calculations indicate that a drop of only 2 \u00b0C throughout the growing\nseason would cut the wheat production by half in Canada and the United States. At the other extreme, an\nincrease of 2 \u00b0C in the average temperature of Earth would be enough to melt many glaciers, including much\nof the ice cover of Greenland, raising sea level by as much as 10 meters, flooding many coastal cities and ports,\nand putting small islands completely under water.\nThe best documented changes in Earth\u2019s climate are the great ice ages, which have lowered the temperature\nof the Northern Hemisphere periodically over the past half million years or so (Figure 8.14). The last ice age,\nwhich ended about 14,000 years ago, lasted some 20,000 years. At its height, the ice was almost 2 kilometers\nthick over Boston and stretched as far south as New York City.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.4 \u2022 Life, Chemical Evolution, and Climate Change 261\nFigure8.14Ice Age.This computer-generated image shows the frozen areas of the Northern Hemisphere during past ice ages from\nthe vantage point of looking down on the North Pole. The area in black indicates the most recent glaciation (coverage by glaciers),\nand the area in gray shows the maximum level of glaciation ever reached. (credit: modification of work by Hannes Grobe/AWI)\nThese ice ages were primarily the result of changes in the tilt of Earth\u2019s rotational axis, produced by the\ngravitational effects of the other planets. We are less certain about evidence that at least once (and perhaps\ntwice) about a billion years ago, the entire ocean froze over, a situation calledsnowballEarth.\nThe development and evolution of life on Earth has also produced changes in the composition and\ntemperature of our planet\u2019s atmosphere, as we shall see in the next section.\n8.4 Life, Chemical Evolution, and Climate Change\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nOutline the origins and subsequent diversity of life on Earth\nExplain the ways that life and geological activity have influenced the evolution of the atmosphere\nDescribe the causes and effects of the atmospheric greenhouse effect and global warming\nDescribe the impact of human activity on our planet\u2019s atmosphere and ecology\nAs far as we know,Earthseems to be the only planet in the solar system with life. The origin and development\nof life are an important part of our planet\u2019s story. Life arose early in Earth\u2019s history, and living organisms have\nbeen interacting with their environment for billions of years. We recognize that life-forms have evolved to\nadapt to the environment on Earth, and we are now beginning to realize that Earth itself has been changed in\nimportant ways by the presence of living matter. The study of the coevolution of life and our planet is one of\nthe subjects of the modern science ofastrobiology. 262 8 \u2022 Earth as a Planet\nThe Origin of Life\nThe record of the birth of life on Earth has been lost in the restless motions of the crust. According to chemical\nevidence, by the time the oldest surviving rocks were formed about 3.9 billion years ago, life already existed. At\n3.5 billion years ago, life had achieved the sophistication to build large colonies calledstromatolites, a form so\nsuccessful that stromatolites still grow on Earth today (Figure 8.15). But, few rocks survive from these ancient\ntimes, and abundant fossils have been preserved only during the past 600 million years\u2014less than 15% of our\nplanet\u2019s history.\nFigure8.15Cross-Sections of Fossil Stromatolites.This polished cross-section of a fossilized colony of stromatolites dates to the\nPrecambrian Era. The layered, domelike structures are mats of sediment trapped in shallow waters by large numbers of blue-green\nbacteria that can photosynthesize. Such colonies of microorganisms date back more than 3 billion years. (credit: James St. John)\nThere is little direct evidence about the actual origin of life. We know that the atmosphere of early Earth, unlike\ntoday\u2019s, contained abundant carbon dioxide and some methane, but no oxygen gas. In the absence of oxygen,\nmany complex chemical reactions are possible that lead to the production of amino acids, proteins, and other\nchemical building blocks of life. Therefore, it seems likely that these chemical building blocks were available\nvery early in Earth\u2019s history and they would have combined to make living organisms.\nFor tens of millions of years after Earth\u2019s formation, life (perhaps little more than large molecules, like the\nviruses of today) probably existed in warm, nutrient-rich seas, living off accumulated organic chemicals. When\nthis easily accessible food became depleted, life began the long evolutionary road that led to the vast numbers\nof different organisms on Earth today. As it did so, life began to influence the chemical composition of the\natmosphere.\nIn addition to the study of life\u2019s history as revealed by chemical and fossil evidence in ancient rocks, scientists\nuse tools from the rapidly advancing fields of genetics andgenomics\u2014the study of the genetic code that is\nshared by all life on Earth. While each individual has a unique set of genes (which is why genetic\n\u201cfingerprinting\u201d is so useful for the study of crime), we also have many genetic traits in common. Your\ngenome, the complete map of the DNA in your body, is identical at the 99.9% level to that of Julius Caesar or\nMarie Curie. At the 99% level, human and chimpanzee genomes are the same. By looking at the gene\nsequences of many organisms, we can determine that all life on Earth is descended from a common ancestor,\nand we can use the genetic variations among species as a measure of how closely different species are related.\nThese genetic analysis tools have allowed scientists to construct what is called the \u201ctree of life\u201d (Figure 8.16).\nThis diagram illustrates the way organisms are related by examining one sequence of the nucleic acid RNA\nthat all species have in common. This figure shows that life on Earth is dominated by microscopic creatures\nthat you have probably never heard of. Note that the plant and animal kingdoms are just two little branches at\nthe far right. Most of the diversity of life, and most of our evolution, has taken place at the microbial level.\nIndeed, it may surprise you to know that there are more microbes in a bucket of soil than there are stars in the\nGalaxy. You may want to keep this in mind when, later in this book, we turn to the search for life on other\nworlds. The \u201caliens\u201d that are most likely to be out there are microbes.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.4 \u2022 Life, Chemical Evolution, and Climate Change 263\nFigure8.16Tree of Life.This chart shows the main subdivisions of life on Earth and how they are related. Note that the animal and\nplant kingdoms are just short branches on the far right, along with the fungi. The most fundamental division of Earth\u2019s living things\nis onto three large domains called bacteria, archaea, and eukarya. Most of the species listed are microscopic. (credit: modification of\nwork by Eric Gaba)\nSuch genetic studies lead to other interesting conclusions as well. For example, it appears that the earliest\nsurviving terrestrial life-forms were all adapted to live at high temperatures. Some biologists think that life\nmight actually have begun in locations on our planet that were extremely hot. Yet another intriguing\npossibility is that life began onMars(which cooled sooner) rather than Earth and was \u201cseeded\u201d onto our\nplanet by meteorites traveling from Mars to Earth. Mars rocks are still making their way to Earth, but so far\nnone has shown evidence of serving as a \u201cspaceship\u201d to carry microorganisms from Mars to Earth.\nThe Evolution of the Atmosphere\nOne of the key steps in the evolution of life on Earth was the development of blue-green algae, a very\nsuccessful life-form that takes in carbon dioxide from the environment and releases oxygen as a waste\nproduct. These successful microorganisms proliferated, giving rise to all the lifeforms we call plants. Since the\nenergy for making new plant material from chemical building blocks comes from sunlight, we call the process\nphotosynthesis.\nStudies of the chemistry of ancient rocks show that Earth\u2019s atmosphere lacked abundant free oxygen until\nabout 2 billion years ago, despite the presence of plants releasing oxygen by photosynthesis. Apparently,\nchemical reactions with Earth\u2019s crust removed the oxygen gas as quickly as it formed. Slowly, however, the\nincreasing evolutionary sophistication of life led to a growth in the plant population and thus increased oxygen\nproduction. At the same time, it appears that increased geological activity led to heavy erosion on our planet\u2019s\nsurface. This buried much of the plant carbon before it could recombine with oxygen to form CO .\n2\nFree oxygen began accumulating in the atmosphere about 2 billion years ago, and the increased amount of\nthis gas led to the formation of Earth\u2019s ozone layer (recall that ozone is a triple molecule of oxygen, O ), which\n3 264 8 \u2022 Earth as a Planet\nprotects the surface from deadly solar ultraviolet light. Before that, it was unthinkable for life to venture\noutside the protective oceans, so the landmasses of Earth were barren.\nThe presence of oxygen, and hence ozone, thus allowed colonization of the land. It also made possible a\ntremendous proliferation of animals, which lived by taking in and using the organic materials produced by\nplants as their own energy source.\nAs animals evolved in an environment increasingly rich in oxygen, they were able to develop techniques for\nbreathing oxygen directly from the atmosphere. We humans take it for granted that plenty of free oxygen is\navailable in Earth\u2019s atmosphere, and we use it to release energy from the food we take in. Although it may\nseem funny to think of it this way, we are lifeforms that have evolved to breathe in the waste product of plants.\nIt is plants and related microbes that are the primary producers, using sunlight to create energy-rich \u201cfood\u201d\nfor the rest of us.\nOn a planetary scale, one of the consequences of life has been a decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide. In\nthe absence of life, Earth would probably have an atmosphere dominated by CO , like Mars or Venus. But\n2\nliving things, in combination with high levels of geological activity, have effectively stripped our atmosphere of\nmost of this gas.\nThe Greenhouse Effect and Global Warming\nWe have a special interest in the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere because of the key role this gas\nplays in retaining heat from the Sun through a process called thegreenhouse effect. To understand how the\ngreenhouse effect works, consider the fate of sunlight that strikes the surface of Earth. The light penetrates\nour atmosphere, is absorbed by the ground, and heats the surface layers. At the temperature of Earth\u2019s\nsurface, that energy is then reemitted as infrared or heat radiation (Figure 8.17). However, the molecules of\nour atmosphere, which allow visible light through, are good at absorbing infrared energy. As a result, CO\n2\n(along with methane and water vapor) acts like a blanket, trapping heat in the atmosphere and impeding its\nflow back to space. To maintain an energy balance, the temperature of the surface and lower atmosphere\nmust increase until the total energy radiated by Earth to space equals the energy received from the Sun. The\nmore CO there is in our atmosphere, the higher the temperature at which Earth\u2019s surface reaches a new\n2\nbalance.\nFigure8.17How the Greenhouse Effect Works.Sunlight that penetrates to Earth\u2019s lower atmosphere and surface is reradiated as\ninfrared or heat radiation, which is trapped by greenhouse gases such as water vapor, methane, and CO2in the atmosphere. The\nresult is a higher surface temperature for our planet.\nThe greenhouse effect in a planetary atmosphere is similar to the heating of a gardener\u2019s greenhouse or the\ninside of a car left out in the Sun with the windows rolled up. In these examples, the window glass plays the\nrole ofgreenhouse gases, letting sunlight in but reducing the outward flow of heat radiation. As a result, a\ngreenhouse or car interior winds up much hotter than would be expected from the heating of sunlight alone.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.4 \u2022 Life, Chemical Evolution, and Climate Change 265\nOn Earth, the current greenhouse effect elevates the surface temperature by about 23 \u00b0C. Without this\ngreenhouse effect, the average surface temperature would be well below freezing and Earth would be locked\nin a global ice age.\nThat\u2019s the good news; the bad news is that the heating due to the greenhouse effect is increasing. Modern\nindustrial society depends on energy extracted from burning fossil fuels. In effect, we are exploiting the\nenergy-rich material created by photosynthesis tens of millions of years ago. As these ancient coal and oil\ndeposits are oxidized (burned using oxygen), large quantities of carbon dioxide are released into the\natmosphere. The problem is exacerbated by the widespread destruction of tropical forests, which we depend\non to extract CO from the atmosphere and replenish our supply of oxygen. In the past century of increased\n2\nindustrial and agricultural development, the amount of CO in the atmosphere increased by about 30% and\n2\ncontinues to rise at more than 0.5% per year.\nBefore the end of the present century, Earth\u2019s CO level is predicted to reach twice the value it had before the\n2\nindustrial revolution (Figure 8.18). The consequences of such an increase for Earth\u2019s surface and atmosphere\n(and the creatures who live there) are likely to be complex changes in climate, and may be catastrophic for\nmany species. Many groups of scientists are now studying the effects of such global warming with elaborate\ncomputer models, and climate change has emerged as the greatest known threat (barring nuclear war) to\nboth industrial civilization and the ecology of our planet.\nFigure8.18Increase of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide over Time.Scientists expect that the amount of CO2will double its\npreindustrial level before the end of the twenty-first century. Measurements of the isotopic signatures of this added CO2\ndemonstrate that it is mostly coming from burning fossil fuels. (credit: modification of work by NOAA)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThisshort PBS video(https://openstax.org/l/30pbsgreengas)explains the physics of the greenhouse effect.\nAlready climate change is widely apparent. Around the world, temperature records are constantly set and\nbroken; all but one of the hottest recorded years have taken place since 2000. Glaciers are retreating, and the\nArctic Sea ice is now much thinner than when it was first explored with nuclear submarines in the 1950s. Rising\nsea levels (from both melting glaciers and expansion of the water as its temperature rises) pose one of the\nmost immediate threats, and many coastal cities have plans to build dikes or seawalls to hold back the\nexpected flooding. The rate of temperature increase is without historical precedent, and we are rapidly\nentering \u201cunknown territory\u201d where human activities are leading to the highest temperatures on Earth in\nmore than 50 million years. 266 8 \u2022 Earth as a Planet\nHuman Impacts on Our Planet\nEarth is so large and has been here for so long that some people have trouble accepting that humans are\nreally changing the planet, its atmosphere, and its climate. They are surprised to learn, for example, that the\ncarbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels is 100 times greater than that emitted by volcanoes. But, the\ndata clearly tell the story that our climate is changing rapidly, and that almost all of the change is a result of\nhuman activity.\nThis is not the first time that humans have altered our environment dramatically. Some of the greatest\nchanges were caused by our ancestors, before the development of modern industrial society. If aliens had\nvisited Earth 50,000 years ago, they would have seen much of the planet supporting large animals of the sort\nthat now survive only in Africa. The plains of Australia were occupied by giant marsupials such as diprotodon\nand zygomaturus (the size of our elephants today), and a species of kangaroo that stood 10 feet high. North\nAmerica and North Asia hosted mammoths, saber tooth cats, mastodons, giant sloths, and even camels. The\nIslands of the Pacific teemed with large birds, and vast forests covered what are now the farms of Europe and\nChina. Early human hunters killed many large mammals and marsupials, early farmers cut down most of the\nforests, and the Polynesian expansion across the Pacific doomed the population of large birds.\nAn even greater mass extinction is underway as a result of rapid climate change. In recognition of our impact\non the environment, scientists have proposed giving a new name to the current epoch, theanthropocene,\nwhen human activity started to have a significant global impact. Although not an officially approved name, the\nconcept of \u201canthropocene\u201d is useful for recognizing that we humans now represent the dominant influence on\nour planet\u2019s atmosphere and ecology, for better or for worse.\n8.5 Cosmic Influences on the Evolution of Earth\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain the scarcity of impact craters on Earth compared with other planets and moons\nDescribe the evidence for recent impacts on Earth\nDetail how a massive impact changed the conditions for life on Earth, leading to the extinction of the\ndinosaurs\nDescribe how impacts have influenced the evolution of life on Earth\nDiscuss the search for objects that could potentially collide with our planet\nIn discussing Earth\u2019s geology earlier in this chapter, we dealt only with the effects of internal forces, expressed\nthrough the processes of plate tectonics and volcanism. On the Moon, in contrast, we see primarilycraters,\nproduced by the impacts of interplanetary debrissuch as asteroids and comets. Why don\u2019t we see more\nevidence onEarthof the kinds of impact craters that are so prominent on the Moon and other worlds?\nWhere Are the Craters on Earth?\nIt is not possible that Earth escaped being struck by the interplanetary debris that has pockmarked the Moon.\nFrom a cosmic perspective, the Moon is almost next door. Our atmosphere does make small pieces of cosmic\ndebris burn up (which we see asmeteors\u2014commonly called shooting stars). But, the layers of our air provide\nno shield against the large impacts that form craters several kilometers in diameter and are common on the\nMoon.\nIn the course of its history, Earth must therefore have been impacted as heavily as the Moon. The difference is\nthat, on Earth, these craters are destroyed by our active geology before they can accumulate. As plate\ntectonics constantly renews our crust, evidence of past cratering events is slowly erased. Only in the past few\ndecades have geologists succeeded in identifying the eroded remnants of many impact craters (Figure 8.19).\nEven more recent is our realization that, over the history of Earth, these impacts have had an important\ninfluence on the evolution of life.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.5 \u2022 Cosmic Influences on the Evolution of Earth 267\nFigure8.19Ouarkziz Impact Crater.Located in Algeria, this 4-km-wide crater (the round feature in the center) is the result of a\nmeteor impact during the Cretaceous period. Although the crater has experienced heavy erosion, this image from the International\nSpace Station shows the circular pattern resulting from impact. (credit: modification of work by NASA)\nRecent Impacts\nThe collision of interplanetary debris with Earth is not a hypothetical idea. Evidence of relatively recent impacts\ncan be found on our planet\u2019s surface. One well-studied historic collision took place on June 30, 1908, near the\nTunguska River in Siberia. In this desolate region, there was a remarkable explosion in the atmosphere about 8\nkilometers above the surface. The shock wave flattened more than a thousand square kilometers of forest\n(Figure 8.20). Herds of reindeer and other animals were killed, and a man at a trading post 80 kilometers from\nthe blast was thrown from his chair and knocked unconscious. The blast wave spread around the world, as\nrecorded by instruments designed to measure changes in atmospheric pressure.\nFigure8.20Aftermath of the Tunguska Explosion.This photograph, taken 19 years after the blast, shows a part of the forest that\nwas destroyed by the 5-megaton explosion, resulting when a stony projectile about the size of a small office building (40 meters in\ndiameter) collided with our planet. (credit: modification of work by Leonid Kulik)\nDespite this violence, no craters were formed by theTunguskaexplosion. Shattered by atmospheric pressure, 268 8 \u2022 Earth as a Planet\nthe stony projectile with a diameter of approximately 60 meters disintegrated above our planet\u2019s surface to\ncreate a blast equivalent to a 10-megaton nuclear bomb. Had it been smaller or more fragile, the impacting\nbody would have dissipated its energy at high altitude and probably attracted no attention. Today, such high-\naltitude atmospheric explosions are monitored regularly by military surveillance systems.\nIf it had been larger or made of stronger material (such as metal), the Tunguska projectile would have\npenetrated all the way to the surface of Earth and exploded to form a crater. Instead, only the heat and shock\nof the atmospheric explosion reached the surface, but the devastation it left behind in Siberia bore witness to\nthe power of such impacts. Imagine if the same rocky impactor had exploded over New York City in 1908;\nhistory books might today record it as one of the most deadly events in human history.\nTens of thousands of people witnessed directly the explosion of a smaller (20-meter) projectile over the\nRussian city ofChelyabinskon an early winter morning in 2013. It exploded at a height of 21 kilometers in a\nburst of light brighter than the Sun, and the shockwave of the 0.5-megaton explosion broke tens of thousands\nof windows and sent hundreds of people to the hospital. Rock fragments (meteorites) were easily collected by\npeople in the area after the blast because they landed on fresh snow.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nDr. David Morrison, one of the original authors of this textbook, provides anontechnical talk\n(https://openstax.org/l/30chelyabinskex)about the Chelyabinsk explosion, and impacts in general.\nThe best-known recent crater on Earth was formed about 50,000 years ago in Arizona. The projectile in this\ncase was a lump of iron about 40 meters in diameter. Now calledMeteorCraterand a major tourist attraction\non the way to the Grand Canyon, the crater is about a mile across and has all the features associated with\nsimilar-size lunar impact craters (Figure 8.21).Meteor Crateris one of the few impact features on Earth that\nremains relatively intact; some older craters are so eroded that only a trained eye can distinguish them.\nNevertheless, more than 150 have been identified. (See the list of suggested online sites at the end of this\nchapter if you want to find out more about these other impact scars.)\nFigure8.21Meteor Crater in Arizona.Here we see a 50,000-year-old impact crater made by the collision of a 40-meter lump of iron\nwith our planet. Although impact craters are common on less active bodies such as the Moon, this is one of the very few well-\npreserved craters on Earth. (modification of work by D. Roddy/USGS)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.5 \u2022 Cosmic Influences on the Evolution of Earth 269\nMass Extinction\nThe impact that produced Meteor Crater would have been dramatic indeed to any humans who witnessed it\n(from a safe distance) since the energy release was equivalent to a 10-megaton nuclear bomb. But such\nexplosions are devastating only in their local areas; they have noglobalconsequences. Much larger (and rarer)\nimpacts, however, can disturb the ecological balance of the entire planet and thus influence the course of\nevolution.\nThe best-documented large impact took place 65 million years ago, at the end of what is now called the\nCretaceous period of geological history. This time in the history of life on Earth was marked by amass\nextinction, in which more than half of the species on our planet died out. There are a dozen or more mass\nextinctions in the geological record, but this particular event (nicknamed the \u201cgreat dying\u201d) has always\nintrigued paleontologists because it marks the end of the dinosaur age. For tens of millions of years these\ngreat creatures had flourished and dominated. Then, they suddenly disappeared (along with many other\nspecies), and thereafter mammals began the development and diversification that ultimately led to all of us.\nThe object that collided with Earth at the end of the Cretaceous period struck a shallow sea in what is now the\nYucat\u00e1n peninsula of Mexico. Its mass must have been more than a trillion tons, determined from study of a\nworldwide layer of sediment deposited from the dust cloud that enveloped the planet after its impact. First\nidentified in 1979, this sediment layer is rich in the rare metal iridium and other elements that are relatively\nabundant in asteroids and comets, but exceedingly rare in Earth\u2019s crust. Even though it was diluted by the\nmaterial that the explosion excavated from the surface of Earth, this cosmic component can still be identified.\nIn addition, this layer of sediment contains many minerals characteristic of the temperatures and pressures of\na gigantic explosion.\nThe impact that led to the extinction of dinosaurs released energy equivalent to 5 billion Hiroshima-size\nnuclear bombs and excavated a crater 200 kilometers across and deep enough to penetrate through Earth\u2019s\ncrust. This large crater, namedChicxulubfor a small town near its center, has subsequently been buried in\nsediment, but its outlines can still be identified (Figure 8.22). The explosion that created the Chicxulub crater\nlifted about 100 trillion tons of dust into the atmosphere. We can determine this amount by measuring the\nthickness of the sediment layer that formed when this dust settled to the surface.\nFigure8.22Site of the Chicxulub Crater.This map shows the location of the impact crater created 65 million years ago on Mexico\u2019s 270 8 \u2022 Earth as a Planet\nYucat\u00e1n peninsula. The crater is now buried under more than 500 meters of sediment. (credit: modification of work by\n\u201cCarport\u201d/Wikimedia)\nSuch a quantity of airborne material would have blocked sunlight completely, plunging Earth into a period of\ncold and darkness that lasted several months. Many plants dependent on sunlight would have died, leaving\nplant-eating animals without a food supply. Other worldwide effects included large-scale fires (started by the\nhot, flying debris from the explosion) that destroyed much of the planet\u2019s forests and grasslands, and a long\nperiod in which rainwater around the globe was acidic. It was these environmental effects, rather than the\nexplosion itself, that were responsible for the mass extinction, including the demise of the dinosaurs.\nImpacts and the Evolution of Life\nIt is becoming clear that many\u2014perhaps most\u2014mass extinctions in Earth\u2019s long history resulted from a\nvariety of other causes, but in the case of the dinosaur killer, the cosmic impact certainly played a critical role\nand may have been the \u201cfinal straw\u201d in a series of climactic disturbances that resulted in the \u201cgreat dying.\u201d\nA catastrophe for one group of living things, however, may create opportunities for another group. Following\neach mass extinction, there is a sudden evolutionary burst as new species develop to fill the ecological niches\nopened by the event. Sixty-five million years ago, our ancestors, the mammals, began to thrive when so many\nother species died out. We are the lucky beneficiaries of this process.\nImpacts by comets and asteroids represent the only mechanisms we know of that could cause truly global\ncatastrophes and seriously influence the evolution of life all over the planet. As paleontologist Stephen Jay\nGould of Harvard noted, such a perspective changes fundamentally our view of biological evolution. The\ncentral issues for the survival of a species must now include more than just its success in competing with other\nspecies and adapting to slowly changing environments, as envisioned by Darwin\u2019s idea of natural selection.\nAlso required is an ability to survive random global catastrophes due to impacts.\nStill earlier in its history, Earth was subject to even larger impacts from the leftover debris of planet formation.\nWe know that the Moon was struck repeatedly by objects larger than 100 kilometers in diameter\u20141000 times\nmore massive than the object that wiped out most terrestrial life 65 million years ago. Earth must have\nexperienced similar large impacts during its first 700 million years of existence. Some of them were probably\nviolent enough to strip the planet of most its atmosphere and to boil away its oceans. Such events would\nsterilize the planet, destroying any life that had begun. Life may have formed and been wiped out several\ntimes before our own microbial ancestors took hold sometime about 4 billion years ago.\nThe fact that the oldest surviving microbes on Earth are thermophiles (adapted to very high temperatures) can\nalso be explained by such large impacts. An impact that was just a bit too small to sterilize the planet would\nstill have destroyed anything that lived in what we consider \u201cnormal\u201d environments, and only the creatures\nadapted to high temperatures would survive. Thus, the oldest surviving terrestrial lifeforms are probably the\nremnants of a sort of evolutionary bottleneck caused by repeated large impacts early in the planet\u2019s history.\nImpacts in Our Future?\nThe impacts by asteroids and comets that have had such a major influence on life are not necessarily a thing\nof the past. In the full scope of planetary history, 65 million years ago was just yesterday. Earth actually orbits\nthe Sun within a sort of cosmic shooting gallery, and although major impacts are rare, they are by no means\nover. Humanity could suffer the same fate as the dinosaurs, or lose a city to the much more frequent impacts\nlike the one over Tunguska, unless we figure out a way to predict the next big impact and to protect our\nplanet. The fact that our solar system is home to some very large planets in outer orbits may be beneficial to\nus; the gravitational fields of those planets can be very effective at pulling in cosmic debris and shielding us\nfrom larger, more frequent impacts.\nBeginning in the 1990s, a few astronomers began to analyze the cosmic impact hazard and to persuade the\ngovernment to support a search for potentially hazardous asteroids. Several small but sophisticated wide-field\ntelescopes are now used for this search, which is called the NASA Spaceguard Survey. Already we know that\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8.5 \u2022 Cosmic Influences on the Evolution of Earth 271\nthere are currently no asteroids on a collision course with Earth that are as big (10\u201315 kilometers) as the one\nthat killed the dinosaurs. The Spaceguard Survey now concentrates on finding smaller potential impactors. By\n2021, the search had netted more than 98 percent of the hazardous near-Earth asteroids larger than 1\nkilometer. The Spaceguard Survey will soon be augmented by the Vera Rubin Telescope that will scan the full\nsky on a regular basis, and an orbiting search telescope is under development by NASA. Of course, we cannot\nmake a similar statement about the asteroids that have not yet been discovered, but these will be found and\nevaluated one by one for their potential hazard. These asteroid surveys are one of the few really life-and-death\nprojects carried out by astronomers, with a potential to help to save our planet from future major impacts.\nScientists are now studying how we could protect ourselves from an impact if a large asteroid were discovered\non a collision course. The NASA spacecraft called DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test), launched in late\n2021, will demonstrate one example of such technology by crashing into the small asteroid Diomorphos to\nslightly alter its orbit.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTheTorino Impact Hazard Scale(https://openstax.org/l/30torhazscale)is a method for categorizing the\nimpact hazard associated with near-Earth objects such as asteroids and comets. It is a communication tool\nfor astronomers and the public to assess the seriousness of collision predictions by combining probability\nstatistics and known kinetic damage potentials into a single threat value.\nPurdue University\u2019s\u201cImpact: Earth\u201d calculator(https://openstax.org/l/30purimpearcal)lets you input the\ncharacteristics of an approaching asteroid to determine the effect of its impact on our planet. 272 8 \u2022 Key Terms\nKey Terms\nbar a force of 100,000 Newtons acting on a surface area of 1 square meter; the average pressure of Earth\u2019s\natmosphere at sea level is 1.013 bars\nbasalt igneous rock produced by the cooling of lava; makes up most of Earth\u2019s oceanic crust and is found on\nother planets that have experienced extensive volcanic activity\nconvection movement caused within a gas or liquid by the tendency of hotter, and therefore less dense\nmaterial, to rise and colder, denser material to sink under the influence of gravity, which consequently\nresults in transfer of heat\ncore the central part of the planet; consists of higher density material\ncrust the outer layer of a terrestrial planet\nfault in geology, a crack or break in the crust of a planet along which slippage or movement can take place,\naccompanied by seismic activity\ngranite a type of igneous silicate rock that makes up most of Earth\u2019s continental crust\ngreenhouse effect the blanketing (absorption) of infrared radiation near the surface of a planet\u2014for\nexample, by CO in its atmosphere\n2\ngreenhouse gas a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiation within the thermal infrared range;\non Earth, these atmospheric gases primarily include carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor\nigneous rock rock produced by cooling from a molten state\nmagnetosphere the region around a planet in which its intrinsic magnetic field dominates the interplanetary\nfield carried by the solar wind; hence, the region within which charged particles can be trapped by the\nplanetary magnetic field\nmantle the largest part of Earth\u2019s interior; lies between the crust and the core\nmass extinction the sudden disappearance in the fossil record of a large number of species of life, to be\nreplaced by fossils of new species in subsequent layers; mass extinctions are indicators of catastrophic\nchanges in the environment, such as might be produced by a large impact on Earth\nmetamorphic rock rock produced by physical and chemical alteration (without melting) under high\ntemperature and pressure\nozone (O ) a heavy molecule of oxygen that contains three atoms rather than the more normal two\n3\nphotosynthesis a complex sequence of chemical reactions through which some living things can use\nsunlight to manufacture products that store energy (such as carbohydrates), releasing oxygen as one by-\nproduct\nplate tectonics the motion of segments or plates of the outer layer of a planet over the underlying mantle\nprimitive rock rock that has not experienced great heat or pressure and therefore remains representative of\nthe original condensed materials from the solar nebula\nrift zone in geology, a place where the crust is being torn apart by internal forces generally associated with\nthe injection of new material from the mantle and with the slow separation of tectonic plates\nsedimentary rock rock formed by the deposition and cementing of fine grains of material, such as pieces of\nigneous rock or the shells of living things\nseismic wave a vibration that travels through the interior of Earth or any other object; on Earth, these are\ngenerally caused by earthquakes\nstratosphere the layer of Earth\u2019s atmosphere above the troposphere and below the ionosphere\nsubduction the sideways and downward movement of the edge of a plate of Earth\u2019s crust into the mantle\nbeneath another plate\ntroposphere the lowest level of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, where most weather takes place\nvolcano a place where material from a planet\u2019s mantle erupts on its surface\nAccess for free at openstax.org 8 \u2022 Summary 273\nSummary\n8.1The Global Perspective\nEarth is the prototype terrestrial planet. Its interior composition and structure are probed using seismic waves.\nSuch studies reveal that Earth has a metal core and a silicate mantle. The outer layer, or crust, consists\nprimarily of oceanic basalt and continental granite. A global magnetic field, generated in the core, produces\nEarth\u2019s magnetosphere, which can trap charged atomic particles.\n8.2Earth\u2019s Crust\nTerrestrial rocks can be classified as igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic. A fourth type, primitive rock, is\nnot found on Earth. Our planet\u2019s geology is dominated by plate tectonics, in which crustal plates move slowly\nin response to mantle convection. The surface expression of plate tectonics includes continental drift, recycling\nof the ocean floor, mountain building, rift zones, subduction zones, faults, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions\nof lava from the interior.\n8.3Earth\u2019s Atmosphere\nThe atmosphere has a surface pressure of 1 bar and is composed primarily of N and O , plus such important\n2 2\ntrace gases as H O, CO , and O . Its structure consists of the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and\n2 2 3\nionosphere. Changing the composition of the atmosphere also influences the temperature. Atmospheric\ncirculation (weather) is driven by seasonally changing deposition of sunlight. Many longer term climate\nvariations, such as the ice ages, are related to changes in the planet\u2019s orbit and axial tilt.\n8.4Life, Chemical Evolution, and Climate Change\nLife originated on Earth at a time when the atmosphere lacked O and consisted mostly of CO . Later,\n2 2\nphotosynthesis gave rise to free oxygen and ozone. Modern genomic analysis lets us see how the wide\ndiversity of species on the planet are related to each other. CO and methane in the atmosphere heat the\n2\nsurface through the greenhouse effect. Increasing amounts of atmospheric CO from burning of fossils fuels\n2\nand release of frozen methane are causing the global warming of our planet.\n8.5Cosmic Influences on the Evolution of Earth\nEarth, like the Moon and other planets, has been influenced by the impacts of cosmic debris, including such\nrecent examples as Meteor Crater and the Tunguska explosion. Larger past impacts are implicated in some\nmass extinctions, including the large impact 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period that\nwiped out the dinosaurs and many other species.

Europe and North America are moving apart by about 5 m per century. As the continents separate, new\nocean floor is created along the mid-Atlantic Rift. If the rift is 5000 km long, what is the total area of new\nocean floor created in the Atlantic each century? (Remember that 1 km = 1000 m.)\n25. Over the entire Earth, there are 60,000 km of active rift zones, with average separation rates of 5 m/\ncentury. How much area of new ocean crust is created each year over the entire planet? (This area is\napproximately equal to the amount of ocean crust that is subducted since the total area of the oceans\nremains about the same.)\n26. With the information fromExercise 8.25, you can calculate the average age of the ocean floor. First, find\nthe total area of the ocean floor (equal to about 60% of the surface area of Earth). Then compare this with\nthe area created (or destroyed) each year. The average lifetime is the ratio of these numbers: the total\narea of ocean crust compared to the amount created (or destroyed) each year.\n27. What is the volume of new oceanic basalt added to Earth\u2019s crust each year? Assume that the thickness of\nthe new crust is 5 km, that there are 60,000 km of rifts, and that the average speed of plate motion is\n4 cm/y. What fraction of Earth\u2019s entire volume does this annual addition of new material represent?\n28. Suppose a major impact that produces a mass extinction takes place on Earth once every 5 million years.\nSuppose further that if such an event occurred today, you and most other humans would be killed (this\nwould be true even if the human species as a whole survived). Such impact events are random, and one\ncould take place at any time. Calculate the probability that such an impact will occur within the next 50\nyears (within your lifetime).\n29. How do the risks of dying from the impact of an asteroid or comet compare with other risks we are\nconcerned about, such as dying in a car accident or from heart disease or some other natural cause?\n(Hint: To find the annual risk, go to the library or internet and look up the annual number of deaths from a\nparticular cause in a particular country, and then divide by the population of that country.)\n30.

What is it like to stand on the surface of our\nnatural satellite? And what can we learn from going there and bringing home pieces of a different world?\nWe begin our discussion of the planets as cratered worlds with two relatively simple objects: the Moon and\nMercury. Unlike Earth, the Moon is geologically dead, a place that has exhausted its internal energy sources.\nBecause its airless surface preserves events that happened long ago, the Moon provides a window on earlier\nepochs of solar system history. The planet Mercury is in many ways similar to the Moon, which is why the two\nare discussed together: both are relatively small, lacking in atmospheres, deficient in geological activity, and\ndominated by the effects of impact cratering. Still, the processes that have molded their surfaces are not\nunique to these two worlds. We shall see that they have acted on many other members of the planetary\nsystem as well. 280 9 \u2022 Cratered Worlds\n9.1 General Properties of the Moon\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDiscuss what has been learned from both manned and roboticlunar exploration\nDescribe the composition and structure of the Moon\nTheMoonhas only one-eightieth the mass of Earth and about one-sixth Earth\u2019s surface gravity\u2014too low to\nretain an atmosphere (Figure 9.2). Moving molecules of a gas can escape from a planet just the way a rocket\ndoes, and the lower the gravity, the easier it is for the gas to leak away into space. While the Moon can acquire\na temporary atmosphere from impacting comets, this atmosphere is quickly lost by freezing onto the surface\nor by escape to surrounding space. The Moon today is dramatically deficient in a wide range ofvolatiles, those\nelements and compounds that evaporate at relatively low temperatures. Some of theMoon\u2019s propertiesare\nsummarized inTable 9.1, along with comparative values forMercury.\nFigure9.2Two Sides of the Moon.The left image shows part of the hemisphere that faces Earth; several dark maria are visible.

Before the\nera of spacecraft studies, astronomers had mapped the side of the Moon that faces Earth with telescopic\nresolution of about 1 kilometer, but lunar geology hardly existed as a scientific subject. All that changed\nbeginning in the early 1960s. Initially, Russia took the lead in lunar exploration with Luna 3, which returned the\nfirst photos of the lunar far side in 1959, and then with Luna 9, which landed on the surface in 1966 and\ntransmitted pictures and other data to Earth. However, these efforts were overshadowed on July 20, 1969,\nwhen the first American astronaut set foot on the Moon.\nTable 9.2summarizes the nine Apollo flights: six that landed and three others that circled the Moon but did not\nland. The initial landings were on flat plains selected for safety reasons. But with increasing experience and\nconfidence, NASA targeted the last three missions to more geologically interesting locales. The level of\nscientific exploration also increased with each mission, as the astronauts spent longer times on the Moon and\ncarried more elaborate equipment. Finally, on the last Apollo landing, NASA included one scientist, geologist\nJack Schmitt, among the astronauts (Figure 9.3).\nApollo Flights to the Moon\nFlight Date Landing Site Main Accomplishment\nApollo8 Dec.1968 \u2014 First humans to fly around the Moon\nApollo10 May1969 \u2014 First spacecraft rendezvous in lunar orbit\nMare First human landing on the Moon; 22 kilograms of samples\nApollo11 July1969\nTranquillitatis returned\nOceanus First Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package (ALSEP); visit\nApollo12 Nov.1969\nProcellarum to Surveyor 3 lander\nApollo13 Apr.1970 \u2014 Landing aborted due to explosion in service module\nApollo14 Jan.1971 Mare Nubium First \u201crickshaw\u201d on the Moon\nMare Imbrium/ First \u201crover;\u201d visit to Hadley Rille; astronauts traveled 24\nApollo15 July1971\nHadley kilometers\nApollo16 Apr.1972 Descartes First landing in highlands; 95 kilograms of samples returned\nTable9.2 282 9 \u2022 Cratered Worlds\nFlight Date Landing Site Main Accomplishment\nTaurus-Littrow Geologist among the crew; 111 kilograms of samples\nApollo17 Dec.1972\nhighlands returned\nTable9.2\nFigure9.3Scientist on the Moon.Geologist (and later US senator) Harrison \u201cJack\u201dSchmittin front of a large boulder in the Littrow\nValley at the edge of the lunar highlands. Note how black the sky is on the airless Moon. No stars are visible because the surface is\nbrightly lit by the Sun, and the exposure therefore is not long enough to reveal stars.\nIn addition to landing on the lunar surface and studying it at close range, the Apollo missions accomplished\nthree objectives of major importance for lunar science. First, the astronauts collected nearly 400 kilograms of\nsamples for detailed laboratory analysis on Earth (Figure 9.4). These samples have revealed as much about the\nMoon and its history as all other lunar studies combined. Second, each Apollo landing after the first one\ndeployed an Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package (ALSEP), which continued to operate for years after the\nastronauts departed. Third, the orbiting Apollo command modules carried a wide range of instruments to\nphotograph and analyze the lunar surface from above.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 9.1 \u2022 General Properties of the Moon 283\nFigure9.4Handling Moon Rocks.Lunar samples collected in the Apollo Project are analyzed and stored in NASA facilities at the\nJohnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.

(credit: NASA JSC)\nThe last human left the Moon in December 1972, just a little more than three years after Neil Armstrong took\nhis \u201cgiant leap for mankind.\u201d The program of lunar exploration was cut off midstride due to political and\neconomic pressures. It had cost just about $100 per American, spread over 10 years\u2014the equivalent of one\nlarge pizza per person per year. Yet for many people, the Moon landings were one of the central events in\ntwentieth-century history.\nThe giant Apollo rockets built to travel to the Moon were left to rust on the lawns of NASA centers in Florida,\nTexas, and Alabama, although recently, some have at least been moved indoors to museums (Figure 9.5). It is\nmore than 50 years since astronauts landed on the Moon, and there are no firm plans for future flights.\nHowever, both the United States and China are developing the capability to land on the Moon, and there may\nbe a new \u201cspace race\u201d in the late 2020s. (In a bizarre piece of irony, a few people even question whether we\nwent to the Moon at all, proposing instead that the Apollo program was a fake, filmed on a Hollywood sound\nstage. See theLink to Learningbox below for some scientists\u2019 replies to such claims.) However, scientific\ninterest in the Moon is stronger than ever, and more than half a dozen scientific spacecraft\u2014sent from NASA,\nESA, Japan, India, and China\u2014have orbited or landed on our nearest neighbor during the past two decades.x\nLINK TO LEARNING\nReadThe Great Moon Hoax(https://openstax.org/l/30greatmoonhoax)about the claim that NASA never\nsucceeded in putting people on the Moon. 284 9 \u2022 Cratered Worlds\nFigure9.5Moon Rocket on Display.One of the unused Saturn 5 rockets built to go to the Moon is now a tourist attraction at\nNASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in Houston, although it has been moved indoors since this photo was taken.

With an average density of only 3.3 g/cm3, the\nMoon must be made almost entirely of silicate rock. Compared to Earth, it is depleted in iron and other metals.\nIt is as if the Moon were composed of the same silicates as Earth\u2019s mantle and crust, with the metals and the\nvolatiles selectively removed. These differences in composition between Earth and Moon provide important\nclues about the origin of the Moon, a topic we will cover in detail later in this chapter.\nStudies of theMoon\u2019s interiorcarried out with seismometers taken to the Moon as part of the Apollo program\nconfirm the absence of a large metal core. The twin GRAIL spacecraft launched into lunar orbit in 2011\nprovided even more precise tracking of the interior structure. We also know from the study of lunar samples\nthat water and other volatiles have been depleted from the lunar crust. The tiny amounts of water detected in\nthese samples were originally attributed to small leaks in the container seal that admitted water vapor from\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere. However, scientists have now concluded that some chemically bound water is present in\nthe lunar rocks.\nMost dramatically, water ice has been detected in permanently shadowed craters near the lunar poles. In\n2009, NASA crashed a small spacecraft called the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) into\nthe crater Cabeus near the Moon\u2019s south pole. The impact at 9,000 kilometers per hour released energy\nequivalent to 2 tons of dynamite, blasting a plume of water vapor and other chemicals high above the surface.\nThis plume was visible to telescopes in orbit around the Moon, and the LCROSS spacecraft itself made\nmeasurements as it flew through the plume. A NASA spacecraft called the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)\nalso measured the very low temperatures inside several lunar craters, and its sensitive cameras were even\nable to image crater interiors by starlight.\nThe total quantity of water ice in the Moon\u2019s polar craters is estimated to be hundreds of billions of tons. As\nliquid, this would only be enough water to fill a lake 100 miles across, but compared with the rest of the dry\nlunar crust, so much water is remarkable. Presumably, this polar water was carried to the Moon by comets and\nasteroids that hit its surface. Some small fraction of the water froze in a few extremely cold regions (cold traps)\nwhere the Sun never shines, such as the bottom of deep craters at the Moon\u2019s poles. One reason this\ndiscovery could be important is that it raises the possibility of future human habitation near the lunar poles, or\neven of a lunar base as a way-station on routes to Mars and the rest of the solar system. If the ice could be\nmined, it would yield both water and oxygen for human support, and it could be broken down into hydrogen\nand oxygen, a potent rocket fuel. 286 9 \u2022 Cratered Worlds\n9.2 The Lunar Surface\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDifferentiate between the major surface features of the Moon\nDescribe the history of the lunar surface\nDescribe the properties of the lunar \u201csoil\u201d\nGeneral Appearance\nIf you look at theMoonthrough a telescope, you can see that it is covered by impact craters of all sizes. The\nmost conspicuous of theMoon\u2019s surfacefeatures\u2014those that can be seen with the unaided eye and that make\nup the feature often called \u201cthe man in the Moon\u201d\u2014are vast splotches of darker lava flows.\nCenturies ago, early lunar observers thought that the Moon had continents and oceans and that it was a\npossible abode of life. They called the dark areas \u201cseas\u201d (mariain Latin, ormarein the singular, pronounced\n\u201cmah ray\u201d). Their names, Mare Nubium (Sea of Clouds), Mare Tranquillitatis (Sea of Tranquility), and so on, are\nstill in use today. In contrast, the \u201cland\u201d areas between the seas are not named. Thousands of individual\ncraters have been named, however, mostly for great scientists and philosophers (Figure 9.6). Among the most\nprominent craters are those named for Plato, Copernicus, Tycho, and Kepler. Galileo only has a small crater,\nhowever, reflecting his low standing among the Vatican scientists who made some of the first lunar maps.\nWe know today that the resemblance of lunar features to terrestrial ones is superficial. Even when they look\nsomewhat similar, the origins of lunar features such as craters and mountains are very different from their\nterrestrial counterparts. The Moon\u2019s relative lack of internal activity, together with the absence of air and\nwater, make most of its geological history unlike anything we know on Earth.\nFigure9.6Sunrise on the Central Mountain Peaks of Tycho Crater, as Imaged by the NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.\nTycho, about 82 kilometers in diameter, is one of the youngest of the very large lunar craters. The central mountain rises 2\nkilometers above the crater floor. (credit: modification of work by NASA/Goddard/Arizona State University)\nLunar History\nTo trace the detailed history of the Moon or of any planet, we must be able to estimate the ages of individual\nrocks. Once lunar samples were brought back by the Apollo astronauts, the radioactive dating techniques that\nhad been developed for Earth were applied to them. The solidification ages of the samples ranged from about\n3.3 to 4.4 billion years old, substantially older than most of the rocks on Earth. For comparison, as we saw in\nthe chapter onEarth, Moon, and Sky, both Earth and the Moon were formed between 4.5 and 4.6 billion years\nago.\nMost of the crust of the Moon (83%) consists of silicate rocks calledanorthosites; these regions are known as\nAccess for free at openstax.org 9.2 \u2022 The Lunar Surface 287\nthe lunarhighlands. They are made of relatively low-density rock that solidified on the cooling Moon like slag\nfloating on the top of a smelter. Because they formed so early inlunar history(between 4.1 and 4.4 billion\nyears ago), the highlands are also extremely heavily cratered, bearing the scars of all those billions of years of\nimpacts by interplanetary debris (Figure 9.7).\nFigure9.7Lunar Highlands.The old, heavily cratered lunar highlands make up 83% of the Moon\u2019s surface. (credit: Apollo 11 Crew,\nNASA)\nUnlike the mountains on Earth, theMoon\u2019s highlandsdo not have any sharp folds in their ranges. The\nhighlands have low, rounded profiles that resemble the oldest, most eroded mountains on Earth (Figure 9.8).\nBecause there is no atmosphere or water on the Moon, there has been no wind, water, or ice to carve them\ninto cliffs and sharp peaks, the way we have seen them shaped on Earth. Their smooth features are attributed\nto gradual erosion, mostly due to impact cratering.\nFigure9.8Lunar Mountain.This photo of Mt. Hadley on the edge of Mare Imbrium was taken by DaveScott, one of the Apollo 15\nastronauts. Note the smooth contours of the lunar mountains, which have not been sculpted by water or ice. (credit: NASA/Apollo\nLunar Surface Journal) 288 9 \u2022 Cratered Worlds\nThe maria are much less cratered than the highlands, and cover just 17% of the lunar surface, mostly on the\nside of the Moon that faces Earth (Figure 9.9).\nFigure9.9Lunar Maria.About 17% of the Moon\u2019s surface consists of the maria\u2014flat plains of basaltic lava. This view of Mare\nImbrium also shows numerous secondary craters and evidence of material ejected from the large crater Copernicus on the upper\nhorizon. Copernicus is an impact crater almost 100 kilometers in diameter that was formed long after the lava in Imbrium had\nalready been deposited. (credit: NASA, Apollo 17)\nToday, we know that the maria consist mostly of dark-colored basalt (volcanic lava) laid down in volcanic\neruptions billions of years ago. Eventually, these lava flows partly filled the huge depressions calledimpact\nbasins, which had been produced by collisions of large chunks of material with the Moon relatively early in its\nhistory. The basalt on the Moon (Figure 9.10) is very similar in composition to the crust under the oceans of\nEarth or to the lavas erupted by many terrestrial volcanoes. The youngest of the lunar impact basins is Mare\nOrientale, shown inFigure 9.11.\nFigure9.10Rock from a Lunar Mare.In this sample of basalt from the mare surface, you can see the holes left by gas bubbles,\nwhich are characteristic of rock formed from lava.

Its outer ring is\nabout 1000 kilometers in diameter, roughly the distance between New York City and Detroit, Michigan. Unlike most of the other\nbasins, Orientale has not been completely filled in with lava flows, so it retains its striking \u201cbull\u2019s-eye\u201d appearance. It is located on\nthe edge of the Moon as seen from Earth. (credit: NASA)\nVolcanic activity may have begun very early in the Moon\u2019s history, although most evidence of the first half\nbillion years is lost. What we do know is that the major mare volcanism, which involved the release of lava from\nhundreds of kilometers below the surface, ended about 3.3 billion years ago. After that, the Moon\u2019s interior\ncooled, and volcanic activity was limited to a very few small areas. The primary forces altering the surface\ncome from the outside, not the interior.\nOn the Lunar Surface\n\u201cThe surface is fine and powdery. I can pick it up loosely with my toe. But I can see the footprints of my boots\nand the treads in the fine sandy particles.\u201d\u2014NeilArmstrong, Apollo 11 astronaut, immediately after stepping\nonto the Moon for the first time.\nThe surface of the Moon is buried under a fine-grained soil of tiny, shattered rock fragments. The dark basaltic\ndust of the lunar maria was kicked up by every astronaut footstep, and thus eventually worked its way into all\nof the astronauts\u2019 equipment. The upper layers of the surface are porous, consisting of loosely packed dust\ninto which their boots sank several centimeters (Figure 9.12). This lunar dust, like so much else on the Moon, is\nthe product of impacts. Each cratering event, large or small, breaks up the rock of the lunar surface and\nscatters the fragments. Ultimately, billions of years of impacts have reduced much of the surface layer to\nparticles about the size of dust or sand. 290 9 \u2022 Cratered Worlds\nFigure9.12Footprint on Moon Dust.Apollo photo of an astronaut\u2019s boot print in the lunar soil. (credit: NASA)\nIn the absence of any air, the lunar surface experiences much greater temperature extremes than the surface\nof Earth, even though Earth is virtually the same distance from the Sun. Near local noon, when the Sun is\nhighest in the sky, the temperature of the dark lunar soil rises above the boiling point of water. During the\n1\nlong lunar night (which, like the lunar day, lasts two Earth weeks ), the temperature drops to about 100 K\n(\u2013173 \u00b0C). The extreme cooling is a result not only of the absence of air but also of the porous nature of the\nMoon\u2019s dusty soil, which cools more rapidly than solid rock would.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nLearn how the moon\u2019s craters and maria were formed by watching avideo produced by NASA\u2019s Lunar\nReconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) team(https://openstax.org/l/30mooncratersfo)about the evolution of the\nMoon, tracing it from its origin about 4.5 billion years ago to the Moon we see today. See a simulation of\nhow the Moon\u2019s craters and maria were formed through periods of impact, volcanic activity, and heavy\nbombardment.\n9.3 Impact Craters\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nCompare and contrast ideas about how lunar craters form\nExplain the process of impact crater formation\nDiscuss the use ofcrater countsto determine relative ages of lunar landforms\nVolcanic Versus Impact Origin of Craters\nTheMoonprovides an important benchmark for understanding the history of our planetary system. Most solid\nworlds show the effects of impacts, often extending back to the era when a great deal of debris from our\nsystem\u2019s formation process was still present. On Earth, this long history has been erased by our active\ngeology. On the Moon, in contrast, most of the impact history is preserved. If we can understand what has\nhappened on the Moon, we may be able to apply this knowledge to other worlds. The Moon is especially\ninteresting because it is not just any moon, butourMoon\u2014a nearby world that has shared the history of Earth\n1 You can see the cycle of day and night on the side of the Moon facing us in the form of the Moon\u2019s phases. It takes about 14 days\nfor the side of the Moon facing us to go from full moon (all lit up) to new moon (all dark). There is more on this inChapter 4: Earth,\nMoon, and Sky.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 9.3 \u2022 Impact Craters 291\nfor more than 4 billion years and preserved a record that, for Earth, has been destroyed by our active geology.\nUntil the middle of the twentieth century, scientists did not generally recognize that lunarcraters were the\nresult of impacts. Sinceimpact cratersare extremely rare on Earth, geologists did not expect them to be the\nmajor feature of lunar geology. They reasoned (perhaps unconsciously) that since the craters we have on\nEarth are volcanic, the lunar craters must have a similar origin.\nOne of the first geologists to propose that lunar craters were the result of impacts was Grove K.Gilbert, a\nscientist with the US Geological Survey in the 1890s. He pointed out that the large lunar craters\u2014mountain-\nrimmed, circular features with floors generally below the level of the surrounding plains\u2014are larger and have\ndifferent shapes from known volcanic craters on Earth. Terrestrial volcanic craters are smaller and deeper and\nalmost always occur at the tops of volcanic mountains (Figure 9.13). The only alternative to explain the Moon\u2019s\ncraters was an impact origin. His careful reasoning, although not accepted at the time, laid the foundations for\nthe modern science of lunar geology.\nFigure9.13Volcanic and Impact Craters.Profiles of a typical terrestrial volcanic crater and a typical lunar impact crater are quite\ndifferent.\nGilbert concluded that the lunar craters were produced by impacts, but he didn\u2019t understand why all of them\nwere circular and not oval. The reason lies in the escape velocity, the minimum speed that a body must reach\nto permanently break away from the gravity of another body; it is also the minimum speed that a projectile\napproaching Earth or the Moon will hit with. Attracted by the gravity of the larger body, the incoming chunk\nstrikes with at least escape velocity, which is 11 kilometers per second for Earth and 2.4 kilometers per second\n(5400 miles per hour) for the Moon. To this escape velocity is added whatever speed the projectile already had\nwith respect to Earth or Moon, typically 10 kilometers per second or more.\nAt these speeds, the energy of impact produces a violentexplosionthat excavates a large volume of material\nin a symmetrical way. Photographs of bomb and shell craters on Earth confirm that explosion craters are\nalways essentially circular. Only following World War I did scientists recognize the similarity between impact\ncraters and explosion craters, but, sadly, Gilbert did not live to see his impact hypothesis widely accepted.\nThe Cratering Process\nLet\u2019s consider how an impact at these high speeds produces a crater. When such a fast projectile strikes a\nplanet, it penetrates two or three times its own diameter before stopping. During these few seconds, its\nenergy of motion is transferred into a shock wave (which spreads through the target body) and into heat\n(which vaporizes most of the projectile and some of the surrounding target). The shock wave fractures the\nrock of the target, while the expanding silicate vapor generates an explosion similar to that of a nuclear bomb\ndetonated at ground level (Figure 9.14). The size of the excavated crater depends primarily on the speed of\nimpact, but generally it is 10 to 15 times the diameter of the projectile. 292 9 \u2022 Cratered Worlds\nFigure9.14Stages in the Formation of an Impact Crater.(a) The impact occurs. (b) The projectile vaporizes and a shock wave\nspreads through the lunar rock. (c) Ejecta are thrown out of the crater. (d) Most of the ejected material falls back to fill the crater, but\nsome of it is found outside the crater in the form of an ejecta blanket.\nAn impact explosion of the sort described above leads to a characteristic kind ofcrater, as shown inFigure\n9.15. The central cavity is initially bowl-shaped (the word \u201ccrater\u201d comes from the Greek word for \u201cbowl\u201d), but\nthe rebound of the crust partially fills it in, producing a flat floor and sometimes creating a central peak.\nAround the rim, landslides create a series of terraces.\nFigure9.15Typical Impact Crater.King Crater on the far side of the Moon, a fairly recent lunar crater 75 kilometers in diameter,\nshows most of the features associated with large impact structures. (credit: NASA/JSC/Arizona State University)\nThe rim of the crater is turned up by the force of the explosion, so it rises above both the floor and the\nadjacent terrain. Surrounding the rim is anejecta blanketconsisting of material thrown out by the explosion.\nThis debris falls back to create a rough, hilly region, typically about as wide as the crater diameter. Additional,\nhigher-speed ejecta fall at greater distances from the crater, often digging smallsecondary craterswhere they\nstrike the surface (Figure 9.9).\nSome of these streams of ejecta can extend for hundreds or even thousands of kilometers from the crater,\ncreating the brightcrater raysthat are prominent in lunar photos taken near full phase. The brightest lunar\ncrater rays are associated with large young craters such as Kepler and Tycho.\nSEEING FOR YOURSELF\nObserving the Moon\nThe Moon is one of the most beautiful sights in the sky, and it is the only object close enough to reveal its\ntopography(surface features such as mountains and valleys) without a visit from a spacecraft. A fairly small\namateur telescope easily shows craters and mountains on the Moon as small as a few kilometers across.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 9.3 \u2022 Impact Craters 293\nEven as seen through a good pair of binoculars, we can observe that the appearance of the Moon\u2019s surface\nchanges dramatically with its phase. At full phase, it shows almost no topographic detail, and you must look\nclosely to see more than a few craters. This is because sunlight illuminates the surface straight on, and in\nthis flat lighting, no shadows are cast. Much more revealing is the view near first or third quarter, when\nsunlight streams in from the side, causing topographic features to cast sharp shadows. It is almost always\nmore rewarding to study a planetary surface under such oblique lighting, when the maximum information\nabout surface relief can be obtained.\nThe flat lighting at full phase does, however, accentuate brightness contrasts on the Moon, such as those\nbetween the maria and highlands. Notice inFigure 9.16that several of the large mare craters seem to be\nsurrounded by white material and that the light streaks or rays that can stretch for hundreds of kilometers\nacross the surface are clearly visible. These lighter features are ejecta, splashed out from the crater-forming\nimpact.\nFigure9.16Appearance of the Moon at Different Phases.(a) Illumination from the side brings craters and other topographic\nfeatures into sharp relief, as seen on the far left side. (b) At full phase, there are no shadows, and it is more difficult to see such\nfeatures. However, the flat lighting at full phase brings out some surface features, such as the bright rays of ejecta that stretch\nout from a few large young craters. (credit: modification of work by Luc Viatour)\nBy the way, there is no danger in looking at the Moon with binoculars or telescopes. The reflected sunlight\nis never bright enough to harm your eyes. In fact, the sunlit surface of the Moon has about the same\nbrightness as a sunlit landscape of dark rock on Earth. Although the Moon looks bright in the night sky, its\nsurface is, on average, much less reflective than Earth\u2019s, with its atmosphere and white clouds. This\ndifference is nicely illustrated by the photo of the Moon passing in front of Earth taken from the Deep Space\nClimate Observatory spacecraft (Figure 9.17). Since the spacecraft took the image from a position inside the\norbit of Earth, we see both objects fully illuminated (full Moon and full Earth). By the way, you cannot see\nmuch detail on the Moon because the exposure has been set to give a bright image of Earth, not the Moon. 294 9 \u2022 Cratered Worlds\nFigure9.17The Moon Crossing the Face of Earth.In this 2015 image from the Deep Space Climate Observatory spacecraft,\nboth objects are fully illuminated, but the Moon looks darker because it has a much lower average reflectivity than Earth. (credit:\nmodification of work by NASA, DSCOVR EPIC team)\nOne interesting thing about the Moon that you can see without binoculars or telescopes is popularly called\n\u201cthe new Moon in the old Moon\u2019s arms.\u201d Look at the Moon when it is a thin crescent, and you can often\nmake out the faint circle of the entire lunar disk, even though the sunlight shines on only the crescent. The\nrest of the disk is illuminated not by sunlight but by earthlight\u2014sunlight reflected from Earth. The light of\nthe full Earth on the Moon is about 50 times brighter than that of the full Moon shining on Earth.\nUsing Crater Counts\nIf a world has had little erosion or internal activity, like the Moon during the past 3 billion years, it is possible to\nuse the number ofimpact craterson its surface to estimate the age of that surface. By \u201cage\u201d here we mean\nthe time since a major disturbance occurred on that surface (such as the volcanic eruptions that produced the\nlunar maria).\nWe cannot directly measure the rate at which craters are being formed on Earth and the Moon, since the\naverage interval between large crater-forming impacts is longer than the entire span of human history. Our\nbest-known example of such a large crater, Meteor Crater in Arizona (Figure 9.18), is about 50,000 years old.\nHowever, the cratering rate can be estimated from the number of craters on the lunar maria or calculated\nfrom the number of potential \u201cprojectiles\u201d (asteroids and comets) present in the solar system today. Both lines\nof reasoning lead to about the same estimations.\nFigure9.18Meteor Crater.This aerial photo ofMeteor Craterin Arizona shows the simple form of a meteorite impact crater. The\nAccess for free at openstax.org 9.3 \u2022 Impact Craters 295\ncrater\u2019s rim diameter is about 1.2 kilometers. (credit: Shane Torgerson)\nFor the Moon, these calculations indicate that a crater 1 kilometer in diameter should be produced about every\n200,000 years, a 10-kilometer crater every few million years, and one or two 100-kilometer craters every billion\nyears. If the cratering rate has stayed the same, we can figure out how long it must have taken to make all the\ncraters we see in the lunar maria. Our calculations show that it would have taken several billion years. This\nresult is similar to the age determined for the maria from radioactive dating of returned samples\u20143.3 to 3.8\nbillion years old.\nThe fact that these two calculations agree suggests that astronomers\u2019 original assumption was right: comets\nand asteroids in approximately their current numbers have been impacting planetary surfaces for billions of\nyears. Calculations carried out for other planets (and their moons) indicate that they also have been subject to\nabout the same number of interplanetary impacts during this time.\nWe have good reason to believe, however, that earlier than 3.8 billion years ago, the impact rates must have\nbeen a great deal higher. This becomes immediately evident when comparing the numbers of craters on the\nlunar highlands with those on the maria. Typically, there are 10 times more craters on the highlands than on a\nsimilar area of maria. Yet the radioactive dating of highland samples showed that they are only a little older\nthan the maria, typically 4.2 billion years rather than 3.8 billion years. If the rate of impacts had been constant\nthroughout the Moon\u2019s history, the highlands would have had to be at least 10 times older. They would thus\nhave had to form 38 billion years ago\u2014long before the universe itself began.\nIn science, when an assumption leads to an implausible conclusion, we must go back and re-examine that\nassumption\u2014in this case, the constant impact rate. The contradiction is resolved if the impact rate varied over\ntime, with a much heavier bombardment earlier than 3.8 billion years ago (Figure 9.19). This \u201cheavy\nbombardment\u201d produced most of the craters we see today in the highlands.\nFigure9.19Cratering Rates over Time.The number of craters being made on the Moon\u2019s surface has varied with time over the\npast 4.3 billion years.\nThis idea we have been exploring\u2014that large impacts (especially during the early history of the solar system)\nplayed a major role in shaping the worlds we see\u2014is not unique to our study of the Moon. As you read\nthrough the other chapters about the planets, you will see further indications that a number of the present-\nday characteristics of our system may be due to its violent past. 296 9 \u2022 Cratered Worlds\n9.4 The Origin of the Moon\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the top three early hypotheses of the formation of the Moon\nSummarize the current \u201cgiant impact\u201d concept of how the Moon formed\nIdeas for the Origin of the Moon\nIt is characteristic of modern science to ask how things originated. Understanding the origin of theMoonhas\nproven to be challenging for planetary scientists, however. Part of the difficulty is simply that we know so\nmuch about the Moon (quite the opposite of our usual problem in astronomy). As we will see, one key problem\nis that the Moon is both tantalizingly similar to Earth and frustratingly different.\nMost of the earlier hypotheses for theMoon\u2019s originfollowed one of three general ideas:\n1. The fission theory\u2014the Moon was once part of Earth, but somehow separated from it early in their\nhistory.\n2. The sister theory\u2014the Moon formed together with (but independent of) Earth, as we believe many moons\nof the outer planets formed.\n3. The capture theory\u2014the Moon formed elsewhere in the solar system and was captured by Earth.\nUnfortunately, there seem to be fundamental problems with each of these ideas. Perhaps the easiest\nhypothesis to reject is the capture theory. Its primary drawback is that no one knows of any way that early\nEarth could have captured such a large moon from elsewhere. One body approaching another cannot go into\norbit around it without a substantial loss of energy; this is the reason that spacecraft destined to orbit other\nplanets are equipped with retro-rockets. Furthermore, if such a capture did take place, the captured object\nwould go into a very eccentric orbit rather than the nearly circular orbit our Moon occupies today. Finally,\nthere are too many compositional similarities between Earth and the Moon, particularly an identical fraction of\n2\nthe major isotopes of oxygen, to justify seeking a completely independent origin.\nThe fission hypothesis, which states that the Moon separated from Earth, was suggested in the late nineteenth\ncentury. Modern calculations have shown that this sort of spontaneous fission or splitting is impossible.\nFurthermore, it is difficult to understand how a Moon made out of terrestrial material in this way could have\ndeveloped the many distinctive chemical differences now known to characterize our neighbor.\nScientists were therefore left with the sister hypothesis\u2014that the Moon formed alongside Earth\u2014or with some\nmodification of the fission hypothesis that can find a more acceptable way for the lunar material to have\nseparated from Earth. But the more we learned about our Moon, the less these old ideas seem to fit the bill.\nThe Giant Impact Hypothesis\nIn an effort to resolve these apparent contradictions, scientists developed a fourth hypothesis for the origin of\nthe Moon, one that involves a giant impact early in Earth\u2019s history. There is increasing evidence that large\nchunks of material\u2014objects of essentially planetary mass\u2014were orbiting in the inner solar system at the time\nthat the terrestrial planets formed. Thegiant impact hypothesisenvisions Earth being struck obliquely by an\nobject approximately one-tenth Earth\u2019s mass\u2014a \u201cbullet\u201d about the size of Mars. This is very nearly the largest\nimpact Earth could experience without being shattered.\nSuch an impact would disrupt much of Earth and eject a vast amount of material into space, releasing almost\nenough energy to break the planet apart. Computer simulations indicate that material totaling several percent\nof Earth\u2019s mass could be ejected in such an impact. Most of this material would be from the stony mantles of\n2 Remember from theRadiation and Spectrachapter that the term isotope means a different \u201cversion\u201d of an element. Specifically,\ndifferent isotopes of the same element have equal numbers of protons but different numbers of neutrons (as in carbon-12 versus\ncarbon-14.)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 9.5 \u2022 Mercury 297\nEarth and the impacting body, not from their metal cores. This ejected rock vapor then cooled and formed a\nring of material orbiting Earth. It was this ring that ultimately condensed into the Moon.\nWhile we do not have any current way of showing that the giant impact hypothesis is the correct model of the\nMoon\u2019s origin, it does offer potential solutions to most of the major problems raised by the chemistry of the\nMoon. First, since the Moon\u2019s raw material is derived from the mantles of Earth and the projectile, the absence\nof metals is easily understood. Second, most of the volatile elements would have been lost during the high-\ntemperature phase following the impact, explaining the lack of these materials on the Moon. Yet, by making\nthe Moon primarily of terrestrial mantle material, it is also possible to understand similarities such as identical\nabundances of various oxygen isotopes.\n9.5 Mercury\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nCharacterize the orbit of Mercury around the Sun\nDescribe Mercury\u2019s structure and composition\nExplain the relationship between Mercury\u2019s orbit and rotation\nDescribe the topography and features of Mercury\u2019s surface\nSummarize our ideas about the origin and evolution of Mercury\nMercury\u2019s Orbit\nThe planetMercuryis similar to the Moon in many ways. Like the Moon, it has no atmosphere, and its surface\nis heavily cratered. As described later in this chapter, it also shares with the Moon the likelihood of a violent\nbirth.\nMercury is the nearest planet to the Sun, and, in accordance with Kepler\u2019s third law, it has the shortest period\nof revolution about the Sun (88 of our days) and the highest average orbital speed (48 kilometers per second).\nIt is appropriately named for the fleet-footed messenger god of the Romans. Because Mercury remains close\nto the Sun, it can be difficult to pick out in the sky. As you might expect, it\u2019s best seen when its eccentric orbit\ntakes it as far from the Sun as possible.\nThe semimajor axis ofMercury\u2019s orbit\u2014that is, the planet\u2019s average distance from the Sun\u2014is 58 million\nkilometers, or 0.39 AU. However, because its orbit has the high eccentricity of 0.206, Mercury\u2019s actual distance\nfrom the Sun varies from 46 million kilometers at perihelion to 70 million kilometers at aphelion (the ideas and\nterms that describe orbits were introduced inOrbits and Gravity).\nComposition and Structure\nMercury\u2019s mass is one-eighteenth that of Earth, making it the smallest terrestrial planet. Mercury is the\nsmallest planet (except for the dwarf planets), having a diameter of 4878 kilometers, less than half that of\nEarth. Mercury\u2019s density is 5.4 g/cm3, much greater than the density of the Moon, indicating that the\ncomposition of those two objects differs substantially.\nMercury\u2019s compositionis one of the most interesting things about it and makes it unique among the planets.\nMercury\u2019s high density tells us that it must be composed largely of heavier materials such as metals. The most\nlikely models for Mercury\u2019s interior suggest a metallic iron-nickel core amounting to 60% of the total mass,\nwith the rest of the planet made up primarily of silicates. The core has a diameter of 3500 kilometers and\nextends out to within 700 kilometers of the surface. We could think of Mercury as a metal ball the size of the\nMoon surrounded by a rocky crust 700 kilometers thick (Figure 9.20). Unlike the Moon, Mercury does have a\nweak magnetic field. The existence of this field is consistent with the presence of a large metal core, and it\n3\nsuggests that at least part of the core must be liquid in order to generate the observed magnetic field. 298 9 \u2022 Cratered Worlds\nFigure9.20Mercury\u2019s Internal Structure.The interior of Mercury is dominated by a metallic core about the same size as our\nMoon.\nEXAMPLE 9.1\nDensities of Worlds\nThe average density of a body equals its mass divided by its volume. For a sphere, density is:\nAstronomers can measure both mass and radius accurately when a spacecraft flies by a body.\nUsing the information in this chapter, we can calculate the approximate average density of the Moon.\nSolution\nFor a sphere,\nTable 9.1gives a value of 3.3 g/cm3, which is 3.3 \u00d7 103kg/m3.\nCheck Your Learning\nUsing the information in this chapter, calculate the average density of Mercury. Show your work. Does your\ncalculation agree with the figure we give in this chapter?\nAnswer:\nThat matches the value given inTable 9.1when g/cm3is converted into kg/m3.\nMercury\u2019s Strange Rotation\nVisual studies ofMercury\u2019s indistinct surface markings were once thought to indicate that the planet kept one\nface to the Sun (as the Moon does to Earth). Thus, for many years, it was widely believed thatMercury\u2019s\nrotationperiod was equal to its revolution period of 88 days, making one side perpetually hot while the other\n3 Recall from theRadiation and Spectrachapter that magnetism is an effect of moving electric charges. In atoms of metals, the\nouter electrons are easier to dislodge and they can form a current when the metal is in liquid form and can flow.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 9.5 \u2022 Mercury 299\nwas always cold.\nRadar observations of Mercury in the mid-1960s, however, showed conclusively that Mercury does not keep\none side fixed toward the Sun. If a planet is turning, one side seems to be approaching Earth while the other is\nmoving away from it. The resulting Doppler shift spreads or broadens the precise transmitted radar-wave\nfrequency into a range of frequencies in the reflected signal (Figure 9.21). The degree of broadening provides\nan exact measurement of the rotation rate of the planet.\nFigure9.21Doppler Radar Measures Rotation.When a radar beam is reflected from a rotating planet, the motion of one side of\nthe planet\u2019s disk toward us and the other side away from us causes Doppler shifts in the reflected signal. The effect is to cause both\na redshift and a blueshift, widening the spread of frequencies in the radio beam.\nMercury\u2019s period of rotation (how long it takes to turn with respect to the distant stars) is 59 days, which is just\ntwo-thirds of the planet\u2019s period of revolution. Subsequently, astronomers found that a situation where the\nspin and the orbit of a planet (its year) are in a 2:3 ratio turns out to be stable. (SeeWhat a Difference a Day\nMakesfor more on the effects of having such a long day on Mercury.)\nMercury, being close to the Sun, is very hot on its daylight side; but because it has no appreciable atmosphere,\nit gets surprisingly cold during the long nights. The temperature on the surface climbs to 700 K (430 \u00b0C) at\nnoontime. After sunset, however, the temperature drops, reaching 100 K (\u2013170 \u00b0C) just before dawn. (It is even\ncolder in craters near the poles that receive no sunlight at all.) The range in temperature on Mercury is thus\n600 K (or 600 \u00b0C), a greater difference than on any other planet.\nMAKING CONNECTIONS\nWhat a Difference a Day Makes\nMercury rotates three times for each two orbits around the Sun. It is the only planet that exhibits this\nrelationship between its spin and its orbit, and there are some interesting consequences for any observers\nwho might someday be stationed on the surface of Mercury.\nHere on Earth, we take for granted that days are much shorter than years. Therefore, the two astronomical\nways of defining the local \u201cday\u201d\u2014how long the planet takes to rotate and how long the Sun takes to return\nto the same position in the sky\u2014are the same on Earth for most practical purposes. But this is not the case\non Mercury. While Mercury rotates (spins once) in 59 Earth days, the time for the Sun to return to the same\nplace in Mercury\u2019s sky turns out to be two Mercury years, or 176 Earth days. (Note that this result is not 300 9 \u2022 Cratered Worlds\nintuitively obvious, so don\u2019t be upset if you didn\u2019t come up with it.) Thus, if one day at noon a Mercury\nexplorer suggests to her companion that they should meet at noon the next day, this could mean a very\nlong time apart!\nTo make things even more interesting, recall that Mercury has an eccentric orbit, meaning that its distance\nfrom the Sun varies significantly during each mercurian year. By Kepler\u2019s law, the planet moves fastest in its\norbit when closest to the Sun. Let\u2019s examine how this affects the way we would see the Sun in the sky\nduring one 176-Earth-day cycle. We\u2019ll look at the situation as if we were standing on the surface of Mercury\nin the center of a giant basin that astronomers call Caloris (Figure 9.23).\nAt the location of Caloris, Mercury is most distant from the Sun at sunrise; this means the rising Sun looks\nsmaller in the sky (although still more than twice the size it appears from Earth). As the Sun rises higher\nand higher, it looks bigger and bigger; Mercury is now getting closer to the Sun in its eccentric orbit. At the\nsame time, the apparent motion of the Sun slows down as Mercury\u2019s faster motion in orbit begins to catch\nup with its rotation.\nAt noon, the Sun is now three times larger than it looks from Earth and hangs almost motionless in the sky.\nAs the afternoon wears on, the Sun appears smaller and smaller, and moves faster and faster in the sky. At\nsunset, a full Mercury year (or 88 Earth days after sunrise), the Sun is back to its smallest apparent size as it\ndips out of sight. Then it takes another Mercury year before the Sun rises again. (By the way, sunrises and\nsunsets are much more sudden on Mercury, since there is no atmosphere to bend or scatter the rays of\nsunlight.)\nAstronomers call locations like the Caloris Basin the \u201chot longitudes\u201d on Mercury because the Sun is closest\nto the planet at noon, just when it is lingering overhead for many Earth days. This makes these areas the\nhottest places on Mercury.\nWe bring all this up not because the exact details of this scenario are so important but to illustrate how\nmany of the things we take for granted on Earth are not the same on other worlds. As we\u2019ve mentioned\nbefore, one of the best things about taking an astronomy class should be ridding you forever of any \u201cEarth\nchauvinism\u201d you might have. The way things are on our planet is just one of the many ways nature can\narrange reality.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTheDay on Mercury visualization(https://openstax.org/l/30dayonmerc)shows how Mercury\u2019s slow\nrotation leads to very long days and how this combines with its highly elliptical orbit to cause some unusual\nmotions of the sun in the sky. Note the stick figure on the surface of Mercury; the Day/Night box shows\nwhat that stick figure would see in the sky.\nThe Surface of Mercury\nThe first close-up look atMercurycame in 1974, when the US spacecraft Mariner 10 passed 9500 kilometers\nfrom the surface of the planet and transmitted more than 2000 photographs to Earth, revealing details with a\nresolution down to 150 meters. Subsequently, the planet was mapped in great detail by theMESSENGER\nspacecraft, which was launched in 2004 and made multiple flybys of Earth, Venus, and Mercury before settling\ninto orbit around Mercury in 2011. It ended its life in 2015, when it was commanded to crash into the surface of\nthe planet.\nMercury\u2019s surfacestrongly resembles the Moon in appearance (Figure 9.22andFigure 9.23). It is covered with\nAccess for free at openstax.org 9.5 \u2022 Mercury 301\nthousands of craters and larger basins up to 1300 kilometers in diameter. Some of the brighter craters are\nrayed, like Tycho and Copernicus on the Moon, and many have central peaks. There are alsoscarps(cliffs)\nmore than a kilometer high and hundreds of kilometers long, as well as ridges and plains.\nMESSENGER instruments measured the surface composition and mapped past volcanic activity. One of its\nmost important discoveries was the verification of water ice (first detected by radar) in craters near the poles,\nsimilar to the situation on the Moon, and the unexpected discovery of organic (carbon-rich) compounds mixed\nwith the water ice.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nScientists working with data from theMESSENGER mission(https://openstax.org/l/30MESSmercuryrt)put\ntogether a rotating globe of Mercury, in false color, showing some of the variations in the composition of\nthe planet\u2019s surface. You can watch it spin.\nFigure9.22Mercury\u2019s Topography.The topography of Mercury\u2019s northern hemisphere is mapped in great detail from MESSENGER\ndata.

Among\nthe named craters are Bach, Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Van Gogh, and Scott Joplin.\nThere is no evidence of plate tectonics on Mercury. However, the planet\u2019s distinctive longscarpscan\nsometimes be seen cutting across craters; this means the scarps must have formed later than the craters\n(Figure 9.24). These long, curved cliffs appear to have their origin in the slight compression of Mercury\u2019s crust.\nApparently, at some point in its history, the planet shrank, wrinkling the crust, and it must have done so after\nmost of the craters on its surface had already formed.\nIf the standard cratering chronology applies to Mercury, this shrinkage must have taken place during the last 4\nbillion years and not during the solar system\u2019s early period of heavy bombardment.\nFigure9.24Discovery Scarp on Mercury.This long cliff, nearly 1 kilometer high and more than 100 kilometers long, cuts across\nseveral craters. Astronomers conclude that the compression that made \u201cwrinkles\u201d like this in the planet's surface must have taken\nplace after the craters were formed. (credit: modification of work by NASA/JPL/Northwestern University)\nThe Origin of Mercury\nThe problem with understanding howMercuryformed is the reverse of the problem posed by the composition\nof the Moon. We have seen that, unlike the Moon, Mercury is composed mostly of metal. However,\nAccess for free at openstax.org 9.5 \u2022 Mercury 303\nastronomers think that Mercury should have formed with roughly the same ratio of metal to silicate as that\nfound on Earth or Venus. How did it lose so much of its rocky material?\nThe most probable explanation for Mercury\u2019s silicate loss may be similar to the explanation for the Moon\u2019s\nlack of a metal core. Mercury is likely to have experienced several giant impacts very early in its youth, and one\nor more of these may have torn away a fraction of its mantle and crust, leaving a body dominated by its iron\ncore. A recent alternative explanation suggests that, early on, heat from the young Sun evaporated much of\nthe lighter, more volatile, silicates in the material that formed Mercury, leaving the planet with a majority of\nmetals.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nYou can follow some ofNASA\u2019s latest research on Mercury(https://openstax.org/l/30NASAresmercu)and\nsee some helpful animations on the MESSENGER web page.\nToday, astronomers recognize that the early solar system was a chaotic place, with the final stages of planet\nformation characterized by impacts of great violence. Some objects of planetary mass have been destroyed,\nwhereas others could have fragmented and then re-formed, perhaps more than once. Both the Moon and\nMercury, with their strange compositions, bear testimony to the catastrophes that must have characterized\nthe solar system during its youth. 304 9 \u2022 Key Terms\nKey Terms\nhighlands the lighter, heavily cratered regions of the Moon, which are generally several kilometers higher\nthan the maria\nmare (plural: maria) Latin for \u201csea;\u201d the name applied to the dark, relatively smooth features that cover 17%\nof the Moon\u2019s surface\nSummary\n9.1General Properties of the Moon\nMost of what we know about the Moon derives from the Apollo program, including 400 kilograms of lunar\nsamples still being intensively studied. The Moon has one-eightieth the mass of Earth and is severely depleted\nin both metals and volatile materials. It is made almost entirely of silicates like those in Earth\u2019s mantle and\ncrust. However, more recent spacecraft have found evidence of a small amount of water near the lunar poles,\nmost likely deposited by comet and asteroid impacts.\n9.2The Lunar Surface\nThe Moon, like Earth, was formed about 4.5 billion year ago. The Moon\u2019s heavily cratered highlands are made\nof rocks more than 4 billion years old. The darker volcanic plains of the maria were erupted primarily between\n3.3 and 3.8 billion years ago. Generally, the surface is dominated by impacts, including continuing small\nimpacts that produce its fine-grained soil.\n9.3Impact Craters\nA century ago, Grove Gilbert suggested that the lunar craters were caused by impacts, but the cratering\nprocess was not well understood until more recently. High-speed impacts produce explosions and excavate\ncraters 10 to 15 times the size of the impactor with raised rims, ejecta blankets, and often central peaks.\nCratering rates have been roughly constant for the past 3 billion years but earlier were much greater. Crater\ncounts can be used to derive approximate ages for geological features on the Moon and other worlds with\nsolid surfaces.\n9.4The Origin of the Moon\nThe three standard hypotheses for the origin of the Moon were the fission hypothesis, the sister hypothesis,\nand the capture hypothesis. All have problems, and they have been supplanted by the giant impact hypothesis,\nwhich ascribes the origin of the Moon to the impact of a Mars-sized projectile with Earth 4.5 billion years ago.\nThe debris from the impact made a ring around Earth which condensed and formed the Moon.\n9.5Mercury\nMercury is the nearest planet to the Sun and the fastest moving. Mercury is similar to the Moon in having a\nheavily cratered surface and no atmosphere, but it differs in having a very large metal core. Early in its\nevolution, it apparently lost part of its silicate mantle, probably due to one or more giant impacts. Long scarps\non its surface testify to a global compression of Mercury\u2019s crust during the past 4 billion years.\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nThe Moon\nBakich, Michael. \u201cAsia\u2019s New Assault on the Moon.\u201dAstronomy(August 2009): 50.

Astronomers believe that the deposit of lava in the giant mare basins did not happen in one flow but in\nmany different eruptions spanning some time. Indeed, in any one mare, we find a variety of rock ages,\ntypically spanning about 100 million years.

In contrast, the larger terrestrial planets\u2014Earth, Venus, and\nMars\u2014are more active and interesting worlds. We have already discussed Earth, and we now turn to Venus\nand Mars. These are the nearest planets and the most accessible to spacecraft. Not surprisingly, the greatest\neffort in planetary exploration has been devoted to these fascinating worlds. In the chapter, we discuss some\nof the results of more than four decades of scientific exploration of Mars and Venus. Mars is exceptionally\ninteresting, with evidence that points to habitable conditions in the past. Even today, we are discovering things\nabout Mars that make it the most likely place where humans might set up a habitat in the future. However, our\nrobot explorers have clearly shown that neither Venus nor Mars has conditions similar to Earth. How did it\nhappen that these three neighboring terrestrial planets have diverged so dramatically in their evolution?\n10.1 The Nearest Planets: An Overview\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain why it\u2019s difficult to learn aboutVenusfrom Earth-based observation alone\nDescribe the history of our interest inMarsbefore the Space Age\nCompare the basic physical properties of Earth, Mars, and Venus, including their orbits 312 10 \u2022 Earthlike Planets: Venus and Mars\nAs you might expect from close neighbors, Mars and Venus are among the brightest objects in the night sky.\nThe average distance of Mars from the Sun is 227 million kilometers (1.52 AU), or about half again as far from\nthe Sun as Earth. Venus\u2019 orbit is very nearly circular, at a distance of 108 million kilometers (0.72 AU) from the\nSun. Like Mercury, Venus sometimes appears as an \u201cevening star\u201d and sometimes as a \u201cmorning star.\u201d Venus\napproaches Earth more closely than does any other planet: at its nearest, it is only 40 million kilometers from\nus. The closest Mars ever gets to Earth is about 56 million kilometers.\nAppearance\nVenusappears very bright, and even a small telescope reveals that it goes through phases like the Moon.\nGalileo discovered that Venus displays a full range of phases, and he used this as an argument to show that\nVenus must circle the Sun and not Earth. The planet\u2019s actual surface is not visible because it is shrouded by\ndense clouds that reflect about 70% of the sunlight that falls on them, frustrating efforts to study the\nunderlying surface, even with cameras in orbit around the planet (Figure 10.2).\nFigure10.2Venus as Photographed by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter.This ultraviolet image shows an upper-atmosphere cloud\nstructure that would be invisible at visible wavelengths. Note that there is not even a glimpse of the planet\u2019s surface. (credit:\nmodification of work by NASA)\nIn contrast, Mars is more tantalizing as seen through a telescope (Figure 10.3). The planet is distinctly red, due\n(as we now know) to the presence of iron oxides in its soil. This color may account for its association with war\n(and blood) in the legends of early cultures. The best resolution obtainable from telescopes on the ground is\nabout 100 kilometers, or about the same as what we can see on the Moon with the unaided eye. At this\nresolution, no hint of topographic structure can be detected: no mountains, no valleys, not even impact\ncraters. On the other hand, bright polar ice caps can be seen easily, together with dusky surface markings that\nsometimes change in outline and intensity from season to season.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.1 \u2022 The Nearest Planets: An Overview 313\nFigure10.3Mars as Seen from Earth\u2019s Surface.These are among the best Earth-based photos ofMars, taken in 1988 when the\nplanet was exceptionally close to Earth. The polar caps and dark surface markings are evident, but not topographic features. (credit:\nmodification of work by Steve Larson, Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, University of Arizona)\nFor a few decades around the turn of the twentieth century, some astronomers believed that they saw\nevidence of an intelligent civilization on Mars. The controversy began in 1877, when Italian astronomer\nGiovanniSchiaparelli(1835\u20131910) announced that he could see long, faint, straight lines on Mars that he called\ncanale, or channels. In English-speaking countries, the term was mistakenly translated as \u201ccanals,\u201d implying an\nartificial origin.\nEven before Schiaparelli\u2019s observations, astronomers had watched the bright polar caps change size with the\nseasons and had seen variations in the dark surface features. With a little imagination, it was not difficult to\npicture the canals as long fields of crops bordering irrigation ditches that brought water from the melting\npolar ice to the parched deserts of the red planet. (They assumed the polar caps were composed of water ice,\nwhich isn\u2019t exactly true, as we will see shortly.)\nUntil his death in 1916, the most effective proponent of intelligent life on Mars was PercivalLowell, a self-made\nAmerican astronomer and member of the wealthy Lowell family of Boston (see the feature box onPercival\nLowell: Dreaming of an Inhabited Mars). A skilled author and speaker, Lowell made what seemed to the public\nto be a convincing case for intelligent Martians, who had constructed the huge canals to preserve their\ncivilization in the face of a deteriorating climate (Figure 10.4). 314 10 \u2022 Earthlike Planets: Venus and Mars\nFigure10.4Lowell\u2019s Mars Globe.One of the remarkable globes of Mars prepared by Percival Lowell, showing a network of dozens\nof canals, oases, and triangular water reservoirs that he claimed were visible on the red planet.\nThe argument for a race of intelligent Martians, however, hinged on the reality of the canals, a matter that\nremained in serious dispute among astronomers. The canal markings were always difficult to study, glimpsed\nonly occasionally because atmospheric conditions caused the tiny image of Mars to shimmer in the telescope.\nLowell saw canals everywhere (even a few on Venus), but many other observers could not see them at all and\nremained unconvinced of their existence. When telescopes larger than Lowell\u2019s failed to confirm the presence\nof canals, the skeptics felt vindicated. Now it is generally accepted that the straight lines were an optical\nillusion, the result of the human mind\u2019s tendency to see order in random features that are glimpsed dimly at\nthe limits of the eye\u2019s resolution. When we see small, dim dots of surface markings, our minds tend to connect\nthose dots into straight lines.\nVOYAGERS IN ASTRONOMY\nPercival Lowell: Dreaming of an Inhabited Mars\nPercivalLowellwas born into the well-to-do Massachusetts family about whom John Bossidy made the\nfamous toast:\nAnd this is good old Boston,\nThe home of the bean and the cod,\nWhere the Lowells talk to the Cabots\nAnd the Cabots talk only to God.\nPercival\u2019s brother Lawrence became president of Harvard University, and his sister, Amy, became a\ndistinguished poet. Percival was already interested in astronomy as a boy: he made observations of Mars at\nage 13. His undergraduate thesis at Harvard dealt with the origin of the solar system, but he did not pursue\nthis interest immediately. Instead, he entered the family business and traveled extensively in Asia. In 1892,\nhowever, he decided to dedicate himself to carrying on Schiaparelli\u2019s work and solving the mysteries of the\nmartian canals.\nIn 1894, with the help of astronomers at Harvard but using his own funds, Lowell built an observatory on a\nhigh plateau in Flagstaff, Arizona, where he hoped the seeing would be clear enough to show him Mars in\nunprecedented detail. He and his assistants quickly accumulated a tremendous number of drawings and\nmaps, purporting to show a vast network of martian canals (seeFigure 10.4). He elaborated his ideas about\nthe inhabitants of the red planet in several books, includingMars(1895) andMars and Its Canals(1906),\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.1 \u2022 The Nearest Planets: An Overview 315\nand in hundreds of articles and speeches.\nAs Lowell put it,\nA mind of no mean order would seem to have presided over the system we see\u2014a mind certainly of\nconsiderably more comprehensiveness than that which presides over the various departments of our own\npublic works. Party politics, at all events, have had no part in them; for the system is planet-wide. . . .\nCertainly what we see hints at the existence of beings who are in advance of, not behind us, in the journey\nof life.\nLowell\u2019s views captured the public imagination and inspired many novels and stories, the most famous of\nwhich was H. G. Wells\u2019War of the Worlds(1897). In this famous \u201cinvasion\u201d novel, the thirsty inhabitants of a\ndying planet Mars (based entirely on Lowell\u2019s ideas) come to conquer Earth with advanced technology.\nAlthough the Lowell Observatory first became famous for its work on the martian canals, both Lowell and\nthe observatory eventually turned to other projects as well. He became interested in the search for a ninth\n(and then undiscovered) planet in the solar system. In 1930, Pluto was found at the Lowell Observatory, and\nit is not a coincidence that the name selected for the new planet starts with Lowell\u2019s initials. It was also at\nthe Lowell Observatory that the first measurements were made of the great speed at which galaxies are\nmoving away from us, observations that would ultimately lead to our modern view of an expanding\nuniverse.\nLowell (Figure 10.5) continued to live at his observatory, marrying at age 53 and publishing extensively. He\nrelished the debate his claims about Mars caused far more than the astronomers on the other side, who\noften complained that Lowell\u2019s work was making planetary astronomy a less respectable field. At the same\ntime, the public fascination with the planets fueled by Lowell\u2019s work (and its interpreters) may, several\ngenerations later, have helped fan support for the space program and the many missions whose results\ngrace the pages of our text.\nFigure10.5Percival Lowell (1855\u20131916).This 1914 photograph shows PercivalLowellobserving Venus with his 24-inch telescope\nat Flagstaff, Arizona.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nIn October 1938, the Mercury Theater of the Air on radio dramatizedThe War of the Worldsas a series of 316 10 \u2022 Earthlike Planets: Venus and Mars\nradio news reports. Thisbroadcast(https://openstax.org/l/30WarofWorlds)scared many people into\nthinking that Lowell\u2019s Martians were really invading New Jersey, and caused something of a panic. You can\nlisten to the original radio broadcast if you scroll down to \u201cWar of the Worlds.\u201d\nRotation of the Planets\nAstronomers have determined the rotation period ofMarswith great accuracy by watching the motion of\npermanent surface markings; its sidereal day is 24 hours 37 minutes 23 seconds, just a little longer than the\nrotation period of Earth. This high precision is not obtained by watching Mars for a single rotation, but by\nnoting how many turns it makes over a long period of time. Good observations of Mars date back more than\n200 years, a period during which tens of thousands of martian days have passed. As a result, the rotation\nperiod can be calculated to within a few hundredths of a second.\nThe rotational axis of Mars has a tilt of about 25\u00b0, similar to the tilt of Earth\u2019s axis. Thus, Mars experiences\nseasons very much like those on Earth. Because of the longer martian year (almost two Earth years), however,\neach season there lasts about six of our months.\nThe situation withVenusis different. Since no surface detail can be seen through Venus\u2019 clouds, its rotation\nperiod can be found only by bouncing radar signals off the planet (as explained for Mercury in theCratered\nWorldschapter). The first radar observations of Venus\u2019 rotation were made in the early 1960s. Later,\ntopographical surface features were identified on the planet that showed up in the reflected radar signals. The\nrotation period of Venus, precisely determined from the motion of such \u201cradar features\u201d across its disk, is 243\ndays. Even more surprising than howlongVenus takes to rotate is the fact that it spins in a backward or\nretrograde direction (east to west).\nStop for a moment and think about how odd this slow rotation makes the calendar on Venus. The planet takes\n225 Earth days to orbit the Sun and 243 Earth days to spin on its axis. So the day on Venus (as defined by its\nspinning once) is longer than the year! As a result, the time the Sun takes to return to the same place in Venus\u2019\nsky\u2014another way we might define the meaning of a day\u2014turns out to be 117 Earth days. (If you say \u201cSee you\ntomorrow\u201d on Venus, you\u2019ll have a long time to wait.) Although we do not know the reason for Venus\u2019 slow\nbackward rotation, we can guess that it may have suffered one or more extremely powerful collisions during\nthe formation process of the solar system.\nBasic Properties of Venus and Mars\nBefore discussing each planet individually, let us compare some of their basic properties with each other and\nwith Earth (Table 10.1).Venusis in many ways Earth\u2019s twin, with a mass 0.82 times the mass of Earth and an\nalmost identical density. The average amount of geological activity has been also relatively high, almost as\nhigh as on Earth. On the other hand, with a surface pressure nearly 100 times greater than ours, Venus\u2019\natmosphere is not at all like that of Earth. The surface of Venus is also remarkably hot, with a temperature of\n730 K (over 850 \u00b0F), hotter than the self-cleaning cycle of your oven. One of the major challenges presented by\nVenus is to understand why the atmosphere and surface environment of this twin have diverged so sharply\nfrom those of our own planet.\nProperties of Earth, Venus, and Mars\nProperty Earth Venus Mars\nSemimajor axis (AU) 1.00 0.72 1.52\nTable10.1\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.2 \u2022 The Geology of Venus 317\nProperty Earth Venus Mars\nPeriod (year) 1.00 0.61 1.88\nMass (Earth = 1) 1.00 0.82 0.11\nDiameter (km) 12,756 12,102 6,790\nDensity (g/cm3) 5.5 5.3 3.9\nSurface gravity (Earth = 1) 1.00 0.91 0.38\nEscape velocity (km/s) 11.2 10.4 5.0\nRotation period (hours or days) 23.9 h 243 d 24.6 h\nSurface area (Earth = 1) 1.00 0.90 0.28\nAtmospheric pressure (bar) 1.00 90 0.007\nTable10.1\nMars, by contrast, is rather small, with a mass only 0.11 times the mass of Earth. It is larger than either the\nMoon or Mercury, however, and, unlike them, it retains a thin atmosphere. Mars is also large enough to have\nsupported considerable geological activity in the distant past. But the most fascinating thing about Mars is\nthat long ago it probably had a thick atmosphere and seas of liquid water\u2014the conditions we associate with\ndevelopment of life. There is even a chance that some form of life persists today in protected environments\nbelow the martian surface.\n10.2 The Geology of Venus\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the general features of the surface of Venus\nExplain what the study of craters on Venus tells us about the age of its surface\nCompare tectonic activity and volcanoes on Venus with those of Earth\nExplain why the surface of Venus is inhospitable to human life\nSinceVenushas about the same size and composition as Earth, we might expect its geology to be similar. This\nis partly true, but Venus does not exhibit the same kind ofplate tectonicsas Earth, and we will see that its lack\nof erosion results in a very different surface appearance.\nSpacecraft Exploration of Venus\nNearly 50 spacecraft have been launched to Venus, but only about half were successful. Although the 1962 US\nMariner 2 flyby was the first, the Soviet Union launched most of the subsequent missions to Venus. In 1970,\nVenera 7 became the first probe to land and broadcast data from the surface of Venus. It operated for 23\nminutes before succumbing to the high surface temperature. Additional Venera probes and landers followed,\nphotographing the surface and analyzing the atmosphere and soil.\nTo understand the geology of Venus, however, we needed to make a global study of its surface, a task made 318 10 \u2022 Earthlike Planets: Venus and Mars\nvery difficult by the perpetual cloud layers surrounding the planet. The problem resembles the challenge\nfacing air traffic controllers at an airport, when the weather is so cloudy or smoggy that they can\u2019t locate the\nincoming planes visually. The solution is similar in both cases: use a radar instrument to probe through the\nobscuring layer.\nThe first global radar map was made by the US Pioneer Venus orbiter in the late 1970s, followed by better\nmaps from the twin Soviet Venera 15 and 16 radar orbiters in the early 1980s. However, most of our\ninformation on the geology of Venus is derived from the USMagellanspacecraft, which mapped Venus with a\npowerfulimaging radar.Magellanproduced images with a resolution of 100 meters, much better than that of\nprevious missions, yielding our first detailed look at the surface of our sister planet (Figure 10.6). (The\nMagellanspacecraft returned more data to Earth than all previous planetary missions combined; each 100\nminutes of data transmission from the spacecraft provided enough information, if translated into characters,\nto fill two 30-volume encyclopedias.)\nFigure10.6Radar Map of Venus.This composite image has a resolution of about 3 kilometers. Colors have been added to indicate\nelevation, with blue meaning low and brown and white high. The large continent Aphrodite stretches around the equator, where the\nbright (therefore rough) surface has been deformed by tectonic forces in the crust ofVenus. (credit: modification of work by NASA/\nJPL/USGS)\nConsider for a moment how goodMagellan\u2019s resolution of 100 meters really is. It means the radar images\nfrom Venus can show anything on the surface larger than a football field. Suddenly, a whole host of\ntopographic features on Venus became accessible to our view. As you look at the radar images throughout this\nchapter, bear in mind that these are constructed from radar reflections, not from visible-light photographs.\nFor example, bright features on these radar images are an indication of rough terrain, whereas darker regions\nare smoother.\nProbing Through the Clouds of Venus\nThe radar maps of Venus reveal a planet that looks much the way Earth might look if our planet\u2019s surface were\nnot constantly being changed by erosion and deposition of sediment. Because there is no water or ice on\nVenus and the surface wind speeds are low, almost nothing obscures or erases the complex geological\nfeatures produced by the movements of Venus\u2019 crust, by volcanic eruptions, and by impact craters. Having\nfinally penetrated below the clouds of Venus, we find its surface to be naked, revealing the history of hundreds\nof millions of years of geological activity.\nAbout 75% of the surface of Venus consists of lowland lava plains. Superficially, these plains resemble the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.2 \u2022 The Geology of Venus 319\nbasaltic ocean basins of Earth, but they were not produced in quite the same way. There is no evidence of\nsubduction zones on Venus, indicating that, unlike Earth, this planet never experienced plate tectonics.\nAlthoughconvection(the rising of hot materials) in its mantle generated great stresses in the crust of Venus,\nthey did not start large continental plates moving. The formation of the lava plains of Venus more nearly\nresembles that of the lunar maria. Both were the result of widespread lava eruptions without the crustal\nspreading associated with plate tectonics.\nRising above the lowland lava plains are two full-scale continents of mountainous terrain. The largest\ncontinent on Venus, called Aphrodite, is about the size of Africa (you can see it stand out inFigure 10.6).\nAphrodite stretches along the equator for about one-third of the way around the planet. Next in size is the\nnorthern highland region Ishtar, which is about the size of Australia. Ishtar contains the highest region on the\nplanet, the Maxwell Mountains, which rise 11 kilometers above the surrounding lowlands. (The Maxwell\nMountains are the only feature on Venus named after a man. They commemorate James Clerk Maxwell, whose\ntheory of electromagnetism led to the invention of radar. All other features are named for women, either from\nhistory or mythology.)\nCraters and the Age of the Venus Surface\nOne of the first questions astronomers addressed with the high-resolutionMagellanimages was the age of\nthe surface ofVenus. Remember that the age of a planetary surface is rarely the age of the world it is on. A\nyoung age merely implies an active geology in that location. Such ages can be derived from counting impact\ncraters.Figure 10.7is an example of what these craters look like on the Venus radar images. The more densely\ncratered the surface, the greater its age. The largest crater on Venus (called Mead) is 275 kilometers in\ndiameter, slightly larger than the largest known terrestrial crater (Chicxulub), but much smaller than the lunar\nimpact basins.\nFigure10.7Impact Craters on Venus.(a) These large impact craters are in the Lavinia region of Venus. Because they are rough, the\ncrater rims and ejecta appear brighter in these radar images than do the smoother surrounding lava plains. The largest of these\ncraters has a diameter of 50 kilometers. (b) This small, complex crater is named after writer Gertrude Stein. The triple impact was\ncaused by the breaking apart of the incoming asteroid during its passage through the thick atmosphere of Venus. The projectile had\nan initial diameter of between 1 and 2 kilometers. (credit a: modification of work by NASA/JPL; credit b: modification of work by\nNASA/JPL)\nYou might think that the thick atmosphere of Venus would protect the surface from impacts, burning up the\nprojectiles long before they could reach the surface. But this is the case for only smaller projectiles. Crater\nstatistics show very few craters less than 10 kilometers in diameter, indicating that projectiles smaller than 320 10 \u2022 Earthlike Planets: Venus and Mars\nabout 1 kilometer (the size that typically produces a 10-kilometer crater) were stopped by the atmosphere.\nThose craters with diameters from 10 to 30 kilometers are frequently distorted or multiple, apparently because\nthe incoming projectile broke apart in the atmosphere before it could strike the ground as shown in the Stein\ncrater inFigure 10.7. If we limit ourselves to impacts that produce craters with diameters of 30 kilometers or\nlarger, however, then crater counts are as useful on Venus for measuring surface age as they are on airless\nbodies such as the Moon.\nThe large craters in the venusian plains indicate an average surface age that is only between 300 and 600\nmillion years. These results indicate that Venus is indeed a planet with persistent geological activity,\nintermediate between that of Earth\u2019s ocean basins (which are younger and more active) and that of its\ncontinents (which are older and less active).\nAlmost all of the large craters on Venus look fresh, with little degradation or filling in by either lava or\nwindblown dust. This is one way we know that the rates of erosion or sediment deposition are very low. We\nhave the impression that relatively little has happened since the venusian plains were last resurfaced by large-\nscale volcanic activity. Apparently Venus experienced some sort of planet-wide volcanic convulsion between\n300 and 600 million years ago, a mysterious event that is unlike anything in terrestrial history.\nVolcanoes on Venus\nLike Earth,Venusis a planet that has experienced widespread volcanism. In the lowland plains, volcanic\neruptions are the principal way the surface is renewed, with large flows of highly fluid lava destroying old\ncraters and generating a fresh surface. In addition, numerous younger volcanic mountains and other\nstructures are associated with surface hot spots\u2014places where convection in the planet\u2019s mantle transports\nthe interior heat to the surface.\nThe largest individual volcano on Venus, called Sif Mons, is about 500 kilometers across and 3 kilometers\nhigh\u2014broader but lower than the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Loa. At its top is a volcanic crater, orcaldera, about\n40 kilometers across, and its slopes show individual lava flows up to 500 kilometers long. Thousands of smaller\nvolcanoes dot the surface, down to the limit of visibility of theMagellanimages, which correspond to cones or\ndomes about the size of a shopping mall parking lot. Most of these seem similar to terrestrial volcanoes. Other\nvolcanoes have unusual shapes, such as the \u201cpancake domes\u201d illustrated inFigure 10.8.\nFigure10.8Pancake-Shaped Volcanoes on Venus.These remarkable circular domes, each about 25 kilometers across and about 2\nkilometers tall, are the result of eruptions of highly viscous (sludgy) lava that spreads out evenly in all directions. (credit: modification\nof work by NASA/JPL)\nAll of the volcanism is the result of eruption of lava onto the surface of the planet. But the hot lava rising from\nthe interior of a planet does not always make it to the surface. On both Earth and Venus, this upwelling lava\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.2 \u2022 The Geology of Venus 321\ncan collect to produce bulges in the crust. Many of the granite mountain ranges on Earth, such as the Sierra\nNevada in California, involve such subsurface volcanism. These bulges are common on Venus, where they\nproduce large circular or oval features calledcoronae(singular: corona) (Figure 10.9).\nFigure10.9The \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d Corona.Fotla Corona is located in the plains to the south of Aphrodite Terra. Curved fracture patterns\nshow where the material beneath has put stress on the surface. A number of pancake and dome volcanoes are also visible. Fotla was\na Celtic fertility goddess. Some students see a resemblance between this corona and Miss Piggy of the Muppets (her left ear, at the\ntop of the picture, is the pancake volcano in the upper center of the image). (credit: NASA/JPL)\nTectonic Activity\nConvection currents of molten material in the mantle of Venus push and stretch the crust. Such forces are\ncalledtectonic, and the geological features that result from these forces are calledtectonic features. On\nVenus\u2019 lowland plains, tectonic forces have broken the lava surface to create remarkable patterns of ridges\nand cracks (Figure 10.10). In a few places, the crust has even torn apart to generate rift valleys. The circular\nfeatures associated with coronae are tectonic ridges and cracks, and most of the mountains of Venus also owe\ntheir existence to tectonic forces.\nFigure10.10Ridges and Cracks.This region of the Lakshmi Plains on Venus has been fractured by tectonic forces to produce a\ncross-hatched grid of cracks and ridges. Be sure to notice the fainter linear features that run perpendicular to the brighter ones. As\nthis is a radar image, the brightness of the ridges indicates their relative height. This image shows a region about 80 kilometers wide\nand 37 kilometers high. Lakshmi is a Hindu goddess of prosperity. (credit: modification of work by Magellan Team, JPL, NASA)\nThe Ishtar continent, which has the highest elevations on Venus, is the most dramatic product of these\ntectonic forces. Ishtar and its tall Maxwell Mountains resemble the Tibetan Plateau and Himalayan Mountains\non Earth. Both are the product of compression of the crust, and both are maintained by the continuing forces\nof mantle convection.\nOn Venus\u2019 Surface\nThe successful Venera landers of the 1970s found themselves on an extraordinarily inhospitable planet, with a 322 10 \u2022 Earthlike Planets: Venus and Mars\nsurface pressure of 90 bars and a temperature hot enough to melt lead and zinc. Despite these unpleasant\nconditions, the spacecraft were able to photograph their surroundings and collect surface samples for\nchemical analysis before their instruments gave out. The diffuse sunlight striking the surface was tinted red by\nthe clouds, and the illumination level was equivalent to a heavy overcast on Earth.\nThe probes found that the rock in the landing areas is igneous, primarily basalts. Examples of the Venera\nphotographs are shown inFigure 10.11. Each picture shows a flat, desolate landscape with a variety of rocks,\nsome of which may be ejecta from impacts. Other areas show flat, layered lava flows. There have been no\nfurther landings on Venus since the 1970s. However, NASA has plans for a radar orbiter with much higher\nresolution than Magellan, that will focus on the complex structures in the Aphrodite region. Some geologists\nthink this area shows evidence of geologic plates, with past activity analogous to the plate tectonics on Earth.\nFigure10.11Surface of Venus.These views of the surface of Venus are from the Venera 13 spacecraft. Everything is orange because\nthe thick atmosphere of Venus absorbs the bluer colors of light. The horizon is visible in the upper corner of each image. (credit:\nNASA)\n10.3 The Massive Atmosphere of Venus\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the general composition and structure of the atmosphere on Venus\nExplain how the greenhouse effect has led to high temperatures on Venus\nThe thick atmosphere ofVenusproduces the high surface temperature and shrouds the surface in a perpetual\nred twilight. Sunlight does not penetrate directly through the heavy clouds, but the surface is fairly well lit by\ndiffuse light (about the same as the light on Earth under a heavy overcast). The weather at the bottom of this\ndeep atmosphere remains perpetually hot and dry, with calm winds. Because of the heavy blanket of clouds\nand atmosphere, one spot on the surface of Venus is similar to any other as far as weather is concerned.\nComposition and Structure of the Atmosphere\nThe most abundant gas on Venus is carbon dioxide (CO ), which accounts for 96% of the atmosphere. The\n2\nsecond most common gas is nitrogen. The predominance of carbon dioxide over nitrogen is not surprising\nwhen you recall that Earth\u2019s atmosphere would also be mostly carbon dioxide if this gas were not locked up in\nmarine sediments (see the discussion of Earth\u2019s atmosphere inEarth as a Planet).\nTable 10.2compares the compositions of the atmospheres of Venus, Mars, and Earth. Expressed in this way, as\npercentages, the proportions of the major gases are very similar for Venus and Mars, but in total quantity,\ntheir atmospheres are dramatically different. With its surface pressure of 90 bars, the venusian atmosphere is\nmore than 10,000 times more massive than its martian counterpart. Overall, the atmosphere of Venus is very\ndry; the absence of water is one of the important ways that Venus differs from Earth.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.3 \u2022 The Massive Atmosphere of Venus 323\nAtmospheric Composition of Earth, Venus, and Mars\nGas Earth Venus Mars\nCarbon dioxide (CO ) 0.03% 96% 95.3%\n2\nNitrogen (N ) 78.1% 3.5% 2.7%\n2\nArgon (Ar) 0.93% 0.006% 1.6%\nOxygen (O ) 21.0% 0.003% 0.15%\n2\nNeon (Ne) 0.002% 0.001% 0.0003%\nTable10.2\nThe atmosphere of Venus has a huge troposphere (region of convection) that extends up to at least 50\nkilometers above the surface (Figure 10.12). Within the troposphere, the gas is heated from below and\ncirculates slowly, rising near the equator and descending over the poles. Being at the base of the atmosphere\nof Venus is something like being a kilometer or more below the ocean surface on Earth. There, the mass of\nwater evens out temperature variations and results in a uniform environment\u2014the same effect the thick\natmosphere has on Venus.\nFigure10.12Venus\u2019 Atmosphere.The layers of the massive atmosphere of Venus shown here are based on data from the Pioneer\nand Venera entry probes. Height is measured along the left axis, the bottom scale shows temperature, and the red line allows you to\nread off the temperature at each height. Notice how steeply the temperature rises below the clouds, thanks to the planet\u2019s huge\ngreenhouse effect.\nIn the upper troposphere, between 30 and 60 kilometers above the surface, a thick cloud layer is composed\nprimarily of sulfuric acid droplets. Sulfuric acid (H SO ) is formed from the chemical combination of sulfur\n2 4\ndioxide (SO ) and water (H O). In the atmosphere of Earth, sulfur dioxide is one of the primary gases emitted\n2 2\nby volcanoes, but it is quickly diluted and washed out by rainfall. In the dry atmosphere of Venus, this\nunpleasant substance is apparently stable. Below 30 kilometers, the Venus atmosphere is clear of clouds.\nSurface Temperature on Venus\nThe high surface temperature ofVenuswas discovered by radio astronomers in the late 1950s and confirmed 324 10 \u2022 Earthlike Planets: Venus and Mars\nby the Mariner and Venera probes. How can our neighbor planet be so hot? Although Venus is somewhat\ncloser to the Sun than is Earth, its surface is hundreds of degrees hotter than you would expect from the extra\nsunlight it receives. Scientists wondered what could be heating the surface of Venus to a temperature above\n700 K. The answer turned out to be thegreenhouse effect.\nThe greenhouse effect works on Venus just as it does on Earth, but since Venus has so much more\nCO \u2014almost a million times more\u2014the effect is much stronger. The thick CO acts as a blanket, making it very\n2 2\ndifficult for the infrared (heat) radiation from the ground to get back into space. As a result, the surface heats\nup. The energy balance is only restored when the planet is radiating as much energy as it receives from the\nSun, but this can happen only when the temperature of the lower atmosphere is very high. One way of\nthinking of greenhouse heating is that it must raise the surface temperature of Venus until this energy balance\nis achieved.\nHas Venus always had such a massive atmosphere and high surface temperature, or might it have evolved to\nsuch conditions from a climate that was once more nearly earthlike? The answer to this question is of\nparticular interest to us as we look at the increasing levels of CO in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. As the greenhouse\n2\neffect becomes stronger on Earth, are we in any danger of transforming our own planet into a hellish place\nlike Venus?\nLet us try to reconstruct the possible evolution of Venus from an earthlike beginning to its present state. Venus\nmay once have had a climate similar to that of Earth, with moderate temperatures, water oceans, and much of\nits CO dissolved in the ocean or chemically combined with the surface rocks. Then we allow for modest\n2\nadditional heating\u2014by gradual increase in the energy output of the Sun, for example. When we calculate how\nVenus\u2019 atmosphere would respond to such effects, it turns out that even a small amount of extra heat can lead\nto increased evaporation of water from the oceans and the release of gas from surface rocks.\nThis in turn means a further increase in the atmospheric CO and H O, gases that would amplify the\n2 2\ngreenhouse effectin Venus\u2019 atmosphere. That would lead to still more heat near Venus\u2019 surface and the\nrelease of further CO and H O. Unless some other processes intervene, the temperature thus continues to\n2 2\nrise. Such a situation is called therunaway greenhouse effect.\nWe want to emphasize that the runaway greenhouse effect is not just a large greenhouse effect; it is an\nevolutionaryprocess. The atmosphere evolves from having a small greenhouse effect, such as on Earth, to a\nsituation where greenhouse warming is a major factor, as we see today on Venus. Once the large greenhouse\nconditions develop, the planet establishes a new, much hotter equilibrium near its surface.\nReversing the situation is difficult because of the role water plays. On Earth, most of the CO is either\n2\nchemically bound in the rocks of our crust or dissolved by the water in our oceans. As Venus got hotter and\nhotter, its oceans evaporated, eliminating that safety valve. But the water vapor in the planet\u2019s atmosphere\nwill not last forever in the presence of ultraviolet light from the Sun. The light element hydrogen can escape\nfrom the atmosphere, leaving the oxygen behind to combine chemically with surface rock. The loss of water is\ntherefore an irreversible process: once the water is gone, it cannot be restored. There is evidence that this is\njust what happened to the water once present on Venus.\nWe don\u2019t know if the same runaway greenhouse effect could one day happen on Earth. Although we are\nuncertain about the point at which a stable greenhouse effect breaks down and turns into a runaway\ngreenhouse effect, Venus stands as clear testament to the fact that a planet cannot continue heating\nindefinitely without a major change in its oceans and atmosphere. It is a conclusion that we and our\ndescendants will surely want to pay close attention to.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.4 \u2022 The Geology of Mars 325\n10.4 The Geology of Mars\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDiscuss the main missions that have explored Mars\nExplain what we have learned from examination of meteorites from Mars\nDescribe the various features found on the surface of Mars\nCompare the volcanoes and canyons on Mars with those of Earth\nDescribe the general conditions on the surface of Mars\nMarsis more interesting to most people than Venus because it is more hospitable. Even from the distance of\nEarth, we can see surface features on Mars and follow the seasonal changes in its polar caps (Figure 10.13).\nAlthough the surface today is dry and cold, evidence collected by spacecraft suggests that Mars once had blue\nskies and lakes of liquid water. Even today, it is the sort of place we can imagine astronauts visiting and\nperhaps even setting up permanent bases.\nFigure10.13Mars Photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope.This is one of the best photos of Mars taken from our planet,\nobtained in June 2001 when Mars was only 68 million kilometers away. The resolution is about 20 kilometers\u2014much better than can\nbe obtained with ground-based telescopes but still insufficient to reveal the underlying geology of Mars. (credit: modification of\nwork by NASA and the Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA))\nSpacecraft Exploration of Mars\nMars has been intensively investigated by spacecraft. More than 50 spacecraft have been launched toward\nMars, but only about half were fully successful. The first visitor was the US Mariner 4, which flew past Mars in\n1965 and transmitted 22 photos to Earth. These pictures showed an apparently bleak planet with abundant\nimpact craters. In those days, craters were unexpected; some people who were romantically inclined still\nhoped to see canals or something like them. In any case, newspaper headlines sadly announced that Mars was\na \u201cdead planet.\u201d\nIn 1971, NASA\u2019s Mariner 9 became the first spacecraft to orbit another planet, mapping the entire surface of\nMars at a resolution of about 1 kilometer and discovering a great variety of geological features, including\nvolcanoes, huge canyons, intricate layers on the polar caps, and channels that appeared to have been cut by\nrunning water. Geologically, Mars didn\u2019t look so dead after all.\nThe twin Viking spacecraft of the 1970s were among the most ambitious and successful of all planetary 326 10 \u2022 Earthlike Planets: Venus and Mars\nmissions. Twoorbiterssurveyed the planet and served to relay communications for twolanderson the\nsurface. After an exciting and sometimes frustrating search for a safe landing spot, the Viking 1 lander\ntouched down on the surface of Chryse Planitia (the Plains of Gold) on July 20, 1976, exactly 7 years after Neil\nArmstrong\u2019s historic first step on the Moon. Two months later, Viking 2 landed with equal success in another\nplain farther north, called Utopia. The landers photographed the surface with high resolution and carried out\ncomplex experiments searching for evidence of life, while the orbiters provided a global perspective on Mars\ngeology.\nMars languished unvisited for two decades after Viking. Two more spacecraft were launched toward Mars, by\nNASA and the Russian Space Agency, but both failed before reaching the planet.\nThe situation changed, beginning in the 1990s, as NASA began a new exploration program using spacecraft\nthat were smaller and less expensive than Viking. The first of the new missions, appropriately called\nPathfinder, landed the first wheeled, solar-powered rover on the martian surface on July 4, 1997 (Figure 10.14).\nAn orbiter calledMars Global Surveyor(MGS) arrived a few months later and began high-resolution\nphotography of the entire surface over more than one martian year. The most dramatic discovery by this\nspacecraft, which continued to operate until 2006, was evidence of gullies apparently cut by surface water, as\nwe will discuss later. These missions were followed in 2003 by the NASAMars Odysseyorbiter, and the ESA\nMars Expressorbiter, both carrying high-resolution cameras. A gamma-ray spectrometer onOdyssey\ndiscovered a large amount of subsurface hydrogen (probably in the form of frozen water). Subsequent\norbiters included the NASAMars Reconnaissance Orbiterto evaluate future landing sites, MAVEN to study the\nupper atmosphere, and India\u2019sMangalayaan, also focused on study of Mars\u2019 thin layers of air. Several of these\norbiters are also equipped to communicate with landers and rovers on the surface and serve as data relays to\nEarth.\nFigure10.14Surface View from Mars Pathfinder.The scene from the Pathfinder lander shows a windswept plain, sculpted long\nago when water flowed out of the martian highlands and into the depression where the spacecraft landed. TheSojournerrover, the\nfirst wheeled vehicle on Mars, is about the size of a microwave oven. Its flat top contains solar cells that provided electricity to run\nthe vehicle. You can see the ramp from the lander and the path the rover took to the larger rock that the mission team nicknamed\n\u201cYogi.\u201d (credit: NASA/JPL)\nIn 2003, NASA began a series of highly successful Mars landers. Twin Mars Exploration Rovers (MER), named\nSpiritandOpportunity, have been successful far beyond their planned lifetimes. The design goal for the rovers\nwas 600 meters of travel; in fact, they have traveled jointly more than 50 kilometers. After scouting around its\nrim,Opportunitydrove down the steep walls into an impact crater called Victoria, then succeeded with some\ndifficulty in climbing back out to resume its route (Figure 10.15). Dust covering the rovers\u2019 solar cells caused a\ndrop in power, but when a seasonal dust storm blew away the dust, the rovers resumed full operation. In\norder to survive winter, the rovers were positioned on slopes to maximize solar heating and power generation.\nIn 2006,Spiritlost power on one of its wheels, and subsequently became stuck in the sand, where it continued\noperation as a fixed ground station. Meanwhile, in 2008,Phoenix(a spacecraft \u201creborn\u201d of spare parts from a\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.4 \u2022 The Geology of Mars 327\nprevious Mars mission that had failed) landed near the edge of the north polar cap, at latitude 68\u00b0, and directly\nmeasured water ice in the soil.\nFigure10.15Victoria Crater.(a) This crater in Meridiani Planum is 800 meters wide, making it slightly smaller than Meteor crater on\nEarth.

The 1-ton\nroverCuriosity, the size of a subcompact car, has plutonium-powered electrical generators, so that it is not\ndependent on sunlight for power.Curiositymade a pinpoint landing on the floor of Gale crater, a site selected\nfor its complex geology and evidence that it had been submerged by water in the past. Previously, Mars\nlanders had been sent to flat terrains with few hazards, as required by their lower targeting accuracy. The\nscientific goals ofCuriosityinclude investigations of climate and geology, and assessment of the habitability of\npast and present Mars environments. In 2018, NASA\u2019s InSight Lander touched down on Mars, carrying a suite\nof scientific instruments. These include a package (nicknamed \u201cthe mole\u201d) that will dig into the surface of\nMars 1 mm at a time, hoping to reach a depth of 5 meters with heat sensors. Neither of these missions carries\na specific life detection instrument, however. So far, scientists have not been able to devise a simple\ninstrument that could distinguish living from nonliving materials on Mars.\nThe focus on the possibility of life returned with the 2020 launch of the large roverPerseverance, the near-twin\nofCuriosity. It landed in a former lakebed, and part of its mission is to drill into ancient sedimentary rocks and\ncollect small samples of these rocks to be returned (by a later mission) to Earth for laboratory study. NASA\u2019s\nremarkable helicopter drone, namedIngenuity, has acted like an airborne scout for this mission.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTheCuriosityrover required a remarkably complex landing sequence and NASA made avideo\n(https://openstax.org/l/30Curiosityrove)about it called \u201c7 Minutes of Terror\u201d that went viral on the\nInternet.\nA dramaticvideo summary(https://openstax.org/l/30MarsSurface)of the first two years ofCuriosity\u2019s\nexploration of the martian surface can be viewed as well.\nMartian Samples\nMuch of what we know of the Moon, including the circumstances of its origin, comes from studies of lunar\nsamples, but spacecraft have not yet returned martian samples to Earth for laboratory analysis. It is with great\ninterest, therefore, that scientists have discovered that samples of martian material are nevertheless already 328 10 \u2022 Earthlike Planets: Venus and Mars\nhere on Earth, available for study. These are all members of a rare class ofmeteorites(Figure 10.16)\u2014rocks\nthat have fallen from space.\nFigure10.16Martian Meteorite.This fragment of basalt, ejected from Mars in a crater-forming impact, eventually arrived on\nEarth\u2019s surface. (credit: NASA)\nHow would rocks have escaped from Mars? Many impacts have occurred on the red planet, as shown by its\nheavily cratered surface. Fragments blasted from large impacts can escape from Mars, whose surface gravity\nis only 38% of Earth\u2019s. A long time later (typically a few million years), a very small fraction of these fragments\ncollide with Earth and survive their passage through our atmosphere, just like other meteorites. (We\u2019ll discuss\nmeteorites in more detail in the chapter onCosmic Samples and the Origin of the Solar System.) By the way,\nrocks from the Moon have also reached our planet as meteorites, although we were able to demonstrate their\nlunar origin only by comparison with samples returned by the Apollo missions\nMost of themartian meteoritesare volcanic basalts; most of them are also relatively young\u2014about 1.3 billion\nyears old. We know from details of their composition that they are not from Earth or the Moon. Besides, there\nwas no volcanic activity on the Moon to form them as recently as 1.3 billion years ago. It would be very difficult\nfor ejecta from impacts on Venus to escape through its thick atmosphere. By the process of elimination, the\nonly reasonable origin seems to be Mars, where the Tharsis volcanoes were active at that time.\nThe martian origin of these meteorites was confirmed by the analysis of tiny gas bubbles trapped inside\nseveral of them. These bubbles match the atmospheric properties of Mars as first measured directly by Viking.\nIt appears that some atmospheric gas was trapped in the rock by the shock of the impact that ejected it from\nMars and started it on its way toward Earth.\nOne of the most exciting results from analysis of these martian samples has been the discovery of both water\nand organic (carbon-based) compounds in them, which suggests that Mars may once have had oceans and\nperhaps even life on its surface. As we have already hinted, there is other evidence for the presence of flowing\nwater on Mars in the remote past, and even extending to the present.\nIn this and the following sections, we will summarize the picture of Mars as revealed by all these exploratory\nmissions and by about 40 samples from Mars.\nGlobal Properties of Mars\nMarshas a diameter of 6790 kilometers, just over half the diameter of Earth, giving it a total surface area very\nnearly equal to the continental (land) area of our planet. Its overall density of 3.9 g/cm3suggests a\ncomposition consisting primarily of silicates but with a small metal core. The planet has no global magnetic\nfield, although there are areas of strong surface magnetization that indicate that there was a global field\nbillions of years ago. Apparently, the red planet has no liquid material in its core today that would conduct\nelectricity.\nThanks to theMars Global Surveyor, we have mapped the entire planet, as shown inFigure 10.17. A laser\naltimeter on board made millions of separate measurements of the surface topography to a precision of a few\nmeters\u2014good enough to show even the annual deposition and evaporation of the polar caps. Like Earth, the\nMoon, and Venus, the surface of Mars has continental or highland areas as well as widespread volcanic plains.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.4 \u2022 The Geology of Mars 329\nThe total range in elevation from the top of the highest mountain (Olympus Mons) to the bottom of the\ndeepest basin (Hellas) is 31 kilometers.\nFigure10.17Mars Map from Laser Ranging.These globes are highly precise topographic maps, reconstructed from millions of\nindividual elevation measurements made with theMars Global Surveyor. Color is used to indicate elevation. The hemisphere on the\nleft includes the Tharsis bulge andOlympus Mons, the highest mountain on Mars; the hemisphere on the right includes the Hellas\nbasin, which has the lowest elevation on Mars. (credit: modification of work by NASA/JPL)\nApproximately half the planet consists of heavily cratered highland terrain, found primarily in the southern\nhemisphere. The other half, which is mostly in the north, contains younger, lightly cratered volcanic plains at\nan average elevation about 5 kilometers lower than the highlands. Remember that we saw a similar pattern on\nEarth, the Moon, and Venus. A geological division into older highlands and younger lowland plains seems to\nbe characteristic of all the terrestrial planets except Mercury.\nLying across the north-south division of Mars is an uplifted continent the size of North America. This is the\n10-kilometer-high Tharsis bulge, a volcanic region crowned by four great volcanoes that rise still higher into\nthe martian sky.\nVolcanoes on Mars\nThe lowland plains ofMarslook very much like the lunar maria, and they have about the same density of\nimpact craters. Like the lunar maria, they probably formed between 3 and 4 billion years ago. Apparently, Mars\nexperienced extensive volcanic activity at about the same time the Moon did, producing similar basaltic lavas.\nThe largest volcanic mountains of Mars are found in the Tharsis area (you can see them inFigure 10.17),\nalthough smaller volcanoes dot much of the surface. The most dramatic volcano on Mars isOlympus Mons\n(Mount Olympus), with a diameter larger than 500 kilometers and a summit that towers more than 20\nkilometers above the surrounding plains\u2014three times higher than the tallest mountain on Earth (Figure\n10.18). The volume of this immense volcano is nearly 100 times greater than that of Mauna Loa in Hawaii.\nPlaced on Earth\u2019s surface, Olympus would more than cover the entire state of Missouri. 330 10 \u2022 Earthlike Planets: Venus and Mars\nFigure10.18Olympus Mons.The largest volcano on Mars, and probably the largest in the solar system, isOlympus Mons,\nillustrated in this computer-generated rendering based on data from theMars Global Surveyor\u2019slaser altimeter. Placed on Earth, the\nbase of Olympus Mons would completely cover the state of Missouri; the caldera, the circular opening at the top, is 65 kilometers\nacross, about the size of Los Angeles. (credit: NASA/Corbis)\nImages taken from orbit allow scientists to search for impact craters on the slopes of these volcanoes in order\nto estimate their age. Many of the volcanoes show a fair number of such craters, suggesting that they ceased\nactivity a billion years or more ago. However, Olympus Mons has very, very few impact craters. Its present\nsurface cannot be more than about 100 million years old; it may even be much younger. Some of the fresh-\nlooking lava flows might have been formed a hundred years ago, or a thousand, or a million, but geologically\nspeaking, they are quite young. This leads geologists to the conclusion that Olympus Mons possibly remains\nintermittently active today\u2014something future Mars land developers may want to keep in mind.\nMartian Cracks and Canyons\nThe Tharsis bulge has many interesting geological features in addition to its huge volcanoes. In this part of the\nplanet, the surface itself has bulged upward, forced by great pressures from below, resulting in extensive\ntectonic cracking of the crust. Among the most spectacular tectonic features on Mars are the canyons called\ntheValles Marineris(or Mariner Valleys, named after Mariner 9, which first revealed them to us), which are\nshown inFigure 10.19. They extend for about 5000 kilometers (nearly a quarter of the way around Mars) along\nthe slopes of the Tharsis bulge. If it were on Earth, this canyon system would stretch all the way from Los\nAngeles to Washington, DC. The main canyon is about 7 kilometers deep and up to 100 kilometers wide, large\nenough for the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River to fit comfortably into one of its side canyons. Viewers of\nthe movie \u201cThe Martian\u201d can see a recreation of these canyonlands, as the film\u2019s hero takes a long trip\nthrough a spectacular (and somewhat exaggerated) presentation of this part of Mars.\nFigure10.19Heavily Eroded Canyonlands on Mars.This image shows theValles Marineriscanyon complex, which is 3000\nkilometers long and 8 kilometers deep.

They are basically tectonic cracks, produced by the same crustal tensions that\ncaused the Tharsis uplift. However, water has played a later role in shaping the canyons, primarily by seeping\nfrom deep springs and undercutting the cliffs. This undercutting led to landslides that gradually widened the\noriginal cracks into the great valleys we see today (Figure 10.20). Today, the primary form of erosion in the\ncanyons is probably wind.\nFigure10.20Martian Landslides.This Viking orbiter image shows Ophir Chasma, one of the connected valleys of theValles\nMarineriscanyon system. Look carefully and you can see enormous landslides whose debris is piled up underneath the cliff wall,\nwhich tower up to 10 kilometers above the canyon floor. (credit: modification of work by NASA/JPL/USGS)\nWhile the Tharsis bulge and Valles Marineris are impressive, in general, we see fewer tectonic structures on\nMars than on Venus. In part, this may reflect a lower general level of geological activity, as would be expected\nfor a smaller planet. But it is also possible that evidence of widespread faulting has been buried by wind-\ndeposited sediment over much of Mars. Like Earth, Mars may have hidden part of its geological history under\na cloak of soil.\nThe View on the Martian Surface\nThe first spacecraft to land successfully onMarswere Vikings 1 and 2 and Mars Pathfinder. All sent back\nphotos that showed a desolate but strangely beautiful landscape, including numerous angular rocks\ninterspersed with dune like deposits of fine-grained, reddish soil (Figure 10.21). 332 10 \u2022 Earthlike Planets: Venus and Mars\nFigure10.21Three Martian Landing Sites.The Mars landers Viking 1 in Chryse, Pathfinder in Ares Valley, and Viking 2 in Utopia, all\nphotographed their immediate surroundings. It is apparent from the similarity of these three photos that each spacecraft touched\ndown on a flat, windswept plain littered with rocks ranging from tiny pebbles up to meter-size boulders. It is probable that most of\nMars looks like this on the surface. (credit \u201cViking 1\u201d: modification of work by Van der Hoorn/NASA; credit \u201cPathfinder\u201d: modification\nof work by NASA; credit \u201cViking 2\u201d: modification of work by NASA; credit Mars: modification of work by NASA/Goddard Space Flight\nCenter)\nAll three of these landers were targeted to relatively flat, lowland terrain. Instruments on the landers found\nthat the soil consisted of clays and iron oxides, as had long been expected from the red color of the planet. All\nthe rocks measured appeared to be of volcanic origin and roughly the same composition. Later landers were\ntargeted to touch down in areas that apparently were flooded sometime in the past, where sedimentary rock\nlayers, formed in the presence of water, are common. (Although we should note that nearly all the planet is\nblanketed in at least a thin layer of wind-blown dust).\nThe Viking landers included weather stations that operated for several years, providing a perspective on\nmartian weather. The temperatures they measured varied greatly with the seasons, due to the absence of\nmoderating oceans and clouds. Typically, the summer maximum at Viking 1 was 240 K (\u201333 \u00b0C), dropping to\n190 K (\u201383 \u00b0C) at the same location just before dawn. The lowest air temperatures, measured farther north by\nViking 2, were about 173 K (\u2013100 \u00b0C). During the winter, Viking 2 also photographed water frost deposits on the\nground (Figure 10.22). We make a point of saying \u201cwater frost\u201d here because at some locations on Mars, it\ngets cold enough for carbon dioxide (dry ice) to freeze out of the atmosphere as well.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.4 \u2022 The Geology of Mars 333\nFigure10.22Water Frost in Utopia.This image of surface frost was photographed at the Viking 2 landing site during late winter.\n(credit: NASA/JPL)\nMost of the winds measured on Mars are only a few kilometers per hour. However, Mars is capable of great\nwindstorms that can shroud the entire planet with windblown dust. Such high winds can strip the surface of\nsome of its loose, fine dust, leaving the rock exposed. The later rovers found that each sunny afternoon the\natmosphere became turbulent as heat rose off the surface. This turbulence generated dust devils, which play\nan important role in lifting the fine dust into the atmosphere. As the dust devils strip off the top layer of light\ndust and expose darker material underneath, they can produce fantastic patterns on the ground (Figure\n10.23).\nWind on Mars plays an important role in redistributing surface material.Figure 10.23shows a beautiful area of\ndark sand dunes on top of lighter material. Much of the material stripped out of the martian canyons has been\ndumped in extensive dune fields like this, mostly at high latitudes.\nFigure10.23Dust Devil Tracks and Sand Dunes.(a) This high-resolution photo from theMars Global Surveyorshows the dark\ntracks of several dust devils that have stripped away a thin coating of light-colored dust. This view is of an area about 3 kilometers 334 10 \u2022 Earthlike Planets: Venus and Mars\nacross. Dust devils are one of the most important ways that dust gets redistributed by the martian winds. They may also help keep\nthe solar panels of our rovers free of dust. (b) These windblown sand dunes on Mars overlay a lighter sandy surface. Each dune in\nthis high-resolution view is about 1 kilometer across.

But where\n(and how) should we look for life? We know that the one requirement shared by all life on Earth is liquid water.\nTherefore, the guiding principle in assessing habitability on Mars and elsewhere has been to \u201cfollow the\nwater.\u201d That is the perspective we take in this section, to follow the water on the red planet and hope it will\nlead us to life.\nAtmosphere and Clouds on Mars\nThe atmosphere ofMarstoday has an average surface pressure of only 0.007 bar, less than 1% that of Earth.\n(This is how thin the air is about 30 kilometers above Earth\u2019s surface.) Martian air is composed primarily of\ncarbon dioxide (95%), with about 3% nitrogen and 2% argon. The proportions of different gases are similar to\nthose in the atmosphere of Venus (seeTable 10.2), but a lot less of each gas is found in the thin air on Mars.\nWhile winds on Mars can reach high speeds, they exert much less force than wind of the same velocity would\non Earth because the atmosphere is so thin. The wind is able, however, to loft very fine dust particles, which\ncan sometimes develop planet-wide dust storms. It is this fine dust that coats almost all the surface, giving\nMars its distinctive red color. In the absence of surface water, wind erosion plays a major role in sculpting the\nmartian surface (Figure 10.24).\nFigure10.24Wind Erosion on Mars.These long straight ridges, called yardangs, are aligned with the dominant wind direction. This\nis a high-resolution image from theMars Reconnaissance Orbiterand is about 1 kilometer wide. (credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/University\nof Arizona)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe issue of how strong the winds on Mars can be plays a big role in the2015 hit movieThe Martian\n(https://openstax.org/l/30TheMartian)in which the main character is stranded on Mars after being buried\nin the sand in a windstorm so great that his fellow astronauts have to leave the planet so their ship is not\ndamaged. Astronomers have noted that the martian winds could not possibly be as forceful as depicted in\nthe film because the air pressure is so low. In most ways, however, the depiction of Mars in this movie is\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.5 \u2022 Water and Life on Mars 335\nremarkably accurate.\nAlthough the atmosphere contains small amounts of water vapor and occasional clouds of water ice, liquid\nwater is not stable under present conditions on Mars. Part of the problem is the low temperatures on the\nplanet. But even if the temperature on a sunny summer day rises above the freezing point, the low pressure\nmeans that liquid water still cannot exist on the surface, except at the lowest elevations. At a pressure of less\nthan 0.006 bar, the boiling point is as low or lower than the freezing point, and water changes directly from\nsolid to vapor without an intermediate liquid state (as does \u201cdry ice,\u201d carbon dioxide, on Earth). However, salts\ndissolved in water lower its freezing point, as we know from the way salt is used to thaw roads after snow and\nice forms during winter on Earth. Salty water is therefore sometimes able to exist in liquid form on the martian\nsurface, under the right conditions.\nSeveral types of clouds can form in the martian atmosphere. First there are dust clouds, discussed above.\nSecond are water-ice clouds similar to those on Earth. These often form around mountains, just as happens on\nour planet. Finally, the CO of the atmosphere can itself condense at high altitudes to form hazes of dry ice\n2\ncrystals. The CO clouds have no counterpart on Earth, since on our planet temperatures never drop low\n2\nenough (down to about 150 K or about \u2013125 \u00b0C) for this gas to condense.\nThe Polar Caps\nThrough a telescope, the most prominent surface features on Mars are the bright polar caps, which change\nwith the seasons, similar to the seasonal snow cover on Earth. We do not usually think of the winter snow in\nnorthern latitudes as a part of our polar caps, but seen from space, the thin winter snow merges with Earth\u2019s\nthick, permanent ice caps to create an impression much like that seen on Mars (Figure 10.25).\nFigure10.25Martian North Polar Cap.(a) This is a composite image of the north pole in summer, obtained in October 2006 by the\nMars Reconnaissance Orbiter. It shows the mostly water-ice residual cap sitting atop light, tan-colored, layered sediments. Note that\nalthough the border of this photo is circular, it shows only a small part of the planet. (b) Here we see a small section of the layered\nterrain near the martian north pole. There is a mound about 40 meters high that is sticking out of a trough in the center of the\npicture. (credit a: modification of work by NASA/JPL/MSSS; credit b: modification of work by NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona)\nTheseasonal capson Mars are composed not of ordinary snow but of frozen CO (dry ice). These deposits\n2\ncondense directly from the atmosphere when the surface temperature drops below about 150 K. The caps\ndevelop during the cold martian winters and extend down to about 50\u00b0 latitude by the start of spring.\nQuite distinct from these thin seasonal caps of CO are thepermanentorresidual capsthat are always present\n2\nnear the poles. The southern permanent cap has a diameter of 350 kilometers and is composed of frozen CO\n2\ndeposits together with a great deal of water ice. Throughout the southern summer, it remains at the freezing 336 10 \u2022 Earthlike Planets: Venus and Mars\npoint of CO , 150 K, and this cold reservoir is thick enough to survive the summer heat intact.\n2\nThe northern permanent cap is different. It is much larger, never shrinking to a diameter less than 1000\nkilometers, and is composed of water ice. Summer temperatures in the north are too high for the frozen CO\n2\nto be retained. Measurements from theMars Global Surveyorhave established the exact elevations in the\nnorth polar region of Mars, showing that it is a large basin about the size of our own Arctic Ocean basin. The\nice cap itself is about 3 kilometers thick, with a total volume of about 10 million km3(similar to that of Earth\u2019s\nMediterranean Sea). If Mars ever had extensive liquid water, this north polar basin would have contained a\nshallow sea. There is some indication of ancient shorelines visible, but better images will be required to verify\nthis suggestion.\nImages taken from orbit also show a distinctive type of terrain surrounding the permanent polar caps, as\nshown inFigure 10.25. At latitudes above 80\u00b0 in both hemispheres, the surface consists of recent layered\ndeposits that cover the older cratered ground below. Individual layers are typically ten to a few tens of meters\nthick, marked by alternating light and dark bands of sediment. Probably the material in the polar deposits\nincludes dust carried by wind from the equatorial regions of Mars.\nWhat do these terraced layers tell us about Mars? Some cyclic process is depositing dust and ice over periods\nof time. The time scales represented by the polar layers are tens of thousands of years. Apparently the martian\nclimate experiences periodic changes at intervals similar to those between ice ages on Earth. Calculations\nindicate that the causes are probably also similar: the gravitational pull of the other planets produces\nvariations in Mars\u2019 orbit and tilt as the great clockwork of the solar system goes through its paces.\nThePhoenixspacecraft landed near the north polar cap in summer (Figure 10.26). Controllers knew that it\nwould not be able to survive a polar winter, but directly measuring the characteristics of the polar region was\ndeemed important enough to send a dedicated mission. The most exciting discovery came when the\nspacecraft tried to dig a shallow trench under the spacecraft. When the overlying dust was stripped off, they\nsaw bright white material, apparently some kind of ice. From the way this ice sublimated over the next few\ndays, it was clear that it was frozen water.\nFigure10.26Evaporating Ice on Mars.We see a trench dug by thePhoenixlander in the north polar region four martian days apart\nin June 2008. If you look at the shadowed region in the bottom left of the trench, you can see three spots of ice in the left image\nwhich have sublimated away in the right image.

In each case, we can find the total volume of a layer on a sphere by multiplying\nthe area of the sphere (4\u03c0R2) by the thickness of the layer. For Earth, the ocean water is equivalent to a\nlayer 3 km thick spread over the entire planet, and the radius of Earth is 6.378 \u00d7 106m (seeAppendix F). For\nMars, most of the water we are sure of is in the form of ice near the poles. We can calculate the amount of\nice in one of the residual polar caps if it is (for example) 2 km thick and has a radius of 400 km (the area of a\ncircle is \u03c0R2).\nSolution\nThe volume of Earth\u2019s water is therefore the area 4\u03c0R2\nmultiplied by the thickness of 3000 m:\nThis gives 1.5 \u00d7 1018m3of water. Since water has a density of 1 ton per cubic meter (1000 kg/m3), we can\ncalculate the mass:\nFor Mars, the ice doesn\u2019t cover the whole planet, only the caps; the polar cap area is\n(Note that we converted kilometers to meters.)\nThe volume = area \u00d7 height, so we have:\nTherefore, the mass is:\nThis is about 0.1% that of Earth\u2019s oceans.\nCheck Your Learning\nA better comparison might be to compare the amount of ice in the Mars polar ice caps to the amount of ice\nin the Greenland ice sheet on Earth, which has been estimated as 2.85 \u00d7 1015m3. How does this compare\nwith the ice on Mars?\nAnswer:\nThe Greenland ice sheet has about 2.85 times as much ice as in the polar ice caps on Mars. They are about\nthe same to the nearest power of 10.\nChannels and Gullies on Mars\nAlthough no bodies of liquid water exist onMarstoday, evidence has accumulated that rivers flowed on the\nred planet long ago. Two kinds of geological features appear to be remnants of ancient watercourses, while a\nthird class\u2014smaller gullies\u2014suggests intermittent outbreaks of liquid water even today. We will examine each 338 10 \u2022 Earthlike Planets: Venus and Mars\nof these features in turn.\nIn the highland equatorial plains, there are multitudes of small, sinuous (twisting) channels\u2014typically a few\nmeters deep, some tens of meters wide, and perhaps 10 or 20 kilometers long (Figure 10.27). They are called\nrunoff channels because they look like what geologists would expect from the surface runoff of ancient rain\nstorms. These runoff channels seem to be telling us that the planet had a very different climate long ago. To\nestimate the age of these channels, we look at the cratering record. Crater counts show that this part of the\nplanet is more cratered than the lunar maria but less cratered than the lunar highlands. Thus, the runoff\nchannels are probably older than the lunar maria, presumably about 4 billion years old.\nThe second set of water-related features we see areoutflow channels(Figure 10.27) are much larger than the\nrunoff channels. The largest of these, which drain into the Chryse basin where Pathfinder landed, are 10\nkilometers or more wide and hundreds of kilometers long. Many features of these outflow channels have\nconvinced geologists that they were carved by huge volumes of running water, far too great to be produced by\nordinary rainfall. Where could such floodwater have come from on Mars?\nFigure10.27Runoff and Outflow Channels.(a) These runoff channels in the old martian highlands are interpreted as the valleys of\nancient rivers fed by either rain or underground springs. The width of this image is about 200 kilometers. (b) This intriguing channel,\ncalled Nanedi Valles, resembles Earth riverbeds in some (but not all) ways. The tight curves and terraces seen in the channel certainly\nsuggest the sustained flow of a fluid like water. The channel is about 2.5 kilometers across. (credit a: modification of work by Jim\nSecosky/NASA; credit b: modification of work by Jim Secosky/NASA)\nAs far we can tell, the regions where the outflow channels originate contained abundant water frozen in the\nsoil as permafrost. Some local source of heating must have released this water, leading to a period of rapid\nand catastrophic flooding. Perhaps this heating was associated with the formation of the volcanic plains on\nMars, which date back to roughly the same time as the outflow channels.\nNote that neither the runoff channels nor the outflow channels are wide enough to be visible from Earth, nor\ndo they follow straight lines. They could not have been the \u201ccanals\u201d Percival Lowell imagined seeing on the red\nplanet.\nThe third type of water feature, the smallergullies, was discovered by theMars Global Surveyor(Figure 10.28).\nTheMars Global Surveyor\u2019scamera images achieved a resolution of a few meters, good enough to see\nsomething as small as a truck or bus on the surface. On the steep walls of valleys and craters at high latitudes,\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.5 \u2022 Water and Life on Mars 339\nthere are many erosional features that look like gullies carved by flowing water. These gullies are very young:\nnot only are there no superimposed impact craters, but in some instances, the gullies seem to cut across\nrecent wind-deposited dunes. Perhaps there is liquid water underground that can occasionally break out to\nproduce short-lived surface flows before the water can freeze or evaporate.\nFigure10.28Gullies on the Wall of Garni Crater.This high-resolution image is from theMars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The dark\nstreaks, which are each several hundred meters long, change in a seasonal pattern that suggests they are caused by the temporary\nflow of surface water. (credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona)\nThe gullies also have the remarkable property of changing regularly with the martian seasons. Many of the\ndark streaks (visible inFigure 10.28) elongate within a period of a few days, indicating that something is\nflowing downhill\u2014either water or dark sediment. If it is water, it requires a continuing source, either from the\natmosphere or from springs that tap underground water layers (aquifers.) Underground water would be the\nmost exciting possibility, but this explanation seems inconsistent with the fact that many of the dark streaks\nstart at high elevations on the walls of craters.\nAdditional evidence that the dark streaks (called by the scientistsrecurring slope lineae) are caused by water\nwas found in 2015 when spectra were obtained of the dark streaks (Figure 10.29). These showed the presence\nof hydrated salts produced by the evaporation of salty water. If the water is salty, it could remain liquid long\nenough to flow downstream for distances of a hundred meters or more, before it either evaporates or soaks\ninto the ground. However, this discovery still does not identify the ultimate source of the water. 340 10 \u2022 Earthlike Planets: Venus and Mars\nFigure10.29Evidence for Liquid Water on Mars.The dark streaks in Horowitz crater, which move downslope, have been called\nrecurring slope lineae. The streaks in the center of the image go down the wall of the crater for about a distance of 100 meters.\nSpectra taken of this region indicate that these are locations where salty liquid water flows on or just below the surface of Mars. (The\nvertical dimension is exaggerated by a factor of 1.5 compared to horizontal dimensions.) (credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of\nArizona)\nAncient Lakes and Glaciers\nThe rovers (Spirit,Opportunity,Curiosity, andPerseverance,, that have operated on the surface of Mars have\nbeen used to hunt for additional evidence of water. They could not reach the most interesting sites, such as\nthe gullies, which are located on steep slopes. Instead, they explored sites that might be dried-out lake beds,\ndating back to a time when the climate on Mars was warmer and the atmosphere thicker\u2014allowing water to\nbe liquid on the surface.\nSpiritwas specifically targeted to explore what looked like an ancient lake-bed in Gusev crater, with an outflow\nchannel emptying into it. However, when the spacecraft landed, it found that the former lakebed had been\ncovered by thin lava flows, blocking the rover from access to the sedimentary rocks it had hoped to find.\nHowever,Opportunityhad better luck. Peering at the walls of a small crater, it detected layered sedimentary\nrock. These rocks contained chemical evidence of evaporation, suggesting there had been a shallow salty lake\nin that location. In these sedimentary rocks were also small spheres that were rich in the mineral hematite,\nwhich forms only in watery environments. Apparently this very large basin had once been underwater.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe small spherical rocks were nicknamed \u201cblueberries\u201d by the science team and the discovery of a whole\n\u201cberry-bowl\u201d of them was announced in thisinteresting news release(https://openstax.org/l/30berrybowl)\nfrom NASA.\nTheCuriosityrover landed inside Gale crater, where photos taken from orbit also suggested past water\nerosion. It discovered numerous sedimentary rocks, some in the form of mudstones from an ancient lakebed;\nit also found indications of rocks formed by the action of shallow water at the time the sediment formed\n(Figure 10.30).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.5 \u2022 Water and Life on Mars 341\nEven today there is evidence of large quantities of ice just below the surface of Mars. In the mid-latitudes,\nhigh-resolution photos from orbit have revealed glaciers covered with dirt and dust. In some cliffs, the ice is\nobserved directly (seeFigure 10.30).Perseveranceis exploring the 45-km-wide crater Jezero, which is a dusty\nformer lakebed and river delta with evidence of large rocks deposited by ancient floods. These glaciers are\nthought to have formed during warm periods, when the atmospheric pressure was greater and snow and ice\ncould precipitate. They also suggest readily available frozen water that could support future human\nexploration of the planet.\nFigure10.30Gale Crater and Underground Ice Deposits.(a) This scene, photographed by theCuriosityrover, shows an ancient\nlakebed of cracked mudstones. (b) Geologists working with theCuriosityrover interpret this image of cross-bedded sandstone in\nGale crater as evidence of liquid water passing over a loose bed of sediment at the time this rock formed. (c) Ice bands a hundred\nmeters tall are visible in blue in a cliff-face on Mars, suggesting large deposits of frozen water buried just a few meters below the\nsurface. Note that the blue color has been exaggerated in this photo, taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft.

We humans have developed great skill in recognizing people and interpreting\nfacial expressions. We also have a tendency to see faces in many natural formations, from clouds to the\nman in the Moon. One of the curiosities that emerged from the Viking orbiters\u2019 global mapping of Mars\nwas the discovery of a strangely shaped mesa in the Cydonia region that resembled a human face. Despite\nlater rumors of a cover-up, the \u201cFace on Mars\u201d was, in fact, recognized by Viking scientists and included in\none of the early mission press releases. At the low resolution and oblique lighting under which the Viking\nimage was obtained, the mile-wide mesa had something of a Sphinx-like appearance. 342 10 \u2022 Earthlike Planets: Venus and Mars\nUnfortunately, a small band of individuals decided that this formation was an artificial, carved sculpture of a\nhuman face placed on Mars by an ancient civilization that thrived there hundreds of thousands of years\nago. A band of \u201ctrue believers\u201d grew around the face and tried to deduce the nature of the \u201csculptors\u201d who\nmade it. This group also linked the face to a variety of other pseudoscientific phenomena such as crop\ncircles (patterns in fields of grain, mostly in Britain, now known to be the work of pranksters).\nMembers of this group accused NASA of covering up evidence of intelligent life on Mars, and they received\na great deal of help in publicizing their perspective from tabloid media. Some of the believers picketed the\nJet Propulsion Laboratory at the time of the failure of theMars Observerspacecraft, circulating stories that\nthe \u201cfailure\u201d of theMars Observerwas itself a fake, and that its true (secret) mission was to photograph the\nface.\nThe high-resolutionMars Observercamera (MOC) was reflown on theMars Global Surveyormission, which\narrived at Mars in 1997. On April 5, 1998, in Orbit 220, the MOC obtained an oblique image of the face at a\nresolution of 4 meters per pixel, a factor-of-10 improvement in resolution over the Viking image. Another\nimage in 2001 had even higher resolution. Immediately released by NASA, the new images showed a low\nmesa-like hill cut crossways by several roughly linear ridges and depressions, which were misidentified in\nthe 1976 photo as the eyes and mouth of a face. Only with an enormous dose of imagination can any\nresemblance to a face be seen in the new images, demonstrating how dramatically our interpretation of\ngeology can change with large improvements in resolution. The original and the higher resolution images\ncan be seen inFigure 10.31.\nFigure10.31Face on Mars.The so-called \u201cFace on Mars\u201d is seen (a) in low resolution from Viking (the \u201cface\u201d is in the upper part\nof the picture) and (b) with 20 times better resolution from theMars Global Surveyor. (credit a: modification of work NASA/JPL;\ncredit b: modification of work by NASA/JPL/MSSS)\nAfter 20 years of promoting pseudoscientific interpretations and various conspiracy theories, can the \u201cFace\non Mars\u201d believers now accept reality? Unfortunately, it does not seem so. They have accused NASA of\nfaking the new picture. They also suggest that the secret mission of theMars Observerincluded a nuclear\nbomb used to destroy the face before it could be photographed in greater detail by theMars Global\nSurveyor.\nSpace scientists find these suggestions incredible. NASA is spending increasing sums for research on life in\nthe universe, and a major objective of current and upcoming Mars missions is to search for evidence of past\nmicrobial life on Mars. Conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial life would be one of the great discoveries of\nscience and incidentally might well lead to increased funding for NASA. The idea that NASA or other\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.5 \u2022 Water and Life on Mars 343\ngovernment agencies would (or could) mount a conspiracy to suppress such welcome evidence is truly\nbizarre.\nAlas, the \u201cFace on Mars\u201d story is only one example of a whole series of conspiracy theories that are kept\nbefore the public by dedicated believers, by people out to make a fast buck, and by irresponsible media\nattention. Others include the \u201curban legend\u201d that the Air Force has the bodies of extraterrestrials at a\nsecret base, the widely circulated report that UFOs crashed near Roswell, New Mexico (actually it was a\nballoon carrying scientific instruments to find evidence of Soviet nuclear tests), or the notion that alien\nastronauts helped build the Egyptian pyramids and many other ancient monuments because our ancestors\nwere too stupid to do it alone.\nIn response to the increase in publicity given to these \u201cfiction science\u201d ideas, a group of scientists,\neducators, scholars, and magicians (who know a good hoax when they see one) have formed the\nCommittee for Skeptical Inquiry. Two of the original authors of your book are active on the committee. For\nmore information about its work delving into the rational explanations for paranormal claims, see their\nexcellent magazine,The Skeptical Inquirer, or check out their website athttps://skepticalinquirer.org/\n(https://skepticalinquirer.org/).\nClimate Change on Mars\nThe evidence about ancient rivers and lakes of water onMarsdiscussed so far suggests that, billions of years\nago, martian temperatures must have been warmer and the atmosphere must have been more substantial\nthan it is today. But what could have changed the climate on Mars so dramatically?\nWe presume that, like Earth and Venus, Mars probably formed with a higher surface temperature thanks to\nthe greenhouse effect. But Mars is a smaller planet, and its lower gravity means that atmospheric gases could\nescape more easily than from Earth and Venus. As more and more of the atmosphere escaped into space, the\ntemperature on the surface gradually fell.\nEventually Mars became so cold that most of the water froze out of the atmosphere, further reducing its ability\nto retain heat. The planet experienced a sort ofrunaway refrigerator effect, just the opposite of the runaway\ngreenhouse effect that occurred on Venus. Probably, this loss of atmosphere took place within less than a\nbillion years after Mars formed. The result is the cold, dry Mars we see today.\nConditions a few meters below the martian surface, however, may be much different. There, liquid water\n(especially salty water) might persist, kept warm by the internal heat of Mars or the insulating layers solid and\nrock. Even on the surface, there may be ways to change the martian atmosphere temporarily.\nMars is likely to experience long-term climate cycles, which may be caused by the changing orbit and tilt of the\nplanet. At times, one or both of the polar caps might melt, releasing a great deal of water vapor into the\natmosphere. Perhaps an occasional impact by a comet might produce a temporary atmosphere that is thick\nenough to permit liquid water on the surface for a few weeks or months. Some have even suggested that\nfuture technology might allow us toterraformMars\u2014that is, to engineer its atmosphere and climate in ways\nthat might make the planet more hospitable for long-term human habitation.\nThe Search for Life on Mars\nIf there was running water on Mars in the past, perhaps there was life as well. Could life, in some form, remain\nin the martian soil today? Testing this possibility, however unlikely, was one of the primary objectives of the\nViking landers in 1976. These landers carried miniature biological laboratories to test for microorganisms in\nthe martian soil. Martian soil was scooped up by the spacecraft\u2019s long arm and placed into the experimental\nchambers, where it was isolated and incubated in contact with a variety of gases, radioactive isotopes, and\nnutrients to see what would happen. The experiments looked for evidence ofrespirationby living animals, 344 10 \u2022 Earthlike Planets: Venus and Mars\nabsorptionofnutrientsoffered to organisms that might be present, and anexchange of gasesbetween the\nsoil and its surroundings for any reason whatsoever. A fourth instrument pulverized the soil and analyzed it\ncarefully to determine what organic (carbon-bearing) material it contained.\nThe Viking experiments were so sensitive that, had one of the spacecraft landed anywhere on Earth (with the\npossible exception of Antarctica), it would easily have detected life. But, to the disappointment of many\nscientists and members of the public, no life was detected on Mars. The soil tests for absorption of nutrients\nand gas exchange did show some activity, but this was most likely caused by chemical reactions that began as\nwater was added to the soil and had nothing to do with life. In fact, these experiments showed that martian\nsoil seems much more chemically active than terrestrial soils because of its exposure to solar ultraviolet\nradiation (since Mars has no ozone layer).\nThe organic chemistry experiment showed no trace of organic material, which is apparently destroyed on the\nmartian surface by the sterilizing effect of this ultraviolet light. While the possibility of life on the surface has\nnot been eliminated, most experts consider it negligible. Although Mars has the most earthlike environment of\nany planet in the solar system, the sad fact is that nobody seems to be home today, at least on the surface.\nHowever, there is no reason to think that life could not have begun on Mars about 4 billion years ago, at the\nsame time it started on Earth. The two planets had very similar surface conditions then. Thus, the attention of\nscientists has shifted to the search forfossillife on Mars. One of the primary questions to be addressed by\nfuture spacecraft is whether Mars once supported its own life forms and, if so, how this martian life compared\nwith that on our own planet. Future missions will include the return of martian samples selected from\nsedimentary rocks at sites that once held water and thus perhaps ancient life. The most powerful searches for\nmartian life (past or present) will thus be carried out in our laboratories here on Earth.\nMAKING CONNECTIONS\nPlanetary Protection\nWhen scientists begin to search for life on another planet, they must make sure that we do not contaminate\nthe other world with life carried from Earth. At the very beginning of spacecraft exploration on Mars, an\ninternational agreement specified that all landers were to be carefully sterilized to avoid accidentally\ntransplanting terrestrial microbes to Mars. In the case of Viking, we know the sterilization was successful.\nViking\u2019s failure to detect martian organisms also implies that these experiments did not detect hitchhiking\nterrestrial microbes.\nAs we have learned more about the harsh conditions on the martian surface, the sterilization requirements\nhave been somewhat relaxed. It is evident that no terrestrial microbes could grow on the martian surface,\nwith its low temperature, absence of water, and intense ultraviolet radiation. Microbes from Earth might\nsurvive in a dormant, dried state, but they cannot grow and proliferate on Mars.\nThe problem of contaminating Mars will become more serious, however, as we begin to search for life\nbelow the surface, where temperatures are higher and no ultraviolet light penetrates. The situation will be\neven more daunting if we consider human flights to Mars. Any humans will carry with them a multitude of\nterrestrial microbes of all kinds, and it is hard to imagine how we can effectively keep the two biospheres\nisolated from each other if Mars has indigenous life. Perhaps the best situation could be one in which the\ntwo life-forms are so different that each is effectively invisible to the other\u2014not recognized on a chemical\nlevel as living or as potential food.\nThe most immediate issue of public concern is not with the contamination of Mars but with any dangers\nassociated with returning Mars samples to Earth. NASA is committed to the complete biological isolation of\nreturned samples until they are demonstrated to be safe. Even though the chances of contamination are\nAccess for free at openstax.org 10.6 \u2022 Divergent Planetary Evolution 345\nextremely low, it is better to be safe than sorry.\nMost likely there is no danger, even if there is life on Mars and alien microbes hitch a ride to Earth inside\nsome of the returned samples. In fact, Mars is sending samples to Earth all the time in the form of the Mars\nmeteorites. Since some of these microbes (if they exist) could probably survive the trip to Earth inside their\nrocky home, we may have been exposed many times over to martian microbes. Either they do not interact\nwith our terrestrial life, or in effect our planet has already been inoculated against such alien bugs.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nMore than any other planet, Mars has inspired science fiction writers over the years. You can find\nscientifically reasonable stories about Mars in a subject index of such stories online. If you click onMars\n(https://openstax.org/l/30MarsStories)as a topic, you will find stories by a number of space scientists,\nincluding William Hartmann, Geoffrey Landis, and Ludek Pesek.\n10.6 Divergent Planetary Evolution\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nCompare theplanetary evolutionof Venus, Earth, and Mars\nVenus,Mars, and our own planetEarthform a remarkably diverse triad of worlds. Although all three orbit in\nroughly the same inner zone around the Sun and all apparently started with about the same chemical mix of\nsilicates and metals, their evolutionary paths have diverged. As a result, Venus became hot and dry, Mars\nbecame cold and dry, and only Earth ended up with what we consider a hospitable climate.\nWe have discussed the runaway greenhouse effect on Venus and the runaway refrigerator effect on Mars, but\nwe do not understand exactly what started these two planets down these separate evolutionary paths. Was\nEarth ever in danger of a similar fate? Or might it still be diverted onto one of these paths, perhaps due to\nstress on the atmosphere generated by human pollutants? One of the reasons for studying Venus and Mars is\nto seek insight into these questions.\nSome people have even suggested that if we understood the evolution of Mars and Venus better, we could\npossibly reverse their evolution and restore more earthlike environments. While it seems unlikely that humans\ncould ever make either Mars or Venus into a replica of Earth, considering such possibilities is a useful part of\nour more general quest to understand the delicate environmental balance that distinguishes our planet from\nits two neighbors. InCosmic Samples and the Origin of the Solar System, we return to the comparative study\nof the terrestrial planets and their divergent evolutionary histories. 346 10 \u2022 Earthlike Planets: Venus and Mars\nFigure10.32New Vehicles on Mars.(a) TheIngenuityHelicopter flies above the martian surface.

Mars is more tantalizing, with dark markings and polar caps. Early in the twentieth century, it was widely\nbelieved that the \u201ccanals\u201d of Mars indicated intelligent life there. Mars has only 11% the mass of Earth, but\nVenus is nearly our twin in size and mass. Mars rotates in 24 hours and has seasons like Earth; Venus has a\nretrograde rotation period of 243 days. Both planets have been extensively explored by spacecraft.\n10.2The Geology of Venus\nVenus has been mapped by radar, especially with theMagellanspacecraft. Its crust consists of 75% lowland\nlava plains, numerous volcanic features, and many large coronae, which are the expression of subsurface\nvolcanism. The planet has been modified by widespread tectonics driven by mantle convection, forming\ncomplex patterns of ridges and cracks and building high continental regions such as Ishtar. The surface is\nextraordinarily inhospitable, with pressure of 90 bars and temperature of 730 K, but several Russian Venera\nlanders investigated it successfully.\n10.3The Massive Atmosphere of Venus\nThe atmosphere of Venus is 96% CO . Thick clouds at altitudes of 30 to 60 kilometers are made of sulfuric acid,\n2\nand a CO greenhouse effect maintains the high surface temperature. Venus presumably reached its current\n2\nstate from more earthlike initial conditions as a result of a runaway greenhouse effect, which included the loss\nof large quantities of water.\n10.4The Geology of Mars\nMost of what we know about Mars is derived from spacecraft: highly successful orbiters, landers, and rovers.\nWe have also been able to study a few martian rocks that reached Earth as meteorites. Mars has heavily\ncratered highlands in its southern hemisphere, but younger, lower volcanic plains over much of its northern\nhalf. The Tharsis bulge, as big as North America, includes several huge volcanoes; Olympus Mons is more than\n20 kilometers high and 500 kilometers in diameter. The Valles Marineris canyons are tectonic features widened\nby erosion. Early landers revealed only barren, windswept plains, but later missions have visited places with\nmore geological (and scenic) variety. Landing sites have been selected in part to search for evidence of past\nwater.\n10.5Water and Life on Mars\nThe martian atmosphere has a surface pressure of less than 0.01 bar and is 95% CO . It has dust clouds, water\n2\nclouds, and carbon dioxide (dry ice) clouds. Liquid water on the surface is not possible today, but there is\nsubsurface permafrost at high latitudes. Seasonal polar caps are made of dry ice; the northern residual cap is\nwater ice, whereas the southern permanent ice cap is made predominantly of water ice with a covering of\ncarbon dioxide ice. Evidence of a very different climate in the past is found in water erosion features: both\nrunoff channels and outflow channels, the latter carved by catastrophic floods. Our rovers, exploring ancient\nlakebeds and places where sedimentary rock has formed, have found evidence for extensive surface water in\nthe past. Even more exciting are the gullies that seem to show the presence of flowing salty water on the\nsurface today, hinting at near-surface aquifers. The Viking landers searched for martian life in 1976, with 348 10 \u2022 For Further Exploration\nnegative results, but life might have flourished long ago. We have found evidence of water on Mars, but\nfollowing the water has not yet led us to life on that planet.\n10.6Divergent Planetary Evolution\nEarth, Venus, and Mars have diverged in their evolution from what may have been similar beginnings.

Clearly, the good mayor neglected to take an astronomy course\nin college.

Humility.\n\u2014Andrew Ingersoll discussing the results of the Voyager mission in 1986.\nBeyond Mars and the asteroid belt, we encounter a new region of the solar system: the realm of the giants.\nTemperatures here are lower, permitting water and other volatiles to condense as ice. The planets are much\nlarger, distances between them are much greater, and each giant world is accompanied by an extensive\nsystem of moons and rings.\nFrom many perspectives, the outer solar system is where the action is, and the giant planets are the most\nimportant members of the Sun\u2019s family. When compared to these outer giants, the little cinders of rock and\nmetal that orbit closer to the Sun can seem insignificant. These four giant worlds\u2014Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,\nNeptune\u2014are the subjects of this chapter. Their rings, moons, and the dwarf planet Pluto are discussed in a\nlater chapter. 354 11 \u2022 The Giant Planets\n11.1 Exploring the Outer Planets\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nProvide an overview of the composition of the giant planets\nChronicle the robotic exploration of the outer solar system\nSummarize the missions sent to orbit the gas giants\nThegiant planetshold most of the mass in our planetary system. Jupiter alone exceeds the mass of all the\nother planets combined (Figure 11.2). The material available to build these planets can be divided into three\nclasses by what they are made of: \u201cgases,\u201d \u201cices,\u201d and \u201crocks\u201d (seeTable 11.1). The \u201cgases\u201d are primarily\nhydrogen and helium, the most abundant elements in the universe. The way it is used here, the term \u201cices\u201d\nrefers to composition only and not whether a substance is actually in a solid state. \u201cIces\u201d means compounds\nthat form from the next most abundant elements: oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen. Common ices are water,\nmethane, and ammonia, but ices may also include carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and others. \u201cRocks\u201d are\neven less abundant than ices, and include everything else: magnesium, silicon, iron, and so on.\nFigure11.2Jupiter.The Cassini spacecraft imagedJupiteron its way to Saturn in 2012.

The chemistry for all four giant planet atmospheres is\ndominated by hydrogen. This hydrogen caused the chemistry of the outer solar system to becomereducing,\nmeaning that other elements tend to combine with hydrogen first. In the early solar system, most of the\noxygen combined with hydrogen to make H O and was thus unavailable to form the kinds of oxidized\n2\ncompounds with other elements that are more familiar to us in the inner solar system (such as CO ). As a\n2\nresult, the compounds detected in the atmosphere of the giant planets are mostly hydrogen-based gases such\nas methane (CH ) and ammonia (NH ), or more complex hydrocarbons (combinations of hydrogen and\n4 3\ncarbon) such as ethane (C H ) and acetylene (C H ).\n2 6 2 2\nExploration of the Outer Solar System So Far\nEight spacecraft, seven from the United States and one from Europe, have penetrated beyond the asteroid belt\ninto the realm of the giants.Table 11.2summarizes the spacecraft missions to the outer solar system.\nMissions to the Giant Planets\n1\nPlanet Spacecraft Encounter Date Type\nPioneer 10 December 1973 Flyby\nPioneer 11 December 1974 Flyby\nVoyager 1 March 1979 Flyby\nVoyager 2 July 1979 Flyby\nJupiter Ulysses February 1992 Flyby during gravity assist\nGalileo December 1995 Orbiter and probe\nCassini December 2002 Flyby\nNew Horizons February 2007 Flyby during gravity assist\nJuno July 2016 Orbiter\nSaturn Pioneer 11 September 1979 Flyby\nTable11.2\n1 Both the Ulysses and the New Horizons spacecraft (designed to study the Sun and Pluto, respectively) flew past Jupiter for a 356 11 \u2022 The Giant Planets\n1\nPlanet Spacecraft Encounter Date Type\nVoyager 1 November 1980 Flyby\nVoyager 2 August 1981 Flyby\nCassini July 2004 Orbiter\nUranus Voyager 2 January 1986 Flyby\nNeptune Voyager 2 August 1989 Flyby\nTable11.2\nThe challenges of exploring so far away from Earth are considerable. Flight times to the giant planets are\nmeasured in years to decades, rather than the months required to reach Venus or Mars. Even at the speed of\nlight, messages take hours to pass between Earth and the spacecraft. If a problem develops near Saturn, for\nexample, a wait of hours for the alarm to reach Earth and for instructions to be routed back to the spacecraft\ncould spell disaster. Spacecraft to the outer solar system must therefore be highly reliable and capable of a\ngreater degree of independence and autonomy. Outer solar system missions also must carry their own power\nsources since the Sun is too far away to provide enough energy, or else they must have very large arrays of\nsolar cells. Heaters are required to keep instruments at proper operating temperatures, and spacecraft must\nhave radio transmitters powerful enough to send their data to receivers on distant Earth.\nThe first spacecraft to investigate the regions past Mars were the NASA Pioneers 10 and 11, launched in 1972\nand 1973 as pathfinders toJupiter. One of their main objectives was simply to determine whether a spacecraft\ncould actually navigate through the belt of asteroids that lies beyond Mars without getting destroyed by\ncollisions with asteroidal dust. Another objective was to measure the radiation hazards in themagnetosphere\n(or zone of magnetic influence) of Jupiter. Both spacecraft passed through theasteroid beltwithout incident,\nbut the energetic particles in Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field nearly wiped out their electronics, providing information\nnecessary for the safe design of subsequent missions.\nPioneer 10flew past Jupiter in 1973, after which it sped outward toward the limits of the solar system.Pioneer\n11undertook a more ambitious program, using the gravity of Jupiter to aim for Saturn, which it reached in\n1979. The twin Voyager spacecraft launched the next wave of outer planet exploration in 1977. Voyagers 1 and\n2 each carried 11 scientific instruments, including cameras and spectrometers, as well as devices to measure\nthe characteristics of planetary magnetospheres. Since they kept going outward after their planetary\nencounters, these are now the most distant spacecraft ever launched by humanity.\nVoyager 1 reached Jupiter in 1979 and used a gravity assist from that planet to take it on to Saturn in 1980.\nVoyager 2 arrived at Jupiter four months later, but then followed a different path to visit all the outer planets,\nreaching Saturn in 1981, Uranus in 1986, and Neptune in 1989. This trajectory was made possible by the\napproximate alignment of the four giant planets on the same side of the Sun. About once every 175 years,\nthese planets are in such a position, and it allows a single spacecraft to visit them all by using gravity-assisted\nflybys to adjust course for each subsequent encounter; such a maneuver has been nicknamed a \u201cGrand Tour\u201d\nby astronomers.\ngravity boost (gaining energy by \u201cstealing\u201d a little bit from the giant planet\u2019s rotation).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.1 \u2022 Exploring the Outer Planets 357\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe Jet Propulsion Laboratory has a nice video calledVoyager: The Grand Tour(https://openstax.org/l/\n30JPLGrandT)that describes the Voyager mission and what it found.\nMAKING CONNECTIONS\nEngineering and Space Science: Teaching an Old Spacecraft New Tricks\nBy the timeVoyager 2arrived atNeptunein 1989, 12 years after its launch, the spacecraft was beginning to\nshow signs of old age. The arm on which the camera and other instruments were located was \u201carthritic\u201d: it\ncould no longer move easily in all directions. The communications system was \u201chard of hearing\u201d: part of its\nradio receiver had stopped working. The \u201cbrains\u201d had significant \u201cmemory loss\u201d: some of the onboard\ncomputer memory had failed. And the whole spacecraft was beginning to run out of energy: its generators\nhad begun showing serious signs of wear.\nTo make things even more of a challenge, Voyager\u2019s mission at Neptune was in many ways the most\ndifficult of all four flybys. For example, since sunlight at Neptune is 900 times weaker than at Earth, the\nonboard camera had to take much longer exposures in this light-starved environment. This was a nontrivial\nrequirement, given that the spacecraft was hurtling by Neptune at ten times the speed of a rifle bullet.\nThe solution was to swivel the camera backward at exactly the rate that would compensate for the forward\nmotion of the spacecraft. Engineers had to preprogram the ship\u2019s computer to execute an incredibly\ncomplex series of maneuvers for each image. The beautiful Voyager images of Neptune are a testament to\nthe ingenuity of spacecraft engineers.\nThe sheer distance of the craft from its controllers on Earth was yet another challenge. Voyager 2 received\ninstructions and sent back its data via on-board radio transmitter. The distance from Earth to Neptune is\nabout 4.8 billion kilometers. Over this vast distance, the power that reached us from Voyager 2 at Neptune\nwas approximately10\u201316watts, or 20 billion times less power than it takes to operate a digital watch. Thirty-\neight different antennas on four continents were used by NASA to collect the faint signals from the\nspacecraft and decode the precious information about Neptune that they contained.\nEnter the Orbiters: Galileo, Cassini, and Juno\nThe Pioneer and Voyager missions were flybys of the giant planets: they each produced only quick looks\nbefore the spacecraft sped onward. For more detailed studies of these worlds, we require spacecraft that can\ngo into orbit around a planet. For Jupiter and Saturn, these orbiters were the Galileo, Cassini, and Juno\nspacecraft. To date, no orbiter missions have been started for Uranus and Neptune, although planetary\nscientists have expressed keen interest.\nThe Galileo spacecraft was launched toward Jupiter in 1989 and arrived in 1995. Galileo began its investigations\nby deploying an entry probe into Jupiter, for the first direct studies of the planet\u2019s outer atmospheric layers.\nThe probe plunged at a shallow angle into Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere, traveling at a speed of 50 kilometersper\nsecond\u2014that\u2019s fast enough to fly from New York to San Francisco in 100 seconds! This was the highest speed\nat which any probe has so far entered the atmosphere of a planet, and it put great demands on the heat shield\nprotecting it. The high entry speed was a result of acceleration by the strong gravitational attraction of Jupiter.\nAtmospheric friction slowed the probe within 2 minutes, producing temperatures at the front of its heat shield 358 11 \u2022 The Giant Planets\nas high as 15,000 \u00b0C. As the probe\u2019s speed dropped to 2500 kilometers per hour, the remains of the glowing\nheat shield were jettisoned, and a parachute was deployed to lower the instrumented probe spacecraft more\ngently into the atmosphere (Figure 11.3). The data from the probe instruments were relayed to Earth via the\nmain Galileo spacecraft.\nFigure11.3Galileo Probe Falling into Jupiter and Juno Image of Jupiter's South Pole.(a) This artist\u2019s depiction shows the Galileo\nprobe descending into the clouds via parachute just after the protective heat shield separated. The probe made its measurements of\nJupiter\u2019s atmosphere on December 7, 1995. (b) This Juno image, taken in 2017 from about 100,000 kilometers above the cloudtops,\nshows the south polar region of Jupiter with its dramatic complex of storms and clouds. The enhanced-color image was processed\nfor NASA/JPL by citizen scientist John Landino. (credit a: modification of work by NASA/Ames Research Center; credit b: modification\nof work by NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS/John Landino)\nThe probe continued to operate for an hour, descending 200 kilometers into the atmosphere. A few minutes\nlater the polyester parachute melted, and within a few hours the main aluminum and titanium structure of the\nprobe vaporized to become a part of Jupiter itself. About 2 hours after receipt of the final probe data, the main\nspacecraft fired its retro-rockets so it could be captured into orbit around the planet, where its primary\nobjectives were to study Jupiter\u2019s large and often puzzling moons.\nTheCassinimission toSaturn(Figure 11.4), a cooperative venture between NASA and the European Space\nAgency, was similar to Galileo in its two-fold approach. Launched in 1997, Cassini arrived in 2004 and went into\norbit around Saturn, beginning extensive studies of its rings and moons, as well as the planet itself. In January\n2005, Cassini deployed an entry probe into the atmosphere of Saturn\u2019s large moon,Titan, where it successfully\nlanded on the surface. (We\u2019ll discuss the probe and what it found in the chapter onRings, Moons, and Pluto.)\nThe Voyager and Galileo missions to Jupiter were primarily designed to study the moons and the atmosphere\nof the planet. The next NASA mission, an orbiter called Juno, arrived at Jupiter in July 2016. In order to meet its\nobjectives of studying the jovian magnetosphere, it has a very elongated (eccentric) 55-day orbit, that takes it\nfrom 4 thousand kilometers above the cloud tops out to 76 thousand kilometers. The orbit takes the craft over\nJupiter\u2019s poles, giving us remarkable close-ups of the polar regions (previous spacecraft viewed the planet\nfrom lower latitudes).\nJuno was originally designed without a camera, but fortunately scientists rectified this omission, adding a\nsimple downward-looking color camera to use during close passes by Jupiter. Recognizing the value of such\nimages, both scientific and artistic, it was decided to post the raw images and encourage \u201ccitizen scientists\u201d to\nprocess them. The product has been many dramatic, brightly colored views of Jupiter, such asFigure 11.3.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.2 \u2022 The Giant Planets 359\nFigure11.4Earth as Seen from Saturn.This popular Cassini image shows Earth as a tiny dot (marked with an arrow) seen below\nSaturn\u2019s rings.

Our approach is not just to catalog their\ncharacteristics, but to compare them with each other, noting their similarities and differences and attempting\nto relate their properties to their differing masses and distances from the Sun.\nBasic Characteristics\nThegiant planetsare very far from the Sun.Jupiteris more than five times farther from the Sun than Earth\u2019s\ndistance (5 AU), and takes just under 12 years to circle the Sun.Saturnis about twice as far away as Jupiter\n(almost 10 AU) and takes nearly 30 years to complete one orbit.Uranusorbits at 19 AU with a period of 84\nyears, whileNeptune, at 30 AU, requires 165 years for each circuit of the Sun. These long timescales make it\ndifficult for us short-lived humans to study seasonal change on the outer planets.\nJupiter and Saturn have many similarities in composition and internal structure, although Jupiter is nearly four\ntimes more massive. Uranus and Neptune are smaller and differ in composition and internal structure from\ntheir large siblings. Some of the main properties of these four planets are summarized inTable 11.3. 360 11 \u2022 The Giant Planets\nBasic Properties of the Jovian Planets\nPlanet Distance Period Diameter Mass Density Rotation\n(AU) (years) (km) (Earth = 1) (g/cm3) (hours)\nJupiter 5.2 11.9 142,800 318 1.3 9.9\nSaturn 9.5 29.5 120,540 95 0.7 10.7\nUranus 19.2 84.1 51,200 14 1.3 17.2\nNeptune 30.0 164.8 49,500 17 1.6 16.1\nTable11.3\nJupiter, the giant among giants, has enough mass to make 318 Earths. Its diameter is about 11 times that of\nEarth (and about one tenth that of the Sun). Jupiter\u2019s average density is 1.3 g/cm3, much lower than that of any\nof the terrestrial planets. (Recall that water has a density of 1 g/cm3.) Jupiter\u2019s material is spread out over a\nvolume so large that about 1,300 Earths could fit within it.\nSaturn\u2019s mass is 95 times that of Earth, and its average density is only 0.7 g/cm3\u2014the lowest of any planet.\nSince this is less than the density of water, Saturn would be light enough to float.\nUranus and Neptune each have a mass about 15 times that of Earth and, hence, are only 5% as massive as\nJupiter. Their densities of 1.3 g/cm3and 1.6 g/cm3, respectively, are much higher than that of Saturn. This is\none piece of evidence that tells us that their composition must differ fundamentally from the gas giants. When\nastronomers began to discover other planetary systems (exoplanets), we found that planets the size of Uranus\nand Neptune are common, and that there are even more exoplanets intermediate in size between Earth and\nthese ice giants, a type of planet not found in our solar system.\nAppearance and Rotation\nWhen we look at the planets, we see only their atmospheres, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium gas\n(seeFigure 11.1). The uppermost clouds of Jupiter and Saturn, the part we see when looking down at these\nplanets from above, are composed of ammonia crystals. On Neptune, the upper clouds are made of methane.\nOn Uranus, we see no obvious cloud layer at all, but only a deep and featureless haze.\nSeen through a telescope,Jupiteris a colorful and dynamic planet. Distinct details in its cloud patterns allow us\nto determine the rotation rate of its atmosphere at the cloud level, although such atmosphere rotation may\nhave little to do with the spin of the underlying planet. Much more fundamental is the rotation of the mantle\nand core; these can be determined by periodic variations in radio waves coming from Jupiter, which are\ncontrolled by its magnetic field. Since the magnetic field (which we will discuss below) originates deep inside\nthe planet, it shares the rotation of the interior. The rotation period we measure in this way is 9 hours 56\nminutes, which gives Jupiter the shortest \u201cday\u201d of any planet. In the same way, we can measure that the\nunderlying rotation period of Saturn is 10 hours 40 minutes. Uranus and Neptune have slightly longer rotation\nperiods of about 17 hours, also determined from the rotation of their magnetic fields.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nA brief video made from Hubble Space Telescope photos showsthe rotation of Jupiter\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.2 \u2022 The Giant Planets 361\n(https://openstax.org/l/30HSTJupRot)with its many atmospheric features.\nRemember that Earth and Mars have seasons because their spin axes, instead of \u201cstanding up straight,\u201d are\ntilted relative to the orbital plane of the solar system. This means that as Earth revolves around the Sun,\nsometimes one hemisphere and sometimes the other \u201cleans into\u201d the Sun.\nWhat are the seasons like for the giant planets? The spin axis ofJupiteris tilted by only 3\u00b0, so there are no\nseasons to speak of.Saturn, however, does have seasons, since its spin axis is inclined at 27\u00b0 to the\nperpendicular to its orbit.Neptunehas about the same tilt as Saturn (29\u00b0); therefore, it experiences similar\nseasons (only more slowly). The strangest seasons of all are onUranus, which has a spin axis tilted by 98\u00b0 with\nrespect to the north direction. Practically speaking, we can say that Uranus orbits on its side, and its ring and\nmoon system follow along, orbiting about Uranus\u2019 equator (Figure 11.5).\nFigure11.5Infrared Image of Uranus.The infrared camera on the Hubble Space Telescope took these false-color images of the\nplanet Uranus, its ring system, and moons in 1997. The south pole of the planet (marked with a \u201c+\u201d on the right image) faces the\nSun; its green color shows a strong local haze. The two images were taken 90 minutes apart, and during that time the five reddish\nclouds can be seen to rotate around the parallel to the equator. The rings (which are very faint in the visible light, but prominent in\ninfrared) and eight moons can be seen around the equator. This was the \u201cbull\u2019s eye\u201d arrangement that Voyager saw as it\napproached Uranus in 1986. (credit: modification of work by Erich Karkoschka (University of Arizona), and NASA/ESA)\nWe don\u2019t know what caused Uranus to be tipped over like this, but one possibility is a collision with a large\nplanetary body when our system was first forming. Whatever the cause, this unusual tilt creates dramatic\nseasons. When Voyager 2 arrived at Uranus, its south pole was facing directly into the Sun. The southern\nhemisphere was experiencing a 21-year sunlit summer, while during that same period the northern\nhemisphere was plunged into darkness. For the next 21-year season, the Sun shines on Uranus\u2019 equator, and\nboth hemispheres go through cycles of light and dark as the planet rotates (Figure 11.6). Then there are 21\nyears of an illuminated northern hemisphere and a dark southern hemisphere. After that the pattern of\nalternating day and night repeats.\nJust as on Earth, the seasons are even more extreme at the poles. If you were to install a floating platform at\nthe south pole of Uranus, for example, it would experience 42 years of light and 42 years of darkness. Any\nfuture astronauts crazy enough to set up camp there could spend most of their lives without ever seeing the\nSun. 362 11 \u2022 The Giant Planets\nFigure11.6Strange Seasons on Uranus.(a) This diagram shows the orbit of Uranus as seen from above. At the time Voyager 2\narrived (position 1), the South Pole was facing the Sun. As we move counterclockwise in the diagram, we see the planet 21 years later\nat each step. (b) This graph compares the amount of sunlight seen at the poles and the equator ofUranusover the course of its\n84-year revolution around the Sun.\nComposition and Structure\nAlthough we cannot see into these planets, astronomers are confident that the interiors ofJupiterandSaturn\nare composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. Of course, these gases have been measured only in their\natmosphere, but calculations first carried out more than 50 years ago showed that these two light gases are\nthe only possible materials out of which a planet with the observed masses and densities of Jupiter and Saturn\ncould be constructed.\nThe deep internal structures of these two planets are difficult to predict. This is mainly because these planets\nare so big that the hydrogen and helium in their centers become tremendously compressed and behave in\nways that these gases can never behave on Earth. The best theoretical models we have of Jupiter\u2019s structure\npredict a central pressure greater than 100 million bars and a central density of about 31 g/cm3. (By contrast,\nEarth\u2019s core has a central pressure of 4 million bars and a central density of 17 g/cm3.)\nAt the pressures inside the giant planets, familiar materials can take on strange forms. A few thousand\nkilometers below the visible clouds of Jupiter and Saturn, pressures become so great that hydrogen changes\nfrom a gaseous to a liquid state. Still deeper, this liquid hydrogen is further compressed and begins to act like\na metal, something it never does on Earth. (In a metal, electrons are not firmly attached to their parent nuclei\nbut can wander around. This is why metals are such good conductors of electricity.) On Jupiter, the greater\npart of the interior is liquid metallic hydrogen.\nBecause Saturn is less massive, it has only a small volume of metallic hydrogen, but most of its interior is\nliquid. Uranus and Neptune are too small to reach internal pressures sufficient to liquefy hydrogen. We will\nreturn to the discussion of the metallic hydrogen layers when we examine the magnetic fields of the giant\nplanets.\nEach of these planets has a core composed of heavier materials, as demonstrated by detailed analyses of their\ngravitational fields. Presumably these cores are the original rock-and-ice bodies that formed before the\ncapture of gas from the surrounding nebula. The cores exist at pressures of tens of millions of bars. While\nscientists speak of the giant planet cores being composed of rock and ice, we can be sure that neither rock nor\nice assumes any familiar forms at such pressures and temperatures. Remember that what is really meant by\n\u201crock\u201d is any material made up primarily of iron, silicon, and oxygen, while the term \u201cice\u201d in this chapter\ndenotes materials composed primarily of the elements carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen in combination with\nhydrogen.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.2 \u2022 The Giant Planets 363\nFigure 11.7illustrates the likely interior structures of the four jovian planets. It appears that all four have\nsimilar cores of rock and ice. On Jupiter and Saturn, the cores constitute only a few percent of the total mass,\nconsistent with the initial composition of raw materials shown inTable 11.1. However, most of the mass of\nUranusandNeptuneresides in these cores, demonstrating that the two outer planets were unable to attract\nmassive quantities of hydrogen and helium when they were first forming.\nFigure11.7Internal Structures of the Jovian Planets.Jupiter and Saturn are composed primarily of hydrogen and helium (but\nhydrogen dominates), but Uranus and Neptune consist in large part of compounds of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. (The diagrams\nare drawn to scale; numbers show radii in thousands of kilometers.)\nInternal Heat Sources\nBecause of their large sizes, all the giant planets were strongly heated during their formation by the collapse\nof surrounding material onto their cores. Jupiter, being the largest, was the hottest. Some of this primordial\nheat can still remain inside such large planets. In addition, it is possible for giant, largely gaseous planets to\ngenerate heat after formation by slowly contracting. (With so large a mass, even a minuscule amount of\nshrinking can generate significant heat.) The effect of these internal energy sources is to raise the\ntemperatures in the interiors and atmospheres of the planets higher than we would expect from the heating\neffect of the Sun alone.\nJupiterhas the largest internal energy source, amounting to 4 \u00d7 1017watts; that is, it is heated from inside with\nenergy equivalent to 4 million billion 100-watt lightbulbs. This energy is about the same as the total solar\nenergy absorbed by Jupiter. The atmosphere of Jupiter is therefore something of a cross between a normal\nplanetary atmosphere (like Earth\u2019s), which obtains most of its energy from the Sun, and the atmosphere of a\nstar, which is entirely heated by an internal energy source. Most of the internal energy of Jupiter is primordial\nheat, left over from the formation of the planet 4.5 billion years ago.\nSaturnhas an internal energy source about half as large as that of Jupiter, which means (since its mass is only\nabout one quarter as great) that it is producing twice as much energy per kilogram of material as does Jupiter.\nSince Saturn is expected to have much less primordial heat, there must be another source at work generating\nmost of this 2 \u00d7 1017watts of power. This source is the separation of helium from hydrogen in Saturn\u2019s interior.\nIn the liquid hydrogen mantle, the heavier helium forms droplets that sink toward the core, releasing\ngravitational energy. In effect, Saturn is still differentiating\u2014letting lighter material rise and heavier material\nfall.\nUranusandNeptuneare different. Neptune has a small internal energy source, while Uranus does not emit a\nmeasurable amount of internal heat. As a result, these two planets have almost the same atmospheric 364 11 \u2022 The Giant Planets\ntemperature, in spite of Neptune\u2019s greater distance from the Sun. No one knows why these two planets differ\nin their internal heat, but all this shows how nature can contrive to make each world a little bit different from\nits neighbors.\nMagnetic Fields\nEach of the giant planets has a strongmagnetic field, generated by electric currents in its rapidly spinning\ninterior. Associated with the magnetic fields are the planets\u2019magnetospheres, which are regions around the\nplanet within which the planet\u2019s own magnetic field dominates over the general interplanetary magnetic field.\nThe magnetospheres of these planets are their largest features, extending millions of kilometers into space.\nIn the late 1950s, astronomers discovered that Jupiter was a source of radio waves that got more intense at\nlonger rather than at shorter wavelengths\u2014just the reverse of what is expected from thermal radiation\n(radiation caused by the normal vibrations of particles within all matter). Such behavior is typical, however, of\nthe radiation emitted when high-speed electrons are accelerated by a magnetic field. We call thissynchrotron\nradiationbecause it was first observed on Earth in particle accelerators, called synchrotrons. This was our first\nhint that Jupiter must have a strong magnetic field.\nLater observations showed that the radio waves are coming from a region surrounding Jupiter with a diameter\nseveral times that of the planet itself (Figure 11.8). The evidence suggested that a vast number of charged\natomic particles must be circulating around Jupiter, spiraling around the lines of force of a magnetic field\nassociated with the planet. This is just what we observe happening, but on a smaller scale, in the Van Allen belt\naround Earth. The magnetic fields of Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, discovered by the spacecraft that first\npassed close to these planets, work in a similar way, but are not as strong.\nFigure11.8Jupiter in Radio Waves.This false-color image ofJupiterwas made with the Very Large Array (of radio telescopes) in\nNew Mexico. We see part of the magnetosphere, brightest in the middle because the largest number of charged particles are in the\nequatorial zone of Jupiter. The planet itself is slightly smaller than the green oval in the center. Different colors are used to indicate\ndifferent intensities of synchrotron radiation.

These charged particles can come from the Sun or from the neighborhood of the\nplanet itself. In Jupiter\u2019s case,Io, one of its moons, turns out to have volcanic eruptions that blast charged\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.3 \u2022 Atmospheres of the Giant Planets 365\nparticles into space and right into the jovian magnetosphere.\nThe axis of Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field (the line that connects the magnetic north pole with the magnetic south\npole) is not aligned exactly with the axis of rotation of the planet; rather, it is tipped by about 10\u00b0. Uranus and\nNeptunehave even greater magnetic tilts, of 60\u00b0 and 55\u00b0, respectively. Saturn\u2019s field, on the other hand, is\nperfectly aligned with its rotation axis. Why different planets have such different magnetic tilts is not well\nunderstood.\nThe physical processes around the jovian planets turn out to be milder versions of what astronomers find in\nmany distant objects, from the remnants of dead stars to the puzzling distant powerhouses we call quasars.\nOne reason to study the magnetospheres of the giant planets and Earth is that they provide nearby accessible\nanalogues of more energetic and challenging cosmic processes.\n11.3 Atmospheres of the Giant Planets\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDiscuss the atmospheric composition of the giant planets\nDescribe the cloud formation and atmospheric structure of the gas giants\nCharacterize the giant planets\u2019 wind and weather patterns\nUnderstand the scale and longevity of storms on the giant planets\nTheatmospheres of the jovian planets are the parts we can observe or measure directly. Since these planets\nhave no solid surfaces, their atmospheres are more representative of their general compositions than is the\ncase with the terrestrial planets. These atmospheres also present us with some of the most dramatic examples\nof weather patterns in the solar system. As we will see, storms on these planets can grow bigger than the\nentire planet Earth.\nAtmospheric Composition\nWhen sunlight reflects from the atmospheres of the giant planets, the atmospheric gases leave their\n\u201cfingerprints\u201d in the spectrum of light. Spectroscopic observations of the jovian planets began in the\nnineteenth century, but for a long time, astronomers were not able to interpret the spectra they observed. As\nlate as the 1930s, the most prominent features photographed in these spectra remained unidentified. Then\nbetter spectra revealed the presence of molecules of methane (CH ) and ammonia (NH ) in the atmospheres\n4 3\nof Jupiter and Saturn.\nAt first astronomers thought that methane and ammonia might be the main constituents of these\natmospheres, but now we know that hydrogen and helium are actually the dominant gases. The confusion\narose because neither hydrogen nor helium possesses easily detected spectral features in the visible\nspectrum. It was not until the Voyager spacecraft measured the far-infrared spectra of Jupiter and Saturn that\na reliable abundance for the elusive helium could be found.\nThe compositions of the two atmospheres are generally similar, except that on Saturn there is less helium as\nthe result of the precipitation of helium that contributes to Saturn\u2019s internal energy source. The most precise\nmeasurements of composition were made on Jupiter by the Galileo entry probe in 1995; as a result, we know\nthe abundances of some elements in the jovian atmosphere even better than we know those in the Sun. 366 11 \u2022 The Giant Planets\nVOYAGERS IN ASTRONOMY\nJames Van Allen: Several Planets under His Belt\nThe career of physicist JamesVan Allenspanned the birth and growth of the space age, and he played a\nmajor role in its development. Born in Iowa in 1914, Van Allen received his PhD from the University of Iowa.\nHe then worked for several research institutions and served in the Navy during World War II.\nAfter the war, Van Allen (Figure 11.9) was appointed Professor of Physics at the University of Iowa. He and\nhis collaborators began using rockets to explore cosmic radiation in Earth\u2019s outer atmosphere. To reach\nextremely high altitudes, Van Allen designed a technique in which a balloon lifts and then launches a small\nrocket (the rocket is nicknamed \u201cthe rockoon\u201d).\nFigure11.9James Van Allen (1914\u20132006).In this 1950s photograph, Van Allen holds a \u201crockoon.\u201d (credit: modification of work\nby Frederick W. Kent Collection, University of Iowa Archives)\nOver dinner one night in 1950, Van Allen and several colleagues came up with the idea of the International\nGeophysical Year (IGY), an opportunity for scientists around the world to coordinate their investigations of\nthe physics of Earth, especially research done at high altitudes. In 1955, the United States and the Soviet\nUnion each committed themselves to launching an Earth-orbiting satellite during IGY, a competition that\nbegan what came to be known as the space race. The IGY (stretched to 18 months) took place between July\n1957 and December 1958.\nThe Soviet Union won the first lap of the race by launching Sputnik 1 in October 1957. The US government\nspurred its scientists and engineers to even greater efforts to get something into space to maintain the\ncountry\u2019s prestige. However, the primary US satellite program, Vanguard, ran into difficulties: each of its\nearly launches crashed or exploded. Simultaneously, a second team of rocket engineers and scientists had\nquietly been working on a military launch vehicle called Jupiter-C. Van Allen spearheaded the design of the\ninstruments aboard a small satellite that this vehicle would carry. On January 31, 1958, Van Allen\u2019s Explorer\n1 became the first US satellite in space.\nUnlike Sputnik, Explorer 1 was equipped to make scientific measurements of high-energy charged particles\nabove the atmosphere. Van Allen and his team discovered a belt of highly charged particles surrounding\nEarth, and these belts now bear his name. This first scientific discovery of the space program made Van\nAllen\u2019s name known around the world.\nVan Allen and his colleagues continued to measure the magnetic and particle environment around planets\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.3 \u2022 Atmospheres of the Giant Planets 367\nwith increasingly sophisticated spacecraft, including Pioneers 10 and 11, which made exploratory surveys of\nthe environments of Jupiter and Saturn. Some scientists refer to the charged-particle zones around those\nplanets asVan Allen belts as well. (Once, when Van Allen was giving a lecture at the University of Arizona,\nthe graduate students in planetary science asked him if he would leave his belt at the school. It is now\nproudly displayed as the university\u2019s \u201cVan Allen belt.\u201d)\nVan Allen was a strong supporter of space science and an eloquent senior spokesperson for the American\nscientific community, warning NASA not to put all its efforts into human spaceflight, but to also use robotic\nspacecraft as productive tools for space exploration.\nClouds and Atmospheric Structure\nThe clouds ofJupiter(Figure 11.10) are among the most spectacular sights in the solar system, much beloved\nby makers of science-fiction films. They range in color from white to orange to red to brown, swirling and\ntwisting in a constantly changing kaleidoscope of patterns. Saturn shows similar but much more subdued\ncloud activity; instead of vivid colors, its clouds have a nearly uniform butterscotch hue (Figure 11.11).\nFigure11.10Jupiter\u2019s Colorful Clouds.The vibrant colors of the clouds on Jupiter present a puzzle to astronomers: given the cool\ntemperatures and the composition of nearly 90% hydrogen, the atmosphere should be colorless. One hypothesis suggests that\nperhaps colorful hydrogen compounds rise from warm areas. The actual colors are a bit more muted, as shown inFigure 11.2.\n(credit: modification of work by Voyager Project, JPL, and NASA)\nDifferent gases freeze at different temperatures. At the temperatures and pressures of the upper atmospheres\nof Jupiter and Saturn, methane remains a gas, but ammonia can condense and freeze. (Similarly, water vapor\ncondenses high in Earth\u2019s atmosphere to produce clouds of ice crystals.) The primary clouds that we see\naround these planets, whether from a spacecraft or through a telescope, are composed of frozen ammonia\ncrystals. The ammonia clouds mark the upper edge of the planets\u2019 tropospheres; above that is the\nstratosphere, the coldest part of the atmosphere. (These layers were initially defined inEarth as a Planet.) 368 11 \u2022 The Giant Planets\nFigure11.11Saturn over Five Years.These beautiful images ofSaturnwere recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope between 1996\nand 2000. Since Saturn is tilted by 27\u00b0, we see the orientation ofSaturn\u2019s ringsaround its equator change as the planet moves along\nits orbit. Note the horizontal bands in the atmosphere. (credit: modification of work by NASA and The Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/\nAURA))\nThe diagrams inFigure 11.12show the structure and clouds in the atmospheres of all four jovian planets. On\nboth Jupiter and Saturn, the temperature near the cloud tops is about 140 K (only a little cooler than the polar\ncaps of Mars). On Jupiter, this cloud level is at a pressure of about 0.1 bar (one tenth the atmospheric pressure\nat the surface of Earth), but on Saturn it occurs lower in the atmosphere, at about 1 bar. Because the ammonia\nclouds lie so much deeper on Saturn, they are more difficult to see, and the overall appearance of the planet is\nmuch blander than is Jupiter\u2019s appearance.\nFigure11.12Atmospheric Structure of the Jovian Planets.In each diagram, the yellow line shows how the temperature (see the\nscale on the bottom) changes with altitude (see the scale at the left). The location of the main layers on each planet is also shown.\nWithin the tropospheres of these planets, the temperature and pressure both increase with depth. Through\nbreaks in the ammonia clouds, we can see tantalizing glimpses of other cloud layers that can form in these\ndeeper regions of the atmosphere\u2014regions that were sampled directly for Jupiter by the Galileo probe that fell\ninto the planet.\nAs it descended to a pressure of 5 bars, the probe should have passed into a region of frozen water clouds,\nthen below that into clouds of liquid water droplets, perhaps similar to the common clouds of the terrestrial\ntroposphere. At least this is what scientists expected. But the probe saw no water clouds, and it measured a\nsurprisingly low abundance of water vapor in the atmosphere. It soon became clear to the Galileo scientists\nthat the probe happened to descend through an unusually dry, cloud-free region of the atmosphere\u2014a giant\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.3 \u2022 Atmospheres of the Giant Planets 369\ndowndraft of cool, dry gas. Andrew Ingersoll of Caltech, a member of the Galileo team, called this entry site the\n\u201cdesert\u201d of Jupiter. It\u2019s a pity that the probe did not enter a more representative region, but that\u2019s the luck of\nthe cosmic draw. The probe continued to make measurements to a pressure of 22 bars but found no other\ncloud layers before its instruments stopped working. It also detected lightning storms, but only at great\ndistances, further suggesting that the probe itself was in a region of clear weather.\nAbove the visible ammonia clouds inJupiter\u2019s atmosphere, we find the clear stratosphere, which reaches a\nminimum temperature near 120 K. At still higher altitudes, temperatures rise again, just as they do in the\nupper atmosphere of Earth, because here the molecules absorb ultraviolet light from the Sun. The cloud colors\nare due to impurities, the product of chemical reactions among the atmospheric gases in a process we call\nphotochemistry. In Jupiter\u2019s upper atmosphere, photochemical reactions create a variety of fairly complex\ncompounds of hydrogen and carbon that form a thin layer of smog far above the visible clouds. We show this\nsmog as a fuzzy orange region inFigure 11.12; however, this thin layer does not block our view of the clouds\nbeneath it.\nThe visible atmosphere ofSaturnis composed of approximately 75% hydrogen and 25% helium, with trace\namounts of methane, ethane, propane, and other hydrocarbons. The overall structure is similar to that of\nJupiter. Temperatures are somewhat colder, however, and the atmosphere is more extended due to Saturn\u2019s\nlower surface gravity. Thus, the layers are stretched out over a longer distance, as you can see inFigure 11.12.\nOverall, though, the same atmospheric regions, condensation cloud, and photochemical reactions that we see\non Jupiter should be present on Saturn (Figure 11.13).\nFigure11.13Cloud Structure on Saturn.In this Cassini image, colors have been intensified, so we can see the bands and zones and\nstorms in the atmosphere. The dark band is the shadow of the rings on the planet. (credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute)\nSaturn has one anomalous cloud structure that has mystified scientists: a hexagonal wave pattern around the\nnorth pole, shown inFigure 11.14. The six sides of the hexagon are each longer than the diameter of Earth.\nWinds are also extremely high on Saturn, with speeds of up to 1800 kilometers per hour measured near the\nequator. 370 11 \u2022 The Giant Planets\nFigure11.14Hexagon Pattern on Saturn\u2019s North Pole.In this infrared nighttime image from the Cassini mission, the path of\nSaturn\u2019s hexagonal jet stream is visible as the planet\u2019s north pole emerges from the darkness of winter.

Calculations indicate that the basic\natmospheric structure of Uranus should resemble that of Jupiter and Saturn, although its upper clouds (at the\n1-bar pressure level) are composed of methane rather than ammonia. However, the absence of an internal\nheat source suppresses up-and-down movement and leads to a very stable atmosphere with little visible\nstructure.\nNeptunediffers from Uranus in its appearance, although their basic atmospheric temperatures are similar.\nThe upper clouds are composed of methane, which forms a thin cloud layer near the top of the troposphere at\na temperature of 70 K and a pressure of 1.5 bars. Most the atmosphere above this level is clear and\ntransparent, with less haze than is found on Uranus. The scattering of sunlight by gas molecules lends\nNeptune a pale blue color similar to that of Earth\u2019s atmosphere (Figure 11.15). Another cloud layer, perhaps\ncomposed of hydrogen sulfide ice particles, exists below the methane clouds at a pressure of 3 bars.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.3 \u2022 Atmospheres of the Giant Planets 371\nFigure11.15Neptune.The planetNeptuneis seen here as photographed by Voyager in 1989. The blue color, exaggerated with\ncomputer processing, is caused by the scattering of sunlight in the planet\u2019s upper atmosphere. (credit: modification of work by\nNASA)\nUnlike Uranus, Neptune has an atmosphere in whichconvection currents\u2014vertical drafts of gas\u2014emanate\nfrom the interior, powered by the planet\u2019s internal heat source. These currents carry warm gas above the\n1.5-bar cloud level, forming additional clouds at elevations about 75 kilometers higher. These high-altitude\nclouds form bright white patterns against the blue planet beneath. Voyager photographed distinct shadows\non the methane cloud tops, permitting the altitudes of the high clouds to be calculated.Figure 11.16is a\nremarkable close-up of Neptune\u2019s outer layers that could never have been obtained from Earth.\nFigure11.16High Clouds in the Atmosphere of Neptune.These bright, narrow cirrus clouds are made of methane ice crystals.\nFrom the shadows they cast on the thicker cloud layer below, we can measure that they are about 75 kilometers higher than the\nmain clouds. (credit: modification of work by NASA/JPL)\nWinds and Weather\nTheatmospheres of the jovian planets have many regions of high pressure (where there is more air) and low\npressure (where there is less). Just as it does on Earth, air flows between these regions, setting up wind\npatterns that are then distorted by the rotation of the planet. By observing the changing cloud patterns on the\njovian planets, we can measure wind speeds and track the circulation of their atmospheres. 372 11 \u2022 The Giant Planets\nThe atmospheric motions we see on these planets are fundamentally different from those on the terrestrial\nplanets. The giants spin faster, and their rapid rotation tends to smear out of the circulation into horizontal\n(east-west) patterns parallel to the equator. In addition, there is no solid surface below the atmosphere\nagainst which the circulation patterns can rub and lose energy (which is how tropical storms on Earth\nultimately die out when they come over land).\nAs we have seen, on all the giants except Uranus, heat from the inside contributes about as much energy to\nthe atmosphere as sunlight from the outside. This means that deep convection currents of rising hot air and\nfalling cooler air circulate throughout the atmospheres of the planets in the vertical direction.\nThe main features ofJupiter\u2019s visible clouds (seeFigure 11.2andFigure 11.10, for example) are alternating\ndark and light bands that stretch around the planet parallel to the equator. These bands are semi-permanent\nfeatures, although they shift in intensity and position from year to year. Consistent with the small tilt of\nJupiter\u2019s axis, the pattern does not change with the seasons.\nMore fundamental than these bands are underlying east-west wind patterns in the atmosphere, which do not\nappear to change at all, even over many decades. These are illustrated inFigure 11.17, which indicates how\nstrong the winds are at each latitude for the giant planets. At Jupiter\u2019s equator, a jet stream flows eastward\nwith a speed of about 90 meters per second (300 kilometers per hour), similar to the speed of jet streams in\nEarth\u2019s upper atmosphere. At higher latitudes there are alternating east- and west-moving streams, with each\nhemisphere an almost perfect mirror image of the other.Saturnshows a similar pattern, but with a much\nstronger equatorial jet stream, as we noted earlier.\nFigure11.17Winds on the Giant Planets.This image compares the winds of the giant planets, illustrating that wind speed (shown\non the horizontal axis) and wind direction vary with latitude (shown on the vertical axis). Winds are measured relative to a planet\u2019s\ninternal rotation speed. A positive velocity means that the winds are blowing in the same direction as, but faster than, the planet\u2019s\ninternal rotation. A negative velocity means that the winds are blowing more slowly than the planet\u2019s internal rotation.\nThe light zones onJupiterare regions of upwelling air capped by white ammonia cirrus clouds. They\n2\napparently represent the tops of upward-moving convection currents. The darker belts are regions where the\ncooler atmosphere moves downward, completing the convection cycle; they are darker because fewer\nammonia clouds mean we can see deeper into the atmosphere, perhaps down to a region of ammonium\nhydrosulfide (NH SH) clouds. The Galileo probe sampled one of the clearest of these dry downdrafts.\n4\nIn spite of the strange seasons induced by the 98\u00b0 tilt of its axis,Uranus\u2019 basic circulation is parallel with its\nequator, as is the case on Jupiter and Saturn. The mass of the atmosphere and its capacity to store heat are so\ngreat that the alternating 42-year periods of sunlight and darkness have little effect. In fact, Voyager\nmeasurements show that the atmospheric temperature is even a few degrees higher on the dark winter side\nthan on the hemisphere facing the Sun. This is another indication that the behavior of such giant planet\natmospheres is a complex problem that we do not fully understand.\n2 Recall from earlier chapters that convection is a process in which liquids, heated from underneath, have regions where hot\nmaterial rises and cooler material descends. You can see convection at work if you heat oatmeal on a stovetop or watch miso soup\nboil.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11.3 \u2022 Atmospheres of the Giant Planets 373\nNeptune\u2019s weather is characterized by strong east-west winds generally similar to those observed on Jupiter\nand Saturn. The highest wind speeds near its equator reach 2100 kilometers per hour, even higher than the\npeak winds on Saturn. The Neptune equatorial jet stream actually approaches supersonic speeds (faster than\nthe speed of sound in Neptune\u2019s air).\nGiant Storms on Giant Planets\nSuperimposed on the regular atmospheric circulation patterns we have just described are many local\ndisturbances\u2014weather systems orstorms, to borrow the term we use on Earth. The most prominent of these\nare large, oval-shaped, high-pressure regions on both Jupiter (Figure 11.18) and Neptune.\nFigure11.18Storms on Jupiter.Two examples of storms onJupiterillustrate the use of enhanced color and contrast to bring out\nfaint features. (a) The three oval-shaped white storms below and to the left of Jupiter\u2019s Great Red Spot are highly active, and moved\ncloser together over the course of seven months between 1994 and 1995.

(credit a: modification of work by Reta Beebe, Amy Simon (New Mexico\nState Univ.), and NASA; credit b: modification of work by NASA, ESA, and A. Simon-Miller (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center))\nThe largest and most famous ofJupiter\u2019s stormsis theGreat Red Spot, a reddish oval in the southern\nhemisphere that changes slowly; it was 25,000 kilometers long when Voyager arrived in 1979, but it had shrunk\nto 20,000 kilometers by the end of the Galileo mission in 2000 (Figure 11.19). The giant storm has persisted in\nJupiter\u2019s atmosphere ever since astronomers were first able to observe it after the invention of the telescope,\nmore than 300 years ago. However, it has continued to shrink and has become more nearly circular, raising\nspeculation that we may see its end within a few decades. Measurements from the Juno spacecraft of\nvariations in Jupiter\u2019s gravity field indicate that the depth of the Red Spot storm system is only a few hundred\nkilometers\u2014a finding that challenges some of the models astronomers have made of this long-lasting\nweather system.\nFigure11.19Jupiter\u2019s Great Red Spot.This is the largest storm system on Jupiter, as seen during the Voyager spacecraft flyby.\nBelow and to the right of the Red Spot is one of the white ovals, which are similar but smaller high-pressure features. The white oval 374 11 \u2022 The Giant Planets\nis roughly the size of planet Earth, to give you a sense of the huge scale of the weather patterns we are seeing.

SeeFigure 11.2to get a better sense of the colors your eye would actually see near Jupiter. (credit: NASA/JPL)\nIn addition to its longevity, the Red Spot differs from terrestrial storms in being a high-pressure region; on our\nplanet, such storms are regions of lower pressure. The Red Spot\u2019s counterclockwise rotation has a period of six\ndays. Three similar but smaller disturbances (about as big as Earth) formed on Jupiter in the 1930s. They look\nlike white ovals, and one can be seen clearly below and to the right of the Great Red Spot inFigure 11.19. In\n1998, the Galileo spacecraft watched as two of these ovals collided and merged into one.\nWe don\u2019t know what causes the Great Red Spot or the white ovals, but we do have an idea how they can last so\nlong once they form. On Earth, the lifetime of a large oceanic hurricane or typhoon is typically a few weeks, or\neven less when it moves over the continents and encounters friction with the land. Jupiter has no solid surface\nto slow down an atmospheric disturbance; furthermore, the sheer size of the disturbances lends them\nstability. We can calculate that on a planet with no solid surface, the lifetime of anything as large as the Red\nSpot should be measured in centuries, while lifetimes for the white ovals should be measured in decades,\nwhich is pretty much what we have observed.\nDespiteNeptune\u2019s smaller size and different cloud composition, Voyager showed that it had an atmospheric\nfeature surprisingly similar to Jupiter\u2019s Great Red Spot.Neptune\u2019s Great Dark Spotwas nearly 10,000\nkilometers long (Figure 11.15). On both planets, the giant storms formed at latitude 20\u00b0 S, had the same shape,\nand took up about the same fraction of the planet\u2019s diameter. The Great Dark Spot rotated with a period of 17\ndays, versus about 6 days for the Great Red Spot. When the Hubble Space Telescope examined Neptune in the\nmid-1990s, however, astronomers could find no trace of the Great Dark Spot on their images.\nAlthough many of the details of the weather on the jovian planets are not yet understood, it is clear that if you\nare a fan of dramatic weather, these worlds are the place to look. We study the features in these atmospheres\nnot only for what they have to teach us about conditions in the jovian planets, but also because we hope they\ncan help us understand the weather on Earth just a bit better.\nEXAMPLE 11.1\nStorms and Winds\nThe wind speeds in circular storm systems can be formidable on both Earth and the giant planets. Think\nabout our big terrestrial hurricanes. If you watch their behavior in satellite images shown on weather\noutlets, you will see that they require about one day to rotate. If a storm has a diameter of 400 km and\nrotates once in 24 h, what is the wind speed?\nSolution\nSpeed equals distance divided by time. The distance in this case is the circumference (2\u03c0Ror \u03c0d), or\napproximately 1250 km, and the time is 24 h, so the speed at the edge of the storm would be about 52 km/\nh. Toward the center of the storm, the wind speeds can be much higher.\nCheck Your Learning\nJupiter\u2019s Great Red Spot rotates in 6 d and has a circumference equivalent to a circle with radius 10,000 km.\nCalculate the wind speed at the outer edge of the spot.\nAnswer:\nFor the Great Red Spot of Jupiter, the circumference (2\u03c0R) is about 63,000 km. Six d equals 144 h,\nsuggesting a speed of about 436 km/h. This is much faster than wind speeds on Earth.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 11 \u2022 Key Terms 375\nKey Terms\nphotochemistry chemical changes caused by electromagnetic radiation\nsynchrotron radiation the radiation emitted by charged particles being accelerated in magnetic fields and\nmoving at speeds near that of light\nSummary\n11.1Exploring the Outer Planets\nThe outer solar system contains the four giant planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The gas giants\nJupiter and Saturn have overall compositions similar to that of the Sun. These planets have been explored by\nthe Pioneer, Voyager, Galileo, and Cassini spacecraft. Voyager 2, perhaps the most successful of all space-\nscience missions, explored Jupiter (1979), Saturn (1981), Uranus (1986), and Neptune (1989)\u2014a grand tour of\nthe giant planets\u2014and these flybys have been the only explorations to date of the ice giants Uranus and\nNeptune. The Galileo and Cassini missions were long-lived orbiters, and each also deployed an entry probe,\none into Jupiter and one into Saturn\u2019s moon Titan.\n11.2The Giant Planets\nJupiter is 318 times more massive than Earth. Saturn is about 25% as massive as Jupiter, and Uranus and\nNeptune are only 5% as massive. All four have deep atmospheres and opaque clouds, and all rotate quickly\nwith periods from 10 to 17 hours. Jupiter and Saturn have extensive mantles of liquid hydrogen. Uranus and\nNeptune are depleted in hydrogen and helium relative to Jupiter and Saturn (and the Sun). Each giant planet\nhas a core of \u201cice\u201d and \u201crock\u201d of about 10 Earth masses. Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune have major internal heat\nsources, obtaining as much (or more) energy from their interiors as by radiation from the Sun. Uranus has no\nmeasurable internal heat. Jupiter has the strongest magnetic field and largest magnetosphere of any planet,\nfirst discovered by radio astronomers from observations of synchrotron radiation.\n11.3Atmospheres of the Giant Planets\nThe four giant planets have generally similar atmospheres, composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. Their\natmospheres contain small quantities of methane and ammonia gas, both of which also condense to form\nclouds. Deeper (invisible) cloud layers consist of water and possibly ammonium hydrosulfide (Jupiter and\nSaturn) and hydrogen sulfide (Neptune). In the upper atmospheres, hydrocarbons and other trace compounds\nare produced by photochemistry. We do not know exactly what causes the colors in the clouds of Jupiter.\nAtmospheric motions on the giant planets are dominated by east-west circulation. Jupiter displays the most\nactive cloud patterns, with Neptune second. Saturn is generally bland, in spite of its extremely high wind\nspeeds, and Uranus is featureless (perhaps due to its lack of an internal heat source). Large storms (oval-\nshaped high-pressure systems such as the Great Red Spot on Jupiter and the Great Dark Spot on Neptune) can\nbe found in some of the planet atmospheres.\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nJupiter\nAguirre, Edwin. \u201cHubble Zooms in on Jupiter\u2019s New Red Spot.\u201dSky & Telescope(August 2006): 26.\nBeatty, J. \u201cInto the Giant.\u201dSky & Telescope(April 1996): 20.

Nearly 200 moons are known in the outer solar system\u2014too many to name individually or discuss in\nany detail. Astronomers anticipate that additional small moons await future discovery. We have also\ndiscovered a fascinating variety of rings around each of the jovian planets.\nBefore the Voyager missions, even the largest of the outer-planet moons were mere points of light in our\ntelescopes. Then, in less than a decade, we had close-up images, and these moons became individual worlds\nfor us, each with unique features and peculiarities. The Galileo mission added greatly to our knowledge of the\nmoons of Jupiter, and the Cassini mission has done the same for the Saturn system. In 2015, the NASA New\nHorizons spacecraft completed the initial exploration of the \u201cclassical\u201d planets in the solar system with its flyby\nof Pluto and its moons. We include Pluto here because in some ways it resembles some of the larger moons in\nthe outer solar system. Each new spacecraft mission has revealed many surprises, as the objects in the outer\nsolar system are much more varied and geologically active than scientists had anticipated. 382 12 \u2022 Rings, Moons, and Pluto\n12.1 Ring and Moon Systems Introduced\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nBriefly describe the system of moons around each of the jovian planets\nDescribe the basic composition of each jovian planet\u2019s ring system\nThe rings andmoons(see the moons inFigure 12.2) of the outer solar system are not composed of the same\nmaterials as the mostly rocky objects in the inner solar system. We should expect this, since they formed in\nregions of lower temperature, cool enough so that large quantities of water ice were available as building\nmaterials. Most of these objects also contain dark, organic compounds mixed with their ice and rock. Don\u2019t be\nsurprised, therefore, to find that many objects in the ring and moon systems are both icy and dark.\nRoughly a third of the moons in the outer solar system are indirector regular orbits; that is, they revolve\nabout their parent planet in a west-to-east direction and in the plane of the planet\u2019s equator. The majority are\nirregular moons that orbit in aretrograde(east-to-west) direction or else have orbits of high eccentricity (more\nelliptical than circular) or high inclination (moving in and out of the planet\u2019s equatorial plane). These irregular\nmoons are mostly located relatively far from their planet; they were probably formed elsewhere and\nsubsequently captured by the planet they now orbit.\nFigure12.2Moons of the Solar System.This image shows some selected moons of our solar system and their comparison to the\nsize of Earth\u2019s Moon and Earth itself. (credit: modification of work by NASA)\nThe Jupiter System\nJupiterhas 79 known moons (that\u2019s the number as we write) and a faint ring. These include four large\nmoons\u2014Callisto,Ganymede,Europa, andIo(seeFigure 12.1)\u2014discovered in 1610 by Galileo and therefore\noften called theGalilean moons. The smaller of these, Europa and Io, are about the size of our Moon, while the\nlarger, Ganymede and Callisto, are about the same size as the planet Mercury. Most of Jupiter\u2019s moons are\nmuch smaller. The majority are in retrograde orbits more than 20 million kilometers from Jupiter; these are\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.2 \u2022 The Galilean Moons of Jupiter 383\nvery likely small captured asteroids.\nThe Saturn System\nSaturnhas at least 82 known moons in addition to a magnificent set of rings. The largest of the moons,Titan,\nis almost as big as Ganymede in Jupiter\u2019s system, and it is the only moon with a substantial atmosphere and\nlakes or seas of liquid hydrocarbons (such as methane and ethane) on the surface. Saturn has six other large\nregular moons with diameters between 400 and 1600 kilometers, a collection of small moons orbiting in or\nnear the rings, and many captured strays similar to those of Jupiter. Mysteriously, one of Saturn\u2019s smaller\nmoons,Enceladus, has active geysers of water being expelled into space.\nThe rings of Saturn, one of the most impressive sights in the solar system, are broad and flat, with a few major\nand many minor gaps. They are not solid, but rather a huge collection of icy fragments, all orbiting the equator\nof Saturn in a traffic pattern that makes rush hour in a big city look simple by comparison. Individual ring\nparticles are composed primarily of water ice and are typically the size of ping-pong balls, tennis balls, and\nbasketballs.\nThe Uranus System\nThe ring and moon system ofUranusis tilted at 98\u00b0, just like the planet itself. It consists of 11 rings and 27\ncurrently known moons. The five largest moons are similar in size to the six regular moons of Saturn, with\ndiameters of 500 to 1600 kilometers. Discovered in 1977, the rings of Uranus are narrow ribbons of dark\nmaterial with broad gaps in between. Astronomers suppose that the ring particles are confined to these\nnarrow paths by the gravitational effects of numerous small moons, many of which we have not yet glimpsed.\nThe Neptune System\nNeptunehas 14 known moons. The most interesting of these isTriton, a relatively large moon in a retrograde\norbit\u2014which is unusual. Triton has a very thin atmosphere, and active eruptions were discovered there by\nVoyager in its 1989 flyby. To explain its unusual characteristics, astronomers have suggested that Triton may\nhave originated beyond the Neptune system, as a dwarf planet like Pluto. The rings of Neptune are narrow\nand faint. Like those of Uranus, they are composed of dark materials and are thus not easy to see.\n12.2 The Galilean Moons of Jupiter\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the major features we can observe about Callisto and what we can deduce from them\nExplain the evidence for tectonic and volcanic activity on Ganymede\nExplain what may be responsible for the unusual features on the icy surface of Europa\nDescribe the major distinguishing characteristic of Io\nExplain how tidal forces generate the geological activity we see on Europa and Io\nFrom 1996 to 1999, the Galileo spacecraft careered through the jovian system on a complex but carefully\nplanned trajectory that provided repeated close encounters with the large Galileanmoons. More recently, the\nJuno spacecraft, also a Jupiter orbiter, has provided a few close looks at Ganymede and Europa. (Beginning in\n2004, we received an even greater bonanza of information about Titan, obtained from the Cassini spacecraft\nand its Huygens probe, which landed on its surface. We include Titan, Saturn\u2019s one big moon, here for\ncomparison.)Table 12.1summarizes some basic facts about these large moons (plus our own Moon for\ncomparison). 384 12 \u2022 Rings, Moons, and Pluto\nThe Largest Moons\nName Diameter Mass Density Reflectivity\n(km) (Earth\u2019s Moon = 1) (g/cm3) (%)\nMoon 3476 1.0 3.3 12\nCallisto 4820 1.5 1.8 20\nGanymede 5270 2.0 1.9 40\nEuropa 3130 0.7 3.0 70\nIo 3640 1.2 3.5 60\nTitan 5150 1.9 1.9 20\nTable12.1\nCallisto: An Ancient, Primitive World\nWe begin our discussion of the Galilean moons with the outermost one,Callisto, not because it is remarkable\nbut because it is not. This makes it a convenient object with which other, more active, worlds can be compared.\nIts distance fromJupiteris about 2 million kilometers, and it orbits the planet in 17 days. Like our own Moon,\nCallisto rotates in the same period as it revolves, so it always keeps the same face toward Jupiter. Callisto\u2019s day\nthus equals its month: 17 days. Its noontime surface temperature is only 130 K (about 140 \u00b0C below freezing),\nso that water ice is stable (it never evaporates) on its surface year round.\nCallisto has a diameter of 4820 kilometers, almost the same as the planet Mercury (Figure 12.3). Yet its mass is\nonly one-third as great, which means its density (the mass divided by the volume) must be only one-third as\ngreat as well. This tells us that Callisto has far less of the rocky and metallic materials found in the inner\nplanets and must instead be an icy body through much of its interior. Callisto can show us how the geology of\nan icy object compares with those made primarily of rock.\nUnlike the worlds we have studied so far, Callisto has not fullydifferentiated(separated into layers of different\ndensity materials). We can tell that it lacks a dense core from the details of its gravitational pull on the Galileo\nspacecraft. This surprised scientists, who expected that all the big icy moons would be differentiated. It should\nbe easier for an icy body to differentiate than for a rocky one because the melting temperature of ice is so low.\nOnly a little heating will soften the ice and get the process started, allowing the rock and metal to sink to the\ncenter while the slushy ice floats to the surface. Yet Callisto seems to have frozen solid before the process of\ndifferentiation was complete.\nThe surface of Callisto is covered with impact craters, like the lunar highlands. The survival of these craters\ntells us that an icy object can retain impact craters on its surface. Callisto is unique among the planet-sized\nobjects of the solar system in the apparent absence of interior forces to drive geological change. You might\nsay that this moon was stillborn, and it has remained geologically dead for more than 4 billion years (Figure\n12.3).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.2 \u2022 The Galilean Moons of Jupiter 385\nFigure12.3Callisto.(a) Jupiter\u2019s outermost large moon shows a heavily cratered surface. Astronomers believe that the bright areas\nare mostly ice, while the darker areas are more eroded, ice-poor material. (b) These high-resolution images, taken by NASA\u2019s Galileo\nspacecraft in May 2001, show the icy spires (top) onCallisto\u2019s surface, with darker dust that has slid down as the ice erodes,\ncollecting in the low-lying areas. The spires are about 80 to 100 meters tall. As the surface erodes even further, the icy spires\neventually disappear, leaving impact craters exposed, as shown in the lower image. (credit a: modification of work by NASA/JPL/DLR;\ncredit b: modification of work by NASA/JPL/Arizona State University, Academic Research Lab)\nIn thinking about ice so far from the Sun, we must take care not to judge its behavior from the much warmer\nice we know and love on Earth. At the temperatures of the outer solar system, ice on the surface is nearly as\nhard as rock, and it behaves similarly. Ice on Callisto does not deform or flow like ice in glaciers on Earth.\nGanymede, the Largest Moon\nGanymede, the largest moon in the solar system, also shows a great deal of cratering (Figure 12.4). Recall from\nOther Worlds: An Introduction to the Solar Systemthat we can use crater counts on solid worlds to estimate\nthe age of the surface. The more craters, the longer the surface has been exposed to battering from space,\nand the older it must therefore be. About one-quarter of Ganymede\u2019s surface seems to be as old and heavily\ncratered as that of Callisto; the rest formed more recently, as we can tell by the sparse covering of impact\ncraters as well as the relative freshness of those craters. If we judge from crater counts, this fresher terrain on\nGanymede is somewhat younger than the lunar maria or the martian volcanic plains, perhaps 2 to 3 billion\nyears old.\nThe differences between Ganymede and Callisto are more than skin deep. Ganymede is a differentiated world,\nlike the terrestrial planets. Measurements of its gravity field tell us that the rock sank to form a core about the\nsize of our Moon, with a mantle and crust of ice \u201cfloating\u201d above it. In addition, the Galileo spacecraft\ndiscovered that Ganymede has a magnetic field, the sure signature of a partially molten interior. There is very\nlikely liquid water trapped within the interior. Thus, Ganymede is not a dead world but rather a place of\nintermittent geological activity powered by an internal heat source. Some surface features could be as young\nas the surface of Venus (a few hundred million years).\nThe younger terrain was formed by tectonic and volcanic forces (Figure 12.4). In some places, the crust\napparently cracked, flooding many of the craters with water from the interior. Extensive mountain ranges\nwere formed from compression of the crust, forming long ridges with parallel valleys spaced a few kilometers\napart. In some areas, older impact craters were split and pulled apart. There are even indications of large-scale\ncrustal movements that are similar to the plate tectonics of Earth. 386 12 \u2022 Rings, Moons, and Pluto\nFigure12.4Ganymede.(a) This global view ofGanymede, the largest moon in the solar system, was taken by Voyager 2. The colors\nare enhanced to make spotting differences easier. Darker places are older, more heavily cratered regions; the lighter areas are\nyounger (the reverse of our Moon). The brightest spots are sites of geologically recent impacts. (b) This close-up of Nicholson Regio\non Ganymede shows an old impact crater (on the lower left-hand side) that has been split and pulled apart by tectonic forces.\nAgainst Ganymede\u2019s dark terrain, a line of grooves and ridges appears to cut through the crater, deforming its circular shape. (credit\na: modification of work by NASA/JPL/DLR; credit b: modification of work by NASA/JPL/Brown University)\nWhy is Ganymede so different from Callisto? Possibly the small difference in size and internal heating between\nthe two led to this divergence in their evolution. But more likely the gravity of Jupiter is to blame for\nGanymede\u2019s continuing geological activity. Ganymede is close enough to Jupiter thattidal forcesfrom the\ngiant planet may have episodically heated its interior and triggered major convulsions on its crust.\nA tidal force results from the unequal gravitational pull on two sides of a body. In a complex kind of modern\ndance, the large moons of Jupiter are caught in the varying gravity grip of both the giant planet and each\nother. This leads to gravitational flexing or kneading in their centers, which can heat them\u2014an effect called\ntidal heating. (A fuller explanation is given in the section on Io.) We will see as we move inward to Europa and\nIo that the role of jovian tides becomes more important for moons close to the planet.\nEuropa, a Moon with an Ocean\nEuropaand Io, the inner two Galilean moons, are not icy worlds like most of the moons of the outer planets.\nWith densities and sizes similar to our Moon, they appear to be predominantly rocky objects. How did they fail\nto acquire a majority share of the ice that must have been plentiful in the outer solar system at the time of\ntheir formation?\nThe most probable cause is Jupiter itself, which was hot enough to radiate a great deal of infrared energy\nduring the first few million years after its formation. This infrared radiation would have heated the disk of\nmaterial near the planet that would eventually coalesce into the closer moons. Thus, any ice near Jupiter was\nvaporized, leaving Europa and Io with compositions similar to planets in the inner solar system.\nDespite its mainly rocky composition, Europa has an ice-covered surface, as astronomers have long known\nfrom examining spectra of sunlight reflected from it. In this it resembles Earth, which has a layer of water on\nits surface, but in Europa\u2019s case the water is capped by a thick crust of ice. There are very few impact craters in\nthis ice, indicating that the surface of Europa is in a continual state of geological self-renewal. Judging from\ncrater counts, the surface must be no more than a few million years old, and perhaps substantially less. In\nterms of its ability to erase impact craters, Europa is more geologically active than Earth.\nWhen we look at close-up photos of Europa, we see a strange, complicated surface (Figure 12.5). For the most\npart, the icy crust is extremely smooth, but it is crisscrossed with cracks and low ridges that often stretch for\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.2 \u2022 The Galilean Moons of Jupiter 387\nthousands of kilometers. Some of these long lines are single, but most are double or multiple, looking rather\nlike the remnants of a colossal freeway system.\nFigure12.5Evidence for an Ocean on Europa.(a) A close-up of an area called Conamara Chaos is shown here with enhanced color.\nThis view is 70 kilometers wide in its long dimension. It appears that Conamara is a region where Europa\u2019s icy crust is (or recently\nwas) relatively thin and there is easier access to the possible liquid or slushy ocean beneath. Not anchored to solid crust underneath,\nmany of the ice blocks here seem to have slid or rotated from their original positions. In fact, the formations seen here look similar\nto views of floating sea-ice and icebergs in Earth\u2019s Arctic Ocean. (b) In this high-resolution view, the ice iswrinkledand crisscrossed\nby long ridges. Where these ridges intersect, we can see which ones are older and which younger; the younger ones cross over the\nolder ones. While superficially this system of ridges resembles a giant freeway system onEuropa, the ridges are much wider than\nour freeways and are a natural result of the flexing of the moon. (credit a: modification of work by NASA/JPL/University of Arizona;\ncredit b: modification of work by NASA/JPL)\nIt is very difficult to make straight lines on a planetary surface. In discussingMars, we explained that when\nPercival Lowell saw what appeared to him to be straight lines (the so-called martian \u201ccanals\u201d), he attributed\nthem to the engineering efforts of intelligent beings. We now know the lines on Mars were optical illusions,\nbut the lines on Europa are real. These long cracks can form in the icy crust if it is floating without much\nfriction on an ocean of liquid water (Figure 12.6).\nFigure12.6Very High-Resolution Galileo Image of One Young Double Ridge on Europa.The area in this picture is only 15\nkilometers across. It appears to have formed when viscous icy material was forced up through a long, straight crack in the crust.\nNote how the young ridge going from top left toward bottom right lies on top of older features, which are themselves on top of even\nolder ones. (credit: modification of work by NASA/JPL)\nThe close-up Galileo images appear to confirm the existence of a global ocean. In many places, the surface of\nEuropalooks just as we would expect for a thick layer of ice that was broken up into giant icebergs and ice\nfloes and then refrozen in place. When the ice breaks, water or slush from below may be able to seep up\nthrough the cracks and make the ridges and multiple-line features we observe. Many episodes of ice cracking,\nshifting, rotating, and refreezing are required to explain the complexity we see. The icy crust might vary in\nthickness from a kilometer or so up to 20 kilometers. Further confirmation that a liquid ocean exists below the 388 12 \u2022 Rings, Moons, and Pluto\nice comes from measurements of the small magnetic field induced by Europa\u2019s interactions with the\nmagnetosphere of Jupiter. The \u201cmagnetic signature\u201d of Europa is that of a liquid water ocean, not one of ice or\nrock.\nIf Europa really has a large ocean of liquid water under its ice, then it may be the only place in the solar\n1\nsystem, other than Earth, with really large amounts of liquid water. To remain liquid, this ocean must be\nwarmed by heat escaping from the interior of Europa. Hot (or at least warm) springs might be active there,\nanalogous to those we have discovered in the deep oceans of Earth. The necessary internal heat is generated\nby tidal heating (see the discussion later in this chapter).\nLINK TO LEARNING\nAshort film(https://openstax.org/l/30Europa)with planetary scientist Kevin Hand explains why Europa is\nso interesting for future exploration. Or listen to thismore in-depth talk(https://openstax.org/l/30Europa2)\non Europa.\nWhat makes the idea of an ocean with warm springs exciting is the discovery in Earth\u2019s oceans of large\necosystems clustered around deep ocean hot springs. Such life derives all its energy from the mineral-laden\nwater and thrives independent of the sunlight shining on Earth\u2019s surface. Is it possible that similar ecosystems\ncould exist today under the ice of Europa?\nMany scientists now think that Europa is the most likely place beyond Earth to find life in the solar system. In\nresponse, NASA is designing a Europa mission to characterize its liquid ocean and its ice crust, and to identify\nlocations where material from inside has risen to the surface. Such interior material might reveal direct\nevidence for microbial life. This \u201cEuropa Clipper\u201d mission will not orbit Europa, where the intense energetic\nparticles from Jupiter\u2019s magnetosphere would quickly destroy its electronics, but instead will swoop in for brief\nclose flybys. It is planned for launch in 2024.\nlo, a Volcanic Moon\nIo, the innermost of Jupiter\u2019s Galilean moons, is in many ways a close twin of our Moon, with nearly the same\nsize and density. We might therefore expect it to have experienced a similar history. Its appearance, as\nphotographed from space, tells us another story, however (Figure 12.7). Instead of being a dead cratered\nworld, Io turns out to have the highest level of volcanism in the solar system, greatly exceeding that of Earth.\n1 Ganymede and Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus may have smaller amounts of liquid water under their surfaces.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.2 \u2022 The Galilean Moons of Jupiter 389\nFigure12.7Two Sides of Io.This composite image shows both sides of the volcanically active moonIo. The orange deposits are\nsulfur snow; the white is sulfur dioxide. (Carl Sagan once quipped that Io looks as if it desperately needs a shot of penicillin.) (credit:\nmodification of work by NASA/JPL/USGS)\nIo\u2019s active volcanism was discovered by the Voyager spacecraft. Eight volcanoes were seen erupting when\nVoyager 1 passed in March 1979, and six of these were still active four months later when Voyager 2 passed.\nWith the improved instruments carried by the Galileo spacecraft, more than 50 eruptions were found during\n1997 alone. Many of the eruptions produce graceful plumes that extend hundreds of kilometers out into space\n(Figure 12.8).\nFigure12.8Volcanic Eruptions on Io.This composite image from NASA\u2019s Galileo spacecraft shows close-ups (the two inset photos)\nof two separate volcanic eruptions on Jupiter\u2019s volcanic moon, Io. In the upper inset image, you can see a close up of a bluish plume\nrising about 140 kilometers above the surface of the volcano. In the lower inset image is the Prometheus plume, rising about 75\nkilometers from Io\u2019s surface. The Prometheus plume is named for the Greek god of fire.

When these icy deposits are\nsuddenly heated, the result is great eruptive plumes far larger than any ejected from terrestrial volcanoes. As\nthe rising plumes cool, the sulfur and sulfur dioxide recondense as solid particles that fall back to the surface\nin colorful \u201csnowfalls\u201d that extend as much as a thousand kilometers from the vent. Major new surface\nfeatures were even seen to appear between Galileo orbits, as shown inFigure 12.9.\nFigure12.9Volcanic Changes on Io.These three images were taken of the same 1700-kilometer-square region ofIoin April 1997,\nSeptember 1997, and July 1999. The dark volcanic center called Pillan Patera experienced a huge eruption, producing a dark deposit\nsome 400 kilometers across (seen as the grey area in the upper center of the middle image). In the right image, however, some of\nthe new dark deposit is already being covered by reddish material from the volcano Pele. Also, a small unnamed volcano to the right\nof Pillan has erupted since 1997, and some of its dark deposit and a yellow ring around it are visible on the right image (to the right\nof the grey spot). The color range is exaggerated in these images. (credit: modification of work by NASA/JPL/University of Arizona)\nAs the Galileo mission drew to a close, controllers were willing to take risks in getting close to Io. Approaching\nthis moon is a dangerous maneuver because the belts of atomic particles trapped in Jupiter\u2019s magnetic\nenvironment are at their most intense near Io\u2019s orbit. Indeed, in its very first pass by Io, the spacecraft\nabsorbed damaging radiation beyond its design levels. To keep the system working at all, controllers had to\nmodify or disable various fault-protection software routines in the onboard computers. In spite of these\ndifficulties, the spacecraft achieved four successful Io flybys, obtaining photos and spectra of the surface with\nunprecedented resolution.\nMaps of Io reveal more than 100 recently active volcanoes. Huge flows spread out from many of these vents,\ncovering about 25% of the moon\u2019s total surface with still-warm lava. From these measurements, it seems clear\nthat the bright surface colors that first attracted attention to Io are the result of a thin veneer of sulfur\ncompounds. The underlying volcanism is driven by eruptions of molten silicates, just like on Earth (Figure\n12.10).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.2 \u2022 The Galilean Moons of Jupiter 391\nFigure12.10Lava Fountains on Io.Galileo captured a number of eruptions along the chain of huge volcanic calderas (or pits) onIo\ncalled Tvashtar Catena in this false-color image combining infrared and visible light. The bright orange-yellow areas at left are places\nwhere fresh, hot lava is erupting from below ground. (credit: modification of work by NASA/JPL)\nTidal Heating\nHow canIoremain volcanically active in spite of its small size? The answer, as we hinted earlier, lies in the\neffect of gravity, throughtidal heating. Io is about the same distance from Jupiter as our Moon is from Earth.\nYet Jupiter is more than 300 times more massive than Earth, causing forces that pull Io into an elongated\nshape, with a several-kilometer-high bulge extending toward Jupiter.\nIf Io always kept exactly the same face turned toward Jupiter, this bulge would not generate heat. However,\nIo\u2019s orbit is not exactly circular due to gravitational perturbations (tugs) from Europa and Ganymede. In its\nslightly eccentric orbit, Io twists back and forth with respect to Jupiter, at the same time moving nearer and\nfarther from the planet on each revolution. The twisting and flexing heat Io, much as repeated flexing of a wire\ncoat hanger heats the wire.\nAfter billions of years, this constant flexing and heating have taken their toll on Io, driving away water and\ncarbon dioxide and other gases, so that now sulfur and sulfur compounds are the most volatile materials\nremaining. Its interior is entirely melted, and the crust itself is constantly recycled by volcanic activity.\nIn moving inward toward Jupiter from Callisto to Io, we have encountered more and more evidence of\ngeological activity and internal heating, culminating in the violent volcanism on Io. Three of these surfaces are\ncompared inFigure 12.11. Just as the character of the planets in our solar system depends in large measure on\ntheir distance from the Sun (and on the amount of heat they receive), so it appears that distance from a giant\nplanet like Jupiter can play a large role in the composition and evolution of its moons (at least partly due to\ndifferences in internal heating of each moon by Jupiter\u2019s unrelenting tidal forces). 392 12 \u2022 Rings, Moons, and Pluto\nFigure12.11Three Icy Moons.These Galileo images compare the surfaces ofEuropa,Ganymede, andCallistoat the same\nresolution.

The Cassini\nobservations of Titan have provided some of the most exciting recent discoveries in planetary science.\nNeptune\u2019s moon Triton also has unusual characteristics and resembles Pluto, which we will discuss in the\nfollowing section.\nTitan, a Moon with Atmosphere and Hydrocarbon Lakes\nTitan, first seen in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, was the first moon discovered after\nGalileo saw the four large moons of Jupiter. Titan has roughly the same diameter, mass, and density as Callisto\nor Ganymede. Presumably it also has a similar composition\u2014about half ice and half rock. However, Titan is\nunique among moons, with a thick atmosphere and lakes and rivers and falling rain (although these are not\ncomposed of water but of hydrocarbons such as ethane and methane, which can stay liquid at the frigid\ntemperatures on Titan). Titan is the only moon or planet other than Earth where we have found evidence of\nbodies of surface liquids.\nThe 1980 Voyager flyby of Titan determined that the surface density of its atmosphere is four times greater\nthan that on Earth. The atmospheric pressure on this moon is 1.6 bars, higher than that on any other moon\nand, remarkably, even higher than that of the terrestrial planets Mars and Earth. The atmospheric composition\nis primarily nitrogen, an important way in which Titan\u2019s atmosphere resembles Earth\u2019s.\nAlso detected in Titan\u2019s atmosphere were carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (compounds of hydrogen and\ncarbon) such as methane (CH ), ethane (C H ), and propane (C H ), and nitrogen compounds such as\n4 2 6 3 8\nhydrogen cyanide (HCN), cyanogen (C N ), and cyanoacetylene (HC N). Their presence indicates an active\n2 2 3\nchemistry in which sunlight interacts with atmospheric nitrogen and methane to create a rich mix of organic\nmolecules. There are also multiple layers of hydrocarbon haze and clouds in the atmosphere, as illustrated in\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.3 \u2022 Titan and Triton 393\nFigure 12.12.\nFigure12.12Structure of Titan\u2019s Atmosphere.Some characteristics ofTitan\u2019s atmosphereresemble those of Earth\u2019s atmosphere,\nalthough it is much colder than our planet. The red line indicates the temperature of Titan\u2019s atmosphere at different altitudes.\nThese Voyager discoveries motivated a much more ambitious exploration program using the NASA Cassini\nSaturn orbiter and a probe to land on Titan called Huygens, built by the European Space Agency. The orbiter,\nwhich included several cameras, spectrometers, and a radar imaging system, made dozens of close flybys of\nTitan between 2004 and 2015, each yielding radar and infrared images of portions of the surface (see\nExploring the Outer Planets). The Huygens probe successfully descended by parachute through the\natmosphere, photographing the surface from below the clouds, and landing on January 14, 2005. This was the\nfirst (and so far the only) spacecraft landing on a moon in the outer solar system.\nAt the end of its parachute descent, the 319-kilogram Huygens probe safely touched down, slid a short\ndistance, and began sending data back to Earth, including photos and analyses of the atmosphere. It\nappeared to have landed on a flat, boulder-strewn plain, but both the surface and the boulders were\ncomposed of water ice, which is as hard as rock at the temperature of Titan (seeFigure 12.13).\nThe photos taken during descent showed a variety of features, including drainage channels, suggesting that\nHuygens had landed on the shore of an ancient hydrocarbon lake. The sky was deep orange, and the\nbrightness of the Sun was a thousand times less than sunlight on Earth (but still more than a hundred times\nbrighter than under the full moon on Earth).Titan\u2019s surfacetemperature was 94 K (\u2212179 \u00b0C). The warmer\nspacecraft heated enough of the ice where it landed for its instruments to measure released hydrocarbon gas.\nMeasurements on the surface continued for more than an hour before the probe succumbed to the frigid\ntemperature. 394 12 \u2022 Rings, Moons, and Pluto\nFigure12.13Views of the Surface of Titan.The left image shows the views ofTitanfrom the descent camera, in a flattened\nprojection, at different altitudes.

There are large methane lakes near the\npolar regions that interact with the methane in the atmosphere, much as Earth\u2019s water oceans interact with\nthe water vapor in our atmosphere. The presence of many erosional features indicates that atmospheric\nmethane can condense and fall as rain, then flow down valleys to the big lakes. Thus, Titan has a low-\ntemperature equivalent of the water cycle on Earth, with liquid on the surface that evaporates, forms clouds,\nand then condenses to fall as rain\u2014but on Titan the liquid is a combination of methane, ethane, and a trace of\nother hydrocarbons. It is a weirdly familiar and yet utterly alien landscape.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.3 \u2022 Titan and Triton 395\nFigure12.14Titan\u2019s Lakes.(a) This Cassini image from a September 2006 flyby shows the liquid lakes onTitan. Their composition is\nmost likely a combination of methane and ethane. (Since this is a radar image, the colors are artificially added. The dark blue areas\nare the smooth surfaces of the liquid lakes, and yellow is the rougher solid terrain around them.) (b) This mosaic of Titan\u2019s surface\nfrom the Cassini-Huygens mission shows in detail a high ridge area and many narrow, sinuous erosion channels that appear to be\npart of a widespread network of \u201crivers\u201d carved by flowing hydrocarbons. (credit a: modification of work by NASA/JPL-Caltech/USGS;\ncredit b; modification of work by NASA/JPL/ESA/University of Arizona)\nThese discoveries raise the question of whether there could be life on Titan. Hydrocarbons are fundamental\nfor the formation of the large carbon molecules that are essential to life on our planet. However, the\ntemperature on Titan is far too low for liquid water or for many of the chemical processes that are essential to\nlife as we know it. There remains, though, an intriguing possibility that Titan might have developed a different\nform of low-temperature carbon-based life that could operate with liquid hydrocarbons playing the role of\nwater. The discovery of such \u201clife as we don\u2019t know it\u201d could be even more exciting than finding life like ours\non Mars. If such a truly alien life is present on Titan, its existence would greatly expand our understanding of\nthe nature of life and of habitable environments.\nNASA has selected a new mission to Titan for launch in 2027. CalledDragonfly, this mission is a drone that will\nfly in Titan\u2019s atmosphere, with emphasis on study of pre-biotic chemistry. Other future proposed missions\ninclude a balloon operating in the atmosphere and a \u201cboat\u201d floating in one of the Titan lakes.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe Cassini mission scientists and the visual presentation specialists at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory\nhave put together some nice films from the images taken by Cassini and Huygens. See, for example, the\nTitan approach(https://openstax.org/l/30Titan)and theflyover(https://openstax.org/l/30Titan2)of the\nNorthern lakes district.\nTriton and Its Volcanoes\nNeptune\u2019s largest moonTriton(don\u2019t get its name confused with Titan) has a diameter of 2720 kilometers and\na density of 2.1 g/cm3, indicating that it\u2019s probably composed of about 75% rock mixed with 25% water ice.\nMeasurements indicate that Triton\u2019s surface has the coldest temperature of any of the worlds our robot\nrepresentatives have visited. Because its reflectivity is so high (about 80%), Triton reflects most of the solar 396 12 \u2022 Rings, Moons, and Pluto\nenergy that falls on it, resulting in a surface temperature between 35 and 40 K.\nThe surface material of Triton is made of frozen water, nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide. Methane\nand nitrogen exist as gas in most of the solar system, but they are frozen at Triton\u2019s temperatures. Only a\nsmall quantity of nitrogen vapor persists to form an atmosphere. Although the surface pressure of this\natmosphere is only 16 millionths of a bar, this is sufficient to support thin haze or cloud layers.\nTriton\u2019s surface, like that of many other moons in the outer solar system, reveals a long history of geological\nevolution (Figure 12.15). Although some impact craters are found, many regions have been flooded fairly\nrecently by the local version of \u201clava\u201d (perhaps water or water-ammonia mixtures). There are also mysterious\nregions of jumbled or mountainous terrain.\nFigure12.15Neptune\u2019s Moon Triton.This mosaic of Voyager 2 images ofTritonshows a wide range of surface features. The\npinkish area at the bottom is Triton\u2019s large southern polar cap. The south pole of Triton faces the Sun here, and the slight heating\neffect is driving some of the material northward, where it is colder. (credit: modification of work by NASA/JPL/USGS)\nThe Voyager flyby of Triton took place at a time when the moon\u2019s southern pole was tipped toward the Sun,\nallowing this part of the surface to enjoy a period of relative warmth. (Remember that \u201cwarm\u201d on Triton is still\noutrageously colder than anything we experience on Earth.) A polar cap covers much of Triton\u2019s southern\nhemisphere, apparently evaporating along the northern edge. This polar cap may consist of frozen nitrogen\nthat was deposited during the previous winter.\nRemarkably, the Voyager images showed that the evaporation of Triton\u2019s polar cap generates geysers or\nvolcanic plumes of nitrogen gas (seeFigure 12.16). (Fountains of such gas rose about 10 kilometers high,\nvisible in the thin atmosphere because dust from the surface rose with them and colored them dark.) These\nplumes differ from the volcanic plumes of Io in their composition and also in that they derive their energy\nfrom sunlight warming the surface rather than from internal heat.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.4 \u2022 Pluto and Charon 397\nFigure12.16Triton\u2019s Geysers.This close-up view shows some of the geysers on Neptune\u2019s moonTriton, with the long trains of dust\npointing to the lower right in this picture.

Our understanding of Pluto (and its large moonCharon) have changed dramatically as a\nresult of the New Horizons flyby in 2015.\nIs Pluto a Planet?\nPlutowas discovered through a careful, systematic search, unlikeNeptune, whose position was calculated\nfrom gravitational theory. Nevertheless, the history of the search for Pluto began with indications that Uranus\nhad slight departures from its predicted orbit, departures that could be due to the gravitation of an\nundiscovered \u201cPlanet X.\u201d Early in the twentieth century, several astronomers, most notably PercivalLowell,\nthen at the peak of his fame as an advocate of intelligent life on Mars, became interested in searching for this\nninth planet.\nLowell and his contemporaries based their calculations primarily on tiny unexplained irregularities in the\nmotion of Uranus. Lowell\u2019s computations indicated two possible locations for a perturbing Planet X; the more\nlikely of the two was in the constellation Gemini. He predicted a mass for the planet intermediate between the\nmasses of Earth and Neptune (his calculations gave about 6 Earth masses). Other astronomers, however,\nobtained other solutions from the tiny orbital irregularities, even including one model that indicated two\nplanets beyond Neptune.\nAt his Arizona observatory, Lowell searched without success for the unknown planet from 1906 until his death\nin 1916, and the search was not renewed until 1929. In February 1930, a young observing assistant named\nClydeTombaugh(see theClyde Tombaugh: From the Farm to Famefeature box), comparing photographs he\nmade on January 23 and 29 of that year, found a faint object whose motion appeared to be about right for a 398 12 \u2022 Rings, Moons, and Pluto\nplanet far beyond the orbit of Neptune (Figure 12.17). The new planet was named for Pluto, the Roman god of\nthe underworld, who dwelt in remote darkness, just like the new planet. The choice of this name, among\nhundreds suggested, was helped by the fact that the first two letters were Percival Lowell\u2019s initials.\nFigure12.17Pluto\u2019s Motion.Portions of the two photographs by which Clyde Tombaugh discoveredPlutoin 1930. The left one was\ntaken on January 23 and the right on January 29. Note that Pluto, indicated by an arrow, has moved among the stars during those six\nnights. If we hadn\u2019t put an arrow next to it, though, you probably would never have spotted the dot that moved. (credit: modification\nof work by the Lowell Observatory Archives)\nAlthough the discovery of Pluto appeared initially to be a vindication of gravitational theory similar to the\nearlier triumph of Adams and Le Verrier in predicting the position of Neptune, we now know that Lowell\u2019s\ncalculations were wrong. When its mass and size were finally measured, it was found that Pluto could not\npossibly have exerted any measurable pull on either Uranus or Neptune. Astronomers are now convinced that\nthe reported small anomalies in the motions of Uranus are not, and never were, real.\nFrom the time of its discovery, it was clear that Pluto was not a giant like the other four outer solar system\nplanets. For a long time, it was thought that the mass of Pluto was similar to that of Earth, so that it was\nclassed as a fifth terrestrial planet, somehow misplaced in the far outer reaches of the solar system. There\nwere other anomalies, however, as Pluto\u2019s orbit was more eccentric and inclined to the plane of our solar\nsystem than that of any other planet. Only after the discovery of its moon Charon in 1978 could the mass of\nPluto be measured, and it turned out to be far less than the mass of Earth.\nIn addition to Charon, Pluto has four much smaller moons. Subsequent observations ofCharonshowed that\nthis moon is in a retrograde orbit and has a diameter of about 1200 kilometers, more than half the size of\nPluto itself (Figure 12.18). This makes Charon the moon whose size is the largest fraction of its parent planet.\nWe could even think of Pluto and Charon as a double world. Seen from Pluto, Charon would be as large as\neight full moons on Earth.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.4 \u2022 Pluto and Charon 399\nFigure12.18Comparison of the Sizes of Pluto and Its Moon Charon with Earth.This graphic vividly shows how tiny Pluto is\nrelative to a terrestrial planet like Earth. That is the primary justification for putting Pluto in the class of dwarf planets rather than\nterrestrial planets. (credit: modification of work by NASA)\nTo many astronomers, Pluto seemed like the odd cousin that everyone hopes will not show up at the next\nfamily reunion. Neither its path around the Sun nor its size resembles either the giant planets or the terrestrial\nplanets. In the 1990s, astronomers began to discover additional small objects in the far outer solar system,\nshowing that Pluto was not unique. We will discuss these trans-neptunian objects later with other small\nbodies, in the chapter onComets and Asteroids: Debris of the Solar System. One of them (calledEris) is nearly\nthe same size as Pluto, and another (Makemake) is substantially smaller. It became clear to astronomers that\nPluto was so different from the other planets that it needed a new classification. Therefore, it was called a\ndwarf planet, meaning a planet much smaller than the terrestrial planets. We now know of many small objects\nin the vicinity of Pluto and we have classified several asdwarf planets.\nA similar history was associated with the discovery of theasteroids. When the first asteroid (Ceres) was\ndiscovered at the beginning of the nineteenth century, it was hailed as a new planet. In the following years,\nhowever, other objects were found with similar orbits to Ceres. Astronomers decided that these should not all\nbe considered planets, so they invented a new class of objects, called minor planets or asteroids. Today, Ceres\nis also called a dwarf planet. Both minor planets and dwarf planets are part of a whole belt or zones of similar\nobjects (as we will discuss inComets and Asteroids: Debris of the Solar System).\nSo, isPlutoa planet? Our answer is yes, but it is adwarf planet, clearly not in the same league with the eight\nmajor planets (four giants and four terrestrials). While some people were upset when Pluto was reclassified,\nwe might point out that a dwarf tree is still a type of tree and (as we shall see) a dwarf galaxy is still a type of\ngalaxy.\nVOYAGERS IN ASTRONOMY\nClyde Tombaugh: From the Farm to Fame\nClydeTombaughdiscovered Pluto when he was 24 years old, and his position as staff assistant at the Lowell\nObservatory was his first paying job. Tombaugh had been born on a farm in Illinois, but when he was 16, his\nfamily moved to Kansas. There, with his uncle\u2019s encouragement, he observed the sky through a telescope 400 12 \u2022 Rings, Moons, and Pluto\nthe family had ordered from the Sears catalog. Tombaugh later constructed a larger telescope on his own\nand devoted his nights (when he wasn\u2019t too tired from farm work) to making detailed sketches of the\nplanets (Figure 12.19).\nFigure12.19Clyde Tombaugh (1906\u20131997).(a) Tombaugh is pictured on his family farm in 1928 with a 9-inch telescope he built.\n(b) Here Tombaugh is looking through an eyepiece at the Lowell Observatory. (credit b: modification of work by NASA)\nIn 1928, after a hailstorm ruined the crop, Tombaugh decided he needed a job to help support his family.\nAlthough he had only a high school education, he thought of becoming a telescope builder. He sent his\nplanet sketches to the Lowell Observatory, seeking advice about whether such a career choice was realistic.\nBy a wonderful twist of fate, his query arrived just when the Lowell astronomers realized that a renewed\nsearch for a ninth planet would require a very patient and dedicated observer.\nThe large photographic plates (pieces of glass with photographic emulsion on them) that Tombaugh was\nhired to take at night and search during the day contained an average of about 160,000 star images each.\nHow to find Pluto among them? The technique involved taking two photographs about a week apart.\nDuring that week, a planet would move a tiny bit, while the stars remained in the same place relative to\neach other. A new instrument called a \u201cblink comparator\u201d could quickly alternate the two images in an\neyepiece. The stars, being in the same position on the two plates, would not appear to change as the two\nimages were \u201cblinked.\u201d But a moving object would appear to wiggle back and forth as the plates were\nalternated.\nAfter examining more than 2 million stars (and many false alarms), Tombaugh found his planet on February\n18, 1930. The astronomers at the observatory checked his results carefully, and the find was announced on\nMarch 13, the 149th anniversary of the discovery of Uranus. Congratulations and requests for interviews\npoured in from around the world. Visitors descended on the observatory in scores, wanting to see the place\nwhere the first new planet in almost a century had been discovered, as well as the person who had\ndiscovered it.\nIn 1932, Tombaugh took leave from Lowell, where he had continued to search and blink, to get a college\ndegree. Eventually, he received a master\u2019s degree in astronomy and taught navigation for the Navy during\nWorld War II. In 1955, after working to develop a rocket-tracking telescope, he became a professor at New\nMexico State University, where he helped found the astronomy department. He died in 1997; some of his\nashes were placed inside the New Horizons spacecraft to Pluto.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.4 \u2022 Pluto and Charon 401\nLINK TO LEARNING\nHere is atouching video(https://openstax.org/l/30Tbaugh)about Tombaugh\u2019s life as described by his\nchildren.\nThe Nature of Pluto\nAlmost everything we know about Pluto and its moons comes from the New Horizons spacecraft, which flew\nby in 2015 before traveling on into the outermost parts of the planetary system. Using data from the New\nHorizons probe, astronomers have measured the diameter ofPlutoas 2370 kilometers, only 60 percent as\nlarge as our Moon. From the diameter and mass, we find a density of 1.9 g/cm3, suggesting that Pluto is a\nmixture of rocky materials and water ice in about the same proportions as many outer-planet moons.\nParts of Pluto\u2019s surface are highly reflective, and its spectrum demonstrates the presence on its surface of\nfrozen methane, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen. The maximum surface temperature ranges from about 50 K\nwhen Pluto is farthest from the Sun to 60 K when it is closest. Even this small difference is enough to cause a\npartial sublimation (going from solid to gas) of the methane and nitrogen ice. This generates an atmosphere\nwhen Pluto is close to the Sun, and it freezes out when Pluto is farther away. Observations of distant stars seen\nthrough this thin atmosphere indicate that the surface pressure is about a ten-thousandth of Earth\u2019s. Because\nPluto is a few degrees warmer than Triton, its atmospheric pressure is about ten times greater. This\natmosphere contains several distinct haze layers, presumably caused by photochemical reactions, like those in\nTitan\u2019s atmosphere (Figure 12.20).\nFigure12.20Haze Layers in the Atmosphere of Pluto.This is one of the highest-resolution photos ofPluto, taken by the New\nHorizons spacecraft 15 minutes after its closest approach. It shows 12 layers of haze. Note also the range of mountains with heights\nup to 3500 meters. (credit: modification of work by NASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research\nInstitute)\nReaching Pluto with a spacecraft was a major challenge, especially in an era when reduced NASA budgets\ncould not support large, expensive missions like Galileo and Cassini. Yet like Galileo and Cassini, a Pluto\nmission would require a nuclear electric system that used the heat from plutonium to generate the energy to\npower the instruments and keep them operating far from the warmth of the Sun. NASA made available one of\nthe last of its nuclear generators for such a mission. Assuming an affordable but highly capable spacecraft\ncould be built, there was still the problem of getting to Pluto, nearly 5 billion kilometers from Earth, without\nwaiting decades. The answer was to use Jupiter\u2019s gravity to slingshot the spacecraft toward Pluto.\nThe 2006 launch ofNew Horizonsstarted the mission with a high speed, and the Jupiter flyby just a year later\ngave it the required additional boost. The New Horizons spacecraft arrived at Pluto in July 2015, traveling at a\nrelative speed of 14 kilometers per second (or about 50,000 kilometers per hour). With this high speed, the\nentire flyby sequence was compressed into just one day. Most of the data recorded near closest approach 402 12 \u2022 Rings, Moons, and Pluto\ncould not be transmitted to Earth until many months later, but when it finally arrived, astronomers were\nrewarded with a treasure trove of images and data.\nGeology of Pluto\nPlutois not the geologically dead world that many anticipated for such a small object\u2014far from it. The division\nof the surface into areas with different composition and surface texture is apparent in the global color photo\nshown inFigure 12.21. The reddish color is enhanced in this image to bring out differences in color more\nclearly. The darker parts of the surface are cratered, but adjacent to them is a nearly featureless light area in\nthe lower right quadrant of this image. This is a huge ice-filled depression called the Sputnik Plains, named for\nthe first artificial Earth satellite. The absence of impact craters suggests a surface no more than 10 million\nyears old. The dark areas show the colors of photochemical haze or smog similar to that in the atmosphere of\nTitan. The dark material that is staining these old surfaces could come from Pluto\u2019s atmospheric haze or from\nchemical reactions taking place at the surface due to the action of sunlight.\nFigure12.21Global Color Image of Pluto.This New Horizons image clearly shows the variety of terrains onPluto. The dark area in\nthe lower left is covered with impact craters, while the large light area in the center and lower right is a flat basin devoid of craters.\nThe colors you see are somewhat enhanced to bring out subtle differences.

Toward the right on this image, we see the shoreline of the Sputnik Plains, showing evidence of\nrelatively recent geological activity. The nitrogen and carbon monoxide ice that fills the Sputnik depression\nshows cells or polygons with an average width of more than 30 kilometers, caused by slow convection in the\n2\nice.\n2 In the process of convection, warmer material rises and colder material sinks, transferring energy. You are probably more familiar\nwith convection in warm fluids, like the cells you see when you are heating some kinds of soup, but it can also happen (very slowly)\nin colder substances.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.4 \u2022 Pluto and Charon 403\nFigure12.22Diversity of Terrain on Pluto.This enhanced color view of a strip of Pluto\u2019s surface about 80 kilometers long shows a\nvariety of different surface features. From left to right, we first cross a region of \u201cbadlands\u201d with some craters showing, and then\nmove across a wide range of mountains made of water ice and coated with the redder material we saw in the previous image. Then,\nat right, we arrive at the \u201cshoreline\u201d of the great sea of frozen nitrogen that the mission scientists have named the \u201cSputnik Plains.\u201d\nThis nitrogen sea is divided into mysterious cells or segments that are many kilometers across. (credit: modification of work by\nNASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute)\nFigure 12.23shows another view of the boundary between different types of geology. The width of this image\nis 250 kilometers, and it shows dark, ancient, heavily cratered terrain; dark, uncratered terrain with a hilly\nsurface; smooth, geologically young terrain; and a small cluster of mountains more than 3000 meters high. In\nthe best images, the light areas of nitrogen ice seem to have flowed much like glaciers on Earth, covering\nsome of the older terrain underneath them.\nThe isolated mountains in the midst of the smooth nitrogen plains are probably also made of water ice, which\nis very hard at the temperatures on Pluto and can float on frozen nitrogen. Additional mountains, and some\nhilly terrain that reminded the mission scientists of snakeskin, are visible in part (b) ofFigure 12.23.\nFigure12.23Diversity of Terrains on Pluto.(a) In this photo, about 250 kilometers across, we can see many different kinds of\nterrain. At the bottom are older, cratered highlands; a V-shaped region of hills without cratering points toward the bottom of the\nimage. Surrounding the V-shaped dark region is the smooth, brighter frozen nitrogen plain, acting as glaciers on Earth do. Some\nisolated mountains, made of frozen water ice, are floating in the nitrogen near the top of the picture. (b) This scene is about 390\nkilometers across. The rounded mountains, quite different from those we know on Earth, are named Tartarus Dorsa. The patterns,\nmade of repeating ridges with the more reddish terrain between them, are not yet understood.

Recall from earlier that Charon is roughly half Pluto\u2019s size (its diameter is about the size of\nTexas). Charon keeps the same side toward Pluto, just as our Moon keeps the same side toward Earth. What is\nunique about the Pluto-Charon system, however, is that Pluto also keeps its same face toward Charon. Like\ntwo dancers embracing, these two constantly face each other as they spin across the celestial dance floor.\nAstronomers call this a double tidal lock. 404 12 \u2022 Rings, Moons, and Pluto\nFigure12.24Pluto\u2019s Large Moon Charon.(a) In this New Horizons image, the color has been enhanced to bring out the color of the\nmoon\u2019s strange red polar cap.Charonhas a diameter of 1214 kilometers, and the resolution of this image is 3 kilometers. (b) Here\nwe see the moon from a slightly different angle, in true color. The inset shows an area about 390 kilometers from top to bottom.\nNear the top left is an intriguing feature\u2014what appears to be a mountain in the middle of a depression or moat. (credit a, b:\nmodification of work by NASA/JHUAPL/SwRI)\nWhat New Horizons showed was another complex world. There are scattered craters in the lower part of the\nimage, but much of the rest of the surface appears smooth. Crossing the center of the image is a belt of rough\nterrain, including what appear to be tectonic valleys, as if some forces had tried to split Charon apart. Topping\noff this strange image is a distinctly red polar cap, of unknown composition. Many features on Charon are not\nyet understood, including what appears to be a mountain in the midst of a low-elevation region.\n12.5 Planetary Rings (and Enceladus)\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the two theories of planetary ring formation\nCompare the major rings of Saturn and explain the role of the moon Enceladus in the formation of the E\nring\nExplain how the rings of Uranus and Neptune differ in composition and appearance from the rings of\nSaturn\nDescribe how ring structure is affected by the presence of moons\nIn addition to their moons, all four of the giant planets have rings, with eachring systemconsisting of billions\nof small particles or \u201cmoonlets\u201d orbiting close to their planet. Each of these rings displays a complicated\nstructure that is related to interactions between the ring particles and the larger moons. However, the four\nring systems are very different from each other in mass, structure, and composition, as outlined inTable 12.2.\nProperties of the Ring Systems\nPlanet Outer Radius Outer Radius Mass Reflectivity\n(km) (R ) (kg) (%)\nplanet\nJupiter 128,000 1.8 1010(?) ?\nSaturn 140,000 2.3 1019 60\nTable12.2\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.5 \u2022 Planetary Rings (and Enceladus) 405\nPlanet Outer Radius Outer Radius Mass Reflectivity\n(km) (R ) (kg) (%)\nplanet\nUranus 51,000 2.2 1014 5\nNeptune 63,000 2.5 1012 5\nTable12.2\nSaturn\u2019s large ring system is made up of icy particles spread out into several vast, flat rings containing a great\ndeal of fine structure. The Uranus and Neptune ring systems, on the other hand, are nearly the reverse of\nSaturn\u2019s: they consist of dark particles confined to a few narrow rings with broad empty gaps in between.\nJupiter\u2019s ring and at least one of Saturn\u2019s are merely transient dust bands, constantly renewed by dust grains\neroded from small moons. In this section, we focus on the two most massive ring systems, those of Saturn and\nUranus.\nWhat Causes Rings?\nA ring is a collection of vast numbers of particles, each like a tiny moon obeying Kepler\u2019s laws as it follows its\nown orbit around the planet. Thus, the inner particles revolve faster than those farther out, and the ring as a\nwhole does not rotate as a solid body. In fact, it is better not to think of a ring rotating at all, but rather to\nconsider the revolution (or motion in orbit) of its individual moonlets.\nIf the ring particles were widely spaced, they would move independently, like separate moonlets. However, in\nthe main rings of Saturn and Uranus the particles are close enough to exert mutual gravitational influence,\nand occasionally even to rub together or bounce off each other in low-speed collisions. Because of these\ninteractions, we see phenomena such as waves that move across the rings\u2014just the way water waves move\nover the surface of the ocean.\nThere are two basic ideas of how such rings come to be. First is thebreakup hypothesis, which suggests that\nthe rings are the remains of a shattered moon. A passing comet or asteroid might have collided with the\nmoon, breaking it into pieces. Tidal forces then pulled the fragments apart, and they dispersed into a disk. The\nsecond hypothesis, which takes the reverse perspective, suggests that the rings are made of particles that\nwere unable to come together to form a moon in the first place.\nIn either theory, the gravity of the planet plays an important role. Close to the planet (seeFigure 12.25), tidal\nforces can tear bodies apart or inhibit loose particles from coming together. We do not know which\nexplanation holds for any given ring, although many scientists have concluded that at least a few of the rings\nare relatively young and must therefore be the result of breakup. 406 12 \u2022 Rings, Moons, and Pluto\nFigure12.25Four Ring Systems.This diagram shows the locations of thering systemsof the four giant planets. The left axis\nrepresents the planet\u2019s surface. The dotted vertical line is the limit inside which gravitational forces can break up moons (each\nplanet\u2019s system is drawn to a different scale, so that this stability limit lines up for all four of them). The black dots are the inner\nmoons of each planet on the same scale as its rings. Notice that only really small moons survive inside the stability limit.\nRings of Saturn\nSaturn\u2019s ringsare one of the most beautiful sights in the solar system (Figure 12.26). From outer to inner, the\nthree brightest rings are labeled with the extremely unromantic names of A, B, and C Rings.Table 12.3gives\nthe dimensions of the rings in both kilometers and units of the radius of Saturn,R . The B Ring is the\nSaturn\nbrightest and has the most closely packed particles, whereas the A and C Rings are translucent.\nThe total mass of the B Ring, which is probably close to the mass of the entire ring system, is about equal to\nthat of an icy moon 250 kilometers in diameter (suggesting that the ring could have originated in the breakup\nof such a moon). Between the A and B Rings is a wide gap named the Cassini Division after Gian Domenico\nCassini, who first glimpsed it through a telescope in 1675 and whose name planetary scientists also gave to the\nCassini spacecraft that explored the Saturn system.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.5 \u2022 Planetary Rings (and Enceladus) 407\nFigure12.26Saturn\u2019s Rings as Seen from Above and Below.(a) The view from above is illuminated by direct sunlight.

The width of the main rings is 70,000 kilometers, yet their average\nthickness is only 20 meters. If we made a scale model of the rings out of paper, we would have to make them 1\nkilometer across. On this scale, Saturn itself would loom as high as an 80-story building. The ring particles are\ncomposed primarily of water ice, and they range from grains the size of sand up to house-sized boulders. An\ninsider\u2019s view of the rings would probably resemble a bright cloud of floating snowflakes and hailstones, with\na few snowballs and larger objects, many of them loose aggregates of smaller particles (Figure 12.27).\n3 The ring letters are assigned in the order of their discovery. 408 12 \u2022 Rings, Moons, and Pluto\nFigure12.27Artist\u2019s Idealized Impression of the Rings of Saturn as Seen from the Inside.Note that the rings are mostly made\nof pieces of water ice of different sizes. Toward the end of its mission, the Cassini spacecraft got nearer to the rings of Saturn, but it\nnever got this close. (credit: modification of work by NASA/JPL/University of Colorado)\nIn addition to the broad A, B, and C Rings, Saturn has a handful of very narrow rings no more than 100\nkilometers wide. The most substantial of these, which lies just outside the A Ring, is called theF Ring; its\nsurprising appearance is discussed below. In general, Saturn\u2019s narrow rings resemble the rings of Uranus and\nNeptune.\nThere is also a very faint, tenuous ring, called the E Ring, associated with Saturn\u2019s small icy moonEnceladus.\nThe particles in the E Ring are very small and composed of water ice. Since such a tenuous cloud of ice crystals\nwill tend to dissipate, the ongoing existence of the E Ring strongly suggests that it is being continually\nreplenished by a source at Enceladus. This icy moon is very small\u2014only 500 kilometers in diameter\u2014but the\nVoyager images showed that the craters on about half of its surface have been erased, indicating geological\nactivity sometime in the past few million years. It was with great anticipation that the Cassini scientists\nmaneuvered the spacecraft orbit to allow multiple close flybys of Enceladus starting in 2005.\nThose awaiting the Cassini flyby results were not disappointed. High-resolution images showed long, dark\nstripes of smooth ground near its south pole, which were soon nicknamed \u201ctiger stripes\u201d (Figure 12.28).\nInfrared measurements revealed that these tiger stripes are warmer than their surroundings. Best of all,\ndozens of cryovolcanic vents on the tiger stripes were seen to be erupting geysers of salty water and ice\n(Figure 12.29). Estimates suggested that 200 kilograms of material were shooting into space each second\u2014not\na lot, but enough for the spacecraft to sample.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.5 \u2022 Planetary Rings (and Enceladus) 409\nFigure12.28Enceladus.(a) This image shows both smooth and cratered terrain on Saturn\u2019s moon, and also \u201ctiger stripes\u201d in the\nsouth polar region (lower part of image). These dark stripes (shown here in exaggerated color) have elevated temperatures and are\nthe source of the many geysers discovered onEnceladus. They are about 130 kilometers long and 40 kilometers apart. (b) Here\nEnceladus is shown to scale with Great Britain and the coast of Western Europe, to emphasize that it is a small moon, only about 500\nkilometers in diameter. (credit a, b: modification of work by NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute)\nWhen Cassini was directed to fly into the plumes, it measured their composition and found them to be similar\nto material we see liberated from comets (seeComets and Asteroids: Debris of the Solar System). The vapor\nand ice plumes consisted mostly of water, but with trace amounts of nitrogen, ammonia, methane, and other\nhydrocarbons. Minerals found in the geysers in trace amounts included ordinary salt, meaning that the geyser\nplumes were high-pressure sprays of salt water.\nBased on the continuing study of Enceladus\u2019 bulk properties and the ongoing geysers, in 2015 the Cassini\nmission scientists tentatively identified a subsurface ocean of water feeding the geysers. These discoveries\nsuggested that in spite of its small size, Enceladus should be added to the list of worlds that we would like to\nexplore for possible life. Since its subsurface ocean is conveniently escaping into space, it might be much\neasier to sample than the ocean of Europa, which is deeply buried below its thick crust of ice. 410 12 \u2022 Rings, Moons, and Pluto\nFigure12.29Geysers on Enceladus.This Cassini image shows a number of water geysers on Saturn\u2019s small moonEnceladus,\napparently salty water from a subsurface source escaping through cracks in the surface.

The nine main rings were\ndiscovered in 1977 from observations made of a star as Uranus passed in front of it. We call such a passage of\none astronomical object in front of another anoccultation. During the 1977 occultation, astronomers expected\nthe star\u2019s light to disappear as the planet moved across it. But in addition, the star dimmed briefly several\ntimes before Uranus reached it, as each narrow ring passed between the star and the telescope. Thus, the\nrings were mapped out in detail even though they could not be seen or photographed directly, like counting\nthe number of cars in a train at night by watching the blinking of a light as the cars successively pass in front\nof it. When Voyager approached Uranus in 1986, it was able to study the rings at close range; the spacecraft\nalso photographed two new rings (Figure 12.30).\nFigure12.30Rings of Uranus.The Voyager team had to expose this image for a long time to get a glimpse of Uranus\u2019 narrow dark\nrings.

It is only about 100 kilometers\nwide and probably no more than 100 meters thick (similar to the F Ring of Saturn). The Epsilon Ring encircles\nUranus at a distance of 51,000 kilometers, about twice the radius of Uranus. This ring probably contains as\nmuch mass as all of Uranus\u2019 other ten rings combined; most of them are narrow ribbons less than 10\nkilometers wide, just the reverse of the broad rings of Saturn.\nThe individual particles in the uranian rings are nearly as black as lumps of coal. While astronomers do not\nunderstand the composition of this material in detail, it seems to consist in large part of carbon and\nhydrocarbon compounds. Organic material of this sort is rather common in the outer solar system. Many of\nthe asteroids and comets are also composed of dark, tarlike materials. In the case of Uranus, its ten small\ninner moons have a similar composition, suggesting that one or more moons might have broken up to make\nthe rings.\nNeptune\u2019s ringsare generally similar to those ofUranusbut even more tenuous (Figure 12.31). There are only\nfour of them, and the particles are not uniformly distributed along their lengths. Because these rings are so\ndifficult to investigate from Earth, it will probably be a long time before we understand them very well.\nFigure12.31Rings of Neptune.This long exposure ofNeptune\u2019s ringswas photographed by Voyager 2.

This is a much higher resolution than can be obtained in a\nconventional photo of the rings. Let\u2019s figure out what angular resolution (in arcsec) a space telescope in 412 12 \u2022 Rings, Moons, and Pluto\nEarth orbit would have to achieve to obtain equal resolution.\nSolution\nTo solve this problem, we use the \u201csmall-angle formula\u201d to relate angular and linear diameters in the sky.\nFor angles in the sky that are small, the formula is usually written as\nwhere angular diameter is expressed in arcsec. The distance of Saturn near opposition is about\n9 AU = 1.4 \u00d7 109km. Substituting in the above formula and solving for the angular resolution, we get\nwhich is about 10\u22123arcsec, or a milliarcsec. This is not possible for our telescopes to achieve. For\ncomparison, the best resolution from either the Hubble Space Telescope or ground-based telescopes is\nabout 0.1 arcsec, or 100 times worse than what we would need. This is why such occultation measurements\nare so useful for astronomers.\nCheck Your Learning\nHow close to Saturn would a spacecraft have to be to make out detail in its rings as small as 20 km, if its\ncamera has an angular resolution of 5 arcsec?\nAnswer:\nUsing our formula,\nwe get\nSo, the distance is about 825,000 km.\nInteractions between Rings and Moons\nMuch of our fascination with planetary rings is a result of their intricate structures, most of which owe their\nexistence to the gravitational effect of moons, without which the rings would be flat and featureless. Indeed, it\nis becoming clear that without moons there would probably be no rings at all because, left to themselves, thin\ndisks of small particles gradually spread and dissipate.\nMost of the gaps inSaturn\u2019s rings, and also the location of the outer edge of the A Ring, result from\ngravitational resonances with small inner moons. Aresonancetakes place when two objects have orbital\nperiods that are exact ratios of each other, such as 1:2 or 2:3. For example, any particle in the gap at the inner\nside of the Cassini Division of Saturn\u2019s rings would have a period equal to one-half that of Saturn\u2019s moon\nMimas. Such a particle would be nearest Mimas in the same part of its orbit every second revolution. The\nrepeated gravitational tugs of Mimas, acting always in the same direction, would perturb it, forcing it into a\nnew orbit outside the gap. In this way, the Cassini Division became depleted of ring material over long periods\nof time.\nThe Cassini mission revealed a great deal of fine structure in Saturn\u2019s rings. Unlike the earlier Voyager flybys,\nCassini was able to observe the rings for more than a decade, revealing a remarkable range of changes, on\ntime scales from a few minutes to several years. Many of the features newly seen in Cassini data indicated the\npresence of condensations or small moons only a few tens of meters across imbedded in the rings. As each\nsmall moon moves, it produces waves in the surrounding ring material like the wake left by a moving ship.\nEven when the moon is too small to be resolved, its characteristic waves could be photographed by Cassini.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12.5 \u2022 Planetary Rings (and Enceladus) 413\nOne of the most interesting rings of Saturn is the narrowF Ring, which contains several apparent ringlets\nwithin its 90-kilometer width. In places, the F Ring breaks up into two or three parallel strands that sometimes\nshow bends or kinks. Most of the rings of Uranus and Neptune are also narrow ribbons like the F Ring of\nSaturn. Clearly, the gravity of some objects must be keeping the particles in these thin rings from spreading\nout.\nAs we have seen, the largest features in the rings of Saturn are produced by gravitational resonances with the\ninner moons, while much of the fine structure is caused by smaller embedded moons. In the case of Saturn\u2019s F\nRing, close-up images revealed that it is bounded by the orbits of two moons, called Pandora and Prometheus\n(Figure 12.32). These two small moons (each about 100 kilometers in diameter) are referred to asshepherd\nmoons, since their gravitation serves to \u201cshepherd\u201d the ring particles and keep them confined to a narrow\nribbon. A similar situation applies to the Epsilon Ring ofUranus, which is shepherded by the moons Cordelia\nand Ophelia. These two shepherds, each about 50 kilometers in diameter, orbit about 2000 kilometers inside\nand outside the ring.\nFigure12.32Saturn\u2019s F Ring and Its Shepherd Moons.(a) This Cassini image shows the narrow, complexF Ringof Saturn, with its\ntwo small shepherd moons Pandora (left) and Prometheus (right). (b) In this closer view, the shepherd moon Pandora (84 kilometers\nacross) is seen next to the F ring, in which the moon is perturbing the main (brightest) strand of ring particles as it passes. You can\nsee the dark side of Pandora on this image because it is being illuminated by the light reflected from Saturn. (credit a, b:\nmodification of work by NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nYou can download amovie(https://openstax.org/l/30ShprdMns)showing the two shepherd moons on\neither side of Saturn\u2019s F ring.\nTheoretical calculations suggest that the other narrow rings in the uranian and neptunian systems should also\nbe controlled by shepherd moons, but none has been located. The calculated diameter for such shepherds\n(about 10 kilometers) was just at the limit of detectability for the Voyager cameras, so it is impossible to say\nwhether they are present or not. (Given all the narrow rings we see, some scientists still hope to find another\nmore satisfactory mechanism for keeping them confined.) 414 12 \u2022 Rings, Moons, and Pluto\nOne of the outstanding problems with understanding the rings is determining their ages. Have the giant\nplanets always had the ring systems we see today, or might these be a recent or transient addition to the solar\nsystem? In the case of the main rings of Saturn, their mass is about the same as that of the inner moon\nMimas. Thus, they could have been formed by the break-up of a Mimas-sized moon, perhaps very early in solar\nsystem history, when there were many interplanetary projectiles left over from planet formation. It is harder to\nunderstand how such a catastrophic event could have taken place recently, when the solar system had\nbecome a more stable place.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12 \u2022 Key Terms 415\nKey Terms\nresonance an orbital condition in which one object is subject to periodic gravitational perturbations by\nanother, most commonly arising when two objects orbiting a third have periods of revolution that are\nsimple multiples or fractions of each other\ntidal heating the heating of a planet or moon\u2019s interior by variable tidal forces caused by changing\ngravitational pull from a nearby planet or moon\nSummary\n12.1Ring and Moon Systems Introduced\nThe four jovian planets are accompanied by impressive systems of moons and rings. Nearly 200 moons have\nbeen discovered in the outer solar system. Of the four ring systems, Saturn\u2019s is the largest and is composed\nprimarily of water ice; in contrast, Uranus and Neptune have narrow rings of dark material, and Jupiter has a\ntenuous ring of dust.\n12.2The Galilean Moons of Jupiter\nJupiter\u2019s largest moons are Ganymede and Callisto, both low-density objects that are composed of more than\nhalf water ice. Callisto has an ancient cratered surface, while Ganymede shows evidence of extensive tectonic\nand volcanic activity, persisting until perhaps a billion years ago. Io and Europa are denser and smaller, each\nabout the size of our Moon. Io is the most volcanically active object in the solar system. Various lines of\nevidence indicate that Europa has a global ocean of liquid water under a thick ice crust. Many scientists think\nthat Europa may offer the most favorable environment in the solar system to search for life.\n12.3Titan and Triton\nSaturn\u2019s moon Titan has an atmosphere that is thicker than that of Earth. There are lakes and rivers of liquid\nhydrocarbons, and evidence of a cycle of evaporation, condensation, and return to the surface that is similar to\nthe water cycle on Earth (but with liquid methane and ethane). The Cassini-Huygens lander set down on Titan\nand showed a scene with boulders, made of water ice, frozen harder than rock. Neptune\u2019s cold moon Triton\nhas a very thin atmosphere and nitrogen gas geysers.\n12.4Pluto and Charon\nPluto and Charon have been revealed by the New Horizons spacecraft to be two of the most fascinating\nobjects in the outer solar system. Pluto is small (a dwarf planet) but also surprisingly active, with contrasting\nareas of dark cratered terrain, light-colored basins of nitrogen ice, and mountains of frozen water that may be\nfloating in the nitrogen ice. Even Pluto\u2019s largest moon Charon shows evidence of geological activity. Both Pluto\nand Charon turn out to be far more dynamic and interesting than could have been imagined before the New\nHorizons mission.\n12.5Planetary Rings (and Enceladus)\nRings are composed of vast numbers of individual particles orbiting so close to a planet that its gravitational\nforces could have broken larger pieces apart or kept small pieces from gathering together. Saturn\u2019s rings are\nbroad, flat, and nearly continuous, except for a handful of gaps. The particles are mostly water ice, with typical\ndimensions of a few centimeters. One Saturn moon, Enceladus, is today erupting geysers of water to maintain\nthe tenuous E Ring, which is composed of very small ice crystals. The rings of Uranus are narrow ribbons\nseparated by wide gaps and contain much less mass. Neptune\u2019s rings are similar but contain even less\nmaterial. Much of the complex structure of the rings is due to waves and resonances induced by moons within\nthe rings or orbiting outside them. The origin and age of each of these ring systems is still a mystery. 416 12 \u2022 For Further Exploration\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nMoons\nCarroll, M. \u201cTitan: What We\u2019ve Learned about a Strange New World.\u201dAstronomy(March 2010): 30.

Imagine it\u2019s the distant future and humans can now travel easily among the planets. Your group is a travel\nagency, with the task of designing a really challenging tour of the Galilean moons for a group of sports\nenthusiasts. What kinds of activities are possible on each world? How would rock climbing on Ganymede,\nfor example, differ from rock climbing on Earth? (If you design an activity for Io, you had better bring\nalong very strong radiation shielding. Why?)\nB. In the same spirit asActivity A, have your agency design a tour that includes the seven most spectacular\nsights of any kind on all the moons or rings covered in this chapter. What are the not-to-be-missed\ndestinations that future tourists will want to visit and why? Which of the sights you pick are going to be\nspectacular if you are on the moon\u2019s surface or inside the ring, and which would look interesting only\nfrom far away in space?\nC. In this chapter we could cover only a few of the dozens of moons in the outer solar system. Using the\nInternet or your college library, organize your group into a research team and find out more about one of\nthe moons we did not cover in detail. Our favorites include Uranus\u2019 Miranda, with its jigsaw puzzle surface;\nSaturn\u2019s Mimas, with a \u201cknockout\u201d crater called Herschel; and Saturn\u2019s Iapetus, whose two hemispheres\ndiffer significantly. Prepare a report to attract tourists to the world you selected.\nD. In a novel entitled2010, science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, inspired by the information coming back\nfrom the Voyager spacecraft, had fun proposing a life form under the ice of Europa that was evolving\ntoward intelligence. Suppose future missions do indeed find some sort of life (not necessarily intelligent\nbut definitely alive) under the ice of Europa\u2014life that evolved completely independently from life on Earth.\nHave your group discuss what effect such a discovery would have on humanity\u2019s view of itself. What\nshould be our attitude toward such a life form? Do we have an obligation to guard it against\ncontamination by our microbes and viruses? Or, to take an extreme position, should we wipe it out before\nit becomes competitive with Earth life or contaminates our explorers with microorganisms we are not\nprepared to deal with? Who should be in charge of making such decisions?\nE. In the same spirit asActivity D, your group may want to watch the 2013 science fiction filmEuropa Report.\nThe producers tried to include good science in depicting what it would be like for astronauts to visit that\njovian moon. How well does your group think they did?\nF. A number of modern science fiction writers (especially those with training in science) have written short\nstories that take place on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. There is a topical listing of science fiction\nstories with good astronomy at http://bit.ly/astroscifi. Members of your group can look under \u201cJupiter\u201d or\n\u201cSaturn\u201d and find a story that interests you and then report on it to the whole class.\nG. Work together to make a list of all the reasons it is hard to send a mission to Pluto. What compromises\nhad to be made so that the New Horizons mission was affordable? How would you design a second\nmission to learn more about the Pluto system?\nAccess for free at openstax.org 12 \u2022 Exercises 419\nH. Your group has been asked by NASA to come up with one or more missions to learn about Europa. Review\nwhat we know about this moon so far and then design a robotic mission that would answer some of the\nquestions we have. You can assume that budget is not a factor, but your instruments have to be realistic.\n(Bear in mind that Europa is cold and far from the Sun.)\nI. Imagine your group is the first landing party on Pluto (let\u2019s hope you remembered to bring long\nunderwear!). You land in a place where Charon is visible in the sky and you observe Charon for one Earth\nweek. Describe what Charon will look like during that week. Now you move your camp to the opposite\nhemisphere of Pluto. What will Charon look like there during the course of a week?\nJ. When, in 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) decided that Pluto should be called a dwarf\nplanet and not a planet, they set up three criteria that a world must meet to be called a planet. Your group\nshould use the Internet to find these criteria. Which of them did Pluto not meet? Read a little bit about the\nreaction to the IAU\u2019s decision among astronomers and the public. How do members of your group feel\nabout Pluto\u2019s new classification?

Would you expect to find more impact craters on Io or Callisto? Why?\n17. Why is it unlikely that humans will be traveling to Io? (Hint: Review the information about Jupiter\u2019s\nmagnetosphere inThe Giant Planets.)\n18. Why do you suppose the rings of Saturn are made of bright particles, whereas the particles in the rings of\nUranus and Neptune are black?\n19. Suppose you miraculously removed all of Saturn\u2019s moons. What would happen to its rings?\n20. We have a lot of good images of the large moons of Jupiter and Saturn from the Galileo and Cassini\nspacecraft missions (check out NASA\u2019s Planetary Photojournal site, at http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov, to\nsee the variety). Now that the New Horizons mission has gone to Pluto, why don\u2019t we have as many good\nimages of all sides of Pluto and Charon?\n21. In the Star Wars movieStar Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, a key battle takes place on the inhabited\n\u201cforest moon\u201d Endor, which supposedly orbits around a gas giant planet.

What could we do if we knew a few years in\nadvance that one of these bodies would hit Earth?\nTo understand the early history of life on Earth, scientists study ancient fossils. To reconstruct the early history\nof the solar system, we need cosmic fossils\u2014materials that formed when our system was very young.\nHowever, reconstructing the early history of the solar system by looking just at the planets is almost as difficult\nas determining the circumstances of human birth by merely looking at an adult.\nInstead, we turn to the surviving remnants of the creation process\u2014ancient but smaller objects in our cosmic\nneighborhood. Asteroids are rocky or metallic and contain littlevolatile(easily evaporated) material.

Asteroids are too small to be seen without a telescope; the first of them was not\ndiscovered until the beginning of the nineteenth century.\nDiscovery and Orbits of the Asteroids\nIn the late 1700s, many astronomers were hunting for an additional planet they thought should exist in the\ngap between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The Sicilian astronomer GiovanniPiazzithought he had found this\nmissing planet in 1801, when he discovered the first asteroid (or as it was later called, \u201cminor planet\u201d) orbiting\nat 2.8 AU from the Sun. His discovery, which he named Ceres, was quickly followed by the detection of three\nother little planets in similar orbits.\nClearly, there was not a single missing planet between Mars and Jupiter but rather a whole group of objects,\neach much smaller than our Moon. (An analogous discovery history has played out in slow motion in the outer\nsolar system. Pluto was discovered beyond Neptune in 1930 and was initially called a planet, but early in the\ntwenty-first century, several other similar objects were found. We now call all of them dwarf planets.)\nBy 1890, more than 300 of these minor planets orasteroidshad been discovered by sharp-eyed observers. In\nthat year, MaxWolfat Heidelberg introduced astronomical photography to the search for asteroids, greatly\naccelerating the discovery of these dim objects. In the twenty-first century, searchers use computer-driven\nelectronic cameras, another leap in technology. Currently many asteroid searches are made with cameras in\nspace. More than a million asteroids now have well-determined orbits.\nAsteroids are given a number (corresponding to the order of discovery) and sometimes also a name.\nOriginally, the names of asteroids were chosen from goddesses in Greek and Roman mythology. After\nexhausting these and other female names (including, later, those of spouses, friends, flowers, cities, and\nothers), astronomers turned to the names of colleagues (and other people of distinction) whom they wished\nto honor. For example, asteroids 2410, 4859, and 68448 are named Morrison, Fraknoi, and Sidneywolff, for the\nthree senior authors of this textbook.\nThe largest asteroid isCeres(numbered 1), with a diameter just less than 1000 kilometers. As we saw, Ceres\nwas considered a planet when it was discovered but later was called an asteroid (the first of many.) Now, it has\nagain been reclassified and is considered one of the dwarf planets, like Pluto (see the chapter onMoons, Rings\nand Pluto). We still find it convenient, however, to discuss Ceres as the largest of the asteroids. Two other\nasteroids,PallasandVesta, have diameters of about 500 kilometers, and about 15 more are larger than 250\nkilometers (seeTable 13.1). The number of asteroids increases rapidly with decreasing size; there are about\n100 times more objects 10 kilometers across than there are 100 kilometers across.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTheMinor Planet Center(https://openstax.org/l/30minplancen)is a worldwide repository of data on\nasteroids.

The majority of asteroids are in theasteroid belt, the region\nbetween Mars and Jupiter that contains all asteroids with orbital periods between 3.3 to 6 years (Figure 13.2).\nAlthough more than 75% of the known asteroids are in the belt, they are not closely spaced (as they are\nsometimes depicted in science fiction movies). The volume of the belt is actually very large, and the typical\nspacing between objects (down to 1 kilometer in size) is several million kilometers. (This was fortunate for\nspacecraft like Galileo, Cassini,Rosetta, and New Horizons, which needed to travel through the asteroid belt\nwithout a collision.) 424 13 \u2022 Comets and Asteroids: Debris of the Solar System\nFigure13.2Asteroids in the Solar System.This computer-generated diagram shows the positions of theasteroidsknown in 2006. If\nthe asteroid sizes were drawn to scale, none of the dots representing an asteroid would be visible. Here, the asteroid dots are too big\nand give a false impression of how crowded the asteroid belt would look if you were in it. Note that in addition to those in the\nasteroid belt, there are also asteroids in the inner solar system and some along Jupiter\u2019s orbit (such as the Trojans and Greeks\ngroups), controlled by the giant planet\u2019s gravity.\nStill, over the long history of our solar system, there have been a good number of collisions among the\nasteroids themselves. In 1918, the Japanese astronomer Kiyotsugu Hirayama found that some asteroids fall\nintofamilies, groups with similar orbital characteristics. He hypothesized that each family may have resulted\nfrom the breakup of a larger body or, more likely, from the collision of two asteroids. Slight differences in the\nspeeds with which the various fragments left the collision scene account for the small spread in orbits now\nobserved for the different asteroids in a given family. Several dozen such families exist, and observations have\nshown that individual members of most families have similar compositions, as we would expect if they were\nfragments of a common parent.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nYou can see adramatic animated video(https://openstax.org/l/30anividastorb)showing the orbits of\n100,000 asteroids found by one sky survey. As the 3-minute video goes on, you get to see the orbits of the\nplanets and how the asteroids are distributed in the solar system. But note that all such videos are\nmisleading in one sense. The asteroids themselves are really small compared to the distances covered, so\nthey have to be depicted as larger points to be visible. If you were in the asteroid belt, there would be far\nmore empty space than asteroids.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13.1 \u2022 Asteroids 425\nComposition and Classification\nAsteroids are as different as black and white. The majority are very dark, with reflectivity of only 3 to 4%, like a\nlump of coal. However, another large group has a typical reflectivity of 15%. To understand more about these\ndifferences and how they are related to chemical composition, astronomers study the spectrum of the light\nreflected fromasteroidsfor clues about their composition.\nThe dark asteroids are revealed from spectral studies to beprimitivebodies (those that have changed little\nchemically since the beginning of the solar system) composed of silicates mixed with dark, organic carbon\ncompounds. These are known asC-type asteroids(\u201cC\u201d for carbonaceous). Two of the largest asteroids,Ceres\nand Pallas, are primitive, as are almost all of the asteroids in the outer part of the belt. In 2020 and 2021, two of\nthese C-type asteroids, Bennu and Ryugu, were visited by spacecraft that briefly touched their surfaces.\nThe second most populous group is theS-type asteroids, where \u201cS\u201d stands for a stony or silicate composition.\nHere, the dark carbon compounds are missing, resulting in higher reflectivity and clearer spectral signatures\nof silicate minerals. The S-type asteroids are also chemically primitive, but their different composition indicates\nthat they were probably formed in a different location in the solar system from the C-type asteroids.\nAsteroids of a third class, much less numerous than those of the first two, are composed primarily of metal\nand are calledM-type asteroids(\u201cM\u201d for metallic). Spectroscopically, the identification of metal is difficult, but\nfor at least the largest M-type asteroid, Psyche, this identification has been confirmed by radar. Since a metal\nasteroid, like an airplane or ship, is a much better reflector of radar than is a stony object, Psyche appears\nbright when we aim a radar beam at it. In 2022, a NASA mission, conveniently named Psyche, will be launched\ntoward this asteroid.\nHow did such metal asteroids come to be? We suspect that each came from a parent body large enough for its\nmolten interior to settle out or differentiate, and the heavier metals sank to the center. When this parent body\nshattered in a later collision, the fragments from the core were rich in metals. There is enough metal in even a\n1-kilometer M-type asteroid to supply the world with iron and many other industrial metals for the foreseeable\nfuture, if we could bring one safely to Earth.\nIn addition to the M-type asteroids, a few other asteroids show signs of early heating and differentiation.\nThese have basaltic surfaces like the volcanic plains of the Moon and Mars; the large asteroid Vesta (discussed\nin a moment) is in this last category.\nThe different classes of asteroids are found at different distances from the Sun (Figure 13.3). By tracing how\nasteroid compositions vary with distance from the Sun, we can reconstruct some of the properties of the solar\nnebula from which they originally formed.\nFigure13.3Where Different Types of Asteroids Are Found.Asteroids of different composition are distributed at different 426 13 \u2022 Comets and Asteroids: Debris of the Solar System\ndistances from the Sun. The S-type and C-type are both primitive; the M-type consists of cores of differentiated parent bodies.\nVesta: A Differentiated Asteroid\nVestais one of the most interesting of the asteroids. It orbits the Sun with a semi-major axis of 2.4 AU in the\ninner part of the asteroid belt. Its relatively high reflectivity of almost 30% makes it the brightest asteroid, so\nbright that it is actually visible to the unaided eye if you know just where to look. But its real claim to fame is\nthat its surface is covered with basalt, indicating that Vesta is a differentiated object that must once have been\nvolcanically active, in spite of its small size (about 500 kilometers in diameter).\nMeteorites from Vesta\u2019s surface (Figure 13.4), identified by comparing their spectra with that of Vesta itself,\nhave landed on Earth and are available for direct study in the laboratory. We thus know a great deal about this\nasteroid. The age of the lava flows from which these meteorites derived has been measured at 4.4 to 4.5 billion\nyears, very soon after the formation of the solar system. This age is consistent with what we might expect for\nvolcanoes on Vesta; whatever process heated such a small object was probably intense and short-lived. In\n2016, a meteorite fell in Turkey that could be identified with a particular lava flow as revealed by the orbiting\nDawnspacecraft.\nFigure13.4Piece of Vesta.This meteorite (rock that fell from space) has been identified as a volcanic fragment from the crust of\nasteroidVesta.

Kempton (New England Meteoritical Services))\nAsteroids Up Close\nOn the way to its 1995 encounter with Jupiter, the Galileo spacecraft was targeted to fly close to two main-belt\nS-type asteroids calledGaspraandIda. The Galileo camera revealed both as long and highly irregular\n(resembling a battered potato), as befits fragments from a catastrophic collision (Figure 13.5).\nFigure13.5Mathilde, Gaspra, and Ida.The first three asteroids photographed from spacecraft flybys, printed to the same scale.\nGaspra and Ida are S-type and were investigated by the Galileo spacecraft; Mathilde is C-type and was a flyby target for the NEAR-\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13.1 \u2022 Asteroids 427\nShoemaker spacecraft. (credit: modification of work by NEAR Project, Galileo Project, NASA)\nThe detailed images allowed us to count the craters on Gaspra and Ida, and to estimate the length of time\ntheir surfaces have been exposed to collisions. The Galileo scientists concluded that these asteroids are only\nabout 200 million years old (that is, the collisions that formed them took place about 200 million years ago).\nCalculations suggest that an asteroid the size of Gaspra or Ida can expect another catastrophic collision\nsometime in the next billion years, at which time it will be disrupted to form another generation of still-smaller\nfragments.\nThe greatest surprise of the Galileo flyby of Ida was the discovery of a moon (which was then namedDactyl), in\norbit about the asteroid (Figure 13.6). Although only 1.5 kilometers in diameter, smaller than many college\ncampuses, Dactyl provides scientists with something otherwise beyond their reach\u2014a measurement of the\nmass and density of Ida using Kepler\u2019s laws. The moon\u2019s distance of about 100 kilometers and its orbital\nperiod of about 24 hours indicate that Ida has a density of approximately 2.5 g/cm3, which matches the density\nof primitive rocks. Subsequently, both large visible-light telescopes and high-powered planetary radar have\ndiscovered many other asteroid moons, so that we are now able to accumulate valuable data on asteroid\nmasses and densities.\nFigure13.6Ida and Dactyl.The asteroidIdaand its tiny moonDactyl(the small body off to its right), were photographed by the\nGalileo spacecraft in 1993. Irregularly shaped Ida is 56 kilometers in its longest dimension, while Dactyl is about 1.5 kilometers\nacross. The colors have been intensified in this image; to the eye, all asteroids look basically gray. (credit: modification of work by\nNASA/JPL)\nBy the way,PhobosandDeimos, the two small moons of Mars, are probably captured asteroids (Figure 13.7).\nThey were first studied at close range by the Viking orbiters in 1977 and later byMars Global Surveyor. Both\nare irregular, somewhat elongated, and heavily created, resembling other smaller asteroids. Their largest\ndimensions are about 26 kilometers and 16 kilometers, respectively. The small outer moons of Jupiter and\nSaturn were probably also captured from passing asteroids, perhaps early in the history of the solar system. 428 13 \u2022 Comets and Asteroids: Debris of the Solar System\nFigure13.7Moons of Mars.The two small moons ofMars, (a)Phobosand (b)Deimos, were discovered in 1877 by American\nastronomer Asaph Hall. Their surface materials are similar to many of the asteroids in the outer asteroid belt, leading astronomers\nto believe that the two moons may be captured asteroids. (credit a: modification of work by NASA; credit b: modification of work by\nNASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona)\nBeginning in the 1990s, spacecraft have provided close looks at several more asteroids. The Near Earth\nAsteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft went into orbit around the S-type asteroid Eros, becoming a\ntemporary moon of this asteroid. On its way to Eros, theNEARspacecraft was renamed after planetary\ngeologist Eugene Shoemaker, a pioneer in our understanding of craters and impacts.\nFor a year, the NEAR-Shoemaker spacecraft orbited the little asteroid at various altitudes, measuring its\nsurface and interior composition as well as mapping Eros from all sides (Figure 13.8). The data showed that\nEros is made of some of the most chemically primitive materials in the solar system. Several other asteroids\nhave been revealed as made of loosely bound rubble throughout, but not Eros. Its uniform density (about the\nsame as that of Earth\u2019s crust) and extensive global-scale grooves and ridges show that it is a cracked but solid\nrock.\nFigure13.8Looking Down on the North Pole of Eros.This view was constructed from six images of the asteroid taken from an\naltitude of 200 kilometers. The large crater at the top has been named Psyche (after the maiden who was Eros\u2019 lover in classical\nmythology) and is about 5.3 kilometers wide. A saddle-shaped region can be seen directly below it. Craters of many different sizes\nare visible. (credit: modification of work by NASA/JHUPL)\nEroshas a good deal of loose surface material that appears to have slid down toward lower elevations. In\nsome places, the surface rubble layer is 100 meters deep. The top of loose soil is dotted with scattered, half-\nburied boulders. There are so many of these boulders that they are more numerous than the craters. Of\ncourse, with the gravity so low on this small world, a visiting astronaut would find loose boulders rolling\ntoward her pretty slowly and could easily leap high enough to avoid being hit by one. Although the NEAR-\nShoemaker spacecraft was not constructed as a lander, at the end of its orbital mission in 2000, it was allowed\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13.1 \u2022 Asteroids 429\nto fall gently to the surface, where it continued its chemical analysis for another week.\nIn 2003, Japan\u2019s Hayabusa 1 mission not only visited a small asteroid but also brought back samples to study in\nlaboratories on Earth. The target S-type asteroid,Itokawa(shown inFigure 13.9), is much smaller than Eros,\nonly about 500 meters long. This asteroid is elongated and appears to be the result of the collision of two\nseparate asteroids long ago. There are almost no impact craters, but an abundance of boulders (like a pile of\nrubble) on the surface.\nFigure13.9Asteroid Itokawa.The surface of asteroid Itokawa appears to have no craters. Astronomers have hypothesized that its\nsurface consists of rocks and ice chunks held together by a small amount of gravity, and its interior is probably also a similar rubble\npile. (credit: JAXA)\nTheHayabusaspacecraft was designed not to land, but to touch the surface just long enough to collect a small\nsample. This tricky maneuver failed on its first try, with the spacecraft briefly toppling over on its side.\nEventually, the controllers were successful in picking up a few grains of surface material and transferring them\ninto the return capsule (Figure 13.10). We estimate that the dust grainsHayabusapicked up had been exposed\non the surface of the asteroid for about 8 million years.\nFigure13.10Examining an Asteroid Up Close.(a) Near-Earth Asteroid Bennu, imaged by the Osiris-Rex Spacecraft in 2020. Bennu\nis a small (half-km diameter), rapidly spinning dark asteroid. Its low density suggests it is a loosely-bound rubble pile. The surface is\nvery rough, with protruding rocks and boulders. (b) Preparing to collect a sample, the collection arm is shown just before touch-\ndown on Bennu. For scale, the diameter of the sampling device is 30 cm. The sample of about 100 grams of surface rocks and dust\nwill be returned to Earth in 2023. a: modification of work by NASA Goddard/University of Arizona; credit b: modification of work by\nNASA Goddard/University of Arizona\nFollowing on the success of Hayabusa, both NASA and the Japanese space agency, JAXA, sent more advanced 430 13 \u2022 Comets and Asteroids: Debris of the Solar System\nasteroid sample-return missions. Both targeted small Earth-approaching asteroids, only about 1 km in\ndiameter. Each target is a dark object, apparently a rubble pile formed relatively recently after being broken\napart in a collision. Hayabusa-2 visited the asteroid Ryugu, collected a small sample, and successfully returned\nit to Earth in December 2020. The U.S. mission called OSIRIS-REx visited Bennu, an asteroid that actually has a\nsmall chance of colliding with Earth in the next century. Its sample will be returned to Earth in September 2023.\nThe most ambitious asteroid space mission (called Dawn) has visited the two largest main belt asteroids, Ceres\nand Vesta, orbiting each for about a year (Figure 13.11). Their large sizes (diameters of about 1000 and 500\nkilometers, respectively) make them appropriate for comparison with the planets and large moons. Both\nturned out to be heavily cratered, implying their surfaces are old. On Vesta, we have now actually located the\nlarge impact craters that ejected the basaltic meteorites previously identified as coming from this asteroid.\nThese craters are so large that they sample several layers of Vesta\u2019s crustal material.\nFigure13.11Vesta and Ceres.The NASADawnspacecraft took these images of the large asteroids (a)Vestaand (b)Ceres. (a) Note\nthat Vesta is not round, as Ceres (which is considered a dwarf planet) is. A mountain twice the height of Mt. Everest on Earth is visible\nat the very bottom of the Vesta image. (b) The image of Ceres has its colors exaggerated to bring out differences in composition. You\ncan see a white feature in Occator crater near the center of the image. (credit a, b: modification of work by NASA/JPL-Caltech/UCLA/\nMPS/DLR/IDA)\nCeres has not had a comparable history of giant impacts, so its surface is covered with craters that look more\nlike those from the lunar highlands. One big surprise at Ceres is the presence of very bright white spots,\nassociated primarily with the central peaks of large craters (Figure 13.12). The light-colored mineral is primarily\nsalt, released from the interior. After repeated close flybys, data from the NASA Dawn spacecraft indicated that\nCeres has (or has had) a subsurface ocean of water, with occasional eruptions on the surface. The most\ndramatic is the 4 kilometer tall ice volcano called Ahuna Mons (seeFigure 13.12).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13.1 \u2022 Asteroids 431\nFigure13.12White Spots in a Larger Crater on Ceres.White Spots in a Larger Crater on Ceres.

This visitor was found at a\ndistance of 33 million kilometers with a survey telescope on Haleakala, Hawaii. As astronomers followed up on\nthe discovery, it quickly became apparent that this asteroid was travelling far too fast to be part of the Sun\u2019s\nfamily. Its orbit is a hyperbola, and when discovered it was already rapidly leaving the inner solar system.\nAlthough it was too distant for imaging by even large telescopes, its size and shape could be estimated from\nits brightness and rapid light fluctuations. It is highly elongated, with an approximately cylindrical shape. The\nnominal dimensions are about 200 meters in length and only 35 meters across, the most extreme of any\nnatural object. Large objects, like planets and moons, are pulled by their own gravity into roughly spherical\nshapes, and even small asteroids and comets (often described as \u201cpotato-shaped\u201d) rarely have irregularities of\nmore than a factor of two.\nThis asteroid was named \u2018Oumuamua, a Hawaiian word meaning \u201cscout\u201d or \u201cfirst to reach out.\u201d In a way, the\ndiscovery of an interstellar asteroid or comet was not unexpected. Early in solar system history, before the\nplanet orbits sorted themselves into stable, non-intersecting paths all in the same plane, we estimate that\nquite a lot of mass was ejected, either whole planets or more numerous smaller fragments. Even today, an\noccasional comet coming in from the outer edges of the solar system can have its orbit changed by\ngravitational interaction with Jupiter and the Sun, and some of these escape on hyperbolic trajectories. In 2019,\nastronomers discovered an interstellar comet entering our solar system\u2014more on this in the section on\ncomets. As we have recently learned that planetary systems are common, the question became: where are\nsimilar debris objects ejected from other planetary systems? Now we have found two, and improved surveys\nwill soon add others to this category.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView an artist\u2019s rendering of the asteroid \u2018Oumuamua(https://www.openstax.org/l/30oumuamua)\n(https://www.openstax.org/l/30oumuamua)by the ESO.

In this section, we consider some special groups of asteroids\nwith orbits that approach or cross the orbit of Earth. These pose the risk of a catastrophic collision with our\nplanet, such as the collision 65 million years ago that killed the dinosaurs.\nEarth-Approaching Asteroids\nAsteroids that stray faroutsidethe main belt are of interest mostly to astronomers. But asteroids that come\ninward, especially those with orbits that come close to or cross the orbit of Earth, are of interest to political\nleaders, military planners\u2014indeed, everyone alive on Earth. Some of these asteroids briefly become the closest\ncelestial object to us.\nIn 1994, a 1-kilometer object was picked up passing closer than the Moon, causing a stir of interest in the news\nmedia. Today, it is routine to read of small asteroids coming this close to Earth. (They were always there, but\nonly in recent years have astronomers been able to detect such faint objects.)\nIn 2013, a small asteroid hit our planet, streaking across the sky over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk and\nexploding with the energy of a nuclear bomb (Figure 13.13). The impactor was a stony object about 20 meters\nin diameter, exploding about 30 kilometers high with an energy of 500 kilotons (about 30 times larger than the\nnuclear bombs dropped on Japan in World War II). No one was hurt by the blast itself, although it briefly\nbecame as bright as the Sun, drawing many spectators to the windows in their offices and homes. When the\nblast wave from the explosion then reached the town, it blew out the windows. About 1500 people had to seek\nmedical attention from injuries from the shattered glass.\nA much larger atmospheric explosion took place in Russia in 1908, caused by an asteroid about 60 meters in\ndiameter, releasing an energy of 10 megatons, as large the most powerful nuclear weapons of today.\nFortunately, the area directly affected, on the Tunguska River in Siberia, was unpopulated, and no one was\nkilled. However, the area of forest destroyed by the blast was large equal to the size of a major city (Figure\n13.13).\nTogether with any comets that come close to our planet, such asteroids are known collectively asnear-Earth\nobjects (NEOs). As we will see (and as the dinosaurs found out 65 million years ago,) the collision of a\nsignificant-sized NEO could be a catastrophe for life on our planet.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13.2 \u2022 Asteroids and Planetary Defense 433\nFigure13.13Impacts with Earth.(a) As the Chelyabinsk meteor passed through the atmosphere, it left a trail of smoke and briefly\nbecame as bright as the Sun.

In 1998, NASA began the Spaceguard Survey, with the goal to discover\nand track 90% ofEarth-approaching asteroidsgreater than 1 kilometer in diameter. The size of 1 kilometer was\nselected to include all asteroids capable of causing global damage, not merely local or regional effects. At 1\nkilometer or larger, the impact could blast so much dust into the atmosphere that the sunlight would be\ndimmed for months, causing global crop failures\u2014an event that could threaten the survival of our civilization.\nThe Spaceguard goal of 90% was reached in 2012 when nearly a thousand of these 1-kilometernear-Earth\nasteroids (NEAs)had been found, along with more than 10,000 smaller asteroids.Figure 13.14shows how the\npace of NEA discoveries has been increasing over recent years. By 2021, astronomers knew of more than\n25,000. 434 13 \u2022 Comets and Asteroids: Debris of the Solar System\nFigure13.14Discovery of Near-Earth Asteroids.The accelerating rate of discovery of NEAs is illustrated in this graph, which shows\nthe total number of known NEAs, the number over 140 meters in diameter, and the number over 1 kilometer in diameter, the size\nthat poses the dominant impact risk on Earth.\nHow did astronomers know when they had discovered 90% of the larger asteroids? There are several ways to\nestimate the total number, even before they were individually located. One way is to look at the numbers of\nlarge craters on the dark lunar maria. Remember that these craters were made by impacts just like the ones\nwe are considering. They are preserved on the Moon\u2019s airless surface, whereas Earth soon erases the imprints\nof past impacts. Thus, the number of large craters on the Moon allows us to estimate how often impacts have\noccurred on both the Moon and Earth over the past several billion years. The number of impacts is directly\nrelated to the number of asteroids and comets on Earth-crossing orbits.\nAnother approach is to see how often the surveys (which are automated searches for faint points of light that\nmove among the stars) rediscover a previously known asteroid. At the beginning of a survey, all the NEAs it\nfinds will be new. But as the survey becomes more complete, more and more of the moving points the survey\ncameras record will berediscoveries.The more rediscoveries each survey experiences, the more complete our\ninventory of these asteroids must be.\nWe have been relieved to find that none of the NEAs discovered so far is on a trajectory that will impact Earth\nwithin the foreseeable future. However, we can\u2019t speak for the handful of asteroids larger than 1 kilometer\nthat have not yet been found, or for the much more numerous smaller ones. It is estimated that there are a\nmillion NEAs capable of hitting Earth that are smaller than 1 kilometer but still large enough to destroy a city,\nand our surveys have found about 25% of them. Researchers who work with asteroid orbits estimate that for\nsmaller (and therefore fainter) asteroids we are not yet tracking, we will have about a 5-second warning that\none is going to hit Earth\u2014in other words, we won\u2019t see it until it enters the atmosphere. Clearly, this estimate\ngives us a lot of motivation to continue these surveys to track as many asteroids as possible.\nThough entirely predictable over times of a few centuries, the orbits ofEarth-approaching asteroidsare\nunstable over long time spans as they are tugged by the gravitational attractions of the planets. These objects\nwill eventually meet one of two fates: either they will impact one of the terrestrial planets or the Sun, or they\nwill be ejected gravitationally from the inner solar system due to a near-encounter with a planet. The\nprobabilities of these two outcomes are about the same. The timescale for impact or ejection is only about a\nhundred million years, very short compared with the 4-billion-year age of the solar system. Calculations show\nthat only approximately one quarter of the current Earth-approaching asteroids will eventually end up\ncolliding with Earth itself.\nIf most of the current population ofEarth-approaching asteroidswill be removed by impact or ejection in a\nhundred million years, there must be a continuing source of new objects to replenish our supply of NEAs. Most\nof them come from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, where collisions between asteroids can eject\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13.2 \u2022 Asteroids and Planetary Defense 435\nfragments into Earth-crossing orbits (seeFigure 13.15). Others may be \u201cdead\u201d comets that have exhausted\ntheir volatile materials (which we\u2019ll discuss in the next section).\nFigure13.15Near-Earth Asteroid.Toutatis is a 5-kilometer long NEA that approached within 3 million kilometers of Earth in 1992.\nThis series of images is a reconstruction its size and shape obtained from bouncing radar waves off the asteroid during its close\nflyby. Toutatis appears to consist of two irregular, lumpy bodies rotating in contact with each other. (Note that the color has been\nartificially added.) (credit: modification of work by NASA)\nOne reason scientists are interested in the composition and interior structure of NEAs is that humans will\nprobably need to defend themselves against an asteroid impact someday. If we ever found one of these\nasteroids on a collision course with us, we would need to deflect it so it would miss Earth. The most\nstraightforward way to deflect it would be to crash a spacecraft into it, either slowing it or speeding it up,\nslightly changing its orbital period. If this were done several years before the predicted collision, the asteroid\nwould miss the planet entirely\u2014making an asteroid impact the only natural hazard that we could eliminate\ncompletely by the application of technology. Alternatively, such deflection could be done by exploding a\nnuclear bomb near the asteroid to nudge it off course, although the use of nuclear explosives in space raises\nother concerns.\nTo achieve a successful deflection by either technique, we need to know more about the density and interior\nstructure of the asteroid. A spacecraft impact or a nearby explosion would have a greater effect on a solid\nrocky asteroid such as Eros than on a loose rubble pile. Think of climbing a sand dune compared to climbing a\nrocky hill with the same slope. On the dune, much of our energy is absorbed in the slipping sand, so the climb\nis much more difficult and takes more energy.\nThe NASA Planetary Protection Office, which provides international guidance on these issues, has sponsored\nthe first space mission to test asteroid deflection technology. The DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) was\nlaunched in November 2021 from the Vandenberg spaceport in California, now coincidentally operated by the\nmilitary U.S. Space Force. Eleven months later, the 500-kg spacecraft will impact at a speed of about 6 km/s\ninto Dimorphos, the 160 m diameter moon of asteroid Didymos. This will occur at a time in 2022 when the two\nobjects are relatively close to Earth. The objective is to measure the momentum transferred to the target\nasteroid by using telescopes on Earth to track the change in the orbital period of Dimorphos. This mission will\ntest both our technology to hit such a small object and the efficiency of the change in its orbit around\nDidymos. Note that the asteroid orbit is such that there is no possibility that the impact will lead to a later\ncollision with Earth.\nThere is increasing international interest in the problem of asteroid impacts. The United Nations has formed\ntwo technical committees on planetary defense, recognizing that the entire planet is at risk from asteroid\nimpacts. However, the fundamental problem remains one of finding NEAs in time for defensive measures to\nbe taken. We must be able to find the next impactor before it finds us. And that\u2019s a job for the astronomers. 436 13 \u2022 Comets and Asteroids: Debris of the Solar System\n13.3 The \u201cLong-Haired\u201d Comets\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nCharacterize the general physical appearance of comets\nExplain the range of cometary orbits\nDescribe the size and composition of a typical comet\u2019s nucleus\nDiscuss the atmospheres of comets\nSummarize the discoveries of the Rosetta mission\nComets differ from asteroids primarily in their icy composition, a difference that causes them to brighten\ndramatically as they approach the Sun, forming a temporary atmosphere. In some early cultures, these so-\ncalled \u201chairy stars\u201d were considered omens of disaster. Today, we no longer fear comets, but eagerly\nanticipate those that come close enough to us to put on a good sky show.\nAppearance of Comets\nAcometis a relatively small chunk of icy material (typically a few kilometers across) that develops an\natmosphere as it approaches the Sun. Later, there may be a very faint, nebuloustail, extending several million\nkilometers away from the main body of the comet. Comets have been observed from the earliest times:\naccounts of comets are found in the histories of virtually all ancient civilizations. The typical comet, however, is\nnot spectacular in our skies, instead having the appearance of a rather faint, diffuse spot of light somewhat\nsmaller than the Moon and many times less brilliant. (Comets seemed more spectacular to people before the\ninvention of artificial lighting, which compromises our view of the night sky.)\nLike the Moon and planets, comets appear to wander among the stars, slowly shifting their positions in the sky\nfrom night to night. Unlike the planets, however, most comets appear at unpredictable times, which perhaps\nexplain why they frequently inspired fear and superstition in earlier times. Comets typically remain visible for\nperiods that vary from a couple of weeks to several months. We\u2019ll say more about what they are made of and\nhow they become visible after we discuss their motions.\nNote that still images of comets give the impression that they are moving rapidly across the sky, like a bright\nmeteor or shooting star. Looking only at such images, it is easy to confuse comets and meteors. But seen in\nthe real sky, they are very different: the meteor burns up in our atmosphere and is gone in a few seconds,\nwhereas the comet may be visible for weeks in nearly the same part of the sky.\nComet Orbits\nThe study of comets as members of the solar system dates from the time of Isaac Newton, who first suggested\nthat they orbited the Sun on extremely elongated ellipses. Newton\u2019s colleague EdmundHalley(see the\nEdmund Halley: Astronomy\u2019s Renaissance Manfeature box) developed these ideas, and in 1705, he published\ncalculations of 24 comet orbits. In particular, he noted that the orbits of the bright comets that had appeared\nin the years 1531, 1607, and 1682 were so similar that the three could well be the same comet, returning to\nperihelion (closest approach to the Sun) at average intervals of 76 years. If so, he predicted that the object\nshould next return about 1758. Although Halley had died by the time the comet appeared as he predicted, it\nwas given the nameComet Halley(rhymes with \u201cvalley\u201d) in honor of the astronomer who first recognized it as\na permanent member of our solar system, orbiting around the Sun. Its aphelion (furthest point from the Sun)\nis beyond the orbit of Neptune.\nWe now know from historical records that Comet Halley has actually been observed and recorded on every\npassage near the Sun since 239 BCE at intervals ranging from 74 to 79 years. The period of its return varies\nsomewhat because of orbital changes produced by the pull of the giant planets. In 1910, Earth was brushed by\nthe comet\u2019s tail, causing much needless public concern. Comet Halley last appeared in our skies in 1986\n(Figure 13.16), when it was met by several spacecraft that gave us a wealth of information about its makeup; it\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13.3 \u2022 The \u201cLong-Haired\u201d Comets 437\nwill return in 2061.\nFigure13.16Comet Halley.This composite of three images (one in red, one in green, one in blue) showsComet Halleyas seen with\na large telescope in Chile in 1986. During the time the three images were taken in sequence, the comet moved among the stars. The\ntelescope was moved to keep the image of the comet steady, causing the stars to appear in triplicate (once in each color) in the\nbackground. (credit: modification of work by ESO)\nVOYAGERS IN ASTRONOMY\nEdmund Halley: Astronomy\u2019s Renaissance Man\nEdmundHalley(Figure 13.17), a brilliant astronomer who made contributions in many fields of science and\nstatistics, was by all accounts a generous, warm, and outgoing person. In this, he was quite the opposite of\nhis good friend IsaacNewton, whose great work, thePrincipia(seeOrbits and Gravity), Halley encouraged,\nedited, and helped pay to publish. Halley himself published his first scientific paper at age 20, while still in\ncollege. As a result, he was given a royal commission to go to Saint Helena (a remote island off the coast of\nAfrica where Napoleon would later be exiled) to make the first telescopic survey of the southern sky. After\nreturning, he received the equivalent of a master\u2019s degree and was elected to the prestigious Royal Society\nin England, all at the age of 22.\nIn addition to his work on comets, Halley was the first astronomer to recognize that the so-called \u201cfixed\u201d\nstars move relative to each other, by noting that several bright stars had changed their positions since\nPtolemy\u2019s publication of the ancient Greek catalogs. He wrote a paper on the possibility of an infinite\nuniverse, proposed that some stars may be variable, and discussed the nature and size ofnebulae(glowing\ncloudlike structures visible in telescopes). While in Saint Helena, Halley observed the planet Mercury going\nacross the face of the Sun and developed the mathematics of how such transits could be used to establish\nthe size of the solar system. 438 13 \u2022 Comets and Asteroids: Debris of the Solar System\nIn other fields, Halley published the first table of human life expectancies (the precursor of life-insurance\nstatistics); wrote papers on monsoons, trade winds, and tides (charting the tides in the English Channel for\nthe first time); laid the foundations for the systematic study of Earth\u2019s magnetic field; studied evaporation\nand how inland waters become salty; and even designed an underwater diving bell. He served as a British\ndiplomat, advising the emperor of Austria and squiring the future czar of Russia around England (avidly\ndiscussing, we are told, both the importance of science and the quality of local brandy).\nIn 1703, Halley became a professor of geometry at Oxford, and in 1720, he was appointed Astronomer Royal\nof England. He continued observing Earth and the sky and publishing his ideas for another 20 years, until\ndeath claimed him at age 85.\nFigure13.17Edmund Halley (1656\u20131742).Halley was a prolific contributor to the sciences. His study of comets at the turn of the\neighteenth century helped predict the orbit of the comet that now bears his name.\nOnly a few comets return in a time measureable in human terms (shorter than a century or two), likeComet\nHalleydoes; these are calledshort-periodcomets. Many short-period comets have had their orbits changed by\ncoming too close to one of the giant planets\u2014most often Jupiter (and they are thus sometimes called Jupiter-\nfamily comets). Most comets have long periods and will take thousands of years to return, if they return at all.\nAs we will see later in this chapter, most Jupiter-family comets come from a different source than thelong-\nperiodcomets (those with orbital periods longer than about a century).\nObservational records exist for thousands ofcomets. We were visited by two bright comets in recent decades.\nFirst, in March 1996, came Comet Hyakutake, with a very long tail. A year later,Comet Hale-Boppappeared; it\nwas as bright as the brightest stars and remained visible for several weeks, even in urban areas (see the image\nthat opens this chapter,Figure 13.1) Since then, there have been few comets visible to the naked eye, and\nastronomers (both professional and amateur) eagerly await such a visitor.\nTable 13.2lists some well-known comets whose history or appearance is of special interest.\nSome Interesting Comets\nName Period Significance\nTycho Brahe showed it was beyond the Moon (a big step in our\nGreat Comet of 1577 Long\nunderstanding)\nTable13.2\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13.3 \u2022 The \u201cLong-Haired\u201d Comets 439\nName Period Significance\nGreat Comet of 1843 Long Brightest recorded comet; visible in daytime\nDaylight Comet of\nLong Brightest comet of the twentieth century\n1910\nWest Long Nucleus broke into pieces (1976)\nHyakutake Long Passed within 15 million km of Earth (1996)\nHale\u2013Bopp Long Brightest recent comet (1997)\nSwift-Tuttle 133years Parent comet of Perseid meteor shower\nHalley 76years First comet found to be periodic; explored by spacecraft in 1986\nBorrelly 6.8years Flyby by Deep Space 1 spacecraft (2000)\nBiela 6.7years Broke up in 1846 and not seen again\nChuryumov-\n6.5years Target of Rosetta mission (2014\u201316)\nGerasimenko\nWild 2 6.4years Target of Stardust sample return mission (2004)\nTempel 1 5.7years Target of Deep Impact mission (2005)\nEncke 3.3years Shortest known period\nTable13.2\nThe Comet\u2019s Nucleus\nWhen we look at an active comet, all we normally see is its temporary atmosphere of gas and dust illuminated\nby sunlight. This atmosphere is called the comet\u2019s head orcoma.Since the gravity of such small bodies is very\nweak, the atmosphere is rapidly escaping all the time; it must be replenished by new material, which has to\ncome from somewhere. The source is the small, solidnucleusinside, just a few kilometers across, usually\nhidden by the glow from the much-larger atmosphere surrounding it. The nucleus is the real comet, the\nfragment of ancient icy material responsible for the atmosphere and the tail (Figure 13.18). 440 13 \u2022 Comets and Asteroids: Debris of the Solar System\nFigure13.18Parts of a Comet.This schematic illustration shows the main parts of a comet. Note that the different structures are\nnot to scale.\nThe modern theory of the physical and chemical nature ofcometswas first proposed by Harvard astronomer\nFredWhipplein 1950. Before Whipple\u2019s work, many astronomers thought that a comet\u2019s nucleus might be a\nloose aggregation of solids, sort of an orbiting \u201cgravel bank,\u201d Whipple proposed instead that the nucleus is a\nsolid object a few kilometers across, composed in substantial part of water ice (but with other ices as well)\nmixed with silicate grains and dust. This proposal became known as the \u201cdirty snowball\u201d model.\nThe water vapor and other volatiles that escape from the nucleus when it is heated can be detected in the\ncomet\u2019s head and tail, and therefore, we can use spectra to analyze what atoms and molecules the nucleus ice\nconsists of. However, we are somewhat less certain of the non-icy component. We have never identified a\nfragment of solid matter from a comet that has survived passage through Earth\u2019s atmosphere. However,\nspacecraft that have approached comets have carried dust detectors, and somecomet dusthas even been\nreturned to Earth (seeFigure 13.19). It seems that much of the \u201cdirt\u201d in the dirty snowball is dark, primitive\nhydrocarbons and silicates, rather like the material thought to be present on the dark, primitive asteroids.\nFigure13.19Captured Comet Dust.This particle (seen through a microscope) is believed to be a tiny fragment of cometary dust,\ncollected in the upper atmosphere of Earth. It measures about 10 microns, or 1/100 of a millimeter, across. (credit: NASA/JPL)\nSince the nuclei of comets are small and dark, they are difficult to study from Earth. Spacecraft did obtain\ndirect measurements of a comet nucleus, however, in 1986, when three spacecraft swept past Comet Halley at\nclose range (seeFigure 13.20). Subsequently, other spacecraft have flown close to other comets. In 2005, the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13.3 \u2022 The \u201cLong-Haired\u201d Comets 441\nNASADeep Impactspacecraft even carried a probe for a high-speed impact with the nucleus of Comet Tempel\n1. But by far, the most productive study of a comet has been by the 2015 Rosetta mission, which we will discuss\nshortly.\nFigure13.20Close-up of Comet Halley.This historic photograph of the black, irregularly shaped nucleus ofComet Halleywas\nobtained by the ESAGiottospacecraft from a distance of about 1000 kilometers. The bright areas are jets of material escaping from\nthe surface. The length of the nucleus is 10 kilometers, and details as small as 1 kilometer can be made out. (credit: modification of\nwork by ESA)\nThe Comet\u2019s Atmosphere\nThe spectacular activity that allows us to see comets is caused by the evaporation of cometary ices heated by\nsunlight. Beyond the asteroid belt, wherecometsspend most of their time, these ices are solidly frozen. But as\na comet approaches the Sun, it begins to warm up. If water (H O) is the dominant ice, significant quantities\n2\nvaporize as sunlight heats the surface above 200 K. This happens for the typical comet somewhat beyond the\norbit of Mars. The evaporating H O in turn releases the dust that was mixed with the ice. Since the comet\u2019s\n2\nnucleus is so small, its gravity cannot hold back either the gas or the dust, both of which flow away into space\nat speeds of about 1 kilometer per second.\nThe comet continues to absorb energy as it approaches the Sun. A great deal of this energy goes into the\nevaporation of its ice, as well as into heating the surface. However, recent observations of many comets\nindicate that the evaporation is not uniform and that most of the gas is released in sudden spurts, perhaps\nconfined to a few areas of the surface. Expanding into space at a speed of about 1 kilometer per second, the\ncomet\u2019s atmosphere can reach an enormous size. The diameter of a comet\u2019s head is often as large as Jupiter,\nand it can sometimes approach a diameter of a million kilometers (Figure 13.21).\nFigure13.21Head of Comet Halley.Here we see the cloud of gas and dust that make up the head, or coma, ofComet Halleyin\n1986. On this scale, the nucleus (hidden inside the cloud) would be a dot too small to see. (credit: modification of work by NASA/W.\nLiller)\nMost comets also develop tails as they approach the Sun. A comet\u2019s tail is an extension of its atmosphere,\nconsisting of the same gas and dust that make up its head. As early as the sixteenth century, observers\nrealized that comet tails always point away from the Sun (Figure 13.22), not back along the comet\u2019s orbit.\nNewton proposed that comet tails are formed by a repulsive force of sunlight driving particles away from the 442 13 \u2022 Comets and Asteroids: Debris of the Solar System\nhead\u2014an idea close to our modern view.\nFigure13.22Comet Orbit and Tail.The orientation of a typical comet tail changes as the comet passes perihelion. Approaching the\nSun, the tail is behind the incoming comet head, but on the way out, the tail precedes the head.\nThe two different components that make up the tail (the dust and gas) act somewhat differently. The brightest\npart of the tail is called thedust tail, to differentiate it from a fainter, straight tail made of ionized gas, called\nthe ion tail. The ion tail is carried outward by streams of ions (charged particles) emitted by the Sun. As you\ncan see inFigure 13.23, the smoother dust tail curves a bit, as individual dust particles spread out along the\ncomet\u2019s orbit, whereas the straight ion tail is pushed more directly outward from the Sun by our star\u2019s wind of\ncharged particles\nFigure13.23Comet Tails.(a) As a comet nears the Sun, its features become more visible. In this illustration from NASA showing\nComet Hale-Bopp, you can see a comet\u2019s two tails: the more easily visible dust tail, which can be up to 10 million kilometers long, and\nthe fainter gas tail (or ion tail), which is up to hundreds of millions of kilometers long. The grains that make up the dust tail are the\nsize of smoke particles. (b) Comet Mrkos was photographed in 1957 with a wide-field telescope at Palomar Observatory and also\nshows a clear distinction between the straight gas tail and the curving dust tail.

Abell, and Byron Hill)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThese days, comets close to the Sun can be found with spacecraft designed to observe our star. For\nexample, in early July, 2011, astronomers at the ESA/NASA\u2019s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13.3 \u2022 The \u201cLong-Haired\u201d Comets 443\nwitnessed acomet(https://openstax.org/l/30ESANASAcomet)streaking toward the Sun, one of almost 3000\nsuch sightings. You can also watch a brief video by NASA entitled \u201cWhy Are We Seeing So Many Sungrazing\nComets?\u201d\nThe Rosetta Comet Mission\nThe 1976 Giotto flyby of Comet Halley, which gave us the first picture of an active comet nucleus, was a\nwatershed in our understanding of comets. In the 1990s, European scientists decided to design a much more\nambitious mission that would match orbits with an incoming comet and follow it as it approached the Sun.\nThey also proposed that a smaller spacecraft would actually try to land on the comet. The 2-ton main\nspacecraft was namedRosetta, carrying a dozen scientific instruments, and its 100-kilogram lander with nine\nmore instruments was namedPhilae.\nThe Rosetta mission was launched in 2004. Delays with the launch rocket caused it to miss its original target\ncomet, so an alternate destination was picked,Comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko(named after the two\ndiscoverers, but generally denoted 67P). This comet\u2019s period of revolution is 6.45 years, making it a Jupiter-\nfamily comet.\nSince the European Space Agency did not have access to the plutonium-fueled nuclear power sources used by\nNASA for deep space missions,Rosettahad to be solar powered, requiring especially large solar panels. Even\nthese were not enough to keep the craft operating as it matched orbits with 67P near the comet\u2019s aphelion.\nThe only solution was to turn off all the spacecraft systems and let it coast for several years toward the Sun,\nout of contact with controllers on Earth until solar energy was stronger. The success of the mission depended\non an automatic timer to turn the power back on as it neared the Sun. Fortunately, this strategy worked.\nIn August 2014,Rosettabegan a gradual approach to the comet nucleus, which is a strangely misshapen\nobject about 5 kilometers across, quite different from the smooth appearance of Halley\u2019s nucleus (but equally\ndark). Its rotation period is 12 hours. On November 12, 2014, thePhilaelander was dropped, descending\nslowly for 7 hours before gently hitting the surface. It bounced and rolled, coming to rest under an overhang\nwhere there was not enough sunlight to keep its batteries charged. After operating for a few hours and\nsending data back to the orbiter,Philaewent silent. The mainRosettaspacecraft continued operations,\nhowever, as the level of comet activity increased, with steamers of gas jetting from the surface. As the comet\napproached perihelion in September 2015, the spacecraft backed off to ensure its safety.\nThe extent of theRosettaimages (and data from other instruments) far exceeds anything astronomers had\nseen before from a comet. The best imaging resolution was nearly a factor of 100 greater than in the best\nHalley images. At this scale, the comet appears surprisingly rough, with sharp angles, deep pits, and\noverhangs (Figure 13.24). 444 13 \u2022 Comets and Asteroids: Debris of the Solar System\nFigure13.24Comet 67P\u2019s Strange Shape and Surface Features.(a) This image from theRosettacamera was taken from a distance\nof 285 kilometers.

(credit a: modification of work by ESA/Rosetta/MPS for OSIRIS Team MPS/UPD/\nLAM/IAA/SSO/INTA/UPM/DASP/IDA; credit b: modification of work by ESA/Rosetta/Philae/CIVA)\nThe double-lobed shape of 67P\u2019s nucleus has been tentatively attributed to the collision and merger of two\nindependent comet nuclei long ago. The spacecraft verified that the comet\u2019s dark surface was covered with\norganic carbon-rich compounds, mixed with sulfides and iron-nickel grains. 67P has an average density of only\n0.5 g/cm3(recall water in these units has a density of 1 g/cm3.) This low density indicates that the comet is\nquite porous, that is, there is a large amount of empty space among its materials.\nWe already knew that the evaporation of comet ices was sporadic and limited to small jets, but in comet 67P,\nthis was carried to an extreme. At any one time, more than 99% of the surface is inactive. The active vents are\nonly a few meters across, with the material confined to narrow jets that persist for just a few minutes (Figure\n13.25). The level of activity is strongly dependent on solar heating, and between July and August 2015, it\nincreased by a factor of 10. Isotopic analysis of deuterium in the water ejected by the comet shows that it is\ndifferent from the water found on Earth. Thus, apparently comets like 67P did not contribute to the origin of\nour oceans or the water in our bodies, as some scientists had thought.\nFigure13.25Gas Jets on Comet 67P.\"(a and b) Jet activity was photographed by theRosettaspacecraft near perihelion.

The first of these objects is\nChiron, found in 1977 on a path that carries it from just inside the orbit of Saturn at its closest approach to the\nSun out to almost the distance of Uranus (Figure 13.26). The diameter of Chiron is estimated to be about 200\nkilometers, much larger than any known comet.\nFigure13.26Chiron\u2019s Orbit.Chiron orbits the Sun every 50 years, with its closest approach being inside the orbit of Saturn and its\nfarthest approach out to the orbit of Uranus. 446 13 \u2022 Comets and Asteroids: Debris of the Solar System\nIn 1992, a still-more-distant object named Pholus was discovered with an orbit that takes it 33 AU from the\nSun, beyond the orbit of Neptune. Pholus has the reddest surface of any object in the solar system, indicating\na strange (and still unknown) surface composition. As more objects are discovered in these distant reaches,\nastronomers decided that they will be given the names ofcentaursfrom classical mythology; this is because\nthecentaurswere half human, half horse, and these new objects display some of the properties of both\nasteroids and comets.\nBeyond the orbit of Neptune lies a cold, dark realm populated by objects called simply trans-Neptunian objects\n(TNOs). The first discovered, and best known, of these TNOs is the dwarf planetPluto. We discussed Pluto and\nthe New Horizons spacecraft encounter with it inRings, Moons, and Pluto. The second TNO was discovered in\n1992, and now more than a thousand are known, most of them smaller than Pluto. In late 2018, a team of\nastronomers announced the discovery of the most distant TNO found so far, orbiting at 120 Astronomical\nUnits, or 3 \u00bd times the distance of Pluto; they nicknamed it \u201cfarout.\u201d\nThe largest ones after Pluto\u2014namedEris,Makemake, andHaumea\u2014are also classed as dwarf planets. Except\nfor their small size, dwarf planets have many properties in common with the larger planets. Pluto has five\nmoons, and two moons have been discovered orbiting Haumea and one each circling Eris and Makemake.\nThe Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud\nTNOs are a part of what is called theKuiper belt, a large area of space beyondNeptunethat is also the source\nof many comets. Astronomers study the Kuiper belt in two ways. New, more powerful telescopes allow us to\ndiscover many of the larger members of the Kuiper belt directly. We can also measure the composition of\nshort-period comets that are thought to originate in the Kuiper belt, where small gravitational perturbations\nfrom Neptune can gradually shift their orbits until they can penetrate the inner solar system. More than a\nthousand Kuiper belt objects have been discovered, and astronomers estimate that there are more than\n100,000 with diameters larger than 100 kilometers, in a disk extending out to about 50 AU from the Sun.\nFollowing its successful flyby of Pluto, the New Horizons spacecraft explored the Kuiper Belt. The team\neventually identified a member of the belt, 2014 MU16 (subsequently named Arrokoth), that could be reached\nby a slight change in the spacecraft trajectory. New Horizons flew past Arrokoth on January 1, 2019, at a\ndistance of only 3,500 km, obtaining images and other data. The target turned out to be a contact binary,\nsomething new and unexpected (see photo).\nBy following their orbits backward, we can calculate that theaphelia(points farthest from the Sun) of newly\ndiscovered comets typically have values near 50,000 AU (more than a thousand times farther than Pluto). This\nclustering of aphelion distances was first noted by Dutch astronomer JanOort, who, in 1950, proposed an idea\nfor the origin of those comets that is still accepted today (Figure 13.27).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13.4 \u2022 The Origin and Fate of Comets and Related Objects 447\nFigure13.27Jan Oort (1900\u20131992).(a) Jan Oort first suggested that there might be a reservoir of frozen chunks, potential comet\nnuclei, at the edge of the region of the Sun\u2019s gravitational influence. (b) The first color image of the Kuiper Belt Object named\nArrokoth, taken at a distance of 137,000 kilometers from the New Horizons spacecraft on January 1, 2019. (credit (a): This image is\ncopyright by the Leiden Observatory; credit (b): NASA/JHU/SWRI)\nIt is possible to calculate that a star\u2019s gravitationalsphereofinfluence\u2014the distance within which it can exert\nsufficient gravitation to hold onto orbiting objects\u2014is about one third of its distance to the nearest other stars.\nStars in the vicinity of the Sun are spaced in such a way that the Sun\u2019s sphere of influence extends a little\nbeyond 50,000 AU, or about 1 light-year. At such great distances, however, objects in orbit about the Sun can\nbe perturbed by the gravity of passing stars. Some of the perturbed objects can then take on orbits that bring\nthem much closer to the Sun (while others might be lost to the solar system forever).\nOort suggested, therefore, that the new comets we were seeing were examples of objects orbiting the Sun\nnear the edge of its sphere of influence, whose orbits had been disturbed by nearby stars, eventually bringing\n1\nthem close to the Sun where we can see them. The reservoir of ancient icy objects from which such comets\nare derived is now called theOort cloud.\nAstronomers estimate that there are about a trillion (1012) comets in the Oort cloud. In addition, we estimate\nthat about 10 times this number of icy objects could be orbiting the Sun in the volume of space between the\nKuiper belt (which is gravitationally linked to Neptune) and the Oort cloud. These objects remain undiscovered\nbecause they are too faint to be seen directly and their orbits are too stable to permit any of them to be\ndeflected inward close to the Sun. The total number of icy or cometary objects in the outer reaches of our solar\nsystem could thus be on the order of 10 trillion (1013), a very large number indeed.\nWhat is the mass represented by 1013comets? We can make an estimate if we assume something about comet\nsizes and masses. Let us suppose that the nucleus of Comet Halley is typical. Its observed volume is about 600\nkm3. If the primary constituent is water ice with a density of about 1 g/cm3, then the total mass of Halley\u2019s\nnucleus must be about 6 \u00d7 1014kilograms. This is about one ten billionth (10\u201310) of the mass of Earth.\nIf our estimate is reasonable and there are 1013comets with this mass out there, their total mass would be\nequal to about 1000 Earths\u2014comparable to the mass of all the planets put together. Therefore, icy, cometary\nmaterial could be the most important constituent of the solar system after the Sun itself.\n1 We now know that not every comet we see originates in the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud. In 2017 and 2019, astronomers discovered\ntwo \u201cinterstellar comets,\u201d (named 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov) whose orbits indicated that they came from outside the solar\nsystem! (Oumoumua means scout or messenger in Hawaiian.) 448 13 \u2022 Comets and Asteroids: Debris of the Solar System\nEXAMPLE 13.1\nMass of the Oort Cloud Comets\nSuppose the Oort cloud contains 1012comets with an average diameter of 10 km each. Let\u2019s estimate the\nmass of the total Oort cloud.\nSolution\nWe can start by assuming that typical comets are about the size of Comets Halley and Borrelly, with a\ndiameter of 10 km and a density appropriate to water ice, which is about 1 g/cm3or 1000 kg/m3. We know\nthat density = mass/volume, the volume of a sphere, and the radius, Therefore, for\neach comet,\nGiven that 10 km = 104m, each comet\u2019s mass is\nTo calculate the total mass of the cloud, we multiply this typical mass for one comet by the number of\ncomets:\nCheck Your Learning\nHow does the total mass we calculated above compare to the mass of Jupiter? To the mass of the Sun?\n(Give a numerical answer.)\nAnswer:\nThe mass of Jupiter is about 1.9 \u00d7 1027kg. The mass of the Oort cloud calculated above is 1027kg. So the\ncloud would contain about half a Jupiter of mass. The mass of the Sun is 2 \u00d7 1030kg. This means the Oort\ncloud would be\nEarly Evolution of the Planetary System\nComets from the Oort cloud help us sample material that formed very far from the Sun, whereas the short-\nperiod comets from the Kuiper belt sample materials that were planetesimals in the solar nebula disk but did\nnot form planets. Studies of the Kuiper belt also are influencing our understanding of the early evolution of\nour planetary system.\nThe objects in the Oort cloud and the Kuiper belt have different histories, and they may therefore have\ndifferent compositions. Astronomers are therefore very interested in comparing detailed measurements of the\ncomets derived from these two source regions. Most of the bright comets that have been studied in the past\n(such as Hyakutake and Hale-Bopp) are Oort cloud comets, but P67 and several other comets targeted for\nspacecraft measurements in the next decade areJupiter-family comets from the Kuiper belt (seeTable 13.2).\nTheKuiper beltis made up of ice-and-rock planetesimals, a remnant of the building blocks of the planets.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13.4 \u2022 The Origin and Fate of Comets and Related Objects 449\nSince it is gravitationally linked to Neptune, it can help us understand the formation and history of the solar\nsystem. As the giant planets formed, their gravity profoundly influenced the orbits of Kuiper belt objects.\nComputer simulations of the early evolution of the planetary system suggest that the gravitational interactions\nbetween the giant planets and the remaining planetesimals caused the orbit of Jupiter to drift inward, whereas\nthe orbits of Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune all expanded, carrying the Kuiper belt with them.\nAnother hypotheses involves a fifth giant planet that was expelled from the solar system entirely as the\nplanetary orbits shifted. Neptune\u2019s retrograde (backward-orbiting) moonTriton(which is nearly as large as\nPluto) may have been a Kuiper belt object captured by Neptune during the period of shifting orbits. It clearly\nseems that the Kuiper belt may carry important clues to the way our solar system reached its present\nplanetary configuration.\nMAKING CONNECTIONS\nComet Hunting as a Hobby\nWhen amateur astronomer DavidLevy(Figure 13.28), the co-discoverer ofComet Shoemaker-Levy 9, found\nhis first comet, he had already spent 928 fruitless hours searching through the dark night sky. But the\ndiscovery of the first comet only whetted his appetite. Since then, he has found 8 others on his own and 13\nmore working with others. Despite this impressive record, he ranks only third in the record books for\nnumber of comet discoveries. But David hopes to break the record someday.\nAll around the world, dedicated amateur observers spend countless nights scanning the sky for new\ncomets. Astronomy is one of the very few fields of science where amateurs can still make a meaningful\ncontribution, and the discovery of a comet is one of the most exciting ways they can establish their place in\nastronomical history. Don Machholz, a California amateur (and comet hunter) who has been making a\nstudy of comet discoveries, reported that between 1975 and 1995, 38% of all comets discovered were found\nby amateurs. Those 20 years yielded 67 comets for amateurs, or almost 4 per year. That might sound pretty\nencouraging to new comet hunters, until they learn that the average number of hours the typical amateur\nspent searching for a comet before finding one was about 420. Clearly, this is not an activity for impatient\npersonalities.\nWhat do comet hunters do if they think they have found a new comet? First, they must check the object\u2019s\nlocation in an atlas of the sky to make sure it really is a comet. Since the first sighting of a comet usually\noccurs when it is still far from the Sun and before it sports a significant tail, it will look like only a small, fuzzy\npatch. And through most amateur telescopes, so will nebulae (clouds of cosmic gas and dust) and galaxies\n(distant groupings of stars). Next, they must check that they have not come across a comet that is already\nknown, in which case, they will only get a pat on the back instead of fame and glory. Then they must re-\nobserve or re-image it sometime later to see whether its motion in the sky is appropriate for comets.\nOften, comet hunters who think they have made a discovery get another comet hunter elsewhere in the\ncountry to confirm it. If everything checks out, the place they contact is the Central Bureau for Astronomical\nTelegrams at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts\n(http://www.cbat.eps.harvard.edu/). If the discovery is confirmed, the bureau will send the news out to\nastronomers and observatories around the world. One of the unique rewards of comet hunting is that the\ndiscoverer\u2019s name becomes associated with the new comet\u2014a bit of cosmic fame that few hobbies can\nmatch. 450 13 \u2022 Comets and Asteroids: Debris of the Solar System\nFigure13.28David Levy.Amateur astronomer David Levy ranks third in the world for comet discoveries. (credit: Andrew\nFraknoi)\nThe Fate of Comets\nAny comet we see today will have spent nearly its entire existence in the Oort cloud or the Kuiper belt at a\ntemperature near absolute zero. But once a comet enters the inner solar system, its previously uneventful life\nhistory begins to accelerate. It may, of course, survive its initial passage near the Sun and return to the cold\nreaches of space where it spent the previous 4.5 billion years. At the other extreme, it may collide with the Sun\nor come so close that it is destroyed on its first perihelion passage (several such collisions have been observed\nwith space telescopes that monitor the Sun). Sometimes, however, the new comet does not come that close to\nthe Sun but instead interacts with one or more of the planets.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nSOHO (the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) has anexcellent collection of videos of comets\n(https://openstax.org/l/30SOHOcomvid)that come near the Sun. At this site, comet ISON approaches the\nSun and is believed to be destroyed in its passage.\nA comet that comes within the gravitational influence of a planet has three possible fates. It can (1) impact the\nplanet, ending the story at once; (2) speed up and be ejected, leaving the solar system forever; or (3) be\nperturbed into an orbit with a shorter period. In the last case, its fate is sealed. Each time it approaches the\nSun, it loses part of its material and also has a significant chance of collision with a planet. Once the comet is in\nthis kind of short-period orbit, its lifetime starts being measured in thousands, not billions, of years.\nA few comets end their lives catastrophically by breaking apart (sometimes for no apparent reason) (Figure\n13.29). Especially spectacular was the fate of the faintComet Shoemaker-Levy 9, which broke into about 20\npieces when it passed close toJupiterin July 1992. The fragments of Shoemaker-Levy were actually captured\ninto a very elongated, two-year orbit around Jupiter, more than doubling the number of known jovian moons.\nThis was only a temporary enrichment of Jupiter\u2019s family, however, because in July 1994, all the comet\nfragments crashed unto Jupiter, releasing energy equivalent to millions of megatons of TNT.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13.4 \u2022 The Origin and Fate of Comets and Related Objects 451\nFigure13.29Breakup of Comet LINEAR.(a) A ground-based view with much less detail and (b) a much more detailed photo with\nthe Hubble Space Telescope, showing the multiple fragments of the nucleus ofComet LINEAR.

These fireballs were clearly visible in profile, with the actual point of impact just beyond the\njovian horizon as viewed from Earth (Figure 13.30). As each explosive plume fell back into Jupiter, a region of\nthe upper atmosphere larger than Earth was heated to incandescence and glowed brilliantly for about 15\nminutes, a glow we could detect with infrared-sensitive telescopes.\nFigure13.30Comet Impact on Jupiter.(a) The \u201cstring\u201d of white objects are fragments ofComet Shoemaker-Levy 9approaching\nJupiter. (b) The first fragment of the comet impacts Jupiter, with the point of contact on the bottom left side in this image. On the\nright is Jupiter\u2019s moon, Io. The equally bright spot in the top image is the comet fragment flaring to maximum brightness. The\nbottom image, taken about 20 minutes later, shows the lingering flare from the impact. The Great Red Spot is visible near the center\nof Jupiter. These infrared images were taken with a German-Spanish telescope on Calar Alto in southern Spain.

Millions of\npeople all over the world peered at Jupiter through telescopes or followed the event via television or online.\nAnother, smaller, impact feature was seen on Jupiter in summer 2009 (and six more since), indicating that the\n1994 events were by no means unique. Seeing these large, impact explosions on Jupiter helps us to appreciate\nthe disaster that would happen to our planet if we were hit by a comet or asteroid.\nFigure13.31Impact Dust Cloud on Jupiter.These features result from the impact ofComet Shoemaker-Levy 9withJupiter, seen\nwith the Hubble Space Telescope 105 minutes after the impact that produced the dark rings (the compact back dot came from\nanother fragment). The inner edge of the diffuse, outer ring is about the same size as Earth. Later, the winds on Jupiter blended\nthese features into a broad spot that remained visible for more than a month. (credit: modification of work by H. Hammel, MIT, and\nNASA/ESA)\nFor comets that do not meet so dramatic an end, measurements of the amount of gas and dust in their\natmospheres permit us to estimate the total losses during one orbit. Typical loss rates are up to a million tons\nper day from an active comet near the Sun, adding up to some tens of millions of tons per orbit. At that rate, a\ntypical comet will be gone after a few thousand orbits. This will probably be the fate ofComet Halleyin the\nlong run.\nEarlier we mentioned that comets can also escape the solar system. In 2019, astronomers discovered comet\n2I/Borisov, which came from a planetary system other than ours. It is only the second interstellar object we\nhave found, and the first that is rich in volatile materials such as water and carbon compounds. The presence\nof an atmosphere allowed its composition to be studied. Borisov contains much more carbon monoxide than\nnormal solar system comets, which tells us that it was probably formed in a cooler location, perhaps around a\nred dwarf star.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this 4-minute NASA retrospective on the collision of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with JupiterHistory\nChannel video(https://openstax.org/l/30shoemaker)to learn more.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13 \u2022 Key Terms 453\nKey Terms\nasteroid a stony or metallic object orbiting the Sun that is smaller than a planet but that shows no evidence\nof an atmosphere or of other types of activity associated with comets\nasteroid belt the region of the solar system between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter in which most asteroids\nare located; the main belt, where the orbits are generally the most stable, extends from 2.2 to 3.3 AU from\nthe Sun\ncomet a small body of icy and dusty matter that revolves about the Sun; when a comet comes near the Sun,\nsome of its material vaporizes, forming a large head of tenuous gas and often a tail\nKuiper belt a region of space beyond Neptune that is dynamically stable (like the asteroid belt); the source\nregion for most short-period comets\nnear-Earth asteroid (NEA) an Earth-approaching asteroid, one whose orbit could bring it on a collision\ncourse with our planet\nnear-Earth object (NEO) a comet or asteroid whose path intersects the orbit of Earth\nnucleus (of a comet) the solid chunk of ice and dust in the head of a comet\nOort cloud the large spherical region around the Sun from which most \u201cnew\u201d comets come; a reservoir of\nobjects with aphelia at about 50,000 AU\ntail (of a comet) a tail consisting of two parts: the dust tail is made of dust loosened by the sublimation of ice\nin a comet that is then pushed by photons from the Sun into a curved stream; the ion tail is a stream of\nionized particles evaporated from a comet and then swept away from the Sun by the solar wind\nSummary\n13.1Asteroids\nThe solar system includes many objects that are much smaller than the planets and their larger moons. The\nrocky ones are generally called asteroids. Ceres is the largest asteroid; about 15 are larger than 250 kilometers\nand about 100,000 are larger than 1 kilometer. Most are in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The\npresence of asteroid families in the belt indicates that many asteroids are the remnants of ancient collisions\nand fragmentation. The asteroids include both primitive and differentiated objects. Most asteroids are classed\nas C-type, meaning they are composed of carbonaceous materials. Dominating the inner belt are S-type\n(stony) asteroids, with a few M-type (metallic) ones. We have spacecraft images of several asteroids and\nreturned samples from three asteroids. Recent observations have detected a number of asteroid moons,\nmaking it possible to measure the masses and densities of the asteroids they orbit. The two largest asteroids,\nCeres and Vesta, have been extensively studied from orbit by theDawnspacecraft.\n13.2Asteroids and Planetary Defense\nNear-Earth asteroids (NEAs), and near-Earth objects (NEOs) in general, are of interest in part because of their\npotential to hit Earth. They are on unstable orbits, and on timescales of 100 million years, they will either\nimpact one of the terrestrial planets or the Sun, or be ejected. Most of them probably come from the asteroid\nbelt, but some may be dead comets. NASA\u2019s Spaceguard Survey has found 90% of the NEAs larger than 1\nkilometer, and none of the ones found so far are on a collision course with Earth. Scientists are actively\nworking on possible technologies for planetary defense in case any NEOs are found on a collision course with\nEarth years in advance. For now, the most important task is to continue our surveys, so we can find the next\nEarth impactor before it finds us.\n13.3The \u201cLong-Haired\u201d Comets\nHalley first showed that some comets are on closed orbits and return periodically to swing around the Sun.\nThe heart of a comet is its nucleus, a few kilometers in diameter and composed of volatiles (primarily frozen\nH O) and solids (including both silicates and carbonaceous materials). Whipple first suggested this \u201cdirty\n2\nsnowball\u201d model in 1950; it has been confirmed by spacecraft studies of several comets. As the nucleus 454 13 \u2022 For Further Exploration\napproaches the Sun, its volatiles evaporate (perhaps in localized jets or explosions) to form the comet\u2019s head\nor atmosphere, which escapes at about 1 kilometer per second. The atmosphere streams away from the Sun\nto form a long tail. The ESA Rosetta mission to Comet P67 (Churyumov-Gerasimenko) has greatly increased\nour knowledge of the nature of the nucleus and of the process by which comets release water and other\nvolatiles when heated by sunlight.\n13.4The Origin and Fate of Comets and Related Objects\nOort proposed in 1950 that long-period comets are derived from what we now call the Oort cloud, which\nsurrounds the Sun out to about 50,000 AU (near the limit of the Sun\u2019s gravitational sphere of influence) and\ncontains between 1012and 1013comets. Comets also come from the Kuiper belt, a disk-shaped region beyond\nthe orbit of Neptune, extending to 50 AU from the Sun. Comets are primitive bodies left over from the\nformation of the outer solar system. Once a comet is diverted into the inner solar system, it typically survives\nno more than a few thousand perihelion passages before losing all its volatiles. Some comets die spectacular\ndeaths: Shoemaker-Levy 9, for example, broke into 20 pieces before colliding with Jupiter in 1994.\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nAsteroids\nAsphang, E. \u201cThe Small Planets.\u201dScientific American(May 2000): 46.

Your group is a congressional committee charged with evaluating the funding for an effort to find all the\nNEAs (near-Earth asteroids) that are larger than 0.5 kilometers across. Make a list of reasons it would be\nuseful to humanity to find such objects. What should we (could we) do if we found one that will hit Earth in\na few years?\nB. Many cultures considered comets bad omens. Legends associate comets with the deaths of kings, losses\nin war, or ends of dynasties. Did any members of your group ever hear about such folktales? Discuss\nreasons why comets in earlier times may have gotten this bad reputation.\nC. Because asteroids have a variety of compositions and a low gravity that makes the removal of materials\nquite easy, some people have suggested that mining asteroids may be a way to get needed resources in\nthe future. Make a list of materials in asteroids (and comets that come to the inner solar system) that may\nbe valuable to a space-faring civilization. What are the pros and cons of undertaking mining operations on\nthese small worlds?\nD. As discussed in the feature box onComet Hunting as a Hobby, amateur comet hunters typically spend\nmore than 400 hours scanning the skies with their telescopes to find a comet. That\u2019s a lot of time to spend\n(usually alone, usually far from city lights, usually in the cold, and always in the dark). Discuss with\nmembers of your group whether you can see yourself being this dedicated. Why do people undertake\nsuch quests? Do you envy their dedication?\nE. The largest Kuiper belt objects known are also called dwarf planets. All the planets (terrestrial, jovian, and\ndwarf) in our solar system have so far been named after mythological gods. (The dwarf planet names\nhave moved away from Roman mythology to include the gods of other cultures.) Have your group discuss\nwhether we should continue this naming tradition with newly discovered dwarf planets. Why or why not?\nF. The total cost of the Rosetta mission to match courses with a comet was about 1.4 billion Euros (about\n$1.6 billion US). Have your group discuss whether this investment was worth it, giving reasons for\nwhichever side you choose. (On the European Space Agency website, they put this cost in context by\nsaying, \u201cThe figure is barely half the price of a modern submarine, or three Airbus 380 jumbo jets, and\ncovers a period of almost 20 years, from the start of the project in 1996 through the end of the mission in\n2015.\u201d)\nG. If an Earth-approaching asteroid were discovered early enough, humanity could take measures to prevent\nAccess for free at openstax.org 13 \u2022 Exercises 457\na collision. Discuss possible methods for deflecting or even destroying an asteroid or comet. Go beyond\nthe few methods mentioned in the text and use your creativity.

Give brief descriptions of both the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud.\nThought Questions\n15. Give at least two reasons today\u2019s astronomers are so interested in the discovery of additional Earth-\napproaching asteroids.\n16. Suppose you were designing a spacecraft that would match course with an asteroid and follow along its\norbit. What sorts of instruments would you put on board to gather data, and what would you like to learn?\n17. Suppose you were designing a spacecraft that would match course with a comet and move with it for a\nwhile. What sorts of instruments would you put on board to gather data, and what would you like to\nlearn?\n18. Suppose a comet were discovered approaching the Sun, one whose orbit would cause it to collide with\nEarth 20 months later, after perihelion passage. (This is approximately the situation described in the\nscience-fiction novelLucifer\u2019s Hammerby Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle.) What could we do? Would\nthere be any way to protect ourselves from a catastrophe?\n19. We believe that chains of comet fragments like Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9\u2019s have collided not only with the\njovian planets, but occasionally with their moons. What sort of features would you look for on the outer\nplanet moons to find evidence of such collisions? (As an extra bonus, can you find any images of such\nfeatures on a moon like Callisto? You can use an online site of planetary images, such as thePlanetary\nPhotojournal, at photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov.) 458 13 \u2022 Exercises\n20. Why have we found so many objects in the Kuiper belt in the last two decades and not before then?\n21. Why is it hard to give exact diameters for even the larger objects in the Kuiper belt?\nFiguring for Yourself\n22. Refer toExample 13.1. How would the calculation change if a typical comet in the Oort cloud is only 1 km\nin diameter?\n23. Refer toExample 13.1. How would the calculation change if a typical comet in the Oort cloud is\nlarger\u2014say, 50 km in diameter?\n24. The calculation inExample 13.1refers to the known Oort cloud, the source for most of the comets we see.\nIf, as some astronomers suspect, there are 10 times this many cometary objects in the solar system, how\ndoes the total mass of cometary matter compare with the mass of Jupiter?\n25. If the Oort cloud contains 1012comets, and ten new comets are discovered coming close to the Sun each\nyear, what percentage of the comets have been \u201cused up\u201d since the beginning of the solar system?\n26. The mass of the asteroids is found mostly in the larger asteroids, so to estimate the total mass we need to\nconsider only the larger objects. Suppose the three largest asteroids\u2014Ceres (1000 km in diameter), Pallas\n(500 km in diameter), and Vesta (500 km in diameter)\u2014account for half the total mass. Assume that each\nof these three asteroids has a density of 3 \u00d7 103g/cm3and calculate their total mass. Multiply your result\nby 2 to obtain an estimate for the mass of the total asteroid belt. How does this compare with the mass of\nthe Oort cloud?\n27. Make a similar estimate for the mass of the Kuiper belt. The three largest objects are Pluto, Eris, and\nMakemake (each roughly 2000 km). In addition, assume there are eight objects (including Haumea, Orcus,\nQuaoar, Ixion, Varuna, and Charon, and objects that have not been named yet) with diameters of about\n1000 km. Assume that all objects have Pluto\u2019s density of 2 \u00d7 103g/cm3. Calculate twice the mass of the\nlargest 13 objects and compare it to the mass of the main asteroid belt.\n28. What is the period of revolution about the Sun for an asteroid with a semi-major axis of 3 AU in the middle\nof the asteroid belt?\n29.

How could you determine whether those \u201corganic\u201d\nmaterials came from space or were merely the result of earthly contamination?\nWe conclude our survey of the solar system with a discussion of its origin and evolution. Some of these ideas\nwere introduced inOther Worlds: An Introduction to the Solar System; we now return to them, using the\ninformation we have learned about individual planets and smaller members of the solar system. In addition,\nastronomers have recently discovered thousands of planets around other stars, including numerous\nmultiplanet systems. This is an important new source of data, providing us a perspective that extends beyond\nour own particular (and perhaps atypical) solar system.\nBut first, we want to look at another crucial way that astronomers learn about the ancient history of the solar\nsystem: by examining samples ofprimitive matter, the debris of the processes that formed the solar system\nsome 4.5 billion years ago. Unlike the Apollo Moon rocks, these samples of cosmic material come to us free of\ncharge\u2014they literally fall from the sky. We call this material cosmic dust and meteorites. 460 14 \u2022 Cosmic Samples and the Origin of the Solar System\n14.1 Meteors\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain what a meteor is and why it is visible in the night sky\nDescribe the origins of meteor showers\nAs we saw inComets and Asteroids: Debris of the Solar System, the ices in comets evaporate when they get\nclose to the Sun, together spraying millions of tons of rock and dust into the inner solar system. There is also\ndust from asteroids that have collided and broken up. Earth is surrounded by this material. As each of the\nlarger dust or rock particles enters Earth\u2019s atmosphere, it creates a brief fiery trail; this is often called a\nshooting star, but it is properly known as ameteor.\nObserving Meteors\nMeteors are created as tiny solid particles that enter Earth\u2019s atmosphere from interplanetary space. Since the\nparticles move at speeds of many kilometers per second, friction with the air vaporizes them at altitudes\nbetween 80 and 130 kilometers. The resulting flashes of light fade out within a few seconds. These \u201cshooting\nstars\u201d got their name because at night their luminous vapors look like stars moving rapidly across the sky. To\nbe visible, a meteor must be within about 200 kilometers of the observer. On a typical dark, moonless night, an\nalert observer can see half a dozen meteors per hour. Thesesporadic meteors\u2014those not associated with a\nmeteor shower (explained in the next section)\u2014are random occurrences. Over the entire Earth, the total\nnumber of meteors bright enough to be visible totals about 25 million per day.\nThe typical meteor is produced by a particle with a mass of less than 1 gram\u2014no larger than a pea. How can\nwe see such a small particle? The light you see comes from the much larger region of heated, glowing gas\nsurrounding this little grain of interplanetary material. Because of its high speed, the energy in a pea-sized\nmeteor is as great as that of an artillery shell fired on Earth, but this energy is dispersed high in Earth\u2019s\natmosphere. (When these tiny projectiles hit an airless body like the Moon, they do make small craters and\ngenerally pulverize the surface.)\nIf a particle the size of a golf ball strikes our atmosphere, it produces a much brighter trail called a fireball\n(Figure 14.2). A piece as large as a bowling ball has a fair chance of surviving its fiery entry if its approach\nspeed is not too high. The total mass of meteoric material entering Earth\u2019s atmosphere is estimated to be\nabout 100 tons per day (which seems like a lot if you imagine it all falling in one place, but remember it is\nspread out all over our planet\u2019s surface).\nFigure14.2Fireball.When a larger piece of cosmic material strikes Earth\u2019s atmosphere, it can make a bright fireball. This time-lapse\nmeteor image was captured in April 2014 at the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). The visible trail results from\nthe burning gas around the particle. (credit: modification of work by ESO/C Malin)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14.1 \u2022 Meteors 461\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWhile it is difficult to capture images of fireballs and other meteors with still photography, it\u2019s easy to\ncapture the movement of these objects on video. The American Meteor Society maintains awebsite\n(https://openstax.org/l/30ammetsocweb)on which their members can share such videos.\nMeteor Showers\nMany\u2014perhaps most\u2014of the meteors that strike Earth are associated with specificcomets. Some of these\nperiodic comets still return to our view; others have long ago fallen apart, leaving only a trail of dust behind\nthem. The dust particles from a given comet retain approximately the orbit of their parent, continuing to move\ntogether through space but spreading out over the orbit with time. When Earth, in its travels around the Sun,\ncrosses such a dust stream, we see a sudden burst of meteor activity that usually lasts several hours; such an\nevent is called ameteor shower.\nThe dust particles and pebbles that produce meteor showers are moving together in space before they\nencounter Earth. Thus, as we look up at the atmosphere, their parallel paths seem to come toward us from a\nplace in the sky called theradiant. This is the direction in space from which the meteor stream seems to be\ndiverging, just as long railroad tracks seem to diverge from a single spot on the horizon (Figure 14.3). Meteor\nshowers are often designated by the constellation in which this radiant is located: for example, the Perseid\nmeteor shower has its radiant in the constellation of Perseus. But you are likely to see shower meteors\nanywhere in the sky, not just in the constellation of the radiant. The characteristics of some of the more\nfamous meteor showers are summarized inTable 14.1.\nFigure14.3Radiant of a Meteor Shower.The tracks of the meteors diverge from a point in the distance, just as long, parallel\nrailroad tracks appear to do.

For example, a very clumpy\ndistribution is associated with the Leonid meteors, which in 1833 and again in 1866 (after an interval of 33\nyears\u2014the period of the comet) yielded the most spectacular showers (sometimes calledmeteor storms) ever\nrecorded (Figure 14.4). During the Leonid storm on November 17, 1866, up to a hundred meteors were\nobserved per second in some locations. The Leonid shower of 2001 was not this intense, but it peaked at\nnearly a thousand meteors per hour\u2014one every few seconds\u2014observable from any dark viewing site.\nFigure14.4Leonid Meteor Storm.A painting depicts the great meteor shower or storm of 1833, shown with a bit of artistic license.\nThe most dependable annual meteor display is the Perseid shower, which appears each year for about three\nnights near August 11. In the absence of bright moonlight, you can see one meteor every few minutes during\na typical Perseid shower. Astronomers estimate that the total combined mass of the particles in the Perseid\nswarm is nearly a billion tons; the comet that gave rise to the particles in that swarm, called Swift-Tuttle, must\noriginally have had at least that much mass. However, if its initial mass were comparable to the mass\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14.1 \u2022 Meteors 463\nmeasured for Comet Halley, then Swift-Tuttle would have contained several hundred billion tons, suggesting\nthat only a very small fraction of the original cometary material survives in the meteor stream.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe California Academy of Sciences has a short animatedguide(https://openstax.org/l/30howobsmetsho)\non \u201cHow to Observe a Meteor Shower.\u201d\nNo shower meteor has ever survived its flight through the atmosphere and been recovered for laboratory\nanalysis. However, there are other ways to investigate the nature of these particles and thereby gain additional\ninsight into thecometsfrom which they are derived. Analysis of the flight paths of meteors shows that most of\nthem are very light or porous, with densities typically less than 1.0 g/cm3. If you placed a fist-sized lump of\nmeteor material on a table in Earth\u2019s gravity, it might well fall apart under its own weight.\nSuch light particles break up very easily in the atmosphere, accounting for the failure of even relatively large\nshower meteors to reach the ground. Comet dust is apparently fluffy, rather inconsequential stuff. NASA\u2019s\nStardust mission used a special substance, called aerogel, to collect these particles. We can also infer this from\nthe tiny comet particles recovered in Earth\u2019s atmosphere with high-flying aircraft (seeFigure 13.19). This fluff,\nby its very nature, cannot reach Earth\u2019s surface intact. However, more substantial fragments from asteroids do\nmake it into our laboratories, as we will see in the next section.\nSEEING FOR YOURSELF\nShowering with the Stars\nObserving ameteor showeris one of the easiest and most enjoyable astronomy activities for beginners\n(Figure 14.5). The best thing about it is that you don\u2019t need a telescope or binoculars\u2014in fact, they would\npositively get in your way. What you do need is a site far from city lights, with an unobstructed view of as\nmuch sky as possible. While the short bright lines in the sky made by individual meteors could, in theory, be\ntraced back to a radiant point (as shown inFigure 14.3), the quick blips of light that represent the end of the\nmeteor could happen anywhere above you. 464 14 \u2022 Cosmic Samples and the Origin of the Solar System\nFigure14.5Perseid Meteor Shower.This twenty-second exposure shows a meteor during the 2015 Perseid meteor shower.\n(credit: NASA/Bill Ingalls)\nThe key to observing meteor showers is not to restrict your field of view, but to lie back and scan the sky\nalertly. Try to select a good shower (see the list inTable 14.1) and a night when the Moon will not be bright\nat the time you are observing. The Moon, street lights, vehicle headlights, bright flashlights, and cell phone\nand tablet screens will all get in the way of your seeing the faint meteor streaks.\nYou will see more meteors after midnight, when you are on the hemisphere of Earth that faces forward\u2014in\nthe direction of Earth\u2019s revolution around the Sun. Before midnight, you are observing from the \u201cback side\u201d\nof Earth, and the only meteors you see will be those that traveled fast enough to catch up with Earth\u2019s\norbital motion.\nWhen you\u2019ve gotten away from all the lights, give your eyes about 15 minutes to get \u201cdark adapted\u201d\u2014that\nis, for the pupils of your eyes to open up as much as possible. (This adaptation is the same thing that\nhappens in a dark movie theater. When you first enter, you can\u2019t see a thing, but eventually, as your pupils\nopen wider, you can see pretty clearly by the faint light of the screen\u2014and notice all that spilled popcorn on\nthe floor.)\nSeasoned meteor observers find a hill or open field and make sure to bring warm clothing, a blanket, and a\nthermos of hot coffee or chocolate with them. (It\u2019s also nice to take along someone with whom you enjoy\nsitting in the dark.) Don\u2019t expect to see fireworks or a laser show: meteor showers are subtle phenomena,\nbest approached with a patience that reflects the fact that some of the dust you are watching burn up may\nfirst have been gathered into its parent comet more than 4.5 billion years ago, as the solar system was just\nforming.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14.2 \u2022 Meteorites: Stones from Heaven 465\n14.2 Meteorites: Stones from Heaven\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain the origin of meteorites and the difference between a meteor and a meteorite\nDescribe how most meteorites have been found\nExplain how primitive stone meteorites are significantly different from other types\nExplain how the study of meteorites informs our understanding of the age of the solar system.\nAny fragment of interplanetary debris that survives its fiery plunge through Earth\u2019s atmosphere is called a\nmeteorite. Meteorites fall only very rarely in any one locality, but over the entire Earth thousands fall each\nyear. Some meteorites are loners, but many are fragments from the breakup in the atmosphere of a single\nlarger object. These rocks from the sky carry a remarkable record of the formation and early history of the\nsolar system.\nExtraterrestrial Origin of Meteorites\nOccasional meteorites have been found throughout history, but their extraterrestrial origin was not accepted\nby scientists until the beginning of the nineteenth century. Before that, these strange stones were either\nignored or considered to have a supernatural origin.\nThe falls of the earliest recovered meteorites are lost in the fog of mythology. A number of religious texts\nspeak of stones from heaven, which sometimes arrived at opportune moments to smite the enemies of the\nauthors of those texts. At least one sacred meteorite has apparently survived in the form of the Ka\u2019aba, the\nholy black stone in Mecca that is revered by Islam as a relic from the time of the Patriarchs\u2014although\nunderstandably, no chip from this sacred stone has been subject to detailed chemical analysis.\nThe modern scientific history of the meteorites begins in the late eighteenth century, when a few scientists\nsuggested that some strange-looking stones had such peculiar composition and structure that they were\nprobably not of terrestrial origin. The idea that indeed \u201cstones fall from the sky\u201d was generally accepted only\nafter a scientific team led by French physicist Jean-Baptiste Biot investigated a well-observed fall in 1803.\nMeteorites sometimes fall in groups or showers. Such a fall occurs when a single larger object breaks up\nduring its violent passage through the atmosphere. It is important to remember that such ashower of\nmeteoriteshas nothing to do with ameteor shower. No meteorites have ever been recovered in association\nwith meteor showers. Whatever the ultimate source of the meteorites, they do not appear to come from the\ncomets or their associated particle streams.\nMeteorite Falls and Finds\nMeteorites are found in two ways. First, sometimes bright meteors (fireballs) are observed to penetrate the\natmosphere to low altitudes. If we search the area beneath the point where the fireball burned out, we may\nfind one or more remnants that reached the ground. Observedmeteorite falls, in other words, may lead to the\nrecovery of fallen meteorites. (A few meteorites have even hit buildings or, very rarely, people; seeMaking\nConnections: Some Striking Meteorites). The 2013 Chelyabinsk fireball, which we discussed in the chapter on\nComets and Asteroids: Debris of the Solar System, produced tens of thousands of small meteorites, many of\nthem easy to find because these dark stones fell on snow.\nThere are, however, many false alarms aboutmeteorite falls. Most observers of a bright fireball conclude that\npart of it hit the ground, but that is rarely the case. Every few months news outlets report that a meteorite has\nbeen implicated in the start of a fire. Such stories have always proved to be wrong. The meteorite is ice-cold in\nspace, and most of its interior remains cold even after its brief fiery plunge through the atmosphere. A freshly\nfallen meteorite is more likely to acquire a coating of frost than to start a fire.\nPeople sometimes discover unusual-looking rocks that turn out to be meteoritic; these rocks are termed 466 14 \u2022 Cosmic Samples and the Origin of the Solar System\nmeteorite finds. Now that the public has become meteorite-conscious, many unusual fragments, not all of\nwhich turn out to be from space, are sent to experts each year. Some scientists divide these objects into two\ncategories: \u201cmeteorites\u201d and \u201cmeteorwrongs.\u201d Outside Antarctica (see the next paragraph), genuine\nmeteorites turn up at an average rate of 25 or so per year. Most of these end up in natural history museums or\nspecialized meteoritical laboratories throughout the world, although there is a growing group of private\ncollectors interested in them as well. (Figure 14.6)\nFigure14.6Meteorite Find.(a) This early twentieth century photo shows a 15-ton iron meteorite found in the Willamette Valley in\nOregon. Although known to Native Americans in the area, it was \u201cdiscovered\u201d by an enterprising local farmer in 1902, who\nproceeded to steal it and put it on display. (b) It was eventually purchased for the American Museum of Natural History and is now\non display in the museum\u2019s Rose Center in New York City as the largest iron meteorite in the United States. In this 1911 photo, two\nyoung boys are perched in the meteor\u2019s crevices.\nSince the 1980s, sources in the Antarctic have dramatically increased our knowledge of meteorites. More than\nten thousand meteorites have been recovered from the Antarctic as a result of the motion of the ice in some\nparts of that continent (Figure 14.7). Meteorites that fall in regions where ice accumulates are buried and then\ncarried slowly to other areas where the ice is gradually worn away. After thousands of years, the rock again\nfinds itself on the surface, along with other meteorites carried to these same locations. The ice thus\nconcentrates the meteorites that have fallen both over a large area and over a long period of time. Once on\nthe surface, the rocks stand out in contrast to the ice and are thus easier to spot than in other places on our\nrocky planet.\nFigure14.7Antarctic Meteorite.(a) The US Antarctic Search for Meteorites (ANSMET) team recovers a meteorite from the Antarctic\nice during a 2001\u20132002 mission.

There is so much water and uninhabited land on our planet that rocks from space typically fall\nwhere no one even sees them come down. But given the number of meteorites that land each year, you\nmay not be surprised that a few have struck buildings, cars, and even people. In September 1938, for\nexample, a meteorite plunged through the roof of Edward McCain\u2019s garage, where it became embedded in\nthe seat of his Pontiac Coupe (Figure 14.8).\nIn November 1982, Robert and Wanda Donahue of Wethersfield, Connecticut, were watchingM*A*S*H*on\ntelevision when a 6-pound meteorite came thundering through their roof, making a hole in the living room\nceiling. After bouncing, it finally came to rest under their dining room table.\nEighteen-year-old Michelle Knapp of Peekskill, New York, got quite a surprise one morning in October 1992.\nShe had just purchased her very first car, her grandmother\u2019s 1980 Chevy Malibu. But she awoke to find its\nrear end mangled and a crater in the family driveway\u2014thanks to a 3-pound meteorite. Michelle was not\nsure whether to be devastated by the loss of her car or thrilled by all the media attention.\nIn June 1994, Jose Martin and his wife were driving from Madrid, Spain, to a golfing vacation when a fist-\nsized meteorite crashed through the windshield of their car, bounced off the dashboard, broke Jose\u2019s little\nfinger, and then landed in the back seat. Before Martin, the most recent person known to have been struck\nby a meteorite was Annie Hodges of Sylacauga, Alabama. In November 1954, she was napping on a couch\nwhen a meteorite came through the roof, bounced off a large radio set, and hit her first on the arm and\nthen on the leg.\nThe fireball that exploded at an altitude of about 20 kilometers near the Russian city of Chelyabinsk on\nFebruary 15, 2013, produced a very large meteorite shower, and quite a few of the small rocks hit buildings.\nNone is known to have hit people, however, and the individual meteorites were so small that they did not\ndo much damage\u2014much less than the shockwave from the exploding fireball, which broke the glass in\nthousands of windows.\nFigure14.8Benld Meteorite.A meteorite (inset) left a hole in the seat cushion of Edward McCain\u2019s car. (credit:\n\u201cShsilver\u201d/Wikimedia Commons) 468 14 \u2022 Cosmic Samples and the Origin of the Solar System\nMeteorite Classification\nThe meteorites in our collections have a wide range of compositions and histories, but traditionally they have\nbeen placed into three broad classes. First are theirons, composed of nearly pure metallic nickel-iron. Second\nare thestones, the term used for any silicate or rocky meteorite. Third are the rarerstony-irons, made (as the\nname implies) of mixtures of stone and metallic iron (Figure 14.9).\nFigure14.9Meteorite Types.(a) This piece of the Allende carbonaceous meteorite has white inclusions that may date back to\nbefore the formation of the solar nebula. (b) This fragment is from the iron meteorite responsible for the formation of Meteor Crater\nin Arizona. (c) This piece of the Imilac stony-iron meteorite is a beautiful mixture of green olivine crystals and metallic iron. (credit a:\nmodification of work by James St. John; credit b: modification of work by \u201cTaty2007\u201d/Wikimedia Commons; credit c: modification of\nwork by Juan Manuel Flux\u00e0)\nOf these three types, the irons and stony-irons are the most obviously extraterrestrial because of their metallic\ncontent. Pure iron almost never occurs naturally on Earth; it is generally found here as an oxide (chemically\ncombined with oxygen) or other mineral ore. Therefore, if you ever come across a chunk of metallic iron, it is\nsure to be either human-made or a meteorite.\nThe stones are much more common than the irons but more difficult to recognize. Often laboratory analysis is\nrequired to demonstrate that a particular sample is really of extraterrestrial origin, especially if it has lain on\nthe ground for some time and been subject to weathering. The most scientifically valuable stones are those\ncollected immediately after they fall, or the Antarctic samples preserved in a nearly pristine state by ice.\nTable 14.2summarizes the frequencies of occurrence of the different classes of meteorites among the fall,\nfind, and Antarctic categories.\nFrequency of Occurrence of Meteorite Classes\nClass Falls (%) Finds (%) Antarctic (%)\nPrimitive stones 88 51 85\nDifferentiated stones 8 2 12\nIrons 3 42 2\nStony-irons 1 5 1\nTable14.2\nAges and Compositions of Meteorites\nIt was not until the ages ofmeteoriteswere measured and their compositions analyzed in detail that scientists\nappreciated their true significance. The meteorites include the oldest and most primitive materials available\nfor direct study in the laboratory. The ages of stony meteorites can be determined from the careful\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14.2 \u2022 Meteorites: Stones from Heaven 469\nmeasurement of radioactive isotopes and their decay products. Almost all meteorites have radioactive ages\nbetween 4.50 and 4.56 billion years, as old as any ages we have measured in the solar system. The few\nyounger exceptions are igneous rocks that have been ejected from cratering events on the Moon or Mars (and\nhave made their way to Earth).\nThe average age for the most primitive meteorites, calculated using the most accurate values now available\nfor radioactive half-lives, is 4.56 billion years, with an uncertainty of less than 0.01 billion years. This value\n(which we round off to 4.5 billion years in this book) is taken to represent theage of the solar system\u2014the\ntime since the first solids condensed and began to form into larger bodies.\nThe traditional classification of meteorites into irons, stones, and stony-irons is easy to use because it is\nobvious from inspection which category a meteorite falls into (although it may be much more difficult to\ndistinguish a meteoritic stone from a terrestrial rock). More scientifically significant, however, is the distinction\nbetweenprimitiveanddifferentiatedmeteorites. The differentiated meteorites are fragments of larger parent\nbodies that were molten before they broke up, allowing the denser materials (such as metals) to sink to their\ncenters. Like many rocks on Earth, they have been subject to a degree of chemical reshuffling, with the\ndifferent materials sorted according to density. Differentiated meteorites include the irons, which come from\nthe metal cores of their parent bodies; stony-irons, which probably originate in regions between a metal core\nand a stony mantle; and some stones that are composed of mantle or crust material from their differentiated\nparent bodies.\nThe Most Primitive Meteorites\nFor information on theearliesthistory of the solar system, we turn to theprimitive meteorites\u2014those made of\nmaterials that havenotbeen subject to great heat or pressure since their formation. We can look at the\nspectrum of sunlight reflected from asteroids and compare their compositions with those of primitive\nmeteorites. Such analysis indicates that their parent bodies are almost certainly asteroids. Sinceasteroidsare\nbelieved to be fragments left over from the formation process of the solar system, it makes sense that they\nshould be the parent bodies of the primitive meteorites.\nThe great majority of the meteorites that reach Earth are primitive stones. Many of them are composed of\nlight-colored gray silicates with some metallic grains mixed in, but there is also an important group of darker\nstones calledcarbonaceous meteorites. As their name suggests, these meteorites contain carbon, but we also\nfind various complex organic molecules in them\u2014chemicals based on carbon, which on Earth are the chemical\nbuilding blocks of life. In addition, some of them contain chemically bound water, and many are depleted in\nmetallic iron. The carbonaceous (or C-type) asteroids are concentrated in the outer part of the asteroid belt.\nAmong the most useful of these meteorites have been the Allende meteorite that fell in Mexico (seeFigure\n14.9), the Murchison meteorite that fell in Australia (both in 1969), and the Tagish Lake meteorite that landed\nin a winter snowdrift on Tagish Lake, Canada, in 2000. (The fragile bits of dark material from the Tagish Lake\nmeteorite were readily visible against the white snow, although at first they were mistaken for wolf\ndroppings.)\nThe Murchison meteorite (Figure 14.10) is known for the variety of organic chemicals it has yielded. Most of\nthe carbon compounds in carbonaceous meteorites are complex, tarlike substances that defy exact analysis.\nMurchison also contains 16 amino acids (the building blocks of proteins), 11 of which are rare on Earth. The\nmost remarkable thing about these organic molecules is that they include equal numbers with right-handed\nand left-handed molecular symmetry. Amino acids can have either kind of symmetry, but all life on Earth has\nevolved using only theleft-handedversions to make proteins. The presence of both kinds of amino acids\nclearly demonstrates that the ones in the meteorites had an extraterrestrial origin. 470 14 \u2022 Cosmic Samples and the Origin of the Solar System\nFigure14.10Murchison Meteorite.A fragment of the meteorite that fell near the small town of Murchison, Australia, is shown next\nto a small sample of its material in a test tube, used for analysis of its chemical makeup.\nThese naturally occurring amino acids and other complex organic molecules in Murchison\u2014formed without\nthe benefit of the sheltering environment of planet Earth\u2014show that a great deal of interesting chemistry\nmust have taken place when the solar system was forming. If so, then perhaps some of the molecular building\nblocks of life on Earth were first delivered by primitive meteorites and comets. This is an interesting idea\nbecause our planet was probably much too hot for any organic materials to survive its earliest history. But\nafter Earth\u2019s surface cooled, the asteroid and comet fragments that pelted it could have refreshed its supply of\norganic materials.\n14.3 Formation of the Solar System\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the motion, chemical, and age constraints that must be met by any theory of solar system\nformation\nSummarize the physical and chemical changes during the solar nebula stage of solar system formation\nExplain the formation process of the terrestrial and giant planets\nDescribe the main events of the further evolution of the solar system\nAs we have seen, thecomets,asteroids, and meteorites are surviving remnants from the processes that\nformed the solar system. The planets, moons, and the Sun, of course, also are the products of the formation\nprocess, although the material in them has undergone a wide range of changes. We are now ready to put\ntogether the information from all these objects to discuss what is known about the origin of the solar system.\nObservational Constraints\nThere are certain basic properties of the planetary system that any theory of its formation must explain. These\nmay be summarized under three categories: motion constraints, chemical constraints, and age constraints. We\ncall themconstraintsbecause they place restrictions on our theories; unless a theory can explain the observed\nfacts, it will not survive in the competitive marketplace of ideas that characterizes the endeavor of science.\nLet\u2019s take a look at these constraints one by one.\nThere are many regularities to the motions in the solar system. We saw that the planets all revolve around the\nSun in the same direction and approximately in the plane of the Sun\u2019s own rotation. In addition, most of the\nplanets rotate in the same direction as they revolve, and most of the moons also move in counterclockwise\norbits (when seen from the north). With the exception of the comets and other trans-neptunian objects, the\nmotions of the system members define a disk or Frisbee shape. Nevertheless, a full theory must also be\nprepared to deal with the exceptions to these trends, such as theretrograde rotation(not revolution) of Venus.\nIn the realm of chemistry, we saw that Jupiter and Saturn have approximately the same\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14.3 \u2022 Formation of the Solar System 471\ncomposition\u2014dominated by hydrogen and helium. These are the two largest planets, with sufficient gravity to\nhold on to any gas present when and where they formed; thus, we might expect them to be representative of\nthe original material out of which the solar system formed. Each of the other members of the planetary system\nis, to some degree, lacking in the light elements. A careful examination of the composition of solid solar-\nsystem objects shows a striking progression from the metal-rich inner planets, through those made\npredominantly of rocky materials, out to objects with ice-dominated compositions in the outer solar system.\nThe comets in the Oort cloud and the trans-neptunian objects in the Kuiper belt are also icy objects, whereas\nthe asteroids represent a transitional rocky composition with abundant dark, carbon-rich material.\nAs we saw inOther Worlds: An Introduction to the Solar System, this general chemical pattern can be\ninterpreted as a temperature sequence: hot near the Sun and cooler as we move outward. The inner parts of\nthe system are generally missing those materials that could not condense (form a solid) at the high\ntemperatures found near the Sun. However, there are (again) important exceptions to the general pattern. For\nexample, it is difficult to explain the presence of water on Earth and Mars if these planets formed in a region\nwhere the temperature was too hot for ice to condense, unless the ice or water was brought in later from\ncooler regions. The extreme example is the observation that there are polar deposits of ice on both Mercury\nand the Moon; these are almost certainly formed and maintained by occasional comet impacts.\nAs far as age is concerned, we discussed that radioactive dating demonstrates that some rocks on the surface\nof Earth have been present for at least 3.8 billion years, and that certain lunar samples are 4.4 billion years old.\nThe primitive meteorites all have radioactive ages near 4.5 billion years. The age of these unaltered building\nblocks is considered the age of the planetary system. The similarity of the measured ages tells us that planets\nformed and their crusts cooled within a few tens of millions of years (at most) of the beginning of the solar\nsystem. Further, detailed examination of primitive meteorites indicates that they are made primarily from\nmaterial that condensed or coagulated out of a hot gas; few identifiable fragments appear to have survived\nfrom before this hot-vapor stage 4.5 billion years ago.\nThe Solar Nebula\nAll the foregoing constraints are consistent with the general idea, introduced inOther Worlds: An Introduction\nto the Solar System, that the solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago out of a rotating cloud of vapor and\ndust\u2014which we call thesolar nebula\u2014with an initial composition similar to that of the Sun today. As the solar\nnebula collapsed under its own gravity, material fell toward the center, where things became more and more\nconcentrated and hot. Increasing temperatures in the shrinking nebula vaporized most of the solid material\nthat was originally present.\nAt the same time, the collapsing nebula began to rotate faster through the conservation of angular\nmomentum (see theOrbits and GravityandEarth, Moon, and Skychapters). Like a figure skater pulling her\narms in to spin faster, the shrinking cloud spun more quickly as time went on. Now, think about how a round\nobject spins. Close to the poles, the spin rate is slow, and it gets faster as you get closer to the equator. In the\nsame way, near the poles of the nebula, where orbits were slow, the nebular material fell directly into the\ncenter. Faster moving material, on the other hand, collapsed into a flat disk revolving around the central object\n(Figure 14.11). The existence of this disk-shaped rotating nebula explains the primary motions in the solar\nsystem that we discussed in the previous section. And since they formed from a rotating disk, the planets all\norbit the same way. 472 14 \u2022 Cosmic Samples and the Origin of the Solar System\nFigure14.11Steps in Forming the Solar System.This illustration shows the steps in the formation of the solar system from the\nsolar nebula. As the nebula shrinks, its rotation causes it to flatten into a disk. Much of the material is concentrated in the hot center,\nwhich will ultimately become a star. Away from the center, solid particles can condense as the nebula cools, giving rise to\nplanetesimals, the building blocks of the planets and moons.\nPicture thesolar nebulaat the end of the collapse phase, when it was at its hottest. With no more gravitational\nenergy (from material falling in) to heat it, most of the nebula began to cool. The material in the center,\nhowever, where it was hottest and most crowded, formed astarthat maintained high temperatures in its\nimmediate neighborhood by producing its own energy. Turbulent motions and magnetic fields within the disk\ncan drain away angular momentum, robbing the disk material of some of its spin. This allowed some material\nto continue to fall into the growing star, while the rest of the disk gradually stabilized.\nThe temperature within the disk decreased with increasing distance from the Sun, much as the planets\u2019\ntemperatures vary with position today. As the disk cooled, the gases interacted chemically to produce\ncompounds; eventually these compounds condensed into liquid droplets or solid grains. This is similar to the\nprocess by which raindrops on Earth condense from moist air as it rises over a mountain.\nLet\u2019s look in more detail at how material condensed at different places in the maturing disk (Figure 14.12). The\nfirst materials to form solid grains were the metals and various rock-forming silicates. As the temperature\ndropped, these were joined throughout much of the solar nebula by sulfur compounds and by carbon- and\nwater-rich silicates, such as those now found abundantly among the asteroids. However, in the inner parts of\nthe disk, the temperature never dropped low enough for such materials as ice or carbonaceous organic\ncompounds to condense, so they were lacking on the innermost planets.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14.3 \u2022 Formation of the Solar System 473\nFigure14.12Chemical Condensation Sequence in the Solar Nebula.The scale along the bottom shows temperature; above are\nthe materials that would condense out at each temperature under the conditions expected to prevail in the nebula.\nFar from the Sun, cooler temperatures allowed the oxygen to combine with hydrogen and condense in the\nform of water (H O) ice. Beyond the orbit of Saturn, carbon and nitrogen combined with hydrogen to make\n2\nices such as methane (CH ) and ammonia (NH ). This sequence of events explains the basic chemical\n4 3\ncomposition differences among various regions of the solar system.\nEXAMPLE 14.1\nRotation of the Solar Nebula\nWe can use the concept of angular momentum to trace the evolution of the collapsing solar nebula. The\nangular momentum of an object is proportional to the square of its size (diameter) divided by its period of\nrotation (D2/P). If angular momentum is conserved, then any change in the size of a nebula must be\ncompensated for by a proportional change in period, in order to keepD2/Pconstant. Suppose the solar\nnebula began with a diameter of 10,000 AU and a rotation period of 1 million years. What is its rotation\nperiod when it has shrunk to the size of Pluto\u2019s orbit, whichAppendix Ftells us has a radius of about 40 AU?\nSolution\nWe are given that the final diameter of the solar nebula is about 80 AU. Noting the initial state before the\ncollapse and the final state at Pluto\u2019s orbit, then\nWithP equal to 1,000,000 years,P , the new rotation period, is 64 years. This is a lot shorter than the\ninitial final\nactual time Pluto takes to go around the Sun, but it gives you a sense of the kind of speeding up the\nconservation of angular momentum can produce. As we noted earlier, other mechanisms helped the\nmaterial in the disk lose angular momentum before the planets fully formed.\nCheck Your Learning\nWhat would the rotation period of the nebula in our example be when it had shrunk to the size of Jupiter\u2019s\norbit? 474 14 \u2022 Cosmic Samples and the Origin of the Solar System\nAnswer:\nThe period of the rotating nebula is inversely proportional toD2. As we have just seen,\nInitially, we haveP = 106yr andD = 104AU. Then, ifD is in AU,P (in\ninitial initial final final\nyears) is given by If Jupiter\u2019s orbit has a radius of 5.2 AU, then the diameter is 10.4 AU.\nThe period is then 1.08 years.\nFormation of the Terrestrial Planets\nThe grains that condensed in the solar nebula rather quickly joined into larger and larger chunks, until most of\nthe solid material was in the form ofplanetesimals,chunks a few kilometers to a few tens of kilometers in\ndiameter. Some planetesimals still survive today as comets and asteroids. Others have left their imprint on the\ncratered surfaces of many of the worlds we studied in earlier chapters. A substantial step up in size is required,\nhowever, to go fromplanetesimalto planet.\nSome planetesimals were large enough to attract their neighbors gravitationally and thus to grow by the\nprocess calledaccretion. While the intermediate steps are not well understood, ultimately several dozen\ncenters of accretion seem to have grown in the inner solar system. Each of these attracted surrounding\nplanetesimals until it had acquired a mass similar to that of Mercury or Mars. At this stage, we may think of\nthese objects asprotoplanets\u2014\u201cnot quite ready for prime time\u201d planets.\nEach of theseprotoplanets continued to grow by the accretion of planetesimals. Every incoming planetesimal\nwas accelerated by the gravity of the protoplanet, striking with enough energy to melt both the projectile and\na part of the impact area. Soon the entire protoplanet was heated to above the melting temperature of rocks.\nThe result wasplanetary differentiation, with heavier metals sinking toward the core and lighter silicates rising\ntoward the surface. As they were heated, the inner protoplanets lost some of their more volatile constituents\n(the lighter gases), leaving more of the heavier elements and compounds behind.\nFormation of the Giant Planets\nIn the outer solar system, where the available raw materials included ices as well as rocks, the protoplanets\ngrew to be much larger, with masses ten times greater than Earth. These protoplanets of the outer solar\nsystem were so large that they were able to attract and hold the surrounding gas. As the hydrogen and helium\nrapidly collapsed onto their cores, the giant planets were heated by the energy of contraction. But although\nthese giant planets got hotter than their terrestrial siblings, they were far too small to raise their central\ntemperatures and pressures to the point where nuclear reactions could begin (and it is such reactions that\ngive us our definition of a star). After glowing dull red for a few thousand years, the giant planets gradually\ncooled to their present state (Figure 14.13).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14.3 \u2022 Formation of the Solar System 475\nFigure14.13Saturn Seen in Infrared.This image from the Cassini spacecraft is stitched together from 65 individual observations.\nSunlight reflected at a wavelength of 2 micrometers is shown as blue, sunlight reflected at 3 micrometers is shown as green, and\nheat radiated fromSaturn\u2019s interior at 5 micrometers is red. For example,Saturn\u2019s ringsreflect sunlight at 2 micrometers, but not at\n3 and 5 micrometers, so they appear blue. Saturn\u2019s south polar regions are seen glowing with internal heat. (credit: modification of\nwork by NASA/JPL/University of Arizona)\nThe collapse of gas from the nebula onto the cores of the giant planets explains how these objects acquired\nnearly the same hydrogen-rich composition as the Sun. The process was most efficient for Jupiter and Saturn;\nhence, their compositions are most nearly \u201ccosmic.\u201d Much less gas was captured by Uranus and Neptune,\nwhich is why these two planets have compositions dominated by the icy and rocky building blocks that made\nup their large cores rather than by hydrogen and helium. The initial formation period ended when much of the\navailable raw material was used up and the solar wind (the flow of atomic particles) from the young Sun blew\naway the remaining supply of lighter gases.\nFurther Evolution of the System\nAll the processes we have just described, from the collapse of the solar nebula to the formation of\nprotoplanets, took place within a few million years. However, the story of the formation of the solar system\nwas not complete at this stage; there were many planetesimals and other debris that did not initially\naccumulate to form the planets. What was their fate?\nThecometsvisible to us today are merely the tip of the cosmic iceberg (if you\u2019ll pardon the pun). Most comets\nare believed to be in the Oort cloud, far from the region of the planets. Additional comets and icy dwarf\nplanets are in the Kuiper belt, which stretches beyond the orbit of Neptune. These icy pieces probably formed\nnear the present orbits of Uranus and Neptune but were ejected from their initial orbits by the gravitational\ninfluence of the giant planets.\nIn the inner parts of the system, remnant planetesimals and perhaps several dozen protoplanets continued to\nwhiz about. Over the vast span of time we are discussing, collisions among these objects were inevitable. Giant\nimpacts at this stage may have stripped Mercury of part of its mantle and crust, reversed the rotation of\nVenus, and broke off part of Earth to create the Moon (all events we discussed in other chapters).\nSmaller-scale impacts also added mass to the inner protoplanets. Because the gravity of the giant planets\ncould \u201cstir up\u201d the orbits of the planetesimals, the material impacting on the inner protoplanets could have\ncome from almost anywhere within the solar system. In contrast to the previous stage of accretion, therefore,\nthis new material did not represent just a narrow range of compositions.\nAs a result, much of the debris striking the inner planets was ice-rich material that had condensed in the outer\npart of the solar nebula. As this comet-like bombardment progressed, Earth accumulated the water and\nvarious organic compounds that would later be critical to the formation of life. Mars and Venus probably also\nacquired abundant water and organic materials from the same source, as Mercury and the Moon are still\ndoing to form their icy polar caps. 476 14 \u2022 Cosmic Samples and the Origin of the Solar System\nGradually, as the planets swept up or ejected the remaining debris, most of the planetesimals disappeared. In\ntwo regions, however, stable orbits are possible where leftover planetesimals could avoid impacting the\nplanets or being ejected from the system. These regions are the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and\nthe Kuiper belt beyond Neptune. The planetesimals (and their fragments) that survive in these special\nlocations are what we now call asteroids, comets, and trans-neptunian objects.\nAstronomers used to think that the solar system that emerged from this early evolution was similar to what we\nsee today. Detailed recent studies of the orbits of the planets and asteroids, however, suggest that there were\nmore violent events soon afterward, perhaps involving substantial changes in the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn.\nThese two giant planets control, through their gravity, the distribution of asteroids. Working backward from\nour present solar system, it appears that orbital changes took place during the first few hundred million years.\nOne consequence may have been scattering of asteroids into the inner solar system, causing the period of\n\u201cheavy bombardment\u201d recorded in the oldest lunar craters.\n14.4 Comparison with Other Planetary Systems\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe how the observations of protoplanetary disks provides evidence for the existence of other\nplanetary systems\nExplain the two primary methods for detection of exoplanets\nCompare the main characteristics of otherplanetary systems with the features of the solar system\nUntil the middle 1990s, the practical study of the origin of planets focused on our single known example\u2014the\nsolar system. Although there had been a great deal of speculation about planets circling other stars, none had\nactually been detected. Logically enough, in the absence of data, most scientists assumed that our own system\nwas likely to be typical. They were in for a big surprise.\nDiscovery of Other Planetary Systems\nInThe Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar System, we discuss the formation of stars\nand planets in some detail. Stars like our Sun are formed when dense regions in a molecular cloud (made of\ngas and dust) feel an extra gravitational force and begin to collapse. This is a runaway process: as the cloud\ncollapses, the gravitational force gets stronger, concentrating material into a protostar. Roughly half of the\ntime, the protostar will fragment or be gravitationally bound to other protostars, forming a binary or multiple\nstar system\u2014stars that are gravitationally bound and orbit each other. The rest of the time, the protostar\ncollapses in isolation, as was the case for our Sun. In all cases, as we saw, conservation of angular momentum\nresults in a spin-up of the collapsing protostar, with surrounding material flattened into a disk. Today, this kind\nof structure can actually be observed. The Hubble Space Telescope, as well as powerful new ground-based\ntelescopes, enable astronomers to study directly the nearest of thesecircumstellar disksin regions of space\nwhere stars are being born today, such as the Orion Nebula (Figure 14.14) or the Taurus star-forming region.\nFigure14.14Protoplanetary Disk in the Orion Nebula.The Hubble Space Telescope imaged this protoplanetary disk in theOrion\nNebula, a region of active star formation, using two different filters. The disk, about 17 times the size of our solar system, is in an\nedge-on orientation to us, and the newly formed star is shining at the center of the flattened dust cloud. The dark areas indicate\nabsorption, not an absence of material. In the left image we see the light of the nebula and the dark cloud; in the right image, a\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14.4 \u2022 Comparison with Other Planetary Systems 477\nspecial filter was used to block the light of the background nebula. You can see gas above and below the disk set to glow by the light\nof the newborn star hidden by the disk. (credit: modification of work by Mark McCaughrean (Max-Planck-Institute for Astronomy), C.\nRobert O\u2019Dell (Rice University), and NASA)\nMany of thecircumstellar disks we have discovered show internal structure. The disks appear to be donut-\nshaped, with gaps close to the star. Such gaps indicate that the gas and dust in the disk have already collapsed\nto form large planets (Figure 14.15). The newly born protoplanets are too small and faint to be seen directly,\nbut the depletion of raw materials in the gaps hints at the presence of something invisible in the inner part of\nthe circumstellar disk\u2014and that something is almost certainly one or more planets. Theoretical models of\nplanet formation, like the one seen at right inFigure 14.15, have long supported the idea that planets would\nclear gaps as they form in disks.\nFigure14.15Protoplanetary Disk around HL Tau.(a) This image of a protoplanetary disk around HL Tau was taken with the\nAtacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), which allows astronomers to construct radio images that rival those taken\nwith visible light. (b) Newly formed planets that orbit the central star clear out dust lanes in their paths, just as our theoretical\nmodels predict. This computer simulation shows the empty lane and spiral density waves that result as a giant planet is forming\nwithin the disk. The planet is not shown to scale. (credit a: modification of work by ALMA (ESO/NAOJ/NRAO); credit b: modification of\nwork by NASA/ESA and A. Feild (STScI))\nOur figure showsHL Tau, a one-million-year-old \u201cnewborn\u201d star in the Taurus star-forming region. The star is\nembedded in a shroud of dust and gas that obscures our visible-light view of a circumstellar disk around the\nstar. In 2014 astronomers obtained a dramatic view of the HL Tau circumstellar disk using millimeter waves,\nwhich pierce the cocoon of dust around the star, showing dust lanes being carved out by several newly formed\nprotoplanets. As the mass of the protoplanets increases, they travel in their orbits at speeds that are faster\nthan the dust and gas in the circumstellar disk. As the protoplanets plow through the disk, their gravitational\nreach begins to exceed their cross-sectional area, and they become very efficient at sweeping up material and\ngrowing until they clear a gap in the disk. The image ofFigure 14.15shows us that a number of protoplanets\nare forming in the disk and that they were able to form faster than our earlier ideas had suggested\u2014all in the\nfirst million years of star formation.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nFor an explanation of ALMA\u2019s ground-breaking observations of HL Tau and what they reveal about plant\nformation, watch thisvideocast(https://openstax.org/l/30eusoobhltavid)from the European Southern\nObservatory.\nDiscovering Exoplanets\nYou might think that with the advanced telescopes and detectors astronomers have today, they could directly\nimage planets around nearby stars (which we callexoplanets). This has proved extremely difficult, however, 478 14 \u2022 Cosmic Samples and the Origin of the Solar System\nnot only because the exoplanets are faint, but also because they are generally lost in the brilliant glare of the\nstar they orbit. As we discuss in more detail inThe Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar\nSystem, the detection techniques that work best are indirect: they observe the effects of the planet on the star\nit orbits, rather than seeing the planet itself.\nThe first technique that yielded many planet detections is very high-resolution stellar spectroscopy. The\nDoppler effectlets astronomers measure the star\u2019sradial velocity:that is, the speed of the star, toward us or\naway from us, relative to the observer. If there is a massive planet in orbit around the star, the gravity of the\nplanet causes the star to wobble, changing its radial velocity by a small but detectable amount. The distance of\nthe star does not matter, as long as it is bright enough for us to take very high quality spectra.\nMeasurements of the variation in the star\u2019s radial velocity as the planet goes around the star can tell us the\nmass and orbital period of the planet. If there are several planets present, their effects on the radial velocity\ncan be disentangled, so the entire planetary system can be deciphered\u2014as long as the planets are massive\nenough to produce a measureableDoppler effect. This detection technique is most sensitive to large planets\norbiting close to the star, since these produce the greatest wobble in their stars. It has been used on large\nground-based telescopes to detect hundreds of planets, including one around Proxima Centauri, the nearest\nstar to the Sun.\nThe second indirect technique is based on the slight dimming of a star when one of its planetstransits, or\ncrosses over the face of the star, as seen from Earth. Astronomers do not see the planet, but only detect its\npresence from careful measurements of a change in the brightness of the star over long periods of time. If the\nslight dips in brightness repeat at regular intervals, we can determine the orbital period of the planet. From\nthe amount of starlight obscured, we can measure the planet\u2019s size.\nWhile some transits have been measured from Earth, large-scale application of thistransit techniquerequires\na telescope in space, above the atmosphere and its distortions of the star images. It has been most\nsuccessfully applied from the NASA Kepler space observatory, which was built for the sole purpose of \u201cstaring\u201d\nfor 5 years at a single part of the sky, continuously monitoring the light from more than 150,000 stars. The\nprimary goal of Kepler was to determine the frequency of occurrence of exoplanets of different sizes around\ndifferent classes of stars. Like the Doppler technique, the transit observations favor discovery of large planets\nand short-period orbits. The Kepler observations closed down in 2018 when the spacecraft ran out of the fuel\nneeded to point the telescope.\nRecent detection of exoplanets using both the Doppler and transit techniques has been incredibly successful.\nWithin two decades, we went from no knowledge of other planetary systems to a catalog ofthousandsof\nexoplanets. Most of theexoplanets found so far are more massive than or larger in size than Earth. It is not\nthat Earth analogs do not exist. Rather, the shortage of small rocky planets is an observational bias: smaller\nplanets are more difficult to detect.\nAnalyses of the data to correct for such biases or selection effects indicate that small planets (like the\nterrestrial planets in our system) are actually much more common than giant planets. Also relatively common\nare \u201csuper Earths,\u201d planets with two to ten times the mass of our planet (Figure 14.16). We don\u2019t have any of\nthese in our solar system, but nature seems to have no trouble making them elsewhere. Overall, the Kepler\ndata suggest that approximately one quarter of stars have exoplanet systems, implying the existence of at\nleast 50 billion planets in our Galaxy alone.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14.4 \u2022 Comparison with Other Planetary Systems 479\nFigure14.16Transiting Planets by Size.This bar graph shows the planets found so far using the transit method (the vast majority\nfound by the Kepler mission). The orange parts of each bar indicate the planets announced by the Kepler team in May 2016. Note\nthat the largest number of planets found so far are in two categories that we don\u2019t have in our own solar system\u2014planets whose\nsize is between Earth\u2019s and Neptune\u2019s. (credit: modification of work by NASA)\nThe Configurations of Other Planetary Systems\nLet\u2019s look more closely at the progress in the detection of exoplanets.Figure 14.17shows the planets that\nwere discovered each year by the two techniques we discussed. In the early years of exoplanet discovery, most\nof the planets were similar in mass toJupiter. This is because, as mentioned above, the most massive planets\nwere easiest to detect. In more recent years, planets smaller than Neptune and even close to the size of Earth\nhave been detected.\nFigure14.17Masses of Exoplanets Discovered by Year.Horizontal lines are drawn to reference the masses of Jupiter, Saturn,\nNeptune, and Earth. The gray dots indicate planets discovered by measuring the radial velocity of the star, and the red dots are for\nplanets that transit their stars. In the early years, the only planets that could be detected were similar in mass to Jupiter.\nImprovements in technology and observing strategies enabled the detection of lower mass planets as time went on, and now even\nsmaller worlds are being found. (Note that this tally ends in 2014, but the trend should be clear.) 480 14 \u2022 Cosmic Samples and the Origin of the Solar System\nWe also know that many exoplanets are in multiplanet systems. This is one characteristic that our solar system\nshares with exosystems. Looking back atFigure 14.15and seeing how such large disks can give rise to more\nthan one center of condensation, it is not too surprising that multiplanet systems are a typical outcome of\nplanet formation. Astronomers have tried to measure whether multiple planet systems all lie in the same\nplane using astrometry. This is a difficult measurement to make with current technology, but it is an important\nmeasurement that could help us understand the origin and evolution of planetary systems.\nComparison between Theory and Data\nMany of the planetary systems discovered so far do not resemble our own solar system. Consequently, we\nhave had to reassess some aspects of the \u201cstandard models\u201d for the formation of planetary systems. Science\nsometimes works in this way, with new data contradicting our expectations. The press often talks about a\nscientist making experiments to \u201cconfirm\u201d a theory. Indeed, it is comforting when new data support a\nhypothesis or theory and increase our confidence in an earlier result. But the most exciting and productive\nmoments in science often come when new datadon\u2019tsupport existing theories, forcing scientists to rethink\ntheir position and develop new and deeper insights into the way nature works.\nNothing about the new planetary systems contradicts the basic idea that planets form from the aggregation\n(clumping) of material within circumstellar disks. However, the existence of \u201chot Jupiters\u201d\u2014planets of jovian\nmass that are closer to their stars than the orbit of Mercury\u2014poses the biggest problem. As far as we know, a\ngiant planet cannot be formed without the condensation of water ice, and water ice is not stable so close to\nthe heat of a star. It seems likely that all the giant planets, \u201chot\u201d or \u201cnormal,\u201d formed at a distance of several\nastronomical units from the star, but we now see that they did not necessarily stay there. This discovery has\nled to a revision in our understanding of planet formation that now includes \u201cplanet migrations\u201d within the\nprotoplanetary disk, or later gravitational encounters between sibling planets that scatter one of the planets\ninward.\nMany exoplanets have large orbital eccentricity (recall this means the orbits are not circular). High\neccentricities were not expected for planets that form in a disk. This discovery provides further support for the\nscattering of planets when they interact gravitationally. When planets change each other\u2019s motions, their\norbits could become much more eccentric than the ones with which they began.\nThere are several suggestions for ways migration might have occurred. Most involve interactions between the\ngiant planets and the remnant material in the circumstellar disk from which they formed. These interactions\nwould have taken place when the system was very young, while material still remained in the disk. In such\ncases, the planet travels at a faster velocity than the gas and dust and feels a kind of \u201cheadwind\u201d (or friction)\nthat causes it to lose energy and spiral inward. It is still unclear how the spiraling planet stops before it\nplunges into the star. Our best guess is that this plunge into the star is the fate for many protoplanets;\nhowever, clearly some migrating planets can stop their inward motions and escape this destruction, since we\nfind hot Jupiters in many mature planetary systems.\n14.5 Planetary Evolution\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the geological activity during the evolution of the planets, particularly on the terrestrial planets\nDescribe the factors that affect differences in elevation on the terrestrial planets\nExplain how the differences in atmosphere on Venus, Earth, and Mars evolved from similar starting points\nin the early history of the solar system\nWhile we await more discoveries and better understanding of other planetary systems, let us look again at the\nearly history of our own solar system, after the dissipation of our dust disk. The era of giant impacts was\nprobably confined to the first 100 million years of solar system history, ending by about 4.4 billion years ago.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14.5 \u2022 Planetary Evolution 481\nShortly thereafter, the planets cooled and began to assume their present aspects. Up until about 4 billion\nyears ago, they continued to acquire volatile materials, and their surfaces were heavily cratered from the\nremaining debris that hit them. However, as external influences declined, all the terrestrial planets as well as\nthe moons of the outer planets began to follow their own evolutionary courses. The nature of this evolution\ndepended on each object\u2019s composition, mass, and distance from the Sun.\nGeological Activity\nWe have seen a wide range in the level of geological activity on the terrestrial planets and icy moons. Internal\nsources of such activity (as opposed to pummeling from above) require energy, either in the form of\nprimordial heat left over from the formation of a planet or from the decay of radioactive elements in the\ninterior. The larger the planet or moon, the more likely it is to retain its internal heat and the more slowly it\ncools\u2014this is the \u201cbaked potato effect\u201d mentioned inOther Worlds: An Introduction to the Solar System.\nTherefore, we are more likely to see evidence of continuing geological activity on the surface of larger (solid)\nworlds (Figure 14.18). Jupiter\u2019s moon Io is an interesting exception to this rule; we saw that it has an unusual\nsource of heat from the gravitational flexing of its interior by the tidal pull of Jupiter. Europa is probably also\nheated by jovian tides. Saturn may be having a similar effect on its moon Enceladus.\nFigure14.18Stages in the Geological History of a Terrestrial Planet.In this image, time increases downward along the left side,\nwhere the stages are described. Each planet is shown roughly in its present stage. The smaller the planet, the more quickly it passes\nthrough these stages.\nTheMoon, the smallest of the terrestrial worlds, was internally active until about 3.3 billion years ago, when its\nmajor volcanism ceased. Since that time, its mantle has cooled and become solid, and today even internal\nseismic activity has declined to almost zero. The Moon is a geologically dead world. Although we know much\nless about Mercury, it seems likely that this planet, too, ceased most volcanic activity about the same time the\nMoon did.\nMarsrepresents an intermediate case, and it has been much more active than the Moon. The southern\nhemisphere crust had formed by 4 billion years ago, and the northern hemisphere volcanic plains seem to be\ncontemporary with the lunar maria. However, the Tharsis bulge formed somewhat later, and activity in the\nlarge Tharsis volcanoes has apparently continued on and off to the present era.\nEarthand Venus are the largest and most active terrestrial planets. Our planet experiences global plate\ntectonics driven by convection in its mantle. As a result, our surface is continually reworked, and most of\nEarth\u2019s surface material is less than 200 million years old.Venushas generally similar levels of volcanic activity,\nbut unlike Earth, it has not experienced plate tectonics. Most of its surface appears to be no more than 500\nmillion years old. We did see that the surface of our sister planet is being modified by a kind of \u201cblob\ntectonics\u201d\u2014where hot material from below puckers and bursts through the surface, leading to coronae,\npancake volcanoes, and other such features. A better understanding of the geological differences between 482 14 \u2022 Cosmic Samples and the Origin of the Solar System\nVenus and Earth is a high priority for planetary geologists.\nThe geological evolution of the icy moons and Pluto has been somewhat different from that of the terrestrial\nplanets. Tidal energy sources have been active, and the materials nature has to work with are not the same.\nOn these outer worlds, we see evidence of low-temperature volcanism, with the silicate lava of the inner\nplanets being supplemented by sulfur compounds on Io, and replaced by water and other ices on Pluto and\nother outer-planet moons.\nElevation Differences\nLet\u2019s look at some specific examples of how planets differ. The mountains on the terrestrial planets owe their\norigins to different processes. On the Moon and Mercury, the major mountains are ejecta thrown up by the\nlarge basin-forming impacts that took place billions of years ago. Most large mountains on Mars are\nvolcanoes, produced by repeated eruptions of lava from the same vents. There are similar (but smaller)\nvolcanoes on Earth and Venus. However, the highest mountains on Earth and Venus are the result of\ncompression and uplift of the surface. On Earth, this crustal compression results from collisions of one\ncontinental plate with another.\nIt is interesting to compare the maximum heights of the volcanoes on Earth, Venus, and Mars (Figure 14.19).\nOn Venus and Earth, the maximum elevation differences between these mountains and their surroundings are\nabout 10 kilometers. Olympus Mons, in contrast, towers more than 20 kilometers above its surroundings and\nnearly 30 kilometers above the lowest elevation areas on Mars.\nFigure14.19Highest Mountains on Mars, Venus, and Earth.Mountains can rise taller on Mars because Mars has less surface\ngravity and no moving plates. The vertical scale is exaggerated by a factor of three to make comparison easier. The label \u201csea level\u201d\nrefers only to Earth, of course, since the other two planets don\u2019t have oceans. Mauna Loa and Mt. Everest are on Earth,Olympus\nMonsis on Mars, and theMaxwell Mountainsare on Venus.\nOne reasonOlympus Mons(Figure 14.20) is so much higher than its terrestrial counterparts is that the crustal\nplates on Earth never stop moving long enough to let a really large volcano grow. Instead, the moving plate\ncreates a long row of volcanoes like the Hawaiian Islands. On Mars (and perhaps Venus) the crust remains\nstationary with respect to the underlying hot spot, and so a single volcano can continue to grow for hundreds\nof millions of years.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14.5 \u2022 Planetary Evolution 483\nFigure14.20Olympus Mons.The largest martian volcano is seen from above in this spectacular composite image created from\nmany Viking orbiter photographs. The volcano is nearly 500 kilometers wide at its base and more than 20 kilometers high. (Its height\nis almost three times the height of the tallest mountain on Earth.) (credit: modification of work by NASA/USGS)\nA second difference relates to the strength of gravity on the three planets. The surface gravity on Venus is\nnearly the same as that on Earth, but on Mars it is only about one third as great. In order for a mountain to\nsurvive, its internal strength must be great enough to support its weight against the force of gravity. Volcanic\nrocks have known strengths, and we can calculate that on Earth, 10 kilometers is about the limit. For instance,\nwhen new lava is added to the top of Mauna Loa in Hawaii, the mountain slumps downward under its own\nweight. The same height limit applies on Venus, where the force of gravity is the same as Earth\u2019s. On Mars,\nhowever, with its lesser surface gravity, much greater elevation differences can be supported, which helps\nexplain why Olympus Mons is more than twice as high as the tallest mountains of Venus or Earth.\nBy the way, the same kind of calculation that determines the limiting height of a mountain can be used to\nascertain the largest body that can have an irregular shape. Gravity, if it can, pulls all objects into the most\n\u201cefficient\u201d shape (where all the outside points are equally distant from the center). All the planets and larger\nmoons are nearly spherical, due to the force of their own gravity pulling them into a sphere. But the smaller\nthe object, the greater the departure from spherical shape that the strength of its rocks can support. For\nsilicate bodies, the limiting diameter is about 400 kilometers; larger objects will always be approximately\nspherical, while smaller ones can have almost any shape (as we see in photographs ofasteroids, such as\nFigure 14.21). 484 14 \u2022 Cosmic Samples and the Origin of the Solar System\nFigure14.21Irregular Asteroid.Small objects such as asteroidIda(shown here in multiple views taken by the Galileo spacecraft\ncamera as it flew past) are generally irregular or elongated; they do not have strong enough gravity to pull them into a spherical\nshape. Ida is about 60 kilometers long in its longest dimension. (credit: modification of work by NASA/JPL)\nAtmospheres\nThe atmospheres of the planets were formed by a combination of gas escaping from their interiors and the\nimpacts of volatile-rich debris from the outer solar system. Each of the terrestrial planets must have originally\nhad similar atmospheres, but Mercury was too small and too hot to retain its gas. The Moon probably never\nhad an atmosphere since the material composing it was depleted in volatile materials.\nThe predominant volatile gas on the terrestrial planets is now carbon dioxide (CO ), but initially there were\n2\nprobably also hydrogen-containing gases. In this more chemicallyreduced(hydrogen-dominated)\nenvironment, there should have been large amounts of carbon monoxide (CO) and traces of ammonia (NH )\n3\nand methane (CH ). Ultraviolet light from the Sun split apart the molecules of reducing gases in the inner solar\n4\nsystem, however. Most of the light hydrogen atoms escaped, leaving behind the oxidized (oxygen-dominated)\natmospheres we see today onEarth,Venus, andMars.\nThe fate of water was different on each of these three planets, depending on its size and distance from the\nSun. Early in its history, Mars apparently had a thick atmosphere with abundant liquid water, but it could not\nretain those conditions. The CO necessary for a substantial greenhouse effect was lost, the temperature\n2\ndropped, and eventually the remaining water froze. On Venus the reverse process took place, with a runaway\ngreenhouse effect leading to the permanent loss of water. Only Earth managed to maintain the delicate\nbalance that permits liquid water to persist on its surface.\nWith the water gone, Venus and Mars each ended up with an atmosphere of about 96 percent carbon dioxide\nand a few percent nitrogen. On Earth, the presence first of water and then of life led to a very different kind of\natmosphere. The CO was removed and deposited in marine sediment. The proliferation of life forms that\n2\ncould photosynthesize eventually led to the release of more oxygen than natural chemical reactions can\nremove from the atmosphere. As a result, thanks to the life on its surface, Earth finds itself with a great\ndeficiency of CO , with nitrogen as the most abundant gas, and the only planetary atmosphere that contains\n2\nfree oxygen.\nIn the outer solar system,Titanis the only moon with a substantial atmosphere. This object must have\ncontained sufficient volatiles\u2014such as ammonia, methane, and nitrogen\u2014to form an atmosphere. Thus, today\nTitan\u2019s atmosphere consists primarily of nitrogen. Compared with those on the inner planets, temperatures on\nTitan are too low for either carbon dioxide or water to be in vapor form. With these two common volatiles\nfrozen solid, it is perhaps not too surprising that nitrogen has ended up as the primary atmospheric\nconstituent.\nWe see that nature, starting with one set of chemical constituents, can fashion a wide range of final\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14.5 \u2022 Planetary Evolution 485\natmospheres appropriate to the conditions and history of each world. The atmosphere we have on Earth is the\nresult of many eons of evolution and adaptation. And, as we saw, it can be changed by the actions of the life\nforms that inhabit the planet.\nOne of the motivations for exploration of our planetary system is the search for life, beginning with a survey\nfor potentially habitable environments. Mercury, Venus, and the Moon are not suitable; neither are most of the\nmoons in the outer solar system. The giant planets, which do not have solid surfaces, also fail the test for\nhabitability.\nSo far, the search for habitable environments has focused on the presence of liquid water. Earth and Europa\nboth have large oceans, although Europa\u2019s ocean is covered with a thick crust of ice. Mars has a long history of\nliquid water on its surface, although the surface today is mostly dry and cold. However, there is strong\nevidence for subsurface water on Mars, and even today water flows briefly on the surface under the right\nconditions.Enceladusmay have the most accessible liquid water, which is squirting into space by means of the\ngeysers observed with our Cassini spacecraft. Titan is in many ways the most interesting world we have\nexplored. It is far too cold for liquid water, but with its thick atmosphere and hydrocarbon lakes, it may be the\nbest place to search for \u201clife as we don\u2019t know it.\u201d\nWe now come to the end of our study of the planetary system. Although we have learned a great deal about\nthe other planets during the past few decades of spacecraft exploration, much remains unknown. Discoveries\nin recent years of geological activity on Titan and Enceladus were unexpected, as was the complex surface of\nPluto revealed by New Horizons. The study of exoplanetary systems provides a new perspective, teaching us\nthat there is much more variety among planetary systems than scientists had imagined a few decades ago.\nThe exploration of the solar system is one of the greatest human adventures, and, in many ways, it has just\nbegun. 486 14 \u2022 Key Terms\nKey Terms\naccretion the gradual accumulation of mass, as by a planet forming from colliding particles in the solar\nnebula\nexoplanet a planet orbiting a star other than our Sun\niron meteorite a meteorite composed primarily of iron and nickel\nmeteor a small piece of solid matter that enters Earth\u2019s atmosphere and burns up, popularly called a\nshooting starbecause it is seen as a small flash of light\nmeteor shower many meteors appearing to radiate from one point in the sky; produced when Earth passes\nthrough a cometary dust stream\nmeteorite a portion of a meteor that survives passage through the atmosphere and strikes the ground\nstony meteorite a meteorite composed mostly of stony material, either primitive or differentiated\nstony-iron meteorite a type of differentiated meteorite that is a blend of nickel-iron and silicate materials\nSummary\n14.1Meteors\nWhen a fragment of interplanetary dust strikes Earth\u2019s atmosphere, it burns up to create a meteor. Streams of\ndust particles traveling through space together produce meteor showers, in which we see meteors diverging\nfrom a spot in the sky called the radiant of the shower. Many meteor showers recur each year and are\nassociated with particular comets that have left dust behind as they come close to the Sun and their ices\nevaporate (or have broken up into smaller pieces).\n14.2Meteorites: Stones from Heaven\nMeteorites are the debris from space (mostly asteroid fragments) that survive to reach the surface of Earth.\nMeteorites are calledfindsorfallsaccording to how they are discovered; the most productive source today is\nthe Antarctic ice cap. Meteorites are classified as irons, stony-irons, or stones accordingly to their composition.\nMost stones are primitive objects, dated to the origin of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago. The most\nprimitive are the carbonaceous meteorites, such as Murchison and Allende. These can contain a number of\norganic (carbon-rich) molecules.\n14.3Formation of the Solar System\nA viable theory of solar system formation must take into account motion constraints, chemical constraints, and\nage constraints. Meteorites, comets, and asteroids are survivors of the solar nebula out of which the solar\nsystem formed. This nebula was the result of the collapse of an interstellar cloud of gas and dust, which\ncontracted (conserving its angular momentum) to form our star, the Sun, surrounded by a thin, spinning disk\nof dust and vapor. Condensation in the disk led to the formation of planetesimals, which became the building\nblocks of the planets. Accretion of infalling materials heated the planets, leading to their differentiation. The\ngiant planets were also able to attract and hold gas from the solar nebula. After a few million years of violent\nimpacts, most of the debris was swept up or ejected, leaving only the asteroids and cometary remnants\nsurviving to the present.\n14.4Comparison with Other Planetary Systems\nThe first planet circling a distant solar-type star was announced in 1995. Twenty years later, thousands of\nexoplanets have been identified, including planets with sizes and masses between Earth\u2019s and Neptune\u2019s,\nwhich we don\u2019t have in our own solar system. A few percent of exoplanet systems have \u201chot Jupiters,\u201d massive\nplanets that orbit close to their stars, and many exoplanets are also in eccentric orbits. These two\ncharacteristics are fundamentally different from the attributes of gas giant planets in our own solar system\nand suggest that giant planets can migrate inward from their place of formation where it is cold enough for\nice to form. Current data indicate that small (terrestrial type) rocky planets are common in our Galaxy; indeed,\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14 \u2022 For Further Exploration 487\nthere must be tens of billions of such earthlike planets.\n14.5Planetary Evolution\nAfter their common beginning, each of the planets evolved on its own path. Different possible outcomes are\nillustrated by comparison of the terrestrial planets (Earth, Venus, Mars, Mercury, and the Moon). All are rocky,\ndifferentiated objects. The level of geological activity is proportional to mass: greatest for Earth and Venus,\nless for Mars, and absent for the Moon and Mercury. However, tides from another nearby world can also\ngenerate heat to drive geological activity, as shown by Io, Europa, and Enceladus. Pluto is also active, to the\nsurprise of planetary scientists. On the surfaces of solid worlds, mountains can result from impacts, volcanism,\nor uplift. Whatever their origin, higher mountains can be supported on smaller planets that have less surface\ngravity. The atmospheres of the terrestrial planets may have acquired volatile materials from comet impacts.\nThe Moon and Mercury lost their atmospheres; most volatiles on Mars are frozen due to its greater distance\nfrom the Sun and its thinner atmosphere; and Venus retained CO but lost H O when it developed a massive\n2 2\ngreenhouse effect. Only Earth still has liquid water on its surface and hence can support life.\nFor Further Exploration\nNote: Resources about exoplanets are provided inThe Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets outside the\nSolar System.\nArticles\nMeteors and Meteorites\nAlper, J. \u201cIt Came from Outer Space.\u201dAstronomy(November 2002): 36.

Ever since the true (cosmic) origin of meteorites was understood, people have tried to make money selling\nthem to museums and planetariums. More recently, a growing number of private collectors have been\ninterested in purchasing meteorite fragments, and a network of dealers (some more reputable than\nothers) has sprung up to meet this need. What does your group think of all this? Who should own a\nmeteorite? The person on whose land it falls, the person who finds it, or the local, state, or federal\ngovernment where it falls? What if it falls on public land? Should there be any limit to what people charge\nfor meteorites? Or should all meteorites be the common property of humanity? (If you can, try to research\nwhat the law is now in your area. See, for example, http://www.space.com/18009-meteorite-collectors-\npublic-lands-rules.html.)\nB. Your group has been formed to advise a very rich person who wants to buy some meteorites but is afraid\nof being cheated and sold some Earth rocks. How would you advise your client to make sure that the\nmeteorites she buys are authentic?\nC. Your group is a committee set up to give advice to NASA about how to design satellites and telescopes in\nspace to minimize the danger of meteor impacts. Remember that the heavier a satellite is, the harder\n(more expensive) it is to launch. What would you include in your recommendations?\nD. Discuss what you would do if you suddenly found that a small meteorite had crashed in or near your\nhome. Whom would you call first, second, third? What would you do with the sample? (And would any\ndamage to your home be covered by your insurance?)\nE. A friend of your group really wants to see a meteor shower. The group becomes a committee to assist her\nin fulfilling this desire. What time of year would be best? What equipment would you recommend she\ngets? What advice would you give her?\nF. Work with your group to find a table of the phases of the Moon for the next calendar year. Then look at\nthe table of well-known meteor showers in this chapter and report on what phase the Moon will be in\nduring each shower. (The brighter the Moon is in the night sky, the harder it is to see the faint flashes of\nmeteors.)\nG. Thinking that all giant planets had to be far from their stars (because the ones in our solar system are) is\nan example of making theories without having enough data (or examples). Can your group make a list of\nother instances in science (and human relations) where we have made incorrect judgments without\nhaving explored enough examples?\nH. Have your group list and then discuss several ways in which the discovery of a diverse group of exoplanets\n(planets orbiting other stars) has challenged our conventional view of the formation of planetary systems\nlike our solar system.\nExercises\nReview Questions\n1. A friend of yours who has not taken astronomy sees a meteor shower (she calls it a bunch of shooting\nstars). The next day she confides in you that she was concerned that the stars in the Big Dipper (her\nfavorite star pattern) might be the next ones to go. How would you put her mind at ease?\n2. In what ways are meteorites different from meteors? What is the probable origin of each?\n3. How are comets related to meteor showers? 490 14 \u2022 Exercises\n4. What do we mean by primitive material? How can we tell if a meteorite is primitive?\n5. Describe the solar nebula, and outline the sequence of events within the nebula that gave rise to the\nplanetesimals.\n6. Why do the giant planets and their moons have compositions different from those of the terrestrial\nplanets?\n7. How do the planets discovered so far around other stars differ from those in our own solar system? List at\nleast two ways.\n8. Explain the role of impacts in planetary evolution, including both giant impacts and more modest ones.\n9. Why are some planets and moons more geologically active than others?\n10. Summarize the origin and evolution of the atmospheres of Venus, Earth, and Mars.\n11. Why do meteors in a meteor shower appear to come from just one point in the sky?\nThought Questions\n12. What methods do scientists use to distinguish a meteorite from terrestrial material?\n13. Why do iron meteorites represent a much higher percentage of finds than of falls?\n14. Why is it more useful to classify meteorites according to whether they are primitive or differentiated\nrather than whether they are stones, irons, or stony-irons?\n15. Which meteorites are the most useful for defining the age of the solar system? Why?\n16. Suppose a new primitive meteorite is discovered (sometime after it falls in a field of soybeans) and\nanalysis reveals that it contains a trace of amino acids, all of which show the same rotational symmetry\n(unlike the Murchison meteorite). What might you conclude from this finding?\n17. How do we know when the solar system formed? Usually we say that the solar system is 4.5 billion years\nold. To what does this age correspond?\n18. We have seen how Mars can support greater elevation differences than Earth or Venus. According to the\nsame arguments, the Moon should have higher mountains than any of the other terrestrial planets, yet\nwe know it does not. What is wrong with applying the same line of reasoning to the mountains on the\nMoon?\n19. Present theory suggests that giant planets cannot form without condensation of water ice, which\nbecomes vapor at the high temperatures close to a star. So how can we explain the presence of jovian-\nsized exoplanets closer to their star than Mercury is to our Sun?\n20. Why are meteorites of primitive material considered more important than other meteorites? Why have\nmost of them been found in Antarctica?\nFiguring for Yourself\n21. How long would material take to go around if the solar nebula inExample 14.1became the size of Earth\u2019s\norbit?\n22. Consider the differentiated meteorites. We think the irons are from the cores, the stony-irons are from the\ninterfaces between mantles and cores, and the stones are from the mantles of their differentiated parent\nbodies. If these parent bodies were like Earth, what fraction of the meteorites would you expect to consist\nof irons, stony-irons, and stones? Is this consistent with the observed numbers of each? (Hint: You will\nneed to look up what percent of the volume of Earth is taken up by its core, mantle, and crust.)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 14 \u2022 Exercises 491\n23.

However, that does not stop it from being a\nfascinating object to study. From solar flares and coronal mass ejections, like the one seen coming from the Sun in the top right of\nthis image, the Sun is a highly dynamic body at the center of our solar system. This image combines two separate satellite pictures of\nthe Sun\u2014the inner one from the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the outer one from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory.\n(credit: modification of work by ESA/NASA)\nChapter Outline\n15.1The Structure and Composition of the Sun\n15.2The Solar Cycle\n15.3Solar Activity above the Photosphere\n15.4Space Weather\nThinking Ahead\n\u201cSpace weather\u201d may sound like a contradiction. How can there be weather in the vacuum of space? Yet space\nweather, which refers to changing conditions in space, is an active field of research and can have profound\neffects on Earth. We are all familiar with the ups and downs of weather on Earth, and how powerful storms can\nbe devastating for people and vegetation. Although we are separated from the Sun by a large distance as well\nas by the vacuum of space, we now understand that great outbursts on the Sun (solar storms, in effect) can\ncause changes in the atmosphere and magnetic field of Earth, sometimes even causing serious problems on\nthe ground. In this chapter, we will explore the nature of the Sun\u2019s outer layers, the changing conditions and\nactivity there, and the ways that the Sun affects Earth.\nBy studying the Sun, we also learn much that helps us understand stars in general. The Sun is, in astronomical\nterms, a rather ordinary star\u2014not unusually hot or cold, old or young, large or small. Indeed, we are lucky that\nthe Sun is typical. Just as studies of Earth help us understand observations of the more distant planets, so too\ndoes the Sun serve as a guide to astronomers in interpreting the messages contained in the light we receive\nfrom distant stars. As you will learn, the Sun is dynamic, continuously undergoing change, balancing the forces\nof nature to keep itself in equilibrium. In this chapter, we describe the components of the Sun, how it changes\nwith time, and how those changes affect Earth. 494 15 \u2022 The Sun: A Garden-Variety Star\n15.1 The Structure and Composition of the Sun\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain how the composition of the Sun differs from that of Earth\nDescribe the various layers of the Sun and their functions\nExplain what happens in the different parts of the Sun\u2019s atmosphere\nTheSun, like all stars, is an enormous ball of extremely hot, largely ionized gas, shining under its own power.\nAnd we do mean enormous. The Sun could fit 109 Earths side-by-side across its diameter, and it has enough\nvolume (takes up enough space) to hold about 1.3 million Earths.\nThe Sun does not have a solid surface or continents like Earth, nor does it have a solid core (Figure 15.2).\nHowever, it does have a lot of structure and can be discussed as a series of layers, not unlike an onion. In this\nsection, we describe the huge changes that occur in the Sun\u2019s extensive interior and atmosphere, and the\ndynamic and violent eruptions that occur daily in its outer layers.\nFigure15.2Earth and the Sun.Here, Earth is shown to scale with part of the Sun and a giant loop of hot gas erupting from its\nsurface. The inset shows the entire Sun, smaller. (credit: modification of work by SOHO/EIT/ESA)\nSome of the basic characteristics of the Sun are listed inTable 15.1.

As explained inRadiation and Spectra, we can use\na star\u2019sabsorption linespectrumto determine what elements are present. It turns out that the Sun contains\nthe same elements as Earth butnotin the same proportions. About 73% of the Sun\u2019s mass is hydrogen, and\nanother 25% is helium. All the other chemical elements (including those we know and love in our own bodies,\nsuch as carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen) make up only 2% of our star. The 10 most abundant gases in the Sun\u2019s\nvisible surface layer are listed inTable 15.2. Examine that table and notice that the composition of the Sun\u2019s\nouter layer is very different from Earth\u2019s crust, where we live. (In our planet\u2019s crust, the three most abundant\nelements are oxygen, silicon, and aluminum.) Although not like our planet\u2019s, the makeup of the Sun is quite\ntypical of stars in general. 496 15 \u2022 The Sun: A Garden-Variety Star\nThe Abundance of Elements in the Sun\nElement Percentage by Number of Atoms Percentage By Mass\nHydrogen 92.0 73.4\nHelium 7.8 25.0\nCarbon 0.02 0.20\nNitrogen 0.008 0.09\nOxygen 0.06 0.80\nNeon 0.01 0.16\nMagnesium 0.003 0.06\nSilicon 0.004 0.09\nSulfur 0.002 0.05\nIron 0.003 0.14\nTable15.2\nThe fact that our Sun and the stars all have similar compositions and are made up of mostly hydrogen and\nhelium was first shown in a brilliant thesis in 1925 by CeciliaPayne-Gaposchkin, the first woman to get a PhD in\nastronomy in the United States (Figure 15.3). However, the idea that the simplest light gases\u2014hydrogen and\nhelium\u2014were the most abundant elements in stars was so unexpected and so shocking that she was\npersuaded her analysis of the data must be wrong. At the time, she wrote, \u201cThe enormous abundance derived\nfor these elements in the stellar atmosphere is almost certainly not real.\u201d Even scientists sometimes find it\nhard to accept new ideas that do not agree with what everyone \u201cknows\u201d to be right.\nFigure15.3Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin (1900\u20131979).Her 1925 doctoral thesis laid the foundations for understanding the\ncomposition of the Sun and the stars. Yet, being a woman, she was not given a formal appointment at Harvard, where she worked,\nuntil 1938 and was not appointed a professor until 1956. (credit: Smithsonian Institution)\nBefore Payne-Gaposchkin\u2019s work, everyone assumed that the composition of the Sun and stars would be\nmuch like that of Earth. It was 3 years after her thesis that other studies proved beyond a doubt that the\nenormous abundance of hydrogen and helium in the Sun is indeed real. (And, as we will see, the composition\nof the Sun and the stars is much more typical of the makeup of the universe than the odd concentration of\nAccess for free at openstax.org 15.1 \u2022 The Structure and Composition of the Sun 497\nheavier elements that characterizes our planet.)\nMost of the elements found in the Sun are in the form of atoms, with a small number of molecules, all in the\nform of gases: the Sun is so hot that no matter can survive as a liquid or a solid. In fact, the Sun is so hot that\nmany of the atoms in it areionized, that is, stripped of one or more of their electrons. This removal of\nelectrons from their atoms means that there is a large quantity of free electrons and positively charged ions in\nthe Sun, making it an electrically charged environment\u2014quite different from the neutral one in which you are\nreading this text. (Scientists call such a hot ionized gas aplasma.)\nIn the nineteenth century, scientists observed a spectral line at 530.3 nanometers in the Sun\u2019s outer\natmosphere, called the corona (a layer we will discuss in a minute.) This line had never been seen before, and\nso it was assumed that this line was the result of a new element found in the corona, quickly named coronium.\nIt was not until 60 years later that astronomers discovered that this emission was in fact due to highly ionized\niron\u2014iron with 13 of its electrons stripped off. This is how we first discovered that the Sun\u2019s atmosphere had a\ntemperature of more than a million degrees.\nThe Layers of the Sun beneath the Visible Surface\nFigure 15.4shows what the Sun would look like if we could see all parts of it from the center to its outer\natmosphere; the terms in the figure will become familiar to you as you read on.\nFigure15.4Parts of the Sun.This illustration shows the different parts of the Sun, from the hot core where the energy is generated\nthrough regions where energy is transported outward, first by radiation, then by convection, and then out through the solar\natmosphere. The parts of the atmosphere are also labeled the photosphere, chromosphere, and corona. Some typical features in the\natmosphere are shown, such as coronal holes and prominences. (credit: modification of work by NASA/Goddard)\nThe Sun\u2019s layers are different from each other, and each plays a part in producing the energy that the Sun\nultimately emits. We will begin with the core and work our way out through the layers. The Sun\u2019scoreis\nextremely dense and is the source of all of its energy. Inside the core, nuclear energy is being released (in\nways we will discuss inThe Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse). The core is approximately 20% of the size of the solar\ninterior and is thought to have a temperature of approximately 15 million K, making it the hottest part of the\nSun.\nAbove the core is a region known as theradiative zone\u2014named for the primary mode of transporting energy\nacross it. This region starts at about 25% of the distance to the solar surface and extends up to about 70% of 498 15 \u2022 The Sun: A Garden-Variety Star\nthe way to the surface. The light generated in the core is transported through theradiative zonevery slowly,\nsince the high density of matter in this region means a photon cannot travel too far without encountering a\nparticle, causing it to change direction and lose some energy.\nTheconvective zoneis the outermost layer of the solar interior. It is a thick layer approximately 200,000\nkilometers deep that transports energy from the edge of the radiative zone to the surface through giant\nconvection cells, similar to a pot of boiling oatmeal. The plasma at the bottom of theconvective zoneis\nextremely hot, and it bubbles to the surface where it loses its heat to space. Once the plasma cools, it sinks\nback to the bottom of the convective zone.\nNow that we have given a quick overview of the structure of the whole Sun, in this section, we will embark on a\njourney through the visible layers of the Sun, beginning with the photosphere\u2014the visible surface.\nThe Solar Photosphere\nEarth\u2019s air is generally transparent. But on a smoggy day in many cities, it can become opaque, which prevents\nus from seeing through it past a certain point. Something similar happens in the Sun. Its outer atmosphere is\ntransparent, allowing us to look a short distance through it. But when we try to look through the atmosphere\ndeeper into the Sun, our view is blocked. Thephotosphereis the layer where the Sun becomes opaque and\nmarks the boundary past which we cannot see (Figure 15.5).\nFigure15.5Solar Photosphere plus Sunspots.This photograph shows the photosphere\u2014the visible surface of the Sun. Also shown\nis an enlarged image of a group of sunspots; the size of Earth is shown for comparison. Sunspots appear darker because they are\ncooler than their surroundings. The typical temperature at the center of a large sunspot is about 3800 K, whereas the photosphere\nhas a temperature of about 5800 K. (credit: modification of work by NASA/SDO)\nAs we saw, the energy that emerges from the photosphere was originally generated deep inside the Sun\n(more on this inThe Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse). This energy is in the form of photons, which make their way\nslowly toward the solar surface. Outside the Sun, we can observeonlythose photons that are emitted into the\nsolar photosphere, where the density of atoms is sufficiently low and the photons can finally escape from the\nSun without colliding with another atom or ion.\nAs an analogy, imagine that you are attending a big campus rally and have found a prime spot near the center\nof the action. Your friend arrives late and calls you on your cell phone to ask you to join her at the edge of the\ncrowd. You decide that friendship is worth more than a prime spot, and so you work your way out through the\ndense crowd to meet her. You can move only a short distance before bumping into someone, changing\ndirection, and trying again, making your way slowly to the outside edge of the crowd. All this while, your\nefforts are not visible to your waiting friend at the edge. Your friend can\u2019t see you until you get very close to\nthe edge because of all the bodies in the way. So too photons making their way through the Sun are constantly\nbumping into atoms, changing direction, working their way slowly outward, and becoming visible only when\nthey reach the atmosphere of the Sun where the density of atoms is too low to block their outward progress.\nAstronomers have found that the solar atmosphere changes from almost perfectly transparent to almost\ncompletely opaque in a distance of just over 400 kilometers; it is this thin region that we call thephotosphere,\nAccess for free at openstax.org 15.1 \u2022 The Structure and Composition of the Sun 499\na word that comes from the Greek for \u201clight sphere.\u201d When astronomers speak of the \u201cdiameter\u201d of the Sun,\nthey mean the size of the region surrounded by the photosphere.\nThe photosphere looks sharp only from a distance. If you were falling into the Sun, you would not feel any\nsurface but would just sense a gradual increase in the density of the gas surrounding you. It is much the same\nas falling through a cloud while skydiving. From far away, the cloud looks as if it has a sharp surface, but you\ndo not feel a surface as you fall into it. (One big difference between these two scenarios, however, is\ntemperature. The Sun is so hot that you would be vaporized long before you reached the photosphere.\nSkydiving in Earth\u2019s atmosphere is much safer.)\nWe might note that the atmosphere of the Sun is not a very dense layer compared to the air in the room\nwhere you are reading this text. At a typical point in the photosphere, the pressure is less than 10% of Earth\u2019s\npressure at sea level, and the density is about one ten-thousandth of Earth\u2019s atmospheric density at sea level.\nObservations with telescopes show that the photosphere has a mottled appearance, resembling grains of rice\nspilled on a dark tablecloth or a pot of boiling oatmeal. This structure of the photosphere is calledgranulation\n(seeFigure 15.6). Granules, which are typically 700 to 1000 kilometers in diameter (about the width of Texas),\nappear as bright areas surrounded by narrow, darker (cooler) regions. The lifetime of an individual granule is\nonly 5 to 10 minutes. Even larger are supergranules, which are about 35,000 kilometers across (about the size\nof two Earths) and last about 24 hours.\nFigure15.6Granulation Pattern.The surface markings of the convection cells create a granulation pattern on this dramatic image\n(left) taken from the Japanese Hinode spacecraft. You can see the same pattern when you heat up miso soup. The right image shows\nan irregular-shaped sunspot and granules on the Sun\u2019s surface, seen with the Swedish Solar Telescope on August 22, 2003. (credit\nleft: modification of work by Hinode JAXA/NASA/PPARC; credit right: ISP/SST/Oddbjorn Engvold, Jun Elin Wiik, Luc Rouppe van der\nVoort)\nThe motions of the granules can be studied by examining the Doppler shifts in the spectra of gases just above\nthem (seeThe Doppler Effect). The bright granules are columns of hotter gases rising at speeds of 2 to 3\nkilometers per second from below the photosphere. As this rising gas reaches the photosphere, it spreads out,\ncools, and sinks down again into the darker regions between the granules. Measurements show that the\ncenters of the granules are hotter than the intergranular regions by 50 to 100 K.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nSee the \u201cboiling\u201d action of granulation in this30-second time-lapse video(https://openstax.org/l/\n30SolarGran)from the Swedish Institute for Solar Physics. 500 15 \u2022 The Sun: A Garden-Variety Star\nThe Chromosphere\nThe Sun\u2019s outer gases extend far beyond the photosphere (Figure 15.7). Because they are transparent to most\nvisible radiation and emit only a small amount of light, these outer layers are difficult to observe. The region of\nthe Sun\u2019s atmosphere that lies immediately above the photosphere is called thechromosphere. Until this\ncentury, the chromosphere was visible only when the photosphere was concealed by the Moon during a total\nsolar eclipse (see the chapter onEarth, Moon, and Sky). In the seventeenth century, several observers\ndescribed what appeared to them as a narrow red \u201cstreak\u201d or \u201cfringe\u201d around the edge of the Moon during a\nbrief instant after the Sun\u2019s photosphere had been covered. The namechromosphere, from the Greek for\n\u201ccolored sphere,\u201d was given to this red streak.\nFigure15.7The Sun\u2019s Atmosphere.Composite image showing the three components of the solar atmosphere: the photosphere or\nsurface of the Sun taken in ordinary light; the chromosphere, imaged in the light of the strong red spectral line of hydrogen (H-\nalpha); and the corona as seen with X-rays. (credit: modification of work by NASA)\nObservations made during eclipses show that the chromosphere is about 2000 to 3000 kilometers thick, and its\nspectrum consists of bright emission lines, indicating that this layer is composed of hot gases emitting light at\ndiscrete wavelengths. The reddish color of the chromosphere arises from one of the strongest emission lines\nin the visible part of its spectrum\u2014the bright red line caused by hydrogen, the element that, as we have\nalready seen, dominates the composition of the Sun.\nIn 1868, observations of the chromospheric spectrum revealed a yellow emission line that did not correspond\nto any previously known element on Earth. Scientists quickly realized they had found a new element and\nnamed ithelium(afterhelios, the Greek word for \u201cSun\u201d). It took until 1895 for helium to be discovered on our\nplanet. Today, students are probably most familiar with it as the light gas used to inflate balloons, although it\nturns out to be the second-most abundant element in the universe.\nThe temperature of the chromosphere is about 10,000 K. This means that the chromosphere is hotter than the\nphotosphere, which should seem surprising. In all the situations we are familiar with, temperatures fall as one\nmoves away from the source of heat, and the chromosphere is farther from the center of the Sun than the\nphotosphere is.\nThe Transition Region\nThe increase in temperature does not stop with the chromosphere. Above it is a region in the solar\natmosphere where the temperature changes from 10,000 K (typical of the chromosphere) to nearly a million\ndegrees. The hottest part of the solar atmosphere, which has a temperature of a million degrees or more, is\ncalled thecorona. Appropriately, the part of the Sun where the rapid temperature rise occurs is called the\ntransition region. It is probably only a few tens of kilometers thick.Figure 15.8summarizes how the\ntemperature of the solar atmosphere changes from the photosphere outward.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 15.1 \u2022 The Structure and Composition of the Sun 501\nFigure15.8Temperatures in the Solar Atmosphere.On this graph, temperature is shown increasing upward, and height above the\nphotosphere is shown increasing to the right. Note the very rapid increase in temperature over a very short distance in the transition\nregion between the chromosphere and the corona.\nIn 2013, NASA launched theInterface Region Imaging Spectrograph(IRIS) to study the transition region to\nunderstand better how and why this sharp temperature increase occurs. IRIS is the first space mission that is\nable to obtain high spatial resolution images of the different features produced over this wide temperature\nrange and to see how they change with time and location (Figure 15.9).\nFigure15.9Portion of the Transition Region.This image shows a giant ribbon of relatively cool gas threading through the lower\nportion of the hot corona. This ribbon (the technical term is filament) is made up of many individual threads. Time-lapse movies of\nthis filament showed that it gradually heated as it moved through the corona. Scientists study events like this in order to try to\nunderstand what heats the chromosphere and corona to high temperatures. The \u201cwhiskers\u201d at the edge of the Sun are spicules, jets\nof gas that shoot material up from the Sun\u2019s surface and disappear after only a few minutes. This single image gives a hint of just\nhow complicated it is to construct a model of the all the different structures and heating mechanisms in the solar atmosphere.\n(credit: JAXA/NASA/Hinode)\nFigure 15.4and the red graph inFigure 15.8make the Sun seem rather like an onion, with smooth spherical\nshells, each one with a different temperature. For a long time, astronomers did indeed think of the Sun this 502 15 \u2022 The Sun: A Garden-Variety Star\nway. However, we now know that while this idea of layers\u2014photosphere, chromosphere, transition region,\ncorona\u2014describes the big picture fairly well, the Sun\u2019s atmosphere is really more complicated, with hot and\ncool regions intermixed. For example, clouds of carbon monoxide gas with temperatures colder than 4000 K\nhave now been found at the same height above the photosphere as the much hotter gas of the\nchromosphere.\nThe Corona\nThe outermost part of the Sun\u2019s atmosphere is called thecorona. Like the chromosphere, thecoronawas first\nobserved during total eclipses (Figure 15.10). Unlike the chromosphere, the corona has been known for many\ncenturies: it was referred to by the Roman historian Plutarch and was discussed in some detail by Kepler.\nThe corona extends millions of kilometers above the photosphere and emits about half as much light as the\nfull moon. The reason we don\u2019t see this light until an eclipse occurs is the overpowering brilliance of the\nphotosphere. Just as bright city lights make it difficult to see faint starlight, so too does the intense light from\nthe photosphere hide the faint light from the corona. While the best time to see the corona from Earth is\nduring a total solar eclipse, it can be observed easily from orbiting spacecraft. Its brighter parts can now be\nphotographed with a special instrument\u2014a coronagraph\u2014that removes the Sun\u2019s glare from the image with\nan occulting disk (a circular piece of material held so it is just in front of the Sun).\nFigure15.10Coronagraph.This image of the Sun was taken March 2, 2016. The larger dark circle in the center is the disk the blocks\nthe Sun\u2019s glare, allowing us to see the corona. The smaller inner circle is where the Sun would be if it were visible in this image.\n(credit: modification of work by NASA/SOHO)\nStudies of its spectrum show the corona to be very low in density. At the bottom of the corona, there are only\nabout 109atoms per cubic centimeter, compared with about 1016atoms per cubic centimeter in the upper\nphotosphere and 1019molecules per cubic centimeter at sea level in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The corona thins out\nvery rapidly at greater heights, where it corresponds to a high vacuum by Earth laboratory standards. The\ncorona extends so far into space\u2014far past Earth\u2014that here on our planet, we are technically living in the Sun\u2019s\natmosphere.\nThe Solar Wind\nOne of the most remarkable discoveries about the Sun\u2019s atmosphere is that it produces a stream of charged\nparticles (mainly protons and electrons) that we call thesolar wind. These particles flow outward from the Sun\ninto the solar system at a speed of about 400 kilometers per second (almost 1 million miles per hour)! The\nsolar wind exists because the gases in the corona are so hot and moving so rapidly that they cannot be held\nback by solar gravity. (This wind was actually discovered by its effects on the charged tails of comets; in a\nsense, we can see the comet tails blow in the solar breeze the way wind socks at an airport or curtains in an\nopen window flutter on Earth.)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 15.1 \u2022 The Structure and Composition of the Sun 503\nAlthough the solar wind material is very, very rarified (i.e.,extremelylow density), the Sun has an enormous\nsurface area. Astronomers estimate that the Sun is losing about 1\u20132 million tons of material each second\nthrough this wind. Although this sounds like a lot, it\u2019s so trivial compared to the enormous mass of the Sun\nthat it can be neglected as we study the Sun.\nFrom where in the Sun does the solar wind emerge? In visible photographs, the solar corona appears fairly\nuniform and smooth. X-ray and extreme ultraviolet pictures, however, show that the corona has loops, plumes,\nand both bright and dark regions. Large dark regions of the corona that are relatively cool and quiet are called\ncoronal holes(Figure 15.11). In these regions, magnetic field lines stretch far out into space away from the\nSun, rather than looping back to the surface. The solar wind comes predominantly from coronal holes, where\ngas can stream away from the Sun into space unhindered by magnetic fields. Hot coronal gas, on the other\nhand, is present mainly where magnetic fields have trapped and concentrated it.\nFigure15.11Coronal Hole. The dark area visible near the Sun\u2019s south pole on this Solar Dynamics Observer spacecraft image is a\ncoronal hole. (credit: modification of work by NASA/SDO)\nAt the surface of Earth, we are protected to some degree from the solar wind by our atmosphere and Earth\u2019s\nmagnetic field (seeEarth as a Planet). However, the magnetic field lines come into Earth at the north and\nsouth magnetic poles. Here, charged particles accelerated by the solar wind can follow the field down into our\natmosphere. As the particles strike molecules of air, they cause them to glow, producing beautiful curtains of\nlight called theauroras, or the northern and southern lights (Figure 15.12). 504 15 \u2022 The Sun: A Garden-Variety Star\nFigure15.12Aurora.The colorful glow in the sky results from charged particles in a solar wind interacting with Earth\u2019s magnetic\nfields.

We now\nknow that the Sun is in a perpetual state of change: its surface is a seething, bubbling cauldron of hot gas.\nAreas that are darker and cooler than the rest of the surface come and go. Vast plumes of gas erupt into the\nchromosphere and corona. Occasionally, there are even giant explosions on the Sun that send enormous\nstreamers of charged particles and energy hurtling toward Earth. When they arrive, these can cause power\noutages and other serious effects on our planet.\nSunspots\nThe first evidence that the Sun changes came from studies ofsunspots, which are large, dark features seen on\nthe surface of the Sun caused by increased magnetic activity. They look darker because the spots are typically\nat a temperature of about 3800 K, whereas the bright regions that surround them are at about 5800 K (Figure\n15.13). Occasionally, these spots are large enough to be visible to the unaided eye, and we have records going\nback over a thousand years from observers who noticed them when haze or mist reduced the Sun\u2019s intensity.\n(We emphasize what your parents have surely told you: looking at the Sun for even a brief time can cause\npermanent eye damage. This is the one area of astronomy where we don\u2019t encourage you to do your own\nobserving without getting careful instructions or filters from your instructor.)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 15.2 \u2022 The Solar Cycle 505\nFigure15.13Sunspots.a) Image of sunspots, cooler and thus darker regions on the Sun, taken in July 2012. You can see the dark,\ncentral region of each sunspot (called the umbra) surrounded by a less dark region (the penumbra). The largest spot shown here is\nabout 11 Earths wide. b) The new Daniel Inouye Solar Telescope took the most detailed image of a sunspot ever recorded in January\n2020. A map of the United States is shown to scale. Although sunspots appear dark when seen next to the hotter gases of the\nphotosphere, an average sunspot, cut out of the solar surface and left standing in the night sky, would be about as bright as the full\nmoon. The mottled appearance of the Sun\u2019s surface is granulation. (credit a: modification of work by NASA Goddard Space Flight\nCenter, Alan Friedman; credit b: modification of work by NSO/AURA/NSF)\nWhile we understand that sunspots look darker because they are cooler, they are nevertheless hotter than the\nsurfaces of many stars. If they could be removed from the Sun, they would shine brightly. They appear dark\nonly in contrast with the hotter, brighter photosphere around them.\nIndividual sunspots come and go, with lifetimes that range from a few hours to a few months. If a spot lasts\nand develops, it usually consists of two parts: an inner darker core, theumbra, and a surrounding less dark\nregion, thepenumbra. Many spots become much larger than Earth, and a few, like the largest one shown in\nFigure 15.13, have reached diameters over 140,000 kilometers. Frequently, spots occur in groups of 2 to 20 or\nmore. The largest groups are very complex and may have over 100 spots. Like storms on Earth, sunspots are\nnot fixed in position, but they drift slowly compared with the Sun\u2019s rotation.\nBy recording the apparent motions of the sunspots as the turning Sun carried them across its disk (Figure\n15.14),Galileo, in 1612, demonstrated that the Sun rotates on its axis with a rotation period of approximately 1\nmonth. Our star turns in a west-to-east direction, like the orbital motions of the planets. The Sun, however, is a\ngas and does not have to rotate rigidly, the way a solid body like Earth does. Modern observations show that\nthe speed of rotation of the Sun varies according to latitude, that is, it\u2019s different as you go north or south of\nthe Sun\u2019s equator. The rotation period is about 25 days at the equator, 28 days at latitude 40\u00b0, and 36 days at\nlatitude 80\u00b0. We call this behaviordifferential rotation. 506 15 \u2022 The Sun: A Garden-Variety Star\nFigure15.14Sunspots Rotate Across Sun\u2019s Surface.This sequence of photographs of the Sun\u2019s surface tracks the movement of\nsunspots across the visible hemisphere of the Sun. On March 30, 2001, this group of sunspots extended across an area about 13\ntimes the diameter of Earth. This region produced many flares and coronal mass ejections. (credit: modification of work by SOHO/\nNASA/ESA)\nThe Sunspot Cycle\nBetween 1826 and 1850, HeinrichSchwabe, a German pharmacist and amateur astronomer, kept daily records\nof the number of sunspots. What he was really looking for was a planet inside the orbit of Mercury, which he\nhoped to find by observing its dark silhouette as it passed between the Sun and Earth. He failed to find the\nhoped-for planet, but his diligence paid off with an even-more important discovery: thesunspot cycle. He\nfound that the number of sunspots varied systematically, in cycles about a decade long.\nWhat Schwabe observed was that, although individual spots are short lived, the total number visible on the\nSun at any one time was likely to be very much greater at certain times\u2014the periods ofsunspot\nmaximum\u2014than at other times\u2014the periods ofsunspot minimum. We now know that sunspot maxima occur\nat anaverageinterval of 11 years, but the intervals between successive maxima have ranged from as short as\n9 years to as long as 14 years. Duringsunspot maxima, more than 100 spots can often be seen at once. Even\nthen, less than one-half of one percent of the Sun\u2019s surface is covered by spots (Figure 15.22). Duringsunspot\nminima, sometimes no spots are visible. The Sun\u2019s activity reached its most recent maximum in 2014.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch this briefvideo(https://openstax.org/l/30SolarCyc)from NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center that\nexplains the sunspot cycle.\nExplore thenumber of sunspots(https://openstax.org/l/30numsunspots)measured each year going back\nto 1707. Point your cursor at any year, and the diagram tells you the number of sunspots.\nMagnetism and the Solar Cycle\nNow that we have discussed the Sun\u2019s activity cycle, you might be asking, \u201cWhy does the Sun change in such a\nregular way?\u201d Astronomers now understand that it is the Sun\u2019s changing magnetic field that drives solar\nAccess for free at openstax.org 15.2 \u2022 The Solar Cycle 507\nactivity.\nThe solar magnetic field is measured using a property of atoms called theZeeman effect. Recall from\nRadiation and Spectrathat an atom has many energy levels and that spectral lines are formed when electrons\nshift from one level to another. If each energy level is precisely defined, then the difference between them is\nalso quite precise. As an electron changes levels, the result is a sharp, narrowspectral line(either an\nabsorption or emission line, depending on whether the electron\u2019s energy increases or decreases in the\ntransition).\nIn the presence of a strong magnetic field, however, each energy level is separated into several levels very\nclose to one another. The separation of the levels is proportional to the strength of the field. As a result,\nspectral lines formed in the presence of a magnetic field are not single lines but a series of very closely spaced\nlines corresponding to the subdivisions of the atomic energy levels. This splitting of lines in the presence of a\nmagnetic field is what we call theZeeman effect(after the Dutch scientist who first discovered it in 1896).\nMeasurements of the Zeeman effect in the spectra of the light from sunspot regions show them to have\nstrong magnetic fields (Figure 15.15). Bear in mind that magnets always have a north pole and a south pole.\nWhenever sunspots are observed in pairs, or in groups containing two principal spots, one of the spots usually\nhas the magnetic polarity of a north-seeking magnetic pole and the other has the opposite polarity. Moreover,\nduring a given cycle, the leading spots of pairs (or leading principle spots of groups) in the Northern\nHemisphere all tend to have the same polarity, whereas those in the Southern Hemisphere all tend to have the\nopposite polarity.\nFigure15.15Zeeman Effect.These photographs show how magnetic fields in sunspots are measured by means of theZeeman\neffect. (left) The vertical black line indicates the position of the spectrograph slit through which light is passed to obtain the spectrum\nin (right). (credit: modification of work by NSO/AURA/NSF)\nDuring the nextsunspot cycle, however, the polarity of the leading spots is reversed in each hemisphere. For\nexample, if during one cycle, the leading spots in the Northern Hemisphere all had the polarity of a north-\nseeking pole, then the leading spots in the Southern Hemisphere would have the polarity of a south-seeking\npole. During the next cycle, the leading spots in the Northern Hemisphere would have south-seeking polarity,\nwhereas those in the Southern Hemisphere would have north-seeking polarity. Therefore, strictly speaking,\nthe sunspot cycle does not repeat itself in regard to magnetic polarity until two 11-year cycles have passed. A\nvisual representation of the Sun\u2019s magnetic fields, called amagnetogram, can be used to see the relationship 508 15 \u2022 The Sun: A Garden-Variety Star\nbetween sunspots and the Sun\u2019s magnetic field (Figure 15.16).\nFigure15.16Magnetogram and Solar Cycle.In the image on the left, called amagnetogram, we see the magnetic polarity of\nsunspots. The black areas are where the magnetism is pointing toward the Sun\u2019s core, whereas the white regions are where it is\npointing away from the core, toward us. This dramatic sequence on the right shows the activity cycle of the Sun. The 10 maps of the\nmagnetic field on the surface of the Sun span a period of 7.5 years. The two magnetic polarities (N and S) of the magnetic field are\nshown against a blue disk as dark blue to black (N) and as light blue to white (S). The earliest image, taken on January 8, 1992, is at\nthe lower left and was taken just aftersolar maximum. Each image, from left to right around the arc, was taken one-half to one year\nafter the preceding one. The last image was taken on July 25, 1999, as the Sun was approaching the next solar maximum. Note a few\nstriking patterns in the magnetic maps: the direction from white to black polarity in the Southern Hemisphere is opposite from that\nin the Northern Hemisphere. (credit left: modification of work by NASA/SDO; credit right: modification of work by NASA/SOHO)\nWhy is the Sun such a strong and complicated magnet? Astronomers have found that it is the Sun\u2019sdynamo\nthat generates the magnetic field. A dynamo is a machine that converts kinetic energy (i.e., the energy of\nmotion) into electricity. On Earth, dynamos are found in power plants where, for example, the energy from\nwind or flowing water is used to cause turbines to rotate. In the Sun, the source of kinetic energy is the\nchurning of turbulent layers of ionized gas within the Sun\u2019s interior that we mentioned earlier. These generate\nelectric currents\u2014moving electrons\u2014which in turn generate magnetic fields.\nMost solar researchers agree that thesolar dynamois located in the convection zone or in the interface layer\nbetween the convection zone and the radiative zone below it. As the magnetic fields from the Sun\u2019s dynamo\ninteract, they break, reconnect, and rise through the Sun\u2019s surface.\nWe should say that, although we have good observations that show ushowthe Sun changes during eachsolar\ncycle, it is still very difficult to build physical models of something as complicated as the Sun that can account\nsatisfactorily forwhyit changes. Researchers have not yet developed a generally accepted model that\ndescribes in detail the physical processes that control the solar cycle. Calculations do show that differential\nrotation (the idea that the Sun rotates at different rates at different latitudes) and convection just below the\nsolar surface can twist and distort the magnetic fields. This causes them to grow and then decay, regenerating\nwith opposite polarity approximately every 11 years. The calculations also show that as the fields grow\nstronger near solar maximum, they flow from the interior of the Sun toward its surface in the form of loops.\nWhen a large loop emerges from the solar surface, it creates regions of sunspot activity (Figure 15.17).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 15.3 \u2022 Solar Activity above the Photosphere 509\nFigure15.17Magnetic Field Lines Wind Up.Because the Sun spins faster at the equator than near the poles, the magnetic fields in\nthe Sun tend to wind up as shown, and after a while make loops. This is an idealized diagram; the real situation is much more\ncomplex.\nThis idea of magnetic loops offers a natural explanation of why the leading and trailing sunspots in an active\nregion have opposite polarity. The leading sunspot coincides with one end of the loop and the trailing spot\nwith the other end. Magnetic fields also hold the key to explaining why sunspots are cooler and darker than\nthe regions without strong magnetic fields. The forces produced by the magnetic field resist the motions of\nthe bubbling columns of rising hot gases. Since these columns carry most of the heat from inside the Sun to\nthe surface by means of convection, and strong magnetic fields inhibit this convection, the surface of the Sun\nis allowed to cool. As a result, these regions are seen as darker, cooler sunspots.\nBeyond this general picture, researchers are still trying to determine why the magnetic fields are as large as\nthey are, why the polarity of the field in each hemisphere flips from one cycle to the next, why the length of the\nsolar cycle can vary from one cycle to the next, and why events like the Maunder Minimum occur.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nIn thisvideo(https://openstax.org/l/30MagField)solar scientist Holly Gilbert discusses the Sun\u2019s magnetic\nfield.\n15.3 Solar Activity above the Photosphere\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the various ways in which the solar activity cycle manifests itself, including flares, coronal mass\nejections, prominences, and plages\nSunspots are not the only features that vary during asolar cycle. There are dramatic changes in the\nchromosphere and corona as well. To see what happens in the chromosphere, we must observe the emission\nlines from elements such as hydrogen and calcium, which emit useful spectral lines at the temperatures in that\nlayer. The hot corona, on the other hand, can be studied by observations of X-rays and of extreme ultraviolet\nand other wavelengths at high energies.\nPlages and Prominences\nAs we saw, emission lines of hydrogen and calcium are produced in the hot gases of the chromosphere. 510 15 \u2022 The Sun: A Garden-Variety Star\nAstronomers routinely photograph theSunthrough filters that transmit light only at the wavelengths that\ncorrespond to these emission lines. Pictures taken through these special filters show bright \u201cclouds\u201d in the\nchromosphere around sunspots; these bright regions are known asplages(Figure 15.18). These are regions\nwithin the chromosphere that have higher temperature and density than their surroundings. The plages\nactually contain all of the elements in the Sun, not just hydrogen and calcium. It just happens that the spectral\nlines of hydrogen and calcium produced by these clouds are bright and easy to observe.\nFigure15.18Plages on the Sun.This image of the Sun was taken with a filter that transmits only the light of the spectral line\nproduced by singly ionized calcium. The bright cloud-like regions are the plages. (credit: modification of work by NASA)\nMoving higher into the Sun\u2019s atmosphere, we come to the spectacular phenomena calledprominences\n(Figure 15.19), which usually originate near sunspots. Eclipse observers often see prominences as red features\nrising above the eclipsed Sun and reaching high into the corona. Some, thequiescentprominences, are\ngraceful loops of plasma (ionized gas) that can remain nearly stable for many hours or even days. The\nrelatively rareeruptiveprominences appear to send matter upward into the corona at high speeds, and the\nmost activesurgeprominences may move as fast as 1300 kilometers per second (almost 3 million miles per\nhour). Some eruptive prominences have reached heights of more than 1 million kilometers above the\nphotosphere; Earth would be completely lost inside one of those awesome displays (Figure 15.19).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 15.3 \u2022 Solar Activity above the Photosphere 511\nFigure15.19Prominences.(a) This image of an eruptive prominence was taken in the light of singly ionized helium in the extreme\nultraviolet part of the spectrum. The prominence is a particularly large one. An image of Earth is shown at the same scale for\ncomparison. (b) A prominence is a huge cloud of relatively cool (about 60,000 K in this case), fairly dense gas suspended in the much\nhotter corona. These pictures, taken in ultraviolet, are color coded so that white corresponds to the hottest temperatures and dark\nred to cooler ones. The four images were taken, moving clockwise from the upper left, on May 15, 2001; March 28, 2000; January 18,\n2000; and February 2, 2001. (credit a: modification of work by NASA/SOHO; credit b: modification of work by NASA/SDO)\nFlares and Coronal Mass Ejections\nThe most violent event on the surface of the Sun is a rapid eruption called asolar flare(Figure 15.20). A typical\nflare lasts for 5 to 10 minutes and releases a total amount of energy equivalent to that of perhaps a million\nhydrogen bombs. The largest flares last for several hours and emit enough energy to power the entire United\nStates at its current rate of electrical consumption for 100,000 years. Near sunspot maximum, small flares\noccur several times per day, and major ones may occur every few weeks.\nFigure15.20Solar Flare.The bright white area seen on the right side of the Sun in this image from the Solar Dynamics Observer\nspacecraft is a solar flare that was observed on June 25, 2015. (credit: NASA/SDO)\nFlares, like the one shown inFigure 15.21, are often observed in the red light of hydrogen, but the visible\nemission is only a tiny fraction of the energy released when a solar flare explodes. At the moment of the 512 15 \u2022 The Sun: A Garden-Variety Star\nexplosion, the matter associated with the flare is heated to temperatures as high as 10 million K. At such high\ntemperatures, a flood of X-ray and ultraviolet radiation is emitted.\nFlares seem to occur when magnetic fields pointing in opposite directions release energy by interacting with\nand destroying each other\u2014much as a stretched rubber band releases energy when it breaks.\nWhat is different about flares is that their magnetic interactions cover a large volume in the solar corona and\nrelease a tremendous amount of electromagnetic radiation. In some cases, immense quantities of coronal\nmaterial\u2014mainly protons and electrons\u2014may also be ejected at high speeds (500\u20131000 kilometers per\nsecond) into interplanetary space. Such acoronal mass ejection (CME)can affect Earth in a number of ways\n(which we will discuss in the section on space weather).\nFigure15.21Flare and Coronal Mass Ejection.This sequence of four images shows the evolution over time of a giant eruption on\nthe Sun.

The white circle in (c) and (d) shows the diameter of the solar\nphotosphere.

That is,\nthey all tend to have similar longitudes and latitudes, but they are located at different heights in the\natmosphere. Because they all occur together, they vary with the sunspot cycle.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 15.4 \u2022 Space Weather 513\nFigure15.22Solar Cycle.This dramatic sequence of images taken from the SOHO satellite over a period of 11 years shows how\nactive regions change during thesolar cycle. The images were taken in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum and show that active\nregions on the Sun increase and decrease during the cycle. Sunspots are located in the cooler photosphere, beneath the hot gases\nshown in this image, and vary in phase with the emission from these hot gases\u2014more sunspots and more emission from hot gases\noccur together. (credit: modification of work by ESA/NASA/SOHO)\nFor example, flares are more likely to occur near sunspot maximum, and the corona is much more\nconspicuous at that time (seeFigure 15.22). A place on the Sun where a number of these phenomena are seen\nis called anactive region(Figure 15.23). As you might deduce from our earlier discussion, active regions are\nalways associated with strong magnetic fields.\nFigure15.23Solar Active Region Observed at Different Heights in the Sun\u2019s Atmosphere.These four images of a solar flare on\nOctober 22, 2012, show from the left: light from the Sun at a wavelength of 171 angstroms, which shows the structure of loops of\nsolar material in the corona; ultraviolet at 304 angstroms, which shows light from the region of the Sun\u2019s atmosphere where flares\noriginate; light at 335 angstroms, which highlights radiation from active regions in the corona; a magnetogram, which shows\nmagnetically active regions on the Sun. Note how these different types of activity all occur above a sunspot region with a strong\nmagnetic field. (credit: modification of work by NASA/SDO/Goddard)\n15.4 Space Weather\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain what space weather is and how it affects Earth\nIn the previous sections, we have seen that some of the particles coming off theSun\u2014either steadily as in the\nsolar wind or in great bursts like CMEs\u2014will reach Earth and itsmagnetosphere(the zone of magnetic 514 15 \u2022 The Sun: A Garden-Variety Star\ninfluence that surrounds our planet). As if scientists did not have enough trouble trying to predict weather on\nEarth, this means that they are now facing the challenge of predicting the effects of solar storms on Earth. This\nfield of research is calledspace weather; when that weather turns stormy, our technology turns out to be at\nrisk.\nWith thousands of satellites in orbit, astronauts taking up long-term residence in the International Space\nStation, millions of people using cell phones, GPS, and wireless communication, and nearly everyone relying on\nthe availability of dependable electrical power, governments are now making major investments in trying to\nlearn how to predict when solar storms will occur and how strongly they will affect Earth.\nSome History\nWhat we now study asspace weatherwas first recognized (though not yet understood) in 1859, in what is now\nknown as theCarrington Event. In early September of that year, two amateur astronomers, including Richard\nCarrington in England, independently observed a solar flare. This was followed a day or two later by a\nsignificant solar storm reaching the region of Earth\u2019s magnetic field, which was soon overloaded with charged\nparticles (seeEarth as a Planet).\nAs a result, aurora activity was intense and the northern lights were visible well beyond their normal locations\nnear the poles\u2014as far south as Hawaii and the Caribbean. The glowing lights in the sky were so intense that\nsome people reported getting up in the middle of the night, thinking it must be daylight.\nThe 1859 solar storm happened at a time when a new technology was beginning to tie people in the United\nStates and some other countries together: the telegraph system. This was a machine and network for sending\nmessages in code through overhead electrical wires (a bit like a very early version of the internet). The charged\nparticles that overwhelmed Earth\u2019s magnetic field descended toward our planet\u2019s surface and affected the\nwires of the telegraph system. Sparks were seen coming out of exposed wires and out of the telegraph\nmachines in the system\u2019s offices.\nThe observation of the bright flare that preceded these effects on Earth led to scientific speculation that a\nconnection existed between solar activity and impacts on Earth\u2014this was the beginning of our understanding\nof what today we call space weather.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch NASA scientistsanswer some questions(https://openstax.org/l/30SpcWeath)about space weather,\nanddiscuss(https://openstax.org/l/30SpcWeath2)some effects it can have in space and on Earth.\nSources of Space Weather\nThree solar phenomena\u2014coronal holes, solar flares, and CMEs\u2014account for most of the space weather we\nexperience. Coronal holes allow the solar wind to flow freely away from the Sun, unhindered by solar magnetic\nfields. When the solar wind reaches Earth, as we saw, it causes Earth\u2019smagnetosphereto contract and then\nexpand after the solar wind passes by. These changes can cause (usually mild) electromagnetic disturbances\non Earth.\nMore serious aresolar flares, which shower the upper atmosphere of Earth with X-rays, energetic particles,\nand intense ultraviolet radiation. The X-rays and ultraviolet radiation can ionize atoms in Earth\u2019s upper\natmosphere, and the freed electrons can build up a charge on the surface of a spacecraft. When this static\ncharge discharges, it can damage the electronics in the spacecraft\u2014just as you can receive a shock when you\nwalk across a carpet in your stocking feet in a dry climate and then touch a light switch or some other metal\nobject.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 15.4 \u2022 Space Weather 515\nMost disruptive arecoronal mass ejections. A CME is an erupting bubble of tens of millions of tons of gas\nblown away from the Sun into space. When this bubble reaches Earth a few days after leaving the Sun, it heats\nthe ionosphere, which expands and reaches farther into space. As a consequence, friction between the\natmosphere and spacecraft increases, dragging satellites to lower altitudes.\nAt the time of a particularly strong flare and CME in March 1989, the system responsible for tracking some\n19,000 objects orbiting Earth temporarily lost track of 11,000 of them because their orbits were changed by the\nexpansion of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Duringsolar maximum, a number of satellites are brought to such a low\naltitude that they are destroyed by friction with the atmosphere. Both the Hubble Space Telescope and the\nInternational Space Station (Figure 15.24) require reboosts to higher altitude so that they can remain in orbit.\nFigure15.24International Space Station.The International Space Station is seen above Earth, as photographed in 2010 by the\ndeparting crew of the Space Shuttle Atlantis. (credit: NASA)\nSolar Storm Damage on Earth\nWhen a CME reaches Earth, it distorts Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Since a changing magnetic field induces electrical\ncurrent, the CME accelerates electrons, sometimes to very high speeds. These \u201ckiller electrons\u201d can penetrate\ndeep into satellites, sometimes destroying their electronics and permanently disabling operation. This has\nhappened with some communications satellites.\nDisturbances in Earth\u2019s magnetic field can cause disruptions in communications, especially cell phone and\nwireless systems. In fact, disruptions can be expected to occur several times a year duringsolar maximum.\nChanges in Earth\u2019s magnetic field due to CMEs can also cause surges in power lines large enough to burn out\ntransformers and cause major power outages. For example, in 1989, parts of Montreal and Quebec Province in\nCanada were without power for up to 9 hours as a result of a major solar storm. Electrical outages due to\nCMEs are more likely to occur in North America than in Europe because North America is closer to Earth\u2019s\nmagnetic pole, where the currents induced by CMEs are strongest.\nBesides changing the orbits of satellites, CMEs can also distort the signals sent by them. These effects can be\nlarge enough to reduce the accuracy of GPS-derived positions so that they cannot meet the limits required for\nairplane systems, which must know their positions to within 160 feet. Such disruptions caused by CMEs have\noccasionally forced the Federal Aviation Administration to restrict flights for minutes or, in a few cases, even\ndays.\nSolar storms also expose astronauts, passengers in high-flying airplanes, and even people on the surface of 516 15 \u2022 The Sun: A Garden-Variety Star\nEarth to increased amounts of radiation. Astronauts, for example, are limited in the total amount of radiation\nto which they can be exposed during their careers. A single ill-timed solar outburst could end an astronaut\u2019s\ncareer. This problem becomes increasingly serious as astronauts spend more time in space. For example, the\ntypicaldailydose of radiation aboard the Russian Mir space station was equivalent to about eight chest X-rays.\nOne of the major challenges in planning the human exploration of Mars is devising a way to protect astronauts\nfrom high-energy solar radiation.\nAdvance warning of solar storms would help us minimize their disruptive effects. Power networks could be run\nat less than their full capacity so that they could absorb the effects of power surges. Communications\nnetworks could be prepared for malfunctions and have backup plans in place. Spacewalks could be timed to\navoid major solar outbursts. Scientists are now trying to find ways to predict where and when flares and CMEs\nwill occur, and whether they will be big, fast events or small, slow ones with little consequence for Earth.\nThe strategy is to relate changes in the appearance of small, active regions and changes in local magnetic\nfields on the Sun to subsequent eruptions. However, right now, our predictive capability is still poor, and so the\nonly real warning we have is from actually seeing CMEs and flares occur. Since a CME travels outward at about\n500 kilometers per second, an observation of an eruption provides several days warning at the distance of\nEarth. However, the severity of the impact on Earth depends on how the magnetic field associated with the\nCME is oriented relative to Earth\u2019s magnetic field. The orientation can be measured only when the CME flows\npast a satellite we have put up for this purpose. However, it is located only about an hour upstream from\nEarth.\nSpace weather predictions are now available online to scientists and the public. Outlooks are given a week\nahead, bulletins are issued when there is an event that is likely to be of interest to the public, and warnings\nand alerts are posted when an event is imminent or already under way (Figure 15.25).\nFigure15.25NOAA Space Weather Prediction Operations Center.Bill Murtagh, a space weather forecaster, leads a workshop on\npreparedness for events like geomagnetic storms.

Models are being developed that will then allow scientists to use early information about the\nCME to predict its likely impact on Earth.\nThe hope is that soon, solar weather forecasting will have some of the predictive capability that meteorologists\nhave achieved for terrestrial weather at Earth\u2019s surface. However, the most difficult events to predict are the\nlargest and most damaging storms\u2014hurricanes on Earth and extreme, rare storm events on the Sun. Thus, it\nis inevitable that the Sun will continue to surprise us.\nEXAMPLE 15.1\nThe Timing of Solar Events\nA basic equation is useful in figuring out when events on the Sun will impact Earth:\nDividing both sides byv, we get\nSuppose you observe a major solar flare while astronauts are orbiting Earth. If the average speed of solar\nwind is 400 km/s and the distance to the Sun as 1.496 \u00d7 108km, how long it will before the charged particles\nejected from the Sun during the flare reach the space station?\nSolution\nThe time required for solar wind particles to reach Earth isT=D/v.\nCheck Your Learning\nHow many days would it take for the particles to reach Earth if the solar wind speed increased to\n500 km/s?\nAnswer:\nEarth\u2019s Climate and the Sunspot Cycle: Is There a Connection?\nWhile the Sun rises faithfully every day at a time that can be calculated precisely, scientists have determined\nthat the Sun\u2019s energy output is not truly constant but varies over the centuries by a small amount\u2014probably\nless than 1%. We\u2019ve seen that the number of sunspots varies, with the time between sunspot maxima of about\n11 years, and that the number of sunspots at maximum is not always the same. Considerable evidence shows\nthat between the years 1645 and 1715, the number of sunspots, even at sunspot maximum, was much lower\nthan it is now. This interval of significantly low sunspot numbers was first noted by GustavSp\u04e7rerin 1887 and\nthen by E. W.Maunderin 1890; it is now called theMaunder Minimum. The variation in the number of\nsunspots over the past three centuries is shown inFigure 15.26. Besides the Maunder Minimum in the\nseventeenth century, sunspot numbers were somewhat lower during the first part of the nineteenth century\nthan they are now; this period is called the Little Maunder Minimum. 518 15 \u2022 The Sun: A Garden-Variety Star\nFigure15.26Numbers of Sunspots over Time.This diagram shows how the number of sunspots has changed with time since\ncounts of the numbers of spots began to be recorded on a consistent scale. Note the low number of spots during the early years of\nthe nineteenth century, the Little Maunder Minimum. (credit: modification of work by NASA/ARC)\nWhen the number of sunspots is high, the Sun is active in various other ways as well, and, as we will see in\nseveral sections below, some of this activity affects Earth directly. For example, there are moreauroral displays\nwhen the sunspot number is high. Auroras are caused when energetically charged particles from the Sun\ninteract with Earth\u2019smagnetosphere, and the Sun is more likely to spew out particles when it is active and the\nsunspot number is high. Historical accounts also indicate that auroral activity was abnormally low throughout\nthe several decades of the Maunder Minimum.\nThe Maunder Minimum was a time of exceptionally low temperatures in Europe\u2014so low that this period is\ndescribed as theLittle Ice Age. This coincidence in time caused scientists to try to understand whether small\nchanges in the Sun could affect the climate on Earth. There is clear evidence that it was unusually cold in\nEurope during part of the seventeenth century. The River Thames in London froze at least 11 times, ice\nappeared in the oceans off the coasts of southeast England, and low summer temperatures led to short\ngrowing seasons and poor harvests. However, whether and how changes on the Sun on this timescale\ninfluence Earth\u2019s climate is still a matter of debate among scientists.\nOther small changes in climate like the Little Ice Age have occurred and have had their impacts on human\nhistory. For example, explorers from Norway first colonized Iceland and then reached Greenland by 986. From\nthere, they were able to make repeated visits to the northeastern coasts of North America, including\nNewfoundland, between about 1000 and 1350. (The ships of the time did not allow the Norse explorers to\ntravel all the way to North America directly, but only from Greenland, which served as a station for further\nexploration.)\nMost of Greenland is covered by ice, and the Greenland station was never self-sufficient; rather, it depended\non imports of food and other goods from Norway for its survival. When a little ice age began in the thirteenth\ncentury, voyaging became very difficult, and support of the Greenland colony was no longer possible. The last-\nknown contact with it was made by a ship from Iceland blown off course in 1410. When European ships again\nbegan to visit Greenland in 1577, the entire colony there had disappeared.\nThe estimated dates for these patterns of migration follow what we know about solar activity. Solar activity\nwas unusually high between 1100 and 1250, which includes the time when the first European contacts were\nmade with North America. Activity was low from 1280 to 1340 and there was a little ice age, which was about\nthe time regular contact with North America and between Greenland and Europe stopped.\nOne must be cautious, however, about assuming that low sunspot numbers or variations in the Sun\u2019s output\nof energycausedthe Little Ice Age. There is no satisfactory model that can explain how a reduction in solar\nactivity might cause cooler temperatures on Earth. An alternative possibility is that the cold weather during the\nLittle Ice Age was related to volcanic activity. Volcanoes can eject aerosols (tiny droplets or particles) into the\natmosphere that efficiently reflect sunlight. Observations show, for example, that the Pinatubo eruption in\n1991 ejected SO aerosols into the atmosphere, which reduced the amount of sunlight reaching Earth\u2019s\n2\nsurface enough to lower global temperatures by 0.4 \u00b0C.\nSatellite data show that the energy output from the Sun during asolar cyclevaries by only about 0.1%. We\nAccess for free at openstax.org 15.4 \u2022 Space Weather 519\nknow of no physical process that would explain how such a small variation could cause global temperature\nchanges. The level of solar activity may, however, have other effects. For example, although the Sun\u2019s total\nenergy output varies by only 0.1% during a solar cycle, its extreme ultraviolet radiation is 10 times higher at\ntimes of solar maximum than at solar minimum. This large variation can affect the chemistry and temperature\nstructure of the upper atmosphere. One effect might be a reduction in the ozone layer and a cooling of the\nstratosphere near Earth\u2019s poles. This, in turn, could change the circulation patterns of winds aloft and, hence,\nthe tracks of storms. There is some recent evidence that variations in regional rainfall correlate better with\nsolar activity than does the global temperature of Earth. But, as you can see, the relationship between what\nhappens on the Sun and what happens to Earth\u2019s climate over the short term is still an area that scientists are\ninvestigating and debating.\nWhatever the effects of solar activity may be on local rainfall or temperature patterns, we want to emphasize\none important idea: Our climate change data and the models developed to account for the data consistently\nshow that solar variability isnotthe cause of the global warming that has occurred during the past 50 years. 520 15 \u2022 Key Terms\nKey Terms\nactive region an area on the Sun where magnetic fields are concentrated; sunspots, prominences, flares,\nand CMEs all tend to occur in active regions\naurora light radiated by atoms and ions in the ionosphere excited by charged particles from the Sun, mostly\nseen in the magnetic polar regions\nchromosphere the part of the solar atmosphere that lies immediately above the photospheric layers\ncorona (of the Sun) the outer (hot) atmosphere of the Sun\ncoronal hole a region in the Sun\u2019s outer atmosphere that appears darker because there is less hot gas there\ncoronal mass ejection (CME) a solar flare in which immense quantities of coronal material\u2014mainly protons\nand electrons\u2014is ejected at high speeds (500\u20131000 kilometers per second) into interplanetary space\ndifferential rotation the phenomenon that occurs when different parts of a rotating object rotate at\ndifferent rates at different latitudes\ngranulation the rice-grain-like structure of the solar photosphere; granulation is produced by upwelling\ncurrents of gas that are slightly hotter, and therefore brighter, than the surrounding regions, which are\nflowing downward into the Sun\nMaunder Minimum a period during the seventeenth century when the number of sunspots seen\nthroughout the solar cycle was unusually low\nphotosphere the region of the solar (or stellar) atmosphere from which continuous radiation escapes into\nspace\nplage a bright region of the solar surface observed in the light of some spectral line\nplasma a hot ionized gas\nprominence a large, bright, gaseous feature that appears above the surface of the Sun and extends into the\ncorona\nsolar flare a sudden and temporary outburst of electromagnetic radiation from an extended region of the\nSun\u2019s surface\nsolar wind a flow of hot, charged particles leaving the Sun\nsunspot large, dark features seen on the surface of the Sun caused by increased magnetic activity\nsunspot cycle the semiregular 11-year period with which the frequency of sunspots fluctuates\ntransition region the region in the Sun\u2019s atmosphere where the temperature rises very rapidly from the\nrelatively low temperatures that characterize the chromosphere to the high temperatures of the corona\nSummary\n15.1The Structure and Composition of the Sun\nThe Sun, our star, has several layers beneath the visible surface: the core, radiative zone, and convective zone.\nThese, in turn, are surrounded by a number of layers that make up the solar atmosphere. In order of\nincreasing distance from the center of the Sun, they are the photosphere, with a temperature that ranges from\n4500 K to about 6800 K; the chromosphere, with a typical temperature of 104K; the transition region, a zone\nthat may be only a few kilometers thick, where the temperature increases rapidly from 104K to 106K; and the\ncorona, with temperatures of a few million K. The Sun\u2019s surface is mottled with upwelling convection currents\nseen as hot, bright granules. Solar wind particles stream out into the solar system through coronal holes.\nWhen such particles reach the vicinity of Earth, they produce auroras, which are strongest near Earth\u2019s\nmagnetic poles. Hydrogen and helium together make up 98% of the mass of the Sun, whose composition is\nmuch more characteristic of the universe at large than is the composition of Earth.\n15.2The Solar Cycle\nSunspots are dark regions where the temperature is up to 2000 K cooler than the surrounding photosphere.\nTheir motion across the Sun\u2019s disk allows us to calculate how fast the Sun turns on its axis. The Sun rotates\nmore rapidly at its equator, where the rotation period is about 25 days, than near the poles, where the period\nAccess for free at openstax.org 15 \u2022 For Further Exploration 521\nis slightly longer than 36 days. The number of visible sunspots varies according to a sunspot cycle that\naverages 11 years in length. Spots frequently occur in pairs. During a given 11-year cycle, all leading spots in\nthe Northern Hemisphere have the same magnetic polarity, whereas all leading sports in the Southern\nHemisphere have the opposite polarity. In the subsequent 11-year cycle, the polarity reverses. For this reason,\nthe magnetic activity cycle of the Sun is understood to last for 22 years. This activity cycle is connected with the\nbehavior of the Sun\u2019s magnetic field, but the exact mechanism is not yet understood.\n15.3Solar Activity above the Photosphere\nSigns of more intense solar activity, an increase in the number of sunspots, as well as prominences, plages,\nsolar flares, andcoronal mass ejections, all tend to occur in active regions\u2014that is, in places on the Sun with\nthe same latitude and longitude but at different heights in the atmosphere. Active regions vary with the solar\ncycle, just like sunspots do.\n15.4Space Weather\nSpace weather is the effect of solar activity on our own planet, both in our magnetosphere and on Earth\u2019s\nsurface. Coronal holes allow more of the Sun\u2019s material to flow out into space. Solar flares and coronal mass\nejections can cause auroras, disrupt communications, damage satellites, and cause power outages on Earth.\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nBerman, B. \u201cHow Solar Storms Could Shut Down Earth.\u201dAstronomy(September 2013): 22.

Long before the nature of the Sun was fully understood, astronomer (and planet discoverer) William\nHerschel (1738\u20131822) proposed that the hot Sun may have a cool interior and may be inhabited. Have your\ngroup discuss this proposal and come up with modern arguments against it.\nC. We discussed how the migration of Europeans to North America was apparently affected by short-term\nclimate change. If Earth were to become significantly hotter, either because of changes in the Sun or\nbecause of greenhouse warming, one effect would be an increase in the rate of melting of the polar ice\ncaps.

How does activity on the Sun affect human technology on Earth and in the rest of the solar system?\n12. How does activity on the Sun affect natural phenomena on Earth?\nThought Questions\n13. Table 15.1indicates that the density of the Sun is 1.41 g/cm3. Since other materials, such as ice, have\nsimilar densities, how do you know that the Sun is not made of ice?\n14. Starting from the core of the Sun and going outward, the temperature decreases. Yet, above the\nphotosphere, the temperature increases. How can this be?\n15. Since the rotation period of the Sun can be determined by observing the apparent motions of sunspots, a\ncorrection must be made for the orbital motion of Earth. Explain what the correction is and how it arises.\nMaking some sketches may help answer this question.\n16. Suppose an (extremely hypothetical) elongated sunspot forms that extends from a latitude of 30\u00b0 to a\nlatitude of 40\u00b0 along a fixed of longitude on the Sun. How will the appearance of that sunspot change as\nthe Sun rotates? (Figure 15.17should help you figure this out.)\n17. The text explains that plages are found near sunspots, butFigure 15.18shows that they appear even in\nareas without sunspots. What might be the explanation for this?\n18. Why would a flare be observed in visible light, when they are so much brighter in X-ray and ultraviolet\nlight?\n19. How can the prominences, which are so big and \u2018float\u2019 in the corona, stay gravitationally attached to the\nSun while flares can escape?\n20. If you were concerned about space weather and wanted to avoid it, where would be the safest place on\nEarth for you to live?\n21. Suppose you live in northern Canada and an extremely strong flare is reported on the Sun. What\nprecautions might you take? What might be a positive result?\nFiguring for Yourself\n22. The edge of the Sun doesn\u2019t have to be absolutely sharp in order to look that way to us. It just has to go\nfrom being transparent to being completely opaque in a distance that is smaller than your eye can\nresolve. Remember fromAstronomical Instrumentsthat the ability to resolve detail depends on the size of\nthe telescope\u2019s aperture. The pupil of your eye is very small relative to the size of a telescope and\ntherefore is very limited in the amount of detail you can see. In fact, your eye cannot see details that are\nsmaller than 1/30 of the diameter of the Sun (about 1 arcminute). Nearly all the light from the Sun\nemerges from a layer that is only about 400 km thick. What fraction is this of the diameter of the Sun?\nHow does this compare with the ability of the human eye to resolve detail? Suppose we could see light\nemerging directly from a layer that was 300,000 km thick. Would the Sun appear to have a sharp edge?\nAccess for free at openstax.org 15 \u2022 Exercises 525\n23. Show that the statement that 92% of the Sun\u2019s atoms are hydrogen is consistent with the statement that\n73% of the Sun\u2019s mass is made up of hydrogen, as found inTable 15.2. (Hint: Make the simplifying\nassumption, which is nearly correct, that the Sun is made up entirely of hydrogen and helium.)\n24. From Doppler shifts of the spectral lines in the light coming from the east and west edges of the Sun,\nastronomers find that the radial velocities of the two edges differ by about 4 km/s, meaning that the Sun\u2019s\nrotation rate is 2 km/s. Find the approximate period of rotation of the Sun in days. The circumference of a\nsphere is given by 2\u03c0R, whereRis the radius of the sphere.\n25. Assuming an average sunspot cycle of 11 years, how many revolutions does the equator of the Sun make\nduring that one cycle?

(credit: modification of work by Ed Dunens)\nChapter Outline\n16.1Sources of Sunshine: Thermal and Gravitational Energy\n16.2Mass, Energy, and the Theory of Relativity\n16.3The Solar Interior: Theory\n16.4The Solar Interior: Observations\nThinking Ahead\nThe Sun puts out an incomprehensible amount of energy\u2014so much that its ultraviolet radiation can cause\nsunburns from 93 million miles away. It is also very old. As you learned earlier, evidence shows that the Sun\nformed about 4.5 billion years ago and has been shining ever since. How can the Sun produce so much energy\nfor so long?\nThe Sun\u2019s energy output is about 4 \u00d7 1026watts. This is unimaginably bright: brighter than a trillion cities\ntogether each with a trillion 100-watt light bulbs. Most known methods of generating energy fall far short of\nthe capacity of the Sun. The total amount of energy produced over the entire life of the Sun is staggering,\nsince the Sun has been shining for billions of years. Scientists were unable to explain the seemingly unlimited\nenergy of stars like the Sun prior to the twentieth century.\n16.1 Sources of Sunshine: Thermal and Gravitational Energy\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nIdentify different forms of energy\nUnderstand the law of conservation of energy\nExplain ways that energy can be transformed\nEnergy is a challenging concept to grasp because it exists in so many different forms that it defies any single\nsimple explanation. In many ways, comprehending energy is like comprehending wealth: There are very 528 16 \u2022 The Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse\ndifferent forms of wealth and they follow different rules, depending on if they are the stock market, real estate,\na collection of old comic books, great piles of cash, or one of the many other ways to make and lose money. It\nis easier to discuss one or two forms of wealth\u2014or energy\u2014than to discuss that concept in general.\nWhen striving to understand how theSuncan put out so much energy for so long, scientists considered many\ndifferent types of energy. Nineteenth-century scientists knew of two possible sources for the Sun\u2019s energy:\nchemical and gravitational energy. The source of chemical energy most familiar to them was the burning (the\nchemical term isoxidation) of wood, coal, gasoline, or other fuel. We know exactly how much energy the\nburning of these materials can produce. We can thus calculate that even if the immense mass of the Sun\nconsisted of a burnable material like coal or wood, our star could not produce energy at its present rate for\nmore than few thousand years. However, we know from geologic evidence that water was present on Earth\u2019s\nsurface nearly 4 billion years ago, so the Sun must have been shining brightly (and making Earth warm) at\nleast as long as that. Today, we also know that at the temperatures found in the Sun, nothing like solid wood\nor coal could survive.\nASTRONOMY BASICS\nWhat\u2019s Watt?\nJust a word about the units we are using. Awatt(W) is a unit ofpower, which is energy used or given off per\nunit time. It is measured in joules per second (J/s). You know from your everyday experience that it is not\njusthow muchenergy you expend, buthow longyou take to do it. (Burning 10 Calories in 10 minutes\nrequires a very different kind of exercise than burning those 10 Calories in an hour.) Watts tell you therate\nat which energy is being used; for example, a 100-watt bulb uses 100 joules (J) of energy every second.\nAnd how big is a joule? A 73-kilogram (160-pound) astronomy instructor running at about 4.4 meters per\nsecond (10 miles per hour) because he is late for class has a motion energy of about 700 joules.\nConservation of Energy\nOther nineteenth-century attempts to determine what makes the Sun shine used thelaw of conservation of\nenergy. Simply stated, this law says that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but can be transformed from\none type to another, such as from heat to mechanical energy. The steam engine, which was key to the\nIndustrial Revolution, provides a good example. In this type of engine, the hot steam from a boiler drives the\nmovement of a piston, converting heat energy into motion energy.\nConversely, motion can be transformed into heat. If you clap your hands vigorously at the end of an especially\ngood astronomy lecture, your palms become hotter. If you rub ice on the surface of a table, the heat produced\nby friction melts the ice. The brakes on cars use friction to reduce speed, and in the process, transform motion\nenergy into heat energy. That is why after bringing a car to a stop, the brakes can be very hot; this also\nexplains why brakes can overheat when used carelessly while descending long mountain roads.\nIn the nineteenth century, scientists thought that the source of the Sun\u2019s heat might be the mechanical motion\nof meteorites falling into it. Their calculations showed, however, that in order to produce the total amount of\nenergy emitted by the Sun, the mass in meteorites that would have to fall into the Sun every 100 years would\nequal the mass of Earth. The resulting increase in the Sun\u2019s mass would, according to Kepler\u2019s third law,\nchange the period of Earth\u2019s orbit by 2 seconds per year. Such a change would be easily measurable and was\nnot, in fact, occurring. Scientists could then disprove this as the source of the Sun\u2019s energy.\nGravitational Contraction as a Source of Energy\nProposing an alternative explanation, British physicist LordKelvinand German scientist Hermann von\nAccess for free at openstax.org 16.1 \u2022 Sources of Sunshine: Thermal and Gravitational Energy 529\nHelmholtz (Figure 16.2), in about the middle of the nineteenth century, proposed that the Sun might produce\nenergy by the conversion ofgravitational energyinto heat. They suggested that the outer layers of the Sun\nmight be \u201cfalling\u201d inward because of the force of gravity. In other words, they proposed that the Sun could be\nshrinking in size, staying hot and bright as a result.\nFigure16.2Kelvin (1824\u20131907) and Helmholtz (1821\u20131894).(a) British physicist William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) and (b) German\nscientist Hermann von Helmholtz proposed that the contraction of the Sun under its own gravity might account for its energy. (credit\na: modification of work by Wellcome Library, London; credit b: modification of work by Wellcome Library, London)\nTo imagine what would happen if this hypothesis were true, picture the outer layer of the Sun starting to fall\ninward. This outer layer is a gas made up of individual atoms, all moving about in random directions. If a layer\nfalls inward, the atoms acquire an additional speed because of falling motion. As the outer layer falls inward, it\nalso contracts, moving the atoms closer together. Collisions become more likely, and some of them transfer\nthe extra speed associated with the falling motion to other atoms. This, in turn, increases the speeds of those\natoms. The temperature of a gas is a measure of the kinetic energy (motion) of the atoms within it; hence, the\ntemperature of this layer of the Sun increases. Collisions also excite electrons within the atoms to higher-\nenergy orbits. When these electrons return to their normal orbits, they emit photons, which can then escape\nfrom the Sun (seeRadiation and Spectra).\nKelvin and Helmholtz calculated that a contraction of the Sun at a rate of only about 40 meters per year would\nbe enough to produce the amount of energy that it is now radiating. Over the span of human history, the\ndecrease in the Sun\u2019s size from such a slow contraction would be undetectable.\nIf we assume that the Sun began its life as a large, diffuse cloud of gas, then we can calculate how much\nenergy has been radiated by the Sun during its entire lifetime as it has contracted from a very large diameter\nto its present size. The amount of energy is on the order of 1042joules. Since the solar luminosity is 4 \u00d7 1026\nwatts (joules/second) or about 1034joules per year, contraction could keep the Sun shining at its present rate\nfor roughly 100 million years.\nIn the nineteenth century, 100 million years at first seemed plenty long enough, since Earth was then widely\nthought to be much younger than this. But toward the end of that century and into the twentieth, geologists\nand physicists showed that Earth (and, hence, the Sun) is actually much older. Contraction therefore cannot be\nthe primary source of solar energy (although, as we shall see inThe Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets\nOutside the Solar System, contraction is an important source of energy for a while in stars that are just being\nborn). Scientists were thus confronted with a puzzle of enormous proportions. Either an unknown type of\nenergy was responsible for the most important energy source known to humanity, or estimates of the age of 530 16 \u2022 The Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse\nthe solar system (and life on Earth) had to be seriously modified. Charles Darwin, whose theory of evolution\nrequired a longer time span than the theories of the Sun seemed to permit, was discouraged by these results\nand continued to worry about them until his death in 1882.\nIt was only in the twentieth century that the true source of the Sun\u2019s energy was identified. The two key pieces\nof information required to solve the puzzle were the structure of the nucleus of the atom and the fact that\nmass can be converted into energy.\n16.2 Mass, Energy, and the Theory of Relativity\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain how matter can be converted into energy\nDescribe the particles that make up atoms\nDescribe the nucleus of an atom\nUnderstand the nuclear forces that hold atoms together\nTrace the nuclear reactions in the solar interior\nAs we have seen,energycannot be created or destroyed, but only converted from one form to another. One of\nthe remarkable conclusions derived by AlbertEinstein(seeAlbert Einstein) when he developed histheory of\nrelativityis that matter can be considered a form of energy too and can be converted into energy.\nFurthermore, energy can also be converted into matter. This seemed to contradict what humans had learned\nover thousands of years by studying nature. Matter is something we can see and touch, whereas energy is\nsomething objects have when they do things like move or heat up. The idea that matter or energy can be\nconverted into each other seemed as outrageous as saying you could accelerate a car by turning the bumper\ninto more speed, or that you could create a bigger front seat by slowing down your car. That would be pretty\ndifficult to believe; yet, the universe actually works somewhat like that.\nConverting Matter into Energy\nThe remarkable equivalence between matter and energy is given in one of the most famous equations:\nIn this equation,Estands for energy,mstands for mass, andc, the constant that relates the two, is the speed\nof light (3 \u00d7 108meters per second). Note that mass is a measure of the quantity of matter, so the significance\nof this equation is that matter can be converted into energy and energy can be converted into matter. Let\u2019s\ncompare this equation of converting matter and energy to some common conversion equations that have the\nsame form:\nJust as each conversion formula allows you to calculate the conversion of one thing into another, when we\nconvert matter into energy, we consider how much mass the matter has. The conversion factor in this case\nturns out not to be either 12 or 100, as in our examples, but another constant quantity: the speed of light\nsquared. Note that matter does not have to travel at the speed of light (or the speed of light squared) for this\nconversion to occur. The factor ofc2is just the number that Einstein showed must be used to relate mass and\nenergy.\nNotice that this formula does not tell ushowto convert mass into energy, just as the formula for cents does\nnot tell us where to exchange coins for a dollar bill. The formulas merely tell us what the equivalent values are\nif we succeed in making the conversion. When Einstein first derived his formula in 1905, no one had the\nfaintest idea how to convert mass into energy in any practical way. Einstein himself tried to discourage\nspeculation that the large-scale conversion of atomic mass into energy would be feasible in the near future.\nToday, as a result of developments in nuclear physics, we regularly convert mass into energy in power plants,\nAccess for free at openstax.org 16.2 \u2022 Mass, Energy, and the Theory of Relativity 531\nnuclear weapons, and high-energy physics experiments in particle accelerators.\nBecause the speed of light squared (c2) is a very large quantity, the conversion of even a small amount of mass\nresults in a very large amount of energy. For example, the complete conversion of 1 gram of matter (about 1/\n28 ounce, or approximately 1 paperclip) would produce as much energy as the burning of 15,000 barrels of oil.\nScientists soon realized that the conversion of mass into energy is the source of the Sun\u2019s heat and light. With\nEinstein\u2019s equation ofE=mc2, we can calculate that the amount of energy radiated by the Sun could be\nproduced by the complete conversion of about 4 million tons of matter into energy inside the Sun each\nsecond. Destroying 4 million tons per second sounds like a lot when compared to earthly things, but bear in\nmind that the Sun is a very big reservoir of matter. In fact, we will see that the Sun contains more than enough\nmass to destroy such huge amounts of matter and still continue shining at its present rate for billions of years.\nBut knowing all that still does not tell ushowmass can be converted into energy. To understand the process\nthat actually occurs in the Sun, we need to explore the structure of the atom a bit further.\nVOYAGERS IN ASTRONOMY\nAlbert Einstein\nFor a large part of his life, AlbertEinstein(Figure 16.3) was one of the most recognized celebrities of his day.\nStrangers stopped him on the street, and people all over the world asked him for endorsements, advice,\nand assistance. In fact, when Einstein and the great film star Charlie Chaplin met in California, they found\nthey shared similar feelings about the loss of privacy that came with fame. Einstein\u2019s name was a\nhousehold word despite the fact that most people did not understand the ideas that had made him\nfamous.\nEinstein was born in 1879 in Ulm, Germany. Legend has it that he did not do well in school (even in\narithmetic), and thousands of students have since attempted to justify a bad grade by referring to this\nstory. Alas, like many legends, this one is not true. Records indicate that although he tended to rebel\nagainst the authoritarian teaching style in vogue in Germany at that time, Einstein was a good student.\nAfter graduating from the Federal Polytechnic Institute in Zurich, Switzerland, Einstein at first had trouble\ngetting a job (even as a high school teacher), but he eventually became an examiner in the Swiss Patent\nOffice. Working in his spare time, without the benefit of a university environment but using his superb\nphysical intuition, he wrote four papers in 1905 that would ultimately transform the way physicists looked at\nthe world.\nOne of these, which earned Einstein the Nobel Prize in 1921, set part of the foundation ofquantum\nmechanics\u2014the rich, puzzling, and remarkable theory of the subatomic realm. But his most important\npaper presented thespecial theory of relativity, a reexamination of space, time, and motion that added a\nwhole new level of sophistication to our understanding of those concepts. The famed equationE=mc2was\nactually a relatively minor part of this theory, added in a later paper.\nIn 1916, Einstein published hisgeneral theory of relativity, which was, among other things, a fundamentally\nnew description of gravity (seeBlack Holes and Curved Spacetime). When this theory was confirmed by\nmeasurements of the \u201cbending of starlight\u201d during a 1919 eclipse (The New York Timesheadline read,\n\u201cLights All Askew in the Heavens\u201d), Einstein became world famous.\nIn 1933, to escape Nazi persecution, Einstein left his professorship in Berlin and settled in the United States\nat the newly created Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton. He remained there until his death in 1955,\nwriting, lecturing, and espousing a variety of intellectual and political causes. For example, he agreed to\nsign a letter written by Leo Szilard and other scientists in 1939, alerting President Roosevelt to the dangers 532 16 \u2022 The Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse\nof allowing Nazi Germany to develop the atomic bomb first. And in 1952, Einstein was offered the second\npresidency of Israel. In declining the position, he said, \u201cI know a little about nature and hardly anything\nabout men.\u201d\nFigure16.3Albert Einstein (1879\u20131955).This portrait of Einstein was taken in 1912. (credit: modification of work by J. F.\nLanghans)\nElementary Particles\nThe fundamental components of atoms are the proton, neutron, and electron (seeThe Structure of the Atom).\nProtons, neutrons, and electrons are by no means all the particles that exist. First, for each kind of particle,\nthere is a corresponding but oppositeantiparticle. If the particle carries a charge, itsantiparticlehas the\nopposite charge. The antielectron is thepositron, which has the same mass as the electron but is positively\ncharged. Similarly, the antiproton has a negative charge. The remarkable thing about suchantimatteris that\nwhen a particle comes into contact with its antiparticle, the original particles are annihilated, and substantial\namounts of energy in the form of photons are produced.\nSince our world is made exclusively of ordinary particles of matter,antimattercannot survive for very long. But\nindividual antiparticles are found in cosmic rays (particles that arrive at the top of Earth\u2019s atmosphere from\nspace) and can be created in particle accelerators. And, as we will see in a moment, antimatter is created in the\ncore of the Sun and other stars.\nScience fiction fans may be familiar with antimatter from theStar Trektelevision series and films. The Starship\nEnterprise is propelled by the careful combining of matter and antimatter in the ship\u2019s engine room. According\ntoE=mc2, the annihilation of matter and antimatter can produce a huge amount of energy, but keeping the\nantimatter fuel from touching the ship before it is needed must be a big problem. No wonder Scotty, the chief\nengineer in the original TV show, always looked worried!\nIn 1933, physicist WolfgangPauli(Figure 16.4) suggested that there might be another type of elementary\nparticle. Energy seemed to disappear when certain types of nuclear reactions took place, violating the law of\nconservation of energy. Pauli was reluctant to accept the idea that one of the basic laws of physics was wrong,\nand he suggested a \u201cdesperate remedy.\u201d Perhaps a so-far-undetected particle, which was given the name\nneutrino(\u201clittle neutral one\u201d), carried away the \u201cmissing\u201d energy. He suggested that neutrinos were particles\nwith zero mass, and that like photons, they moved with the speed of light.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 16.2 \u2022 Mass, Energy, and the Theory of Relativity 533\nFigure16.4Wolfgang Pauli in 1945.Pauli is considered the \u201cfather\u201d of the neutrino, having conceived of it in 1933.\nThe elusive neutrino was not detected until 1956. The reason it was so hard to find is that neutrinos interact\nvery weakly with other matter and therefore are very difficult to detect. Earth is more transparent to a\nneutrino than the thinnest and cleanest pane of glass is to a photon of light. In fact, most neutrinos can pass\ncompletely through a star or planet without being absorbed. As we shall see, this behavior of neutrinos makes\nthem a very important tool for studying the Sun. Since Pauli\u2019s prediction, scientists have learned a lot more\nabout the neutrino. We now know that there are three different types of neutrinos, and in 1998, neutrinos\nwere discovered to have a tiny amount of mass. Indeed, it is so tiny that electrons are at least 500,000 times\nmore massive. Ongoing research is focused on determining the mass of neutrinos more precisely, and it may\nstill turn out that one of the three types is massless. We will return to the subject of neutrinos later in this\nchapter.\nSome of the properties of the proton, electron, neutron, and neutrino are summarized inTable 16.1. (Other\nsubatomic particles have been produced by experiments with particle accelerators, but they do not play a role\nin the generation of solar energy.)\nProperties of Some Common Particles\nParticle Mass (kg) Charge\nProton 1.67265 \u00d7 10\u221227 +1\nNeutron 1.67495 \u00d7 10\u221227 0\nElectron 9.11 \u00d7 10\u221231 \u22121\nNeutrino <2 \u00d7 10\u221236(uncertain) 0\nTable16.1\nThe Atomic Nucleus\nThe nucleus of an atom is not just a loose collection of elementary particles. Inside the nucleus, particles are\nheld together by a very powerful force called thestrong nuclear force. This is short-range force, only capable 534 16 \u2022 The Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse\nof acting over distances about the size of the atomic nucleus. A quick thought experiment shows how\nimportant this force is. Take a look at your finger and consider the atoms composing it. Among them is carbon,\none of the basic elements of life. Focus your imagination on the nucleus of one of your carbon atoms. It\ncontains six protons, which have a positive charge, and six neutrons, which are neutral. Thus, the nucleus has\na net charge of six positives. If only the electrical force were acting, the protons in this and every carbon atom\nwould find each other very repulsive and fly apart.\nThe strong nuclear force is an attractive force, stronger than the electrical force, and it keeps the particles of\nthe nucleus tightly bound together. We saw earlier that if under the force of gravity a star \u201cshrinks\u201d\u2014bringing\nits atoms closer together\u2014gravitational energy is released. In the same way, if particles come together under\nthe strong nuclear force and unite to form an atomic nucleus, some of the nuclear energy is released. The\nenergy given up in such a process is called thebinding energyof the nucleus.\nWhen suchbinding energyis released, the resulting nucleus has slightly less mass than the sum of the masses\nof the particles that came together to form it. In other words, the energy comes from the loss of mass. This\nslight deficit in mass is only a small fraction of the mass of one proton. But because each bit of lost mass can\nprovide a lot of energy (remember,E=mc2), this nuclear energy release can be quite substantial.\nMeasurements show that the binding energy is greatest for atoms with a mass near that of the iron nucleus\n(with a combined number of protons and neutrons equal to 56) and less for both the lighter and the heavier\nnuclei. Iron, therefore, is the most stable element: since it gives up the most energy when it forms, it would\nrequire the most energy to break it back down into its component particles.\nWhat this means is that, in general, when light atomic nuclei come together to form a heavier one (up to iron),\nmass is lost and energy is released. This joining together of atomic nuclei is called nuclearfusion.\nEnergy can also be produced by breaking up heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones (down to iron); this process\nis called nuclearfission. Nuclear fission was the process we learned to use first\u2014in atomic bombs and in\nnuclear reactors used to generate electrical power\u2014and it may therefore be more familiar to you. Fission also\nsometimes occurs spontaneously in some unstable nuclei through the process of natural radioactivity. But\nfission requires big, complex nuclei, whereas we know that the stars are made up predominantly of small,\nsimple nuclei. So we must look to fusion first to explain the energy of the Sun and the stars (Figure 16.5).\nFigure16.5Fusion and Fission.(a) In fusion, light atomic nuclei join together to form a heavier nuclei, releasing energy in the\nprocess. (b) In fission, energy is produced by the breaking up of heavy, complex nuclei into lighter ones.\nNuclear Attraction versus Electrical Repulsion\nSo far, we seem to have a very attractive prescription for producing the energy emitted by the Sun: \u201croll\u201d some\nnuclei together and join them via nuclear fusion. This will cause them to lose some of their mass, which then\nturns into energy. However, every nucleus beyond simple hydrogen has two or more protons\u2014and protons all\nhave positive charges. Since like charges repel via the electrical force, the closer we get two nuclei to each\nother, the more they repel. It\u2019s true that if we can get them within \u201cstriking distance\u201d of the nuclear force, they\nwill then come together with a much stronger attraction. But that striking distance is very tiny, about the size\nAccess for free at openstax.org 16.2 \u2022 Mass, Energy, and the Theory of Relativity 535\nof a nucleus. How can we get nuclei close enough to participate in fusion?\nThe answer turns out to be heat\u2014tremendous heat\u2014which speeds the protons up enough to overcome the\nelectrical forces that try to keep protons apart. Inside the Sun, as we saw, the most common element is\nhydrogen, whose nucleus contains only a single proton. Two protons can fuse only in regions where the\ntemperature is greater than about 12 million K, and the speed of the protons average around 1000 kilometers\nper second or more. (In old-fashioned units, that\u2019s over 2 million miles per hour!)\nIn our Sun, such extreme temperatures are reached only in the regions near its center, which has a\ntemperature of 15 million K. Calculations show that nearly all of the Sun\u2019s energy is generated within about\n150,000 kilometers of its core, or within less than 10% of its total volume.\nEven at these high temperatures, it is exceedingly difficult to force two protons to combine. On average, a\nproton will rebound from other protons in the Sun\u2019s crowded core for about 14 billion years, at the rate of100\nmillion collisions per second, before it fuses with a second proton. This is, however, only theaveragewaiting\ntime. Some of the enormous numbers of protons in the Sun\u2019s inner region are \u201clucky\u201d and take only a few\ncollisions to achieve a fusion reaction: they are the protons responsible for producing the energy radiated by\nthe Sun. Since the Sun is about 4.5 billion years old, most of its protons have not yet been involved in fusion\nreactions.\nNuclear Reactions in the Sun\u2019s Interior\nTheSun, then, taps the energy contained in the nuclei of atoms through nuclearfusion. Let\u2019s look at what\nhappens in more detail. Deep inside the Sun, a three-step process takes four hydrogen nuclei and fuses them\ntogether to form a single helium nucleus. The helium nucleus is slightly less massive than the four hydrogen\nnuclei that combine to form it, and that mass is converted into energy.\nThe initial step required to form one helium nucleus from four hydrogen nuclei is shown inFigure 16.6. At the\nhigh temperatures inside the Sun\u2019s core, two protons combine to make adeuteriumnucleus, which is an\nisotope (or version) of hydrogen that contains one proton and one neutron. In effect, one of the original\nprotons has been converted into a neutron in the fusion reaction. Electric charge has to be conserved in\nnuclear reactions, and it is conserved in this one. Apositron(antimatter electron) emerges from the reaction\nand carries away the positive charge originally associated with one of the protons.\nFigure16.6Proton-Proton Chain, Step 1.This is the first step in the process of fusing hydrogen into helium in the Sun. High\ntemperatures are required because this reaction starts with two hydrogen nuclei, which are protons (shown in blue at left) that must\novercome electrical repulsion to combine, forming a hydrogen nucleus with a proton and a neutron (shown in red). Note that\nhydrogen containing one proton and one neutron is given its own name: deuterium. Also produced in this reaction are a positron,\nwhich is an antielectron, and an elusive particle named the neutrino.\nSince it is antimatter, this positron will instantly collide with a nearby electron, and both will be annihilated,\nproducing electromagnetic energy in the form of gamma-ray photons. This gamma ray, which has been\ncreated in the center of the Sun, finds itself in a world crammed full of fast-moving nuclei and electrons. The\ngamma ray collides with particles of matter and transfers its energy to one of them. The particle later emits\nanother gamma-ray photon, but often the emitted photon has a bit less energy than the one that was\nabsorbed.\nSuch interactions happen to gamma rays again and again and again as they make their way slowly toward the\nouter layers of the Sun, until their energy becomes so reduced that they are no longer gamma rays but X-rays\n(recall what you learned inThe Electromagnetic Spectrum). Later, as the photons lose still more energy 536 16 \u2022 The Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse\nthrough collisions in the crowded center of the Sun, they become ultraviolet photons.\nBy the time they reach the Sun\u2019s surface, most of the photons have given up enough energy to be ordinary\nlight\u2014and they are the sunlight we see coming from our star. (To be precise, each gamma-ray photon is\nultimately converted into many separate lower-energy photons of sunlight.) So, the sunlight given off by the\nSun today had its origin as a gamma ray produced by nuclear reactions deep in the Sun\u2019s core. The length of\ntime that photons require to reach the surface depends on how far a photon on average travels between\ncollisions, and the travel time depends on what model of the complicated solar interior we accept. Estimates\nare somewhat uncertain but indicate that the emission of energy from the surface of the Sun can lag its\nproduction in the interior by 100,000 years to as much as 1,000,000 years.\nIn addition to the positron, the fusion of two hydrogen atoms to form deuterium results in the emission of a\nneutrino. Because neutrinos interact so little with ordinary matter, those produced by fusion reactions near\nthe center of the Sun travel directly to the Sun\u2019s surface and then out into space, in all directions. Neutrinos\nmove at nearly the speed of light, and they escape the Sun about two seconds after they are created.\nFigure16.7Proton-Proton Chain, Step 2.This is the second step of theproton-proton chain, the fusion reaction that converts\nhydrogen into helium in the Sun. This step combines one hydrogen nucleus, which is a proton (shown in blue), with the deuterium\nnucleus from the previous step (shown as a red and blue particle). The product of this is an isotope of helium with two protons (blue)\nand one neutron (red) and energy in the form of gamma-ray radiation.\nThe second step in forming helium from hydrogen is to add another proton to the deuterium nucleus to create\na helium nucleus that contains two protons and one neutron (Figure 16.7). In the process, some mass is again\nlost and more gamma radiation is emitted. Such a nucleus is helium because an element is defined by its\nnumber of protons; any nucleus with two protons is called helium. But this form of helium, which we call\nhelium-3 (and write in shorthand as3He) is not the isotope we see in the Sun\u2019s atmosphere or on Earth. That\nhelium has two neutrons and two protons and hence is called helium-4 (4He).\nTo get to helium-4 in the Sun, helium-3 must combine with another helium-3 in the third step of fusion\n(illustrated inFigure 16.8). Note that two energetic protons are left over from this step; each of them comes\nout of the reaction ready to collide with other protons and to start step 1 in the chain of reactions all over\nagain.\nFigure16.8Proton-Proton Chain, Step 3.This is the third step in the fusion of hydrogen into helium in the Sun. Note that the two\nhelium-3 nuclei from the second step (seeFigure 16.7) must combine before the third step becomes possible. The two protons that\ncome out of this step have the energy to collide with other protons in the Sun and start step one again.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisit theTokamak Fusion Reactor(https://openstax.org/l/30tokamakfusrea)at the General Atomics Lab in\nSan Diego, CA, for an 8-minute tour.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 16.2 \u2022 Mass, Energy, and the Theory of Relativity 537\nThe Proton-Proton Chain\nThe nuclear reactions in the Sun that we have been discussing can be described succinctly through the\nfollowing nuclear formulas:\nHere, the superscripts indicate the total number of neutrons plus protons in the nucleus, e+is the positron,vis\nthe neutrino, and\u03b3indicates that gamma rays are emitted. Note that the third step requires two helium-3\nnuclei to start; the first two steps must happen twice before the third step can occur.\nAlthough, as we discussed, the first step in this chain of reactions is very difficult and generally takes a long\ntime, the other steps happen more quickly. After the deuterium nucleus is formed, it survives an average of\nonly about 6 seconds before being converted into3He. About a million years after that (on average), the3He\nnucleus will combine with another to form4He.\nWe can compute the amount of energy these reactions generate by calculating the difference in the initial and\nfinal masses. The masses of hydrogen and helium atoms in the units normally used by scientists are 1.007825\nuand 4.00268u, respectively. (The unit of mass,u, is defined to be 1/12 the mass of an atom of carbon, or\napproximately the mass of a proton.) Here, we include the mass of the entire atom, not just the nucleus,\nbecause electrons are involved as well. When hydrogen is converted into helium, two positrons are created\n(remember, the first step happens twice), and these are annihilated with two free electrons, adding to the\nenergy produced.\nThe mass lost, 0.02862u, is 0.71% of the mass of the initial hydrogen. Thus, if 1 kilogram of hydrogen is\nconverted into helium, then the mass of the helium is only 0.9929 kilogram, and 0.0071 kilogram of material is\nconverted into energy. The speed of light (c) is 3 \u00d7 108meters per second, so the energy released by the\nconversion of just 1 kilogram of hydrogen into helium is:\nThis amount, the energy released when a single kilogram (2.2 pounds) of hydrogen undergoes fusion, would\nsupply all the electricity used by the typical U.S. household for roughly 17,000 years.\nTo produce the Sun\u2019s luminosity of 4 \u00d7 1026watts, some 600 million tons of hydrogen must be converted into\nheliumeach second, of which about 4 million tons are converted from matter into energy. As large as these\nnumbers are, the store of hydrogen (and thus of nuclear energy) in the Sun is stillmoreenormous, and can\nlast a long time\u2014billions of years, in fact.\nAt the temperatures inside the stars with masses smaller than about 1.2 times the mass of our Sun (a category\nthat includes the Sun itself), most of the energy is produced by the reactions we have just described, and this\nset of reactions is called theproton-proton chain(or sometimes, the p-p chain). In the proton-proton chain,\nprotons collide directly with other protons to form helium nuclei.\nIn hotter stars, another set of reactions, called the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle, accomplishes the\nsame net result. In theCNO cycle, carbon and hydrogen nuclei collide to initiate a series of reactions that form 538 16 \u2022 The Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse\nnitrogen, oxygen, and ultimately, helium. The nitrogen and oxygen nuclei do not survive but interact to form\ncarbon again. Therefore, the outcome is the same as in the proton-proton chain: four hydrogen atoms\ndisappear, and in their place, a single helium atom is created. The CNO cycle plays only a minor role in the Sun\nbut is the main source of energy for stars with masses greater than about the mass of the Sun.\nSo you can see that we have solved the puzzle that so worried scientists at the end of the nineteenth century.\nThe Sun can maintain its high temperature and energy output for billions of years through the fusion of the\nsimplest element in the universe, hydrogen. Because most of the Sun (and the other stars) is made of\nhydrogen, it is an ideal \u201cfuel\u201d for powering a star. As will be discussed in the following chapters, we can define\na star as a ball of gas capable of getting its core hot enough to initiate the fusion of hydrogen. There are balls\nof gas that lack the mass required to do this (Jupiter is a local example); like so many hopefuls in Hollywood,\nthey will never be stars.\nMAKING CONNECTIONS\nFusion on Earth\nWouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if we could duplicate the Sun\u2019s energy mechanism in a controlled way on Earth?\n(We have already duplicated it in an uncontrolled way in hydrogen bombs, but we hope our storehouses of\nthese will never be used.) Fusion energy would have many advantages: it would use hydrogen (or\ndeuterium, which is heavy hydrogen) as fuel, and there is abundant hydrogen in Earth\u2019s lakes and oceans.\nWater is much more evenly distributed around the world than oil or uranium, meaning that a few countries\nwould no longer hold an energy advantage over the others. And unlike fission, which leaves dangerous\nbyproducts, the nuclei that result from fusion are perfectly safe.\nThe problem is that, as we saw, it takes extremely high temperatures for nuclei to overcome their electrical\nrepulsion and undergo fusion. When the first hydrogen bombs were exploded in tests in the 1950s, the\n\u201cfuses\u201d to get them hot enough were fission bombs. Interactions at such temperatures are difficult to\nsustain and control. To make fusion power on Earth, after all, we have to do what the Sun does: produce\ntemperatures and pressures high enough to get hydrogen nuclei on intimate terms with one another.\nThe European Union, the United States, South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, Switzerland, and India are\ncollaborating on theInternational Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), a project to demonstrate\nthe feasibility of controlled fusion (Figure 16.9). The facility is being built in France. Construction will require\nover 10,000,000 components and 2000 workers for assembly. The date for the start of operations is yet to\nbe determined.\nITER is based on the Tokamak design, in which a large doughnut-shaped container is surrounded by\nsuperconducting magnets to confine and control the hydrogen nuclei in a strong magnetic field. Previous\nfusion experiments have produced about 15 million watts of energy, but only for a second or two, and they\nhave required 100 million watts to produce the conditions necessary to achieve fusion. The goal of ITER is to\nbuild the first fusion device capable of producing 500 million watts of fusion energy for up to 1000 seconds.\nThe challenge is keeping the deuterium and tritium\u2014which will participate in fusion reactions\u2014hot enough\nand dense enough, for a long enough time to produce energy.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 16.3 \u2022 The Solar Interior: Theory 539\nFigure16.9ITER Design.The bright yellow areas in this model show where the superconducting magnets will circle the chamber\nwithin which fusion will take place. A huge magnet will keep the charged nuclei of heavy hydrogen confined. The goal is to\nproduce 500 megawatts of energy.

How do we\nknow that the Sun is actually this hot? To determine what the interior of the Sun might be like, it is necessary\nto resort to complex calculations. Since we can\u2019t see the interior of the Sun, we have to use our understanding\nof physics, combined with what we see at the surface, to construct a mathematical model of what must be\nhappening in the interior. Astronomers use observations to build a computer program containing everything\nthey think they know about the physical processes going on in the Sun\u2019s interior. The computer then calculates\nthe temperature and pressure at every point inside the Sun and determines what nuclear reactions, if any, are\ntaking place. For some calculations, we can use observations to determine whether the computer program is\nproducing results that match what we see. In this way, the program evolves with ever-improving observations.\nThe computer program can also calculate how the Sun will change with time. After all, the Sun must change. In\nits center, the Sun is slowly depleting its supply of hydrogen and creating helium instead. Will the Sun get\nhotter? Cooler? Larger? Smaller? Brighter? Fainter? Ultimately, the changes in the center could be\ncatastrophic, since eventually all the hydrogen fuel hot enough for fusion will be exhausted. Either a new\nsource of energy must be found, or the Sun will cease to shine. We will describe the ultimate fate of the Sun in\nlater chapters. For now, let\u2019s look at some of the things we must teach the computer about the Sun in order to\ncarry out such calculations. 540 16 \u2022 The Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse\nThe Sun Is a Plasma\nThe Sun is so hot that all of the material in it is in the form of an ionized gas, called aplasma. Plasma acts\nmuch like a hot gas, which is easier to describe mathematically than either liquids or solids. The particles that\nconstitute a gas are in rapid motion, frequently colliding with one another. This constant bombardment is the\npressureof the gas (Figure 16.10).\nFigure16.10Gas Pressure.The particles in a gas are in rapid motion and produce pressure through collisions with the surrounding\nmaterial. Here, particles are shown bombarding the sides of an imaginary container.\nMore particles within a given volume of gas produce more pressure because the combined impact of the\nmoving particles increases with their number. The pressure is also greater when the molecules or atoms are\nmoving faster. Since the molecules move faster when the temperature is hotter, higher temperatures produce\nhigher pressure.\nThe Sun Is Stable\nThe Sun, like the majority of other stars, is stable; it is neither expanding nor contracting. Such a star is said to\nbe in a condition ofequilibrium. All the forces within it are balanced, so that at each point within the star, the\ntemperature, pressure, density, and so on are maintained at constant values. We will see in later chapters that\neven these stable stars, including the Sun, are changing as they evolve, but such evolutionary changes are so\ngradual that, for all intents and purposes, the stars are still in a state of equilibrium at any given time.\nThe mutual gravitational attraction between the masses of various regions within the Sun produces\ntremendous forces that tend to collapse the Sun toward its center. Yet we know from the history of Earth that\nthe Sun has been emitting roughly the same amount of energy for billions of years, so clearly it has managed\nto resist collapse for a very long time. The gravitational forces must therefore be counterbalanced by some\nother force. That force is due to the pressure of gases within the Sun (Figure 16.11). Calculations show that, in\norder to exert enough pressure to prevent the Sun from collapsing due to the force of gravity, the gases at its\ncenter must be maintained at a temperature of 15 million K. Think about what this tells us. Just from the fact\nthat the Sun is not contracting, we can conclude that its temperature must indeed be high enough at the\ncenter for protons to undergo fusion.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 16.3 \u2022 The Solar Interior: Theory 541\nFigure16.11Hydrostatic Equilibrium.In the interior of a star, the inward force of gravity is exactly balanced at each point by the\noutward force of gas pressure.\nThe Sun maintains its stability in the following way. If the internal pressure in such a star were not great\nenough to balance the weight of its outer parts, the star would collapse somewhat, contracting and building\nup the pressure inside. On the other hand, if the pressure were greater than the weight of the overlying layers,\nthe star would expand, thus decreasing the internal pressure. Expansion would stop, and equilibrium would\nagain be reached when the pressure at every internal point equaled the weight of the stellar layers above that\npoint. An analogy is an inflated balloon, which will expand or contract until an equilibrium is reached between\nthe pressure of the air inside and outside. The technical term for this condition ishydrostatic equilibrium.\nStable stars are all in hydrostatic equilibrium; so are the oceans of Earth as well as Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The\nair\u2019s own pressure keeps it from falling to the ground.\nThe Sun Is Not Cooling Down\nAs everyone who has ever left a window open on a cold winter night knows, heat always flows from hotter to\ncooler regions. As energy filters outward toward the surface of a star, it must be flowing from inner, hotter\nregions. The temperature cannot ordinarily get cooler as we go inward in a star, or energy would flow in and\nheat up those regions until they were at least as hot as the outer ones. Scientists conclude that the\ntemperature is highest at the center of a star, dropping to lower and lower values toward the stellar surface.\n(The high temperature of the Sun\u2019s chromosphere and corona may therefore appear to be a paradox. But\nremember fromThe Sun: A Garden-Variety Starthat these high temperatures are maintained by magnetic\neffects, which occur in the Sun\u2019s atmosphere.)\nThe outward flow of energy through a star robs it of its internal heat, and the star would cool down if that\nenergy were not replaced. Similarly, a hot iron begins to cool as soon as it is unplugged from its source of\nelectric energy. Therefore, a source of fresh energy must exist within each star. In the Sun\u2019s case, we have\nseen that this energy source is the ongoing fusion of hydrogen to form helium.\nHeat Transfer in a Star\nSince the nuclear reactions that generate the Sun\u2019s energy occur deep within it, the energy must be\ntransported from the center of the Sun to its surface\u2014where we see it in the form of both heat and light.\nThere are three ways in which energy can be transferred from one place to another. Inconduction, atoms or\nmolecules pass on their energy by colliding with others nearby. This happens, for example, when the handle of\na metal spoon heats up as you stir a cup of hot coffee. Inconvection, currents of warm material rise, carrying\ntheir energy with them to cooler layers. A good example is hot air rising from a fireplace. Inradiation,\nenergetic photons move away from hot material and are absorbed by some material to which they convey 542 16 \u2022 The Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse\nsome or all of their energy. You can feel this when you put your hand close to the coils of an electric heater,\nallowing infrared photons to heat up your hand. Conduction and convection are both important in the\ninteriors of planets. In stars, which are much more transparent, radiation and convection are important,\nwhereas conduction can usually be ignored.\nStellarconvectionoccurs as currents of hot gas flow up and down through the star (Figure 16.12). Such\ncurrents travel at moderate speeds and do not upset the overall stability of the star. They don\u2019t even result in a\nnet transfer of mass either inward or outward because, as hot material rises, cool material falls and replaces it.\nThis results in a convective circulation of rising and falling cells as seen inFigure 16.12. In much the same way,\nheat from a fireplace can stir up air currents in a room, some rising and some falling, without driving any air\ninto or out the room. Convection currents carry heat very efficiently outward through a star. In the Sun,\nconvection turns out to be important in the central regions and near the surface.\nFigure16.12Convection.Rising convection currents carry heat from the Sun\u2019s interior to its surface, whereas cooler material sinks\ndownward. Of course, nothing in a real star is as simple as diagrams in textbooks suggest.\nUnless convection occurs, the only significant mode of energy transport through a star is by electromagnetic\nradiation. Radiation is not an efficient means of energy transport in stars because gases in stellar interiors are\nvery opaque, that is, a photon does not go far (in the Sun, typically about 0.01 meter) before it is absorbed.\n(The processes by which atoms and ions can interrupt the outward flow of photons\u2014such as becoming\nionized\u2014were discussed in the section on theFormation of Spectral Lines.) The absorbed energy is always\nreemitted, but it can be reemitted in any direction. A photon absorbed when traveling outward in a star has\nalmost as good a chance of being radiated back toward the center of the star as toward its surface.\nA particular quantity of energy, therefore, zigzags around in an almost random manner and takes a long time\nto work its way from the center of a star to its surface (Figure 16.13). Estimates are somewhat uncertain, but in\nthe Sun, as we saw, the time required is probably between 100,000 and 1,000,000 years. If the photons were\nnot absorbed and reemitted along the way, they would travel at the speed of light and could reach the surface\nin a little over 2 seconds, just as neutrinos do (Figure 16.14).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 16.3 \u2022 The Solar Interior: Theory 543\nFigure16.13Photons Deep in the Sun.A photon moving through the dense gases in the solar interior travels only a short distance\nbefore it interacts with one of the surrounding atoms. The resulting photon usually has a lower energy after each interaction and\nmay then travel in any random direction.\nFigure16.14Photon and Neutrino Paths in the Sun.(a) Because photons generated by fusion reactions in the solar interior travel\nonly a short distance before being absorbed or scattered by atoms and sent off in random directions, estimates are that it takes\nbetween 100,000 and 1,000,000 years for energy to make its way from the center of the Sun to its surface. (b) In contrast, neutrinos\ndo not interact with matter but traverse straight through the Sun at the speed of light, reaching the surface in only a little more than\n2 seconds.\nMAKING CONNECTIONS\nHeat Transfer and Cooking\nThe three ways that heat energy moves from higher-temperature regions to cooler regions are all used in\ncooking, and this is important to all of us who enjoy making or eating food.\nConduction isheat transferby physical contact during which the energetic motion of particles in one region\nspread to other regions and even to adjacent objects in close contact. A tasty example of this is cooking a\nsteak on a hot iron skillet. When a flame makes the bottom of a skillet hot, the particles in it vibrate actively\nand collide with neighboring particles, spreading the heat energy throughout the skillet (the ability to\nspread heat uniformly is a key criterion for selecting materials for cookware). A steak sitting on the surface\nof the skillet picks up heat energy by the particles in the surface of the skillet colliding with particles on the\nsurface of the steak. Many cooks will put a little oil on the pan, and this layer of oil, besides preventing\nsticking, increases heat transfer by filling in gaps and increasing the contact surface area. 544 16 \u2022 The Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse\nConvection is heat transfer by the motion of matter that rises because it is hot and less dense. Heating a\nfluid makes it expand, which makes it less dense, so it rises. An oven is a great example of this: the fire is at\nthe bottom of the oven and heats the air down there, causing it to expand (becoming less dense), so it rises\nup to where the food is. The rising hot air carries the heat from the fire to the food by convection. This is\nhow conventional ovens work. You may also be familiar withconvectionovens that use a fan to circulate\nhot air for more even cooking. A scientist would object to that name because normal non-fan ovens that\nrely on hot air rising to circulate the heat are convection ovens; technically, the ovens that use fans to help\nmove heat are \u201cadvection\u201d ovens. (You may not have heard about this because the scientists who complain\nloudly about misusing the terms convection and advection don\u2019t get out much.)\nRadiation is the transfer of heat energy by electromagnetic radiation. Although microwave ovens are an\nobvious example of using radiation to heat food, a simpler example is a toy oven. Toy ovens are powered by\na very bright light bulb. The child-chefs prepare a mix for brownies or cookies, put it into a tray, and place it\nin the toy oven under the bright light bulb. The light and heat from the bulb hit the brownie mix and cook it.\nIf you have ever put your hand near a bright light, you have undoubtedly noticed your hand getting\nwarmed by the light.\nModel Stars\nScientists use the principles we have just described to calculate what the Sun\u2019s interior is like. These physical\nideas are expressed as mathematical equations that are solved to determine the values of temperature,\npressure, density, the efficiency with which photons are absorbed, and other physical quantities throughout\nthe Sun. The solutions obtained, based on a specific set of physical assumptions, provide a theoretical model\nfor the interior of the Sun.\nFigure 16.15schematically illustrates the predictions of a theoretical model for the Sun\u2019s interior. Energy is\ngenerated through fusion in the core of the Sun, which extends only about one-quarter of the way to the\nsurface but contains about one-third of the total mass of the Sun. At the center, the temperature reaches a\nmaximum of approximately 15 million K, and the density is nearly 150 times that of water. The energy\ngenerated in the core is transported toward the surface by radiation until it reaches a point about 70% of the\ndistance from the center to the surface. At this point, convection begins, and energy is transported the rest of\nthe way, primarily by rising columns of hot gas.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 16.4 \u2022 The Solar Interior: Observations 545\nFigure16.15Interior Structure of the Sun.Energy is generated in the core by the fusion of hydrogen to form helium. This energy is\ntransmitted outward by radiation\u2014that is, by the absorption and reemission of photons. In the outermost layers, energy is\ntransported mainly by convection. (credit: modification of work by NASA/Goddard)\nFigure 16.16shows how the temperature, density, rate of energy generation, and composition vary from the\ncenter of the Sun to its surface.\nFigure16.16Interior of the Sun.Diagrams showing how temperature, density, rate of energy generation, and the percentage (by\nmass) abundance of hydrogen vary inside the Sun. The horizontal scale shows the fraction of the Sun\u2019s radius: the left edge is the\nvery center, and the right edge is the visible surface of the Sun, which is called the photosphere.\n16.4 The Solar Interior: Observations\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain how the Sun pulsates\nExplain what helioseismology is and what it can tell us about the solar interior\nDiscuss how studying neutrinos from the Sun has helped understand neutrinos 546 16 \u2022 The Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse\nRecall that when we observe theSun\u2019s photosphere (the surface layer we see from the outside), we are not\nseeing very deeply into our star, certainly not into the regions where energy is generated. That\u2019s why the title\nof this section\u2014observations of thesolar interior\u2014should seem very surprising. However, astronomers have\nindeed devised two types of measurements that can be used to obtain information about the inner parts of\nthe Sun. One technique involves the analysis of tiny changes in the motion of small regions at the Sun\u2019s\nsurface. The other relies on the measurement of the neutrinos emitted by the Sun.\nSolar Pulsations\nAstronomers discovered that the Sun pulsates\u2014that is, it alternately expands and contracts\u2014just as your\nchest expands and contracts as you breathe. This pulsation is very slight, but it can be detected by measuring\ntheradial velocityof the solar surface\u2014the speed with which it moves toward or away from us. The velocities\nof small regions on the Sun are observed to change in a regular way, first toward Earth, then away, then\ntoward, and so on. It is as if the Sun were \u201cbreathing\u201d through thousands of individual lungs, each having a\nsize in the range of 4000 to 15,000 kilometers, each fluctuating back and forth (Figure 16.17).\nFigure16.17Oscillations in the Sun.New observational techniques permit astronomers to measure small differences in velocity at\nthe Sun\u2019s surface to infer what the deep solar interior is like. In this computer simulation, red shows surface regions that are moving\naway from the observer (inward motion); blue marks regions moving toward the observer (outward motion). Note that the velocity\nchanges penetrate deep into the Sun\u2019s interior. (credit: modification of work by GONG, NOAO)\nThe typical velocity of one of the oscillating regions on the Sun is only a few hundred meters per second, and it\ntakes about 5 minutes to complete a full cycle from maximum to minimum velocity and back again. The\nchange in the size of the Sun measured at any given point is no more than a few kilometers.\nThe remarkable thing is that these small velocity variations can be used to determine what the interior of the\nSun is like. The motion of the Sun\u2019s surface is caused by waves that reach it from deep in the interior. Study of\nthe amplitude and cycle length of velocity changes provides information about the temperature, density, and\ncomposition of the layers through which the waves passed before they reached the surface. The situation is\nsomewhat analogous to the use of seismic waves generated by earthquakes to infer the properties of Earth\u2019s\ninterior. For this reason, studies of solar oscillations (back-and-forth motions) are referred to as\nhelioseismology.\nIt takes a little over an hour for waves to traverse the Sun from center to surface, so the waves, like neutrinos,\nprovide information about what the solar interior is like at the present time. In contrast, remember that the\nsunlight we see today emerging from the Sun was actually generated in the core several hundred thousand\nyears ago.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 16.4 \u2022 The Solar Interior: Observations 547\nHelioseismology has shown that convection extends inward from the surface 30% of the way toward the\ncenter; we have used this information in drawingFigure 16.15. Pulsation measurements also show that the\ndifferential rotationthat we see at the Sun\u2019s surface, with the fastest rotation occurring at the equator,\npersists down through the convection zone. Below the convection zone, however, the Sun, even though it is\ngaseous throughout, rotates as if it were a solid body like a bowling ball. Another finding from helioseismology\nis that the abundance of helium inside the Sun, except in the center where nuclear reactions have converted\nhydrogen into helium, is about the same as at its surface. That result is important to astronomers because it\nmeans we are correct when we use the abundance of the elements measured in the solar atmosphere to\nconstruct models of the solar interior.\nHelioseismology also allows scientists to look beneath asunspotand see how it works. InThe Sun: A Garden-\nVariety Star, we said that sunspots are cool because strong magnetic fields block the outward flow of energy.\nFigure 16.18shows how gas moves around underneath a sunspot. Cool material from the sunspot flows\ndownward, and material surrounding the sunspot is pulled inward, carrying magnetic field with it and thus\nmaintaining the strong field that is necessary to form a sunspot. As the new material enters the sunspot\nregion, it too cools, becomes denser, and sinks, thus setting up a self-perpetuating cycle that can last for\nweeks.\nFigure16.18Sunspot Structure.This drawing shows our new understanding, from helioseismology, of what lies beneath a sunspot.\nThe black arrows show the direction of the flow of material. The intense magnetic field associated with the sunspot stops the upward\nflow of hot material and creates a kind of plug that blocks the hot gas. As the material above the plug cools (shown in blue), it\nbecomes denser and plunges inward, drawing more gas and more magnetic field behind it into the spot. The concentrated magnetic\nfield causes more cooling, thereby setting up a self-perpetuating cycle that allows a spot to survive for several weeks. Since the plug\nkeeps hot material from flowing up into the sunspot, the region below the plug, represented by red in this picture, becomes hotter.\nThis material flows sideways and then upward, eventually reaching the solar surface in the area surrounding the sunspot. (credit:\nmodification of work by NASA, SDO)\nThe downward-flowing cool material acts as a kind of plug that block the upward flow of hot material, which is\nthen diverted sideways and eventually reaches the solar surface in the region around the sunspot. This\noutward flow of hot material accounts for the paradox that we described inThe Sun: A Garden-Variety\nStar\u2014namely, that the Sun emits slightly more energy when more of its surface is covered by cool sunspots.\nHelioseismology has become an important tool for predicting solar storms that might impact Earth. Active\nregions can appear and grow large in only a few days. The solar rotation period is about 28 days. Therefore,\nregions capable of producingsolar flares andcoronal mass ejections can develop on the far side of the Sun,\nwhere, for a long time, we couldn\u2019t see them directly.\nFortunately, we now have space telescopes monitoring the Sun from all angles, so we know if there are 548 16 \u2022 The Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse\nsunspots forming on the opposite side of the Sun. Moreover, sound waves travel slightly faster in regions of\nhigh magnetic field, and waves generated in active regions traverse the Sun about 6 seconds faster than\nwaves generated in quiet regions. By detecting this subtle difference, scientists can provide warnings of a\nweek or more to operators of electric utilities and satellites about when a potentially dangerous active region\nmight rotate into view. With this warning, it is possible to plan for disruptions, put key instruments into safe\nmode, or reschedule spacewalks in order to protect astronauts.\nSolar Neutrinos\nThe second technique for obtaining information about the Sun\u2019s interior involves the detection of a few of\nthose elusive neutrinos created during nuclear fusion. Recall from our earlier discussion that neutrinos\ncreated in the center of the Sun make their way directly out of the Sun and travel to Earth at nearly the speed\nof light. As far as neutrinos are concerned, the Sun is transparent.\nAbout 3% of the total energy generated by nuclear fusion in the Sun is carried away by neutrinos. So many\nprotons react and form neutrinos inside the Sun\u2019s core that, scientists calculate, 35 million billion (3.5 \u00d7 1016)\nsolar neutrinos pass through each square meter of Earth\u2019s surface every second. If we can devise a way to\ndetect even a few of these solar neutrinos, then we can obtain information directly about what is going on in\nthe center of the Sun. Unfortunately for those trying to \u201ccatch\u201d some neutrinos, Earth and everything on it are\nalso nearly transparent to passing neutrinos, just like the Sun.\nOn very, very rare occasions, however, one of the billions and billions of solar neutrinos will interact with\nanother atom. The first successful detection of solar neutrinos made use of cleaning fluid (C Cl ), which is the\n2 4\nleast expensive way to get a lot of chlorine atoms together. The nucleus of a chlorine (Cl) atom in the cleaning\nfluid can be turned into a radioactive argon nucleus by an interaction with aneutrino. Because the argon is\nradioactive, its presence can be detected. However, since the interaction of a neutrino with chlorine happens\nso rarely, a huge amount of chlorine is needed.\nRaymondDavis, Jr. (Figure 16.19) and his colleagues atBrookhaven National Laboratory, placed a tank\ncontaining nearly 400,000 liters of cleaning fluid 1.5 kilometers beneath Earth\u2019s surface in a gold mine at Lead,\nSouth Dakota. A mine was chosen so that the surrounding material of Earth would keep cosmic rays (high-\nenergy particles from space) from reaching the cleaning fluid and creating false signals. (Cosmic-ray particles\nare stopped by thick layers of Earth, but neutrinos find them of no significance.) Calculations show that solar\nneutrinos should produce about one atom of radioactive argon in the tank each day.\nFigure16.19Davis Experiment.(a) Raymond Davis received the Nobel Prize in physics in 2002. (b) Davis\u2019 experiment at the bottom\nof an abandoned gold mine first revealed problems with our understanding of neutrinos. (credit a: modification of work by\nBrookhaven National Laboratory; credit b: modification of work by the United States Department of Energy)\nThis was an amazing project: they counted argon atoms about once per month\u2014and remember, they were\nlooking for a tiny handful of argon atoms in a massive tank of chlorine atoms. When all was said and done,\nAccess for free at openstax.org 16.4 \u2022 The Solar Interior: Observations 549\nDavis\u2019 experiment, begun in 1970, detected only about one-third as many neutrinos as predicted by solar\nmodels! This was a shocking result because astronomers thought they had a pretty good understanding of\nboth neutrinos and the Sun\u2019s interior. For many years, astronomers and physicists wrestled with Davis\u2019 results,\ntrying to find a way out of the dilemma of the \u201cmissing\u201d neutrinos.\nEventually Davis\u2019 result was explained by the surprising discovery that there are actually three types of\nneutrinos. Solar fusion produces only one type ofneutrino, the so-called electron neutrino, and the initial\nexperiments to detect solar neutrinos were designed to detect this one type. Subsequent experiments showed\nthat these neutrinos change to a different type during their journey from the center of the Sun through space\nto Earth in a process calledneutrino oscillation.\nAn experiment, conducted at theSudbury Neutrino Observatoryin Canada, was the first one designed to\ncapture all three types of neutrinos (Figure 16.20). The experiment was located in a mine 2 kilometers\nunderground. The neutrino detector consisted of a 12-meter-diameter transparent acrylic plastic sphere,\nwhich contained 1000 metric tons of heavy water. Remember that an ordinary water nucleus contains two\nhydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Heavy water instead contains two deuterium atoms and one oxygen\natom, and incoming neutrinos can occasionally break up the loosely bound proton and neutron that make up\nthe deuterium nucleus. The sphere of heavy water was surrounded by a shield of 1700 metric tons of very pure\nwater, which in turn was surrounded by 9600 photomultipliers, devices that detect flashes of light produced\nafter neutrinos interact with the heavy water.\nFigure16.20Sudbury Neutrino Detector.The 12-meter sphere of the Sudbury Neutrino Detector lies more than 2 kilometers\nunderground and holds 1000 metric tons of heavy water. (credit: A.B. McDonald (Queen\u2019s University) et al., The Sudbury Neutrino\nObservatory Institute)\nTo the enormous relief of astronomers who make models of the Sun, the Sudbury experiment detected about\n1 neutrino per hour and has shown that thetotalnumber of neutrinos reaching the heavy water is just what\nsolar models predict. Only one-third of these, however, are electron neutrinos. It appears that two-thirds of\nthe electron neutrinos produced by the Sun transform themselves into one of the other types of neutrinos as\nthey make their way from the core of the Sun to Earth. This is why the earlier experiments saw only one-third\nthe number of neutrinos expected.\nAlthough it is not intuitively obvious, such neutrino oscillations can happen only if the mass of the electron\nneutrino is not zero. Other experiments indicate that its mass is tiny (even compared to the electron). The 2015\nNobel Prize in physics was awarded to researchers TakaakiKajitaand Arthur B.McDonaldfor their work\nestablishing the changeable nature of neutrinos. (RaymondDavisshared the 2002 Nobel Prize with Japan\u2019s\nMasatoshiKoshibafor the experiments that led to our understanding of the neutrino problem in the first 550 16 \u2022 The Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse\nplace.) But the fact that the neutrino has mass at all has deep implications for both physics and astronomy. For\nexample, we will look at the role that neutrinos play in the inventory of the mass of the universe inThe Big\nBang.\nTheBorexino experiment, an international experiment conducted in Italy, detected neutrinos coming from the\nSun that were identified as coming from different reactions. Whereas the p-p chain is the reaction producing\nmost of the Sun\u2019s energy, it is not the only nuclear reaction occurring in the Sun\u2019s core. There are side\nreactions involving nuclei of such elements as beryllium and boron. By probing the number of neutrinos that\ncome from each reaction, the Borexino experiment has helped us confirm in detail our understanding of\nnuclear fusion in the Sun. In 2014, the Borexino experiment also identified neutrinos that were produced by\nthe first step in the p-p chain, confirming the models of solar astronomers.\nIn 2020, scientists with the Borexino experiment were also able to identify neutrinos coming specifically from\nthe CNO cycle of nuclear fusion. As discussed toward the end ofTelescopes Today, CNO fusion plays a very\nminor role in the Sun, but becomes important in stars that are more massive and hotter than the Sun.\nIt\u2019s amazing that a series of experiments that began with enough cleaning fluid to fill a swimming pool\nbrought down the shafts of an old gold mine is now teaching us about the energy source of the Sun and the\nproperties of matter! This is a good example of how experiments in astronomy and physics, coupled with the\nbest theoretical models we can devise, continue to lead to fundamental changes in our understanding of\nnature.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 16 \u2022 Key Terms 551\nKey Terms\nconduction process by which heat is directly transmitted through a substance when there is a difference of\ntemperature between adjoining regions caused by atomic or molecular collisions\nconvection movement caused within a gas or liquid by the tendency of hotter, and therefore less dense\nmaterial, to rise and colder, denser material to sink under the influence of gravity, which consequently\nresults in transfer of heat\nfission breaking up of heavier atomic nuclei into lighter ones\nfusion building up of heavier atomic nuclei from lighter ones\nhelioseismology study of pulsations or oscillations of the Sun in order to determine the characteristics of the\nsolar interior\nhydrostatic equilibrium balance between the weights of various layers, as in a star or Earth\u2019s atmosphere,\nand the pressures that support them\nneutrino fundamental particle that has no charge and a mass that is tiny relative to an electron; it rarely\ninteracts with ordinary matter and comes in three different types\npositron particle with the same mass as an electron, but positively charged\nproton-proton chain series of thermonuclear reactions by which nuclei of hydrogen are built up into nuclei\nof helium\nradiation emission of energy as electromagnetic waves or photons also the transmitted energy itself\nSummary\n16.1Sources of Sunshine: Thermal and Gravitational Energy\nThe Sun produces an enormous amount of energy every second. Since Earth and the solar system are roughly\n4.5 billion years old, this means that the Sun has been producing vast amounts for energy for a very, very long\ntime. Neither chemical burning nor gravitational contraction can account for the total amount of energy\nradiated by the Sun during all this time.\n16.2Mass, Energy, and the Theory of Relativity\nSolar energy is produced by interactions of particles\u2014that is, protons, neutrons, electrons, positrons, and\nneutrinos. Specifically, the source of the Sun\u2019s energy is the fusion of hydrogen to form helium. The series of\nreactions required to convert hydrogen to helium is called the proton-proton chain. A helium atom is about\n0.71% less massive than the four hydrogen atoms that combine to form it, and that lost mass is converted to\nenergy (with the amount of energy given by the formulaE=mc2).\n16.3The Solar Interior: Theory\nEven though we cannot see inside the Sun, it is possible to calculate what its interior must be like. As input for\nthese calculations, we use what we know about the Sun. It is made entirely of hot gas. Apart from some very\ntiny changes, the Sun is neither expanding nor contracting (it is in hydrostatic equilibrium) and puts out\nenergy at a constant rate. Fusion of hydrogen occurs in the center of the Sun, and the energy generated is\ncarried to the surface by radiation and then convection. A solar model describes the structure of the Sun\u2019s\ninterior. Specifically, it describes how pressure, temperature, mass, and luminosity depend on the distance\nfrom the center of the Sun.\n16.4The Solar Interior: Observations\nStudies of solar oscillations (helioseismology) and neutrinos can provide observational data about the Sun\u2019s\ninterior. The technique of helioseismology has so far shown that the composition of the interior is much like\nthat of the surface (except in the core, where some of the original hydrogen has been converted into helium),\nand that the convection zone extends about 30% of the way from the Sun\u2019s surface to its center.\nHelioseismology can also detect active regions on the far side of the Sun and provide better predictions of 552 16 \u2022 For Further Exploration\nsolar storms that may affect Earth. Neutrinos from the Sun call tell us about what is happening in the solar\ninterior. A recent experiment has shown that solar models do predict accurately the number of electron\nneutrinos produced by nuclear reactions in the core of the Sun. However, two-thirds of these neutrinos are\nconverted into different types of neutrinos during their long journey from the Sun to Earth, a result that also\nindicates that neutrinos are not massless particles.\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nHarvey, J. et al. \u201cGONG: To See Inside Our Sun.\u201dSky & Telescope(November 1987): 470.\nHathaway, D. \u201cJourney to the Heart of the Sun.\u201dAstronomy(January 1995): 38.\nKennedy, J. \u201cGONG: Probing the Sun\u2019s Hidden Heart.\u201dSky & Telescope(October 1996): 20.

Solar astronomers can learn more about the Sun\u2019s interior if they can observe the Sun\u2019s oscillations 24\nhours each day. This means that they cannot have their observations interrupted by the day/night cycle.\nSuch an experiment, called the GONG (Global Oscillation Network Group) project, was first set up in the\n1990s. To save money, this experiment was designed to make use of the minimum possible number of\ntelescopes.

When Raymond Davis first suggested his experiment in the underground gold mine, which had significant\ncosts associated with it, some people said it wasn\u2019t worth the expense since we already understood the\nconditions and reactions in the core of the Sun.

Estimate the amount of mass that is converted to energy when a proton combines with a deuterium\nnucleus to form3He.\n30. How much energy is released when a proton combines with a deuterium nucleus to produce3He?\n31. The Sun converts 4 \u00d7 109kg of mass to energy every second. How many years would it take the Sun to\nconvert a mass equal to the mass of Earth to energy?\n32. Assume that the mass of the Sun is 75% hydrogen and that all of this mass could be converted to energy\naccording to Einstein\u2019s equationE=mc2. How much total energy could the Sun generate? Ifmis in kg and\ncis in m/s, thenEwill be expressed in J. (The mass of the Sun is given inAppendix E.)\n33. In fact, the conversion of mass to energy in the Sun is not 100% efficient. As we have seen in the text, the\nconversion of four hydrogen atoms to one helium atom results in the conversion of about 0.02862 times\nthe mass of a proton to energy. How much energy in joules does one such reaction produce? (See\nAppendix Efor the mass of the hydrogen atom, which, for all practical purposes, is the mass of a proton.)\n34. Now suppose that all of the hydrogen atoms in the Sun were converted into helium. How much total\nenergy would be produced? (To calculate the answer, you will have to estimate how many hydrogen\natoms are in the Sun. This will give you good practice with scientific notation, since the numbers involved\nare very large! SeeAppendix Cfor a review of scientific notation.)\n35. Models of the Sun indicate that only about 10% of the total hydrogen in the Sun will participate in nuclear\nreactions, since it is only the hydrogen in the central regions that is at a high enough temperature. Use the\ntotal energy radiated per second by the Sun, 3.8 \u00d7 1026watts, alongside the exercises and information\ngiven here to estimate the lifetime of the Sun.

You should convert the\nanswer to something more meaningful, such as years.)\n36. Show that the statement in the text is correct: namely, that roughly 600 million tons of hydrogen must be\nconverted to helium in the Sun each second to explain its energy output.

Earlier, we saw that the Sun puts out a tremendous amount of energy\nevery second. (And there are stars far more luminous than the Sun out there.) To make the comparison among\nstars easy, astronomers express the luminosity of other stars in terms of the Sun\u2019s luminosity. For example,\nthe luminosity ofSiriusis about 25 times that of the Sun. We use the symbolL to denote the Sun\u2019s\nSun\nluminosity; hence, that of Sirius can be written as 25L . In a later chapter, we will see that if we can measure\nSun\nhow much energy a star emits and we also know its mass, then we can calculate how long it can continue to\nshine before it exhausts its nuclear energy and begins to die.\nApparent Brightness\nAstronomers are careful to distinguish between the luminosity of the star (the total energy output) and the\namount of energy that happens to reach our eyes or a telescope on Earth. Stars are democratic in how they\nproduce radiation; they emit the same amount of energy in every direction in space. Consequently, only a\nminuscule fraction of the energy given off by a star actually reaches an observer on Earth. We call the amount\nof a star\u2019s energy that reaches a given area (say, one square meter) each second here on Earth itsapparent\nbrightness. If you look at the night sky, you see a wide range of apparent brightnesses among the stars. Most\nstars, in fact, are so dim that you need a telescope to detect them.\nIf all stars were the same luminosity\u2014if they were like standard bulbs with the same light output\u2014we could\nuse the difference in their apparent brightnesses to tell us something we very much want to know: how far\naway they are. Imagine you are in a big concert hall or ballroom that is dark except for a few dozen 25-watt\nbulbs placed in fixtures around the walls. Since they are all 25-watt bulbs, their luminosity (energy output) is\nthe same. But from where you are standing in one corner, they donothave the same apparent brightness.\nThose close to you appear brighter (more of their light reaches your eye), whereas those far away appear\ndimmer (their light has spread out more before reaching you). In this way, you can tell which bulbs are closest\nto you. In the same way, if all the stars had the same luminosity, we could immediately infer that the brightest-\nappearing stars were close by and the dimmest-appearing ones were far away.\nTo pin down this idea more precisely, recall from theRadiation and Spectrachapter that we know exactly how\nlight fades with increasing distance. The energy we receive is inversely proportional to the square of the\ndistance. If, for example, we have two stars of the same luminosity and one is twice as far away as the other, it\nwill look four times dimmer than the closer one. If it is three times farther away, it will look nine (three\nsquared) times dimmer, and so forth.\nAlas, the stars do not all have the same luminosity. (Actually, we are pretty glad about that because having\nmany different types of stars makes the universe a much more interesting place.) But this means that if a star\nlooks dim in the sky, we cannot tell whether it appears dim because it has a low luminosity but is relatively\nnearby, or because it has a high luminosity but is very far away. To measure the luminosities of stars, we must\nfirst compensate for the dimming effects of distance on light, and to do that, we must know how far away they\nare. Distance is among the most difficult of all astronomical measurements. We will return to how it is\ndetermined after we have learned more about the stars. For now, we will describe how astronomers specify\nthe apparent brightness of stars.\nThe Magnitude Scale\nThe process of measuring the apparent brightness of stars is calledphotometry(from the Greekphoto\nmeaning \u201clight\u201d and \u2013metrymeaning \u201cto measure\u201d). As we sawObserving the Sky: The Birth of Astronomy,\nastronomical photometry began withHipparchus. Around 150 B.C.E., he erected an observatory on the island\nof Rhodes in the Mediterranean. There he prepared a catalog of nearly 1000 stars that included not only their\npositions but also estimates of their apparent brightnesses.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 17.1 \u2022 The Brightness of Stars 559\nHipparchus did not have a telescope or any instrument that could measure apparent brightness accurately, so\nhe simply made estimates with his eyes. He sorted the stars into six brightness categories, each of which he\ncalled amagnitude. He referred to the brightest stars in his catalog as first-magnitudes stars, whereas those\nso faint he could barely see them were sixth-magnitude stars. During the nineteenth century, astronomers\nattempted to make the scale more precise by establishing exactly how much the apparent brightness of a\nsixth-magnitude star differs from that of a first-magnitude star. Measurements showed that we receive about\n100 times more light from a first-magnitude star than from a sixth-magnitude star. Based on this\nmeasurement, astronomers then defined an accurate magnitude system in which a difference of five\nmagnitudes corresponds exactly to a brightness ratio of 100:1. In addition, the magnitudes of stars are\ndecimalized; for example, a star isn\u2019t just a \u201csecond-magnitude star,\u201d it has a magnitude of 2.0 (or 2.1, 2.3, and\nso forth). So what number is it that, when multiplied together five times, gives you this factor of 100? Play on\nyour calculator and see if you can get it. The answer turns out to be about 2.5, which is the fifth root of 100.\nThis means that a magnitude 1.0 star and a magnitude 2.0 star differ in brightness by a factor of about 2.5.\nLikewise, we receive about 2.5 times as much light from a magnitude 2.0 star as from a magnitude 3.0 star.\nWhat about the difference between a magnitude 1.0 star and a magnitude 3.0 star? Since the difference is 2.5\ntimes for each \u201cstep\u201d of magnitude, the total difference in brightness is 2.5 \u00d7 2.5 = 6.25 times.\nHere are a few rules of thumb that might help those new to this system. If two stars differ by 0.75 magnitudes,\nthey differ by a factor of about 2 in brightness. If they are 2.5 magnitudes apart, they differ in brightness by a\nfactor of 10, and a 4-magnitude difference corresponds to a difference in brightness of a factor of 40.You\nmight be saying to yourself at this point, \u201cWhy do astronomers continue to use this complicated system from\nmore than 2000 years ago?\u201d That\u2019s an excellent question and, as we shall discuss, astronomers today can use\nother ways of expressing how bright a star looks. But because this system is still used in many books, star\ncharts, and computer apps, we felt we had to introduce students to it (even though we were very tempted to\nleave it out.)\nThe brightest stars, those that were traditionally referred to as first-magnitude stars, actually turned out\n(when measured accurately) not to be identical in brightness. For example, the brightest star in the sky,Sirius,\nsends us about 10 times as much light as the average first-magnitude star. On the modern magnitude scale,\nSirius, the star with the brightest apparent magnitude, has been assigned a magnitude of \u22121.5. Other objects\nin the sky can appear even brighter.Venusat its brightest is of magnitude \u22124.4, while the Sun has a magnitude\nof \u221226.8.Figure 17.2shows the range of observed magnitudes from the brightest to the faintest, along with\nthe actual magnitudes of several well-known objects. The important fact to remember when using magnitude\nis that the system goes backward: thelargerthe magnitude, thefainterthe object you are observing.\nFigure17.2Apparent Magnitudes of Well-Known Objects.The faintestmagnitudes that can be detected by the unaided eye,\nbinoculars, and large telescopes are also shown. 560 17 \u2022 Analyzing Starlight\nEXAMPLE 17.1\nThe Magnitude Equation\nEven scientists can\u2019t calculate fifth roots in their heads, so astronomers have summarized the above\ndiscussion in an equation to help calculate the difference in brightness for stars with different magnitudes.\nIfm andm are the magnitudes of two stars, then we can calculate the ratio of their brightness\n1 2\nusing this equation:\nHere is another way to write this equation:\nLet\u2019s do a real example, just to show how this works. Imagine that an astronomer has discovered\nsomething special about a dim star (magnitude 8.5), and she wants to tell her students how much dimmer\nthe star is thanSirius. Star 1 in the equation will be our dim star and star 2 will be Sirius.\nSolution\nRemember, Sirius has a magnitude of \u22121.5. In that case:\nCheck Your Learning\nIt is a common misconception thatPolaris(magnitude 2.0) is the brightest star in the sky, but, as we saw,\nthat distinction actually belongs to Sirius (magnitude \u22121.5). How does Sirius\u2019 apparent brightness compare\nto that of Polaris?\nAnswer:\n(Hint: If you only have a basic calculator, you may wonder how to take 100 to the 0.7th power. But this is\nsomething you can ask Google to do. Google now accepts mathematical questions and will answer them.\nSo try it for yourself. Ask Google, \u201cWhat is 100 to the 0.7th power?\u201d)\nOur calculation shows that Sirius\u2019 apparent brightness is 25 times greater than Polaris\u2019 apparent\nbrightness.\nOther Units of Brightness\nAlthough the magnitude scale is still used for visual astronomy, it is not used at all in newer branches of the\nfield. In radio astronomy, for example, no equivalent of the magnitude system has been defined. Rather, radio\nastronomers measure the amount of energy being collected each second by each square meter of a radio\ntelescope and express the brightness of each source in terms of, for example, watts per square meter.\nSimilarly, most researchers in the fields of infrared, X-ray, and gamma-ray astronomy use energy per area per\nsecond rather than magnitudes to express the results of their measurements. Nevertheless, astronomers in all\nfields are careful to distinguish between theluminosityof the source (even when that luminosity is all in X-\nrays) and the amount of energy that happens to reach us on Earth. After all, the luminosity is a really\nAccess for free at openstax.org 17.2 \u2022 Colors of Stars 561\nimportant characteristic that tells us a lot about the object in question, whereas the energy that reaches Earth\nis an accident of cosmic geography.\nTo make the comparison among stars easy, in this text, we avoid the use of magnitudes as much as possible\nand will express the luminosity of other stars in terms of the Sun\u2019s luminosity. For example, the luminosity of\nSirius is 25 times that of the Sun. We use the symbolL to denote the Sun\u2019s luminosity; hence, that of Sirius\nSun\ncan be written as 25L .\nSun\n17.2 Colors of Stars\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nCompare the relative temperatures of stars based on their colors\nUnderstand how astronomers use color indexes to measure the temperatures of stars\nLook at the beautiful picture of the stars in the Sagittarius Star Cloud shown inFigure 17.3. The stars show a\nmultitude of colors, including red, orange, yellow, white, and blue. As we have seen, stars are not all the same\ncolor because they do not all have identical temperatures. To definecolorprecisely, astronomers have devised\nquantitative methods for characterizing the color of a star and then using those colors to determine stellar\ntemperatures. In the chapters that follow, we will provide the temperature of the stars we are describing, and\nthis section tells you how those temperatures are determined from the colors of light the stars give off.\nFigure17.3Sagittarius Star Cloud.This image, which was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, shows stars in the direction toward\nthe center of the Milky Way Galaxy. The bright stars glitter like colored jewels on a black velvet background. The color of a star\nindicates its temperature. Blue-white stars are much hotter than the Sun, whereas red stars are cooler. On average, the stars in this\nfield are at a distance of about 25,000 light-years (which means it takes light 25,000 years to traverse the distance from them to us)\nand the width of the field is about 13.3 light-years. (credit: Hubble Heritage Team (AURA/STScI/NASA))\nColor and Temperature\nAs we learned inThe Electromagnetic Spectrumsection, Wien\u2019s law relatesstellar colortostellar temperature.\nBlue colors dominate the visible light output of very hot stars (with much additional radiation in the\nultraviolet). On the other hand, cool stars emit most of their visible light energy at red wavelengths (with more\nradiation coming off in the infrared) (Table 17.1). The color of a star therefore provides a measure of its\nintrinsic or true surface temperature (apart from the effects of reddening by interstellar dust, which will be\ndiscussed inBetween the Stars: Gas and Dust in Space). Color does not depend on the distance to the object.\nThis should be familiar to you from everyday experience. The color of a traffic signal, for example, appears the 562 17 \u2022 Analyzing Starlight\nsame no matter how far away it is. If we could somehow take a star, observe it, and then move it much farther\naway, its apparent brightness (magnitude) would change. But this change in brightness is the same for all\nwavelengths, and so its color would remain the same.\nExample Star Colors and Corresponding Approximate Temperatures\nStar Color Approximate Temperature Example\nBlue 25,000 K Spica\nWhite 10,000 K Vega\nYellow 6000 K Sun\nOrange 4000 K Aldebaran\nRed 3000 K Betelgeuse\nTable17.1\nLINK TO LEARNING\nGo to thisinteractive simulation from the University of Colorado(https://openstax.org/l/30UofCsimstar)to\nsee the color of a star changing as the temperature is changed.\nThe hottest stars have temperatures of over 40,000 K, and the coolest stars have temperatures of about 2000\nK. Our Sun\u2019s surface temperature is about 6000 K; its peak wavelength color is a slightly greenish-yellow. In\nspace, the Sun would look white, shining with about equal amounts of reddish and bluish wavelengths of light.\nIt looks somewhat yellow as seen from Earth\u2019s surface because our planet\u2019s nitrogen molecules scatter some\nof the shorter (i.e., blue) wavelengths out of the beams of sunlight that reach us, leaving more long\nwavelength light behind. This also explains why the sky is blue: the blue sky is sunlight scattered by Earth\u2019s\natmosphere.\nColor Indices\nIn order to specify the exact color of a star, astronomers normally measure a star\u2019sapparent brightness\nthrough filters, each of which transmits only the light from a particular narrow band of wavelengths (colors). A\ncrude example of a filter in everyday life is a green-colored, plastic, soft drink bottle, which, when held in front\nof your eyes, lets only the green colors of light through.\nOne commonly used set of filters in astronomy measures stellar brightness at three wavelengths\ncorresponding to ultraviolet, blue, and yellow light. The filters are named: U (ultraviolet), B (blue), and V\n(visual, for yellow). These filters transmit light near the wavelengths of 360 nanometers (nm), 420 nm, and 540\nnm, respectively. The brightness measured through each filter is usually expressed in magnitudes. The\ndifference between any two of these magnitudes\u2014say, between the blue and the visual magnitudes (B\u2013V)\u2014is\ncalled acolor index.\nBy agreement among astronomers, the ultraviolet, blue, and visual magnitudes of the UBV system are\nadjusted to give a color index of 0 to a star with a surface temperature of about 10,000 K, such asVega. The\nAccess for free at openstax.org 17.3 \u2022 The Spectra of Stars (and Brown Dwarfs) 563\nB\u2013V color indexes of stars range from \u22120.4 for the bluest stars, with temperatures of about 40,000 K, to +2.0 for\nthe reddest stars, with temperatures of about 2000 K. The B\u2013V index for the Sun is about +0.65. Note that, by\nconvention, theB\u2013V indexis always the \u201cbluer\u201d minus the \u201credder\u201d color.\nWhy use a color index if it ultimately implies temperature? Because the brightness of a star through a filter is\nwhat astronomers actually measure, and we are always more comfortable when our statements have to do\nwith measurable quantities.\n17.3 The Spectra of Stars (and Brown Dwarfs)\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe how astronomers use spectral classes to characterize stars\nExplain the difference between a star and a brown dwarf\nMeasuring colors is only one way of analyzing starlight. Another way is to use a spectrograph to spread out\nthe light into a spectrum (see theRadiation and Spectraand theAstronomical Instrumentschapters). In 1814,\nthe German physicist JosephFraunhoferobserved that the spectrum of the Sun shows dark lines crossing a\ncontinuous band of colors. In the 1860s, English astronomers Sir WilliamHugginsand Lady Margaret Huggins\n(Figure 17.4) succeeded in identifying some of the lines in stellar spectra as those of known elements on Earth,\nshowing that the same chemical elements found in the Sun and planets exist in the stars. Since then,\nastronomers have worked hard to perfect experimental techniques for obtaining and measuring spectra, and\nthey have developed a theoretical understanding of what can be learned from spectra. Today, spectroscopic\nanalysis is one of the cornerstones of astronomical research.\nFigure17.4William Huggins (1824\u20131910) and Margaret Huggins (1848\u20131915).William and Margaret Huggins were the first to\nidentify the lines in the spectrum of a star other than the Sun; they also took the first spectrogram, or photograph of a stellar\nspectrum.\nFormation of Stellar Spectra\nWhen the spectra of different stars were first observed, astronomers found that they were not all identical.\nSince the dark lines are produced by the chemical elements present in the stars, astronomers first thought\nthat the spectra differ from one another because stars are not all made of the same chemical elements. This\nhypothesis turned out to be wrong.The primary reason thatstellar spectra look different is because the stars\nhave different temperatures. Most stars have nearly the same composition as the Sun, with only a few\nexceptions.\nHydrogen, for example, is by far the most abundant element in most stars. However, lines of hydrogen are not\nseen in the spectra of the hottest and the coolest stars. In the atmospheres of the hottest stars, hydrogen\natoms are completely ionized. Because the electron and the proton are separated, ionized hydrogen cannot\nproduce absorption lines. (Recall from theFormation of Spectral Linessection, the lines are the result of\nelectrons in orbit around a nucleus changing energy levels.) 564 17 \u2022 Analyzing Starlight\nIn the atmospheres of the coolest stars, hydrogen atoms have their electrons attached and can switch energy\nlevels to produce lines. However, practically all of the hydrogen atoms are in the lowest energy state\n(unexcited) in these stars and thus can absorb only those photons able to lift an electron from that first energy\nlevel to a higher level. Photons with enough energy to do this lie in the ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic\nspectrum, and there are very few ultraviolet photons in the radiation from a cool star. What this means is that\nif you observe the spectrum of a very hot or very cool star with a typical telescope on the surface of Earth, the\nmost common element in that star, hydrogen, will show very weak spectral lines or none at all.\nThe hydrogen lines in the visible part of the spectrum (calledBalmer lines) are strongest in stars with\nintermediate temperatures\u2014not too hot and not too cold. Calculations show that the optimum temperature\nfor producing visible hydrogen lines is about 10,000 K. At this temperature, an appreciable number of\nhydrogen atoms are excited to the second energy level. They can then absorb additional photons, rise to still-\nhigher levels of excitation, and produce a dark absorption line. Similarly, every other chemical element, in each\nof its possible stages of ionization, has a characteristic temperature at which it is most effective in producing\nabsorption lines in any particular part of the spectrum.\nClassification of Stellar Spectra\nAstronomers use the patterns of lines observed instellar spectrato sort stars into aspectral class. Because a\nstar\u2019s temperature determines which absorption lines are present in its spectrum, these spectral classes are a\nmeasure of its surface temperature. There are seven standard spectral classes. From hottest to coldest, these\nseven spectral classes are designated O, B, A, F, G, K, and M. Recently, astronomers have added three\nadditional classes for even cooler objects\u2014L, T, and Y.\nAt this point, you may be looking at these letters with wonder and asking yourself why astronomers didn\u2019t call\nthe spectral types A, B, C, and so on. You will see, as we tell you the history, that it\u2019s an instance where tradition\nwon out over common sense.\nIn the 1880s, WilliaminaFlemingdevised a system to classify stars based on the strength of hydrogen\nabsorption lines. Spectra with the strongest lines were classified as \u201cA\u201d stars, the next strongest \u201cB,\u201d and so on\ndown the alphabet to \u201cO\u201d stars, in which the hydrogen lines were very weak. But we saw above that hydrogen\nlines alone are not a good indicator for classifying stars, since their lines disappear from the visible light\nspectrum when the stars get too hot or too cold.\nIn the 1890s, Annie JumpCannonrevised this classification system, focusing on just a few letters from the\noriginal system: A, B, F, G, K, M, and O. Instead of starting over, Cannon also rearranged the existing\nclasses\u2014in order of decreasing temperature\u2014into the sequence we have learned: O, B, A, F, G, K, M. As you\ncan read in the feature onAnnie Cannon: Classifier of the Starsin this chapter, she classified around 500,000\nstars over her lifetime, classifying up to three stars per minute by looking at the stellar spectra.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nFor a deep dive into spectral types, explore the interactive project at theSloan Digital Sky Survey\n(https://openstax.org/l/30sloandigsky)in which you can practice classifying stars yourself.\nTo help astronomers remember this crazy order of letters, Cannon created a mnemonic, \u201cOh Be A Fine Girl,\nKiss Me.\u201d (If you prefer, you can easily substitute \u201cGuy\u201d for \u201cGirl.\u201d) Other mnemonics, which we hope will not\nbe relevant for you, include \u201cOh Brother, Astronomers Frequently Give Killer Midterms\u201d and \u201cOh Boy, An F\nGrade Kills Me!\u201d With the new L, T, and Y spectral classes, the mnemonic might be expanded to \u201cOh Be A Fine\nGirl (Guy), Kiss Me Like That, Yo!\u201d\nEach of these spectral classes, except possibly for the Y class which is still being defined, is further subdivided\nAccess for free at openstax.org 17.3 \u2022 The Spectra of Stars (and Brown Dwarfs) 565\ninto 10 subclasses designated by the numbers 0 through 9. A B0 star is the hottest type of B star; a B9 star is\nthe coolest type of B star and is only slightly hotter than an A0 star.\nAnd just one more item of vocabulary: for historical reasons, astronomers call all the elements heavier than\nheliummetals, even though most of them do not show metallic properties. (If you are getting annoyed at the\npeculiar jargon that astronomers use, just bear in mind that every field of human activity tends to develop its\nown specialized vocabulary. Just try reading a credit card or social media agreement form these days without\ntraining in law!)\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of the details of how the spectra of the stars change with temperature. (It is these\ndetails that allowed Annie Cannon to identify the spectral types of stars as quickly as three per minute!) As\nFigure 17.5shows, in the hottest O stars (those with temperatures over 28,000 K), only lines of ionized helium\nand highly ionized atoms of other elements are conspicuous. Hydrogen lines are strongest in A stars with\natmospheric temperatures of about 10,000 K. Ionized metals provide the most conspicuous lines in stars with\ntemperatures from 6000 to 7500 K (spectral type F). In the coolest M stars (below 3500 K), absorption bands of\ntitanium oxide and other molecules are very strong. By the way, the spectral class assigned to the Sun is G2.\nThe sequence ofspectral classes is summarized inTable 17.2.\nFigure17.5Absorption Lines in Stars of Different Temperatures.This graph shows the strengths of absorption lines of different\nchemical species (atoms, ions, molecules) as we move from hot (left) to cool (right) stars.

But if the spectrum also contains helium lines, then it is a B\nstar, whereas if it contains lines of ionized iron and other metals, it must be a G star.\nIf you look atFigure 17.6, you can see that you, too, could assign a spectral class to a star whose type was not\nalready known.

The strong pair of closely spaced lines in the yellow in the cool stars is\ndue to neutral sodium (one of the neutral metals inFigure 17.5). (Credit: modification of work by NOAO/AURA/NSF)\nBoth colors and spectral classes can be used to estimate the temperature of a star. Spectra are harder to\nmeasure because the light has to be bright enough to be spread out into all colors of the rainbow, and\ndetectors must be sensitive enough to respond to individual wavelengths. In order to measure colors, the\ndetectors need only respond to the many wavelengths that pass simultaneously through the colored filters\nthat have been chosen\u2014that is, toallthe blue light orallthe yellow-green light.\nVOYAGERS IN ASTRONOMY\nAnnie Cannon: Classifier of the Stars\nAnnie JumpCannonwas born in Delaware in 1863 (Figure 17.7). In 1880, she went to Wellesley College, one\nof the new breed of US colleges opening up to educate young women. Wellesley, only 5 years old at the\ntime, had the second student physics lab in the country and provided excellent training in basic science.\nAfter college, Cannon spent a decade with her parents but was very dissatisfied, longing to do scientific\nwork. After her mother\u2019s death in 1893, she returned to Wellesley as a teaching assistant and also to take\ncourses at Radcliffe, the women\u2019s college associated with Harvard.\nFigure17.7Annie Jump Cannon (1863\u20131941).Cannon is well-known for her classifications of stellar spectra. (credit: modification\nof work by Smithsonian Institution)\nIn the late 1800s, the director of the Harvard Observatory, Edward C. Pickering, needed lots of help with his\nambitious program of classifying stellar spectra. The basis for these studies was a monumental collection of\nnearly a million photographic spectra of stars, obtained from many years of observations made at Harvard\nCollege Observatory in Massachusetts as well as at its remote observing stations in South America and\nSouth Africa. Pickering quickly discovered that educated young women could be hired as assistants for one-\nthird or one-fourth the salary paid to men, and they would often put up with working conditions and\nrepetitive tasks that men with the same education would not tolerate. These women became known as the 568 17 \u2022 Analyzing Starlight\nHarvard Computers. (We should emphasize that astronomers were not alone in reaching such conclusions\nabout the relatively new idea of upper-class, educated women working outside the home: women were\nexploited and undervalued in many fields. This is a legacy from which our society is just beginning to\nemerge.)\nCannon was hired by Pickering as one of the \u201ccomputers\u201d to help with the classification of spectra. She\nbecame so good at it that she could visually examine and determine the spectral types of several hundred\nstars per hour (dictating her conclusions to an assistant). She made many discoveries while investigating\nthe Harvard photographic plates, including 300 variable stars (stars whose luminosity changes periodically).\nBut her main legacy is a marvelous catalog of spectral types for hundreds of thousands of stars, which\nserved as a foundation for much of twentieth-century astronomy.\nIn 1911, a visiting committee of astronomers reported that \u201cshe is the one person in the world who can do\nthis work quickly and accurately\u201d and urged Harvard to give Cannon an official appointment in keeping\nwith her skill and renown. Not until 1938, however, did Harvard appoint her an astronomer at the\nuniversity; she was then 75 years old.\nCannon received the first honorary degree Oxford awarded to a woman, and she became the first woman\nto be elected an officer of the American Astronomical Society, the main professional organization of\nastronomers in the US. She generously donated the money from one of the major prizes she had won to\nfound a special award for women in astronomy, now known as the Annie Jump Cannon Prize. True to form,\nshe continued classifying stellar spectra almost to the very end of her life in 1941.\nSpectral Classes L, T, and Y\nThe scheme devised by Cannon worked well until 1988, when astronomers began to discover objects even\ncooler than M9-type stars. We use the wordobjectbecause many of the new discoveries are not true stars. A\nstar is defined as an object that during some part of its lifetime derives 100% of its energy from the same\nprocess that makes the Sun shine\u2014the fusion of hydrogen nuclei (protons) into helium. Objects with masses\nless than about 7.5% of the mass of our Sun (about 0.075M ) do not become hot enough for hydrogen\nSun\nfusion to take place. Even before the first such \u201cfailed star\u201d was found, this class of objects, with masses\nintermediate between stars and planets, was given the namebrown dwarfs.\nBrown dwarfs are very difficult to observe because they are extremely faint and cool, and they put out most of\ntheir light in the infrared part of the spectrum. It was only after the construction of very large telescopes, like\nthe Keck telescopes in Hawaii, and the development of very sensitive infrared detectors, that the search for\nbrown dwarfs succeeded. The first brown dwarf was discovered in 1988, and, as of the summer of 2015, there\nare more than 2200 known brown dwarfs.\nInitially, brown dwarfs were given spectral classes like M10+or \u201cmuch cooler than M9,\u201d but so many are now\nknown that it is possible to begin assigning spectral types. The hottest brown dwarfs are given types L0\u2013L9\n(temperatures in the range 2400\u20131300 K), whereas still cooler (1300\u2013700 K) objects are given types T0\u2013T9 (see\nFigure 17.8). In class L brown dwarfs, the lines of titanium oxide, which are strong in M stars, have\ndisappeared. This is because the L dwarfs are so cool that atoms and molecules can gather together into dust\nparticles in their atmospheres; the titanium is locked up in the dust grains rather than being available to form\nmolecules of titanium oxide. Lines of steam (hot water vapor) are present, along with lines of carbon\nmonoxide and neutral sodium, potassium, cesium, and rubidium. Methane (CH ) lines are strong in class-T\n4\nbrown dwarfs, as methane exists in the atmosphere of the giant planets in our own solar system.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 17.3 \u2022 The Spectra of Stars (and Brown Dwarfs) 569\nIn 2009, astronomers discovered ultra-cool brown dwarfs with temperatures of 500\u2013600 K. These objects\nexhibited absorption lines due to ammonia (NH ), which are not seen in T dwarfs. A new spectral class, Y, was\n3\ncreated for these objects. As of 2021, over 50 brown dwarfs belonging to spectral class Y have been discovered,\n2\nsome with temperatures comparable to that of the human body (about 300 K).\nFigure17.8Brown Dwarfs.This illustration shows the sizes and surface temperatures of brown dwarfs Teide 1, Gliese 229B, and\nWISE1828 in relation to the Sun, a red dwarf star (Gliese 229A), and Jupiter. (credit: modification of work by MPIA/V. Joergens)\nMost brown dwarfs start out with atmospheric temperatures and spectra like those of true stars with spectral\nclasses of M6.5 and later, even though the brown dwarfs are not hot and dense enough in their interiors to\nfuse hydrogen. In fact, the spectra of brown dwarfs and true stars are so similar from spectral types late M\nthrough L that it is not possible to distinguish the two types of objects based on spectra alone. An independent\nmeasure of mass is required to determine whether a specific object is a brown dwarf or a very low mass star.\nSince brown dwarfs cool steadily throughout their lifetimes, the spectral type of a given brown dwarf changes\nwith time over a billion years or more from late M through L, T, and Y spectral types.\nLow-Mass Brown Dwarfs vs. High-Mass Planets\nAn interesting property ofbrown dwarfsis that they are all about the same radius asJupiter, regardless of\ntheir masses. Amazingly, this covers a range of masses from about 13 to 80 times the mass of Jupiter (M). This\nJ\ncan make distinguishing a low-mass brown dwarf from a high-mass planet very difficult.\nSo, what is the difference between a low-mass brown dwarf and a high-mass planet? The International\nAstronomical Union considers the distinctive feature to bedeuterium fusion. Although brown dwarfs do not\nsustain regular (proton-proton) hydrogen fusion, they are capable of fusing deuterium (a rare form of\nhydrogen with one proton and one neutron in its nucleus). The fusion of deuterium can happen at a lower\ntemperature than the fusion of hydrogen. If an object has enough mass to fuse deuterium (about 13Mor\nJ\n2 The record-holder for the coldest Type Y dwarf is WISE 0855-0714, at around 250 K. 570 17 \u2022 Analyzing Starlight\n0.012M ), it is a brown dwarf. Objects with less than 13Mdo not fuse deuterium and are usually considered\nSun J\nplanets.\n17.4 Using Spectra to Measure Stellar Radius, Composition, and Motion\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nUnderstand how astronomers can learn about a star\u2019s radius and composition by studying its spectrum\nExplain how astronomers can measure the motion and rotation of a star using the Doppler effect\nDescribe the proper motion of a star and how it relates to a star\u2019s space velocity\nAnalyzing the spectrum of a star can teach us all kinds of things in addition to its temperature. We can\nmeasure its detailed chemical composition as well as the pressure in its atmosphere. From the pressure, we\nget clues about its size. We can also measure its motion toward or away from us and estimate its rotation.\nClues to the Size of a Star\nAs we shall see inThe Stars: A Celestial Census, stars come in a wide variety of sizes. At some periods in their\nlives, stars can expand to enormous dimensions. Stars of such exaggerated size are calledgiants. Luckily for\nthe astronomer, stellar spectra can be used to distinguish giants from run-of-the-mill stars (such as our Sun).\nSuppose you want to determine whether a star is a giant. A giant star has a large, extended photosphere.\nBecause it is so large, a giant star\u2019s atoms are spread over a great volume, which means that the density of\nparticles in the star\u2019s photosphere is low. As a result, the pressure in a giant star\u2019s photosphere is also low.\nThis low pressure affects the spectrum in two ways. First, a star with a lower-pressure photosphere shows\nnarrower spectral lines than a star of the same temperature with a higher-pressure photosphere (Figure 17.9).\nThe difference is large enough that careful study of spectra can tell which of two stars at the same\ntemperature has a higher pressure (and is thus more compressed) and which has a lower pressure (and thus\nmust be extended). This effect is due to collisions between particles in the star\u2019s photosphere\u2014more collisions\nlead to broader spectral lines. Collisions will, of course, be more frequent in a higher-density environment.\nThink about it like traffic\u2014collisions are much more likely during rush hour, when the density of cars is high.\nSecond, more atoms are ionized in a giant star than in a star like the Sun with the same temperature. The\nionization of atoms in a star\u2019s outer layers is caused mainly by photons, and the amount of energy carried by\nphotons is determined by temperature. But how long atomsstayionized depends in part on pressure.\nCompared with what happens in the Sun (with its relatively dense photosphere), ionized atoms in a giant star\u2019s\nphotosphere are less likely to pass close enough to electrons to interact and combine with one or more of\nthem, thereby becoming neutral again. Ionized atoms, as we discussed earlier, have different spectra from\natoms that are neutral.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 17.4 \u2022 Using Spectra to Measure Stellar Radius, Composition, and Motion 571\nFigure17.9Spectral Lines.This figure illustrates one difference in the spectral lines from stars of the same temperature but\ndifferent pressures. A giant star with a very-low-pressure photosphere shows very narrow spectral lines (bottom), whereas a smaller\nstar with a higher-pressure photosphere shows much broader spectral lines (top). (credit: modification of work by NASA, ESA, A.\nField, and J. Kalirai (STScI))\nAbundances of the Elements\nAbsorption lines of a majority of the known chemical elements have now been identified in the spectra of the\nSun and stars. If we see lines of iron in a star\u2019s spectrum, for example, then we know immediately that the star\nmust contain iron.\nNote that theabsenceof an element\u2019s spectral lines does not necessarily mean that the element itself is\nabsent. As we saw, the temperature and pressure in a star\u2019s atmosphere will determine what types of atoms\nare able to produce absorption lines. Only if the physical conditions in a star\u2019s photosphere are such that lines\nof an elementshould(according to calculations) be there can we conclude that the absence of observable\nspectral lines implies low abundance of the element.\nSuppose two stars have identical temperatures and pressures, but the lines of, say, sodium are stronger in one\nthan in the other. Stronger lines mean that there are more atoms in the stellar photosphere absorbing light.\nTherefore, we know immediately that the star with stronger sodium lines contains more sodium. Complex\ncalculations are required to determine exactly how much more, but those calculations can be done for any\nelement observed in any star with any temperature and pressure.\nOf course, astronomy textbooks such as ours always make these things sound a bit easier than they really are.\nIf you look at the stellar spectra such as those inFigure 17.6, you may get some feeling for how hard it is to\ndecode all of the information contained in the thousands of absorption lines. First of all, it has taken many\nyears of careful laboratory work on Earth to determine the precise wavelengths at which hot gases of each\nelement have their spectral lines. Long books and computer databases have been compiled to show the lines\nof each element that can be seen at each temperature. Second, stellar spectra usually have many lines from a\nnumber of elements, and we must be careful to sort them out correctly. Sometimes nature is unhelpful, and\nlines of different elements have identical wavelengths, thereby adding to the confusion. And third, as we saw\nin the chapter onRadiation and Spectra, the motion of the star can change the observed wavelength of each\nof the lines. So, the observed wavelengths may not match laboratory measurements exactly. In practice,\nanalyzing stellar spectra is a demanding, sometimes frustrating task that requires both training and skill.\nStudies of stellar spectra have shown that hydrogen makes up about three-quarters of the mass of most stars.\nHelium is the second-most abundant element, making up almost a quarter of a star\u2019s mass. Together,\nhydrogen and helium make up from 96 to 99% of the mass; in some stars, they amount to more than 99.9%.\nAmong the 4% or less of \u201cheavy elements,\u201d oxygen, carbon, neon, iron, nitrogen, silicon, magnesium, and\nsulfur are among the most abundant. Generally, but not invariably, the elements of lower atomic weight are\nmore abundant than those of higher atomic weight. 572 17 \u2022 Analyzing Starlight\nTake a careful look at the list of elements in the preceding paragraph. Two of the most abundant are hydrogen\nand oxygen (which make up water); add carbon and nitrogen and you are starting to write the prescription for\nthe chemistry of an astronomy student. We are made of elements that are common in the universe\u2014just\nmixed together in a far more sophisticated form (and a much cooler environment) than in a star.\nAs we mentioned inThe Spectra of Stars (and Brown Dwarfs)section, astronomers use the term \u201cmetals\u201d to\nrefer to all elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. The fraction of a star\u2019s mass that is composed of\nthese elements is referred to as the star\u2019smetallicity. The metallicity of the Sun, for example, is 0.02, since 2%\nof the Sun\u2019s mass is made of elements heavier than helium.\nAppendix Klists how common each element is in the universe (compared to hydrogen); these estimates are\nbased primarily on investigation of the Sun, which is a typical star. Some very rare elements, however, have\nnot been detected in the Sun. Estimates of the amounts of these elements in the universe are based on\nlaboratory measurements of their abundance in primitive meteorites, which are considered representative of\nunaltered material condensed from the solar nebula (see theCosmic Samples and the Origin of the Solar\nSystemchapter).\nRadial Velocity\nWhen we measure the spectrum of a star, we determine the wavelength of each of its lines. If the star is not\nmoving with respect to the Sun, then the wavelength corresponding to each element will be the same as those\nwe measure in a laboratory here on Earth. But if stars are moving toward or away from us, we must consider\ntheDoppler effect(seeTheDopplerEffectsection). We should see all the spectral lines of moving stars shifted\ntoward the red end of the spectrum if the star is moving away from us, or toward the blue (violet) end if it is\nmoving toward us (Figure 17.10). The greater the shift, the faster the star is moving. Such motion, along the\nline of sight between the star and the observer, is calledradial velocityand is usually measured in kilometers\nper second.\nFigure17.10Doppler-Shifted Stars.When the spectral lines of a moving star shift toward the red end of the spectrum, we know\nthat the star is moving away from us. If they shift toward the blue end, the star is moving toward us.\nWilliamHuggins, pioneering yet again, in 1868 made the first radial velocity determination of a star. He\nobserved the Doppler shift in one of the hydrogen lines in the spectrum ofSiriusand found that this star is\nmoving toward the solar system. (Better measurements now indicate that Sirius is actually moving away, but\nHuggins is still celebrated as a pioneer in making such measurements.) Today, radial velocity can be measured\nfor any star bright enough for its spectrum to be observed. As we will see inThe Stars: A Celestial Census,\nradial velocity measurements of double stars are crucial in deriving stellar masses.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 17.4 \u2022 Using Spectra to Measure Stellar Radius, Composition, and Motion 573\nLINK TO LEARNING\nIn theSpectrum Constructor(https://openstax.org/l/30spectconst), you can add absorption lines to the\nspectrum. Then adjust the velocity; negative indicates the star is moving toward the observer, and positive\nindicates it is moving away. Explore how the absorption lines are seen to shift to shorter and longer\nwavelengths.\nProper Motion\nThere is another type of motion stars can have that cannot be detected with stellar spectra. Unlike radial\nmotion, which is along our line of sight (i.e., toward or away from Earth), this motion, calledproper motion, is\ntransverse: that is, across our line of sight. We see it as a change in the relative positions of the stars on the\ncelestial sphere (Figure 17.11). These changes are very slow. Even the star with the largest proper motion takes\n200 years to change its position in the sky by an amount equal to the width of the full Moon, and the motions\nof other stars are smaller yet.\nFigure17.11Large Proper Motion.Three photographs of Barnard\u2019s star, the star with the largest known proper motion, show how\nthis faint star has moved over a period of 20 years. (modification of work by Steve Quirk)\nFor this reason, with our naked eyes, we do not notice any change in the positions of the bright stars during\nthe course of a human lifetime. If we could live long enough, however, the changes would become obvious.\nFor example, some 50,000 years from now, terrestrial observers will find the handle of the Big Dipper\nunmistakably more bent than it is now (Figure 17.12). 574 17 \u2022 Analyzing Starlight\nFigure17.12Changes in the Big Dipper.This figure shows changes in the appearance of the Big Dipper due to proper motion of\nthe stars over 100,000 years.\nWe measure the proper motion of a star in arcseconds (1/3600 of a degree) per year. That is, the\nmeasurement of proper motion tells us only by how much of an angle a star has changed its position on the\ncelestial sphere. If two stars at different distances are moving at the same velocity perpendicular to our line of\nsight, the closer one will show a larger shift in its position on the celestial sphere in a year\u2019s time. As an\nanalogy, imagine you are standing at the side of a freeway. Cars will appear to whiz past you. If you then watch\nthe traffic from a vantage point half a mile away, the cars will move much more slowly across your field of\nvision. In order to convert this angular motion to a velocity, we need to know how far away the star is.\nTo know the truespace velocityof a star\u2014that is, its total speed and the direction in which it is moving\nthrough space relative to the Sun\u2014we must know its radial velocity, proper motion, and distance (Figure\n17.13). A star\u2019s space velocity can also, over time, cause its distance from the Sun to change significantly. Over\nseveral hundred thousand years, these changes can be large enough to affect the apparent brightnesses of\nnearby stars. Today,Sirius, in the constellation Canis Major (the Big Dog) is the brightest star in the sky, but\n100,000 years ago, the star Canopus in the constellation Carina (the Keel) was the brightest one. A little over\n200,000 years from now, Sirius will have moved away and faded somewhat, andVega, the bright blue star in\nLyra, will take over its place of honor as the brightest star in Earth\u2019s skies.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 17.4 \u2022 Using Spectra to Measure Stellar Radius, Composition, and Motion 575\nFigure17.13Space Velocity and Proper Motion.This figure shows the true space velocity of a star. The radial velocity is the\ncomponent of the space velocity projected along the line of sight from the Sun to a star. The transverse velocity is a component of\nthe space velocity projected on the sky. What astronomers measure is proper motion (\u03bc), which is the change in the apparent\ndirection on the sky measured in fractions of a degree. To convert this change in direction to a speed in, say, kilometers per second,\nit is necessary to also know the distance (d) from the Sun to the star.\nRotation\nWe can also use the Doppler effect to measure how fast a star rotates. If an object is rotating, then one of its\nsides is approaching us while the other is receding (unless its axis of rotation happens to be pointed exactly\ntoward us). This is clearly the case for the Sun or a planet; we can observe the light from either the\napproaching or receding edge of these nearby objects and directly measure the Doppler shifts that arise from\nthe rotation.\nStars, however, are so far away that they all appear as unresolved points. The best we can do is to analyze the\nlight from the entire star at once. Due to the Doppler effect, the lines in the light that come from the side of\nthe star rotating toward us are shifted to shorter wavelengths and the lines in the light from the opposite edge\nof the star are shifted to longer wavelengths. You can think of each spectral line that we observe as the sum or\ncomposite of spectral lines originating from different speeds with respect to us. Each point on the star has its\nown Doppler shift, so the absorption line we see from the whole star is actually much wider than it would be if\nthe star were not rotating. If a star is rotating rapidly, there will be a greater spread of Doppler shifts and all its\nspectral lines should be quite broad. In fact, astronomers call this effectline broadening, and the amount of\nbroadening can tell us the speed at which the star rotates (Figure 17.14). 576 17 \u2022 Analyzing Starlight\nFigure17.14Using a Spectrum to Determine Stellar Rotation.A rotating star will show broader spectral lines than a nonrotating\nstar.\nMeasurements of the widths of spectral lines show that many stars rotate faster than the Sun, some with\nperiods of less than a day! These rapid rotators spin so fast that their shapes are \u201cflattened\u201d into what we call\noblate spheroids. An example of this is the starVega, which rotates once every 12.5 hours. Vega\u2019s rotation\nflattens its shape so much that its diameter at the equator is 23% wider than its diameter at the poles (Figure\n17.15). The Sun, with its rotation period of about a month, rotates rather slowly. Studies have shown that stars\ndecrease their rotational speed as they age. Young stars rotate very quickly, with rotational periods of days or\nless. Very old stars can have rotation periods of several months.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 17.4 \u2022 Using Spectra to Measure Stellar Radius, Composition, and Motion 577\nFigure17.15Comparison of Rotating Stars.This illustration compares the more rapidly rotating star Altair to the slower rotating\nSun.\nAs you can see, spectroscopy is an extremely powerful technique that helps us learn all kinds of information\nabout stars that we simply could not gather any other way. We will see in later chapters that these same\ntechniques can also teach us about galaxies, which are the most distant objects that can we observe. Without\nspectroscopy, we would know next to nothing about the universe beyond the solar system.\nMAKING CONNECTIONS\nAstronomy and Philanthropy\nThroughout the history of astronomy, contributions from wealthy patrons of the science have made an\nenormous difference in building new instruments and carrying out long-term research projects. Edward\nPickering\u2019s stellar classification project, which was to stretch over several decades, was made possible by\nmajor donations from AnnaDraper. She was the widow of Henry Draper, a physician who was one of the\nmost accomplished amateur astronomers of the nineteenth century and the first person to successfully\nphotograph the spectrum of a star. Anna Draper gave several hundred thousand dollars to Harvard\nObservatory. As a result, the great spectroscopic survey is still known as the Henry Draper Memorial, and\nmany stars are still referred to by their \u201cHD\u201d numbers in that catalog (such as HD 209458).\nIn the 1870s, the eccentric piano builder and real estate magnate JamesLick(Figure 17.16) decided to leave\nsome of his fortune to build the world\u2019s largest telescope. When, in 1887, the pier to house the telescope\nwas finished, Lick\u2019s body was entombed in it. Atop the foundation rose a 36-inch refractor, which for many\nyears was the main instrument at the Lick Observatory near San Jose. 578 17 \u2022 Analyzing Starlight\nFigure17.16Henry Draper (1837\u20131882) and James Lick (1796\u20131876).(a) Draper stands next to a telescope used for\nphotography. After his death, his widow funded further astronomy work in his name. (b) Lick was a philanthropist who provided\nfunds to build a 36-inch refractor not only as a memorial to himself but also to aid in further astronomical research.\nThe Lick telescope remained the largest in the world until 1897, when George ElleryHalepersuaded\nrailroad millionaire CharlesYerkesto finance the construction of a 40-inch telescope near Chicago. More\nrecently, Howard Keck, whose family made its fortune in the oil industry, gave $70 million from his family\nfoundation to the California Institute of Technology to help build the world\u2019s largest telescope atop the\n14,000-foot peak of Maunakea in Hawaii (see the chapter onAstronomical Instrumentsto learn more about\nthese telescopes). TheKeckFoundation was so pleased with what is now called the Keck telescope that they\ngave $74 million more to build Keck II, another 10-meter reflector on the same volcanic peak.\nNow, if any of you become millionaires or billionaires, and astronomy has sparked your interest, do keep an\nastronomical instrument or project in mind as you plan your estate. But frankly, private philanthropy could\nnot possibly support the full enterprise of scientific research in astronomy. Much of our exploration of the\nuniverse is financed by federal agencies such as the National Science Foundation and NASA in the United\nStates, and by similar government agencies in the other countries. In this way, all of us, through a very\nsmall share of our tax dollars, are philanthropists for astronomy.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 17 \u2022 Key Terms 579\nKey Terms\napparent brightness a measure of the amount of light received by Earth from a star or other object\u2014that is,\nhow bright an object appears in the sky, as contrasted with its luminosity\nbrown dwarf an object intermediate in size between a planet and a star; the approximate mass range is\nfrom about 1/100 of the mass of the Sun up to the lower mass limit for self-sustaining nuclear reactions,\nwhich is about 0.075 the mass of the Sun; brown dwarfs are capable of deuterium fusion, but not hydrogen\nfusion\ncolor index difference between the magnitudes of a star or other object measured in light of two different\nspectral regions\u2014for example, blue minus visual (B\u2013V) magnitudes\ngiant a star of exaggerated size with a large, extended photosphere\nluminosity the rate at which a star or other object emits electromagnetic energy into space; the total power\noutput of an object\nmagnitude an older system of measuring the amount of light we receive from a star or other luminous\nobject; the larger the magnitude, the less radiation we receive from the object\nproper motion the angular change per year in the direction of a star as seen from the Sun\nradial velocity motion toward or away from the observer; the component of relative velocity that lies in the\nline of sight\nspace velocity the total (three-dimensional) speed and direction with which an object is moving through\nspace relative to the Sun\nspectral class (or spectral type) the classification of stars according to their temperatures using the\ncharacteristics of their spectra; the types are O, B, A, F, G, K, and M with L, T, and Y added recently for cooler\nstar-like objects that recent survey have revealed\nSummary\n17.1The Brightness of Stars\nThe total energy emitted per second by a star is called its luminosity. How bright a star looks from the\nperspective of Earth is its apparent brightness. The apparent brightness of a star depends on both its\nluminosity and its distance from Earth. Thus, the determination of apparent brightness and measurement of\nthe distance to a star provide enough information to calculate its luminosity. The apparent brightnesses of\nstars are often expressed in terms of magnitudes, which is an old system based on how human vision\ninterprets relative light intensity.\n17.2Colors of Stars\nStars have different colors, which are indicators of temperature. The hottest stars tend to appear blue or blue-\nwhite, whereas the coolest stars are red. A color index of a star is the difference in the magnitudes measured\nat any two wavelengths and is one way that astronomers measure and express the temperature of stars.\n17.3The Spectra of Stars (and Brown Dwarfs)\nThe differences in the spectra of stars are principally due to differences in temperature, not composition. The\nspectra of stars are described in terms of spectral classes. In order of decreasing temperature, these spectral\nclasses are O, B, A, F, G, K, M, L, T, and Y. These are further divided into subclasses numbered from 0 to 9. The\nclasses L, T, and Y have been added recently to describe newly discovered star-like objects\u2014mainly brown\ndwarfs\u2014that are cooler than M9. Our Sun has spectral type G2.\n17.4Using Spectra to Measure Stellar Radius, Composition, and Motion\nSpectra of stars of the same temperature but different atmospheric pressures have subtle differences, so\nspectra can be used to determine whether a star has a large radius and low atmospheric pressure (a giant\nstar) or a small radius and high atmospheric pressure. Stellar spectra can also be used to determine the 580 17 \u2022 For Further Exploration\nchemical composition of stars; hydrogen and helium make up most of the mass of all stars. Measurements of\nline shifts produced by the Doppler effect indicate the radial velocity of a star. Broadening of spectral lines by\nthe Doppler effect is a measure of rotational velocity. A star can also show proper motion, due to the\ncomponent of a star\u2019s space velocity across the line of sight.\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nBerman, B. \u201cMagnitude Cum Laude.\u201dAstronomy(December 1998): 92.

The Voyagers in Astronomy feature onAnnie Cannon: Classifier of the Starsdiscusses some of the\ndifficulties women who wanted to do astronomy faced in the first half of the twentieth century. What does\nyour group think about the situation for women today? Do men and women have an equal chance to\nbecome scientists? Discuss with your group whether, in your experience, boys and girls were equally\nencouraged to do science and math where you went to school.\nB. In the section on magnitudes inThe Brightness of Stars, we discussed how this old system of classifying\nhow bright different stars appear to the eye first developed. Your authors complained about the fact that\nthis old system still has to be taught to every generation of new students. Can your group think of any\nother traditional systems of doing things in science and measurement where tradition rules even though\ncommon sense says a better system could certainly be found. Explain. (Hint: Try Daylight Savings Time, or\nmetric versus English units.)\nC. Suppose you could observe a star that has only one spectral line. Could you tell what element that spectral\nline comes from? Make a list of reasons with your group about why you answered yes or no.\nD. A wealthy alumnus of your college decides to give $50 million to the astronomy department to build a\nworld-class observatory for learning more about the characteristics of stars. Have your group discuss what\nkind of equipment they would put in the observatory. Where should this observatory be located? Justify\nyour answers. (You may want to refer back to theAstronomical Instrumentschapter and to revisit this\nquestion as you learn more about the stars and equipment for observing them in future chapters.)\nE. For some astronomers, introducing a new spectral type for the stars (like the types L, T, and Y discussed in\nthe text) is similar to introducing a new area code for telephone calls. No one likes to disrupt the old\nsystem, but sometimes it is simply necessary. Have your group make a list of steps an astronomer would\nhave to go through to persuade colleagues that a new spectral class is needed.\nExercises\nReview Questions\n1. What two factors determine how bright a star appears to be in the sky?\n2. Explain why color is a measure of a star\u2019s temperature.\n3. What is the main reason that the spectra of all stars are not identical? Explain.\n4. What elements are stars mostly made of? How do we know this?\n5. What did Annie Cannon contribute to the understanding of stellar spectra?\n6. Name five characteristics of a star that can be determined by measuring its spectrum. Explain how you\nwould use a spectrum to determine these characteristics.\n7. How do objects of spectral types L, T, and Y differ from those of the other spectral types?\n8. Do stars that look brighter in the sky have larger or smaller magnitudes than fainter stars?\n9. The star Antares has an apparent magnitude of 1.0, whereas the star Procyon has an apparent magnitude\nof 0.4. Which star appears brighter in the sky?\n10. Based on their colors, which of the following stars is hottest? Which is coolest? Archenar (blue),\nBetelgeuse (red), Capella (yellow). 582 17 \u2022 Exercises\n11. Order the seven basic spectral types from hottest to coldest.\n12. What is the defining difference between a brown dwarf and a true star?\nThought Questions\n13. If the star Sirius emits 23 times more energy than the Sun, why does the Sun appear brighter in the sky?\n14. How would two stars of equal luminosity\u2014one blue and the other red\u2014appear in an image taken through\na filter that passes mainly blue light? How would their appearance change in an image taken through a\nfilter that transmits mainly red light?\n15. Table 17.2lists the temperature ranges that correspond to the different spectral types. What part of the\nstar do these temperatures refer to? Why?\n16. Suppose you are given the task of measuring the colors of the brightest stars, listed inAppendix J, through\nthree filters: the first transmits blue light, the second transmits yellow light, and the third transmits red\nlight. If you observe the star Vega, it will appear equally bright through each of the three filters. Which\nstars will appear brighter through the blue filter than through the red filter? Which stars will appear\nbrighter through the red filter? Which star is likely to have colors most nearly like those of Vega?\n17. Star X has lines of ionized helium in its spectrum, and star Y has bands of titanium oxide. Which is hotter?\nWhy? The spectrum of star Z shows lines of ionized helium and also molecular bands of titanium oxide.\nWhat is strange about this spectrum? Can you suggest an explanation?\n18. The spectrum of the Sun has hundreds of strong lines of nonionized iron but only a few, very weak lines of\nhelium. A star of spectral type B has very strong lines of helium but very weak iron lines. Do these\ndifferences mean that the Sun contains more iron and less helium than the B star? Explain.\n19. What are the approximate spectral classes of stars with the following characteristics?\nA. Balmer lines of hydrogen are very strong; some lines of ionized metals are present.\nB. The strongest lines are those of ionized helium.\nC. Lines of ionized calcium are the strongest in the spectrum; hydrogen lines show only moderate strength;\nlines of neutral and metals are present.\nD. The strongest lines are those of neutral metals and bands of titanium oxide.\n20. Look at the chemical elements inAppendix K. Can you identify any relationship between the abundance of\nan element and its atomic weight? Are there any obvious exceptions to this relationship?\n21. Appendix Ilists some of the nearest stars. Are most of these stars hotter or cooler than the Sun? Do any of\nthem emit more energy than the Sun? If so, which ones?\n22. Appendix Jlists the stars that appear brightest in our sky. Are most of these hotter or cooler than the Sun?\nCan you suggest a reason for the difference between this answer and the answer to the previous\nquestion? (Hint: Look at the luminosities.) Is there any tendency for a correlation between temperature\nand luminosity? Are there exceptions to the correlation?\n23. What star appears the brightest in the sky (other than the Sun)? The second brightest? What color is\nBetelgeuse? UseAppendix Jto find the answers.\n24. Suppose hominids one million years ago had left behind maps of the night sky. Would these maps\nrepresent accurately the sky that we see today? Why or why not?\n25. Why can only a lower limit to the rate of stellar rotation be determined from line broadening rather than\nthe actual rotation rate? (Refer toFigure 17.14.)\n26. Why do you think astronomers have suggested three different spectral types (L, T, and Y) for the brown\ndwarfs instead of M?

Two stars have proper motions of one arcsecond per year. Star A is 20 light-years from Earth, and Star B is\n10 light-years away from Earth. Which one has the faster velocity in space?\n30. Suppose there are three stars in space, each moving at 100 km/s. Star A is moving across (i.e.,\nperpendicular to) our line of sight, Star B is moving directly away from Earth, and Star C is moving away\nfrom Earth, but at a 30\u00b0 angle to the line of sight. From which star will you observe the greatest Doppler\nshift? From which star will you observe the smallest Doppler shift?\n31. What would you say to a friend who made this statement, \u201cThe visible-light spectrum of the Sun shows\nweak hydrogen lines and strong calcium lines. The Sun must therefore contain more calcium than\nhydrogen.\u201d?\nFiguring for Yourself\n32. InAppendix J, how much more luminous is the most luminous of the stars than the least luminous?\nForExercise 17.33throughExercise 17.38, use the equations relating magnitude and apparent brightness\ngiven in the section on the magnitude scale inThe Brightness of StarsandExample 17.1.\n33. Verify that if two stars have a difference of five magnitudes, this corresponds to a factor of 100 in the ratio\nthat 2.5 magnitudes corresponds to a factor of 10; and that 0.75 magnitudes corresponds to a\nfactor of 2.\n34. As seen from Earth, the Sun has an apparent magnitude of about \u221226.7. What is the apparent magnitude\nof the Sun as seen from Saturn, about 10 AU away? (Remember that one AU is the distance from Earth to\nthe Sun and that the brightness decreases as the inverse square of the distance.) Would the Sun still be\nthe brightest star in the sky?\n35. An astronomer is investigating a faint star that has recently been discovered in very sensitive surveys of\nthe sky. The star has a magnitude of 16. How much less bright is it than Antares, a star with magnitude\nroughly equal to 1?\n36. The center of a faint but active galaxy has magnitude 26. How much less bright does it look than the very\nfaintest star that our eyes can see, roughly magnitude 6? 584 17 \u2022 Exercises\n37. You have enough information from this chapter to estimate the distance to Alpha Centauri, the second\nnearest star, which has an apparent magnitude of 0. Since it is a G2 star, like the Sun, assume it has the\nsame luminosity as the Sun and the difference in magnitudes is a result only of the difference in distance.\nEstimate how far away Alpha Centauri is. Describe the necessary steps in words and then do the\ncalculation. (As we will learn in theCelestial Distanceschapter, this method\u2014namely, assuming that stars\nwith identical spectral types emit the same amount of energy\u2014is actually used to estimate distances to\nstars.) If you assume the distance to the Sun is in AU, your answer will come out in AU.\n38. Do the previous problem again, this time using the information that the Sun is 150,000,000 km away. You\nwill get a very large number of km as your answer. To get a better feeling for how the distances compare,\ntry calculating the time it takes light at a speed of 299,338 km/s to travel from the Sun to Earth and from\nAlpha Centauri to Earth. For Alpha Centauri, figure out how long the trip will take in years as well as in\nseconds.\n39. Star A and Star B have different apparent brightnesses but identical luminosities. If Star A is 20 light-years\naway from Earth and Star B is 40 light-years away from Earth, which star appears brighter and by what\nfactor?\n40. Star A and Star B have different apparent brightnesses but identical luminosities. Star A is 10 light-years\naway from Earth and appears 36 times brighter than Star B. How far away is Star B?\n41. The star Sirius A has an apparent magnitude of \u22121.5. Sirius A has a dim companion, Sirius B, which is\n10,000 times less bright than Sirius A. What is the apparent magnitude of Sirius B? Can Sirius B be seen\nwith the naked eye?\n42. Our Sun, a type G star, has a surface temperature of 5800 K. We know, therefore, that it is cooler than a\ntype O star and hotter than a type M star. Given what you learned about the temperature ranges of these\ntypes of stars, how many times hotter than our Sun is the hottest type O star? How many times cooler\nthan our Sun is the coolest type M star?\nAccess for free at openstax.org 18 \u2022 Thinking Ahead 585\n18\nThe Stars: A Celestial Census\nFigure18.1Variety of Stars.Stars come in a variety of sizes, masses, temperatures, and luminosities.

Because the stars in this cluster are all at about the same distance from us, the differences in apparent\nbrightness correspond to differences in luminosity; differences in temperature account for the differences in color.

How long do they live? And how do they die? Stop and think how hard it is to answer these\nquestions.\nStars live such a long time that nothing much can be gained from staring at one for a human lifetime. To\ndiscover how stars evolve from birth to death, it was necessary to measure the characteristics of many stars\n(to take a celestial census, in effect) and then determine which characteristics help us understand the stars\u2019\nlife stories. Astronomers tried a variety of hypotheses about stars until they came up with the right approach\nto understanding their development. But the key was first making a thorough census of the stars around us.\n18.1 A Stellar Census\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain why the stars visible to the unaided eye are not typical\nDescribe the distribution of stellar masses found close to the Sun\nBefore we can make our own survey, we need to agree on a unit of distance appropriate to the objects we are\nstudying. The stars are all so far away that kilometers (and even astronomical units) would be very 586 18 \u2022 The Stars: A Celestial Census\ncumbersome to use; so\u2014as discussed inScience and the Universe: A Brief Tour\u2014astronomers use a much\nlarger \u201cmeasuring stick\u201d called thelight-year. A light-year is the distance that light (the fastest signal we know)\ntravels in 1 year. Since light covers an astounding 300,000 kilometers per second, and since there are a lot of\nseconds in 1 year, a light-year is a very large quantity: 9.5 trillion (9.5 \u00d7 1012) kilometers to be exact. (Bear in\nmind that the light-year is a unit ofdistanceeven though the termyearappears in it.) If you drove at the legal\nUS speed limit without stopping for food or rest, you would not arrive at the end of a light-year in space until\nroughly 12 million years had passed. And the closest star is more than 4 light-years away.\nNotice that we have not yet said much about how such enormous distances can be measured. That is a\ncomplicated question, to which we will return inCelestial Distances. For now, let us assume that distances\nhave been measured for stars in our cosmic vicinity so that we can proceed with our census.\nSmall Is Beautiful\u2014Or at Least More Common\nWhen we do a census of people in the United States, we count the inhabitants by neighborhood. We can try\nthe same approach for our stellar census and begin with our own immediate neighborhood. As we shall see,\nwe run into two problems\u2014just as we do with a census of human beings. First, it is hard to be sure we have\ncountedallthe inhabitants; second, our local neighborhood may not contain all possible types of people.\n1\nTable 18.1shows an estimate of the number of stars of each spectral type in our own local\nneighborhood\u2014within 21 light-years of the Sun. (The Milky Way Galaxy, in which we live, is about 100,000 light-\nyears in diameter, so this figure really applies to averylocal neighborhood, one that contains atinyfraction of\nall the billions of stars in the Milky Way.) You can see that there are many more low-luminosity (and hence low\nmass) stars than high-luminosity ones. Only three of the stars in our local neighborhood (one F type and two A\ntypes) are significantly more luminous and more massive than the Sun. This is truly a case where small\ntriumphs over large\u2014at least in terms of numbers. The Sun is more massive than the vast majority of stars in\nour vicinity.\nStars within 21 Light-Years of the Sun\nSpectral Type Number of Stars\nA 2\nF 1\nG 7\nK 17\nM 94\nWhite dwarfs 8\nBrown dwarfs 33\nTable18.1\nThis table is based on data published through 2015, and it is likely that more faint objects remain to be\ndiscovered (seeFigure 18.2). Along with the L and T brown dwarfs already observed in our neighborhood,\n1 The spectral types of stars were defined and discussed inAnalyzing Starlight.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 18.1 \u2022 A Stellar Census 587\nastronomers expect to find perhaps hundreds of additional T dwarfs and Y dwarfs. Many of these are likely to\nbe even cooler than the coolest currently known T dwarf. The reason the lowest-mass dwarfs are so hard to\nfind is that they put out very little light\u2014ten thousand to a million times less light than the Sun. Only recently\nhas our technology progressed to the point that we can detect these dim, cool objects.\nFigure18.2Dwarf Simulation.This computer simulation shows the stars in our neighborhood as they would be seen from a\ndistance of 30 light-years away. The Sun is in the center. All the brown dwarfs are circled; those found earlier are circled in blue, the\nones found recently with the WISE infrared telescope in space (whose scientists put this diagram together) are circled in red. The\ncommon M stars, which are red and faint, are made to look brighter than they really would be so that you can see them in the\nsimulation. Note that luminous hot stars like our Sun are very rare. (credit: modification of work by NASA/ JPL-Caltech)\nTo put all this in perspective, we note that even though the stars counted in the table are our closest\nneighbors, you can\u2019t just look up at the night sky and see them without a telescope; stars fainter than the Sun\ncannot be seen with the unaided eye unless they areverynearby. For example, stars with luminosities ranging\nfrom 1/100 to 1/10,000 the luminosity of the Sun (L ) are very common, but a star with a luminosity of 1/100\nSun\nL would have to be within 5 light-years to be visible to the naked eye\u2014and only three stars (all in one\nSun\nsystem) are this close to us. The nearest of these three stars,Proxima Centauri, still cannot be seen without a\ntelescope because it has such a low luminosity.\nAstronomers are working hard these days to complete the census of our local neighborhood by finding our\nfaintest neighbors. Recent discoveries of nearby stars have relied heavily upon infrared telescopes that are\nable to find these many cool, low-mass stars. You should expect the number of known stars within 21 light-\nyears of the Sun to keep increasing as more and better surveys are undertaken.\nBright Does Not Necessarily Mean Close\nIf we confine our census to the local neighborhood, we will miss many of the most interesting kinds of stars.\nAfter all, the neighborhood in which you live does not contain all the types of people\u2014distinguished according\nto age, education, income, race, and so on\u2014that live in the entire country. For example, a few people do live to\nbe over 100 years old, but there may be no such individual within several miles of where you live. In order to\nsample the full range of the human population, you would have to extend your census to a much larger area.\nSimilarly, some types of stars simply are not found nearby.\nA clue that we are missing something in our stellar census comes from the fact that only six of the 20 stars that\nappear brightest in our sky\u2014Sirius,Vega, Altair, Alpha Centauri, Fomalhaut, and Procyon\u2014are found within 26\nlight-years of the Sun (Figure 18.3). Why are we missing most of the brightest stars when we take our census\nof the local neighborhood? 588 18 \u2022 The Stars: A Celestial Census\nFigure18.3The Closest Stars.(a) This image, taken with a wide-angle telescope at the European Southern Observatory in Chile,\nshows the system of three stars that is our nearest neighbor. (b) Two bright stars that are close to each other (Alpha CentauriA and\nB) blend their light together. (c) Indicated with an arrow (since you\u2019d hardly notice it otherwise) is the much fainterProxima Centauri\nstar, which is spectral type M. (credit: modification of work by ESO)\nThe answer, interestingly enough, is that the stars that appear brightest arenotthe ones closest to us. The\nbrightest stars look the way they do because they emit a very large amount of energy\u2014so much, in fact, that\nthey do not have to be nearby to look brilliant. You can confirm this by looking atAppendix J, which gives\ndistances for the 20 stars that appear brightest from Earth. The most distant of these stars is more than1000\nlight-yearsfrom us. In fact, it turns out that most of the stars visible without a telescope are hundreds of light-\nyears away and many times more luminous than the Sun. Among the 9000 stars visible to the unaided eye,\nonly about 50 are intrinsically fainter than the Sun. Note also that several of the stars inAppendix Jare spectral\ntype B, a type that is completely missing fromTable 18.1.\nThe most luminous of the bright stars listed inAppendix Jemit more than 50,000 times more energy than does\nthe Sun. These highly luminous stars are missing from the solar neighborhood because they are very rare.\nNone of them happens to be in the tiny volume of space immediately surrounding the Sun, and only this small\nvolume was surveyed to get the data shown inTable 18.1.\nFor example, let\u2019s consider the most luminous stars\u2014those 100 or more times as luminous as the Sun.\nAlthough such stars are rare, they are visible to the unaided eye, even when hundreds to thousands of light-\nyears away. A star with a luminosity 10,000 times greater than that of the Sun can be seen without a telescope\nout to a distance of 5000 light-years. The volume of space included within a distance of 5000 light-years,\nhowever, is enormous; so even though highly luminous stars are intrinsically rare, many of them are readily\nvisible to our unaided eye.\nThe contrast between these two samples of stars, those that are close to us and those that can be seen with\nthe unaided eye, is an example of aselection effect. When a population of objects (stars in this example)\nincludes a great variety of different types, we must be careful what conclusions we draw from an examination\nof any particular subgroup. Certainly we would be fooling ourselves if we assumed that the stars visible to the\nunaided eye are characteristic of the general stellar population; this subgroup is heavily weighted to the most\nluminous stars. It requires much more effort to assemble a complete data set for the nearest stars, since most\nare so faint that they can be observed only with a telescope. However, it is only by doing so that astronomers\nare able to know about the properties of the vast majority of the stars, which are actually much smaller and\nfainter than our own Sun. In the next section, we will look at how we measure some of these properties.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 18.2 \u2022 Measuring Stellar Masses 589\n18.2 Measuring Stellar Masses\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDistinguish the different types of binary star systems\nUnderstand how we can apply Newton\u2019s version of Kepler\u2019s third law to derive the sum ofstar masses in a\nbinary star system\nApply the relationship between stellar mass and stellar luminosity to determine the physical\ncharacteristics of a star\nThe mass of a star\u2014how much material it contains\u2014is one of its most important characteristics. If we know a\nstar\u2019s mass, as we shall see, we can estimate how long it will shine and what its ultimate fate will be. Yet the\nmass of a star is very difficult to measure directly. Somehow, we need to put a star on the cosmic equivalent of\na scale.\nLuckily, not all stars live like the Sun, in isolation from other stars. About half the stars arebinary stars\u2014two\nstars that orbit each other, bound together by gravity. Masses of binary stars can be calculated from\nmeasurements of their orbits, just as the mass of the Sun can be derived by measuring the orbits of the\nplanets around it (seeOrbits and Gravity).\nBinary Stars\nBefore we discuss in more detail how mass can be measured, we will take a closer look at stars that come in\npairs. The first binary star was discovered in 1650, less than half a century afterGalileobegan to observe the\nsky with a telescope. John Baptiste Riccioli (1598\u20131671), an Italian astronomer, noted that the star Mizar, in the\nmiddle of the Big Dipper\u2019s handle, appeared through his telescope as two stars. Since that discovery,\nthousands of binary stars have been cataloged. (Astronomers call any pair of stars that appear to be close to\neach other in the skydoublestars, but not all of these form a true binary, that is, not all of them are physically\nassociated. Some are just chance alignments of stars that are actually at different distances from us.) Although\nstars most commonly come in pairs, there are also triple and quadruple systems.\nOne well-known binary star is Castor, located in the constellation of Gemini. By 1804, astronomer William\nHerschel, who also discovered the planet Uranus, had noted that the fainter component of Castor had slightly\nchanged its position relative to the brighter component. (We use the term \u201ccomponent\u201d to mean a member of\na star system.) Here was evidence that one star was moving around another. It was actually the first evidence\nthat gravitational influences exist outside the solar system. The orbital motion of a binary star is shown in\nFigure 18.4. A binary star system in which both of the stars can be seen with a telescope is called avisual\nbinary. 590 18 \u2022 The Stars: A Celestial Census\nFigure18.4Revolution of a Binary Star.This figure shows seven observations of the mutual revolution of two stars, one a brown\ndwarf and one an ultra-cool L dwarf. Each red dot on the orbit, which is shown by the blue ellipse, corresponds to the position of one\nof the dwarfs relative to the other. The reason that the pair of stars looks different on the different dates is that some images were\ntaken with the Hubble Space Telescope and others were taken from the ground. The arrows point to the actual observations that\ncorrespond to the positions of each red dot. From these observations, an international team of astronomers directly measured the\nmass of an ultra-cool brown dwarf star for the first time. Barely the size of the planet Jupiter, the dwarf star weighs in at just 8.5% of\nthe mass of our Sun. (credit: modification of work by ESA/NASA and Herve Bouy (Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Extraterrestrische Physik/\nESO, Germany))\nEdward C.Pickering(1846\u20131919), at Harvard, discovered a second class of binary stars in 1889\u2014a class in\nwhich only one of the stars is actually seen directly. He was examining the spectrum of Mizar and found that\nthe dark absorption lines in the brighter star\u2019s spectrum were usually double. Not only were there two lines\nwhere astronomers normally saw only one, but the spacing of the lines was constantly changing. At times, the\nlines even became single. Pickering correctly deduced that the brighter component of Mizar, called Mizar A, is\nitself really two stars that revolve about each other in a period of 104 days. A star like Mizar A, which appears\nas a single star when photographed or observed visually through the telescope, but which spectroscopy shows\nreally to be a double star, is called aspectroscopic binary.\nMizar, by the way, is a good example of just how complex such star systems can be. Mizar has been known for\ncenturies to have a faint companion called Alcor, which can be seen without a telescope.MizarandAlcorform\nanoptical double\u2014a pair of stars that appear close together in the sky but do not orbit each other. Through a\ntelescope, as Riccioli discovered in 1650, Mizar can be seen to have another, closer companion that does orbit\nit; Mizar is thus a visual binary. The two components that make up this visual binary, known as Mizar A and\nMizar B, are both spectroscopic binaries. So, Mizar is really a quadruple system of stars.\nStrictly speaking, it is not correct to describe the motion of a binary star system by saying that one star orbits\nthe other. Gravity is amutualattraction. Each star exerts a gravitational force on the other, with the result that\nboth stars orbit a point between them called thecenter of mass. Imagine that the two stars are seated at\neither end of a seesaw. The point at which the fulcrum would have to be located in order for the seesaw to\nbalance is the center of mass, and it is always closer to the more massive star (Figure 18.5).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 18.2 \u2022 Measuring Stellar Masses 591\nFigure18.5Binary Star System.In a binary star system, both stars orbit their center of mass. The image shows the relative\npositions of two, different-mass stars from their center of mass, similar to how two masses would have to be located on a seesaw in\norder to keep it level. The star with the higher mass will be found closer to the center of mass, while the star with the lower mass will\nbe farther from it.\nFigure 18.6shows two stars (A and B) moving around their center of mass, along with one line in the spectrum\nof each star that we observe from the system at different times. When one star is approaching us relative to\nthe center of mass, the other star is receding from us. In the top left illustration, star A is moving toward us, so\nthe line in its spectrum is Doppler-shifted toward the blue end of the spectrum. Star B is moving away from us,\nso its line shows a redshift. When we observe the composite spectrum of the two stars, the line appears\ndouble. When the two stars are both moving across our line of sight (neither away from nor toward us), they\nboth have the same radial velocity (that of the pair\u2019s center of mass); hence, the spectral lines of the two stars\ncome together. This is shown in the two bottom illustrations inFigure 18.6.\nFigure18.6Motions of Two Stars Orbiting Each Other and What the Spectrum Shows.We see changes in velocity because when\none star is moving toward Earth, the other is moving away; half a cycle later, the situation is reversed. Doppler shifts cause the\nspectral lines to move back and forth. In diagrams 1 and 3, lines from both stars can be seen well separated from each other. When\nthe two stars are moving perpendicular to our line of sight (that is, they are not moving either toward or away from us), the two lines\nare exactly superimposed, and so in diagrams 2 and 4, we see only a single spectral line. Note that in the diagrams, the orbit of the\nstar pair is tipped slightly with respect to the viewer (or if the viewer were looking at it in the sky, the orbit would be tilted with\nrespect to the viewer\u2019s line of sight). If the orbit were exactly in the plane of the page or screen (or the sky), then it would look nearly\ncircular, but we would see no change in radial velocity (no part of the motion would be toward us or away from us.) If the orbit were\nperpendicular to the plane of the page or screen, then the stars would appear to move back and forth in a straight line, and we\nwould see the largest-possible radial velocity variations. This diagram has been simplified for clarity.

Note that positive velocity means\nthe star is moving away from us, and negative velocity means the star is moving toward us. The center of mass of the system itself is\nalso moving away from us, indicated by the positive velocity of 40 kilometers per second. The positions on the curve corresponding\nto the illustrations inFigure 18.6are marked with the diagram number (1\u20134).\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThisanimation(https://openstax.org/l/30binstaranim)lets you follow the orbits of a binary star system in\nvarious combinations of the masses of the two stars.\nMasses from the Orbits of Binary Stars\nWe can estimate the masses of binary star systems using Newton\u2019s reformulation of Kepler\u2019s third law\n(discussed inNewton\u2019s Universal Law of Gravitation). Kepler found that the time a planet takes to go around\nthe Sun is related by a specific mathematical formula to its distance from the Sun. In our binary star situation,\nif two objects are in mutual revolution, then the period (P) with which they go around each other is related to\nthe semimajor axis (D) of the orbit of one with respect to the other, according to this equation\nwhereDis in astronomical units,Pis measured in years, andM +M is the sum of the masses of the two stars\n1 2\nin units of the Sun\u2019s mass. This is a very useful formula for astronomers; it says that if we can observe the size\nof the orbit and the period of mutual revolution of the stars in a binary system, we can calculate the sum of\ntheir masses.\nMost spectroscopic binaries have periods ranging from a few days to a few months, with separations of\nusually less than 1 AU between their member stars. Recall that an AU is the distance from Earth to the Sun, so\nthis is a small separation and very hard to see at the distances of stars. This is why many of these systems are\nknown to be double only through careful study of their spectra.\nWe can analyze a radial velocity curve (such as the one inFigure 18.7) to determine the masses of the stars in a\nAccess for free at openstax.org 18.2 \u2022 Measuring Stellar Masses 593\nspectroscopic binary. This is complex in practice but not hard in principle. We measure the speeds of the stars\nfrom theDoppler effect. We then determine the period\u2014how long the stars take to go through an orbital\ncycle\u2014from the velocity curve. Knowing how fast the stars are moving and how long they take to go around\ntells us the circumference of the orbit and, hence, the separation of the stars in kilometers or astronomical\nunits. From Kepler\u2019s law, the period and the separation allow us to calculate the sum of the stars\u2019 masses.\nOf course, knowing the sum of the masses is not as useful as knowing the mass of each star separately. But\nthe relative orbital speeds of the two stars can tell us how much of the total mass each star has. As we saw in\nour seesaw analogy, the more massive star is closer to the center of mass and therefore has a smaller orbit.\nTherefore, it moves more slowly to get around in the same time compared to the more distant, lower-mass\nstar. If we sort out the speeds relative to each other, we can sort out the masses relative to each other. In\npractice, we also need to know how the binary system is oriented in the sky to our line of sight, but if we do,\nand the just-described steps are carried out carefully, the result is a calculation of the masses of each of the\ntwo stars in the system.\nTo summarize, a good measurement of the motion of two stars around a common center of mass, combined\nwith the laws of gravity, allows us to determine the masses of stars in such systems. These mass\nmeasurements are absolutely crucial to developing a theory of how stars evolve. One of the best things about\nthis method is that it is independent of the location of the binary system. It works as well for stars 100 light-\nyears away from us as for those in our immediate neighborhood.\nTo take a specific example,Siriusis one of the few binary stars inAppendix Jfor which we have enough\ninformation to apply Kepler\u2019s third law:\nIn this case, the two stars, the one we usually call Sirius and its very faint companion, are separated by about\n20 AU and have an orbital period of about 50 years. If we place these values in the formula we would have\nThis can be solved for the sum of the masses:\nTherefore, the sum of masses of the two stars in the Sirius binary system is 3.2 times the Sun\u2019s mass. In order\nto determine the individual mass of each star, we would need the velocities of the two stars and the\norientation of the orbit relative to our line of sight.\nThe Range of Stellar Masses\nHow large can the mass of a star be? Stars more massive than the Sun are rare. None of the stars within 30\nlight-years of the Sun has a mass greater than four times that of the Sun. Searches at large distances from the\nSun have led to the discovery of a few stars with masses up to about 100 times that of the Sun, and a handful\nof stars (a few out of several billion) may have masses as large as 250 solar masses. However, most stars have\nless mass than the Sun.\nAccording to theoretical calculations, the smallest mass that a true star can have is about 1/12 that of the Sun.\nBy a \u201ctrue\u201d star, astronomers mean one that becomes hot enough to fuse protons to form helium (as\ndiscussed inThe Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse). Objects with masses between roughly 1/100 and 1/12 that of\nthe Sun may produce energy for a brief time by means of nuclear reactions involving deuterium, but they do\nnot become hot enough to fuse protons. Such objects are intermediate in mass between stars and planets and\nhave been given the namebrown dwarfs(Figure 18.8). Brown dwarfs are similar toJupiterin radius but have\n2\nmasses from approximately 13 to 80 times larger than the mass of Jupiter. 594 18 \u2022 The Stars: A Celestial Census\nFigure18.8Brown Dwarfs in Orion.These images, taken with the Hubble Space Telescope, show the region surrounding the\nTrapezium star cluster inside the star-forming region called theOrion Nebula. (a) No brown dwarfs are seen in the visible light\nimage, both because they put out very little light in the visible and because they are hidden within the clouds of dust in this region.\n(b) This image was taken in infrared light, which can make its way to us through the dust. The faintest objects in this image are\nbrown dwarfs with masses between 13 and 80 times the mass of Jupiter. (credit a: NASA, C.R. O\u2019Dell and S.K. Wong (Rice University);\ncredit b: NASA; K.L. Luhman (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics) and G. Schneider, E. Young, G. Rieke, A. Cotera, H. Chen,\nM. Rieke, R. Thompson (Steward Observatory))\nStill-smaller objects with masses less than about 1/100 the mass of the Sun (or 10 Jupiter masses) are called\nplanets. They may radiate energy produced by the radioactive elements that they contain, and they may also\nradiate heat generated by slowly compressing under their own weight (a process called gravitational\ncontraction). However, their interiors will never reach temperatures high enough for any nuclear reactions, to\ntake place. Jupiter, whose mass is about 1/1000 the mass of the Sun, is unquestionably a planet, for example.\nUntil the 1990s, we could only detect planets in our own solar system, but now we have thousands of them\nelsewhere as well. (We will discuss these exciting observations inThe Birth of Stars and the Discovery of\nPlanets outside the Solar System.)\nThe Mass-Luminosity Relation\nNow that we have measurements of the characteristics of many different types of stars, we can search for\nrelationships among the characteristics. For example, we can ask whether the mass and luminosity of a star\nare related. It turns out that for most stars, they are: The more massive stars are generally also the more\nluminous. This relationship, known as themass-luminosity relation, is shown graphically inFigure 18.9. Each\npoint represents a star whose mass and luminosity are both known. The horizontal position on the graph\nshows the star\u2019s mass, given in units of the Sun\u2019s mass, and the vertical position shows its luminosity in units\nof the Sun\u2019s luminosity.\n2 Exactly where to put the dividing line between planets and brown dwarfs is a subject of some debate among astronomers as we\nwrite this book (as is, in fact, the exact definition of each of these objects). Even those who accept deuterium fusion (seeThe Birth of\nStars and the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar System) as the crucial issue for brown dwarfs concede that, depending on the\ncomposition of the star and other factors, the lowest mass for such a dwarf could be anywhere from 11 to 16 Jupiter masses.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 18.2 \u2022 Measuring Stellar Masses 595\nFigure18.9Mass-Luminosity Relation.The plotted points show the masses and luminosities of stars. The three points lying below\nthe sequence of points are all white dwarf stars.\nWe can also say this in mathematical terms.\nIt\u2019s a reasonably good approximation to say that luminosity (expressed in units of the Sun\u2019s luminosity) varies\nas the fourth power of the mass (in units of the Sun\u2019s mass). (The symbol ~ means the two quantities are\nproportional.) If two stars differ in mass by a factor of 2, then the more massive one will be 24, or about 16\ntimes brighter; if one star is 1/3 the mass of another, it will be approximately 81 times less luminous.\nEXAMPLE 18.1\nCalculating the Mass from the Luminosity of a Star\nThe mass-luminosity formula can be rewritten so that a value of mass can be determined if the luminosity is\nknown.\nSolution\nFirst, we must get our units right by expressing both the mass and the luminosity of a star in units of the\nSun\u2019s mass and luminosity:\nNow we can take the 4th root of both sides, which is equivalent to taking both sides to the 1/4 = 0.25 power.\nThe formula in this case would be:\nCheck Your Learning\nIn the previous section, we determined the sum of the masses of the two stars in theSiriusbinary system\n(Sirius and its faint companion) using Kepler\u2019s third law to be 3.2 solar masses. Using the mass-luminosity\nrelationship, calculate the mass of each individual star.\nAnswer:\nInAppendix J, Sirius is listed with a luminosity 23 times that of the Sun. This value can be inserted into the\nmass-luminosity relationship to get the mass of Sirius: 596 18 \u2022 The Stars: A Celestial Census\nThe mass of the companion star to Sirius is then 3.2 \u2013 2.2 = 1.0 solar mass.\nNotice how good this mass-luminosity relationship is. Most stars (seeFigure 18.9) fall along a line running\nfrom the lower-left (low mass, low luminosity) corner of the diagram to the upper-right (high mass, high\nluminosity) corner. About 90% of all stars obey the mass-luminosity relation. Later, we will explore why such a\nrelationship exists and what we can learn from the roughly 10% of stars that \u201cdisobey\u201d it.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThisvisualization(https://openstax.org/l/30starmass)illustrates how all the properties of a star are\ndetermined by the mass that the star happened to form with and how these properties change when you\nchange the mass.\n18.3 Diameters of Stars\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the methods used to determinestar diameters\nIdentify the parts of an eclipsing binary star light curve that correspond to the diameters of the individual\ncomponents\nIt is easy to measure the diameter of the Sun. Its angular diameter\u2014that is, its apparent size on the sky\u2014is\nabout 1/2\u00b0. If we know the angle the Sun takes up in the sky and how far away it is, we can calculate its true\n(linear) diameter, which is 1.39 million kilometers, or about 109 times the diameter of Earth.\nUnfortunately, the Sun is the only star whose angular diameter is easily measured. All the other stars are so far\naway that they look like pinpoints of light through even the largest ground-based telescopes. (They often seem\nto be bigger, but that is merely distortion introduced by turbulence in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.) Luckily, there are\nseveral techniques that astronomers can use to estimate the sizes of stars.\nStars Blocked by the Moon\nOne technique, which gives very precise diameters but can be used for only a few stars, is to observe the\ndimming of light that occurs when theMoonpasses in front of a star. What astronomers measure (with great\nprecision) is the time required for the star\u2019s brightness to drop to zero as the edge of the Moon moves across\nthe star\u2019s disk. Since we know how rapidly the Moon moves in its orbit around Earth, it is possible to calculate\nthe angular diameter of the star. If the distance to the star is also known, we can calculate its diameter in\nkilometers. This method works only for fairly bright stars that happen to lie along the zodiac, where the Moon\n(or, much more rarely, a planet) can pass in front of them as seen from Earth.\nEclipsing Binary Stars\nAccurate sizes for a large number of stars come from measurements ofeclipsing binarystar systems, and so\nwe must make a brief detour from our main story to examine this type of star system. Some binary stars are\nlined up in such a way that, when viewed from Earth, each star passes in front of the other during every\nrevolution (Figure 18.10). When one star blocks the light of the other, preventing it from reaching Earth, the\nbrightness of the system decreases, and astronomers say that an eclipse has occurred.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 18.3 \u2022 Diameters of Stars 597\nFigure18.10Light Curve of an Eclipsing Binary.The light curve of an eclipsing binary star system shows how the combined light\nfrom both stars changes due to eclipses over the time span of an orbit. This light curve shows the behavior of a hypothetical\neclipsing binary star with total eclipses (one star passes directly in front of and behind the other). The numbers indicate parts of the\nlight curve corresponding to various positions of the smaller star in its orbit. In this diagram, we have assumed that the smaller star\nis also the hotter one so that it emits more flux (energy per second per square meter) than the larger one. When the smaller, hotter\nstar goes behind the larger one, its light is completely blocked, and so there is a strong dip in the light curve. When the smaller star\ngoes in front of the bigger one, a small amount of light from the bigger star is blocked, so there is a smaller dip in the light curve.\nThe discovery of the first eclipsing binary helped solve a long-standing puzzle in astronomy. The star Algol, in\nthe constellation of Perseus, changes its brightness in an odd but regular way. Normally, Algol is a fairly bright\nstar, but at intervals of 2 days, 20 hours, 49 minutes, it fades to one-third of its regular brightness. After a few\nhours, it brightens to normal again. This effect is easily seen, even without a telescope, if you know what to\nlook for.\nIn 1783, a young English astronomer named JohnGoodricke(1764\u20131786) made a careful study ofAlgol(see the\nfeature onJohn Goodrickefor a discussion of his life and work). Even though Goodricke could neither hear nor\nspeak, he made a number of major discoveries in the 21 years of his brief life. He suggested that Algol\u2019s\nunusual brightness variations might be due to an invisible companion that regularly passes in front of the\nbrighter star and blocks its light. Unfortunately, Goodricke had no way to test this idea, since it was not until\nabout a century later that equipment became good enough to measure Algol\u2019s spectrum.\nIn 1889, the German astronomer HermannVogel(1841\u20131907) demonstrated that, like Mizar, Algol is a\nspectroscopic binary. The spectral lines of Algol were not observed to be double because the fainter star of the\npair gives off too-little light compared with the brighter star for its lines to be conspicuous in the composite\nspectrum. Nevertheless, the periodic shifting back and forth of the brighter star\u2019s lines gave evidence that it\nwas revolving about an unseen companion. (The lines of both components need not be visible for a star to be\nrecognized as a spectroscopic binary.)\nThe discovery that Algol is a spectroscopic binary verified Goodricke\u2019s hypothesis. The plane in which the stars\nrevolve is turned nearly edgewise to our line of sight, and each star passes in front of the other during every\nrevolution. (The eclipse of the fainter star in the Algol system is not very noticeable because the part of it that\nis covered contributes little to the total light of the system. This second eclipse can, however, be detected by\ncareful measurements.)\nAny binary star produces eclipses if viewed from the proper direction, near the plane of its orbit, so that one\nstar passes in front of the other (seeFigure 18.10). But from our vantage point on Earth, only a few binary star\nsystems are oriented in this way. 598 18 \u2022 The Stars: A Celestial Census\nMAKING CONNECTIONS\nAstronomy and Mythology: Algol the Demon Star and Perseus the Hero\n3\nThe nameAlgolcomes from the ArabicRas al Ghul, meaning \u201cthe demon\u2019s head.\u201d The word \u201cghoul\u201d in\nEnglish has the same derivation. As discussed inObserving the Sky: The Birth of Astronomy, many of the\nbright stars have Arabic names because during the long dark ages in medieval Europe, it was Arabic\nastronomers who preserved and expanded the Greek and Roman knowledge of the skies. The reference to\nthe demon is part of the ancient Greek legend of the hero Perseus, who is commemorated by the\nconstellation in which we find Algol and whose adventures involve many of the characters associated with\nthe northern constellations.\nPerseus was one of the many half-god heroes fathered by Zeus (Jupiter in the Roman version), the king of\nthe gods in Greek mythology. Zeus had, to put it delicately, a roving eye and was always fathering\nsomebody or other with a human maiden who caught his fancy. (Perseus derives fromPer Zeus, meaning\n\u201cfathered by Zeus.\u201d) Set adrift with his mother by an (understandably) upset stepfather, Perseus grew up\non an island in the Aegean Sea. The king there, taking an interest in Perseus\u2019 mother, tried to get rid of the\nyoung man by assigning him an extremely difficult task.\nIn a moment of overarching pride, a beautiful young woman named Medusa had compared her golden hair\nto that of the goddess Athena (Minerva for the Romans). The Greek gods did not take kindly to being\ncompared to mere mortals, and Athena turned Medusa into a gorgon: a hideous, evil creature with writhing\nsnakes for hair and a face that turned anyone who looked at it into stone. Perseus was given the task of\nslaying this demon, which seemed like a pretty sure way to get him out of the way forever.\nBut because Perseus had a god for a father, some of the other gods gave him tools for the job, including\nAthena\u2019s reflective shield and the winged sandals of Hermes (Mercury in the Roman story). By flying over\nher and looking only at her reflection, Perseus was able to cut off Medusa\u2019s head without ever looking at\nher directly. Taking her head (which, conveniently, could still turn onlookers to stone even without being\nattached to her body) with him, Perseus continued on to other adventures.\nHe next came to a rocky seashore, where boasting had gotten another family into serious trouble with the\ngods. Queen Cassiopeia had dared to compare her own beauty to that of the Nereids, sea nymphs who\nwere daughters of Poseidon (Neptune in Roman mythology), the god of the sea. Poseidon was so offended\nthat he created a sea-monster named Cetus to devastate the kingdom. King Cepheus, Cassiopeia\u2019s\nbeleaguered husband, consulted the oracle, who told him that he must sacrifice his beautiful daughter\nAndromeda to the monster.\nWhen Perseus came along and found Andromeda chained to a rock near the sea, awaiting her fate, he\nrescued her by turning the monster to stone. (Scholars of mythology actually trace the essence of this story\nback to far-older legends from ancient Mesopotamia, in which the god-hero Marduk vanquishes a monster\nnamed Tiamat. Symbolically, a hero like Perseus or Marduk is usually associated with the Sun, the monster\nwith the power of night, and the beautiful maiden with the fragile beauty of dawn, which the Sun releases\nafter its nightly struggle with darkness.)\nMany of the characters in these Greek legends can be found as constellations in the sky, not necessarily\nresembling their namesakes but serving as reminders of the story. For example, vain Cassiopeia is\nsentenced to be very close to the celestial pole, rotating perpetually around the sky and hanging upside\ndown every winter. The ancients imagined Andromeda still chained to her rock (it is much easier to see the\nchain of stars than to recognize the beautiful maiden in this star grouping). Perseus is next to her with the\n3 Fans of Batman comic books and movies will recognize that this name was given to an archvillain in the series.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 18.3 \u2022 Diameters of Stars 599\nhead of Medusa swinging from his belt. Algol represents this gorgon head and has long been associated\nwith evil and bad fortune in such tales. Some commentators have speculated that the star\u2019s change in\nbrightness (which can be observed with the unaided eye) may have contributed to its unpleasant\nreputation, with the ancients regarding such a change as a sort of evil \u201cwink.\u201d\nDiameters of Eclipsing Binary Stars\nWe now turn back to the main thread of our story to discuss how all this can be used to measure the sizes of\nstars. The technique involves making a light curve of an eclipsing binary, a graph that plots how the brightness\nchanges with time. Let us consider a hypothetical binary system in which the stars are very different in size,\nlike those illustrated inFigure 18.11. To make life easy, we will assume that the orbit is viewed exactly edge-on.\nEven though we cannot see the two stars separately in such a system, the light curve can tell us what is\nhappening. When the smaller star just starts to pass behind the larger star (a point we callfirst contact), the\nbrightness begins to drop. The eclipse becomes total (the smaller star is completely hidden) at the point called\nsecond contact. At the end of the total eclipse (thirdcontact),the smaller star begins to emerge. When the\nsmaller star has reachedlast contact, the eclipse is completely over.\nTo see how this allows us to measure diameters, look carefully atFigure 18.11. During the time interval\nbetween the first and second contacts, the smaller star has moved a distance equal to its own diameter.\nDuring the time interval from the first to third contacts, the smaller star has moved a distance equal to the\ndiameter of the larger star. If the spectral lines of both stars are visible in the spectrum of the binary, then the\nspeed of the smaller star with respect to the larger one can be measured from the Doppler shift. But knowing\nthe speed with which the smaller star is moving and how long it took to cover some distance can tell the span\nof that distance\u2014in this case, the diameters of the stars. The speed multiplied by the time interval from the\nfirst to second contact gives the diameter of the smaller star. We multiply the speed by the time between the\nfirst and third contacts to get the diameter of the larger star.\nFigure18.11Light Curve of an Edge-On Eclipsing Binary.Here we see the light curve of a hypothetical eclipsing binary star whose\norbit we view exactly edge-on, in which the two stars fully eclipse each other. From the time intervals between contacts, it is possible\nto estimate the diameters of the two stars.\nIn actuality, the situation with eclipsing binaries is often a bit more complicated: orbits are generally not seen\nexactly edge-on, and the light from each star may be only partially blocked by the other. Furthermore, binary\nstar orbits, just like the orbits of the planets, are ellipses, not circles. However, all these effects can be sorted 600 18 \u2022 The Stars: A Celestial Census\nout from very careful measurements of the light curve.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTheEclipsing Binary Simulator(https://openstax.org/l/30eclipsbinsim)allows you to explore how the\neclipse timing can be used to determine the size of stars in a binary pair. Other traits can be explored as\nwell, such as their mass, separation, and surface temperatures.\nUsing the Radiation Law to Get the Diameter\nAnother method for measuring star diameters makes use of the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the relationship\nbetween energy radiated and temperature (seeRadiation and Spectra). In this method, theenergy flux\n(energy emitted per second per square meter by a blackbody, like the Sun) is given by\nwhere \u03c3 is a constant andTis the temperature. The surface area of a sphere (like a star) is given by\nThe luminosity (L) of a star is then given by its surface area in square meters times the energy flux:\nPreviously, we determined the masses of the two stars in theSiriusbinary system. Sirius gives off 8200 times\nmore energy than its fainter companion star, although both stars have nearly identical temperatures. The\nextremely large difference in luminosity is due to the difference in radius, since the temperatures and hence\nthe energy fluxes for the two stars are nearly the same. To determine the relative sizes of the two stars, we\ntake the ratio of the corresponding luminosities:\nTherefore, the relative sizes of the two stars can be found by taking the square root of the relative luminosity.\nSince , the radius of Sirius is 91 times larger than the radius of its faint companion.\nThe method for determining the radius shown here requires both stars be visible, which is not always the case.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nUse theStellar Luminosity Simulato(https://openstax.org/l/30stellumsim)to explore the relationship\nbetween a star\u2019s surface temperature, luminosity, and radius.

However, there are some dramatic exceptions to this simple\ngeneralization.\nA few of the very luminous stars, those that are also red (indicating relatively low surface temperatures), turn\nout to be truly enormous.

If you want to understand humans by comparing and contrasting their\ncharacteristics\u2014without assuming any previous knowledge of these strange creatures\u2014you could try to\ndetermine which characteristics lead you in a fruitful direction. For example, you might plot the heights of a\nlarge sample of humans against their weights (which is a measure of their mass). Such a plot is shown in\nFigure 18.12and it has some interesting features. In the way we have chosen to present our data, height\nincreases upward, whereas weight increases to the left. Notice that humans are not randomly distributed in\nthe graph. Most points fall along a sequence that goes from the upper left to the lower right.\nFigure18.12Height versus Weight.The plot of the heights and weights of a representative group of human beings. Most points lie\nalong a \u201cmain sequence\u201d representing most people, but there are a few exceptions.\nWe can conclude from this graph that human height and weight are related. Generally speaking, taller human\nbeings weigh more, whereas shorter ones weigh less. This makes sense if you are familiar with the structure of\nhuman beings. Typically, if we have bigger bones, we have more flesh to fill out our larger frame. It\u2019s not\nmathematically exact\u2014there is a wide range of variation\u2014but it\u2019s not a bad overall rule. And, of course, there\nare some dramatic exceptions. You occasionally see a short human who is very overweight and would thus be\nmore to the bottom left of our diagram than the average sequence of people. Or you might have a very tall,\nskinny fashion model with great height but relatively small weight, who would be found near the upper right.\nA similar diagram has been found extremely useful for understanding the lives of stars. In 1913, American\nastronomer Henry NorrisRussellplotted the luminosities of stars against their spectral classes (a way of\ndenoting their surface temperatures). This investigation, and a similar independent study in 1911 by Danish\nastronomer EjnarHertzsprung, led to the extremely important discovery that the temperature and luminosity\nof stars are related (Figure 18.13).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 18.4 \u2022 The H\u2013R Diagram 603\nFigure18.13Hertzsprung (1873\u20131967) and Russell (1877\u20131957).(a) Ejnar Hertzsprung and (b) Henry Norris Russell independently\ndiscovered the relationship between the luminosity and surface temperature of stars that is summarized in what is now called the\nH\u2013R diagram.\nVOYAGERS IN ASTRONOMY\nHenry Norris Russell\nWhen Henry NorrisRussellgraduated from Princeton University, his work had been so brilliant that the\nfaculty decided to create a new level of honors degree beyond \u201csumma cum laude\u201d for him. His students\nlater remembered him as a man whose thinking was three times faster than just about anybody else\u2019s. His\nmemory was so phenomenal, he could correctly quote an enormous number of poems and limericks, the\nentire Bible, tables of mathematical functions, and almost anything he had learned about astronomy. He\nwas nervous, active, competitive, critical, and very articulate; he tended to dominate every meeting he\nattended. In outward appearance, he was an old-fashioned product of the nineteenth century who wore\nhigh-top black shoes and high starched collars, and carried an umbrella every day of his life. His 264 papers\nwere enormously influential in many areas of astronomy.\nBorn in 1877, the son of a Presbyterian minister, Russell showed early promise. When he was 12, his family\nsent him to live with an aunt in Princeton so he could attend a top preparatory school. He lived in the same\nhouse in that town until his death in 1957 (interrupted only by a brief stay in Europe for graduate work). He\nwas fond of recounting that both his mother and his maternal grandmother had won prizes in\nmathematics, and that he probably inherited his talents in that field from their side of the family.\nBefore Russell, American astronomers devoted themselves mainly to surveying the stars and making\nimpressive catalogs of their properties, especially their spectra (as described inAnalyzing Starlight. Russell\nbegan to see that interpreting the spectra of stars required a much more sophisticated understanding of\nthe physics of the atom, a subject that was being developed by European physicists in the 1910s and 1920s.\nRussell embarked on a lifelong quest to ascertain the physical conditions inside stars from the clues in their\nspectra; his work inspired, and was continued by, a generation of astronomers, many trained by Russell and\nhis collaborators.\nRussell also made important contributions in the study of binary stars and the measurement of star\nmasses, the origin of the solar system, the atmospheres of planets, and the measurement of distances in\nastronomy, among other fields. He was an influential teacher and popularizer of astronomy, writing a\ncolumn on astronomical topics forScientific Americanmagazine for more than 40 years. He and two\ncolleagues wrote a textbook for college astronomy classes that helped train astronomers and astronomy\nenthusiasts over several decades. That book set the scene for the kind of textbook you are now reading,\nwhich not only lays out the facts of astronomy but also explains how they fit together. Russell gave lectures 604 18 \u2022 The Stars: A Celestial Census\naround the country, often emphasizing the importance of understanding modern physics in order to grasp\nwhat was happening in astronomy.\nHarlow Shapley, director of the Harvard College Observatory, called Russell \u201cthe dean of American\nastronomers.\u201d Russell was certainly regarded as the leader of the field for many years and was consulted\non many astronomical problems by colleagues from around the world. Today, one of the highest\nrecognitions that an astronomer can receive is an award from the American Astronomical Society called the\nRussell Prize, set up in his memory.\nFeatures of the H\u2013R Diagram\nFollowing Hertzsprung and Russell, let us plot the temperature (or spectral class) of a selected group of nearby\nstars against their luminosity and see what we find (Figure 18.14). Such a plot is frequently called the\nHertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram, abbreviatedH\u2013R diagram. It is one of the most important and widely used\ndiagrams in astronomy, with applications that extend far beyond the purposes for which it was originally\ndeveloped more than a century ago.\nFigure18.14H\u2013R Diagram for a Selected Sample of Stars.In such diagrams, luminosity is plotted along the vertical axis. Along the\nhorizontal axis, we can plot either temperature or spectral type (also sometimes called spectral class). Several of the brightest stars\nare identified by name. Most stars fall on the main sequence.\nIt is customary to plot H\u2013R diagrams in such a way that temperature increases toward the left and luminosity\ntoward the top. Notice the similarity to our plot of height and weight for people (Figure 18.12). Stars, like\npeople, are not distributed over the diagram at random, as they would be if they exhibited all combinations of\nluminosity and temperature. Instead, we see that the stars cluster into certain parts of the H\u2013R diagram. The\ngreat majority are aligned along a narrow sequence running from the upper left (hot, highly luminous) to the\nlower right (cool, less luminous). This band of points is called themain sequence. It represents a relationship\nbetweentemperatureandluminositythat is followed by most stars. We can summarize this relationship by\nAccess for free at openstax.org 18.4 \u2022 The H\u2013R Diagram 605\nsaying that hotter stars are more luminous than cooler ones.\nA number of stars, however, lie above the main sequence on the H\u2013R diagram, in the upper-right region,\nwhere stars have low temperature and high luminosity. How can a star be at once cool, meaning each square\nmeter on the star does not put out all that much energy, and yet very luminous? The only way is for the star to\nbe enormous\u2014to have so many square meters on its surface that thetotalenergy output is still large. These\nstars must begiantsorsupergiants, the stars of huge diameter we discussed earlier.\nThere are also some stars in the lower-left corner of the diagram, which have high temperature and low\nluminosity. If they have high surface temperatures, each square meter on that star puts out a lot of energy.\nHow then can the overall star be dim? It must be that it has a very small total surface area; such stars are\nknown aswhite dwarfs(white because, at these high temperatures, the colors of the electromagnetic\nradiation that they emit blend together to make them look bluish-white). We will say more about these\npuzzling objects in a moment.Figure 18.15is a schematic H\u2013R diagram for a large sample of stars, drawn to\nmake the different types more apparent.\nFigure18.15Schematic H\u2013R Diagram for Many Stars.Ninety percent of all stars on such a diagram fall along a narrow band called\nthe main sequence. A minority of stars are found in the upper right; they are both cool (and hence red) and bright, and must be\ngiants. Some stars fall in the lower left of the diagram; they are both hot and dim, and must be white dwarfs.\nNow, think back to our discussion of star surveys. It is difficult to plot an H\u2013R diagram that is truly\nrepresentative of all stars because most stars are so faint that we cannot see those outside our immediate\nneighborhood. The stars plotted inFigure 18.14were selected because their distances are known. This sample\nomits many intrinsically faint stars that are nearby but have not had their distances measured, so it shows\nfewer faint main-sequence stars than a \u201cfair\u201d diagram would. To be truly representative of the stellar\npopulation, an H\u2013R diagram should be plotted for all stars within a certain distance. Unfortunately, our\nknowledge is reasonably complete only for stars within 10 to 20 light-years of the Sun, among which there are\nno giants or supergiants. Still, from many surveys (and more can now be done with new, more powerful\ntelescopes), we estimate that about 90% of the true stars overall (excluding brown dwarfs) in our part of space\nare main-sequence stars, about 10% are white dwarfs, and fewer than 1% are giants or supergiants.\nThese estimates can be used directly to understand the lives of stars. Permit us another quick analogy with\npeople. Suppose we survey people just like astronomers survey stars, but we want to focus our attention on\nthe location of young people, ages 6 to 18 years. Survey teams fan out and take data about where such\nyoungsters are found at all times during a 24-hour day. Some are found in the local pizza parlor, others are\nasleep at home, some are at the movies, and many are in school. After surveying a very large number of young\npeople, one of the things that the teams determine is that, averaged over the course of the 24 hours, one-third\nof all youngsters are found in school. 606 18 \u2022 The Stars: A Celestial Census\nHow can they interpret this result? Does it mean that two-thirds of students are truants and the remaining\none-third spend all their time in school? No, we must bear in mind that the survey teams counted youngsters\nthroughout the full 24-hour day. Some survey teams worked at night, when most youngsters were at home\nasleep, and others worked in the late afternoon, when most youngsters were on their way home from school\n(and more likely to be enjoying a pizza). If the survey was truly representative, wecanconclude, however, that\nif an average of one-third of all youngsters are found in school, then humans ages 6 to 18 years must spend\nabout one-third oftheir timein school.\nWe can do something similar for stars. We find that, on average, 90% of all stars are located on the main\nsequence of the H\u2013R diagram. If we can identify some activity or life stage with the main sequence, then it\nfollows that stars must spend 90% of their lives in that activity or life stage.\nUnderstanding the Main Sequence\nInThe Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse, we discussed the Sun as a representative star. We saw that what stars such\nas the Sun \u201cdo for a living\u201d is to convert protons into helium deep in their interiors via the process of nuclear\nfusion, thus producing energy. The fusion of protons to helium is an excellent, long-lasting source of energy\nfor a star because the bulk of every star consists of hydrogen atoms, whose nuclei are protons.\nOur computer models of how stars evolve over time show us that a typical star will spend about 90% of its life\nfusing the abundant hydrogen in its core into helium. This then is a good explanation of why 90% of all stars\nare found on the main sequence in the H\u2013R diagram. But if all the stars on themain sequenceare doing the\nsame thing (fusing hydrogen), why are they distributed along a sequence of points? That is, why do they differ\nin luminosity and surface temperature (which is what we are plotting on the H\u2013R diagram)?\nTo help us understand how main-sequence stars differ, we can use one of the most important results from our\nstudies of model stars. Astrophysicists have been able to show that the structure of stars that are in\nequilibrium and derive all their energy from nuclear fusion is completely and uniquely determined by just two\nquantities: thetotal massand thecompositionof the star. This fact provides an interpretation of many\nfeatures of the H\u2013R diagram.\nImagine a cluster of stars forming from a cloud of interstellar \u201craw material\u201d whose chemical composition is\nsimilar to the Sun\u2019s. (We\u2019ll describe this process in more detail inThe Birth of Stars and Discovery of Planets\noutside the Solar System, but for now, the details will not concern us.) In such a cloud, all the clumps of gas\nand dust that become stars begin with the same chemical composition and differ from one another only in\nmass. Now suppose that we compute a model of each of these stars for the time at which it becomes stable\nand derives its energy from nuclear reactions, but before it has time to alter its composition appreciably as a\nresult of these reactions.\nThe models calculated for these stars allow us to determine their luminosities, temperatures, and sizes. If we\nplot the results from the models\u2014one point for each model star\u2014on the H\u2013R diagram, we get something that\nlooks just like the main sequence we saw for real stars.\nAnd here is what we find when we do this. The model stars with the largest masses are the hottest and most\nluminous, and they are located at the upper left of the diagram.\nThe least-massive model stars are the coolest and least luminous, and they are placed at the lower right of the\nplot. The other model stars all lie along a line running diagonally across the diagram. In other words,the main\nsequence turns out to be a sequence of stellar masses.\nThis makes sense if you think about it. The most massive stars have the most gravity and can thus compress\ntheir centers to the greatest degree. This means they are the hottest inside and the best at generating energy\nfrom nuclear reactions deep within. As a result, they shine with the greatest luminosity and have the hottest\nsurface temperatures. The stars with lowest mass, in turn, are the coolest inside and least effective in\ngenerating energy. Thus, they are the least luminous and wind up being the coolest on the surface. Our Sun\nAccess for free at openstax.org 18.4 \u2022 The H\u2013R Diagram 607\nlies somewhere in the middle of these extremes (as you can see inFigure 18.14). The characteristics of\nrepresentativemain-sequence stars(excluding brown dwarfs, which are not true stars) are listed inTable 18.3.\nCharacteristics of Main-Sequence Stars\nSpectral Type Mass (Sun = 1) Luminosity (Sun = 1) Temperature Radius (Sun = 1)\nO5 40 7 \u00d7 105 40,000 K 18\nB0 16 2.7 \u00d7 105 28,000 K 7\nA0 3.3 55 10,000 K 2.5\nF0 1.7 5 7500 K 1.4\nG0 1.1 1.4 6000 K 1.1\nK0 0.8 0.35 5000 K 0.8\nM0 0.4 0.05 3500 K 0.6\nTable18.3\nNote that we\u2019ve seen this 90% figure come up before. This is exactly what we found earlier when we examined\nthe mass-luminosity relation (Figure 18.9). We observed that 90% of all stars seem to follow the relationship;\nthese are the 90% of all stars that lie on the main sequence in our H\u2013R diagram. Our models and our\nobservations agree.\nWhat about the other stars on the H\u2013R diagram\u2014the giants and supergiants, and the white dwarfs? As we will\nsee in the next few chapters, these are what main-sequence stars turn into as they age: They are the later\nstages in a star\u2019s life. As a star consumes its nuclear fuel, its source of energy changes, as do its chemical\ncomposition and interior structure. These changes cause the star to alter its luminosity and surface\ntemperature so that it no longer lies on the main sequence on our diagram. Because stars spend much less\ntime in these later stages of their lives, we see fewer stars in those regions of the H\u2013R diagram.\nExtremes of Stellar Luminosities, Diameters, and Densities\nWe can use the H\u2013R diagram to explore the extremes in size, luminosity, and density found among the stars.\nSuch extreme stars are not only interesting to fans of theGuinness Book of World Records; they can teach us a\nlot about how stars work. For example, we saw that the most massive main-sequence stars are the most\nluminous ones. We know of a few extreme stars that are a million times more luminous than the Sun, with\nmasses that exceed 100 times the Sun\u2019s mass. These superluminous stars, which are at the upper left of the\nH\u2013R diagram, are exceedingly hot, very blue stars of spectral type O. These are the stars that would be the\nmost conspicuous at vast distances in space.\nThe cool supergiants in the upper corner of the H\u2013R diagram are as much as 10,000 times as luminous as the\nSun. In addition, these stars have diameters very much larger than that of the Sun. As discussed above, some\nsupergiants are so large that if the solar system could be centered in one, the star\u2019s surface would lie beyond\nthe orbit of Mars (seeFigure 18.16). We will have to ask, in coming chapters, what process can make a star\nswell up to such an enormous size, and how long these \u201cswollen\u201d stars can last in their distended state. 608 18 \u2022 The Stars: A Celestial Census\nFigure18.16The Sun and a Supergiant.Here you see how small the Sun looks in comparison to one of the largest known stars: VY\nCanis Majoris, a supergiant.\nIn contrast, the very common red, cool, low-luminosity stars at the lower end of the main sequence are much\nsmaller and more compact than the Sun. An example of such a red dwarf is Ross 614B, with a surface\ntemperature of 2700 K and only 1/2000 of the Sun\u2019s luminosity. We call such a star a dwarf because its\ndiameter is only 1/10 that of the Sun. A star with such a low luminosity also has a low mass (about 1/12 that of\nthe Sun). This combination of mass and diameter means that it is so compressed that the star has an average\ndensity about 80 times that of the Sun. Its density must be higher, in fact, than that of any known solid found\non the surface of Earth. (Despite this, the star is made of gas throughout because its center is so hot.)\nThe faint, red, main-sequence stars are not the stars of the most extreme densities, however. The white\ndwarfs, at the lower-left corner of the H\u2013R diagram, have densities many times greater still.\nThe White Dwarfs\nThe firstwhite dwarfstar was detected in 1862. CalledSiriusB, it forms a binary system with Sirius A, the\nbrightest-appearing star in the sky. It eluded discovery and analysis for a long time because its faint light\ntends to be lost in the glare of nearby Sirius A (Figure 18.17). (Since Sirius is often called the Dog Star\u2014being\nthe brightest star in the constellation of Canis Major, the big dog\u2014Sirius B is sometimes nicknamed the Pup.)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 18.4 \u2022 The H\u2013R Diagram 609\nFigure18.17Two Views of Sirius and Its White Dwarf Companion.(a) The (visible light) image, taken with the Hubble Space\nTelescope, shows bright Sirius A, and, below it and off to its left, faint Sirius B. (b) This image of theSiriusstar system was taken with\nthe Chandra X-Ray Telescope. Now, the bright object is the white dwarf companion, Sirius B. Sirius A is the faint object above it; what\nwe are seeing from Sirius is probably not actually X-ray radiation but rather ultraviolet light that has leaked into the detector. Note\nthat the ultraviolet intensities of these two objects are completely reversed from the situation in visible light because Sirius B is\nhotter and emits more higher-frequency radiation.

A good example of a typical white dwarf is the nearby\nstar 40 Eridani B. Its surface temperature is a relatively hot 12,000 K, but its luminosity is only 1/275L .\nSun\nCalculations show that its radius is only 1.4% of the Sun\u2019s, or about the same as that of Earth, and its volume is\n2.5 \u00d7 10\u20136that of the Sun. Its mass, however, is 0.57 times the Sun\u2019s mass, just a little more than half. To fit\nsuch a substantial mass into so tiny a volume, the star\u2019s density must be about 210,000 times the density of\nthe Sun, or more than 300,000 g/cm3. A teaspoonful of this material would have a mass of some 1.6 tons! At\nsuch enormous densities, matter cannot exist in its usual state; we will examine the particular behavior of this\ntype of matter inThe Death of Stars. For now, we just note that white dwarfs are dying stars, reaching the end\nof their productive lives and ready for their stories to be over.\nThe British astrophysicist (and science popularizer) ArthurEddington(1882\u20131944) described the first known\nwhite dwarf this way:\nThe message of the companion ofSirius, when decoded, ran: \u201cI am composed of material three thousand\ntimes denser than anything you\u2019ve ever come across. A ton of my material would be a little nugget you could\nput in a matchbox.\u201d What reply could one make to something like that? Well, the reply most of us made in\n1914 was, \u201cShut up; don\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201d\nToday, however, astronomers not only accept that stars as dense as white dwarfs exist but (as we will see)\nhave found even denser and stranger objects in their quest to understand the evolution of different types of\nstars.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nUse thisinteractive H-R diagram(https://openstax.org/l/30interhr)to explore the sizes of stars based on\ntheir placement.

We find the stars that appear\nbrightest to our eyes are bright primarily because they are intrinsically very luminous, not because they are\nthe closest to us. Most of the nearest stars are intrinsically so faint that they can be seen only with the aid of a\ntelescope. Stars with low mass and low luminosity are much more common than stars with high mass and\nhigh luminosity. Most of the brown dwarfs in the local neighborhood have not yet been discovered.\n18.2Measuring Stellar Masses\nThe masses of stars can be determined by analysis of the orbit of binary stars\u2014two stars that orbit a common\ncenter of mass. In visual binaries, the two stars can be seen separately in a telescope, whereas in a\nspectroscopic binary, only the spectrum reveals the presence of two stars. Stellar masses range from about 1/\n12 to more than 100 times the mass of the Sun (in rare cases, going to 250 times the Sun\u2019s mass). Objects with\nmasses between 1/12 and 1/100 that of the Sun are called brown dwarfs. Objects in which no nuclear reactions\ncan take place are planets. The most massive stars are, in most cases, also the most luminous, and this\ncorrelation is known as the mass-luminosity relation.\n18.3Diameters of Stars\nThe diameters of stars can be determined by measuring the time it takes an object (the Moon, a planet, or a\ncompanion star) to pass in front of it and block its light. Diameters of members of eclipsing binary systems\n(where the stars pass in front of each other) can be determined through analysis of their orbital motions.\n18.4The H\u2013R Diagram\nThe Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram, or H\u2013R diagram, is a plot of stellar luminosity against surface temperature.\nMost stars lie on the main sequence, which extends diagonally across the H\u2013R diagram from high temperature\nand high luminosity to low temperature and low luminosity. The position of a star along the main sequence is\ndetermined by its mass. High-mass stars emit more energy and are hotter than low-mass stars on the main\nAccess for free at openstax.org 18 \u2022 For Further Exploration 611\nsequence. Main-sequence stars derive their energy from the fusion of protons to helium. About 90% of the\nstars lie on the main sequence. Only about 10% of the stars are white dwarfs, and fewer than 1% are giants or\nsupergiants.\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nCroswell, K. \u201cThe Periodic Table of the Cosmos.\u201dScientific American(July 2011):45\u201349.

Two stars are seen close together in the sky, and your group is given the task of determining whether they 612 18 \u2022 Exercises\nare a visual binary or whether they just happen to be seen in nearly the same direction. You have access to\na good observatory. Make a list of the types of measurements you would make to determine whether they\norbit each other.\nB. Your group is given information about five main sequence stars that are among the brightest-appearing\nstars in the sky and yet are pretty far away. Where would these stars be on the H\u2013R diagram and why?\nNext, your group is given information about five main-sequence stars that are typical of the stars closest\nto us. Where would these stars be on the H\u2013R diagram and why?\nC. A very wealthy (but eccentric) alumnus of your college donates a lot of money for a fund that will help in\nthe search for more brown dwarfs. Your group is the committee in charge of this fund. How would you\nspend the money? (Be as specific as you can, listing instruments and observing programs.)\nD. Use the internet to search for information about the stars with the largest known diameter. What star is\nconsidered the record holder (this changes as new measurements are made)? Read about some of the\nlargest stars on the web. Can your group list some reasons why it might be hard to know which star is the\nlargest?\nE. Use the internet to search for information about stars with the largest mass. What star is the current\n\u201cmass champion\u201d among stars? Try to research how the mass of one or more of the most massive stars\nwas measured, and report to the group or the whole class.\nExercises\nReview Questions\n1. How does the mass of the Sun compare with that of other stars in our local neighborhood?\n2. Name and describe the three types of binary systems.\n3. Describe two ways of determining the diameter of a star.\n4. What are the largest- and smallest-known values of the mass, luminosity, surface temperature, and\ndiameter of stars (roughly)?\n5. You are able to take spectra of both stars in an eclipsing binary system. List all properties of the stars that\ncan be measured from their spectra and light curves.\n6. Sketch an H\u2013R diagram. Label the axes. Show where cool supergiants, white dwarfs, the Sun, and main-\nsequence stars are found.\n7. Describe what a typical star in the Galaxy would be like compared to the Sun.\n8. How do we distinguish stars from brown dwarfs? How do we distinguish brown dwarfs from planets?\n9. Describe how the mass, luminosity, surface temperature, and radius of main-sequence stars change in\nvalue going from the \u201cbottom\u201d to the \u201ctop\u201d of the main sequence.\n10. One method to measure the diameter of a star is to use an object like the Moon or a planet to block out its\nlight and to measure the time it takes to cover up the object. Why is this method used more often with the\nMoon rather than the planets, even though there are more planets?\n11. We discussed in the chapter that about half of stars come in pairs, or multiple star systems, yet the first\neclipsing binary was not discovered until the eighteenth century. Why?\nThought Questions\n12. Is the Sun an average star? Why or why not?\nAccess for free at openstax.org 18 \u2022 Exercises 613\n13. Suppose you want to determine the average educational level of people throughout the nation. Since it\nwould be a great deal of work to survey every citizen, you decide to make your task easier by asking only\nthe people on your campus. Will you get an accurate answer? Will your survey be distorted by a selection\neffect? Explain.\n14. Why do most known visual binaries have relatively long periods and most spectroscopic binaries have\nrelatively short periods?\n15. Figure 18.11shows the light curve of a hypothetical eclipsing binary star in which the light of one star is\ncompletely blocked by another. What would the light curve look like for a system in which the light of the\nsmaller star is only partially blocked by the larger one? Assume the smaller star is the hotter one.

Within 50 light-years of the Sun, visual binaries outnumber eclipsing binaries. Why?\n18. Which is easier to observe at large distances\u2014a spectroscopic binary or a visual binary?\n19. The eclipsing binary Algol drops from maximum to minimum brightness in about 4 hours, remains at\nminimum brightness for 20 minutes, and then takes another 4 hours to return to maximum brightness.\nAssume that we view this system exactly edge-on, so that one star crosses directly in front of the other. Is\none star much larger than the other, or are they fairly similar in size? (Hint: Refer to the diagrams of\neclipsing binary light curves.)\n20.

Suppose you want to search for brown dwarfs using a space telescope. Will you design your telescope to\ndetect light in the ultraviolet or the infrared part of the spectrum? Why?\n23. An astronomer discovers a type-M star with a large luminosity. How is this possible? What kind of star is\nit?\n24. Approximately 9000 stars are bright enough to be seen without a telescope. Are any of these white\ndwarfs? Use the information given in this chapter to explain your reasoning. 614 18 \u2022 Exercises\n25. Use the data inAppendix Jto plot an H\u2013R diagram for the brightest stars. Use the data fromTable 18.3to\nshow where the main sequence lies. Do 90% of the brightest stars lie on or near the main sequence?\nExplain why or why not.\n26. Use the diagram you have drawn forExercise 18.25to answer the following questions: Which star is more\nmassive\u2014Sirius or Alpha Centauri? Rigel and Regulus have nearly the same spectral type. Which is larger?\nRigel and Betelgeuse have nearly the same luminosity. Which is larger? Which is redder?\n27. Use the data inAppendix Ito plot an H\u2013R diagram for this sample of nearby stars. How does this plot\ndiffer from the one for the brightest stars inExercise 18.25? Why?\n28. If a visual binary system were to have two equal-mass stars, how would they be located relative to the\ncenter of the mass of the system? What would you observe as you watched these stars as they orbited the\ncenter of mass, assuming very circular orbits, and assuming the orbit was face on to your view?\n29. Two stars are in a visual binary star system that we see face on. One star is very massive whereas the\nother is much less massive. Assuming circular orbits, describe their relative orbits in terms of orbit size,\nperiod, and orbital velocity.\n30. Describe the spectra for a spectroscopic binary for a system comprised of an F-type and L-type star.\nAssume that the system is too far away to be able to easily observe the L-type star.\n31. Figure 18.7shows the velocity of two stars in a spectroscopic binary system. Which star is the most\nmassive? Explain your reasoning.\n32. You go out stargazing one night, and someone asks you how far away the brightest stars we see in the sky\nwithout a telescope are. What would be a good, general response? (UseAppendix Jfor more information.)\n33. If you were to compare three stars with the same surface temperature, with one star being a giant,\nanother a supergiant, and the third a main-sequence star, how would their radii compare to one another?\n34. Are supergiant stars also extremely massive? Explain the reasoning behind your answer.\n35. Consider the following data on four stars:\nTable B\nStar Luminosity (inL ) Type\nSun\n1 100 B, main sequence\n2 1/100 B, white dwarf\n3 1/100 M, main sequence\n4 100 M, giant\nWhich star would have the largest radius?

If two stars are in a binary system with a combined mass of 5.5 solar masses and an orbital period of 12\nyears, what is the average distance between the two stars?\nAccess for free at openstax.org 18 \u2022 Exercises 615\n37. It is possible that stars as much as 200 times the Sun\u2019s mass or more exist. What is the luminosity of such\na star based upon the mass-luminosity relation?\n38. The lowest mass for a true star is 1/12 the mass of the Sun. What is the luminosity of such a star based\nupon the mass-luminosity relationship?\n39. Spectral types are an indicator of temperature. For the first 10 stars inAppendix J, the list of the brightest\nstars in our skies, estimate their temperatures from their spectral types. Use information in the figures\nand/or tables in this chapter and describe how you made the estimates.\n40. We can estimate the masses of most of the stars inAppendix Jfrom the mass-luminosity relationship in\nFigure 18.9. However, remember this relationship works only for main sequence stars. Determine which of\nthe first 10 stars inAppendix Jare main sequence stars. Use one of the figures in this chapter. Make a\ntable of stars\u2019 masses.\n41. InDiameters of Stars, the relative diameters of the two stars in the Sirius system were determined. Let\u2019s\nuse this value to explore other aspects of this system. This will be done through several steps, each in its\nown exercise. Assume the temperature of the Sun is 5800 K, and the temperature of Sirius A, the larger\nstar of the binary, is\n10,000 K. The luminosity of Sirius A can be found inAppendix J, and is given as about 23 times that of the\nSun. Using the values provided, calculate the radius of Sirius A relative to that of the Sun.\n42. Now calculate the radius of Sirius\u2019 white dwarf companion, Sirius B, to the Sun.\n43. How does this radius of Sirius B compare with that of Earth?\n44. From the previous calculations and the results fromDiameters of Stars, it is possible to calculate the\ndensity of Sirius B relative to the Sun. It is worth noting that the radius of the companion is very similar to\nthat of Earth, whereas the mass is very similar to the Sun\u2019s. How does the companion\u2019s density compare\nto that of the Sun? Recall that density = mass/volume, and the volume of a sphere = (4/3)\u03c0R3. How does\nthis density compare with that of water and other materials discussed in this text? Can you see why\nastronomers were so surprised and puzzled when they first determined the orbit of the companion to\nSirius?\n45. How much would you weigh if you were suddenly transported to the white dwarf Sirius B? You may use\nyour own weight (or if don\u2019t want to own up to what it is, assume you weigh 70 kg or 150 lb). In this case,\nassume that the companion to Sirius has a mass equal to that of the Sun and a radius equal to that of\nEarth. Remember Newton\u2019s law of gravity:\nand that your weight is proportional to the force that you feel. What kind of star should you travel to if you\nwant toloseweight (and not gain it)?\n46. The star Betelgeuse has a temperature of 3400 K and a luminosity of 13,200L . Calculate the radius of\nSun\nBetelgeuse relative to the Sun.\n47. Using the information provided inTable 18.1, what is the average stellar density in our part of the Galaxy?\nUse only the true stars (types O\u2013M) and assume a spherical distribution with radius of 26 light-years.\n48. Confirm that the angular diameter of the Sun of 1/2\u00b0 corresponds to a linear diameter of 1.39 million km.\nUse the average distance of the Sun and Earth to derive the answer. (Hint: This can be solved using a\ntrigonometric function.) 616 18 \u2022 Exercises\n49.

If a 100 solar mass star were to have a luminosity of 107times the Sun\u2019s luminosity, how would such a\nstar\u2019s density compare when it is on the main sequence as an O-type star, and when it is a cool supergiant\n(M-type)? Use values of temperature fromFigure 18.14orFigure 18.15and the relationship between\nluminosity, radius, and temperature as given inExercise 18.47.\n51.

What is the most distant object we can see? These are among the most\nfundamental questions astronomers can ask. But just as babies must crawl before they can take their first\nhalting steps, so too must we start with a more modest question: How far away are the stars? And even this\nquestion proves to be very hard to answer. After all, stars are mere points of light. Suppose you see a point of\nlight in the darkness when you are driving on a country road late at night. How can you tell whether it is a\nnearby firefly, an oncoming motorcycle some distance away, or the porchlight of a house much farther down\nthe road? It\u2019s not so easy, is it? Astronomers faced an even more difficult problem when they tried to estimate\nhow far away the stars are.\nIn this chapter, we begin with the fundamental definitions of distances on Earth and then extend our reach\noutward to the stars. We will also examine the newest satellites that are surveying the night sky and discuss\nthe special types of stars that can be used as trail markers to distant galaxies. 618 19 \u2022 Celestial Distances\n19.1 Fundamental Units of Distance\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nUnderstand the importance of defining a standard distance unit\nExplain how the meter was originally defined and how it has changed over time\nDiscuss how radar is used to measure distances to the other members of the solar system\nThe first measures of distances were based on human dimensions\u2014the inch as the distance between knuckles\non the finger, or the yard as the span from the extended index finger to the nose of the British king. Later, the\nrequirements of commerce led to some standardization of such units, but each nation tended to set up its own\ndefinitions. It was not until the middle of the eighteenth century that any real efforts were made to establish a\nuniform, international set of standards.\nThe Metric System\nOne of the enduring legacies of the era of the French emperor Napoleon is the establishment of themetric\nsystemof units, officially adopted in France in 1799 and now used in most countries around the world. The\nfundamental metric unit of length is themeter, originally defined as one ten-millionth of the distance along\nEarth\u2019s surface from the equator to the pole. French astronomers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries\nwere pioneers in determining the dimensions of Earth, so it was logical to use their information as the\nfoundation of the new system.\nPractical problems exist with a definition expressed in terms of the size of Earth, since anyone wishing to\ndetermine the distance from one place to another can hardly be expected to go out and re-measure the\nplanet. Therefore, an intermediate standard meter consisting of a bar of platinum-iridium metal was set up in\nParis. In 1889, by international agreement, this bar was defined to be exactly one meter in length, and precise\ncopies of the original meter bar were made to serve as standards for other nations.\nOther units of length are derived from themeter. Thus, 1 kilometer (km) equals 1000 meters, 1 centimeter\n(cm) equals 1/100 meter, and so on. Even the old British and American units, such as the inch and the mile, are\nnow defined in terms of the metric system.\nModern Redefinitions of the Meter\nIn 1960, the official definition of the meter was changed again. As a result of improved technology for\ngenerating spectral lines of precisely known wavelengths (see the chapter onRadiation and Spectra), the\nmeter was redefined to equal 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of a particular atomic transition in the element\nkrypton-86. The advantage of this redefinition is that anyone with a suitably equipped laboratory can\nreproduce a standard meter, without reference to any particular metal bar.\nIn 1983, the meter was defined once more, this time in terms of the velocity of light. Light in a vacuum can\ntravel a distance of one meter in 1/299,792,458 second. Today, therefore, light travel time provides our basic\nunit of length. Put another way, a distance ofone light-second(the amount of space light covers in one\nsecond) is defined to be 299,792,458 meters. That\u2019s almost 300 million meters that light covers in just one\nsecond; light really isveryfast! We could just as well use the light-second as the fundamental unit of length,\nbut for practical reasons (and to respect tradition), we have defined the meter as a small fraction of the light-\nsecond.\nDistance within the Solar System\nThe work of Copernicus and Kepler established therelativedistances of the planets\u2014that is, how far from the\nSun one planet is compared to another (seeObserving the Sky: The Birth of AstronomyandOrbits and\nGravity). But their work could not establish theabsolutedistances (in light-seconds or meters or other\nstandard units of length). This is like knowing the height of all the students in your class only as compared to\nAccess for free at openstax.org 19.1 \u2022 Fundamental Units of Distance 619\nthe height of your astronomy instructor, but not in inches or centimeters. Somebody\u2019s height has to be\nmeasured directly.\nSimilarly, to establish absolute distances, astronomers had to measure one distance in the solar system\ndirectly. Generally, the closer to us the object is, the easier such a measurement would be. Estimates of the\ndistance to Venus were made as Venus crossed the face of the Sun in 1761 and 1769, and an international\ncampaign was organized to estimate the distance to the asteroid Eros in the early 1930s, when its orbit\nbrought it close to Earth. More recently, Venus crossed (ortransited) the surface of the Sun in 2004 and 2012,\nand allowed us to make a modern distance estimate, although, as we will see below, by then it wasn\u2019t needed\n(Figure 19.2).\nLINK TO LEARNING\nIf you would like more information on just how the motion of Venus across the Sun helped us pin down\ndistances in the solar system, you can turn to anice explanation(https://openstax.org/l/30VenusandSun)\nby a NASA astronomer.\nFigure19.2Venus Transits the Sun, 2012.This striking \u201cpicture\u201d of Venus crossing the face of theSun(it\u2019s the black dot at about 2\no\u2019clock) is more than just an impressive image. Taken with the Solar Dynamics Observatory spacecraft and special filters, it shows a\nmodern transit of Venus. Such events allowed astronomers in the 1800s to estimate the distance to Venus. They measured the time it\ntook Venus to cross the face of the Sun from different latitudes on Earth. The differences in times can be used to estimate the\ndistance to the planet. Today, radar is used for much more precise distance estimates. (credit: modification of work by NASA/SDO,\nAIA)\nThe key to our modern determination of solar system dimensions isradar, a type of radio wave that can\nbounce off solid objects (Figure 19.3). As discussed in several earlier chapters, by timing how long a radar\nbeam (traveling at the speed of light) takes to reach another world and return, we can measure the distance\ninvolved very accurately. In 1961, radar signals were bounced off Venus for the first time, providing a direct\nmeasurement of the distance from Earth to Venus in terms of light-seconds (from the roundtrip travel time of\nthe radar signal).\nSubsequently, radar has been used to determine the distances to Mercury, Mars, the satellites of Jupiter, the\nrings of Saturn, and several asteroids. Note, by the way, that it is not possible to use radar to measure the\ndistance to the Sun directly because the Sun does not reflect radar very efficiently. But we can measure the 620 19 \u2022 Celestial Distances\ndistance to many other solar system objects and use Kepler\u2019s laws to give us the distance to the Sun.\nFigure19.3Radar Telescope.This dish-shaped antenna, part of the NASA Deep Space Network in California\u2019s Mojave Desert, is 70\nmeters wide. Nicknamed the \u201cMars antenna,\u201d this radar telescope can send and receive radar waves, and thus measure the\ndistances to planets, satellites, and asteroids. (credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)\nFrom the various (related) solar system distances, astronomers selected the average distance from Earth to\nthe Sun as our standard \u201cmeasuring stick\u201d within the solar system. When Earth and the Sun are closest, they\nare about 147.1 million kilometers apart; when Earth and the Sun are farthest, they are about 152.1 million\nkilometers apart. The average of these two distances is called theastronomical unit(AU). We then express all\nthe other distances in the solar system in terms of the AU. Years of painstaking analyses of radar\nmeasurements have led to a determination of the length of the AU to a precision of about one part in a billion.\nThe length of 1 AU can be expressed in light travel time as 499.004854 light-seconds, or about 8.3 light-\nminutes. If we use the definition of the meter given previously, this is equivalent to 1 AU = 149,597,870,700\nmeters.\nThese distances are, of course, given here to a much higher level of precision than is normally needed. In this\ntext, we are usually content to express numbers to a couple of significant places and leave it at that. For our\npurposes, it will be sufficient to round off these numbers:\nWe now know the absolute distance scale within our own solar system with fantastic accuracy. This is the first\nlink in the chain of cosmic distances.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe distances between the celestial bodies in our solar system are sometimes difficult to grasp or put into\nperspective. Thisinteractive website(https://openstax.org/l/30DistanceScale)provides a \u201cmap\u201d that shows\nthe distances by using a scale at the bottom of the screen and allows you to scroll (using your arrow keys)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 19.2 \u2022 Surveying the Stars 621\nthrough screens of \u201cempty space\u201d to get to the next planet\u2014all while your current distance from the Sun is\nvisible on the scale.\n19.2 Surveying the Stars\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nUnderstand the concept of triangulating distances to distant objects, including stars\nExplain why space-based satellites deliver more precise distances than ground-based methods\nDiscuss astronomers\u2019 efforts to determine the distance of the stars closest to the Sun\nIt is an enormous step to go from the planets to the stars. For example, our Voyager 1 probe, which was\nlaunched in 1977, has now traveled farther from Earth than any other spacecraft. As of 2021, Voyager 1 is 152\n1\nAU from the Sun. The nearest star, however, is hundreds of thousands of AU from Earth. Even so, we can, in\nprinciple, survey distances to the stars using the same technique that a civil engineer employs to survey the\ndistance to an inaccessible mountain or tree\u2014the method oftriangulation.\nTriangulation in Space\nA practical example of triangulation is your own depth perception. As you are pleased to discover every\nmorning when you look in the mirror, your two eyes are located some distance apart. You therefore view the\nworld from two different vantage points, and it is this dual perspective that allows you to get a general sense\nof how far away objects are.\nTo see what we mean, take a pen and hold it a few inches in front of your face. Look at it first with one eye\n(closing the other) and then switch eyes. Note how the pen seems to shift relative to objects across the room.\nNow hold the pen at arm\u2019s length: the shift is less. If you play with moving the pen for a while, you will notice\nthat the farther away you hold it, the less it seems to shift. Your brain automatically performs such\ncomparisons and gives you a pretty good sense of how far away things in your immediate neighborhood are.\nIf your arms were made of rubber, you could stretch the pen far enough away from your eyes that the shift\nwould become imperceptible. This is because our depth perception fails for objects more than a few tens of\nmeters away. In order to see the shift of an object a city block or more from you, your eyes would need to be\nspread apart a lot farther.\nLet\u2019s see how surveyors take advantage of the same idea. Suppose you are trying to measure the distance to a\ntree across a deep river (Figure 19.4). You set up two observing stations some distance apart. That distance\n(line AB inFigure 19.4) is called thebaseline. Now the direction to the tree (C in the figure) in relation to the\nbaseline is observed from each station. Note that C appears in different directions from the two stations. This\napparent change in direction of the remote object due to a change in vantage point of the observer is called\nparallax.\n1 To have some basis for comparison, the dwarf planet Pluto orbits at an average distance of 40 AU from the Sun, and the dwarf\nplanet Eris is currently roughly 96 AU from the Sun. 622 19 \u2022 Celestial Distances\nFigure19.4Triangulation.Triangulation allows us to measure distances to inaccessible objects. By getting the angle to a tree from\ntwo different vantage points, we can calculate the properties of the triangle they make and thus the distance to the tree.\nThe parallax is also the angle that lines AC and BC make\u2014in mathematical terms, the angle subtended by the\nbaseline. A knowledge of the angles at A and B and the length of the baseline, AB, allows the triangle ABC to\nbe solved for any of its dimensions\u2014say, the distance AC or BC. The solution could be reached by constructing\na scale drawing or by using trigonometry to make a numerical calculation. If the tree were farther away, the\nwhole triangle would be longer and skinnier, and the parallax angle would be smaller. Thus, we have the\ngeneral rule that the smaller the parallax, the more distant the object we are measuring must be.\nIn practice, the kinds of baselines surveyors use for measuring distances on Earth are completely useless when\nwe try to gauge distances in space. The farther away an astronomical object lies, the longer the baseline has to\nbe to give us a reasonable chance of making a measurement. Unfortunately, nearly all astronomical objects\nare very far away. To measure their distances requires a very large baseline and highly precise angular\nmeasurements. TheMoonis the only object near enough that its distance can be found fairly accurately with\nmeasurements made without a telescope. Ptolemy determined the distance to the Moon correctly to within a\nfew percent. He used the turning Earth itself as a baseline, measuring the position of the Moon relative to the\nstars at two different times of night.\nWith the aid of telescopes, later astronomers were able to measure the distances to the nearer planets and\nasteroids using Earth\u2019s diameter as a baseline. This is how the AU was first established. To reach for the stars,\nhowever, requires a much longer baseline for triangulation and extremely sensitive measurements. Such a\nbaseline is provided by Earth\u2019s annual trip around the Sun.\nDistances to Stars\nAs Earth travels from one side of its orbit to the other, it graciously provides us with a baseline of 2 AU, or\nabout 300 million kilometers. Although this is a much bigger baseline than the diameter of Earth, the stars are\nso far awaythat the resulting parallax shift isstillnot visible to the naked eye\u2014not even for the closest stars.\nIn the chapter onObserving the Sky: The Birth of Astronomy, we discussed how this dilemma perplexed the\nancient Greeks, some of whom had actually suggested that the Sun might be the center of the solar system,\nwith Earth in motion around it. Aristotle and others argued, however, that Earth could not be revolving about\nthe Sun. If it were, they said, we would surely observe the parallax of the nearer stars against the background\nof more distant objects as we viewed the sky from different parts of Earth\u2019s orbit (Figure 19.6). Tycho Brahe\n(1546\u20131601) advanced the same faulty argument nearly 2000 years later, when his careful measurements of\nAccess for free at openstax.org 19.2 \u2022 Surveying the Stars 623\nstellar positions with the unaided eye revealed no such shift.\nThese early observers did not realize how truly distant the stars were and how small the change in their\npositions therefore was, even with the entire orbit of Earth as a baseline. The problem was that they did not\nhave tools to measure parallax shifts too small to be seen with the human eye. By the eighteenth century,\nwhen there was no longer serious doubt about Earth\u2019s revolution, it became clear that the stars must be\nextremely distant. Astronomers equipped with telescopes began to devise instruments capable of measuring\nthe tiny shifts of nearby stars relative to the background of more distant (and thus unshifting) celestial objects.\nThis was a significant technical challenge, since, even for the nearest stars, parallax angles are usually only a\nfraction of a second of arc. Recall that one second of arc (arcsec) is an angle of only 1/3600 of a degree. A coin\nthe size of a US quarter would appear to have a diameter of 1 arcsecond if you were viewing it from a distance\nof about 5 kilometers (3 miles). Think about how small an angle that is. No wonder it took astronomers a long\ntime before they could measure such tiny shifts.\nThe first successful detections of stellar parallax were in the year 1838, when FriedrichBesselin Germany\n(Figure 19.5), ThomasHenderson, a Scottish astronomer working at the Cape of Good Hope, and Friedrich\nStruvein Russia independently measured the parallaxes of the stars 61 Cygni,Alpha Centauri, andVega,\nrespectively. Even the closest star, Alpha Centauri, showed a total displacement of only about 1.5 arcseconds\nduring the course of a year.\nFigure19.5Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel (1784\u20131846), Thomas J. Henderson (1798\u20131844), and Friedrich Struve (1793\u20131864).(a)\nBessel made the first authenticated measurement of the distance to a star (61 Cygni) in 1838, a feat that had eluded many dedicated\nastronomers for almost a century. But two others, (b) Scottish astronomer Thomas J. Henderson and (c) Friedrich Struve, in Russia,\nwere close on his heels.\nFigure 19.6shows how such measurements work. Seen from opposite sides of Earth\u2019s orbit, a nearby star\nshifts position when compared to a pattern of more distant stars. Astronomers actually define parallax to be\none-halfthe angle that a star shifts when seen from opposite sides of Earth\u2019s orbit (the angle labeledPin\nFigure 19.6). The reason for this definition is just that they prefer to deal with a baseline of 1 AU instead of 2\nAU. 624 19 \u2022 Celestial Distances\nFigure19.6Parallax.As Earth revolves around the Sun, the direction in which we see a nearby star varies with respect to distant\nstars. We define theparallaxof the nearby star to be one half of the total change in direction, and we usually measure it in\narcseconds.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nUse theAstronomical Parallax model(https://openstax.org/l/30parallaxmod)to explore how the Earth\u2019s\nmotion around the Sun causes nearby stars to appear to \u201cwobble\u201d back and forth compared to background\nstars. Click on the Orbit box, and use the view along the bottom to see the apparent motion of the nearby\nobject.\nUnits of Stellar Distance\nWith a baseline of one AU, how far away would a star have to be to have a parallax of 1 arcsecond? The answer\nturns out to be 206,265 AU, or 3.26 light-years. This is equal to 3.1 \u00d7 1013kilometers (in other words, 31 trillion\nkilometers). We give this unit a special name, theparsec(pc)\u2014derived from \u201cthe distance at which we have a\nparallax of onesecond.\u201d The distance (D) of a star in parsecs is just the reciprocal of its parallax (p) in\narcseconds; that is,\nThus, a star with a parallax of 0.1 arcsecond would be found at a distance of 10 parsecs, and one with a\nparallax of 0.05 arcsecond would be 20 parsecs away.\nBack in the days when most of our distances came from parallax measurements, a parsec was a useful unit of\ndistance, but it is not as intuitive as the light-year. One advantage of the light-year as a unit is that it\nemphasizes the fact that, as we look out into space, we are also looking back into time. The light that we see\nfrom a star 100 light-years away left that star 100 years ago. What we study is not the star as it is now, but\nrather as it was in the past. The light that reaches our telescopes today from distant galaxies left them before\nEarth even existed.\nIn this text, we will use light-years as our unit of distance, but many astronomers still use parsecs when they\nAccess for free at openstax.org 19.2 \u2022 Surveying the Stars 625\nwrite technical papers or talk with each other at meetings. To convert between the two distance units, just\nbear in mind: 1 parsec = 3.26 light-year, and 1 light-year = 0.31 parsec.\nEXAMPLE 19.1\nHow Far Is a Light-Year?\nAlight-yearis the distance light travels in 1 year. Given that light travels at a speed of 300,000 km/s, how\nmany kilometers are there in a light-year?\nSolution\nWe learned earlier that speed = distance/time. We can rearrange this equation so that distance = velocity \u00d7\ntime. Now, we need to determine the number of seconds in a year.\nThere are approximately 365 days in 1 year. To determine the number of seconds, we must estimate the\nnumber of seconds in 1 day.\nWe can change units as follows (notice how the units of time cancel out):\nNext, to get the number of seconds per year:\nNow we can multiply the speed of light by the number of seconds per year to get the distance traveled by\nlight in 1 year:\nThat\u2019s almost 10,000,000,000,000 km that light covers in a year. To help you imagine how long this distance\nis, we\u2019ll mention that a string 1 light-year long could fit around the circumference of Earth 236 million times.\nCheck Your Learning\nThe number above is really large. What happens if we put it in terms that might be a little more\nunderstandable, like the diameter of Earth? Earth\u2019s diameter is about 12,700 km.\nAnswer:\nThat means that 1 light-year is about 745 million times the diameter of Earth.\nASTRONOMY BASICS\nNaming Stars\nYou may be wondering why stars have such a confusing assortment of names. Just look at the first three\nstars to have their parallaxes measured: 61 Cygni,Alpha Centauri, andVega. Each of these names comes\nfrom a different tradition of designating stars. 626 19 \u2022 Celestial Distances\nThe brightest stars have names that derive from the ancients. Some are from the Greek, such asSirius,\nwhich means \u201cthe scorched one\u201d\u2014a reference to its brilliance. A few are from Latin, but many of the best-\nknown names are from Arabic because, as discussed inObserving the Sky: The Birth of Astronomy, much of\nGreek and Roman astronomy was \u201crediscovered\u201d in Europe after the Dark Ages by means of Arabic\ntranslations. Vega, for example, means \u201cswooping Eagle,\u201d andBetelgeuse(pronounced \u201cBeetle-juice\u201d)\nmeans \u201cright hand of the central one.\u201d\nIn 1603, German astronomer JohannBayer(1572\u20131625) introduced a more systematic approach to naming\nstars. For each constellation, he assigned a Greek letter to the brightest stars, roughly in order of\nbrightness. In the constellation of Orion, for example, Betelgeuse is the brightest star, so it got the first\nletter in the Greek alphabet\u2014alpha\u2014and is known as Alpha Orionis. (\u201cOrionis\u201d is the possessive form of\nOrion, so Alpha Orionis means \u201cthe first of Orion.\u201d) A star called Rigel, being the second brightest in that\nconstellation, is called Beta Orionis (Figure 19.7). Since there are 24 letters in the Greek alphabet, this\nsystem allows the labeling of 24 stars in each constellation, but constellations have many more stars than\nthat.\nFigure19.7Objects in Orion.(a) This image shows the brightest objects in or near the star pattern of Orion, the hunter (of\nGreek mythology), in the constellation of Orion. (b) Note the Greek letters of Bayer\u2019s system in this diagram of the Orion\nconstellation. The objects denoted M42, M43, and M78 are not stars but nebulae\u2014clouds of gas and dust; these numbers come\nfrom a list of \u201cfuzzy objects\u201d made by Charles Messier in 1781. (credit a: modification of work by Matthew Spinelli; credit b:\nmodification of work by ESO, IAU andSky & Telescope)\nIn 1725, the English Astronomer Royal JohnFlamsteedintroduced yet another system, in which the brighter\nstars eventually got a number in each constellation in order of their location in the sky or, more precisely,\ntheir right ascension. (The system of sky coordinates that includes right ascension was discussed inEarth,\nMoon, and Sky.) In this system,Betelgeuseis called 58 Orionis and 61 Cygni is the 61st star in the\nconstellation of Cygnus, the swan.\nIt gets worse. As astronomers began to understand more and more about stars, they drew up a series of\nspecialized star catalogs, and fans of those catalogs began calling stars by their catalog numbers. If you\nlook atAppendix I\u2014our list of the nearest stars (many of which are much too faint to get an ancient name,\nAccess for free at openstax.org 19.2 \u2022 Surveying the Stars 627\nBayer letter, orFlamsteed number)\u2014you will see references to some of these catalogs. An example is a set\nof stars labeled with a BD number, for \u201cBonner Durchmusterung.\u201d This was a mammoth catalog of over\n324,000 stars in a series of zones in the sky, organized at the Bonn Observatory in the 1850s and 1860s.\nKeep in mind that this catalog was made before photography or computers came into use, so the position\nof each star had to be measured (at least twice) by eye, a daunting undertaking.\nThere is also a completely different system for keeping track of stars whose luminosity varies, and another\nfor stars that brighten explosively at unpredictable times. Astronomers have gotten used to the many\ndifferent star-naming systems, but students often find them bewildering and wish astronomers would\nsettle on one. Don\u2019t hold your breath: in astronomy, as in many fields of human thought, tradition holds a\npowerful attraction. Still, with high-speed computer databases to aid human memory, names may become\nless and less necessary. Today\u2019s astronomers often refer to stars by their precise locations in the sky rather\nthan by their names or various catalog numbers.\nThe Nearest Stars\nNo known star (other than the Sun) is within 1 light-year or even 1 parsec of Earth. The stellar neighbors\nnearest the Sun are three stars in the constellation of Centaurus. To the unaided eye, the brightest of these\nthree stars isAlpha Centauri, which is only 30\u25cbfrom the south celestial pole and hence not visible from the\nmainland United States. Alpha Centauri itself is a binary star\u2014two stars in mutual revolution\u2014too close\ntogether to be distinguished without a telescope. These two stars are 4.4 light-years from us. Nearby is a third\nfaint star, known asProxima Centauri. Proxima, with a distance of 4.3 light-years, is slightly closer to us than\nthe other two stars. If Proxima Centauri is part of a triple star system with the binary Alpha Centauri, as seems\nlikely, then its orbital period may be longer than 500,000 years.\nProxima Centauri is an example of the most common type of star, and our most common type of stellar\nneighbor (as we saw in Stars: A Celestial Census.) Low-mass red M dwarfs make up about 70% of all stars and\ndominate the census of stars within 10 parsecs (33 light-years) of the Sun. For example, a recent survey of the\nsolar neighborhood counted 357 stars and brown dwarfs within 10 parsecs, and 248 of these are red dwarfs.\nYet, if you wanted to see an M dwarf with your naked eye, you would be out of luck. These stars only produce a\nfraction of the Sun\u2019s light, and nearly all of them require a telescope to be detected.\nThe nearest star visible without a telescope from most of the United States is the brightest appearing of all the\nstars,Sirius, which has a distance of a little more than 8 light-years. It too is a binary system, composed of a\nfaint white dwarf orbiting a bluish-white, main-sequence star. It is an interesting coincidence of numbers that\nlight reaches us from the Sun in about 8 minutes and from the next brightest star in the sky in about 8 years.\nEXAMPLE 19.2\nCalculating the Diameter of the Sun\nFor nearby stars, we can measure the apparent shift in their positions as Earth orbits the Sun. We wrote\nearlier that an object must be 206,265 AU distant to have a parallax of one second of arc. This must seem\nlike a very strange number, but you can figure out why this is the right value. We will start by estimating the\ndiameter of the Sun and then apply the same idea to a star with a parallax of 1 arcsecond. Make a sketch\nthat has a round circle to represent the Sun, place Earth some distance away, and put an observer on it.\nDraw two lines from the point where the observer is standing, one to each side of the Sun. Sketch a circle\ncentered at Earth with its circumference passing through the center of the Sun. Now think about\nproportions. The Sun spans about half a degree on the sky. A full circle has 360\u25cb. The circumference of the\ncircle centered on Earth and passing through the Sun is given by: 628 19 \u2022 Celestial Distances\nThen, the following two ratios are equal:\nCalculate the diameter of the Sun. How does your answer compare to the actual diameter?\nSolution\nTo solve for the diameter of the Sun, we can evaluate the expression above.\nThis is very close to the true value of about 848,000 miles.\nCheck Your Learning\nNow apply this idea to calculating the distance to a star that has a parallax of 1 arcsec. Draw a picture\nsimilar to the one we suggested above and calculate the distance in AU. (Hint: Remember that the parallax\nangle is defined by 1 AU, not 2 AU, and that 3600 arcseconds = 1 degree.)\nAnswer:\n206,265 AU\nMeasuring Parallaxes in Space\nThe measurements of stellar parallax were revolutionized by the launch of the spacecraft Hipparcos in 1989,\nwhich measured distances for thousands of stars out to about 300 light-years with an accuracy of 10 to 20%\n(seeFigure 19.8and the feature onParallax and Space Astronomy). However, even 300 light-years are less\nthan 1% the size of our Galaxy\u2019s main disk.\nIn December 2013, the successor to Hipparcos, namedGaia, was launched by the European Space Agency.\nGaiais measuring the position and distances to almost one billion stars with an accuracy of a few millionths of\nan arcsecond.Gaia\u2019sdistance limit extends well beyond Hipparcos, studying stars out to 30,000 light-years\n(100 times farther than Hipparcos, covering nearly 1/3 of the galactic disk).Gaiais also able to measure proper\n2\nmotions for thousands of stars in the halo of the Milky Way\u2014something that can only be done for the\nbrightest stars right now. At the end ofGaia\u2019smission, we will not only have a three-dimensional map of a\nlarge fraction of our ownMilky Way Galaxy, but we will also have a strong link in the chain of cosmic distances\nthat we are discussing in this chapter. Yet, to extend this chain beyondGaia\u2019sreach and explore distances to\nnearby galaxies, we need some completely new techniques.\n2 Proper motion (as discussed inAnalyzing Starlight,is the motion of a star across the sky (perpendicular to our line of sight.)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 19.2 \u2022 Surveying the Stars 629\nFigure19.8H\u2013R Diagram of Stars Measured byGaiaand Hipparcos.This plot includes 16,631 stars for which the parallaxes have\nan accuracy of 10% or better. The colors indicate the numbers of stars at each point of the diagram, with red corresponding to the\nlargest number and blue to the lowest. Luminosity is plotted along the vertical axis, with luminosity increasing upward. An infrared\ncolor is plotted as a proxy for temperature, with temperature decreasing to the right. Most of the data points are distributed along\nthe diagonal running from the top left corner (high luminosity, high temperature) to the bottom right (low temperature, low\nluminosity). These are main sequence stars. The large clump of data points above the main sequence on the right side of the\ndiagram is composed of red giant stars. (credit: modification of work by the European Space Agency)\nMAKING CONNECTIONS\nParallax and Space Astronomy\nOne of the most difficult things about precisely measuring the tiny angles ofparallaxshifts from Earth is\nthat you have to observe the stars through our planet\u2019s atmosphere. As we saw inAstronomical\nInstruments, the effect of the atmosphere is to spread out the points of starlight into fuzzy disks, making\nexact measurements of their positions more difficult. Astronomers had long dreamed of being able to\nmeasure parallaxes from space, and two orbiting observatories have now turned this dream into reality.\nThe name of the Hipparcos satellite, launched in 1989 by the European Space Agency, is both an\nabbreviation for High Precision Parallax Collecting Satellite and a tribute to Hipparchus, the pioneering\nGreek astronomer whose work we discussed in theObserving the Sky: The Birth of Astronomy. The satellite\nwas designed to make the most accurate parallax measurements in history, from 36,000 kilometers above\nEarth. However, its onboard rocket motor failed to fire, which meant it did not get the needed boost to\nreach the desired altitude. Hipparcos ended up spending its 4-year life in an elliptical orbit that varied from 630 19 \u2022 Celestial Distances\n500 to 36,000 kilometers high. In this orbit, the satellite plunged into Earth\u2019s radiation belts every 5 hours or\nso, which finally took its toll on the solar panels that provided energy to power the instruments.\nNevertheless, the mission was successful, resulting in two catalogs. One gives positions of 120,000 stars to\nan accuracy of one-thousandth of an arcsecond\u2014about the diameter of a golf ball in New York as viewed\nfrom Europe. The second catalog contains information for more than a million stars, whose positions have\nbeen measured to thirty-thousandths of an arcsecond. We now have accurate parallax measurements of\nstars out to distances of about 300 light-years. (With ground-based telescopes, accurate measurements\nwere feasible out to only about 60 light-years.)\nIn order to build on the success of Hipparcos, in 2013, the European Space Agency launched a new satellite\ncalledGaia. BecauseGaiacarries larger telescopes than Hipparcos, it can observe fainter stars and measure\ntheir positions 200 times more accurately. The main goal of the Gaia mission is to make an accurate three-\ndimensional map of that portion of the Galaxy within about 30,000 light-years by observing 1 billion stars 70\ntimes each, measuring their positions and hence their parallaxes as well as their brightnesses.\nFor a long time, the measurement of parallaxes and accurate stellar positions was a backwater of\nastronomical research\u2014mainly because the accuracy of measurements did not improve much for about\n100 years. However, the ability to make measurements from space has revolutionized this field of\nastronomy and will continue to provide a critical link in our chain of cosmic distances.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nThe European Space Agency (ESA) maintains aGaia mission website(https://openstax.org/l/30GaiaMission)\nwhere you can learn more about the Gaia mission and to get the latest news onGaiaobservations.\nTo learn more about Hipparcos, explore thisEuropean Space Agency webpage(https://openstax.org/l/\n30Hipparcos)with an ESA vodcastCharting the Galaxy\u2014from Hipparcos to Gaia.\n19.3 Variable Stars: One Key to Cosmic Distances\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe how some stars vary their light output and why such stars are important\nExplain the importance of pulsating variable stars, such as cepheids and RR Lyrae-type stars, to our study\nof the universe\nLet\u2019s briefly review the key reasons that measuring distances to the stars is such a struggle. As discussed in\nThe Brightness of Stars, our problem is that stars come in a bewildering variety of intrinsic luminosities. (If\nstars were light bulbs, we\u2019d say they come in a wide range of wattages.) Suppose, instead, that all stars had\nthe same \u201cwattage\u201d or luminosity. In that case, the more distant ones would always look dimmer, and we\ncould tell how far away a star is simply by how dim it appeared. In the real universe, however, when we look at\na star in our sky (with eye or telescope) and measure its apparent brightness, we cannot know whether it looks\ndim because it\u2019s a low-wattage bulb or because it is far away, or perhaps some of each.\nAstronomers need to discover something else about the star that allows us to \u201cread off\u201d its intrinsic\nluminosity\u2014in effect, to know what the star\u2019s true wattage is. With this information, we can then attribute how\ndim it looks from Earth to its distance. Recall that the apparent brightness of an object decreases with the\nsquare of the distance to that object. If two objects have the same luminosity but one is three times farther\nAccess for free at openstax.org 19.3 \u2022 Variable Stars: One Key to Cosmic Distances 631\nthan the other, the more distant one will look nine times fainter. Therefore, if we know the luminosity of a star\nand its apparent brightness, we can calculate how far away it is. Astronomers have long searched for\ntechniques that would somehow allow us to determine the luminosity of a star\u2014and it is to these techniques\nthat we turn next.\nVariable Stars\nThe breakthrough in measuring distances to remote parts of our Galaxy, and to other galaxies as well, came\nfrom the study ofvariable stars. Most stars are constant in their luminosity, at least to within a percent or two.\nLike the Sun, they generate a steady flow of energy from their interiors. However, some stars are seen to vary\nin brightness and, for this reason, are calledvariable stars. Many such stars vary on a regular cycle, like the\nflashing bulbs that decorate stores and homes during the winter holidays.\nLet\u2019s define some tools to help us keep track of how a star varies. A graph that shows how the brightness of a\nvariable star changes with time is called alight curve(Figure 19.9). Themaximumis the point of the light\ncurve where the star has its greatest brightness; theminimumis the point where it is faintest. If the light\nvariations repeat themselves periodically, the interval between the two maxima is called theperiodof the star.\n(If this kind of graph looks familiar, it is because we introduced it inDiameters of Stars.)\nFigure19.9Cepheid Light Curve.This light curve shows how the brightness changes with time for a typical cepheid variable, with a\nperiod of about 6 days.\nPulsating Variables\nThere are two special types of variable stars for which\u2014as we will see\u2014measurements of the light curve give\nus accurate distances. These are calledcepheidandRR Lyraevariables, both of which arepulsating variable\nstars. Such a star actually changes its diameter with time\u2014periodically expanding and contracting, as your\nchest does when you breathe. We now understand that these stars are going through a brief unstable stage\nlate in their lives.\nThe expansion and contraction of pulsating variables can be measured by using the Doppler effect. The lines\nin the spectrum shift toward the blue as the surface of the star moves toward us and then shift to the red as\nthe surface shrinks back. As the star pulsates, it also changes its overall color, indicating that its temperature is\nalso varying. And, most important for our purposes, the luminosity of the pulsating variable also changes in a\nregular way as it expands and contracts.\nCepheid Variables\nCepheids are large, yellow, pulsating stars named for the first-known star of the group,Delta Cephei. This, by\nthe way, is another example of how confusing naming conventions get in astronomy; here, a whole class of\nstars is named after the constellation in which the first one happened to be found. (We textbook authors can\nonly apologize to our readers for the whole mess!)\nThe variability of Delta Cephei was discovered in 1784 by the young English astronomer John Goodricke (see\nJohn Goodricke). The star rises rather rapidly to maximum light and then falls more slowly to minimum light,\ntaking a total of 5.4 days for one cycle. The curve inFigure 19.9represents a simplified version of the light\ncurve of Delta Cephei. 632 19 \u2022 Celestial Distances\nSeveral hundred cepheid variables are known in our Galaxy. Most cepheids have periods in the range of 3 to\n50 days and luminosities that are about 1000 to 10,000 times greater than that of the Sun. Their variations in\nluminosity range from a few percent to a factor of 10.\nPolaris, the North Star, is a cepheid variable that, for a long time, varied by one tenth of a magnitude, or by\nabout 10% in visual luminosity, in a period of just under 4 days. Recent measurements indicate that the\namount by which the brightness of Polaris changes is decreasing and that, sometime in the future, this star\nwill no longer be a pulsating variable. This is just one more piece of evidence that stars really do evolve and\nchange in fundamental ways as they age, and that being a cepheid variable represents a stage in the life of the\nstar.\nThe Period-Luminosity Relation\nThe importance of cepheid variables lies in the fact that their periods and average luminosities turn out to be\ndirectly related. The longer the period (the longer the star takes to vary), the greater the luminosity. This\nperiod-luminosity relationwas a remarkable discovery, one for which astronomers still (pardon the\nexpression) thank their lucky stars. The period of such a star is easy to measure: a good telescope and a good\nclock are all you need. Once you have the period, the relationship (which can be put into precise mathematical\nterms) will give you the luminosity of the star.\nLet\u2019s be clear on what that means. The relation allows you to essentially \u201cread off\u201d how bright the star really is\n(how much energy it puts out). Astronomers can then compare this intrinsic brightness with the apparent\nbrightness of the star. As we saw, the difference between the two allows them to calculate the distance.\nThe relation between period and luminosity was discovered in 1908 by HenriettaLeavitt(Figure 19.10), a staff\nmember at the Harvard College Observatory (and one of a number of women working for low wages assisting\nEdward Pickering, the observatory\u2019s director; seeAnnie Cannon: Classifier of the Stars). Leavitt discovered\nhundreds of variable stars in theLarge Magellanic CloudandSmall Magellanic Cloud, two great star systems\nthat are actually neighboring galaxies (although they were not known to be galaxies then). A small fraction of\nthese variables were cepheids (Figure 19.11).\nFigure19.10Henrietta Swan Leavitt (1868\u20131921).Leavitt worked as an astronomer at the Harvard College Observatory. While\nstudying photographs of the Magellanic Clouds, she found over 1700 variable stars, including 20 cepheids. Since all the cepheids in\nthese systems were at roughly the same distance, she was able to compare their luminosities and periods of variation. She thus\ndiscovered a fundamental relationship between these characteristics that led to a new and much better way of estimating cosmic\ndistances. (credit: modification of work by AIP)\nThese systems presented a wonderful opportunity to study the behavior of variable stars independent of their\ndistance. For all practical purposes, the Magellanic Clouds are so far away that astronomers can assume that\nall the stars in them are at roughly the same distance from us. (In the same way, all the suburbs of Los Angeles\nare roughly the same distance from New York City. Of course, if you areinLos Angeles, you will notice\nannoying distances between the suburbs, but compared to how far away New York City is, the differences\nAccess for free at openstax.org 19.3 \u2022 Variable Stars: One Key to Cosmic Distances 633\nseem small.) If all the variable stars in the Magellanic Clouds are at roughly the same distance, then any\ndifference in their apparent brightnesses must be caused by differences in their intrinsic luminosities.\nFigure19.11Large Magellanic Cloud.TheLarge Magellanic Cloud(so named because Magellan\u2019s crew were the first Europeans to\nrecord it) is a small, irregularly shaped galaxy near our own Milky Way. It was in this galaxy that Henrietta Leavitt discovered the\ncepheid period-luminosity relation. (credit: ESO)\nLeavitt found that the brighter-appearing cepheids always have the longer periods of light variation. Thus, she\nreasoned, the period must be related to the luminosity of the stars. When Leavitt did this work, the distance to\nthe Magellanic Clouds was not known, so she was only able to show that luminosity was related to period. She\ncould not determine exactly what the relationship is.\nTo define theperiod-luminosity relationwith actual numbers (tocalibrateit), astronomers first had to measure\nthe actual distances to a few nearby cepheids in another way. (This was accomplished by finding cepheids\nassociated in clusters with other stars whose distances could be estimated from their spectra, as discussed in\nthe next section of this chapter.) But once the relation was thus defined, it could give us the distance to any\ncepheid, wherever it might be located (Figure 19.12). 634 19 \u2022 Celestial Distances\nFigure19.12How to Use a Cepheid to Measure Distance.(a) Find a cepheid variable star and measure its period. (b) Use the\nperiod-luminosity relation to calculate the star\u2019s luminosity. (c) Measure the star\u2019s apparent brightness. (d) Compare the luminosity\nwith the apparent brightness to calculate the distance.\nHere at last was the technique astronomers had been searching for to break the confines of distance that\nparallax imposed on them. Cepheids can be observed and monitored, it turns out, in many parts of our own\nGalaxy and in other nearby galaxies as well. Astronomers, including Ejnar Hertzsprung and Harvard\u2019s Harlow\nShapley, immediately saw the potential of the new technique; they and many others set to work exploring\nmore distant reaches of space using cepheids as signposts. In the 1920s, EdwinHubblemade one of the most\nsignificant astronomical discoveries of all time using cepheids, when he observed them in nearby galaxies and\ndiscovered the expansion of the universe. As we will see, this work still continues, as the Hubble Space\nTelescope and other modern instruments try to identify and measure individual cepheids in galaxies farther\nand farther away. The most distant known variable stars are all cepheids, with some about 60 million light-\nyears away.\nVOYAGERS IN ASTRONOMY\nJohn Goodricke\nThe brief life of JohnGoodricke(Figure 19.13) is a testament to the human spirit under adversity. Born deaf\nand unable to speak, Goodricke nevertheless made a number of pioneering discoveries in astronomy\nthrough patient and careful observations of the heavens.\nFigure19.13John Goodricke (1764\u20131786).This portrait of Goodricke by artist J. Scouler hangs in the Royal Astronomical Society\nAccess for free at openstax.org 19.3 \u2022 Variable Stars: One Key to Cosmic Distances 635\nin London. There is some controversy about whether this is actually what Goodricke looked like or whether the painting was\nmuch retouched to please his family. (credit: James Scouler)\nBorn in Holland, where his father was on a diplomatic mission, Goodricke was sent back to England at age\neight to study at a special school for the deaf. He did sufficiently well to enter Warrington Academy, a\nsecondary school that offered no special assistance for students with handicaps. His mathematics teacher\nthere inspired an interest in astronomy, and in 1781, at age 17, Goodricke began observing the sky at his\nfamily home in York, England. Within a year, he had discovered the brightness variations of the star Algol\n(discussed inThe Stars: A Celestial Census) and suggested that an unseen companion star was causing the\nchanges, a theory that waited over 100 years for proof. His paper on the subject was read before the Royal\nSociety (the main British group of scientists) in 1783 and won him a medal from that distinguished group.\nIn the meantime, Goodricke had discovered two other stars that varied regularly, Beta Lyrae andDelta\nCephei, both of which continued to interest astronomers for years to come. Goodricke shared his interest in\nobserving with his older cousin, Edward Pigott, who went on to discover other variable stars during his\nmuch longer life. But Goodricke\u2019s time was quickly drawing to a close; at age 21, only 2 weeks after he was\nelected to the Royal Society, he caught a cold while making astronomical observations and never recovered.\nToday, the University of York has a building named Goodricke Hall and a plaque that honors his\ncontributions to science. Yet if you go to the churchyard cemetery where he is buried, an overgrown\ntombstone has only the initials \u201cJ. G.\u201d to show where he lies. Astronomer Zdenek Kopal, who looked\ncarefully into Goodricke\u2019s life, speculated on why the marker is so modest: perhaps the rather staid\nGoodricke relatives were ashamed of having a \u201cdeaf-mute\u201d in the family and could not sufficiently\nappreciate how much a man who could not hear could nevertheless see.\nGo tohttps://www.bslzone.co.uk/watch/deaf-history/deaf-history-john-goodricke\n(https://www.bslzone.co.uk/watch/deaf-history/deaf-history-john-goodricke)to see a short video on the\nlife and work of John Goodricke, which is part of the \u201cDeaf History\u201d series and set up so both hearing and\nhearing-impaired viewers can enjoy it.\nRR Lyrae Stars\nA related group of stars, whose nature was understood somewhat later than that of the cepheids, are called\nRR Lyraevariables, named for the star RR Lyrae, the best-known member of the group. More common than\nthe cepheids, but less luminous, thousands of these pulsating variables are known in our Galaxy. The periods\nof RR Lyrae stars are always less than 1 day, and their changes in brightness are typically less than about a\nfactor of two.\nAstronomers have observed that the RR Lyrae stars occurring in any particular cluster all have about the same\napparent brightness. Since stars in a cluster are all at approximately the same distance, it follows that RR Lyrae\nvariables must all have nearly the same intrinsic luminosity, which turns out to be about 50L . In this sense,\nSun\nRR Lyrae stars are a little bit like standard light bulbs and can also be used to obtain distances, particularly\nwithin our Galaxy.Figure 19.14displays the ranges of periods and luminosities for both the cepheids and the\nRR Lyrae stars. 636 19 \u2022 Celestial Distances\nFigure19.14Period-Luminosity Relation for Cepheid Variables.In this class of variable stars, the time the star takes to go\nthrough a cycle of luminosity changes is related to the average luminosity of the star. Also shown are the period and luminosity for\nRR Lyrae stars.\n19.4 The H\u2013R Diagram and Cosmic Distances\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nUnderstand how spectral types are used to estimate stellar luminosities\nExamine how these techniques are used by astronomers today\nVariable stars are not the only way that we can estimate the luminosity of stars. Another way involves the H\u2013R\ndiagram, which shows that the intrinsic brightness of a star can be estimated if we know its spectral type.\nDistances from Spectral Types\nAs satisfying and productive as variable stars have been for distance measurement, these stars are rare and\nare not found near all the objects to which we wish to measure distances. Suppose, for example, we need the\ndistance to a star that is not varying, or to a group of stars, none of which is a variable. In this case, it turns out\ntheH\u2013R diagramcan come to our rescue.\nIf we can observe the spectrum of a star, we can estimate its distance from our understanding of the H\u2013R\ndiagram. As discussed inAnalyzing Starlight, a detailed examination of a stellar spectrum allows astronomers\nto classify the star into one of thespectral typesindicating surface temperature. (The types are O, B, A, F, G, K,\nM, L, T, and Y; each of these can be divided into numbered subgroups.) In general, however, the spectral type\nalone is not enough to allow us to estimate luminosity. Look again atFigure 18.15. A G2 star could be a main-\nsequence star with a luminosity of 1L , or it could be a giant with a luminosity of 100L , or even a\nSun Sun\nsupergiant with a still higher luminosity.\nWe can learn more from a star\u2019s spectrum, however, than just its temperature. Remember, for example, that\nwe can detect pressure differences in stars from the details of the spectrum. This knowledge is very useful\nbecause giant stars are larger (and have lower pressures) than main-sequence stars, and supergiants are still\nlarger than giants. If we look in detail at the spectrum of a star, we can determine whether it is a main-\nsequence star, a giant, or a supergiant.\nSuppose, to start with the simplest example, that the spectrum, color, and other properties of a distant G2 star\nmatch those of the Sun exactly. It is then reasonable to conclude that this distant star is likely to be a main-\nsequence star just like the Sun and to have the same luminosity as the Sun. But if there are subtle differences\nbetween the solar spectrum and the spectrum of the distant star, then the distant star may be a giant or even\na supergiant.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 19.4 \u2022 The H\u2013R Diagram and Cosmic Distances 637\nThe most widely used system of star classification divides stars of a given spectral class into six categories\ncalledluminosity classes. These luminosity classes are denoted by Roman numbers as follows:\n\u2022 Ia: Brightest supergiants\n\u2022 Ib: Less luminous supergiants\n\u2022 II: Bright giants\n\u2022 III: Giants\n\u2022 IV: Subgiants (intermediate between giants and main-sequence stars)\n\u2022 V: Main-sequence stars\nThe full spectral specification of a star includes its luminosity class. For example, a main-sequence star with\nspectral class F3 is written as F3 V. The specification for an M2 giant is M2 III.Figure 19.15illustrates the\napproximate position of stars of various luminosity classes on the H\u2013R diagram. The dashed portions of the\nlines represent regions with very few or no stars.\nFigure19.15Luminosity Classes.Stars of the same temperature (or spectral class) can fall into different luminosity classes on the\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram. By studying details of the spectrum for each star, astronomers can determine which luminosity class\nthey fall in (whether they are main-sequence stars, giant stars, or supergiant stars).\nWith both its spectral and luminosity classes known, a star\u2019s position on the H\u2013R diagram is uniquely\ndetermined. Since the diagram plots luminosity versus temperature, this means we can now read off the star\u2019s\nluminosity (once its spectrum has helped us place it on the diagram). As before, if we know how luminous the\nstar really is and see how dim it looks, the difference allows us to calculate its distance. (For historical reasons,\nastronomers sometimes call this method of distance determinationspectroscopic parallax, even though the\nmethod has nothing to do with parallax.)\nThe H\u2013R diagram method allows astronomers to estimate distances to nearby stars, as well as some of the\nmost distant stars in our Galaxy, but it is anchored by measurements of parallax. The distances measured\nusing parallax are the gold standard for distances: they rely on no assumptions, only geometry. Once\nastronomers take a spectrum of a nearby star for which we also know the parallax, we know the luminosity\nthat corresponds to that spectral type. Nearby stars thus serve as benchmarks for more distant stars because\nwe can assume that two stars with identical spectra have the same intrinsic luminosity.\nA Few Words about the Real World\nIntroductory textbooks such as ours work hard to present the material in a straightforward and simplified way. 638 19 \u2022 Celestial Distances\nIn doing so, we sometimes do our students a disservice by making scientific techniques seem too clean and\npainless. In the real world, the techniques we have just described turn out to be messy and difficult, and often\ngive astronomers headaches that last long into the day.\nFor example, the relationships we have described such as the period-luminosity relation for certain variable\nstars aren\u2019t exactly straight lines on a graph. The points representing many stars scatter widely when plotted,\nand thus, the distances derived from them also have a certain built-in scatter or uncertainty.\nThe distances we measure with the methods we have discussed are therefore only accurate to within a certain\npercentage of error\u2014sometimes 10%, sometimes 25%, sometimes as much as 50% or more. A 25% error for a\nstar estimated to be 10,000 light-years away means it could be anywhere from 7500 to 12,500 light-years away.\nThis would be an unacceptable uncertainty if you were loading fuel into a spaceship for a trip to the star, but it\nis not a bad first figure to work with if you are an astronomer stuck on planet Earth.\nNor is the construction of H\u2013R diagrams as easy as you might think at first. To make a good diagram, one\nneeds to measure the characteristics and distances of many stars, which can be a time-consuming task. Since\nour own solar neighborhood is already well mapped, the stars astronomers most want to study to advance our\nknowledge are likely to be far away and faint. It may take hours of observing to obtain a single spectrum.\nObservers may have to spend many nights at the telescope (and many days back home working with their\ndata) before they get their distance measurement. Fortunately, this is changing because surveys like Gaia will\nstudy billions of stars, producing public datasets that all astronomers can use.\nDespite these difficulties, the tools we have been discussing allow us to measure a remarkable range of\ndistances\u2014parallaxes for the nearest stars, RR Lyrae variable stars; the H\u2013R diagram for clusters of stars in our\nown and nearby galaxies; and cepheids out to distances of 60 million light-years.Table 19.1describes the\ndistance limits and overlap of each method.\nEach technique described in this chapter builds on at least one other method, forming what many call the\ncosmic distance ladder. Parallaxes are the foundation of all stellar distance estimates, spectroscopic methods\nuse nearby stars to calibrate their H\u2013R diagrams, and RR Lyrae and cepheid distance estimates are grounded\nin H\u2013R diagram distance estimates (and even in a parallax measurement to a nearby cepheid,Delta Cephei).\nThis chain of methods allows astronomers to push the limits when looking for even more distant stars. Recent\nwork, for example, has used RR Lyrae stars to identify dim companion galaxies to our own Milky Way out at\ndistances of 300,000 light-years. The H\u2013R diagram method was recently used to identify the two most distant\nstars in the Galaxy: red giant stars way out in the halo of the Milky Way with distances of almost 1 million light-\nyears.\nWe can combine the distances we find for stars with measurements of their composition, luminosity, and\ntemperature\u2014made with the techniques described inAnalyzing StarlightandThe Stars: A Celestial Census.\nTogether, these make up the arsenal of information we need to trace the evolution of stars from birth to\ndeath, the subject to which we turn in the chapters that follow.\nDistance Range of Celestial Measurement Methods\nMethod Distance Range\nTrigonometric parallax 4\u201330,000 light-years when the Gaia mission is complete\nRR Lyrae stars Out to 300,000 light-years\nH\u2013R diagram and spectroscopic distances Out to 1,200,000 light-years\nTable19.1\nAccess for free at openstax.org 19.4 \u2022 The H\u2013R Diagram and Cosmic Distances 639\nMethod Distance Range\nCepheid stars Out to 60,000,000 light-years\nTable19.1 640 19 \u2022 Key Terms\nKey Terms\ncepheid a star that belongs to a class of yellow supergiant pulsating stars; these stars vary periodically in\nbrightness, and the relationship between their periods and luminosities is useful in deriving distances to\nthem\nlight curve a graph that displays the time variation of the light from a variable or eclipsing binary star or,\nmore generally, from any other object whose radiation output changes with time\nluminosity class a classification of a star according to its luminosity within a given spectral class; our Sun, a\nG2V star, has luminosity class V, for example\nparallax an apparent displacement of a nearby star that results from the motion of Earth around the Sun\nparsec a unit of distance in astronomy, equal to 3.26 light-years; at a distance of 1 parsec, a star has a\nparallax of 1 arcsecond\nperiod-luminosity relation an empirical relation between the periods and luminosities of certain variable\nstars\npulsating variable star a variable star that pulsates in size and luminosity\nRR Lyrae one of a class of giant pulsating stars with periods shorter than 1 day, useful for finding distances\nSummary\n19.1Fundamental Units of Distance\nEarly measurements of length were based on human dimensions, but today, we use worldwide standards that\nspecify lengths in units such as the meter. Distances within the solar system are now determined by timing\nhow long it takes radar signals to travel from Earth to the surface of a planet or other body and then return.\n19.2Surveying the Stars\nFor stars that are relatively nearby, we can \u201ctriangulate\u201d the distances from a baseline created by Earth\u2019s\nannual motion around the Sun. Half the shift in a nearby star\u2019s position relative to very distant background\nstars, as viewed from opposite sides of Earth\u2019s orbit, is called the parallax of that star and is a measure of its\ndistance. The units used to measure stellar distance are the light-year, the distance light travels in 1 year, and\nthe parsec (pc), the distance of a star with a parallax of 1 arcsecond (1 parsec = 3.26 light-years). The closest\nstar, a red dwarf, is over 1 parsec away. The first successful measurements of stellar parallaxes were reported\nin 1838. Parallax measurements are a fundamental link in the chain of cosmic distances. The Hipparcos\nsatellite has allowed us to measure accurate parallaxes for stars out to about 300 light-years, and the Gaia\nmission will result in parallaxes out to 30,000 light-years.\n19.3Variable Stars: One Key to Cosmic Distances\nCepheids and RR Lyrae stars are two types of pulsating variable stars. Light curves of these stars show that\ntheir luminosities vary with a regularly repeating period. RR Lyrae stars can be used as standard bulbs, and\ncepheid variables obey a period-luminosity relation, so measuring their periods can tell us their luminosities.\nThen, we can calculate their distances by comparing their luminosities with their apparent brightnesses, and\nthis can allow us to measure distances to these stars out to over 60 million light-years.\n19.4The H\u2013R Diagram and Cosmic Distances\nStars with identical temperatures but different pressures (and diameters) have somewhat different spectra.\nSpectral classification can therefore be used to estimate the luminosity class of a star as well as its\ntemperature. As a result, a spectrum can allow us to pinpoint where the star is located on an H\u2013R diagram and\nestablish its luminosity. This, with the star\u2019s apparent brightness, again yields its distance. The various distance\nmethods can be used to check one against another and thus make a kind of distance ladder which allows us to\nfind even larger distances.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 19 \u2022 For Further Exploration 641\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nAdams, A. \u201cThe Triumph of Hipparcos.\u201dAstronomy(December 1997): 60.

In this chapter, we explain the various measurements that have been used to establish the size of a\nstandard meter. Your group should discuss why we have changed the definitions of our standard unit of\nmeasurement in science from time to time. What factors in our modern society contribute to the growth\nof technology? Does technology \u201cdrive\u201d science, or does science \u201cdrive\u201d technology? Or do you think the\ntwo are so intertwined that it\u2019s impossible to say which is the driver?\nB. Cepheids are scattered throughout our own Milky Way Galaxy, but the period-luminosity relation was\ndiscovered from observations of the Magellanic Clouds, a satellite galaxy now known to be about 160,000\nlight-years away. What reasons can you give to explain why the relation was not discovered from\nobservations of cepheids in our own Galaxy? Would your answer change if there were a small cluster in\nour own Galaxy that contained 20 cepheids? Why or why not?\nC. You want to write a proposal to use the Hubble Space Telescope to look for the brightest cepheids in\ngalaxy M100 and estimate their luminosities. What observations would you need to make? Make a list of\nall the reasons such observations are harder than it first might appear.\nD. Why does your group think so many different ways of naming stars developed through history? (Think\nback to the days before everyone connected online.) Are there other fields where things are named\nconfusingly and arbitrarily? How do stars differ from other phenomena that science and other professions\ntend to catalog?\nE. Although cepheids and RR Lyrae variable stars tend to change their brightness pretty regularly (while they\nare in that stage of their lives), some variable stars are unpredictable or change their behavior even\nduring the course of a single human lifetime. Amateur astronomers all over the world follow such variable\nstars patiently and persistently, sending their nightly observations to huge databases that are being kept\non the behavior of many thousands of stars. None of the hobbyists who do this get paid for making such\npainstaking observations. Have your group discuss why they do it. Would you ever consider a hobby that\ninvolves so much work, long into the night, often on work nights? If observing variable stars doesn\u2019t pique\nyour interest, is there something you think you could do as a volunteer after college that does excite you?\nWhy?\nF. InFigure 19.8, the highest concentration of stars occurs in the middle of the main sequence. Can your\ngroup give reasons why this might be so? Why are there fewer very hot stars and fewer very cool stars on\nthis diagram?\nG. In this chapter, we discuss two astronomers who were differently abled than their colleagues. John\nGoodricke could neither hear nor speak, and Henrietta Leavitt struggled with hearing impairment for all of\nher adult life. Yet they each made fundamental contributions to our understanding of the universe. Does\nyour group know people who are handling a disability? What obstacles would people with different\ndisabilities face in trying to do astronomy and what could be done to ease their way?

Suppose you have discovered a new cepheid variable star. What steps would you take to determine its\ndistance?\n3. Explain how you would use the spectrum of a star to estimate its distance.\n4. Which method would you use to obtain the distance to each of the following?\nA. An asteroid crossing Earth\u2019s orbit\nB.

A star that is not variable but for which you can obtain a clearly defined spectrum\n5. What are the luminosity class and spectral type of a star with an effective temperature of 5000 K and a\nluminosity of 100L ?\nSun\nThought Questions\n6. The meter was redefined as a reference to Earth, then to krypton, and finally to the speed of light. Why do\nyou think the reference point for a meter continued to change?\n7. While a meter is the fundamental unit of length, most distances traveled by humans are measured in miles\nor kilometers. Why do you think this is?\n8. Most distances in the Galaxy are measured in light-years instead of meters. Why do you think this is the\ncase?\n9. The AU is defined as theaveragedistance between Earth and the Sun, not the distance between Earth and\nthe Sun. Why does this need to be the case?\n10. What would be the advantage of making parallax measurements from Pluto rather than from Earth?\nWould there be a disadvantage?\n11. Parallaxes are measured in fractions of an arcsecond. One arcsecond equals 1/60 arcmin; an arcminute is,\nin turn, 1/60th of a degree (\u00b0). To get some idea of how big 1\u00b0 is, go outside at night and find the Big\nDipper. The two pointer stars at the ends of the bowl are 5.5\u00b0 apart. The two stars across the top of the\nbowl are 10\u00b0 apart. (Ten degrees is also about the width of your fist when held at arm\u2019s length and\nprojected against the sky.) Mizar, the second star from the end of the Big Dipper\u2019s handle, appears\ndouble. The fainter star, Alcor, is about 12 arcmin from Mizar. For comparison, the diameter of the full\nmoon is about 30 arcmin. The belt of Orion is about 3\u00b0 long. Keeping all this in mind, why did it take until\n1838 to make parallax measurements for even the nearest stars?\n12. For centuries, astronomers wondered whether comets were true celestial objects, like the planets and\nstars, or a phenomenon that occurred in the atmosphere of Earth. Describe an experiment to determine\nwhich of these two possibilities is correct.\n13. The Sun is much closer to Earth than are the nearest stars, yet it is not possible to measure accurately the\ndiurnal parallax of the Sun relative to the stars by measuring its position relative to background objects in\nthe sky directly. Explain why. 644 19 \u2022 Exercises\n14. Parallaxes of stars are sometimes measured relative to the positions of galaxies or distant objects called\nquasars. Why is this a good technique?\n15.

Why would it be easier to measure the characteristics of intrinsically less luminous cepheids than more\nluminous ones?\n25.

The best parallaxes obtained with Hipparcos have an accuracy of 0.001 arcsec.

We already know from earlier chapters that stars must die because ultimately they\nexhaust their nuclear fuel. We might hypothesize that new stars come into existence to replace the ones that\ndie. In order to form new stars, however, we need the raw material to make them. It also turns out that stars\neject mass throughout their lives (a kind of wind blows from their surface layers) and that material must go\nsomewhere. What does this \u201craw material\u201d of stars look like? How would you detect it, especially if it is not yet\nin the form of stars and cannot generate its own energy?\nOne of the most exciting discoveries of twentieth-century astronomy was that our Galaxy contains vast\nquantities of this \u201craw material\u201d\u2014atoms or molecules of gas and tiny solid dust particles found between the\nstars. Studying this diffuse matter between the stars helps us understand how new stars form and gives us\nimportant clues about our own origins billions of years ago. 648 20 \u2022 Between the Stars: Gas and Dust in Space\n20.1 The Interstellar Medium\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain how much interstellar matter there is in the Milky Way, and what its typical density is\nDescribe how the interstellar medium is divided into gaseous and solid components\nAstronomers refer to all the material between stars asinterstellarmatter; the entire collection of interstellar\nmatter is called theinterstellar medium (ISM). Some interstellar material is concentrated into giant clouds,\neach of which is known as anebula(plural \u201cnebulae,\u201d Latin for \u201cclouds\u201d). The best-known nebulae are the\nones that we can see glowing or reflecting visible light; there are many pictures of these in this chapter.\nInterstellar clouds do not last for the lifetime of the universe. Instead, they are like clouds on Earth, constantly\nshifting, merging with each other, growing, or dispersing. Some become dense and massive enough to\ncollapse under their own gravity, forming new stars. When stars die, they, in turn, eject some of their material\ninto interstellar space. This material can then form new clouds and begin the cycle over again.\nAbout 99% of the material between the stars is in the form of agas\u2014that is, it consists of individual atoms or\nmolecules. The most abundant elements in this gas are hydrogen and helium (which we saw are also the most\nabundant elements in the stars), but the gas also includes other elements. Some of the gas is in the form of\nmolecules\u2014combinations of atoms. The remaining 1% of the interstellar material is solid\u2014frozen particles\nconsisting of many atoms and molecules that are calledinterstellar grainsorinterstellar dust(Figure 20.2). A\ntypical dust grain consists of a core of rocklike material (silicates) or graphite surrounded by a mantle of ices;\nwater, methane, and ammonia are probably the most abundant ices.\nFigure20.2Various Types of Interstellar Matter.The reddish nebulae in this spectacular photograph glow with light emitted by\nhydrogen atoms. The darkest areas are clouds of dust that block the light from stars behind them. The upper part of the picture is\nfilled with the bluish glow of light reflected from hot stars embedded in the outskirts of a huge, cool cloud of dust and gas. The cool\nsupergiant star Antares can be seen as a big, reddish patch in the lower-left part of the picture. The star is shedding some of its outer\natmosphere and is surrounded by a cloud of its own making that reflects the red light of the star. The red nebula in the middle right\npartially surrounds the star Sigma Scorpii. (To the right of Antares, you can see M4, a much more distant cluster of extremely old\nAccess for free at openstax.org 20.1 \u2022 The Interstellar Medium 649\nstars.) (credit: modification of work by ESO/Digitized Sky Survey 2)\nIf all the interstellar gas within the Galaxy were spread out smoothly, there would be only about one atom of\ngas per cm3in interstellar space. (In contrast, the air in the room where you are reading this book has roughly\n1019atoms per cm3.) The dust grains are even scarcer. A km3of space would contain only a few hundred to a\nfew thousand tiny grains, each typically less than one ten-thousandth of a millimeter in diameter. These\nnumbers are just averages, however, because the gas and dust are distributed in a patchy and irregular way,\nmuch as water vapor in Earth\u2019s atmosphere is often concentrated into clouds.\nIn some interstellar clouds, the density of gas and dust may exceed the average by as much as a thousand\ntimes or more, but even this density is more nearly a vacuum than any we can make on Earth. To show what\nwe mean, let\u2019s imagine a vertical tube of air reaching from the ground to the top of Earth\u2019s atmosphere with a\ncross-section of 1 square meter. Now let us extend the same-size tube from the top of the atmosphere all the\nway to the edge of the observable universe\u2014over 10 billion light-years away. Long though it is, the second\ntube would still contain fewer atoms than the one in our planet\u2019s atmosphere.\nWhile thedensityof interstellar matter is very low, the volume of space in which such matter is found is huge,\nand so itstotalmassis substantial. To see why, we must bear in mind that stars occupy only a tiny fraction of\nthe volume of the Milky Way Galaxy. For example, it takes light only about four seconds to travel a distance\nequal to the diameter of the Sun, but more than fouryearsto travel from the Sun to the nearest star. Even\nthough the spaces among the stars are sparsely populated, there\u2019s a lot of space out there!\nAstronomers estimate that the total mass of gas and dust in theMilky Way Galaxyis equal to about 15% of the\nmass contained in stars. This means that the mass of the interstellar matter in our Galaxy amounts to about 10\nbillion times the mass of the Sun. There is plenty of raw material in the Galaxy to make generations of new\nstars and planets (and perhaps even astronomy students).\nEXAMPLE 20.1\nEstimating Interstellar Mass\nYou can make a rough estimate of how muchinterstellar massour Galaxy contains and also how many new\nstars could be made from this interstellar matter. All you need to know is how big the Galaxy is and the\naverage density using this formula:\nYou have to remember to use consistent units\u2014such as meters and kilograms. We will assume that our\nGalaxy is shaped like a cylinder; the volume of a cylinder equals the area of its base times its height\nwhereRis the radius of the cylinder andhis its height.\nSuppose that the average density of hydrogen gas in our Galaxy is one atom per cm3. Each hydrogen atom\nhas a mass of 1.7 \u00d7 10\u221227kg. If the Galaxy is a cylinder with a diameter of 100,000 light-years and a height of\n300 light-years, what is the mass of this gas? How many solar-mass stars (2.0 \u00d7 1030kg) could be produced\nfrom this mass of gas if it were all turned into stars?\nSolution\nIf the diameter of the Galaxy is 100,000 light-years, then the radius is 50,000 light-years. Recall that 1 light-\nyear = 9.5 \u00d7 1012km = 9.5 \u00d7 1017cm, so the volume of the Galaxy is\nThe total mass is therefore 650 20 \u2022 Between the Stars: Gas and Dust in Space\nThis is sufficient to make\nstars equal in mass to the Sun. That\u2019s roughly 2 billion stars.\nCheck Your Learning\nYou can use the same method to estimate the mass of interstellar gas around the Sun. The distance from\nthe Sun to the nearest other star,Proxima Centauri, is 4.2 light-years. We will see inInterstellar Matter\naround the Sunthat the gas in the immediate vicinity of the Sun is less dense than average, about 0.1\natoms per cm3. What is the total mass of interstellar hydrogen in a sphere centered on the Sun and\nextending out to Proxima Centauri? How does this compare to the mass of the Sun? It is helpful to\nremember that the volume of a sphere is related to its radius:\nAnswer:\nThe volume of a sphere stretching from the Sun to Proxima Centauri is:\nTherefore, the mass of hydrogen in this sphere is:\nThis is only (4.5 \u00d7 1028kg)/(2.0 \u00d7 1030kg) = 2.2% the mass of the Sun.\nASTRONOMY BASICS\nNaming the Nebulae\nAs you look at the captions for some of the spectacular photographs in this chapter andThe Birth of Stars\nand the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar System, you will notice the variety of names given to the\nnebulae. A few, which in small telescopes look like something recognizable, are sometimes named after the\ncreatures or objects they resemble. Examples include the Crab, Tarantula, and Keyhole Nebulae. But most\nhave only numbers that are entries in a catalog of astronomical objects.\nPerhaps the best-known catalog of nebulae (as well as star clusters and galaxies) was compiled by the\nFrench astronomer CharlesMessier(1730\u20131817). Messier\u2019s passion was discoveringcomets, and his\ndevotion to this cause earned him the nickname \u201cThe Comet Ferret\u201d from King Louis XV. When comets are\nfirst seen coming toward the Sun, they look like little fuzzy patches of light; in small telescopes, they are\neasy to confuse with nebulae or with groupings of many stars so far away that their light is all blended\ntogether. Time and again, Messier\u2019s heart leapt as he thought he had discovered one of his treasured\ncomets, only to find that he had \u201cmerely\u201d observed a nebula or cluster.\nIn frustration, Messier set out to catalog the position and appearance of over 100 objects that could be\nmistaken for comets. For him, this list was merely a tool in the far more important work of comet hunting.\nHe would be very surprised if he returned today to discover that no one recalls his comets anymore, but his\ncatalog of \u201cfuzzy things that are not comets\u201d is still widely used.

He based his\ncompilation on the work of WilliamHerscheland his son John, plus many other observers who followed\nthem. With the addition of two further listings (called theIndex Catalogs), Dreyer\u2019s compilation eventually\nincluded 13,000 objects. Astronomers today still use his NGC numbers when referring to most nebulae and\nstar groups.\n20.2 Interstellar Gas\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nName the major types of interstellar gas\nDiscuss how we can observe each type\nDescribe the temperature and other major properties of each type\nInterstellar gas, depending on where it is located, can be as cold as a few degrees above absolute zero or as\nhot as a million degrees or more. We will begin our voyage through the interstellar medium by exploring the\ndifferent conditions under which we find gas.\nIonized Hydrogen (H II) Regions\u2014Gas Near Hot Stars\nSome of the most spectacular astronomical photographs showinterstellar gaslocated near hot stars (Figure\n1\n20.3). The strongest line in the visible region of the hydrogen spectrum is the red line in the Balmer series (as\nexplained in the chapter onRadiation and Spectra); this emission line accounts for the characteristic red glow\nin images likeFigure 20.3.\nFigure20.3Orion Nebula.The red glow that pervades the greatOrion Nebulais produced by the first line in the Balmer series of\nhydrogen. Hydrogen emission indicates that there are hot young stars nearby that ionize these clouds of gas. When electrons then\nrecombine with protons and move back down into lower energy orbits, emission lines are produced. The blue color seen at the\nedges of some of the clouds is produced by small particles of dust that scatter the light from the hot stars. Dust can also be seen\n1 Scientists also call this red Balmer line the H-alpha line, with alpha meaning it is the first spectral line in the Balmer series. 652 20 \u2022 Between the Stars: Gas and Dust in Space\nsilhouetted against the glowing gas. (credit: NASA,ESA, M. Robberto (Space Telescope Science Institute/ESA) and the Hubble Space\nTelescope Orion Treasury Project Team)\nHot stars are able to heat nearby gas to temperatures close to 10,000 K. The ultraviolet radiation from the stars\nalso ionizes the hydrogen (remember that during ionization, the electron is stripped completely away from the\nproton). Such a detached proton won\u2019t remain alone forever when attractive electrons are around; it will\ncapture a free electron, becoming a neutral hydrogen once more. However, such a neutral atom can then\nabsorb ultraviolet radiation again and start the cycle over. At a typical moment, most of the atoms near a hot\nstar are in the ionized state.\nSince hydrogen is the main constituent of interstellar gas, we often characterize a region of space according to\nwhether its hydrogen is neutral or ionized. A cloud of ionized hydrogen is called anH II region. (Scientists who\nwork with spectra use the Roman numeral I to indicate that an atom is neutral; successively higher Roman\nnumerals are used for each higher stage of ionization. H II thus refers to hydrogen that has lost its one\nelectron; Fe III is iron with two electrons missing.)\nThe electrons that are captured by the hydrogen nuclei cascade down through the various energy levels of the\nhydrogen atoms on their way to the lowest level, or ground state. During each transition downward, they give\nup energy in the form of light. The process of converting ultraviolet radiation into visible light is called\nfluorescence. Interstellar gas contains other elements besides hydrogen. Many of them are also ionized in the\nvicinity of hot stars; they then capture electrons and emit light, just as hydrogen does, allowing them to be\nobserved by astronomers. But generally, the red hydrogen line is the strongest, and that is why H II regions\nlook red.\nA fluorescent light on Earth works using the same principles as a fluorescent H II region. When you turn on the\ncurrent, electrons collide with atoms of mercury vapor in the tube. The mercury is excited to a high-energy\nstate because of these collisions. When the electrons in the mercury atoms return to lower-energy levels, some\nof the energy they emit is in the form of ultraviolet photons. These, in turn, strike a phosphor-coated screen on\nthe inner wall of the light tube. The atoms in the screen absorb the ultraviolet photons and emit visible light as\nthey cascade downward among the energy levels. (The difference is that these atoms give off a wider range of\nlight colors, which mix to give the characteristic white glow of fluorescent lights, whereas the hydrogen atoms\nin an H II region give off a more limited set of colors.)\nNeutral Hydrogen Clouds\nThe very hot stars required to produce H II regions are rare, and only a small fraction of interstellar matter is\nclose enough to such hot stars to be ionized by them. Most of the volume of the interstellar medium is filled\nwith neutral (nonionized) hydrogen. How do we go about looking for it?\nUnfortunately, neutral hydrogen atoms at temperatures typical of the gas in interstellar space neither emit nor\nabsorb light in the visible part of the spectrum. Nor, for the most part, do the other trace elements that are\nmixed with the interstellar hydrogen. However, some of these other elements canabsorbvisible light even at\ntypical interstellar temperatures. This means that when we observe a bright source such as a hot star or a\ngalaxy, we can sometimes see additional lines in its spectrum produced when interstellar gas absorbs light at\nparticular frequencies (seeFigure 20.4). Some of the strongest interstellar absorption lines are produced by\ncalcium and sodium, but many other elements can be detected as well in sufficiently sensitive observations (as\ndiscussed inRadiation and Spectra).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 20.2 \u2022 Interstellar Gas 653\nFigure20.4Absorption Lines though an Interstellar Dust Cloud.When there is a significant amount of cool interstellar matter\n(gas with some dust) between us and a star, we can see the absorption lines of the gas in the star\u2019s spectrum. We can distinguish the\ntwo kinds of lines because, whereas the star\u2019s lines are broad, the lines from the gas are narrower.\nThe first evidence for absorption by interstellar clouds came from the analysis of a spectroscopic binary star\n(seeThe Stars: A Celestial Census), published in 1904. While most of the lines in the spectrum of this binary\nshifted alternately from longer to shorter wavelengths and back again, as we would expect from the Doppler\neffect for stars in orbit around each other, a few lines in the spectrum remained fixed in wavelength. Since\nboth stars are moving in a binary system, lines that showed no motion puzzled astronomers. The lines were\nalso peculiar in that they were much, much narrower than the rest of the lines, indicating that the gas\nproducing them was at a very low pressure. Subsequent work demonstrated that these lines were not formed\nin the star\u2019s atmosphere at all, but rather in a cold cloud of gas located between Earth and the binary star.\nWhile these and similar observations proved there wasinterstellar gas, they could not yet detect hydrogen, the\nmost common element, due to its lack of spectral features in the visible part of the spectrum. (The Balmer line\nof hydrogen is in the visible range, but only excited hydrogen atoms produce it. In the cold interstellar\nmedium, the hydrogen atoms are all in the ground state and no electrons are in the higher-energy levels\nrequired to produce either emission or absorption lines in the Balmer series.) Direct detection of hydrogen\nhad to await the development of telescopes capable of seeing very-low-energy changes in hydrogen atoms in\nother parts of the spectrum. The first such observations were made using radio telescopes, and radio emission\nand absorption by interstellar hydrogen remains one of our main tools for studying the vast amounts of cold\nhydrogen in the universe to this day.\nIn 1944, while he was still a student, the Dutch astronomer Hendrik van de Hulst predicted that hydrogen\nwould produce a strong line at a wavelength of 21 centimeters. That\u2019s quite a long wavelength, implying that\nthe wave has such a low frequency and low energy that it cannot come from electrons jumping between\nenergy levels (as we discussed inRadiation and Spectra). Instead, energy is emitted when the electron does a\nflip, something like an acrobat in a circus flipping upright after standing on his head.\nThe flip works like this: a hydrogen atom consists of a proton and an electron bound together. Both the proton\nand the electron act is if they were spinning like tops, and spin axes of the two tops can either be pointed in\nthe same direction (aligned) or in opposite directions (anti-aligned). If the proton and electron were spinning\nin opposite directions, the atom as a whole would have a very slightly lower energy than if the two spins were\naligned (Figure 20.5). If an atom in the lower-energy state (spins opposed) acquired a small amount of energy,\nthen the spins of the proton and electron could be aligned, leaving the atom in a slightlyexcited state. If the\natom then lost that same amount of energy again, it would return to its ground state. The amount of energy\ninvolved corresponds to a wave with a wavelength of 21 centimeters; hence, it is known as the21-centimeter\nline. 654 20 \u2022 Between the Stars: Gas and Dust in Space\nFigure20.5Formation of the 21-Centimeter Line.When the electron in a hydrogen atom is in the orbit closest to the nucleus, the\nproton and the electron may be spinning either (a) in the same direction or (b) in opposite directions. When the electron flips over,\nthe atom gains or loses a tiny bit of energy by either absorbing or emitting electromagnetic energy with a wavelength of 21\ncentimeters.\nNeutral hydrogen atoms can acquire small amounts of energy through collisions with other hydrogen atoms\nor with free electrons. Such collisions are extremely rare in the sparse gases of interstellar space. An individual\natom may wait centuries before such an encounter aligns the spins of its proton and electron. Nevertheless,\nover many millions of years, a significant fraction of the hydrogen atoms are excited by a collision. (Out there\nin cold space, that\u2019s about as much excitement as an atom typically experiences.)\nAn excited atom can later lose its excess energy either by colliding with another particle or by giving off a radio\nwave with a wavelength of 21 centimeters. If there are no collisions, an excited hydrogen atom will wait an\naverage of about 10 million years before emitting a photon and returning to its state of lowest energy. Even\nthough the probability that any single atom will emit a photon is low, there are so many hydrogen atoms in a\ntypical gas cloud that collectively they will produce an observable line at 21 centimeters.\nEquipment sensitive enough to detect the21-cm lineof neutral hydrogen became available in 1951. Dutch\nastronomers had built an instrument to detect the 21-cm waves that they had predicted, but a fire destroyed it.\nAs a result, two Harvard physicists, HaroldEwenand EdwardPurcell, made the first detection (Figure 20.6),\nsoon followed by confirmations from the Dutch and a group in Australia. Since the detection of the 21-cm line,\nmany other radio lines produced by both atoms and molecules have been discovered (as we will discuss in a\nmoment), and these have allowed astronomers to map out the neutral gas throughout our home Galaxy.\nAstronomers have also detected neutral interstellar gas, including hydrogen, at many other wavelengths from\nthe infrared to the ultraviolet.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 20.2 \u2022 Interstellar Gas 655\nFigure20.6Harold Ewen (1922\u20132015) and Edward Purcell (1912\u20131997).We see Harold Ewen in 1952 working with the horn antenna\n(atop the physics laboratory at Harvard) that made the first detection of interstellar 21-cm radiation. The inset shows Edward Purcell,\nthe winner of the 1952 Nobel Prize in physics, a few years later. (credit: modification of work by NRAO)\nModern radio observations show that most of the neutral hydrogen in our Galaxy is confined to an extremely\nflat layer, less than 300 light-years thick, that extends throughout the disk of theMilky Way Galaxy. This gas\nhas densities ranging from about 0.1 to about 100 atoms per cm3, and it exists at a wide range of\ntemperatures, from as low as about 100 K (\u2013173 \u00b0C) to as high as about 8000 K. These regions of warm and\ncold gas are interspersed with each other, and the density and temperature at any particular point in space\nare constantly changing.\nUltra-Hot Interstellar Gas\nWhile the temperatures of 10,000 K found in H II regions might seem warm, they are not the hottest phase of\nthe interstellar medium. Some of theinterstellar gasis at a temperature of amilliondegrees, even though\nthere is no visible source of heat nearby. The discovery of this ultra-hot interstellar gas was a big surprise.\nBefore the launch of astronomical observatories into space, which could see radiation in the ultraviolet and X-\nray parts of the spectrum, astronomers assumed that most of the region between stars was filled with\nhydrogen at temperatures no warmer than those found in H II regions. But telescopes launched above Earth\u2019s\natmosphere obtained ultraviolet spectra that contained interstellar lines produced by oxygen atoms that have\nbeen ionized five times. To strip five electrons from their orbits around an oxygen nucleus requires a lot of\nenergy. Subsequent observations with orbiting X-ray telescopes revealed that the Galaxy is filled with\nnumerous bubbles of X-ray-emitting gas. To emit X-rays, and to contain oxygen atoms that have been ionized\nfive times, gas must be heated to temperatures of a million degrees or more.\nTheorists have now shown that the source of energy producing these remarkable temperatures is the\nexplosion of massive stars at the ends of their lives (Figure 20.7). Such explosions, calledsupernovae, will be\ndiscussed in detail in the chapter onThe Death of Stars. For now, we\u2019ll just say that some stars, nearing the\nends of their lives, become unstable and literally explode. These explosions launch gas into interstellar space\nat velocities of tens of thousands of kilometers per second (up to about 30% the speed of light). When this\nejected gas collides with interstellar gas, it produces shocks that heat the gas to millions or tens of millions of\ndegrees. 656 20 \u2022 Between the Stars: Gas and Dust in Space\nFigure20.7Vela Supernova Remnant.About 11,000 years ago, a dying star in the constellation of Vela exploded, becoming as\nbright as the full moon in Earth\u2019s skies. You can see the faint rounded filaments from that explosion in the center of this colorful\nimage. The edges of the remnant are colliding with the interstellar medium, heating the gas they plow through to temperatures of\nmillions of K. Telescopes in space also reveal a glowing sphere of X-ray radiation from the remnant.

On\naverage, shocks launched by supernovae sweep through any given point in the Galaxy about once every few\nmillion years. These shocks keep some interstellar space filled with gas at temperatures of millions of degrees,\nand they continually disturb the colder gas, keeping it in constant, turbulent motion.\nMolecular Clouds\nA few simple molecules out in space, such as CN and CH, were discovered decades ago because they produce\nabsorption lines in the visible-light spectra of stars behind them. When more sophisticated equipment for\nobtaining spectra in radio and infrared wavelengths became available, astronomers\u2014to their surprise\u2014found\nmuch more complex molecules in interstellar clouds as well.\nJust as atoms leave their \u201cfingerprints\u201d in the spectrum of visible light, so the vibration and rotation of atoms\nwithin molecules can leave spectral fingerprints in radio and infrared waves. If we spread out the radiation at\nsuch longer wavelengths, we can detect emission or absorption lines in the spectra that are characteristic of\nspecific molecules. Over the years, experiments in our laboratories have shown us the exact wavelengths\nassociated with changes in the rotation and vibration of many common molecules, giving us a template of\npossible lines against which we can now compare our observations of interstellar matter.\nThe discovery of complex molecules in space came as a surprise because most of interstellar space is filled\nwith ultraviolet light from stars, and this light is capable ofdissociatingmolecules (breaking them apart into\nindividual atoms). In retrospect, however, the presence of molecules is not surprising. As we will discuss\nfurther in the next section, and have already seen above, interstellar space also contains significant amounts\nof dust capable of blocking out starlight. When this dust accumulates in a single location, the result is a dark\ncloud where ultraviolet starlight is blocked and molecules can survive. The largest of these structures are\ncreated where gravity pulls interstellar gas together to form giantmolecular clouds, structures as massive as\na million times the mass of the Sun. Within these, most of the interstellar hydrogen has formed the molecule\nH (molecular hydrogen). Other, more complex molecules are also present in much smaller quantities.\n2\nGiant molecular clouds have densities of hundreds to thousands of atoms per cm3, much denser than\ninterstellar space is on average. As a result, though they account for a very small fraction of the volume of\ninterstellar space, they contain a significant fraction\u201420\u201330%\u2014of the total mass of the Milky Way\u2019s gas.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 20.2 \u2022 Interstellar Gas 657\nBecause of their high density, molecular clouds block ultraviolet starlight, the main agent for heating most\ninterstellar gas. As a result, they tend to be extremely cold, with typical temperatures near 10 K (\u2212263 \u00b0C). Giant\nmolecular clouds are also the sites where new stars form, as we will discuss below.\nIt is in these dark regions of space, protected from starlight, that molecules can form. Chemical reactions\noccurring both in the gas and on the surface of dust grains lead to much more complex compounds, hundreds\nof which have been identified in interstellar space. Among the simplest of these are water (H O), carbon\n2\nmonoxide (CO), which is produced by fires on Earth, and ammonia (NH ), whose smell you recognize in strong\n3\nhome cleaning products. Carbon monoxide is particularly abundant in interstellar space and is the primary\ntool that astronomers use to study giant molecular clouds. Unfortunately, the most abundant molecule, H , is\n2\nparticularly difficult to observe directly because in most giant molecular clouds, it is too cold to emit even at\nradio wavelengths. CO, which tends to be present wherever H is found, is a much better emitter and is often\n2\nused by astronomers to trace molecular hydrogen.\nThe more complex molecules astronomers have found are mostly combinations of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon,\nnitrogen, and sulfur atoms. Many of these molecules areorganic(those that contain carbon and are\nassociated with the carbon chemistry of life on Earth.) They includeformaldehyde(used to preserve living\ntissues), alcohol (see the feature box onCocktails in Space), and antifreeze.\nIn 1996, astronomers discovered acetic acid (the prime ingredient of vinegar) in a cloud lying in the direction\nof the constellation of Sagittarius. To balance the sour with the sweet, a simple sugar (glycolaldehyde) has also\nbeen found. The largest compounds yet discovered in interstellar space arefullerenes, molecules in which 60\nor 70 carbon atoms are arranged in a cage-like configuration (seeFigure 20.8). SeeTable 20.1for a list of a few\nof the more interestinginterstellar moleculesthat have been found so far.\nFigure20.8Fullerene C60.This three-dimensional perspective shows the characteristic cage-like arrangement of the 60 carbon\natoms in a molecule of fullerene C60. Fullerene C60 is also known as a \u201cbuckyball,\u201d or as its full name, buckminsterfullerene, because\nof its similarity to the multisided architectural domes designed by American inventor R. Buckminster Fuller.\nSome Interesting Interstellar Molecules\nName Chemical Formula Use on Earth\nAmmonia NH Household cleansers\n3\nFormaldehyde H CO Embalming fluid\n2\nAcetylene HC H Fuel for a welding torch\n2\nTable20.1 658 20 \u2022 Between the Stars: Gas and Dust in Space\nSome Interesting Interstellar Molecules\nName Chemical Formula Use on Earth\nAcetic acid C H O The essence of vinegar\n2 2 4\nEthyl alcohol CH CH OH End-of-semester parties\n3 2\nEthylene glycol HOCH CH OH Antifreeze ingredient\n2 2\nBenzene C H Carbon ring, ingredient in varnishes and dyes\n6 6\nTable20.1\nThe cold interstellar clouds also contain cyanoacetylene (HC N) and acetaldehyde (CH CHO), generally\n3 3\nregarded as starting points foramino acidformation. These are building blocks of proteins, which are among\nthe fundamental chemicals from which living organisms on Earth are constructed. The presence of these\norganic molecules does not imply that life exists in space, but it does show that the chemical building blocks of\nlife can form under a wide range of conditions in the universe. As we learn more about how complex\nmolecules are produced in interstellar clouds, we gain an increased understanding of the kinds of processes\nthat preceded the beginnings of life on Earth billions of years ago.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nInterested in learning more about fullerenes, buckyballs, or buckminsterfullerenes (as they\u2019re called)?\nWatch a brief video fromNASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory(https://openstax.org/l/30NASAjetprop)that\nexplains what they are and illustrates how they were discovered in space.\nMAKING CONNECTIONS\nCocktails in Space\nAmong the molecules astronomers have identified in interstellar clouds is alcohol, which comes in two\nvarieties: methyl (or wood) alcohol and ethyl alcohol (the kind you find in cocktails). Ethyl alcohol is a pretty\ncomplex molecule, written by chemists as C H OH. It is quite plentiful in space (relatively speaking). In\n2 5\nclouds where it has been identified, we detect up to one molecule for every m3. The largest of the clouds\n(which can be several hundred light-years across) have enough ethyl alcohol to make 1028fifths of liquor.\nWe need not fear, however, that future interstellar astronauts will become interstellar alcoholics. Even if a\nspaceship were equipped with a giant funnel 1 kilometer across and could scoop it through such a cloud at\nthe speed of light, it would take about a thousand years to gather up enough alcohol for one standard\nmartini.\nFurthermore, the very same clouds also contain water (H O) molecules. Your scoop would gather them up\n2\nas well, and there are a lot more of them because they are simpler and thus easier to form. For the fun of it,\none astronomical paper actually calculated the proof of a typical cloud.Proofis the ratio of alcohol to water\nin a drink, where 0 proof means all water, 100 proof means half alcohol and half water, and 200 proof\nAccess for free at openstax.org 20.3 \u2022 Cosmic Dust 659\nmeans all alcohol. The proof of the interstellar cloud was only 0.2, not enough to qualify as a stiff drink\n20.3 Cosmic Dust\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe how we can detect interstellar dust\nUnderstand the role and importance of infrared observations in studying dust\nExplain the terms extinction and interstellar reddening\nFigure 20.9shows a striking example of what is actually a common sight through large telescopes: a dark\nregion on the sky that appears to be nearly empty of stars. For a long time, astronomers debated whether\nthese dark regions were empty \u201ctunnels\u201d through which we looked beyond the stars of the Milky Way Galaxy\ninto intergalactic space, or clouds of some dark material that blocked the light of the stars beyond. The\nastronomer William Herschel (discoverer of the planet Uranus) thought it was the former, once remarking\nafter seeing one, \u201cHere truly is a hole in heaven!\u201d However, American astronomer E. E. Barnard is generally\ncredited with showing from his extensive series of nebula photographs that the latter interpretation is the\ncorrect one (see the feature box onEdward Emerson Barnard).\nFigure20.9Barnard 68.This object, first catalogued by E. E. Barnard, is a dark interstellar cloud. Its striking appearance is due to the\nfact that, since it is relatively close to Earth, there are no bright stars between us and it, and its dust obscures the light from the stars\nbehind it. (It looks a little bit like a sideways heart; one astronomers sent a photo of this object to his sweetheart as a valentine.)\n(credit: modification of work by ESO)\nDusty clouds in space betray their presence in several ways: by blocking the light from distant stars, by\nemitting energy in the infrared part of the spectrum, by reflecting the light from nearby stars, and by making\ndistant stars look redder than they really are.\nVOYAGERS IN ASTRONOMY\nEdward Emerson Barnard\nBorn in 1857 in Nashville, Tennessee, two months after his father died, EdwardBarnard(Figure 20.10) grew\nup in such poor circumstances that he had to drop out of school at age nine to help support his ailing\nmother. He soon became an assistant to a local photographer, where he learned to love both photography 660 20 \u2022 Between the Stars: Gas and Dust in Space\nand astronomy, destined to become the dual passions of his life. He worked as a photographer\u2019s aide for 17\nyears, studying astronomy on his own. In 1883, he obtained a job as an assistant at the Vanderbilt\nUniversity Observatory, which enabled him at last to take some astronomy courses.\nMarried in 1881, Barnard built a house for his family that he could ill afford. But as it happened, a patent\nmedicine manufacturer offered a $200 prize (a lot of money in those days) for the discovery of any new\ncomet. With the determination that became characteristic of him, Barnard spent every clear night searching\nforcomets. He discovered seven of them between 1881 and 1887, earning enough money to make the\npayments on his home; this \u201cComet House\u201d later became a local attraction. (By the end of his life, Barnard\nhad found 17 comets through diligent observation.)\nIn 1887, Barnard got a position at the newly founded Lick Observatory, where he soon locked horns with\nthe director, EdwardHolden, a blustering administrator who made Barnard\u2019s life miserable. (To be fair,\nBarnard soon tried to do the same for him.) Despite being denied the telescope time that he needed for his\nphotographic work, in 1892, Barnard managed to discover the first new moon found around Jupiter since\nGalileo\u2019s day, a stunning observational feat that earned him world renown. Now in a position to demand\nmore telescope time, he perfected his photographic techniques and soon began to publish the best images\nof the Milky Way taken up to that time. It was during the course of this work that he began to examine the\ndark regions among the crowded star lanes of the Galaxy and to realize that they must be vast clouds of\nobscuring material (rather than \u201choles\u201d in the distribution of stars).\nAstronomer-historian DonaldOsterbrockhas called Barnard an \u201cobservaholic:\u201d his daily mood seemed to\ndepend entirely on how clear the sky promised to be for his night of observing. He was a driven, neurotic\nman, concerned about his lack of formal training, fearful of being scorned, and afraid that he might\nsomehow slip back into the poverty of his younger days. He had difficulty taking vacations and lived for his\nwork: only serious illness could deter him from making astronomical observations.\nIn 1895, Barnard, having had enough of the political battles at Lick, accepted a job at the Yerkes\nObservatory near Chicago, where he remained until his death in 1923. He continued his photographic work,\npublishing compilations of his images that became classic photographic atlases, and investigating the\nvarieties of nebulae revealed in his photographs. He also made measurements of the sizes and features of\nplanets, participated in observations of solar eclipses, and carefully cataloged dark nebulae (seeFigure\n20.9). In 1916, he discovered the star with the largest proper motion, the second-closest star system to our\nown (seeAnalyzing Starlight). It is now called Barnard\u2019s Star in his honor.\nFigure20.10Edward Emerson Barnard (1857\u20131923).Barnard\u2019s observations provided information that furthered many\nastronomical explorations. (credit: The Lick Observatory)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 20.3 \u2022 Cosmic Dust 661\nDetecting Dust\nThe dark cloud seen inFigure 20.9blocks the light of the many stars that lie behind it; note how the regions in\nother parts of the photograph are crowded with stars. Barnard 68 is an example of a relatively dense cloud or\ndark nebulacontaining tiny, solid dust grains. Such opaque clouds are conspicuous on any photograph of the\nMilky Way, the galaxy in which the Sun is located (see the figures inThe Milky Way Galaxy). The \u201cdark rift,\u201d\nwhich runs lengthwise down a long part of the Milky Way in our sky and appears to split it in two, is produced\nby a collection of such obscuring clouds.\nWhile dust clouds are too cold to radiate a measurable amount of energy in the visible part of the spectrum,\nthey glow brightly in the infrared (Figure 20.11). The reason is that small dust grains absorb visible light and\nultraviolet radiation very efficiently. The grains are heated by the absorbed radiation, typically to temperatures\nfrom 10 to about 500 K, and re-radiate this heat at infrared wavelengths.\nFigure20.11Visible and Infrared Images of the Horsehead Nebula in Orion.This dark cloud is one of the best-known images in\nastronomy, probably because it really does resemble a horse\u2019s head. The horse-head shape is an extension of a large cloud of dust\nthat fills the lower part of the picture. (a) Seen in visible light, the dust clouds are especially easy to see against the bright\nbackground. (b) This infrared radiation image from the region of the horse head was recorded by NASA\u2019s Wide-Field Infrared Survey\nExplorer. Note how the regions that appear dark in visible light appear bright in the infrared. The dust is heated by nearby stars and\nre-radiates this heat in the infrared. Only the top of the horse\u2019s head is visible in the infrared image. Bright dots seen in the nebula\nbelow and to the left and at the top of the horse head are young, newly formed stars. The insets show the horse head and the bright\nnebula in more detail. (credit a: modification of work by ESO and Digitized Sky Survey; credit b: modification of work by NASA/JPL-\nCaltech)\nThanks to their small sizes and low temperatures, interstellar grains radiate most of their energy at infrared to\nmicrowave frequencies, with wavelengths of tens to hundreds of microns. Earth\u2019s atmosphere is opaque to\nradiation at these wavelengths, so emission byinterstellar dustis best measured from space. Observations\nfrom above Earth\u2019s atmosphere show that dust clouds are present throughout the plane of the Milky Way\n(Figure 20.12). 662 20 \u2022 Between the Stars: Gas and Dust in Space\nFigure20.12Infrared Emission from the Plane of the Milky Way.This infrared image taken by the Spitzer Space Telescope shows\na field in the plane of theMilky Way Galaxy. (Our Galaxy is in the shape of a frisbee; the plane of the Milky Way is the flat disk of that\nfrisbee. Since the Sun, Earth, and solar system are located in the plane of the Milky Way and at a large distance from its center, we\nview the Galaxy edge on, much as we might look at a glass plate from its edge.) This emission is produced by tiny dust grains, which\nemit at 3.6 microns (blue in this image), 8.0 microns (green), and 24 microns (red). The densest regions of dust are so cold and\nopaque that they appear as dark clouds even at these infrared wavelengths. The red bubbles visible throughout indicate regions\nwhere the dust has been warmed up by young stars. This heating increases the emission at 24 microns, leading to the redder color\nin this image. (credit: modification of work by NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Wisconsin)\nSome dense clouds of dust are close to luminous stars and scatter enough starlight to become visible. Such a\ncloud of dust, illuminated by starlight, is called areflection nebula, since the light we see is starlight reflected\noff the grains of dust. One of the best-known examples is the nebulosity around each of the brightest stars in\nthe Pleiades cluster (seeFigure 20.1). The dust grains are small, and such small particles turn out to scatter\nlight with blue wavelengths more efficiently than light at red wavelengths. A reflection nebula, therefore,\nusually appears bluer than its illuminating star (Figure 20.13).\nFigure20.13Pleiades Star Cluster.The bluish light surrounding the stars in this image is an example of a reflection nebula. Like fog\naround a street lamp, a reflection nebula shines only because the dust within it scatters light from a nearby bright source. The\nPleiadescluster is currently passing through an interstellar cloud that contains dust grains, which scatter the light from the hot blue\nstars in the cluster. The Pleiades cluster is about 400 light-years from the Sun. (credit: NASA, ESA and AURA/Caltech)\nGas and dust are generally intermixed in space, although the proportions are not exactly the same\neverywhere. The presence of dust is apparent in many photographs ofemission nebulaein the constellation of\nSagittarius, where we see an H II region surrounded by a blue reflection nebula. Which type of nebula appears\nbrighter depends on the kinds of stars that cause the gas and dust to glow. Stars cooler than about 25,000 K\nhave so little ultraviolet radiation of wavelengths shorter than 91.2 nanometers\u2014which is the wavelength\nrequired to ionize hydrogen\u2014that the reflection nebulae around such stars outshine the emission nebulae.\nStars hotter than 25,000 K emit enough ultraviolet energy that the emission nebulae produced around them\ngenerally outshine the reflection nebulae.\nInterstellar Reddening\nThe tiny interstellar dust grains absorb some of the starlight they intercept. But at least half of the starlight\nthat interacts with a grain is merely scattered, that is, it is redirected rather than absorbed. Since neither the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 20.3 \u2022 Cosmic Dust 663\nabsorbed nor the scattered starlight reaches us directly, both absorption and scattering make stars look\ndimmer. The effects of both processes are calledinterstellar extinction(Figure 20.14).\nAstronomers first came to understand interstellar extinction around the early 1930s, as the explanation of a\npuzzling observation. In the early part of the twentieth century, astronomers discovered that some stars look\nred even though their spectral lines indicate that they must be extremely hot (and thus should look blue). The\nsolution to this seeming contradiction turned out to be that the light from these hot stars is not only dimmed\nbut also reddened by interstellar dust, a phenomenon known as interstellarreddening.\nFigure20.14Barnard 68 in Infrared.In this image, we see Barnard 68, the same object shown inFigure 20.9. The difference is that,\nin the previous image, the blue, green, and red channels showed light in the visible (or very nearly visible) part of the spectrum. In\nthis image, the red color shows radiation emitted in the infrared at a wavelength of 2.2 microns. Interstellar extinction is much\nsmaller at infrared than at visible wavelengths, so the stars behind the cloud become visible in the infrared channel. (credit: ESO)\nDust does not interact with all the colors of light the same way. Much of the violet, blue, and green light from\nthese stars has been scattered or absorbed by dust, so it does not reach Earth. Some of their orange and red\nlight, with longer wavelengths, on the other hand, more easily penetrates the intervening dust and completes\nits long journey through space to enter Earth-based telescopes (Figure 20.15). Thus, the star looks redder from\nEarth than it would if you could see it from nearby. (Strictly speaking,reddeningis not the most accurate term\nfor this process, since no red color is added; instead, blues and related colors are subtracted, so it should more\nproperly be called \u201cdeblueing.\u201d) In the most extreme cases, stars can be so reddened that they are entirely\nundetectable at visible wavelengths and can be seen only at infrared or longer wavelengths (Figure 20.14). 664 20 \u2022 Between the Stars: Gas and Dust in Space\nFigure20.15Scattering of Light by Dust.Interstellar dust scatters blue light more efficiently than red light, thereby making distant\nstars appear redder and giving clouds of dust near stars a bluish hue. Here, a red ray of light from a star comes straight through to\nthe observer, whereas a blue ray is shown scattering. A similar scattering process makes Earth\u2019s sky look blue.\nWe have all seen an example of reddening on Earth. The Sun appears much redder at sunset than it does at\nnoon. The lower the Sun is in the sky, the longer the path its light must travel through the atmosphere. Over\nthis greater distance, there is a greater chance that sunlight will be scattered. Since red light is less likely to be\nscattered than blue light, the Sun appears more and more red as it approaches the horizon.\nBy the way, scattering of sunlight is also what causes our sky to look blue, even though the gases that make up\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere are transparent. As sunlight comes in, it scatters from the molecules of air. The small size\nof the molecules means that the blue colors scatter much more efficiently than the greens, yellows, and reds.\nThus, the blue in sunlight is scattered out of the beam and all over the sky. The light from the Sun that comes\nto your eye, on the other hand, is missing some of its blue, so the Sun looks a bit yellower, even when it is high\nin the sky, than it would from space.\nThe fact that starlight is reddened by interstellar dust means that long-wavelength radiation is transmitted\nthrough the Galaxy more efficiently than short-wavelength radiation. Consequently, if we wish to see farther in\na direction with considerable interstellar material, we should look at long wavelengths. This simple fact\nprovides one of the motivations for the development of infrared astronomy. In the infrared region at 2\nmicrons (2000 nanometers), for example, the obscuration is only one-sixth as great as in the visible region (500\nnanometers), and we can therefore study stars that are more than twice as distant before their light is blocked\nby interstellar dust. This ability to see farther by observing in the infrared portion of the spectrum represents a\nmajor gain for astronomers trying to understand the structure of our Galaxy or probing its puzzling, but\ndistant, center (seeThe Milky Way Galaxy).\nInterstellar Grains\nBefore we get to the details aboutinterstellar dust, we should perhaps get one concern out of the way. Why\ncouldn\u2019t it be the interstellargasthat reddens distant stars and not the dust? We already know from everyday\nexperience that atomic or molecular gas is almost transparent. Consider Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Despite its very\nhigh density compared with that of interstellar gas, it is so transparent as to be practically invisible. (Gas does\nhave a few specific spectral lines, but they absorb only a tiny fraction of the light as it passes through.)The\nquantity ofgasrequired to produce the observed absorption of light in interstellar space would have to be\nenormous. The gravitational attraction of so great a mass of gas would affect the motions of stars in ways that\ncould easily be detected. Such motions are not observed, and thus, the interstellar absorption cannot be the\nresult of gases.\nAlthough gas does not absorb much light, we know from everyday experience that tiny solid or liquid particles\nAccess for free at openstax.org 20.3 \u2022 Cosmic Dust 665\ncan be very efficient absorbers. Water vapor in the air is quite invisible. When some of that vapor condenses\ninto tiny water droplets, however, the resulting cloud is opaque. Dust storms, smoke, and smog offer familiar\nexamples of the efficiency with which solid particles absorb light. On the basis of arguments like these,\nastronomers have concluded that widely scatteredsolidparticles in interstellar space must be responsible for\nthe observed dimming of starlight. What are these particles made of? And how did they form?\nObservations like the pictures in this chapter show that a great deal of this dust exists; hence, it must be\nprimarily composed of elements that are abundant in the universe (and in interstellar matter). After hydrogen\nand helium, the most abundant elements are oxygen, carbon, and nitrogen. These three elements, along with\nmagnesium, silicon, iron\u2014and perhaps hydrogen itself\u2014turn out to be the most important components of\ninterstellar dust.\nMany of the dust particles can be characterized as sootlike (rich in carbon) or sandlike (containing silicon and\noxygen). Grains of interstellar dust are found in meteorites and can be identified because the abundances of\ncertain isotopes are different from what we see in other solar system material. Several different interstellar\ndust substances have been identified in this way in the laboratory, including graphite and diamonds. (Don\u2019t\nget excited; these diamonds are only a billionth of a meter in size and would hardly make an impressive\nengagement ring!)\nThe most widely accepted model pictures the grains with rocky cores that are either like soot (rich in carbon)\nor like sand (rich in silicates). In the dark clouds where molecules can form, these cores are covered by icy\nmantles (Figure 20.16). The most common ices in the grains are water (H O), methane (CH ), and ammonia\n2 4\n(NH )\u2014all built out of atoms that are especially abundant in the realm of the stars. The ice mantles, in turn, are\n3\nsites for some of the chemical reactions that produce complex organic molecules.\nFigure20.16Model of an Interstellar Dust Grain.A typical interstellar grain is thought to consist of a core of rocky material\n(silicates) or graphite, surrounded by a mantle of ices. Typical grain sizes are 10\u20138to 10\u20137meters. (This is from 1/100 to 1/10 of a\nmicron; by contrast, human hair is about 10\u2013200 microns wide.)\nTypical individual grains must be just slightly smaller than the wavelength of visible light. If the grains were a\nlot smaller, they would not block the light efficiently, asFigure 20.13and other images in this chapter show\nthat it does.\nOn the other hand, if the dust grains were much larger than the wavelength of light, then starlight would not\nbe reddened. Things that are much larger than the wavelength of light would block both blue and red light\nwith equal efficiency. In this way we can deduce that a characteristic interstellar dust grain contains 106to 109 666 20 \u2022 Between the Stars: Gas and Dust in Space\natoms and has a diameter of 10\u20138to 10\u20137meters (10 to 100 nanometers). This is actually more like the specks\nof solid matter in cigarette smoke than the larger grains of dust you might find under your desk when you are\ntoo busy studying astronomy to clean properly.\n20.4 Cosmic Rays\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDefine cosmic rays and describe their composition\nExplain why it is hard to study the origin of cosmic rays, and the current leading hypotheses about where\nthey might come from\nIn addition to gas and dust, a third class of particles, noteworthy for the high speeds with which they travel, is\nfound in interstellar space.Cosmic rayswere discovered in 1911 by an Austrian physicist, Victor Hess, who\nflew simple instruments aboard balloons and showed that high-speed particles arrive at Earth from space\n(Figure 20.17). The term \u201ccosmic ray\u201d is misleading, implying it might be like a ray of light, but we are stuck\nwith the name. They are definitely particles and have nearly the same composition as ordinary interstellar gas.\nTheir behavior, however, is radically different from the gas we have discussed so far.\nFigure20.17Victor Hess (1883\u20131964).Cosmic-ray pioneer Victor Hess returns from a 1912 balloon flight that reached an altitude of\n5.3 kilometers. It was on such balloon flights that Hess discovered cosmic rays.\nThe Nature of Cosmic Rays\nCosmic rays are mostly high-speed atomic nuclei and electrons. Speeds equal to 90% of the speed of light are\ntypical. Almost 90% of the cosmic rays are hydrogen nuclei (protons) stripped of their accompanying electron.\nHelium and heavier nuclei constitute about 9% more. About 1% of cosmic rays have masses equal to the mass\nof the electron, and 10\u201320% of these carry positive charge rather than the negative charge that characterizes\nelectrons. A positively charged particle with the mass of an electron is called apositronand is a form of\nantimatter(we discussed antimatter inThe Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse).\nThe abundances of various atomic nuclei in cosmic rays mirror the abundances in stars and interstellar gas,\nwith one important exception. The light elements lithium, beryllium, and boron are far more abundant in\ncosmic rays than in the Sun and stars. These light elements are formed when high-speed, cosmic-ray nuclei of\ncarbon, nitrogen, and oxygen collide with protons in interstellar space and break apart. (By the way, if you, like\nmost readers, have not memorized all the elements and want to see how any of those we mention fit into the\nsequence of elements, you will find them all listed inAppendix Kin order of the number of protons they\ncontain.)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 20.4 \u2022 Cosmic Rays 667\nCosmic rays reach Earth in substantial numbers, and we can determine their properties either by capturing\nthem directly or by observing the reactions that occur when they collide with atoms in our atmosphere. The\ntotal energy deposited by cosmic rays in Earth\u2019s atmosphere is only about one-billionth the energy received\nfrom the Sun, but it is comparable to the energy received in the form of starlight. Some of the cosmic rays\ncome to Earth from the surface of the Sun, but most come from outside the solar system.\nWhere Do They Come From?\nThere is a serious problem in identifying the source of cosmic rays. Since light travels in straight lines, we can\ntell where it comes from simply by looking. Cosmic rays are charged particles, and their direction of motion\ncan be changed by magnetic fields. The paths of cosmic rays are curved both by magnetic fields in interstellar\nspace and by Earth\u2019s own field. Calculations show that low-energy cosmic rays may spiral many times around\nEarth before entering the atmosphere where we can detect them. If an airplane circles an airport many times\nbefore landing, it is difficult for an observer to determine the direction from which it originated. So, too, after a\ncosmic ray circles Earth several times, it is impossible to know where its journey began.\nThere are a few clues, however, about where cosmic rays might be generated. We know, for example, that\nmagnetic fields in interstellar space are strong enough to keep all but the most energetic cosmic rays from\nescaping the Galaxy. It therefore seems likely that they are produced somewhere inside the Galaxy. The only\nlikely exceptions are those with the very highest energy. Such cosmic rays move so rapidly that they are not\nsignificantly influenced by interstellar magnetic fields, and thus, they could escape our Galaxy. By analogy,\nthey could escape other galaxies as well, so some of the highest-energy cosmic rays that we detect may have\nbeen created in some distant galaxy. Still, most cosmic rays must have their source inside theMilky Way\nGalaxy.\nWe can also estimate how far typical cosmic rays travel before striking Earth. The light elements lithium,\nberyllium, and boron hold the key. Since these elements are formed when carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen strike\ninterstellar protons, we can calculate how long, on average, cosmic rays must travel through space in order to\nexperience enough collisions to account for the amount of lithium and the other light elements that they\ncontain. It turns out that the required distance is about 30 times around the Galaxy. At speeds near the speed\nof light, it takes perhaps 3\u201310 million years for the average cosmic ray to travel this distance. This is only a\nsmall fraction of the age of the Galaxy or the universe, so cosmic rays must have been created fairly recently\non a cosmic timescale.\nThe best candidates for a source of cosmic rays are thesupernovaexplosions, which mark the violent deaths\nof some stars (and which we will discuss inThe Death of Stars). The material ejected by the explosion produces\na shock wave, which travels through the interstellar medium. Charged particles can become trapped, bouncing\nback and forth across the front of the shock wave many times. With each pass through the shock, the\nmagnetic fields inside it accelerate the particles more and more. Eventually, they are traveling at close to the\nspeed of light and can escape from the shock to become cosmic rays. Some collapsed stars (including star\nremnants left over from supernova explosions) may, under the right circumstances, also serve as accelerators\nof particles. In any case, we again find that the raw material of the Galaxy is enriched by the life cycle of stars.\nIn the next section, we will look at this enrichment process in more detail.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nYou can watch abrief video about the Calorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET)(https://openstax.org/l/\n30CALETvid)mission, a cosmic ray detector at the International Space Station.

Interstellar gas\norbits through the Galaxy, and as it does so, it can become more or less dense, hotter and colder, and change\nits state of ionization. A particular parcel of gas may be neutral hydrogen at some point, then find itself near a\nyoung, hot star and become part of an H II region. The star may then explode as a supernova, heating the\nnearby gas up to temperatures of millions of degrees. Over millions of years, the gas may cool back down and\nbecome neutral again, before it collects into a dense region that gravity gathers into a giant molecular cloud\n(Figure 20.18)\nFigure20.18Large-Scale Distribution of Interstellar Matter.This image is from a computer simulation of theMilky Way Galaxy\u2019s\ninterstellar mediumas a whole. The majority of gas, visible in greenish colors, is neutral hydrogen. In the densest regions in the\nspiral arms, shown in yellow, the gas is collected into giant molecular clouds. Low-density holes in the spiral arms, shown in blue, are\nthe result of supernova explosions. (credit: modification of work by Mark Krumholz)\nAt any given time in the Milky Way, the majority of the interstellar gas by mass and volume is in the form of\natomic hydrogen. The much-denser molecular clouds occupy a tiny fraction of the volume of interstellar space\nbut add roughly 30% to the total mass of gas between the stars. Conversely, the hot gas produced by\nsupernova explosions contributes a negligible mass but occupies a significant fraction of the volume of\ninterstellar space. H II regions, though they are visually spectacular, constitute only a very small fraction of\neither the mass or volume of interstellar material.\nHowever, theinterstellar mediumis not a closed system. Gas from intergalactic space constantly falls onto the\nMilky Way due to its gravity, adding new gas to the interstellar medium. Conversely, in giant molecular clouds\nwhere gas collects together due to gravity, the gas can collapse to form new stars, as discussed inThe Birth of\nStars and the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar System. This process locks interstellar matter into stars. As\nthe stars age, evolve, and eventually die, massive stars lose a large fraction of their mass, and low-mass stars\nAccess for free at openstax.org 20.5 \u2022 The Life Cycle of Cosmic Material 669\nlose very little. On average, roughly one-third of the matter incorporated into stars goes back into interstellar\nspace. Supernova explosions have so much energy that they can drive interstellar mass out of the Galaxy and\nback into intergalactic space. Thus, the total amount of mass of the interstellar medium is set by a competition\nbetween the gain of mass from intergalactic space, the conversion of interstellar mass into stars, and the loss\nof interstellar mass back into intergalactic space due to supernovae. This entire process is known as the\nbaryon cycle\u2014baryon is from the Greek word for \u201cheavy,\u201d and the cycle has this name because it is the\nrepeating process that the heavier components of the universe\u2014the atoms\u2014undergo.\nThe Cycle of Dust and Heavy Elements\nWhile much of the mass of the interstellar medium is material accreted during the last few billion years from\nintergalactic space, this is not true of the elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, or of the dust. Instead,\nthese components of the interstellar medium were made inside stars in the Milky Way, which returned them to\nthe interstellar medium at the end of their lives. We will talk more about this process in later chapters, but for\nnow just bear in mind what we learned inThe Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse. What stars \u201cdo for a living\u201d is fuse\nheavier elements from lighter ones, producing energy in the process. As stars mature, they begin to lose some\nof the newly made elements to the reservoir of interstellar matter.\nThe same is true of dust grains. Dust forms when grains can condense in regions where gas is dense and cool.\nOne place where the right conditions are found is the winds from luminous cool stars (the red giants and\nsupergiants we discussed inThe Stars: A Celestial Census). Grains can also condense in the matter thrown off\nby a supernova explosion as the ejected gases begin to cool.\nThe dust grains produced by stars may grow even further when they spend time in the dense parts of the\ninterstellar medium, inside molecular clouds. In these environments, grains can stick together or gather\nadditional atoms from the gas around them, growing larger. They also facilitate the production of other\ncompounds, including some of the more complex molecules we discussed earlier.\nThe surfaces of the dust grains (seeCosmic Dust)\u2014which would seem very large if you were an atom\u2014provide\n\u201cnooks and crannies\u201d where these atoms can stick long enough to find partners and form molecules. (Think of\nthe dust grains as \u201cinterstellar social clubs\u201d where lonely atoms can meet and form meaningful relationships.)\nEventually, the dust grains become coated with ices. The presence of the dust shields the molecules inside the\nclouds from ultraviolet radiation and cosmic rays that would break them up.\nWhen stars finally begin to form within the cloud, they heat the grains and evaporate the ices. The\ngravitational attraction of the newly forming stars also increases the density of the surrounding cloud\nmaterial. Many more chemical reactions take place on the surfaces of grains in the gas surrounding the newly\nforming stars, and these areas are where organic molecules are formed. These molecules can be incorporated\ninto newly formed planetary systems, and the early Earth may have been seeded in just such a way.\nIndeed, scientists speculate that some of the water on Earth may have come from interstellar grains. Recent\nobservations from space have shown that water is abundant in dense interstellar clouds. Since stars are\nformed from this material, water must be present when solar systems, including our own, come into existence.\nThe water in our oceans and lakes may have come initially from water locked into the rocky material that\naccreted to form Earth. Alternatively, the water may have been brought to Earth when asteroids and comets\n(formed from the same cloud that made the planets) later impacted it. Scientists estimate that one comet\nimpact every thousand years during Earth\u2019s first billion years would have been enough to account for the\nwater we see today. Of course, both sources may have contributed to the water we now enjoy drinking and\nswimming in.\nAny interstellar grains that are incorporated into newly forming stars (instead of the colder planets and\nsmaller bodies around them) will be destroyed by their high temperatures. But eventually, each new\ngeneration of stars will evolve to become red giants, with stellar winds of their own. Some of these stars will\nalso become supernovae and explode. Thus, the process of recycling cosmic material can start all over again. 670 20 \u2022 Between the Stars: Gas and Dust in Space\n20.6 Interstellar Matter around the Sun\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe how interstellar matter is arranged around our solar system\nExplain why scientists think that the Sun is located in a hot bubble\nWe want to conclude our discussion of interstellar matter by asking how this material is organized in our\nimmediate neighborhood. As we discussed above, orbiting X-ray observatories have shown that the Galaxy is\nfull of bubbles of hot, X-ray-emitting gas. They also revealed a diffuse background of X-rays that appears to fill\nthe entire sky from our perspective (Figure 20.19). While some of this emission comes from the interaction of\nthe solar wind with the interstellar medium, a majority of it comes from beyond the solar system. The natural\nexplanation for why there is X-ray-emitting gas all around us is that the Sun is itself inside one of the bubbles.\nWe therefore call our \u201cneighborhood\u201d the Local Hot Bubble, orLocal Bubblefor short. The Local Bubble is\nmuch less dense\u2014an average of approximately 0.01 atoms per cm3\u2014than the average interstellar density of\nabout 1 atom per cm3. This local gas has a temperature of about a million degrees, just like the gas in the\nother superbubbles that spread throughout our Galaxy, but because there is so little hot material, this high\ntemperature does not affect the stars or planets in the area in any way.\nWhat caused the Local Bubble to form? Scientists are not entirely sure, but the leading candidate is winds from\nstars and supernova explosions. In a nearby region in the direction of the constellations Scorpius and\nCentaurus, a lot of star formation took place about 15 million years ago. The most massive of these stars\nevolved very quickly until they produced strong winds, and some ended their lives by exploding. These\nprocesses filled the region around the Sun with hot gas, driving away cooler, denser gas. The rim of this\nexpanding superbubble reached the Sun about 7.6 million years ago and now lies more than 200 light-years\npast the Sun in the general direction of the constellations of Orion, Perseus, and Auriga.\nFigure20.19Sky in X-Rays.This image, made by the ROSAT satellite, shows the whole sky in X-rays as seen from Earth. Different\ncolors indicate different X-ray energies: red is 0.25 kiloelectron volts, green is 0.75 kiloelectron volts, and blue is 1.5 kiloelectron volts.\nThe image is oriented so the plane of the Galaxy runs across the middle of the image. The ubiquitous red color, which does not\ndisappear completely even in the galactic plane, is evidence for a source of X-rays all around the Sun. (credit: modification of work by\nNASA)\nA few clouds of interstellar matter do exist within the Local Bubble. TheSunitself seems to have entered a\ncloud about 10,000 years ago. This cloud is warm (with a temperature of about 7000 K) and has a density of 0.3\nhydrogen atom per cm3\u2014higher than most of the Local Bubble but still so tenuous that it is also referred to as\nLocal Fluff(Figure 20.20). (Aren\u2019t these astronomical names fun sometimes?)\nWhile this is a pretty thin cloud, we estimate that it contributes 50 to 100 times more particles than the solar\nwind to the diffuse material between the planets in our solar system. These interstellar particles have been\nAccess for free at openstax.org 20.6 \u2022 Interstellar Matter around the Sun 671\ndetected and their numbers counted by the spacecraft traveling between the planets. Perhaps someday,\nscientists will devise a way to collect them without destroying them and to return them to Earth, so that we can\ntouch\u2014or at least study in our laboratories\u2014these messengers from distant stars.\nFigure20.20Local Fluff.The Sun and planets are currently moving through the Local Interstellar Cloud, which is also called the\nLocal Fluff. Fluff is an appropriate description because the density of this cloud is only about 0.3 atom per cm3. In comparison,\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere at the edge of space has around 1.2 \u00d7 1013molecules per cm3. This image shows the patches of interstellar\nmatter (mostly hydrogen gas) within about 20 light-years of the Sun. The temperature of the Local Interstellar Cloud is about 7000 K.\nThe arrows point toward the directions that different parts of the cloud are moving. The names associated with each arrow indicate\nthe constellations located on the sky toward which the parts of the cloud are headed. The solar system is thought to have entered\nthe Local Interstellar Cloud, which is a small cloud located within a much larger superbubble that is expanding outward from the\nScorpius-Centaurus region of the sky, at some point between 44,000 and 150,000 years ago and is expected to remain within it for\nanother 10,000 to 20,000 years.

About 99% of this interstellar matter is in the form of gas\u2014individual atoms or molecules. The most\nabundant elements in the interstellar gas are hydrogen and helium. About 1% of the interstellar matter is in\nthe form of solid interstellar dust grains.\n20.2Interstellar Gas\nInterstellar gas may be hot or cold. Gas found near hot stars emits light by fluorescence, that is, light is\nemitted when an electron is captured by an ion and cascades down to lower-energy levels. Glowing clouds\n(nebulae) of ionized hydrogen are called H II regions and have temperatures of about 10,000 K. Most\nhydrogen in interstellar space is not ionized and can best be studied by radio measurements of the\n21-centimeter line. Some of the gas in interstellar space is at a temperature of a million degrees, even though\nit is far away in hot stars; this ultra-hot gas is probably heated when rapidly moving gas ejected in supernova\nexplosions sweeps through space. In some places, gravity gathers interstellar gas into giant clouds, within\nwhich the gas is protected from starlight and can form molecules; more than 200 different molecules have\nbeen found in space, including the basic building blocks of proteins, which are fundamental to life as we know\nit here on Earth.\n20.3Cosmic Dust\nInterstellar dust can be detected: (1) when it blocks the light of stars behind it, (2) when it scatters the light\nfrom nearby stars, and (3) because it makes distant stars look both redder and fainter. These effects are called\ninterstellar extinction and reddening. Dust can also be detected in the infrared because it emits heat radiation.\nDust is found throughout the plane of the Milky Way. The dust particles are about the same size as the\nwavelength of light and consist of rocky cores that are either sootlike (carbon-rich) or sandlike (silicates) with\nmantles made of ices such as water, ammonia, and methane.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 20 \u2022 For Further Exploration 673\n20.4Cosmic Rays\nCosmic rays are particles that travel through interstellar space at a typical speed of 90% of the speed of light.\nThe most abundant elements in cosmic rays are the nuclei of hydrogen and helium, but electrons and\npositrons are also found. It is likely that many cosmic rays are produced in supernova shocks.\n20.5The Life Cycle of Cosmic Material\nInterstellar matter is constantly flowing through the Galaxy and changing from one phase to another. At the\nsame time, gas is constantly being added to the Galaxy by accretion from extragalactic space, while mass is\nremoved from the interstellar medium by being locked in stars. Some of the mass in stars is, in turn, returned\nto the interstellar medium when those stars evolve and die. In particular, the heavy elements in interstellar\nspace were all produced inside stars, while the dust grains are made in the outer regions of stars that have\nswelled to be giants. These elements and grains, in turn, can then be incorporated into new stars and\nplanetary systems that form out of the interstellar medium.\n20.6Interstellar Matter around the Sun\nThe Sun is located at the edge of a low-density cloud called the Local Fluff. The Sun and this cloud are located\nwithin the Local Bubble, a region extending to at least 300 light-years from the Sun, within which the density of\ninterstellar material is extremely low. Astronomers think this bubble was blown by some nearby stars that\nexperienced a strong wind and some supernova explosions.\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nGoodman, A. \u201cRecycling the Universe.\u201dSky & TelescopeNovember (2000): 44.

Would you expect to find an H II region around\nAntares? Explain your answer.\n15. Even though neutral hydrogen is the most abundant element in interstellar matter, it was detected first\nwith a radio telescope, not a visible light telescope. Explain why.

Describe the spectrum of each of the following:\nA. starlight reflected by dust,\nB. a star behind invisible interstellar gas, and\nC. an emission nebula.\n19.

One way to calculate the size and shape of the Galaxy is to estimate the distances to faint stars just from\ntheir observed apparent brightnesses and to note the distance at which stars are no longer observable.\nThe first astronomers to try this experiment did not know that starlight is dimmed by interstellar dust.\nTheir estimates of the size of the Galaxy were much too small.

Would you more likely be successful if you observed at visible\nwavelengths or at infrared wavelengths? Why?\n23. Thinking about the topics in this chapter, here is an Earth analogy. In big cities, you can see much farther\non days without smog. Why?\n24. Stars form in the Milky Way at a rate of about 1 solar mass per year. At this rate, how long would it take for\nall the interstellar gas in the Milky Way to be turned into stars if there were no fresh gas coming in from\noutside? How does this compare to the estimated age of the universe, 14 billion years? What do you\nconclude from this?\nAccess for free at openstax.org 20 \u2022 Exercises 677\n25. The 21-cm line can be used not just to find out where hydrogen is located in the sky, but also to determine\nhow fast it is moving toward or away from us. Describe how this might work.\n26. Astronomers recently detected light emitted by a supernova that was originally observed in 1572, just\nreaching Earth now. This light was reflected off a dust cloud; astronomers call such a reflected light a\n\u201clight echo\u201d (just like reflected sound is called an echo). How would you expect the spectrum of the light\necho to compare to that of the original supernova?\n27. We can detect 21-cm emission from other galaxies as well as from our own Galaxy. However, 21-cm\nemission from our own Galaxy fills most of the sky, so we usually see both at once. How can we\ndistinguish the extragalactic 21-cm emission from that arising in our own Galaxy? (Hint: Other galaxies are\ngenerally moving relative to the Milky Way.)\n28. We have said repeatedly that blue light undergoes more extinction than red light, which is true for visible\nand shorter wavelengths. Is the same true for X-rays? Look atFigure 20.19. The most dust is in the galactic\nplane in the middle of the image, and the red color in the image corresponds to the reddest (lowest-\nenergy) light. Based on what you see in the galactic plane, are X-rays experiencing more extinction at\nredder or bluer colors? You might consider comparingFigure 20.19toFigure 20.14.\n29. Suppose that, instead of being inside the Local Bubble, the Sun were deep inside a giant molecular cloud.\nWhat would the night sky look like as seen from Earth at various wavelengths?\n30. Suppose that, instead of being inside the Local Bubble, the Sun were inside an H II region. What would the\nnight sky look like at various wavelengths?\nFiguring for Yourself\n31. A molecular cloud is about 1000 times denser than the average of the interstellar medium. Let\u2019s compare\nthis difference in densities to something more familiar. Air has a density of about 1 kg/m3, so something\n1000 times denser than air would have a density of about 1000 kg/m3. How does this compare to the\ntypical density of water? Of granite? (You can find figures for these densities on the internet.) Is the\ndensity difference between a molecular cloud and the interstellar medium larger or smaller than the\ndensity difference between air and water or granite?\n32. Would you expect to be able to detect an H II region in X-ray emission? Why or why not? (Hint: You might\napply Wien\u2019s law)\n33. Suppose that you gathered a ball of interstellar gas that was equal to the size of Earth (a radius of about\n6000 km). If this gas has a density of 1 hydrogen atom per cm3, typical of the interstellar medium, how\nwould its mass compare to the mass of a bowling ball (5 or 6 kg)? How about if it had the typical density of\nthe Local Bubble, about 0.01 atoms per cm3? The volume of a sphere isV= (4/3)\u03c0R3.\n34. At the average density of the interstellar medium, 1 atom per cm3, how big a volume of material must be\nused to make a star with the mass of the Sun? What is the radius of a sphere this size? Express your\nanswer in light-years.\n35. Consider a grain of sand that contains 1 mg of oxygen (a typical amount for a medium-sized sand grain,\nsince sand is mostly SiO ). How many oxygen atoms does the grain contain? What is the radius of the\n2\nsphere you would have to spread them out over if you wanted them to have the same density as the\ninterstellar medium, about 1 atom per cm3? You can look up the mass of an oxygen atom.\n36. H II regions can exist only if there is a nearby star hot enough to ionize hydrogen. Hydrogen is ionized\nonly by radiation with wavelengths shorter than 91.2 nm. What is the temperature of a star that emits its\nmaximum energy at 91.2 nm? (Use Wien\u2019s law fromRadiation and Spectra.) Based on this result, what are\nthe spectral types of those stars likely to provide enough energy to produce H II regions? 678 20 \u2022 Exercises\n37. In the text, we said that the five-times ionized oxygen (OVI) seen in hot gas must have been produced by\nsupernova shocks that heated the gas to millions of degrees, and not by starlight, the way H II is\nproduced. Producing OVI by light requires wavelengths shorter than 10.9 nm. The hottest observed stars\nhave surface temperatures of about 50,000 K. Could they produce OVI?\n38. Dust was originally discovered because the stars in certain clusters seemed to be fainter than expected.\nSuppose a star is behind a cloud of dust that dims its brightness by a factor of 100. Suppose you do not\nrealize the dust is there. How much in error will your distance estimate be? Can you think of any\nmeasurement you might make to detect the dust?\n39. How would the density inside a cold cloud (T= 10 K) compare with the density of the ultra-hot interstellar\ngas (T= 106K) if they were in pressure equilibrium? (It takes a large cloud to be able to shield its interior\nfrom heating so that it can be at such a low temperature.)

Which\nregion do you think is more suitable for the creation of new stars? Why?\n40. The text says that the Local Fluff, which surrounds the Sun, has a temperature of 7500 K and a density 0.1\natom per cm3. The Local Fluff is embedded in hot gas with a temperature of 106K and a density of about\n0.01 atom per cm3. Are they in equilibrium?

We see only the suns because they are the largest bodies and are luminous, but their\nplanets remain invisible to us because they are smaller and non-luminous. . . . The unnumbered worlds in the\nuniverse are all similar in form and rank and subject to the same forces and the same laws.\n>\u2014Giordano Bruno inOn the Infinite Universe and Worlds(1584)\nBruno was tried for heresy by the Roman Inquisition and burned at the stake in 1600.\nWe\u2019ve discussed stars as nuclear furnaces that convert light elements into heavier ones. A star\u2019s nuclear\nevolution begins when hydrogen is fused into helium, but that can only occur when the core temperature\nexceeds 10 to 12 million K. Since stars form from cold interstellar material, we must understand how they\ncollapse and eventually reach this \u201cignition temperature\u201d to explain the birth of stars. Star formation is a\ncontinuous process, from the birth of our Galaxy right up to today. We estimate that every year in our Galaxy,\non average, three solar masses of interstellar matter are converted into stars. This may sound like a small\namount of mass for an object as large as a galaxy, but only three new stars (out of billions in theGalaxy) are\nformed each year.\nDo planets orbit other stars or is ours the only planetary system? In the past few decades, new technology has 680 21 \u2022 The Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar System\nenabled us to answer that question by revealing nearly 4300 exoplanets in over 3200 planetary systems. Even\nbefore planets were detected, astronomers had predicted that planetary systems were likely to be byproducts\nof the star-formation process. In this chapter, we look at how interstellar matter is transformed into stars and\nplanets.\n21.1 Star Formation\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nIdentify the sometimes-violent processes by which parts of a molecular cloud collapse to produce stars\nRecognize some of the structures seen in images ofmolecular cloudslike the one in Orion\nExplain how the environment of a molecular cloud enables the formation of stars\nDescribe how advancing waves of star formation cause a molecular cloud to evolve\nAs we begin our exploration of how stars are formed, let\u2019s review some basics about stars discussed in earlier\nchapters:\n\u2022 Stable (main-sequence) stars such as our Sun maintain equilibrium by producing energy through nuclear\nfusion in their cores. The ability to generate energy by fusion defines a star.\n\u2022 Each second in the Sun, approximately 600 million tons of hydrogen undergo fusion into helium, with\nabout 4 million tons turning into energy in the process. This rate of hydrogen use means that eventually\nthe Sun (and all other stars) will run out of central fuel.\n\u2022 Stars come with many different masses, ranging from 1/12 solar masses (M ) to roughly 100\u2013200M .\nSun Sun\nThere are far more low-mass than high-mass stars.\n\u2022 The most massive main-sequence stars (spectral type O) are also the most luminous and have the highest\nsurface temperature. The lowest-mass stars on the main sequence (spectral type M or L) are the least\nluminous and the coolest.\n\u2022 A galaxy of stars such as the Milky Way contains enormous amounts of gas and dust\u2014enough to make\nbillions of stars like the Sun.\nIf we want to find stars still in the process of formation, we must look in places that have plenty of the raw\nmaterial from which stars are assembled. Since stars are made of gas, we focus our attention (and our\ntelescopes) on the dense and cold clouds of gas and dust that dot the Milky Way (seeFigure 21.1andFigure\n21.2).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21.1 \u2022 Star Formation 681\nFigure21.2Pillars of Dust and Dense Globules in M16.(a) This Hubble Space Telescope image of the central regions of M16 (also\nknown as theEagle Nebula) shows huge columns of cool gas, (including molecular hydrogen, H2) and dust. These columns are of\nhigher density than the surrounding regions and have resisted evaporation by the ultraviolet radiation from a cluster of hot stars\njust beyond the upper-right corner of this image. The tallest pillar is about 1 light-year long, and the M16 region is about 7000 light-\nyears away from us. (b) This close-up view of one of the pillars shows some very dense globules, many of which harbor embryonic\nstars. Astronomers coined the termevaporating gas globules(EGGs) for these structures, in part so that they could say we found\nEGGs inside the Eagle Nebula. It is possible that because these EGGs are exposed to the relentless action of the radiation from\nnearby hot stars, some may not yet have collected enough material to form a star.

Scowen (Arizona State\nUniversity))\nMolecular Clouds: Stellar Nurseries\nAs we saw inBetween the Stars: Gas and Dust in Space, the most massive reservoirs of interstellar\nmatter\u2014and some of the most massive objects in the Milky Way Galaxy\u2014are thegiant molecular clouds.\nThese clouds have cold interiors with characteristic temperatures of only 10\u201320 K; most of their gas atoms are\nbound into molecules. These clouds turn out to be the birthplaces of most stars in our Galaxy.\nThe masses of molecular clouds range from a thousand times the mass of the Sun to about 3 million solar\nmasses. Molecular clouds have a complex filamentary structure, similar to cirrus clouds in Earth\u2019s atmosphere,\nbut much less dense. The molecular cloud filaments can be up to 1000 light-years long. Within the clouds are\ncold, dense regions with typical masses of 50 to 500 times the mass of the Sun; we give these regions the\nhighly technical nameclumps. Within these clumps, there are even denser, smaller regions called cores. The\ncores are the embryos of stars. The conditions in these cores\u2014low temperature and high density\u2014are just\nwhat is required to make stars. Remember that the essence of the life story of any star is the ongoing\ncompetition between two forces:gravityandpressure. The force of gravity, pulling inward, tries to make a star\ncollapse. Internal pressure produced by the motions of the gas atoms, pushing outward, tries to force the star\nto expand. When a star is first forming, low temperature (and hence, low pressure) and high density (hence,\ngreater gravitational attraction) both work to give gravity the advantage. In order to form a star\u2014that is, a\ndense, hot ball of matter capable of starting nuclear reactions deep within\u2014we need a typical core of\ninterstellar atoms and molecules to shrink in radius and increase in density by a factor of nearly 1020. It is the\nforce of gravity that produces this drastic collapse.\nThe Orion Molecular Cloud\nLet\u2019s discuss what happens in regions of star formation by considering a nearby site where stars are forming\nright now. One of the best-studied stellar nurseries is in the constellation of Orion, The Hunter, about 1500 682 21 \u2022 The Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar System\nlight-years away (Figure 21.3). The pattern of the hunter is easy to recognize by the conspicuous \u201cbelt\u201d of\nthree stars that mark his waist. The Orion molecular cloud is much larger than the star pattern and is truly an\nimpressive structure. In its long dimension, it stretches over a distance of about 100 light-years. The total\nquantity of molecular gas is about 200,000 times the mass of the Sun. Most of the cloud does not glow with\nvisible light but betrays its presence by the radiation that the dusty gas gives off at infrared and radio\nwavelengths.\nFigure21.3Orion in Visible and Infrared.(a) The Orion star group was named after the legendary hunter in Greek mythology.\nThree stars close together in a link mark Orion\u2019s belt. The ancients imagined a sword hanging from the belt; the object at the end of\nthe blue line in this sword is theOrion Nebula. (b) This wide-angle, infrared view of the same area was taken with the Infrared\nAstronomical Satellite. Heated dust clouds dominate in this false-color image, and many of the stars that stood out on part (a) are\nnow invisible. An exception is the cool, red-giant starBetelgeuse, which can be seen as a yellowish point at the left vertex of the blue\ntriangle (at Orion\u2019s left armpit). The large, yellow ring to the right of Betelgeuse is the remnant of an exploded star. The infrared\nimage lets us see how large and full of cooler material the Orion molecular cloud really is. On the visible-light image at left, you see\nonly two colorful regions of interstellar matter\u2014the two, bright yellow splotches at the left end of and below Orion\u2019s belt. The lower\none is the Orion Nebula and the higher one is the region of the Horsehead Nebula. (credit: modification of work by NASA, visible\nlight: Akira Fujii; infrared: Infrared Astronomical Satellite)\nThe stars in Orion\u2019s belt are typically about 5 million years old, whereas the stars near the middle of the\n\u201csword\u201d hanging from Orion\u2019s belt are only 300,000 to 1 million years old. The region about halfway down the\nsword where star formation is still taking place is called the Orion Nebula. About 2200 young stars are found in\nthis region, which is only slightly larger than a dozen light-years in diameter. The Orion Nebula also contains a\ntight cluster of stars called the Trapezium (Figure 21.5). The brightest Trapezium stars can be seen easily with a\nsmall telescope.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21.1 \u2022 Star Formation 683\nFigure21.4Orion Nebula.(a) TheOrion Nebulais shown in visible light.

(credit a: modification of work by Filip\nLoli\u0107; credit b: modification of work by NASA/JPL-Caltech/T. Megeath (University of Toledo, Ohio))\nCompare this with our own solar neighborhood, where the typical spacing between stars is about 3 light-years.\nOnly a small number of stars in the Orion cluster can be seen with visible light, but infrared images\u2014which\npenetrate the dust better\u2014detect the more than 2000 stars that are part of the group (Figure 21.5).\nFigure21.5Central Region of the Orion Nebula.The Orion Nebula harbors some of the youngest stars in the solar neighborhood.\nAt the heart of the nebula is the Trapezium cluster, which includes four very bright stars that provide much of the energy that causes\nthe nebula to glow so brightly. In these images, we see a section of the nebula in (a) visible light and (b) infrared. The four bright\nstars in the center of the visible-light image are the Trapezium stars. Notice that most of the stars seen in the infrared are completely\nhidden by dust in the visible-light image. (credit a: modification of work by NASA, C.R. O\u2019Dell and S.K. Wong (Rice University); credit b:\nmodification of work by NASA; K.L. Luhman (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics); and G. Schneider, E. Young, G. Rieke, A.\nCotera, H. Chen, M. Rieke, R. Thompson (Steward Observatory, University of Arizona))\nStudies of Orion and other star-forming regions show that star formation is not a very efficient process. In the\nregion of the Orion Nebula, about 1% of the material in the cloud has been turned into stars. That is why we\nstill see a substantial amount of gas and dust near the Trapezium stars. The leftover material is eventually\nheated, either by the radiation and winds from the hot stars that form or by explosions of the most massive\nstars. (We will see in later chapters that the most massive stars go through their lives very quickly and end by\nexploding.) 684 21 \u2022 The Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar System\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTake ajourney through the Orion Nebula(https://openstax.org/l/30OriNebula)to view a nice narrated\nvideo tour of this region.\nWhether gently or explosively, the material in the neighborhood of the new stars is blown away into\ninterstellar space. Older groups or clusters of stars can now be easily observed in visible light because they are\nno longer shrouded in dust and gas (Figure 21.6).\nFigure21.6Westerlund 2.This young cluster of stars known as Westerlund 2 formed within the Carina star-forming region about 2\nmillion years ago. Stellar winds and pressure produced by the radiation from the hot stars within the cluster are blowing and\nsculpting the surrounding gas and dust. The nebula still contains many globules of dust. Stars are continuing to form within the\ndenser globules and pillars of the nebula. This Hubble Space Telescope image includes near-infrared exposures of the star cluster\nand visible-light observations of the surrounding nebula. Colors in the nebula are dominated by the red glow of hydrogen gas, and\nblue-green emissions from glowing oxygen. (credit: NASA, ESA, the Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA), A. Nota (ESA/STScI), and the\nWesterlund 2 Science Team)\nAlthough we do not know what initially caused stars to begin forming in Orion, there is good evidence that the\nfirst generation of stars triggered the formation of additional stars, which in turn led to the formation of still\nmore stars (Figure 21.7).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21.1 \u2022 Star Formation 685\nFigure21.7Propagating Star Formation.Star formation can move progressively through a molecular cloud. The oldest group of\nstars lies to the left of the diagram and has expanded because of the motions of individual stars. Eventually, the stars in the group\nwill disperse and no longer be recognizable as a cluster. The youngest group of stars lies to the right, next to the molecular cloud.\nThis group of stars is only 1 to 2 million years old. The pressure of the hot, ionized gas surrounding these stars compresses the\nmaterial in the nearby edge of the molecular cloud and initiates the gravitational collapse that will lead to the formation of more\nstars.\nThe basic idea of triggeredstar formationis this: when a massive star is formed, it emits a large amount of\nultraviolet radiation and ejects high-speed gas in the form of a stellar wind. This injection of energy heats the\ngas around the stars and causes it to expand. When massive stars exhaust their supply of fuel, they explode,\nand the energy of the explosion also heats the gas. The hot gases pile into the surrounding cold molecular\ncloud, compressing the material in it and increasing its density. If this increase in density is large enough,\ngravity will overcome pressure, and stars will begin to form in the compressed gas. Such a chain\nreaction\u2014where the brightest and hottest stars of one area become the cause of star formation \u201cnext\ndoor\u201d\u2014seems to have occurred not only in Orion but also in many other molecular clouds.\nThere are many molecular clouds that form only (or mainly) low-mass stars. Because low-mass stars do not\nhave strong winds and do not die by exploding, triggered star formation cannot occur in these clouds. There\nare also stars that form in relative isolation in small cores. Therefore, not all star formation is originally\ntriggered by the death of massive stars. However, there are likely to be other possible triggers, such as spiral\ndensity waves and other processes we do not yet understand.\nThe Birth of a Star\nAlthough regions such as Orion give us clues about how star formation begins, the subsequent stages are still\nshrouded in mystery (and a lot of dust). There is an enormous difference between the density of a molecular\ncloud core and the density of the youngest stars that can be detected. Direct observations of this collapse to\nhigher density are nearly impossible for two reasons. First, the dust-shrouded interiors of molecular clouds\nwhere stellar births take place cannot be observed with visible light. Second, the timescale for the initial\ncollapse\u2014thousands of years\u2014is very short, astronomically speaking. Since each star spends such a tiny\nfraction of its life in this stage, relatively few stars are going through the collapse process at any given time.\nNevertheless, through a combination of theoretical calculations and the limited observations available,\nastronomers have pieced together a picture of what the earliest stages of stellar evolution are likely to be.\nThe first step in the process of creating stars is the formation of dense cores within a clump of gas and dust\n(Figure 21.8(a)). It is generally thought that all the material for the star comes from the core, the larger\nstructure surrounding the forming star. Eventually, the gravitational force of the infalling gas becomes strong\nenough to overwhelm the pressure exerted by the cold material that forms the dense cores. The material then\nundergoes a rapid collapse, and the density of the core increases greatly as a result. During the time a dense\ncore is contracting to become a true star, but before the fusion of protons to produce helium begins, we call\nthe object aprotostar. 686 21 \u2022 The Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar System\nFigure21.8Formation of a Star.(a) Dense cores form within a molecular cloud. (b) A protostar with a surrounding disk of material\nforms at the center of a dense core, accumulating additional material from the molecular cloud through gravitational attraction. (c) A\nstellar wind breaks out but is confined by the disk to flow out along the two poles of the star. (d) Eventually, this wind sweeps away\nthe cloud material and halts the accumulation of additional material, and a newly formed star, surrounded by a disk, becomes\nobservable. These sketches are not drawn to the same scale. The diameter of a typical envelope that is supplying gas to the newly\nforming star is about 5000 AU. The typical diameter of the disk is about 100 AU or slightly larger than the diameter of the orbit of\nPluto.\nThe natural turbulence inside a clump tends to give any portion of it some initial spinning motion (even if it is\nvery slow). As a result, each collapsing core is expected to spin. According to the law of conservation of angular\nmomentum (discussed in the chapter onOrbits and Gravity), a rotating body spins more rapidly as it\ndecreases in size. In other words, if the object can turn its material around a smaller circle, it can move that\nmaterial more quickly\u2014like a figure skater spinning more rapidly as she brings her arms in tight to her body.\nThis is exactly what happens when a core contracts to form a protostar: as it shrinks, its rate of spin increases.\nBut all directions on a spinning sphere are not created equal. As the protostar rotates, it is much easier for\nmaterial to fall right onto the poles (which spin most slowly) than onto the equator (where material moves\naround most rapidly). Therefore, gas and dust falling in toward the protostar\u2019s equator are \u201cheld back\u201d by the\nrotation and form a whirling extended disk around the equator (part b inFigure 21.8). You may have observed\nthis same \u201cequator effect\u201d on the amusement park ride in which you stand with your back to a cylinder that is\nspun faster and faster. As you spin really fast, you are pushed against the wall so strongly that you cannot\npossibly fall toward the center of the cylinder. Gas can, however, fall onto the protostar easily from directions\naway from the star\u2019s equator.\nThe protostar and disk at this stage are embedded in an envelope of dust and gas from which material is still\nfalling onto the protostar. This dusty envelope blocks visible light, but infrared radiation can get through. As a\nresult, in this phase of its evolution, the protostar itself is emitting infrared radiation and so is observable only\nin the infrared region of the spectrum. Once almost all of the available material has been accreted and the\ncentral protostar has reached nearly its final mass, it is given a special name: it is called aT Tauri star, named\nafter one of the best studied and brightest members of this class of stars, which was discovered in the\nconstellation of Taurus. (Astronomers have a tendency to name types of stars after the first example they\ndiscover or come to understand. It\u2019s not an elegant system, but it works.) Only stars with masses less than or\nsimilar to the mass of the Sun becomeT Tauri stars. Massive stars do not go through this stage, although they\ndo appear to follow the formation scenario illustrated inFigure 21.8.\nWinds and Jets\nRecent observations suggest that T Tauri stars may actually be stars in a middle stage between protostars and\nhydrogen-fusing stars such as the Sun. High-resolution infrared images have revealed jets of material as well\nasstellar windscoming from some T Tauri stars, proof of interaction with their environment. Astellar wind\nconsists mainly of protons (hydrogen nuclei) and electrons streaming away from the star at speeds of a few\nhundred kilometers per second (several hundred thousand miles per hour). When the wind first starts up, the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21.1 \u2022 Star Formation 687\ndisk of material around the star\u2019s equator blocks the wind in its direction. Where the wind particlescanescape\nmost effectively is in the direction of the star\u2019s poles.\nAstronomers have actually seen evidence of these beams of particles shooting out in opposite directions from\nthe polar regions of newly formed stars. In many cases, these beams point back to the location of a protostar\nthat is still so completely shrouded in dust that we cannot yet see it (Figure 21.9).\nFigure21.9Gas Jets Flowing away from a Protostar.Here we see the neighborhood of a protostar, known to us as HH 34 because\nit is a Herbig-Haro object. The star is about 450 light-years away and only about 1 million years old. Light from the star itself is\nblocked by a disk, which is larger than 60 billion kilometers in diameter and is seen almost edge-on. Jets are seen emerging\nperpendicular to the disk. The material in these jets is flowing outward at speeds up to 580,000 kilometers per hour. The series of\nthree images shows changes during a period of 5 years. Every few months, a compact clump of gas is ejected, and its motion\noutward can be followed. The changes in the brightness of the disk may be due to motions of clouds within the disk that alternately\nblock some of the light and then let it through. This image corresponds to the stage in the life of a protostar shown in part (c) of\nFigure 21.8. (credit: modification of work by Hubble Space Telescope, NASA, ESA)\nOn occasion, the jets of high-speed particles streaming away from the protostar collide with a somewhat-\ndenser lump of gas nearby, excite its atoms, and cause them to emit light. These glowing regions, each of\nwhich is known as aHerbig-Haro (HH) objectafter the two astronomers who first identified them, allow us to\ntrace the progress of the jet to a distance of a light-year or more from the star that produced it.Figure 21.10\nshows two spectacular images of HH objects. 688 21 \u2022 The Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar System\nFigure21.10Outflows from Protostars.These images were taken with the Hubble Space Telescope and show jets flowing outward\nfrom newly formed stars. In the HH47 image, a protostar 1500 light-years away (invisible inside a dust disk at the left edge of the\nimage) produces a very complicated jet. The star may actually be wobbling, perhaps because it has a companion. Light from the star\nilluminates the white region at the left because light can emerge perpendicular to the disk (just as the jet does). At right, the jet is\nplowing into existing clumps of interstellar gas, producing a shock wave that resembles an arrowhead.

Padgett (IPAC/\nCaltech), W. Brandner (IPAC), K. Stapelfeldt (JPL) and NASA)\nThis description of a protostar surrounded by a rotating disk of gas and dust sounds very much like what\nhappened in our solar system when the Sun and planets formed. Indeed, one of the most important\ndiscoveries from the study of star formation in the last decade of the twentieth century was that disks are an\ninevitable byproduct of the process of creating stars. The next questions that astronomers set out to answer\nwas: will the disks around protostars also form planets? And if so, how often? We will return to these questions\nlater in this chapter.\nTo keep things simple, we have described the formation of single stars. Many stars, however, are members of\nbinary or triple systems, where several stars are born together. In this case, the stars form in nearly the same\nway. Widely separated binaries may each have their own disk; close binaries may share a single disk.\n21.2 The H\u2013R Diagram and the Study of Stellar Evolution\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDetermine the age of a protostar using anH\u2013R diagramand the protostar\u2019s luminosity and temperature\nExplain the interplay between gravity and pressure, and how the contracting protostar changes its\nposition in the H\u2013R diagram as a result\nOne of the best ways to summarize all of these details about how a star or protostar changes with time is to\nuse a Hertzsprung-Russell (H\u2013R) diagram. Recall fromThe Stars: A Celestial Censusthat, when looking at an\nH\u2013R diagram, the temperature (the horizontal axis) is plotted increasing toward the left. As a star goes\nthrough the stages of its life, its luminosity and temperature change. Thus, its position on the H\u2013R diagram, in\nwhich luminosity is plotted against temperature, also changes. As a star ages, we must replot it in different\nplaces on the diagram. Therefore, astronomers often speak of a starmovingon the H\u2013R diagram, or of its\nevolution tracing out a path on the diagram. In this context, \u201ctracing out a path\u201d has nothing to do with the\nstar\u2019s motion through space; this is just a shorthand way of saying that its temperature and luminosity change\nas it evolves. 690 21 \u2022 The Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar System\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch ananimation(https://openstax.org/l/30aniomelen)of the stars in the Omega Centauri cluster as\nthey rearrange according to luminosity and temperature, forming a Hertzsprung-Russell (H\u2013R) diagram.\nTo estimate just how much the luminosity and temperature of a star change as it ages, we must resort to\ncalculations. Theorists compute a series of models for a star, with each successive model representing a later\npoint in time. Stars may change for a variety of reasons. Protostars, for example, change in size because they\nare contracting, and their temperature and luminosity change as they do so. After nuclear fusion begins in the\nstar\u2019s core (seeStars from Adolescence to Old Age), main-sequence stars change because they are using up\ntheir nuclear fuel.\nGiven a model that represents a star at one stage of its evolution, we can calculate what it will be like at a\nslightly later time. At each step, the model predicts the luminosity and size of the star, and from these values,\nwe can figure out its surface temperature. A series of points on an H\u2013R diagram, calculated in this way, allows\nus to follow the life changes of a star and hence is called itsevolutionary track.\nEvolutionary Tracks\nLet\u2019s now use these ideas to follow the evolution of protostars that are on their way to becoming main-\nsequence stars. The evolutionary tracks of newly forming stars with a range of stellar masses are shown in\nFigure 21.12. These young stellar objects are not yet producing energy by nuclear reactions, but they derive\nenergy from gravitational contraction\u2014through the sort of process proposed for the Sun by Helmhotz and\nKelvin in this last century (see the chapter onThe Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse).\nFigure21.12Evolutionary Tracks for Contracting Protostars.Tracks are plotted on the H\u2013R diagram to show how stars of\ndifferent masses change during the early parts of their lives. The number next to each dark point on a track is the rough number of\nyears it takes an embryo star to reach that stage (the numbers are the result of computer models and are therefore not well known).\nNote that the surface temperature (K) on the horizontal axis increases toward the left. You can see that the more mass a star has, the\nshorter time it takes to go through each stage. Stars above the dashed line are typically still surrounded by infalling material and are\nhidden by it.\nInitially, a protostar remains fairly cool with a very large radius and a very low density. It is transparent to\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21.2 \u2022 The H\u2013R Diagram and the Study of Stellar Evolution 691\ninfrared radiation, and the heat generated by gravitational contraction can be radiated away freely into space.\nBecause heat builds up slowly inside the protostar, the gas pressure remains low, and the outer layers fall\nalmost unhindered toward the center. Thus, the protostar undergoes very rapid collapse, a stage that\ncorresponds to the roughly vertical lines at the right ofFigure 21.12. As the star shrinks, its surface area gets\nsmaller, and so its total luminosity decreases. The rapid contraction stops only when the protostar becomes\ndense and opaque enough to trap the heat released by gravitational contraction.\nWhen the star begins to retain its heat, the contraction becomes much slower, and changes inside the\ncontracting star keep the luminosity of stars like our Sun roughly constant. The surface temperatures start to\nbuild up, and the star \u201cmoves\u201d to the left in the H\u2013R diagram. Stars first become visible only after the stellar\nwind described earlier clears away the surrounding dust and gas. This can happen during the rapid-\ncontraction phase for low-mass stars, but high-mass stars remain shrouded in dust until they end their early\nphase of gravitational contraction (see the dashed line inFigure 21.12).\nTo help you keep track of the various stages that stars go through in their lives, it can be useful to compare the\ndevelopment of a star to that of a human being. (Clearly, you will not find an exact correspondence, but\nthinking through the stages in human terms may help you remember some of the ideas we are trying to\nemphasize.) Protostars might be compared to human embryos\u2014as yet unable to sustain themselves but\ndrawing resources from their environment as they grow. Just as the birth of a child is the moment it is called\nupon to produce its own energy (through eating and breathing), so astronomers say that a star is born when it\nis able to sustain itself through nuclear reactions (by making its own energy.)\nWhen the star\u2019s central temperature becomes high enough (about 12 million K) to fuse hydrogen into helium,\nwe say that the star has reached the main sequence (a concept introduced inThe Stars: A Celestial Census). It\nis now a full-fledged star, more or less in equilibrium, and its rate of change slows dramatically. Only the\ngradual depletion of hydrogen as it is transformed into helium in the core slowly changes the star\u2019s properties.\nThe mass of a star determines exactly where it falls on the main sequence. AsFigure 21.12shows, massive\nstars on the main sequence have high temperatures and high luminosities. Low-mass stars have low\ntemperatures and low luminosities.\nObjects of extremely low mass never achieve high-enough central temperatures to ignite nuclear reactions.\nThe lower end of the main sequence stops where stars have a mass just barely great enough to sustain\nnuclear reactions at a sufficient rate to stop gravitational contraction. This critical mass is calculated to be\nabout 0.075 times the mass of the Sun. As we discussed in the chapter onAnalyzing Starlight, objects below\nthis critical mass are called either brown dwarfs or planets. At the other extreme, the upper end of the main\nsequence terminates at the point where the energy radiated by the newly forming massive star becomes so\ngreat that it halts the accretion of additional matter. The upper limit of stellar mass is between 100 and 200\nsolar masses.\nEvolutionary Timescales\nHow long it takes a star to form depends on its mass. The numbers that label the points on each track in\nFigure 21.12are the times, in years, required for the embryo stars to reach the stages we have been\ndiscussing. Stars of masses much higher than the Sun\u2019s reach the main sequence in a few thousand to a\nmillion years. The Sun required millions of years before it was born. Tens of millions of years are required for\nstars of lower mass to evolve to the lower main sequence. (We will see that this turns out to be a general\nprinciple: massive stars go throughallstages of evolution faster than low-mass stars do.)\nWe will take up the subsequent stages in the life of a star inStars from Adolescence to Old Age, examining\nwhat happens after stars arrive in the main sequence and begin a \u201cprolonged adolescence\u201d and \u201cadulthood\u201d\nof fusing hydrogen to form helium. But now we want to examine the connection between the formation of\nstars and planets. 692 21 \u2022 The Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar System\n21.3 Evidence That Planets Form around Other Stars\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nTrace the evolution of dust surrounding a protostar, leading to the development of rocky planets and gas\ngiants\nEstimate the timescale for growth of planets using observations of the disks surrounding young stars\nEvaluate evidence for planets around forming stars based on the structures seen in images of the\ncircumstellar dust disks\nHaving developed on a planet and finding it essential to our existence, we have a special interest in how\nplanets fit into the story of star formation. Yet planets outside the solar system are extremely difficult to\ndetect. Recall that we see planets in our own system only because they reflect sunlight and are close by. When\nwe look to the other stars, we find that the amount of light a planet reflects is a depressingly tiny fraction of\nthe light its star gives off. Furthermore, from a distance, planets are lost in the glare of their much-brighter\nparent stars.\nDisks around Protostars: Planetary Systems in Formation\nIt is a lot easier to detect the spread-out raw material from which planets might be assembled than to detect\nplanets after they are fully formed. From our study of the solar system, we understand that planets form by\nthe gathering together of gas and dust particles in orbit around a newly created star. Each dust particle is\nheated by the young protostar and radiates in the infrared region of the spectrum. Before any planets form,\nwe can detect such radiation from all of the spread-out individual dust particles that are destined to become\nparts of planets. We can also detect the silhouette of the disk if it blocks bright light coming from a source\nbehind it (Figure 21.13).\nFigure21.13Disks around Protostars.These Hubble Space Telescope images show four disks around young stars in the Orion\nNebula. The dark, dusty disks are seen silhouetted against the bright backdrop of the glowing gas in the nebula. The size of each\nimage is about 30 times the diameter of our planetary system; this means the disks we see here range in size from two to eight\ntimes the orbit of Pluto. The red glow at the center of each disk is a young star, no more than a million years old. These images\ncorrespond to the stage in the life of a protostar shown in part (d) ofFigure 21.8. (credit: modification of work by Mark McCaughrean\n(Max-Planck-Institute for Astronomy), C. Robert O\u2019Dell (Rice University), and NASA)\nOnce the dust particles gather together and form a few planets (and maybe some moons), the overwhelming\nmajority of the dust is hidden in the interiors of the planets where we cannot see it. All we can now detect is\nthe radiation from the outside surfaces, which cover a drastically smaller area than the huge, dusty disk from\nwhich they formed. The amount of infrared radiation is therefore greatest before the dust particles combine\ninto planets. For this reason, our search for planets begins with a search for infrared radiation from the\nmaterial required to make them.\nA disk of gas and dust appears to be an essential part of star formation. Observations show that nearly all very\nyoung protostars have disks and that the disks range in size from 10 to 1000 AU. (For comparison, the average\ndiameter of the orbit of Pluto, which can be considered the rough size of our own planetary system, is 80 AU,\nwhereas the outer diameter of the Kuiper belt of smaller icy bodies is about 100 AU.) The mass contained in\nthese disks is typically 1\u201310% of the mass of our own Sun, which is more than the mass of all the planets in our\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21.3 \u2022 Evidence That Planets Form around Other Stars 693\nsolar system put together. Such observations already demonstrate that a large fraction of stars begin their\nlives with enough material in the right place to form a planetary system.\nThe Timing of Planet Formation and Growth\nWe can use observations of how the disks change with time to estimate how long it takes for planets to form.\nIf we measure the temperature and luminosity of a protostar, then, as we saw, we can place it in an H\u2013R\ndiagram like the one shown inFigure 21.12. By comparing the real star with our models of how protostars\nshould evolve with time, we can estimate its age. We can then look at how the disks we observe change with\nthe ages of the stars that they surround.\nWhat such observations show is that if a protostar is less than about 1 to 3 million years old, its disk extends all\nthe way from very close to the surface of the star out to tens or hundreds of AU away. In older protostars, we\nfind disks with outer parts that still contain large amounts of dust, but the inner regions have lost most of their\ndust. In these objects, the disk looks like a donut, with the protostar centered in its hole. The inner, dense parts\nof most disks have disappeared by the time the stars are 10 million years old (Figure 21.14).\nFigure21.14Protoplanetary Disks around Two Stars.The left view of each star shows infrared observations by the Hubble Space\nTelescope of their protoplanetary disks. The central star is much brighter than the surrounding disk, so the instrument includes a\ncoronagraph, which has a small shield that blocks the light of the central star but allows the surrounding disk to be imaged. The\nright image of each star shows models of the disks based on the observations. The star HD 141943 has an age of about 17 million\nyears, while HD 191089 is about 12 million years old. (credit: modification of work by NASA, ESA, R. Soummer and M. Perrin (STScI), L.\nPueyo (STScI/Johns Hopkins University), C. Chen and D. Golimowski (STScI), J.B. Hagan (STScI/Purdue University), T. Mittal (University\nof California, Berkeley/Johns Hopkins University), E. Choquet, M. Moerchen, and M. N\u2019Diaye (STScI), A. Rajan (Arizona State\nUniversity), S. Wolff (STScI/Purdue University), J. Debes and D. Hines (STScI), and G. Schneider (Steward Observatory/University of\nArizona))\nCalculations show that the formation of one or more planets could produce such a donut-like distribution of\ndust. Suppose a planet forms a few AU away from the protostar, presumably due to the gathering together of\nmatter from the disk. As the planet grows in mass, the process clears out a dust-free region in its immediate\nneighborhood. Calculations also show that any small dust particles and gas that were initially located in the\nregion between the protostar and the planet, and that are not swept up by the planet, will then fall onto the\nstar very quickly in about 50,000 years.\nMatter lying outside the planet\u2019s orbit, in contrast, is prevented from moving into the hole by the gravitational\nforces exerted by the planet. (We saw something similar in Saturn\u2019s rings, where the action of the shepherd\nmoons keeps the material near the edge of the rings from spreading out.) If the formation of a planet is\nindeed what produces and sustains holes in the disks that surround very young stars, then planets must form\nin 3 to 30 million years. This is a short period compared with the lifetimes of most stars and shows that the\nformation of planets may be a quick byproduct of the birth of stars.\nCalculations show thataccretioncan drive the rapid growth of planets\u2014small, dust-grain-size particles\norbiting in the disk collide and stick together, with the larger collections growing more rapidly as they attract\nand capture smaller ones. Once these clumps grow to about 10 centimeters in size or so, they enter a perilous\nstage in their development. At that size, unless they can grow to larger than about 100 meters in diameter,\nthey are subject to drag forces produced by friction with the gas in the disk\u2014and their orbits can rapidly 694 21 \u2022 The Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar System\ndecay, plunging them into the host star. Therefore, these bodies must rapidly grow to nearly 1 kilometer in\nsize in diameter to avoid a fiery fate. At this stage, they are considered planetesimals (the small chunks of solid\nmatter\u2014ice and dust particles\u2014that you learned about inOther Worlds: An Introduction to the Solar System).\nOnce they survive to those sizes, the largest survivors will continue to grow by accreting smaller planetesimals;\nultimately, this process results in a few large planets.\nIf the growing planets reach a mass bigger than about 10 times the mass of Earth, their gravity is strong\nenough to capture and hold on to hydrogen gas that remains in the disk. At that point, they will grow in mass\nand radius rapidly, reaching giant planet dimensions. However, to do so requires that the rapidly evolving\ncentral star hasn\u2019t yet driven away the gas in the disk with its increasingly vigorous wind (see the earlier\nsection onStar Formation). From observations, we see that the disk can be blown away within 10 million years,\nso growth of a giant planet must also be a very fast process, astronomically speaking.\nDebris Disks and Shepherd Planets\nThe dust around newly formed stars is gradually either incorporated into the growing planets in the newly\nforming planetary system or ejected through gravitational interactions with the planets into space. The dust\nwill disappear after about 30 million years unless the disk is continually supplied with new material. Local\ncomets and asteroids are the most likely sources of new dust. As the planet-size bodies grow, they stir up the\norbits of smaller objects in the area. These small bodies collide at high speeds, shatter, and produce tiny\nparticles of silicate dust and ices that can keep the disk supplied with the debris from these collisions.\nOver several hundred million years, the comets and asteroids will gradually be reduced in number, the\nfrequency of collisions will go down, and the supply of fresh dust will diminish. Remember that the heavy\nbombardment in the early solar system ended when the Sun was only about 500 million years old.\nObservations show that the dusty \u201cdebris disks\u201d around stars also become largely undetectable by the time\nthe stars reach an age of 400 to 500 million years. It is likely, however, that some small amount of cometary\nmaterial will remain in orbit, much like our Kuiper belt, a flattened disk of comets outside the orbit of Neptune.\nIn a young planetary system, even if we cannot see the planets directly, the planets can concentrate the dust\nparticles into clumps and arcs that are much larger than the planets themselves and more easily imaged. This\nis similar to how the tiny moons of Saturn shepherd the particles in the rings and produce large arcs and\nstructures in Saturn\u2019s rings.\nDebris disks\u2014many with just such clumps and arcs\u2014have now been found around many stars, such asHL Tau,\nlocated about 450 light-years from Earth in the constellation Taurus (Figure 21.15). In some stars, the\nbrightness of the rings varies with position; around other stars, there are bright arcs and gaps in the rings. The\nbrightness indicates the relative concentration of dust, since what we are seeing is infrared (heat radiation)\nfrom the dust particles in the rings. More dust means more radiation.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21.4 \u2022 Planets beyond the Solar System: Search and Discovery 695\nFigure21.15Dust Ring around a Young Star.This image was made by ALMA (the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array)\nat a wavelength of 1.3 millimeters and shows the young star HL Tau and its protoplanetary disk.

Direct observations of such distant planets are very difficult, however. You might compare a planet\norbiting a star to a mosquito flying around one of those giant spotlights at a shopping center opening. From\nclose up, you might spot the mosquito. But imagine viewing the scene from some distance away\u2014say, from an\nairplane. You could see the spotlight just fine, but what are your chances of catching the mosquito in that\nlight? Instead of making direct images, astronomers have relied on indirect observations and have now\nsucceeded in detecting a multitude of planets around other stars.\nIn 1995, after decades of effort, we found the first suchexoplanet(a planet outside our solar system) orbiting\na main-sequence star, and today we know that most stars form with planets. This is an example of how\npersistence and new methods of observation advance the knowledge of humanity. By studying exoplanets,\nastronomers hope to better understand our solar system in context of the rest of the universe. For instance,\nhow does the arrangement of our solar system compare to planetary systems in the rest of the universe? 696 21 \u2022 The Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar System\nWhat do exoplanets tell us about the process of planet formation? And how does knowing the frequency of\nexoplanets influence our estimates of whether there is life elsewhere?\nSearching for Orbital Motion\nMost exoplanet detections are made using techniques where we observe theeffectthat the planet exerts on\nthe host star. For example, the gravitational tug of an unseen planet will cause a small wobble in the host star.\nOr, if its orbit is properly aligned, a planet will periodically cross in front of the star, causing the brightness of\nthe star to dim.\nTo understand how a planet can move its host star, consider a single Jupiter-like planet. Both the planet and\nthe star actually revolve about theircommon center of mass. Remember that gravity is a mutual attraction.\nThe star and the planet each exert a force on the other, and we can find a stable point, the center of mass,\nbetween them about which both objects move. The smaller the mass of a body in such a system, the larger its\norbit. A massive star barely swings around the center of mass, while a low-mass planet makes a much larger\n\u201ctour.\u201d\nSuppose the planet is like Jupiter and has a mass about one-thousandth that of its star; in this case, the size of\nthe star\u2019s orbit is one-thousandth the size of the planet\u2019s. To get a sense of how difficult observing such\nmotion might be, let\u2019s see how hard Jupiter would be to detect in this way from the distance of a nearby star.\nConsider an alien astronomer trying to observe our own system from Alpha Centauri, the closest star system\nto our own (about 4.3 light-years away). There are two ways this astronomer could try to detect the orbital\nmotion of the Sun. One way would be to look for changes in the Sun\u2019s position on the sky. The second would\nbe to use theDoppler effectto look for changes in its velocity. Let\u2019s discuss each of these in turn.\nThe diameter of Jupiter\u2019s apparent orbit viewed from Alpha Centauri is 10 seconds of arc, and that of the Sun\u2019s\norbit is 0.010 seconds of arc. (Remember, 1 second of arc is 1/3600 degree.) If they could measure the\napparent position of the Sun (which is bright and easy to detect) to sufficient precision, they would describe an\norbit of diameter 0.010 seconds of arc with a period equal to that of Jupiter, which is 12 years.\nIn other words, if they watched the Sun for 12 years, they would see it wiggle back and forth in the sky by this\nminuscule fraction of a degree. From the observed motion and the period of the \u201cwiggle,\u201d they could deduce\nthe mass of Jupiter and its distance using Kepler\u2019s laws. (To refresh your memory about these laws, see the\nchapter onOrbits and Gravity.)\nMeasuring positions in the sky this accurately is extremely difficult, and so far, astronomers have not made\nany confirmed detections of planets using this technique. However, we have been successful in using\nspectrometers to measure the changing velocity of stars with planets around them.\nAs the star and planet orbit each other, part of their motion will be in our line of sight (toward us or away from\nus). Such motion can be measured using theDoppler effectand the star\u2019s spectrum. As the star moves back\nand forth in orbit around the system\u2019s center of mass in response to the gravitational tug of an orbiting\nplanet, the lines in its spectrum will shift back and forth.\nLet\u2019s again consider the example of the Sun. Itsradial velocity(motion toward or away from us) changes by\nabout 13 meters per second with a period of 12 years because of the gravitational pull of Jupiter. This\ncorresponds to about 30 miles per hour, roughly the speed at which many of us drive around town. Detecting\nmotion at this level in a star\u2019s spectrum presents an enormous technical challenge, but several groups of\nastronomers around the world, using specialized spectrographs designed for this purpose, have succeeded.\nNote that the change in speed does not depend on the distance of the star from the observer. Using the\nDoppler effect to detect planets will work at any distance, as long as the star is bright enough to provide a\ngood spectrum and a large telescope is available to make the observations (Figure 21.16).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21.4 \u2022 Planets beyond the Solar System: Search and Discovery 697\nFigure21.16Doppler Method of Detecting Planets.The motion of a star around a common center of mass with an orbiting planet\ncan be detected by measuring the changing speed of the star. When the star is moving away from us, the lines in its spectrum show\na tiny redshift; when it is moving toward us, they show a tiny blueshift. The change in color (wavelength) has been exaggerated here\nfor illustrative purposes. In reality, the Doppler shifts we measure are extremely small and require sophisticated equipment to be\ndetected.\nThe first successful use of the Doppler effect to find a planet around another star was in 1995. MichelMayor\nand DidierQuelozof the Geneva Observatory (Figure 21.17) used this technique to find a planet orbiting a star\nresembling our Sun called 51 Pegasi, about 40 light-years away. (The star can be found in the sky near the\ngreat square of Pegasus, the flying horse of Greek mythology, one of the easiest-to-find star patterns.) To\neveryone\u2019s surprise, the planet takes a mere 4.2 days to orbit around the star. (Remember that Mercury, the\ninnermost planet in our solar system, takes 88 days to go once around the Sun, so 4.2 days seems fantastically\nshort.)\nFigure21.17Planet Discoverers.In 1995, Didier Queloz and Michel Mayor of the Geneva Observatory were the first to discover a\nplanet around a regular star (51 Pegasi), for which they received the 2019 Nobel Prize in physics.

(credit: Weinstein/Ciel et Espace Photos) 698 21 \u2022 The Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar System\nMayor and Queloz\u2019s findings mean the planet must be very close to 51 Pegasi, circling it about 7 million\nkilometers away (Figure 21.18). At that distance, the energy of the star should heat the planet\u2019s surface to a\ntemperature of a few thousand degrees Celsius (a bit hot for future tourism). From its motion, astronomers\n1\ncalculate that it has at least half the mass of Jupiter , making it clearly a jovian and not a terrestrial-type\nplanet.\nFigure21.18Hot Jupiter.Artist Greg Bacon painted this impression of a hot, Jupiter-type planet orbiting close to a sunlike star. The\nartist shows bands on the planet like Jupiter, but we only estimate the mass of most hot, Jupiter-type planets from the Doppler\nmethod and don\u2019t know what conditions on the planet are like. (credit: ESO)\nSince that initial planet discovery, the rate of progress has been breathtaking. Almost a thousand giant planets\nhave been discovered using the Doppler technique. Many of these giant planets are orbiting close to their\nstars\u2014astronomers have called thesehot Jupiters.\nThe existence of giant planets so close to their stars was a surprise, and these discoveries have forced us to\nrethink our ideas about how planetary systems form. But for now, bear in mind that the Doppler-shift\nmethod\u2014which relies on the pull of a planet making its star \u201cwiggle\u201d back and forth around the center of\nmass\u2014is most effective at finding planets that are both close to their stars and massive. These planets cause\nthe biggest \u201cwiggles\u201d in the motion of their stars and the biggest Doppler shifts in the spectrum. Plus, they will\nbe found sooner, since astronomers like to monitor the star for at least one full orbit (and perhaps more) and\nhot Jupiterstake the shortest time to complete their orbit.\nSo if such planets exist, we would expect to be finding this type first. Scientists call this aselection\neffect\u2014where our technique of discovery selects certain kinds of objects as \u201ceasy finds.\u201d As an example of a\nselection effect in everyday life, imagine you decide you are ready for a new romantic relationship in your life.\nTo begin with, you only attend social events on campus, all of which require a student ID to get in. Your\nselection of possible partners will then be limited to students at your college. That may not give you as diverse\na group to choose from as you want. In the same way, when we first used the Doppler technique, it selected\nmassive planets close to their stars as the most likely discoveries. As we spend longer times watching target\nstars and as our ability to measure smaller Doppler shifts improves, this technique can reveal more distant and\nless massive planets too.\n1 The Doppler method only allows us to find the minimum mass of a planet. To determine the exact mass using the Doppler shift\nand Kepler\u2019s laws, we must also have the angle at which the planet\u2019s orbit is oriented to our view\u2014something we don\u2019t have any\nindependent way of knowing in most cases. Still, if the minimum mass is half of Jupiter\u2019s, the actual mass can only be larger than\nthat, and we are sure that we are dealing with a jovian planet.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21.4 \u2022 Planets beyond the Solar System: Search and Discovery 699\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView aseries of animations(https://openstax.org/l/30keplawsolarani)demonstrating solar system motion\nand Kepler\u2019s laws, and select animation 1 (Kepler\u2019s laws) from the dropdown playlist.

When the orbital plane of the planet is tilted or inclined so that it is viewed edge-on, we will see the\nplanet cross in front of the star once per orbit, causing the star to dim slightly; this event is known astransit.\nFigure 21.19shows a sketch of the transit at three time steps: (1) out of transit, (2) the start of transit, and (3)\nfull transit, along with a sketch of the light curve, which shows the drop in the brightness of the host star. The\namount of light blocked\u2014the depth of the transit\u2014depends on the area of the planet (its size) compared to\nthe star. If we can determine the size of the star, the transit method tells us the size of the planet.\nFigure21.19Planet Transits.As the planet transits, it blocks out some of the light from the star, causing a temporary dimming in\nthe brightness of the star. The top figure shows three moments during the transit event and the bottom panel shows the\ncorresponding light curve: (1) out of transit, (2) transit ingress, and (3) the full drop in brightness.\nThe interval between successive transits is the length of the year for that planet, which can be used (again\nusing Kepler\u2019s laws) to find its distance from the star. Larger planets like Jupiter block out more starlight than\nsmall earthlike planets, making transits by giant planets easier to detect, even from ground-based\nobservatories. But by going into space, above the distorting effects of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the transit\ntechnique has been extended to exoplanets as small as Mars.\nEXAMPLE 21.1\nTransit Depth\nIn a transit, the planet\u2019s circular disk blocks the light of the star\u2019s circular disk. The area of a circle is \u03c0R2.\nThe amount of light the planet blocks, called thetransit depth, is then given by 700 21 \u2022 The Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar System\nNow calculate the transit depth for a star the size of the Sun with a gas giant planet the size of Jupiter.\nSolution\nThe radius of Jupiter is 71,400 km, while the radius of the Sun is 695,700 km. Substituting into the equation,\nwe get or 1%, which can easily be detected with the instruments on\nboard the Kepler spacecraft.\nCheck Your Learning\nWhat is the transit depth for a star half the size of the Sun with a much smaller planet, like the size of Earth?\nAnswer:\nThe radius of Earth is 6371 km. Therefore,\n, or significantly less than 1%.\nThe Doppler method allows us to estimate the mass of a planet. If the same object can be studied by both the\nDoppler and transit techniques, we can measure both the mass and the size of the exoplanet. This is a\npowerful combination that can be used to derive the average density (mass/volume) of the planet. In 1999,\nusing measurements from ground-based telescopes, the first transiting planet was detected orbiting the star\nHD 209458. The planet transits its parent star for about 3 hours every 3.5 days as we view it from Earth.\nDoppler measurements showed that the planet around HD 209458 has about 70% the mass of Jupiter, but its\nradius is about 35% larger than Jupiter\u2019s. This was the first case where we could determine what an exoplanet\nwas made of\u2014with that mass and radius, HD 209458 must be a gas and liquid world like Jupiter or Saturn.\nIt is even possible to learn something about the planet\u2019s atmosphere. When the planet passes in front of HD\n209458, the atoms in the planet\u2019s atmosphere absorb starlight. Observations of this absorption were first\nmade at the wavelengths of yellow sodium lines and showed that the atmosphere of the planet contains\nsodium; now, other elements can be measured as well.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTry atransit simulator(https://openstax.org/l/30transimul)that demonstrates how a planet passing in\nfront of its parent star can lead to the planet\u2019s detection. Follow the instructions to run the animation on\nyour computer.\nTransiting planets reveal such a wealth of information that the French Space Agency (CNES) and the European\nSpace Agency (ESA) launched the CoRoT space telescope in 2007 to detect transiting exoplanets. CoRoT\ndiscovered 32 transiting exoplanets, including the first transiting planet with a size and density similar to Earth.\nIn 2012, the spacecraft suffered an onboard computer failure, ending the mission. Meanwhile, NASA built a\nmuch more powerful transit observatory called Kepler.\nIn 2009, NASA launched the Kepler space telescope, dedicated to the discovery of transiting exoplanets. This\nspacecraft stared continuously at more than 150,000 stars in a small patch of sky near the constellation of\nCygnus\u2014just above the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy (Figure 21.20). Kepler\u2019s cameras and ability to measure\nsmall changes in brightness very precisely enabled the discovery of thousands of exoplanets, including many\nmulti-planet systems. The spacecraft required three reaction wheels\u2014a type of wheel used to help control\nslight rotation of the spacecraft\u2014to stabilize the pointing of the telescope and monitor the brightness of the\nsame group of stars over and over again. Kepler was launched with four reaction wheels (one a spare), but by\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21.4 \u2022 Planets beyond the Solar System: Search and Discovery 701\nMay 2013, two wheels had failed and the telescope could no longer be accurately pointed toward the target\narea. Kepler had been designed to operate for 4 years, and ironically, the pointing failure occurred exactly 4\nyears and 1 day after it began observing.\nHowever, this failure did not end the mission. The Kepler telescope continued to observe for two more years,\nlooking for short-period transits in different parts of the sky. We discuss the Kepler results in the next section\nExoplanets Everywhere: What We Are Learning. A new NASA mission called TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey\nSatellite) is now carrying out a transit survey of the nearer (and therefore brighter) stars all over the sky. TESS\ncompleted its first planned survey of the sky in August 2020 and reported 66 exoplanet discoveries and almost\n2100 candidates that need further observations to confirm.\nFigure21.20Kepler\u2019s Field of View.The boxes show the region where the Kepler spacecraft cameras took images of over 150,000\nstars regularly, to find transiting planets. (credit \u201cfield of view\u201d: modification of work by NASA/Kepler mission; credit \u201cspacecraft\u201d:\nmodification of work by NASA/Kepler mission/Wendy Stenzel)\nWhat do we mean, exactly, by \u201cdiscovery\u201d of transiting exoplanets? A single transit shows up as a very slight\ndrop in the brightness of the star, lasting several hours. However, astronomers must be on guard against\nother factors that might produce a false transit, especially when working at the limit of precision of the\ntelescope. We must wait for a second transit of similar depth. But when another transit is observed, we don\u2019t\ninitially know whether it might be due to another planet in a different orbit. The \u201cdiscovery\u201d occurs only when\na third transit is found with similar depth and the same spacing in time as the first pair.\nComputers normally conduct the analysis, which involves searching for tiny, periodic dips in the light from\neach star, extending over 4 years of observation. But the Kepler mission also has a program in which non-\nastronomers\u2014citizen scientists\u2014can examine the data. These dedicated volunteers have found several\ntransits that were missed by the computer analyses, showing that the human eye and brain sometimes\nrecognize unusual events that a computer was not programmed to look for.\nMeasuring three or four evenly spaced transits is normally enough to \u201cdiscover\u201d an exoplanet. But in a new\nfield like exoplanet research, we would like to find further independent verification. The strongest\nconfirmation happens when ground-based telescopes are also able to detect a Doppler shift with the same 702 21 \u2022 The Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar System\nperiod as the transits. However, this is generally not possible for Earth-size planets. One of the most\nconvincing ways to verify that a dip in brightness is due to a planet is to find more planets orbiting the same\nstar\u2014aplanetary system. Multi-planet systems also provide alternative ways to estimate the masses of the\nplanets, as we will discuss in the next section.\nThe selection effects (or biases) in the Kepler data are similar to those in Doppler observations. Large planets\nare easier to find than small ones, and short-period planets are easier than long-period planets. If we require\nthree transits to establish the presence of a planet, we are of course limited to discovering planets with orbital\nperiods less than one-third of the observing interval. Thus, it was only in its fourth and final year of operation\nthat Kepler was able to find planets with orbits like Earth\u2019s that require 1 year to go around their star.\nDirect Detection\nThe best possible evidence for an earthlike planet elsewhere would be an image. After all, \u201cseeing is believing\u201d\nis a very human prejudice. But imaging a distant planet is a formidable challenge indeed. Suppose, for\nexample, you were a great distance away and wished to detect reflected light from Earth. Earth intercepts and\nreflects less than one billionth of the Sun\u2019s radiation, so its apparent brightness in visible light is less than one\nbillionth that of the Sun. Compounding the challenge of detecting such a faint speck of light, the planet is\nswamped by the blaze of radiation from its parent star.\nEven today, the best telescope mirrors\u2019 optics have slight imperfections that prevent the star\u2019s light from\ncoming into focus in a completely sharp point.\nDirect imaging works best for young gas giant planets that emit infrared light and reside at large separations\nfrom their host stars. Young giant planets emit more infrared light because they have more internal energy,\nstored from the process of planet formation. Even then, clever techniques must be employed to subtract out\nthe light from the host star. In 2008, three such young planets were discovered orbiting HR 8799, a star in the\nconstellation of Pegasus (Figure 21.21). Two years later, a fourth planet was detected closer to the star.\nAdditional planets may reside even closer to HR 8799, but if they exist, they are currently lost in the glare of the\nstar.\nSince then, a number of planets around other stars have been found using direct imaging. However, one\nchallenge is to tell whether the objects we are seeing are indeed planets or if they are brown dwarfs (failed\nstars) in orbit around a star.\nFigure21.21Exoplanets around HR 8799.This image shows Keck telescope observations of four directly imaged planets orbiting\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21.5 \u2022 Exoplanets Everywhere: What We Are Learning 703\nHR 8799. A size scale for the system gives the distance in AU (remember that one astronomical unit is the distance between Earth\nand the Sun.) (credit: modification of work by Ben Zuckerman)\nDirect imaging is an important technique for characterizing an exoplanet. The brightness of the planet can be\nmeasured at different wavelengths. These observations provide an estimate for the temperature of the\nplanet\u2019s atmosphere; in the case of HR 8799 planet 1, the color suggests the presence of thick clouds. Spectra\ncan also be obtained from the faint light to analyze the atmospheric constituents. A spectrum of HR 8799\nplanet 1 indicates a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, while the closer planet 4 shows evidence for methane in the\natmosphere.\nAnother way to overcome the blurring effect of Earth\u2019s atmosphere is to observe from space. Infrared may be\nthe optimal wavelength range in which to observe because planets get brighter in the infrared while stars like\nour Sun get fainter, thereby making it easier to detect a planet against the glare of its star. Special optical\ntechniques can be used to suppress the light from the central star and make it easier to see the planet itself.\nHowever, even if we go into space, it will be difficult to obtain images of Earth-size planets.\n21.5 Exoplanets Everywhere: What We Are Learning\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain what we have learned from our discovery of exoplanets\nIdentify which kind of exoplanets appear to be the most common in the Galaxy\nDiscuss the kinds of planetary systems we are finding around other stars\nBefore the discovery of exoplanets, most astronomers expected that other planetary systems would be much\nlike our own\u2014planets following roughly circular orbits, with the most massive planets several AU from their\nparent star. Such systems do exist in large numbers, but many exoplanets and planetary systems are very\ndifferent from those in our solar system. Another surprise is the existence of whole classes of exoplanets that\nwe simply don\u2019t have in our solar system: planets with masses between the mass of Earth and Neptune, and\nplanets that are several times more massive than Jupiter.\nKepler Results\nThe Kepler telescope has been responsible for the discovery of most exoplanets, especially at smaller sizes, as\nillustrated inFigure 21.22, where the Kepler discoveries are plotted in yellow. You can see the wide range of\nsizes, including planets substantially larger than Jupiter and smaller than Earth. The absence of Kepler-\ndiscovered exoplanets with orbital periods longer than a few hundred days is a consequence of the 4-year\nlifetime of the mission. (Remember that three evenly spaced transits must be observed to register a\ndiscovery.) At the smaller sizes, the absence of planets much smaller than one earth radius is due to the\ndifficulty of detecting transits by very small planets. In effect, the \u201cdiscovery space\u201d for Kepler was limited to\nplanets with orbital periods less than 400 days and sizes larger than Mars. 704 21 \u2022 The Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar System\nFigure21.22Exoplanet Discoveries through 2017.The vertical axis shows the radius of each planet compared to Earth. Horizontal\nlines show the size of Earth, Neptune, and Jupiter. The horizontal axis shows the time each planet takes to make one orbit (and is\ngiven in Earth days). Recall that Mercury takes 88 days and Earth takes a little more than 365 days to orbit the Sun. The yellow dots\nshow planets discovered by the Kepler mission using transits, and the blue dots are the discoveries by other projects and techniques.\nWhen this graph was made, astronomers had discovered just over 3,500 exoplanets; as of the start of 2022, that number has risen to\nroughly 5,000. (credit: modification of work by NASA/Ames Research Center/Jessie Dotson and Wendy Stenzel)\nOne of the primary objectives of theKepler missionwas to find out how many stars hosted planets and\nespecially to estimate the frequency of earthlike planets. Although Kepler looked at only a very tiny fraction of\nthe stars in the Galaxy, the sample size was large enough to draw some interesting conclusions. While the\nobservations apply only to the stars observed by Kepler, those stars are reasonably representative, and so\nastronomers can extrapolate to the entire Galaxy.\nFigure 21.23shows that the Kepler discoveries include many rocky, Earth-size planets, far more than Jupiter-\nsize gas planets. This immediately tells us that the initial Doppler discovery of many hot Jupiters was a biased\nsample, in effect, finding the odd planetary systems because they were the easiest to detect. However, there is\none huge difference between this observed size distribution and that of planets in our solar system. The most\ncommon planets have radii between 1.4 and 2.8 that of Earth, sizes for which we have no examples in the solar\nsystem. These have been nicknamedsuper-Earths, while the other large group with sizes between 2.8 and 4\nthat of Earth are often calledmini-Neptunes.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21.5 \u2022 Exoplanets Everywhere: What We Are Learning 705\nFigure21.23Kepler Discoveries.This bar graph shows the number of planets of each size range found among the first 2213 Kepler\nplanet discoveries. Sizes range from half the size of Earth to 20 times that of Earth. On the vertical axis, you can see the fraction that\neach size range makes up of the total. Note that planets that are between 1.4 and 4 times the size of Earth make up the largest\nfractions, yet this size range is not represented among the planets in our solar system. (credit: modification of work by NASA/Kepler\nmission)\nWhat a remarkable discovery it is that the most common types of planets in the Galaxy are completely absent\nfrom our solar system and were unknown until Kepler\u2019s survey. However, recall that really small planets were\ndifficult for the Kepler instruments to find. So, to estimate the frequency of Earth-size exoplanets, we need to\ncorrect for this sampling bias. The result is the corrected size distribution shown inFigure 21.24. Notice that in\nthis graph, we have also taken the step of showing not the number of Kepler detections but the average\nnumber of planets per star for solar-type stars (spectral types F, G, and K). 706 21 \u2022 The Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar System\nFigure21.24Size Distribution of Planets for Stars Similar to the Sun.We show the average number of planets per star in each\nplanet size range. (The average is less than one because some stars will have zero planets of that size range.) This distribution,\ncorrected for biases in the Kepler data, shows that Earth-size planets may actually be the most common type of exoplanets. (credit:\nmodification of work by NASA/Kepler mission)\nWe see that the most common planet sizes of are those with radii from 1 to 3 times that of Earth\u2014what we\nhave called \u201cEarths\u201d and \u201csuper-Earths.\u201d Each group occurs in about one-third to one-quarter of stars. In\nother words, if we group these sizes together, we can conclude there is nearly one such planet per star! And\nremember, this census includes primarily planets with orbital periods less than 2 years. We do not yet know\nhow many undiscovered planets might exist at larger distances from their star.\nTo estimate the number of Earth-size planets in our Galaxy, we need to remember that there are\napproximately 100 billion stars of spectral types F, G, and K. Therefore, we estimate that there are about 30\nbillion Earth-size planets in our Galaxy. If we include the super-Earths too, then there could be one hundred\nbillion in the whole Galaxy. This idea\u2014that planets of roughly Earth\u2019s size are so numerous\u2014is surely one of\nthe most important discoveries of modern astronomy.\nPlanets with Known Densities\nFor several hundred exoplanets, we have been able to measure both the size of the planet from transit data\nand its mass from Doppler data, yielding an estimate of its density. Comparing the average density of\nexoplanets to the density of planets in our solar system helps us understand whether they are rocky or\ngaseous in nature. This has been particularly important for understanding the structure of the new categories\nof super-Earths and mini-Neptunes with masses between 3\u201310 times the mass of Earth. A key observation so\nfar is that planets that are more than 10 times the mass of Earth have substantial gaseous envelopes (like\nUranus and Neptune) whereas lower-mass planets are predominately rocky in nature (like the terrestrial\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21.5 \u2022 Exoplanets Everywhere: What We Are Learning 707\nplanets).\nFigure 21.25compares all the exoplanets that have both mass and radius measurements. The dependence of\nthe radius on planet mass is also shown for a few illustrative cases\u2014hypothetical planets made of pure iron,\nrock, water, or hydrogen.\nFigure21.25Exoplanets with Known Densities.Exoplanets with known masses and radii (red circles) are plotted along with solid\nlines that show the theoretical size of pure iron, rock, water, and hydrogen planets with increasing mass. Masses are given in\nmultiples of Earth\u2019s mass. (For comparison, Jupiter contains enough mass to make 320 Earths.) The green triangles indicate planets\nin our solar system.\nAt lower masses, notice that as the mass of these hypothetical planets increases, the radius also increases.\nThat makes sense\u2014if you were building a model of a planet out of clay, your toy planet would increase in size\nas you added more clay. However, for the highest mass planets (M >1000M ) inFigure 21.25, notice that\nEarth\nthe radius stops increasing and the planets with greater mass are actually smaller. This occurs because\nincreasing the mass also increases the gravity of the planet, so that compressible materials (even rock is\ncompressible) will become more tightly packed, shrinking the size of the more massive planet.\nIn reality, planets are not pure compositions like the hypothetical water or iron planet. Earth is composed of a\nsolid iron core, an outer liquid-iron core, a rocky mantle and crust, and a relatively thin atmospheric layer.\nExoplanets are similarly likely to be differentiated into compositional layers. The theoretical lines inFigure\n21.25are simply guides that suggest a range of possible compositions.\nAstronomers who work on the complex modeling of the interiors of rocky planets make the simplifying\nassumption that the planet consists of two or three layers. This is not perfect, but it is a reasonable\napproximation and another good example of how science works. Often, the first step in understanding\nsomething new is to narrow down the range of possibilities. This sets the stage for refining and deepening our 708 21 \u2022 The Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar System\nknowledge. InFigure 21.25, the two green triangles with roughly 1M and 1R represent Venus and\nEarth Earth\nEarth. Notice that these planets fall between the models for a pure iron and a pure rock planet, consistent with\nwhat we would expect for the known mixed-chemical composition of Venus and Earth.\nIn the case of gaseous planets, the situation is more complex. Hydrogen is the lightest element in the periodic\ntable, yet many of the detected exoplanets inFigure 21.25with masses greater than 100M have radii that\nEarth\nsuggest they are lower in density than a pure hydrogen planet. Hydrogen is the lightest element, so what is\nhappening here? Why do some gas giant planets have inflated radii that are larger than the fictitious pure\nhydrogen planet? Many of these planets reside in short-period orbits close to the host star where they\nintercept a significant amount of radiated energy. If this energy is trapped deep in the planet atmosphere, it\ncan cause the planet to expand.\nPlanets that orbit close to their host stars in slightly eccentric orbits have another source of energy: the star\nwill raise tides in these planets that tend to circularize the orbits. This process also results in tidal dissipation of\nenergy that can inflate the atmosphere. It would be interesting to measure the size of gas giant planets in\nwider orbits where the planets should be cooler\u2014the expectation is that unless they are very young, these\ncooler gas giant exoplanets (sometimes called \u201ccold Jupiters\u201d) should not be inflated. But we don\u2019t yet have\ndata on these more distant exoplanets.\nExoplanetary Systems\nAs we search for exoplanets, we don\u2019t expect to find only one planet per star. Our solar system has eight\nmajor planets, half a dozen dwarf planets, and millions of smaller objects orbiting the Sun. The evidence we\nhave of planetary systems in formation also suggest that they are likely to produce multi-planet systems.\nThe first planetary system was found around the star Upsilon Andromedae in 1999 using the Doppler method,\nand many others have been found since then. If such exoplanetary system are common, let\u2019s consider which\nsystems we expect to find in the Kepler transit data.\nA planet will transit its star only if Earth lies in the plane of the planet\u2019s orbit. If the planets in other systems do\nnot have orbits in the same plane, we are unlikely to see multiple transiting objects. Also, as we have noted\nbefore, Kepler was sensitive only to planets with orbital periods less than about 4 years. What we expect from\nKepler data, then, is evidence of coplanar planetary systems confined to what would be the realm of the\nterrestrial planets in our solar system.\nBy 2022, astronomers gathered data on over 800 such exoplanet systems. Many have only two known planets,\nbut a few have as many as five, and one has eight (the same number of planets as our own solar system). For\nthe most part, these are very compact systems with most of their planets closer to their star than Mercury is to\nthe Sun. The figure below shows one of the largest exoplanet systems: that of the star called Kepler-62 (Figure\n21.26). Our solar system is shown to the same scale, for comparison (note that the Kepler-62 planets are\ndrawn with artistic license; we have no detailed images of any exoplanets).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21.6 \u2022 New Perspectives on Planet Formation 709\nFigure21.26Exoplanet System Kepler-62, with the Solar System Shown to the Same Scale.The green areas are the \u201chabitable\nzones,\u201d the range of distance from the star where surface temperatures are likely to be consistent with liquid water. (credit:\nmodification of work by NASA/Ames/JPL-Caltech)\nAll but one of the planets in the K-62 system are larger than Earth. These are super-Earths, and one of them\n(62d) is in the size range of a mini-Neptune, where it is likely to be largely gaseous. The smallest planet in this\nsystem is about the size of Mars. The three inner planets orbit very close to their star, and only the outer two\nhave orbits larger than Mercury in our system. The green areas represent each star\u2019s \u201chabitable zone,\u201d which\nis the distance from the star where we calculate that surface temperatures would be consistent with liquid\nwater. The Kepler-62 habitable zone is much smaller than that of the Sun because the star is intrinsically\nfainter.\nWith closely spaced systems like this, the planets can interact gravitationally with each other. The result is that\nthe observed transits occur a few minutes earlier or later than would be predicted from simple orbits. These\ngravitational interactions have allowed the Kepler scientists to calculate masses for the planets, providing\nanother way to learn about exoplanets.\nKepler has discovered some interesting and unusual planetary systems. For example, most astronomers\nexpected planets to be limited to single stars. But we have found planets orbiting close double stars, so that\nthe planet would see two suns in its sky, like those of the fictional planet Tatooine in theStar Warsfilms. At the\nopposite extreme, planets can orbit one star of a wide, double-star system without major interference from\nthe second star.\n21.6 New Perspectives on Planet Formation\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain how exoplanet discoveries have revised our understanding of planet formation\nDiscuss how planetary systems quite different from our solar system might have come about 710 21 \u2022 The Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar System\nTraditionally, astronomers have assumed that the planets in our solar system formed at about their current\ndistances from the Sun and have remained there ever since. The first step in the formation of a giant planet is\nto build up a solid core, which happens when planetesimals collide and stick. Eventually, this core becomes\nmassive enough to begin sweeping up gaseous material in the disk, thereby building the gas giants Jupiter\nand Saturn.\nHow to Make a Hot Jupiter\nThe traditional model for the formation of planets works only if the giant planets are formed far from the\ncentral star (about 5\u201310 AU), where the disk is cold enough to have a fairly high density of solid matter. It\ncannot explain thehot Jupiters, which are located very close to their stars where any rocky raw material would\nbe completely vaporized. It also cannot explain the elliptical orbits we observe for some exoplanets because\nthe orbit of a protoplanet, whatever its initial shape, will quickly become circular through interactions with the\nsurrounding disk of material and will remain that way as the planet grows by sweeping up additional matter.\nSo we have two options: either we find a new model for forming planets close to the searing heat of the parent\nstar, or we find a way to change the orbits of planets so that cold Jupiters can travel inwardafterthey form.\nMost research now supports the latter explanation.\nCalculations show that if a planet forms while a substantial amount of gas remains in the disk, then some of\nthe planet\u2019s orbital angular momentum can be transferred to the disk. As it loses momentum (through a\nprocess that reminds us of the effects of friction), the planet will spiral inward. This process can transport giant\nplanets, initially formed in cold regions of the disk, closer to the central star\u2014thereby producing hot Jupiters.\nGravitational interactions between planets in the chaotic early solar system can also cause planets to slingshot\ninward from large distances. But for this to work, the other planet has to carry away the angular momentum\nand move to a more distant orbit.\nIn some cases, we can use the combination of transit plus Doppler measurements to determine whether the\nplanets orbit in the same plane and in the same direction as the star. For the first few cases, things seemed to\nwork just as we anticipated: like the solar system, the gas giant planets orbited in their star\u2019s equatorial plane\nand in the same direction as the spinning star.\nThen, some startling discoveries were made of gas giant planets that orbited at right angles or even in the\nopposite sense as the spin of the star. How could this happen? Again, there must have been interactions\nbetween planets. It\u2019s possible that before the system settled down, two planets came close together, so that\none was kicked into an unusual orbit. Or perhaps a passing star perturbed the system after the planets were\nnewly formed.\nForming Planetary Systems\nWhen theMilky Way Galaxywas young, the stars that formed did not contain many heavy elements like iron.\nSeveral generations of star formation and star death were required to enrich the interstellar medium for\nsubsequent generations of stars. Since planets seem to form \u201cinside out,\u201d starting with the accretion of the\nmaterials that can make the rocky cores with which planets start, astronomers wondered when in the history\nof the Galaxy, planet formation would turn on.\nThe star Kepler-444 has shed some light on this question. This is a tightly packed system of five planets\u2014the\nsmallest comparable in size to Mercury and the largest similar in size to Venus. All five planets were detected\nwith the Kepler spacecraft as they transited their parent star. All five planets orbit their host star in less than\nthe time it takes Mercury to complete one orbit about the Sun. Remarkably, the host star Kepler-444 is more\nthan 11 billion years old and formed when the Milky Way was only 2 billion years old. So the heavier elements\nneeded to make rocky planets must have already been available then. This ancient planetary system sets the\nclock on the beginning of rocky planet formation to be relatively soon after the formation of our Galaxy.\nKepler data demonstrate that while rocky planets inside Mercury\u2019s orbit are missing from our solar system,\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21.6 \u2022 New Perspectives on Planet Formation 711\nthey are common around other stars, like Kepler-444. When the first systems packed with close-in rocky\nplanets were discovered, we wondered why they were so different from our solar system. When many such\nsystems were discovered, we began to wonder if it was our solar system that was different. This led to\nspeculation that additional rocky planets might once have existed close to the Sun in our solar system.\nThere is some evidence from the motions in the outer solar system that Jupiter may have migrated inward\nlong ago. If correct, then gravitational perturbations from Jupiter could have dislodged the orbits of close-in\nrocky planets, causing them to fall into the Sun. Consistent with this picture, astronomers now think that\nUranus and Neptune probably did not form at their present distances from the Sun but rather closer to where\nJupiter and Saturn are now. The reason for this idea is that density in the disk of matter surrounding the Sun at\nthe time the planets formed was so low outside the orbit of Saturn that it would take several billion years to\nbuild up Uranus and Neptune. Yet we saw earlier in the chapter that the disks around protostars survive only a\nfew million years.\nTherefore, scientists have developed computer models demonstrating that Uranus and Neptune could have\nformed near the current locations of Jupiter and Saturn, and then been kicked out to larger distances through\ngravitational interactions with their neighbors. All these wonderful new observations illustrate how dangerous\nit can be to draw conclusions about a phenomenon in science (in this case, how planetary systems form and\narrange themselves) when you are only working with a single example.\nExoplanets have given rise to a new picture of planetary system formation\u2014one that is much more chaotic\nthan we originally thought. If we think of the planets as being like skaters in a rink, our original model (with\nonly our own solar system as a guide) assumed that the planets behaved like polite skaters, all obeying the\nrules of the rink and all moving in nearly the same direction, following roughly circular paths. The new picture\ncorresponds more to a roller derby, where the skaters crash into one another, change directions, and\nsometimes are thrown entirely out of the rink.\nHabitable Exoplanets\nWhile thousands of exoplanets have been discovered in the past two decades, every observational technique\nhas fallen short of finding more than a few candidates that resemble Earth (Figure 21.27). Astronomers are not\nsure exactly what properties would define another Earth. Do we need to find a planet that isexactlythe same\nsize and mass as Earth? That may be difficult and may not be important from the perspective of habitability.\nAfter all, we have no reason to think that life could not have arisen on Earth if our planet had been a little bit\nsmaller or larger. And, remember that how habitable a planet is depends on both its distance from its star and\nthe nature of its atmosphere. The greenhouse effect can make some planets warmer (as it did for Venus and is\ndoing more and more for Earth). 712 21 \u2022 The Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar System\nFigure21.27Many Earthlike Planets.This painting, commissioned by NASA, conveys the idea that there may be many planets\nresembling Earth out there as our methods for finding them improve. (credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/R. Hurt (SSC-Caltech))\nWe can ask other questions to which we don\u2019t yet know the answers. Does this \u201ctwin\u201d of Earth need to orbit a\nsolar-type star, or can we consider as candidates the numerous exoplanets orbiting K- and M-class stars? (In\nthe summer of 2016, astronomers reported the discovery of a planet with at least 1.3 times the mass of Earth\naround the nearest star,Proxima Centauri, which is spectral type M and located 4.2 light years from us.) We\nhave a special interest in finding planets that could support life like ours, in which case, we need to find\nexoplanets within their star\u2019s habitable zone, where surface temperatures are consistent with liquid water on\nthe surface. This is probably the most important characteristic defining an Earth-analog exoplanet.\nThe search for potentially habitable worlds is one of the prime drivers for exoplanet research in the next\ndecade. Astronomers are beginning to develop realistic plans for new instruments that can even look for signs\nof life on distant worlds (examining their atmospheres for gases associated with life, for example). If we\nrequire telescopes in space to find such worlds, we need to recognize that years are required to plan, build,\nand launch such space observatories. The discovery of exoplanets and the knowledge that most stars have\nplanetary systems are transforming our thinking about life beyond Earth. We are closer than ever to knowing\nwhether habitable (and inhabited) planets are common. This work lends a new spirit of optimism to the search\nfor life elsewhere, a subject to which we will return inLife in the Universe.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 21 \u2022 Key Terms 713\nKey Terms\nexoplanet a planet orbiting a star other than our Sun\ngiant molecular clouds large, cold interstellar clouds with diameters of dozens of light-years and typical\nmasses of 105solar masses; found in the spiral arms of galaxies, these clouds are where stars form\nHerbig-Haro (HH) object luminous knots of gas in an area of star formation that are set to glow by jets of\nmaterial from a protostar\nmini-Neptune a planet that is intermediate between the largest terrestrial planet in our solar system (Earth)\nand the smallest jovian planet (Neptune); generally, mini-Neptunes have sizes between 2.8 and 4 times\nEarth\u2019s size\nprotostar a very young star still in the process of formation, before nuclear fusion begins\nstellar wind the outflow of gas, sometimes at speeds as high as hundreds of kilometers per second, from a\nstar\nsuper-Earth a planet larger than Earth, generally between 1.4 and 2.8 times the size of our planet\ntransit when one astronomical object moves in front of another\nSummary\n21.1Star Formation\nMost stars form in giant molecular clouds with masses as large as 3 \u00d7 106solar masses. The most well-studied\nmolecular cloud is Orion, where star formation is currently taking place. Molecular clouds typically contain\nregions of higher density called clumps, which in turn contain several even-denser cores of gas and dust, each\nof which may become a star. A star can form inside a core if its density is high enough that gravity can\noverwhelm the internal pressure and cause the gas and dust to collapse. The accumulation of material halts\nwhen a protostar develops a strong stellar wind, leading to jets of material being observed coming from the\nstar. These jets of material can collide with the material around the star and produce regions that emit light\nthat are known as Herbig-Haro objects.\n21.2The H\u2013R Diagram and the Study of Stellar Evolution\nThe evolution of a star can be described in terms of changes in its temperature and luminosity, which can best\nbe followed by plotting them on an H\u2013R diagram. Protostars generate energy (and internal heat) through\ngravitational contraction that typically continues for millions of years, until the star reaches the main\nsequence.\n21.3Evidence That Planets Form around Other Stars\nObservational evidence shows that most protostars are surrounded by disks with large-enough diameters and\nenough mass (as much as 10% that of the Sun) to form planets. After a few million years, the inner part of the\ndisk is cleared of dust, and the disk is then shaped like a donut with the protostar centered in the\nhole\u2014something that can be explained by the formation of planets in that inner zone. Around a few older\nstars, we see disks formed from the debris produced when small bodies (comets and asteroids) collide with\neach other. The distribution of material in the rings of debris disks is probably determined by shepherd\nplanets, just as Saturn\u2019s shepherd moons affect the orbits of the material in its rings. Protoplanets that grow\nto be 10 times the mass of Earth or bigger while there is still considerable gas in their disk can then capture\nmore of that gas and become giant planets like Jupiter in the solar system.\n21.4Planets beyond the Solar System: Search and Discovery\nSeveral observational techniques have successfully detected planets orbiting other stars. These techniques fall\ninto two general categories\u2014direct and indirect detection. The Doppler and transit techniques are our most\npowerful indirect tools for finding exoplanets. Some planets are also being found by direct imaging. 714 21 \u2022 For Further Exploration\n21.5Exoplanets Everywhere: What We Are Learning\nAlthough the Kepler mission is finding thousands of new exoplanets, these are limited to orbital periods of less\nthan 400 days and sizes larger than Mars. Still, we can use the Kepler discoveries to extrapolate the\ndistribution of planets in our Galaxy. The data so far imply that planets like Earth are the most common type of\nplanet, and that there may be 100 billion Earth-size planets around Sun-like stars in the Galaxy. More than 800\nplanetary systems have been discovered around other stars. In many of them, planets are arranged differently\nthan in our solar system.\n21.6New Perspectives on Planet Formation\nThe ensemble of exoplanets is incredibly diverse and has led to a revision in our understanding of planet\nformation that includes the possibility of vigorous, chaotic interactions, with planet migration and scattering. It\nis possible that the solar system is unusual (and not representative) in how its planets are arranged. Many\nsystems seem to have rocky planets farther inward than we do, for example, and some even have \u201chot\nJupiters\u201d very close to their star. Ambitious space experiments should make it possible to image earthlike\nplanets outside the solar system and even to obtain information about their habitability as we search for life\nelsewhere.\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nStar Formation\nBlaes, O. \u201cA Universe of Disks.\u201dScientific American(October 2004): 48.

Your group is a subcommittee of scientists examining whether any of the \u201chot Jupiters\u201d (giant planets\ncloser to their stars than Mercury is to the Sun) could have life on or near them. Can you come up with\nplaces on, in, or near such planets where life could develop or where some forms of life might survive?\nB.

What kind of instruments and search programs would you recommend, and why?\nC. Some people consider the discovery of any planets (even hot Jupiters) around other stars one of the most\nimportant events in the history of astronomical research. Some astronomers have been surprised that the\npublic is not more excited about the planet discoveries. One reason that has been suggested for this lack\nof public surprise and excitement is that science fiction stories have long prepared us for there being\nplanets around other stars. (The Starship Enterprise on the 1960sStar TrekTV series found some in just\nabout every weekly episode.) What does your group think? Did you know about the discovery of planets\naround other stars before taking this course? Do you consider it exciting? Were you surprised to hear\nabout it? Are science fiction movies and books good or bad tools for astronomy education in general, do\nyou think?\nD. What if future space instruments reveal an earthlike exoplanet with significant amounts of oxygen and\nmethane in its atmosphere? Suppose the planet and its star are 50 light-years away. What does your\ngroup suggest astronomers do next? How much effort and money would you recommend be put into\nfinding out more about this planet and why?\nE. Discuss with your group the following question: which is easier to find orbiting a star with instruments we\nhave today: a jovian planet or a proto-planetary disk? Make a list of arguments for each side of this\nquestion.\nF. (This activity should be done when your group has access to the internet.)

When astronomers found the first giant planets with orbits of only a few days, they did not know whether\nthose planets were gaseous and liquid like Jupiter or rocky like Mercury. The observations of HD 209458\nsettled this question because observations of the transit of the star by this planet made it possible to\ndetermine the radius of the planet. Use the data given in the text to estimate the density of this planet,\nand then use that information to explain why it must be a gas giant.\n23. An exoplanetary system has two known planets.

If the star has the same mass as the Sun, what is the semi-major\naxis of the orbits for Planets X and Y?\n24. Kepler\u2019s third law says that the orbital period (in years) is proportional to the square root of the cube of\nthe mean distance (in AU) from the Sun (P\u221da1.5). For mean distances from 0.1 to 32 AU, calculate and plot\na curve showing the expected Keplerian period. For each planet in our solar system, look up the mean\ndistance from the Sun in AU and the orbital period in years and overplot these data on the theoretical\nKeplerian curve.\n25.

Eventually they will exhaust their nuclear fuel and cease to shine.\nBut how do they change during their long lifetimes? And what do these changes mean for the future of Earth?\nWe now turn from the birth of stars to the rest of their life stories. This is not an easy task since stars live much\nlonger than astronomers. Thus, we cannot hope to see the life story of any single star unfold before our eyes\nor telescopes. To learn about their lives, we must survey as many of the stellar inhabitants of the Galaxy as\npossible. With thoroughness and a little luck, we can catch at least a few of them in each stage of their lives. As\nyou\u2019ve learned, stars have many different characteristics, with the differences sometimes resulting from their\ndifferent masses, temperatures, and luminosities, and at other times derived from changes that occur as they\nage. Through a combination of observation and theory, we can use these differences to piece together the life\nstory of a star. 720 22 \u2022 Stars from Adolescence to Old Age\n22.1 Evolution from the Main Sequence to Red Giants\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain the zero-agemain sequence\nDescribe what happens to main-sequence stars of various masses as they exhaust their hydrogen supply\nOne of the best ways to get a \u201csnapshot\u201d of a group of stars is by plotting their properties on anH\u2013R diagram.\nWe have already used the H\u2013R diagram to follow the evolution of protostars up to the time they reach the\nmain sequence. Now we\u2019ll see what happens next.\nOnce a star has reached the main-sequence stage of its life, it derives its energy almost entirely from the\nconversion of hydrogen to helium via the process of nuclear fusion in its core (seeThe Sun: A Nuclear\nPowerhouse). Since hydrogen is the most abundant element in stars, this process can maintain the star\u2019s\nequilibrium for a long time. Thus, all stars remain on the main sequence for most of their lives. Some\nastronomers like to call the main-sequence phase the star\u2019s \u201cprolonged adolescence\u201d or \u201cadulthood\u201d\n(continuing our analogy to the stages in a human life).\nThe left-hand edge of the main-sequence band in the H\u2013R diagram is called thezero-age main sequence(see\nFigure 18.15). We use the termzero-ageto mark the time when a star stops contracting, settles onto the main\nsequence, and begins to fuse hydrogen in its core. The zero-age main sequence is a continuous line in the H\u2013R\ndiagram that shows where stars of different masses but similar chemical composition can be found when they\nbegin to fuse hydrogen.\nSince only 0.7% of the hydrogen used in fusion reactions is converted into energy, fusion does not change the\ntotalmass of the star appreciably during this long period. It does, however, change the chemical composition\nin its central regions where nuclear reactions occur: hydrogen is gradually depleted, and helium accumulates.\nThis change of composition changes the luminosity, temperature, size, and interior structure of the star. When\na star\u2019s luminosity and temperature begin to change, the point that represents the star on the H\u2013R diagram\nmoves away from the zero-age main sequence.\nCalculations show that the temperature and density in the inner region slowly increase as helium accumulates\nin the center of a star. As the temperature gets hotter, each proton acquires more energy of motion on\naverage; this means it is more likely to interact with other protons, and as a result, the rate of fusion also\nincreases. For the proton-proton cycle described inThe Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse, the rate of fusion goes up\nroughly as the temperature to the fourth power.\nIf the rate of fusion goes up, the rate at which energy is being generated also increases, and the luminosity of\nthe star gradually rises. Initially, however, these changes are small, and stars remain within the main-sequence\nband on the H\u2013R diagram for most of their lifetimes.\nEXAMPLE 22.1\nStar Temperature and Rate of Fusion\nIf a star\u2019s temperature were to double, by what factor would its rate of fusion increase?\nSolution\nSince the rate of fusion (like temperature) goes up to the fourth power, it would increase by a factor of 24,\nor 16 times.\nCheck Your Learning\nIf the rate of fusion of a star increased 256 times, by what factor would the temperature increase?\nAccess for free at openstax.org 22.1 \u2022 Evolution from the Main Sequence to Red Giants 721\nAnswer:\nThe temperature would increase by a factor of 2560.25(that is, the 4throot of 256), or 4 times.\nLifetimes on the Main Sequence\nHow many years a star remains in the main-sequence band depends on its mass. You might think that a more\nmassive star, having more fuel, would last longer, but it\u2019s not that simple. The lifetime of a star in a particular\nstage of evolution depends on how much nuclear fuel it has and onhow quicklyit uses up that fuel. (In the\nsame way, how long people can keep spending money depends not only on how much money they have but\nalso on how quickly they spend it. This is why many lottery winners who go on spending sprees quickly wind\nup poor again.) In the case of stars, more massive ones use up their fuel much more quickly than stars of low\nmass.\nThe reason massive stars are such spendthrifts is that, as we saw above, the rate of fusion dependsvery\nstrongly on the star\u2019s core temperature. And what determines how hot a star\u2019s central regions get? It is the\nmassof the star\u2014the weight of the overlying layers determines how high the pressure in the core must be:\nhigher mass requires higher pressure to balance it. Higher pressure, in turn, is produced by higher\ntemperature. The higher the temperature in the central regions, the faster the star races through its\nstorehouse of central hydrogen. Although massive stars have more fuel, they burn it so prodigiously that their\nlifetimes are much shorter than those of their low-mass counterparts. You can also understand now why the\nmost massive main-sequence stars are also the most luminous. Like new rock stars with their first platinum\nalbum, they spend their resources at an astounding rate.\nThe main-sequence lifetimes of stars of different masses are listed inTable 22.1. This table shows that the\nmost massive stars spend only a few million years on the main sequence. A star of 1 solar mass remains there\nfor roughly 10 billion years, while a star of about 0.4 solar mass has a main-sequence lifetime of some 200\nbillion years, which is longer than the current age of the universe. (Bear in mind, however, that every star\nspendsmostof its total lifetime on themain sequence. Stars devote an average of 90% of their lives to\npeacefully fusing hydrogen into helium.)\nLifetimes of Main-Sequence Stars\nSpectral Type Surface Temperature (K) Mass Lifetime on Main Sequence (years)\n(Mass of Sun = 1)\nO5 54,000 40 1 million\nB0 29,200 16 10 million\nA0 9600 3.3 500 million\nF0 7350 1.7 2.7 billion\nG0 6050 1.1 9 billion\nK0 5240 0.8 14 billion\nM0 3750 0.4 200 billion\nTable22.1 722 22 \u2022 Stars from Adolescence to Old Age\nThese results are not merely of academic interest. Human beings developed on a planet around a G-type star.\nThis means that the Sun\u2019s stable main-sequence lifetime is so long that it afforded life on Earth plenty of time\nto evolve. When searching for intelligent life like our own on planets around other stars, it would be a pretty\nbig waste of time to search around O- or B-type stars. These stars remain stable for such a short time that the\ndevelopment of creatures complicated enough to take astronomy courses is very unlikely.\nFrom Main-Sequence Star to Red Giant\nEventually, all the hydrogen in a star\u2019s core, where it is hot enough for fusion reactions, is used up. The core\nthen contains only helium, \u201ccontaminated\u201d by whatever small percentage of heavier elements the star had to\nbegin with. The helium in the core can be thought of as the accumulated \u201cash\u201d from the nuclear \u201cburning\u201d of\nhydrogen during the main-sequence stage.\nEnergy can no longer be generated by hydrogen fusion in the stellar core because the hydrogen is all gone\nand, as we will see, the fusion of helium requires much higher temperatures. Since the central temperature is\nnot yet high enough to fuse helium, there is no nuclear energy source to supply heat to the central region of\nthe star. The long period of stability now ends, gravity again takes over, and the core begins to contract. Once\nmore, the star\u2019s energy is partially supplied by gravitational energy, in the way described by Kelvin and\nHelmholtz (seeSources of Sunshine: Thermal and Gravitational Energy). As the star\u2019s core shrinks, the energy\nof the inward-falling material is converted to heat.\nThe heat generated in this way, like all heat, flows outward to where it is a bit cooler. In the process, the heat\nraises the temperature of a layer of hydrogen that spent the whole long main-sequence time just outside the\ncore. Like an understudy waiting in the wings of a hit Broadway show for a chance at fame and glory, this\nhydrogen was almost (but not quite) hot enough to undergo fusion and take part in the main action that\nsustains the star. Now, the additional heat produced by the shrinking core puts this hydrogen \u201cover the limit,\u201d\nand a shell of hydrogen nuclei just outside the core becomes hot enough for hydrogen fusion to begin.\nNew energy produced by fusion of this hydrogen now pours outward from this shell and begins to heat up\nlayers of the star farther out, causing them to expand. Meanwhile, the helium core continues to contract,\nproducing more heat right around it. This leads to more fusion in the shell of fresh hydrogen outside the core\n(Figure 22.2). The additional fusion produces still more energy, which also flows out into the upper layer of the\nstar.\nFigure22.2Star Layers during and after the Main Sequence.(a) During the main sequence, a star has a core where fusion takes\nplace and a much larger envelope that is too cold for fusion. (b) When the hydrogen in the core is exhausted (made of helium, not\nhydrogen), the core is compressed by gravity and heats up. The additional heat starts hydrogen fusion in a layer just outside the\ncore. Note that these parts of the Sun are not drawn to scale.\nMost stars actually generate more energy each second when they are fusing hydrogen in the shell\nsurrounding the helium core than they did when hydrogen fusion was confined to the central part of the star;\nthus, they increase in luminosity. With all the new energy pouring outward, the outer layers of the star begin\nto expand, and the star eventually grows and grows until it reaches enormous proportions (Figure 22.3).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 22.1 \u2022 Evolution from the Main Sequence to Red Giants 723\nFigure22.3Relative Sizes of Stars.This image compares the size of the Sun to that of Delta Bo\u00f6tis, a giant star, and Xi Cygni, a\nsupergiant. Note that Xi Cygni is so large in comparison to the other two stars that only a small portion of it is visible at the top of the\nframe.\nWhen you take the lid off a pot of boiling water, the steam can expand and it cools down. In the same way, the\nexpansion of a star\u2019s outer layers causes the temperature at the surface to decrease. As it cools, the star\u2019s\noverall color becomes redder. (We saw inRadiation and Spectrathat a red color corresponds to cooler\ntemperature.)\nSo the star becomes simultaneously more luminous and cooler. On the H\u2013R diagram, the star therefore leaves\nthe main-sequence band and moves upward (brighter) and to the right (cooler surface temperature). Over\ntime, massive stars become red supergiants, and lower-mass stars like the Sun become red giants. (We first\ndiscussed such giant stars inThe Stars: A Celestial Census;here we see how such \u201cswollen\u201d stars originate.)\nYou might also say that these stars have \u201csplit personalities\u201d: their cores are contracting while their outer\nlayers are expanding. (Note that red giant stars do not actually look deep red; their colors are more like\norange or orange-red.)\nJust how different are these red giants and supergiants from a main-sequence star?Table 22.2compares the\nSunwith the red supergiantBetelgeuse, which is visible above Orion\u2019s belt as the bright red star that marks\nthe hunter\u2019s armpit. Relative to the Sun, this supergiant has a much larger radius, a much lower average\ndensity, a cooler surface, and a much hotter core.\nComparing a Supergiant with the Sun\nProperty Sun Betelgeuse\nMass (2 \u00d7 1033g) 1 16\nRadius (km) 700,000 500,000,000\nSurface temperature (K) 5,800 3,600\nCore temperature (K) 15,000,000 160,000,000\nLuminosity (4 \u00d7 1026W) 1 46,000\nAverage density (g/cm3) 1.4 1.3 \u00d7 10\u20137\nTable22.2 724 22 \u2022 Stars from Adolescence to Old Age\nProperty Sun Betelgeuse\nAge (millions of years) 4,500 10\nTable22.2\nRed giants can become so large that if we were to replace the Sun with one of them, its outer atmosphere\nwould extend to the orbit of Mars or even beyond (Figure 22.4). This is the next stage in the life of a star as it\nmoves (to continue our analogy to human lives) from its long period of \u201cyouth\u201d and \u201cadulthood\u201d to \u201cold age.\u201d\nBy considering the relative ages of the Sun and Betelgeuse, we can also see that the idea that \u201cbigger stars die\nfaster\u201d is indeed true here. Betelgeuse is a mere 10 million years old, which is relatively young compared with\nour Sun\u2019s 4.5 billion years, but it is already nearing its death throes as a red supergiant.\nFigure22.4Betelgeuse.Betelgeuseis in the constellation Orion, the hunter; in the right image, it is marked with a yellow \u201cX\u201d near\nthe top left. In the left image, we see it in ultraviolet with the Hubble Space Telescope, in the first direct image ever made of the\nsurface of another star. As shown by the scale at the bottom, Betelgeuse has an extended atmosphere so large that, if it were at the\ncenter of our solar system, it would stretch past the orbit of Jupiter. (credit: Modification of work by Andrea Dupree (Harvard-\nSmithsonian CfA), Ronald Gilliland (STScI), NASA and ESA)\nModels for Evolution to the Giant Stage\nAs we discussed earlier, astronomers can construct computer models of stars with different masses and\ncompositions to see how stars change throughout their lives.Figure 22.5, which is based on theoretical\ncalculations by University of Illinois astronomer Icko Iben, shows an H\u2013R diagram with several tracks of\nevolution from the main sequence to the giant stage. Tracks are shown for stars with different masses (from\n0.5 to 15 times the mass of our Sun) and with chemical compositions similar to that of the Sun. The red line is\nthe initial or zero-age main sequence. The numbers along the tracks indicate the time, in years, required for\neach star to reach those points in their evolution after leaving the main sequence. Once again, you can see\nthat the more massive a star is, the more quickly it goes through each stage in its life.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 22.1 \u2022 Evolution from the Main Sequence to Red Giants 725\nFigure22.5Evolutionary Tracks of Stars of Different Masses.The solid black lines show the predicted evolution from the main\nsequence through the red giant or supergiant stage on the H\u2013R diagram. Each track is labeled with the mass of the star it is\ndescribing. The numbers show how many years each star takes to become a giant. The red line is the zero-age main sequence. While\ntheorists debate the exact number of years shown here, our main point should be clear. The more massive the star, the shorter time\nit takes for each stage in its life.\nNote that the most massive star in this diagram has a mass similar to that ofBetelgeuse, and so its\nevolutionary track shows approximately the history of Betelgeuse. The track for a 1-solar-mass star shows that\nthe Sun is still in the main-sequence phase of evolution, since it is only about 4.5 billion years old. It will be\nbillions of years before the Sun begins its own \u201cclimb\u201d away from the main sequence\u2014the expansion of its\nouter layers that will make it a red giant.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nUse theStar in a Box simulation(https://openstax.org/l/30starinbox)to explore the evolution of stars of\ndifferent masses. Select the star\u2019s mass, and then hit play to see how its luminosity, temperature, and size\nchange during its lifetime. 726 22 \u2022 Stars from Adolescence to Old Age\n22.2 Star Clusters\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain how star clusters help us understand the stages ofstellar evolution\nList the different types ofstar clusters and describe how they differ in number of stars, structure, and age\nExplain why the chemical composition of globular clusters is different from that of open clusters\nThe preceding description of stellar evolution is based on calculations. However, no star completes its main-\nsequence lifetime or its evolution to a red giant quickly enough for us to observe these structural changes as\nthey happen. Fortunately, nature has provided us with an indirect way to test our calculations.\nInstead of observing the evolution of a single star, we can look at a group orclusterof stars. We look for a\ngroup of stars that is very close together in space, held together by gravity, often moving around a common\ncenter. Then it is reasonable to assume that the individual stars in the group all formed at nearly the same\ntime, from the same cloud, and with the same composition. We expect that these stars will differ only in mass.\nAnd their masses determine how quickly they go through each stage of their lives.\nSince stars with higher masses evolve more quickly, we can find clusters in which massive stars have already\ncompleted their main-sequence phase of evolution and become red giants, while stars of lower mass in the\nsame cluster are still on the main sequence, or even\u2014if the cluster is very young\u2014undergoing pre-main-\nsequence gravitational contraction. We can see many stages of stellar evolution among the members of a\nsingle cluster, and we can see whether our models can explain why the H\u2013R diagrams of clusters of different\nages look the way they do.\nThe three basic types of clusters astronomers have discovered areglobular clusters,open clusters, andstellar\nassociations. Their properties are summarized inTable 22.3. As we will see in the next section of this chapter,\nglobular clusters contain only very old stars, whereas open clusters and associations contain young stars.\nCharacteristics of Star Clusters\nCharacteristic Globular Open Clusters Associations\nClusters\nNumber in the\n150 Thousands Thousands\nGalaxy\nHalo and\nLocation in the\ncentral Disk (and spiral arms) Spiral arms\nGalaxy\nbulge\nDiameter (in\n50\u2013450 <30 100\u2013500\nlight-years)\nMassM 104\u2013106 102\u2013103 102\u2013103\nSun\nNumber of\n104\u2013106 50\u20131000 102\u2013104\nstars\nTable22.3\nAccess for free at openstax.org 22.2 \u2022 Star Clusters 727\nCharacteristic Globular Open Clusters Associations\nClusters\nColor of\nRed Red or blue Blue\nbrightest stars\nLuminosity of\n104\u2013106 102\u2013106 104\u2013107\ncluster (L )\nSun\nBillions of A few hundred million years to, in the case of unusually Up to about\nTypical ages\nyears large clusters, more than a billion years 107years\nTable22.3\nGlobular Clusters\nGlobular clusterswere given this name because they are nearly symmetrical round systems of, typically,\nhundreds of thousands of stars. The most massive globular cluster in our own Galaxy isOmega Centauri,\nwhich is about 16,000 light-years away and contains several million stars (Figure 22.6). Note that the brightest\nstars in this cluster, which are red giants that have already completed the main-sequence phase of their\nevolution, are red-orange in color. These stars have typical surface temperatures around 4000 K. As we will\nsee, globular clusters are among the oldest parts of our Milky Way Galaxy.\nFigure22.6Omega Centauri.(a) Located at about 16,000 light-years away,Omega Centauriis the most massive globular cluster in\nour Galaxy. It contains several million stars. (b) This image, taken with the Hubble Space Telescope, zooms in near the center of\nOmega Centauri. The image is about 6.3 light-years wide. The most numerous stars in the image, which are yellow-white in color, are\nmain-sequence stars similar to our Sun. The brightest stars are red giants that have begun to exhaust their hydrogen fuel and have\nexpanded to about 100 times the diameter of our Sun. The blue stars have started helium fusion. (credit a: modification of work by\nNASA, ESA and the Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA); credit b: modification of work by NASA, ESA, and the Hubble SM4 ERO Team)\nWhat would it be like to live inside a globular cluster? In the dense central regions, the stars would be roughly\na million times closer together than in our own neighborhood. If Earth orbited one of the inner stars in a\nglobular cluster, the nearest stars would be light-months, not light-years, away. They would still appear as\npoints of light, but would be brighter than any of the stars we see in our own sky. The Milky Way would 728 22 \u2022 Stars from Adolescence to Old Age\nprobably be difficult to see through the bright haze of starlight produced by the cluster.\nAbout 150 globular clusters are known in our Galaxy. Most of them are in a spherical halo (or cloud)\nsurrounding the flat disk formed by the majority of our Galaxy\u2019s stars. All the globular clusters are very far\nfrom the Sun, and some are found at distances of 60,000 light-years or more from the main disk of the Milky\nWay. The diameters of globular star clusters range from 50 light-years to more than 450 light-years.\nOpen Clusters\nOpen clustersare found in the disk of the Galaxy. They have a range of ages, some as old as, or even older\nthan, our Sun. The youngest open clusters are still associated with the interstellar matter from which they\nformed. Open clusters are smaller than globular clusters, usually having diameters of less than 30 light-years,\nand they typically contain only several dozen to several hundreds of stars (Figure 22.7). The stars in open\nclusters usually appear well separated from one another, even in the central regions, which explains why they\nare called \u201copen.\u201d Our Galaxy contains thousands of open clusters, but we can see only a small fraction of\nthem. Interstellar dust, which is also concentrated in the disk, dims the light of more distant clusters so much\nthat they are undetectable.\nFigure22.7Jewel Box (NGC 4755).This open cluster of young, bright stars is about 6400 light-years away from the Sun. Note the\ncontrast in color between the bright yellow supergiant and the hot blue main-sequence stars. The name comes from John Herschel\u2019s\nnineteenth-century description of it as \u201ca casket of variously colored precious stones.\u201d (credit: ESO/Y. Beletsky)\nAlthough the individual stars in an open cluster can survive for billions of years, they typically remain together\nas a cluster for only a few million years, or at most, a few hundred million years. There are several reasons for\nthis. In small open clusters, the average speed of the member stars within the cluster may be higher than the\n1\ncluster\u2019s escape velocity, and the stars will gradually \u201cevaporate\u201d from the cluster. Close encounters of\nmember stars may also increase the velocity of one of the members beyond the escape velocity. Every few\nhundred million years or so, the cluster may have a close encounter with a giant molecular cloud, and the\ngravitational force exerted by the cloud may tear the cluster apart.\nSeveral open clusters are visible to the unaided eye. Most famous among them is thePleiades(Figure 20.13),\nwhich appears as a tiny group of six stars (some people can see even more than six, and the Pleiades is\nsometimes called the Seven Sisters). This cluster is arranged like a small dipping spoon and is seen in the\nconstellation of Taurus, the bull. A good pair of binoculars shows dozens of stars in the cluster, and a telescope\n1 Escape velocity is the speed needed to overcome the gravity of some object or group of objects. The rockets we send up from\nEarth, for example, must travel faster than the escape velocity of our planet to be able to get to other worlds.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 22.3 \u2022 Checking Out the Theory 729\nreveals hundreds. (A car company, Subaru, takes its name from the Japanese term for this cluster; you can see\nthe star group on the Subaru logo.)\nThe Hyades is another famous open cluster in the constellation of Taurus the bull. To the naked eye, it appears\nas a V-shaped group of faint stars marking the face of the bull. Telescopes show that Hyades actually contains\nmore than 200 stars.\nStellar Associations\nAnassociationis a group of extremely young stars, typically containing 5 to 50 hot, bright O and B stars\nscattered over a region of space some 100\u2013500 light-years in diameter. As an example, most of the stars in the\nconstellation Orion form one of the neareststellar associations. Associations also contain hundreds to\nthousands of low-mass stars, but these are much fainter and less conspicuous. The presence of really hot,\nluminous stars indicates that star formation in the association has occurred in the last million years or so.\nSince O stars go through their entire lives in only about a million years, they would not still be around unless\nstar formation has occurred recently. It is therefore not surprising that associations are found in regions rich\nin the gas and dust required to form new stars. It\u2019s like a brand new building still surrounded by some of the\nconstruction materials used to build it and with the landscape still showing signs of construction. On the other\nhand, because associations, like ordinary open clusters, lie in regions occupied by dusty interstellar matter,\nmany are hidden from our view.\n22.3 Checking Out the Theory\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain how theH\u2013R diagramof a star cluster can be related to the cluster\u2019s age and the stages of\nevolution of its stellar members\nDescribe how the main-sequence turnoff of a cluster reveals its age\nIn the previous section, we indicated that open clusters are younger than globular clusters, and associations\nare typically even younger. In this section, we will show how we determine the ages of these star clusters. The\nkey observation is that the stars in these different types of clusters are found in different places in the H\u2013R\ndiagram, and we can use their locations in the diagram in combination with theoretical calculations to\nestimate how long they have lived.\nH\u2013R Diagrams of Young Clusters\nWhat does theory predict for the H\u2013R diagram of a cluster whose stars have recently condensed from an\ninterstellar cloud? Remember that at every stage of evolution, massive stars evolve more quickly than their\nlower-mass counterparts. After a few million years (\u201crecently\u201d for astronomers), the most massive stars should\nhave completed their contraction phase and be on the main sequence, while the less massive ones should be\noff to the right, still on their way to the main sequence. These ideas are illustrated inFigure 22.8, which shows\nthe H\u2013R diagram calculated by R. Kippenhahn and his associates at Munich University for a hypothetical cluster\nwith an age of 3 million years. 730 22 \u2022 Stars from Adolescence to Old Age\nFigure22.8Young Cluster H\u2013R Diagram.We see an H\u2013R diagram for a hypothetical young cluster with an age of 3 million years.\nNote that the high-mass (high-luminosity) stars have already arrived at the main-sequence stage of their lives, while the lower-mass\n(lower-luminosity) stars are still contracting toward the zero-age main sequence (the red line) and are not yet hot enough to derive\nall of their energy from the fusion of hydrogen.\nThere are real star clusters that fit this description. The first to be studied (in about 1950) was NGC 2264, which\nis still associated with the region of gas and dust from which it was born (Figure 22.9).\nFigure22.9Young Cluster NGC 2264.Located about 2600 light-years from us, this region of newly formed stars, known as the\nChristmas Tree Cluster, is a complex mixture of hydrogen gas (which is ionized by hot embedded stars and shown in red), dark\nobscuring dust lanes, and brilliant young stars. The image shows a scene about 30 light-years across. (credit: ESO)\nThe NGC 2264 cluster\u2019s H\u2013R diagram is shown inFigure 22.10. The cluster in the middle of the Orion Nebula\n(shown inFigure 21.4andFigure 21.5) is in a similar stage of evolution.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 22.3 \u2022 Checking Out the Theory 731\nFigure22.10NGC 2264 H\u2013R Diagram.Compare this H\u2013R diagram to that inFigure 22.8; although the points scatter a bit more here,\nthe theoretical and observational diagrams are remarkably, and satisfyingly, similar.\nAs clusters get older, their H\u2013R diagrams begin to change. After a short time (less than a million years after\nthey reach the main sequence), the most massive stars use up the hydrogen in their cores and evolve off the\nmain sequence to become red giants and supergiants. As more time passes, stars of lower mass begin to leave\nthe main sequence and make their way to the upper right of the H\u2013R diagram.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTo see the evolution of a star cluster in a dwarf galaxy, you can watch thisbrief animation\n(https://openstax.org/l/30StarCluster)of how its H\u2013R diagram changes.\nFigure 22.11is a photograph of NGC 3293, a cluster that is about 10 million years old.

The most massive stars,\nhowever, exhaust their nuclear fuel more rapidly and hence evolve more quickly than stars of low mass. As stars evolve, they become\nredder. The bright orange star in NGC 3293 is the member of the cluster that has evolved most rapidly. (credit: ESO/G. Beccari)\nFigure 22.12shows the H\u2013R diagram of the open cluster M41, which is roughly 100 million years old; by this\ntime, a significant number of stars have moved off to the right and become red giants. Note the gap that\nappears in this H\u2013R diagram between the stars near the main sequence and the red giants. A gap does not\nnecessarily imply that stars avoid a region of certain temperatures and luminosities. In this case, it simply\nrepresents a domain of temperature and luminosity through which stars evolve very quickly. We see a gap for\nM41 because at this particular moment, we have not caught a star in the process of scurrying across this part\nof the diagram.\nFigure22.12Cluster M41.(a) Cluster M41 is older than NGC 2264 (seeFigure 22.10) and contains several red giants. Some of its\nmore massive stars are no longer close to the zero-age main sequence (red line). (b) This ground-based photograph shows the open\ncluster M41.

(credit b: modification of work by NOAO/AURA/NSF)\nH\u2013R Diagrams of Older Clusters\nAfter 4 billion years have passed, many more stars, including stars that are only a few times more massive\nthan the Sun, have left the main sequence (Figure 22.13). This means that no stars are left near the top of the\nmain sequence; only the low-mass stars near the bottom remain. The older the cluster, the lower the point on\nthe main sequence (and the lower the mass of the stars) where stars begin to move toward the red giant\nregion. The location in the H\u2013R diagram where the stars have begun to leave the main sequence is called the\nmain-sequence turnoff.\nFigure22.13H\u2013R Diagram for an Older Cluster.We see the H\u2013R diagram for a hypothetical older cluster at an age of 4.24 billion\nyears. Note that most of the stars on the upper part of the main sequence have turned off toward the red-giant region. And the most\nmassive stars in the cluster have already died and are no longer on the diagram.\nThe oldest clusters of all are the globular clusters.Figure 22.14shows the H\u2013R diagram of globular cluster 47\nTucanae. Notice that the luminosity and temperature scales are different from those of the other H\u2013R\ndiagrams in this chapter. InFigure 22.13, for example, the luminosity scale on the left side of the diagram goes\nfrom 0.1 to 100,000 times the Sun\u2019s luminosity. But inFigure 22.14, the luminosity scale has been significantly\nreduced in extent. So many stars in this old cluster have had time to turn off the main sequence that only the\nvery bottom of the main sequence remains. 734 22 \u2022 Stars from Adolescence to Old Age\nFigure22.14Cluster 47 Tucanae.This H\u2013R diagram is for the globular cluster 47. Note that the scale of luminosity differs from that\nof the other H\u2013R diagrams in this chapter. We are only focusing on the lower portion of the main sequence, the only part where stars\nstill remain in this old cluster.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCheck out this brief NASA video with a3-D visualization(https://openstax.org/l/30HRDiagram)of how an\nH\u2013R diagram is created for the globular cluster Omega Centauri.\nJust how old are the different clusters we have been discussing? To get their actual ages (in years), we must\ncompare the appearances of ourcalculatedH\u2013R diagrams of different ages toobservedH\u2013R diagrams of real\nclusters. In practice, astronomers use the position at the top of the main sequence (that is, the luminosity at\nwhich stars begin to move off the main sequence to become red giants) as a measure of the age of a cluster\n(the main-sequence turnoff we discussed previously). For example, we can compare the luminosities of the\nbrightest stars that are still on the main sequence inFigure 22.10andFigure 22.13.\nUsing this method, some associations and open clusters turn out to be as young as 1 million years old, while\nothers are several hundred million years old. Once all of the interstellar matter surrounding a cluster has been\nused to form stars or has dispersed and moved away from the cluster, star formation ceases, and stars of\nprogressively lower mass move off the main sequence, as shown inFigure 22.10,Figure 22.12, andFigure\n22.13.\nTo our surprise, even the youngest of the globular clusters in our Galaxy are found to be older than the oldest\nopen cluster. All of the globular clusters have main sequences that turn off at a luminosity less than that of the\nSun. Star formation in these crowded systems ceased billions of years ago, and no new stars are coming on to\nthe main sequence to replace the ones that have turned off (seeFigure 22.15).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 22.4 \u2022 Further Evolution of Stars 735\nFigure22.15H\u2013R Diagrams for Clusters of Different Ages.This sketch shows how the turn-off point from the main sequence gets\nlower as we make H\u2013R diagrams for clusters that are older and older.\nIndeed, the globular clusters are the oldest structures in our Galaxy (and in other galaxies as well). The\nyoungest have ages of about 11 billion years and some appear to be even older. Since these are the oldest\nobjects we know of, this estimate is one of the best limits we have on the age of the universe itself\u2014it must be\nat least 11 billion years old. We will return to the fascinating question of determining the age of the entire\nuniverse in the chapter onThe Big Bang.\n22.4 Further Evolution of Stars\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain what happens in a star\u2019s core when all of the hydrogen has been used up\nDefine \u201cplanetary nebulae\u201d and discuss their origin\nDiscuss the creation of new chemical elements during the late stages ofstellar evolution\nThe \u201clife story\u201d we have related so far applies to almost all stars: each starts as a contracting protostar, then\nlives most of its life as a stable main-sequence star, and eventually moves off the main sequence toward the\nred-giant region.\nAs we have seen, the pace at which each star goes through these stages depends on its mass, with more\nmassive stars evolving more quickly. But after this point, the life stories of stars of different masses diverge,\nwith a wider range of possible behavior according to their masses, their compositions, and the presence of any\nnearby companion stars.\nBecause we have written this book for students taking their first astronomy course, we will recount a\nsimplified version of what happens to stars as they move toward the final stages in their lives. We will (perhaps\nto your heartfelt relief) not delve into all the possible ways aging stars can behave and the strange things that\nhappen when a star is orbited by a second star in a binary system. Instead, we will focus only on the key stages\nin the evolution of single stars and show how the evolution of high-mass stars differs from that of low-mass\nstars (such as our Sun).\nHelium Fusion\nLet\u2019s begin by considering stars with composition like that of the Sun and whoseinitialmasses are\ncomparatively low\u2014no more than about twice the mass of our Sun. (Such mass may not seem too low, but\nstars with masses less than this all behave in a fairly similar fashion. We will see what happens to more\nmassive stars in the next section.) Because there are many more low-mass stars than high-mass stars in the\nMilky Way, the vast majority of stars\u2014including our Sun\u2014follow the scenario we are about to relate. By the\nway, we carefully used the terminitial massesof stars because, as we will see, stars can lose quite a bit of mass 736 22 \u2022 Stars from Adolescence to Old Age\nin the process of aging and dying.\nRemember that red giants start out with a helium core where no energy generation is taking place,\nsurrounded by a shell where hydrogen is undergoingfusion. The core, having no source of energy to oppose\nthe inward pull of gravity, is shrinking and growing hotter. As time goes on, the temperature in the core can\nrise to much hotter values than it had in its main-sequence days. Once it reaches a temperature of 100 million\nK (but not before such point), three helium atoms can begin to fuse to form a single carbon nucleus. This\nprocess is called thetriple-alpha process, so named because physicists call the nucleus of the helium atom an\nalpha particle.\nWhen the triple-alpha process begins in low-mass (about 0.8 to 2.0 solar masses) stars, calculations show that\nthe entire core is ignited in a quick burst of fusion called ahelium flash. (More massive stars also ignite\nhelium but more gradually and not with a flash.) As soon as the temperature at the center of the star becomes\nhigh enough to start the triple-alpha process, the extra energy released is transmitted quickly through the\nentire helium core, producing very rapid heating. The heating speeds up the nuclear reactions, which provide\nmore heating, and which accelerates the nuclear reactions even more. We have runaway generation of energy,\nwhich reignites the entire helium core in a flash.\nYou might wonder why the next major step in nuclear fusion in stars involves three helium nuclei and not just\ntwo. Although it is a lot easier to get two helium nuclei to collide, the product of this collision is not stable and\nfalls apart very quickly. It takes three helium nuclei coming together simultaneously to make a stable nuclear\nstructure. Given that each helium nucleus has two positive protons and that such protons repel one another,\nyou can begin to see the problem. It takes a temperature of 100 million K to slam three helium nuclei (six\nprotons) together and make them stick. But when that happens, the star produces a carbon nucleus.\nASTRONOMY BASICS\nStars in Your Little Finger\nStop reading for a moment and look at your little finger. It\u2019s full of carbon atoms because carbon is a\nfundamental chemical building block for life on Earth. Each of those carbon atoms was once inside a red\ngiant star and was fused from helium nuclei in the triple-alpha process. All the carbon on Earth\u2014in you, in\nthe charcoal you use for barbecuing, and in the diamonds you might exchange with a loved one\u2014was\n\u201ccooked up\u201d by previous generations of stars. How the carbon atoms (and other elements) made their way\nfrom inside some of those stars to become part of Earth is something we will discuss in the next chapter.\nFor now, we want to emphasize that our description of stellar evolution is, in a very real sense, the story of\nour own cosmic \u201croots\u201d\u2014the history of how our own atoms originated among the stars. We are made of\n\u201cstar-stuff.\u201d\nBecoming a Giant Again\nAfter the helium flash, the star, having survived the \u201cenergy crisis\u201d that followed the end of the main-sequence\nstage and the exhaustion of the hydrogen fuel at its center, finds its balance again. As the star readjusts to the\nrelease of energy from the triple-alpha process in its core, its internal structure changes once more: its surface\ntemperature increases and its overall luminosity decreases. The point that represents the star on the H\u2013R\ndiagram thus moves to a new position to the left of and somewhat below its place as a red giant (Figure 22.16).\nThe star then continues to fuse the helium in its core for a while, returning to the kind of equilibrium between\npressure and gravity that characterized the main-sequence stage. During this time, a newly formed carbon\nnucleus at the center of the star can sometimes be joined by another helium nucleus to produce a nucleus of\noxygen\u2014another building block of life.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 22.4 \u2022 Further Evolution of Stars 737\nFigure22.16Evolution of a Star Like the Sun on an H\u2013R Diagram.Each stage in the star\u2019s life is labeled. (a) The star evolves from\nthe main sequence to be a red giant, decreasing in surface temperature and increasing in luminosity. (b) A helium flash occurs,\nleading to a readjustment of the star\u2019s internal structure and to (c) a brief period of stability during which helium is fused to carbon\nand oxygen in the core (in the process the star becomes hotter and less luminous than it was as a red giant). (d) After the central\nhelium is exhausted, the star becomes a giant again and moves to higher luminosity and lower temperature. By this time, however,\nthe star has exhausted its inner resources and will soon begin to die. Where the evolutionary track becomes a dashed line, the\nchanges are so rapid that they are difficult to model.\nHowever, at a temperature of 100 million K, the inner core is converting its helium fuel to carbon (and a bit of\noxygen) at a rapid rate. Thus, the new period of stability cannot last very long: it is far shorter than the main-\nsequence stage. Soon, all the helium hot enough for fusion will be used up, just like the hot hydrogen that was\nused up earlier in the star\u2019s evolution. Once again, the inner core will not be able to generate energy via\nfusion. Once more, gravity will take over, and the core will start to shrink again. We can think of stellar\nevolution as a story of a constant struggle against gravitational collapse. A star can avoid collapsing as long as\nit can tap energy sources, but once any particular fuel is used up, it starts to collapse again.\nThe star\u2019s situation is analogous to the end of the main-sequence stage (when the central hydrogen got used\nup), but the star now has a somewhat more complicated structure. Again, the star\u2019s core begins to collapse\nunder its own weight. Heat released by the shrinking of the carbon and oxygen core flows into a shell of\nhelium just above the core. This helium, which had not been hot enough for fusion into carbon earlier, is\nheated just enough for fusion to begin and to generate a new flow of energy.\nFarther out in the star, there is also a shell where fresh hydrogen has been heated enough to fuse helium. The\nstar now has a multi-layered structure like an onion: a carbon-oxygen core, surrounded by a shell of helium\nfusion, a layer of helium, a shell of hydrogen fusion, and finally, the extended outer layers of the star (see\nFigure 22.17). As energy flows outward from the two fusion shells, once again the outer regions of the star\nbegin to expand. Its brief period of stability is over; the star moves back to the red-giant domain on the H\u2013R\ndiagram for a short time (seeFigure 22.16). But this is a brief and final burst of glory. 738 22 \u2022 Stars from Adolescence to Old Age\nFigure22.17Layers inside a Low-Mass Star before Death.Here we see the layers inside a star with an initial mass that is less than\ntwice the mass of the Sun. These include, from the center outward, the carbon-oxygen core, a layer of helium hot enough to fuse, a\nlayer of cooler helium, a layer of hydrogen hot enough to fuse, and then cooler hydrogen beyond.\nRecall that the last time the star was in this predicament, helium fusion came to its rescue. The temperature at\nthe star\u2019s center eventually became hot enough for theproductof the previous step of fusion (helium) to\nbecome thefuelfor the next step (helium fusing into carbon). But the step after the fusion of helium nuclei\nrequires a temperature so hot that the kinds of lower-mass stars (less than 2 solar masses) we are discussing\nsimply cannot compress their cores to reach it. No further types of fusion are possible for such a star.\nIn a star with a mass similar to that of the Sun, the formation of a carbon-oxygen core thus marks the end of\nthe generation of nuclear energy at the center of the star. The star must now confront the fact that its death is\nnear. We will discuss how stars like this end their lives inThe Death of Stars, but in the meantime,Table 22.4\nsummarizes the stages discussed so far in the life of a star with the same mass as that of the Sun. One thing\nthat gives us confidence in our calculations of stellar evolution is that when we make H\u2013R diagrams of older\nclusters, we actually see stars in each of the stages that we have been discussing.\nThe Evolution of a Star with the Sun\u2019s Mass\nStage Time in This Stage Surface Temperature Luminosity Diameter\n(years) (K) (L ) (Sun = 1)\nSun\nMain sequence 11 billion 6000 1 1\nBecomes red 2300 at\n1.3 billion 3100 at minimum 165\ngiant maximum\nHelium fusion 100 million 4800 50 10\nGiant again 20 million 3100 5200 180\nTable22.4\nAccess for free at openstax.org 22.4 \u2022 Further Evolution of Stars 739\nMass Loss from Red-Giant Stars and the Formation of Planetary Nebulae\n2\nWhen stars swell up to become red giants, they have very large radii and therefore a low escape velocity.\nRadiation pressure, stellar pulsations, and violent events like the helium flash can all drive atoms in the outer\natmosphere away from the star, and cause it to lose a substantial fraction of its mass into space. Astronomers\nestimate that by the time a star like the Sun reaches the point of the helium flash, for example, it will have lost\nas much as 25% of its mass. And it can lose still more mass when it ascends the red-giant branch for the\nsecond time. As a result, aging stars are surrounded by one or more expanding shells of gas, each containing\nas much as 10\u201320% of the Sun\u2019s mass (or 0.1\u20130.2M ).\nSun\nWhen nuclear energy generation in the carbon-oxygen core ceases, the star\u2019s core begins to shrink again and\nto heat up as it gets more and more compressed. (Remember that this compression will not be halted by\nanother type of fusion in these low-mass stars.) The whole star follows along, shrinking and also becoming\nvery hot\u2014reaching surface temperatures as high as 100,000 K. Such hot stars are very strong sources of stellar\nwinds and ultraviolet radiation, which sweep outward into the shells of material ejected when the star was a\nred giant. The winds and the ultraviolet radiation heat the shells, ionize them, and set them aglow (just as\nultraviolet radiation from hot, young stars produces H II regions; seeBetween the Stars: Gas and Dust in\nSpace).\nThe result is the creation of some of the most beautiful objects in the cosmos (see the gallery inFigure 22.18\nandFigure 22.1). These objects were given an extremely misleading name when first found in the eighteenth\ncentury:planetary nebulae. The name is derived from the fact that a few planetary nebulae, when viewed\nthrough a small telescope, have a round shape bearing a superficial resemblance to planets. Actually, they\nhave nothing to do with planets, but once names are put into regular use in astronomy, it is extremely difficult\nto change them. There are tens of thousands of planetary nebulae in our own Galaxy, although many are\nhidden from view because their light is absorbed by interstellar dust.\n2 Recall that the force of gravity depends not only on the mass doing the pulling, but also on our distance from the center of\ngravity. As a red giant star gets a lot bigger, a point on the surface of the star is now farther from the center, and thus has less\ngravity. That\u2019s why the speed needed to escape the star goes down. 740 22 \u2022 Stars from Adolescence to Old Age\nFigure22.18Gallery of Planetary Nebulae.This series of beautiful images depicting some intriguing planetary nebulae highlights\nthe capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope. (a) Perhaps the best known planetary nebula is the Ring Nebula (M57), located about\n2000 light-years away in the constellation of Lyra. The ring is about 1 light-year in diameter, and the central star has a temperature of\nabout 120,000 \u00b0C. Careful study of this image has shown scientists that, instead of looking at a spherical shell around this dying star,\nwe may be looking down the barrel of a tube or cone. The blue region shows emission from very hot helium, which is located very\nclose to the star; the red region isolates emission from ionized nitrogen, which is radiated by the coolest gas farthest from the star;\nand the green region represents oxygen emission, which is produced at intermediate temperatures and is at an intermediate\ndistance from the star. (b) This planetary nebula, M2-9, is an example of a butterfly nebula. The central star (which is part of a binary\nsystem) has ejected mass preferentially in two opposite directions. In other images, a disk, perpendicular to the two long streams of\ngas, can be seen around the two stars in the middle. The stellar outburst that resulted in the expulsion of matter occurred about\n1200 years ago. Neutral oxygen is shown in red, once-ionized nitrogen in green, and twice-ionized oxygen in blue. The planetary\nnebula is about 2100 light-years away in the constellation of Ophiuchus. (c) In this image of the planetary nebula NGC 6751, the blue\nregions mark the hottest gas, which forms a ring around the central star. The orange and red regions show the locations of cooler\ngas. The origin of these cool streamers is not known, but their shapes indicate that they are affected by radiation and stellar winds\nfrom the hot star at the center. The temperature of the star is about 140,000 \u00b0C. The diameter of the nebula is about 600 times larger\nthan the diameter of our solar system. The nebula is about 6500 light-years away in the constellation of Aquila. (d) This image of the\nplanetary nebula NGC 7027 shows several stages of mass loss. The faint blue concentric shells surrounding the central region\nidentify the mass that was shed slowly from the surface of the star when it became a red giant. Somewhat later, the remaining outer\nlayers were ejected but not in a spherically symmetric way. The dense clouds formed by this late ejection produce the bright inner\nregions. The hot central star can be seen faintly near the center of the nebulosity. NGC 7027 is about 3000 light-years away in the\ndirection of the constellation of Cygnus.

Bond (STScI) and NASA)\nAsFigure 22.18shows, sometimes a planetary nebula appears to be a simple ring. Others have faint shells\nsurrounding the bright ring, which is evidence that there were multiple episodes ofmass losswhen the star\nwas a red giant (see image (d) inFigure 22.18). In a few cases, we see two lobes of matter flowing in opposite\ndirections. Many astronomers think that a considerable number of planetary nebulae basically consist of the\nsame structure, but that the shape we see depends on the viewing angle (Figure 22.19). According to this idea,\nthe dying star is surrounded by a very dense, doughnut-shaped disk of gas. (Theorists do not yet have a\ndefinite explanation for why the dying star should produce this ring, but many believe that binary stars, which\nare common, are involved.)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 22.4 \u2022 Further Evolution of Stars 741\nFigure22.19Model to Explain the Different Shapes of Planetary Nebulae.The range of different shapes that we see among\nplanetary nebulae may, in many cases, arise from the same geometric shape, but seen from a variety of viewing directions. The basic\nshape is a hot central star surrounded by a thick torus (or doughnut-shaped disk) of gas. The star\u2019s wind cannot flow out into space\nvery easily in the direction of the torus, but can escape more freely in the two directions perpendicular to it. If we view the nebula\nalong the direction of the flow (Helix Nebula), it will appear nearly circular (like looking directly down into an empty ice-cream cone).\nIf we look along the equator of the torus, we see both outflows and a very elongated shape (Hubble 5). Current research on\nplanetary nebulae focuses on the reasons for having a torus around the star in the first place. Many astronomers suggest that the\nbasic cause may be that many of the central stars are actually close binary stars, rather than single stars. (credit \u201cHubble 5\u201d:\nmodification of work by Bruce Balick (University of Washington), Vincent Icke (Leiden University, The Netherlands), Garrelt Mellema\n(Stockholm University), and NASA/ESA; credit \u201cHelix\u201d: modification of work by NASA, ESA, C.R. O\u2019Dell (Vanderbilt University), and M.\nMeixner, P. McCullough)\nAs the star continues to lose mass, any less dense gas that leaves the star cannot penetrate the torus, but the\ngascanflow outward in directions perpendicular to the disk. If we look perpendicular to the direction of\noutflow, we see the disk and both of the outward flows. If we look \u201cdown the barrel\u201d and into the flows, we see\na ring. At intermediate angles, we may see wonderfully complex structures. Compare the viewpoints inFigure\n22.19with the images inFigure 22.18.\nPlanetary nebula shells usually expand at speeds of 20\u201330 km/s, and a typical planetary nebula has a diameter\nof about 1 light-year. If we assume that the gas shell has expanded at a constant speed, we can calculate that\nthe shells of all the planetary nebulae visible to us were ejected within the past 50,000 years at most. After this\namount of time, the shells have expanded so much that they are too thin and tenuous to be seen. That\u2019s a\npretty short time that each planetary nebula can be observed (when compared to the whole lifetime of the\nstar). Given the number of such nebulae we nevertheless see, we must conclude that a large fraction of all\nstars evolve through the planetary nebula phase. Since we saw that low-mass stars are much more common\nthan high-mass stars, this confirms our view of planetary nebulae as sort of \u201clast gasp\u201d of low-mass star\nevolution. 742 22 \u2022 Stars from Adolescence to Old Age\nCosmic Recycling\nThe loss of mass by dying stars is a key step in the gigantic cosmic recycling scheme we discussed inBetween\nthe Stars: Gas and Dust in Space. Remember that stars form from vast clouds of gas and dust. As they end\ntheir lives, stars return part of their gas to the galactic reservoirs of raw material. Eventually, some of the\nexpelled material from aging stars will participate in the formation of new star systems.\nHowever, the atoms returned to the Galaxy by an aging star are not necessarily the same ones it received\ninitially. The star, after all, has fused hydrogen and helium to form new elements over the course of its life.\nAnd during the red-giant stage, material from the star\u2019s central regions is dredged up and mixed with its outer\nlayers, which can cause further nuclear reactions and the creation of still more new elements. As a result, the\nwinds that blow outward from such stars include atoms that were \u201cnewly minted\u201d inside the stars\u2019 cores. (As\nwe will see, this mechanism is even more effective for high-mass stars, but it does work for stars with masses\nlike that of the Sun.) In this way, the raw material of the Galaxy is not only resupplied but also receives\ninfusions of new elements. You might say this cosmic recycling plan allows the universe to get more\n\u201cinteresting\u201d all the time.\nMAKING CONNECTIONS\nThe Red Giant Sun and the Fate of Earth\nHow will the evolution of the Sun affect conditions on Earth in the future? Although the Sun has appeared\nreasonably steady in size and luminosity over recorded human history, that brief span means nothing\ncompared with the timescales we have been discussing. Let\u2019s examine the long-term prospects for our\nplanet.\nThe Sun took its place on the zero-age main sequence approximately 4.5 billion years ago. At that time, it\nemitted only about 70% of the energy that it radiates today. One might expect that Earth would have been\na lot colder than it is now, with the oceans frozen solid. But if this were the case, it would be hard to explain\nwhy simple life forms existed when Earth was less than a billion years old. Scientists now think that the\nexplanation may be that much more carbon dioxide was present in Earth\u2019s atmosphere when it was young,\nand that a much stronger greenhouse effect kept Earth warm. (In the greenhouse effect, gases like carbon\ndioxide or water vapor allow the Sun\u2019s light to come in but do not allow the infrared radiation from the\nground to escape back into space, so the temperature near Earth\u2019s surface increases.)\nCarbon dioxide in Earth\u2019s atmosphere has steadily declined as the Sun has increased in luminosity. As the\nbrighter Sun increases the temperature of Earth, rocks weather faster and react with carbon dioxide,\nremoving it from the atmosphere. The warmer Sun and the weaker greenhouse effect have kept Earth at a\nnearly constant temperature for most of its life. This remarkable coincidence, which has resulted in fairly\nstable climatic conditions, has been the key in the development of complex life-forms on our planet.\nAs a result of changes caused by the buildup of helium in its core, the Sun will continue to increase in\nluminosity as it grows older, and more and more radiation will reach Earth. For a while, the amount of\ncarbon dioxide will continue to decrease. (Note that this effect counteracts increases in carbon dioxide from\nhuman activities, but on a much-too-slow timescale to undo the changes in climate that are likely to occur\nin the next 100 years.)\nEventually, the heating of Earth will melt the polar caps and increase the evaporation of the oceans. Water\nvapor is also an efficient greenhouse gas and will more than compensate for the decrease in carbon\ndioxide. Sooner or later (atmospheric models are not yet good enough to say exactly when, but estimates\nrange from 500 million to 2 billion years), the increased water vapor will cause a runaway greenhouse\neffect.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 22.5 \u2022 The Evolution of More Massive Stars 743\nAbout 1 billion years from now, Earth will lose its water vapor. In the upper atmosphere, sunlight will break\ndown water vapor into hydrogen, and the fast-moving hydrogen atoms will escape into outer space. Like\nHumpty Dumpty, the water molecules cannot be put back together again. Earth will start to resemble the\nVenus of today, and temperatures will become much too high for life as we know it.\nAll of this will happen before the Sun even becomes a red giant. Then the bad news really starts. The Sun, as\nit expands, will swallow Mercury and Venus, and friction with our star\u2019s outer atmosphere will make these\nplanets spiral inward until they are completely vaporized. It is not completely clear whether Earth will\nescape a similar fate. As described in this chapter, the Sun will lose some of its mass as it becomes a red\ngiant. The gravitational pull of the Sun decreases when it loses mass. The result would be that the diameter\nof Earth\u2019s orbit would increase (remember Kepler\u2019s third law). However, recent calculations also show that\nforces due to the tides raised on the Sun by Earth will act in the opposite direction, causing Earth\u2019s orbit to\nshrink. Thus, many astrophysicists conclude that Earth will be vaporized along with Mercury and Venus.\nWhether or not this dire prediction is true, there is little doubt that all life on Earth will surely be incinerated.\nBut don\u2019t lose any sleep over this\u2014we are talking about events that will occur billions of years from now.\nWhat then are the prospects for preserving Earth life as we know it? The first strategy you might think of\nwould be to move humanity to a more distant and cooler planet. However, calculations indicate that there\nare long periods of time (several hundred million years) when no planet is habitable. For example, Earth\nbecomes far too warm for life long before Mars warms up enough.\nA better alternative may be to move the entire Earth progressively farther from the Sun. The idea is to use\ngravity in the same way NASA has used it to send spacecraft to distant planets. When a spacecraft flies near\na planet, the planet\u2019s motion can be used to speed up the spacecraft, slow it down, or redirect it.\nCalculations show that if we were to redirect an asteroid so that it follows just the right orbit between Earth\nand Jupiter, it could transfer orbital energy from Jupiter to Earth and move Earth slowly outward, pulling us\naway from the expanding Sun on each flyby. Since we have hundreds of millions of years to change Earth\u2019s\norbit, the effect of each flyby need not be large. (Of course, the people directing the asteroid had better get\nthe orbit exactly right and not cause the asteroid to hit Earth.)\nIt may seem crazy to think about projects to move an entire planet to a different orbit. But remember that\nwe are talking about the distant future. If, by some miracle, human beings are able to get along for all that\ntime and don\u2019t blow ourselves to bits, our technology is likely to be far more sophisticated than it is today.\nIt may also be that if humans survive for hundreds of millions of years, we may spread to planets or\nhabitats around other stars. Indeed, Earth, by then, might be a museum world to which youngsters from\nother planets return to learn about the origin of our species. It is also possible that evolution will by then\nhave changed us in ways that allow us to survive in very different environments. Wouldn\u2019t it be exciting to\nsee how the story of the human race turns out after all those billions of years?\n22.5 The Evolution of More Massive Stars\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain how and why massive stars evolve much more rapidly than lower-mass stars like our Sun\nDiscuss the origin of the elements heavier than carbon within stars\nIf what we have described so far were the whole story of the evolution of stars and elements, we would have a\nbig problem on our hands. We will see in later chapters that in our best models of the first few minutes of the\nuniverse, everything starts with the two simplest elements\u2014hydrogen and helium (plus a tiny bit of lithium).\nAll the predictions of the models imply that no heavier elements were produced at the beginning of the\nuniverse. Yet when we look around us on Earth, we see lots of other elements besides hydrogen and helium. 744 22 \u2022 Stars from Adolescence to Old Age\nThese elements must have been made (fused) somewhere in the universe,and the only place hot enough to\nmake them is inside stars. One of the fundamental discoveries of twentieth-century astronomy is that the stars\nare the source of most of the chemical richness that characterizes our world and our lives.\nWe have already seen that carbon, oxygen, and some other elements are made inside lower-mass stars during\nthe red-giant stage. But where do the heavier elements we know and love (such as the silicon and iron inside\nEarth, and the gold and silver in our jewelry) come from? The kinds of stars we have been discussing so far\nnever get hot enough at their centers to make these elements. It turns out that these heavier elements are\nformed later in the livesmore massivestars, as well as during explosions that can mark the end of the lives of\nsome stars.\nMaking New Elements in Massive Stars\nMassive stars evolve in much the same way that the Sun does (but always more quickly)\u2014up to the formation\nof a carbon-oxygen core. One difference is that for stars with more than about twice the mass of the Sun,\nhelium begins fusion more gradually, rather than with a sudden flash. Also, when more massive stars become\nred giants, they become so bright and large that we call themsupergiants. Such stars can expand until their\nouter regions become as large as the orbit of Jupiter, which is precisely what the Hubble Space Telescope has\nshown for the star Betelgeuse (seeFigure 22.4). They also lose mass very effectively, producing dramatic winds\nand outbursts as they age.Figure 22.20shows a wonderful image of the very massive starEta Carinae, with a\ngreat deal of ejected material clearly visible.\nFigure22.20Eta Carinae.With a mass at least 100 times that of the Sun, the hot supergiantEta Carinaeis one of the most massive\nstars known. This Hubble Space Telescope image records the two giant lobes and equatorial disk of material it has ejected in the\ncourse of its evolution. The pink outer region is material ejected in an outburst seen in 1843, the largest of such mass loss event that\nany star is known to have survived. Moving away from the star at a speed of about 1000 km/s, the material is rich in nitrogen and\nother elements formed in the interior of the star. The inner blue-white region is the material ejected at lower speeds and is thus still\ncloser to the star. It appears blue-white because it contains dust and reflects the light of Eta Carinae, whose luminosity is 4 million\ntimes that of our Sun. (credit: modification of work by Jon Morse (University of Colorado) & NASA)\nBut the crucial way that massive stars diverge from the story we have outlined is that they can start additional\nkinds of fusion in their centers and in the shells surrounding their central regions. The outer layers of a star\nwith a mass greater than about 8 solar masses have a weight that is enough to compress the carbon-oxygen\ncore until it becomes hot enough to ignite fusion of carbon nuclei. Carbon can fuse into still more oxygen, and\nat still higher temperatures, oxygen and then neon, magnesium, and finally silicon can build even heavier\nelements. Iron is, however, the endpoint of this process. The fusion of iron atoms produces products that are\nmoremassive than the nuclei that are being fused and therefore the processrequiresenergy, as opposed to\nreleasing energy, which all fusion reactions up to this point have done. This required energy comes at the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 22.5 \u2022 The Evolution of More Massive Stars 745\nexpense of the star itself, which is now on the brink of death (Figure 22.21). What happens next will be\ndescribed in the chapter onThe Death of Stars.\nFigure22.21Interior Structure of a Massive Star Just before It Exhausts Its Nuclear Fuel.High-mass stars can fuse elements\nheavier than carbon. As a massive star nears the end of its evolution, its interior resembles an onion. Hydrogen fusion is taking place\nin an outer shell, and progressively heavier elements are undergoing fusion in the higher-temperature layers closer to the center. All\nof these fusion reactions generate energy and enable the star to continue shining. Iron is different. The fusion of iron requires\nenergy, and when iron is finally created in the core, the star has only minutes to live.\nPhysicists have now found nuclear pathways whereby virtually all chemical elements of atomic weights up to\nthat of iron can be built up by thisnucleosynthesis(the making of new atomic nuclei) in the centers of the\nmore massive red giant stars. This still leaves the question of where elementsheavierthan iron come from.\nWe will see in the next chapter that when massive stars finally exhaust their nuclear fuel, they most often die\nin a spectacular explosion\u2014a supernova. Heavier elements can be synthesized in the stunning violence of such\nexplosions.\nNot only can we explain in this way where the elements that make up our world and others come from, but\nour theories of nucleosynthesis inside stars are even able to predict therelative abundanceswith which the\nelements occur in nature. The way stars build up elements during various nuclear reactions really can explain\nwhy some elements (oxygen, carbon, and iron) are common and others are quite rare (gold, silver, and\nuranium).\nElements in Globular Clusters and Open Clusters Are Not the Same\nThe fact that the elements are made in stars over time explains an important difference between globular and\nopen clusters. Hydrogen and helium, which are the most abundant elements in stars in the solar\nneighborhood, are also the most abundant constituents of stars in both kinds of clusters. However, the\nabundances of the elementsheavierthan helium are very different.\nIn the Sun and most of its neighboring stars, the combined abundance (by mass) of the elements heavier than\nhydrogen and helium is 1\u20134% of the star\u2019s mass. Spectra show that most open-cluster stars also have 1\u20134% of\ntheir matter in the form of heavy elements. Globular clusters, however, are a different story. The heavy-\nelement abundance of stars in typicalglobular clusters is found to be only 1/10 to 1/100 that of the Sun. A few\nvery old stars not in clusters have been discovered with even lower abundances of heavy elements.\nThe differences in chemical composition are a direct consequence of the formation of a cluster of stars. The\nvery first generation of stars initially contained only hydrogen and helium. We have seen that these stars, in\norder to generate energy, created heavier elements in their interiors. In the last stages of their lives, they\nejected matter, now enriched in heavy elements, into the reservoirs of raw material between the stars. Such\nmatter was then incorporated into a new generation of stars. 746 22 \u2022 Stars from Adolescence to Old Age\nThis means that the relative abundance of the heavy elements must be less and less as we look further into\nthe past. We saw that the globular clusters are much older than the open clusters. Since globular-cluster stars\nformed much earlier (that is, they are an earlier generation of stars) than those in open clusters, they have\nonly a relatively small abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium.\nAs time passes, the proportion of heavier elements in the \u201craw material\u201d that makes new stars and planets\nincreases. This means that the first generation of stars that formed in our Galaxy would not have been\naccompanied by a planet like Earth, full of silicon, iron, and many other heavy elements. Earth (and the\nastronomy students who live on it) was possible only after generations of stars had a chance to make and\nrecycle their heavier elements.\nNow the search is on for truefirst-generation stars, made only of hydrogen and helium. Theories predict that\nsuch stars should be very massive, live fast, and die quickly. They should have lived and died long ago. The\nplace to look for them is in very distant galaxies that formed when the universe was only a few hundred million\nyears old, but whose light is only arriving at Earth now.\nApproaching Death\nCompared with the main-sequence lifetimes of stars, the events that characterize the last stages ofstellar\nevolutionpass very quickly (especially for massive stars). As the star\u2019s luminosity increases, its rate of nuclear\nfuel consumption goes up rapidly\u2014just at that point in its life when its fuel supply is beginning to run down.\nAfter the prime fuel\u2014hydrogen\u2014is exhausted in a star\u2019s core, we saw that other sources of nuclear energy are\navailable to the star in the fusion of, first, helium, and then of other more complex elements. But the energy\nyield of these reactions is much less than that of the fusion of hydrogen to helium. And to trigger these\nreactions, the central temperature must be higher than that required for the fusion of hydrogen to helium,\nleading to even more rapid consumption of fuel. Clearly this is a losing game, and very quickly the star reaches\nits end. As it does so, however, some remarkable things can happen, as we will see inThe Death of Stars.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 22 \u2022 Key Terms 747\nKey Terms\nassociation a loose group of young stars whose spectral types, motions, and positions in the sky indicate a\ncommon origin\nglobular cluster one of about 150 large, spherical star clusters (each with hundreds of thousands of stars)\nthat form a spherical halo around the center of our Galaxy\nhelium flash a nearly explosive ignition of helium in the triple-alpha process in the dense core of a red giant\nstar\nmain-sequence turnoff location in the H\u2013R diagram where stars begin to leave the main sequence\nnucleosynthesis the building up of heavy elements from lighter ones by nuclear fusion\nopen cluster a comparatively loose cluster of stars, containing from a few dozen to a few thousand\nmembers, located in the spiral arms or disk of our Galaxy; sometimes referred to as a galactic cluster\nplanetary nebula a shell of gas ejected by and expanding away from an extremely hot low-mass star that is\nnearing the end of its life (the nebulae glow because of the ultra-violet energy of the central star)\ntriple-alpha process a nuclear reaction by which three helium nuclei are built up (fused) into one carbon\nnucleus\nzero-age main sequence a line denoting the main sequence on the H\u2013R diagram for a system of stars that\nhave completed their contraction from interstellar matter and are now deriving all their energy from\nnuclear reactions, but whose chemical composition has not yet been altered substantially by nuclear\nreactions\nSummary\n22.1Evolution from the Main Sequence to Red Giants\nWhen stars first begin to fuse hydrogen to helium, they lie on the zero-age main sequence. The amount of\ntime a star spends in the main-sequence stage depends on its mass. More massive stars complete each stage\nof evolution more quickly than lower-mass stars. The fusion of hydrogen to form helium changes the interior\ncomposition of a star, which in turn results in changes in its temperature, luminosity, and radius. Eventually, as\nstars age, they evolve away from the main sequence to become red giants or supergiants. The core of a red\ngiant is contracting, but the outer layers are expanding as a result of hydrogen fusion in a shell outside the\ncore. The star gets larger, redder, and more luminous as it expands and cools.\n22.2Star Clusters\nStar clusters provide one of the best tests of our calculations of what happens as stars age. The stars in a given\ncluster were formed at about the same time and have the same composition, so they differ mainly in mass,\nand thus, in their life stage. There are three types of star clusters: globular, open, and associations. Globular\nclusters have diameters of 50\u2013450 light-years, contain hundreds of thousands of stars, and are distributed in a\nhalo around the Galaxy. Open clusters typically contain hundreds of stars, are located in the plane of the\nGalaxy, and have diameters less than 30 light-years. Associations are found in regions of gas and dust and\ncontain extremely young stars.\n22.3Checking Out the Theory\nThe H\u2013R diagram of stars in a cluster changes systematically as the cluster grows older. The most massive\nstars evolve most rapidly. In the youngest clusters and associations, highly luminous blue stars are on the\nmain sequence; the stars with the lowest masses lie to the right of the main sequence and are still contracting\ntoward it. With passing time, stars of progressively lower masses evolve away from (or turn off) the main\nsequence. In globular clusters, which are all at least 11 billion years old, there are no luminous blue stars at all.\nAstronomers can use the turnoff point from the main sequence to determine the age of a cluster. 748 22 \u2022 For Further Exploration\n22.4Further Evolution of Stars\nAfter stars become red giants, their cores eventually become hot enough to produce energy by fusing helium\nto form carbon (and sometimes a bit of oxygen.) The fusion of three helium nuclei produces carbon through\nthe triple-alpha process. The rapid onset of helium fusion in the core of a low-mass star is called the helium\nflash. After this, the star becomes stable and reduces its luminosity and size briefly. In stars with masses about\ntwice the mass of the Sun or less, fusion stops after the helium in the core has been exhausted. Fusion of\nhydrogen and helium in shells around the contracting core makes the star a bright red giant again, but only\ntemporarily. When the star is a red giant, it can shed its outer layers and thereby expose hot inner layers.\nPlanetary nebulae (which have nothing to do with planets) are shells of gas ejected by such stars, set glowing\nby the ultraviolet radiation of the dying central star.\n22.5The Evolution of More Massive Stars\nIn stars with masses higher than about 8 solar masses, nuclear reactions involving carbon, oxygen, and still\nheavier elements can build up nuclei as heavy as iron. The creation of new chemical elements is called\nnucleosynthesis. The late stages of evolution occur very quickly. Ultimately, all stars must use up all of their\navailable energy supplies. In the process of dying, most stars eject some matter, enriched in heavy elements,\ninto interstellar space where it can be used to form new stars. Each succeeding generation of stars therefore\ncontains a larger proportion of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. This progressive enrichment\nexplains why the stars in open clusters (which formed more recently) contain more heavy elements than do\nthose in ancient globular clusters, and it tells us where most of the atoms on Earth and in our bodies come\nfrom.\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nBalick, B. & Frank, A. \u201cThe Extraordinary Deaths of Ordinary Stars.\u201dScientific American(July 2004): 50.

Have your group take a look at the list of the brightest stars in the sky inAppendix J. What fraction of them\nare past the main-sequence phase of evolution? The text says that stars spend 90% of their lifetimes in the\nmain-sequence phase of evolution. This suggests that if we have a fair (or representative) sample of stars,\n90% of them should be main-sequence stars. Your group should brainstorm why 90% of the brightest\nstars are not in the main-sequence phase of evolution.\nB. Reading an H\u2013R diagram can be tricky. Suppose your group is given the H\u2013R diagram of a star cluster.\nStars above and to the right of the main sequence could be either red giants that had evolved away from\nthe main sequence or very young stars that are still evolving toward the main sequence. Discuss how you\nwould decide which they are.\nC. In the chapter onLife in the Universe, we discuss some of the efforts now underway to search for radio\nsignals from possible intelligent civilizations around other stars. Our present resources for carrying out\nsuch searches are very limited and there are many stars in our Galaxy. Your group is a committee set up\nby the International Astronomical Union to come up with a list of the best possible stars with which such a 750 22 \u2022 Exercises\nsearch should begin. Make a list of criteria for choosing the stars on the list, and explain the reasons\nbehind each entry (keeping in mind some of the ideas about the life story of stars and timescales that we\ndiscuss in the present chapter.)\nD. Have your group make a list of the reasons why a star that formed at the very beginning of the universe\n(soon after the Big Bang) could not have a planet with astronomy students reading astronomy textbooks\n(even if the star has the same mass as that of our Sun).\nE. Since we are pretty sure that when the Sun becomes a giant star, all life on Earth will be wiped out, does\nyour group think that we should start making preparations of any kind? Let\u2019s suppose that a political\nleader who fell asleep during large parts of his astronomy class suddenly hears about this problem from a\nlarge donor and appoints your group as a task force to make suggestions on how to prepare for the end\nof Earth. Make a list of arguments for why such a task force is not really necessary.\nF. Use star charts to identify at least one open cluster visible at this time of the year. (Such charts can be\nfound inSky & TelescopeandAstronomymagazines each month and their websites; seeAppendix B.) The\nPleiades and Hyades are good autumn subjects, and Praesepe is good for springtime viewing. Go out and\nlook at these clusters with binoculars and describe what you see.\nG. Many astronomers think that planetary nebulae are among the most attractive and interesting objects we\ncan see in the Galaxy. In this chapter, we could only show you a few examples of the pictures of these\nobjects taken with the Hubble or large telescopes on the ground. Have members of your group search\nfurther for planetary nebula images online, and make a \u201ctop ten\u201d list of your favorite ones (do not include\nmore than three that were featured in this chapter.)

Suppose an astronomer known for joking around told you she had found a type-O main-sequence star in\nour Milky Way Galaxy that contained no elements heavier than helium. Would you believe her? Why?\n31. Stars that have masses approximately 0.8 times the mass of the Sun take about 18 billion years to turn\ninto red giants. How does this compare to the current age of the universe? Would you expect to find a\nglobular cluster with a main-sequence turnoff for stars of 0.8 solar mass or less? Why or why not?\n32. Automobiles are often used as an analogy to help people better understand how more massive stars have\nmuch shorter main-sequence lifetimes compared to less massive stars. Can you explain such an analogy\nusing automobiles?\nFiguring for Yourself\n33. The text says a star does not change its mass very much during the course of its main-sequence lifetime.\nWhile it is on the main sequence, a star converts about 10% of the hydrogen initially present into helium\n(remember it\u2019s only the core of the star that is hot enough for fusion). Look in earlier chapters to find out\nwhat percentage of the hydrogen mass involved in fusion is lost because it is converted to energy. By how\nmuch does the mass of the whole star change as a result of fusion? Were we correct to say that the mass\nof a star does not change significantly while it is on the main sequence?\n34. The text explains that massive stars have shorter lifetimes than low-mass stars. Even though massive stars\nhave more fuel to burn, they use it up faster than low-mass stars. You can check and see whether this\nstatement is true. The lifetime of a star is directly proportional to the amount of mass (fuel) it contains and\ninversely proportional to the rate at which it uses up that fuel (i.e., to its luminosity). Since the lifetime of\nthe Sun is about 1010y, we have the following relationship:\nwhereTis the lifetime of a main-sequence star,Mis its mass measured in terms of the mass of the Sun,\nandLis its luminosity measured in terms of the Sun\u2019s luminosity.\nA. Explain in words why this equation works.\nB. Use the data inTable 18.3to calculate the ages of the main-sequence stars listed.\nC. Do low-mass stars have longer main-sequence lifetimes?\nD. Do you get the same answers as those inTable 22.1?\n35. You can use the equation inExercise 22.34to estimate the approximate ages of the clusters inFigure\n22.10,Figure 22.12, andFigure 22.13. Use the information in the figures to determine the luminosity of the\nmost massive star still on the main sequence. Now use the data inTable 18.3to estimate the mass of this\nstar. Then calculate the age of the cluster. This method is similar to the procedure used by astronomers to\nobtain the ages of clusters, except that they use actual data and model calculations rather than simply\nmaking estimates from a drawing. How do your ages compare with the ages in the text?\n36. You can estimate the age of the planetary nebula in image (c) inFigure 22.18. The diameter of the nebula\nis 600 times the diameter of our own solar system, or about 0.8 light-year. The gas is expanding away from\nthe star at a rate of about 25 mi/s. Considering that distance = velocity time, calculate how long ago the\ngas left the star if its speed has been constant the whole time. Make sure you use consistent units for\ntime, speed, and distance.\n37. If star A has a core temperatureT, and star B has a core temperature 3T, how does the rate of fusion of\nstar A compare to the rate of fusion of star B?\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23 \u2022 Thinking Ahead 753\n23\nThe Death of Stars\nFigure23.1Stellar Life Cycle.This remarkable picture of NGC 3603, a nebula in the Milky Way Galaxy, was taken with the Hubble\nSpace Telescope. This image illustrates the life cycle of stars. In the bottom half of the image, we see clouds of dust and gas, where it\nis likely that star formation will take place in the near future. Near the center, there is a cluster of massive, hot young stars that are\nonly a few million years old. Above and to the right of the cluster, there is an isolated star surrounded by a ring of gas.

In the preceding two chapters, we followed the life story of stars, from\nthe process of birth to the brink of death. Now we are ready to explore the ways that stars end their lives.\nSooner or later, each star exhausts its store of nuclear energy. Without a source of internal pressure to\nbalance the weight of the overlying layers, every star eventually gives way to the inexorable pull of gravity and\ncollapses under its own weight.\nFollowing the rough distinction made in the last chapter, we will discuss the end-of-life evolution of stars of\nlower and higher mass separately. What determines the outcome\u2014bang or whimper\u2014is the mass of the star\nwhen it is ready to die, not the mass it was born with. As we noted in the last chapter, stars can lose a\nsignificant amount of mass in their middle and old age. 754 23 \u2022 The Death of Stars\n23.1 The Death of Low-Mass Stars\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the physical characteristics of degenerate matter and explain how the mass and radius of\ndegenerate stars are related\nPlot the future evolution of a white dwarf and show how its observable features will change over time\nDistinguish which stars will becomewhite dwarfs\nLet\u2019s begin with those stars whose final mass just before death is less than about 1.4 times the mass of the\nSun (M ). (We will explain why this mass is the crucial dividing line in a moment.) Note that most stars in the\nSun\nuniverse fall into this category. The number of stars decreases as mass increases; really massive stars are rare\n(seeThe Stars: A Celestial Census). This is similar to the music business where only a few musicians ever\nbecome superstars. Furthermore, many stars with an initial mass much greater than 1.4M will be reduced\nSun\nto that level by the time they die. For example, we now know that stars that start out with masses of at least\n8.0M (and possibly as much as 10M ) manage to lose enough mass during their lives to fit into this\nSun Sun\ncategory (an accomplishment anyone who has ever attempted to lose weight would surely envy).\nA Star in Crisis\nIn the last chapter, we left the life story of a star with a mass like the Sun\u2019s just after it had climbed up to the\nred-giant region of the H\u2013R diagram for a second time and had shed some of its outer layers to form a\nplanetary nebula. Recall that during this time, thecoreof the star was undergoing an \u201cenergy crisis.\u201d Earlier in\nits life, during a brief stable period, helium in the core had gotten hot enough to fuse into carbon (and\noxygen). But after this helium was exhausted, the star\u2019s core had once more found itself without a source of\npressure to balance gravity and so had begun to contract.\nThis collapse is the final event in the life of the core. Because the star\u2019s mass is relatively low, it cannot push its\ncore temperature high enough to begin another round of fusion (in the same way larger-mass stars can). The\ncore continues to shrink until it reaches a density equal to nearly a million times the density of water! That is\n200,000 times greater than the average density of Earth. At this extreme density, a new and different way for\nmatter to behave kicks in and helps the star achieve a final state of equilibrium. In the process, what remains\nof the star becomes one of the strangewhite dwarfsthat we met inThe Stars: A Celestial Census.\nDegenerate Stars\nBecause white dwarfs are far denser than any substance on Earth, the matter inside them behaves in a very\nunusual way\u2014unlike anything we know from everyday experience. At this high density, gravity is incredibly\nstrong and tries to shrink the star still further, but all theelectronsresist being pushed closer together and set\nup a powerful pressure inside the core. This pressure is the result of the fundamental rules that govern the\nbehavior of electrons (the quantum physics you were introduced to inThe Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse).\nAccording to these rules (known to physicists as thePauli exclusion principle), which have been verified in\nstudies of atoms in the laboratory, no two electrons can be in the same place at the same time doing the same\nthing. We specify theplaceof an electron by its position in space, and we specify what it is doing by its motion\nand the way it is spinning.\nThe temperature in the interior of a star is always so high that the atoms are stripped of virtually all their\nelectrons. For most of a star\u2019s life, the density of matter is also relatively low, and the electrons in the star are\nmoving rapidly. This means that no two of them will be in the same place moving in exactly the same way at\nthe same time. But this all changes when a star exhausts its store of nuclear energy and begins its final\ncollapse.\nAs the star\u2019s core contracts, electrons are squeezed closer and closer together. Eventually, a star like the Sun\nbecomes so dense that further contraction would in fact require two or more electrons to violate the rule\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23.1 \u2022 The Death of Low-Mass Stars 755\nagainst occupying the same place and moving in the same way. Such a dense gas is said to be degenerate (a\nterm coined by physicists and not related to the electron\u2019s moral character). The electrons in adegenerate\ngasresist further crowding with tremendous pressure. (It\u2019s as if the electrons said, \u201cYou can press inward all\nyou want, but there is simply no room for any other electrons to squeeze in here without violating the rules of\nour existence.\u201d)\nThe degenerate electrons do not require an input of heat to maintain the pressure they exert, and so a star\nwith this kind of structure, if nothing disturbs it, can last essentially forever. (Note that the repulsive force\nbetween degenerate electrons is different from, and much stronger than, the normal electrical repulsion\nbetween charges that have the same sign.)\nThe electrons in a degenerate gas do move about, as do particles in any gas, but not with a lot of freedom. A\nparticular electron cannot change position or momentum until another electron in an adjacent stage gets out\nof the way. The situation is much like that in the parking lot after a big football game. Vehicles are closely\npacked, and a given car cannot move until the one in front of it moves, leaving an empty space to be filled.\nOf course, the dying star also has atomic nuclei in it, not just electrons, but it turns out that the nuclei must be\nsqueezed to much higher densities before their quantum nature becomes apparent. As a result, in white\ndwarfs, the nuclei do not exhibit degeneracy pressure. Hence, in the white dwarf stage of stellar evolution, it is\nthe degeneracy pressure of the electrons, and not of the nuclei, that halts the collapse of the core.\nWhite Dwarfs\nWhite dwarfs, then, are stable, compact objects with electron-degenerate cores that cannot contract any\nfurther. Calculations showing thatwhite dwarfsare the likely end state of low-mass stars were first carried out\nby the Indian-American astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He was able to show how much a star\nwill shrink before the degenerate electrons halt its further contraction and hence what its final diameter will be\n(Figure 23.2).\nWhen Chandrasekhar made his calculation about white dwarfs, he found something very surprising: the radius\nof a white dwarf shrinks as the mass in the star increases (the larger the mass, the more tightly packed the\nelectrons can become, resulting in a smaller radius). According to the best theoretical models, a white dwarf\nwith a mass of about 1.4M or larger would have a radius of zero. What the calculations are telling us is that\nSun\neven the force of degenerate electrons cannot stop the collapse of a star with more mass than this. The\nmaximum mass that a star can end its life with and still become a white dwarf\u20141.4M \u2014is called the\nSun\nChandrasekhar limit. Stars with end-of-life masses that exceed this limit have a different kind of end in\nstore\u2014one that we will explore in the next section.\nFigure23.2Relating Masses and Radii of White Dwarfs.Models of white-dwarf structure predict that as the mass of the star 756 23 \u2022 The Death of Stars\nincreases (toward the right), its radius gets smaller and smaller.\nVOYAGERS IN ASTRONOMY\nSubrahmanyan Chandrasekhar\nBorn in 1910 in Lahore, India, SubrahmanyanChandrasekhar(known as Chandra to his friends and\ncolleagues) grew up in a home that encouraged scholarship and an interest in science (Figure 23.3). His\nuncle, C. V. Raman, was a physicist who won the 1930 Nobel Prize. A precocious student, Chandra tried to\nread as much as he could about the latest ideas in physics and astronomy, although obtaining technical\nbooks was not easy in India at the time. He finished college at age 19 and won a scholarship to study in\nEngland. It was during the long boat voyage to get to graduate school that he first began doing calculations\nabout the structure of white dwarf stars.\nChandra developed his ideas during and after his studies as a graduate student, showing\u2014as we have\ndiscussed\u2014that white dwarfs with masses greater than 1.4 times the mass of the Sun cannot exist and that\nthe theory predicts the existence of other kinds of stellar corpses. He wrote later that he felt very shy and\nlonely during this period, isolated from students, afraid to assert himself, and sometimes waiting for hours\nto speak with some of the famous professors he had read about in India. His calculations soon brought him\ninto conflict with certain distinguished astronomers, including Sir Arthur Eddington, who publicly ridiculed\nChandra\u2019s ideas. At a number of meetings of astronomers, such leaders in the field as Henry NorrisRussell\nrefused to give Chandra the opportunity to defend his ideas, while allowing his more senior critics lots of\ntime to criticize them.\nYet Chandra persevered, writing books and articles elucidating his theories, which turned out not only to be\ncorrect, but to lay the foundation for much of our modern understanding of the death of stars. In 1983, he\nreceived the Nobel Prize in physics for this early work.\nIn 1937, Chandra came to the United States and joined the faculty at the University of Chicago, where he\nremained for the rest of his life. There he devoted himself to research and teaching, making major\ncontributions to many fields of astronomy, from our understanding of the motions of stars through the\nGalaxy to the behavior of the bizarre objects called black holes (seeBlack Holes and Curved Spacetime). In\n1999, NASA named its sophisticated orbiting X-ray telescope (designed in part to explore such stellar\ncorpses) the Chandra X-ray Observatory.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23.1 \u2022 The Death of Low-Mass Stars 757\nFigure23.3S. Chandrasekhar (1910\u20131995).Chandra\u2019s research provided the basis for much of what we now know about stellar\ncorpses. (credit: modification of work by American Institute of Physics)\nChandra spent a great deal of time with his graduate students, supervising the research of more than 50\nPhDs during his life. He took his teaching responsibilities very seriously: during the 1940s, while based at\nthe Yerkes Observatory, he willingly drove the more than 100-mile trip to the university each week to teach\na class of only a few students.\nChandra also had a deep devotion to music, art, and philosophy, writing articles and books about the\nrelationship between the humanities and science. He once wrote that \u201cone can learn science the way one\nenjoys music or art. . . . Heisenberg had a marvelous phrase \u2018shuddering before the beautiful\u2019. . . that is the\nkind of feeling I have.\u201d\nLINK TO LEARNING\nUsing the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers were able to detectimages(https://openstax.org/l/\n30hubimgwhidwa)of faint white dwarf stars and other \u201cstellar corpses\u201d in the M4 star cluster, located\nabout 7200 light-years away.\nThe Ultimate Fate of White Dwarfs\nIf the birth of a main-sequence star is defined by the onset of fusion reactions, then we must consider the end\nof all fusion reactions to be the time of a star\u2019s death. As the core is stabilized by degeneracy pressure, a last\nshudder of fusion passes through the outside of the star, consuming the little hydrogen still remaining. Now\nthe star is a true white dwarf: nuclear fusion in its interior has ceased.Figure 23.4shows the path of a star like\nthe Sun on theH\u2013R diagramduring its final stages. 758 23 \u2022 The Death of Stars\nFigure23.4Evolutionary Track for a Star Like the Sun.This diagram shows the changes in luminosity and surface temperature for\na star with a mass like the Sun\u2019s as it nears the end of its life. After the star becomes a giant again (point A on the diagram), it will\nlose more and more mass as its core begins to collapse. The mass loss will expose the hot inner core, which will appear at the center\nof a planetary nebula. In this stage, the star moves across the diagram to the left as it becomes hotter and hotter during its collapse\n(point B). At first, the luminosity remains nearly constant, but as the star begins to cool off, it becomes less and less bright (point C).\nIt is now a white dwarf and will continue to cool slowly for billions of years until all of its remaining store of energy is radiated away.\n(This assumes the Sun will lose between 46\u201350% of its mass during the giant stages, based upon various theoretical models).\nSince a stable white dwarf can no longer contract or produce energy through fusion, its only energy source is\nthe heat represented by the motions of the atomic nuclei in its interior. The light it emits comes from this\ninternal stored heat, which is substantial. Gradually, however, the white dwarf radiates away all its heat into\nspace. After many billions of years, the nuclei will be moving much more slowly, and the white dwarf will no\nlonger shine (Figure 23.5). It will then be ablack dwarf\u2014a cold stellar corpse with the mass of a star and the\nsize of a planet. It will be composed mostly of carbon, oxygen, and neon, the products of the most advanced\nfusion reactions of which the star was capable.\nFigure23.5Visible Light and X-Ray Images of the Sirius Star System.(a) This image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope shows\nSiriusA (the large bright star), and its companion star, the white dwarf known as Sirius B (the tiny, faint star at the lower left). Sirius A\nand B are 8.6 light-years from Earth and are our fifth-closest star system. Note that the image has intentionally been overexposed to\nallow us to see Sirius B. (b) The same system is shown in X-ray taken with the Chandra Space Telescope. Note that Sirius A is fainter\nin X-rays than the hot white dwarf that is Sirius B.

Barstow(University of\nLeicester); credit b: modification of work by NASA/SAO/CXC)\nWe have one final surprise as we leave our low-mass star in the stellar graveyard. Calculations show that as a\ndegenerate star cools, the atoms inside it in essence \u201csolidify\u201d into a giant, highly compact lattice (organized\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23.2 \u2022 Evolution of Massive Stars: An Explosive Finish 759\nrows of atoms, just like in a crystal). When carbon is compressed and crystallized in this way, it becomes a\ngiantdiamond-likestar. A white dwarf star might make the most impressive engagement present you could\never see, although any attempt to mine the diamond-like material inside would crush an ardent lover\ninstantly!\nLINK TO LEARNING\nLearn about a recent \u201cdiamond star\u201d find, acold, white dwarf star(https://openstax.org/l/30diamondstar)\ndetected in 2014, which is considered the coldest and dimmest found to date, at the website of the National\nRadio Astronomy Observatory.\nEvidence That Stars Can Shed a Lot of Mass as They Evolve\nWhether or not a star will become a white dwarf depends on how much mass is lost in the red-giant and\nearlier phases of evolution. All stars that have masses below the Chandrasekhar limit when they run out of fuel\nwill become white dwarfs, no matter what mass they were born with. But which stars shed enough mass to\nreach this limit?\nOne strategy for answering this question is to look in young,open clusters (which were discussed inStar\nClusters). The basic idea is to search for young clusters that contain one or more white dwarf stars. Remember\nthat more massive stars go through all stages of their evolution more rapidly than less massive ones. Suppose\nwe find a cluster that has a white dwarf member and also contains stars on the main sequence that have 6\ntimes the mass of the Sun. This means that only those stars with masses greater than 6M have had time to\nSun\nexhaust their supply of nuclear energy and complete their evolution to the white dwarf stage. The star that\nturned into the white dwarf must therefore have had a main-sequence mass of more than 6M , since stars\nSun\nwith lower masses have not yet had time to use up their stores of nuclear energy. The star that became the\nwhite dwarf must, therefore, have gotten rid of at least 4.6M so that its mass at the time nuclear energy\nSun\ngeneration ceased could be less than 1.4M .\nSun\nAstronomers continue to search for suitable clusters to make this test, and the evidence so far suggests that\nstars with masses up to about 8M can shed enough mass to end their lives as white dwarfs. Stars like the\nSun\nSun will probably lose about 45% of their initial mass and become white dwarfs with masses less than 1.4M .\nSun\n23.2 Evolution of Massive Stars: An Explosive Finish\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the interior of a massive star before a supernova\nExplain the steps of a core collapse and explosion\nList the hazards associated with nearby supernovae\nThanks to mass loss, then, stars with starting masses of at least 8M (and perhaps even more) probably end\nSun\ntheir lives as white dwarfs. But we know stars can have masses as large as 150 (or more)M . They have a\nSun\ndifferent kind of death in store for them. As we will see, these stars die with a bang.\nNuclear Fusion of Heavy Elements\nAfter the helium in its core is exhausted (seeThe Evolution of More Massive Stars), the evolution of a massive\nstar takes a significantly different course from that of lower-mass stars. In a massive star, the weight of the\nouter layers is sufficient to force the carbon core to contract until it becomes hot enough to fuse carbon into\noxygen, neon, and magnesium. This cycle of contraction, heating, and the ignition of another nuclear fuel 760 23 \u2022 The Death of Stars\nrepeats several more times. After each of the possible nuclear fuels is exhausted, the core contracts again until\nit reaches a new temperature high enough to fuse still-heavier nuclei. The products of carbon fusion can be\nfurther converted into silicon, sulfur, calcium, and argon. And these elements, when heated to a still-higher\ntemperature, can combine to produce iron. Massive stars go through these stages very, very quickly. In really\nmassive stars, somefusionstages toward the very end can take only months or even days! This is a far cry\nfrom the millions of years they spend in the main-sequence stage.\nAt this stage of its evolution, a massive star resembles an onion with an iron core. As we get farther from the\ncenter, we find shells of decreasing temperature in which nuclear reactions involve nuclei of progressively\nlower mass\u2014silicon and sulfur, oxygen, neon, carbon, helium, and finally, hydrogen (Figure 23.6).\nFigure23.6Structure of an Old Massive Star.Just before its final gravitational collapse, the core of a massive star resembles an\nonion. The iron core is surrounded by layers of silicon and sulfur, oxygen, neon, carbon mixed with some oxygen, helium, and finally\nhydrogen. Outside the core, the composition is mainly hydrogen and helium. (Note that this diagram is not precisely to scale but is\njust meant to convey the general idea of what such a star would be like.) (credit: modification of work by ESO, Digitized Sky Survey)\nBut there is a limit to how long this process of building up elements by fusion can go on. The fusion of silicon\ninto iron turns out to be the last step in the sequence of nonexplosive element production. Up to this point,\neach fusion reaction hasproducedenergy because the nucleus of each fusion product has been a bit more\nstable than the nuclei that formed it. As discussed inThe Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse, light nuclei give up some\nof their binding energy in the process of fusing into more tightly bound, heavier nuclei. It is this released\nenergy that maintains the outward pressure in the core so that the star does not collapse. But of all the nuclei\nknown, iron is the most tightly bound and thus the most stable.\nYou might think of the situation like this: all smaller nuclei want to \u201cgrow up\u201d to be like iron, and they are\nwilling to pay (produceenergy) to move toward that goal. But iron is a mature nucleus with good self-esteem,\nperfectly content being iron; it requires payment (mustabsorbenergy) to change its stable nuclear structure.\nThis is the exact opposite of what has happened in each nuclear reaction so far: instead ofprovidingenergy to\nbalance the inward pull of gravity, any nuclear reactions involving iron wouldremovesome energy from the\ncore of the star.\nUnable to generate energy, the star now faces catastrophe.\nCollapse into a Ball of Neutrons\nWhen nuclear reactions stop, the core of a massive star is supported by degenerate electrons, just as a white\ndwarf is. For stars that begin their evolution with masses of at least 10M , this core is likely made mainly of\nSun\niron. (For stars with initial masses in the range 8 to 10M , the core is likely made of oxygen, neon, and\nSun\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23.2 \u2022 Evolution of Massive Stars: An Explosive Finish 761\nmagnesium, because the star never gets hot enough to form elements as heavy as iron. The exact\ncomposition of the cores of stars in this mass range is very difficult to determine because of the complex\nphysical characteristics in the cores, particularly at the very high densities and temperatures involved.) We will\nfocus on the more massive iron cores in our discussion.\nWhile no energy is being generated within the white dwarf core of the star, fusion still occurs in the shells that\nsurround the core. As the shells finish their fusion reactions and stop producing energy, the ashes of the last\nreaction fall onto the white dwarf core, increasing its mass. AsFigure 23.2shows, a higher mass means a\nsmaller core. The core can contract because even a degenerate gas is still mostly empty space. Electrons and\natomic nuclei are, after all, extremely small. The electrons and nuclei in a stellar core may be crowded\ncompared to the air in your room, but there is still lots of space between them.\nThe electrons at first resist being crowded closer together, and so the core shrinks only a small amount.\nUltimately, however, the iron core reaches a mass so large that even degenerate electrons can no longer\nsupport it. When the density reaches 4 \u00d7 1011g/cm3(400 billion times the density of water), some electrons are\nactually squeezed into the atomic nuclei, where they combine with protons to form neutrons and neutrinos.\nThis transformation is not something that is familiar from everyday life, but becomes very important as such a\nmassive star core collapses.\nSome of the electrons are now gone, so the core can no longer resist the crushing mass of the star\u2019s overlying\nlayers. The core begins to shrink rapidly. More and more electrons are now pushed into the atomic nuclei,\nwhich ultimately become so saturated with neutrons that they cannot hold onto them.\nAt this point, the neutrons are squeezed out of the nuclei and can exert a new force. As is true for electrons, it\nturns out that the neutrons strongly resist being in the same place and moving in the same way. The force that\ncan be exerted by suchdegenerate neutronsis much greater than that produced by degenerate electrons, so\nunless the core is too massive, they can ultimately stop the collapse.\nThis means the collapsing core can reach a stable state as a crushed ball made mainly of neutrons, which\nastronomers call aneutron star. We don\u2019t have an exact number (a \u201cChandrasekhar limit\u201d) for the maximum\nmass of a neutron star, but calculations tell us that the upper mass limit of a body made of neutrons might\nonly be about 3M . So if the mass of the core were greater than this, then even neutron degeneracy would\nSun\nnot be able to stop the core from collapsing further. The dying star must end up as something even more\nextremely compressed, which until recently was believed to be only one possible type of object\u2014the state of\nultimate compaction known as ablack hole(which is the subject of our next chapter). This is because no force\nwas believed to exist that could stop a collapse beyond the neutron star stage.\nCollapse and Explosion\nWhen the collapse of a high-mass star\u2019s core is stopped by degenerate neutrons, the core is saved from\nfurther destruction, but it turns out that the rest of the star is literally blown apart. Here\u2019s how it happens.\nThe collapse that takes place when electrons are absorbed into the nuclei is very rapid. In less than a second, a\ncore with a mass of about 1M , which originally was approximately the size of Earth, collapses to a diameter\nSun\nof less than 20 kilometers. The speed with which material falls inward reaches one-fourth the speed of light.\nThe collapse halts only when the density of the core exceeds the density of an atomic nucleus (which is the\ndensest form of matter we know). A typical neutron star is so compressed that to duplicate its density, we\nwould have to squeeze all the people in the world into a single sugar cube! This would give us one sugar\ncube\u2019s worth (one cubic centimeter\u2019s worth) of a neutron star.\nThe neutron degenerate core strongly resists further compression, abruptly halting the collapse. The shock of\nthe sudden jolt initiates a shock wave that starts to propagate outward. However, this shock alone is not\nenough to create a star explosion. The energy produced by the outflowing matter is quickly absorbed by\natomic nuclei in the dense, overlying layers of gas, where it breaks up the nuclei into individual neutrons and 762 23 \u2022 The Death of Stars\nprotons.\nOur understanding of nuclear processes indicates (as we mentioned above) that each time an electron and a\nproton in the star\u2019s core merge to make a neutron, the merger releases aneutrino. These ghostly subatomic\nparticles, introduced inThe Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse, carry away some of the nuclear energy. It is their\npresence that launches the final disastrous explosion of the star. The total energy contained in theneutrinos is\nhuge. In the initial second of the star\u2019s explosion, the power carried by the neutrinos (1046watts) is greater\nthan the power put out by all the stars in over a billion galaxies.\nWhile neutrinos ordinarily do not interact very much with ordinary matter (we earlier accused them of being\ndownright antisocial), matter near the center of a collapsing star is so dense that the neutrinos do interact\nwith it to some degree. They deposit some of this energy in the layers of the star just outside the core. This\nhuge, sudden input of energy reverses the infall of these layers and drives them explosively outward. Most of\nthe mass of the star (apart from that which went into the neutron star in the core) is then ejected outward into\nspace. As we saw earlier, such an explosion requires a star of at least 8M , and the neutron star can have a\nSun\nmass of at most 3M Consequently, at least five times the mass of our Sun is ejected into space in each such\nSun.\nexplosive event!\nThe resulting explosion is called asupernova(Figure 23.7). When these explosions happen close by, they can\nbe among the most spectacular celestial events, as we will discuss in the next section. (Actually, there are at\nleast two different types of supernova explosions: the kind we have been describing, which is the collapse of a\nmassive star, is called, for historical reasons, atype II supernova. We will describe how the types differ later in\nthis chapter).\nFigure23.7Five Supernova Explosions in Other Galaxies.The arrows in the top row of images point to the supernovae. The\nbottom row shows the host galaxies before or after the stars exploded. Each of thesesupernovae exploded between 3.5 and 10\nbillion years ago. Note that the supernovae when they first explode can be as bright as an entire galaxy. (credit: modification of work\nby NASA, ESA, and A. Riess (STScI))\nTable 23.1summarizes the discussion so far about what happens to stars and substellar objects of different\ninitial masses at the ends of their lives. Like so much of our scientific understanding, this list represents a\nprogress report: it is the best we can do with our present models and observations. The mass limits\ncorresponding to various outcomes may change somewhat as models are improved. There is much we do not\nyet understand about the details of what happens when stars die.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23.2 \u2022 Evolution of Massive Stars: An Explosive Finish 763\nThe Ultimate Fate of Stars and Substellar Objects with Different Masses\n1\nInitial Mass (Mass of Sun = 1) Final State at the End of Its Life\n< 0.01 Planet\n0.01 to 0.08 Brown dwarf\n0.08 to 0.25 White dwarf made mostly of helium\n0.25 to 8 White dwarf made mostly of carbon and oxygen\n8 to 10 White dwarf made of oxygen, neon, and magnesium\n10 to 40 Supernova explosion that leaves a neutron star\n> 40 Supernova explosion that leaves a black hole\nTable23.1\nThe Supernova Giveth and the Supernova Taketh Away\nAfter the supernova explosion, the life of a massive star comes to an end. But the death of each massive star is\nan important event in the history of its galaxy. The elements built up by fusion during the star\u2019s life are now\n\u201crecycled\u201d into space by the explosion, making them available to enrich the gas and dust that form new stars\nand planets. Because these heavy elements ejected by supernovae are critical for the formation of planets and\nthe origin of life, it\u2019s fair to say that without mass loss from supernovae and planetary nebulae, neither the\n2\nauthors nor the readers of this book would exist.\nBut the supernova explosion has one more creative contribution to make, one we alluded to inStars from\nAdolescence to Old Agewhen we asked where the atoms in your jewelry came from. The supernova explosion\nproduces a flood of energetic neutrons that barrel through the expanding material. These neutrons can be\nabsorbed by iron and other nuclei where they can turn into protons. Thus, they can build up elements that are\nmore massive than iron, possibly including such terrestrial favorites as gold, silver and uranium. Supernovae\n(and, as we will shortly see, the explosive mergers of neutron stars) are the only candidates we have for places\nwhere such heavier atoms can be made. Next time you wear some gold jewelry (or give some to your\nsweetheart), bear in mind that those gold atoms were forged long ago in these kinds of celestial explosions!\nWhen supernovae explode, these elements (as well as the ones the star made during more stable times) are\nejected into the existing gas between the stars and mixed with it. Thus, supernovae play a crucial role in\nenriching their galaxy with heavier elements, allowing, among other things, the chemical elements that make\nup earthlike planets and the building blocks of life to become more common as time goes on (Figure 23.8).\n1 Stars in the mass ranges 0.25\u20138 and 8\u201310 may later produce a type of supernova different from the one we have discussed so far.\nThese are discussed inThe Evolution of Binary Star Systems.\n2 To tell the full story, there is another way to make and recycle these heavier elements which we will discuss inThe Milky Way\nGalaxy. That is the merger of two neutron stars, which also causes a huge explosion. 764 23 \u2022 The Death of Stars\nFigure23.8Kepler Supernova Remant.This image shows the expanding remains of a supernova explosion, which was first seen\nabout 400 years ago by sky watchers, including the famous astronomer Johannes Kepler. The bubble-shaped shroud of gas and dust\nis now 14 light-years wide and is expanding at 2,000 kilometers per second (4 million miles per hour). The remnant emits energy at\nwavelengths from X-rays (shown in blue and green) to visible light (yellow) and into the infrared (red). The expanding shell is rich in\niron, which was produced in the star that exploded. The main image combines the individual single-color images seen at the bottom\ninto one multi-wavelength picture. (credit: modification of work by NASA, ESA, R. Sankrit and W. Blair (Johns Hopkins University))\nSupernovae are also thought to be the source of many of the high-energycosmic rayparticles discussed in\nCosmic Rays. Trapped by the magnetic field of the Galaxy, the particles from exploded stars continue to\ncirculate around the vast spiral of the Milky Way. Scientists speculate that high-speedcosmic rayshitting the\ngenetic material of Earth organisms over billions of years may have contributed to the steady\nmutations\u2014subtle changes in the genetic code\u2014that drive the evolution of life on our planet. In all the ways\nwe have mentioned, supernovae have played a part in the development of new generations of stars, planets,\nand life.\nBut supernovae also have a dark side. Suppose a life form has the misfortune to develop around a star that\nhappens to lie near a massive star destined to become a supernova. Such life forms may find themselves\nsnuffed out when the harsh radiation and high-energy particles from the neighboring star\u2019s explosion reach\ntheir world. If, as some astronomers speculate, life can develop on many planets around long-lived (lower-\nmass) stars, then the suitability of that life\u2019sown starand planet may not be all that matters for its long-term\nevolution and survival. Life may well have formed around a number of pleasantly stable stars only to be wiped\nout because a massive nearby star suddenly went supernova. Just as children born in a war zone may find\nthemselves the unjust victims of their violent neighborhood, life too close to a star that goes supernova may\nfall prey to having been born in the wrong place at the wrong time.\nWhat is a safe distance to be from a supernova explosion? A lot depends on the violence of the particular\nexplosion, what type of supernova it is (seeThe Evolution of Binary Star Systems), and what level of\ndestruction we are willing to accept. Calculations suggest that a supernova less than 50 light-years away from\nus would certainly end all life on Earth, and that even one 100 light-years away would have drastic\nconsequences for the radiation levels here. One minor extinction of sea creatures about 2 million years ago on\nEarth may actually have been caused by a supernova at a distance of about 120 light-years.\nThe good news is that there are at present no massive stars that promise to become supernovae within 50\nlight-years of the Sun. (This is in part because the kinds of massive stars that become supernovae are overall\nquite rare.) The massive star closest to us, Spica (in the constellation of Virgo), is about 260 light-years away,\nprobably a safe distance, even if it were to explode as a supernova in the near future.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23.2 \u2022 Evolution of Massive Stars: An Explosive Finish 765\nEXAMPLE 23.1\nExtreme Gravity\nIn this section, you were introduced to some very dense objects.

The wordnovameans \u201cnew\u201d in Latin; before\ntelescopes, when a star too dim to be seen with the unaided eye suddenly flared up in a brilliant explosion,\nobservers concluded it must be a brand-new star. Twentieth-century astronomers reclassified the explosions\nwith the greatest luminosity assupernovae.\nFrom historical records of such explosions, from studies of the remnants of supernovae in our Galaxy, and\nfrom analyses of supernovae in other galaxies, we estimate that, on average, one supernova explosion occurs\nsomewhere in the Milky Way Galaxy every 25 to 100 years. Unfortunately, however, nosupernovaexplosion\nhas been observable in our Galaxy since the invention of the telescope. Either we have been exceptionally\nunlucky or, more likely, recent explosions have taken place in parts of the Galaxy where interstellar dust blocks\nlight from reaching us.\nMAKING CONNECTIONS\nSupernovae in History\nAlthough many supernova explosions in our own Galaxy have gone unnoticed, a few were so spectacular\nthat they were clearly seen and recorded by sky watchers and historians at the time. We can use these\nrecords, going back two millennia, to help us pinpoint where the exploding stars were and thus where to\nlook for their remnants today.\nThe most dramatic supernova was observed in the year 1006. It appeared in May as a brilliant point of light\nvisible during the daytime, perhaps 100 times brighter than the planet Venus. It was bright enough to cast\nshadows on the ground during the night and was recorded with awe and fear by observers all over Europe\nand Asia. No one had seen anything like it before; Chinese astronomers, noting that it was a temporary\nspectacle, called it a \u201cguest star.\u201d\nAstronomers David Clark and Richard Stephenson have scoured records from around the world to find\nmore than 20 reports of the 1006 supernova (SN 1006) (Figure 23.9). This has allowed them to determine\nwith some accuracy where in the sky the explosion occurred. They place it in the modern constellation of\nLupus; at roughly the position they have determined, we find a supernova remnant, now quite faint. From\nthe way its filaments are expanding, it indeed appears to be about 1000 years old.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23.3 \u2022 Supernova Observations 767\nFigure23.9Supernova 1006 Remnant.This composite view of SN 1006 from the Chandra X-Ray Observatory shows the X-rays\ncoming from the remnant in blue, visible light in white-yellow, and radio emission in red. (credit: modification of work by NASA,\nESA, Zolt Levay(STScI))\nAnother guest star, now known asSN 1054, was clearly recorded in Chinese records in July 1054. The\nremnant of that star is one of the most famous and best-studied objects in the sky, called theCrab Nebula\n(Figure 23.14). It is a marvelously complex object, which has been key to understanding the death of\nmassive stars. When its explosion was first seen, we estimate that it was about as bright as the planet\nJupiter: nowhere near as dazzling as the 1006 event but still quite dramatic to anyone who kept track of\nobjects in the sky. Another fainter supernova was seen in 1181.\nThe next supernova became visible in November 1572 and, being brighter than the planet Venus, was\nquickly spotted by a number of observers, including the young TychoBrahe(seeOrbits and Gravity). His\ncareful measurements of the star over a year and a half showed that it was not a comet or something in\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere since it did not move relative to the stars. He correctly deduced that it must be a\nphenomenon belonging to the realm of the stars, not of the solar system. The remnant ofTycho\u2019s\nSupernova(as it is now called) can still be detected in many different bands of the electromagnetic\nspectrum.\nNot to be outdone, JohannesKepler, Tycho Brahe\u2019s scientific heir, found his own supernova in 1604, now\nknown asKepler\u2019s Supernova(Figure 23.8). Fainter than Tycho\u2019s, it nevertheless remained visible for about\na year. Kepler wrote a book about his observations that was read by many with an interest in the heavens,\nincluding Galileo.\nNo supernova has been spotted in our Galaxy for the past 300 years. Since the explosion of a visible\nsupernova is a chance event, there is no way to say when the next one might occur. Around the world,\ndozens of professional and amateur astronomers keep a sharp lookout for \u201cnew\u201d stars that appear\novernight, hoping to be the first to spot the next guest star in our sky and make a little history themselves.\nAt their maximum brightness, the most luminous supernovae have about 10 billion times the luminosity of the\nSun. For a brief time, a supernova may outshine the entire galaxy in which it appears. After maximum\nbrightness, the star\u2019s light fades and disappears from telescopic visibility within a few months or years. At the\ntime of their outbursts, supernovae eject material at typical velocities of 10,000 kilometers per second (and\nspeeds twice that have been observed). A speed of 20,000 kilometers per second corresponds to about 45\nmillion miles per hour, truly an indication of great cosmic violence.\nSupernovae are classified according to the appearance of their spectra, but in this chapter, we will focus on the\ntwo main causes of supernovae. Type Ia supernovae are ignited when a lot of material is dumped on\ndegenerate white dwarfs (Figure 23.10); these supernovae will be discussed later in this chapter. For now, we 768 23 \u2022 The Death of Stars\nwill continue our story about the death of massive stars and focus on type II supernovae, which are produced\nwhen the core of a massive star collapses.\nFigure23.10Supernova 2014J.This image of supernova 2014J, located in Messier 82 (M82), which is also known as the Cigar galaxy,\nwas taken by the Hubble Space Telescope and is superposed on a mosaic image of the galaxy also taken with Hubble. The supernova\nevent is indicated by the box and the inset. This explosion was produced by a type Ia supernova, which is theorized to be triggered in\nbinary systems consisting of a white dwarf and another star\u2014and could be a second white dwarf, a star like our Sun, or a giant star.\nThis type of supernova will be discussed later in this chapter. At a distance of approximately 11.5 million light-years from Earth, this is\nthe closest supernova of type Ia discovered in the past few decades. In the image, you can see reddish plumes of hydrogen coming\nfrom the central region of the galaxy, where a considerable number of young stars are being born.

Goobar (Stockholm University), and the Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA))\nSupernova 1987A\nOur most detailed information about what happens when a type II supernova occurs comes from an event\nthat was observed in 1987. Before dawn on February 24, Ian Shelton, a Canadian astronomer working at an\nobservatory in Chile, pulled a photographic plate from the developer. Two nights earlier, he had begun a\nsurvey of theLarge Magellanic Cloud, a small galaxy that is one of the Milky Way\u2019s nearest neighbors in space.\nWhere he expected to see only faint stars, he saw a large bright spot. Concerned that his photograph was\nflawed, Shelton went outside to look at the Large Magellanic Cloud . . . and saw that a new object had indeed\nappeared in the sky (seeFigure 23.11). He soon realized that he had discovered a supernova, one that could be\nseen with the unaided eye even though it was about 160,000 light-years away.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23.3 \u2022 Supernova Observations 769\nFigure23.11Hubble Space Telescope Image of SN 1987A.The supernova remnant with its inner and outer red rings of material is\nlocated in the Large Magellanic Cloud. This image is a composite of several images taken in 1994, 1996, and 1997\u2014about a decade\naftersupernova 1987Awas first observed. (credit: modification of work by the Hubble Heritage Team (AURA/STScI/NASA/ESA))\nNow known as SN 1987A, since it was the first supernova discovered in 1987, this brilliant newcomer to the\nsouthern sky gave astronomers their first opportunity to study the death of a relatively nearby star with\nmodern instruments. It was also the first time astronomers had observed a starbeforeit became a supernova.\nThe star that blew up had been included in earlier surveys of the Large Magellanic Cloud, and as a result, we\nknow the star was a blue supergiant just before the explosion.\nBy combining theory and observations at many different wavelengths, astronomers have reconstructed the\nlife story of the star that became SN 1987A. Formed about 10 million years ago, it originally had a mass of\nabout 20M . For 90% of its life, it lived quietly on the main sequence, converting hydrogen into helium. At\nSun\nthis time, its luminosity was about 60,000 times that of the Sun (L ), and its spectral type was O. When the\nSun\nhydrogen in the center of the star was exhausted, the core contracted and ultimately became hot enough to\nfuse helium. By this time, the star was a red supergiant, emitting about 100,000 times more energy than the\nSun. While in this stage, the star lost some of its mass.\nThis lost material has actually been detected by observations with the Hubble Space Telescope (Figure 23.12).\nThe gas driven out into space by the subsequent supernova explosion is currently colliding with the material\nthe star left behind when it was a red giant. As the two collide, we see a glowing ring.\nFigure23.12Ring around Supernova 1987A.These two images show a ring of gas expelled by a red giant star about 30,000 years\nbefore the star exploded and was observed as Supernova 1987A. The supernova, which has been artificially dimmed, is located at the 770 23 \u2022 The Death of Stars\ncenter of the ring. The left-hand image was taken in 1997 and the right-hand image in 2003. Note that the number of bright spots\nhas increased from 1 to more than 15 over this time interval. These spots occur where high-speed gas ejected by the supernova and\nmoving at millions of miles per hour has reached the ring and blasted into it. The collision has heated the gas in the ring and caused\nit to glow more brightly. The fact that we see individual spots suggests that material ejected by the supernova is first hitting narrow,\ninward-projecting columns of gas in the clumpy ring. The hot spots are the first signs of a dramatic and violent collision between the\nnew and old material that will continue over the next few years. By studying these bright spots, astronomers can determine the\ncomposition of the ring and hence learn about the nuclear processes that build heavy elements inside massive stars. (credit:\nmodification of work by NASA, P. Challis, R. Kirshner (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics) and B. Sugerman (STScI))\nHelium fusion lasted only about 1 million years. When the helium was exhausted at the center of the star, the\ncore contracted again, the radius of the surface also decreased, and the star became a blue supergiant with a\nluminosity still about equal to 100,000L . This is what it still looked like on the outside when, after brief\nSun\nperiods of further fusion, it reached the iron crisis we discussed earlier and exploded.\nSome key stages of evolution of the star that became SN 1987A, including the ones following helium\nexhaustion, are listed inTable 23.2. While we don\u2019t expect you to remember these numbers, note the patterns\nin the table: each stage of evolution happens more quickly than the preceding one, the temperature and\npressure in the core increase, and progressively heavier elements are the source of fusion energy. Once iron\nwas created, the collapse began. It was a catastrophic collapse, lasting only a few tenths of a second; the\nspeed of infall in the outer portion of the iron core reached 70,000 kilometers per second, about one-fourth\nthe speed of light.\nEvolution of the Star That Exploded as SN 1987A\nPhase Central Temperature (K) Central Density (g/cm3) Time Spent in This Phase\nHydrogen fusion 40 \u00d7 106 5 8 \u00d7 106years\nHelium fusion 190 \u00d7 106 970 106years\nCarbon fusion 870 \u00d7 106 170,000 2000 years\nNeon fusion 1.6 \u00d7 109 3.0 \u00d7 106 6 months\nOxygen fusion 2.0 \u00d7 109 5.6 \u00d7 106 1 year\nSilicon fusion 3.3 \u00d7 109 4.3 \u00d7 107 Days\nCore collapse 200 \u00d7 109 2 \u00d7 1014 Tenths of a second\nTable23.2\nIn the meantime, as the core was experiencing its last catastrophe, the outer shells of neon, oxygen, carbon,\nhelium, and hydrogen in the star did not yet know about the collapse. Information about the physical\nmovement of different layers travels through a star at the speed of sound and cannot reach the surface in the\nfew tenths of a second required for the core collapse to occur. Thus, the surface layers of our star hung briefly\nsuspended, much like a cartoon character who dashes off the edge of a cliff and hangs momentarily in space\nbefore realizing that he is no longer held up by anything.\nThe collapse of the core continued until the densities rose to several times that of an atomic nucleus. The\nresistance to further collapse then became so great that the core rebounded. Infalling material ran into the\n\u201cbrick wall\u201d of the rebounding core and was thrown outward with a great shock wave. Neutrinos poured out of\nthe core, helping the shock wave blow the star apart. The shock reached the surface of the star a few hours\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23.3 \u2022 Supernova Observations 771\nlater, and the star began to brighten into the supernova Ian Shelton observed in 1987.\nThe Synthesis of Heavy Elements\nThe variations in the brightness of SN 1987A in the days and months after its discovery, which are shown in\nFigure 23.13, helped confirm our ideas about heavy element production. In a single day, the star soared in\nbrightness by a factor of about 1000 and became just visible without a telescope. The star then continued to\nincrease slowly in brightness until it was about the same apparent brightness as the stars in the Little Dipper.\nUp until about day 40 after the outburst, the energy being radiated away was produced by the explosion itself.\nBut then SN 1987A did not continue to fade away, as we might have expected the light from the explosion to\ndo. Instead, SN 1987A remained bright as energy from newly created radioactive elements came into play.\nFigure23.13Change in the Brightness of SN 1987A over Time.Note how the rate of decline of the supernova\u2019s light slowed\nbetween days 40 and 500. During this time, the brightness was mainly due to the energy emitted by newly formed (and quickly\ndecaying) radioactive elements. Remember that magnitudes are a backward measure of brightness: the larger the magnitude, the\ndimmer the object looks.\nOne of the elements formed in a supernova explosion is radioactive nickel, with an atomic mass of 56 (that is,\nthe total number of protons plus neutrons in its nucleus is 56). Nickel-56 is unstable and changes\nspontaneously (with a half-life of about 6 days) to cobalt-56. (Recall that a half-life is the time it takes for half\nthe nuclei in a sample to undergoradioactive decay.) Cobalt-56 in turn decays with a half-life of about 77 days\nto iron-56, which is stable. Energetic gamma rays are emitted when these radioactive nuclei decay. Those\ngamma rays then serve as a new source of energy for the expanding layers of the supernova. The gamma rays\nare absorbed in the overlying gas and re-emitted at visible wavelengths, keeping the remains of the star\nbright.\nAs you can see inFigure 23.13, astronomers did observe brightening due to radioactive nuclei in the first few\nmonths following the supernova\u2019s outburst and then saw the extra light die away as more and more of the\nradioactive nuclei decayed to stable iron. The gamma-ray heating was responsible for virtually all of the\nradiation detected from SN 1987A after day 40. Some gamma rays also escaped directly without being\nabsorbed. These were detected by Earth-orbiting telescopes at the wavelengths expected for the decay of\nradioactive nickel and cobalt, clearly confirming our understanding that new elements were indeed formed in\nthe crucible of the supernova.\nNeutrinos from SN 1987A\nIf there had been any human observers in theLarge Magellanic Cloudabout 160,000 years ago, the explosion\nwe call SN 1987A would have been a brilliant spectacle in their skies. Yet we know that less than 1/10 of 1% of 772 23 \u2022 The Death of Stars\nthe energy of the explosion appeared as visible light. About 1% of the energy was required to destroy the star,\nand the rest was carried away byneutrinos. The overall energy in these neutrinos was truly astounding. In the\ninitial second of the event, as we noted earlier in our general discussion of supernovae, their total luminosity\nexceeded the luminosity of all the stars in over a billion galaxies. And the supernova generated this energy in a\nvolume less than 50 kilometers in diameter! Supernovae are one of the most violent events in the universe,\nand theirlightturns out to be only the tip of the iceberg in revealing how much energy they produce.\nIn 1987, the neutrinos from SN 1987A were detected by two instruments\u2014which might be called \u201cneutrino\ntelescopes\u201d\u2014almost a full day before Shelton\u2019s observations. (This is because the neutrinos get out of the\nexploding star more easily than light does, and also because you don\u2019t need to wait until nightfall to catch a\n\u201cglimpse\u201d of them.) Both neutrino telescopes, one in a deep mine in Japan and the other under Lake Erie,\nconsist of several thousand tons of purified water surrounded by several hundred light-sensitive detectors.\nIncoming neutrinos interact with the water to produce positrons and electrons, which move rapidly through\nthe water and emit deep blue light.\nAltogether, 19 neutrinos were detected. Since the neutrino telescopes were in the Northern Hemisphere and\nthe supernova occurred in the Southern Hemisphere, the detected neutrinos had already passed through\nEarth and were on their way back out into space when they were captured.\nOnly a few neutrinos were detected because the probability that they will interact with ordinary matter is very,\nvery low. It is estimated that the supernova actually released 1058neutrinos. A tiny fraction of these, about 30\nbillion, eventually passed through each square centimeter of Earth\u2019s surface. About a million people actually\nexperienced a neutrino interaction within their bodies as a result of the supernova. This interaction happened\nto only a single nucleus in each person and thus had absolutely no biological effect; it went completely\nunnoticed by everyone concerned.\nSince the neutrinos come directly from the heart of the supernova, their energies provided a measure of the\ntemperature of the core as the star was exploding. The central temperature was about 200 billion K, a stunning\nfigure to which no earthly analog can bring much meaning. With neutrino telescopes, we are peering into the\nfinal moment in the life stories of massive stars and observing conditions beyond all human experience. Yet\nwe are also seeing the unmistakable hints of our own origins.\n23.4 Pulsars and the Discovery of Neutron Stars\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain the research method that led to the discovery of neutron stars, located hundreds or thousands of\nlight-years away\nDescribe the features of a neutron star that allow it to be detected as a pulsar\nList the observational evidence that links pulsars and neutron stars to supernovae\nAfter a type II supernova explosion fades away, all that is left behind is either aneutron staror something\neven more strange, ablack hole. We will describe the properties of black holes inBlack Holes and Curved\nSpacetime, but for now, we want to examine how the neutron stars we discussed earlier might become\nobservable.\nNeutron stars are the densest objects in the universe; the force of gravity at their surface is 1011times greater\nthan what we experience at Earth\u2019s surface. The interior of a neutron star is composed of about 95% neutrons,\nwith a small number of protons and electrons mixed in. In effect, a neutron star is a giant atomic nucleus, with\na mass about 1057times the mass of a proton. Its diameter is more like the size of a small town or an asteroid\nthan a star. (Table 23.3compares the properties of neutron stars andwhite dwarfs.) Because it is so small, a\nneutron star probably strikes you as the object least likely to be observed from thousands of light-years away.\nYet neutron stars do manage to signal their presence across vast gulfs of space.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23.4 \u2022 Pulsars and the Discovery of Neutron Stars 773\nProperties of a Typical White Dwarf and a Neutron Star\nProperty White Dwarf Neutron Star\nMass (Sun = 1) 0.6 (always <1.4) Always >1.4 and <3\nRadius 7000 km 10 km\nDensity 8 \u00d7 105g/cm3 1014g/cm3\nTable23.3\nThe Discovery of Neutron Stars\nIn 1967, JocelynBell, a research student at Cambridge University, was studying distant radio sources with a\nspecial detector that had been designed and built by her advisor AntonyHewishto find rapid variations in\nradio signals. The project computers spewed out reams of paper showing where the telescope had surveyed\nthe sky, and it was the job of Hewish\u2019s graduate students to go through it all, searching for interesting\nphenomena. In September 1967, Bell discovered what she called \u201ca bit of scruff\u201d\u2014a strange radio signal unlike\nanything seen before.\nWhat Bell had found, in the constellation of Vulpecula, was a source of rapid, sharp, intense, and extremely\nregular pulses of radio radiation. Like the regular ticking of a clock, the pulses arrived precisely every 1.33728\nseconds. Such exactness first led the scientists to speculate that perhaps they had found signals from an\nintelligent civilization. Radio astronomers even half-jokingly dubbed the source \u201cLGM\u201d for \u201clittle green men.\u201d\nSoon, however, three similar sources were discovered in widely separated directions in the sky.\nWhen it became apparent that this type of radio source was fairly common, astronomers concluded that they\nwere highly unlikely to be signals from other civilizations. By today, nearly 3000 such sources have been\ndiscovered; they are now calledpulsars, short for \u201cpulsating radio sources.\u201d\nThe pulse periods of different pulsars range from a little longer than 1/1000 of a second to nearly 10 seconds.\nAt first, the pulsars seemed particularly mysterious because nothing could be seen at their location on visible-\nlight photographs. But then a pulsar was discovered right in the center of theCrab Nebula, a cloud of gas\nproduced bySN 1054, a supernova that was recorded by the Chinese in 1054 (Figure 23.14). The energy from\nthe Crab Nebula pulsar arrives in sharp bursts that occur 30 times each second\u2014with a regularity that would\nbe the envy of a Swiss watchmaker. In addition to pulses of radio energy, we can observe pulses of visible light\nand X-rays from the Crab Nebula. The fact that the pulsar was just in the region of the supernova remnant\nwhere we expect the leftover neutron star to be immediately alerted astronomers that pulsars might be\nconnected with these elusive \u201ccorpses\u201d of massive stars. 774 23 \u2022 The Death of Stars\nFigure23.14Crab Nebula.This image shows X-ray emissions from theCrab Nebula, which is about 6500 light-years away. The\npulsar is the bright spot at the center of the concentric rings. Data taken over about a year show that particles stream away from the\ninner ring at about half the speed of light. The jet that is perpendicular to this ring is a stream of matter and antimatter electrons\nalso moving at half the speed of light. (credit: modification of work by NASA/CXC/SAO)\nThe Crab Nebula is a fascinating object. The whole nebula glows with radiation at many wavelengths, and its\noverall energy output is more than 100,000 times that of the Sun\u2014not a bad trick for the remnant of a\nsupernova that exploded almost a thousand years ago. Astronomers soon began to look for a connection\nbetween the pulsar and the large energy output of the surrounding nebula.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nRead thetranscript of an interesting interview(https://openstax.org/l/30jocbellint)with Jocelyn Bell\n(Burnell) to learn about her life and work (this is part of a project at the American Institute of Physics to\nrecord interviews with pathbreaking scientists while they are still alive).\nA Spinning Lighthouse Model\nBy applying a combination of theory and observation, astronomers eventually concluded that pulsars must be\nspinning neutron stars. According to this model, aneutron staris something like a lighthouse on a rocky coast\n(Figure 23.15). To warn ships in all directions and yet not cost too much to operate, the light in a modern\nlighthouse turns, sweeping its beam across the dark sea. From the vantage point of a ship, you see a pulse of\nlight each time the beam points in your direction. In the same way, radiation from a small region on a neutron\nstar sweeps across the oceans of space, giving us a pulse of radiation each time the beam points toward Earth.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23.4 \u2022 Pulsars and the Discovery of Neutron Stars 775\nFigure23.15Lighthouse.A lighthouse in California warns ships on the ocean not to approach too close to the dangerous shoreline.\nThe lighted section at the top rotates so that its beam can cover all directions. (credit: Anita Ritenour)\nNeutron stars are ideal candidates for such a job because the collapse has made them so small that they can\nturn very rapidly. Recall the principle of theconservation of angular momentumfromNewton\u2019s Great\nSynthesis: if an object gets smaller, it can spin more rapidly. Even if the parent star was rotating very slowly\nwhen it was on the main sequence, its rotation had to speed up as it collapsed to form a neutron star. With a\ndiameter of only 10 to 20 kilometers, a neutron star can complete one full spin in only a fraction of a second.\nThis is just the sort of time period we observe between pulsar pulses.\nAny magnetic field that existed in the original star will be highly compressed when the core collapses to a\nneutron star. At the surface of the neutron star, in the outer layer consisting of ordinary matter (and not just\npure neutrons), protons and electrons are caught up in this spinning field and accelerated nearly to the speed\nof light. In only two places\u2014the north and south magnetic poles\u2014can the trapped particles escape the strong\nhold of the magnetic field (Figure 23.16). The same effect can be seen (in reverse) on Earth, where charged\nparticles from space arekept outby our planet\u2019s magnetic field everywhere except near the poles. As a result,\nEarth\u2019s auroras (caused when charged particles hit the atmosphere at high speed) are seen mainly near the\npoles. 776 23 \u2022 The Death of Stars\nFigure23.16Model of a Pulsar.A diagram showing how beams of radiation at the magnetic poles of a neutron star can give rise to\npulses of emission as the star rotates. As each beam sweeps over Earth, like a lighthouse beam sweeping over a distant ship, we see\na short pulse of radiation. This model requires that the magnetic poles be located in different places from the rotation poles. (credit\n\u201cstars\u201d: modification of work by Tony Hisgett)\nNote that in a neutron star, the magnetic north and south poles do not have to be anywhere close to the north\nand south poles defined by the star\u2019s rotation. In the same way, we discussed in the chapter onThe Giant\nPlanetsthat the magnetic poles on the planets Uranus and Neptune are not lined up with the poles of the\nplanet\u2019s spin.Figure 23.16shows the poles of the magnetic field perpendicular to the poles of rotation, but the\ntwo kinds of poles could make any angle.\nIn fact, the misalignment of the rotational axis with the magnetic axis plays a crucial role in the generation of\nthe observed pulses in this model. At the two magnetic poles, the particles from the neutron star are focused\ninto a narrow beam and come streaming out of the whirling magnetic region at enormous speeds. They emit\nenergy over a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum. The radiation itself is also confined to a narrow\nbeam, which explains why the pulsar acts like a lighthouse. As the rotation carries first one and then the other\nmagnetic pole of the star into our view, we see a pulse of radiation each time.\nTests of the Model\nThis explanation of pulsars in terms of beams of radiation from highly magnetic and rapidly spinning neutron\nstars is a very clever idea. But what evidence do we have that it is the correct model? First, we can measure the\nmasses of some pulsars, and they do turn out be in the range of 1.4 to 1.8 times that of the Sun\u2014just what\ntheorists predict for neutron stars. The masses are found using Kepler\u2019s law for those few pulsars that are\nmembers of binary star systems.\nBut there is an even-better confirming argument, which brings us back to theCrab Nebulaand its vast energy\noutput. When the high-energy charged particles from the neutron star pulsar hit the slower-moving material\nfrom the supernova, they energize this material and cause it to \u201cglow\u201d at many different wavelengths\u2014just\nwhat we observe from the Crab Nebula. The pulsar beams are a power source that \u201clight up\u201d the nebula long\nafter the initial explosion of the star that made it.\nWho \u201cpays the bills\u201d for all the energy we see coming out of a remnant like the Crab Nebula? After all, when\nenergy emerges from one place, it must be depleted in another. The ultimate energy source in our model is\nthe rotation of the neutron star, which propels charged particles outward and spins its magnetic field at\nenormous speeds. As its rotational energy is used to excite the Crab Nebula year after year, the pulsar inside\nthe nebula slows down. As it slows, the pulses come a little less often; more time elapses before the slower\nneutron star brings its beam back around.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23.4 \u2022 Pulsars and the Discovery of Neutron Stars 777\nSeveral decades of careful observations have now shown that the Crab Nebula pulsar is not a perfectly regular\nclock as we originally thought: instead, it is gradually slowing down. Having measured how much the pulsar is\nslowing down, we can calculate how much rotation energy the neutron star is losing. Remember that it is very\ndensely packed and spins amazingly quickly. Even a tiny slowing down can mean an immense loss of energy.\nTo the satisfaction of astronomers, the rotational energy lost by the pulsar turns out to be the same as the\namount of energy emerging from the nebula surrounding it. In other words, the slowing down of a rotating\nneutron star can explain precisely why the Crab Nebula is glowing with the amount of energy we observe.\nThe Evolution of Pulsars\nFrom observations of thepulsars discovered so far, astronomers have concluded that one new pulsar is born\nsomewhere in the Galaxy every 25 to 100 years, the same rate at which supernovae are estimated to occur.\nCalculations suggest that the typical lifetime of a pulsar is about 10 million years; after that, the neutron star\nno longer rotates fast enough to produce significant beams of particles and energy, and is no longer\nobservable. We estimate that there are about 100 million neutron stars in our Galaxy, most of them rotating\ntoo slowly to come to our notice.\nThe Crab pulsar is rather young (only about 960 years old) and has a short period, whereas other, older\npulsars have already slowed to longer periods. Pulsars thousands of years old have lost too much energy to\nemit appreciably in the visible and X-ray wavelengths, and they are observed only as radio pulsars; their\nperiods are a second or longer.\nThere is one other reason we can see only a fraction of the pulsars in the Galaxy. Consider our lighthouse\nmodel again. On Earth, all ships approach on the same plane\u2014the surface of the ocean\u2014so the lighthouse can\nbe built to sweep its beam over that surface. But in space, objects can be anywhere in three dimensions. As a\ngiven pulsar\u2019s beam sweeps over a circle in space, there is absolutely no guarantee that this circle will include\nthe direction of Earth. In fact, if you think about it, many more circles in space willnotinclude Earth than will\ninclude it. Thus, we estimate that we are unable to observe a large number of neutron stars because their\npulsar beams miss us entirely.\nAt the same time, it turns out that only a few of the pulsars discovered so far are embedded in the visible\nclouds of gas that mark the remnant of a supernova. This might at first seem mysterious, since we know that\nsupernovae give rise to neutron stars and we should expect each pulsar to have begun its life in a supernova\nexplosion. But the lifetime of a pulsar turns out to be about 100 times longer than the length of time required\nfor the expanding gas of a supernova remnant to disperse into interstellar space. Thus, most pulsars are\nfound with no other trace left of the explosion that produced them.\nIn addition, some pulsars are ejected by a supernova explosion that is not the same in all directions. If the\nsupernova explosion is stronger on one side, it can kick the pulsar entirely out of the supernova remnant\n(some astronomers call this \u201cgetting a birth kick\u201d). We know such kicks happen because we see a number of\nyoung supernova remnants in nearby galaxies where the pulsar is to one side of the remnant and racing away\nat several hundred miles per second (Figure 23.17). 778 23 \u2022 The Death of Stars\nFigure23.17Speeding Pulsar.This intriguing image (which combines X-ray, visible, and radio observations) shows the jet trailing\nbehind a pulsar (at bottom right, lined up between the two bright stars). With a length of 37 light-years, the jet trail (seen in purple)\nis the longest ever observed from an object in the Milky Way. (There is also a mysterious shorter, comet-like tail that is almost\nperpendicular to the purple jet.) Moving at a speed between 2.5 and 5 million miles per hour, the pulsar is traveling away from the\ncore of the supernova remnant where it originated.

What made this event so remarkable was that, despite the distance of the\nsource, its tidal wave of radiation had measurable effects on Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The apparent brightness\nof this gamma-ray flare was greater than any historical star explosion.\nThe primary effect of the radiation was on a layer high in Earth\u2019s atmosphere called theionosphere. At\nnight, the ionosphere is normally at a height of about 85 kilometers, but during the day, energy from the\nSun ionizes more molecules and lowers the boundary of the ionosphere to a height of about 60 kilometers.\nThe pulse of X-ray and gamma-ray radiation produced about the same level of ionization as the daytime\nSun. It also caused some sensitive satellites above the atmosphere to shut down their electronics.\nMeasurements by telescopes in space indicate that SGR 1806-20 was a special type of fast-spinning neutron\nstar called amagnetar. Astronomers Robert Duncan and Christopher Thomson gave them this name\nbecause their magnetic fields are stronger than that of any other type of astronomical source\u2014in this case,\nabout 800 trillion times stronger than the magnetic field of Earth.\nA magnetar is thought to consist of a superdense core of neutrons surrounded by a rigid crust of atoms\nabout a mile deep with a surface made of iron. The magnetar\u2019s field is so strong that it creates huge\nstresses inside that can sometimes crack open the hard crust, causing a starquarke. The vibrating crust\nproduces an enormous blast of radiation. An astronaut 0.1 light-year from this particular magnetar would\nhave received a fatal does from the blast in less than a second.\nFortunately, we were far enough away from magnetar SGR 1806-20 to be safe. Could a magnetar ever\npresent a real danger to Earth? To produce enough energy to disrupt the ozone layer, a magnetar would\nhave to be located within the cloud of comets that surround the solar system, and we know no magnetars\nare that close. Nevertheless, it is a fascinating discovery that events on distant star corpses can have\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23.5 \u2022 The Evolution of Binary Star Systems 779\nmeasurable effects on Earth.\n23.5 The Evolution of Binary Star Systems\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the kind ofbinary star systemthat leads to a nova event\nDescribe the type of binary star system that leads to a type Ia supernovae event\nIndicate how type Ia supernovae differ from type II supernovae\nThe discussion of the life stories of stars presented so far has suffered from a bias\u2014what we might call\n\u201csingle-star chauvinism.\u201d Because the human race developed around a star that goes through life alone, we\ntend to think of most stars in isolation. But as we saw inThe Stars: A Celestial Census, it now appears that as\nmany as half of all stars may develop inbinarysystems\u2014those in which two stars are born in each other\u2019s\ngravitational embrace and go through life orbiting a common center of mass.\nFor these stars, the presence of a close-by companion can have a profound influence on their evolution. Under\nthe right circumstances, stars can exchange material, especially during the stages when one of them swells up\ninto a giant or supergiant, or has a strong wind. When this happens and the companion stars are sufficiently\nclose, material can flow from one star to another, decreasing the mass of the donor and increasing the mass\nof the recipient. Suchmass transfercan be especially dramatic when the recipient is a stellar remnant such as\na white dwarf or a neutron star. While the detailed story of how such binary stars evolve is beyond the scope\nof our book, we do want to mention a few examples of how the stages of evolution described in this chapter\nmay change when there are two stars in a system.\nWhite Dwarf Explosions: The Mild Kind\nLet\u2019s consider the following system of two stars: one has become awhite dwarfand the other is gradually\ntransferring material onto it. As fresh hydrogen from the outer layers of its companion accumulates on the\nsurface of the hot white dwarf, it begins to build up a layer of hydrogen. As more and more hydrogen\naccumulates and heats up on the surface of the degenerate star, the new layer eventually reaches a\ntemperature that causes fusion to begin in a sudden, explosive way, blasting much of the new material away.\nIn this way, the white dwarf quickly (but only briefly) becomes quite bright, hundreds or thousands of times its\nprevious luminosity. To observers before the invention of the telescope, it seemed that a new star suddenly\n3\nappeared, and they called it anova. Novae fade away in a few months to a few years.\nHundreds of novae have been observed, each occurring in a binary star system and each later showing a shell\nof expelled material. A number of stars have more than one nova episode, as more material from its\nneighboring star accumulates on the white dwarf and the whole process repeats. As long as the episodes do\nnot increase the mass of the white dwarf beyond the Chandrasekhar limit (by transferring too much mass too\nquickly), the dense white dwarf itself remains pretty much unaffected by the explosions on its surface.\nWhite Dwarf Explosions: The Violent Kind\nIf a white dwarf accumulates matter from a companion star at a much faster rate, it can be pushed over the\nChandrasekhar limit. The evolution of such a binary system is shown inFigure 23.18. When its mass\napproaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit (exceeds 1.4M ), such an object can no longer support itself as a\nSun\nwhite dwarf, and it begins to contract. As it does so, it heats up, and new nuclear reactions can begin in the\n3 We now know that this historical terminology is quite misleading since novae do not originate from new stars. In fact, quite to the\ncontrary, novae originate from white dwarfs, which are actually the endpoint of stellar evolution for low-mass stars. But since the\nsystem of two stars was too faint to be visible to the naked eye, it did seem to people, before telescopes were invented, that a star\nhad appeared where nothing had been visible. 780 23 \u2022 The Death of Stars\ndegenerate core. The star \u201csimmers\u201d for the next century or so, building up internal temperature. This\nsimmering phase ends in less than a second, when an enormous amount of fusion (especially of carbon) takes\nplace all at once, resulting in an explosion. The fusion energy produced during the final explosion is so great\nthat it completely destroys the white dwarf. Gases are blown out into space at velocities of about 10,000\nkilometers per second, and afterward, no trace of the white dwarf remains.\nFigure23.18Evolution of a Binary System.The more massive star evolves first to become a red giant and then a white dwarf. The\nwhite dwarf then begins to attract material from its companion, which in turn evolves to become a red giant. Eventually, the white\ndwarf acquires so much mass that it is pushed over the Chandrasekhar limit and becomes a type Ia supernova.\nSuch an explosion is also called a supernova, since, like the destruction of a high-mass star, it produces a huge\namount of energy in a very short time. However, unlike the explosion of a high-mass star, which can leave\nbehind a neutron star or black hole remnant, the white dwarf is completely destroyed in the process, leaving\nbehind no remnant. We call these white dwarf explosions type Ia supernovae.\nWe distinguish type I supernovae from those of supernovae of type II originating from the death of massive\nstars discussed earlier by the absence of hydrogen in their observed spectra. Hydrogen is the most common\nelement in the universe and is a major component of massive, evolved stars. However, as we learned earlier,\nhydrogen is absent from the white dwarf remnant, which is primarily composed of carbon and oxygen for\nmasses comparable to the Chandrasekhar mass limit.\nThe \u201ca\u201d subdesignation oftype Ia supernovaefurther refers to the presence of strong silicon absorption lines,\nwhich are absent from supernovae originating from the collapse of massive stars. Silicon is one of the\nproducts that results from the fusion of carbon and oxygen, which bears out the scenario we described\nabove\u2014that there is a sudden onset of the fusion of the carbon (and oxygen) of which the white dwarf was\nmade.\nObservational evidence now strongly indicates thatSN 1006,Tycho\u2019s Supernova, andKepler\u2019s Supernova(see\nSupernovae in History) were all type Ia supernovae. For instance, in contrast to the case ofSN 1054, which\nyielded the spinning pulsar in the Crab Nebula, none of these historical supernovae shows any evidence of\nstellar remnants that have survived their explosions. Perhaps even more puzzling is that, so far, astronomers\nhave not been able to identify the companion star feeding the white dwarf in any of these historical\nsupernovae.\nConsequently, in order to address the mystery of the absent companion stars and other outstanding puzzles,\nastronomers have recently begun to investigate alternative mechanisms of generating type Ia supernovae. All\nproposed mechanisms rely upon white dwarfs composed of carbon and oxygen, which are needed to meet the\nobserved absence of hydrogen in the type Ia spectrum. And because any isolated white dwarf below the\nChandrasekhar mass is stable, all proposed mechanisms invoke a binary companion to explode the white\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23.5 \u2022 The Evolution of Binary Star Systems 781\ndwarf. The leading alternative mechanism scientists believe creates a type Ia supernova is the merger of two\nwhite dwarf stars in a binary system. The two white dwarfs may have unstable orbits, such that over time, they\nwould slowly move closer together until they merge. If their combined mass is greater than the\nChandrasekhar limit, the result could also be a type Ia supernova explosion.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nYou can watch ashort video(https://openstax.org/l/30supernovavid)about Supernova SN 2014J, a type Ia\nsupernova discovered in the Messier 82 (M82) galaxy on January 21, 2014, as well as see brief animations of\nthe two mechanisms by which such a supernova could form.\nType Ia supernovae are of great interest to astronomers in other areas of research. This type of supernova is\nbrighter than supernovae produced by the collapse of a massive star. Thus,type Ia supernovae can be seen at\nvery large distances, and they are found in all types of galaxies. The energy output from most type Ia\nsupernovae is consistent, with little variation in their maximum luminosities, or in how their light output\ninitially increases and then slowly decreases over time. These properties make type Ia supernovae extremely\nvaluable \u201cstandard bulbs\u201d for astronomers looking out at great distances\u2014well beyond the limits of our own\nGalaxy. You\u2019ll learn more about their use in measuring distances to other galaxies inThe Big Bang.\nIn contrast, type II supernovae are about 5 times less luminous than type Ia supernovae and are only seen in\ngalaxies that have recent, massive star formation. Type II supernovae are also less consistent in their energy\noutput during the explosion and can have a range a peak luminosity values.\nNeutron Stars with Companions\nNow let\u2019s look at an even-more mismatched pair of stars in action. It is possible that, under the right\ncircumstances, a binary system can even survive the explosion of one of its members as atype II supernova. In\nthat case, an ordinary star can eventually share a system with aneutron star. If material is then transferred\nfrom the \u201cliving\u201d star to its \u201cdead\u201d (and highly compressed) companion, this material will be pulled in by the\nstrong gravity of the neutron star. Such infalling gas will be compressed and heated to incredible\ntemperatures. It will quickly become so hot that it will experience an explosive burst of fusion. The energies\ninvolved are so great that we would expect much of the radiation from the burst to emerge as X-rays. And\nindeed, high-energy observatories above Earth\u2019s atmosphere (seeAstronomical Instruments) have recorded\nmany objects that undergo just these types of X-raybursts.\nIf the neutron star and its companion are positioned the right way, a significant amount of material can be\ntransferred to the neutron star and can set it spinning faster (as spin energy is also transferred). The radius of\nthe neutron star would also decrease as more mass was added. Astronomers have found pulsars in binary\nsystems that are spinning at a rate of more than 500 times per second! (These are sometimes called\nmillisecond pulsarssince the pulses are separated by a few thousandths of a second.)\nSuch a rapid spin could not have come from the birth of the neutron star; it must have been externally caused.\n(Recall that the Crab Nebula pulsar, one of the youngest pulsars known, was spinning \u201conly\u201d 30 times per\nsecond.) Indeed, some of the fast pulsars are observed to be part of binary systems, while others may be\nalone only because they have \u201cfully consumed\u201d their former partner stars through the mass transfer process.\n(These have sometimes been called \u201cblack widow pulsars.\u201d) 782 23 \u2022 The Death of Stars\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView thisshort video(https://openstax.org/l/30scotronvid)to see Dr. Scott Ransom, of the National Radio\nAstronomy Observatory, explain how millisecond pulsars come about, with some nice animations.\nAnd if you thought that a neutron star interacting with a \u201cnormal\u201d star was unusual, there are also binary\nsystems that consist of two neutron stars. One such system has the stars in very close orbits to one another,\nso much that they continually alter each other\u2019s orbit. Another binary neutron star system includes two\npulsars that are orbiting each other every 2 hours and 25 minutes. As we discussed earlier, pulsars radiate\naway their energy, and these two pulsars are slowly moving toward one another, such that in about 85 million\nyears, they will actually merge (see Gravitational Wave Astronomy for our first observations of such a merger).\nWe have now reached the end of our description of the final stages of stars, yet one piece of the story remains\nto be filled in. We saw that stars whose core masses are less than 1.4M at the time they run out of fuel end\nSun\ntheir lives as white dwarfs. Dying stars with core masses between 1.4 and about 3M become neutron stars.\nSun\nBut there are stars whose core masses are greater than 3M when they exhaust their fuel supplies. What\nSun\nbecomes of them? The truly bizarre result of the death of such massive stellar cores (called ablack hole) is the\nsubject of our next chapter. But first, we will look at an astronomical mystery that turned out to be related to\nthe deaths of stars and was solved through clever sleuthing and a combination of observation and theory.\n23.6 The Mystery of the Gamma-Ray Bursts\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nGive a brief history of howgamma-ray bursts were discovered and what instruments made the discovery\npossible\nExplain why astronomers think that gamma-ray bursts beam their energy rather than it radiating\nuniformly in all directions\nDescribe how the radiation from a gamma-ray burst and its afterglow is produced\nExplain how short-duration gamma-ray bursts differ from longer ones, and describe the process that\nmakes short-duration gamma-ray bursts\nExplain why gamma-ray bursts may help us understand the early universe\nEverybody loves a good mystery, and astronomers are no exception. The mystery we will discuss in this section\nwas first discovered in the mid-1960s, not via astronomical research, but as a result of a search for the tell-tale\nsigns of nuclear weapon explosions. The US Defense Department launched a series ofVelasatellites to make\nsure that no country was violating a treaty that banned the detonation of nuclear weapons in space.\nSince nuclear explosions produce the most energetic form of electromagnetic waves calledgamma rays(see\nRadiation and Spectra), theVelasatellites contained detectors to search for this type of radiation. The satellites\ndid not detect any confirmed events from human activities, but they did\u2014to everyone\u2019s surprise\u2014detect short\nbursts of gamma rays coming from random directions in the sky. News of the discovery was first published in\n1973; however, the origin of the bursts remained a mystery. No one knew what produced the brief flashes of\ngamma rays or how far away the sources were.\nFrom a Few Bursts to Thousands\nWith the launch of theCompton Gamma-Ray Observatoryby NASA in 1991, astronomers began to identify\nmany more bursts and to learn more about them (Figure 23.19). Approximately once per day, the NASA\nsatellite detected a flash of gamma rays somewhere in the sky that lasted from a fraction of a second to\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23.6 \u2022 The Mystery of the Gamma-Ray Bursts 783\nseveral hundred seconds. Before the Compton measurements, astronomers had expected that the most likely\nplace for the bursts to come from was the main disk of our own (pancake-shaped) Galaxy. If this had been the\ncase, however, more bursts would have been seen in the crowded plane of the Milky Way than above or below\nit. Instead, the sources of the bursts were distributedisotropically; that is, they could appear anywhere in the\nsky with no preference for one region over another. Almost never did a second burst come from the same\nlocation.\nFigure23.19Compton Detects Gamma-Ray Bursts.(a) In 1991, the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory was deployed by the Space\nShuttle Atlantis. Weighing more than 16 tons, it was one of the largest scientific payloads ever launched into space. (b) This map of\ngamma-ray burst positions measured by the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory shows the isotropic (same in all directions), uniform\ndistribution of bursts on the sky. The map is oriented so that the disk of the Milky Way would stretch across the center line (or\nequator) of the oval. Note that the bursts show no preference at all for the plane of the Milky Way, as many other types of objects in\nthe sky do. Colors indicate the total energy in the burst: red dots indicate long-duration, bright bursts; blue and purple dots show\nshort, weaker bursts. (credit a: modification of work by NASA; credit b: modification of work by NASA/GSFC)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTo get a good visual sense of the degree to which the bursts come from all over the sky, watch this short\nanimatedNASA video(https://openstax.org/l/30swiftnasavid)showing the location of the first 500 bursts\nfound by the laterSwiftsatellite.\nFor several years, astronomers actively debated whether the burst sources were relatively nearby or very far\naway\u2014the two possibilities for bursts that are isotropically distributed. Nearby locations might include the\ncloud of comets that surrounds the solar system or the halo of our Galaxy, which is large and spherical, and\nalso surrounds us in all directions. If, on the other hand, the bursts occurred at very large distances, they could\ncome from faraway galaxies, which are also distributed uniformly in all directions.\nBoth the very local and the very distant hypotheses required something strange to be going on. If the bursts\nwere coming from the cold outer reaches of our own solar system or from the halo of our Galaxy, then\nastronomers had to hypothesize some new kind of physical process that could produce unpredictable flashes\nof high-energy gamma rays in these otherwise-quiet regions of space. And if the bursts came from galaxies\nmillions or billions of light-years away, then they must be extremely powerful to be observable at such large\ndistances; indeed they had to be the among the biggest explosions in the universe.\nThe First Afterglows\nThe problem with trying to figure out the source of the gamma-ray bursts was that our instruments for\ndetecting gamma rays could not pinpoint the exact place in the sky where the burst was happening. Early\ngamma-ray telescopes did not have sufficientresolution.This was frustrating because astronomers suspected\nthat if theycouldpinpoint the exact position of one of these rapid bursts, then they would be able to identify a 784 23 \u2022 The Death of Stars\ncounterpart (such as a star or galaxy) at other wavelengths and learn much more about the burst, including\nwhere it came from. This would, however, require either major improvements in gamma-ray detector\ntechnology to provide better resolution or detection of the burst at some other wavelength. In the end, both\ntechniques played a role.\nThe breakthrough came with the launch of the Italian DutchBeppoSAXsatellite in 1996.BeppoSAXincluded a\nnew type of gamma-ray telescope capable of identifying the position of a source much more accurately than\nprevious instruments, to within a few minutes of arc on the sky. By itself, however, it was still not sophisticated\nenough to determine the exact source of the gamma-ray burst. After all, a box a few minutes of arc on a side\ncould still contain many stars or other celestial objects.\nHowever, the angular resolution ofBeppoSAXwas good enough to tell astronomers where to point other,\nmore precise telescopes in the hopes of detecting longer-lived electromagnetic emission from the bursts at\nother wavelengths. Detection of a burst at visible-light or radio wavelengths could provide a position accurate\nto a fewsecondsof arc and allow the position to be pinpointed to an individual star or galaxy.BeppoSAX\ncarried its own X-ray telescope onboard the spacecraft to look for such a counterpart, and astronomers using\nvisible-light and radio facilities on the ground were eager to search those wavelengths as well.\nTwo crucialBeppoSAXburst observations in 1997 helped to resolve the mystery of the gamma-ray bursts. The\nfirst burst came in February from the direction of the constellation Orion. Within 8 hours, astronomers\nworking with the satellite had identified the position of the burst, and reoriented the spacecraft to focus\nBeppoSAX\u2019s X-ray detector on the source. To their excitement, they detected a slowly fading X-ray source 8\nhours after the event\u2014the first successful detection of anafterglowfrom a gamma-ray burst. This provided an\neven-better location of the burst (accurate to about 40 seconds of arc), which was then distributed to\nastronomers across the world to try to detect it at even longer wavelengths.\nThat very night, the 4.2-meter William Herschel Telescope on the Canary Islands found a fading visible-light\nsource at the same position as the X-ray afterglow, confirming that such an afterglow could be detected in\nvisible light as well. Eventually, the afterglow faded away, but left behind at the location of the original\ngamma-ray burst was a faint, fuzzy source right where the fading point of light had been\u2014a distant galaxy\n(Figure 23.20). This was the first piece of evidence that gamma-ray bursts were indeed very energetic objects\nfrom very far away. However, it also remained possible that the burst source was much closer to us and just\nhappened to align with a more distant galaxy, so this one observation alone was not a conclusive\ndemonstration of the extragalactic origin of gamma-ray bursts.\nFigure23.20Gamma-Ray Burst.This false-color Hubble Space Telescope image, taken in September 1997, shows the fading\nafterglow of the gamma-ray burst of February 28, 1997 and the host galaxy in which the burst originated. The left view shows the\nregion of the burst. The enlargement shows the burst source and what appears to be its host galaxy.

(credit: modification of work by Andrew Fruchter (STScI), Elena Pian (ITSRE-CNR), and NASA,\nESA)\nOn May 8 of the same year, a burst came from the direction of the constellation Camelopardalis. In a\ncoordinated international effort,BeppoSAXagain fixed a reasonably precise position, and almost immediately\na telescope on Kitt Peak in Arizona was able to catch the visible-light afterglow. Within 2 days, the largest\ntelescope in the world (the Keck in Hawaii) collected enough light to record a spectrum of the burst. The May\ngamma-ray burst afterglow spectrum showed absorption features from a fuzzy object that was 4 billion light-\nyears from the Sun, meaning that the location of the burst had to be at least this far away\u2014and possibly even\nfarther. (How astronomers can get the distance of such an object from the Doppler shift in the spectrum is\nsomething we will discuss inGalaxies.) What that spectrum showed was clear evidence that the gamma-ray\nburst had taken place in a distant galaxy.\nNetworking to Catch More Bursts\nAfter initial observations showed that the precise locations and afterglows of gamma-ray bursts could be\nfound, astronomers set up a system to catch and pinpoint bursts on a regular basis. But to respond as quickly\nas needed to obtain usable results, astronomers realized that they needed to rely on automated systems\nrather than human observers happening to be in the right place at the right time.\nNow, when an orbiting high-energy telescope discovers a burst, its rough location is immediately transmitted\nto aGamma-Ray Coordinates Networkbased at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center, alerting observers on\nthe ground within a few seconds to look for the visible-light afterglow.\nThe first major success with this system was achieved by a team of astronomers from the University of\nMichigan, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and Los Alamos National Laboratories, who designed an\nautomated device they called theRobotic Optical Transient Search Experiment(ROTSE), which detected a very\nbright visible-light counterpart in 1999. At peak, the burst was almost as bright as Neptune\u2014despite a distance\n(measured later by spectra from larger telescopes) of 9 billion light-years.\nMore recently, astronomers have been able to take this a step further, using wide-field-of-view telescopes to\nstare at large fractions of the sky in the hope that a gamma-ray burst will occur at the right place and time,\nand be recorded by the telescope\u2019s camera. These wide-field telescopes are not sensitive to faint sources, but\nROTSE showed that gamma-ray burst afterglows could sometimes be very bright.\nAstronomers\u2019 hopes were vindicated in March 2008, when an extremely bright gamma-ray burst occurred and\nits light was captured by two wide-field camera systems in Chile: the Polish \u201cPi of the Sky\u201d and the Russian-\nItalian TORTORA [Telescopio Ottimizzato per la Ricerca dei Transienti Ottici Rapidi (Italian for Telescope\nOptimized for the Research of Rapid Optical Transients)] (seeFigure 23.21). According to the data taken by\nthese telescopes, for a period of about 30 seconds, the light from the gamma-ray burst was bright enough\nthat it could have been seen by the unaided eye had a person been looking in the right place at the right time.\nAdding to our amazement, later observations by larger telescopes demonstrated that the burst occurred at a\ndistance of 8 billion light-years from Earth! 786 23 \u2022 The Death of Stars\nFigure23.21Gamma-Ray Burst Observed in March 2008.The extremely luminous afterglow of GRB 080319B was imaged by the\nSwift Observatory in X-rays (left) and visible light/ultraviolet (right). (credit: modification of work by NASA/Swift/Stefan Immler, et al.)\nTo Beam or Not to Beam\nThe enormous distances to these events meant they had to have been astoundingly energetic to appear as\nbright as they were across such an enormous distance. In fact, they required so much energy that it posed a\nproblem for gamma-ray burst models: if the source was radiating energy in all directions, then the energy\nreleased in gamma rays alone during a bright burst (such as the 1999 or 2008 events) would have been\nequivalent to the energy produced if the entire mass of a Sun-like star were suddenly converted into pure\nradiation.\nFor a source to produce this much energy this quickly (in a burst) is a real challenge. Even if the star producing\nthe gamma-ray burst was much more massive than the Sun (as is probably the case), there is no known means\nof converting so much mass into radiation within a matter of seconds. However, there is one way to reduce the\npower required of the \u201cmechanism\u201d that makesgamma-ray bursts. So far, our discussion has assumed that\nthe source of the gamma rays gives off the same amount of energy in all directions, like an incandescent light\nbulb.\nBut as we discuss inPulsars and the Discovery of Neutron Stars, not all sources of radiation in the universe are\nlike this. Some produce thin beams of radiation that are concentrated into only one or two directions. A laser\npointer and a lighthouse on the ocean are examples of such beamed sources on Earth (Figure 23.22). If, when\na burst occurs, the gamma rays come out in only one or two narrow beams, then our estimates of the\nluminosity of the source can be reduced, and the bursts may be easier to explain. In that case, however, the\nbeam has to point toward Earth for us to be able to see the burst. This, in turn, would imply that for every\nburst we see from Earth, there are probably many others that we never detect because their beams point in\nother directions.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23.6 \u2022 The Mystery of the Gamma-Ray Bursts 787\nFigure23.22Burst That Is Beamed.This artist\u2019s conception shows an illustration of one kind of gamma-ray burst. The collapse of\nthe core of a massive star into a black hole has produced two bright beams of light originating from the star\u2019s poles, which an\nobserver pointed along one of these axes would see as a gamma-ray burst. The hot blue stars and gas clouds in the vicinity are\nmeant to show that the event happened in an active star-forming region. (credit: NASA/Swift/Mary Pat Hrybyk-Keith and John Jones)\nLong-Duration Gamma-Ray Bursts: Exploding Stars\nAfter identifying and following large numbers of gamma-ray bursts, astronomers began to piece together\nclues about what kind of event is thought to be responsible for producing the gamma-ray burst. Or, rather,\nwhat kind ofevents, because there are at least two distinct types ofgamma-ray bursts. The two\u2014like the\ndifferent types of supernovae\u2014are produced in completely different ways.\nObservationally, the crucial distinction is how long the burst lasts. Astronomers now divide gamma-ray bursts\ninto two categories: short-duration ones (defined as lasting less than 2 seconds, but typically a fraction of a\nsecond) and long-duration ones (defined as lasting more than 2 seconds, but typically about a minute).\nAll of the examples we have discussed so far concern thelong-duration gamma-ray bursts. These constitute\nmost of the gamma-ray bursts that our satellites detect, and they are also brighter and easier to pinpoint.\nMany hundreds of long-duration gamma-ray bursts, and the properties of the galaxies in which they occurred,\nhave now been studied in detail. Long-duration gamma-ray bursts are universally observed to come from\ndistant galaxies that are still actively making stars. They are usually found to be located in regions of the\ngalaxy with strong star-formation activity (such as spiral arms). Recall that the more massive a star is, the less\ntime it spends in each stage of its life. This suggests that the bursts come from a young and short-lived, and\ntherefore massive type of star.\nFurthermore, in several cases when a burst has occurred in a galaxy relatively close to Earth (within a few\nbillion light-years), it has been possible to search for a supernova at the same position\u2014and in nearly all of\nthese cases, astronomers have found evidence of a supernova of type Ic going off. A type Ic is a particular type\nof supernova, which we did not discuss in the earlier parts of this chapter; these are produced by a massive\nstar that has been stripped of its outer hydrogen layer. However, only a tiny fraction oftype Ic supernovae\nproduce gamma-ray bursts.\nWhy would a massive star with its outer layers missing sometimes produce agamma-ray burstat the same\ntime that it explodes as a supernova? The explanation astronomers have in mind for the extra energy is the\ncollapse of the star\u2019s core to form a spinning, magneticblack holeorneutron star. Because the star corpse is\nboth magnetic and spinning rapidly, its sudden collapse is complex and can produce swirling jets of particles\nand powerful beams of radiation\u2014just like in a quasar or active galactic nucleus (objects you will learn about 788 23 \u2022 The Death of Stars\nActive Galaxies, Quasars, and Supermassive Black Holes), but on a much faster timescale. A small amount of\nthe infalling mass is ejected in a narrow beam, moving at speeds close to that of light. Collisions among the\nparticles in the beam can produce intense bursts of energy that we see as a gamma-ray burst.\nWithin a few minutes, the expanding blast from the fireball plows into the interstellar matter in the dying star\u2019s\nneighborhood. This matter might have been ejected from the star itself at earlier stages in its evolution.\nAlternatively, it could be the gas out of which the massive star and its neighbors formed.\nAs the high-speed particles from the blast are slowed, they transfer their energy to the surrounding matter in\nthe form of a shock wave. That shocked material emits radiation at longer wavelengths. This accounts for the\nafterglow of X-rays, visible light, and radio waves\u2014the glow comes at longer and longer wavelengths as the\nblast continues to lose energy.\nShort-Duration Gamma-Ray Bursts: Colliding Stellar Corpses\nWhat about the shorter gamma-ray bursts? The gamma-ray emission from these events lasts less than 2\nseconds, and in some cases may last only milliseconds\u2014an amazingly short time. Such a timescale is difficult\nto achieve if they are produced in the same way as long-duration gamma-ray bursts, since the collapse of the\nstellar interior onto the black hole should take at least a few seconds.\nAstronomers looked fruitlessly for afterglows fromshort-duration gamma-ray bursts found byBeppoSAXand\nother satellites. Evidently, the afterglows fade away too quickly. Fast-responding visible-light telescopes like\nROTSE were not helpful either: no matter how fast these telescopes responded, the bursts were not bright\nenough at visible wavelengths to be detected by these small telescopes.\nOnce again, it took a new satellite to clear up the mystery. In this case, it was theSwiftGamma-Ray Burst\nSatellite, launched in 2004 by a collaboration between NASA and the Italian and UK space agencies (Figure\n23.23). The design ofSwiftis similar to that ofBeppoSAX. However,Swiftis much more agile and flexible: after\na gamma-ray burst occurs, the X-ray and UV telescopes can be repointed automatically within a few minutes\n(rather than a few hours). Thus, astronomers can observe the afterglow much earlier, when it is expected to be\nmuch brighter. Furthermore, the X-ray telescope is far more sensitive and can provide positions that are 30\ntimes more precise than those provided byBeppoSAX, allowing bursts to be identified even without visible-\nlight or radio observations.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23.6 \u2022 The Mystery of the Gamma-Ray Bursts 789\nFigure23.23Artist\u2019s Illustration ofSwift.The US/UK/Italian spacecraftSwiftcontains on-board gamma-ray, X-ray, and ultraviolet\ndetectors, and has the ability to automatically reorient itself to a gamma-ray burst detected by the gamma-ray instrument. Since its\nlaunch in 2005,Swifthas detected and observed over a thousand bursts, including dozens of short-duration bursts. (credit: NASA,\nSpectrum Astro)\nOn May 9, 2005,Swiftdetected a flash of gamma rays lasting 0.13 seconds in duration, originating from the\nconstellation Coma Berenices. Remarkably, the galaxy at the X-ray position looked completely different from\nany galaxy in which a long-duration burst had been seen to occur. The afterglow originated from the halo of a\ngiant elliptical galaxy 2.7 billion light-years away, with no signs of any young, massive stars in its spectrum.\nFurthermore, no supernova was ever detected after the burst, despite extensive searching.\nWhat could produce a burst less than a second long, originating from a region with no star formation? The\nleading model involves themergerof two compact stellar corpses: two neutron stars, or perhaps aneutron\nstarand ablack hole. Since many stars come in binary or multiple systems, it\u2019s possible to have systems where\ntwo such star corpses orbit one another. According to general relativity (which will be discussed inBlack Holes\nand Curved Spacetime), the orbits of a binary star system composed of such objects should slowly decay with\ntime, eventually (after millions or billions of years) causing the two objects to slam together in a violent but\nbrief explosion. Because the decay of the binary orbit is so slow, we would expect more of these mergers to\noccur in old galaxies in which star formation has long since stopped.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTo learn more about the merger of two neutron stars and how they can produce a burst that lasts less than\na second, check out thiscomputer simulation(https://openstax.org/l/30comsimneustr)by NASA.\nWhile it was impossible to be sure of this model based on only a single event (it is possible this burst actually\ncame from a background galaxy and lined up with the giant elliptical only by chance), several dozen more\nshort-duration gamma-ray bursts have since been located bySwift, many of which also originate from galaxies\nwith very low star-formation rates. This has given astronomers greater confidence that this model is the\ncorrect one. Still, to be fully convinced, astronomers are searching for a \u201csmoking gun\u201d signature for the 790 23 \u2022 The Death of Stars\nmerger of two ultra-dense stellar remnants.\nAstronomers identified two observations that would provide more direct evidence. Theoretical calculations\nindicate that when two neutron stars collide there will be a very special kind of explosion; neutrons stripped\nfrom the neutron stars during the violent final phase of the merger will fuse together into heavy elements and\nthen release heat due to radioactivity, producing a short-lived but red supernova sometimes called akilonova.\n(The term is used because it is about a thousand times brighter than an ordinary nova, but not quite as\n\u201csuper\u201d as a traditional supernova.) Hubble observations of one short-duration gamma-ray burst in 2013\nshowed suggestive evidence of such a signature, but needed to be confirmed by future observations.\nThe second \u201csmoking gun\u201d is the detection ofgravitational waves.As will be discussed inBlack Holes and\nCurved Spacetime,gravitational wavesare ripples in the fabric of spacetime that general relativity predicts\nshould be produced by the acceleration of extremely massive and dense objects\u2014such as two neutron stars or\nblack holes spiraling toward each other and colliding. The construction of instruments to detect gravitational\nwaves is very challenging technically, and gravitational wave astronomy became feasible only in 2015. The first\nfew detected gravitational wave events were produced by mergers of black holes. In 2017, however,\ngravitational waves were observed from a source that was coincident in time and space with a gamma-ray\nburst. The source consisted of two objects with the masses of neutron stars. A red supernova was also\nobserved at this location, and the ejected material was rich in heavy elements. This observation not only\nconfirms the theory of the origin of short gamma-ray bursts, but also is a spectacular demonstration of the\nvalidity of Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity.\nProbing the Universe with Gamma-Ray Bursts\nThe story of how astronomers came to explain the origin of the different kinds of bursts is a good example of\nhow the scientific process sometimes resembles good detective work. While the mystery of short-duration\ngamma-ray bursts is still being unraveled, the focus of studies for long-duration gamma-ray bursts has begun\nto change from understanding the origin of the bursts themselves (which is now fairly well-established) to\nusing them as tools to understand the broader universe.\nThe reason that long-duration gamma-ray bursts are useful has to do with their extreme luminosities, if only\nfor a short time. In fact, long-duration gamma-ray bursts are so bright that they could easily be seen at\ndistances that correspond to a few hundred million years after the expansion of the universe began, which is\nwhen theorists think that the first generation of stars formed. Some theories predict that the first stars are\nlikely to be massive and complete their evolution in only a million years or so. If this turns out to be the case,\nthen gamma-ray bursts (which signal the death of some of these stars) may provide us with the best way of\nprobing the universe when stars and galaxies first began to form.\nSo far, the most distant gamma-ray burst found (on April 29, 2009) was in a galaxy with a redshift that\ncorresponds to a remarkable 13.2 billion light years\u2014meaning it happened only 600 million years after the Big\nBang itself. This is comparable to the earliest and most distant galaxies found by the Hubble Space Telescope.\nIt is not quite old enough to expect that it formed from the first generation of stars, but its appearance at this\ndistance still gives us useful information about the production of stars in the early universe. Astronomers\ncontinue to scan the skies, looking for even more distant events signaling the deaths of stars from even\nfurther back in time.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 23 \u2022 Key Terms 791\nKey Terms\nChandrasekhar limit the upper limit to the mass of a white dwarf (equals 1.4 times the mass of the Sun)\ndegenerate gas a gas that resists further compression because no two electrons can be in the same place at\nthe same time doing the same thing (Pauli exclusion principle)\nmillisecond pulsar a pulsar that rotates so quickly that it can give off hundreds of pulses per second (and its\nperiod is therefore measured in milliseconds)\nneutron star a compact object of extremely high density composed almost entirely of neutrons\nnova the cataclysmic explosion produced in a binary system, temporarily increasing its luminosity by\nhundreds to thousands of times\npulsar a variable radio source of small physical size that emits very rapid radio pulses in very regular periods\nthat range from fractions of a second to several seconds; now understood to be a rotating, magnetic\nneutron star that is energetic enough to produce a detectable beam of radiation and particles\ntype II supernova a stellar explosion produced at the endpoint of the evolution of stars whose mass exceeds\nroughly 10 times the mass of the Sun\nSummary\n23.1The Death of Low-Mass Stars\nDuring the course of their evolution, stars shed their outer layers and lose a significant fraction of their initial\nmass. Stars with masses of 8M or less can lose enough mass to become white dwarfs, which have masses\nSun\nless than the Chandrasekhar limit (about 1.4M ). The pressure exerted by degenerate electrons keeps white\nSun\ndwarfs from contracting to still-smaller diameters. Eventually, white dwarfs cool off to becomeblack dwarfs,\nstellar remnants made mainly of carbon, oxygen, and neon.\n23.2Evolution of Massive Stars: An Explosive Finish\nIn a massive star, hydrogen fusion in the core is followed by several other fusion reactions involving heavier\nelements. Just before it exhausts all sources of energy, a massive star has an iron core surrounded by shells of\nsilicon, sulfur, oxygen, neon, carbon, helium, and hydrogen. The fusion of iron requires energy (rather than\nreleasing it). If the mass of a star\u2019s iron core exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit (but is less than 3M ), the core\nSun\ncollapses until its density exceeds that of an atomic nucleus, forming a neutron star with a typical diameter of\n20 kilometers. The core rebounds and transfers energy outward, blowing off the outer layers of the star in a\ntype II supernova explosion.\n23.3Supernova Observations\nA supernova occurs on average once every 25 to 100 years in the Milky Way Galaxy. Despite the odds, no\nsupernova in our Galaxy has been observed from Earth since the invention of the telescope. However, one\nnearby supernova (SN 1987A) has been observed in a neighboring galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud. The\nstar that evolved to become SN 1987A began its life as a blue supergiant, evolved to become a red supergiant,\nand returned to being a blue supergiant at the time it exploded. Studies of SN 1987A have detected neutrinos\nfrom the core collapse and confirmed theoretical calculations of what happens during such explosions,\nincluding the formation of elements beyond iron. Supernovae are a main source of high-energy cosmic rays\nand can be dangerous for any living organisms in nearby star systems.\n23.4Pulsars and the Discovery of Neutron Stars\nAt least some supernovae leave behind a highly magnetic, rapidly rotating neutron star, which can be\nobserved as a pulsar if its beam of escaping particles and focused radiation is pointing toward us. Pulsars emit\nrapid pulses of radiation at regular intervals; their periods are in the range of 0.001 to 10 seconds. The rotating\nneutron star acts like a lighthouse, sweeping its beam in a circle and giving us a pulse of radiation when the\nbeam sweeps over Earth. As pulsars age, they lose energy, their rotations slow, and their periods increase. 792 23 \u2022 For Further Exploration\n23.5The Evolution of Binary Star Systems\nWhen a white dwarf or neutron star is a member of a close binary star system, its companion star can transfer\nmass to it. Material fallinggraduallyonto a white dwarf can explode in a sudden burst of fusion and make a\nnova. If material fallsrapidlyonto a white dwarf, it can push it over the Chandrasekhar limit and cause it to\nexplode completely as a type Ia supernova. Another possible mechanism for a type Ia supernova is the merger\nof two white dwarfs. Material falling onto a neutron star can cause powerful bursts of X-ray radiation. Transfer\nof material and angular momentum can speed up the rotation of pulsars until their periods are just a few\nthousandths of a second.\n23.6The Mystery of the Gamma-Ray Bursts\nGamma-ray bursts last from a fraction of a second to a few minutes. They come from all directions and are\nnow known to be associated with very distant objects. The energy is most likely beamed, and, for the ones we\ncan detect, Earth lies in the direction of the beam. Long-duration bursts (lasting more than a few seconds)\ncome from massive stars with their outer hydrogen layers missing that explode as supernovae. Short-duration\nbursts are believed to be mergers of stellar corpses (neutron stars or black holes).\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nDeath of Stars\nHillebrandt, W., et al. \u201cHow To Blow Up a Star.\u201dScientific American(October 2006): 42.

Discuss what\nmeasurements you could make to determine whether you have discovered a planetary nebula or the\nremnant of a supernova explosion.\nB. The star Sirius (the brightest star in our northern skies) has a white-dwarf companion. Sirius has a mass of\nabout 2M and is still on the main sequence, while its companion is already a star corpse. Remember\nSun\nthat a white dwarf can\u2019t have a mass greater than 1.4M . Assuming that the two stars formed at the\nSun\nsame time, your group should discuss how Sirius could have a white-dwarf companion. Hint: Was the\ninitial mass of the white-dwarf star larger or smaller than that of Sirius?\nC. Discuss with your group what people today would do if a brilliant star suddenly became visible during the\ndaytime? What kind of fear and superstition might result from a supernova that was really bright in our\nskies? Have your group invent some headlines that the tabloid newspapers and the less responsible web\nnews outlets would feature.\nD. Suppose a supernova exploded only 40 light-years from Earth. Have your group discuss what effects there\nmay be on Earth when the radiation reaches us and later when the particles reach us. Would there be any\nway to protect people from the supernova effects?\nE. When pulsars were discovered, the astronomers involved with the discovery talked about finding \u201clittle\ngreen men.\u201d If you had been in their shoes, what tests would you have performed to see whether such a\npulsating source of radio waves was natural or the result of an alien intelligence? Today, several groups\naround the world are actively searching for possible radio signals from intelligent civilizations. How might\nyou expect such signals to differ from pulsar signals?\nF. Your little brother, who has not had the benefit of an astronomy course, reads about white dwarfs and\nneutron stars in a magazine and decides it would be fun to go near them or even try to land on them. Is\nthis a good idea for future tourism? Have your group make a list of reasons it would not be safe for\nchildren (or adults) to go near a white dwarf and a neutron star.\nG. A lot of astronomers\u2019 time and many instruments have been devoted to figuring out the nature of\ngamma-ray bursts.

Suppose no stars more massive than about 2M had ever formed. Would life as we know it have been\nSun\nable to develop? Why or why not?\n19. Would you be more likely to observe a type II supernova (the explosion of a massive star) in a globular\ncluster or in an open cluster? Why?\n20. Astronomers believe there are something like 100 million neutron stars in the Galaxy, yet we have only\nfound about 2000 pulsars in the Milky Way. Give several reasons these numbers are so different.

How would the spectra of a type II supernova be different from a type Ia supernova? Hint: Consider the\ncharacteristics of the objects that are their source.\nFiguring for Yourself\n31. The ring around SN 1987A (Figure 23.12) initially became illuminated when energetic photons from the\nsupernova interacted with the material in the ring. The radius of the ring is approximately 0.75 light-year\nfrom the supernova location. How long after the supernova did the ring become illuminated?\n32. What is the acceleration of gravity (g) at the surface of the Sun? (SeeAppendix Efor the Sun\u2019s key\ncharacteristics.) How much greater is this thangat the surface of Earth? Calculate what you would weigh\non the surface of the Sun. Your weight would be your Earth weight multiplied by the ratio of the\nacceleration of gravity on the Sun to the acceleration of gravity on Earth. (Okay, we know that the Sun\ndoes not have a solid surface to stand on and that you would be vaporized if you were at the Sun\u2019s\nphotosphere. Humor us for the sake of doing these calculations.)\n33. What is the escape velocity from the Sun? How much greater is it than the escape velocity from Earth?\n34. What is the average density of the Sun? How does it compare to the average density of Earth?\n35. Say that a particular white dwarf has the mass of the Sun but the radius of Earth. What is the acceleration\nof gravity at the surface of the white dwarf? How much greater is this thangat the surface of Earth? What\nwould you weigh at the surface of the white dwarf (again granting us the dubious notion that you could\nsurvive there)?\n36. What is the escape velocity from the white dwarf inExercise 23.35? How much greater is it than the escape\nvelocity from Earth?\n37. What is the average density of the white dwarf inExercise 23.35? How does it compare to the average\ndensity of Earth?\n38. Now take a neutron star that has twice the mass of the Sun but a radius of 10 km. What is the acceleration\nof gravity at the surface of the neutron star? How much greater is this thangat the surface of Earth?\nWhat would you weigh at the surface of the neutron star (provided you could somehow not become a\npuddle of protoplasm)?\n39. What is the escape velocity from the neutron star inExercise 23.38? How much greater is it than the\nescape velocity from Earth?\n40. What is the average density of the neutron star inExercise 23.38? How does it compare to the average\ndensity of Earth?\n41. One way to calculate the radius of a star is to use its luminosity and temperature and assume that the star\nradiates approximately like a blackbody. Astronomers have measured the characteristics of central stars\nof planetary nebulae and have found that a typical central star is 16 times as luminous and 20 times as hot\n(about 110,000 K) as the Sun. Find the radius in terms of the Sun\u2019s. How does this radius compare with\nthat of a typical white dwarf?\n42. According to a model described in the text, a neutron star has a radius of about 10 km. Assume that the\npulses occur once per rotation. According to Einstein\u2019s theory of relatively, nothing can move faster than\nthe speed of light. Check to make sure that this pulsar model does not violate relativity. Calculate the\nrotation speed of the Crab Nebula pulsar at its equator, given its period of 0.033 s. (Remember that\ndistance equals velocity \u00d7 time and that the circumference of a circle is given by 2\u03c0R).\n43. Do the same calculations as inExercise 23.42but for a pulsar that rotates 1000 times per second.\n44. If the Sun were replaced by a white dwarf with a surface temperature of 10,000 K and a radius equal to\nEarth\u2019s, how would its luminosity compare to that of the Sun? 798 23 \u2022 Exercises\n45. A supernova can eject material at a velocity of 10,000 km/s. How long would it take a supernova remnant\nto expand to a radius of 1 AU? How long would it take to expand to a radius of 1 light-years? Assume that\nthe expansion velocity remains constant and use the relationship:\n46. A supernova remnant was observed in 2007 to be expanding at a velocity of 14,000 km/s and had a radius\nof 6.5 light-years. Assuming a constant expansion velocity, in what year did this supernova occur?\n47. The ring around SN 1987A (Figure 23.12) started interacting with material propelled by the shockwave\nfrom the supernova beginning in 1997 (10 years after the explosion). The radius of the ring is\napproximately 0.75 light-year from the supernova location. How fast is the supernova material moving,\nassume a constant rate of motion in km/s?\n48. Before the star that became SN 1987A exploded, it evolved from a red supergiant to a blue supergiant\nwhile remaining at the same luminosity. As a red supergiant, its surface temperature would have been\napproximately 4000 K, while as a blue supergiant, its surface temperature was 16,000 K. How much did the\nradius change as it evolved from a red to a blue supergiant?\n49. What is the radius of the progenitor star that became SN 1987A? Its luminosity was 100,000 times that of\nthe Sun, and it had a surface temperature of 16,000 K.\n50. What is the acceleration of gravity at the surface of the star that became SN 1987A? How does thisg\ncompare to that at the surface of Earth? The mass was 20 times that of the Sun and the radius was 41\ntimes that of the Sun.\n51. What was the escape velocity from the surface of the SN 1987A progenitor star? How much greater is it\nthan the escape velocity from Earth? The mass was 20 times that of the Sun and the radius was 41 times\nthat of the Sun.\n52. What was the average density of the star that became SN 1987A? How does it compare to the average\ndensity of Earth? The mass was 20 times that of the Sun and the radius was 41 times that of the Sun.\n53.

Cygnus X-1 is in a binary star system, and the artist\u2019s illustration on the right shows the black hole pulling\nmaterial away from a massive blue companion star. This material forms a disk (shown in red and orange) that rotates around the\nblack hole before falling into it or being redirected away from the black hole in the form of powerful jets. The material in the disk\n(before it falls into the black hole) is so hot that it glows with X-rays, explaining why this object is an X-ray source.

But the\ntruth about black holes is almost stranger than fiction. As we continue our voyage into the universe, we will\ndiscover that black holes are the key to explaining many mysterious and remarkable objects\u2014including\ncollapsed stars and the active centers of giant galaxies. 800 24 \u2022 Black Holes and Curved Spacetime\n24.1 Introducing General Relativity\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDiscuss some of the key ideas of the theory of general relativity\nRecognize that one\u2019s experiences of gravity and acceleration are interchangeable and indistinguishable\nDistinguish betweenNewtonian ideas of gravity andEinsteinian ideas of gravity\nRecognize why the theory of general relativity is necessary for understanding the nature of black holes\nMost stars end their lives as white dwarfs or neutron stars. When averymassive star collapses at the end of its\nlife, however, not even the mutual repulsion between densely packed neutrons can support the core against\nits own weight. If the remaining mass of the star\u2019s core is more than about three times that of the Sun (M ),\nSun\nour theories predict thatno known force can stop it from collapsing forever!Gravity simply overwhelms all\nother forces and crushes the core until it occupies an infinitely small volume. A star in which this occurs may\nbecome one of the strangest objects ever predicted by theory\u2014a black hole.\nTo understand what a black hole is like and how it influences its surroundings, we need a theory that can\ndescribe the action of gravity under such extreme circumstances. To date, our best theory of gravity is the\ngeneral theory of relativity, which was put forward in 1916 by Albert Einstein.\nGeneral relativity was one of the major intellectual achievements of the twentieth century; if it were music, we\nwould compare it to the great symphonies of Beethoven or Mahler. Until recently, however, scientists had little\nneed for a better theory of gravity; Isaac Newton\u2019s ideas that led to his law of universal gravitation (seeOrbits\nand Gravity) are perfectly sufficient for most of the objects we deal with in everyday life. In the past half\ncentury, however, general relativity has become more than just a beautiful idea; it is now essential in\nunderstanding pulsars, quasars (which will be discussed inActive Galaxies, Quasars, and Supermassive Black\nHoles), and many other astronomical objects and events, including the black holes we will discuss here.\nWe should perhaps mention that this is the point in an astronomy course when many students start to feel a\nlittle nervous (and perhaps wish they had taken botany or some other earthbound course to satisfy the\nscience requirement). This is because in popular culture, Einstein has become a symbol for mathematical\nbrilliance that is simply beyond the reach of most people (Figure 24.2).\nFigure24.2Albert Einstein (1879\u20131955).This famous scientist, seen here younger than in the usual photos, has become a symbol\nfor high intellect in popular culture. (credit: NASA)\nSo, when we wrote that the theory of general relativity was Einstein\u2019s work, you may have worried just a bit,\nconvinced that anything Einstein did must be beyond your understanding. This popular view is unfortunate\nand mistaken. Although the detailed calculations of general relativity do involve a good deal of higher\nmathematics, the basic ideas are not difficult to understand (and are, in fact, almost poetic in the way they give\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24.1 \u2022 Introducing General Relativity 801\nus a new perspective on the world). Moreover, general relativity goes beyond Newton\u2019s famous \u201cinverse-\nsquare\u201d law of gravity; it helpsexplainhow matter interacts with other matter in space and time. This\nexplanatory power is one of the requirements that any successful scientific theory must meet.\nThe Principle of Equivalence\nThe fundamental insight that led to the formulation of the general theory of relativity starts with a very simple\nthought: if you were able to jump off a high building and fall freely, you would not feel your own weight. In this\nchapter, we will describe how Einstein built on this idea to reach sweeping conclusions about the very fabric of\nspace and time itself. He called it the \u201chappiest thought of my life.\u201d\nEinstein himself pointed out an everyday example that illustrates this effect (seeFigure 24.3). Notice how your\nweight seems to be reduced in a high-speed elevator when it accelerates from a stop to a rapid descent.\nSimilarly, your weight seems to increase in an elevator that starts to move quickly upward. This effect is not\njust a feeling you have: if you stood on a scale in such an elevator, you could measure your weight changing\n(you can actually perform this experiment in some science museums).\nFigure24.3Your Weight in an Elevator.In an elevator at rest, you feel your normal weight. In an elevator that accelerates as it\ndescends, you would feel lighter than normal. In an elevator that accelerates as it ascends, you would feel heavier than normal. If an\nevil villain cut the elevator cable, you would feel weightless as you fell to your doom.\nIn afreely fallingelevator, with no air friction, you would lose your weight altogether. We generally don\u2019t like\nto cut the cables holding elevators to try this experiment, but near-weightlessness can be achieved by taking\nan airplane to high altitude and then dropping rapidly for a while. This is how NASA trains its astronauts for\nthe experience of free fall in space; the scenes of weightlessness in the 1995 movieApollo 13were filmed in\nthe same way. (Moviemakers have since devised other methods using underwater filming, wire stunts, and\ncomputer graphics to create the appearance of weightlessness seen in such movies asGravityandThe\nMartian.) 802 24 \u2022 Black Holes and Curved Spacetime\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch how NASA uses a\u201cweightless\u201d environment(https://openstax.org/l/30NASAweightra)to help train\nastronauts.\nAnother way to state Einstein\u2019s idea is this: suppose we have a spaceship that contains a windowless\nlaboratory equipped with all the tools needed to perform scientific experiments. Now, imagine that an\nastronomer wakes up after a long night celebrating some scientific breakthrough and finds herself sealed into\nthis laboratory. She has no idea how it happened but notices that she is weightless. This could be because she\nand the laboratory are far away from any source of gravity, and both are either at rest or moving at some\nsteady speed through space (in which case she has plenty of time to wake up). But it could also be because\nshe and the laboratory are falling freely toward a planet like Earth (in which case she might first want to check\nher distance from the surface before making coffee).\nWhat Einstein postulated is that there is no experiment she can perform inside the sealed laboratory to\n1\ndetermine whether she is floating in space or falling freely in a gravitational field. As far as she is concerned,\nthe two situations are completelyequivalent. This idea that free fall is indistinguishable from, and hence\nequivalent to, zero gravity is called theequivalence principle.\nGravity or Acceleration?\nEinstein\u2019s simple idea has big consequences. Let\u2019s begin by considering what happens if two foolhardy people\njump from opposite banks into a bottomless chasm (Figure 24.4). If we ignore air friction, then we can say that\nwhile they freely fall, they both accelerate downward at the same rate and feel no external force acting on\nthem. They can throw a ball back and forth, always aiming it straight at each other, as if there were no gravity.\nThe ball falls at the same rate that they do, so it always remains in a line between them.\n1 Strictly speaking, this is true only if the laboratory is infinitesimally small. Different locations in a real laboratory that is falling\nfreely due to gravity cannot all be at identical distances from the object(s) responsible for producing the gravitational force. In this\ncase, objects in different locations will experience slightly different accelerations. But this point does not invalidate the principle of\nequivalence that Einstein derived from this line of thinking.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24.1 \u2022 Introducing General Relativity 803\nFigure24.4Free Fall.Two people play catch as they descend into a bottomless abyss. Since the people and ball all fall at the same\nspeed, it appears to them that they can play catch by throwing the ball in a straight line between them. Within their frame of\nreference, there appears to be no gravity.\nSuch a game of catch is very different on the surface of Earth. Everyone who grows up feeling gravity knows\nthat a ball, once thrown, falls to the ground. Thus, in order to play catch with someone, you must aim the ball\nupward so that it follows an arc\u2014rising and then falling as it moves forward\u2014until it is caught at the other\nend.\nNow suppose we isolate our falling people and ball inside a large box that is falling with them. No one inside\nthe box is aware of any gravitational force. If they let go of the ball, it doesn\u2019t fall to the bottom of the box or\nanywhere else but merely stays there or moves in a straight line, depending on whether it is given any motion.\nAstronauts in the International Space Station (ISS) that is orbiting Earth live in an environment just like that of\nthe people sealed in a freely falling box (Figure 24.5). The orbiting ISS is actually \u201cfalling\u201d freely around Earth.\nWhile in free fall, the astronauts live in a strange world where there seems to be no gravitational force. One\ncan give a wrench a shove, and it moves at constant speed across the orbiting laboratory. A pencil set in midair\nremains there as if no force were acting on it. 804 24 \u2022 Black Holes and Curved Spacetime\nFigure24.5Astronauts aboard the Space Shuttle.Shane Kimbrough and Sandra Magnus are shown aboard the Endeavour in 2008\nwith various fruit floating freely. Because the shuttle is in free fall as it orbits Earth, everything\u2014including astronauts\u2014stays put or\nmoves uniformly relative to the walls of the spacecraft. This free-falling state produces a lack of apparent gravity inside the\nspacecraft. (credit: NASA)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nIn the \u201cweightless\u201d environment of the International Space Station, moving takes very little effort. Watch\nastronaut Karen Nyberg(https://openstax.org/l/30ISSzerogravid)demonstrate how she can propel herself\nwith the force of a single human hair.\nAppearances are misleading, however. There is a force in this situation. Both the ISS and the astronauts\ncontinually fall around Earth, pulled by its gravity. But since all fall together\u2014shuttle, astronauts, wrench, and\npencil\u2014inside the ISS all gravitational forces appear to be absent.\nThus, the orbiting ISS provides an excellent example of the principle of equivalence\u2014how local effects of\ngravity can be completely compensated by the right acceleration. To the astronauts, falling around Earth\ncreates the same effects as being far off in space, remote from all gravitational influences.\nThe Paths of Light and Matter\nEinstein postulated that the equivalence principle is a fundamental fact of nature, and that there isno\nexperiment inside any spacecraft by which an astronaut can ever distinguish between being weightless in\nremote space and being in free fall near a planet like Earth. This would apply to experiments done with beams\nof light as well. But the minute we use light in our experiments, we are led to some very disturbing\nconclusions\u2014and it is these conclusions that lead us to general relativity and a new view of gravity.\nIt seems apparent to us, from everyday observations, that beams of light travel in straight lines. Imagine that a\nspaceship is moving through empty space far from any gravity. Send a laser beam from the back of the ship to\nthe front, and it will travel in a nice straight line and land on the front wall exactly opposite the point from\nwhich it left the rear wall. If the equivalence principle really applies universally, then this same experiment\nperformed in free fall around Earth should give us the same result.\nNow imagine that the astronauts again shine a beam of light along the length of their ship. But, as shown in\nFigure 24.6, this time the orbiting space station falls a bit between the time the light leaves the back wall and\nthe time it hits the front wall. (The amount of the fall is grossly exaggerated inFigure 24.6to illustrate the\neffect.) Therefore, if the beam of light follows a straight line but the ship\u2019s path curves downward, then the\nlight should strike the front wall at a point higher than the point from which it left.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24.2 \u2022 Spacetime and Gravity 805\nFigure24.6Curved Light Path.In a spaceship moving to the left (in this figure) in its orbit about a planet, light is beamed from the\nrear, A, toward the front, B. Meanwhile, the ship is falling out of its straight path (exaggerated here). We might therefore expect the\nlight to strike at B\u2032, above the target in the ship. Instead, the light follows a curved path and strikes at C. In order for the principle of\nequivalence to be correct, gravity must be able to curve the path of a light beam just as it curves the path of the spaceship.\nHowever, this would violate the principle of equivalence\u2014the two experiments would give different results. We\nare thus faced with giving up one of our two assumptions. Either the principle of equivalence is not correct, or\nlight does not always travel in straight lines. Instead of dropping what probably seemed at the time like a\nridiculous idea, Einstein worked out what happens if light sometimes doesnotfollow a straight path.\nLet\u2019s suppose the principle of equivalence is right. Then the light beam must arrive directly opposite the point\nfrom which it started in the ship. The light, like the ball thrown back and forth,must fall with the shipthat is in\norbit around Earth (seeFigure 24.6). This would make its path curve downward, like the path of the ball, and\nthus the light would hit the front wall exactly opposite the spot from which it came.\nThinking this over, you might well conclude that it doesn\u2019t seem like such a big problem: whycan\u2019tlight fall\nthe way balls do? But, as discussed inRadiation and Spectra, light is profoundly different from balls. Balls have\nmass, while light does not.\nHere is where Einstein\u2019s intuition and genius allowed him to make a profound leap. He gave physical meaning\nto the strange result of our thought experiment. Einstein suggested that the light curves down to meet the\nfront of the shuttle because Earth\u2019s gravity actually bends thefabric of space and time. This radical\nidea\u2014which we will explain next\u2014keeps the behavior of light the same in both empty space and free fall, but it\nchanges some of our most basic and cherished ideas about space and time. The reason we take Einstein\u2019s\nsuggestion seriously is that, as we will see, experiments now clearly show his intuitive leap was correct.\n24.2 Spacetime and Gravity\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe Einstein\u2019s view of gravity as the warping of spacetime in the presence of massive objects\nUnderstand that Newton\u2019s concept of the gravitational force between two massive objects and Einstein\u2019s\nconcept of warped spacetime are different explanations for the same observed accelerations of one massive\nobject in the presence of another massive object\nIs light actually bent from its straight-line path by the mass of Earth? How can light, which has no mass, be\naffected by gravity?Einsteinpreferred to think that it isspace and timethat are affected by the presence of a\nlarge mass; light beams, and everything else that travels through space and time, then find their paths\naffected. Light always follows the shortest path\u2014but that path may not always be straight. This idea is true for\nhuman travel on the curved surface of planet Earth, as well. Say you want to fly from Chicago to Rome. Since\nan airplane can\u2019t go through the solid body of the Earth, the shortest distance is not a straight line but the arc\nof agreat circle.\nLinkages: Mass, Space, and Time\nTo show what Einstein\u2019s insight really means, let\u2019s first consider how we locate an event in space and time. For 806 24 \u2022 Black Holes and Curved Spacetime\nexample, imagine you have to describe to worried school officials the fire that broke out in your room when\nyour roommate tried cooking shish kebabs in the fireplace. You explain that your dorm is at 6400 College\nAvenue, a street that runs in the left-right direction on a map of your town; you are on the fifth floor, which\ntells where you are in the up-down direction; and you are the sixth room back from the elevator, which tells\nwhere you are in the forward-backward direction. Then you explain that the fire broke out at 6:23 p.m. (but\nwas soon brought under control), which specifies the event in time.Anyevent in the universe, whether nearby\nor far away, can be pinpointed using the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time.\nNewton considered space and time to be completely independent, and that continued to be the accepted view\nuntil the beginning of the twentieth century. But Einstein showed that there is an intimate connection between\nspace and time, and that only by considering the two together\u2014in what we callspacetime\u2014can we build up a\ncorrect picture of the physical world. We examine spacetime a bit more closely in the next subsection.\nThe gist of Einstein\u2019s general theory is that the presence of matter curves or warps the fabric of spacetime.\nThis curving ofspacetimeis identified with gravity. When something else\u2014a beam of light, an electron, or the\nstarshipEnterprise\u2014enters such a region of distorted spacetime, its path will be different from what it would\nhave been in the absence of the matter. As American physicist John Wheeler summarized it: \u201cMatter tells\nspacetime how to curve; spacetime tells matter how to move.\u201d\nThe amount of distortion in spacetime depends on the mass of material that is involved and on how\nconcentrated and compact it is. Terrestrial objects, such as the book you are reading, have far too little mass to\nintroduce any significant distortion. Newton\u2019s view of gravity is just fine for building bridges, skyscrapers, or\namusement park rides. General relativity does, however, have some practical applications. The GPS (Global\nPositioning System) in every smartphone can tell you where you are within 5 to 10 meters only because the\neffects of general and special relativity on the GPS satellites in orbit around the Earth are taken into account.\nUnlike a book or your roommate, stars produce measurable distortions in spacetime. A white dwarf, with its\nstronger surface gravity, produces more distortion just above its surface than does a red giant with the same\nmass. So, you see, weareeventually going to talk about collapsing stars again, but not before discussing\nEinstein\u2019s ideas (and the evidence for them) in more detail.\nSpacetime Examples\nHow can we understand the distortion of spacetime by the presence of some (significant) amount of mass?\nLet\u2019s try the following analogy. You may have seen maps of New York City that squeeze the full three\ndimensions of this towering metropolis onto a flat sheet of paper and still have enough information so tourists\nwill not get lost. Let\u2019s do something similar with diagrams of spacetime.\nFigure 24.7, for example, shows the progress of a motorist driving east on a stretch of road in Kansas where\nthe countryside is absolutely flat. Since our motorist is traveling only in the east-west direction and the terrain\nis flat, we can ignore the other two dimensions of space. The amount of time elapsed since he left home is\nshown on they-axis, and the distance traveled eastward is shown on thex-axis. From A to B he drove at a\nuniform speed; unfortunately, it was too fast a uniform speed and a police car spotted him. From B to C he\nstopped to receive his ticket and made no progress through space, only through time. From C to D he drove\nmore slowly because the police car was behind him.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24.2 \u2022 Spacetime and Gravity 807\nFigure24.7Spacetime Diagram.This diagram shows the progress of a motorist traveling east across the flat Kansas landscape.\nDistance traveled is plotted along the horizontal axis. The time elapsed since the motorist left the starting point is plotted along the\nvertical axis.\nNow let\u2019s try illustrating the distortions ofspacetimein two dimensions. In this case, we will (in our\nimaginations) use a rubber sheet that can stretch or warp if we put objects on it.\nLet\u2019s imagine stretching our rubber sheet taut on four posts. To complete the analogy, we need something\nthat normally travels in a straight line (as light does). Suppose we have an extremely intelligent ant\u2014a friend\nof the comic book superhero Ant-Man, perhaps\u2014that has been trained to walk in a straight line.\nWe begin with just the rubber sheet and the ant, simulating empty space with no mass in it. We put the ant on\none side of the sheet and it walks in a beautiful straight line over to the other side (Figure 24.8). We next put a\nsmall grain of sand on the rubber sheet. The sand does distort the sheet a tiny bit, but this is not a distortion\nthat we or the ant can measure. If we send the ant so it goes close to, but not on top of, the sand grain, it has\nlittle trouble continuing to walk in a straight line.\nNow we grab something with a little more mass\u2014say, a small pebble. It bends or distorts the sheet just a bit\naround its position. If we send the ant into this region, it finds its path slightly altered by the distortion of the\nsheet. The distortion is not large, but if we follow the ant\u2019s path carefully, we notice it deviating slightly from a\nstraight line.\nThe effect gets more noticeable as we increase the mass of the object that we put on the sheet. Let\u2019s say we\nnow use a massive paperweight. Such a heavy object distorts or warps the rubber sheet very effectively,\nputting a good sag in it. From our point of view, we can see that the sheet near the paperweight is no longer\nstraight. 808 24 \u2022 Black Holes and Curved Spacetime\nFigure24.8Three-Dimensional Analogy for Spacetime.On a flat rubber sheet, a trained ant has no trouble walking in a straight\nline. When a massive object creates a big depression in the sheet, the ant, which must walk where the sheet takes it, finds its path\nchanged (warped) dramatically.\nNow let\u2019s again send the ant on a journey that takes it close to, but not on top of, the paperweight. Far away\nfrom the paperweight, the ant has no trouble doing its walk, which looks straight to us. As it nears the\npaperweight, however, the ant is forced down into the sag. It must then climb up the other side before it can\nreturn to walking on an undistorted part of the sheet. All this while, the ant is following the shortest path it\ncan, but through no fault of its own (after all, ants can\u2019t fly, so it has to stay on the sheet) this path is curved by\nthe distortion of the sheet itself.\nIn the same way, according to Einstein\u2019s theory, light always follows the shortest path through spacetime. But\nthe mass associated with large concentrations of matter distorts spacetime, and the shortest, most direct\npaths are no longer straight lines, but curves.\nHow large does a mass have to be before we can measure a change in the path followed by light? In 1916,\nwhen Einstein first proposed his theory, no distortion had been detected at the surface of Earth (so Earth\nmight have played the role of the grain of sand in our analogy). Something with a mass like our Sun\u2019s was\nnecessary to detect the effect Einstein was describing (we will discuss how this effect was measured using the\nSun in the next section).\nThe paperweight in our analogy might be a white dwarf or a neutron star. The distortion of spacetime is\ngreater near the surfaces of these compact, massive objects than near the surface of the Sun. And when, to\nreturn to the situation described at the beginning of the chapter, a star core with more than three times the\nmass of the Sun collapses forever, the distortions of spacetime very close to it can become truly mind-\nboggling.\n24.3 Tests of General Relativity\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe unusual motion ofMercuryaround the Sun and explain how general relativity explains the\nobserved behavior\nProvide examples of evidence for light rays being bent by massive objects, as predicted by general\nrelativity\u2019s theory about the warping of spacetime\nWhatEinsteinproposed was nothing less than a major revolution in our understanding of space and time. It\nwas a new theory of gravity, in which mass determines the curvature of spacetime and that curvature, in turn,\ncontrols how objects move. Like all new ideas in science, no matter who advances them, Einstein\u2019s theory had\nto be tested by comparing its predictions against the experimental evidence. This was quite a challenge\nbecause the effects of the new theory were apparent only when the mass was quite large. (For smaller masses,\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24.3 \u2022 Tests of General Relativity 809\nit required measuring techniques that would not become available until decades later.)\nWhen the distorting mass is small, the predictions of general relativity must agree with those resulting from\nNewton\u2019s law of universal gravitation, which, after all, has served us admirably in our technology and in\nguiding space probes to the other planets. In familiar territory, therefore, the differences between the\npredictions of the two models are subtle and difficult to detect. Nevertheless, Einstein was able to demonstrate\none proof of his theory that could be found in existing data and to suggest another one that would be tested\njust a few years later.\nThe Motion of Mercury\nOf the planets in our solar system,Mercuryorbits closest to the Sun and is thus most affected by the distortion\nof spacetime produced by the Sun\u2019s mass. Einstein wondered if the distortion might produce a noticeable\ndifference in the motion of Mercury that was not predicted by Newton\u2019s law. It turned out that the difference\nwas subtle, but it was definitely there. Most importantly, it had already been measured.\nMercury has a highly elliptical orbit, so that it is only about two-thirds as far from the Sun at perihelion as it is\nat aphelion. (These terms were defined in the chapter onOrbits and Gravity.) The gravitational effects\n(perturbations) of the other planets on Mercury produce a calculable advance of Mercury\u2019s perihelion. What\nthis means is that each successive perihelion occurs in a slightly different direction as seen from the Sun\n(Figure 24.9).\nFigure24.9Mercury\u2019s Wobble.The major axis of the orbit of a planet, such as Mercury, rotates in space slightly because of various\nperturbations. In Mercury\u2019s case, the amount of rotation (or orbital precession) is a bit larger than can be accounted for by the\ngravitational forces exerted by other planets; this difference is precisely explained by the general theory of relativity. Mercury, being\nthe planet closest to the Sun, has its orbit most affected by the warping of spacetime near the Sun. The change from orbit to orbit\nhas been significantly exaggerated on this diagram.\nAccording to Newtonian gravitation, the gravitational forces exerted by the planets will cause Mercury\u2019s\nperihelion to advance by about 531 seconds of arc (arcsec) per century. In the nineteenth century, however, it\nwas observed that the actual advance is 574 arcsec per century. The discrepancy was first pointed out in 1859\nby Urbain Le Verrier, the codiscoverer of Neptune. Just as discrepancies in the motion of Uranus allowed\nastronomers to discover the presence of Neptune, so it was thought that the discrepancy in the motion of\nMercury could mean the presence of an undiscovered inner planet. Astronomers searched for this planet near\nthe Sun, even giving it a name: Vulcan, after the Roman god of fire. (The name would later be used for the\nhome planet of a famous character on a popular television show about future space travel.)\nBut no planet has ever been found nearer to the Sun than Mercury, and the discrepancy was still bothering\nastronomers when Einstein was doing his calculations. General relativity, however, predicts that due to the\ncurvature of spacetime around the Sun, the perihelion of Mercury should advance slightly more than is\npredicted by Newtonian gravity. The result is to make the major axis of Mercury\u2019s orbit rotate slowly in space\nbecause of the Sun\u2019s gravity alone. The prediction of general relativity is that the direction of perihelion should 810 24 \u2022 Black Holes and Curved Spacetime\nchange by an additional 43 arcsec per century. This is remarkably close to the observed discrepancy, and it\ngave Einstein a lot of confidence as he advanced his theory. The relativistic advance of perihelion was later also\nobserved in the orbits of several asteroids that come close to the Sun.\nDeflection of Starlight\nEinstein\u2019s second test was something that had not been observed before and would thus provide an excellent\nconfirmation of his theory. Since spacetime is more curved in regions where the gravitational field is strong,\nwe would expect light passing very near the Sun to appear to follow a curved path (Figure 24.10), just like that\nof the ant in our analogy. Einstein calculated from general relativity theory that starlight just grazing the Sun\u2019s\nsurface should be deflected by an angle of 1.75 arcsec. Could such a deflection be observed?\nFigure24.10Curvature of Light Paths near the Sun.Starlight passing near the Sun is deflected slightly by the \u201cwarping\u201d of\nspacetime. (This deflection of starlight is one small example of a phenomenon called gravitational lensing, which we\u2019ll discuss in\nmore detail inThe Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies.) Before passing by the Sun, the light from the star was traveling parallel to\nthe bottom edge of the figure. When it passed near the Sun, the path was altered slightly. When we see the light, we assume the\nlight beam has been traveling in a straight path throughout its journey, and so we measure the position of the star to be slightly\ndifferent from its true position. If we were to observe the star at another time, when the Sun is not in the way, we would measure its\ntrue position.\nWe encounter a small \u201ctechnical problem\u201d when we try to photograph starlight coming very close to the Sun:\nthe Sun is an outrageously bright source of starlight itself. But during a total solar eclipse, much of the Sun\u2019s\nlight is blocked out, allowing the stars near the Sun to be photographed. In a paper published during World\nWar I, Einstein (writing in a German journal) suggested that photographic observations during an eclipse\ncould reveal the deflection of light passing near the Sun.\nThe technique involves taking a photograph of the stars six months prior to the eclipse and measuring the\nposition of all the stars accurately. Then the same stars are photographed during the eclipse. This is when the\nstarlight has to travel to us by skirting the Sun and moving through measurably warped spacetime. As seen\nfrom Earth, the stars closest to the Sun will seem to be \u201cout of place\u201d\u2014slightly away from their regular\npositions as measured when the Sun is not nearby.\nA single copy of that paper, passed through neutral Holland, reached the British astronomer Arthur S.\nEddington, who noted that the next suitable eclipse was on May 29, 1919. The British organized two\nexpeditions to observe it: one on the island of Pr\u00edncipe, off the coast of West Africa, and the other in Sobral, in\nnorthern Brazil. Despite some problems with the weather, both expeditions obtained successful photographs.\nThe stars seen near the Sun were indeed displaced, and to the accuracy of the measurements, which was\nabout 20%, the shifts were consistent with the predictions of general relativity. More modern experiments with\nradio waves traveling close to the Sun have confirmed that the actual displacements are within 1% of what\ngeneral relativity predicts.\nThe confirmation of the theory by the eclipse expeditions in 1919 was a triumph that made Einstein a world\ncelebrity.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24.4 \u2022 Time in General Relativity 811\n24.4 Time in General Relativity\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe how Einsteiniangravityslows clocks and can decrease a light wave\u2019s frequency of oscillation\nRecognize that the gravitational decrease in a light wave\u2019s frequency is compensated by an increase in the\nlight wave\u2019s wavelength\u2014the so-called gravitational redshift\u2014so that the light continues to travel at constant\nspeed\nGeneral relativity theory makes various predictions about the behavior of space and time. One of these\npredictions, put in everyday terms, is thatthe stronger the gravity, the slower the pace of time. Such a\nstatement goes very much counter to our intuitive sense of time as a flow that we all share. Time has always\nseemed the most democratic of concepts: all of us, regardless of wealth or status, appear to move together\nfrom the cradle to the grave in the great current of time.\nBut Einstein argued that it only seems this way to us because all humans so far have lived and died in the\ngravitational environment of Earth. We have had no chance to test the idea that the pace of time might\ndepend on the strength of gravity, because we have not experienced radically different gravities. Moreover,\nthe differences in the flow of time are extremely small until truly large masses are involved. Nevertheless,\nEinstein\u2019s prediction has now been tested, both on Earth and in space.\nThe Tests of Time\nAn ingenious experiment in 1959 used the most accurate atomic clock known to compare time measurements\non the ground floor and the top floor of the physics building at Harvard University. For a clock, the\nexperimenters used the frequency (the number of cycles per second) of gamma rays emitted by radioactive\ncobalt. Einstein\u2019s theory predicts that such a cobalt clock on the ground floor, being a bit closer to Earth\u2019s\ncenter of gravity, should run very slightly slower than the same clock on the top floor. This is precisely what the\nexperiments observed. Later, atomic clocks were taken up in high-flying aircraft and even on one of the\nGemini space flights. In each case, the clocks farther from Earth ran a bit faster. While in 1959 it didn\u2019t matter\nmuch if the clock at the top of the building ran faster than the clock in the basement, today that effect is highly\nrelevant. Every smartphone or device that synchronizes with a GPS must correct for this (as we will see in the\nnext section) since the clocks on satellites will run faster than clocks on Earth.\nThe effect is more pronounced if the gravity involved is the Sun\u2019s and not Earth\u2019s. If stronger gravity slows the\npace of time, then it will take longer for a light or radio wave that passes very near the edge of the Sun to\nreach Earth than we would expect on the basis of Newton\u2019s law of gravity. (It takes longer because spacetime\nis curved in the vicinity of the Sun.) The smaller the distance between the ray of light and the edge of the Sun\nat closest approach, the longer will be the delay in the arrival time.\nIn November 1976, when the two Viking spacecraft were operating on the surface of Mars, the planet went\nbehind the Sun as seen from Earth (Figure 24.11). Scientists had preprogrammed Viking to send a radio wave\ntoward Earth that would go extremely close to the outer regions of the Sun. According to general relativity,\nthere would be a delay because the radio wave would be passing through a region where time ran more\nslowly. The experiment was able to confirm Einstein\u2019s theory to within 0.1%. 812 24 \u2022 Black Holes and Curved Spacetime\nFigure24.11Time Delays for Radio Waves near the Sun.Radio signals from the Viking lander on Mars were delayed when they\npassed near the Sun, where spacetime is curved relatively strongly. In this picture, spacetime is pictured as a two-dimensional\nrubber sheet.\nGravitational Redshift\nWhat does it mean to say that time runs more slowly? When light emerges from a region of strong gravity\nwhere time slows down, the light experiences a change in its frequency and wavelength. To understand what\nhappens, let\u2019s recall that a wave of light is a repeating phenomenon\u2014crest follows crest with great regularity.\nIn this sense, each light wave is a little clock, keeping time with its wave cycle. If stronger gravity slows down\nthe pace of time (relative to an outside observer), then the rate at which crest follows crest must be\ncorrespondingly slower\u2014that is, the waves become lessfrequent.\nTo maintain constant light speed (the key postulate in Einstein\u2019s theories of special and general relativity), the\nlower frequency must be compensated by a longer wavelength. This kind of increase in wavelength (when\ncaused by the motion of the source) is what we called aredshiftinRadiation and Spectra. Here, because it is\ngravity and not motion that produces the longer wavelengths, we call the effect agravitational redshift.\nThe advent of space-age technology made it possible to measure gravitational redshift with very high\naccuracy. In the mid-1970s, a hydrogenmaser, a device akin to a laser that produces a microwave radio signal\nat a particular wavelength, was carried by a rocket to an altitude of 10,000 kilometers. Instruments on the\nground were used to compare the frequency of the signal emitted by the rocket-borne maser with that from a\nsimilar maser on Earth. The experiment showed that the stronger gravitational field at Earth\u2019s surface really\ndid slow the flow of time relative to that measured by the maser in the rocket. The observed effect matched\nthe predictions of general relativity to within a few parts in 100,000.\nThese are only a few examples of tests that have confirmed the predictions of general relativity. Today, general\nrelativity is accepted as our best description of gravity and is used by astronomers and physicists to\nunderstand the behavior of the centers of galaxies, the beginning of the universe, and the subject with which\nwe began this chapter\u2014the death of truly massive stars.\nRelativity: A Practical Application\nBy now you may be asking: why should I be bothered with relativity? Can\u2019t I live my life perfectly well without\nit? The answer is you can\u2019t. Every time a pilot lands an airplane or you use a GPS to determine where you are\non a drive or hike in the back country, you (or at least your GPS-enabled device) must take the effects of both\ngeneral and special relativity into account.\nGPS relies on an array of 24 satellites orbiting the Earth, and at least 4 of them are visible from any spot on\nEarth. Each satellite carries a precise atomic clock. Your GPS receiver detects the signals from those satellites\nthat are overhead and calculates your position based on the time that it has taken those signals to reach you.\nSuppose you want to know where you are within 50 feet (GPS devices can actually do much better than this).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24.5 \u2022 Black Holes 813\nSince it takes only 50 billionths of a second for light to travel 50 feet, the clocks on the satellites must be\nsynchronized to at least this accuracy\u2014and relativistic effects must therefore be taken into account.\nThe clocks on the satellites are orbiting Earth at a speed of 14,000 kilometers per hour and are moving much\nfaster than clocks on the surface of Earth. According to Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity, the clocks on the\nsatellites are ticking more slowly than Earth-based clocks by about 7 millionths of a second per day. (We have\nnot discussed thespecialtheory of relativity, which deals with changes when objects move very fast, so you\u2019ll\nhave to take our word for this part.)\nThe orbits of the satellites are 20,000 kilometers above Earth, where gravity is about four times weaker than at\nEarth\u2019s surface. General relativity says that the orbiting clocks should tick about 45 millionths of a second\nfaster than they would on Earth. The net effect is that the time on a satellite clock advances by about 38\nmicroseconds per day. If these relativistic effects were not taken into account, navigational errors would start\nto add up and positions would be off by about 7 miles in only a single day.\n24.5 Black Holes\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain the event horizon surrounding ablack hole\nDiscuss why the popular notion of black holes as great sucking monsters that can ingest material at great\ndistances from them is erroneous\nUse the concept of warped spacetime near a black hole to track what happens to any object that might fall\ninto a black hole\nRecognize why the concept of a singularity\u2014with its infinite density and zero volume\u2014presents major\nchallenges to our understanding of matter\nLet\u2019s now apply what we have learned about gravity and spacetime curvature to the issue we started with: the\ncollapsing core in a very massive star. We saw that if the core\u2019s mass is greater than about 3M , theory says\nSun\nthat nothing can stop the core from collapsing forever. We will examine this situation from two perspectives:\nfirst from a pre-Einstein point of view, and then with the aid of general relativity.\nClassical Collapse\nLet\u2019s begin with a thought experiment. We want to know what speeds are required to escape from the\ngravitational pull of different objects. A rocket must be launched from the surface of Earth at a very high speed\nif it is to escape the pull of Earth\u2019s gravity. In fact, any object\u2014rocket, ball, astronomy book\u2014that is thrown\ninto the air with a velocity less than 11 kilometers per second will soon fall back to Earth\u2019s surface. Only those\nobjects launched with a speed greater than thisescape velocitycan get away from Earth.\nTheescape velocityfrom the surface of the Sun is higher yet\u2014618 kilometers per second. Now imagine that\nwe begin to compress the Sun, forcing it to shrink in diameter. Recall that the pull of gravity depends on both\nthe mass that is pulling you and your distance from the center of gravity of that mass. If the Sun is\ncompressed, itsmasswill remain the same, but thedistancebetween a point on the Sun\u2019s surface and the\ncenter will get smaller and smaller. Thus, as we compress the star, the pull of gravity for an object on the\nshrinking surface will get stronger and stronger (Figure 24.12). 814 24 \u2022 Black Holes and Curved Spacetime\nFigure24.12Formation of a Black Hole.At left, an imaginary astronaut floats near the surface of a massive star-core about to\ncollapse. As the same mass falls into a smaller sphere, the gravity at its surface goes up, making it harder for anything to escape\nfrom the stellar surface. Eventually the mass collapses into so small a sphere that the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light and\nnothing can get away. Note that the size of the astronaut has been exaggerated. In the last picture, the astronaut is just outside the\nsphere we will call the event horizon and is stretched and squeezed by the strong gravity.\nWhen the shrinking Sun reaches the diameter of a neutron star (about 20 kilometers), the velocity required to\nescape its gravitational pull will be about half the speed of light. Suppose we continue to compress the Sun to\na smaller and smaller diameter. (We saw this can\u2019t happen to a star like our Sun in the real world because of\nelectron degeneracy, i.e., the mutual repulsion between tightly packed electrons; this is just a quick \u201cthought\nexperiment\u201d to get our bearings).\nUltimately, as the Sun shrinks, the escape velocity near the surface would exceed the speed of light. If the\nspeed you need to get away is faster than the fastest possible speed in the universe, then nothing, not even\nlight, is able to escape. An object with such large escape velocity emits no light, and anything that falls into it\ncan never return.\nIn modern terminology, we call an object from which light cannot escape ablack hole, a name popularized by\nthe America scientist JohnWheelerstarting in the late 1960s (Figure 24.13). The idea that such objects might\nexist is, however, not a new one. Cambridge professor and amateur astronomer JohnMichellwrote a paper in\n1783 about the possibility that stars with escape velocities exceeding that of light might exist. And in 1796, the\nFrench mathematician Pierre-Simon, marquis de Laplace, made similar calculations using Newton\u2019s theory of\ngravity; he called the resulting objects \u201cdark bodies.\u201d\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24.5 \u2022 Black Holes 815\nFigure24.13John Wheeler (1911\u20132008).This brilliant physicist did much pioneering work in general relativity theory and\npopularized the termblack holestarting in the late 1960s. (credit: modification of work by Roy Bishop)\nWhile these early calculations provided strong hints that something strange should be expected if very\nmassive objects collapse under their own gravity, we really need general relativity theory to give an adequate\ndescription of what happens in such a situation.\nCollapse with Relativity\nGeneral relativity tells us that gravity is really a curvature of spacetime. As gravity increases (as in the\ncollapsing Sun of our thought experiment), the curvature gets larger and larger. Eventually, if the Sun could\nshrink down to a diameter of about 6 kilometers, only light beams sent out perpendicular to the surface would\nescape. All others would fall back onto the star (Figure 24.14). If the Sun could then shrink just a little more,\neven that one remaining light beam would no longer be able to escape.\nFigure24.14Light Paths near a Massive Object.Suppose a person could stand on the surface of a normal star with a flashlight.\nThe light leaving the flashlight travels in a straight line no matter where the flashlight is pointed. Now consider what happens if the\nstar collapses so that it is just a little larger than a black hole. All the light paths, except the one straight up, curve back to the surface.\nWhen the star shrinks inside the event horizon and becomes a black hole, even a beam directed straight up returns.\nKeep in mind that gravity is not pulling on the light. The concentration of matter has curved spacetime, and\nlight (like the trained ant of our earlier example) is \u201cdoing its best\u201d to go in a straight line, yet is now\nconfronted with a world in which straight lines that used to go outward have become curved paths that lead\nback in. The collapsing star is ablack holein this view, because the very concept of \u201cout\u201d has no geometrical\nmeaning. The star has become trapped in its own little pocket of spacetime, from which there is no escape.\nThe star\u2019s geometry cuts off communication with the rest of the universe at precisely the moment when, in our 816 24 \u2022 Black Holes and Curved Spacetime\nearlier picture, the escape velocity becomes equal to the speed of light. The size of the star at this moment\ndefines a surface that we call theevent horizon. It\u2019s a wonderfully descriptive name: just as objects that sink\nbelow our horizon cannot be seen on Earth, so anything happening inside the event horizon can no longer\ninteract with the rest of the universe.\nImagine a future spacecraft foolish enough to land on the surface of a massive star just as it begins to collapse\nin the way we have been describing. Perhaps the captain is asleep at the gravity meter, and before the crew\ncan say \u201cAlbert Einstein,\u201d they have collapsed with the star inside the event horizon. Frantically, they send an\nescape pod straight outward. But paths outward twist around to become paths inward, and the pod turns\naround and falls toward the center of the black hole. They send a radio message to their loved ones, bidding\ngood-bye. But radio waves, like light, must travel through spacetime, and curved spacetime allows nothing to\nget out. Their final message remains unheard. Events inside the event horizon can never again affect events\noutside it.\nThe characteristics of an event horizon were first worked out by astronomer and mathematician Karl\nSchwarzschild(Figure 24.15). A member of the German army in World War I, he died in 1916 of an illness he\ncontracted while doing artillery shell calculations on the Russian front. His paper on the theory of event\nhorizons was among the last things he finished as he was dying; it was the first exact solution to Einstein\u2019s\nequations of general relativity. The radius of the event horizon is called theSchwarzschild radiusin his\nmemory.\nFigure24.15Karl Schwarzschild (1873\u20131916).This German scientist was the first to demonstrate mathematically that a black hole is\npossible and to determine the size of a nonrotating black hole\u2019s event horizon.\nTheevent horizonis the boundary of theblack hole; calculations show that it does not get smaller once the\nwhole star has collapsed inside it. It is the region that separates the things trapped inside it from the rest of\nthe universe. Anything coming from the outside is also trapped once it comes inside the event horizon. The\nhorizon\u2019s size turns out to depend only on the mass inside it. If the Sun, with its mass of 1M , were to\nSun\nbecome a black hole (fortunately, it can\u2019t\u2014this is just a thought experiment), the Schwarzschild radius would\nbe about 3 kilometers; thus, the entire black hole would be about one-third the size of a neutron star of that\nsame mass. Feed the black hole some mass, and the horizon will grow\u2014but not very much. Doubling the mass\nwill make the black hole 6 kilometers in radius, still very tiny on the cosmic scale.\nThe event horizons of more massive black holes have larger radii. For example, if a globular cluster of 100,000\nstars (solar masses) could collapse to a black hole, it would be 300,000 kilometers in radius, a little less than\nhalf the radius of the Sun. If the entire Galaxy could collapse to a black hole, it would be only about 1012\nkilometers in radius\u2014about a tenth of a light year. Smaller masses have correspondingly smaller horizons: for\nEarth to become a black hole, it would have to be compressed to a radius of only 1 centimeter\u2014less than the\nsize of a grape. A typical asteroid, if crushed to a small enough size to be a black hole, would have the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24.5 \u2022 Black Holes 817\ndimensions of an atomic nucleus.\nEXAMPLE 24.1\nThe Milky Way\u2019s Black Hole\nThe size of the event horizon of a black hole depends on the mass of the black hole. The greater the mass,\nthe larger the radius of the event horizon. General relativity calculations show that the formula for the\nSchwarzschild radius (R) of the event horizon is\nS\nwherecis the speed of light,Gis the gravitational constant, andMis the mass of the black hole. Note that\nin this formula, 2,G, andcare all constant; only the mass changes from black hole to black hole.\nAs we will see in the chapter onThe Milky Way Galaxy, astronomers have traced the paths of several stars\nnear the center of our Galaxy and found that they seem to be orbiting an unseen object\u2014dubbed Sgr A*\n(pronounced \u201cSagittarius A-star\u201d)\u2014with a mass of about 4 million solar masses. What is the size of its\nSchwarzschild radius?\nSolution\nWe can substitute data forG,M, andc(fromAppendix E) directly into the equation:\nThis distance is about one-fifth of the radius of Mercury\u2019s orbit around the Sun, yet the object contains 4\nmillion solar masses and cannot be seen with our largest telescopes. You can see why astronomers are\nconvinced this object is a black hole.\nCheck Your Learning\nWhat would be the size of a black hole that contained only as much mass as a typical pickup truck (about\n3000 kg)? (Note that something with so little mass could never actually form a black hole, but it\u2019s\ninteresting to think about the result.)\nAnswer:\nSubstituting the data into our equation gives\nFor comparison, the size of a proton is usually considered to be about 8 \u00d7 10\u221216m, which would be about\nten million times larger.\nA Black Hole Myth\nMuch of the modern folklore about black holes is misleading. One idea you may have heard is that black holes\ngo about sucking things up with their gravity. Actually, it is only very close to ablack holethat the strange\neffects we have been discussing come into play. The gravitational attraction far away from a black hole is the\nsame as that of the star that collapsed to form it.\nRemember that the gravity of any star some distance away acts as if all its mass were concentrated at a point\nin the center, which we call the center of gravity. For real stars, we merelyimaginethat all mass is\nconcentrated there; for black holes, all the massreally isconcentrated at a point in the center. 818 24 \u2022 Black Holes and Curved Spacetime\nSo, if you are a star or distant planet orbiting around a star that becomes a black hole, your orbit may not be\nsignificantly affected by the collapse of the star (although it may be affected by any mass loss that precedes\nthe collapse). If, on the other hand, you venture close to the event horizon, it would be very hard for you to\nresist the \u201cpull\u201d of the warped spacetime near the black hole. You have to get really close to the black hole to\nexperience any significant effect.\nIf another star or a spaceship were to pass one or two solar radii from a black hole, Newton\u2019s laws would be\nadequate to describe what would happen to it. Only very near the event horizon of a black hole is the\ngravitation so strong that Newton\u2019s laws break down. The black hole remnant of a massive star coming into\nour neighborhood would be far, far safer to us than its earlier incarnation as a brilliant, hot star.\nMAKING CONNECTIONS\nGravity and Time Machines\nTime machines are one of the favorite devices of science fiction. Such a device would allow you to move\nthrough time at a different pace or in a different direction from everyone else. General relativity suggests\nthat it is possible, in theory, to construct a time machine using gravity that could take you into the future.\nLet\u2019s imagine a place wheregravityis terribly strong, such as near a black hole. General relativity predicts\nthat the stronger the gravity, the slower the pace of time (as seen by a distant observer). So, imagine a\nfuture astronaut, with a fast and strongly built spaceship, who volunteers to go on a mission to such a high-\ngravity environment. The astronaut leaves in the year 2222, just after graduating from college at age 22.\nShe takes, let\u2019s say, exactly 10 years to get to the black hole. Once there, she orbits some distance from it,\ntaking care not to get pulled in.\nShe is now in a high-gravity realm where time passes much more slowly than it does on Earth. This isn\u2019t just\nan effect on the mechanism of her clocks\u2014time itselfis running slowly. That means that every way she has\nof measuring time will give the same slowed-down reading when compared to time passing on Earth. Her\nheart will beat more slowly, her hair will grow more slowly, her antique wristwatch will tick more slowly, and\nso on. She is not aware of this slowing down because all her readings of time, whether made by her own\nbodily functions or with mechanical equipment, are measuring the same\u2014slower\u2014time. Meanwhile, back\non Earth, time passes as it always does.\nOur astronaut now emerges from the region of the black hole, her mission of exploration finished, and\nreturns to Earth. Before leaving, she carefully notes that (according to her timepieces) she spent about 2\nweeks around the black hole. She then takes exactly 10 years to return to Earth. Her calculations tell her\nthat since she was 22 when she left the Earth, she will be 42 plus 2 weeks when she returns. So, the year on\nEarth, she figures, should be 2242, and her classmates should now be approaching their midlife crises.\nBut our astronaut should have paid more attention in her astronomy class! Because time slowed down near\nthe black hole, much less time passed for her than for the people on Earth. While her clocks measured 2\nweeks spent near the black hole, more than 2000 weeks (depending on how close she got) could well have\npassed on Earth. That\u2019s equal to 40 years, meaning her classmates will be senior citizens in their 80s when\nshe (a mere 42-year-old) returns. On Earth it will be not 2242, but 2282\u2014and she will say that she has\narrivedin the future.\nIs this scenario real? Well, it has a few practical challenges: we don\u2019t think any black holes are close enough\nfor us to reach in 10 years, and we don\u2019t think any spaceship or human can survive near a black hole. But\nthe key point about the slowing down of time is a natural consequence of Einstein\u2019s general theory of\nrelativity, and we saw that its predictions have been confirmed by experiment after experiment.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24.5 \u2022 Black Holes 819\nSuch developments in the understanding of science also become inspiration for science fiction writers.\nRecently, the filmInterstellarfeatured the protagonist traveling close to a massive black hole; the resulting\ndelay in his aging relative to his earthbound family is a key part of the plot.\nScience fiction novels, such asGatewayby Frederik Pohl andA World out of Timeby Larry Niven, also make\nuse of the slowing down of time near black holes as major turning points in the story. For a list of science\nfiction stories based on good astronomy, you can go tohttp://bit.ly/astroscifi(http://bit.ly/astroscifi).\nA Trip into a Black Hole\nThe fact that scientists cannot see inside black holes has not kept them from trying to calculate what they are\nlike. One of the first things these calculations showed was that the formation of ablack holeobliterates nearly\nall information about the star that collapsed to form it. Physicists like to say \u201cblack holes have no hair,\u201d\nmeaning that nothing sticks out of a black hole to give us clues about what kind of star produced it or what\nmaterial has fallen inside. The only information a black hole can reveal about itself is its mass, its spin\n(rotation), and whether it has any electrical charge.\nWhat happens to the collapsing star-core that made the black hole? Our best calculations predict that the\nmaterial will continue to collapse under its own weight, forming an infinitelysquozenpoint\u2014a place of zero\nvolume and infinite density\u2014to which we give the namesingularity. At the singularity, spacetime ceases to\nexist. The laws of physics as we know them break down. We do not yet have the physical understanding or the\nmathematical tools to describe the singularity itself, or even if singularities actually occur. From the outside,\nhowever, the entire structure of a basic black hole (one that is not rotating) can be described as a singularity\nsurrounded by an event horizon. Compared to humans, black holes are really very simple objects.\nScientists have also calculated what would happen if an astronaut were to fall into a black hole. Let\u2019s take up\nan observing position a long, safe distance away from the event horizon and watch this astronaut fall toward\nit. At first he falls away from us, moving ever faster, just as though he were approaching any massive star.\nHowever, as he nears the event horizon of the black hole, things change. The strong gravitational field around\nthe black hole will make his clocks run more slowly, when seen from our outside perspective.\nIf, as he approaches the event horizon, he sends out a signal once per second according to his clock, we will\nsee the spacing between his signals grow longer and longer until it becomes infinitely long when he reaches\nthe event horizon. (Recalling our discussion of gravitational redshift, we could say that if the infalling astronaut\nuses a blue light to send his signals every second, we will see the light get redder and redder until its\nwavelength is nearly infinite.) As the spacing between clock ticks approaches infinity, it will appear to us that\nthe astronaut is slowly coming to a stop, frozen in time at the event horizon.\nIn the same way, all matter falling into a black hole will also appear to an outside observer to stop at the event\nhorizon, frozen in place and taking an infinite time to fall through it. But don\u2019t think that matter falling into a\nblack hole will therefore be easily visible at the event horizon. The tremendous redshift will make it very\ndifficult to observe any radiation from the \u201cfrozen\u201d victims of the black hole.\nThis, however, is only how we, located far away from the black hole, see things. To the astronaut, his time goes\nat its normal rate and he falls right on through the event horizon into the black hole. (Remember, this horizon\nis not a physical barrier, but only a region in space where the curvature of spacetime makes escape\nimpossible.)\nYou may have trouble with the idea that you (watching from far away) and the astronaut (falling in) have such\ndifferent ideas about what has happened. This is the reason Einstein\u2019s ideas about space and time are called\ntheories ofrelativity. What each observer measures about the world depends on (is relative to) his or her\nframe of reference. The observer in strong gravity measures time and space differently from the one sitting in\nweaker gravity. When Einstein proposed these ideas, many scientists also had difficulty with the idea that two 820 24 \u2022 Black Holes and Curved Spacetime\nsuch different views of the same event could be correct, each in its own \u201cworld,\u201d and they tried to find a\nmistake in the calculations. There were no mistakes: we and the astronaut really would see him fall into a black\nhole very differently.\nFor the astronaut, there is no turning back. Once inside the event horizon, the astronaut, along with any\nsignals from his radio transmitter, will remain hidden forever from the universe outside. He will, however, not\nhave a long time (from his perspective) to feel sorry for himself as he approaches the black hole. Suppose he is\nfalling feet first. The force of gravity that the singularity exerts on his feet is greater than on his head, so he will\nbe stretched slightly. Because the singularity is a point, the left side of his body will be pulled slightly toward\nthe right, and the right slightly toward the left, bringing each side closer to the singularity. The astronaut will\ntherefore be slightly squeezed in one direction and stretched in the other. Some scientists like to call this\nprocess of stretching and narrowingspaghettification.The point at which the astronaut becomes so stretched\nthat he perishes depends on the size of the black hole. For black holes with masses billions of times the mass\nof the Sun, such as those found at the centers of galaxies, the spaghettification becomes significant only after\nthe astronaut passes through the event horizon. For black holes with masses of a few solar masses, the\nastronaut will be stretched and ripped apart even before he reaches the event horizon.\nEarth exerts similartidal forceson an astronaut performing a spacewalk. In the case of Earth, the tidal forces\nare so small that they pose no threat to the health and safety of the astronaut. Not so in the case of a black\nhole. Sooner or later, as the astronaut approaches the black hole, the tidal forces will become so great that the\nastronaut will be ripped apart, eventually reduced to a collection of individual atoms that will continue their\ninexorable fall into the singularity.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nFrom the previous discussion, you will probably agree that jumping into a black hole is definitely a once-in-\na-lifetime experience! You can see anengaging explanation(https://openstax.org/l/30ndegtystidfor)of\ndeath by black hole by Neil deGrasse Tyson, where he explains the effect of tidal forces on the human body\nuntil it dies by spaghettification.\nAn overview of black holes is given in thisDiscovery Channel video(https://openstax.org/l/30dischatidfor)\nexcerpt.\n24.6 Evidence for Black Holes\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe what to look for when seeking and confirming the presence of a stellar black hole\nExplain how ablack holeis inherently black yet can be associated with luminous matter\nDifferentiate between stellar black holes and the black holes in the centers of galaxies\nTheory tells us what black holes are like. But do they actually exist? And how do we go about looking for\nsomething that is many light years away, only about a few dozen kilometers across (if a stellar black hole), and\ncompletely black? It turns out that the trick is not to look for the black hole itself but instead to look for what it\ndoes to a nearby companion star.\nAs we saw, when very massive stars collapse, they leave behind their gravitational influence. What if a member\nof a double-star system becomes a black hole, and its companion manages to survive the death of the massive\nstar? While the black hole disappears from our view, we may be able to deduce its presence from the things it\ndoes to its companion.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24.6 \u2022 Evidence for Black Holes 821\nRequirements for a Black Hole\nSo, here is a prescription for finding a black hole: start by looking for a star whose motion (determined from\ntheDoppler shiftof its spectral lines) shows it to be a member of a binary star system. If both stars are visible,\nneither can be a black hole, so focus your attention on just those systems where only one star of the pair is\nvisible, even with our most sensitive telescopes.\nBeing invisible is not enough, however, because a relatively faint star might be hard to see next to the glare of\na brilliant companion or if it is shrouded by dust. And even if the star really is invisible, it could be a neutron\nstar. Therefore, we must also have evidence that the unseen star has a mass too high to be a neutron star and\nthat it is a collapsed object\u2014an extremely small stellar remnant.\nWe can use Kepler\u2019s law (seeOrbits and Gravity) and our knowledge of the visible star to measure the mass of\nthe invisible member of the pair. If the mass is greater than about 3M , then we are likely seeing (or, more\nSun\nprecisely, not seeing) a black hole\u2014as long as we can make sure the object really is a collapsed star.\nIf matter falls toward a compact object of high gravity, the material is accelerated to high speed. Near the\nevent horizon of a black hole, matter is moving at velocities that approach the speed of light. As the atoms\nwhirl chaotically toward the event horizon, they rub against each other; internal friction can heat them to\ntemperatures of 100 million K or more. Such hot matter emits radiation in the form of flickering X-rays. The last\npart of our prescription, then, is to look for a source of X-rays associated with the binary system. Since X-rays\ndo not penetrate Earth\u2019s atmosphere, such sources must be found using X-ray telescopes in space.\nIn our example, the infalling gas that produces the X-ray emission comes from the black hole\u2019s companion\nstar. As we saw inThe Death of Stars, stars in close binary systems can exchange mass, especially as one of the\nmembers expands into a red giant. Suppose that one star in a double-star system has evolved to a black hole\nand that the second star begins to expand. If the two stars are not too far apart, the outer layers of the\nexpanding star may reach the point where the black hole exerts more gravitational force on them than do the\ninner layers of the red giant to which the atmosphere belongs. The outer atmosphere then passes through the\npoint of no return between the stars and falls toward the black hole.\nThe mutual revolution of the giant star and the black hole causes the material falling toward the black hole to\nspiral around it rather than flow directly into it. The infalling gas whirls around the black hole in a pancake of\nmatter called anaccretion disk. It is within the inner part of this disk that matter is revolving about the black\nhole so fast that internal friction heats it up to X-ray\u2013emitting temperatures (seeFigure 24.1).\nAnother way to form an accretion disk in a binary star system is to have a powerful stellar wind come from the\nblack hole\u2019s companion. Such winds are a characteristic of several stages in a star\u2019s life. Some of the ejected\ngas in the wind will then flow close enough to the black hole to be captured by it into the disk (Figure 24.16).\nFigure24.16Binary Black Hole.This artist\u2019s rendition shows a black hole and star (red). As matter streams from the star, it forms a\ndisk around the black hole. Some of the swirling material close to the black hole is pushed outward perpendicular to the disk in two\nnarrow jets. (credit: modification of work by ESO/L. Cal\u00e7ada) 822 24 \u2022 Black Holes and Curved Spacetime\nWe should point out that, as often happens, the measurements we have been discussing are not quite as\nsimple as they are described in introductory textbooks. In real life, Kepler\u2019s law allows us to calculate only the\ncombined mass of the two stars in the binary system. We must learn more about the visible star of the pair\nand its history to ascertain the distance to the binary pair, the true size of the visible star\u2019s orbit, and how the\norbit of the two stars is tilted toward Earth, something we can rarely measure. And neutron stars can also have\naccretion disks that produce X-rays, so astronomers must study the properties of these X-rays carefully when\ntrying to determine what kind of object is at the center of the disk. Nevertheless, a number of systems that\nclearly contain black holes have now been found.\nThe Discovery of Stellar-Mass Black Holes\nBecause X-rays are such important tracers of black holes that are having some of their stellar companions for\nlunch, the search for black holes had to await the launch of sophisticated X-ray telescopes into space. These\ninstruments must have the resolution to locate the X-ray sources accurately and thereby enable us to match\nthem to the positions of binary star systems.\nThe first black hole binary system to be discovered is calledCygnus X-1(seeFigure 24.1). The visible star in this\nbinary system is spectral type O. Measurements of the Doppler shifts of the O star\u2019s spectral lines show that it\nhas an unseen companion. The X-rays flickering from it strongly indicate that the companion is a small\ncollapsed object. The mass of the invisible collapsed companion is about 15 times that of the Sun. The\ncompanion is therefore too massive to be either a white dwarf or a neutron star.\nA number of other binary systems also meet all the conditions for containing ablack hole.Table 24.1lists the\ncharacteristics of some of the best examples.\nSome Black Hole Candidates in Binary Star Systems\n2\nName/Catalog Designation Companion Orbital Black Hole\nStar Spectral Period Mass Estimates\nType (days) (M )\nSun\nLMC X-1 O giant 3.9 10.9\nCygnus X-1 O supergiant 5.6 15\nXTE J1819.3-254 (V4641 Sgr) B giant 2.8 6\u20137\nLMC X-3 B main sequence 1.7 7\n4U1543-475 (IL Lup) A main sequence 1.1 9\nGRO J1655-40 (V1033 Sco) F subgiant 2.6 7\nGRS 1915+105 K giant 33.5 14\nGS202+1338 (V404 Cyg) K giant 6.5 12\nXTE J1550-564 K giant 1.5 11\nA0620-00 (V616 Mon) K main sequence 0.33 9\u201313\nTable24.1\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24.6 \u2022 Evidence for Black Holes 823\n2\nName/Catalog Designation Companion Orbital Black Hole\nStar Spectral Period Mass Estimates\nType (days) (M )\nSun\nH1705-250 (Nova Oph 1977) K main sequence 0.52 5\u20137\nGRS1124-683 (Nova Mus 1991) K main sequence 0.43 7\nGS2000+25 (QZ Vul) K main sequence 0.35 5\u201310\nGRS1009-45 (Nova Vel 1993) K dwarf 0.29 8\u20139\nXTE J1118+480 K dwarf 0.17 7\nXTE J1859+226 K dwarf 0.38 5.4\nGRO J0422+32 M dwarf 0.21 4\nTable24.1\nFeeding a Black Hole\nAfter an isolated star, or even one in a binary star system, becomes ablack hole, it probably won\u2019t be able to\ngrow much larger. Out in the suburban regions of the Milky Way Galaxy where we live (seeThe Milky Way\nGalaxy), stars and star systems are much too far apart for other stars to provide \u201cfood\u201d to a hungry black hole.\nAfter all, material must approach very close to the event horizon before the gravity is any different from that of\nthe star before it became the black hole.\nBut, as will see, the central regions of galaxies are quite different from their outer parts. Here, stars and raw\nmaterial can be quite crowded together, and they can interact much more frequently with each other.\nTherefore, black holes in the centers of galaxies may have a much better opportunity to find mass close\nenough to their event horizons to pull in. Black holes are not particular about what they \u201ceat\u201d: they are happy\nto consume other stars, asteroids, gas, dust, and even other black holes. (If two black holes merge, you just\nget a black hole with more mass and a larger event horizon.)\nAs a result, black holes in crowded regions can grow, eventually swallowing thousands or even millions of\ntimes the mass of the Sun. Ground-based observations have provided compelling evidence that there is a\nblack hole in the center of our own Galaxy with a mass of about 4 million times the mass of the Sun (we\u2019ll\ndiscuss this further in the chapter onThe Milky Way Galaxy). Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope\nhave shown dramatic evidence for the existence of black holes in the centers of many other galaxies. These\nblack holes can contain more than a billion solar masses. The feeding frenzy of such supermassive black holes\nmay be responsible for some of the most energetic phenomena in the universe (seeActive Galaxies, Quasars,\nand Supermassive Black Holes). And evidence from more recent X-ray observations is also starting to indicate\nthe existence of \u201cmiddle-weight\u201d black holes, whose masses are dozens to thousands of times the mass of the\nSun. The crowded inner regions of the globular clusters we described inStars from Adolescence to Old Age\nmay be just the right breeding grounds for such intermediate-mass black holes.\nOver the past decades, many observations, especially with the Hubble Space Telescope and with X-ray\n2 As you can tell, there is no standard way of naming these candidates. The chain of numbers is the location of the source in right\nascension and declination (the longitude and latitude system of the sky); some of the letters preceding the numbers refer to objects\n(e.g., LMC) and constellations (e.g., Cygnus), while other letters refer to the satellite that discovered the candidate\u2014A for Ariel, G for\nGinga, and so on. The notations in parentheses are those used by astronomers who study binary star system or novae. 824 24 \u2022 Black Holes and Curved Spacetime\nsatellites, have been made that can be explained only if black holes really do exist. Furthermore, the\nobservational tests of Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity have convinced even the most skeptical scientists\nthat his picture of warped or curved spacetime is indeed our best description of the effects of gravity near\nthese black holes.\n24.7 Gravitational Wave Astronomy\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe what a gravitational wave is, what can produce it, and how fast it propagates\nUnderstand the basic mechanisms used to detect gravitational waves\nAnother part of Einstein\u2019s ideas about gravity can be tested as a way of checking the theory that underlies\nblack holes. According to general relativity, the geometry of spacetime depends on where matter is located.\nAny rearrangement of matter\u2014say, from a sphere to a sausage shape\u2014creates a disturbance in spacetime.\nThis disturbance is called agravitational wave, and relativity predicts that it should spread outward at the\nspeed of light. The big problem with trying to study such waves is that they are tremendously weaker than\nelectromagnetic waves and correspondingly difficult to detect.\nProof from a Pulsar\nWe\u2019ve had indirect evidence for some time that gravitational waves exist. In 1974, astronomers Joseph Taylor\nand Russell Hulse discovered a pulsar (with the designation PSR1913+16) orbiting another neutron star. Pulled\nby the powerful gravity of its companion, the pulsar is moving at about one-tenth the speed of light in its orbit.\nAccording to general relativity, this system of stellar corpses should be radiating energy in the form of\ngravitational waves at a high enough rate to cause the pulsar and its companion to spiral closer together. If\nthis is correct, then the orbital period should decrease (according to Kepler\u2019s third law) by one ten-millionth of\na second per orbit. Continuing observations showed that the period is decreasing by precisely this amount.\nSuch a loss of energy in the system can be due only to the radiation of gravitational waves, thus confirming\ntheir existence. Taylor and Hulse shared the 1993 Nobel Prize in physics for this work.\nDirect Observations\nAlthough such an indirect proof convinced physicists that gravitational waves exist, it is even more satisfying to\ndetect the waves directly. What we need are phenomena that are powerful enough to produce gravitational\nwaves with amplitudes large enough that we can measure them. Theoretical calculations suggest some of the\nmost likely events that would give a burst of gravitational waves strong enough that our equipment on Earth\ncould measure it:\n\u2022 the coalescence of two neutron stars in a binary system that spiral together until they merge\n\u2022 the swallowing of a neutron star by a black hole\n\u2022 the coalescence (merger) of two black holes\n\u2022 the implosion of a really massive star to form a neutron star or a black hole\n\u2022 the first \u201cshudder\u201d when space and time came into existence and the universe began\nFor the last four decades, scientists have been developing an audacious experiment to try to detect\ngravitational waves from a source on this list. The US experiment, which was built with collaborators from the\nUK, Germany, Australia and other countries, is namedLIGO(Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave\nObservatory). LIGO currently has two observing stations, one in Louisiana and the other in the state of\nWashington. The effects of gravitational waves are so small that confirmation of their detection will require\nsimultaneous measurements by two widely separated facilities. Local events that might cause small motions\nwithin the observing stations and mimic gravitational waves\u2014such as small earthquakes, ocean tides, and\neven traffic\u2014should affect the two sites differently.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24.7 \u2022 Gravitational Wave Astronomy 825\nEach of theLIGOstations consists of two 4-kilometer-long, 1.2-meter-diameter vacuum pipes arranged in an L-\nshape. A test mass with a mirror on it is suspended by wire at each of the four ends of the pipes. Ultra-stable\nlaser light is reflected from the mirrors and travels back and forth along the vacuum pipes (Figure 24.17). If\ngravitational waves pass through the LIGO instrument, then, according to Einstein\u2019s theory, the waves will\naffect local spacetime\u2014they will alternately stretch and shrink the distance the laser light must travel between\nthe mirrors ever so slightly. When one arm of the instrument gets longer, the other will get shorter, and vice\nversa.\nFigure24.17Gravitational Wave Telescope.An aerial view of the LIGO facility at Livingston, Louisiana. Extending to the upper left\nand far right of the image are the 4-kilometer-long detectors. (credit: modification of work by Caltech/MIT/LIGO Laboratory)\nThe challenge of this experiment lies in that phrase \u201cever so slightly.\u201d In fact, to detect a gravitational wave,\nthe change in the distance to the mirror must be measured with an accuracy ofone ten-thousandth the\ndiameter of a proton. In 1972, Rainer Weiss of MIT wrote a paper suggesting how this seemingly impossible\ntask might be accomplished.\nA great deal of new technology had to be developed, and work on the laboratory, with funding from the\nNational Science Foundation, began in 1979. A full-scale prototype to demonstrate the technology was built\nand operated from 2002 to 2010, but the prototype was not expected to have the sensitivity required to\nactually detect gravitational waves from an astronomical source. Advanced LIGO, built to be more precise with\nthe improved technology developed in the prototype, went into operation in 2015\u2014and almost immediately\ndetected gravitational waves.\nWhat LIGO found wasgravitational waves produced in the final fraction of a second of the merger of two black\nholes (Figure 24.18). The black holes had masses of 20 and 36 times the mass of the Sun, and the merger took\nplace 1.3 billion years ago\u2014the gravitational waves occurred so far away that it has taken that long for them,\ntraveling at the speed of light, to reach us.\nIn the cataclysm of the merger, about three times the mass of the Sun was converted to energy (recall E =\nmc2). During the tiny fraction of a second for the merger to take place, this event produced power about 10\ntimes the power produced by all the stars in the entire visible universe\u2014but the power was all in the form of\ngravitational waves and hence was invisible to our instruments, except to LIGO. The event was recorded in\nLouisiana about 7 milliseconds before the detection in Washington\u2014just the right distance given the speed at\nwhich gravitational waves travel\u2014and indicates that the source was located somewhere in the southern\nhemisphere sky. Unfortunately, the merger of two black holes is not expected to produce any light, so this is\nthe only observation we have of the event. 826 24 \u2022 Black Holes and Curved Spacetime\nFigure24.18Signal Produced by a Gravitational Wave.(a) The top panel shows the signal measured at Hanford, Washington; the\nmiddle panel shows the signal measured at Livingston, Louisiana. The smoother thin curve in each panel shows the predicted signal,\nbased on Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity, produced by the merger of two black holes. The bottom panel shows a superposition\nof the waves detected at the two LIGO observatories. Note the remarkable agreement of the two independent observations and of\nthe observations with theory. (b) The painting shows an artist\u2019s impression of two massive black holes spiraling inward toward an\neventual merger. (credit a, b: modification of work by SXS)\nThis detection by LIGO (and another one of a different black hole merger a few months later) opened a whole\nnew window on the universe. One of the experimenters compared the beginning of gravitational wave\nastronomy to the era when silent films were replaced by movies with sound (comparing the vibration of\nspacetime during the passing of a gravitational wave to the vibrations that sound makes).\nBy the end of 2021, the LIGO-Virgo collaboration (Virgo is a gravitational wave detector operated by the\nEuropean Gravitational Observatory in Italy) published a catalog that now included some 90 events. Most were\nmergers of two black holes, and most involved black holes with a range of masses detected only by\ngravitational waves (seeFigure 24.19). In the most extreme merger, black holes with masses of 86 and 65\ntimes the mass of the Sun merged to form a black hole with a mass of about 142 times the mass the Sun, and\nreleased energy equivalent to 9 times the mass of our Sun (remember E= mc2)\u2014an enormous amount.\nAstronomers are not yet sure how black holes in this unexpected mass range form. Bear in mind that the kind\nof black holes in binary star systems that we discussed inEvidence for Black Holes(and listed inTable 24.1)\nhave masses ranging from 4 to 15 times the mass of the Sun.\nTo be sure, a few mergers did involve black holes with stellar masses comparable to those of black holes in X-\nray binary systems. In one case, for example, the merging black holes had masses of 14 and 8 times the mass\nof the Sun.\nWhile astronomers can learn about the masses of objects involved in gravitational wave events, the challenge\nis to locate the event in the sky precisely. A single gravitational wave detector cannot determine accurately the\ndirection to a gravitational wave source. Four comparable detectors operating simultaneously are required to\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24.7 \u2022 Gravitational Wave Astronomy 827\nlocalize a source of gravitational wavesin every locationin the sky. The first observing run with four detectors,\nincluding the two LIGO detectors, Virgo, and KAGRA in Japan, is scheduled to begin in the summer of 2022.\nLIGO India will be a fifth, thereby enhancing the probability that at least four detectors will be operational\nsimultaneously. Experience has shown that the LIGO and Virgo detectors are down about 25 percent of the\ntime because these complex systems are difficult to run.\nA three-observatory network does provide a sharp location for events that occur in about half of all possible\nlocations on the sky.\nIn late 2017, data from the LIGO and Virgo detectors provided an accurate position for what analysis showed\nwas the spiraling together of two neutron stars with masses of 1.1 to 1.6 times the mass of the Sun (seeThe\nDeath of Stars).\nWith an accurate location known, follow up observations with ground-based telescopes detected\nelectromagnetic emission from a gravitational wave event for the first time. The observations showed that this\nsource was located in NGC 4993, a galaxy at a distance of about 130 million light-years in the direction of the\nconstellation Hydra. The Fermi satellite detected a flash of gamma rays at the same time and in the same\ndirection, which confirms the long-standing hypothesis that mergers of neutron stars are progenitors of short\ngamma-ray bursts (seeThe Mystery of Gamma-Ray Bursts). Spectra showed that the merger ejected material\nwith a mass of about 6 percent of the mass of the Sun at a speed of one-tenth the speed of light.\nThis material is rich in heavy elements, just as the theory of kilonovas (seeThe Mystery of Gamma-Ray Bursts)\npredicted. First estimates suggest that the merger produced about 200 Earth masses of gold, and around 500\nEarth masses of platinum. This makes clear that neutron star mergers are a significant source of heavy\nelements. More such mergers are being found (seeFigure 24.19) and they will improve estimates of the\nfrequency at which neutron star mergers occur; it may well turn out that the vast majority of heavy elements\nhave been created in such cataclysms.\nNo electromagnetic observations have been detected from the mergers of two black holes.\nIn June 2021, scientists from LIGO and Virgo announced the first detection of mergers between black holes\nand neutron stars, another of the really energetic events that we listed as possible sources for a detectable\nburst of gravitational waves. Again, no electromagnetic waves from the two events were observed or\nexpected, demonstrating the importance of using what we are now calling \u201cmulti-messenger astronomy\u201d to\nunderstand the universe fully.\nObserving the merger of black holes via gravitational waves means that we can now test Einstein\u2019s general\ntheory of relativity where its effects are very strong\u2014close to black holes\u2014and not weak, as they are near\nEarth. One remarkable result from these detections is that the observed signals so closely match the\ntheoretical predictions made using Einstein\u2019s theory. Once again, Einstein\u2019s revolutionary idea is found to be\nthe correct description of nature.\nBecause of the scientific significance of the observations of gravitational waves, three of the LIGO project\nleaders\u2014Rainer Weiss of MIT, and Kip Thorne and Barry Barish of Caltech\u2014were awarded the Nobel Prize in\n2017.\nGround-based gravitational-wave detectors can detect mergers of black holes with masses up to about 100\ntimes the mass of the Sun. Astronomers would now like to look for the merger of distant supermassive black\nholes (seeSupermassive Black Holes: What Quasars Really Are) with masses of thousands to millions of times\nlarger, which might have occurred when the first generation of stars formed, only a few hundred million years\nafter the Big Bang. The gravitational waves emitted by mergers of supermassive black holes are so long that it\nis necessary to go to space to build an observatory large enough to detect them.\nESA (the European Space Agency), with contributions from NASA, is planning to launch a facility named LISA\n(Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) in 2034 to search for mergers of black holes with masses thousands to 828 24 \u2022 Black Holes and Curved Spacetime\nmillions of times larger than the mass of the Sun. The experiment will consist of three spacecraft arranged in\nan equilateral triangle with sides 2.5 million km long, flying along an Earth-like heliocentric orbit. A test mass\nfloats free inside each spacecraft, effectively in free-fall, while the spacecraft around it absorbs the effects of\nlight pressure, solar wind particles, and anything that might perturb its orbit. Lasers will be used to measure\nvery accurately the distances between the test masses. Changes in distance will then signal the passing of\ngravitational waves.\nWe should end by acknowledging that the ideas discussed in this chapter may seem strange and\noverwhelming, especially the first time you read them. The consequences of the general theory of relatively\ntake some getting used to. But they make the universe more bizarre\u2014and interesting\u2014than you probably\nthought before you took this course.\nFigure24.19Some Black Hole Merger Events Observed with Gravitational Waves.The vertical axis shows the masses for some\nknown black holes and neutron stars. The light blue dots represent black hole mergers seen with LIGO-Virgo, with the individual\nblack holes and the resulting merged black hole connected with an arrow. Note that, as a result of these mergers, we are starting to\nobserve some black holes with masses so large that new ideas may be required to explain them. The purple dots represent black\nholes seen with electro-magnetic radiation; these have significantly smaller masses. The orange dots represent neutron star\nmergers seen through the gravitational waves they emit.

According to\nthis principle, there is no way that anyone or any experiment in a sealed environment can distinguish between\nfree fall and the absence of gravity.\n24.2Spacetime and Gravity\nBy considering the consequences of the equivalence principle, Einstein concluded that we live in a curved\nspacetime. The distribution of matter determines the curvature of spacetime; other objects (and even light)\nentering a region of spacetime must follow its curvature. Light must change its path near a massive object not\nbecause light is bent by gravity, but because spacetime is.\n24.3Tests of General Relativity\nIn weak gravitational fields, the predictions of general relativity agree with the predictions of Newton\u2019s law of\ngravity. However, in the stronger gravity of the Sun, general relativity makes predictions that differ from\nNewtonian physics and can be tested. For example, general relativity predicts that light or radio waves will be\ndeflected when they pass near the Sun, and that the position where Mercury is at perihelion would change by\n43 arcsec per century even if there were no other planets in the solar system to perturb its orbit. These\npredictions have been verified by observation.\n24.4Time in General Relativity\nGeneral relativity predicts that the stronger the gravity, the more slowly time must run. Experiments on Earth\nand with spacecraft have confirmed this prediction with remarkable accuracy. When light or other radiation\nemerges from a compact smaller remnant, such as a white dwarf or neutron star, it shows a gravitational\nredshift due to the slowing of time. 830 24 \u2022 For Further Exploration\n24.5Black Holes\nTheory suggests that stars with stellar cores more massive than three times the mass of the Sun at the time\nthey exhaust their nuclear fuel will collapse to become black holes. The surface surrounding a black hole,\nwhere the escape velocity equals the speed of light, is called the event horizon, and the radius of the surface is\ncalled the Schwarzschild radius. Nothing, not even light, can escape through the event horizon from the black\nhole. At its center, each black hole is thought to have a singularity, a point of infinite density and zero volume.\nMatter falling into a black hole appears, as viewed by an outside observer, to freeze in position at the event\nhorizon. However, if we were riding on the infalling matter, we would pass through the event horizon. As we\napproach the singularity, the tidal forces would tear our bodies apart even before we reach the singularity.\n24.6Evidence for Black Holes\nThe best evidence of stellar-mass black holes comes from binary star systems in which (1) one star of the pair\nis not visible, (2) the flickering X-ray emission is characteristic of an accretion disk around a compact object,\nand (3) the orbit and characteristics of the visible star indicate that the mass of its invisible companion is\ngreater than 3M . A number of systems with these characteristics have been found. Black holes with masses\nSun\nof millions to billions of solar masses are found in the centers of large galaxies.\n24.7Gravitational Wave Astronomy\nGeneral relativity predicts that the rearrangement of matter in space should produce gravitational waves. The\nexistence of such waves was first confirmed in observations of a pulsar in orbit around another neutron star\nwhose orbits were spiraling closer and losing energy in the form of gravitational waves. In 2015, LIGO found\ngravitational waves directly by detecting the signal produced by the merger of two stellar-mass black holes,\nopening a new window on the universe. Since then, many other gravitational wave signals have been found,\nsignaling the mergers of both black holes and neutron stars.\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nBlack Holes\nCharles, P. & Wagner, R. \u201cBlack Holes in Binary Stars: Weighing the Evidence.\u201dSky & Telescope(May 1996): 38.\nExcellent review of how we find stellar-mass black holes.\nGezari, S. \u201cStar-Shredding Black Holes.\u201dSky & Telescope(June 2013): 16.

Later in life, he founds his own internet company and becomes very wealthy when it goes\npublic. He sets up a foundation to support the search for black holes in our Galaxy. Your group is the\nallocation committee of this foundation. How would you distribute money each year to increase the\nchances that more black holes will be found?\nB. Suppose for a minute that stars evolvewithoutlosing any mass at any stage of their lives. Your group is\ngiven a list of binary star systems. Each binary contains one main-sequence star and one invisible\ncompanion. The spectral types of the main-sequence stars range from spectral type O to M. Your job is to\ndetermine whether any of the invisible companions might be black holes. Which ones are worth\nobserving? Why? (Hint: Remember that in a binary star system, the two stars form at the same time, but\nthe pace of their evolution depends on the mass of each star.)\nC. You live in the far future, and the members of your group have been convicted (falsely) of high treason.\nThe method of execution is to send everyone into a black hole, but you get to pick which one. Since you\nare doomed to die, you would at least like to see what the inside of a black hole is like\u2014even if you can\u2019t\ntell anyone outside about it. Would you choose a black hole with a mass equal to that of Jupiter or one\nwith a mass equal to that of an entire galaxy? Why? What would happen to you as you approached the\nevent horizon in each case? (Hint: Consider the difference in force on your feet and your head as you cross\nover the event horizon.)\nD. General relativity is one of the areas of modern astrophysics where we can clearly see the frontiers of\nhuman knowledge. We have begun to learn about black holes and warped spacetime recently and are\nhumbled by how much we still don\u2019t know. Research in this field is supported mostly by grants from\ngovernment agencies. Have your group discuss what reasons there are for our tax dollars to support such\n\u201cfar out\u201d (seemingly impractical) work. Can you make a list of \u201cfar out\u201d areas of research in past centuries\nthat later led to practical applications? What if general relativity does not have many practical\napplications? Do you think a small part of society\u2019s funds should still go to exploring theories about the\nnature of space and time?\nE. Once you all have read this chapter, work with your group to come up with a plot for a science fiction story\nthat uses the properties of black holes.\nF. Black holes seem to be fascinating not just to astronomers but to the public, and they have become part\nof popular culture. Searching online, have group members research examples of black holes in music,\nadvertising, cartoons, and the movies, and then make a presentation to share the examples you found\nwith the whole class.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 24 \u2022 Exercises 833\nG.

A wormhole is a theoretically possible way to use a large, spinning\nblack hole to find a way to travel from one place in the universe to another without having to go through\nregular spacetime to get there.)\nExercises\nReview Questions\n1. How does the equivalence principle lead us to suspect that spacetime might be curved?\n2. If general relativity offers the best description of what happens in the presence of gravity, why do physicists\nstill make use of Newton\u2019s equations in describing gravitational forces on Earth (when building a bridge, for\nexample)?\n3. Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity made or allowed us to make predictions about the outcome of several\nexperiments that had not yet been carried out at the time the theory was first published. Describe three\nexperiments that verified the predictions of the theory after Einstein proposed it.\n4. If a black hole itself emits no radiation, what evidence do astronomers and physicists today have that the\ntheory of black holes is correct?\n5. What characteristics must a binary star have to be a good candidate for a black hole? Why is each of these\ncharacteristics important?\n6. A student becomes so excited by the whole idea of black holes that he decides to jump into one. It has a\nmass 10 times the mass of our Sun. What is the trip like for him? What is it like for the rest of the class,\nwatching from afar?\n7. What is an event horizon? Does our Sun have an event horizon around it?\n8. What is a gravitational wave and why was it so hard to detect?\n9. What are some strong sources of gravitational waves that astronomers hope to detect in the future?\n10. Suppose the amount of mass in a black hole doubles. Does the event horizon change? If so, how does it\nchange?\nThought Questions\n11. Imagine that you have built a large room around the people inFigure 24.4and that this room is falling at\nexactly the same rate as they are. Galileo showed that if there is no air friction, light and heavy objects that\nare dropping due to gravity will fall at the same rate. Suppose that this were not true and that instead\nheavy objects fall faster. Also suppose that the man inFigure 24.4is twice as massive as the woman. What\nwould happen? Would this violate the equivalence principle?\n12. A monkey hanging from a tree branch sees a hunter aiming a rifle directly at him. The monkey then sees a\nflash and knows that the rifle has been fired. Reacting quickly, the monkey lets go of the branch and drops\nso that the bullet can pass harmlessly over his head. Does this act save the monkey\u2019s life? Why or why\nnot? (Hint: Consider the similarities between this situation and that ofExercise 24.11.)\n13. Why would we not expect to detect X-rays from a disk of matter about an ordinary star? 834 24 \u2022 Exercises\n14. Look elsewhere in this book for necessary data, and indicate what the final stage of evolution\u2014white\ndwarf, neutron star, or black hole\u2014will be for each of these kinds of stars.\nA.

Which is likely to be more common in our Galaxy: white dwarfs or black holes? Why?\n16. If the Sun could suddenly collapse to a black hole, how would the period of Earth\u2019s revolution about it\ndiffer from what it is now?\n17. Suppose the people inFigure 24.4are in an elevator moving upward with an acceleration equal tog, but in\nthe opposite direction. The woman throws the ball to the man with a horizontal force. What happens to\nthe ball?\n18. You arrange to meet a friend at 5:00 p.m. on Valentine\u2019s Day on the observation deck of the Empire State\nBuilding in New York City. You arrive right on time, but your friend is not there. She arrives 5 minutes late\nand says the reason is that time runs faster at the top of a tall building, so she is on time but you were\nearly. Is your friend right? Does time run slower or faster at the top of a building, as compared with its\nbase? Is this a reasonable excuse for your friend arriving 5 minutes late?\n19. You are standing on a scale in an elevator when the cable snaps, sending the elevator car into free fall.\nBefore the automatic brakes stop your fall, you glance at the scale reading. Does the scale show your real\nweight? An apparent weight? Something else?\nFiguring for Yourself\n20. Look upG,c, and the mass of the Sun inAppendix Eand calculate the radius of a black hole that has the\nsame mass as the Sun. (Note that this is only a theoretical calculation. The Sun does not have enough\nmass to become a black hole.)\n21. Suppose you wanted to know the size of black holes with masses that are larger or smaller than the Sun.\nYou could go through all the steps inExercise 24.20, wrestling with a lot of large numbers with large\nexponents. You could be clever, however, and evaluate all the constants in the equation once and then\nsimply vary the mass. You could even express the mass in terms of the Sun\u2019s mass and make future\ncalculations really easy. Show that the event horizon equation is equivalent to saying that the radius of the\nevent horizon is equal to 3 km times the mass of the black hole in units of the Sun\u2019s mass.\n22. Use the result fromExercise 24.21to calculate the radius of a black hole with a mass equal to: the Earth, a\nB0-type main-sequence star, a globular cluster, and the Milky Way Galaxy. Look elsewhere in this text and\nthe appendixes for tables that provide data on the mass of these four objects.\n23. Since the force of gravity a significant distance away from the event horizon of a black hole is the same as\nthat of an ordinary object of the same mass, Kepler\u2019s third law is valid. Suppose that Earth collapsed to the\nsize of a golf ball. What would be the period of revolution of the Moon, orbiting at its current distance of\n400,000 km? Use Kepler\u2019s third law to calculate the period of revolution of a spacecraft orbiting at a\ndistance of 6000 km.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 25 \u2022 Thinking Ahead 835\n25\nThe Milky Way Galaxy\nFigure25.1Milky Way Galaxy.The Milky Way rises over Square Tower, an ancestral pueblo building at Hovenweep National\nMonument in Utah.

How can we \u201cweigh\u201d such an enormous system of stars and measure its total mass?\nOne of the most striking features you can see in a truly dark sky\u2014one without light pollution\u2014is the band of\nfaint white light called the Milky Way, which stretches from one horizon to the other. The name comes from an\nancient Greek legend that compared its faint white splash of light to a stream of spilled milk. But folktales\ndiffer from culture to culture: one East African tribe thought of the hazy band as the smoke of ancient\ncampfires, several Native American stories tell of a path across the sky traveled by sacred animals, and in\nSiberia, the diffuse arc was known as the seam of the tent of the sky.\nIn 1610, Galileo made the first telescopic survey of the Milky Way and discovered that it is composed of a\nmultitude of individual stars. Today, we know that the Milky Way comprises our view inward of the huge\ncosmic pinwheel that we call the Milky Way Galaxy and that is our home. Moreover, our Galaxy is now\nrecognized as just one galaxy among many billions of other galaxies in the cosmos. 836 25 \u2022 The Milky Way Galaxy\n25.1 The Architecture of the Galaxy\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain why William and Caroline Herschel concluded that the Milky Way has a flattened structure\ncentered on the Sun and solar system\nDescribe the challenges of determining the Galaxy\u2019s structure from our vantage point within it\nIdentify the main components of the Galaxy\nTheMilky Way Galaxysurrounds us, and you might think it is easy to study because it is so close. However,\nthe very fact that we are embedded within it presents a difficult challenge. Suppose you were given the task of\nmapping New York City. You could do a much better job from a helicopter flying over the city than you could if\nyou were standing in Times Square. Similarly, it would be easier to map our Galaxy if we could only get a little\nway outside it, but instead we are trapped inside and way out in its suburbs\u2014far from the galactic equivalent\nof Times Square.\nHerschel Measures the Galaxy\nIn 1785, WilliamHerschel(Figure 25.2) made the first important discovery about the architecture of the Milky\nWay Galaxy. Using a large reflecting telescope that he had built, William and his sister Caroline counted stars\nin different directions of the sky. They found that most of the stars they could see lay in a flattened structure\nencircling the sky, and that the numbers of stars were about the same in any direction around this structure.\nHerschel therefore concluded that the stellar system to which the Sun belongs has the shape of a disk or\nwheel (he might have called it a Frisbee except Frisbees hadn\u2019t been invented yet), and that the Sun must be\nnear the hub of the wheel (Figure 25.3).\nFigure25.2William Herschel (1738\u20131822) and Caroline Herschel (1750\u20131848).William Herschel was a German musician who\nemigrated to England and took up astronomy in his spare time. He discovered the planet Uranus, built several large telescopes, and\nmade measurements of the Sun\u2019s place in the Galaxy, the Sun\u2019s motion through space, and the comparative brightnesses of stars.\nThis painting shows William and his sister Caroline polishing a telescope lens. (credit: modification of work by the Wellcome Library)\nTo understand why Herschel reached this conclusion, imagine that you are a member of a band standing in\nformation during halftime at a football game. If you count the band members you see in different directions\nand get about the same number each time, you can conclude that the band has arranged itself in a circular\npattern with you at the center. Since you see no band members above you or underground, you know that the\ncircle made by the band is much flatter than it is wide.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 25.1 \u2022 The Architecture of the Galaxy 837\nFigure25.3Herschel\u2019s Diagram of the Milky Way.Herschel constructed this cross section of the Galaxy by counting stars in\nvarious directions.\nWe now know that Herschel was right about the shape of our system, but wrong about where the Sun lies\nwithin the disk. As we saw inBetween the Stars: Gas and Dust in Space, we live in a dusty Galaxy. Because\ninterstellar dust absorbs the light from stars, Herschel could see only those stars within about 6000 light-years\nof the Sun. Today we know that this is a very small section of the entire 100,000-light-year-diameter disk of\nstars that makes up the Galaxy.\nVOYAGERS IN ASTRONOMY\nHarlow Shapley: Mapmaker to the Stars\nUntil the early 1900s, astronomers generally accepted Herschel\u2019s conclusion that the Sun is near the center\nof the Galaxy. The discovery of the Galaxy\u2019s true size and our actual location came about largely through\nthe efforts of HarlowShapley. In 1917, he was studying RR Lyrae variable stars in globular clusters. By\ncomparing the known intrinsic luminosity of these stars to how bright they appeared, Shapley could\ncalculate how far away they are. (Recall that it is distance that makes the stars look dimmer than they would\nbe \u201cup close,\u201d and that the brightness fades as the distance squared.) Knowing the distance to any star in a\ncluster then tells us the distance to the cluster itself.\nGlobular clusters can be found in regions that are free of interstellar dust and so can be seen at very large\ndistances. When Shapley used the distances and directions of 93 globular clusters to map out their\npositions in space, he found that the clusters are distributed in a spherical volume, which has its center not\nat the Sun but at a distant point along the Milky Way in the direction of Sagittarius. Shapley then made the\nbold assumption, verified by many other observations since then, that the point on which the system of\nglobular clusters is centered is also the center of the entire Galaxy (Figure 25.4). 838 25 \u2022 The Milky Way Galaxy\nFigure25.4Harlow Shapley and His Diagram of the Milky Way.(a) Shapley poses for a formal portrait. (b) His diagram shows\nthe location of globular clusters, with the position of the Sun also marked. The black area shows Herschel\u2019s old diagram, centered\non the Sun, approximately to scale.\nShapley\u2019s work showed once and for all that our star has no special place in the Galaxy. We are in a\nnondescript region of the Milky Way, only one of 200 to 400 billion stars that circle the distant center of our\nGalaxy.\nBorn in 1885 on a farm in Missouri, Harlow Shapley at first dropped out of school with the equivalent of only\na fifth-grade education. He studied at home and at age 16 got a job as a newspaper reporter covering crime\nstories. Frustrated by the lack of opportunities for someone who had not finished high school, Shapley went\nback and completed a six-year high-school program in only two years, graduating as class valedictorian.\nIn 1907, at age 22, he went to the University of Missouri, intent on studying journalism, but found that the\nschool of journalism would not open for a year. Leafing through the college catalog (or so he told the story\nlater), he chanced to see \u201cAstronomy\u201d among the subjects beginning with \u201cA.\u201d Recalling his boyhood\ninterest in the stars, he decided to study astronomy for the next year (and the rest, as the saying goes, is\nhistory).\nUpon graduation Shapley received a fellowship for graduate study at Princeton and began to work with the\nbrilliant Henry Norris Russell (see theHenry Norris Russellfeature box). For his PhD thesis, Shapley made\nmajor contributions to the methods of analyzing the behavior of eclipsing binary stars. He was also able to\nshow that cepheid variable stars are not binary systems, as some people thought at the time, but individual\nstars that pulsate with striking regularity.\nImpressed with Shapley\u2019s work, George Ellery Hale offered him a position at the Mount Wilson Observatory,\nwhere the young man took advantage of the clear mountain air and the 60-inch reflector to do his\npioneering study of variable stars in globular clusters.\nShapley subsequently accepted the directorship of the Harvard College Observatory, and over the next 30\nyears, he and his collaborators made contributions to many fields of astronomy, including the study of\nneighboring galaxies, the discovery of dwarf galaxies, a survey of the distribution of galaxies in the\nuniverse, and much more. He wrote a series of nontechnical books and articles and became known as one\nof the most effective popularizers of astronomy. Shapley enjoyed giving lectures around the country,\nAccess for free at openstax.org 25.1 \u2022 The Architecture of the Galaxy 839\nincluding at many smaller colleges where students and faculty rarely got to interact with scientists of his\ncaliber.\nDuring World War II, Shapley helped rescue many scientists and their families from Eastern Europe; later,\nhe helped found UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. He wrote a\npamphlet calledScience from Shipboardfor men and women in the armed services who had to spend\nmany weeks on board transport ships to Europe. And during the difficult period of the 1950s, when\ncongressional committees began their \u201cwitch hunts\u201d for communist sympathizers (including such liberal\nleaders as Shapley), he spoke out forcefully and fearlessly in defense of the freedom of thought and\nexpression. A man of many interests, he was fascinated by the behavior of ants, and wrote scientific papers\nabout them as well as about galaxies.\nBy the time he died in 1972, Shapley was acknowledged as one of the pivotal figures of modern astronomy,\na \u201ctwentieth-century Copernicus\u201d who mapped the Milky Way and showed us our place in the Galaxy.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTo find more information aboutShapley\u2019s life and work(https://openstax.org/l/30shapbrumed), see the\nentry for him on the Bruce Medalists website. (This site features the winners of the Bruce Medal of the\nAstronomical Society of the Pacific, one of the highest honors in astronomy; the list is a who\u2019s who of some\nof the greatest astronomers of the last twelve decades.)\nDisks and Haloes\nWith modern instruments, astronomers can now penetrate the \u201csmog\u201d of the Milky Way by studying radio and\ninfrared emissions from distant parts of the Galaxy. Measurements at these wavelengths (as well as\nobservations of other galaxies like ours) have given us a good idea of what the Milky Way would look like if we\ncouldobserve it from a distance.\nFigure 25.5sketches what we would see if we could view the Galaxy face-on and edge-on. The brightest part of\nthe Galaxy consists of a thin, circular, rotating disk of stars distributed across a region about 100,000 light-\nyears in diameter and about 2000 light-years thick. (Given how thin the disk is, perhaps a CD is a more\nappropriate analogy than a wheel.) The very youngest stars, and the dust and gas from which stars form, are\nfound typically within 100 light-years of the plane of the Milky Way Galaxy. The mass of the interstellar matter\nis about 15% of the mass of the stars in this disk. 840 25 \u2022 The Milky Way Galaxy\nFigure25.5Schematic Representation of the Galaxy.The left image shows the face-on view of the spiral disk; the right image\nshows the view looking edge-on along the disk. The major spiral arms are labeled. The Sun is located on the inside edge of the short\nOrion spur.\nAs the diagram inFigure 25.5shows, the stars, gas, and dust are not spread evenly throughout the disk but are\nconcentrated into a central bar and a series of spiral arms. Recent infrared observations have confirmed that\nthe central bar is composed mostly of old yellow-red stars. The two main spiral arms appear to connect with\nthe ends of the bar. They are highlighted by the blue light from young hot stars. We know many other spiral\ngalaxies that also have bar-shaped concentrations of stars in their central regions; for that reason they are\ncalledbarred spirals.Figure 25.6shows two other galaxies\u2014one without a bar and one with a strong bar\u2014to\ngive you a basis for comparison to our own. We will describe our spiral structure in more detail shortly. The\nSun is located about halfway between the center of the Galaxy and the edge of the disk and only about 70\nlight-years above its central plane.\nFigure25.6Unbarred and Barred Spiral Galaxies.(a) This image shows theunbarred spiral galaxyM74. It contains a small central\nbulge of mostly old yellow-red stars, along with spiral arms that are highlighted with the blue light from young hot stars. (b) This\nAccess for free at openstax.org 25.1 \u2022 The Architecture of the Galaxy 841\nimage shows the stronglybarred spiral galaxyNGC 1365. The bulge and the fainter bar both appear yellowish because the brightest\nstars in them are mostly old yellow and red giants. Two main spiral arms project from the ends of the bar. As in M74, these spiral\narms are populated with blue stars and red patches of glowing gas\u2014hallmarks of recent star formation. The Milky Way Galaxy is\nthought to have a barred spiral structure that is intermediate between these two examples. (credit a: modification of work by ESO/\nPESSTO/S. Smartt; credit b: modification of work by ESO)\nOur thin disk of young stars, gas, and dust is embedded in a thicker but more diffuse disk of older stars; this\nthicker disk extends about 1000 light-years above and 1000 light-years below the midplane of the thin disk and\ncontains only about 5% as much mass as the thin disk. The stars thin out with distance from the galactic plane\nand don\u2019t have a sharp edge. Approximately 2/3 of the stars in the thick disk are within 1000 light-years of\nmidplane.\nClose in to the galactic center (within about 10,000 light-years), the stars are no longer confined to the disk but\nform acentral bulge(ornuclear bulge). When we observe with visible light, we can glimpse the stars in the\nbulge only in those rare directions where there happens to be relatively little interstellar dust. The first picture\nthat actually succeeded in showing the bulge as a whole was taken at infrared wavelengths (Figure 25.7).\nFigure25.7Inner Part of the Milky Way Galaxy.This beautiful infrared map, showing half a billion stars, was obtained as part of\nthe Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). Because interstellar dust does not absorb infrared as strongly as visible light, this view\nreveals the previously hidden bulge of old stars that surrounds the center of our Galaxy, along with the Galaxy\u2019s thin disk\ncomponent. (credit: modification of work by 2MASS/J. Carpenter, T. H. Jarrett, and R. Hurt)\nThe fact that much of the bulge is obscured by dust makes its shape difficult to determine. For a long time,\nastronomers assumed it was spherical. However, infrared images and other data indicate that the bulge is\nabout two times longer than it is wide, and shaped rather like a peanut. The relationship between this\nelongated inner bulge and the larger bar of stars remains uncertain. At the very center of the nuclear bulge is\na tremendous concentration of matter, which we will discuss later in this chapter.\nIn our Galaxy, the thin and thick disks and the nuclear bulge are embedded in a sphericalhaloof very old,\nfaint stars that extends to a distance of at least 150,000 light-years from the galactic center. Most of the\nglobular clusters are also found in this halo.\nThe mass in the Milky Way extends even farther out, well beyond the boundary of the luminous stars to a\ndistance of at least 200,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy. This invisible mass has been give the\nnamedark matterbecause it emits no light and cannot be seen with any telescope. Its composition is\nunknown, and it can be detected only because of its gravitational effects on the motions of luminous matter\nthat we can see. We know that this extensivedark matter haloexists because of its effects on the orbits of\ndistant star clusters and other dwarf galaxies that are associated with the Galaxy. This mysterious halo will be\na subject of the section onThe Mass of the Galaxy, and the properties of dark matter will be discussed more in\nthe chapter onThe Big Bang.\nSome vital statistics of the thin and thickdisks and the stellarhaloare given inTable 25.1, with an illustration in\nFigure 25.8. Note particularly how the ages of stars correlate with where they are found. As we shall see, this\ninformation holds important clues to how theMilky Way Galaxyformed. 842 25 \u2022 The Milky Way Galaxy\nCharacteristics of the Milky Way Galaxy\nProperty Thin Disk Thick Disk Stellar Halo (Excludes\nDark Matter)\nA few percent of the thin disk\nStellar mass 4 \u00d7 1010M 1010M\nSun Sun\nmass\nA few percent of the thin disk\nLuminosity 3 \u00d7 1010L 8 \u00d7 108L\nSun Sun\nluminosity\n1 million to 10\nTypical age of stars 11 billion years 13 billion years\nbillion years\nHeavier-element\nHigh Intermediate Very low\nabundance\nRotation High Intermediate Very low\nTable25.1\nFigure25.8Major Parts of the Milky Way Galaxy.This schematic shows the major components of our Galaxy.\nEstablishing this overall picture of the Galaxy from our dust-shrouded viewpoint inside the thin disk has been\none of the great achievements of modern astronomy (and one that took decades of effort by astronomers\nworking with a wide range of telescopes). One thing that helped enormously was the discovery that our\nGalaxy is not unique in its characteristics. There are many other flat, spiral-shaped islands of stars, gas, and\ndust in the universe. For example, the Milky Way somewhat resembles the Andromeda galaxy, which, at a\ndistance of about 2.3 million light-years, is our nearest neighboring giant spiral galaxy. Just as you can get a\nmuch better picture of yourself if someone else takes the photo from a distance away, pictures and other\ndiagnostic observations of nearby galaxies that resemble ours have been vital to our understanding of the\nproperties of the Milky Way.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 25.1 \u2022 The Architecture of the Galaxy 843\nLINK TO LEARNING\nStart thisvideo(https://openstax.org/l/30gaiastars), then click-and-drag to look in all directions from Earth\nin the Gaia space telescope\u2019s visualization of the stars of our galaxy.\nTheMilky Way viewer(https://openstax.org/l/30milkywayview)allows you to move to different locations in\nthe Milky Way (using the Move and Zoom buttons) and view different stellar populations.\nMAKING CONNECTIONS\nThe Milky Way Galaxy in Myth and Legend\nTo most of us living in the twenty-first century, theMilky Way Galaxyis an elusive sight. We must make an\neffort to leave our well-lit homes and streets and venture beyond our cities and suburbs into less populated\nenvironments. Once the light pollution subsides to negligible levels, the Milky Way can be readily spotted\narching over the sky on clear, moonless nights. The Milky Way is especially bright in late summer and early\nfall in the Northern Hemisphere. Some of the best places to view the Milky Way are in our national and state\nparks, where residential and industrial developments have been kept to a minimum. Some of these parks\nhost special sky-gazing events that are definitely worth checking out\u2014especially during the two weeks\nsurrounding the new moon, when the faint stars and Milky Way don\u2019t have to compete with the Moon\u2019s\nbrilliance.\nGo back a few centuries, and these starlit sights would have been the norm rather than the exception.\nBefore the advent of electric or even gas lighting, people relied on short-lived fires to illuminate their\nhomes and byways. Consequently, their night skies were typically much darker. Confronted by myriad\nstellar patterns and the Milky Way\u2019s gauzy band of diffuse light, people of all cultures developed myths to\nmake sense of it all.\nSome of the oldest myths relating to the Milky Way are maintained by the aboriginal Australians through\ntheir rock painting and storytelling. These legacies are thought to go back tens of thousands of years, to\nwhen the aboriginal people were being \u201cdreamed\u201d along with the rest of the cosmos. The Milky Way played\na central role as an arbiter of the Creation. Taking the form of a great serpent, it joined with the Earth\nserpent to dream and thus create all the creatures on Earth.\nThe ancient Greeks viewed the Milky Way as a spray of milk that spilled from the breast of the goddess\nHera. In this legend, Zeus had secretly placed his infant son Heracles at Hera\u2019s breast while she was asleep\nin order to give his half-human son immortal powers. When Hera awoke and found Heracles suckling, she\npushed him away, causing her milk to spray forth into the cosmos (Figure 25.9).\nThe dynastic Chinese regarded the Milky Way as a \u201csilver river\u201d that was made to separate two star-crossed\nlovers. To the east of the Milky Way, Zhi Nu, the weaving maiden, was identified with the bright starVegain\nthe constellation of Lyra the Harp. To the west of the Milky Way, her lover Niu Lang, the cowherd, was\nassociated with the star Altair in the constellation of Aquila the Eagle. They had been exiled on opposite\nsides of the Milky Way by Zhi Nu\u2019s mother, the Queen of Heaven, after she heard of their secret marriage\nand the birth of their two children. However, once a year, they are permitted to reunite. On the seventh day\nof the seventh lunar month (which typically occurs in our month of August), they would meet on a bridge\nover the Milky Way that thousands of magpies had made (Figure 25.9). This romantic time continues to be\ncelebrated today as Qi Xi, meaning \u201cDouble Seventh,\u201d with couples reenacting the cosmic reunion of Zhi Nu 844 25 \u2022 The Milky Way Galaxy\nand Niu Lang.\nFigure25.9The Milky Way in Myth.(a)Origin of the Milky Wayby Jacopo Tintoretto (circa 1575) illustrates the Greek myth that\nexplains the formation of the Milky Way. (b)The Moon of the Milky Wayby Japanese painter Tsukioka Yoshitoshi depicts the\nChinese legend of Zhi Nu and Niu Lang.\nTo the Quechua Indians of Andean Peru, the Milky Way was seen as the celestial abode for all sorts of\ncosmic creatures. Arrayed along the Milky Way are myriad dark patches that they identified with partridges,\nllamas, a toad, a snake, a fox, and other animals. The Quechua\u2019s orientation toward the dark regions rather\nthan the glowing band of starlight appears to be unique among all the myth makers. Likely, their access to\nthe richly structured southern Milky Way had something to do with it.\nAmong Finns, Estonians, and related northern European cultures, the Milky Way is regarded as the\n\u201cpathway of birds\u201d across the night sky. Having noted that birds seasonally migrate along a north-south\nroute, they identified this byway with the Milky Way. Recent scientific studies have shown that this myth is\nrooted in fact: the birds of this region use the Milky Way as a guide for their annual migrations.\nToday, we regard the Milky Way as our galactic abode, where the foment of star birth and star death plays\nout on a grand stage, and where sundry planets have been found to be orbiting all sorts of stars. Although\nour perspective on the Milky Way is based on scientific investigations, we share with our forebears an\naffinity for telling stories of origin and transformation. In these regards, the Milky Way continues to\nfascinate and inspire us.\n25.2 Spiral Structure\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the structure of the Milky Way Galaxy and how astronomers discovered it\nCompare theoretical models for the formation of spiral arms in disk galaxies\nAstronomers were able to make tremendous progress in mapping the spiral structure of the Milky Way after\nthe discovery of the21-cm linethat comes from cool hydrogen (seeBetween the Stars: Gas and Dust in Space).\nRemember that the obscuring effect of interstellar dust prevents us from seeing stars at large distances in the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 25.2 \u2022 Spiral Structure 845\ndisk at visible wavelengths. However, radio waves of 21-cm wavelength pass right through the dust, enabling\nastronomers to detect hydrogen atoms throughout the Galaxy. More recent surveys of the infrared emission\nfrom stars in the disk have provided a similar dust-free perspective of our Galaxy\u2019s stellar distribution. Despite\nall this progress over the past fifty years, we are still just beginning to pin down the precise structure of our\nGalaxy.\nThe Arms of the Milky Way\nOurradio observationsof the disk\u2019s gaseous component indicate that the Galaxy has two major spiral arms\nthat emerge from the bar and several fainter arms and shorter spurs. You can see a recently assembled map\nof our Galaxy\u2019s arm structure\u2014derived from studies in the infrared\u2014inFigure 25.10.\nFigure25.10Milky Way Bar and Arms.Here, we see the Milky Way Galaxy as it would look from above. This image, assembled from\ndata from NASA\u2019s Spitzer mission, shows that the Milky Way Galaxy has a modest bar in its central regions. Two spiral arms, Scutum-\nCentaurus and Perseus, emerge from the ends of the bar and wrap around the bulge. The Sagittarius and Outer arms have fewer\nstars than the other two arms. (credit: modification of work by NASA/JPL-Caltech/R. Hurt (SSC/Caltech))\nThe Sun is near the inner edge of a short arm called the Orion Spur, which is about 10,000 light-years long and\ncontains such conspicuous features as the Cygnus Rift (the great dark nebula in the summer Milky Way) and\nthe brightOrion Nebula.Figure 25.11shows a few other objects that share this small section of the Galaxy\nwith us and are easy to see. Remember, the farther away we try to look from our own arm, the more the dust 846 25 \u2022 The Milky Way Galaxy\nin the Galaxy builds up and makes it hard to see with visible light.\nFigure25.11Orion Spur.The Sun is located in the Orion Spur, which is a minor spiral arm located between two other arms. In this\ndiagram, the white lines point to some other noteworthy objects that share this feature of the Milky Way Galaxy with the Sun. (credit:\nmodification of work by NASA/JPL-Caltech)\nFormation of Spiral Structure\nAt the Sun\u2019s distance from its center, the Galaxy does not rotate like a solid wheel or a CD inside your player.\nInstead, the way individual objects turn around the center of the Galaxy is more like the solar system. Stars, as\nwell as the clouds of gas and dust, obey Kepler\u2019s third law. Objects farther from the center take longer to\ncomplete an orbit around the Galaxy than do those closer to the center. In other words, stars (and interstellar\nmatter) in larger orbits in the Galaxy trail behind those in smaller ones. This effect is calleddifferential\ngalactic rotation.\nDifferential rotation would appear to explain why so much of the material in the disk of the Milky Way is\nconcentrated into elongated features that resemblespiral arms. No matter what the original distribution of\nthe material might be, the differential rotation of the Galaxy can stretch it out into spiral features.Figure 25.12\nshows the development of spiral arms from two irregular blobs of interstellar matter. Notice that as the\nportions of the blobs closest to the galactic center move faster, those farther out trail behind.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 25.2 \u2022 Spiral Structure 847\nFigure25.12Simplified Model for the Formation of Spiral Arms.This sketch shows how spiral arms might form from irregular\nclouds of interstellar material stretched out by the different rotation rates throughout the Galaxy. The regions farthest from the\ngalactic center take longer to complete their orbits and thus lag behind the inner regions. If this were the only mechanism for\ncreating spiral arms, then over time the spiral arms would completely wind up and disappear. Since many galaxies have spiral arms,\nthey must be long-lived, and there must be other processes at work to maintain them.\nBut this picture of spiral arms presents astronomers with an immediate problem. If that\u2019s all there were to the\nstory, differential rotation\u2014over the roughly 13-billion-year history of the Galaxy\u2014would have wound the\nGalaxy\u2019s arms tighter and tighter until all semblance of spiral structure had disappeared. But did the Milky\nWay actually have spiral arms when it formed 13 billion years ago? And do spiral arms, once formed, last for\nthat long a time?\nWith the advent of the Hubble Space Telescope, it has become possible to observe the structure of very distant\ngalaxies and to see what they were like shortly after they began to form more than 13 billion years ago. What\nthe observations show is that galaxies in their infancy had bright, clumpy star-forming regions, but no regular\nspiral structure.\nOver the next few billion years, the galaxies began to \u201csettle down.\u201d The galaxies that were to become spirals\nlost their massive clumps and developed a central bulge. The turbulence in these galaxies decreased, rotation\nbegan to dominate the motions of the stars and gas, and stars began to form in a much quieter disk. Smaller\nstar-forming clumps began to form fuzzy, not-very-distinct spiral arms. Bright, well-defined spiral arms began\nto appear only when the galaxies were about 3.6 billion years old. Initially, there were two well-defined arms.\nMulti-armed structures in galaxies like we see in the Milky Way appeared only when the universe was about 8\nbillion years old.\nWe will discuss the history of galaxies in more detail inThe Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies. But, even\nfrom our brief discussion, you can get the sense that the spiral structures we now observe in mature galaxies\nhave come along later in the full story of how things develop in the universe.\nScientists have used supercomputer calculations to model the formation and evolution of the arms. These\ncalculations follow the motions of up to 100 million \u201cstar particles\u201d to see whether gravitational forces can\ncause them to form spiral structure. What these calculations show is that giant molecular clouds (which we\ndiscussed inBetween the Stars: Gas and Dust in Space) have enough gravitational influence over their\nsurroundings to initiate the formation of structures that look like spiral arms. These arms then become self-\nperpetuating and can survive for at least several billion years. The arms may change their brightness over time\nas star formation comes and goes, but they are not temporary features. The concentration of matter in the\narms exerts sufficient gravitational force to keep the arms together over long periods of time. 848 25 \u2022 The Milky Way Galaxy\n25.3 The Mass of the Galaxy\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe historical attempts to determine the mass of the Galaxy\nInterpret the observed rotation curve of our Galaxy to suggest the presence of dark matter whose\ndistribution extends well beyond the Sun\u2019s orbit\nWhen we described the sections of the Milky Way, we said that the stars are now known to be surrounded by a\nmuch larger halo of invisible matter. Let\u2019s see how this surprising discovery was made.\nKepler Helps Weigh the Galaxy\nThe Sun, like all the other stars in the Galaxy, orbits the center of the Milky Way. Our star\u2019s orbit is nearly\ncircular and lies in the Galaxy\u2019s disk. The speed of the Sun in its orbit is about 200 kilometers per second, which\nmeans it takes us approximately 225 million years to go once around the center of the Galaxy. We call the\nperiod of the Sun\u2019s revolution thegalactic year. It is a long time compared to human time scales; during the\nentire lifetime of Earth, only about 20 galactic years have passed. This means that we have gone only a tiny\nfraction of the way around the Galaxy in all the time that humans have gazed into the sky.\nWe can use the information about the Sun\u2019s orbit to estimate the mass of the Galaxy (just as we could \u201cweigh\u201d\nthe Sun by monitoring the orbit of a planet around it\u2014seeOrbits and Gravity). Let\u2019s assume that the Sun\u2019s\norbit is circular and that the Galaxy is roughly spherical, (we know the Galaxy is shaped more like a disk, but to\nsimplify the calculation we will make this assumption, which illustrates the basic approach). Long ago,Newton\nshowed that if you have matter distributed in the shape of a sphere, then it is simple to calculate the pull of\ngravity on some object just outside that sphere: you can assume that gravity acts as if all the matter were\nconcentrated at a point in the center of the sphere. For our calculation, then, we can assume that all the mass\nthat lies inward of the Sun\u2019s position is concentrated at the center of the Galaxy, and that the Sun orbits that\npoint from a distance of about 26,000 light-years.\nThis is the sort of situation to whichKepler\u2019s third law (as modified by Newton) can be directly applied.\nPlugging numbers into Kepler\u2019s formula, we can calculate the sum of the masses of the Galaxy and the Sun.\nHowever, the mass of the Sun is completely trivial compared to the mass of the Galaxy. Thus, for all practical\npurposes, the result (about 100 billion times the mass of the Sun) is the mass of the Milky Way. More\nsophisticated calculations based on more sophisticated models give a similar result.\nOur estimate tells us how much mass is contained in the volume inside the Sun\u2019s orbit. This is a good estimate\nfor the total mass of the Galaxy only if hardly any mass lies outside the Sun\u2019s orbit. For many years\nastronomers thought this assumption was reasonable. The number of bright stars and the amount of\nluminous matter(meaning any material from which we can detect electromagnetic radiation) both drop off\ndramatically at distances of more than about 30,000 light-years from the galactic center. Little did we suspect\nhow wrong our assumption was.\nA Galaxy of Mostly Invisible Matter\nIn science, what seems to be a reasonable assumption can later turn out to be wrong (which is why we\ncontinue to do observations and experiments every chance we get). There is a lot more to the Milky Way than\nmeets the eye (or our instruments). While there is relatively little luminous matter beyond 30,000 light-years,\nwe now know that a lot ofinvisible matterexists at great distances from the galactic center.\nWe can understand how astronomers detected this invisible matter by remembering that according to\nKepler\u2019s third law, objects orbiting at large distances from a massive object will move more slowly than objects\nthat are closer to that central mass. In the case of the solar system, for example, the outer planets move more\nslowly in their orbits than the planets close to the Sun.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 25.3 \u2022 The Mass of the Galaxy 849\nThere are a few objects, including globular clusters and some nearby small satellite galaxies, that lie well\noutside the luminous boundary of the Milky Way. If most of the mass of our Galaxy were concentrated within\nthe luminous region, then these very distant objects should travel around their galactic orbits at lower speeds\nthan, for example, the Sun does.\nIt turns out, however, that the few objects seen at large distances from the luminous boundary of the Milky\nWay Galaxy arenotmoving more slowly than the Sun. There are some globular clusters and RR Lyrae stars\nbetween 30,000 and 150,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy, and their orbital velocities are even\ngreater than the Sun\u2019s (Figure 25.13).\nFigure25.13Rotation Curve of the Galaxy.The orbital speed of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H) gas at different distances\nfrom the center of the Milky Way Galaxy is shown in red. The blue curve shows what the rotation curve would look like if all the\nmatter in the Galaxy were located inside a radius of 50,000 light-years. Instead of going down, the speed of gas clouds farther out\nremains high, indicating a great deal of mass beyond the Sun\u2019s orbit. The horizontal axis shows the distance from the galactic center\nin kiloparsecs (where a kiloparsec equals 3,260 light-years).\nWhat do these higher speeds mean? Kepler\u2019s third law tells us how fast objects must orbit a source of gravity if\nthey are neither to fall in (because they move too slowly) nor to escape (because they move too fast). If the\nGalaxy had only the mass calculated by Kepler, then the high-speed outer objects should long ago have\nescaped the grip of the Milky Way. The fact that they have not done so means that our Galaxy must have more\ngravity than can be supplied by the luminous matter\u2014in fact, alotmore gravity. The high speed of these outer\nobjects tells us that the source of this extra gravity must extend outward from the center far beyond the Sun\u2019s\norbit.\nIf the gravity were supplied by stars or by something else that gives off radiation, we should have spotted this\nadditional outer material long ago. We are therefore forced to the reluctant conclusion that this matter is\ninvisible and has, except for its gravitational pull, gone entirely undetected.\nStudies of the motions of the most remote globular clusters and the small galaxies that orbit our own show\nthat the total mass of the Galaxy is at least 2 \u00d7 1012M , which is about twenty times greater than the amount\nSun\nof luminous matter. Moreover, thedark matter(as astronomers have come to call the invisible material)\nextends to a distance of at least 200,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy. Observations indicate that\nthis dark matter halo is almost but not quite spherical.\nThe obvious question is: what is thedark mattermade of? Let\u2019s look at a list of \u201csuspects\u201d taken from our\nstudy of astronomy so far. Since this matter is invisible, it clearly cannot be in the form of ordinary stars. And it\ncannot be gas in any form (remember that there has to be a lot of it). If it were neutral hydrogen gas, its 21-cm\nwavelength spectral-line emission would have been detected as radio waves. If it were ionized hydrogen, it\nshould be hot enough to emit visible radiation. If a lot of hydrogen atoms out there had combined into\nhydrogen molecules, these should produce dark features in the ultraviolet spectra of objects lying beyond the\nGalaxy, but such features have not been seen. Nor can the dark matter consist of interstellar dust, since in the 850 25 \u2022 The Milky Way Galaxy\nrequired quantities, the dust would significantly obscure the light from distant galaxies.\nWhat are our other possibilities? The dark matter cannot be a huge number ofblack holes (of stellar mass) or\nold neutron stars, since interstellar matter falling onto such objects would produce more X-rays than are\nobserved. Also, recall that the formation of black holes and neutron stars is preceded by a substantial amount\nof mass loss, which scatters heavy elements into space to be incorporated into subsequent generations of\nstars. If the dark matter consisted of an enormous number of any of those objects, they would have blown off\nand recycled a lot of heavier elements over the history of the Galaxy. In that case, the young stars we observe\nin our Galaxy today would contain much greater abundances of heavy elements than they actually do.\nBrown dwarfs and lone Jupiter-like planets have also been ruled out. First of all, there would have to be an\nawful lot of them to make up so much dark matter. But we have a more direct test of whether so many low-\nmass objects could actually be lurking out there. As we learned inBlack Holes and Curved Spacetime, the\ngeneral theory of relativity predicts that the path traveled by light is changed when it passes near a\nconcentration of mass. It turns out that when the two objects appear close enough together in the sky, the\nmass closer to us can bend the light from farther away. With just the right alignment, the image of the more\ndistant object also becomes significantly brighter. By looking for the temporary brightening that occurs when\na dark matter object in our own Galaxy moves across the path traveled by light from stars in the Magellanic\nClouds, astronomers have now shown that the dark matter cannot be made up of a lot of small objects with\nmasses between one-millionth and one-tenth the mass of the Sun.\nWhat\u2019s left? One possibility is that the dark matter is composed of exotic subatomic particles of a type not yet\ndetected on Earth. Very sophisticated (and difficult) experiments are now under way to look for such particles.\nStay tuned to see whether anything like that turns up.\nWe should add that the problem of dark matter is by no means confined to the Milky Way. Observations show\nthat dark matter must also be present in other galaxies (whose outer regions also orbit too fast \u201cfor their own\ngood\u201d\u2014they also have flat rotation curves). As we will see, dark matter even exists in great clusters of galaxies\nwhose members are now known to move around under the influence of far more gravity than can be\naccounted for by luminous matter alone.\nStop a moment and consider how astounding the conclusion we have reached really is. Perhaps as much as\n95% of the mass in our Galaxy (and many other galaxies) is not only invisible, but we do not even know what it\nis made of. The stars and raw material we can observe may be merely the tip of the cosmic iceberg; underlying\nit all may be other matter, perhaps familiar, perhaps startlingly new. Understanding the nature of this dark\nmatter is one of the great challenges of astronomy today; you will learn more about this inA Universe of\n(Mostly) Dark Matter and Dark Energy.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nYou can use theDark Matter Simulator(https://openstax.org/l/30darkmattsim)to explore the distribution\nof invisible dark matter in our galaxy.

Such\nmonster black holes are calledsupermassive black holesby astronomers, to indicate that the mass they\ncontain is far greater than that of the typical black hole created by the death of a single star. It is amazing that\nwe have very convincing evidence that this black hole really does exist. After all, recall from the chapter on\nBlack Holes and Curved Spacetimethat we cannot see a black hole directly because by definition it radiates no\nenergy. And we cannot even see into the center of the Galaxy in visible light because of absorption by the\ninterstellar dust that lies between us and the galactic center. Light from the central region of the Galaxy is\ndimmed by a factor of a trillion (1012) by all this dust.\nFortunately, we are not so blind at other wavelengths. Infrared and radio radiation, which have long\nwavelengths compared to the sizes of the interstellar dust grains, flow unimpeded past the dust particles and\nso reach our telescopes with hardly any dimming. In fact, the very bright radio source in the nucleus of the\nGalaxy, now known asSagittarius A*(pronounced \u201cSagittarius A-star\u201d and abbreviated Sgr A*), was the first\ncosmic radio source astronomers discovered.\nA Journey toward the Center\nLet\u2019s take a voyage to the mysterious heart of our Galaxy and see what\u2019s there.Figure 25.14is a radio image of\na region about 1500 light-years across, centered onSagittarius A, a bright radio source that contains the\nsmaller Sagittarius A*. Much of the radio emission comes from hot gas heated either by clusters of hot stars\n(the stars themselves do not produce radio emission and can\u2019t be seen in the image) or by supernova blast\nwaves. Most of the hollow circles visible on the radio image are supernova remnants. The other main source of\nradio emission is from electrons moving at high speed in regions with strong magnetic fields.

Wang et al.)\nAs we approach the center of the Galaxy, we find thesupermassive black holeSagittarius A*. There are also\nthousands of stars within a few lightyears of Sagittarius A*. Most of these are old, reddish main-sequence\nstars. But there are also about a hundred hot OB stars that must have formed within the last few million years.\nThere is as yet no good explanation for how stars could have formed recently so close to a supermassive black\nhole. Perhaps they formed in a dense cluster of stars that was originally at a larger distance from the black\nhole and subsequently migrated closer.\nThere is currently no star formation at the galactic center, but there is lots of dust and molecular gas that is\nrevolving around the black hole, along with some ionized gas streamers that are heated by the hot stars.\nFigure 25.16is a radio map that shows these gas streamers.\nFigure25.16Sagittarius A.This image, taken with the Very Large Array of radio telescopes, shows the radio emission from hot,\nionized gas in the center of the Milky Way. The lines slanting across the top of the image are gas streamers. Sagittarius A* is the\nbright spot in the lower right. (credit: modification of work by Farhad Zadeh et al. (Northwestern), VLA, NRAO)\nFinding the Heart of the Galaxy\nJust what isSagittarius A*, which lies right at the center our Galaxy? To establish that there really is ablack\nholethere, we must show that there is a very large amount of mass crammed into a very tiny volume. As we\nsaw inBlack Holes and Curved Spacetime, proving that a black hole exists is a challenge because theblack\nholeitself emits no radiation. What astronomers must do is prove that a black hole is the only possible\nexplanation for our observations\u2014that a small region contains far more mass than could be accounted for by\na very dense cluster of stars or something else made of ordinary matter.\nTo put some numbers with this discussion, the radius of the event horizon of agalactic black holewith a mass\nof about 4 millionM would be only about 17 times the size of the Sun\u2014the equivalent of a single red giant\nSun\nstar. The corresponding density within this region of space would be much higher than that of any star cluster\nor any other ordinary astronomical object. Therefore, we must measure both the diameter of Sagittarius A*\nand its mass. Both radio and infrared observations are required to give us the necessary evidence.\nFirst, let\u2019s look at how the mass can be measured. If we zero in on the inner few light-days of the Galaxy with\nan infrared telescope equipped with adaptive optics, we see a region crowded with individual stars (Figure\n25.17). These stars have now been observed for almost two decades, and astronomers have detected their 854 25 \u2022 The Milky Way Galaxy\nrapid orbital motions around the very center of the Galaxy.\nFigure25.17Near-Infrared View of the Galactic Center.This image shows the inner 1 arcsecond, or 0.13 light-year, at the center\nof the Galaxy, as observed with the giant Keck Telescope. Tracks of the orbiting stars measured from 1995 to 2014 have been added\nto this \u201csnapshot.\u201d The stars are moving around the center very fast, and their tracks are all consistent with a single massive\n\u201cgravitator\u201d that resides in the very center of this image.

Keck Observatory Laser Team)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nCheck out ananimated version(https://openstax.org/l/30anifiginfgal)ofFigure 25.17, showing the motion\nof the stars over the years.\nIf we combine observations of their periods and the size of their orbits with Kepler\u2019s third law, we can estimate\nthe mass of the object that keeps them in their orbits. One of the stars has been observed for its full orbit of\n15.6 years. Its closest approach takes it to a distance of only 124 AU or about 17 light-hours from the black\nhole. This orbit, when combined with observations of other stars close to the galactic center, indicates that a\nmass of 4.6 millionM must be concentrated inside the orbit\u2014that is, within 17 light-hours of the center of\nSun\nthe Galaxy.\nEven tighter limits on the size of the concentration of mass at the center of the Galaxy come fromradio\nastronomy, which provided the first clue that a black hole might lie at the center of the Galaxy. As matter\nspirals inward toward the event horizon of a black hole, it is heated in a whirlingaccretion diskand produces\nradio radiation. (Such accretion disks were explained inBlack Holes and Curved Spacetime.) Measurements of\nthe size of the accretion disk with the Very Long Baseline Array, which provides very high spatial resolution,\nshow that the diameter of the radio source Sagittarius A*is no larger than about 0.3 AU, or about the size of\nMercury\u2019s orbit. (In light units, that\u2019s only 2.5 light-minutes!)\nThe observations thus show that 4.6 million solar masses are crammed into a volume that has a diameter that\nis no larger than the orbit of Mercury. If this were anything other than a supermassive black hole\u2014low-mass\nstars that emit very little light or neutron stars or a very large number of small black holes\u2014 calculations show\nthat these objects would be so densely packed that they would collapse to a single black hole within a hundred\nthousand years. That is a very short time compared with the age of the Galaxy, which probably began forming\nmore than 13 billion years ago. Since it seems very unlikely that we would have caught such a complex cluster\nof objects just before it collapsed, the evidence for a supermassive black hole at the center of the Galaxy is\nAccess for free at openstax.org 25.4 \u2022 The Center of the Galaxy 855\nconvincing indeed.\nFinding the Source\nWhere did our galactic black hole come from? The origin ofsupermassive black holes in galaxies like ours is\ncurrently an active field of research. One possibility is that a large cloud of gas near the center of the Milky\nWay collapsed directly to form a black hole. Since we find large black holes at the centers of most other large\ngalaxies (seeActive Galaxies, Quasars, and Supermassive Black Holes)\u2014even ones that are very young\u2014this\ncollapse probably would have taken place when the Milky Way was just beginning to take shape. The initial\nmass of this black hole might have been only a few tens of solar masses. Another way it could have started is\nthat a massive star might have exploded to leave behind a seed black hole, or a dense cluster of stars might\nhave collapsed into a black hole.\nOnce a black hole exists at the center of a galaxy, it can grow over the next several billion years by devouring\nnearby stars and gas clouds in the crowded central regions. It can also grow by merging with other black\nholes.\nIt appears that the monster black hole at the center of our Galaxy is not finished \u201ceating.\u201d At the present time,\nwe observe clouds of gas and dust falling into the galactic center at the rate of about 1M per thousand\nSun\nyears. Stars are also on the black hole\u2019s menu. The density of stars near the galactic center is high enough that\nwe would expect a star to pass near the black hole and be swallowed by it every ten thousand years or so. As\nthis happens, some of the energy of infall is released as radiation. As a result, the center of the Galaxy might\nflare up and even briefly outshine all the stars in the Milky Way. Other objects might also venture too close to\nthe black hole and be pulled in. How great a flare we observe would depend on the mass of the object falling\nin.\nIn 2013, the Chandra X-ray satellite detected a flare from the center of our Galaxy that was 400 times brighter\nthan the usual output from Sagittarius A*. A year later, a second flare, only half as bright, was also detected.\nThis is much less energy than swallowing a whole star would produce. There are two theories to account for\nthe flares. First, an asteroid might have ventured too close to the black hole and been heated to a very high\ntemperature before being swallowed up. Alternatively, the flares might have involved interactions of the\nmagnetic fields near the galactic center in a process similar to the one described for solar flares (seeThe Sun:\nA Garden-Variety Star). Astronomers continue to monitor the galactic center area for flares or other activity.\nAlthough the monster in the center of the Galaxy is not close enough to us to represent any danger, we still\nwant to keep our eyes on it.\nVOYAGERS IN ASTRONOMY\nAndrea Ghez\nA lover of puzzles, AndreaGhezhas been pursuing one of the greatest mysteries in astronomy: what\nstrange entity lurks within the center of our Milky Way Galaxy? 856 25 \u2022 The Milky Way Galaxy\nFigure25.18Andrea Ghez.Research by Ghez and her team has helped shape our understanding of supermassive black holes.\n(credit: modification of work by John D. and Catherine T.

Once she got to do some actual observing at Kitt Peak National\nObservatory in Arizona, and later at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, Ghez had found her\ncalling.\nPursuing her graduate studies at Caltech, she stuck with physics but oriented her efforts toward\nobservational astrophysics, an area where Caltech had access to cutting-edge facilities. Though initially\nattracted to studying the black holes that were suspected of dwelling inside most massive galaxies, Ghez\nended up spending most of her graduate study and later postdoctoral research at the University of Arizona\nstudying stars in formation. By taking very high-resolution (detailed) imaging of regions where new stars\nare born, she discovered that most stars form as members of binary systems. As technologies advanced,\nshe was able to track the orbits danced by these stellar pairings and thereby could ascertain their\nrespective masses.\nNow an astronomy professor at UCLA, Ghez has since used similar high-resolution imaging techniques to\nstudy the orbits of stars in the innermost core of the Milky Way. These orbits take years to delineate, so\nGhez and her science team have logged more than 20 years of taking super-resolution infrared images with\nthe giant Keck telescopes in Hawaii. Based on the resulting stellar orbits, the UCLA Galactic Center Group\nhas settled (as we saw) on a gravitational solution that requires the presence of a supermassive black hole\nwith a mass equivalent to 4.6 million Suns\u2014all nestled within a space smaller than that occupied by our\nsolar system. Ghez\u2019s achievements have been recognized with one of the \u201cgenius\u201d awards given by the\nMacArthur Foundation. More recently, her team discovered glowing clouds of warm ionized gas that co-\norbit with the stars but may be more vulnerable to the disruptive effects of the central black hole. By\nmonitoring these clouds, the team hopes to better understand the evolution of supermassive black holes\nand their immediate environs. They also hope to test Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity by carefully\nscrutinizing the orbits of stars that careen closest to the intensely gravitating black hole.\nIn 2020, Ghez received the Nobel Prize in Physics for her work on the black hole at the center of the Galaxy.\nYou can see her explain her work in non-technical language inthis video(https://openstax.org/l/ghez).\nBesides her pioneering work as an astronomer, Ghez competes as a master swimmer, enjoys family life as a\nAccess for free at openstax.org 25.5 \u2022 Stellar Populations in the Galaxy 857\nmother of two children, and actively encourages other women to pursue scientific careers.\n25.5 Stellar Populations in the Galaxy\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDistinguish between population I and population II stars according to their locations, motions, heavy-\nelement abundances, and ages\nExplain why the oldest stars in the Galaxy are poor in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, while\nstars like the Sun and even younger stars are typically richer in these heavy elements\nIn the first section of his chapter, we described the thin disk, thick disk, and stellar halo. Look back atTable\n25.1and note some of the patterns. Young stars lie in the thin disk, are rich in metals, and orbit the Galaxy\u2019s\ncenter at high speed. The stars in the halo are old, have low abundances of elements heavier than hydrogen\nand helium, and have highly elliptical orbits randomly oriented in direction (seeFigure 25.19). Halo stars can\nplunge through the disk and central bulge, but they spend most of their time far above or below the plane of\nthe Galaxy. The stars in the thick disk are intermediate between these two extremes. Let\u2019s first see why age\nand heavier-element abundance are correlated and then see what these correlations tell us about the origin of\nour Galaxy.\nFigure25.19How Objects Orbit the Galaxy.(a) In this image, you see stars in the thin disk of our Galaxy in nearly circular orbits.\n(b) In this image, you see the motion of stars in the Galaxy\u2019s halo in randomly oriented and elliptical orbits.\nTwo Kinds of Stars\nThe discovery that there are two different kinds of stars was first made by WalterBaadeduring World War II.\nAs a German national, Baade was not allowed to do war research as many other U.S.-based scientists were\ndoing, so he was able to make regular use of the Mount Wilson telescopes in southern California. His\nobservations were aided by the darker skies that resulted from the wartime blackout of Los Angeles.\nAmong the things a large telescope and dark skies enabled Baade to examine carefully wereother\ngalaxies\u2014neighbors of our Milky Way Galaxy. We will discuss other galaxies in the next chapter (Galaxies), but\nfor now we will just mention that the nearest Galaxy that resembles our own (with a similar disk and spiral\nstructure) is often called theAndromeda galaxy, after the constellation in which we find it.\nBaade was impressed by the similarity of the mainly reddish stars in the Andromeda galaxy\u2019s nuclear bulge to\nthose in our Galaxy\u2019s globular clusters and the halo. He also noted the difference in color between all these\nand the bluer stars found in the spiral arms near the Sun (Figure 25.20). On this basis, he called the bright blue 858 25 \u2022 The Milky Way Galaxy\nstars in the spiral armspopulation Iand all the stars in the halo and globular clusterspopulation II.\nFigure25.20Andromeda Galaxy (M31).This neighboring spiral looks similar to our own Galaxy in that it is a disk galaxy with a\ncentral bulge. Note the bulge of older, yellowish stars in the center, the bluer and younger stars in the outer regions, and the dust in\nthe disk that blocks some of the light from the bulge. (credit: Adam Evans)\nWe now know that the populations differ not only in their locations in the Galaxy, but also in their chemical\ncomposition, age, and orbital motions around the center of the Galaxy. Population I stars are found only in the\ndisk and follow nearly circular orbits around the galactic center. Examples are bright supergiant stars, main-\nsequence stars of high luminosity (spectral classes O and B), which are concentrated in the spiral arms, and\nmembers of young open star clusters. Interstellar matter and molecular clouds are found in the same places\nas population I stars.\nPopulation II stars show no correlation with the location of the spiral arms. These objects are found\nthroughout the Galaxy. Some are in the disk, but many others follow eccentric elliptical orbits that carry them\nhigh above the galactic disk into the halo. Examples include stars surrounded by planetary nebulae and RR\nLyrae variable stars. The stars in globular clusters, found almost entirely in the Galaxy\u2019s halo, are also classified\nas population II.\nToday, we know much more about stellar evolution than astronomers did in the 1940s, and we can determine\nthe ages of stars. Population I includes stars with a wide range of ages. While some are as old as 10 billion\nyears, others are still forming today. For example, the Sun, which is about 5 billion years old, is a population I\nstar. But so are the massive young stars in the Orion Nebula that have formed in the last few million years.\nPopulation II, on the other hand, consists entirely of old stars that formed very early in the history of the\nGalaxy; typical ages are 11 to 13 billion years.\nWe also now have good determinations of the compositions of stars. These are based on analyses of the stars\u2019\ndetailed spectra. Nearly all stars appear to be composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, but their abundances\nof the heavier elements differ. In the Sun and other population I stars, the heavy elements (those heavier than\nhydrogen and helium) account for 1\u20134% of the total stellar mass. Population II stars in the outer galactic halo\nand in globular clusters have much lower abundances of the heavy elements\u2014often less than one-hundredth\nthe concentrations found in the Sun and in rare cases even lower. The oldest population II star discovered to\ndate has less than one ten-millionth as much iron as the Sun, for example.\nAs we discussed in earlier chapters, heavy elements are created deep within the interiors of stars. They are\nadded to the Galaxy\u2019s reserves of raw material when stars die, and their material is recycled into new\nAccess for free at openstax.org 25.6 \u2022 The Formation of the Galaxy 859\ngenerations of stars. Thus, as time goes on, stars are born with larger and larger supplies of heavy elements.\nPopulation II stars formed when the abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium was low.\nPopulation I stars formed later, after mass lost by dying members of the first generations of stars had seeded\nthe interstellar medium with elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. Some are still forming now, when\nfurther generations have added to the supply of heavier elements available to new stars.\nThe Real World\nWith rare exceptions, we should never trust any theory that divides the world into just two categories. While\nthey can provide a starting point for hypotheses and experiments, they are often oversimplifications that need\nrefinement a research continue. The idea of two populations helped organize our initial thoughts about the\nGalaxy, but we now know it cannot explain everything we observe. Even the different structures of the\nGalaxy\u2014disk, halo, central bulge\u2014are not so cleanly separated in terms of their locations, ages, and the heavy\nelement content of the stars within them.\nThe exact definition of the Galaxy\u2019s disk depends on what objects we use to define it, and, as we saw earlier, it\nhas no sharp boundary. The hottest young stars and their associated gas and dust clouds are mostly in a\nregion about 200 light-years thick. Older stars define a thicker disk that is about 2000 light-years thick. Halo\nstars spend most of their time high above or below the disk but pass through it on their highly elliptical orbits\nand so are sometimes found relatively near the Sun.\nThe highest density of stars is found in the central bulge, that bar-shaped inner region of the Galaxy. There are\na few hot, young stars in the bulge, but most of the bulge stars are more than 10 billion years old. Yet unlike\nthe halo stars of similar age, the abundance of heavy elements in the bulge stars is about the same as in the\nSun. Why would that be?\nAstronomers think that star formation in the crowded nuclear bulge occurred very rapidly just after the Milky\nWay Galaxy formed. After a few million years, the first generation of massive and short-lived stars then\nexpelled heavy elements in supernova explosions and thereby enriched subsequent generations of stars.\nThus, even stars that formed in the bulge more than 10 billion years ago started with a good supply of heavy\nelements.\nExactly the opposite occurred in theSmall Magellanic Cloud, a small galaxy near the Milky Way, visible from\nEarth\u2019s Southern Hemisphere. Even the youngest stars in this galaxy are deficient in heavy elements. We think\nthis is because the little galaxy is not especially crowded, and star formation has occurred quite slowly. As a\nresult there have been, so far, relatively few supernova explosions. Smaller galaxies also have more trouble\nholding onto the gas expelled by supernova explosions in order to recycle it. Low-mass galaxies exert only a\nmodest gravitational force, and the high-speed gas ejected by supernovae can easily escape from them.\nWhich elements a star is endowed with thus depends not only on when the star formed in the history of its\ngalaxy, but also on how many stars in its part of the galaxy had already completed their lives by the time the\nstar is ready to form.\n25.6 The Formation of the Galaxy\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the roles played by the collapse of a single cloud and mergers with other galaxies in building the\nMilky Way Galaxy we see today\nProvide examples of globular clusters and satellite galaxies affected by the Milky Way\u2019s strong gravity.\nInformation about stellar populations holds vital clues to how our Galaxy was built up over time. The flattened\ndisk shape of the Galaxy suggests that it formed through a process similar to the one that leads to the\nformation of a protostar (seeThe Birth of Stars and the Discovery of Planets outside the Solar System). 860 25 \u2022 The Milky Way Galaxy\nBuilding on this idea, astronomers first developed models that assumed the Galaxy formed from a single\nrotating cloud. But, as we shall see, this turns out to be only part of the story.\nThe Protogalactic Cloud and the Monolithic Collapse Model\nBecause the oldest stars\u2014those in the halo and in globular clusters\u2014are distributed in a sphere centered on\nthe nucleus of the Galaxy, it makes sense to assume that theprotogalacticcloud that gave birth to our Galaxy\nwas roughly spherical. The oldest stars in the halo have ages of 12 to 13 billion years, so we estimate that the\nformation of the Galaxy began about that long ago. (See the chapter onThe Big Bangfor other evidence that\ngalaxies in general began forming a little more than 13 billion years ago.) Then, just as in the case of star\nformation, theprotogalactic cloudcollapsed and formed a thin rotating disk. Stars born before the cloud\ncollapsed did not participate in the collapse, but have continued to orbit in the halo to the present day (Figure\n25.21).\nFigure25.21Monolithic Collapse Model for the Formation of the Galaxy.According to this model, the Milky Way Galaxy initially\nformed from a rotating cloud of gas that collapsed due to gravity. Halo stars and globular clusters either formed prior to the collapse\nor were formed elsewhere. Stars in the disk formed later, when the gas from which they were made was already \u201ccontaminated\u201d\nwith heavy elements produced in earlier generations of stars.\nGravitational forces caused the gas in the thin disk to fragment into clouds or clumps with masses like those of\nstar clusters. These individual clouds then fragmented further to form stars. Since the oldest stars in the disk\nare nearly as old as the youngest stars in the halo, the collapse must have been rapid (astronomically\nspeaking), requiring perhaps no more than a few hundred million years.\nCollision Victims and the Multiple Merger Model\nIn past decades, astronomers have learned that the evolution of the Galaxy has not been quite as peaceful as\nthis monolithic collapse model suggests. In 1994, astronomers discovered a small new galaxy in the direction\nof the constellation of Sagittarius. The Sagittarius dwarf galaxy is currently about 70,000 light-years away from\nAccess for free at openstax.org 25.6 \u2022 The Formation of the Galaxy 861\nEarth and 50,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy. It is the closest galaxy known (Figure 25.22). It is\nvery elongated, and its shape indicates that it is being torn apart by our Galaxy\u2019s gravitational tides\u2014just as\nComet Shoemaker-Levy 9 was torn apart when it passed too close to Jupiter in 1992.\nThe Sagittarius galaxy is much smaller than the Milky Way and is about 10,000 times less massive than our\nGalaxy. All of the stars in the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy seem destined to end up in the bulge and halo of the\nMilky Way. But don\u2019t sound the funeral bells for the little galaxy quite yet; the ingestion of the Sagittarius\ndwarf will take another 100 million years or so, and the stars themselves will survive.\nFigure25.22Sagittarius Dwarf.In 1994, British astronomers discovered a galaxy in the constellation of Sagittarius, located only\nabout 50,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way and falling into our Galaxy. This image covers a region approximately 70\u00b0 \u00d7\n50\u00b0 and combines a black-and-white view of the disk of our Galaxy with a red contour map showing the brightness of the dwarf\ngalaxy. The dwarf galaxy lies on the other side of the galactic center from us. The white stars in the red region mark the locations of\nseveral globular clusters contained within the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. The cross marks the galactic center. The horizontal line\ncorresponds to the galactic plane. The blue outline on either side of the galactic plane corresponds to the infrared image inFigure\n25.7. The boxes mark regions where detailed studies of individual stars led to the discovery of this galaxy. (credit: modification of\nwork by R. Ibata (UBC), R. Wyse (JHU), R. Sword (IoA))\nSince that discovery, evidence has been found for many more close encounters between our Galaxy and other\nneighbor galaxies. When a small galaxy ventures too close, the force of gravity exerted by our Galaxy tugs\nharder on the near side than on the far side. The net effect is that the stars that originally belonged to the\nsmall galaxy are spread out into a long stream that orbits through the halo of the Milky Way (Figure 25.23). 862 25 \u2022 The Milky Way Galaxy\nFigure25.23Streams in the Galactic Halo.When a small galaxy is swallowed by the Milky Way, its member stars are stripped away\nand form streams of stars in the galactic halo. This image is based on calculations of what some of these tidal streams might look\nlike if the Milky Way swallowed 50 dwarf galaxies over the past 10 billion years. (credit: modification of work by NASA/JPL-Caltech/R.\nHurt (SSC/Caltech))\nSuch a tidal stream can maintain its identity for billions of years. To date, astronomers have now identified\nstreams originating from 12 small galaxies that ventured too close to the much larger Milky Way. Six more\nstreams are associated with globular clusters. It has been suggested that large globular clusters, like Omega\nCentauri, are actually dense nuclei of cannibalized dwarf galaxies. The globular cluster M54 is now thought to\nbe the nucleus of the Sagittarius dwarf we discussed earlier, which is currently merging with the Milky Way\n(Figure 25.24). The stars in the outer regions of such galaxies are stripped off by the gravitational pull of the\nMilky Way, but the central dense regions may survive.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 25.6 \u2022 The Formation of the Galaxy 863\nFigure25.24Globular Cluster M54.This beautiful Hubble Space Telescope image shows the globular cluster that is now believed to\nbe the nucleus of the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy. (credit: ESA/Hubble & NASA)\nCalculations indicate that the Galaxy\u2019s thick disk may be a product of one or more suchcollisionswith other\ngalaxies. Accretion of a satellite galaxy would stir up the orbits of the stars and gas clouds originally in the thin\ndisk and cause them to move higher above and below the mid-plane of the Galaxy. Meanwhile, the Galaxy\u2019s\nstars would add to the fluffed-up mix. If such a collision happened about 10 billion years ago, then any gas in\nthe two galaxies that had not yet formed into stars would have had plenty of time to settle back down into the\nthin disk. The gas could then have begun forming subsequent generations of population I stars. This timing is\nalso consistent with the typical ages of stars in the thick disk.\nThe Milky Way has more collisions in store. An example is the Canis Major dwarf galaxy, which has a mass of\nabout 1% of the mass of the Milky Way. Already long tidal tails have been stripped from this galaxy, which have\nwrapped themselves around the Milky Way three times. Several of the globular clusters found in the Milky Way\nmay also have come from the Canis Major dwarf, which is expected to merge gradually with the Milky Way\nover about the next billion years.\nIn about 4 billion years, the Milky Way itself will be swallowed up, since it and theAndromeda galaxyare on a\ncollision course. Our computer models show that after a complex interaction, the two will merge to form a\nlarger, more rounded galaxy (Figure 25.25). 864 25 \u2022 The Milky Way Galaxy\nFigure25.25Collision of the Milky Way with Andromeda.In about 3 billion years, theMilky Way GalaxyandAndromeda Galaxy\nwill begin a long process of colliding, separating, and then coming back together to form an elliptical galaxy. The whole interaction\nwill take 3 to 4 billion years. These computer-simulated images show the following sequence: (1) In 3.75 billion years, Andromeda\nhas approached the Milky Way. (2) New star formation fills the sky 3.85 billion years from now. (3) Star formation continues at 3.9\nbillion years. (4) The galaxy shapes change as they interact, with Andromeda being stretched and our Galaxy becoming warped,\nabout 4 billion years from now. (5) In 5.1 billion years, the cores of the two galaxies are bright lobes. (6) In 7 billion years, the merged\ngalaxies form a huge elliptical galaxy whose brightness fills the night sky. This artist\u2019s illustrations show events from a vantage point\n25,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way. However, we should mention that the Sun may not be at that distance\nthroughout the sequence of events, as the collision readjusts the orbits of many stars within each galaxy. (credit: NASA; ESA; Z.\nLevay, R. van der Marel, STScl; T. Hallas, and A. Mellinger)\nWe are thus coming to realize that \u201cenvironmental influences\u201d (and not just a galaxy\u2019s original characteristics)\nplay an important role in determining the properties and development of our Galaxy. In future chapters we\nwill see that collisions and mergers are a major factor in the evolution of many other galaxies as well.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 25 \u2022 Key Terms 865\nKey Terms\ncentral bulge (or nuclear bulge) the central (round) part of the Milky Way or a similar galaxy\ndark matter nonluminous mass, whose presence can be inferred only because of its gravitational influence\non luminous matter; the composition of the dark matter is not known\ndark matter halo the mass in the Milky Way that extends well beyond the boundary of the luminous stars to\na distance of at least 200,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy; although we deduce its existence\nfrom its gravity, the composition of this matter remains a mystery\ndifferential galactic rotation the idea that different parts of the Galaxy turn at different rates, since the\nparts of the Galaxy follow Kepler\u2019s third law: more distant objects take longer to complete one full orbit\naround the center of the Galaxy\nhalo the outermost extent of our Galaxy (or another galaxy), containing a sparse distribution of stars and\nglobular clusters in a more or less spherical distribution\nMilky Way Galaxy the band of light encircling the sky, which is due to the many stars and diffuse nebulae\nlying near the plane of the Milky Way Galaxy\npopulation I star a star containing heavy elements; typically young and found in the disk\npopulation II star a star with very low abundance of heavy elements; found throughout the Galaxy\nspiral arm a spiral-shaped region, characterized by relatively dense interstellar material and young stars,\nthat is observed in the disks of spiral galaxies\nsupermassive black hole the object in the center of most large galaxies that is so massive and compact that\nlight cannot escape from it; the Milky Way\u2019s supermassive black hole contains 4.6 millions of Suns\u2019 worth of\nmass\nSummary\n25.1The Architecture of the Galaxy\nThe Milky Way Galaxy consists of a thin disk containing dust, gas, and young and old stars; a spherical halo\ncontaining populations of very old stars, including RR Lyrae variable stars and globular star clusters; a thick,\nmore diffuse disk with stars that have properties intermediate between those in the thin disk and the halo; a\npeanut-shaped nuclear bulge of mostly old stars around the center; and a supermassive black hole at the very\ncenter. The Sun is located roughly halfway out of the Milky Way, about 26,000 light-years from the center.\n25.2Spiral Structure\nThe gaseous distribution in the Galaxy\u2019s disk has two main spiral arms that emerge from the ends of the\ncentral bar, along with several fainter arms and short spurs; the Sun is located in one of those spurs.\nMeasurements show that the Galaxy does not rotate as a solid body, but instead its stars and gas follow\ndifferential rotation, such that the material closer to the galactic center completes its orbit more quickly.\nObservations show that galaxies like the Milky Way take several billion years after they began to form to\ndevelop spiral structure.\n25.3The Mass of the Galaxy\nThe Sun revolves completely around the galactic center in about 225 million years (a galactic year). The mass\nof the Galaxy can be determined by measuring the orbital velocities of stars and interstellar matter. The total\nmass of the Galaxy is about 2 \u00d7 1012M As much as 95% of this mass consists of dark matter that emits no\nSun.\nelectromagnetic radiation and can be detected only because of the gravitational force it exerts on visible stars\nand interstellar matter. This dark matter is located mostly in the Galaxy\u2019s halo; its nature is not well\nunderstood at present.\n25.4The Center of the Galaxy\nA supermassive black hole is located at the center of the Galaxy. Measurements of the velocities of stars 866 25 \u2022 For Further Exploration\nlocated within a few light-days of the center show that the mass inside their orbits around the center is about\n4.6 millionM . Radio observations show that this mass is concentrated in a volume with a diameter similar to\nSun\nthat of Mercury\u2019s orbit. The density of this matter concentration exceeds that of the densest known star\nclusters by a factor of nearly a million. The only known object with such a high density and total mass is a black\nhole.\n25.5Stellar Populations in the Galaxy\nWe can roughly divide the stars in the Galaxy into two categories. Old stars with few heavy elements are\nreferred to as population II stars and are found in the halo and in globular clusters. Population I stars contain\nmore heavy elements than globular cluster and halo stars, are typically younger and found in the disk, and are\nespecially concentrated in the spiral arms. The Sun is a member of population I. Population I stars formed\nafter previous generations of stars had produced heavy elements and ejected them into the interstellar\nmedium. The bulge stars, most of which are more than 10 billion years old, have unusually high amounts of\nheavy elements, presumably because there were many massive first-generation stars in this dense region, and\nthese quickly seeded the next generations of stars with heavier elements.\n25.6The Formation of the Galaxy\nThe Galaxy began forming a little more than 13 billion years ago. Models suggest that the stars in the halo and\nglobular clusters formed first, while the Galaxy was spherical. The gas, somewhat enriched in heavy elements\nby the first generation of stars, then collapsed from a spherical distribution to a rotating disk-shaped\ndistribution. Stars are still forming today from the gas and dust that remain in the disk. Star formation occurs\nmost rapidly in the spiral arms, where the density of interstellar matter is highest. The Galaxy captured (and\nstill is capturing) additional stars and globular clusters from small galaxies that ventured too close to the Milky\nWay. In 3 to 4 billion years, the Galaxy will begin to collide with the Andromeda galaxy, and after about 7 billion\nyears, the two galaxies will merge to form a giant elliptical galaxy.\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nBlitz, L. \u201cThe Dark Side of the Milky Way.\u201dScientific American(October 2011): 36\u201343.

You are captured by space aliens, who take you inside a complex cloud of interstellar gas, dust, and a few\nnewly formed stars. To escape, you need to make a map of the cloud. Luckily, the aliens have a complete\nastronomical observatory with equipment for measuring all the bands of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nUsing what you have learned in this chapter, have your group discuss what kinds of maps you would make\nof the cloud to plot your most effective escape route.\nB. The diagram that Herschel made of the Milky Way has a very irregular outer boundary (seeFigure 25.3).\nCan your group think of a reason for this? How did Herschel construct his map?\nC. Suppose that for your final exam in this course, your group is assigned telescope time to observe a star\nselected for you by your professor. The professor tells you the position of the star in the sky (its right\nascension and declination) but nothing else. You can make any observations you wish. How would you go\nabout determining whether the star is a member of population I or population II?\nD. The existence of dark matter comes as a great surprise, and its nature remains a mystery today. Someday\nastronomers will know a lot more about it (you can learn more about current findings inThe Evolution and\nDistribution of Galaxies). Can your group make a list of earlier astronomical observations that began as a\nsurprise and mystery, but wound up (with more observations) as well-understood parts of introductory\ntextbooks?\nE. Physicist Gregory Benford has written a series of science fiction novels that take place near the center of\nthe Milky Way Galaxy in the far future. Suppose your group were writing such a story. Make a list of ways\nthat the environment near the galactic center differs from the environment in the \u201cgalactic suburbs,\u201d\nwhere the Sun is located. Would life as we know it have an easier or harder time surviving on planets that\norbit stars near the center (and why)?\nF. These days, in most urban areas, city lights completely swamp the faint light of the Milky Way in our skies.\nHave each member of your group survey 5 to 10 friends or relatives (you could spread out on campus to\ninvestigate or use social media or the phone), explaining what the Milky Way is and then asking if they\nhave seen it. Also ask their age. Report back to your group and discuss your reactions to the survey. Is\nthere any relationship between a person\u2019s age and whether they have seen the Milky Way? How\nimportant is it that many kids growing up on Earth today never (or rarely) get to see our home Galaxy in\nthe sky?\nExercises\nReview Questions\n1. Explain why we see the Milky Way as a faint band of light stretching across the sky.\n2. Explain where in a spiral galaxy you would expect to find globular clusters, molecular clouds, and atomic\nhydrogen.\n3. Describe several characteristics that distinguish population I stars from population II stars.\n4. Briefly describe the main parts of our Galaxy.\n5.

Explain why the abundances of heavy elements in stars correlate with their positions in the Galaxy.\n7. What will be the long-term future of our Galaxy?\nThought Questions\n8. Suppose the Milky Way was a band of light extending only halfway around the sky (that is, in a semicircle).\nWhat, then, would you conclude about the Sun\u2019s location in the Galaxy? Give your reasoning.\n9. Suppose somebody proposed that rather than invoking dark matter to explain the increased orbital\nvelocities of stars beyond the Sun\u2019s orbit, the problem could be solved by assuming that the Milky Way\u2019s\ncentral black hole was much more massive. Does simply increasing the assumed mass of the Milky Way\u2019s\ncentral supermassive black hole correctly resolve the issue of unexpectedly high orbital velocities in the\nGalaxy? Why or why not?\n10. The globular clusters revolve around the Galaxy in highly elliptical orbits. Where would you expect the\nclusters to spend most of their time? (Think of Kepler\u2019s laws.) At any given time, would you expect most\nglobular clusters to be moving at high or low speeds with respect to the center of the Galaxy? Why?\n11. Shapley used the positions of globular clusters to determine the location of the galactic center. Could he\nhave used open clusters? Why or why not?\n12. Consider the following five kinds of objects: open cluster, giant molecular cloud, globular cluster, group of\nO and B stars, and planetary nebulae.\nA. Which occur only in spiral arms?\nB. Which occur only in the parts of the Galaxy other than the spiral arms?\nC. Which are thought to be very young?\nD. Which are thought to be very old?\nE. Which have the hottest stars?\n13. The dwarf galaxy in Sagittarius is the one closest to the Milky Way, yet it was discovered only in 1994. Can\nyou think of a reason it was not discovered earlier? (Hint: Think about what else is in its constellation.)\n14. Suppose three stars lie in the disk of the Galaxy at distances of 20,000 light-years, 25,000 light-years, and\n30,000 light-years from the galactic center, and suppose that right now all three are lined up in such a way\nthat it is possible to draw a straight line through them and on to the center of the Galaxy. How will the\nrelative positions of these three stars change with time? Assume that their orbits are all circular and lie in\nthe plane of the disk.\n15. Why does star formation occur primarily in the disk of the Galaxy?\n16. Where in the Galaxy would you expect to find Type II supernovae, which are the explosions of massive\nstars that go through their lives very quickly? Where would you expect to find Type I supernovae, which\ninvolve the explosions of white dwarfs?\n17. Suppose that stars evolved without losing mass\u2014that once matter was incorporated into a star, it\nremained there forever. How would the appearance of the Galaxy be different from what it is now? Would\nthere be population I and population II stars? What other differences would there be? 870 25 \u2022 Exercises\nFiguring for Yourself\n18. Assume that the Sun orbits the center of the Galaxy at a speed of 220 km/s and a distance of 26,000 light-\nyears from the center.\nA. Calculate the circumference of the Sun\u2019s orbit, assuming it to be approximately circular. (Remember that\nthe circumference of a circle is given by 2\u03c0R, whereRis the radius of the circle. Be sure to use consistent\nunits. The conversion from light-years to km/s can be found in an online calculator or appendix, or you\ncan calculate it for yourself: the speed of light is 300,000 km/s, and you can determine the number of\nseconds in a year.)\nB. Calculate the Sun\u2019s period, the \u201cgalactic year.\u201d Again, be careful with the units. Does it agree with the\nnumber we gave above?\n19. The Sun orbits the center of the Galaxy in 225 million years at a distance of 26,000 light-years. Given that\nwhereais the semimajor axis andPis the orbital period, what is the mass of the\nGalaxy within the Sun\u2019s orbit?\n20. Suppose the Sun orbited a little farther out, but the mass of the Galaxy inside its orbit remained the same\nas we calculated inExercise 25.19. What would be its period at a distance of 30,000 light-years?\n21. We have said that the Galaxy rotates differentially; that is, stars in the inner parts complete a full 360\u00b0\norbit around the center of the Galaxy more rapidly than stars farther out. Use Kepler\u2019s third law and the\nmass we derived inExercise 25.19to calculate the period of a star that is only 5000 light-years from the\ncenter. Now do the same calculation for a globular cluster at a distance of 50,000 light-years. Suppose the\nSun, this star, and the globular cluster all fall on a straight line through the center of the Galaxy. Where\nwill they be relative to each other after the Sun completes one full journey around the center of the\nGalaxy? (Assume that all the mass in the Galaxy is concentrated at its center.)\n22. If our solar system is 4.6 billion years old, how many galactic years has planet Earth been around?\n23. Suppose the average mass of a star in the Galaxy is one-third of a solar mass. Use the value for the mass\nof the Galaxy that we calculated inExercise 25.19, and estimate how many stars are in the Milky Way. Give\nsome reasons it is reasonable to assume that the mass of an average star is less than the mass of the Sun.\n24. The first clue that the Galaxy contains a lot of dark matter was the observation that the orbital velocities of\nstars did not decreases with increasing distance from the center of the Galaxy. Construct a rotation curve\nfor the solar system by using the orbital velocities of the planets, which can be found inAppendix F. How\ndoes this curve differ from the rotation curve for the Galaxy? What does it tell you about where most of\nthe mass in the solar system is concentrated?\n25. The best evidence for a black hole at the center of the Galaxy also comes from the application of Kepler\u2019s\nthird law. Suppose a star at a distance of 20 light-hours from the center of the Galaxy has an orbital speed\nof 6200 km/s. How much mass must be located inside its orbit?\n26. The next step in deciding whether the object inExercise 25.25is a black hole is to estimate the density of\nthis mass. Assume that all of the mass is spread uniformly throughout a sphere with a radius of 20 light-\nhours. What is the density in kg/km3? (Remember that the volume of a sphere is given by .)\nExplain why the density might be even higher than the value you have calculated. How does this density\ncompare with that of the Sun or other objects we have talked about in this book?\n27. Suppose the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy merges completely with the Milky Way and adds 150,000 stars to it.\nEstimate the percentage change in the mass of the Milky Way. Will this be enough mass to affect the orbit\nof the Sun around the galactic center? Assume that all of the Sagittarius galaxy\u2019s stars end up in the\nnuclear bulge of the Milky Way Galaxy and explain your answer.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 26 \u2022 Thinking Ahead 871\n26\nGalaxies\nFigure26.1Spiral Galaxy.NGC 6946 is a spiral galaxy also known as the \u201cFireworks galaxy.\u201d It is at a distance of about 18 million\nlight-years, in the direction of the constellations Cepheus and Cygnus. It was discovered by William Herschel in 1798. This galaxy is\nabout one-third the size of the Milky Way. Note on the left how the colors of the galaxy change from the yellowish light of old stars in\nthe center to the blue color of hot, young stars and the reddish glow of hydrogen clouds in the spiral arms. As the image shows, this\ngalaxy is rich in dust and gas, and new stars are still being born here. In the right-hand image, the x-rays coming from this galaxy are\nshown in purple, which has been added to other colors showing visible light.

But is it the only one? If there are others, are they like the\nMilky Way? How far away are they? Can we see them? As we shall learn, some galaxies turn out to be so far\naway that it has taken billions of years for their light to reach us. These remote galaxies can tell us what the\nuniverse was like when it was young.\nIn this chapter, we start our exploration of the vast realm of galaxies. Like tourists from a small town making\ntheir first visit to the great cities of the world, we will be awed by the beauty and variety of the galaxies. And\nyet, we will recognize that much of what we see is not so different from our experiences at home, and we will\nbe impressed by how much we can learn by looking at structures built long ago.\nWe begin our voyage with a guide to the properties of galaxies, much as a tourist begins with a guidebook to\nthe main features of the cities on the itinerary. In later chapters, we will look more carefully at the past history\nof galaxies, how they have changed over time, and how they acquired their many different forms. First, we\u2019ll\nbegin our voyage through the galaxies with the question: is our Galaxy the only one? 872 26 \u2022 Galaxies\n26.1 The Discovery of Galaxies\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the discoveries that confirmed the existence of galaxies that lie far beyond the Milky Way Galaxy\nExplain why galaxies used to be called nebulae and why we don\u2019t include them in that category any more\nGrowing up at a time when the Hubble Space Telescope orbits above our heads and giant telescopes are\nspringing up on the great mountaintops of the world, you may be surprised to learn that we were not sure\nabout the existence of othergalaxiesfor a very long time. The very idea that other galaxies exist used to be\ncontroversial. Even into the 1920s, many astronomers thought the Milky Way encompassedallthat exists in\nthe universe. The evidence found in 1924 that meant our Galaxy is not alone was one of the great scientific\ndiscoveries of the twentieth century.\nIt was not that scientists weren\u2019t asking questions. They questioned the composition and structure of the\nuniverse as early as the eighteenth century. However, with the telescopes available in earlier centuries,\ngalaxies looked like small fuzzy patches of light that were difficult to distinguish from the star clusters and gas-\nand-dust clouds that are part of our own Galaxy. All objects that were not sharp points of light were given the\nsame name,nebulae, the Latin word for \u201cclouds.\u201d Because their precise shapes were often hard to make out\nand no techniques had yet been devised for measuring their distances, the nature of the nebulae was the\nsubject of much debate.\nAs early as the eighteenth century, the philosopher ImmanuelKant(1724\u20131804) suggested that some of the\nnebulae might be distant systems of stars (other Milky Ways), but the evidence to support this suggestion was\nbeyond the capabilities of the telescopes of that time.\nOther Galaxies\nBy the early twentieth century, some nebulae had been correctly identified as star clusters, and others (such as\nthe Orion Nebula) as gaseous nebulae. Most nebulae, however, looked faint and indistinct, even with the best\ntelescopes, and their distances remained unknown. (For more on how such nebulae are named, by the way,\nsee the feature box onNaming the Nebulaein the chapter on interstellar matter.) If these nebulae were\nnearby, with distances comparable to those of observable stars, they were most likely clouds of gas or groups\nof stars within our Galaxy. If, on the other hand, they were remote, far beyond the edge of the Galaxy, they\ncould be other star systems containing billions of stars.\nTo determine what the nebulae are, astronomers had to find a way of measuring the distances to at least\nsome of them. When the 2.5-meter (100-inch) telescope on Mount Wilson in Southern California went into\noperation, astronomers finally had the large telescope they needed to settle the controversy.\nWorking with the 2.5-meter telescope, EdwinHubblewas able to resolve individual stars in several of the\nbrighter spiral-shaped nebulae, including M31, the great spiral in Andromeda (Figure 26.2). Among these stars,\nhe discovered some faint variable stars that\u2014when he analyzed their light curves\u2014turned out to be cepheids.\nHere were reliable indicators that Hubble could use to measure the distances to the nebulae using the\ntechnique pioneered by HenriettaLeavitt(see the chapter onCelestial Distances). After painstaking work, he\nestimated that the Andromeda galaxy was about 900,000 light-years away from us. At that enormous distance,\nit had to be a separate galaxy of stars located well outside the boundaries of the Milky Way. Today, we know\nthe Andromeda galaxy is actually slightly more than twice as distant as Hubble\u2019s first estimate, but his\nconclusion about its true nature remains unchanged.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 26.1 \u2022 The Discovery of Galaxies 873\nFigure26.2Andromeda Galaxy.Also known by its catalog number M31, the Andromeda galaxy is a large spiral galaxy very similar\nin appearance to, and slightly larger than, our own Galaxy. At a distance of about 2.5 million light-years, Andromeda is the spiral\ngalaxy that is nearest to our own in space. Here, it is seen with two of its satellite galaxies, M32 (top) and M110 (bottom). (credit:\nAdam Evans)\nNo one in human history had ever measured a distance so great. When Hubble\u2019s paper on the distances to\nnebulae was read before a meeting of the American Astronomical Society on the first day of 1925, the entire\nroom erupted in a standing ovation. A new era had begun in the study of the universe, and a new scientific\nfield\u2014extragalactic astronomy\u2014had just been born.\nVOYAGERS IN ASTRONOMY\nEdwin Hubble: Expanding the Universe\nThe son of a Missouri insurance agent, EdwinHubble(Figure 26.3) graduated from high school at age 16.\nHe excelled in sports, winning letters in track and basketball at the University of Chicago, where he studied\nboth science and languages. Both his father and grandfather wanted him to study law, however, and he\ngave in to family pressure. He received a prestigious Rhodes scholarship to Oxford University in England,\nwhere he studied law with only middling enthusiasm. Returning to be the United States, he spent a year\nteaching high school physics and Spanish as well as coaching basketball, while trying to determine his life\u2019s\ndirection. 874 26 \u2022 Galaxies\nFigure26.3Edwin Hubble (1889\u20131953).Edwin Hubble established some of the most important ideas in the study of galaxies.\nThe pull of astronomy eventually proved too strong to resist, and so Hubble went back to the University of\nChicago for graduate work. Just as he was about to finish his degree and accept an offer to work at the\nsoon-to-be-completed 2.5-meter telescope, the United States entered World War I, and Hubble enlisted as\nan officer. Although the war had ended by the time he arrived in Europe, he received more officer\u2019s training\nabroad and enjoyed a brief time of further astronomical study at Cambridge before being sent home.\nIn 1919, at age 30, he joined the staff at Mount Wilson and began working with the world\u2019s largest\ntelescope. Ripened by experience, energetic, disciplined, and a skillful observer, Hubble soon established\nsome of the most important ideas in modern astronomy. He showed that other galaxies existed, classified\nthem on the basis of their shapes, found a pattern to their motion (and thus put the notion of an expanding\nuniverse on a firm observational footing), and began a lifelong program to study the distribution of\ngalaxies in the universe. Although a few others had glimpsed pieces of the puzzle, it was Hubble who put it\nall together and showed that an understanding of the large-scale structure of the universe was feasible.\nHis work brought Hubble much renown and many medals, awards, and honorary degrees. As he became\nbetter known (he was the first astronomer to appear on the cover ofTimemagazine), he and his wife\nenjoyed and cultivated friendships with movie stars and writers in Southern California. Hubble was\ninstrumental (if you\u2019ll pardon the pun) in the planning and building of the 5-meter telescope on Palomar\nMountain, and he had begun to use it for studying galaxies when he passed away from a stroke in 1953.\nWhen astronomers built a space telescope that would allow them to extend Hubble\u2019s work to distances he\ncould only dream about, it seemed natural to name it in his honor. It was fitting that observations with the\nHubble Space Telescope (and his foundational work on expansion of the universe) contributed to the 2011\nNobel Prize in Physics, given for the discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating (a topic we\nwill expand upon in the chapter onThe Big Bang).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 26.2 \u2022 Types of Galaxies 875\n26.2 Types of Galaxies\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the properties and features of elliptical, spiral, and irregular galaxies\nExplain what may cause a galaxy\u2019s appearance to change over time\nHaving established the existence of othergalaxies, Hubble and others began to observe them more\nclosely\u2014noting their shapes, their contents, and as many other properties as they could measure. This was a\ndaunting task in the 1920s when obtaining a single photograph or spectrum of a galaxy could take a full night\nof tireless observing. Today, larger telescopes and electronic detectors have made this task less difficult,\nalthough observing the most distant galaxies (those that show us the universe in its earliest phases) still\nrequires enormous effort.\nThe first step in trying to understand a new type of object is often simply to describe it. Remember, the first\nstep in understanding stellar spectra was simply to sort them according to appearance (seeAnalyzing\nStarlight). As it turns out, the biggest and most luminous galaxies come in one of two basic shapes: either they\nare flatter and have spiral arms, like our own Galaxy, or they appear to be elliptical (blimp- or cigar-shaped).\nMany smaller galaxies, in contrast, have an irregular shape.\nSpiral Galaxies\nOur own Galaxy and theAndromeda galaxyare typical, largespiral galaxies(seeFigure 26.2). They consist of\na central bulge, a halo, a disk, and spiral arms. Interstellar material is usually spread throughout the disks of\nspiral galaxies. Bright emission nebulae and hot, young stars are present, especially in the spiral arms,\nshowing that new star formation is still occurring. The disks are often dusty, which is especially noticeable in\nthose systems that we view almost edge on (Figure 26.4).\nFigure26.4Spiral Galaxies.(a) The spiral arms of M100, shown here, are bluer than the rest of the galaxy, indicating young, high-\nmass stars and star-forming regions. (b) We view this spiral galaxy, NGC 4565, almost exactly edge on, and from this angle, we can\nsee the dust in the plane of the galaxy; it appears dark because it absorbs the light from the stars in the galaxy. (credit a:\nmodification of work by Hubble Legacy Archive, NASA, ESA, and Judy Schmidt; credit b: modification of work by \u201cJschulman555\u201d/\nWikimedia)\nIn galaxies that we see face on, the bright stars and emission nebulae make the arms of spirals stand out like\nthose of a pinwheel on the fourth of July. Open star clusters can be seen in the arms of nearer spirals, and\nglobular clusters are often visible in their halos. Spiral galaxies contain a mixture of young and old stars, just\nas the Milky Way does. All spirals rotate, and the direction of their spin is such that the arms appear to trail\nmuch like the wake of a boat. 876 26 \u2022 Galaxies\nAbout two-thirds of the nearby spiral galaxies have boxy or peanut-shaped bars of stars running through their\ncenters (Figure 26.5). Showing great originality, astronomers call these galaxies barred spirals.\nFigure26.5Barred Spiral Galaxy.NGC 1300, shown here, is a barred spiral galaxy. Note that the spiral arms begin at the ends of the\nbar. (credit: NASA, ESA, and the Hubble Heritage Team(STScI/AURA))\nAs we noted inThe Milky Way Galaxychapter, our Galaxy has a modest bar too (seeFigure 25.10). The spiral\narms usually begin from the ends of the bar. The fact that bars are so common suggests that they are long\nlived; it may be that most spiral galaxies form a bar at some point during their evolution.\nIn both barred and unbarred spiral galaxies, we observe a range of different shapes. At one extreme, the\ncentral bulge is large and luminous, the arms are faint and tightly coiled, and bright emission nebulae and\nsupergiant stars are inconspicuous. Hubble, who developed a system of classifying galaxies by shape, gave\nthese galaxies the designation Sa. Galaxies at this extreme may have no clear spiral arm structure, resulting in\na lens-like appearance (they are sometimes referred to as lenticular galaxies). These galaxies seem to share as\nmany properties with elliptical galaxies as they do with spiral galaxies\nAt the other extreme, the central bulge is small and the arms are loosely wound. In these Sc galaxies, luminous\nstars and emission nebulae are very prominent. Our Galaxy and the Andromeda galaxy are both intermediate\nbetween the two extremes. Photographs ofspiral galaxies, illustrating the different types, are shown inFigure\n26.6, along with elliptical galaxies for comparison.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 26.2 \u2022 Types of Galaxies 877\nFigure26.6Hubble Classification of Galaxies.This figure shows Edwin Hubble\u2019s original classification of galaxies. Elliptical galaxies\nare on the left. On the right, you can see the basic spiral shapes illustrated, alongside images of actual barred and unbarred spirals.\n(credit: modification of work by NASA, ESA)\nThe luminous parts of spiral galaxies appear to range in diameter from about 20,000 to more than 100,000\nlight-years. Recent studies have found that there is probably a large amount of galactic material that extends\nwell beyond the apparent edge of galaxies. This material appears to be thin, cold gas that is difficult to detect\nin most observations.\nFrom the observational data available, the masses of the visible portions of spiral galaxies are estimated to\nrange from 1 billion to 1 trillion Suns (109to 1012M ). The total luminosities of most spirals fall in the range\nSun\nof 100 million to 100 billion times the luminosity of our Sun (108to 1011L ). Our Galaxy and M31 are relatively\nSun\nlarge and massive, as spirals go. There is also considerabledark matterin and around the galaxies, just as\nthere is in the Milky Way; we deduce its presence from how fast stars in the outer parts of the Galaxy are\nmoving in their orbits.\nElliptical Galaxies\nElliptical galaxiesconsist almost entirely of old stars and have shapes that are spheres or ellipsoids\n(somewhat squashed spheres) (Figure 26.7). They contain no trace of spiral arms. Their light is dominated by\nolder reddish stars (the population II stars discussed inThe Milky Way Galaxy). In the larger nearby ellipticals,\nmany globular clusters can be identified. Dust and emission nebulae are not conspicuous in elliptical galaxies,\nbut many do contain a small amount of interstellar matter. 878 26 \u2022 Galaxies\nFigure26.7Elliptical Galaxies.(a) ESO 325-G004 is a giant elliptical galaxy. Other elliptical galaxies can be seen around the edges of\nthis image. (b) This elliptical galaxy probably originated from the collision of two spiral galaxies. (credit a: modification of work by\nNASA, ESA, and The Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA); credit b: modification of work by ESA/Hubble, NASA)\nElliptical galaxies show various degrees of flattening, ranging from systems that are approximately spherical to\nthose that approach the flatness of spirals. The rare giant ellipticals (for example, ESO 325-G004 inFigure 26.7)\nreach luminosities of 1011L . The mass in a giant elliptical can be as large as 1013M . The diameters of\nSun Sun\nthese large galaxies extend over several hundred thousand light-years and are considerably larger than the\nlargest spirals. Although individual stars orbit the center of an elliptical galaxy, the orbits are not all in the\nsame direction, as occurs in spirals. Therefore, ellipticals don\u2019t appear to rotate in a systematic way, making it\ndifficult to estimate how much dark matter they contain.\nWe find that elliptical galaxies range all the way from the giants, just described, to dwarfs, which may be the\nmost common kind of galaxy.Dwarf ellipticals(sometimes called dwarf spheroidals) escaped our notice for a\nlong time because they are very faint and difficult to see. An example of a dwarf elliptical is the Leo I Dwarf\nSpheroidal galaxy shown inFigure 26.8. The luminosity of this typical dwarf is about equal to that of the\nbrightest globular clusters.\nIntermediate between the giant and dwarf elliptical galaxies are systems such as M32 and M110, the two\ncompanions of the Andromeda galaxy. While they are often referred to as dwarf ellipticals, these galaxies are\nsignificantly larger than galaxies such as Leo I.\nFigure26.8Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy.M32, a dwarf elliptical galaxy and one of the companions to the giant Andromeda galaxy M31.\nM32 is a dwarf by galactic standards, as it is only 2400 light-years across.

Typically, irregular\ngalaxies have lower masses and luminosities than spiral galaxies. Irregular galaxies often appear\ndisorganized, and many are undergoing relatively intense star formation activity. They contain both young\npopulation I stars and old population II stars.\nThe two best-known irregular galaxies are theLarge Magellanic CloudandSmall Magellanic Cloud(Figure\n26.9), which are at a distance of a little more than 160,000 light-years away and are among our nearest\nextragalactic neighbors. Their names reflect the fact that Ferdinand Magellan and his crew, making their\nround-the-world journey, were the first European travelers to notice them. Although not visible from the\nUnited States and Europe, these two systems are prominent from the Southern Hemisphere, where they look\nlike wispy clouds in the night sky. Since they are only about one-tenth as distant as the Andromeda galaxy,\nthey present an excellent opportunity for astronomers to study nebulae, star clusters, variable stars, and other\nkey objects in the setting of another galaxy. For example, the Large Magellanic Cloud contains the 30 Doradus\ncomplex (also known as the Tarantula Nebula), one of the largest and most luminous groups of supergiant\nstars known in any galaxy.\nFigure26.94-Meter Telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory Silhouetted against the Southern Sky.The Milky\nWay is seen to the right of the dome, and the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds are seen to the left. (credit: Roger Smith/NOAO/\nAURA/NSF)\nThe Small Magellanic Cloud is considerably less massive than the Large Magellanic Cloud, and it is six times\nlonger than it is wide. This narrow wisp of material points directly toward our Galaxy like an arrow. The Small\nMagellanic Cloud was most likely contorted into its current shape through gravitational interactions with the\nMilky Way. A large trail of debris from this interaction between the Milky Way and the Small Magellanic Cloud\nhas been strewn across the sky and is seen as a series of gas clouds moving at abnormally high velocity, 880 26 \u2022 Galaxies\nknown as the Magellanic Stream. We will see that this kind of interaction between galaxies will help explain the\nirregular shapes of this whole category of small galaxies,\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView thisbeautiful album showcasing the different types of galaxies(https://openstax.org/l/\n30galaxphohubb)that have been photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope.\nGalaxy Evolution\nEncouraged by the success of the H-R diagram for stars (seeAnalyzing Starlight), astronomers studying\ngalaxies hoped to find some sort of comparable scheme, where differences in appearance could be tied to\ndifferent evolutionary stages in the life of galaxies. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if every elliptical galaxy evolved into a\nspiral, for example, just as every main-sequence star evolves into a red giant? Several simple ideas of this kind\nwere tried, some by Hubble himself, but none stood the test of time (and observation).\nBecause no simple scheme for evolving one type of galaxy into another could be found, astronomers then\ntended to the opposite point of view. For a while, most astronomers thought that all galaxies formed very\nearly in the history of the universe and that the differences between them had to do with the rate of star\nformation. Ellipticals were those galaxies in which all the interstellar matter was converted rapidly into stars.\nSpirals were galaxies in which star formation occurred slowly over the entire lifetime of the galaxy. This idea\nturned out to be too simple as well.\nToday, we understand that at least some galaxies have changed types over the billions of years since the\nuniverse began. As we shall see in later chapters, collisions and mergers between galaxies may dramatically\nchange spiral galaxies into elliptical galaxies. Even isolated spirals (with no neighbor galaxies in sight) can\nchange their appearance over time. As they consume their gas, the rate of star formation will slow down, and\nthe spiral arms will gradually become less conspicuous. Over long periods, spirals therefore begin to look\nmore like the galaxies at the middle ofFigure 26.6(which astronomers refer to as S0 types).\nOver the past several decades, the study of how galaxies evolve over the lifetime of the universe has become\none of the most active fields of astronomical research. We will discuss the evolution of galaxies in more detail\ninThe Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies, but let\u2019s first see in a little more detail just what different\ngalaxies are like.\n26.3 Properties of Galaxies\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the methods through which astronomers can estimate the mass of a galaxy\nCharacterize each type of galaxy by its mass-to-light ratio\nThe technique for deriving the masses ofgalaxiesis basically the same as that used to estimate the mass of\nthe Sun, the stars, and our own Galaxy. We measure how fast objects in the outer regions of the galaxy are\norbiting the center, and then we use this information along with Kepler\u2019s third law to calculate how much\nmass is inside that orbit.\nMasses of Galaxies\nAstronomers can measure the rotation speed in spiral galaxies by obtaining spectra of either stars or gas, and\nlooking for wavelength shifts produced by theDoppler effect. Remember that the faster something is moving\ntoward or away from us, the greater the shift of the lines in its spectrum. Kepler\u2019s law, together with such\nAccess for free at openstax.org 26.3 \u2022 Properties of Galaxies 881\nobservations of the part of the Andromeda galaxy that is bright in visible light, for example, show it to have a\ngalactic massof about 4 \u00d7 1011M (enough material to make 400 billion stars like the Sun).\nSun\nThe total mass of theAndromeda galaxyis greater than this, however, because we have not included the mass\nof the material that lies beyond its visible edge. Fortunately, there is a handful of objects\u2014such as isolated\nstars, star clusters, and satellite galaxies\u2014beyond the visible edge that allows astronomers to estimate how\nmuch additional matter is hidden out there. Recent studies show that the amount ofdark matterbeyond the\nvisible edge of Andromeda may be as large as the mass of the bright portion of the galaxy. Indeed, using\nKepler\u2019s third law and the velocities of its satellite galaxies, the Andromeda galaxy is estimated to have a mass\ncloser to 1.4 \u00d7 1012M . The mass of theMilky Way Galaxyis estimated to be 8.5 \u00d7 1011M , and so our Milky\nSun Sun\nWay is turning out to be somewhat smaller than Andromeda.\nElliptical galaxies do not rotate in a systematic way, so we cannot determine a rotational velocity; therefore, we\nmust use a slightly different technique to measure their mass. Their stars are still orbiting the galactic center,\nbut not in the organized way that characterizes spirals. Since elliptical galaxies contain stars that are billions of\nyears old, we can assume that the galaxies themselves are not flying apart. Therefore, if we can measure the\nvarious speeds with which the stars are moving in their orbits around the center of the galaxy, we can\ncalculate how much mass the galaxy must contain in order to hold the stars within it.\nIn practice, the spectrum of a galaxy is a composite of the spectra of its many stars, whose different motions\nproduce different Doppler shifts (some red, some blue). The result is that the lines we observe from the entire\ngalaxy contain the combination of many Doppler shifts. When some stars provide blueshifts and others\nprovide redshifts, they create a wider or broader absorption or emission feature than would the same lines in\na hypothetical galaxy in which the stars had no orbital motion. Astronomers call this phenomenonline\nbroadening. The amount by which each line broadens indicates the range of speeds at which the stars are\nmoving with respect to the center of the galaxy. The range of speeds depends, in turn, on the force of gravity\nthat holds the stars within the galaxies. With information about the speeds, it is possible to calculate the mass\nof an elliptical galaxy.\nTable 26.1summarizes the range of masses (and other properties) of the various types of galaxies.\nInterestingly enough, the most and least massive galaxies are ellipticals. On average, irregular galaxies have\nless mass than spirals.\nCharacteristics of the Different Types of Galaxies\nCharacteristic Spirals Ellipticals Irregulars\nMass (M ) 109to 1012 105to 1013 108to 1011\nSun\nDiameter (thousands of\n15 to 150 3 to >700 3 to 30\nlight-years)\nLuminosity (L ) 108to 1011 106to 1011 107to 2 \u00d7 109\nSun\nOld and\nPopulations of stars Old Old and young\nyoung\nGas and Almost no dust; Much gas; some have little dust, some\nInterstellar matter\ndust little gas much dust\nTable26.1 882 26 \u2022 Galaxies\nCharacteristic Spirals Ellipticals Irregulars\nMass-to-light ratio in the\n2 to 10 10 to 20 1 to 10\nvisible part\nMass-to-light ratio for total\n100 100 ?\ngalaxy\nTable26.1\nMass-to-Light Ratio\nA useful way of characterizing a galaxy is by noting the ratio of its mass (in units of the Sun\u2019s mass) to its light\noutput (in units of the Sun\u2019s luminosity). This single number tells us roughly what kind of stars make up most\nof the luminous population of the galaxy, and it also tells us whether a lot ofdark matteris present. For stars\nlike the Sun, themass-to-light ratiois 1 by our definition.\nGalaxies are not, of course, composed entirely of stars that are identical to the Sun. The overwhelming\nmajority of stars are less massive and less luminous than the Sun, and usually these stars contribute most of\nthe mass of a system without accounting for very much light. The mass-to-light ratio for low-mass stars is\ngreater than 1 (you can verify this using the data inTable 18.3). Therefore, a galaxy\u2019s mass-to-light ratio is also\ngenerally greater than 1, with the exact value depending on the ratio of high-mass stars to low-mass stars.\nGalaxies in which star formation is still occurring have many massive stars, and their mass-to-light ratios are\nusually in the range of 1 to 10. Galaxies consisting mostly of an older stellar population, such as ellipticals, in\nwhich the massive stars have already completed their evolution and have ceased to shine, have mass-to-light\nratios of 10 to 20.\nBut these figures refer only to the inner, conspicuous parts of galaxies (Figure 26.10). InThe Milky Way Galaxy\nand above, we discussed the evidence for dark matter in the outer regions of our own Galaxy, extending much\nfarther from the galactic center than do the bright stars and gas. Recent measurements of the rotation speeds\nof the outer parts of nearby galaxies, such as the Andromeda galaxy we discussed earlier, suggest that they\ntoo have extended distributions of dark matter around the visible disk of stars and dust. This largely invisible\nmatter adds to the mass of the galaxy while contributing nothing to its luminosity, thus increasing the mass-\nto-light ratio. If dark invisible matter is present in a galaxy, its mass-to-light ratio can be as high as 100. The\ntwo different mass-to-light ratios measured for various types of galaxies are given inTable 26.1.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 26.4 \u2022 The Extragalactic Distance Scale 883\nFigure26.10M101, the Pinwheel Galaxy.This galaxy is a face-on spiral at a distance of 21 million light-years. M101 is almost twice\nthe diameter of the Milky Way, and it contains at least 1 trillion stars. (credit: NASA, ESA, K. Kuntz (Johns Hopkins University), F.\nBresolin (University of Hawaii), J. Trauger (Jet Propulsion Lab), J. Mould (NOAO), Y.-H. Chu (University of Illinois, Urbana), and STScI)\nThese measurements of other galaxies support the conclusion already reached from studies of the rotation of\nour own Galaxy\u2014namely, that most of the material in the universe cannot at present be observed directly in\nany part of the electromagnetic spectrum. An understanding of the properties and distribution of this invisible\nmatter is crucial to our understanding of galaxies. It\u2019s becoming clearer and clearer that, through the\ngravitational force it exerts, dark matter plays a dominant role in galaxy formation and early evolution. There\nis an interesting parallel here between our time and the time during which Edwin Hubble was receiving his\ntraining in astronomy. By 1920, many scientists were aware that astronomy stood on the brink of important\nbreakthroughs\u2014if only the nature and behavior of the nebulae could be settled with better observations. In\nthe same way, many astronomers today feel we may be closing in on a far more sophisticated understanding\nof the large-scale structure of the universe\u2014if only we can learn more about the nature and properties of dark\nmatter. If you follow astronomy articles in the news (as we hope you will), you should be hearing more about\ndark matter in the years to come.\n26.4 The Extragalactic Distance Scale\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the use ofvariable starsto estimate distances to galaxies\nExplain howstandard bulbs and the Tully-Fisher relation can be used to estimate distances to galaxies\nTo determine many of the properties of a galaxy, such as its luminosity or size, we must first know how far\naway it is. If we know the distance to a galaxy, we can convert how bright the galaxy appears to us in the sky 884 26 \u2022 Galaxies\ninto its true luminosity because we know the precise way light is dimmed by distance. (The same galaxy 10\ntimes farther away, for example, would look 100 times dimmer.) But the measurement of galaxy distances is\none of the most difficult problems in modern astronomy: all galaxies are far away, and most are so distant that\nwe cannot even make out individual stars in them.\nFor decades after Hubble\u2019s initial work, the techniques used to measure galaxy distances were relatively\ninaccurate, and different astronomers derived distances that differed by as much as a factor of two. (Imagine\nif the distance between your home or dorm and your astronomy class were this uncertain; it would be difficult\nto make sure you got to class on time.) In the past few decades, however, astronomers have devised new\ntechniques for measuring distances to galaxies; most importantly, all of them give the same answer to within\nan accuracy of about 10%. As we will see, this means we may finally be able to make reliable estimates of the\nsize of the universe.\nVariable Stars\nBefore astronomers could measure distances to other galaxies, they first had to establish the scale of cosmic\ndistances using objects in our own Galaxy. We described the chain of these distance methods inCelestial\nDistances(and we recommend that you review that chapter if it has been a while since you\u2019ve read it).\nAstronomers were especially delighted when they discovered that they could measure distances using certain\nkinds of intrinsically luminousvariable stars, such as cepheids, which can be seen at very large distances\n(Figure 26.11).\nAfter the variables in nearby galaxies had been used to make distance measurements for a few decades,\nWalterBaadeshowed that there were actually two kinds of cepheids and that astronomers had been\nunwittingly mixing them up. As a result, in the early 1950s, the distances to all of the galaxies had to be\nincreased by about a factor of two. We mention this because we want you to bear in mind, as you read on, that\nscience is always a study in progress. Our first tentative steps in such difficult investigations are always subject\nto future revision as our techniques become more reliable.\nThe amount of work involved in finding cepheids and measuring their periods can be enormous. Hubble, for\nexample, obtained 350 long-exposure photographs of the Andromeda galaxy over a period of 18 years and\nwas able to identify only 40 cepheids. Even though cepheids are fairly luminous stars, they can be detected in\nonly about 30 of the nearest galaxies with the world\u2019s largest ground-based telescopes.\nAs mentioned inCelestial Distances, one of the main projects carried out during the first years of operation of\nthe Hubble Space Telescope was the measurement of cepheids in more distant galaxies to improve the\naccuracy of the extragalactic distance scale. Recently, astronomers working with the Hubble Space Telescope\nhave extended such measurements out to 108 million light-years\u2014a triumph of technology and\ndetermination.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 26.4 \u2022 The Extragalactic Distance Scale 885\nFigure26.11Cepheid Variable Star.In 1994, using the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers were able to make out an individual\ncepheid variable star in the galaxy M100 and measure its distance to be 56 million light-years. The insets show the star on three\ndifferent nights; you can see that its brightness is indeed variable. (credit: modification of work by Wendy L. Freedman,\nObservatories of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and NASA/ESA)\nNevertheless, we can only use cepheids to measure distances within a small fraction of the universe of\ngalaxies. After all, to use this method, we must be able to resolve single stars and follow their subtle variations.\nBeyond a certain distance, even our finest space telescopes cannot help us do this. Fortunately, there are other\nways to measure the distances to galaxies.\nStandard Bulbs\nWe discussed inCelestial Distancesthe great frustration that astronomers felt when they realized that the\nstars in general were not standardbulbs. If every light bulb in a huge auditorium is a standard 100-watt bulb,\nthen bulbs that look brighter to us must be closer, whereas those that look dimmer must be farther away. If\nevery star were a standard luminosity (or wattage), then we could similarly \u201cread off\u201d their distances based on\nhow bright they appear to us. Alas, as we have learned, neither stars nor galaxies come in one standard-issue\nluminosity. Nonetheless, astronomers have been searching for objects out there that do act in some way like a\nstandard bulb\u2014that have the same intrinsic (built-in) brightness wherever they are.\nA number of suggestions have been made for what sorts of objects might be effective standard bulbs,\nincluding the brightest supergiant stars, planetary nebulae (which give off a lot of ultraviolet radiation), and\nthe average globular cluster in a galaxy. One object turns out to be particularly useful: thetype Ia supernova.\nThese supernovae involve the explosion of a white dwarf in a binary system (seeThe Evolution of Binary Star\nSystems) Observations show that supernovae of this type all reach nearly the same luminosity (about 4.5 \u00d7 109\nL ) at maximum light. With such tremendous luminosities, these supernovae have been detected out to a\nSun\ndistance of more than 8 billion light-years and are therefore especially attractive to astronomers as a way of\ndetermining distances on a large scale (Figure 26.12). 886 26 \u2022 Galaxies\nFigure26.12Type Ia Supernova.The bright object at the bottom left of center is atype Ia supernovanear its peak intensity. The\nsupernova easily outshines its host galaxy. This extreme increase and luminosity help astronomers use Ia supernova as standard\nbulbs. (credit: NASA, ESA, A. Riess (STScI))\nSeveral other kinds of standard bulbs visible over great distances have also been suggested, including the\noverall brightness of, for example, giant ellipticals and the brightest member of a galaxy cluster. Type Ia\nsupernovae, however, have proved to be the most accurate standard bulbs, and they can be seen in more\ndistant galaxies than the other types of calibrators. As we will see in the chapter onThe Big Bang, observations\nof this type of supernova have profoundly changed our understanding of the evolution of the universe.\nOther Measuring Techniques\nAnother technique for measuring galactic distances makes use of an interesting relationship noticed in the\nlate 1970s by BrentTullyof the University of Hawaii and RichardFisherof the National Radio Astronomy\nObservatory. They discovered that the luminosity of a spiral galaxy is related to its rotational velocity (how fast\nit spins). Why would this be true?\nThe more mass a galaxy has, the faster the objects in its outer regions must orbit. A more massive galaxy has\nmore stars in it and is thus more luminous (ignoring dark matter for a moment). Thinking back to our\ndiscussion from the previous section, we can say that if the mass-to-light ratios for various spiral galaxies are\npretty similar, then we can estimate the luminosity of a spiral galaxy by measuring its mass, and we can\nestimate its mass by measuring its rotational velocity.\nTully and Fisher used the21-cm lineof cold hydrogen gas to determine how rapidly material in spiral galaxies\nis orbiting their centers (you can review our discussion of the 21-cm line inBetween the Stars: Gas and Dust in\nSpace). Since 21-cm radiation from stationary atoms comes in a nice narrow line, the width of the 21-cm line\nproduced by a whole rotating galaxy tells us the range of orbital velocities of the galaxy\u2019s hydrogen gas. The\nbroader the line, the faster the gas is orbiting in the galaxy, and the more massive and luminous the galaxy\nturns out to be.\nIt is somewhat surprising that this technique works, since much of the mass associated with galaxies is dark\nmatter, which does not contribute at all to the luminosity but does affect the rotation speed. There is also no\nobvious reason why the mass-to-light ratio should be similar for all spiral galaxies. Nevertheless, observations\nof nearer galaxies (where we have other ways of measuring distance) show that measuring the rotational\nvelocity of a galaxy provides an accurate estimate of its intrinsic luminosity. Once we know how luminous the\ngalaxy really is, we can compare the luminosity to the apparent brightness and use the difference to calculate\nAccess for free at openstax.org 26.5 \u2022 The Expanding Universe 887\nits distance.\nWhile theTully-Fisher relationworks well, it is limited\u2014we can only use it to determine the distance to a spiral\ngalaxy. There are other methods that can be used to estimate the distance to an elliptical galaxy; however,\nthose methods are beyond the scope of our introductory astronomy course.\nTable 26.2lists the type of galaxy for which each of the distance techniques is useful, and the range of\ndistances over which the technique can be applied.\nSome Methods for Estimating Distance to Galaxies\nMethod Galaxy Type Approximate Distance Range (millions of light-years)\nPlanetary nebulae All 0\u201370\nCepheid variables Spiral, irregulars 0\u2013110\nTully-Fisher relation Spiral 0\u2013300\nType Ia supernovae All 0\u201311,000\nRedshifts (Hubble\u2019s law) All 300\u201313,000\nTable26.2\n26.5 The Expanding Universe\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the discovery that galaxies getting farther apart as the universe evolves\nExplain how to use Hubble\u2019s law to determine distances to remote galaxies\nDescribe models for the nature of an expanding universe\nExplain the variation in Hubble\u2019s constant\nWe now come to one of the most important discoveries ever made in astronomy\u2014the fact that the universe is\nexpanding. Before we describe how the discovery was made, we should point out that the first steps in the\nstudy of galaxies came at a time when the techniques of spectroscopy were also making great strides.\nAstronomers using large telescopes could record the spectrum of a faint star or galaxy on photographic\nplates, guiding their telescopes so they remained pointed to the same object for many hours and collected\nmore light. The resulting spectra of galaxies contained a wealth of information about the composition of the\ngalaxy and the velocities of these great star systems.\nSlipher\u2019s Pioneering Observations\nCuriously, the discovery of the expansion of the universe began with the search for Martians and other solar\nsystems. In 1894, the controversial (and wealthy) astronomer Percival Lowell established an observatory in\nFlagstaff, Arizona, to study the planets and search for life in the universe. Lowell thought that the spiral\nnebulae might be solar systems in the process of formation. He therefore asked one of the observatory\u2019s\nyoung astronomers, Vesto M.Slipher(Figure 26.13), to photograph the spectra of some of the spiral nebulae\nto see if their spectral lines might show chemical compositions like those expected for newly forming planets. 888 26 \u2022 Galaxies\nFigure26.13Vesto M. Slipher (1875\u20131969).Slipher spent his entire career at the Lowell Observatory, where he discovered the large\nradial velocities of galaxies. (credit: Lowell Observatory)\nThe Lowell Observatory\u2019s major instrument was a 24-inch refracting telescope, which was not at all well suited\nto observations of faint spiral nebulae. With the technology available in those days, photographic plates had to\nbe exposed for 20 to 40 hours to produce a good spectrum (in which the positions of the lines could reveal a\ngalaxy\u2019s motion). This often meant continuing to expose the same photograph over several nights. Beginning\nin 1912, and making heroic efforts over a period of about 20 years, Slipher managed to photograph the spectra\nof more than 40 of the spiral nebulae (which would all turn out to be galaxies).\nTo his surprise, the spectral lines of most galaxies showed an astoundingredshift. By \u201credshift\u201d we mean that\nthe lines in the spectra are displaced toward longer wavelengths (toward the red end of the visible spectrum).\nRecall from the chapter onRadiation and Spectrathat a redshift is seen when the source of the waves is\nmoving away from us. Slipher\u2019s observations showed that most spirals are racing away at huge speeds; the\nhighest velocity he measured was 1800 kilometers per second.\nOnly a few spirals\u2014such as the Andromeda and Triangulum Galaxies and M81\u2014all of which are now known to\nbe our close neighbors, turned out to be approaching us. All the other galaxies were moving away. Slipher first\nannounced this discovery in 1914, years before Hubble showed that these objects were other galaxies and\nbefore anyone knew how far away they were. No one at the time quite knew what to make of this discovery.\nHubble\u2019s Law\nThe profound implications of Slipher\u2019s work became apparent only during the 1920s. GeorgesLema\u00eetrewas a\nBelgian priest and a trained astronomer. In 1927, he published a paper in French in an obscure Belgian journal\nin which he suggested that we live in an expanding universe. The title of the paper (translated into English) is\n\u201cA Homogenous Universe of Constant Mass and Growing Radius Accounting for the Radial Velocity of\nExtragalactic Nebulae.\u201d Lema\u00eetre had discovered that Einstein\u2019s equations of relativity were consistent with an\nexpanding universe (as had the Russian scientist Alexander Friedmann independently in 1922). Lema\u00eetre then\nwent on to use Slipher\u2019s data to support the hypothesis that the universe actually is expanding and to estimate\nthe rate of expansion. Initially, scientists paid little attention to this paper, perhaps because the Belgian journal\nwas not widely available.\nIn the meantime, Hubble was making observations of galaxies with the 2.5-meter telescope on Mt. Wilson,\nwhich was then the world\u2019s largest. Hubble carried out the key observations in collaboration with a remarkable\nman, MiltonHumason, who dropped out of school in the eighth grade and began his astronomical career by\ndriving a mule train up the trail on Mount Wilson to the observatory (Figure 26.14). In those early days,\nsupplies had to be brought up that way; even astronomers hiked up to the mountaintop for their turns at the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 26.5 \u2022 The Expanding Universe 889\ntelescope. Humason became interested in the work of the astronomers and, after marrying the daughter of\nthe observatory\u2019s electrician, took a job as janitor there. After a time, he became a night assistant, helping the\nastronomers run the telescope and record data. Eventually, he made such a mark that he became a full\nastronomer at the observatory.\nFigure26.14Milton Humason (1891\u20131972).Humason was Hubble\u2019s collaborator on the great task of observing, measuring, and\nclassifying the characteristics of many galaxies. (credit: Caltech Archives)\nBy the late 1920s, Humason was collaborating with Hubble by photographing the spectra of faint galaxies with\nthe 2.5-meter telescope. (By then, there was no question that the spiral nebulae were in fact galaxies.) Hubble\nhad found ways to improve the accuracy of the estimates of distances to spiral galaxies, and he was able to\nmeasure much fainter and more distant galaxies than Slipher could observe with his much-smaller telescope.\nWhen Hubble laid his own distance estimates next to measurements of the recession velocities (the speed with\nwhich the galaxies were moving away), he found something stunning: there was a relationship between\ndistance and velocity for galaxies.The more distant the galaxy, the faster it was receding from us.\nIn 1931,Hubbleand Humason jointly published the seminal paper where they compared distances and\nvelocities of remote galaxies moving away from us at speeds as high as 20,000 kilometers per second and\nwere able to show that the recession velocities of galaxies are directly proportional to their distances from us\n(Figure 26.15), just as Lema\u00eetre had suggested.\nFigure26.15Hubble\u2019s Law.(a) These data show Hubble\u2019s original velocity-distance relation, adapted from his 1929 paper in the\nProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. (b) These data show Hubble and Humason\u2019s velocity-distance relation, adapted\nfrom their 1931 paper inThe Astrophysical Journal. The red dots at the lower left are the points in the diagram in the 1929 paper. 890 26 \u2022 Galaxies\nComparison of the two graphs shows how rapidly the determination of galactic distances and redshifts progressed in the 2 years\nbetween these publications.\nWe now know that this relationship holds for every galaxy except a few of the nearest ones. Nearly all of the\ngalaxies that are approaching us turn out to be part of the Milky Way\u2019s own group of galaxies, which have\ntheir own individual motions, just as birds flying in a group may fly in slightly different directions at slightly\ndifferent speeds even though the entire flock travels through space together.\nWritten as a formula, the relationship between velocity and distance is\nwherevis the velocity,dis the distance, andHis a number called theHubble constant. This equation is now\n1\nknown asHubble\u2019s law.\nASTRONOMY BASICS\nConstants of Proportionality\nMathematical relationships such as Hubble\u2019s law are pretty common in life. To take a simple example,\nsuppose your college or university hires you to call rich alumni and ask for donations. You are paid $2.50 for\neach call; the more calls you can squeeze in between studying astronomy and other courses, the more\nmoney you take home. We can set up a formula that connectsp, your pay, andn, the number of calls\nwhereAis the alumni constant, with a value of $2.50. If you make 20 calls, you will earn $2.50 times 20, or\n$50.\nSuppose your boss forgets to tell you what you will get paid for each call. You can calculate the alumni\nconstant that governs your pay by keeping track of how many calls you make and noting your gross pay\neach week. If you make 100 calls the first week and are paid $250, you can deduce that the constant is $2.50\n(in units of dollars per call). Hubble, of course, had no \u201cboss\u201d to tell him what his constant would be\u2014he\nhadto calculate its value from the measurements of distance and velocity.\nAstronomers express the value of Hubble\u2019s constant in units that relate to how they measure speed and\ndistance for galaxies. In this book, we will use kilometers per second per million light-years as that unit. For\nmany years, estimates of the value of the Hubble constant have been in the range of 15 to 30 kilometers per\nsecond per million light-years The most recent work appears to be converging on a value near 22 kilometers\nper second per million light-years IfHis 22 kilometers per second per million light-years, a galaxy moves away\nfrom us at a speed of 22 kilometers per second for every million light-years of its distance. As an example, a\ngalaxy 100 million light-years away is moving away from us at a speed of 2200 kilometers per second.\nHubble\u2019s law tells us something fundamental about the universe. Since all but the nearest galaxies appear to\nbe in motion away from us, with the most distant ones moving the fastest, we must be living in an expanding\nuniverse. We will explore the implications of this idea shortly, as well as in the final chapters of this text. For\nnow, we will just say that Hubble\u2019s observation underlies all our theories about the origin and evolution of the\nuniverse.\nHubble\u2019s Law and Distances\nThe regularity expressed in Hubble\u2019s law has a built-in bonus: it gives us a new way to determine the distances\nto remote galaxies. First, we must reliably establish Hubble\u2019s constant by measuring both the distance and the\n1 In 2020, the International Astronomical Union suggested that it would be more fair to call it the Hubble-Lemaitre law. In telling\nthe history in this textbook, we have acknowledged the role Lema\u00eetre played, and we urge our readers to keep his contributions in\nmind as they read on.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 26.5 \u2022 The Expanding Universe 891\nvelocity of many galaxies in many directions to be sure Hubble\u2019s law is truly a universal property of galaxies.\nBut once we have calculated the value of this constant and are satisfied that it applies everywhere, much more\nof the universe opens up for distance determination. Basically, if we can obtain a spectrum of a galaxy, we can\nimmediately tell how far away it is.\nThe procedure works like this. We use the spectrum to measure the speed with which the galaxy is moving\naway from us. If we then put this speed and the Hubble constant into Hubble\u2019s law equation, we can solve for\nthe distance.\nEXAMPLE 26.1\nHubble\u2019s Law\nHubble\u2019s law(v=H\u00d7d) allows us to calculate the distance to any galaxy. Here is how we use it in practice.\nWe have measured Hubble\u2019s constant to be 22 km/s per million light-years. This means that if a galaxy is 1\nmillion light-years farther away, it will move away 22 km/s faster. So, if we find a galaxy that is moving away\nat 18,000 km/s, what does Hubble\u2019s law tells us about the distance to the galaxy?\nSolution\nNote how we handled the units here: the km/s in the numerator and denominator cancel, and the factor of\nmillion light-years in the denominator of the constant must be divided correctly before we get our distance\nof 818 million light-years.\nCheck Your Learning\nUsing 22 km/s/million light-years for Hubble\u2019s constant, what recessional velocity do we expect to find if we\nobserve a galaxy at 500 million light-years?\nAnswer:\nVariation of Hubble\u2019s Constant\nThe use of redshift is potentially a very important technique for determining distances because as we have\nseen, most of our methods for determining galaxy distances are limited to approximately the nearest few\nhundred million light-years (and they have large uncertainties at these distances). The use of Hubble\u2019s law as a\ndistance indicator requires only a spectrum of a galaxy and a measurement of the Doppler shift, and with\nlarge telescopes and modern spectrographs, spectra can be taken of extremely faint galaxies.\nBut, as is often the case in science, things are not so simple. This technique works if, and only if, the Hubble\nconstant has been truly constant throughout the entire life of the universe. When we observe galaxies billions\nof light-years away, we are seeing them as they were billions of years ago. What if the Hubble \u201cconstant\u201d was\ndifferent billions of years ago? Before 1998, astronomers thought that, although the universe is expanding, the\nexpansion should be slowing down, or decelerating, because the overall gravitational pull of all matter in the\nuniverse would have a dominant, measureable effect. If the expansion is decelerating, then the Hubble\nconstant should be decreasing over time.\nThe discovery thattype Ia supernovae are standard bulbs gave astronomers the tool they needed to observe\nextremely distant galaxies and measure the rate of expansion billions of years ago. The results were\ncompletely unexpected. It turns out that the expansion of the universe isacceleratingover time! What makes 892 26 \u2022 Galaxies\nthis result so astounding is that there is no way that existing physical theories can account for this\nobservation. While a decelerating universe could easily be explained by gravity, there was no force or property\nin the universe known to astronomers that could account for the acceleration. InThe Big Bangchapter, we will\nlook in more detail at the observations that led to this totally unexpected result and explore its implications for\nthe ultimate fate of the universe.\nIn any case, if the Hubble constant is not really a constant when we look over large spans of space and time,\nthen the calculation of galaxy distances using the Hubble constant won\u2019t be accurate. As we shall see in the\nchapter onThe Big Bang, the accurate calculation of distances requires a model for how the Hubble constant\nhas changed over time. The farther away a galaxy is (and the longer ago we are seeing it), the more important\nit is to include the effects of the change in the Hubble constant. For galaxies within a few billion light-years,\nhowever, the assumption that the Hubble constant is indeed constant gives good estimates of distance.\nModels for an Expanding Universe\nAt first, thinking about Hubble\u2019s law and being a fan of the work of Copernicus and Harlow Shapley, you might\nbe shocked. Are all the galaxies really movingaway from us? Is there, after all, something special about our\nposition in the universe? Worry not; the fact that galaxies are receding from us and that more distant galaxies\nare moving away more rapidly than nearby ones shows only that the universe is expanding uniformly.\nA uniformlyexpanding universeis one that is expanding at the same rate everywhere. In such a universe, we\nand all other observers, no matter where they are located, must observe a proportionality between the\nvelocities and distances of equivalently remote galaxies. (Here, we are ignoring the fact that the Hubble\nconstant is not constant over all time, but if at any given time in the evolution of the universe the Hubble\nconstant has the same value everywhere, this argument still works.)\nTo see why, first imagine a ruler made of stretchable rubber, with the usual lines marked off at each\ncentimeter. Now suppose someone with strong arms grabs each end of the ruler and slowly stretches it so\nthat, say, it doubles in length in 1 minute (Figure 26.16). Consider an intelligent ant sitting on the mark at 2\ncentimeters\u2014a point that is not at either end nor in the middle of the ruler. He measures how fast other ants,\nsitting at the 4-, 7-, and 12-centimeter marks, move away from him as the ruler stretches.\nFigure26.16Stretching a Ruler.Ants on a stretching ruler see other ants move away from them. The speed with which another ant\nmoves away is proportional to its distance.\nThe ant at 4 centimeters, originally 2 centimeters away from our ant, has doubled its distance in 1 minute; it\ntherefore moved away at a speed of 2 centimeters per minute. The ant at the 7-centimeters mark, which was\noriginally 5 centimeters away from our ant, is now 10 centimeters away; it thus had to move at 5 centimeters\nper minute. The one that started at the 12-centimeters mark, which was 10 centimeters away from the ant\ndoing the counting, is now 20 centimeters away, meaning it must have raced away at a speed of 10\ncentimeters per minute. Ants at different distances move away at different speeds, and their speeds are\nproportional to their distances (just as Hubble\u2019s law indicates for galaxies). Yet, notice in our example that all\nthe ruler was doing was stretching uniformly. Also, notice that none of the ants were actually moving of their\nown accord, it was the stretching of the ruler that moved them apart.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 26.5 \u2022 The Expanding Universe 893\nNow let\u2019s repeat the analysis, but put the intelligent ant on some other mark\u2014say, on 7 or 12 centimeters. We\ndiscover that, as long as the ruler stretches uniformly, this ant also finds every other ant moving away at a\nspeed proportional to its distance. In other words, the kind of relationship expressed by Hubble\u2019s law can be\nexplained by a uniform stretching of the \u201cworld\u201d of the ants. And all the ants in our simple diagram will see the\nother ants moving away from them as the ruler stretches.\nFor a three-dimensional analogy, let\u2019s look at the loaf of raisin bread inFigure 26.17. The chef has accidentally\nput too much yeast in the dough, and when she sets the bread out to rise, it doubles in size during the next\nhour, causing all the raisins to move farther apart. On the figure, we again pick a representative raisin (that is\nnot at the edge or the center of the loaf) and show the distances from it to several others in the figure (before\nand after the loaf expands).\nFigure26.17Expanding Raisin Bread.As the raisin bread rises, the raisins \u201csee\u201d other raisins moving away. More distant raisins\nmove away faster in a uniformly expanding bread.\nMeasure the increases in distance and calculate the speeds for yourself on the raisin bread, just like we did for\nthe ruler. You will see that, since each distance doubles during the hour, each raisin moves away from our\nselected raisin at a speed proportional to its distance. The same is true no matter which raisin you start with.\nOur two analogies are useful for clarifying our thinking, but you must not take them literally. On both the ruler\nand the raisin bread, there are points that are at the end or edge. You can use these to pinpoint the middle of\nthe ruler and the loaf. While our models of the universe have some resemblance to the properties of the ruler\nand the loaf, the universe has no boundaries, no edges, and no center (all mind-boggling ideas that we will\ndiscuss in a later chapter).\nWhat is useful to notice about both the ants and the raisins is that they themselves did not \u201ccause\u201d their\nmotion. It isn\u2019t as if the raisins decided to take a trip away from each other and then hopped on a hoverboard\nto get away. No, in both our analogies, it was the stretching of the medium (the ruler or the bread) that moved\nthe ants or the raisins farther apart. In the same way, we will see inThe Big Bangchapter that the galaxies\ndon\u2019t have rocket motors propelling them away from each other. Instead, they are passive participants in the\nexpansion of space. As space stretches, the galaxies are carried farther and farther apart much as the ants and\nthe raisins were. (If this notion of the \u201cstretching\u201d of space surprises or bothers you, now would be a good\ntime to review the information about spacetime inBlack Holes and Curved Spacetime. We will discuss these\nideas further as our discussion broadens from galaxies to the whole universe.)\nThe expansion of the universe, by the way, does not imply that the individual galaxies and clusters of galaxies\nthemselves are expanding. Neither raisins nor the ants in our analogy grow in size as the loaf expands.\nSimilarly, gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies together, and they get farther away from each\nother\u2014without themselves changing in size\u2014as the universe expands. 894 26 \u2022 Key Terms\nKey Terms\nelliptical galaxy a galaxy whose shape is an ellipse and that contains no conspicuous interstellar material\nHubble constant a constant of proportionality in the law relating the velocities of remote galaxies to their\ndistances\nHubble\u2019s law a rule that the radial velocities of remote galaxies are proportional to their distances from us\nirregular galaxy a galaxy without any clear symmetry or pattern; neither a spiral nor an elliptical galaxy\nmass-to-light ratio the ratio of the total mass of a galaxy to its total luminosity, usually expressed in units of\nsolar mass and solar luminosity; the mass-to-light ratio gives a rough indication of the types of stars\ncontained within a galaxy and whether or not substantial quantities of dark matter are present\nredshift when lines in the spectra are displaced toward longer wavelengths (toward the red end of the\nvisible spectrum)\nspiral galaxy a flattened, rotating galaxy with pinwheel-like arms of interstellar material and young stars,\nwinding out from its central bulge\ntype Ia supernova a supernova formed by the explosion of a white dwarf in a binary system and reach a\nluminosity of about 4.5 \u00d7 109L ; can be used to determine distances to galaxies on a large scale\nSun\nSummary\n26.1The Discovery of Galaxies\nFaint star clusters, clouds of glowing gas, and galaxies all appeared as faint patches of light (or nebulae) in the\ntelescopes available at the beginning of the twentieth century. It was only when Hubble measured the\ndistance to the Andromeda galaxy using cepheid variables with the giant 2.5-meter reflector on Mount Wilson\nin 1924 that the existence of other galaxies similar to the Milky Way in size and content was established.\n26.2Types of Galaxies\nThe majority of bright galaxies are either spirals or ellipticals. Spiral galaxies contain both old and young stars,\nas well as interstellar matter, and have typical masses in the range of 109to 1012M . Our own Galaxy is a\nSun\nlarge spiral. Ellipticals are spheroidal or slightly elongated systems that consist almost entirely of old stars,\nwith very little interstellar matter. Elliptical galaxies range in size from giants, more massive than any spiral,\ndown to dwarfs, with masses of only about 106M . Dwarf ellipticals are probably the most common type of\nSun\ngalaxy in the nearby universe. A small percentage of galaxies with more disorganized shapes are classified as\nirregulars. Galaxies may change their appearance over time due to collisions with other galaxies or by a\nchange in the rate of star formation.\n26.3Properties of Galaxies\nThe masses of spiral galaxies are determined from measurements of their rates of rotation. The masses of\nelliptical galaxies are estimated from analyses of the motions of the stars within them. Galaxies can be\ncharacterized by their mass-to-light ratios. The luminous parts of galaxies with active star formation typically\nhave mass-to-light ratios in the range of 1 to 10; the luminous parts of elliptical galaxies, which contain only\nold stars, typically have mass-to-light ratios of 10 to 20. The mass-to-light ratios of whole galaxies, including\ntheir outer regions, are as high as 100, indicating the presence of a great deal of dark matter.\n26.4The Extragalactic Distance Scale\nAstronomers determine the distances to galaxies using a variety of methods, including the period-luminosity\nrelationship for cepheid variables; objects such as type Ia supernovae, which appear to be standard bulbs; and\nthe Tully-Fisher relation, which connects the line broadening of 21-cm radiation to the luminosity of spiral\ngalaxies. Each method has limitations in terms of its precision, the kinds of galaxies with which it can be used,\nand the range of distances over which it can be applied.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 26 \u2022 For Further Exploration 895\n26.5The Expanding Universe\nThe universe is expanding. Observations show that the spectral lines of distant galaxies are redshifted, and\nthat their recession velocities are proportional to their distances from us, a relationship known as Hubble\u2019s\nlaw. The rate of recession, called the Hubble constant, is approximately 22 kilometers per second per million\nlight-years. We are not at the center of this expansion: an observer in any other galaxy would see the same\npattern of expansion that we do. The expansion described by Hubble\u2019s law is best understood as a stretching\nof space.\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nAndrews, B. \u201cWhat Are Galaxies Trying to Tell Us?\u201dAstronomy(February 2011): 24.

Throughout much of the last century, the 100-inch telescope on Mt. Wilson (completed in 1917) and the\n200-inch telescope on Palomar Mountain (completed in 1948) were the only ones large enough to obtain\nspectra of faint galaxies. Only a handful of astronomers (all male\u2014since, until the 1960s, women were not\ngiven time on these two telescopes) were allowed to use these facilities, and in general the observers did\nnot compete with each other but worked on different problems. Now there are many other telescopes,\nand several different groups do often work on the same problem.

They assumed that galaxies formed billions of years ago and then evolved slowly as the\npopulations of stars within them formed, aged, and died. That placid picture completely changed in the last\nfew decades of the twentieth century.\nToday, astronomers can see that the universe is often shaped by violent events, including cataclysmic\nexplosions of supernovae, collisions of whole galaxies, and the tremendous outpouring of energy as matter\ninteracts in the environment surrounding very massive black holes. The key event that began to change our\nview of the universe was the discovery of a new class of objects: quasars.\n27.1 Quasars\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe how quasars were discovered\nExplain how astronomers determined that quasars are at the distances implied by their redshifts\nJustify the statement that the enormous amount of energy produced by quasars is generated in a very\nsmall volume of space 900 27 \u2022 Active Galaxies, Quasars, and Supermassive Black Holes\nThe name \u201cquasars\u201d started out as short for \u201cquasi-stellar radio sources\u201d (here \u201cquasi-stellar\u201d means \u201csort of\nlike stars\u201d). The discovery of radio sources that appeared point-like, just like stars, came with the use of surplus\nWorld War II radar equipment in the 1950s. Although few astronomers would have predicted it, the sky turned\nout to be full of strong sources of radio waves. As they improved the images that their new radio telescopes\ncould make, scientists discovered that some radio sources were in the same location as faint blue \u201cstars.\u201d No\nknown type of star in our Galaxy emits such powerful radio radiation. What then were these \u201cquasi-stellar\nradio sources\u201d?\nRedshifts: The Key to Quasars\nThe answer came when astronomers obtained visible-light spectra of two of those faint \u201cblue stars\u201d that were\nstrong sources of radio waves (Figure 27.2). Spectra of these radio \u201cstars\u201d only deepened the mystery: they\nhad emission lines, but astronomers at first could not identify them with any known substance. By the 1960s,\nastronomers had a century of experience in identifying elements and compounds in the spectra of stars.\nElaborate tables had been published showing the lines that each element would produce under a wide range\nof conditions. A \u201cstar\u201d with unidentifiable lines in the ordinary visible light spectrum had to be something\ncompletely new.\nFigure27.2Typical Quasar.The arrow in this image marks the quasar known by its catalog number, PKS 1117-248. Note that\nnothing in this image distinguishes the quasar from an ordinary star. Its spectrum, however, shows that it is moving away from us at\na speed of 36% the speed of light, or 67,000 miles per second. In contrast, the maximum speed observed for any star is only a few\nhundred miles per second. (credit: modification of work by WIYN Telescope, Kitt Peak National Observatory, NOAO)\nIn 1963 at Caltech\u2019s Palomar Observatory, Maarten Schmidt (Figure 27.3) was puzzling over the spectrum of\none of the radio stars, which was named3C 273because it was the 273rd entry in the third Cambridge catalog\nof radio sources (part (b) ofFigure 27.3). There were strong emission lines in the spectrum, and Schmidt\nrecognized that they had the same spacing between them as the Balmer lines of hydrogen (seeRadiation and\nSpectra). But the lines in 3C 273 were shifted far to the red of the wavelengths at which the Balmer lines are\nnormally located. Indeed, these lines were at such long wavelengths that if the redshifts were attributed to the\nDoppler effect, 3C 273 was receding from us at a speed of 45,000 kilometers per second, or about 15% the\nspeed of light! Since stars don\u2019t show Doppler shifts this large, no one had thought of considering high\nredshifts to be the cause of the strange spectra.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 27.1 \u2022 Quasars 901\nFigure27.3Quasar Pioneers and Quasar 3C 273.(a) Maarten Schmidt (left), who solved the puzzle of the quasar spectra in 1963,\nshares a joke in this 1987 photo with Allan Sandage, who took the first spectrum of a quasar. Sandage was also instrumental in\nmeasuring the value of Hubble\u2019s constant. (b) This is the first quasar for which a redshift was measured. The redshift showed that\nthe light from it took about 2.5 billion years to reach us. Despite this great distance, it is still one of the quasars closest to the Milky\nWay Galaxy. Note also the faint streak going toward the upper left from the quasar. Some quasars, like3C 273, eject super-fast jets of\nmaterial. The jet from 3C 273 is about 200,000 light-years long. (credit a: modification of work by Andrew Fraknoi; credit b:\nmodification of work by ESA/Hubble/NASA)\nThe puzzling emission lines in other star-like radio sources were then reexamined to see if they, too, might be\nwell-known lines with large redshifts. This proved to be the case, but the other objects were found to be\nreceding from us at even greater speeds. Their astounding speeds showed that the radio \u201cstars\u201d could not\npossibly be stars in our own Galaxy. Any true star moving at more than a few hundred kilometers per second\nwould be able to overcome the gravitational pull of the Galaxy and completely escape from it. (As we shall see\nlater in this chapter, astronomers eventually discovered that there was also more to these \u201cstars\u201d than just a\npoint of light.)\nIt turns out that these high-velocity objects only look like stars because they are compact and very far away.\nLater, astronomers discovered objects with large redshifts that appear star-like but have no radio emission.\nObservations also showed that quasars were bright in the infrared and X-ray bands too, and not all these X-ray\nor infrared-bright quasars could be seen in either the radio or the visible-light bands of the spectrum. Today,\nall these objects are referred to asquasi-stellar objects(QSOs), or, as they are more popularly known,quasars.\n(The name was also soon appropriated by a manufacturer of home electronics.)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nReadan interview(https://openstax.org/l/30SchmidtIntv)with Maarten Schmidt on the fiftieth anniversary\nof his insight about the spectrum of quasars and their redshifts.\nOver a million quasars have now been discovered, and spectra are available for over a hundred thousand. All\nthese spectra show redshifts, none show blueshifts, and their redshifts can be very large. Yet in a photo they\nlook just like stars (Figure 27.4). 902 27 \u2022 Active Galaxies, Quasars, and Supermassive Black Holes\nFigure27.4Typical Quasar Imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope.One of these two bright \u201cstars\u201d in the middle is in our Galaxy,\nwhile the other is a quasar 9 billion light-years away. From this picture alone, there\u2019s no way to say which is which. (The quasar is the\none in the center of the picture.) (credit: Charles Steidel (CIT)/NASA/ESA)\nIn the record-holding quasars, the first Lyman series line of hydrogen, with a laboratory wavelength of 121.5\nnanometers in the ultraviolet portion of the spectrum, is shifted all the way through the visible region to the\ninfrared. At such high redshifts, the simple formula for converting aDoppler shiftto speed (Radiation and\nSpectra) must be modified to take into account the effects of the theory of relativity. If we apply the relativistic\nform of the Doppler shift formula, we find that these redshifts correspond to velocities of about 96% of the\nspeed of light.\nEXAMPLE 27.1\nRecession Speed of a Quasar\nThe formula for the Doppler shift, which astronomers denote by the lettersz, is\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength emitted by a source of radiation that is not moving, \u0394\u03bb is the difference between\nthat wavelength and the wavelength we measure,vis the speed with which the source moves away, andc\n(as usual) is the speed of light.\nA line in the spectrum of a galaxy is at a wavelength of 393 nanometers (nm, or 10\u20139m) when the source is\nat rest. Let\u2019s say the line is measured to be longer than this value (redshifted) by 7.86 nm. Then its redshift\n, so its speed away from us is 2% of the speed of light\nThis formula is fine for galaxies that are relatively nearby and are moving away from us slowly in the\nexpansion of the universe. But the quasars and distant galaxies we discuss in this chapter are moving away\nat speeds close to the speed of light. In that case, converting a Doppler shift (redshift) to a distance must\ninclude the effects of the special theory of relativity, which explains how measurements of space and time\nchange when we see things moving at high speeds. The details of how this is done are way beyond the level\nof this text, but we can share with you the relativistic formula for the Doppler shift:\nAccess for free at openstax.org 27.1 \u2022 Quasars 903\nLet\u2019s do an example. Suppose a distant quasar has a redshift of 3. At what fraction of the speed of light is\nthe quasar moving away?\nSolution\nWe calculate the following:\nThe quasar is thus receding from us at about 88% the speed of light.\nCheck Your Learning\nSeveral lines of hydrogen absorption in the visible spectrum have rest wavelengths of 410 nm, 434 nm, 486\nnm, and 656 nm. In a spectrum of a distant galaxy, these same lines are observed to have wavelengths of\n492 nm, 521 nm, 583 nm, and 787 nm respectively. What is the redshift of this galaxy? What is the recession\nspeed of this galaxy?\nAnswer:\nBecause this is the same galaxy, we could pick any one of the four wavelengths and calculate how much it\nhas shifted. If we use a rest wavelength of 410 nm and compare it to the shifted wavelength of 492 nm, we\nsee that\nIn the classical view, this galaxy is receding at 20% of the speed of light; however, at 20% of the speed of\nlight, relativistic effects are starting to become important. So, using the relativistic Doppler equation, we\ncompute the true recession rate as\nTherefore, the actual recession speed is only 18% of the speed of light. While this may not initially seem like\na big difference from the classical measurement, there is already an 11% deviation between the classical\nand the relativistic solutions; and at greater recession speeds, the divergence between the classical and\nrelativistic speeds increases rapidly!\nQuasars Obey the Hubble Law\nThe first question astronomers asked was whether quasars obeyed theHubble lawand were really at the large\ndistances implied by their redshifts. If they did not obey the rule that large redshift means large distance, then\nthey could be much closer, and their luminosity could be a lot less. One straightforward way to show that\nquasars had to obey the Hubble law was to demonstrate that they were actually part of galaxies, and that their\nredshift was the same as the galaxy that hosted them. Since ordinary galaxiesdoobey the Hubble law,\nanything within them would be subject to the same rules.\nObservations with theHubble Space Telescopeprovided the strongest evidence showing that quasars are\nlocated at the centers of galaxies. Hints that this is true had been obtained with ground-based telescopes, but\nspace observations were required to make a convincing case. The reason is that quasars can outshine their\nentire galaxies by factors of 10 to 100 or even more. When this light passes through Earth\u2019s atmosphere, it is\nblurred by turbulence and drowns out the faint light from the surrounding galaxy\u2014much as the bright\nheadlights from an oncoming car at night make it difficult to see anything close by. 904 27 \u2022 Active Galaxies, Quasars, and Supermassive Black Holes\nThe Hubble Space Telescope, however, is not affected by atmospheric turbulence and can detect the faint glow\nfrom some of the galaxies that host quasars (Figure 27.5). Quasars have been found in the cores of both spiral\nand elliptical galaxies, and each quasar has the same redshift as its host galaxy. A wide range of studies with\nthe Hubble Space Telescope now clearly demonstrate that quasars are indeed far away. If so, they must be\nproducing a truly impressive amount of energy to be detectable as points of light that are much brighter than\ntheir galaxy. Interestingly, many quasar host galaxies are found to be involved in a collision with a second\ngalaxy, providing, as we shall see, an important clue to the source of their prodigious energy output.\nFigure27.5Quasar Host Galaxies.The Hubble Space Telescope reveals the much fainter \u201chost\u201d galaxies around quasars. The top\nleft image shows a quasar that lies at the heart of a spiral galaxy 1.4 billion light-years from Earth. The bottom left image shows a\nquasar that lies at the center of an elliptical galaxy some 1.5 billion light-years from us. The middle images show remote pairs of\ninteracting galaxies, one of which harbors a quasar. Each of the right images shows long tails of gas and dust streaming away from a\ngalaxy that contains a quasar. Such tails are produced when one galaxy collides with another. (credit: modification of work by John\nBahcall, Mike Disney, NASA)\nThe Size of the Energy Source\nGiven their large distances, quasars have to be extremely luminous to be visible to us at all\u2014far brighter than\nany normal galaxy. In visible light alone, most are far more energetic than the brightest elliptical galaxies. But,\nas we saw, quasars also emit energy at X-ray and ultraviolet wavelengths, and some are radio sources as well.\nWhen all their radiation is added together, some QSOs have total luminosities as large as a hundred trillion\nSuns (1014L ), which is 10 to 100 times the brightness of luminous elliptical galaxies.\nSun\nFinding a mechanism to produce the large amount of energy emitted by a quasar would be difficult under any\ncircumstances. But there is an additional problem. When astronomers began monitoring quasars carefully,\nthey found that some vary in luminosity on time scales of months, weeks, or even, in some cases, days. This\nvariation is irregular and can change the brightness of a quasar by a few tens of percent in both its visible light\nand radio output.\nThink about what such a change in luminosity means. A quasar at its dimmest is still more brilliant than any\nnormal galaxy. Now imagine that the brightness increases by 30% in a few weeks. Whatever mechanism is\nresponsible must be able to release new energy at rates that stagger our imaginations. The most dramatic\nchanges in quasar brightness are equivalent to the energy released by 100,000 billion Suns. To produce this\nAccess for free at openstax.org 27.1 \u2022 Quasars 905\nmuch energy we would have to convert the total mass of about ten Earths into energy every minute.\nMoreover, because the fluctuations occur in such short times, the part of a quasar that is varying must be\nsmaller than the distance light travels in the time it takes the variation to occur\u2014typically a few months. To see\nwhy this must be so, let\u2019s consider a cluster of stars 10 light-years in diameter at a very large distance from\nEarth (seeFigure 27.6, in which Earth is off to the right). Suppose every star in this cluster somehow brightens\nsimultaneously and remains bright. When the light from this event arrives at Earth, we would first see the\nbrighter light from stars on the near side; 5 years later we would see increased light from stars at the center.\nTen years would pass before we detected more light from stars on the far side.\nFigure27.6How the Size of a Source Affects the Timescale of Its Variability.This diagram shows why light variations from a\nlarge region in space appear to last for an extended period of time as viewed from Earth. Suppose all the stars in this cluster, which\nis 10 light-years across, brighten simultaneously and instantaneously. From Earth, starAwill appear to brighten 5 years before star\nB, which in turn will appear to brighten 5 years earlier than starC. It will take 10 years for an Earth observer to get the full effect of\nthe brightening.\nEven though all stars in the cluster brightened at the same time, the fact that the cluster is 10 light-years wide\nmeans that 10 years must elapse before the increased light from every part of the cluster reaches us. From\nEarth we would see the cluster get brighter and brighter, as light from more and more stars began to reach\nus. Not until 10 years after the brightening began would we see the cluster reach maximum brightness. In\nother words, if an extended object suddenly flares up, it will seem to brighten over a period of time equal to\nthe time it takes light to travel across the object from its far side.\nWe can apply this idea to brightness changes in quasars to estimate their diameters. Because quasars typically\nvary (get brighter and dimmer) over periods of a few months, the region where the energy is generated can\nbe no larger than a few light-months across. If it were larger, it would take longer than a few months for the\nlight from the far side to reach us.\nHow large is a region of a few light-months? Pluto, usually the outermost (dwarf) planet in our solar system, is\nabout 5.5 light-hours from us, while the nearest star is 4 light-years away. Clearly a region a few light months\nacross is tiny relative to the size of the entire Galaxy. And some quasars vary even more rapidly, which means\ntheir energy is generated in an even smaller region. Whatever mechanism powers the quasars must be able to\ngenerate more energy than that produced by an entire galaxy in a volume of space that, in some cases, is not\nmuch larger than our solar system.\nEarlier Evidence\nEven before the discovery of quasars, there had been hints that something very strange was going on in the\ncenters of at least some galaxies. Back in 1918, American astronomer HeberCurtisused the large Lick\nObservatory telescope to photograph the galaxy Messier 87 in the constellation Virgo. On that photograph, he\nsaw what we now call a jet coming from the center, or nucleus, of the galaxy (Figure 27.7). This jet literally and\nfiguratively pointed to some strange activity going on in that galaxy nucleus. But he had no idea what it was. 906 27 \u2022 Active Galaxies, Quasars, and Supermassive Black Holes\nNo one else knew what to do with this space oddity either.\nThe random factoid that such a central jet existed lay around for a quarter century, until CarlSeyfert, a young\nastronomer at Mount Wilson Observatory, also in California, found half a dozen galaxies with extremely bright\nnuclei that were almost stellar, rather than fuzzy in appearance like most galaxy nuclei. Using spectroscopy, he\nfound that these nuclei contain gas moving at up to two percent the speed of light. That may not sound like\nmuch, but it is 6 million miles per hour, and more than 10 times faster than the typical motions of stars in\ngalaxies.\nFigure27.7M87 Jet.Streaming out like a cosmic searchlight from the center of the galaxy,M87is one of nature\u2019s most amazing\nphenomena, a huge jet of electrons and other particles traveling at nearly the speed of light. In this Hubble Space Telescope image,\nthe blue of the jet contrasts with the yellow glow from the combined light of billions of unseen stars and yellow, point-like globular\nclusters that make up the galaxy (at the upper left). As we shall see later in this chapter, the jet, which is several thousand light-years\nlong, originates in a disk of superheated gas swirling around a giant black hole at the center of M87. The light that we see is\nproduced by electrons twisting along magnetic field lines in the jet, a process known as synchrotron radiation, which gives the jet its\nbluish tint. The jet in M87 can be observed in X-ray, radio, and visible light, as shown in the bottom three images. At the extreme left\nof each bottom image, we see the bright galactic nucleus harboring a supermassive black hole.

Perlman (UMBC), et al.)\nAfter decades of study, astronomers identified many other strange objects beyond our Milky Way Galaxy; they\npopulate a whole \u201czoo\u201d of what are now calledactive galaxiesoractive galactic nuclei (AGN). Astronomers\nfirst called them by many different names, depending on what sorts of observations discovered each category,\nbut now we know that we are always looking at the same basic mechanism. What all these galaxies have in\ncommon is some activity in their nuclei that produces an enormous amount of energy in a very small volume\nof space. In the next section, we describe a model that explains all these galaxies with strong central\nactivity\u2014both the AGNs and the QSOs.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTo see a jet for yourself, check out atime-lapse video(https://openstax.org/l/30timelapsejet)of the jet\nejected from NGC 3862.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 27.2 \u2022 Supermassive Black Holes: What Quasars Really Are 907\n27.2 Supermassive Black Holes: What Quasars Really Are\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the characteristics common to all quasars\nJustify the claim that supermassive black holes are the source of the energy emitted by quasars (and\nAGNs)\nExplain how a quasar\u2019s energy is produced\nIn order to find a common model forquasars (and their cousins, the AGNs), let\u2019s first list the common\ncharacteristics we have been describing\u2014and add some new ones:\n\u2022 Quasars are hugely powerful, emitting more power in radiated light than all the stars in our Galaxy\ncombined.\n\u2022 Quasars are tiny, about the size of our solar system (to astronomers, that is really small!).\n\u2022 Some quasars are observed to be shooting out pairs of straight jets at close to the speed of light, in a tight\nbeam, to distances far beyond the galaxies they live in. These jets are themselves powerful sources of\nradio and gamma-ray radiation.\n\u2022 Because quasars put out so much power from such a small region, they can\u2019t be powered by nuclear\nfusion the way stars are; they must use some process that is far more efficient.\n\u2022 As we shall see later in this chapter, quasars were much more common when the universe was young\nthan they are today. That means they must have been able to form in the first billion years or so after the\nuniverse began to expand.\nThe readers of this text are in a much better position than the astronomers who discovered quasars in the\n1960s to guess what powers the quasars. That\u2019s because the key idea in solving the puzzle came from\nobservations of the black holes we discussed inBlack Holes and Curved Spacetime. The discovery of the first\nstellar mass black hole in the binary system Cygnus X-1 was announced in 1971, several years after the\ndiscovery of quasars. Proof that there is a black hole at the center of our own Galaxy came even later. Back\nwhen astronomers first began trying to figure out what powered quasars, black holes were simply one of the\nmore exotic predictions of the general theory of relativity that still waited to be connected to the real world.\nIt was only as proof of the existence of black holes accumulated over several decades that it became clearer\nthat onlysupermassive black holes could account for all the observed properties of quasars and AGNs. As we\nsaw inThe Milky Way Galaxy, our own Galaxy has a black hole in its center, and the energy is emitted from a\nsmall central region. While our black hole doesn\u2019t have the mass or energy of the quasar black holes, the\nmechanism that powers them is similar. The evidence now shows that most\u2014and probably all\u2014elliptical\ngalaxies and all spirals with nuclear bulges have black holes at their centers. The amount of energy emitted by\nmaterial near the black hole depends on two things: the mass of the black hole and the amount of matter that\nis falling into it.\nIf a black hole with a billion Suns\u2019 worth of mass inside (109M ) accretes (gathers) even a relatively modest\nSun\namount of additional material\u2014say, about 10M per year\u2014then (as we shall see) it can, in the process,\nSun\nproduce as much energy as a thousand normal galaxies. This is enough to account for the total energy of a\nquasar. If the mass of the black hole is smaller than a billion solar masses or the accretion rate is low, then the\namount of energy emitted can be much smaller, as it is in the case of the Milky Way.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch avideo(https://openstax.org/l/30mataccrsupblh)of an artist\u2019s impression of matter accreting 908 27 \u2022 Active Galaxies, Quasars, and Supermassive Black Holes\naround a supermassive black hole.\nObservational Evidence for Black Holes\nIn order to prove that ablack holeis present at the center of a galaxy, we must demonstrate that so much\nmass is crammed into so small a volume that no normal objects\u2014massive stars or clusters of stars\u2014could\npossibly account for it (just as we did for the black hole in the Milky Way). We already know from observations\n(discussed inBlack Holes and Curved Spacetime) that an accreting black hole is surrounded by a hotaccretion\ndiskwith gas and dust that swirl around the black hole before it falls in.\nIf we assume that the energy emitted by quasars is also produced by a hotaccretion disk, then, as we saw in\nthe previous section, the size of the disk must be given by the time the quasar energy takes to vary. For\nquasars, the emission in visible light varies on typical time scales of 5 to 2000 days, limiting the size of the disk\nto that many light-days.\nIn the X-ray band, quasars vary even more rapidly, so the light travel time argument tells us that this more\nenergetic radiation is generated in an even smaller region. Therefore, the mass around which the accretion\ndisk is swirling must be confined to a space that is even smaller. If the quasar mechanism involves a great deal\nof mass, then the only astronomical object that can confine a lot of mass into a very small space is a black hole.\nIn a few cases, it turns out that the X-rays are emitted from a region just a few times the size of the black hole\nevent horizon.\nThe next challenge, then, is to \u201cweigh\u201d this central mass in a quasar. In the case of our own Galaxy, we used\nobservations of the orbits of stars very close to the galactic center, along with Kepler\u2019s third law, to estimate\nthe mass of the central black hole (The Milky Way Galaxy). In the case of distant galaxies, we cannot measure\nthe orbits of individual stars, but we can measure the orbital speed of the gas in the rotating accretion disk.\nTheHubble Space Telescopeis especially well suited to this task because it is above the blurring of Earth\u2019s\natmosphere and can obtain spectra very close to the bright central regions of active galaxies. The Doppler\neffect is then used to measure radial velocities of the orbiting material and so derive the speed with which it\nmoves around.\nOne of the first galaxies to be studied with the Hubble Space Telescope is our old favorite, the giant elliptical\nM87. Hubble Space Telescope images showed that there is a disk of hot (10,000 K) gas swirling around the\ncenter of M87 (Figure 27.8). It was surprising to find hot gas in an elliptical galaxy because this type of galaxy is\nusually devoid of gas and dust. But the discovery was extremely useful for pinning down the existence of the\nblack hole. Astronomers measured the Doppler shift of spectral lines emitted by this gas, found its speed of\nrotation, and then used the speed to derive the amount of mass inside the disk\u2014applying Kepler\u2019s third law.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 27.2 \u2022 Supermassive Black Holes: What Quasars Really Are 909\nFigure27.8Evidence for a Black Hole at the Center of M87.(a) The disk of whirling gas at right was discovered at the center of the\ngiant elliptical galaxyM87with the Hubble Space Telescope. Observations made on opposite sides of the disk show that one side is\napproaching us (the spectral lines are blueshifted by the Doppler effect) while the other is receding (lines redshifted), a clear\nindication that the disk is rotating. The rotation speed is about 550 kilometers per second or 1.2 million miles per hour. Such a high\nrotation speed is evidence that there is a very massive black hole at the center of M87. (b) By 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope, a\ncollaborative venture among radio telescopes spanning our planet, was able to produce the first radio image of the shadow of the\nM87 black hole on the accretion disk surrounding it. This was taken with radio waves, so color is arbitrary. The shadow is about 2 \u00bd\ntimes as big as the event horizon of the supermassive black hole.

So much mass in such a small volume of space must be a black hole. Let\u2019s stop for a moment\nand take in this figure: a single black hole that has swallowed enough material to make 3.5 billion stars like the\nSun. Few astronomical measurements have ever led to so mind-boggling a result. What a strange environment\nthe neighborhood of such a supermassive black hole must be.\nAnother example is shown inFigure 27.9. Here, we see a disk of dust and gas that surrounds a\n300-million-M black hole in the center of an elliptical galaxy. (The bright spot in the center is produced by\nSun\nthe combined light of stars that have been pulled close together by the gravitational force of the black hole.)\nThe mass of the black hole was again derived from measurements of the rotational speed of the disk. The gas\nin the disk is moving around at 155 kilometers per second at a distance of only 186 light-years from its center.\nGiven the pull of the mass at the center, we expect that the whole dust disk should be swallowed by the black\nhole in several billion years. 910 27 \u2022 Active Galaxies, Quasars, and Supermassive Black Holes\nFigure27.9Another Galaxy with a Black-Hole Disk.The ground-based image shows an elliptical galaxy called NGC 7052 located in\nthe constellation of Vulpecula, almost 200 million light-years from Earth. At the galaxy\u2019s center (right) is a dust disk roughly 3700\nlight-years in diameter. The disk rotates like a giant merry-go-round: gas in the inner part (186 light-years from the center) whirls\naround at a speed of 155 kilometers per second (341,000 miles per hour). From these measurements and Kepler\u2019s third law, it is\npossible to estimate that the disk is orbiting around a central black hole with a mass of 300 million Suns. (credit: modification of work\nby Roeland P. van der Marel (STScI), Frank C. van den Bosch (University of Washington), NASA)\nBut do wehaveto accept black holes as the only explanation of what lies at the center of these galaxies? What\nelse could we put in such a small space other than a giant black hole? The alternative is stars. But to explain\nthe masses in the centers of galaxies without a black hole we need to put at least a million stars in a region the\nsize of the solar system. To fit, they would have be only 2 star diameters apart. Collisions between stars would\nhappen all the time. And these collisions would lead to mergers of stars, and very soon the one giant star that\nthey form would collapse into a black hole. So there is really no escape: only a black hole can fit so much mass\ninto so small a space.\nAs we saw earlier, observations now show that all the galaxies with a spherical concentration of stars\u2014either\nelliptical galaxies or spiral galaxies with nuclear bulges (see the chapter onGalaxies)\u2014harbor one of these\ngiant black holes at their centers. Among them is our neighbor spiral galaxy, theAndromeda galaxy, M31. The\nmasses of these central black holes range from a just under a million up to at least 30 billion times the mass of\nthe Sun. Several black holes may be even more massive, but the mass estimates have large uncertainties and\nneed verification. We call these black holes \u201csupermassive\u201d to distinguish them from the much smaller black\nholes that form when some stars die (seeThe Death of Stars). So far, the most massive black holes from\nstars\u2014those detected through gravitational waves detected by LIGO\u2014have masses of about 40 solar masses.\nEnergy Production around a Black Hole\nBy now, you may be willing to entertain the idea that huge black holes lurk at the centers of active galaxies.\nBut we still need to answer the question of how such a black hole can account for one of the most powerful\nsources of energy in the universe. As we saw inBlack Holes and Curved Spacetime, a black hole itself can\nradiate no energy. Any energy we detect from it must come from material very close to the black hole, but not\ninside itsevent horizon.\nIn a galaxy, a centralblack hole(with its strong gravity) attracts matter\u2014stars, dust, and gas\u2014orbiting in the\ndense nuclear regions. This matter spirals in toward the spinning black hole and forms an accretion disk of\nmaterial around it. As the material spirals ever closer to the black hole, it accelerates and becomes\ncompressed, heating up to temperatures of millions of degrees. Such hot matter can radiate prodigious\namounts of energy as it falls in toward the black hole.\nTo convince yourself that falling into a region with strong gravity can release a great deal of energy, imagine\nAccess for free at openstax.org 27.2 \u2022 Supermassive Black Holes: What Quasars Really Are 911\ndropping a printed version of your astronomy textbook out the window of the ground floor of the library. It\nwill land with a thud, and maybe give a surprised pigeon a nasty bump, but the energy released by its fall will\nnot be very great. Now take the same book up to the fifteenth floor of a tall building and drop it from there.\nFor anyone below, astronomy could suddenly become a deadly subject; when the book hits, it does so with a\ngreat deal of energy.\nDropping things from far away into the much stronger gravity of a black hole is much more effective in turning\nthe energy released by infall into other forms of energy. Just as the falling book can heat up the air, shake the\nground, or produce sound energy that can be heard some distance away, so the energy of material falling\ntoward a black hole can be converted to significant amounts of electromagnetic radiation.\nWhat a black hole has to work with is not textbooks but streams of infalling gas. If a dense blob of gas moves\nthrough a thin gas at high speed, it heats up as it slows by friction. As it slows down, kinetic (motion) energy is\nturned into heat energy. Just like a spaceship reentering the atmosphere (Figure 27.10), gas approaching a\nblack hole heats up and glows where it meets other gas. But this gas, as it approaches the event horizon,\nreaches speeds of 10% the speed of light and more. It therefore gets far, far hotter than a spaceship, which\nreaches no more than about 1500 K. Indeed, gas near a supermassive black hole reaches a temperature of\nabout 150,000 K, about 100 times hotter than a spaceship returning to Earth. It can even get so hot\u2014millions\nof degrees\u2014that it radiates X-rays.\nFigure27.10Friction in Earth\u2019s Atmosphere.In this artist\u2019s impression, the rapid motion of a spacecraft (the Apollo mission\nreentry capsule) through the atmosphere compresses and heats the air ahead of it, which heats the spacecraft in turn until it glows\nred hot. Pushing on the air slows down the spacecraft, turning the kinetic energy of the spacecraft into heat. Fast-moving gas falling\ninto a quasar heats up in a similar way. (credit: modification of work by NASA)\nThe amount of energy that can be liberated this way is enormous. Einstein showed that mass and energy are\ninterchangeable with his famous formulaE = mc2(seeThe Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse). A hydrogen bomb\nreleases just 1% of that energy, as does a star. Quasars are much more efficient than that. The energy released\nfalling to the event horizon of a black hole can easily reach 10% or, in the extreme theoretical limit, 32%, of that\nenergy. (Unlike the hydrogen atoms in a bomb or a star, the gas falling into the black hole is not actually losing\nmass from its atoms to free up the energy; the energy is produced just because the gas is falling closer and\ncloser to the black hole.) This huge energy release explains how a tiny volume like the region around a black\nhole can release as much power as a whole galaxy. But to radiate all that energy, instead of just falling inside\nthe event horizon with barely a peep, the hot gas must take the time to swirl around the star in the accretion\ndisk and emit some of its energy.\nMost black holes don\u2019t show any signs of quasar emission. We call them \u201cquiescent.\u201d But, like sleeping\ndragons, they can be woken up by being roused with a fresh supply of gas. Our own Milky Way black hole is\ncurrentlyquiescent, but it may have been a quasar just a few million years ago (Figure 27.11). Two giant\nbubbles that extend 25,000 light-years above and below the galactic center are emitting gamma rays. Were 912 27 \u2022 Active Galaxies, Quasars, and Supermassive Black Holes\nthese produced a few million years ago when a significant amount of matter fell into the black hole at the\ncenter of the galaxy? Astronomers are still working to understand what remarkable event might have formed\nthese enormous bubbles.\nFigure27.11Fermi Bubbles in the Galaxy.Giant bubbles shining in gamma-ray light lie above and below the center of theMilky\nWay Galaxy, as seen by the Fermi satellite. (The gamma-ray and X-ray image is superimposed on a visible-light image of the inner\nparts of our Galaxy.) The bubbles may be evidence that the supermassive black hole at the center of our Galaxy was a quasar a few\nmillion years ago. (credit: modification of work by NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center)\nThe physics required to account for the exact way in which the energy ofinfalling materialis converted to\nradiation near a black hole is far more complicated than our simple discussion suggests. To understand what\nhappens in the \u201crough and tumble\u201d region around a massive black hole, astronomers and physicists must\nresort to computer simulations (and they require supercomputers, fast machines capable of awesome\nnumbers of calculations per second). The details of these models are beyond the scope of our book, but they\nsupport the basic description presented here.\nRadio Jets\nSo far, our model seems to explain the central energy source in quasars and active galaxies. But, as we have\nseen, there is more to quasars and other active galaxies than the point-like energy source. They can also have\nlongjetsthat glow with radio waves, light, and sometimes even X-rays, and that extend far beyond the limits of\nthe parent galaxy. Can we find a way for our black hole and its accretion disk to produce these jets of energetic\nparticles as well?\nMany different observations have now traced these jets to within 3 to 30 light-years of the parent quasar or\ngalactic nucleus. While the black hole and accretion disk are typically smaller than 1 light-year, we nevertheless\npresume that if the jets come this close, they probably originate in the vicinity of the black hole. Another\ncharacteristic of the jets we need to explain is that they contain matter moving close to the speed of light.\nWhy are energetic electrons and other particles near a supermassive black hole ejected into jets, and often\ninto two oppositely directed jets, rather than in all directions? Again, we must use theoretical models and\nsupercomputer simulations of what happens when a lot of material whirls inward in a crowded black hole\naccretion disk. Although there is no agreement on exactly how jets form, it has become clear that any material\nescaping from the neighborhood of the black hole has an easier time doing soperpendicular tothe disk.\nIn some ways, the inner regions of black holeaccretion disks resemble a baby that is just learning to eat by\nAccess for free at openstax.org 27.2 \u2022 Supermassive Black Holes: What Quasars Really Are 913\nherself. As much food as goes into the baby\u2019s mouth can sometimes wind up being spit out in various\ndirections. In the same way, some of the material whirling inward toward a black hole finds itself under\ntremendous pressure and orbiting with tremendous speed. Under such conditions, simulations show that a\nsignificant amount of material can be flung outward\u2014not back along the disk, where more material is\ncrowding in, but above and below the disk. If the disk is thick (as it tends to be when a lot of material falls in\nquickly), it can channel the outrushing material into narrow beams perpendicular to the disk (Figure 27.12).\nFigure27.12Models of Accretion Disks.These schematic drawings show whataccretion disks might look like around large black\nholes for (a) a thin accretion disk and (b) a \u201cfat\u201d disk\u2014the type needed to account for channeling the outflow of hot material into\nnarrow jets oriented perpendicular to the disk.\nFigure 27.13shows observations of an elliptical galaxy that behaves in exactly this way. At the center of this\nactive galaxy, there is a ring of dust and gas about 400 light-years in diameter, surrounding a 1.2-billion-M\nSun\nblack hole. Radio observations show that two jets emerge in a direction perpendicular to the ring, just as the\nmodel predicts. 914 27 \u2022 Active Galaxies, Quasars, and Supermassive Black Holes\nFigure27.13Jets and Disk in an Active Galaxy.The picture on the left shows the active elliptical galaxy NGC 4261, which is located\nin theVirgo Clusterat a distance of about 100 million light-years.

Many more new discoveries lay\nahead.\nAs MaartenSchmidtreminisced in 1988, \u201cThis had, I believe, a profound impact on the conduct of those\npracticing astronomy. Before the 1960s, there was much authoritarianism in the field. New ideas expressed\nat meetings would be instantly judged by senior astronomers and rejected if too far out.\u201d We saw a good\nexample of this in the trouble Chandrasekhar had in finding acceptance for his ideas about the death of\nstars with cores greater than 1.4M (see the feature box onSubrahmanyan Chandrasekhar).\nSun\n\u201cThe discoveries of the 1960s,\u201d Schmidt continued, \u201cwere an embarrassment, in the sense that they were\ntotally unexpected and could not be evaluated immediately. In reaction to these developments, an attitude\nhas evolved where even outlandish ideas in astronomy are taken seriously. Given our lack of solid\n1\nknowledge in extragalactic astronomy, this is probably to be preferred over authoritarianism.\u201d\nThat is not to say that astronomers (being human) don\u2019t continue to have prejudices and preferences. For\nexample, a small group of astronomers who thought that the redshifts of quasars were not connected with\ntheir distances (which was definitely a minority opinion) often felt excluded from meetings or from access\nto telescopes in the 1960s and 1970s. It\u2019s not so clear that they actuallywere excluded, as much as that they\nfelt the very difficult pressure of knowing that most of their colleagues strongly disagreed with them. As it\n1 M. Schmidt, \u201cThe Discovery of Quasars,\u201d inModern Cosmology in Retrospect, ed. B. Bertotti et al. (Cambridge University Press,\n1990).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 27.3 \u2022 Quasars as Probes of Evolution in the Universe 915\nturned out, the evidence\u2014which must ultimately decide all scientific questions\u2014was not on their side\neither.\nBut today, as better instruments bring solutions to some problems and starkly illuminate our ignorance\nabout others, the entire field of astronomy seems more open to discussing unusual ideas. Of course, before\nany hypotheses become accepted, they must be tested\u2014again and again\u2014against the evidence that nature\nitself reveals. Still, the many strange proposals published about what dark matter might be (seeThe\nEvolution and Distribution of Galaxies) attest to the new openness that Schmidt described.\nWith this black hole model, we have come a long way toward understanding the quasars and active galaxies\nthat seemed very mysterious only a few decades ago. As often happens in astronomy, a combination of better\ninstruments (making better observations) and improved theoretical models enabled us to make significant\nprogress on a puzzling aspect of the cosmos.\n27.3 Quasars as Probes of Evolution in the Universe\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nTrace the rise and fall of quasars over cosmic time\nDescribe some of the ways in which galaxies and black holes influence each other\u2019s growth\nDescribe some ways the first black holes may have formed\nExplain why some black holes are not producing quasar emission but rather are quiescent\nThe quasars\u2019 brilliance and large distance make them ideal probes of the far reaches of the universe and its\nremote past. Recall that when first introducing quasars, we mentioned that they generally tend to be far away.\nWhen we see extremely distant objects, we are seeing them as they were long ago. Radiation from a quasar 8\nbillion light-years away is telling us what that quasar and its environment were like 8 billion years ago, much\ncloser to the time that the galaxy that surrounds it first formed. Astronomers have now detected light emitted\nfrom quasars that were already formed only a few hundred million years after the universe began its\nexpansion 13.8 billion years ago. Thus, they give us a remarkable opportunity to learn about the time when\nlarge structures were first assembling in the cosmos.\nThe Evolution of Quasars\nQuasars provide compelling evidence that we live in an evolving universe\u2014one that changes with time. They\ntell us that astronomers living billions of years ago would have seen a universe that is very different from the\nuniverse of today. Counts of the number ofquasarsat different redshifts (and thus at different times in the\nevolution of the universe) show us how dramatic these changes are (Figure 27.14). We now know that the\nnumber of quasars was greatest at the time when the universe was only 20% of its present age. 916 27 \u2022 Active Galaxies, Quasars, and Supermassive Black Holes\nFigure27.14Relative Number of Quasars and Rate at Which Stars Formed as a Function of the Age of the Universe.An age of\n0 on the plots corresponds to the beginning of the universe; an age of 13.8 corresponds to the present time. Both the number of\nquasars and the rate of star formation were at a peak when the universe was about 20% as old as it is now.\nAs you can see, the drop-off in the numbers of quasars as time gets nearer to the present day is quite abrupt.\nObservations also show that the emission from the accretion disks around the most massive black holes peaks\nearly and then fades. The most powerful quasars are seen only at early times. In order to explain this result,\nwe make use of our model of the energy source of the quasars\u2014namely that quasars are black holes with\nenough fuel to make a brilliantaccretion diskright around them.\nThe fact that there were more quasars long ago (far away) than there are today (nearby) could be explained if\nthere was more material available to be accreted by black holes early in the history of the universe. You might\nsay that the quasars were more active when their black holes had fuel for their \u201cenergy-producing engines.\u201d If\nthat fuel was mostly consumed in the first few billion years after the universe began its expansion, then later\nin its life, a \u201chungry\u201d black hole would have very little left with which to light up the galaxy\u2019s central regions.\nIn other words, if matter in the accretion disk is continually being depleted by falling into the black hole or\nbeing blown out from the galaxy in the form of jets, then a quasar can continue to radiate only as long as new\ngas is available to replenish the accretion disk.\nIn fact, therewasmore gas around to be accreted early in the history of the universe. Back then, most gas had\nnot yet collapsed to form stars, so there was more fuel available for both the feeding of black holes and the\nforming of new stars. Much of that fuel was subsequently consumed in the formation of stars during the first\nfew billion years after the universe began its expansion. Later in its life, a galaxy would have little left to feed a\nhungry black hole or to form more new stars. As we see fromFigure 27.14, both star formation and black hole\ngrowth peaked together when the universe was about 2 billion years old. Ever since, both have been in sharp\ndecline. We are late to the party of the galaxies and have missed some of the early excitement.\nObservations of nearer galaxies (seen later in time) indicate that there is another source of fuel for the central\nblack holes\u2014the collision of galaxies. If two galaxies of similar mass collide and merge, or if a smaller galaxy is\npulled into a larger one, then gas and dust from one may come close enough to the black hole in the other to\nbe devoured by it and so provide the necessary fuel. Astronomers have found that collisions were also much\nmore common early in the history of the universe than they are today. There were more small galaxies in\nthose early times because over time, as we shall see (inThe Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies), small\ngalaxies tend to combine into larger ones. Again, this means that we would expect to see more quasars long\nago (far away) than we do today (nearby)\u2014as we in fact do.\nCodependence of Black Holes and Galaxies\nOnceblack holemasses began to be measured reliably in the late 1990s, they posed an enigma. It looked as\nthough the mass of the central black hole depended on the mass of the galaxy. The black holes in galaxies\nalways seem to be just 1/200 the mass of the galaxy they live in. This result is shown schematically inFigure\nAccess for free at openstax.org 27.3 \u2022 Quasars as Probes of Evolution in the Universe 917\n27.15, and some of the observations are plotted inFigure 27.16.\nFigure27.15Relationship between Black Hole Mass and the Mass of the Host Galaxy.Observations show that there is a close\ncorrelation between the mass of the black hole at the center of a galaxy and the mass of the spherical distribution of stars that\nsurrounds the black hole. That spherical distribution may be in the form of either an elliptical galaxy or the central bulge of a spiral\ngalaxy. (credit: modification of work by K. Cordes, S. Brown (STScI))\nFigure27.16Correlation between the Mass of the Central Black Hole and the Mass Contained within the Bulge of Stars\nSurrounding the Black Hole, Using Data from Real Galaxies.The black hole always turns out to be about 1/200 the mass of the\nstars surrounding it. The horizontal and vertical bars surrounding each point show the uncertainty of the measurement. (credit:\nmodification of work by Nicholas J. McConnell, Chung-Pei Ma, \u201cRevisiting the Scaling Relations of Black Hole Masses and Host Galaxy\nProperties,\u201dThe Astrophysical Journal, 764:184 (14 pp.), February 20, 2013.)\nSomehow black hole mass and the mass of the surrounding bulge of stars are connected. But why does this\ncorrelation exist? Unfortunately, astronomers do not yet know the answer to this question. We do know,\nhowever, that the black hole can influence the rate of star formation in the galaxy, and that the properties of\nthe surrounding galaxy can influence how fast the black hole grows. Let\u2019s see how these processes work. 918 27 \u2022 Active Galaxies, Quasars, and Supermassive Black Holes\nHow a Galaxy Can Influence a Black Hole in Its Center\nLet\u2019s look first at how the surrounding galaxy might influence the growth and size of the black hole. Without\nlarge quantities of fresh \u201cfood,\u201d the surroundings of black holes glow only weakly as bits of local material\nspiral inward toward the black hole. So somehow large amounts of gas have to find their way to the black hole\nfrom the galaxy in order to feed the quasar and make it grow and give off the energy to be noticed. Where\ndoes this \u201cfood\u201d for the black hole come from originally and how might it be replenished? The jury is still out,\nbut the options are pretty clear.\nOne obvious source of fuel for the black hole is matter from the host galaxy itself. Galaxies start out with large\namounts of interstellar gas and dust, and at least some of this interstellar matter is gradually converted into\nstars as the galaxy evolves. On the other hand, as stars go through their lives and die, they lose mass all the\ntime into the space between them, thereby returning some of the gas and dust to the interstellar medium. We\nexpect to find more gas and dust in the central regions early in a galaxy\u2019s life than later on, when much of it\nhas been converted into stars. Any of the interstellar matter that ventures too close to the black hole may be\naccreted by it. This means that we would expect that the number and luminosity of quasars powered in this\nway would decline with time. And as we have seen, that is just what we find.\nToday bothelliptical galaxiesand thenuclear bulgesofspiral galaxieshave very little raw material left to serve\nas a source of fuel for the black hole. And most of the giant black holes in nearby galaxies, including the one in\nour own Milky Way, are now dark and relatively quiet\u2014mere shadows of their former selves. So that fits with\nour observations.\nWe should note that even if you have a quiescent supermassive black hole, a star in the area could occasionally\nget close to it. Then the powerful tidal forces of the black hole can pull the whole star apart into a stream of\ngas. This stream quickly forms an accretion disk that gives off energy in the normal way and makes the black\nhole region into a temporary quasar. However, the material will fall into the black hole after only a few weeks\nor months. The black hole then goes back into its lurking, quiescent state, until another victim wanders by.\nThis sort of \u201ccannibal\u201d event happens only once every 100,000 years or so in a typical galaxy. But we can\nmonitor millions of galaxies in the sky, so a few of these \u201ctidal disruption events\u201d are found each year (Figure\n27.17). However, these individual events, dramatic as they are, are too rare to account for the huge masses of\nthe central black holes.\nFigure27.17A Black Hole Snacks on a Star.This artist\u2019s impression shows three stages of a star (red) swinging too close to a giant\nblack hole (black circle). The star starts off (top left) in its normal spherical shape, then begins to be pulled into a long football shape\nAccess for free at openstax.org 27.3 \u2022 Quasars as Probes of Evolution in the Universe 919\nby tides raised by the black hole (center). When the star gets closer still, the tides become stronger than the gravity holding the star\ntogether, and it breaks up into a streamer (right). Much of the star\u2019s matter forms a temporary accretion disk that lights up as a\nquasar for a few weeks or months. (credit: modification of work by NASA/CXC/M. Weiss)\nAnother source of fuel for the black hole is the collision of its host galaxy with another galaxy. Some of the\nbrightest galaxies turn out, when a detailed picture is taken, to be pairs of colliding galaxies. And most of them\nhave quasars inside them, not easily visible to us because they are buried by enormous amounts of dust and\ngas.\nA collision between two cars creates quite a mess, pushing parts out of their regular place. In the same way, if\ntwo galaxies collide and merge, then gas and dust (though not so much the stars) can get pushed out of their\nregular orbits. Some may veer close enough to the black hole in one galaxy or the other to be devoured by it\nand so provide the necessary fuel to power a quasar. As we saw, galaxy collisions and mergers happened most\nfrequently when the universe was young and probably help account for the fact that quasars were most\ncommon when the universe was only about 20% of its current age.\nCollisions in today\u2019s universe are less frequent, but they do happen. Once a galaxy reaches the size of the\nMilky Way, most of the galaxies it merges with will be much smaller galaxies\u2014dwarf galaxies(see the chapter\nonGalaxies). These don\u2019t disrupt the big galaxy much, but they can supply some additional gas to its black\nhole.\nBy the way, if two galaxies, each of which contains a black hole, collide, then the two black holes may merge\nand form an even larger black hole (Figure 27.18). In this process they will emit a burst of gravitational waves.\nOne of the main goals of the European Space Agency\u2019s planned LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna)\nmission is to detect the gravitational wave signals from the merging of supermassive black holes.\nFigure27.18Colliding Galaxies with Two Black Holes.We compare Hubble Space Telescope visible-light (left) and Chandra X-ray\n(right) images of the central regions of NGC 6240, a galaxy about 400 million light-years away. It is a prime example of a galaxy in\nwhich stars are forming, evolving, and exploding at an exceptionally rapid rate due to a relatively recent merger (30 million years\nago). The Chandra image shows two bright X-ray sources, each produced by hot gas surrounding a black hole. Over the course of\nthe next few hundred million years, the two supermassive black holes, which are about 3000 light-years apart, will drift toward each\nother and merge to form an even larger black hole. This detection of a binary black hole supports the idea that black holes can grow\nto enormous masses in the centers of galaxies by merging with nearby galaxies.

Gerssen)\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatchtwo galaxies collide(https://openstax.org/l/30galcolsuperma)to form a supermassive black hole. 920 27 \u2022 Active Galaxies, Quasars, and Supermassive Black Holes\nHow Does the Black Hole Influence the Formation of Stars in the Galaxy?\nWe have seen that the material in galaxies can influence the growth of theblack hole. The black hole in turn\ncan also influence the galaxy in which it resides. It can do so in three ways: through its jets, through winds of\nparticles that manage to stream away from the accretion disk, and through radiation from the accretion disk.\nAs they stream away from the black hole, all three can either promote star formation by compressing the\nsurrounding gas and dust\u2014or instead suppress star formation by heating the surrounding gas and shredding\nmolecular clouds, thereby inhibiting or preventing star formation. The outflowing energy can even be enough\nto halt the accretion of new material and starve the black hole of fuel. Astronomers are still trying to evaluate\nthe relative importance of these effects in determining the overall evolution of galactic bulges and the rates of\nstar formation.\nIn summary, we have seen how galaxies and supermassive black holes can each influence the evolution of the\nother: the galaxy supplies fuel to the black hole, and the quasar can either support or suppress star formation.\nThe balance of these processes probably helps account for the correlation between black hole and bulge\nmasses, but there are as yet no theories that explain quantitatively and in detail why the correlation between\nblack hole and bulge masses is as tight as it is or why the black hole mass is always about 1/200 times the\nmass of the bulge.\nThe Birth of Black Holes and Galaxies\nWhile the connection between quasars and galaxies is increasingly clear, the biggest puzzle of all\u2014namely,\nhow thesupermassive black holes in galaxies got started\u2014remains unsolved. Observations show that they\nexisted when the universe was very young. One dramatic example is the discovery of a quasar that was\nalready shining when the universe was only 700 million years old. What does it take to create a large black hole\nso quickly? A related problem is that in order to eventually build black holes containing more than 2 billion\nsolar masses, it is necessary to have giant \u201cseed\u201d black holes with masses at least 2000 times the mass of the\nSun\u2014and they must somehow have been created shortly after the expansion of the universe began.\nAstronomers are now working actively to develop models for how these seed black holes might have formed.\nTheories suggest that galaxies formed from collapsing clouds of dark matter and gas. Some of the gas formed\nstars, but perhaps some of the gas settled to the center where it became so concentrated that it formed a\nblack hole. If this happened, the black hole could form right away\u2014although this requires that the gas should\nnot be rotating very much initially.\nA more likely scenario is that the gas will have some angular momentum (rotation) that will prevent direct\ncollapse to a black hole. In that case, the very first generation of stars will form, and some of them, according\nto calculations, will have masses hundreds of times that of the Sun. When these stars finish burning hydrogen,\njust a few million years later, the supernovae they end with will create black holes a hundred or so times the\nmass of the Sun. These can then merge with others or accrete the rich gas supply available at these early\ntimes.\nThe challenge is growing these smaller black holes quickly enough to make the much larger black holes we\nsee a few hundred million years later. It turns out to be difficult because there are limits on how fast they can\naccrete matter. These should make sense to you from what we discussed earlier in the chapter. If the rate of\naccretion becomes too high, then the energy streaming outward from the black hole\u2019s accretion disk will\nbecome so strong as to blow away the infalling matter.\nWhat if, instead, a collapsing gas cloud doesn\u2019t form a black hole directly or break up and form a group of\nregular stars, but stays together and makes one fairly massive star embedded within a dense cluster of\nthousands of lower mass stars and large quantities of dense gas? The massive star will have a short lifetime\nand will soon collapse to become a black hole. It can then begin to attract the dense gas surrounding it. But\ncalculations show that the gravitational attraction of the many nearby stars will cause the black hole to zigzag\nrandomly within the cluster and will prevent the formation of an accretion disk. If there is no accretion disk,\nAccess for free at openstax.org 27.3 \u2022 Quasars as Probes of Evolution in the Universe 921\nthen matter can fall freely into the black hole from all directions. Calculations suggest that under these\nconditions, a black hole even as small as 10 times the mass of the Sun could grow to more than 10 billion times\nthe mass of the Sun by the time the universe is a billion years old.\nScientists are exploring other ideas for how to form the seeds ofsupermassive black holes, and this remains a\nvery active field of research. Whatever mechanism caused the rapid formation of these supermassive black\nholes, they do give us a way to observe the youthful universe when it was only about five percent as old as it is\nnow.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTake a look at somenew results(https://openstax.org/l/30chanxrayobser)from the Chandra X-ray\nObservatory about the formation of supermassive black holes in the early universe. 922 27 \u2022 Key Terms\nKey Terms\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) galaxies that are almost as luminous as quasars and share many of their\nproperties, although to a less spectacular degree; abnormal amounts of energy are produced in their\ncenters\nactive galaxies galaxies that house active galactic nuclei\nquasar an object of very high redshift that looks like a star but is extragalactic and highly luminous; also\ncalled a quasi-stellar object, or QSO\nSummary\n27.1Quasars\nThe first quasars discovered looked like stars but had strong radio emission. Their visible-light spectra at first\nseemed confusing, but then astronomers realized that they had much larger redshifts than stars. The quasar\nspectra obtained so far show redshifts ranging from 15% to more than 96% the speed of light. Observations\nwith the Hubble Space Telescope show that quasars lie at the centers of galaxies and that both spirals and\nellipticals can harbor quasars. The redshifts of the underlying galaxies match the redshifts of the quasars\nembedded in their centers, thereby proving that quasars obey the Hubble law and are at the great distances\nimplied by their redshifts. To be noticeable at such great distances, quasars must have 10 to 100 times the\nluminosity of the brighter normal galaxies. Their variations show that this tremendous energy output is\ngenerated in a small volume\u2014in some cases, in a region not much larger than our own solar system. A\nnumber of galaxies closer to us also show strong activity at their centers\u2014activity now known to be caused by\nthe same mechanism as the quasars.\n27.2Supermassive Black Holes: What Quasars Really Are\nBoth active galactic nuclei and quasars derive their energy from material falling toward, and forming a hot\naccretion disk around, a massive black hole. This model can account for the large amount of energy emitted\nand for the fact that the energy is produced in a relatively small volume of space. It can also explain why jets\ncoming from these objects are seen in two directions: those directions are perpendicular to the accretion disk.\n27.3Quasars as Probes of Evolution in the Universe\nQuasars and galaxies affect each other: the galaxy supplies fuel to the black hole, and the quasar heats and\ndisrupts the gas clouds in the galaxy. The balance between these two processes probably helps explain why\nthe black hole seems always to be about 1/200 the mass of the spherical bulge of stars that surrounds the\nblack hole.\nQuasars were much more common billions of years ago than they are now, and astronomers speculate that\nthey mark an early stage in the formation of galaxies. Quasars were more likely to be active when the universe\nwas young and fuel for their accretion disk was more available.\nQuasar activity can be re-triggered by a collision between two galaxies, which provides a new source of fuel to\nfeed the black hole.\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nBartusiak, M. \u201cA Beast in the Core.\u201dAstronomy(July 1998): 42.

When quasars were first discovered and the source of their great energy was unknown, some\nastronomers searched for evidence that quasars are much nearer to us than their redshifts imply. (That\nway, they would not have to produce so much energy to look as bright as they do.) One way was to find a\n\u201cmismatched pair\u201d\u2014a quasar and a galaxy with different redshifts that lie in very nearly the same\ndirection in the sky. Suppose you do find one and only one galaxy with a quasar very close by, and the\nredshift of the quasar is six times larger than that of the galaxy. Have your group discuss whether you\ncould then conclude that the two objects are at the same distance and that redshift isnota reliable\nindicator of distance. Why? Suppose you found three such pairs, each with different mismatched\nredshifts? Supposeeverygalaxy has a nearby quasar with a different redshift. How would your answer\nchange and why?\nB. Large ground-based telescopes typically can grant time to only one out of every four astronomers who\napply for observing time. One prominent astronomer tried for several years to establish that the redshifts\nof quasars do not indicate their distances. At first, he was given time on the world\u2019s largest telescope, but\neventually it became clearer that quasars were just the centers of active galaxies and that their redshifts\nreally did indicate distance. At that point, he was denied observing time by the committee of astronomers\nwho reviewed such proposals. Suppose your group had been the committee. What decision would you\nhave made? Why? (In general, what criteria should astronomers have for allowing astronomers whose\nviews completely disagree with the prevailing opinion to be able to pursue their research?)\nC. Based on the information in this chapter and inBlack Holes and Curved Spacetime, have your group\ndiscuss what it would be like near the event horizon of a supermassive black hole in a quasar or active\ngalaxy. Make a list of all the reasons a trip to that region would not be good for your health. Be specific.\nD. Before we understood that the energy of quasars comes from supermassive black holes, astronomers\nwere baffled by how such small regions could give off so much energy. A variety of models were\nsuggested, some involving new physics or pretty \u201cfar out\u201d ideas from current physics. Can your group\ncome up with some areas of astronomy that you have studied in this course where we don\u2019t yet have an\nexplanation for something happening in the cosmos?\nAccess for free at openstax.org 27 \u2022 Exercises 925\nExercises\nReview Questions\n1. Describe some differences between quasars and normal galaxies.\n2. Describe the arguments supporting the idea that quasars are at the distances indicated by their redshifts.\n3. In what ways are active galaxies like quasars but different from normal galaxies?\n4. Why could the concentration of matter at the center of an active galaxy like M87 not be made of stars?\n5. Describe the process by which the action of a black hole can explain the energy radiated by quasars.\n6. Describe the observations that convinced astronomers that M87 is an active galaxy.\n7. Why do astronomers believe that quasars represent an early stage in the evolution of galaxies?\n8. Why were quasars and active galaxies not initially recognized as being \u201cspecial\u201d in some way?\n9. What do we now understand to be the primary difference between normal galaxies and active galaxies?\n10. What is the typical structure we observe in a quasar at radio frequencies?\n11. What evidence do we have that the luminous central region of a quasar is small and compact?\nThought Questions\n12. Suppose you observe a star-like object in the sky. How can you determine whether it is actually a star or a\nquasar?\n13. Why don\u2019t any of the methods for establishing distances to galaxies, described inGalaxies(other than\nHubble\u2019s law itself), work for quasars?\n14. One of the early hypotheses to explain the high redshifts of quasars was that these objects had been\nejected at very high speeds from other galaxies. This idea was rejected, because no quasars with large\nblueshifts have been found. Explain why we would expect to see quasars with both blueshifted and\nredshifted lines if they were ejected from nearby galaxies.\n15. A friend of yours who has watched manyStarTrekepisodes and movies says, \u201cI thought that black holes\npulled everything into them. Why then do astronomers think that black holes can explain the great\noutpouringof energy from quasars?\u201d How would you respond?\n16. Could the Milky Way ever become an active galaxy? Is it likely to ever be as luminous as a quasar?\n17. Why are quasars generally so much more luminous (why do they put out so much more energy) than\nactive galaxies?\n18. Suppose we detect a powerful radio source with a radio telescope. How could we determine whether or\nnot this was a newly discovered quasar and not some nearby radio transmission?\n19. A friend tries to convince you that she can easily see a quasar in her backyard telescope. Would you\nbelieve her claim?\nFiguring for Yourself\n20. Show that no matter how big a redshift (z) we measure,v/cwill never be greater than 1. (In other words,\nno galaxy we observe can be moving away faster than the speed of light.)\n21. If a quasar has a redshift of 3.3, at what fraction of the speed of light is it moving away from us?\n22. If a quasar is moving away from us atv/c= 0.8, what is the measured redshift? 926 27 \u2022 Exercises\n23. In the chapter, we discussed that the largest redshifts found so far are greater than 6. Suppose we find a\nquasar with a redshift of 6.1. With what fraction of the speed of light is it moving away from us?\n24. Rapid variability in quasars indicates that the region in which the energy is generated must be small. You\ncan show why this is true. Suppose, for example, that the region in which the energy is generated is a\ntransparent sphere 1 light-year in diameter. Suppose that in 1 s this region brightens by a factor of 10 and\nremains bright for two years, after which it returns to its original luminosity. Draw its light curve (a graph\nof its brightness over time) as viewed from Earth.\n25. Large redshifts move the positions of spectral lines to longer wavelengths and change what can be\nobserved from the ground. For example, suppose a quasar has a redshift of At what\nwavelength would you make observations in order to detect its Lyman line of hydrogen, which has a\nlaboratory or rest wavelength of 121.6 nm? Would this line be observable with a ground-based telescope\nin a quasar with zero redshift? Would it be observable from the ground in a quasar with a redshift of\n26. Once again in this chapter, we see the use of Kepler\u2019s third law to estimate the mass of supermassive\nblack holes. In the case of NGC 4261, this chapter supplied the result of the calculation of the mass of the\nblack hole in NGC 4261. In order to get this answer, astronomers had to measure the velocity of particles\nin the ring of dust and gas that surrounds the black hole. How high were these velocities? Turn Kepler\u2019s\nthird law around and use the information given in this chapter about the galaxy NGC 4261\u2014the mass of\nthe black hole at its center and the diameter of the surrounding ring of dust and gas\u2014to calculate how\nlong it would take a dust particle in the ring to complete a single orbit around the black hole. Assume that\nthe only force acting on the dust particle is the gravitational force exerted by the black hole. Calculate the\nvelocity of the dust particle in km/s.\n27. In the Check Your Learning section ofExample 27.1, you were told that several lines of hydrogen\nabsorption in the visible spectrum have rest wavelengths of 410 nm, 434 nm, 486 nm, and 656 nm. In a\nspectrum of a distant galaxy, these same lines are observed to have wavelengths of 492 nm, 521 nm, 583\nnm, and 787 nm, respectively. The example demonstrated thatz= 0.20 for the 410 nm line. Show that you\nwill obtain the same redshift regardless of which absorption line you measure.\n28. In the Check Your Learning section ofExample 27.1, the author commented that even atz= 0.2, there is\nalready an 11% deviation between the relativistic and the classical solution. What is the percentage\ndifference between the classical and relativistic results atz= 0.1? What is it forz= 0.5? What is it forz= 1?\n29. The quasar that appears the brightest in our sky, 3C 273, is located at a distance of 2.4 billion light-years.\nThe Sun would have to be viewed from a distance of 1300 light-years to have the same apparent\nmagnitude as 3C 273. Using the inverse square law for light, estimate the luminosity of 3C 273 in solar\nunits.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28 \u2022 Thinking Ahead 927\n28\nThe Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies\nFigure28.1Colliding Galaxies.Collisions and mergers of galaxies strongly influence their evolution.

Which formed first: stars or galaxies? Can we see direct\nevidence of the changes galaxies undergo over their lifetimes? If so, what determines whether a galaxy will\n\u201cgrow up\u201d to be spiral or elliptical? And what is the role of \u201cnature versus nurture\u201d? That is to say, how much\nof a galaxy\u2019s development is determined by what it looks like when it is born and how much is influenced by its\nenvironment?\nAstronomers today have the tools needed to explore the universe almost back to the time it began. The huge\nnew telescopes and sensitive detectors built in the last decades make it possible to obtain both images and\nspectra of galaxies so distant that their light has traveled to reach us for more than 13 billion years\u2014more\nthan 90% of the way back to the Big Bang: we can use the finite speed of light and the vast size of the universe\nas a cosmic time machine to peer back and observe how galaxies formed and evolved over time. Studying\ngalaxies so far away in any detail is always a major challenge, largely because their distance makes them\nappear very faint. However, today\u2019s large telescopes on the ground and in space are finally making such a task\npossible. 928 28 \u2022 The Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies\n28.1 Observations of Distant Galaxies\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain how astronomers use light to learn about distant galaxies long ago\nDiscuss the evidence showing that the first stars formed when the universe was less than 10% of its\ncurrent age\nDescribe the major differences observed between galaxies seen in the distant, early universe and galaxies\nseen in the nearby universe today\nLet\u2019s begin by exploring some techniques astronomers use to study howgalaxiesare born and change over\ncosmic time. Suppose you wanted to understand how adult humans got to be the way they are. If you were\nvery dedicated and patient, you could actually observe a sample of babies from birth, following them through\nchildhood, adolescence, and into adulthood, and making basic measurements such as their heights, weights,\nand the proportional sizes of different parts of their bodies to understand how they change over time.\nUnfortunately, we have no such possibility for understanding how galaxies grow and change over time: in a\nhuman lifetime\u2014or even over the entire history of human civilization\u2014individual galaxies change hardly at all.\nWe need other tools than just patiently observing single galaxies in order to study and understand those long,\nslow changes.\nWe do, however, have one remarkable asset in studying galactic evolution. As we have seen, the universe itself\nis a kind of time machine that permits us to observe remote galaxies as they were long ago. For the closest\ngalaxies, like theAndromeda galaxy, the time the light takes to reach us is on the order of a few hundred\nthousand to a few million years. Typically not much changes over times that short\u2014individual stars in the\ngalaxy may be born or die, but the overall structure and appearance of the galaxy will remain the same. But\nwe have observed galaxies so far away that we are seeing them as they were when the light left them more\nthan 10 billion years ago.\nBy observing more distant objects, we look further back toward a time when both galaxies and the universe\nwere young (Figure 28.2). For something similar on Earth, imagine your college doing a project where families\nof international students around the world are asked to send a daily newspaper from their hometown.\nBecause there is a limited budget, the papers are sent via ordinary mail. The farther a town is from the United\nStates, the longer it takes for the papers to get to the college, and the older the news is by the time it arrives.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.1 \u2022 Observations of Distant Galaxies 929\nFigure28.2Astronomical Time Travel.This true-color, long-exposure image, made during 70 orbits of Earth with the Hubble Space\nTelescope, shows a small area in the direction of the constellation Sculptor. The massive cluster of galaxies named Abell 2744\nappears in the foreground of this image. It contains several hundred galaxies, and we are seeing them as they looked 3.5 billion\nyears ago. The immense gravity in Abell 2744 acts as a gravitational lens (see the Astronomy Basics feature box onGravitational\nLensinglater in this chapter) to warp space and brighten and magnify images of nearly 3000 distant background galaxies. The more\ndistant galaxies (many of them quite blue) appear as they did more than 12 billion years ago, not long after the Big Bang. Blue\ngalaxies were much more common in that earlier time than they are today. These galaxies appear blue because they are undergoing\nactive star formation and making hot, bright blue stars. (credit: NASA, ESA, STScI)\nIf we can\u2019t directly detect the changes over time in individual galaxies because they happen too slowly, how\nthen can we ever understand those changes and the origins of galaxies? The solution is to observe many\ngalaxies at many different cosmic distances and, therefore, look-back times (how far back in time we are\nseeing the galaxy). If we can study a thousand very distant \u201cbaby\u201d galaxies when the universe was 1 billion\nyears old, and another thousand slightly closer \u201ctoddler\u201d galaxies when it was 2 billion years old, and so on\nuntil the present 13.8-billion-year-old universe of mature \u201cadult\u201d galaxies near us today, then maybe we can\npiece together a coherent picture of how the whole ensemble of galaxies evolves over time. This allows us to\nreconstruct the \u201clife story\u201d of galaxies since the universe began, even though we can\u2019t follow a single galaxy\nfrom infancy to old age.\nFortunately, there is no shortage of galaxies to study. Hold up your pinky at arm\u2019s length: the part of the sky\nblocked by your fingernail contains about one million galaxies, layered farther and farther back in space and\ntime. In fact, the sky is filled with galaxies, all of them, except for Andromeda and the Magellanic Clouds, too\nfaint to see with the naked eye\u2014more than 2 trillion (2000 billion) galaxies in the observable universe, each\none with about 100 billion stars.\nThis cosmic time machine, then, lets us peer into the past to answer fundamental questions about where\ngalaxies come from and how they got to be the way they are today. Astronomers call those galactic changes\nover cosmic timeevolution, a word that recalls the work of Darwin and others on the development of life on\nEarth. But note that galaxy evolution refers to the changes inindividualgalaxies over time, while the kind of\nevolution biologists study is changes insuccessive generationsof living organisms over time.\nSpectra, Colors, and Shapes\nAstronomy is one of the few sciences in which all measurements must be made at a distance. Geologists can\ntake samples of the objects they are studying; chemists can conduct experiments in their laboratories to 930 28 \u2022 The Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies\ndetermine what a substance is made of; archeologists can use carbon dating to determine how old something\nis. But astronomers can\u2019t pick up and play with a star or galaxy. As we have seen throughout this book, if they\nwant to know what galaxies are made of and how they have changed over the lifetime of the universe, they\nmust decode the messages carried by the small number of photons that reach Earth.\nFortunately (as you have learned) electromagnetic radiation is a rich source of information. The distance to a\ngalaxy is derived from itsredshift(how much the lines in its spectrum are shifted to the red because of the\nexpansion of the universe). The conversion of redshift to a distance depends on certain properties of the\nuniverse, including the value of the Hubble constant and how much mass it contains. We will describe the\ncurrently accepted model of the universe inThe Big Bang. For the purposes of this chapter, it is enough to\nknow that the current best estimate for the age of the universe is 13.8 billion years. In that case, if we see an\nobject that emitted its light 6 billion light-years ago, we are seeing it as it was when the universe was almost 8\nbillion years old. If we see something that emitted its light 13 billion years ago, we are seeing it as it was when\nthe universe was less than a billion years old. So astronomers measure a galaxy\u2019s redshift from its spectrum,\nuse the Hubble constant plus a model of the universe to turn the redshift into a distance, and use the distance\nand the constant speed of light to infer how far back in time they are seeing the galaxy\u2014the look-back time.\nIn addition to distance and look-back time, studies of the Doppler shifts of a galaxy\u2019s spectral lines can tell us\nhow fast the galaxy is rotating and hence how massive it is (as explained inGalaxies). Detailed analysis of such\nlines can also indicate the types of stars that inhabit a galaxy and whether it contains large amounts of\ninterstellar matter.\nUnfortunately, many galaxies are so faint that collecting enough light to produce a detailed spectrum is\ncurrently impossible. Astronomers thus have to use a much rougher guide to estimate what kinds of stars\ninhabit the faintest galaxies\u2014their overall colors. Look again atFigure 28.2and notice that some of the\ngalaxies are very blue and others are reddish-orange. Now remember that hot, luminous blue stars are very\nmassive and have lifetimes of only a few million years. If we see a galaxy where blue colors dominate, we know\nthat it must have many hot, luminous blue stars, and that star formation must have taken place in the few\nmillion years before the light left the galaxy. In a yellow or red galaxy, on the other hand, the young, luminous\nblue stars that surely were made in the galaxy\u2019s early bursts of star formation must have died already; it must\ncontain mostly old yellow and red stars that last a long time in their main-sequence stages and thus typically\nformed billions of years before the light that we now see was emitted.\nAnother important clue to the nature of a galaxy is its shape. Spiral galaxies can be distinguished from\nelliptical galaxies by shape. Observations show that spiral galaxies contain young stars and large amounts of\ninterstellar matter, while elliptical galaxies have mostly old stars and very little or no star formation. Elliptical\ngalaxies turned most of their interstellar matter into stars many billions of years ago, while star formation has\ncontinued until the present day in spiral galaxies.\nIf we can count the number of galaxies of each type during each epoch of the universe, it will help us\nunderstand how the pace of star formation changes with time. As we will see later in this chapter, galaxies in\nthe distant universe\u2014that is, young galaxies\u2014look very different from the older galaxies that we see nearby in\nthe present-day universe.\nThe First Generation of Stars\nIn addition to looking at the most distant galaxies we can find, astronomers look at the oldest stars (what we\nmight call the fossil record) of our own Galaxy to probe what happened in the early universe. Since stars are\nthe source of nearly all the light emitted by galaxies, we can learn a lot about the evolution of galaxies by\nstudying the stars within them. What we find is that nearly all galaxies contain at least some very old stars. For\nexample, our own Galaxy contains globular clusters with stars that are at least 13 billion years old, and some\nmay be even older than that. Therefore, if we count the age of the Milky Way as the age of its oldest\nconstituents, the Milky Way must have been born at least 13 billion years ago.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.1 \u2022 Observations of Distant Galaxies 931\nAs we will discuss inThe Big Bang, astronomers have discovered that the universe is expanding, and have\ntraced the expansion backward in time. In this way, they have discovered that the universe itself is only about\n13.8 billion years old. Thus, it appears that at least some of the globular-cluster stars in the Milky Way must\nhave formed less than a billion years after the expansion began.\nSeveral other observations also establish that star formation in the cosmos began very early. Astronomers\nhave used spectra to determine the composition of some elliptical galaxies that are so far away that the light\nwe see left them when the universe was only half as old as it is now. Yet these ellipticals contain old red stars,\nwhich must have formed billions of years earlier still.\nWhen we make computer models of how such galaxies evolve with time, they tell us that star formation in\nelliptical galaxies began less than a billion years or so after the universe started its expansion, and new stars\ncontinued to form for a few billion years. But then star formation apparently stopped. When we compare\ndistant elliptical galaxies with ones nearby, we find that ellipticals have not changed very much since the\nuniverse reached about half its current age. We\u2019ll return to this idea later in the chapter.\nObservations of the most luminous galaxies take us even further back in time. Recently, as we have already\nnoted, astronomers have discovered a few galaxies that are so far away that the light we see now left them\nless than a billion years or so after the beginning (Figure 28.3). Yet the spectra of some of these galaxies\nalready contain lines of heavy elements, including carbon, silicon, aluminum, and sulfur. These elements were\nnot present when the universe began but had to be manufactured in the interiors of stars. This means that\nwhen the light from these galaxies was emitted, an entire generation of stars had already been born, lived out\ntheir lives, and died\u2014spewing out the new elements made in their interiors through supernova\nexplosions\u2014even before the universe was a billion years old. And it wasn\u2019t just a few stars in each galaxy that\ngot started this way. Enough had to live and die to affect the overall composition of the galaxy, in a way that\nwe can still measure in the spectrum from far away.\nFigure28.3Very Distant Galaxy.This image was made with the Hubble Space Telescope and shows the field around a luminous\ngalaxy at a redshiftz= 8.68, which corresponds to 13.2 billion light years. This means that we are seeing this galaxy as it appeared\nabout 13.2 billion years ago. The galaxy itself is indicated by the arrow. Long exposures in the far-red and infrared wavelengths were\ncombined to make the image, and additional infrared exposures with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which has lower spatial resolution\nthan the Hubble (lower inset), show the redshifted light of normal stars. The very distant galaxy was detected because it has a strong\nemission line of hydrogen. This line is produced in regions where the formation of hot, young stars is taking place. (credit:\nmodification of work by I. Labb\u00e9 (Leiden University), NASA/ESA/JPL-Caltech)\nObservations ofquasars(galaxies whose centers contain a supermassive black hole) support this conclusion. 932 28 \u2022 The Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies\nWe can measure the abundances of heavy elements in the gas nearquasarblack holes (explained inActive\nGalaxies, Quasars, and Supermassive Black Holes). The composition of this gas in quasars that emitted their\nlight 12.5 billion light-years ago is very similar to that of the Sun. This means that a large portion of the gas\nsurrounding the black holes must have already been cycled through stars during the first 1.3 billion years after\nthe expansion of the universe began. If we allow time for this cycling, then their first stars must have formed\nwhen the universe was only a few hundred million years old.\nA Changing Universe of Galaxies\nBack in the middle decades of the twentieth century, the observation that all galaxies contain some old stars\nled astronomers to the hypothesis that galaxies were born fully formed near the time when the universe\nbegan its expansion. This hypothesis was similar to suggesting that human beings were born as adults and did\nnot have to pass through the various stages of development from infancy through the teens. If this hypothesis\nwere correct, the most distant galaxies should have shapes and sizes very much like the galaxies we see\nnearby. According to this old view, galaxies, after they formed, should then change only slowly, as successive\ngenerations of stars within them formed, evolved, and died. As the interstellar matter was slowly used up and\nfewer new stars formed, the galaxies would gradually become dominated by fainter, older stars and look\ndimmer and dimmer.\nThanks to the new generation of large ground- and space-based telescopes, we now know that this picture of\ngalaxies evolving peacefully and in isolation from one another is completely wrong. As we will see later in this\nchapter, galaxies in the distant universe do not look like the Milky Way and nearby galaxies such as\nAndromeda, and the story of their development is more complex and involves far more interaction with their\nneighbors.\nWhy were astronomers so wrong? Up until the early 1990s, the most distant normal galaxy that had been\nobserved emitted its light 8 billion years ago. Since that time, many galaxies\u2014and particularly the giant\nellipticals, which are the most luminous and therefore the easiest to see at large distances\u2014did evolve\npeacefully and slowly. But the Hubble, Spitzer, Herschel, Keck, and other powerful new telescopes that have\ncome on line since the 1990s make it possible to pierce the 8-billion-light-year barrier. We now have detailed\nviews of many thousands of galaxies that emitted their light much earlier (some more than 13 billion years\nago\u2014seeFigure 28.3).\nMuch of the recent work on the evolution of galaxies has progressed by studying a few specific small regions\nof the sky where the Hubble, Spitzer, and ground-based telescopes have taken extremely long exposure\nimages. This allowed astronomers to detect very faint, very distant, and therefore veryyounggalaxies (Figure\n28.4). Our deep space telescope images show some galaxies that are 100 times fainter than the faintest\nobjects that can be observed spectroscopically with today\u2019s giant ground-based telescopes. This turns out to\nmean that we can obtain the spectra needed to determine redshifts for only the very brightest five percent of\nthe galaxies in these images.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.1 \u2022 Observations of Distant Galaxies 933\nFigure28.4Hubble Ultra-Deep Field.This image is the result of an 11-day-long observation with the Hubble Space Telescope of a\ntiny region of sky, located toward the constellation Fornax near the south celestial pole. This is an area that has only a handful of\nMilky Way stars. (Since the Hubble orbits Earth every 96 minutes, the telescope returned to view the same tiny piece of sky over and\nover again until enough light was collected and added together to make this very long exposure.) There are about 10,000 objects in\nthis single image, nearly all of them galaxies, each with tens or hundreds of billions of stars. We can see some pinwheel-shaped\nspiral galaxies, which are like the Milky Way. But we also find a large variety of peculiar-shaped galaxies that are in collision with\ncompanion galaxies. Elliptical galaxies, which contain mostly old stars, appear as reddish blobs. (credit: modification of work by\nNASA, ESA, H. Teplitz and M. Rafelski (IPAC/Caltech), A. Koekemoer (STScI), R. Windhorst (Arizona State University), and Z. Levay\n(STScI))\nAlthough we do not have spectra for most of the faint galaxies, the Hubble Space Telescope is especially well\nsuited to studying theirshapesbecause the images taken in space are not blurred by Earth\u2019s atmosphere. To\nthe surprise of astronomers, the distant galaxies did not fit Hubble\u2019s classification scheme at all. Remember\nthat Hubble found that nearly all nearby galaxies could be classified into a few categories, depending on\nwhether they were ellipticals or spirals. The distant galaxies observed by the Hubble Space Telescope look very\ndifferent from present-day galaxies, without identifiable spiral arms, disks, and bulges (Figure 28.5). They also\ntend to be much clumpier than most galaxies today. In other words, it\u2019s becoming clear that the shapes of\ngalaxies have changed significantly over time. In fact, we now know that the Hubble scheme works well for\nonly the last half of the age of the universe. Before then, galaxies were much more chaotic. 934 28 \u2022 The Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies\nFigure28.5Early Galaxies.This Hubble Space Telescope image shows what are probably \u201cgalaxies under construction\u201d in the early\nuniverse. The boxes in this color image show enlargements of 18 groups of stars smaller than galaxies as we know them. All these\nobjects emitted their light about 11 billion years ago. They are typically only about 2,000 light-years across, which is much smaller\nthan the Milky Way, with its diameter of 100,000 light-years. These 18 objects are found in a region only 2 million light-years across\nand are close enough together that they will probably collide and merge to build one or more normal galaxies. (credit: modification\nof work by Rogier Windhorst (Arizona State University) and NASA)\nIt\u2019s not just the shapes that are different. Nearly all the galaxies with red-shifts that correspond to 11 billion\nlight-years or more\u2014that is, galaxies that we are seeing when they were less than 3 billion years old\u2014are\nextremely blue, indicating that they contain a lot of young stars and that star formation in them is occurring at\na higher rate than in nearby galaxies. Observations also show that very distant galaxies are systematically\nsmaller on average than nearby galaxies. Relatively few galaxies present before the universe was about 8\nbillion years old have masses greater than 1011M . That\u2019s 1/20 the mass of the Milky Way if we include its\nSun\ndark matter halo. Eleven billion years ago, there were only a few galaxies with masses greater than 1010M .\nSun\nWhat we see instead seem to be small pieces or fragments of galactic material (Figure 28.6). When we look at\ngalaxies that emitted their light 11 to 12 billion years ago, we now believe we are seeing theseedsof elliptical\ngalaxies and of the central bulges of spirals. Over time, these smaller galaxies collided and merged to build up\ntoday\u2019s large galaxies.\nBear in mind that stars that formed more than 11 billion years ago will be very old stars today. Indeed when\nwe look nearby (at galaxies we see closer to our time), we find mostly old stars in the nuclear bulges of nearby\nspirals and in elliptical galaxies.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.2 \u2022 Galaxy Mergers and Active Galactic Nuclei 935\nFigure28.6One of the Farthest, Faintest, and Smallest Galaxies Ever Seen.The small white boxes, labeleda, b,andc,mark the\npositions of three images of the same galaxy. These multiple images were produced by the massive cluster of galaxies known as\nAbell 2744, which is located between us and the galaxy and acts as a gravitational lens. The arrows in the enlarged insets at right\npoint to the galaxy. Each magnified image makes the galaxy appear as much as 10 times larger and brighter than it would look\nwithout the intervening lens. This galaxy emitted the light we observe today when the universe was only about 500 million years old.\nWhen the light was emitted the galaxy was tiny\u2014only 850 light-years across, or 500 times smaller than the Milky, and its mass was\nonly 40 million times the mass of the Sun. Star formation is going on in this galaxy, but it appears red in the image because of its\nlarge redshift. (credit: modification of work by NASA, ESA, A. Zitrin (California Institute of Technology), and J. Lotz, M. Mountain, A.\nKoekemoer, and the HFF Team (STScI))\nWhat such observations are showing us is that galaxies have grown in size as the universe has aged. Not only\nwere galaxies smaller several billion years ago, but there were more of them; gas-rich galaxies, particularly the\nless luminous ones, were much more numerous then than they are today.\nThose are some of the basic observations we can make of individual galaxies (and their evolution) looking\nback in cosmic time. Now we want to turn to the larger context. If stars are grouped into galaxies, are the\ngalaxies also grouped in some way? In the third section of this chapter, we\u2019ll explore the largest structures\nknown in the universe.\n28.2 Galaxy Mergers and Active Galactic Nuclei\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain how galaxies grow by merging with other galaxies and by consuming smaller galaxies (for lunch)\nDescribe the effects that supermassive black holes in the centers of most galaxies have on the fate of their\nhost galaxies\nOne of the conclusions astronomers have reached from studying distant galaxies is that collisions and\nmergers of whole galaxies play a crucial role in determining how galaxies acquired the shapes and sizes we 936 28 \u2022 The Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies\nsee today. Only a few of the nearby galaxies are currently involved in collisions, but detailed studies of those\ntell us what to look for when we seek evidence of mergers in very distant and very faint galaxies. These in turn\ngive us important clues about the different evolutionary paths galaxies have taken over cosmic time. Let\u2019s\nexamine in more detail what happens when two galaxies collide.\nMergers and Cannibalism\nFigure 28.1shows a dynamic view of two galaxies that are colliding. The stars themselves in this pair of\ngalaxies will not be affected much by this cataclysmic event. (See the Astronomy Basics feature boxWhy\nGalaxies Collide but Stars Rarely Do.) Since there is a lot of space between the stars, a direct collision between\ntwo stars is very unlikely. However, theorbitsof many of the stars will be changed as the two galaxies move\nthrough each other, and the change in orbits can totally alter the appearance of the interacting galaxies. A\ngallery of interesting colliding galaxies is shown inFigure 28.7. Great rings, huge tendrils of stars and gas, and\nother complex structures can form in such cosmic collisions. Indeed, these strange shapes are the signposts\nthat astronomers use to identify colliding galaxies.\nFigure28.7Gallery of Interacting Galaxies.(a and b) M82 (smaller galaxy at top) and M83 (spiral) are seen (a) in a black-and-white\nvisible light image and (b) in radio waves given off by cold hydrogen gas. The hydrogen image shows that the two galaxies are\nwrapped in a common shroud of gas that is being tugged and stretched by the gravity of the two galaxies. (c) This close-up view by\nthe Hubble Space Telescope shows some of the effects of this interaction on galaxy M82, including gas streaming outward (red\ntendrils) powered by supernovae explosions of massive stars formed in the burst of star formation that was a result of the collision.\n(d) Galaxy UGC 10214 (\u201cThe Tadpole\u201d) is a barred spiral galaxy 420 million light-years from the Milky Way that has been disrupted by\nthe passage of a smaller galaxy. The interloper\u2019s gravity pulled out the long tidal tail, which is about 280,000 light-years long, and\ntriggered bursts of star formation seen as blue clumps along the tail. (e) Galaxies NGC 4676 A and B are nicknamed \u201cThe Mice.\u201d In\nthis Hubble Space Telescope image, you can see the long, narrow tails of stars pulled away from the galaxies by the interactions of\nthe two spirals. (f) Arp 148 is a pair of galaxies that are caught in the act of merging to become one new galaxy. The two appear to\nhave already passed through each other once, causing a shockwave that reformed one into a bright blue ring of star formation, like\nthe ripples from a stone tossed into a pond.

You might\ntherefore have been surprised to hear about collisions between galaxies. Yet (except at the very cores of\ngalaxies) we have not worried at all about stars inside a galaxy colliding with each other. Let\u2019s see why\nthere is a difference.\nThe reason is that stars are pitifully small compared to the distances between them. Let\u2019s use our Sun as an\nexample. The Sun is about 1.4 million kilometers wide, but is separated from the closest other star by about\n4 light-years, or about 38 trillion kilometers. In other words, the Sun is 27 million of its own diameters from\nits nearest neighbor. If the Sun were a grapefruit in New York City, the nearest star would be another\ngrapefruit in San Francisco. This is typical of stars that are not in the nuclear bulge of a galaxy or inside star\nclusters. Let\u2019s contrast this with the separation of galaxies.\nThe visible disk of the Milky Way is about 100,000 light-years in diameter. We have three satellite galaxies\nthat are just one or two Milky Way diameters away from us (and will probably someday collide with us). The\nclosest major spiral is the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), about 2.4 million light-years away. If the Milky Way\nwere a pancake at one end of a big breakfast table, M31 would be another pancake at the other end of the\nsame table. Our nearest large galaxy neighbor is only 24 of our Galaxy\u2019s diameters from us, and it will begin\nto crash into the Milky Way in about 4.5 billion years.\nGalaxies in rich clusters are even closer together than those in our neighborhood (seeThe Distribution of\nGalaxies in Space). Thus, the chances of galaxies colliding are far greater than the chances of stars in the\ndisk of a galaxy colliding. And we should note that the difference between the separation of galaxies and\nstars also means that when galaxies do collide, their stars almost always pass right by each other like\nsmoke passing through a screen door.\nThe details ofgalaxy collisionsare complex, and the process can take hundreds of millions of years. Thus,\ncollisions are best simulated on a computer (Figure 28.8), where astronomers can calculate the slow\ninteractions of stars, and clouds of gas and dust, via gravity. These calculations show that if the collision is\nslow, the colliding galaxies may coalesce to form a single galaxy. 938 28 \u2022 The Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies\nFigure28.8Computer Simulation of a Galaxy Collision.This computer simulation starts with two spiral galaxies merging and ends\nwith a single elliptical galaxy. The colors show the colors of stars in the system; note the bursts of blue color as copious star\nformation gets triggered by the interaction. The timescale from start to finish in this sequence is about a billion years. (credit:\nmodification of work by P. Jonsson (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics), G. Novak (Princeton University), and T. J. Cox\n(Carnegie Observatories))\nWhen two galaxies of equal size are involved in a collision, we call such an interaction amerger(the term\napplied in the business world to two equal companies that join forces). But small galaxies can also be\nswallowed by larger ones\u2014a process astronomers have called, with some relish,galactic cannibalism(Figure\n28.9).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.2 \u2022 Galaxy Mergers and Active Galactic Nuclei 939\nFigure28.9Galactic Cannibalism.(a) This Hubble image shows the eerie silhouette of dark dust clouds against the glowing nucleus\nof the elliptical galaxy NGC 1316. Elliptical galaxies normally contain very little dust. These clouds are probably the remnant of a small\ncompanion galaxy that was cannibalized (eaten) by NGC 1316 about 100 million years ago. (b) The highly disturbed galaxy NGC 6240,\nimaged by Hubble Space Telescope (background image) and Chandra X-ray Telescope (both insets) is apparently the product of a\nmerger between two gas-rich spiral galaxies. The X-ray images show that there is not one but two nuclei, both glowing brightly in X-\nrays and separated by only 4000 light-years. These are likely the locations of two supermassive black holes that inhabited the cores\nof the two galaxies pre-merger; here they are participating in a kind of \u201cdeath spiral,\u201d in which the two black holes themselves will\nmerge to become one. (credit a: modification of work by NASA, ESA, and The Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA); credit b: X-ray:\nNASA/CXC/MPE/S.Komossa et al.; Optical: NASA/STScI/R.P.van der Marel & J.Gerssen)\nThe very large elliptical galaxies we discussed inGalaxiesprobably form by cannibalizing a variety of smaller\ngalaxies in their clusters. These \u201cmonster\u201d galaxies frequently possess more than one nucleus and have\nprobably acquired their unusually high luminosities by swallowing nearby galaxies. The multiple nuclei are the\nremnants of their victims (Figure 28.9). Many of the large, peculiar galaxies that we observe also owe their\nchaotic shapes to past interactions. Slow collisions and mergers can even transform two or more spiral\ngalaxies into a single elliptical galaxy.\nA change in shape is not all that happens when galaxies collide. If either galaxy contains interstellar matter,\nthe collision can compress the gas and trigger an increase in the rate at which stars are being formed\u2014by as\nmuch as a factor of 100. Astronomers call this abrupt increase in the number of stars being formed a\nstarburst, and the galaxies in which the increase occurs are termed starburst galaxies (Figure 28.10). In some\ninteracting galaxies, star formation is so intense that all the available gas is exhausted in only a few million\nyears; the burst of star formation is clearly only a temporary phenomenon. While a starburst is going on,\nhowever, the galaxy where it is taking place becomes much brighter and much easier to detect at large\ndistances. 940 28 \u2022 The Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies\nFigure28.10Starburst Associated with Colliding Galaxies.(a) Three of the galaxies in the small group known as Stephan\u2019s\nQuintet are interacting gravitationally with each other (the galaxy at upper left is actually much closer than the other three and is not\npart of this interaction), resulting in the distorted shapes seen here. Long strings of young, massive blue stars and hundreds of star\nformation regions glowing in the pink light of excited hydrogen gas are also results of the interaction. The ages of the star clusters\nrange from 2 million to 1 billion years old, suggesting that there have been several different collisions within this group of galaxies,\neach leading to bursts of star formation. The three interacting members of Stephan\u2019s Quintet are located at a distance of 270 million\nlight-years. (b) Most galaxies form new stars at a fairly slow rate, but members of a rare class known as starburst galaxies blaze with\nextremely active star formation. The galaxy II Zw 096 is one such starburst galaxy, and this combined image using both Hubble and\nSpitzer Space Telescope data shows that it is forming bright clusters of new stars at a prodigious rate. The blue colors show the\nmerging galaxies in visible light, while the red colors show infrared radiation from the dusty region where star formation is\nhappening. This galaxy is at a distance of 500 million light-years and has a diameter of about 50,000 light-years, about half the size of\nthe Milky Way.

They also contain lots of blue, young, type O and B stars, as do\nnearby merging galaxies.\nGalaxy mergers in today\u2019s universe are rare. Only about five percent of nearby galaxies are currently involved\nin interactions. Interactions were much more common billions of years ago (Figure 28.11) and helped build up\nthe \u201cmore mature\u201d galaxies we see in our time. Clearly, interactions of galaxies have played a crucial role in\ntheir evolution.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.2 \u2022 Galaxy Mergers and Active Galactic Nuclei 941\nFigure28.11Collisions of Galaxies in a Distant Cluster.The large picture on the left shows the Hubble Space Telescope image of a\ncluster of galaxies at a distance of about 8 billion light-years. Among the 81 galaxies in the cluster that have been examined in some\ndetail, 13 are the result of recent collisions of pairs of galaxies. The eight smaller images on the right are close-ups of some of the\ncolliding galaxies. The merger process typically takes a billion years or so. (credit: modification of work by Pieter van Dokkum, Marijn\nFranx (University of Groningen/Leiden), ESA and NASA)\nActive Galactic Nuclei and Galaxy Evolution\nWhile galaxy mergers are huge, splashy events that completely reshape entire galaxies on scales of hundreds\nof thousands of light-years and can spark massive bursts of star formation, accreting black holes inside\ngalaxies can also disturb and alter the evolution of their host galaxies. You learned inActive Galaxies, Quasars,\nand Supermassive Black Holesabout a family of objects known asactive galactic nuclei(AGN), all of them\npowered by supermassive black holes. If the black hole is surrounded by enough gas, some of the gas can fall\ninto the black hole, getting swept up on the way into an accretion disk, a compact, swirling maelstrom perhaps\nonly 100 AU across (the size of our solar system).\nWithin the disk the gas heats up until it shines brilliantly even in X-rays, often outshining the rest of the host\ngalaxy with its billions of stars. Supermassive black holes and their accretion disks can be violent and powerful\nplaces, with some material getting sucked into the black hole but even more getting shot out along huge jets\nperpendicular to the disk. These powerful jets can extend far outside the starry edge of the galaxy.\nAGN were much more common in the early universe, in part because frequent mergers provided a fresh gas\nsupply for the black hole accretion disks. Examples of AGN in the nearby universe today include the one in\ngalaxyM87(seeFigure 27.7), which sports a jet of material shooting out from its nucleus at speeds close to the\nspeed of light, and the one in the bright galaxy NGC 5128, also known as Centaurus A (seeFigure 28.12). 942 28 \u2022 The Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies\nFigure28.12Composite View of the Galaxy Centaurus A.This artificially colored image was made using data from three different\ntelescopes: submillimeter radiation with a wavelength of 870 microns is shown in orange; X-rays are seen in blue; and visible light\nfrom stars is shown in its natural color. Centaurus A has an active galactic nucleus that is powering two jets, seen in blue and orange,\nreaching in opposite directions far outside the galaxy\u2019s stellar disk, and inflating two huge lobes, or clouds, of hot X-ray-emitting gas.\nCentaurus is at a distance of 13 million light-years, making it one of the closest active galaxies we know. (credit: modification of work\nby ESO/WFI (Optical); MPIfR/ESO/APEX/A. Weiss et al. (Submillimeter); NASA/CXC/CfA/R.Kraft et al. (X-ray))\nMany highly accelerated particles move with the jets in such galaxies. Along the way, the particles in the jets\ncan plow into gas clouds in the interstellar medium, breaking them apart and scattering them. Since denser\nclouds of gas and dust are required for material to clump together to make stars, the disruption of the clouds\ncan halt star formation in the host galaxy or cut it off before it even begins.\nIn this way, quasars and other kinds of AGN can play a crucial role in the evolution of their galaxies. For\nexample, there is growing evidence that the merger of two gas-rich galaxies not only produces a huge burst of\nstar formation, but also triggers AGN activity in the core of the new galaxy. That activity, in turn, could then\nslow down or shut off the burst of star formation\u2014which could have significant implications for the apparent\nshape, brightness, chemical content, and stellar components of the entire galaxy. Astronomers refer to that\nprocess asAGN feedback, and it is apparently an important factor in the evolution of most galaxies.\n28.3 The Distribution of Galaxies in Space\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain the cosmological principle and summarize the evidence that it applies on the largest scales of the\nknown universe\nDescribe the contents of the Local Group of galaxies\nDistinguish among groups, clusters, and superclusters of galaxies\nDescribe the largest structures seen in the universe, including voids\nIn the preceding section, we emphasized the role of mergers in shaping the evolution of galaxies. In order to\ncollide, galaxies must be fairly close together. To estimate how often collisions occur and how they affect\ngalaxy evolution, astronomers need to know how galaxies are distributed in space and over cosmic time. Are\nmost of them isolated from one another or do they congregate in groups? If they congregate, how large are\nthe groups and how and when did they form? And how, in general, are galaxies and their groups arranged in\nthe cosmos? Are there as many in one direction of the sky as in any other, for example? How did galaxies get\nto be arranged the way we find them today?\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.3 \u2022 The Distribution of Galaxies in Space 943\nEdwin Hubble found answers to some of these questions only a few years after he first showed that the spiral\nnebulae were galaxies and not part of our Milky Way. As he examined galaxies all over the sky, Hubble made\ntwo discoveries that turned out to be crucial for studies of the evolution of the universe.\nThe Cosmological Principle\nHubble made his observations with what were then the world\u2019s largest telescopes\u2014the 100-inch and 60-inch\nreflectors on Mount Wilson. These telescopes have small fields of view: they can see only a small part of the\nheavens at a time. To photograph the entire sky with the 100-inch telescope, for example, would have taken\nlonger than a human lifetime. So instead, Hubble sampled the sky in many regions, much as Herschel did with\nhis star gauging (seeThe Architecture of the Galaxy). In the 1930s, Hubble photographed 1283 sample areas,\nand on each print, he carefully counted the numbers of galaxy images (Figure 28.13).\nThe first discovery Hubble made from his survey was that the number of galaxies visible in each area of the sky\nis about the same. (Strictly speaking, this is true only if the light from distant galaxies is not absorbed by dust\nin our own Galaxy, but Hubble made corrections for this absorption.) He also found that the numbers of\ngalaxies increase with faintness, as we would expect if the density of galaxies is about the same at all distances\nfrom us.\nTo understand what we mean, imagine you are taking snapshots in a crowded stadium during a sold-out\nconcert. The people sitting near you look big, so only a few of them will fit into a photo. But if you focus on the\npeople sitting in seats way on the other side of the stadium, they look so small that many more will fit into\nyour picture. If all parts of the stadium have the same seat arrangements, then as you look farther and farther\naway, your photo will get more and more crowded with people. In the same way, as Hubble looked at fainter\nand fainter galaxies, he saw more and more of them.\nFigure28.13Hubble at Work.Edwin Hubble at the 100-inch telescope on Mount Wilson. (credit: NASA)\nHubble\u2019s findings are enormously important, for they indicate that the universe is bothisotropicand\nhomogeneous\u2014it looks the same in all directions, and a large volume of space at any given redshift or\ndistance is much like any other volume at that redshift. If that is so, it does not matter what section of the\nuniverse we observe (as long as it\u2019s a sizable portion): any section will look the same as any other.\nHubble\u2019s results\u2014and many more that have followed in the nearly 100 years since then\u2014imply not only that\nthe universe is about the same everywhere (apart from changes with time) but also that aside from small-scale\nlocal differences, the part we can see around us is representative of the whole. The idea that the universe is\nthe same everywhere is called thecosmological principleand is the starting assumption for nearly all\ntheories that describe the entire universe (seeThe Big Bang).\nWithout the cosmological principle, we could make no progress at all in studying the universe. Suppose our\nown local neighborhood were unusual in some way. Then we could no more understand what the universe is\nlike than if we were marooned on a warm south-sea island without outside communication and were trying to\nunderstand the geography of Earth. From our limited island vantage point, we could not know that some parts\nof the planet are covered with snow and ice, or that large continents exist with a much greater variety of 944 28 \u2022 The Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies\nterrain than that found on our island.\nHubble merely counted the numbers of galaxies in various directions without knowing how far away most of\nthem were. With modern instruments, astronomers have measured the velocities and distances of hundreds\nof thousands of galaxies, and so built up a meaningful picture of the large-scale structure of the universe. In\nthe rest of this section, we describe what we know about the distribution of galaxies, beginning with those that\nare nearby.\nThe Local Group\nThe region of the universe for which we have the most detailed information is, as you would expect, our own\nlocal neighborhood. It turns out that the Milky Way Galaxy is a member of a small group of galaxies called, not\ntoo imaginatively, theLocal Group. It is spread over about 3 million light-years and contains 60 or so\nmembers. There are three large spiral galaxies (our own, the Andromeda galaxy, and M33), two intermediate\nellipticals, and many dwarf ellipticals and irregular galaxies.\nNew members of the Local Group are still being discovered. We mentioned inThe Milky Way Galaxya dwarf\ngalaxy only about 80,000 light-years from Earth and about 50,000 light-years from the center of the galaxy that\nwas discovered in 1994 in the constellation of Sagittarius. (This dwarf is actually venturing too close to the\nmuch larger Milky Way and will eventually be consumed by it.)\nMany of the recent discoveries have been made possible by the new generation of automated, sensitive, wide-\nfield surveys, such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, that map the positions of millions of stars across most of\nthe visible sky. By digging into the data with sophisticated computer programs, astronomers have turned up\nnumerous tiny, faint dwarf galaxies that are all but invisible to the eye even in those deep telescopic images.\nThese new findings may help solve a long-standing problem: the prevailing theories of how galaxies form\npredicted that there should be more dwarf galaxies around big galaxies like the Milky Way than had been\nobserved\u2014and only now do we have the tools to find these faint and tiny galaxies and begin to compare the\nnumbers of them with theoretical predictions.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nYou can read more about theSloan survey(https://openstax.org/l/30sloansurvey)and its dramatic results.\nAnd check out thisbrief animation(https://openstax.org/l/30anifliarrgal)of a flight through the\narrangement of the galaxies as revealed by the survey.\nSeveral new dwarf galaxies have also been found near the Andromeda galaxy. Such dwarf galaxies are difficult\nto find because they typically contain relatively few stars, and it is hard to distinguish them from the\nforeground stars in our own Milky Way.\nFigure 28.14is a rough sketch showing where the brighter members of theLocal Groupare located. The\naverage of the motions of all the galaxies in the Local Group indicates that its total mass is about 4 \u00d7 1012M ,\nSun\nand at least half of this mass is contained in the two giant spirals\u2014theAndromeda galaxyand theMilky Way\nGalaxy. And bear in mind that a substantial amount of the mass in the Local Group is in the form of dark\nmatter.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.3 \u2022 The Distribution of Galaxies in Space 945\nFigure28.14Local Group.This illustration shows some members of the Local Group of galaxies, with our Milky Way at the center.\nThe exploded view at the top shows the region closest to the Milky Way and fits into the bigger view at the bottom as shown by the\ndashed lines. The three largest galaxies among the three dozen or so members of the Local Group are all spirals; the others are\nsmall irregular galaxies and dwarf ellipticals. A number of new members of the group have been found since this map was made.\nNeighboring Groups and Clusters\nSmall galaxy groups like ours are hard to notice at larger distances. However, there are much more substantial\ngroups calledgalaxy clustersthat are easier to spot even many millions of light-years away. Such clusters are\ndescribed aspoororrichdepending on how many galaxies they contain. Rich clusters have thousands or even\ntens of thousands of galaxies, although many of the galaxies are quite faint and hard to detect.\nThe nearest moderately rich galaxy cluster is called theVirgo Cluster, after the constellation in which it is seen.\nIt is about 50 million light-years away and contains thousands of members, of which a few are shown inFigure\n28.15. The giant elliptical (and very active) galaxy M87, which you came to know and love in the chapter on\nActive Galaxies, Quasars, and Supermassive Black Holes, belongs to the Virgo Cluster. 946 28 \u2022 The Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies\nFigure28.15Central Region of the Virgo Cluster.Virgo is the nearest rich cluster and is at a distance of about 50 million light-\nyears. It contains hundreds of bright galaxies. In this picture you can see only the central part of the cluster, including the giant\nelliptical galaxy M87, just below center. Other spirals and ellipticals are visible; the two galaxies to the top right are known as \u201cThe\nEyes.\u201d (credit: modification of work by Chris Mihos (Case Western Reserve University)/ESO)\nA good example of a cluster that is much larger than the Virgo complex is theComa cluster, with a diameter of\nat least 10 million light-years (Figure 28.16). A little over 300 million light-years distant, this cluster is centered\non two giant ellipticals whose luminosities equal about 400 billion Suns each. Thousands of galaxies have been\nobserved in Coma, but the galaxies we see are almost certainly only part of what is really there. Dwarf galaxies\nare too faint to be seen at the distance of Coma, but we expect they are part of this cluster just as they are part\nof nearer ones. If so, then Coma likely contains tens of thousands of galaxies. The total mass of this cluster is\nabout 4 \u00d7 1015M (enough mass to make 4 million billion stars like the Sun).\nSun\nLet\u2019s pause here for a moment of perspective. We are now discussing numbers by which even astronomers\nsometimes feel overwhelmed. The Coma cluster may have 10, 20, or 30 thousand galaxies, and each galaxy has\nbillions and billions of stars. If you were traveling at the speed of light, it would still take you more than 10\nmillion years (longer than the history of the human species) to cross this giant swarm of galaxies. And if you\nlived on a planet on the outskirts of one of these galaxies, many other members of the cluster would be close\nenough to be noteworthy sights in your nighttime sky.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.3 \u2022 The Distribution of Galaxies in Space 947\nFigure28.16Central Region of the Coma Cluster.This combined visible-light (from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey) and infrared (from\nthe Spitzer Space Telescope) image has been color coded so that faint dwarf galaxies are seen as green. Note the number of little\ngreen smudges on the image. The cluster is roughly 320 million light-years away from us. (credit: modification of work by NASA/JPL-\nCaltech/L. Jenkins (GSFC))\nReally rich clusters such as Coma usually have a high concentration of galaxies near the center. We can see\ngiant elliptical galaxies in these central regions but few, if any, spiral galaxies. The spirals that do exist\ngenerally occur on the outskirts of clusters.\nWe might say that ellipticals are highly \u201csocial\u201d: they are often found in groups and very much enjoy \u201changing\nout\u201d with other ellipticals in crowded situations. It is precisely in such crowds that collisions are most likely\nand, as we discussed earlier, we think that most large ellipticals are built through mergers of smaller galaxies.\nSpirals, on the other hand, are more \u201cshy\u201d: they are more likely to be found in poor clusters or on the edges of\nrich clusters where collisions are less likely to disrupt the spiral arms or strip out the gas needed for continued\nstar formation.\nASTRONOMY BASICS\nGravitational Lensing\nAs we saw inBlack Holes and Curved Spacetime, spacetime is more strongly curved in regions where the\ngravitational field is strong. Light passing very near a concentration of matter appears to follow a curved\npath. In the case of starlight passing close to the Sun, we measure the position of the distant star to be\nslightly different from its true position.\nNow let\u2019s consider the case of light from a distant galaxy or quasar that passes near a concentration of\nmatter such as a cluster of galaxies on its journey to our telescopes. According to general relativity, the light\npath may be bent in a variety of ways; as a result we can observe distorted and even multiple images\n(Figure 28.17). 948 28 \u2022 The Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies\nFigure28.17Gravitational Lensing.This drawing shows how agravitational lenscan make two images. Two light rays from a\ndistant quasar are shown being bent while passing a foreground galaxy; they then arrive together at Earth. Although the two\nbeams of light contain the same information, they now appear to come from two different points on the sky. This sketch is\noversimplified and not to scale, but it gives a rough idea of the lensing phenomenon.\nGravitational lenses can produce not only double images, as shown inFigure 28.17, but also multiple\nimages, arcs, or rings. The first gravitational lens discovered, in 1979, showed two images of the same\ndistant object. Eventually, astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope to capture remarkable images of\nthe effects of gravitational lenses. One example is shown inFigure 28.18.\nFigure28.18Multiple Images of a Gravitationally Lensed Supernova.Light from a supernova at a distance of 9 billion light-\nyears passed near a galaxy in a cluster at a distance of about 5 billion light-years. In the enlarged inset view of the galaxy, the\narrows point to the multiple images of the exploding star. The images are arranged around the galaxy in a cross-shaped pattern\ncalled an Einstein Cross. The blue streaks wrapping around the galaxy are the stretched images of the supernova\u2019s host spiral\ngalaxy, which has been distorted by the warping of space.

Lotz (STScI) and the Frontier Fields team; M.\nPostman (STScI) and the CLASH team; and Z. Levay (STScI))\nGeneral relativity predicts that the light from a distant object may also be amplified by the lensing effect,\nthereby making otherwise invisible objects bright enough to detect. This is particularly useful for probing\nthe earliest stages of galaxy formation, when the universe was young.Figure 28.19shows an example of a\nvery distant faint galaxy that we can study in detail only because its light path passes through a large\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.3 \u2022 The Distribution of Galaxies in Space 949\nconcentration of massive galaxies and we now see a brighter image of it.\nFigure28.19Distorted Images of a Distant Galaxy Produced by Gravitational Lensing in a Galaxy Cluster.The rounded\noutlines show the location of distinct, distorted images of the background galaxy resulting from lensing by the mass in the\ncluster. The image in the box at lower left is a reconstruction of what the lensed galaxy would look like in the absence of the\ncluster, based on a model of the cluster\u2019s mass distribution, which can be derived from studying the distorted galaxy images. The\nreconstruction shows far more detail about the galaxy than could have been seen in the absence of lensing. As the image shows,\nthis galaxy contains regions of star formation glowing like bright Christmas tree bulbs. These are much brighter than any star-\nformation regions in our Milky Way Galaxy. (credit: modification of work by NASA, ESA, and Z. Levay (STScI))\nWe should note that the visible mass in a galaxy is not the only possible gravitational lens. Dark matter can\nalso reveal itself by producing this effect. Astronomers are using lensed images from all over the sky to\nlearn more about where dark matter is located and how much of it exists.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nYou can use theGravitational Lensing Simulator(https://openstax.org/l/30gravitlensing)to explore how\nthe distance and mass of a cluster of galaxies affects the offset of lensed images of a very distant galaxy.\nInstructions are available by clicking on Help. 950 28 \u2022 The Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies\nSuperclusters and Voids\nAfter astronomers discovered clusters of galaxies, they naturally wondered whether there were still larger\nstructures in the universe. Do clusters of galaxies gather together? To answer this question, we must be able\nto map large parts of the universe in three dimensions. We must know not only the position of each galaxy on\nthe sky (that\u2019s two dimensions) but also its distance from us (the third dimension).\nThis means we must be able to measure the redshift of each galaxy in our map. Taking a spectrum of each\nindividual galaxy to do this is a much more time-consuming task than simply counting galaxies seen in\ndifferent directions on the sky, as Hubble did. Today, astronomers have found ways to get the spectra of many\ngalaxies in the same field of view (sometimes hundreds or even thousands at a time) to cut down the time it\ntakes to finish their three-dimensional maps. Larger telescopes are also able to measure the redshifts\u2014and\ntherefore the distances\u2014of much more distant galaxies and (again) to do so much more quickly than\npreviously possible.\nAnother challenge astronomers faced in deciding how to go about constructing a map of the universe is\nsimilar to that confronted by the first team of explorers in a huge, uncharted territory on Earth. Since there is\nonly one band of explorers and an enormous amount of land, they have to make choices about where to go\nfirst. One strategy might be to strike out in a straight line in order to get a sense of the terrain. They might, for\nexample, cross some mostly empty prairies and then hit a dense forest. As they make their way through the\nforest, they learn how thick it is in the direction they are traveling, but not its width to their left or right. Then a\nriver crosses their path; as they wade across, they can measure its width but learn nothing about its length.\nStill, as they go on in their straight line, they begin to get some sense of what the landscape is like and can\nmake at least part of a map. Other explorers, striking out in other directions, will someday help fill in the\nremaining parts of that map.\nAstronomers have traditionally had to make the same sort of choices. We cannot explore the universe in every\ndirection to infinite \u201cdepth\u201d or sensitivity: there are far too many galaxies and far too few telescopes to do the\njob. But we can pick a single direction or a small slice of the sky and start mapping the galaxies. Margaret\nGeller, the late John Huchra, and their students at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics pioneered\nthis technique, and several other groups have extended their work to cover larger volumes of space.\nVOYAGERS IN ASTRONOMY\nMargaret Geller: Cosmic Surveyor\nBorn in 1947, MargaretGelleris the daughter of a chemist who encouraged her interest in science and\nhelped her visualize the three-dimensional structure of molecules as a child. (It was a skill that would later\ncome in very handy for visualizing the three-dimensional structure of the universe.) She remembers being\nbored in elementary school, but she was encouraged to read on her own by her parents. Her recollections\nalso include subtle messages from teachers that mathematics (her strong early interest) was not a field for\ngirls, but she did not allow herself to be deterred.\nGeller obtained a BA in physics from the University of California at Berkeley and became the second woman\nto receive a PhD in physics from Princeton. There, while working with James Peebles, one of the world\u2019s\nleading cosmologists, she became interested in problems relating to the large-scale structure of the\nuniverse. In 1980, she accepted a research position at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics,\none of the nation\u2019s most dynamic institutions for astronomy research. She saw that to make progress in\nunderstanding how galaxies and clusters are organized, a far more intensive series of surveys was\nrequired. Although it would not bear fruit for many years, Geller and her collaborators began the long,\narduous task of mapping the galaxies (Figure 28.20).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.3 \u2022 The Distribution of Galaxies in Space 951\nFigure28.20Margaret Geller.Geller\u2019s work mapping and researching galaxies has helped us to better understand the structure\nof the universe. (credit: modification of work by Massimo Ramella)\nHer team was fortunate to be given access to a telescope that could be dedicated to their project, the\n60-inch reflector on Mount Hopkins, near Tucson, Arizona, where they and their assistants took spectra to\ndetermine galaxy distances. To get a slice of the universe, they pointed their telescope at a predetermined\nposition in the sky and then let the rotation of Earth bring new galaxies into their field of view. In this way,\nthey measured the positions and redshifts of over 18,000 galaxies and made a wide range of interesting\nmaps to display their data. Their surveys now include \u201cslices\u201d in both the Northern and Southern\nHemispheres.\nAs news of her important work spread beyond the community of astronomers, Geller received a MacArthur\nFoundation Fellowship in 1990. These fellowships, popularly called \u201cgenius awards,\u201d are designed to\nrecognize truly creative work in a wide range of fields. Geller continues to have a strong interest in\nvisualization and has (with filmmaker Boyd Estus) made several award-winning videos explaining her work\nto nonscientists (one is titledSo Many Galaxies. . .So Little Time). She has appeared on a variety of national\nnews and documentary programs, including theMacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour,The Astronomers, andThe\nInfinite Voyage. Energetic and outspoken, she has given talks on her work to many audiences around the\ncountry, and works hard to find ways to explain the significance of her pioneering surveys to the public.\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to discover something that nobody\u2019s seen before.

A plot of the\ndistribution of galaxies mapped by the Sloan survey is shown inFigure 28.21. To the surprise of astronomers,\nmaps like the one in the figure showed that clusters of galaxies are not arranged uniformly throughout the\nuniverse, but are found in huge filamentarysuperclustersthat look like great arcs of inkblots splattered 952 28 \u2022 The Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies\nacross a page.

The point at the center corresponds to the Milky Way and might say \u201cYou Are Here!\u201d Points on the map moving outward from\nthe center are farther away. The distance to the galaxies is indicated by their redshifts (following Hubble\u2019s law), shown on the\nhorizontal line going right from the center.

Hour angle on the sky is shown around the circumference of the\ncircular graph. The colors of the galaxies indicate the ages of their stars, with the redder color showing galaxies that are made of\nolder stars. The outer circle is at a distance of two billion light-years from us. Note that red (older stars) galaxies are more strongly\nclustered than blue galaxies (young stars). The unmapped areas are where our view of the universe is obstructed by dust in our own\nGalaxy. (credit: modification of work by M. Blanton and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey)\nSeparating the filaments and sheets in a supercluster arevoids, which look like huge empty bubbles walled in\nby the great arcs of galaxies. They have typical diameters of 150 million light-years, with the clusters of\ngalaxies concentrated along their walls. The whole arrangement of filaments and voids reminds us of a\nsponge, the inside of a honeycomb, or a hunk of Swiss cheese with very large holes. If you take a good slice or\ncross-section through any of these, you will see something that looks roughly likeFigure 28.21.\nBefore these voids were discovered, most astronomers would probably have predicted that the regions\nbetween giant clusters of galaxies were filled with many small groups of galaxies, or even with isolated\nindividual galaxies. Careful searches within these voids have found few galaxies of any kind. Apparently, 90\npercent of the galaxies occupy less than 10 percent of the volume of space.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.3 \u2022 The Distribution of Galaxies in Space 953\nEXAMPLE 28.1\nGalaxy Distribution\nTo determine the distribution of galaxies in three-dimensional space, astronomers have to measure their\npositions and their redshifts. The larger the volume of space surveyed, the more likely the measurement is\na fair sample of the universe as a whole. However, the work involved increases very rapidly as you increase\nthe volume covered by the survey.\nLet\u2019s do a quick calculation to see why this is so.\nSuppose that you have completed a survey of all the galaxies within 30 million light-years and you now\nwant to survey to 60 million light-years. What volume of space is covered by your second survey? How\nmuch larger is this volume than the volume of your first survey? Remember that the volume of a sphere,V,\nis given by the formulaV= 4/3\u03c0R3, whereRis the radius of the sphere.\nSolution\nSince the volume of a sphere depends onR3and the second survey reaches twice as far in distance, it will\ncover a volume that is 23= 8 times larger. The total volume covered by the second survey will be (4/3)\u03c0 \u00d7 (60\nmillion light-years)3= 9 \u00d7 1023light-years3.\nCheck Your Learning\nSuppose you now want to expand your survey to 90 million light-years. What volume of space is covered,\nand how much larger is it than the volume of the second survey?\nAnswer:\nThe total volume covered is (4/3)\u03c0 \u00d7 (90 million light-years)3= 3.05 \u00d7 1024light-years3. The survey reaches 3\ntimes as far in distance, so it will cover a volume that is 33= 27 times larger.\nEven larger, more sensitive telescopes and surveys are currently being designed and built to peer farther and\nfarther out in space and back in time. The new 50-meter Large Millimeter Telescope in Mexico and the\nAtacama Large Millimeter Array in Chile can detect far-infrared and millimeter-wave radiation from massive\nstarbursting galaxies at redshifts and thus distances more than 90% of the way back to the Big Bang. These\ncannot be observed with visible light because their star formation regions are wrapped in clouds of thick dust.\nAnd in 2021, the 6.5-meter-diameter James Webb Space Telescope is scheduled to launch. It will be the first\nnew major visible light and near-infrared telescope in space since Hubble was launched more than 30 years\nearlier. One of the major goals of this telescope is to observe directly the light of the first galaxies and even the\nfirst stars to shine, less than half a billion years after the Big Bang.\nAt this point, if you have been thinking about our discussions of the expanding universe inGalaxies, you may\nbe wondering what exactly inFigure 28.21is expanding. We know that the galaxies and clusters of galaxies are\nheld together by their gravity and do not expand as the universe does. However, the voids do grow larger and\nthe filaments move farther apart as space stretches (seeThe Big Bang).\nMAKING CONNECTIONS\nAstronomy and Technology: The Sloan Digital Sky Survey\nIn Edwin Hubble\u2019s day, spectra of galaxies had to be taken one at a time. The faint light of a distant galaxy\ngathered by a large telescope was put through a slit, and then a spectrometer (also called a spectrograph) 954 28 \u2022 The Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies\nwas used to separate the colors and record the spectrum. This was a laborious process, ill suited to the\ndemands of making large-scale maps that require the redshifts of many thousands of galaxies.\nBut new technology has come to the rescue of astronomers who seek three-dimensional maps of the\nuniverse of galaxies. One ambitious survey of the sky was produced using a special telescope, camera, and\nspectrograph atop the Sacramento Mountains of New Mexico. Called theSloan Digital Sky Survey(SDSS),\nafter the foundation that provided a large part of the funding, the program used a 2.5-meter telescope\n(about the same aperture as the Hubble) as a wide-angle astronomical camera. During a mapping program\nlasting more than ten years, astronomers used the SDSS\u2019s 30 charge-coupled devices (CCDs)\u2014sensitive\nelectronic light detectors similar to those used in many digital cameras and cell phones\u2014to take images of\nover 500 million objects and spectra of over 3 million, covering more than one-quarter of the celestial\nsphere. Like many large projects in modern science, the Sloan Survey involved scientists and engineers\nfrom many different institutions, ranging from universities to national laboratories.\nEvery clear night for more than a decade, astronomers used the instrument to make images recording the\nposition and brightness of celestial objects in long strips of the sky. The information in each strip was\ndigitally recorded and preserved for future generations. When the seeing (recall this term from\nAstronomical Instruments) was only adequate, the telescope was used for taking spectra of galaxies and\nquasars\u2014but it did so for up to640 objects at a time.\nThe key to the success of the project was a series ofoptical fibers, thin tubes of flexible glass that can\ntransmit light from a source to the CCD that then records the spectrum. After taking images of a part of the\nsky and identifying which objects are galaxies, project scientists drilled an aluminum plate with holes for\nattaching fibers at the location of each galaxy. The telescope was then pointed at the right section of the\nsky, and the fibers led the light of each galaxy to the spectrometer for individual recording (Figure 28.22).\nFigure28.22Sloan Digital Sky Survey.(a) The Sloan Digital Sky Survey telescope is seen here in front of the Sacramento\nMountains in New Mexico. (b) Astronomer Richard Kron inserts some of the optical fibers into the pre-drilled plate to enable the\ninstruments to make many spectra of galaxies at the same time. (credit a, b: modification of work by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey)\nAbout an hour was sufficient for each set of spectra, and the pre-drilled aluminum plates could be switched\nquickly. Thus, it was possible to take as many as 5000 spectra in one night (provided the weather was good\nenough).\nThe galaxy survey led to a more comprehensive map of the sky than has ever before been possible,\nallowing astronomers to test their ideas about large-scale structure and the evolution of galaxies against an\nimpressive array of real data.\nThe information recorded by the Sloan Survey staggers the imagination. The data came in at 8 megabytes\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.4 \u2022 The Challenge of Dark Matter 955\nper second (this means 8 million individual numbers or characters every second). Over the course of the\nproject, scientists recorded over 15 terabytes, or 15 thousand billion bytes, which they estimate is\ncomparable to the information contained in the Library of Congress. Organizing and sorting this volume of\ndata and extracting the useful scientific results it contains is a formidable challenge, even in our\ninformation age. Like many other fields, astronomy has now entered an era of \u201cBig Data,\u201d requiring\nsupercomputers and advanced computer algorithms to sift through all those terabytes of data efficiently.\nOne very successful solution to the challenge of dealing with such large datasets is to turn to \u201ccitizen\nscience,\u201d or crowd-sourcing, an approach the SDSS helped pioneer. The human eye is very good at\nrecognizing subtle differences among shapes, such as between two different spiral galaxies, while\ncomputers often fail at such tasks. When Sloan project astronomers wanted to catalog the shapes of some\nof the millions of galaxies in their new images, they launched the \u201cGalaxy Zoo\u201d project: volunteers around\nthe world were given a short training course online, then were provided with a few dozen galaxy images to\nclassify by eye. The project was wildly successful, resulting in over 40 million galaxy classifications by more\nthan 100,000 volunteers and the discovery of whole new types of galaxies.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nLearn more about how you can be part ofthe project of classifying galaxies(https://openstax.org/l/\n30classgalax)in this citizen science effort.

But, as we have pointed out in several earlier chapters (especiallyThe Milky Way Galaxy), it is\nnow clear that galaxies contain large amounts of dark matter as well. There is much moredark matter, in fact,\nthan matter we can see\u2014which means it would be foolish to ignore the effect of this unseen material in our\ntheories about the structure of the universe. (As many a ship captain in the polar seas found out too late, the\npart of the iceberg visible above the ocean\u2019s surface was not necessarily the only part he needed to pay\nattention to.) Dark matter turns out to be extremely important in determining the evolution of galaxies and of\nthe universe as a whole.\nThe idea that much of the universe is filled with dark matter may seem like a bizarre concept, but we can cite a\nhistorical example of \u201cdark matter\u201d much closer to home. In the mid-nineteenth century, measurements\nshowed that the planet Uranus did not follow exactly the orbit predicted from Newton\u2019s laws if one added up\nthe gravitational forces of all the known objects in the solar system. Some people worried that Newton\u2019s laws\nmay simply not work so far out in our solar system. But the more straightforward interpretation was to 956 28 \u2022 The Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies\nattribute Uranus\u2019 orbital deviations to the gravitational effects of a new planet that had not yet been seen.\nCalculations showed where that planet had to be, and Neptune was discovered just about in the predicted\nlocation.\nIn the same way, astronomers now routinely determine the location and amount of dark matter in galaxies by\nmeasuring its gravitational effects on objects we can see. And, by measuring the way that galaxies move in\nclusters, scientists have discovered that dark matter is also distributed among the galaxies in the clusters.\nSince the environment surrounding a galaxy is important in its development, dark matter must play a central\nrole in galaxy evolution as well. Indeed, it appears that dark matter makes up most of the matter in the\nuniverse. But whatisdark matter? What is it made of? We\u2019ll look next at the search for dark matter and the\nquest to determine its nature.\nDark Matter in the Local Neighborhood\nIs theredark matterin our own solar system? Astronomers have examined the orbits of the known planets\nand of spacecraft as they journey to the outer planets and beyond. No deviations have been found from the\norbits predicted on the basis of the masses of objects already discovered in our solar system and the theory of\ngravity. We therefore conclude that there is no evidence that there are large amounts of dark matter nearby.\nAstronomers have also looked for evidence of dark matter in the region of the Milky Way Galaxy that lies\nwithin a few hundred light-years of the Sun. In this vicinity, most of the stars are restricted to a thin disk. It is\npossible to calculate how much mass the disk must contain in order to keep the stars from wandering far\nabove or below it. The total matter that must be in the disk is less than twice the amount of luminous matter.\nThis means that no more than half of the mass in the region near the Sun can be dark matter.\nDark Matter in and around Galaxies\nIn contrast to our local neighborhood near the Sun and solar system, there is (as we saw inThe Milky Way\nGalaxy) ample evidence strongly suggesting that about 90% of the mass in the entire galaxy is in the form of a\nhalo of dark matter. In other words, there is apparently about nine times more dark matter than visible\nmatter. Astronomers have found some stars in the outer regions of the Milky Way beyond its bright disk, and\nthese stars are revolving very rapidly around its center. The mass contained in all the stars and all the\ninterstellar matter we can detect in the galaxy does not exert enough gravitational force to explain how those\nfast-moving stars remain in their orbits and do not fly away. Only by having large amounts of unseen matter\ncould the galaxy be holding on to those fast-moving outer stars. The same result is found for other spiral\ngalaxies as well.\nFigure 28.23is an example of the kinds of observations astronomers are making, for the Triangulum galaxy, a\nmember of our Local Group. The observed rotation of spiral galaxies like Andromeda is usually seen in plots,\nknown asrotation curves,that show velocity versus distance from the galaxy center. Such plots suggest that\nthe dark matter is found in a large halo surrounding the luminous parts of each galaxy. The radius of the halos\naround the Milky Way and Andromeda may be as large as 300,000 light-years, much larger than the visible size\nof these galaxies.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.4 \u2022 The Challenge of Dark Matter 957\nFigure28.23Rotation Indicates Dark Matter.We see the Milky Way\u2019s neighbor, the Triangulum galaxy, with a graph that shows\nthe velocity at which stars and clouds of gas orbit the galaxy at different distances from the center (red line). As is true of the Milky\nWay, the rotational velocity (or orbital speed) does not decrease with distance from the center, which is what you would expect if an\nassembly of objects rotates around a common center. A calculation (blue line) based on the total mass visible as stars, gas, and dust\npredicts that the velocity should be much lower at larger distances from the center. The discrepancy between the two curves implies\nthe presence of a halo of massive dark matter extending outside the boundary of the luminous matter. This dark matter causes\neverything in the galaxy to orbit faster than the observed matter alone could explain. (credit background: modification of work by\nESO)\nDark Matter in Clusters of Galaxies\nGalaxies in clusters also move around: they orbit the cluster\u2019s center of mass. It is not possible for us to follow\na galaxy around its entire orbit because that typically takes about a billion years. It is possible, however, to\nmeasure the velocities with which galaxies in a cluster are moving, and then estimate what the total mass in\nthe cluster must be to keep the individual galaxies from flying out of the cluster. The observations indicate that\nthe mass of the galaxies alone cannot keep the cluster together\u2014some other gravity must again be present.\nThe total amount of dark matter in clusters exceeds by more than ten times the luminous mass contained\nwithin the galaxies themselves, indicating thatdark matterexists between galaxies as well as inside them.\nThere is another approach we can take to measuring the amount of dark matter in clusters of galaxies. As we\nsaw, the universe is expanding, but this expansion is not perfectly uniform, thanks to the interfering hand of\ngravity. Suppose, for example, that a galaxy lies outside but relatively close to a rich cluster of galaxies. The\ngravitational force of the cluster will tug on that neighboring galaxy and slow down the rate at which it moves\naway from the cluster due to the expansion of the universe.\nConsider theLocal Groupof galaxies, lying on the outskirts of the Virgo Supercluster. The mass concentrated\nat the center of theVirgo Clusterexerts a gravitational force on the Local Group. As a result, the Local Group is\nmoving away from the center of the Virgo Cluster at a velocity a few hundred kilometers per second slower\nthan the Hubble law predicts. By measuring such deviations from a smooth expansion, astronomers can\nestimate the total amount of mass contained in large clusters.\nThere are two other very useful methods for measuring the amount of dark matter in galaxy clusters, and\nboth of them have produced results in general agreement with the method of measuring galaxy velocities:\ngravitational lensing and X-ray emission. Let\u2019s take a look at both.\nAs AlbertEinsteinshowed in his theory of general relativity, the presence of mass bends the surrounding\nfabric of spacetime. Light follows those bends, so very massive objects can bend light significantly. You saw 958 28 \u2022 The Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies\nexamples of this in the Astronomy Basics feature boxGravitational Lensingin the previous section. Visible\ngalaxies are not the only possible gravitational lenses. Dark matter can also reveal its presence by producing\nthis effect.Figure 28.24shows a galaxy cluster that is acting like a gravitational lens; the streaks and arcs you\nsee on the picture are lensed images of more distant galaxies. Gravitational lensing is well enough understood\nthat astronomers can use the many ovals and arcs seen in this image to calculate detailed maps of how much\nmatter there is in the cluster and how that mass is distributed. The result from studies of many such\ngravitational lens clusters shows that, like individual galaxies, galaxy clusters contain more than ten times as\nmuch dark matter as luminous matter.\nFigure28.24Cluster Abell 2218.This view from the Hubble Space Telescope shows the massive galaxy cluster Abell 2218 at a\ndistance of about 2 billion light-years. Most of the yellowish objects are galaxies belonging to the cluster. But notice the numerous\nlong, thin streaks, many of them blue; those are the distorted and magnified images of even more distant background galaxies,\ngravitationally lensed by the enormous mass of the intervening cluster. By carefully analyzing the lensed images, astronomers can\nconstruct a map of the dark matter that dominates the mass of the cluster. (credit: modification of work by NASA, ESA, and Johan\nRichard (Caltech))\nThe third method astronomers use to detect and measure dark matter in galaxy clusters is to image them in\nthe light of X-rays. When the first sensitive X-ray telescopes were launched into orbit around Earth in the 1970s\nand trained on massive galaxy clusters, it was quickly discovered that the clusters emit copious X-ray radiation\n(seeFigure 28.25). Most stars do not emit much X-ray radiation, and neither does most of the gas or dust\nbetween the stars inside galaxies. What could be emitting the X-rays seen from virtually all massive galaxy\nclusters?\nIt turns out that just as galaxies have gas distributed between their stars, clusters of galaxies have gas\ndistributed between their galaxies. The particles in these huge reservoirs of gas are not just sitting still; rather,\nthey are constantly moving, zooming around under the influence of the cluster\u2019s immense gravity like mini\nplanets around a giant sun. As they move and bump against each other, the gas heats up hotter and hotter\nuntil, at temperatures as high as 100 million K, it shines brightly at X-ray wavelengths. The more mass the\ncluster has, the faster the motions, the hotter the gas, and the brighter the X-rays. Astronomers calculate that\nthe mass present to induce those motions must be about ten times the mass they can see in the clusters,\nincluding all the galaxies and all the gas. Once again, this is evidence that the galaxy clusters are seen to be\ndominated by dark matter.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.4 \u2022 The Challenge of Dark Matter 959\nFigure28.25X-Ray Image of a Galaxy Cluster.This composite image shows the galaxy cluster Abell 1689 at a distance of 2.3 billion\nlight-years. The finely detailed views of the galaxies, most of them yellow, are in visible and near-infrared light from the Hubble\nSpace Telescope, while the diffuse purple haze shows X-rays as seen by Chandra X-ray Observatory. The abundant X-rays, the\ngravitationally lensed images (thin curving arcs) of background galaxies, and the measured velocities of galaxies in the clusters all\nshow that the total mass of Abell 1689\u2014most of it dark matter\u2014is about 1015solar masses. (credit: modification of work by NASA/\nESA/JPL-Caltech/Yale/CNRS)\nMass-to-Light Ratio\nWe described the use of themass-to-light ratioto characterize the matter in galaxies or clusters of galaxies in\nProperties of Galaxies. For systems containing mostly old stars, the mass-to-light ratio is typically 10 to 20,\nwhere mass and light are measured in units of the Sun\u2019s mass and luminosity. A mass-to-light ratio of 100 or\nmore is a signal that a substantial amount of dark matter is present.Table 28.1summarizes the results of\nmeasurements of mass-to-light ratios for various classes of objects. Very large mass-to-light ratios are found\nfor all systems of galaxy size and larger, indicating that dark matter is present in all these types of objects. This\nis why we say that dark matter apparently makes up most of the total mass of the universe.\nMass-To-Light Ratios\nType of Object Mass-to-Light Ratio\nSun 1\nMatter in vicinity of Sun 2\nMass in Milky Way within 80,000 light-years of the center 10\nSmall groups of galaxies 50\u2013150\nRich clusters of galaxies 250\u2013300\nTable28.1\nThe clustering of galaxies can be used to derive the total amount of mass in a given region of space, while 960 28 \u2022 The Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies\nvisible radiation is a good indicator of where the luminous mass is. Studies show that the dark matter and\nluminous matter are very closely associated. The dark matter halos do extend beyond the luminous\nboundaries of the galaxies that they surround. However, where there are large clusters of galaxies, you will\nalso find large amounts of dark matter. Voids in the galaxy distribution are also voids in the distribution of\ndark matter.\nWhat Is the Dark Matter?\nHow do we go about figuring out what thedark matterconsists of? The technique we might use depends on\nits composition. Let\u2019s consider the possibility that some of the dark matter is made up of normal particles:\nprotons, neutrons, and electrons. Suppose these particles were assembled into black holes, brown dwarfs, or\nwhite dwarfs. If the black holes had no accretion disks, they would be invisible to us. White and brown dwarfs\ndo emit some radiation but have such low luminosities that they cannot be seen at distances greater than a\nfew thousand light-years.\nWe can, however, look for such compact objects because they can act asgravitational lenses. (See the\nAstronomy Basics feature boxGravitational Lensing.) Suppose the dark matter in the halo of the Milky Way\nwere made up of black holes, brown dwarfs, and white dwarfs. These objects have been whimsically dubbed\nMACHOs (MAssive Compact Halo Objects). If an invisibleMACHOpasses directly between a distant star and\nEarth, it acts as a gravitational lens, focusing the light from the distant star. This causes the star to appear to\nbrighten over a time interval of a few hours to several days before returning to its normal brightness. Since we\ncan\u2019t predict when any given star might brighten this way, we have to monitor huge numbers of stars to catch\none in the act. There are not enough astronomers to keep monitoring so many stars, but today\u2019s automated\ntelescopes and computer systems can do it for us.\nResearch teams making observations of millions of stars in the nearby galaxy called the Large Magellanic\nCloud have reported several examples of the type of brightening expected if MACHOs are present in the halo\nof the Milky Way (Figure 28.26). However, there are not enough MACHOs in the halo of the Milky Way to\naccount for the mass of the dark matter in the halo.\nFigure28.26Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.Here, the two small galaxies we call theLarge Magellanic CloudandSmall\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.4 \u2022 The Challenge of Dark Matter 961\nMagellanic Cloudcan be seen above the auxiliary telescopes for the Very Large Telescope Array on Cerro Paranal in Chile. You can\nsee from the number of stars that are visible that this is a very dark site for doing astronomy. (credit: ESO/J. Colosimo)\nThis result, along with a variety of other experiments, leads us to conclude that the types of matter we are\nfamiliar with can make up only a tiny portion of the dark matter. Another possibility is that dark matter is\ncomposed of some new type of particle\u2014one that researchers are now trying to detect in laboratories here on\nEarth (seeThe Big Bang).\nThe kinds of dark matter particles that astronomers and physicists have proposed generally fall into two main\ncategories: hot and cold dark matter. The termshotandcolddon\u2019t refer to true temperatures, but rather to\nthe average velocities of the particles, analogous to how we might think of particles of air moving in your room\nright now. In a cold room, the air particles move more slowly on average than in a warm room.\nIn the early universe, if dark matter particles easily moved fast and far compared to the lumps and bumps of\nordinary matter that eventually became galaxies and larger structures, we call those particleshot dark\nmatter. In that case, smaller lumps and bumps would be smeared out by the particle motions, meaning fewer\nsmall galaxies would get made.\nOn the other hand, if the dark matter particles moved slowly and covered only small distances compared to\nthe sizes of the lumps in the early universe, we call thatcold dark matter. Their slow speeds and energy\nwould mean that even the smaller lumps of ordinary matter would survive to grow into small galaxies. By\nlooking at when galaxies formed and how they evolve, we can use observations to distinguish between the\ntwo kinds of dark matter. So far, observations seem most consistent with models based on cold dark matter.\nSolving the dark matter problem is one of the biggest challenges facing astronomers. After all, we can hardly\nunderstand the evolution of galaxies and the long-term history of the universe without understanding what its\nmost massive component is made of. For example, we need to know just what role dark matter played in\nstarting the higher-density \u201cseeds\u201d that led to the formation of galaxies. And since many galaxies have large\nhalos made of dark matter, how does this affect their interactions with one another and the shapes and types\nof galaxies that their collisions create?\nAstronomers armed with various theories are working hard to produce models of galaxy structure and\nevolution that take dark matter into account in just the right way. Even though we don\u2019t know what the dark\nmatter is, we do have some clues about how it affected the formation of the very first galaxies. As we will see\ninThe Big Bang, careful measurements of the microwave radiation left over after the Big Bang have allowed\nastronomers to set very tight limits on the actual sizes of those early seeds that led to the formation of the\nlarge galaxies that we see in today\u2019s universe. Astronomers have also measured the relative numbers and\ndistances between galaxies and clusters of different sizes in the universe today. So far, most of the evidence\nseems to weigh heavily in favor of cold dark matter, and most current models of galaxy and large-scale\nstructure formation use cold dark matter as their main ingredient.\nAs if the presence ofdark matter\u2014a mysterious substance that exerts gravity and outweighs all the known\nstars and galaxies in the universe but does not emit or absorb light\u2014were not enough, there is an even more\nbaffling and equally important constituent of the universe that has only recently been discovered: we have\ncalled itdark energyin parallel with dark matter. We will say more about it and explore its effects on the\nevolution of the universe inThe Big Bang. For now, we can complete our inventory of the contents of the\nuniverse by noting that it appears that the entire universe contains some mysterious energy that pushes\nspacetime apart, taking galaxies and the larger structures made of galaxies along with it. Observations show\nthat dark energy becomes more and more important relative to gravity as the universe ages. As a result, the\nexpansion of the universe is accelerating, and this acceleration seems to be happening mostly since the\nuniverse was about half its current age.\nWhat we see when we peer out into the universe\u2014the light from trillions of stars in hundreds of billions of\ngalaxies wrapped in intricate veils of gas and dust\u2014is therefore actually only a sprinkling of icing on top of the 962 28 \u2022 The Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies\ncake: as we will see inThe Big Bang, when we look outside galaxies and clusters of galaxies at the universe as\na whole, astronomers find that for every gram of luminous normal matter, such as protons, neutrons,\nelectrons, and atoms in the universe, there are about 4 grams of nonluminous normal matter, mainly\nintergalactic hydrogen and helium. There are about 27 grams of dark matter, and the energy equivalent\n(remember Einstein\u2019s famousE=mc2) of about 68 grams of dark energy. Dark matter, and (as we will see)\neven more so dark energy, are dramatic demonstrations of what we have tried to emphasize throughout this\nbook: science is always a \u201cprogress report,\u201d and we often encounter areas where we have more questions\nthan answers.\nLet\u2019s next put together all these clues to trace the life history of galaxies and large-scale structure in the\nuniverse. What follows is the current consensus, but research in this field is moving rapidly, and some of these\nideas will probably be modified as new observations are made.\n28.5 The Formation and Evolution of Galaxies and Structure in the Universe\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nSummarize the main theories attempting to explain how individual galaxies formed\nExplain how tiny \u201cseeds\u201d of dark matter in the early universe grew by gravitational attraction over billions\nof years into the largest structures observed in the universe: galaxy clusters and superclusters, filaments, and\nvoids\nAs with most branches of natural science, astronomers and cosmologists always want to know the answer to\nthe question, \u201cHow did it get that way?\u201d What made galaxies and galaxy clusters, superclusters, voids, and\nfilaments look the way they do? The existence of such large filaments of galaxies and voids is an interesting\npuzzle because we have evidence (to be discussed inThe Big Bang) that the universe was extremely smooth\neven a few hundred thousand years after forming. The challenge for theoreticians is to understand how a\nnearly featureless universe changed into the complex and lumpy one that we see today. Armed with our\nobservations and current understanding of galaxy evolution over cosmic time, dark matter, and large-scale\nstructure, we are now prepared to try to answer that question on some of the largest possible scales in the\nuniverse. As we will see, the short answer to how the universe got this way is \u201cdark matter + gravity + time.\u201d\nHow Galaxies Form and Grow\nWe\u2019ve already seen that galaxies were more numerous, but smaller, bluer, and clumpier, in the distant past\nthan they are today, and that galaxy mergers play a significant role in their evolution. At the same time, we\nhave observed quasars and galaxies that emitted their light when the universe was less than a billion years\nold\u2014so we know that large condensations of matter had begun to form at least that early. We also saw in\nActive Galaxies, Quasars, and Supermassive Black Holesthat many quasars are found in the centers of\nelliptical galaxies. This means that some of the first large concentrations of matter must have evolved into the\nelliptical galaxies that we see in today\u2019s universe. It seems likely that the supermassive black holes in the\ncenters of galaxies and the spherical distribution of ordinary matter around them formed at the same time\nand through related physical processes.\nDramatic confirmation of that picture arrived only in the last decade, when astronomers discovered a curious\nempirical relationship: as we saw inActive Galaxies, Quasars, and Supermassive Black Holes, the more massive\na galaxy is, the more massive its central black hole is. Somehow, the black hole and the galaxy \u201cknow\u201d enough\nabout each other to match their growth rates.\nThere have been two main types of galaxy formation models to explain all those observations. The first asserts\nthat massive elliptical galaxies formed in a single, rapid collapse of gas and dark matter, during which virtually\nall the gas was turned quickly into stars. Afterward the galaxies changed only slowly as the stars evolved. This\nis what astronomers call a \u201ctop-down\u201d scenario.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.5 \u2022 The Formation and Evolution of Galaxies and Structure in the Universe 963\nThe second model suggests that today\u2019s giant ellipticals were formed mostly through mergers of smaller\ngalaxies that had already converted at least some of their gas into stars\u2014a \u201cbottom-up\u201d scenario. In other\nwords, astronomers have debated whether giant ellipticals formed most of their stars in the large galaxy that\nwe see today or in separate small galaxies that subsequently merged.\nSince we see some luminous quasars from when the universe was less than a billion years old, it is likely that\nat least some giant ellipticals began their evolution very early through the collapse of a single cloud. However,\nthe best evidence also seems to show that maturegiantelliptical galaxies like the ones we see nearby were\nrare before the universe was about 6 billion years old and that they are much more common today than they\nwere when the universe was young. Observations also indicate that most of the gas in elliptical galaxies was\nconverted to stars by the time the universe was about 3 billion years old, so it appears that elliptical galaxies\nhave not formed many new stars since then. They are often said to be \u201cred and dead\u201d\u2014that is, they mostly\ncontain old, cool, red stars, and there is little or no new star formation going on.\nThese observations (when considered together) suggest that the giant elliptical galaxies that we see nearby\nformed from a combination of both top-down and bottom-up mechanisms, with the most massive galaxies\nforming in the densest clusters where both processes happened very early and quickly in the history of the\nuniverse.\nThe situation with spiral galaxies is apparently very different. The bulges of these galaxies formed early, like\nthe elliptical galaxies (Figure 28.27). However, the disks formed later (remember that the stars in the disk of\nthe Milky Way are younger than the stars in the bulge and the halo) and still contain gas and dust. However,\nthe rate of star formation in spirals today is about ten times lower than it was 8 billion years ago. The number\nof stars being formed drops as the gas is used up. So spirals seem to form mostly \u201cbottom up\u201d but over a\nlonger time than ellipticals and in a more complex way, with at least two distinct phases. 964 28 \u2022 The Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies\nFigure28.27Growth of Spiral Bulges.The nuclear bulges of some spiral galaxies formed through the collapse of a single\nprotogalactic cloud (top row). Others grew over time through mergers with other smaller galaxies (bottom row).\nHubble originally thought that elliptical galaxies were young and would eventually turn into spirals, an idea we\nnow know is not true. In fact, as we saw above, it\u2019s more likely the other way around: two spirals that crash\ntogether under their mutual gravity can turn into an elliptical.\nDespite these advances in our understanding of how galaxies form and evolve, many questions remain. For\nexample, it\u2019s even possible, given current evidence, that spiral galaxies could lose their spiral arms and disks in\na merger event, making them look more like an elliptical or irregular galaxy, and then regain the disk and\narms again later if enough gas remains available. The story of how galaxies assume their final shapes is still\nbeing written as we learn more about galaxies and their environment.\nForming Galaxy Clusters, Superclusters, Voids, and Filaments\nIf individual galaxies seem to grow mostly by assembling smaller pieces together gravitationally over cosmic\ntime, what about the clusters of galaxies and larger structures such as those seen inFigure 28.21? How do we\nexplain the large-scale maps that show galaxies distributed on the walls of huge sponge- or bubble-like\nstructures spanning hundreds of millions of light-years?\nAs we saw, observations have found increasing evidence for concentrations, filaments, clusters, and\nsuperclusters of galaxies when the universe was less than 3 billion years old (Figure 28.28). This means that\nlarge concentrations of galaxies had already come together when the universe was less than a quarter as old\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.5 \u2022 The Formation and Evolution of Galaxies and Structure in the Universe 965\nas it is now.\nFigure28.28Merging Galaxies in a Distant Cluster.This Hubble image shows the core of one of the most distant galaxy clusters\nyet discovered, SpARCS 1049+56; we are seeing it as it was nearly 10 billion years ago. The surprise delivered by the image was the\n\u201ctrain wreck\u201d of chaotic galaxy shapes and blue tidal tails: apparently there are several galaxies right in the core that are merging\ntogether, the probable cause of a massive burst of star formation and bright infrared emission from the cluster. (credit: modification\nof work by NASA/STScI/ESA/JPL-Caltech/McGill)\nAlmost all the currently favored models of how large-scale structure formed in the universe tell a story similar\nto that for individual galaxies: tiny dark matter \u201cseeds\u201d in the hot cosmic soup after the Big Bang grew by\ngravity into larger and larger structures as cosmic time ticked on (Figure 28.29). The final models we construct\nwill need to be able to explain the size, shape, age, number, and spatial distribution of galaxies, clusters, and\nfilaments\u2014not only today, but also far back in time. Therefore, astronomers are working hard to measure and\nthen to model those features of large-scale structure as accurately as possible. So far, a mixture of 5% normal\natoms, 27% cold dark matter, and 68% dark energy seems to be the best way to explain all the evidence\ncurrently available (seeThe Big Bang). 966 28 \u2022 The Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies\nFigure28.29Growth of Large-Scale Structure as Calculated by Supercomputers.The boxes show how filaments and\nsuperclusters of galaxies grow over time, from a relatively smooth distribution of dark matter and gas, with few galaxies formed in\nthe first 2 billion years after the Big Bang, to the very clumpy strings of galaxies with large voids today. Compare the last image in\nthis sequence with the actual distribution of nearby galaxies shown inFigure 28.21. (credit: modification of work by CXC/MPE/\nV.Springel)\nThe box at left is labeled \u201cBig Bang,\u201d the box at center is unlabeled and the box at right is labeled \u201cPresent\u201d. A\nwhite arrow points from left to right representing the direction of time.\nScientists even have a model to explain how a nearly uniform, hot \u201csoup\u201d of particles and energy at the\nbeginning of time acquired the Swiss-cheese-like structure that we now see on the largest scales. As we will\nsee inThe Big Bang, when the universe was only a few hundred thousand years old,everythingwas at a\ntemperature of a few thousand degrees. Theorists suggest that at that early time, all the hot gas was vibrating,\nmuch as sound waves vibrate the air of a nightclub with an especially loud band. This vibrating could have\nconcentrated matter into high-density peaks and created emptier spaces between them. When the universe\ncooled, the concentrations of matter were \u201cfrozen in,\u201d and galaxies ultimately formed from the matter in these\nhigh-density regions.\nThe Big Picture\nTo finish this chapter, let\u2019s put all these ideas together to tell a coherent story of how the universe came to\nlook the way it does. Initially, as we said, the distribution of matter (both luminous and dark) was nearly, but\nnot quite exactly, smooth and uniform. That \u201cnot quite\u201d is the key to everything. Here and there were lumps\nwhere the density of matter (both luminous and dark) was ever so slightly higher than average.\nInitially, each individual lump expanded because the whole universe was expanding. However, as the universe\ncontinued to expand, the regions of higher density acquired still more mass because they exerted a slightly\nlarger than average gravitational force on surrounding material. If the inward pull of gravity was high enough,\nthe denser individual regions ultimately stopped expanding. They then began to collapse into irregularly\nshaped blobs (that\u2019s the technical term astronomers use!). In many regions the collapse was more rapid in\none direction, so the concentrations of matter were not spherical but came to resemble giant clumps,\npancakes, and rope-like filaments\u2014each much larger than individual galaxies.\nThese elongated clumps existed throughout the early universe, oriented in different directions and collapsing\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28.5 \u2022 The Formation and Evolution of Galaxies and Structure in the Universe 967\nat different rates. The clumps provided the framework for the large-scale filamentary and bubble-like\nstructures that we see preserved in the universe today.\nThe universe then proceeded to \u201cbuild itself\u201d from the bottom up. Within the clumps, smaller structures\nformed first, then merged to build larger ones, like Lego pieces being put together one by one to create a\ngiant Lego metropolis. The first dense concentrations of matter that collapsed were the size of small dwarf\ngalaxies or globular clusters\u2014which helps explain why globular clusters are the oldest things in the Milky Way\nand most other galaxies. These fragments then gradually assembled to build galaxies, galaxy clusters, and,\nultimately, superclusters of galaxies.\nAccording to this picture, small galaxies and large star clusters first formed in the highest density regions of\nall\u2014the filaments and nodes where the pancakes intersect\u2014when the universe was about two percent of its\ncurrent age. Some stars may have formed even before the first star clusters and galaxies came into existence.\nSome galaxy-galaxy collisions triggered massive bursts of star formation, and some of these led to the\nformation of black holes. In that rich, crowded environment, black holes found constant food and grew in\nmass. The development of massive black holes then triggered quasars and other active galactic nuclei whose\npowerful outflows of energy and matter shut off the star formation in their host galaxies. The early universe\nmust have been an exciting place!\nClusters of galaxies then formed as individual galaxies congregated, drawn together by their mutual\ngravitational attraction (Figure 28.30). First, a few galaxies came together to form groups, much like our own\nLocal Group. Then the groups began combining to form clusters and, eventually, superclusters. This model\npredicts that clusters and superclusters should still be in the process of gathering together, and observations\ndo in fact suggest that clusters are still gathering up their flocks of galaxies and collecting more gas as it flows\nin along filaments. In some instances we even see entire clusters of galaxies merging together.\nFigure28.30Formation of Cluster of Galaxies.This schematic diagram shows how galaxies might have formed if small clouds\nformed first and then congregated to form galaxies and then clusters of galaxies.\nMost giant elliptical galaxies formed through the collision and merger of many smaller fragments. Some spiral\ngalaxies may have formed in relatively isolated regions from a single cloud of gas that collapsed to make a\nflattened disk, but others acquired additional stars, gas, and dark matter through collisions, and the stars\nacquired through these collisions now populate their halos and bulges. As we have seen, our Milky Way is still\ncapturing small galaxies and adding them to its halo, and probably also pulling fresh gas from these galaxies 968 28 \u2022 The Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies\ninto its disk.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 28 \u2022 Key Terms 969\nKey Terms\ncold dark matter slow-moving massive particles, not yet identified, that don\u2019t absorb, emit, or reflect light or\nother electromagnetic radiation\ncosmological principle the assumption that, on the large scale, the universe at any given time is the same\neverywhere\u2014isotropic and homogeneous\ndark energy an energy that is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate; the source of this energy\nis not yet understood\nevolution (of galaxies) changes in individual galaxies over cosmic time, inferred by observing snapshots of\nmany different galaxies at different times in their lives\ngalactic cannibalism a process by which a larger galaxy strips material from or completely swallows a\nsmaller one\nhomogeneous having a consistent and even distribution of matter that is the same everywhere\nhot dark matter massive particles, not yet identified, that don\u2019t absorb, emit, or reflect light or other\nelectromagnetic radiation; hot dark matter is faster-moving material than cold dark matter\nisotropic the same in all directions\nLocal Group a small cluster of galaxies to which our Galaxy belongs\nmerger a collision between galaxies (of roughly comparable size) that combine to form a single new\nstructure\nstarburst a galaxy or merger of multiple galaxies that turns gas into stars much faster than usual\nsupercluster a large region of space (more than 100 million light-years across) where groups and clusters of\ngalaxies are more concentrated; a cluster of clusters of galaxies\nvoid a region between clusters and superclusters of galaxies that appears relatively empty of galaxies\nSummary\n28.1Observations of Distant Galaxies\nWhen we look at distant galaxies, we are looking back in time. We have now seen galaxies as they were when\nthe universe was about 500 million years old\u2014only about four percent as old as it is now. The universe now is\n13.8 billion years old. The color of a galaxy is an indicator of the age of the stars that populate it. Blue galaxies\nmust contain a lot of hot, massive, young stars. Galaxies that contain only old stars tend to be yellowish red.\nThe first generation of stars formed when the universe was only a few hundred million years old. Galaxies\nobserved when the universe was only a few billion years old tend to be smaller than today\u2019s galaxies, to have\nmore irregular shapes, and to have more rapid star formation than the galaxies we see nearby in today\u2019s\nuniverse. This shows that the smaller galaxy fragments assembled themselves into the larger galaxies we see\ntoday.\n28.2Galaxy Mergers and Active Galactic Nuclei\nWhen galaxies of comparable size collide and coalesce we call it a merger, but when a small galaxy is\nswallowed by a much larger one, we use the term galactic cannibalism. Collisions play an important role in the\nevolution of galaxies. If the collision involves at least one galaxy rich in interstellar matter, the resulting\ncompression of the gas will result in a burst of star formation, leading to a starburst galaxy. Mergers were\nmuch more common when the universe was young, and many of the most distant galaxies that we see are\nstarburst galaxies that are involved in collisions. Active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes in\nthe centers of most galaxies can have major effects on the host galaxy, including shutting off star formation.\n28.3The Distribution of Galaxies in Space\nCounts of galaxies in various directions establish that the universe on the large scale is homogeneous and\nisotropic (the same everywhere and the same in all directions, apart from evolutionary changes with time). The\nsameness of the universe everywhere is referred to as the cosmological principle. Galaxies are grouped 970 28 \u2022 For Further Exploration\ntogether in clusters. The Milky Way Galaxy is a member of the Local Group, which contains at least 54 member\ngalaxies. Rich clusters (such as Virgo and Coma) contain thousands or tens of thousands of galaxies. Galaxy\nclusters often group together with other clusters to form large-scale structures called superclusters, which can\nextend over distances of several hundred million light-years. Clusters and superclusters are found in\nfilamentary structures that are huge but fill only a small fraction of space. Most of space consists of large voids\nbetween superclusters, with nearly all galaxies confined to less than 10% of the total volume.\n28.4The Challenge of Dark Matter\nStars move much faster in their orbits around the centers of galaxies, and galaxies around centers of galaxy\nclusters, than they should according to the gravity of all the luminous matter (stars, gas, and dust)\nastronomers can detect. This discrepancy implies that galaxies and galaxy clusters are dominated by dark\nmatter rather than normal luminous matter. Gravitational lensing and X-ray radiation from massive galaxy\nclusters confirm the presence of dark matter. Galaxies and clusters of galaxies contain about 10 times more\ndark matter than luminous matter. While some of the dark matter may be made up of ordinary matter\n(protons, neutrons, and electrons), perhaps in the form of very faint stars or black holes, most of it probably\nconsists of some totally new type of particle not yet detected on Earth. Observations of gravitational lensing\neffects on distant objects have been used to look in the outer region of our Galaxy for any dark matter in the\nform of compact, dim stars or star remnants, but not enough such objects have been found to account for all\nthe dark matter.\n28.5The Formation and Evolution of Galaxies and Structure in the Universe\nInitially, luminous and dark matter in the universe was distributed almost\u2014but not quite\u2014uniformly. The\nchallenge for galaxy formation theories is to show how this \u201cnot quite\u201d smooth distribution of matter\ndeveloped the structures\u2014galaxies and galaxy clusters\u2014that we see today. It is likely that the filamentary\ndistribution of galaxies and voids was built in near the beginning, before stars and galaxies began to form. The\nfirst condensations of matter were about the mass of a large star cluster or a small galaxy. These smaller\nstructures then merged over cosmic time to form large galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and superclusters of\ngalaxies. Superclusters today are still gathering up more galaxies, gas, and dark matter. And spiral galaxies\nlike the Milky Way are still acquiring material by capturing small galaxies near them.\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nAndrews, B. \u201cWhat Are Galaxies Trying to Tell Us?\u201dAstronomy(February 2011): 24.

Your group is selected to advise\nher. What sort of instruments and surveys should she invest in to produce a good map of the cosmos? Be\nas specific as you can.\nE. Download a high-resolution image of a rich galaxy cluster from the Hubble Space Telescope (see the list of\ngravitational lens news stories in the \u201cFor Further Exploration\u201d section). See if your group can work\ntogether to identify gravitational arcs, the images of distant background galaxies distorted by the mass of\nthe cluster. How many can you find? Can you identify any multiple images of the same background\ngalaxy? (If anyone in the group gets really interested, there is a Citizen Science project called Spacewarps,\nwhere you can help astronomers identify gravitational lenses on their images: https://spacewarps.org.)\nF. You get so excited about gravitational lensing that you begin to talk about it with an intelligent friend who\nhas not yet taken an astronomy course. After hearing you out, this friend starts to worry. He says, \u201cIf\ngravitational lenses can distort quasar images, sometimes creating multiple, or ghost, images of the same\nobject, then how can we trust any point of light in the sky to be real? Maybe many of the stars we see are\njust ghost images or lensed images too!\u201d Have your group discuss how to respond. (Hint: Think about the\npath that the light of a quasar took on its way to us and the path the light of a typical star takes.)\nG. The 8.4-meter Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), currently under construction atop Cerro Pach\u00f3n, a\nmountain in northern Chile, will survey the entire sky with its 3.2-gigapixel camera every few days, looking\nfor transient, or temporary, objects that make a brief appearance in the sky before fading from view,\nincluding asteroids and Kuiper belt objects in our solar system, and supernovae and other explosive high-\nenergy events in the distant universe. When it\u2019s fully operating sometime after 2021, the LSST will produce\nup to 30 terabytes of dataevery night.(A terabyte is 1000 gigabytes, which is the unit you probably use to\nrate your computer or memory stick capacity.) With your group, consider what you think might be some\nchallenges of dealing with that quantity of data every night in a scientifically productive but efficient way.\nCan you propose any solutions to those challenges?\nH. Quasars are rare now but were much more numerous when the universe was about one-quarter of its\ncurrent age. The total star formation taking place in galaxies across the universe peaked at about the\nsame redshift. Does your group think this is a coincidence? Why or why not?\nI. One way to see how well the ideas in astronomy (like those in this chapter) have penetrated popular\nculture is to see whether you can find astronomical words in the marketplace. A short web search for the\nterm \u201cdark matter\u201d turns up both a brand of coffee and a brand of \u201cmuscle growth accelerator\u201d with that\nname.

What\u2019s your complete address in the universe? Group members should write out their full address, based\non the information in this chapter (and the rest of the book). After your postal code and country, you may\nwant to add continent, planet, planetary system, galaxy, etc. Then each group member should explain this\naddress to a family member or student not taking astronomy. 974 28 \u2022 Exercises\nExercises\nReview Questions\n1.

Given that only about 5% of the galaxies visible in the Hubble Deep Field are bright enough for\nastronomers to study spectroscopically, they need to make the most of the other 95%. One technique is to\nuse their colors and apparent brightnesses to try to roughly estimate their redshift. How do you think the\ninaccuracy of this redshift estimation technique (compared to actually measuring the redshift from a\nspectrum) might affect our ability to make maps of large-scale structures such as the filaments and voids\nshown inFigure 28.21?\nFiguring for Yourself\n19. Using the information fromExample 28.1, how much fainter an object will you have to be able to measure\nin order to include the same kinds of galaxies in your second survey? Remember that the brightness of an\nobject varies as the inverse square of the distance.\n20. Using the information fromExample 28.1, if galaxies are distributed homogeneously, how many times\nmore of them would you expect to count on your second survey?\n21. Using the information fromExample 28.1, how much longer will it take you to do your second survey?\n22. Galaxies are found in the \u201cwalls\u201d of huge voids; very few galaxies are found in the voids themselves. The\ntext says that the structure of filaments and voids has been present in the universe since shortly after the\nexpansion began 13.8 billion years ago. In science, we always have to check to see whether some\nconclusion is contradicted by any other information we have. In this case, we can ask whether the voids\nwould have filled up with galaxies in roughly 14 billion years. Observations show that in addition to the\nmotion associated with the expansion of the universe, the galaxies in the walls of the voids are moving in\nrandom directions at typical speeds of 300 km/s. At least some of them will be moving into the voids. How\nfar into the void will a galaxy move in 14 billion years? Is it a reasonable hypothesis that the voids have\nexisted for 14 billion years?\n23. Calculate the velocity, the distance, and the look-back time of the most distant galaxies inFigure 28.21\nusing the Hubble constant given in this text and the redshift given in the diagram. Remember the Doppler\nformula for velocity and the Hubble law (v=H\u00d7d, wheredis the distance to a galaxy). For\nthese low velocities, you can neglect relativistic effects.\n24. Assume that dark matter is uniformly distributed throughout the Milky Way, not just in the outer halo but\nalso throughout the bulge and in the disk, where the solar system lives. How much dark matter would you\nexpect there to be inside the solar system? Would you expect that to be easily detectable? Hint: For the\nradius of the Milky Way\u2019s dark matter halo, useR= 300,000 light-years; for the solar system\u2019s radius, use\n100 AU; and start by calculating the ratio of the two volumes.\n25. The simulated box of galaxy filaments and superclusters shown inFigure 28.29stretches across 1 billion\nlight-years. If you were to make a scale model where that box covered the core of a university campus, say\n1 km, then how big would the Milky Way Galaxy be? How far away would the Andromeda galaxy be in the\nscale model?\n26. The first objects to collapse gravitationally after the Big Bang might have been globular cluster-size galaxy\npieces, with masses around 106solar masses. Suppose you merge two of those together, then merge two\nlarger pieces together, and so on, Lego-style, until you reach a Milky Way mass, about 1012solar masses.\nHow many merger generations would that take, and how many original pieces?

But what about the universe as a whole? How old is it? What did it\nlook like in the beginning? How has it changed since then? What will be its fate?\nCosmology is the study of the universe as a whole and is the subject of this chapter. The story of observational\ncosmology really begins in 1929 when EdwinHubblepublished observations of redshifts and distances for a\nsmall sample of galaxies and showed the then-revolutionary result that we live in an expanding universe\u2014one\nwhich in the past was denser, hotter, and smoother. From this early discovery, astronomers developed many\npredictions about the origin and evolution of the universe and then tested those predictions with\nobservations. In this chapter, we will describe what we already know about the history of our dynamic universe\nand highlight some of the mysteries that remain. 978 29 \u2022 The Big Bang\n29.1 The Age of the Universe\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe how we estimate the age of the universe\nExplain how changes in the rate of expansion over time affect estimates of the age of the universe\nDescribe the evidence that dark energy exists and that the rate of expansion is currently accelerating\nDescribe some independent evidence for the age of the universe that is consistent with the age estimate\nbased on the rate of expansion\nTo explore the history of the universe, we will follow the same path that astronomers followed\nhistorically\u2014beginning with studies of the nearby universe and then probing ever-more-distant objects and\nlooking further back in time.\nThe realization that the universe changes with time came in the 1920s and 1930s when measurements of the\nredshifts of a large sample of galaxies became available. With hindsight, it is surprising that scientists were so\nshocked to discover that the universe is expanding. In fact, our theories of gravity demand that the universe\nmust be either expanding or contracting. To show what we mean, let\u2019s begin with a universe of finite size\u2014say\na giant ball of a thousand galaxies. All these galaxies attract each other because of their gravity. If they were\ninitially stationary, they would inevitably begin to move closer together and eventually collide. They could\navoid this collapse only if for some reason they happened to be moving away from each other at high speeds.\nIn just the same way, only if a rocket is launched at high enough speed can it avoid falling back to Earth.\nThe problem of what happens in an infinite universe is harder to solve, butEinstein(and others) used his\ntheory of general relativity(which we described inBlack Holes and Curved Spacetime) to show that even\ninfinite universes cannot be static. Since astronomers at that time did not yet know the universe was\nexpanding (and Einstein himself was philosophically unwilling to accept a universe in motion), he changed his\nequations by introducing an arbitrary new term (we might call it a fudge factor) called thecosmological\nconstant. This constant represented a hypothetical force of repulsion that could balance gravitational\nattraction on the largest scales and permit galaxies to remain at fixed distances from one another. That way,\nthe universe could remain still.\nFigure29.2Einstein and Hubble.(a) Albert Einstein is shown in a 1921 photograph. (b) Edwin Hubble at work in the Mt. Wilson\nObservatory.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.1 \u2022 The Age of the Universe 979\nAbout a decade later, Hubble, and his coworkers reported that the universe is expanding, so that no\nmysterious balancing force is needed. (We discussed this in the chapter onGalaxies.) Einstein is reported to\nhave said that the introduction of the cosmological constant was \u201cthe biggest blunder of my life.\u201d As we shall\nsee later in this chapter, however, relatively recent observations indicate that the expansion isaccelerating.\nObservations are now being carried out to determine whether this acceleration is consistent with a\ncosmological constant. In a way, it may turn out that Einstein was right after all.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView thisweb exhibit(https://openstax.org/l/30exhcosmAIPCHP)on the history of our thinking about\ncosmology, with images and biographies, from the American Institute of Physics Center for the History of\nPhysics.\nThe Hubble Time\nIf we had a movie of the expanding universe and ran the filmbackward, what would we see? The galaxies,\ninstead of moving apart, would movetogetherin our movie\u2014getting closer and closer all the time. Eventually,\nwe would find that all the matter we can see today was once concentrated in an infinitesimally small volume.\nAstronomers identify this time with thebeginning of the universe. The explosion of that concentrated universe\nat the beginning of time is called theBig Bang(not a bad term, since you can\u2019t have a bigger bang than one\nthat creates the entire universe). But when did this bang occur?\nWe can make a reasonable estimate of the time since the universal expansion began. To see how astronomers\ndo this, let\u2019s begin with an analogy. Suppose your astronomy class decides to have a party (a kind of \u201cBig\nBang\u201d) at someone\u2019s home to celebrate the end of the semester. Unfortunately, everyone is celebrating with\nso much enthusiasm that the neighbors call the police, who arrive and send everyone away at the same\nmoment. You get home at 2 a.m., still somewhat upset about the way the party ended, and realize you forgot\nto look at your watch to see what time the police got there. But you use a map to measure that the distance\nbetween the party and your house is 40 kilometers. And you also remember that you drove the whole trip at a\nsteady speed of 80 kilometers/hour (since you were worried about the police cars following you). Therefore,\nthe trip must have taken:\nSo the party must have broken up at 1:30 a.m.\nNo humans were around to look at their watches when the universe began, but we can use the same\ntechnique to estimate when the galaxies began moving away from each other. (Remember that, in reality, it is\nspace that is expanding, not the galaxies that are moving through static space.) If we can measure how far\napart the galaxies are now, and how fast they are moving, we can figure out how long a trip it\u2019s been.\nLet\u2019s call the age of the universe measured in this wayT. Let\u2019s first do a simple case by assuming that the\n0\nexpansion has been at a constant rate ever since the expansion of the universe began. In this case, the time it\nhas taken a galaxy to move a distance,d, away from the Milky Way (remember that at the beginning the\ngalaxies were all together in a very tiny volume) is (as in our example)\nwherevis the velocity of the galaxy. If we can measure the speed with which galaxies are moving away, and\nalso the distances between them, we can establish how long ago the expansion began.\nMaking such measurements should sound very familiar. This is just what Hubble and many astronomers after 980 29 \u2022 The Big Bang\nhim needed to do in order to establish theHubble lawand theHubble constant. We learned inGalaxiesthat a\ngalaxy\u2019s distance and its velocity in the expanding universe are related by\nwhereHis the Hubble constant. Combining these two expressions gives us\nWe see, then, that the work of calculating this time was already done for us when astronomers measured the\nHubble constant. The age of the universe estimated in this way turns out to be just thereciprocal of the\nHubble constant(that is, 1/H). This age estimate is sometimes called theHubble time. For a Hubble constant\nof 20 kilometers/second per million light-years, the Hubble time is about 15 billion years. (By the way, the unit\nused by astronomers for the Hubble constant is kilometers/second per million parsecs. In these units, the\nHubble constant is equal to about 70 kilometers/second per million parsecs, again with an uncertainty of\nabout 5%.)\nTo make numbers easier to remember, we have done some rounding here. Estimates for the Hubble constant\nare actually closer to 21 or 22 kilometers/second per million light-years, which would make the age closer to 14\nbillion years. But there is still about a 5% uncertainty in the Hubble constant, which means the age of the\nuniverse estimated in this way is also uncertain by about 5%.\nTo put these uncertainties in perspective, however, you should know that 50 years ago, the uncertainty was a\nfactor of 2. Remarkable progress toward pinning down the Hubble constant has been made in the last couple\nof decades.\nThe Role of Deceleration\nThe Hubble time is the right age for the universe only if the expansion rate has been constant throughout the\ntime since the expansion of the universe began. Continuing with our end-of-the-semester-party analogy, this\nis equivalent to assuming that you traveled home from the party at a constant rate, when in fact this may not\nhave been the case. At first, mad about having to leave, you may have driven fast, but then as you calmed\ndown\u2014and thought about police cars on the highway\u2014you may have begun to slow down until you were\ndriving at a more socially acceptable speed (such as 80 kilometers/hour). In this case, given that you were\ndriving faster at the beginning, the trip home would have taken less than a half-hour.\nIn the same way, in calculating the Hubble time, we have assumed that the expansion rate has been constant\nthroughout all of time. It turns out that this is not a good assumption. Earlier in their thinking about this,\nastronomers expected that the rate of expansion should be slowing down. We know that matter creates\ngravity, whereby all objects pull on all other objects. The mutual attraction between galaxies was expected to\nslow the expansion as time passed. This means that, if gravity were the only force acting (a bigif, as we shall\nsee in the next section), then the rate of expansion must have been faster in the past than it is today. In this\ncase, we would say the universe has beendeceleratingsince the beginning.\nHow much it has decelerated depends on the importance of gravity in slowing the expansion. If the universe\nwere nearly empty, the role of gravity would be minor. Then the deceleration would be close to zero, and the\nuniverse would have been expanding at a constant rate. But in a universe with any significant density of\nmatter, the pull of gravity means that the rate of expansion should be slower now than it used to be. If we use\nthe current rate of expansion to estimate how long it took the galaxies to reach their current separations, we\nwill overestimate the age of the universe\u2014just as we may have overestimated the time it took for you to get\nhome from the party.\nA Universal Acceleration\nAstronomers spent several decades looking for evidence that the expansion was decelerating, but they were\nnot successful. What they needed were 1) larger telescopes so that they could measure the redshifts of more\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.1 \u2022 The Age of the Universe 981\ndistant galaxies and 2) a very luminousstandard bulb(or standard candle), that is, some astronomical object\nwith known luminosity that produces an enormous amount of energy and can be observed at distances of a\nbillion light-years or more.\nRecall that we discussedstandard bulbs in the chapter onGalaxies. If we compare how luminous a standard\nbulb is supposed to be and how dim it actually looks in our telescopes, the difference allows us to calculate its\ndistance. The redshift of the galaxy such a bulb is in can tell us how fast it is moving in the universe. So we can\nmeasure its distance and motion independently.\nThese two requirements were finally met in the 1990s. Astronomers showed that supernovae of type Ia (see\nThe Death of Stars), with some corrections based on the shapes of their light curves, are standard bulbs. This\ntype of supernova occurs when a white dwarf accretes enough material from a companion star to exceed the\nChandrasekhar limit and then collapses and explodes. At the time of maximum brightness, these dramatic\nsupernovae can briefly outshine the galaxies that host them, and hence, they can be observed at very large\ndistances. Large 8- to 10-meter telescopes can be used to obtain the spectra needed to measure the redshifts\nof the host galaxies (Figure 29.3).\nFigure29.3Five Supernovae and Their Host Galaxies.The top row shows each galaxy and its supernova (arrow). The bottom row\nshows the same galaxies either before or after the supernovae exploded. (credit: modification of work by NASA, ESA, and A. Riess\n(STScI))\nThe result of painstaking, careful study of these supernovae in a range of galaxies, carried out by two groups\nof researchers, was published in 1998. It was shocking\u2014and so revolutionary that their discovery received the\n2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. What the researchers found was that these type Ia supernovae in distant galaxies\nwere fainter than expected from Hubble\u2019s law, given the measured redshifts of their host galaxies. In other\nwords, distances estimated from the supernovae used as standard bulbs disagreed with the distances\nmeasured from the redshifts.\nIf the universe were decelerating, we would expect the far-away supernovae to bebrighterthan expected. The\nslowing down would have kept them closer to us. Instead, they werefainter, which at first seemed to make no\nsense.\nBefore accepting this shocking development, astronomers first explored the possibility that the supernovae\nmight not really be as useful as standard bulbs as they thought. Perhaps the supernovae appeared too faint\nbecause dust along our line of sight to them absorbed some of their light. Or perhaps the supernovae at large\ndistances were for some reason intrinsically less luminous than nearby supernovae of type Ia.\nA host of more detailed observations ruled out these possibilities. Scientists then had to consider the\nalternative that the distance estimated from the redshift was incorrect. Distances derived from redshifts 982 29 \u2022 The Big Bang\nassume that the Hubble constant has been truly constant for all time. We saw that one way it might not be\nconstant is that the expansion is slowing down. But suppose neither assumption is right (steady speed or\nslowing down.)\nSuppose, instead, that the universe isaccelerating. If the universe is expanding faster now than it was billions\nof years ago, our motion away from the distant supernovae has sped up since the explosion occurred,\nsweeping us farther away from them. The light of the explosion has to travel a greater distance to reach us\nthan if the expansion rate were constant. The farther the light travels, the fainter it appears. This conclusion\nwould explain the supernova observations in a natural way, and this has now been substantiated by many\nadditional observations over the last couple of decades. It really seems thatthe expansion of the universe is\naccelerating, a notion so unexpected that astronomers at first resisted considering it.\nHow can the expansion of the universe be speeding up? If you want to accelerate your car, you must supply\nenergy by stepping on the gas. Similarly, energy must be supplied to accelerate the expansion of the universe.\nThe discovery of the acceleration was shocking because scientists still have no idea what the source of the\nenergy is. Scientists call whatever it isdark energy, which is a clear sign of how little we understand it.\nNote that this new component of the universe is not the dark matter we talked about in earlier chapters. Dark\nenergy is something else that we have also not yet detected in our laboratories on Earth.\nWhat is dark energy? One possibility is that it is the cosmological constant, which is an energy associated with\nthe vacuum of \u201cempty\u201d space itself. Quantum mechanics (the intriguing theory of how things behave at the\natomic and subatomic levels) tells us that the source of this vacuum energy might be tiny elementary particles\nthat flicker in and out of existence everywhere throughout the universe. Various attempts have been made to\ncalculate how big the effects of this vacuum energy should be, but so far these attempts have been\nunsuccessful. In fact, the order of magnitude of theoretical estimates of the vacuum energy based on the\nquantum mechanicsof matter and the value required to account for the acceleration of the expansion of the\nuniverse differ by an incredible factor of at least 10120(that is a 1 followed by 120 zeros)! Various other theories\nhave been suggested, but the bottom line is that, although there is compelling evidence that dark energy\nexists, we do not yet know the source of that energy.\nWhatever the dark energy turns out to be, we should note that the discovery that the rate of expansion has\nnot been constant since the beginning of the universe complicates the calculation of the age of the universe.\nInterestingly, the acceleration seems not to have started with the Big Bang. During the first several billion\nyears after the Big Bang, when galaxies were close together, gravity was strong enough to slow the expansion.\nAs galaxies moved farther apart, the effect of gravity weakened. Several billion years after the Big Bang, dark\nenergy took over, and the expansion began to accelerate (Figure 29.4).\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.1 \u2022 The Age of the Universe 983\nFigure29.4Changes in the Rate of Expansion of the Universe Since Its Beginning 13.8 Billion Years Ago.The more the diagram\nspreads out horizontally, the faster the change in the velocity of expansion. After a period of very rapid expansion at the beginning,\nwhich scientists call inflation and which we will discuss later in this chapter, the expansion began to decelerate. Galaxies were then\nclose together, and their mutual gravitational attraction slowed the expansion. After a few billion years, when galaxies were farther\napart, the influence of gravity began to weaken. Dark energy then took over and caused the expansion to accelerate. (credit:\nmodification of work by Ann Feild (STScI))\nDeceleration works to make the age of the universe estimated by the simple relationT = 1/Hseem older than\n0\nit really is, whereas acceleration works to make it seem younger. By happy coincidence, our best estimates of\nhow much deceleration and acceleration occurred lead to an answer for the age very close toT = 1/H. The\n0\nbest current estimate is that the universe is 13.8 billion years old with an uncertainty of only about 100 million\nyears.\nThroughout this chapter, we have referred to the Hubbleconstant. We now know that the Hubble constant\ndoes change with time. It is, however, constant everywhere in the universe at any given time. When we say the\nHubble constant is about 70 kilometers/second/million parsecs, we mean that this is the value of the Hubble\nconstant at the current time.\nComparing Ages\nWe now have one estimate for the age of the universe from its expansion. Is this estimate consistent with\nother observations? For example, are the oldest stars or other astronomical objects younger than 13.8 billion\nyears? After all, the universe has to be at least as old as the oldest objects in it.\nIn our Galaxy and others, the oldest stars are found in the globular clusters (Figure 29.5), which can be dated\nusing the models of stellar evolution described in the chapterStars from Adolescence to Old Age. 984 29 \u2022 The Big Bang\nFigure29.5Globular Cluster 47 Tucanae.This NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image shows a globular cluster known as 47\nTucanae, since it is in the constellation of Tucana (The Toucan) in the southern sky. The second-brightest globular cluster in the night\nsky, it includes hundreds of thousands of stars. Globular clusters are among the oldest objects in our Galaxy and can be used to\nestimate its age. (credit: NASA, ESA, and the Hubble Heritage (STScI/AURA)-ESA/Hubble Collaboration)\nThe accuracy of the age estimates of theglobular clustershas improved markedly in recent years for two\nreasons. First, models of interiors of globular cluster stars have been improved, mainly through better\ninformation about how atoms absorb radiation as they make their way from the center of a star out into\nspace. Second, observations from satellites have improved the accuracy of our measurements of the distances\nto these clusters. The conclusion is that the oldest stars formed about 12\u201313 billion years ago.\nThis age estimate has recently been confirmed by the study of the spectrum of uranium in the stars. The\nisotope uranium-238 is radioactive and decays (changes into another element) over time. (Uranium-238 gets\nits designation because it has 92 protons and 146 neutrons.) We know (from how stars and supernovae make\nelements) how much uranium-238 is generally made compared to other elements. Suppose we measure the\namount of uranium relative to nonradioactive elements in a very old star and in our own Sun, and compare the\nabundances. With those pieces of information, we can estimate how much longer the uranium has been\ndecaying in the very old star because we know from our own Sun how much uranium decays in 4.5 billion\nyears.\nThe line of uranium is very weak and hard to make out even in the Sun, but it has now been measured in one\nextremely old star using the European Very Large Telescope (Figure 29.6). Comparing the abundance with that\nin the solar system, whose age we know, astronomers estimate the star is 12.5 billion years old, with an\nuncertainty of about 3 billion years. While the uncertainty is large, this work is important confirmation of the\nages estimated by studies of the globular cluster stars. Note that the uranium age estimate is completely\nindependent; it does not depend on either the measurement of distances or on models of the interiors of\nstars.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.2 \u2022 A Model of the Universe 985\nFigure29.6European Extremely Large Telescope, European Very Large Telescope, and the Colosseum.The European Extremely\nLarge Telescope (E-ELT) is currently under construction in Chile. This image compares the size of the E-ELT (left) with the four\n8-meter telescopes of the European Very Large Telescope (center) and with the Colosseum in Rome (right). The mirror of the E-ELT\nwill be 39 meters in diameter. Astronomers are building a new generation of giant telescopes in order to observe very distant\ngalaxies and understand what they were like when they were newly formed and the universe was young. (credit: modification of\nwork by ESO)\nAs we shall see later in this chapter, the globular cluster stars probably did not form until the expansion of the\nuniverse had been underway for at least a few hundred million years. Accordingly, their ages are consistent\nwith the 13.8 billion-year age estimated from the expansion rate.\n29.2 A Model of the Universe\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain how the rate of expansion of the universe affects its evolution\nDescribe four possibilities for the evolution of the universe\nExplain what is expanding when we say that the universe is expanding\nDefine critical density and the evidence that matter alone in the universe is much smaller than the critical\ndensity\nDescribe what the observations say about the likely long-term future of the universe\nLet\u2019s now use the results about the expansion of the universe to look at how these ideas might be applied to\ndevelop a model for the evolution of the universe as a whole. With this model, astronomers can make\npredictions about how the universe has evolved so far and what will happen to it in the future.\nThe Expanding Universe\nEvery model of the universe must include the expansion we observe. Another key element of the models is\nthat thecosmological principle(which we discussed inThe Evolution and Distribution of Galaxies) is valid: on\nthe large scale, the universe at any given time is the same everywhere (homogeneous and isotropic). As a\nresult, the expansion rate must be the same everywhere during any epoch of cosmic time. If so, we don\u2019t need\nto think about the entire universe when we think about the expansion, we can just look at any sufficiently large\nportion of it. (Some models for dark energy would allow the expansion rate to be different in different\ndirections, and scientists are designing experiments to test this idea. However, until such evidence is found, we\nwill assume that the cosmological principle applies throughout the universe.)\nInGalaxies, we hinted that when we think of the expansion of the universe, it is more correct to think of space\nitself stretching rather than of galaxies moving through static space. Nevertheless, we have since been\ndiscussing the redshifts of galaxies as if they resulted from the motion of the galaxies themselves. 986 29 \u2022 The Big Bang\nNow, however, it is time to finally put such simplistic notions behind us and take a more sophisticated look at\nthe cosmic expansion. Recall from our discussion of Einstein\u2019stheory of general relativity(in the chapter on\nBlack Holes and Curved Spacetime) that space\u2014or, more precisely, spacetime\u2014is not a mere backdrop to the\naction of the universe, as Newton thought. Rather, it is an active participant\u2014affected by and in turn affecting\nthe matter and energy in the universe.\nSince the expansion of the universe is the stretching of all spacetime, all points in the universe are stretching\ntogether. Thus, the expansion beganeverywhere at once. Unfortunately for tourist agencies of the future,\nthere is no location you can visit where the stretching of space began or where we can say that the Big Bang\nhappened.\nTo describe just how space stretches, we say the cosmic expansion causes the universe to undergo a uniform\nchange inscaleover time. By scale we mean, for example, the distance between two clusters of galaxies. It is\ncustomary to represent the scale by the factorR; ifRdoubles, then the distance between the clusters has\ndoubled. Since the universe is expanding at the same rate everywhere, the change inRtells us how much it\nhas expanded (or contracted) at any given time. For a static universe,Rwould be constant as time passes. In\nan expanding universe,Rincreases with time.\nIf it is space that is stretching rather than galaxies moving through space, then why do the galaxies show\nredshifts in their spectra? When you were young and na\u00efve\u2014a few chapters ago\u2014it was fine to discuss the\nredshifts of distant galaxies as if they resulted from their motion away from us. But now that you are an older\nand wiser student of cosmology, this view will simply not do.\nA more accurate view of the redshifts of galaxies is that the light waves are stretched by the stretching of the\nspace they travel through. Think about the light from a remote galaxy. As it moves away from its source, the\nlight has to travel through space. If space is stretching during all the time the light is traveling, the light waves\nwill be stretched as well. A redshift is a stretching of waves\u2014the wavelength of each wave increases (Figure\n29.7). Light from more distant galaxies travels for more time than light from closer ones. This means that the\nlight has stretched more than light from closer ones and thus shows a greater redshift.\nFigure29.7Expansion and Redshift.As an elastic surface expands, a wave on its surface stretches. For light waves, the increase in\nwavelength would be seen as a redshift.\nThus, what the measured redshift of light from an object is telling us is how much the universe has expanded\nsince the light left the object. If the universe has expanded by a factor of 2, then the wavelength of the light\n(and all electromagnetic waves from the same source) will have doubled.\nModels of the Expansion\nBefore astronomers knew about dark energy or had a good measurement of how much matter exists in the\nuniverse, they made speculative models about how the universe might evolve over time. The four possible\nscenarios are shown inFigure 29.8. In this diagram, time moves forward from the bottom upward, and the\nscale of space increases by the horizontal circles becoming wider.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.2 \u2022 A Model of the Universe 987\nFigure29.8Four Possible Models of the Universe.The yellow square marks the present in all four cases, and for all four, the\nHubble constant is equal to the same value at the present time. Time is measured in the vertical direction. The first two universes on\nthe left are ones in which the rate of expansion slows over time. The one on the left will eventually slow, come to a stop and reverse,\nending up in a \u201cbig crunch,\u201d while the one next to it will continue to expand forever, but ever-more slowly as time passes. The\n\u201ccoasting\u201d universe is one that expands at a constant rate given by the Hubble constant throughout all of cosmic time. The\naccelerating universe on the right will continue to expand faster and faster forever. (credit: modification of work by NASA/ESA)\nThe simplest scenario of an expanding universe would be one in whichRincreases with time at a constant\nrate. But you already know that life is not so simple. The universe contains a great deal of mass and its gravity\ndecelerates the expansion\u2014by a large amount if the universe contains a lot of matter, or by a negligible\namount if the universe is nearly empty. Then there is the observed acceleration, which astronomers blame on\na kind of dark energy.\nLet\u2019s first explore the range of possibilities with models for different amounts of mass in the universe and for\ndifferent contributions by dark energy. In some models\u2014as we shall see\u2014the universe expands forever. In\nothers, it stops expanding and starts to contract. After looking at the extreme possibilities, we will look at\nrecent observations that allow us to choose the most likely scenario.\nWe should perhaps pause for a minute to note how remarkable it is that we can do this at all. Our\nunderstanding of the principles that underlie how the universe works on the large scale and our observations\nof how the objects in the universe change with time allow us to model the evolution of the entire cosmos these\ndays. It is one of the loftiest achievements of the human mind.\nWhat astronomers look at in practice, to determine the kind of universe we live in, is theaverage densityof the\n1\nuniverse. This is the mass of matter (including the equivalent mass of energy) that would be contained in\neach unit of volume (say, 1 cubic centimeter) if all the stars, galaxies, and other objects were taken apart, atom\nby atom, and if all those particles, along with the light and other energy, were distributed throughout all of\nspace with absolute uniformity. If the average density is low, there is less mass and less gravity, and the\nuniverse will not decelerate very much. It can therefore expand forever. Higher average density, on the other\nhand, means there is more mass and more gravity and that the stretching of space might slow down enough\nthat the expansion will eventually stop. An extremely high density might even cause the universe to collapse\nagain.\nFor a given rate of expansion, there is acritical density\u2014the mass per unit volume that will be just enough to\nslow the expansion to zero at some time infinitely far in the future. If the actual density is higher than this\ncritical density, then the expansion will ultimately reverse and the universe will begin to contract. If the actual\ndensity is lower, then the universe will expand forever.\nThese various possibilities are illustrated inFigure 29.9. In this graph, one of the most comprehensive in all of\n1 By equivalent mass we mean that which would result if the energy were turned into mass using Einstein\u2019s formula,E=mc2. 988 29 \u2022 The Big Bang\nscience, we chart the development of the scale of space in the cosmos against the passage of time. Time\nincreases to the right, and the scale of the universe,R, increases upward in the figure. Today, at the point\nmarked \u201cpresent\u201d along the time axis,Ris increasing in each model. We know that the galaxies are currently\nexpanding away from each other, no matter which model is right. (The same situation holds for a baseball\nthrown high into the air. While it may eventually fall back down, near the beginning of the throw it moves\nupward most rapidly.)\nThe various lines moving across the graph correspond to different models of the universe. The straight dashed\nline corresponds to the empty universe with no deceleration; it intercepts the time axis at a time,T (the\n0\nHubble time), in the past. This is not a realistic model but gives us a measure to compare other models to. The\ncurves below the dashed line represent models with no dark energy and with varying amounts of deceleration,\nstarting from the Big Bang at shorter times in the past. The curve above the dashed line shows what happens\nif the expansion is accelerating. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the future according to the different models.\nFigure29.9Models of the Universe.This graph plotsR, the scale of the universe, against time for various cosmological models.\nCurve 1 represents a universe where the density is greater than the critical value; this model predicts that the universe will eventually\ncollapse. Curve 2 represents a universe with a density lower than critical; the universe will continue to expand but at an ever-slower\nrate. Curve 3 is a critical-density universe; in this universe, the expansion will gradually slow to a stop infinitely far in the future.\nCurve 4 represents a universe that is accelerating because of the effects of dark energy. The dashed line is for an empty universe,\none in which the expansion is not slowed by gravity or accelerated by dark energy. Time is very compressed on this graph.\nLet\u2019s start with curve 1 inFigure 29.9. In this case, the actual density of the universe is higher than the critical\ndensity and there is no dark energy. This universe will stop expanding at some time in the future and begin\ncontracting. This model is called aclosed universeand corresponds to the universe on the left inFigure 29.8.\nEventually, the scale drops to zero, which means that space will have shrunk to an infinitely small size. The\nnoted physicist JohnWheelercalled this the \u201cbig crunch,\u201d because matter, energy, space, and time would all\nbe crushed out of existence. Note that the \u201cbig crunch\u201d is the opposite of the Big Bang\u2014it is animplosion. The\nuniverse is not expanding but rather collapsing in upon itself.\nSome scientists speculated that another Big Bang might follow the crunch, giving rise to a new expansion\nphase, and then another contraction\u2014perhaps oscillating between successive Big Bangs and big crunches\nindefinitely in the past and future. Such speculation was sometimes referred to as theoscillating theory of the\nuniverse. The challenge for theorists was how to describe the transition from collapse (when space and time\nthemselves disappear into the big crunch) to expansion. With the discovery of dark energy, however, it does\nnot appear that the universe will experience a big crunch, so we can put worrying about it on the back burner.\nIf the density of the universe is less than the critical density (curve 2 inFigure 29.9and the universe second\nfrom the left inFigure 29.8), gravity is never important enough to stop the expansion, and so the universe\nexpands forever. Such a universe is infinite and this model is called anopen universe. Time and space begin\nwith the Big Bang, but they have no end; the universe simply continues expanding, always a bit more slowly as\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.2 \u2022 A Model of the Universe 989\ntime goes on. Groups of galaxies eventually get so far apart that it would be difficult for observers in any of\nthem to see the others. (See the feature box onWhat Might the Universe Be Like in the Distant Future?for\nmore about the distant future in the closed and open universe models.)\nAt the critical density (curve 3), the universe can just barely expand forever. The critical-density universe has an\nage of exactly two-thirdsT, whereT is the age of the empty universe. Universes that will someday begin to\n0 0\ncontract have ages less than two-thirdsT.\n0\nIn an empty universe (the dashed lineFigure 29.9and the coasting universe inFigure 29.8), neither gravity nor\ndark energy is important enough to affect the expansion rate, which is therefore constant throughout all time.\nIn a universe with dark energy, the rate of the expansion will increase with time, and the expansion will\ncontinue at an ever-faster rate. Curve 4 inFigure 29.9, which represents this universe, has a complicated\nshape. In the beginning, when the matter is all very close together, the rate of expansion is most influenced by\ngravity. Dark energy appears to act only over large scales and thus becomes more important as the universe\ngrows larger and the matter begins to thin out. In this model, at first the universe slows down, but as space\nstretches, the acceleration plays a greater role and the expansion speeds up.\nThe Cosmic Tug of War\nWe might summarize our discussion so far by saying that a \u201ctug of war\u201d is going on in the universe between\nthe forces that push everything apart and the gravitational attraction of matter, which pulls everything\ntogether. If we can determine who will win this tug of war, we will learn the ultimate fate of the universe.\nThe first thing we need to know is the density of the universe. Is it greater than, less than, or equal to the\ncritical density? The critical density today depends on the value of the expansion rate today,H. If theHubble\n0\nconstantis around 20 kilometers/second per million light-years, the critical density is about 10\u201326kg/m3. Let\u2019s\nsee how this value compares with the actual density of the universe.\nEXAMPLE 29.1\nCritical Density of the Universe\nAs we discussed, the critical density is that combination of matter and energy that brings the universe\ncoasting to a stop at time infinity. Einstein\u2019s equations lead to the following expression for the critical\ndensity (\u03c1 ):\ncrit\nwhereHis the Hubble constant andGis the universal constant of gravity (6.67 \u00d7 10\u201311Nm2/kg2).\nSolution\nLet\u2019s substitute our values and see what we get. Take anH= 22 km/s per million light-years. We need to\nconvert both km and light-years into meters for consistency. A million light-years = 106\u00d7 9.5 \u00d7 1015m = 9.5 \u00d7\n1021m. And 22 km/s = 2.2 \u00d7 104m/s. That makesH= 2.3 \u00d710\u201318/s andH2= 5.36 \u00d7 10\u201336/s2. So,\nwhich we can round off to the 10\u201326kg/m3. (To make the units work out, you have to know thatN, the unit\nof force, is the same as kg \u00d7 m/s2.)\nNow we can compare densities we measure in the universe to this critical value. Note that density is mass\nper unit volume, but energy has an equivalent mass ofm=E/c2(from Einstein\u2019s equationE=mc2). 990 29 \u2022 The Big Bang\nCheck Your Learning\na. A single grain of dust has a mass of about 1.1 \u00d7 10\u201313kg. If the average mass-energy density of space is\nequal to the critical density on average, how much space would be required to produce a total mass-\nenergy equal to a dust grain?\nb. If the Hubble constant were twice what it actually is, how much would the critical density be?\nAnswer:\na. In this case, the average mass-energy in a volumeVof space isE=\u03c1 V. Thus, for space with critical\ncrit\ndensity, we require that\nThus, the sides of a cube of space with mass-energy density averaging that of the critical density would\nneed to be slightly greater than 10 km to contain the total energy equal to a single grain of dust!\nb. Since the critical density goes as the square of the Hubble constant, by doubling the Hubble parameter,\nthe critical density would increase by a factor a four. So if the Hubble constant was 44 km/s per million\nlight-years instead of 22 km/s per million light-years, the critical density would be\nWe can start our survey of how dense the cosmos is by ignoring the dark energy and just estimating the\ndensity of all matter in the universe, including ordinary matter and dark matter. Here is where the\ncosmological principlereally comes in handy. Since the universe is the same all over (at least on large scales),\nwe only need to measure how much matter exists in a (large) representative sample of it. This is similar to the\nway a representative survey of a few thousand people can tell us whom the millions of residents of the US\nprefer for president.\nThere are several methods by which we can try to determine the average density of matter in space. One way\nis to count all the galaxies out to a given distance and use estimates of their masses, including dark matter, to\ncalculate the average density. Such estimates indicate a density of about 1 to 2 \u00d7 10\u201327kg/m3(10 to 20% of\ncritical), which by itself is too small to stop the expansion.\nA lot of the dark matter lies outside the boundaries of galaxies, so this inventory is not yet complete. But even\nif we add an estimate of the dark matter outside galaxies, our total won\u2019t rise beyond about 30% of the critical\ndensity. We\u2019ll pin these numbers down more precisely later in this chapter, where we will also include the\neffects of dark energy.\nIn any case, even if we ignore dark energy, the evidence is that the universe will continue to expand forever.\nThe discovery of dark energy that is causing the rate of expansion to speed up only strengthens this\nconclusion. Things definitely do not look good for fans of the closed universe (big crunch) model.\nMAKING CONNECTIONS\nWhat Might the Universe Be Like in the Distant Future?\nSome say the world will end in fire,\nSome say in ice.\nFrom what I\u2019ve tasted of desire\nI hold with those who favor fire.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.2 \u2022 A Model of the Universe 991\n\u2014From the poem \u201cFire and Ice\u201d by Robert Frost (1923)\nGiven the destructive power of impacting asteroids, expanding red giants, and nearby supernovae, our\nspecies may not be around in the remote future. Nevertheless, you might enjoy speculating about what it\nwould be like to live in a much, much older universe.\nThe observed acceleration makes it likely that we will have continued expansion into the indefinite future. If\nthe universe expands forever (Rincreases without limit), the clusters of galaxies will spread ever farther\napart with time. As eons pass, the universe will get thinner, colder, and darker.\nWithin each galaxy, stars will continue to go through their lives, eventually becoming white dwarfs, neutron\nstars, and black holes. Low-mass stars might take a long time to finish their evolution, but in this model, we\nwould literally have all the time in the world. Ultimately, even the white dwarfs will cool down to be black\ndwarfs, any neutron stars that reveal themselves as pulsars will slowly stop spinning, and black holes with\naccretion disks will one day complete their \u201cmeals.\u201d The remains of stars will all be dark and difficult to\nobserve.\nThis means that the light that now reveals galaxies to us will eventually go out. Even if a small pocket of raw\nmaterial were left in one unsung corner of a galaxy, ready to be turned into a fresh cluster of stars, we will\nonly have to wait until the time that their evolution is also complete. And time is one thing this model of the\nuniverse has plenty of. There will surely come a time when all the stars are out, galaxies are as dark as\nspace, and no source of heat remains to help living things survive. Then the lifeless galaxies will just\ncontinue to move apart in their lightless realm.\nIf this view of the future seems discouraging (from a human perspective), keep in mind that we\nfundamentally do not understand why the expansion rate is currently accelerating. Thus, our speculations\nabout the future are just that: speculations. You might take heart in the knowledge that science is always a\nprogress report. The most advanced ideas about the universe from a hundred years ago now strike us as\nrather primitive. It may well be that our best models of today will in a hundred or a thousand years also\nseem rather simplistic and that there are other factors determining the ultimate fate of the universe of\nwhich we are still completely unaware.\nAges of Distant Galaxies\nIn the chapter onGalaxies, we discussed how we can useHubble\u2019s lawto measure the distance to a galaxy.\nBut that simple method only works with galaxies that are not too far away. Once we get to large distances, we\nare looking so far into the past that we must take into account changes in the rate of the expansion of the\nuniverse. Since we cannot measure these changes directly, we must assume one of the models of the universe\nto be able to convert large redshifts into distances.\nThis is why astronomers squirm when reporters and students ask them exactly how far away some newly\ndiscovered distant quasar or galaxy is. We really can\u2019t give an answer without first explaining the model of the\nuniverse we are assuming in calculating it (by which time a reporter or student is long gone or asleep).\nSpecifically, we must use a model that includes the change in the expansion rate with time. The key\ningredients of the model are the amounts of matter, including dark matter, and the equivalent mass\n(according toE=mc2) of the dark energy along with the Hubble constant.\nElsewhere in this book, we have estimated the mass density of ordinary matter plus dark matter as roughly 0.3\ntimes the critical density, and the mass equivalent of dark energy as roughly 0.7 times the critical density. We\nwill refer to these values as the \u201cstandard model of the universe.\u201d The latest (slightly improved) estimates for\nthese values and the evidence for them will be given later in this chapter. Calculations also require the current\nvalue of the Hubble constant. ForTable 29.1, we have adopted a Hubble constant of 67.3 kilometers/second/\nmillion parsecs (rather than rounding it to 70 kilometers/second/million parsecs), which is consistent with the 992 29 \u2022 The Big Bang\n13.8 billion-year age of the universe estimated by the latest observations.\nOnce we assume a model, we can use it to calculate the age of the universe at the time an object emitted the\nlight we see. As an example,Table 29.1lists the times that light was emitted by objects at different redshifts as\nfractions of the current age of the universe. The times are given for two very different models so you can get a\nfeeling for the fact that the calculated ages are fairly similar. The first model assumes that the universe has a\ncritical density of matter and no dark energy. The second model is the standard model described in the\npreceding paragraph. The first column in the table is the redshift, which is given by the equation z = \u0394\u03bb/\u03bb and\n0\nis a measure of how much the wavelength of light has been stretched by the expansion of the universe on its\nlong journey to us.\nAges of the Universe at Different Redshifts\nRedshift Percent of Current Age of Universe Percent of Current Age of Universe When the Light\nWhen the Light Was Emitted (mass Was Emitted (mass = 0.3 critical density; dark\n= critical density) energy = 0.7 critical density)\n0 100 (now) 100 (now)\n0.5 54 63\n1.0 35 43\n2.0 19 24\n3.0 13 16\n4.0 9 11\n5.0 7 9\n8.0 4 5\n11.9 2.1 2.7\nInfinite 0 0\nTable29.1\nNotice that as we find objects with higher and higher redshifts, we are looking back to smaller and smaller\nfractions of the age of the universe.

Amazingly, scientists have been able to calculate in some detail what was\nhappening in the universe in the first few minutes after the Big Bang. 994 29 \u2022 The Big Bang\nThe History of the Idea\nIt is one thing to say the universe had a beginning (as the equations of general relativity imply) and quite\nanother to describe that beginning. The Belgian priest and cosmologist GeorgesLema\u00eetrewas probably the\nfirst to propose a specific model for the Big Bang itself (Figure 29.11). He envisioned all the matter of the\nuniverse starting in one great bulk he called theprimeval atom, which then broke into tremendous numbers\nof pieces. Each of these pieces continued to fragment further until they became the present atoms of the\nuniverse, created in a vast nuclear fission. In a popular account of his theory, Lema\u00eetre wrote, \u201cThe evolution of\nthe world could be compared to a display of fireworks just ended\u2014some few red wisps, ashes, and smoke.\nStanding on a well-cooled cinder, we see the slow fading of the suns and we try to recall the vanished brilliance\nof the origin of the worlds.\u201d\nFigure29.11Abb\u00e9 Georges Lema\u00eetre (1894\u20131966).This Belgian cosmologist studied theology at Mechelen and mathematics and\nphysics at the University of Leuven. It was there that he began to explore the expansion of the universe and postulated its explosive\nbeginning. He actually predicted Hubble\u2019s law 2 years before its verification, and he was the first to consider seriously the physical\nprocesses by which the universe began.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView ashort video(https://openstax.org/l/30Lemaitrevid)about the work of Lema\u00eetre, considered by some\nto be the father of the Big Bang theory.\nPhysicists today know much more about nuclear physics than was known in the 1920s, and they have shown\nthat the primeval fission model cannot be correct. Yet Lema\u00eetre\u2019s vision was in some respects quite prophetic.\nWe still believe that everything was together at the beginning; it was just not in the form of matter we now\nknow. Basic physical principles tell us that when the universe was much denser, it was also much hotter, and\nthat it cools as it expands, much as gas cools when sprayed from an aerosol can.\nBy the 1940s, scientists knew that fusion of hydrogen into helium was the source of the Sun\u2019s energy. Fusion\nrequires high temperatures, and the early universe must have been hot. Based on these ideas, American\nphysicist George Gamow (Figure 29.12) suggested a universe with a different kind of beginning that involved\nnuclearfusioninstead of fission. Ralph Alpher worked out the details for his PhD thesis, and the results were\npublished in 1948. (Gamow, who had a quirky sense of humor, decided at the last minute to add the name of\nphysicist HansBetheto their paper, so that the coauthors on this paper about the beginning of things would\nbe Alpher, Bethe, and Gamow, a pun on the first three letters of the Greek alphabet: alpha, beta, and gamma.)\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.3 \u2022 The Beginning of the Universe 995\nGamow\u2019s universe started with fundamental particles that built up the heavy elements by fusion in the Big\nBang.\nFigure29.12George Gamow and Collaborators.This composite image shows George Gamow emerging like a genie from a bottle\nof ylem, a Greek term for the original substance from which the world formed. Gamow revived the term to describe the material of\nthe hot Big Bang. Flanking him are RobertHerman(left) and RalphAlpher(right), with whom he collaborated in working out the\nphysics of the Big Bang. (The modern composer Karlheinz Stockhausen was inspired by Gamow\u2019s ideas to write a piece of music\ncalledYlem, in which the players actually move away from the stage as they perform, simulating the expansion of the universe.)\nGamow\u2019s ideas were close to our modern view, except we now know that the early universe remained hot\nenough for fusion for only a short while. Thus, only the three lightest elements\u2014hydrogen, helium, and a\nsmall amount of lithium\u2014were formed in appreciable abundances at the beginning. The heavier elements\nformed later in stars. Since the 1940s, many astronomers and physicists have worked on a detailed theory of\nwhat happened in the early stages of the universe.\nThe First Few Minutes\nLet\u2019s start with the first few minutes following the Big Bang. Three basic ideas hold the key to tracing the\nchanges that occurred during the time just after the universe began. The first, as we have already mentioned,\nis that the universe cools as it expands.Figure 29.13shows how the temperature changes with the passage of\ntime. Note that a huge span of time, from a tiny fraction of a second to billions of years, is summarized in this\ndiagram. In the first fraction of a second, the universe was unimaginably hot. By the time 0.01 second had\nelapsed, the temperature had dropped to 100 billion (1011) K. After about 3 minutes, it had fallen to about 1\nbillion (109) K, still some 70 times hotter than the interior of the Sun. After a few hundred thousand years, the\ntemperature was down to a mere 3000 K, and the universe has continued to cool since that time. 996 29 \u2022 The Big Bang\nFigure29.13Temperature of the Universe.This graph shows how the temperature of the universe varies with time as predicted by\nthe standard model of the Big Bang. Note that both the temperature (vertical axis) and the time in seconds (horizontal axis) change\nover vast scales on this compressed diagram.\nAll of these temperatures but the last are derived from theoretical calculations since (obviously) no one was\nthere to measure them directly. As we shall see in the next section, however, we have actually detected the\nfeeble glow of radiation emitted at a time when the universe was a few hundred thousand years old. We can\nmeasure the characteristics of that radiation to learn what things were like long ago. Indeed, the fact that we\nhave found this ancient glow is one of the strongest arguments in favor of the Big Bang model.\nThe second step in understanding the evolution of the universe is to realize that at very early times, it was so\nhot that it contained mostly radiation (and not the matter that we see today). The photons that filled the\nuniverse could collide and produce material particles; that is, under the conditions just after the Big Bang,\nenergy could turn into matter (and matter could turn into energy). We can calculate how much mass is\nproduced from a given amount of energy by using Einstein\u2019s formulaE=mc2(see the chapter onThe Sun: A\nNuclear Powerhouse).\nThe idea that energy could turn into matter in the universe at large is a new one for many students, since it is\nnot part of our everyday experience. That\u2019s because, when we compare the universe today to what it was like\nright after the Big Bang, we live in cold, hard times. The photons in the universe today typically have far-less\nenergy than the amount required to make new matter. In the discussion on the source of the Sun\u2019s energy in\nThe Sun: A Nuclear Powerhouse, we briefly mentioned that when subatomic particles of matter andantimatter\ncollide, they turn into pure energy. But the reverse, energy turning into matter andantimatter, is equally\npossible. This process has been observed in particle accelerators around the world. If we have enough energy,\nunder the right circumstances, new particles of matter (and antimatter) are indeed created \u2014and the\nconditions were right during the first few minutes after the expansion of the universe began.\nOur third key point is that the hotter the universe was, the more energetic were the photons available to make\nmatter and antimatter (seeFigure 29.13). To take a specific example, at a temperature of 6 billion (6 \u00d7 109) K,\nthe collision of two typical photons can create an electron and its antimatter counterpart, a positron. If the\ntemperature exceeds 1014K, much more massive protons and antiprotons can be created.\nThe Evolution of the Early Universe\nKeeping these three ideas in mind, we can trace the evolution of the universe from the time it was about 0.01\nsecond old and had a temperature of about 100 billion K. Why not begin at the very beginning? There are as\nyet no theories that allow us penetrate to a time before about 10\u201343second (this number is a decimal point\nfollowed by 42 zeros and then a one). It is so small that we cannot relate it to anything in our everyday\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.3 \u2022 The Beginning of the Universe 997\nexperience. When the universe was that young, its density was so high that thetheory of general relativityis\nnot adequate to describe it, and even the concept of time breaks down.\nScientists, by the way, have been somewhat more successful in describing the universe when it was older than\n10\u201343second but still less than about 0.01 second old. We will take a look at some of these ideas later in this\nchapter, but for now, we want to start with somewhat more familiar situations.\nBy the time the universe was 0.01 second old, it consisted of a soup of matter and radiation; the matter\nincluded protons and neutrons, leftovers from an even younger and hotter universe. Each particle collided\nrapidly with other particles. The temperature was no longer high enough to allow colliding photons to produce\nneutrons or protons, but it was sufficient for the production of electrons and positrons (Figure 29.14). There\nwas probably also a sea of exotic subatomic particles that would later play a role as dark matter. All the\nparticles jiggled about on their own; it was still much too hot for protons and neutrons to combine to form the\nnuclei of atoms.\nFigure29.14Particle Interactions in the Early Universe.(a) In the first fractions of a second, when the universe was very hot,\nenergy was converted into particles and antiparticles. The reverse reaction also happened: a particle and antiparticle could collide\nand produce energy. (b) As the temperature of the universe decreased, the energy of typical photons became too low to create\nmatter. Instead, existing particles fused to create such nuclei as deuterium and helium. (c) Later, it became cool enough for electrons\nto settle down with nuclei and make neutral atoms. Most of the universe was still hydrogen.\nThink of the universe at this time as a seething cauldron, with photons colliding and interchanging energy, and\nsometimes being destroyed to create a pair of particles. The particles also collided with one another.\nFrequently, a matter particle and an antimatter particle met and turned each other into a burst of gamma-ray\nradiation.\nAmong the particles created in the early phases of the universe was the ghostlyneutrino(seeThe Sun: A\nNuclear Powerhouse), which today interacts only very rarely with ordinary matter. In the crowded conditions\nof the very early universe, however, neutrinos ran into so many electrons and positrons that they experienced\nfrequent interactions despite their \u201cantisocial\u201d natures.\nBy the time the universe was a little more than 1 second old, the density had dropped to the point where\nneutrinos no longer interacted with matter but simply traveled freely through space. In fact, theseneutrinos\nshould now be all around us. Since they have been traveling through space unimpeded (and hence\nunchanged) since the universe was 1 second old, measurements of their properties would offer one of the\nbest tests of the Big Bang model. Unfortunately, the very characteristic that makes them so useful\u2014the fact\nthat they interact so weakly with matter that they have survived unaltered for all but the first second of\ntime\u2014also renders them unable to be measured, at least with present techniques. Perhaps someday someone 998 29 \u2022 The Big Bang\nwill devise a way to capture these elusive messengers from the past.\nAtomic Nuclei Form\nWhen the universe was about 3 minutes old and its temperature was down to about 900 million K, protons and\nneutrons could combine. At higher temperatures, these atomic nuclei had immediately been blasted apart by\ninteractions with high-energy photons and thus could not survive. But at the temperatures and densities\nreached between 3 and 4 minutes after the beginning,deuterium(a proton and neutron) lasted long enough\nthat collisions could convert some of it into helium, (Figure 29.14). In essence, the entire universe was acting\nthe way centers of stars do today\u2014fusing new elements from simpler components. In addition, a little bit of\nelement 3,lithium, could also form.\nThis burst of cosmic fusion was only a brief interlude, however. By 4 minutes after the Big Bang, more helium\nwas having trouble forming. The universe was still expanding and cooling down. After the formation of helium\nand some lithium, the temperature had dropped so low that the fusion of helium nuclei into still-heavier\nelements could not occur. No elements beyond lithium could form in the first few minutes. That 4-minute\nperiod was the end of the time when the entire universe was a fusion factory. In the cool universe we know\ntoday, the fusion of new elements is limited to the centers of stars and the explosions of supernovae.\nStill, the fact that the Big Bang model allows the creation of a good deal of helium is the answer to a long-\nstanding mystery in astronomy. Put simply, there is just too much helium in the universe to be explained by\nwhat happens inside stars. All the generations of stars that have produced helium since the Big Bang cannot\naccount for the quantity of helium we observe. Furthermore, even the oldest stars and the most distant\ngalaxies show significant amounts of helium. These observations find a natural explanation in the synthesis of\nhelium by the Big Bang itself during the first few minutes of time. We estimate that10 times more heliumwas\nmanufactured in the first 4 minutes of the universe than in all the generations of stars during the succeeding\n10 to 15 billion years.\nLearning from Deuterium\nWe can learn many things from the way the early universe made atomic nuclei. It turns out that all of the\ndeuterium (a hydrogen nucleus with a neutron in it) in the universe was formed during the first 4 minutes. In\nstars, any region hot enough to fuse two protons to form a deuterium nucleus is also hot enough to change it\nfurther\u2014either by destroying it through a collision with an energetic photon or by converting it into helium\nthrough nuclear reactions.\nThe amount of deuterium that can be produced in the first 4 minutes of creation depends on the density of the\nuniverse at the time deuterium was formed. If the density were relatively high, nearly all the deuterium would\nhave been converted into helium through interactions with protons, just as it is in stars. If the density were\nrelatively low, then the universe would have expanded and thinned out rapidly enough that some deuterium\nwould have survived. The amount of deuterium we see today thus gives us a clue to the density of the\nuniverse when it was about 4 minutes old. Theoretical models can relate the density then to the density now;\nthus, measurements of the abundance of deuterium today can give us an estimate of the current density of\nthe universe.\nThe measurements of deuterium indicate that the present-day density of ordinary matter\u2014protons and\nneutrons\u2014is about 5 \u00d7 10\u201328kg/m3. Deuterium can only provide an estimate of the density of ordinary matter\nbecause the abundance of deuterium is determined by the particles that interact to form it, namely protons\nand neutrons alone. From the abundance of deuterium, we know that not enough protons and neutrons are\npresent, by a factor of about 20, to produce a critical-density universe.\nWe do know, however, that there are dark matter particles that add to the overall matter density of the\nuniverse, which is then higher than what is calculated for ordinary matter alone. Because dark matter particles\ndo not affect the production of deuterium, measurement of the deuterium abundance cannot tell us how\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.4 \u2022 The Cosmic Microwave Background 999\nmuch dark matter exists. Dark matter is made of some exotic kind of particle, not yet detected in any\nearthbound laboratory. It is definitely not made of protons and neutrons like the readers of this book.\n29.4 The Cosmic Microwave Background\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nExplain why we can observe the afterglow of the hot, early universe\nDiscuss the properties of this afterglow as we see it today, including its average temperature and the size\nof its temperature fluctuations\nDescribe open, flat, and curved universes and explain which type of universe is supported by observations\nSummarize our current knowledge of the basic properties of the universe including its age and contents\nThe description of the first few minutes of the universe is based on theoretical calculations. It is crucial,\nhowever, that a scientific theory should be testable. What predictions does it make? And do observations show\nthose predictions to be accurate? One success of the theory of the first few minutes of the universe is the\ncorrect prediction of the amount of helium in the universe.\nAnother prediction is that a significant milestone in the history of the universe occurred about 380,000 years\nafter the Big Bang. Scientists have directly observed what the universe was like at this early stage, and these\nobservations offer some of the strongest support for the Big Bang theory. To find out what this milestone was,\nlet\u2019s look at what theory tells us about what happened during the first few hundred thousand years after the\nBig Bang.\nThe fusion of helium and lithium was completed when the universe was about 4 minutes old. The universe\nthen continued to resemble the interior of a star in some ways for a few hundred thousand years more. It\nremained hot and opaque, with radiation being scattered from one particle to another. It was still too hot for\nelectrons to \u201csettle down\u201d and become associated with a particular nucleus; such free electrons are especially\neffective at scattering photons, thus ensuring that no radiation ever got very far in the early universe without\nhaving its path changed. In a way, the universe was like an enormous crowd right after a popular concert; if\nyou get separated from a friend, even if he is wearing a flashing button, it is impossible to see through the\ndense crowd to spot him. Only after the crowd clears is there a path for the light from his button to reach you.\nThe Universe Becomes Transparent\nNot until a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang, when the temperature had dropped to about 3000\nK and the density of atomic nuclei to about 1000 per cubic centimeter, did the electrons and nuclei manage to\ncombine to form stable atoms of hydrogen and helium (Figure 29.14). With no free electrons to scatter\nphotons, the universe became transparent for the first time in cosmic history. From this point on, matter and\nradiation interacted much less frequently; we say that theydecoupledfrom each other and evolved separately.\nSuddenly, electromagnetic radiation could really travel, and it has been traveling through the universe ever\nsince.\nDiscovery of the Cosmic Background Radiation\nIf the model of the universe described in the previous section is correct, then\u2014as we look far outward in the\nuniverse and thus far back in time\u2014the first \u201cafterglow\u201d of the hot, early universe should still be detectable.\nObservations of it would be very strong evidence that our theoretical calculations about how the universe\nevolved are correct. As we shall see, we have indeed detected the radiation emitted at thisphoton decoupling\ntime, when radiation began to stream freely through the universe without interacting with matter (Figure\n29.15). 1000 29 \u2022 The Big Bang\nFigure29.15Cosmic Microwave Background and Clouds Compared.(a) Early in the universe, photons (electromagnetic energy)\nwere scattering off the crowded, hot, charged particles and could not get very far without colliding with another particle. But after\nelectrons and photons settled into neutral atoms, there was far less scattering, and photons could travel over vast distances. The\nuniverse became transparent. As we look out in space and back in time, we can\u2019t see back beyond this time. (b) This is similar to\nwhat happens when we see clouds in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Water droplets in a cloud scatter light very efficiently, but clear air lets\nlight travel over long distances. So as we look up into the atmosphere, our vision is blocked by the cloud layers and we can\u2019t see\nbeyond them. (credit: modification of work by NASA)\nThe detection of this afterglow was initially an accident. In the late 1940s, RalphAlpherand RobertHerman,\nworking with GeorgeGamow, realized that just before the universe became transparent, it must have been\nradiating like a blackbody at a temperature of about 3000 K\u2014the temperature at which hydrogen atoms could\nbegin to form. If we could have seen that radiation just after neutral atoms formed, it would have resembled\nradiation from a reddish star. It was as if a giant fireball filled the whole universe.\nBut that was nearly 14 billion years ago, and, in the meantime, the scale of the universe has increased a\nthousand fold. This expansion has increased the wavelength of the radiation by a factor of 1000 (seeFigure\n29.7). According to Wien\u2019s law, which relates wavelength and temperature, the expansion has correspondingly\nlowered the temperature by a factor of 1000 (see the chapter onRadiation and Spectra). The cosmic\nbackground behaves like a blackbody and should therefore have a spectrum that obeys Wien\u2019s Law.\nAlpher and Herman predicted that the glow from the fireball should now be at radio wavelengths and should\nresemble the radiation from a blackbody at a temperature only a few degrees above absolute zero. Since the\nfireball was everywhere throughout the universe, the radiation left over from it should also be everywhere. If\nour eyes were sensitive to radio wavelengths, the whole sky would appear to glow very faintly. However, our\neyes can\u2019t see at these wavelengths, and at the time Alpher and Herman made their prediction, there were no\ninstruments that could detect the glow. Over the years, their prediction was forgotten.\nIn the mid-1960s, in Holmdel, New Jersey, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson of AT&T\u2019s Bell Laboratories had built\na delicate microwave antenna (Figure 29.16) to measure astronomical sources, including supernova remnants\nlike Cassiopeia A (see the chapter onThe Death of Stars). They were plagued with some unexpected\nbackground noise, just like faint static on a radio, which they could not get rid of. The puzzling thing about this\nradiation was that it seemed to be coming from all directions at once. This is very unusual in astronomy: after\nall, most radiation has a specific direction where it is strongest\u2014the direction of the Sun, or a supernova\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.4 \u2022 The Cosmic Microwave Background 1001\nremnant, or the disk of the Milky Way, for example.\nFigure29.16Robert Wilson (left) and Arno Penzias (right).These two scientists are standing in front of the horn-shaped antenna\nwith which they discovered the cosmic background radiation. The photo was taken in 1978, just after they received the Nobel Prize in\nphysics.\nPenzias and Wilson at first thought that any radiation appearing to come from all directions must originate\nfrom inside their telescope, so they took everything apart to look for the source of the noise. They even found\nthat some pigeons had roosted inside the big horn-shaped antenna and had left (as Penzias delicately put it)\n\u201ca layer of white, sticky, dielectric substance coating the inside of the antenna.\u201d However, nothing the\nscientists did could reduce the background radiation to zero, and they reluctantly came to accept that it must\nbe real, and it must be coming from space.\nPenzias and Wilson were not cosmologists, but as they began to discuss their puzzling discovery with other\nscientists, they were quickly put in touch with a group of astronomers and physicists at Princeton University (a\nshort drive away). These astronomers had\u2014as it happened\u2014been redoing the calculations of Alpher and\nHerman from the 1940s and also realized that the radiation from the decoupling time should be detectable as\na faint afterglow of radio waves. The different calculations of what the observed temperature would be for this\n2\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) were uncertain, but all predicted less than 40 K.\nPenzias and Wilson found the distribution of intensity at different radio wavelengths to correspond to a\ntemperature of 3.5 K. This is very cold\u2014closer to absolute zero than most other astronomical\nmeasurements\u2014and a testament to how much space (and the waves within it) has stretched. Their\nmeasurements have been repeated with better instruments, which give us a reading of 2.73 K. So Penzias and\nWilson came very close. Rounding this value, scientists often refer to \u201cthe 3-degree microwave background.\u201d\nMany other experiments on Earth and in space soon confirmed the discovery by Penzias and Wilson: The\nradiation was indeed coming from all directions (it was isotropic) and matched the predictions of the Big Bang\ntheory with remarkable precision. Penzias and Wilson had inadvertently observed the glow from the primeval\nfireball. They received the Nobel Prize for their work in 1978. And just before his death in 1966, Lema\u00eetre\nlearned that his \u201cvanished brilliance\u201d had been discovered and confirmed.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nYou may enjoy watchingThree Degrees, a26-minute video(https://openstax.org/l/30threedegvid)from\nBell Labs about Penzias and Wilson\u2019s discovery of the cosmic background radiation (with interesting\nhistorical footage).\n2 Recall that microwaves are in the radio region of the electromagnetic spectrum. 1002 29 \u2022 The Big Bang\nProperties of the Cosmic Microwave Background\nOne issue that worried astronomers is that Penzias and Wilson were measuring the background radiation\nfilling space through Earth\u2019s atmosphere. What if that atmosphere is a source of radio waves or somehow\naffected their measurements? It would be better to measure something this important from space.\nThe first accurate measurements of the CMB were made with a satellite orbiting Earth. Named the Cosmic\nBackground Explorer (COBE), it was launched by NASA in November 1989. The data it received quickly showed\nthat the CMB closely matches that expected from a blackbody with a temperature of 2.73 K (Figure 29.17). This\nis exactly the result expected if the CMB was indeed redshifted radiation emitted by a hot gas that filled all of\nspace shortly after the universe began.\nFigure29.17Cosmic Background Radiation.The solid line shows how the intensity of radiation should change with wavelength for\na blackbody with a temperature of 2.73 K. The boxes show the intensity of the cosmic background radiation as measured at various\nwavelengths by COBE\u2019s instruments. The fit is perfect. When this graph was first shown at a meeting of astronomers, they gave it a\nstanding ovation.\nThe first important conclusion from measurements of the CMB, therefore, is that the universe we have today\nhas indeed evolved from a hot, uniform state. This observation also provides direct support for the general\nidea that we live in an evolving universe, since the universe is cooler today than it was in the beginning.\nSmall Differences in the CMB\nIt was known even before the launch of COBE that the CMB is extremelyisotropic. In fact, its uniformity in\nevery direction is one of the best confirmations of the cosmological principle\u2014 that the universe is\nhomogenous and isotropic.\nAccording to our theories, however, the temperature could not have beenperfectlyuniform when the CMB\nwas emitted. After all, the CMB is radiation that was scattered from the particles in the universe at the time of\ndecoupling. If the radiation were completely smooth, then all those particles must have been distributed\nthrough space absolutely evenly. Yet it is those particles that have become all the galaxies and stars (and\nastronomy students) that now inhabit the cosmos. Had the particles been completely smoothly distributed,\nthey could not have formed all the large-scale structures now present in the universe\u2014the clusters and\nsuperclusters of galaxies discussed in the last few chapters.\nThe early universe must have had tiny density fluctuations from which such structures could evolve. Regions of\nhigher-than-average density would have attracted additional matter and eventually grown into the galaxies\nand clusters that we see today. It turns out that these denser regions would appear to us to be colder spots,\nthat is, they would have lower-than-average temperatures.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.4 \u2022 The Cosmic Microwave Background 1003\nThe reason that temperature and density are related can be explained this way. At the time of decoupling,\nphotons in a slightly denser portion of space had to expend some of their energy to escape the gravitational\nforce exerted by the surrounding gas. In losing energy, the photons became slightly colder than the overall\naverage temperature at the time of decoupling. Vice versa, photons that were located in a slightly less dense\nportion of space lost less energy upon leaving it than other photons, thus appearing slightly hotter than\naverage. Therefore, if the seeds of present-day galaxies existed at the time that the CMB was emitted, we\nshould see some slight variations in the CMB temperature as we look in different directions in the sky.\nScientists working with the data from the COBE satellite did indeed detect very subtle temperature\ndifferences\u2014about 1 part in 100,000\u2014in the CMB. The regions of lower-than-average temperature come in a\nvariety of sizes, but even the smallest of the colder areas detected by COBE is far too large to be the precursor\nof an individual galaxy, or even a supercluster of galaxies. This is because the COBE instrument had \u201cblurry\nvision\u201d (poor resolution) and could only measure large patches of the sky. We needed instruments with\n\u201csharper vision.\u201d\nThe most detailed measurements of the CMB have been obtained by two satellites launched more recently\nthan COBE. The results from the first of these satellites, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)\nspacecraft, were published in 2003. In 2015, measurements from the Planck satellite extended the WMAP\nmeasurements to even-higher spatial resolution and lower noise (Figure 29.18).\nFigure29.18CMB Observations.This comparison shows how much detail can be seen in the observations of three satellites used to\nmeasure the CMB. The CMB is a snapshot of the oldest light in our universe, imprinted on the sky when the universe was just about\n380,000 years old. The first spacecraft, launched in 1989, is NASA\u2019s Cosmic Background Explorer, or COBE. WMAP was launched in 1004 29 \u2022 The Big Bang\n2001, and Planck was launched in 2009. The three panels show 10-square-degree patches of all-sky maps. This cosmic background\nradiation image (bottom) is an all-sky map of the CMB as observed by the Planck mission. The colors in the map represent different\ntemperatures: red for warmer and blue for cooler. These tiny temperature fluctuations correspond to regions of slightly different\ndensities, representing the seeds of all future structures: the stars, galaxies, and galaxy clusters of today. (credit top: modification of\nwork by NASA/JPL-Caltech/ESA; credit bottom: modification of work by ESA and the Planck Collaboration)\nTheoretical calculations show that the sizes of the hot and cold spots in the CMB depend on the geometry of\nthe universe and hence on its total density. (It\u2019s not at all obvious that it should do so, and it takes some pretty\nfancy calculations\u2014way beyond the level of our text\u2014to make the connection, but having such a dependence\nis very useful.) The total density we are discussing here includes both the amount of mass in the universe and\nthe mass equivalent of the dark energy. That is, we must add together mass and energy: ordinary matter, dark\nmatter, and the dark energy that is speeding up the expansion.\nTo see why this works, remember (from the chapter onBlack Holes and Curved Spacetime) that with histheory\nof general relativity, Einstein showed that matter can curve space and that the amount of curvature depends\non the amount of matter present. Therefore, the total amount of matter in the universe (including dark matter\nand the equivalent matter contribution by dark energy), determines the overall geometry of space. Just like the\ngeometry of space around a black hole has a curvature to it, so the entire universe may have a curvature. Let\u2019s\ntake a look at the possibilities (Figure 29.19).\nIf the density of matter is higher than the critical density, the universe will eventually collapse. In such a closed\nuniverse, two initially parallel rays of light will eventually meet. This kind of geometry is referred to as spherical\ngeometry. If the density of matter is less than critical, the universe will expand forever. Two initially parallel\nrays of light will diverge, and this is referred to as hyperbolic geometry. In a critical-density universe, two\nparallel light rays never meet, and the expansion comes to a halt only at some time infinitely far in the future.\nWe refer to this as aflat universe, and the kind of Euclidean geometry you learned in high school applies in\nthis type of universe.\nFigure29.19Picturing Space Curvature for the Entire Universe.The density of matter and energy determines the overall\ngeometry of space. If the density of the universe is greater than the critical density, then the universe will ultimately collapse and\nspace is said to beclosedlike the surface of a sphere. If the density exactly equals the critical density, then space isflatlike a sheet of\npaper; the universe will expand forever, with the rate of expansion coming to a halt infinitely far in the future. If the density is less\nthan critical, then the expansion will continue forever and space is said to beopenand negatively curved like the surface of a saddle\n(where more space than you expect opens up as you move farther away). Note that the red lines in each diagram show what\nhappens in each kind of space\u2014they are initially parallel but follow different paths depending on the curvature of space. Remember\nthat these drawings are trying to show how space for the entire universe is \u201cwarped\u201d\u2014this can\u2019t be seen locally in the small amount\nof space that we humans occupy.\nIf the density of the universe is equal to the critical density, then the hot and cold spots in the CMB should\ntypically be about a degree in size. If the density is greater than critical, then the typical sizes will be larger\nthan one degree. If the universe has a density less than critical, then the structures will appear smaller. In\nFigure 29.20, you can see the differences easily. WMAP and Planck observations of the CMB confirmed earlier\nexperiments that we do indeed live in a flat, critical-density universe.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.4 \u2022 The Cosmic Microwave Background 1005\nFigure29.20Comparison of CMB Observations with Possible Models of the Universe.Cosmological simulations predict that if\nour universe has critical density, then the CMB images will be dominated by hot and cold spots of around one degree in size (bottom\ncenter). If, on the other hand, the density is higher than critical (and the universe will ultimately collapse), then the images\u2019 hot and\ncold spots will appear larger than one degree (bottom left). If the density of the universe is less than critical (and the expansion will\ncontinue forever), then the structures will appear smaller (bottom right). As the measurements show, the universe is at critical\ndensity. The measurements shown were made by a balloon-borne instrument called BOOMERanG (Balloon Observations of\nMillimetric Extragalactic Radiation and Geophysics), which was flown in Antarctica. Subsequent satellite observations by WMAP and\nPlanck confirm the BOOMERanG result. (credit: modification of work by NASA)\nKey numbers from an analysis of the Planck data give us the best values currently available for some of the\nbasic properties of the universe:\n\u2022 Age of universe: 13.799 \u00b1 0.038 billion years (Note: That means we know the age of the universe to within\n38 million years. Amazing!)\n\u2022 Hubble constant: 67.31 \u00b1 0.96 kilometers/second/million parsecs (in the units we\u2019ve been using, 20.65\nkilometers/second/million light-years)\n\u2022 Fraction of universe\u2019s content that is \u201cdark energy\u201d: 68.5% \u00b1 1.3%\n\u2022 Fraction of the universe\u2019s content that is matter: 31.5% \u00b1 1.3%\nNote that this value for theHubble constantis slightly smaller than the value of 70 kilometers/second/million\nparsecs that we have adopted in this book. In fact, the value derived from measurements of redshifts is 73\nkilometers/second/million parsecs. So precise is modern cosmology these days that scientists are working\nhard to resolve this discrepancy. The fact that the difference between these two independent measurements is\nso small is actually a remarkable achievement. Only a few decades ago, astronomers were arguing about\nwhether the Hubble constant was around 50 kilometers/second/million parsecs or 100 kilometers/second/\nmillion parsecs. 1006 29 \u2022 The Big Bang\nAnalysis of Planck data also shows that ordinary matter (mainly protons and neutrons) makes up 4.9% of the\ntotal density. Dark matter plus normal matter add up to 31.5% of the total density. Dark energy contributes the\nremaining 68.5%. The age of the universe at decoupling\u2014that is, when the CMB was emitted\u2014was 380,000\nyears.\nPerhaps the most surprising result from the high-precision measurements by WMAP and the even higher-\nprecision measurements from Planck is that there were no surprises. The model of cosmology with ordinary\nmatter at about 5%, dark matter at about 25%, and dark energy about 70% has survived since the late 1990s\nwhen cosmologists were forced in that direction by the supernovae data. In other words, the very strange\nuniverse that we have been describing, with only about 5% of its contents being made up of the kinds of\nmatter we are familiar with here on Earth, really seems to be the universe we live in.\nAfter the CMB was emitted, the universe continued to expand and cool off. By 400 to 500 million years after the\nBig Bang, the very first stars and galaxies had already formed. Deep in the interiors of stars, matter was\nreheated, nuclear reactions were ignited, and the more gradual synthesis of the heavier elements that we\nhave discussed throughout this book began.\nWe conclude this quick tour of our model of the early universe with a reminder. You must not think of the Big\nBang as alocalizedexplosionin space, like an exploding superstar. There were no boundaries and there was\nno single site where the explosion happened. It was an explosionof space(and time and matter and energy)\nthat happened everywhere in the universe. All matter and energy that exist today, including the particles of\nwhich you are made, came from the Big Bang. We were, and still are, in the midst of a Big Bang; it is all around\nus.\n29.5 What Is the Universe Really Made Of?\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nSpecify what fraction of the density of the universe is contributed by stars and galaxies and how much\nordinary matter (such as hydrogen, helium, and other elements we are familiar with here on Earth) makes up\nthe overall density\nDescribe how ideas about the contents of the universe have changed over the last 50 years\nExplain why it is so difficult to determine what dark matter really is\nExplain why dark matter helped galaxies form quickly in the early universe\nSummarize the evolution of the universe from the time the CMB was emitted to the present day\nThe model of the universe we described in the previous section is the simplest model that explains the\nobservations. It assumes that general relativity is the correct theory of gravity throughout the universe. With\nthis assumption, the model then accounts for the existence and structure of the CMB; the abundances of the\nlight elements deuterium, helium, and lithium; and the acceleration of the expansion of the universe. All of the\nobservations to date support the validity of the model, which is referred to as the standard (or concordance)\nmodel of cosmology.\nFigure 29.21andTable 29.2summarize the current best estimates of the contents of the universe. Luminous\nmatter in stars and galaxies and neutrinos contributes about 1% of the mass required to reach critical density.\nAnother 4% is mainly in the form of hydrogen and helium in the space between stars and in intergalactic\nspace. Dark matter accounts for about an additional 27% of the critical density. The mass equivalent of dark\nenergy (according toE=mc2) then supplies the remaining 68% of the critical density.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.5 \u2022 What Is the Universe Really Made Of? 1007\nFigure29.21Composition of the Universe.Only about 5% of all the mass and energy in the universe is matter with which we are\nfamiliar here on Earth. Most ordinary matter consists of hydrogen and helium located in interstellar and intergalactic space. Only\nabout one-half of 1% of the critical density of the universe is found in stars. Dark matter and dark energy, which have not yet been\ndetected in earthbound laboratories, account for 95% of the contents of the universe.\nWhat Different Kinds of Objects Contribute to the Density of the Universe\nObject Density as a Percent of Critical Density\nLuminous matter (stars, etc.) <1\nHydrogen and helium in interstellar and intergalactic space 4\nDark matter 27\nEquivalent mass density of the dark energy 68\nTable29.2\nThis table should shock you.

This whole textbook,\nwhich has focused on objects that emit electromagnetic radiation, has generally been ignoring 95% of what is\nout there. Who says there aren\u2019t big mysteries yet to solve in science!\nFigure 29.22shows how our ideas of the composition of the universe have changed over just the past three\ndecades. The fraction of the universe that we think is made of the same particles as astronomy students has\nbeen decreasing steadily. 1008 29 \u2022 The Big Bang\nFigure29.22Changing Estimates of the Content of the Universe.This diagram shows the changes in our understanding of the\ncontents of the universe over the past three decades. In the 1970s, we suspected that most of the matter in the universe was\ninvisible, but we thought that this matter might be ordinary matter (protons, neutrons, etc.) that was simply not producing\nelectromagnetic radiation. By the 1980s, it was becoming likely that most of the dark matter was made of something we had not yet\ndetected on Earth. By the late 1990s, a variety of experiments had shown that we live in a critical -density universe and that dark\nenergy contributes about 70% of what is required to reach critical density. Note how the estimate of the relative importance of\nordinary luminous matter (shown in yellow) has diminished over time.\nWhat Is Dark Matter?\nMany astronomers find the situation we have described very satisfying. Several independent experiments now\nagree on the type of universe we live in and on the inventory of what it contains. We seem to be very close to\nhaving a cosmological model that explains nearly everything. Others are not yet ready to jump on the\nbandwagon. They say, \u201cshow me the 96% of the universe we can\u2019t detect directly\u2014for example, find me some\ndark matter!\u201d\nAt first, astronomers thought thatdark mattermight be hidden in objects that appear dark because they emit\nno light (e.g., black holes) or that are too faint to be observed at large distances (e.g., planets or white dwarfs).\nHowever, these objects would be made of ordinary matter, and the deuterium abundance tells us that no\nmore than 5% of the critical density consists of ordinary matter.\nAnother possible form that dark matter can take is some type of elementary particle that we have not yet\ndetected here on Earth\u2014a particle that has mass and exists in sufficient abundance to contribute 23% of the\ncritical density. Some physics theories predict the existence of such particles. One class of these particles has\nbeen given the name WIMPs, which stands forweakly interacting massive particles. Since these particles do\nnot participate in nuclear reactions leading to the production of deuterium, the deuterium abundance puts no\nlimits on how many WIMPs might be in the universe. (A number of other exotic particles have also been\nsuggested as prime constituents of dark matter, but we will confine our discussion to WIMPs as a useful\nexample.)\nIf large numbers of WIMPs do exist, then some of them should be passing through our physics laboratories\nright now. The trick is to catch them. Since by definition they interact only weakly (infrequently) with other\nmatter, the chances that they will have a measurable effect are small. We don\u2019t know the mass of these\nparticles, but various theories suggest that it might be a few to a few hundred times the mass of a proton. If\nWIMPs are 60 times the mass of a proton, there would be about 10 million of them passing through your\noutstretched hand every second\u2014with absolutely no effect on you. If that seems too mind-boggling, bear in\nmind that neutrinos interact weakly with ordinary matter, and yet we were able to \u201ccatch\u201d them eventually.\nDespite the challenges, more than 30 experiments designed to detect WIMPS are in operation or in the\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.5 \u2022 What Is the Universe Really Made Of? 1009\nplanning stages. Predictions of how many times WIMPs might actually collide with the nucleus of an atom in\nthe instrument designed to detect them are in the range of 1 event per year to 1 event per 1000 years per\nkilogram of detector. The detector must therefore be large. It must be shielded from radioactivity or other\ntypes of particles, such as neutrons, passing through it, and hence these detectors are placed in deep mines.\nThe energy imparted to an atomic nucleus in the detector by collision with a WIMP will be small, and so the\ndetector must be cooled to a very low temperature.\nThe WIMP detectors are made out of crystals of germanium, silicon, or xenon. The detectors are cooled to a\nfew thousandths of a degree\u2014very close to absolute zero. That means that the atoms in the detector are so\ncold that they are scarcely vibrating at all. If a dark matter particle collides with one of the atoms, it will cause\nthe whole crystal to vibrate and the temperature therefore to increase ever so slightly. Some other interactions\nmay generate a detectable flash of light.\nA different kind of search for WIMPs is being conducted at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, Europe\u2019s\nparticle physics lab near Geneva, Switzerland. In this experiment, protons collide with enough energy\npotentially to produce WIMPs. The LHC detectors cannot detect the WIMPs directly, but if WIMPs are\nproduced, they will pass through the detectors, carrying energy away with them. Experimenters will then add\nup all the energy that they detect as a result of the collisions of protons to determine if any energy is missing.\nSo far, none of these experiments has detected WIMPs. Will the newer experiments pay off? Or will scientists\nhave to search for some other explanation for dark matter? Only time will tell (Figure 29.23).\nFigure29.23Dark Matter.This cartoon from NASA takes a humorous look at how little we yet understand about dark matter.\n(credit: NASA)\nDark Matter and the Formation of Galaxies\nAs elusive as dark matter may be in the current-day universe, galaxies could not have formed quickly without\nit. Galaxies grew from density fluctuations in the early universe, and some had already formed only about\n400\u2013500 million years after the Big Bang. The observations with WMAP, Planck, and other experiments give us\ninformation on the size of those density fluctuations. It turns out that the density variations we observe are\ntoo small to have formed galaxies so soon after the Big Bang. In the hot, early universe, energetic photons 1010 29 \u2022 The Big Bang\ncollided with hydrogen and helium, and kept them moving so rapidly that gravity was still not strong enough\nto cause the atoms to come together to form galaxies. How can we reconcile this with the fact that galaxiesdid\nform and are all around us?\nOur instruments that measure the CMB give us information about density fluctuations only forordinary\nmatter, which interacts with radiation. Dark matter, as its name indicates, does not interact with photons at all.\nDark matter could have had much greater variations in density and been able to come together to form\ngravitational \u201ctraps\u201d that could then have begun to attract ordinary matter immediately after the universe\nbecame transparent. As ordinary matter became increasingly concentrated, it could have turned into galaxies\nquickly thanks to these dark matter traps.\nFor an analogy, imagine a boulevard with traffic lights every half mile or so. Suppose you are part of a\nmotorcade of cars accompanied by police who lead you past each light, even if it is red. So, too, when the early\nuniverse was opaque, radiation interacted with ordinary matter, imparting energy to it and carrying it along,\nsweeping past the concentrations of dark matter. Now suppose the police leave the motorcade, which then\nencounters some red lights. The lights act as traffic traps; approaching cars now have to stop, and so they\nbunch up. Likewise, after the early universe became transparent, ordinary matter interacted with radiation\nonly occasionally and so could fall into the dark matter traps.\nThe Universe in a Nutshell\nIn the previous sections of this chapter, we traced the evolution of the universe progressively further back in\ntime. Astronomical discovery has followed this path historically, as new instruments and new techniques have\nallowed us to probe ever closer to the beginning of time. The rate of expansion of the universe was\ndetermined from measurements of nearby galaxies. Determinations of the abundances of deuterium, helium,\nand lithium based on nearby stars and galaxies were used to put limits on how much ordinary matter is in the\nuniverse. The motions of stars in galaxies and of galaxies within clusters of galaxies could only be explained if\nthere were large quantities of dark matter. Measurements of supernovae that exploded when the universe\nwas about half as old as it is now indicated that the rate of expansion of the universe has sped up since those\nexplosions occurred. Observations of extremely faint galaxies show that galaxies had begun to form when the\nuniverse was only 400\u2013500 million years old. And observations of the CMB confirmed early theories that the\nuniverse was initially very hot.\nBut all this moving further and further backward in time might have left you a bit dizzy. So now let\u2019s instead\nshow how the universe evolves as time moves forward.\nFigure 29.24summarizes the entire history of the observable universe from the beginning in a single diagram.\nThe universe was very hot when it began to expand. We have fossil remnants of the very early universe in the\nform of neutrons, protons, electrons, and neutrinos, and the atomic nuclei that formed when the universe was\n3\u20134 minutes old: deuterium, helium, and a small amount of lithium. Dark matter also remains, but we do not\nyet know what form it is in.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.5 \u2022 What Is the Universe Really Made Of? 1011\nFigure29.24History of the Universe.This image summarizes the changes that have occurred in the universe during the last 13.8\nbillion years. Protons, deuterium, helium, and some lithium were produced in the initial fireball. About 380,000 years after the Big\nBang, the universe became transparent to electromagnetic radiation for the first time. COBE, WMAP, Planck, and other instruments\nhave been used to study the radiation that was emitted at that time and that is still visible today (the CMB). The universe was then\ndark (except for this background radiation) until the first stars and galaxies began to form only a few hundred million years after the\nBig Bang. Existing space and ground-based telescopes have made substantial progress in studying the subsequent evolution of\ngalaxies. (credit: modification of work by NASA/WMAP Science Team)\nThe universe gradually cooled; when it was about 380,000 years old, and at a temperature of about 3000 K,\nelectrons combined with protons to form hydrogen atoms. At this point, as we saw, the universe became\ntransparent to light, and astronomers have detected the CMB emitted at this time. The universe still contained\nno stars or galaxies, and so it entered what astronomers call \u201cthe dark ages\u201d (since stars were not lighting up\nthe darkness). During the next several hundred million years, small fluctuations in the density of the dark\nmatter grew, forming gravitational traps that concentrated the ordinary matter, which began to form galaxies\nabout 400\u2013500 million years after the Big Bang.\nBy the time the universe was about a billion years old, it had entered its own renaissance: it was again blazing\nwith radiation, but this time from newly formed stars, star clusters, and small galaxies. Over the next several\nbillion years, small galaxies merged to form the giants we see today. Clusters and superclusters of galaxies\nbegan to grow, and the universe eventually began to resemble what we see nearby.\nDuring the next 20 years, astronomers plan to build giant new telescopes both in space and on the ground to\nexplore even further back in time. In 2021, the James Webb Space Telescope, a 6.5-meter telescope that is the\nsuccessor to the Hubble Space Telescope, will be launched and assembled in space. The predictions are that\nwith this powerful instrument (seeFigure 29.1) we should be able to look back far enough to analyze in detail\nthe formation of the first galaxies. 1012 29 \u2022 The Big Bang\n29.6 The Inflationary Universe\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe two important properties of the universe that the simple Big Bang model cannot explain\nExplain why these two characteristics of the universe can be accounted for if there was a period of rapid\nexpansion (inflation) of the universe just after the Big Bang\nName the four forces that control all physical processes in the universe\nThe hot Big Bang model that we have been describing is remarkably successful. It accounts for the expansion\nof the universe, explains the observations of the CMB, and correctly predicts the abundances of the light\nelements. As it turns out, this model also predicts that there should be exactly three types of neutrinos in\nnature, and this prediction has been confirmed by experiments with high-energy accelerators. We can\u2019t relax\njust yet, however. This standard model of the universe doesn\u2019t explainallthe observations we have made\nabout the universe as a whole.\nProblems with the Standard Big Bang Model\nThere are a number of characteristics of the universe that can only be explained by considering further what\nmight have happened before the emission of the CMB. One problem with the standardBig Bangmodel is that\nit does not explain why the density of the universe is equal to the critical density. The mass density could have\nbeen, after all, so low and the effects of dark energy so high that the expansion would have been too rapid to\nform any galaxies at all. Alternatively, there could have been so much matter that the universe would have\nalready begun to contract long before now. Why is the universe balanced so precisely on the knife edge of the\ncritical density?\nAnother puzzle is the remarkableuniformityof the universe. The temperature of the CMB is the same to about\n1 part in 100,000 everywhere we look. This sameness might be expected if all the parts of the visible universe\nwere in contact at some point in time and had the time to come to the same temperature. In the same way, if\nwe put some ice into a glass of lukewarm water and wait a while, the ice will melt and the water will cool down\nuntil they are the same temperature.\nHowever, if we accept the standard Big Bang model, all parts of the visible universe werenotin contact at any\ntime. The fastest that information can go from one point to another is the speed of light. There is a maximum\ndistance that light can have traveled from any point since the time the universe began\u2014that\u2019s the distance\nlight could have covered since then. This distance is called that point\u2019shorizon distancebecause anything\nfarther away is \u201cbelow its horizon\u201d\u2014unable to make contact with it. One region of space separated by more\nthan thehorizon distancefrom another has been completely isolated from it through the entire history of the\nuniverse.\nIf we measure the CMB in two opposite directions in the sky, we are observing regions that were significantly\nbeyond each other\u2019s horizon distance at the time the CMB was emitted. We can see both regions, buttheycan\nnever have seen each other. Why, then, are their temperatures so precisely the same? According to the\nstandard Big Bang model, they have never been able to exchange information, and there is no reason they\nshould have identical temperatures. (It\u2019s a little like seeing the clothes that all the students wear at two\nschools in different parts of the world become identical, without the students ever having been in contact.) The\nonly explanation we could suggest was simply that the universe somehowstarted outbeing absolutely\nuniform (which is like saying all students were born liking the same clothes). Scientists are always\nuncomfortable when they must appeal to a special set of initial conditions to account for what they see.\nThe Inflationary Hypothesis\nSome physicists suggested that these fundamental characteristics of the cosmos\u2014its flatness and\nuniformity\u2014can be explained if shortly after the Big Bang (and before the emission of the CMB), the universe\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.6 \u2022 The Inflationary Universe 1013\nexperienced a sudden increase in size. A model universe in which this rapid, early expansion occurs is called an\ninflationary universe. The inflationary universe is identical to the Big Bang universe for all time after the first\n10\u201330second. Prior to that, the model suggests that there was a brief period of extraordinarily rapid expansion\nor inflation, during which the scale of the universe increased by a factor of about 1050times more than\npredicted by standard Big Bang models (Figure 29.25).\nFigure29.25Expansion of the Universe.This graph shows how the scale factor of the observable universe changes with time for\nthe standard Big Bang model (red line) and for the inflationary model (blue line). (Note that the time scale at the bottom is extremely\ncompressed.) During inflation, regions that were very small and in contact with each other are suddenly blown up to be much larger\nand outside each other\u2019s horizon distance. The two models are the same for all times after 10\u201330second.\nPrior to (and during) inflation, all the parts of the universe that we can now see were so small and close to\neach other that theycouldexchange information, that is, the horizon distance included all of the universe that\nwe can now observe. Before (and during) inflation, there was adequate time for the observable universe to\nhomogenize itself and come to the same temperature. Then, inflation expanded those regions tremendously,\nso that many parts of the universe are now beyond each other\u2019s horizon.\nAnother appeal of the inflationary model is its prediction that the density of the universe should be exactly\nequal to the critical density. To see why this is so, remember that curvature of spacetime is intimately linked to\nthe density of matter. If the universe began with some curvature of its spacetime, one analogy for it might be\nthe skin of a balloon. The period of inflation was equivalent to blowing up the balloon to a tremendous size.\nThe universe became so big that from our vantage point, no curvature should be visible (Figure 29.26). In the\nsame way, Earth\u2019s surface is so big that it looks flat to us no matter where we are. Calculations show that a\nuniverse with no curvature is one that is at critical density. Universes with densities either higher or lower than\nthe critical density would show marked curvature. But we saw that the observations of the CMB inFigure\n29.18, which show that the universe has critical density, rule out the possibility that space is significantly\ncurved. 1014 29 \u2022 The Big Bang\nFigure29.26Analogy for Inflation.During a period of rapid inflation, a curved balloon grows so large that to any local observer it\nlooks flat. The inset shows the geometry from the ant\u2019s point of view.\nGrand Unified Theories\nWhile inflation is an intriguing idea and widely accepted by researchers, we cannot directly observe events so\nearly in the universe. The conditions at the time of inflation were so extreme that we cannot reproduce them\nin our laboratories or high-energy accelerators, but scientists have some ideas about what the universe might\nhave been like. These ideas are calledgrand unified theoriesor GUTs.\nIn GUT models, the forces that we are familiar with here on Earth, including gravity and electromagnetism,\nbehaved very differently in the extreme conditions of the early universe than they do today. In physical\nscience, the termforceis used to describe anything that can change the motion of a particle or body. One of\nthe remarkable discoveries of modern science is that all known physical processes can be described through\nthe action of just four forces: gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force\n(Table 29.3).\nThe Forces of Nature\nForce Relative Strength Range of Important Applications\nToday Action\nWhole\nGravity 1 Motions of planets, stars, galaxies\nuniverse\nWhole Atoms, molecules, electricity, magnetic\nElectromagnetism 1036\nuniverse fields\nWeak nuclear\n1033 10\u201317meters Radioactive decay\nforce\nStrong nuclear\n1038 10\u201315meters The existence of atomic nuclei\nforce\nTable29.3\nGravity is perhaps the most familiar force, and certainly appears strong if you jump off a tall building.\nHowever, the force of gravity between two elementary particles\u2014say two protons\u2014is by far the weakest of the\nfour forces. Electromagnetism\u2014which includes both magnetic and electrical forces, holds atoms together, and\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.6 \u2022 The Inflationary Universe 1015\nproduces the electromagnetic radiation that we use to study the universe\u2014is much stronger, as you can see in\nTable 29.3. The weak nuclear force is only weak in comparison to its strong \u201ccousin,\u201d but it is in fact much\nstronger than gravity.\nBoth the weak and strong nuclear forces differ from the first two forces in that they act only over very small\ndistances\u2014those comparable to the size of an atomic nucleus or less. The weak force is involved in radioactive\ndecay and in reactions that result in the production of neutrinos. The strong force holds protons and neutrons\ntogether in an atomic nucleus.\nPhysicists have wondered why there are four forces in the universe\u2014why not 300 or, preferably, just one? An\nimportant hint comes from the nameelectromagnetic force. For a long time, scientists thought that the forces\nof electricity and magnetism were separate, but James ClerkMaxwell(see the chapter onRadiation and\nSpectra) was able tounifythese forces\u2014to show that they are aspects of the same phenomenon. In the same\nway, many scientists (including Einstein) have wondered if the four forces we now know could also be unified.\nPhysicists have actually developed GUTs that unify three of the four forces (but not gravity).\nIn these theories, the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces are not three independent forces but instead\nare different manifestations or aspects of what is, in fact, a single force. The theories predict that at high\nenough temperatures, there would be only one force. At lower temperatures (like the ones in the universe\ntoday), however, this single force has changed into three different forces (Figure 29.27). Just as different gases\nor liquids freeze at different temperatures, we can say that the different forces \u201cfroze out\u201d of the unified force\nat different temperatures. Unfortunately, the temperatures at which the three forces acted as one force are so\nhigh that they cannot be reached in any laboratory on Earth. Only the early universe, at times prior to 10\u201335\nsecond, was hot enough to unify these forces.\nFigure29.27Four Forces That Govern the Universe.The behavior of the four forces depends on the temperature of the universe.\nThis diagram (inspired by some grand unified theories) shows that at very early times when the temperature of the universe was\nvery high, all four forces resembled one another and were indistinguishable. As the universe cooled, the forces took on separate and\ndistinctive characteristics.\nMany physicists think that gravity was also unified with the three other forces at still higher temperatures, and\nscientists have tried to develop a theory that combines all four forces. For example, instring theory, the point-\nlike particles of matter that we have discussed in this book are replaced by one-dimensional objects called\nstrings. In this theory, infinitesimal strings, which have length but not height or width, are the building blocks\nused to construct all the forms of matter and energy in the universe. These strings exist in 11-dimensional\nspace (not the 4-dimensional spacetime with which we are familiar). The strings vibrate in the various 1016 29 \u2022 The Big Bang\ndimensions, and depending on how they vibrate, they are seen in our world as matter or gravity or light. As\nyou can imagine, the mathematics of string theory is very complex, and the theory remains untested by\nexperiments. Even the largest particle accelerators on Earth do not achieve high enough energy to show\nwhether string theory applies to the real world.\nString theory is interesting to scientists because it is currently the only approach that seems to have the\n3\npotential of combining all four forces to produce what physicists have termed the Theory of Everything.\nTheories of the earliest phases of the universe must take both quantum mechanics and gravity into account,\nbut at the simplest level, gravity and quantum mechanics are incompatible. General relativity, our best theory\nof gravity, says that the motions of objects can be predicted exactly. Quantum mechanics says you can only\ncalculate the probability (chance) that an object will do something. String theory is an attempt to resolve this\nparadox. The mathematics that underpins string theory is elegant and beautiful, but it remains to be seen\nwhether it will make predictions that can be tested by observations in yet-to-be-developed, high-energy\naccelerators on Earth or by observations of the early universe.\nThe earliest period in the history of the universe from time zero to 10\u201343second is called thePlanck time. The\nuniverse was unimaginably hot and dense, and theorists believe that at this time, quantum effects of gravity\ndominated physical interactions\u2014and, as we have just discussed, we have no tested theory of quantum\ngravity. Inflation is hypothesized to have occurred somewhat later, when the universe was between perhaps\n10\u201335and 10\u201333second old and the temperature was 1027to 1028K. This rapid expansion took place when three\nforces (electromagnetic, strong, and weak) are thought to have been unified, and this is when GUTs are\napplicable.\nAfter inflation, the universe continued to expand (but more slowly) and to cool. An important milestone was\nreached when the temperature was down to 1015K and the universe was 10\u201310second old. Under these\nconditions, all four forces were separate and distinct. High-energy particle accelerators can achieve similar\nconditions, and so theories of the history of the universe from this point on have a sound basis in experiments.\nAs yet, we have no direct evidence of what the conditions were during the inflationary epoch, and the ideas\npresented here are speculative. Researchers are trying to devise some experimental tests. For example, the\nquantum fluctuations in the very early universe would have caused variations in density and produced\ngravitational waves that may have left a detectable imprint on the CMB. Detection of such an imprint will\nrequire observations with equipment whose sensitivity is improved from what we have today. Ultimately,\nhowever, it may provide confirmation that we live in a universe that once experienced an epoch of rapid\ninflation.\nIf you are typical of the students who read this book, you may have found this brief discussion of dark matter,\ninflation, and cosmology a bit frustrating. We have offered glimpses of theories and observations, but have\nraised more questions than we have answered. What is dark matter? What is dark energy? Inflation explains\nthe observations of flatness and uniformity of the university, but did it actually happen? These ideas are at the\nforefront of modern science, where progress almost always leads to new puzzles, and much more work is\nneeded before we can see clearly. Bear in mind that less than a century has passed since Hubble\ndemonstrated the existence of other galaxies. The quest to understand just how the universe of galaxies came\nto be will keep astronomers busy for a long time to come.\n29.7 The Anthropic Principle\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nName some properties of the universe that, if different, would have precluded the development of\nhumans\n3 This name became the title of a film about physicist Stephen Hawking in 2014.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29.7 \u2022 The Anthropic Principle 1017\nDespite our uncertainties, we must admit that the picture we have developed about the evolution of our\nuniverse is a remarkable one. With new telescopes, we have begun to collect enough observational evidence\nthat we can describe how the universe evolved from a mere fraction of a second after the expansion began.\nAlthough this is an impressive achievement, there are still some characteristics of the universe that we cannot\nexplain. And yet, it turns out that if these characteristics were any different, we would not be here to ask about\nthem. Let\u2019s look at some of these \u201clucky accidents,\u201d beginning with the observations of the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB).\nLucky Accidents\nAs we described in this chapter, the CMB is radiation that was emitted when the universe was a few hundred\nthousand years old. Observations show that the temperature of the radiation varies from one region to\nanother, typically by about 10 millionths of a degree, and these temperature differences signal small\ndifferences in density. But suppose the tiny, early fluctuations in density had been much smaller. Then\ncalculations show that the pull of gravity near them would have been so small that no galaxies would ever\nhave formed.\nWhat if the fluctuations in density had been much larger? Then it is possible that very dense regions would\nhave condensed, and these would simply have collapsed directly to black holes without ever forming galaxies\nand stars. Even if galaxies had been able to form in such a universe, space would have been filled with intense\nX-rays and gamma rays, and it would have been difficult for life forms to develop and survive. The density of\nstars within galaxies would be so high that interactions and collisions among them would be frequent. In such\na universe, any planetary systems could rarely survive long enough for life to develop.\nSo for us to be here, the density fluctuations need to be \u201cjust right\u201d\u2014not too big and not too small.\nAnother lucky accident is that the universe is finely balanced between expansion and contraction. It is\nexpanding, but very slowly. If the expansion had been at a much higher rate, all of the matter would have\nthinned out before galaxies could form. If everything were expanding at a much slower rate, then gravity\nwould have \u201cwon.\u201d The expansion would have reversed and all of the matter would have recollapsed, probably\ninto a black hole\u2014again, no stars, no planets, no life.\nThe development of life on Earth depends on still-luckier coincidences. Had matter andantimatterbeen\npresent initially in exactly equal proportions, then all matter would have been annihilated and turned into pure\nenergy. We owe our existence to the fact that there was slightly more matter than antimatter. (After most of\nthe matter made contact with an equal amount of antimatter, turning into energy, a small amount of\nadditional matter must have been present. We are all descendants of that bit of \u201cunbalanced\u201d matter.)\nIf nuclear fusion reactions occurred at a somewhat faster rate than they actually do, then at the time of the\ninitial fireball, all of the matter would have been converted from hydrogen into helium into carbon and all the\nway into iron (the most stable nucleus). That would mean that no stars would have formed, since the existence\nof stars depends on there being light elements that can undergo fusion in the main-sequence stage and make\nthe stars shine. In addition, the structure of atomic nuclei had to be just right to make it possible for three\nhelium atoms to come together easily to fuse carbon, which is the basis of life. If thetriple-alpha processwe\ndiscussed in the chapter onStars from Adolescence to Old Agewere too unlikely, not enough carbon would\nhave formed to lead to biology as we know it. At the same time, it had to be hard enough to fuse carbon into\noxygen that a large amount of carbon survived for billions of years.\nThere are additional factors that have contributed to life like us being possible. Neutrinos have to interact with\nmatter at just the right, albeit infrequent, rate. Supernova explosions occur whenneutrinos escape from the\ncores of collapsing stars, deposit some of their energy in the surrounding stellar envelope, and cause it to\nblow out and away into space. The heavy elements that are ejected in such explosions are essential\ningredients of life here on Earth. If neutrinos did not interact with matter at all, they would escape from the\ncores of collapsing stars without causing the explosion. If neutrinos interacted strongly with matter, they 1018 29 \u2022 The Big Bang\nwould remain trapped in the stellar core. In either case, the heavy elements would remain locked up inside the\ncollapsing star.\nIf gravity were a much stronger force than it is, stars could form with much smaller masses, and their lifetimes\nwould be measured in years rather than billions of years. Chemical processes, on the other hand, would not be\nsped up if gravity were a stronger force, and so there would be no time for life to develop while stars were so\nshort-lived. Even if life did develop in a stronger-gravity universe, life forms would have to be tiny or they could\nnot stand up or move around.\nWhat Had to Be, Had to Be\nIn summary, we see that a specific set of rules and conditions in the universe has allowed complexity and life\non Earth to develop. As yet, we have no theory to explain why this \u201cright\u201d set of conditions occurred. For this\nreason, many scientists are beginning to accept an idea we call theanthropic principle\u2014namely, that the\nphysical laws we observe must be what they are precisely because these are the only laws that allow for the\nexistence of humans.\nSome scientists speculate that our universe is but one of countless universes, each with a different set of\nphysical laws\u2014an idea that is sometimes referred to as themultiverse. Some of those universes might be\nstillborn, collapsing before any structure forms. Others may expand so quickly that they remain essentially\nfeatureless with no stars and galaxies. In other words, there may be a much larger multiverse that contains\nour own universe and many others. This multiverse (existing perhaps in more dimensions that we can become\naware of) is infinite and eternal; it generates many, many inflating regions, each of which evolves into a\nseparate universe, which may be completely unlike any of the other separate universes. Our universe is then\nthe way it is because it is the only way it could be and have humans like ourselves in it to discover its\nproperties and ask such questions.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nView the2011 introductory talk(https://openstax.org/l/30mulcosinfla)on the Multiverse and Cosmic\nInflation by Dr. Anthony Aguirre of the University of California, part of the Silicon Valley Astronomy Lecture\nSeries.\nIt is difficult to know how to test these ideas since we can never make contact with any other universe. For\nmost scientists, our discussion in this section borders on the philosophical and metaphysical. Perhaps in the\nfuture our understanding of physics will develop to the point that we can know why the gravitational constant\nis as strong as it is, why the universe is expanding at exactly the rate it is, and why all of the other \u201clucky\naccidents\u201d happened\u2014why they were inevitable and could be no other way. Then this anthropic idea would no\nlonger be necessary. No one knows, however, whether we will ever have an explanation for why this universe\nworks the way it does.\nWe have come a long way in our voyage through the universe.

The universe is expanding, and this\nis one of the key observational starting points for modern cosmological theories. Modern observations show\nthat the rate of expansion has not been constant throughout the life of the universe. Initially, when galaxies\nwere close together, the effects of gravity were stronger than the effects of dark energy, and the expansion\nrate gradually slowed. As galaxies moved farther apart, the influence of gravity on the expansion rate\nweakened. Measurements of distant supernovae show that when the universe was about half its current age,\ndark energy began to dominate the rate of expansion and caused it to speed up. In order to estimate the age\nof the universe, we must allow for changes in the rate of expansion. After allowing for these effects, 1020 29 \u2022 Summary\nastronomers estimate that all of the matter within the observable universe was concentrated in an extremely\nsmall volume 13.8 billion years ago, a time we call the Big Bang.\n29.2A Model of the Universe\nFor describing the large-scale properties of the universe, a model that is isotropic and homogeneous (same\neverywhere) is a pretty good approximation of reality. The universe is expanding, which means that the\nuniverse undergoes a change in scale with time; space stretches and distances grow larger by the same factor\neverywhere at a given time. Observations show that the mass density of the universe is less than the critical\ndensity. In other words, there is not enough matter in the universe to stop the expansion. With the discovery\nof dark energy, which is accelerating the rate of expansion, the observational evidence is strong that the\nuniverse will expand forever. Observations tell us that the expansion started about 13.8 billion years ago.\n29.3The Beginning of the Universe\nLema\u00eetre, Alpher, and Gamow first worked out the ideas that are today called the Big Bang theory. The\nuniverse cools as it expands. The energy of photons is determined by their temperature, and calculations show\nthat in the hot, early universe, photons had so much energy that when they collided with one another, they\ncould produce material particles. As the universe expanded and cooled, protons and neutrons formed first,\nthen came electrons and positrons. Next, fusion reactions produced deuterium, helium, and lithium nuclei.\nMeasurements of the deuterium abundance in today\u2019s universe show that the total amount of ordinary matter\nin the universe is only about 5% of the critical density.\n29.4The Cosmic Microwave Background\nWhen the universe became cool enough to form neutral hydrogen atoms, the universe became transparent to\nradiation. Scientists have detected the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation from this time during\nthe hot, early universe. Measurements with the COBE satellite show that the CMB acts like a blackbody with a\ntemperature of 2.73 K. Tiny fluctuations in the CMB show us the seeds of large-scale structures in the universe.\nDetailed measurements of these fluctuations show that we live in a critical-density universe and that the\ncritical density is composed of 31% matter, including dark matter, and 69% dark energy. Ordinary matter\u2014the\nkinds of elementary particles we find on Earth\u2014make up only about 5% of the critical density. CMB\nmeasurements also indicate that the universe is 13.8 billion years old.\n29.5What Is the Universe Really Made Of?\nTwenty-seven percent of the critical density of the universe is composed of dark matter. To explain so much\ndark matter, some physics theories predict that additional types of particles should exist. One type has been\ngiven the name of WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles), and scientists are now conducting\nexperiments to try to detect them in the laboratory. Dark matter plays an essential role in forming galaxies.\nSince, by definition, these particles interact only very weakly (if at all) with radiation, they could have\ncongregated while the universe was still very hot and filled with radiation. They would thus have formed\ngravitational traps that quickly attracted and concentrated ordinary matter after the universe became\ntransparent, and matter and radiation decoupled. This rapid concentration of matter enabled galaxies to form\nby the time the universe was only 400\u2013500 million years old.\n29.6The Inflationary Universe\nThe Big Bang model does not explain why the CMB has the same temperature in all directions. Neither does it\nexplain why the density of the universe is so close to critical density. These observations can be explained if\nthe universe experienced a period of rapid expansion, which scientists call inflation, about 10\u201335second after\nthe Big Bang. New grand unified theories (GUTs) are being developed to describe physical processes in the\nuniverse before and at the time that inflation occurred.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29 \u2022 For Further Exploration 1021\n29.7The Anthropic Principle\nRecently, many cosmologists have noted that the existence of humans depends on the fact that many\nproperties of the universe\u2014the size of density fluctuations in the early universe, the strength of gravity, the\nstructure of atoms\u2014were just right. The idea that physical laws must be the way they are because otherwise\nwe could not be here to measure them is called the anthropic principle. Some scientists speculate that there\nmay be a multiverse of universes, in which ours is just one.\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nThe January 2021 issue ofAstronomymagazine is devoted to our modern understanding of the beginning and\nend of the universe.\nKruesi, L. \u201cCosmology: 5 Things You Need to Know.\u201dAstronomy(May 2007): 28.

Some belief systems teach us that there are\nquestions to which \u201cwe were not meant to know\u201d the answers. Other people feel that if our minds and\ninstruments are capable of exploring a question, then it becomes part of our birthright as thinking human\nbeings. Have your group discuss your personal reactions to discussing questions like the beginning of\ntime and space, and the ultimate fate of the universe. Does it make you nervous to hear about scientists\ndiscussing these issues? Or is it exciting to know that we can now gather scientific evidence about the\norigin and fate of the cosmos? (In discussing this, you may find that members of your group strongly\ndisagree; try to be respectful of others\u2019 points of view.)\nB. A popular model of the universe in the 1950s and 1960s was the so-called steady-state cosmology. In this\nmodel, the universe was not only the same everywhere and in all directions (homogeneous and isotropic),\nbut also the sameat all times. We know the universe is expanding and the galaxies are thinning out, and\nso this model hypothesized that new matter was continually coming into existence to fill in the space\nbetween galaxies as they moved farther apart. If so, the infinite universe did not have to have a sudden\nbeginning, but could simply exist forever in a steady state. Have your group discuss your reaction to this\nmodel. Do you find it more appealing philosophically than the Big Bang model? Can you cite some\nevidence that indicates that the universe was not the same billions of years ago as it is now\u2014that it is not\nin a steady state?\nAccess for free at openstax.org 29 \u2022 Exercises 1023\nC. One of the lucky accidents that characterizes our universe is the fact that the time scale for the\ndevelopment of intelligent life on Earth and the lifetime of the Sun are comparable. Have your group\ndiscuss what would happen if the two time scales were very different. Suppose, for example, that the time\nfor intelligent life to evolve was 10 times greater than the main-sequence lifetime of the Sun. Would our\ncivilization have ever developed? Now suppose the time for intelligent life to evolve is ten times shorter\nthan the main-sequence lifetime of the Sun. Would we be around? (This latter discussion requires\nconsiderable thought, including such ideas as what the early stages in the Sun\u2019s life were like and how\nmuch the early Earth was bombarded by asteroids and comets.)\nD.

Suppose the Hubble constant were not 22 but 33 km/s per million light-years. Then what would the critical\ndensity be?\n24. Assume that the average galaxy contains 1011M and that the average distance between galaxies is 10\nSun\nmillion light-years. Calculate the average density of matter (mass per unit volume) in galaxies. What\nfraction is this of the critical density we calculated in the chapter?\n25. The CMB contains roughly 400 million photons per m3. The energy of each photon depends on its\nwavelength. Calculate the typical wavelength of a CMB photon. Hint: The CMB is blackbody radiation at a\ntemperature of 2.73 K. According to Wien\u2019s law, the peak wave length in nanometers is given by\nCalculate the wavelength at which the CMB is a maximum and, to make the units\nconsistent, convert this wavelength from nanometers to meters.\n26. Following up onExercise 29.25calculate the energy of a typical photon. Assume for this approximate\ncalculation that each photon has the wavelength calculated inExercise 29.25. The energy of a photon is\ngiven by wherehis Planck\u2019s constant and is equal to 6.626 \u00d7 10\u201334J \u00d7 s,cis the speed of light in\nm/s, and \u03bb is the wavelength in m.\n27. Continuing the thinking inExercise 29.25andExercise 29.26, calculate the energy in a cubic meter of\nspace, multiply the energy per photon calculated inExercise 29.26by the number of photons per cubic\nmeter given above.\n28. Continuing the thinking in the last three exercises, convert this energy to an equivalent in mass, use\nEinstein\u2019s equationE=mc2. Hint: Divide the energy per m3calculated inExercise 29.27by the speed of\nlight squared. Check your units; you should have an answer in kg/m3. Now compare this answer with the\ncritical density. Your answer should be several powers of 10 smaller than the critical density. In other\nwords, you have found for yourself that the contribution of the CMB photons to the overall density of the\nuniverse is much, much smaller than the contribution made by stars and galaxies.\n29. There is still some uncertainty in the Hubble constant. (a) Current estimates range from about 19.9 km/s\nper million light-years to 23 km/s per million light-years. Assume that the Hubble constant has been\nconstant since the Big Bang. What is the possible range in the ages of the universe? Use the equation in\nthe text, and make sure you use consistent units. (b) Twenty years ago, estimates for the Hubble\nconstant ranged from 50 to 100 km/s per Mps. What are the possible ages for the universe from those\nvalues? Can you rule out some of these possibilities on the basis of other evidence?\n30. It is possible to derive the age of the universe given the value of the Hubble constant and the distance to a\ngalaxy, again with the assumption that the value of the Hubble constant has not changed since the Big\nBang. Consider a galaxy at a distance of 400 million light-years receding from us at a velocity,v. If the\nHubble constant is 20 km/s per million light-years, what is its velocity? How long ago was that galaxy right\nnext door to our own Galaxy if it has always been receding at its present rate? Express your answer in\nyears. Since the universe began when all galaxies were very close together, this number is a rough\nestimate for the age of the universe. 1026 29 \u2022 Exercises\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30 \u2022 Thinking Ahead 1027\n30\nLife in the Universe\nFigure30.1Astrobiology: The Road to Life in the Universe.In this fanciful montage produced by a NASA artist, we see one\nroadmap for discovering life in the universe.

Learning more about the origin, evolution, and properties of life on Earth aids us in searching for\nevidence of all kinds of life beyond that on our planet. 1028 30 \u2022 Life in the Universe\n30.1 The Cosmic Context for Life\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nDescribe the chemical and environmental conditions that make Earth hospitable to life\nDiscuss the assumption underlying the Copernican principle and outline its implications for modern-day\nastronomers\nUnderstand the questions underlying the Fermi paradox\nWe saw that the universe was born in the Big Bang about 14 billion years ago. After the initial hot, dense\nfireball of creation cooled sufficiently for atoms to exist, all matter consisted of hydrogen and helium (with a\nvery small amount of lithium). As the universe aged, processes within stars created the other elements,\nincluding those that make up Earth (such as iron, silicon, magnesium, and oxygen) and those required for life\nas we know it, such as carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. These and other elements combined in space to produce\na wide variety of compounds that form the basis of life on Earth. In particular, life on Earth is based on the\npresence of a key unit known as anorganic molecule, a molecule that contains carbon. Especially important\nare the hydrocarbons, chemical compounds made up entirely of hydrogen and carbon, which serve as the\nbasis for our biological chemistry, orbiochemistry. While we do not understand the details of how life on Earth\nbegan, it is clear that to make creatures like us possible, events like the ones we described must have\noccurred, resulting in what is called thechemical evolutionof the universe.\nWhat Made Earth Hospitable to Life?\nAbout 5 billion years ago, a cloud of gas and dust in this cosmic neighborhood began to collapse under its own\nweight. Out of this cloud formed the Sun and its planets, together with all the smaller bodies, such as comets,\nthat also orbit the Sun (Figure 30.2). The third planet from the Sun, as it cooled, eventually allowed the\nformation of large quantities of liquid water on its surface.\nFigure30.2Comet Hyakutake.This image was captured in 1996 by NASA photographer Bill Ingalls. Comet impacts can deliver both\nwater and a variety of interesting chemicals, including some organic chemicals, to Earth. (credit: NASA/Bill Ingalls)\nThe chemical variety and moderate conditions on Earth eventually led to the formation of molecules that could\nmake copies of themselves (reproduce), which is essential for beginning life. Over the billions of years of Earth\nhistory, life evolved and became more complex. The course of evolution was punctuated by occasional planet-\nwide changes caused by collisions with some of the smaller bodies that did not make it into the Sun or one of\nits accompanying worlds. As we saw in the chapter onEarth as a Planet, mammals may owe their domination\nof Earth\u2019s surface to just such a collision 65 million years ago, which led to the extinction of the dinosaurs\n(along with the majority of other living things). The details of such mass extinctions are currently the focus of a\ngreat deal of scientific interest.\nThrough many twisting turns, the course of evolution on Earth produced a creature with self-consciousness,\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30.1 \u2022 The Cosmic Context for Life 1029\nable to ask questions about its own origins and place in the cosmos (Figure 30.3). Like most of Earth, this\ncreature is composed of atoms that were forged in earlier generations of stars\u2014in this case, assembled into\nboth its body and brain. We might say that through the thoughts of human beings, the matter in the universe\ncan become aware of itself.\nFigure30.3Young Human.Human beings have the intellect to wonder about their planet and what lies beyond it. Through them\n(and perhaps other intelligent life), the universe becomes aware of itself. (credit: Andrew Fraknoi)\nThink about those atoms in your body for a minute. They are merely on loan to you from the lending library of\natoms that make up our local corner of the universe. Atoms of many kinds circulate through your body and\nthen leave it\u2014with each breath you inhale and exhale and the food you eat and excrete. Even the atoms that\ntake up more permanent residence in your tissues will not be part of you much longer than you are alive.\nUltimately, you will return your atoms to the vast reservoir of Earth, where they will be incorporated into other\nstructures and even other living things in the millennia to come.\nThis picture ofcosmic evolution, of our descent from the stars, has been obtained through the efforts of\nscientists in many fields over many decades. Some of its details are still tentative and incomplete, but we feel\nreasonably confident in its broad outlines. It is remarkable how much we have been able to learn in the short\ntime we have had the instruments to probe the physical nature of the universe.\nThe Copernican Principle\nOur study of astronomy has taught us that we have always been wrong in the past whenever we have claimed\nthat Earth is somehow unique. Galileo, using the newly invented technology of the telescope, showed us that\nEarth is not the center of the solar system, but merely one of a number of objects orbiting the Sun. Our study\nof the stars has demonstrated that the Sun itself is a rather undistinguished star, halfway through its long\nmain-sequence stage like so many billions of others. There seems nothing special about our position in the\nMilky Way Galaxy either, and nothing surprising about our Galaxy\u2019s position in either its own group or its\nsupercluster.\nThe discovery of planets around other stars confirms our idea that the formation of planets is a natural\nconsequence of the formation of stars. We have identified thousands of exoplanets\u2014planets orbiting around\nother stars, from huge ones orbiting close to their stars (informally called \u201chot Jupiters\u201d) down to planets\nsmaller than Earth. A steady stream of exoplanet discoveries is leading to the conclusion that earthlike planets\noccur frequently\u2014enough that there are likely many billions of \u201cexo-Earths\u201d in our own Milky Way Galaxy\nalone. From a planetary perspective, Earth-size planets are not unusual.\nPhilosophers of science sometimes call the idea that there is nothing special about our place in the universe\ntheCopernican principle. Given all of the above, most scientists would be surprised if life were limited to our\nplanet and had started nowhere else. There are billions of stars in our Galaxy old enough for life to have\ndeveloped on a planet around them, and there are billions of other galaxies as well. Astronomers and 1030 30 \u2022 Life in the Universe\nbiologists have long conjectured that a series of events similar to those on the early Earth probably led to\nliving organisms on many planets around other stars, and possibly even on other planets in our solar system,\nsuch as Mars.\nThe real scientific issue (which we do not currently know the answer to) is whether organic biochemistry is\nlikely or unlikely in the universe at large. Are we a fortunate and exceedingly rare outcome of chemical\nevolution, or is organic biochemistry a regular part of the chemical evolution of the cosmos? We do not yet\nknow the answer to this question, but data, even an exceedingly small amount (like finding \u201cunrelated to us\u201d\nliving systems on a world like Europa), will help us arrive at it.\nSo Where Are They?\nIf theCopernican principleis applied to life, then biology may be rather common among planets. Taken to its\nlogical limit, the Copernican principle also suggests that intelligent life like us might be common. Intelligence\nlike ours has some very special properties, including an ability to make progress through the application of\ntechnology. Organic life around other (older) stars may have started a billion years earlier than we did on\nEarth, so they may have had a lot more time to develop advanced technology such as sending information,\nprobes, or even life-forms between stars.\nFaced with such a prospect, physicist EnricoFermiasked a question several decades ago that is now called the\nFermi paradox: where are they? If life and intelligence are common and have such tremendous capacity for\ngrowth, why is there not a network of galactic civilizations whose presence extends even into a \u201clatecomer\u201d\nplanetary system like ours?\nSeveral solutions have been suggested to theFermi paradox. Perhaps life is common but intelligence (or at\nleast technological civilization) is rare. Perhaps such a network will come about in the future but has not yet\nhad the time to develop. Maybe there are invisible streams of data flowing past us all the time that we are not\nadvanced enough or sensitive enough to detect. Maybe advanced species make it a practice not to interfere\nwith immature, developing consciousness such as our own. Or perhaps civilizations that reach a certain level\nof technology then self-destruct, meaning there are no other civilizations now existing in our Galaxy. We do\nnot yet know whether any advanced life is out there and, if it is, why we are not aware of it. Still, you might\nwant to keep these issues in mind as you read the rest of this chapter.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nIs there a network of galactic civilizations beyond our solar system?

You may also sometimes hear this field\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30.2 \u2022 Astrobiology 1031\nreferred to asexobiologyorbioastronomy.Astrobiology brings together astronomers, planetary scientists,\nchemists, geologists, and biologists (among others) to work on the same problems from their various\nperspectives.\nAmong the issues that astrobiologists explore are the conditions in which life arose on Earth and the reasons\nfor the extraordinary adaptability of life on our planet. They are also involved in identifying habitable worlds\nbeyond Earth and in trying to understand in practical terms how to look for life on those worlds. Let\u2019s look at\nsome of these issues in more detail.\nThe Building Blocks of Life\nWhile no unambiguous evidence for life has yet been found anywhere beyond Earth, life\u2019s chemical building\nblocks have been detected in a wide range of extraterrestrial environments. Meteorites (which you learned\nabout inCosmic Samples and the Origin of the Solar System) have been found to contain two kinds of\nsubstances whose chemical structures mark them as having an extraterrestrial origin\u2014amino acids and\nsugars.Amino acidsareorganic compoundsthat are the molecular building blocks of proteins.Proteinsare\nkey biological molecules that provide the structure and function of the body\u2019s tissues and organs and\nessentially carry out the \u201cwork\u201d of the cell. When we examine the gas and dust around comets, we also find a\nnumber of organic molecules\u2014compounds that on Earth are associated with the chemistry of life.\nExpanding beyond our solar system, one of the most interesting results of modern radio astronomy has been\nthe discovery of organic molecules in giant clouds of gas and dust between stars. More than 100 different\nmolecules have been identified in these reservoirs of cosmic raw material, including formaldehyde, alcohol,\nand others we know as important stepping stones in the development of life on Earth. Using radio telescopes\nand radio spectrometers, astronomers can measure the abundances of various chemicals in these clouds. We\nfind organic molecules most readily in regions where the interstellar dust is most abundant, and it turns out\nthese are precisely the regions where star formation (and probably planet formation) happen most easily\n(Figure 30.4).\nFigure30.4Cloud of Gas and Dust.This cloud of gas and dust in the constellation of Scorpius is the sort of region where complex\nmolecules are found. It is also the sort of cloud where new stars form from the reservoir of gas and dust in the cloud. Radiation from\na group of hot stars (off the picture to the bottom left) called the Scorpius OB Association is \u201ceating into\u201d the cloud, sweeping it into\nan elongated shape and causing the reddish glow seen at its tip. (credit: Dr. Robert Gendler)\nClearly the early Earth itself produced some of the molecular building blocks of life. Since the early 1950s,\nscientists have tried to duplicate in their laboratories the chemical pathways that led to life on our planet. In a\nseries of experiments known as theMiller-Urey experiments, pioneered by StanleyMillerand HaroldUreyat 1032 30 \u2022 Life in the Universe\nthe University of Chicago, biochemists have simulated conditions on early Earth and have been able to\nproduce some of the fundamental building blocks of life, including those that form proteins and other large\nbiological molecules known as nucleic acids (which we will discuss shortly).\nAlthough these experiments produced encouraging results, there are some problems with them. The most\ninteresting chemistry from a biological perspective takes place with hydrogen-rich orreducinggases, such as\nammonia and methane. However, the early atmosphere of Earth was probably dominated by carbon dioxide\n(as Venus\u2019 and Mars\u2019 atmospheres still are today) and may not have contained an abundance of reducing\ngases comparable to that used inMiller-Ureytype experiments. Hydrothermal vents\u2014seafloor systems in\nwhich ocean water is superheated and circulated through crustal or mantle rocks before reemerging into the\nocean\u2014have also been suggested as potential contributors of organic compounds on the early Earth, and\nsuch sources would not require Earth to have an early reducing atmosphere.\nBoth earthly and extraterrestrial sources may have contributed to Earth\u2019s early supply of organic molecules,\nalthough we have more direct evidence for the latter. It is even conceivable that life itself originated elsewhere\nand was seeded onto our planet\u2014although this, of course, does not solve the problem of how that life\noriginated to begin with.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nHydrothermal vents are beginning to seem more likely as early contributors to the organic compounds\nfound on Earth. Read about hydrothermal vents and watch videos and slideshows on these and other deep-\nsea wonders at theWoods Hole Oceanographic Institution(https://openstax.org/l/30wohooceins)website.\nTry an interactive simulation of hydrothermal-vent circulation at theDive and Discover\n(https://openstax.org/l/30divediscover)website.\nThe Origin and Early Evolution of Life\nThe carbon compounds that form the chemical basis of life may be common in the universe, but it is still a\ngiant step from these building blocks to a living cell. Even the simplest molecules of thegenes(the basic\nfunctional units that carry the genetic, or hereditary, material in a cell) contain millions of molecular units,\neach arranged in a precise sequence. Furthermore, even the most primitive life required two special\ncapabilities: a means of extracting energy from its environment, and a means of encoding and replicating\ninformation in order to make faithful copies of itself. Biologists today can see ways that either of these\ncapabilities might have formed in a natural environment, but we are still a long way from knowing how the\ntwo came together in the first life-forms.\nWe have no solid evidence for the pathway that led to the origin of life on our planet except for whatever early\nhistory may be retained in the biochemistry of modern life. Indeed, we have very little direct evidence of what\nEarth itself was like during its earliest history\u2014our planet is so effective at resurfacing itself through plate\ntectonics (see the chapter onEarth as a Planet) that very few rocks remain from this early period. In the earlier\nchapter onCratered Worlds, you learned that Earth was subjected to a heavy bombardment\u2014a period of large\nimpact events\u2014some 3.8 to 4.1 billion years ago. Large impacts would have been energetic enough to heat-\nsterilize the surface layers of Earth, so that even if life had begun by this time, it might well have been wiped\nout.\nWhen the large impacts ceased, the scene was set for a more peaceful environment on our planet. If the\noceans of Earth contained accumulated organic material from any of the sources already mentioned, the\ningredients were available to make living organisms. We do not understand in any detail the sequence of\nevents that led from molecules to biology, but there is fossil evidence of microbial life in 3.5-billion-year-old\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30.2 \u2022 Astrobiology 1033\nrocks, and possible (debated) evidence for life as far back as 3.8 billion years.\nLife as we know it employs two main molecular systems: the functional molecules known as proteins, which\ncarry out the chemical work of the cell, and information-containing molecules ofDNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)\nthat store information about how to create the cell and its chemical and structural components. The origin of\nlife is sometimes considered a \u201cchicken and egg problem\u201d because, in modern biology, neither of these\nsystems works without the other. It is our proteins that assemble DNA strands in the precise order required to\nstore information, but the proteins are created based on information stored in DNA. Which came first? Some\norigin of life researchers believe that prebiotic chemistry was based on molecules that could both store\ninformation and do the chemical work of the cell. It has been suggested thatRNA (ribonucleic acid), a\nmolecule that aids in the flow of genetic information from DNA to proteins, might have served such a purpose.\nThe idea of an early \u201cRNA world\u201d has become increasingly accepted, but a great deal remains to be\nunderstood about the origin of life.\nPerhaps the most important innovation in the history of biology, apart from the origin of life itself, was the\ndiscovery of the process ofphotosynthesis, the complex sequence of chemical reactions through which some\nliving things can use sunlight to manufacture products that store energy (such as carbohydrates), releasing\noxygen as one by-product. Previously, life had to make do with sources of chemical energy available on Earth\nor delivered from space. But the abundant energy available in sunlight could support a larger and more\nproductive biosphere, as well as some biochemical reactions not previously possible for life. One of these was\nthe production of oxygen (as a waste product) from carbon dioxide, and the increase in atmospheric levels of\noxygen about 2.4 billion years ago means that oxygen-producing photosynthesis must have emerged and\nbecome globally important by this time. In fact, it is likely that oxygen-producing photosynthesis emerged\nconsiderably earlier.\nSome forms of chemical evidence contained in ancient rocks, such as the solid, layered rock formations known\nasstromatolites, are thought to be the fossils of oxygen-producing photosynthetic bacteria in rocks that are\nalmost 3.5 billion years old (Figure 30.5). It is generally thought that a simpler form of photosynthesis that\ndoes not produce oxygen (and is still used by some bacteria today) probably preceded oxygen-producing\nphotosynthesis, and there is strong fossil evidence that one or the other type of photosynthesis was\nfunctioning on Earth at least as far back as 3.4 billion years ago.\nFigure30.5Stromatolites Preserve the Earliest Physical Representation of Life on Earth.In their reach for sunlight, the single-\ncelled microbes formed mats that trapped sediments in the water above them. Such trapped sediments fell and formed layers on\ntop of the mats. The microbes then climbed atop the sediment layers and trapped more sediment. What is found in the rock record\nare (a) the solidified, curved sedimentary layers that are signatures of biological activity. The earliest known stromatolite is 3.47\nbillion years old and is found in Western Australia. (b) This more recent example is in Lake Thetis, also in Western Australia. (credit a:\nmodification of work by James St. John; credit b: modification of work by Ruth Ellison)\nThe free oxygen produced by photosynthesis began accumulating in our atmosphere about 2.4 billion years\nago. The interaction of sunlight with oxygen can produce ozone (which has three atoms of oxygen per\nmolecule, as compared to the two atoms per molecule in the oxygen we breathe), which accumulated in a 1034 30 \u2022 Life in the Universe\nlayer high in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. As it does on Earth today, this ozone provided protection from the Sun\u2019s\ndamaging ultraviolet radiation. This allowed life to colonize the landmasses of our planet instead of remaining\nonly in the ocean.\nThe rise in oxygen levels was deadly to some microbes because, as a highly reactive chemical, it can\nirreversibly damage some of the biomolecules that early life had developed in the absence of oxygen. For\nother microbes, it was a boon: combining oxygen with organic matter or other reduced chemicals generates a\nlot of energy\u2014you can see this when a log burns, for example\u2014and many forms of life adopted this way of\nliving. This new energy source made possible a great proliferation of organisms, which continued to evolve in\nan oxygen-rich environment.\nThe details of that evolution are properly the subject of biology courses, but the process of evolution by\nnatural selection (survival of the fittest) provides a clear explanation for the development of Earth\u2019s\nremarkable variety of life-forms. It does not, however, directly solve the mystery of life\u2019s earliest beginnings.\nWe hypothesize that life will arise whenever conditions are appropriate, but this hypothesis is just another\nform of the Copernican principle. We now have the potential to address this hypothesis with observations. If a\nsecond example of life is found in our solar system or a nearby star, it would imply that life emerges\ncommonly enough that the universe is likely filled with biology. To make such observations, however, we must\nfirst decide where to focus our search.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nJust how did life arise in the first place? And could it have happened with a different type of chemistry?\nWatch the 15-minute videoMaking Matter Come Alive(https://openstax.org/l/30makmattcomali)in which a\nchemistry expert explores some answers to these questions, from a 2011 TED Talk.\nHabitable Environments\nAmong the staggering number of objects in our solar system, Galaxy, and universe, some may have conditions\nsuitable for life, while others do not. Understanding what conditions and features make ahabitable\nenvironment\u2014an environment capable of hosting life\u2014is important both for understanding how widespread\nhabitable environments may be in the universe and for focusing a search for life beyond Earth. Here, we\ndiscuss habitability from the perspective of the life we know. We will explore the basic requirements of life and,\nin the following section, consider the full range of environmental conditions on Earth where life is found. While\nwe can\u2019t entirely rule out the possibility that other life-forms might have biochemistry based on alternatives to\ncarbon and liquid water, such life \u201cas we don\u2019t know it\u201d is still completely speculative. In our discussion here,\nwe are focusing on habitability for life that is chemically similar to that on Earth.\nLife requires a solvent (a liquid in which chemicals can dissolve) that enables the construction of biomolecules\nand the interactions between them. For life as we know it, that solvent is water, which has a variety of\nproperties that are critical to how our biochemistry works. Water is abundant in the universe, but life requires\nthat water be in liquid form (rather than ice or gas) in order to properly fill its role in biochemistry. That is the\ncase only within a certain range of temperatures and pressures\u2014too high or too low in either variable, and\nwater takes the form of a solid or a gas. Identifying environments where water is present within the\nappropriate range of temperature and pressure is thus an important first step in identifying habitable\nenvironments. Indeed, a \u201cfollow the water\u201d strategy has been, and continues to be, a key driver in the\nexploration of planets both within and beyond our solar system.\nOur biochemistry is based on molecules made of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.\nCarbon is at the core of organic chemistry. Its ability to form four bonds, both with itself and with the other\nelements of life, allows for the formation of a vast number of potential molecules on which to base\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30.2 \u2022 Astrobiology 1035\nbiochemistry. The remaining elements contribute structure and chemical reactivity to our biomolecules, and\nform the basis of many of the interactions among them. These \u201cbiogenic elements,\u201d sometimes referred to\nwith the acronymCHNOPS(carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur), are the raw\nmaterials from which life is assembled, and an accessible supply of them is a second requirement of\nhabitability.\nAs we learned in previous chapters on nuclear fusion and the life story of the stars, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen,\nphosphorus, and sulfur are all formed by fusion within stars and then distributed out into their galaxy as those\nstars die. But how they are distributed among the planets that form within a new star system, in what form,\nand how chemical, physical, and geological processes on those planets cycle the elements into structures that\nare accessible to biology, can have significant impacts on the distribution of life. In Earth\u2019s oceans, for\nexample, the abundance of phytoplankton (simple organisms that are the base of the ocean food chain) in\nsurface waters can vary by a thousand-fold because the supply of nitrogen differs from place to place (Figure\n30.6). Understanding what processes control the accessibility of elements at all scales is thus a critical part of\nidentifying habitable environments.\nFigure30.6Chlorophyll Abundance.The abundance of chlorophyll (an indicator of photosynthetic bacteria and algae) varies by\nalmost a thousand-fold across the ocean basins. That variation is almost entirely due to the availability of nitrogen\u2014one of the major\n\u201cbiogenic elements\u201d in forms that can be used by life. (credit: modification of work by NASA, Gene C. Feldman)\nWith these first two requirements, we have the elemental raw materials of life and a solvent in which to\nassemble them into the complicated molecules that drive our biochemistry. But carrying out that assembly\nand maintaining the complicated biochemical machinery of life takes energy. You fulfill your own requirement\nfor energy every time you eat food or take a breath, and you would not live for long if you failed to do either\non a regular basis. Life on Earth makes use of two main types of energy: for you, these are the oxygen in the\nair you breathe and the organic molecules in your food. But life overall can use a much wider array of\nchemicals and, while all animals require oxygen, many bacteria do not. One of the earliest known life\nprocesses, which still operates in some modern microorganisms, combines hydrogen and carbon dioxide to\nmake methane, releasing energy in the process. There are microorganisms that \u201cbreathe\u201d metals that would\nbe toxic to us, and even some that breathe in sulfur and breathe out sulfuric acid. Plants and photosynthetic\nmicroorganisms have also evolved mechanisms to use the energy in light directly.\nWater in the liquid phase, the biogenic elements, and energy are the fundamental requirements for\nhabitability. But are there additional environmental constraints? We consider this in the next section. 1036 30 \u2022 Life in the Universe\nFigure30.7Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park.This hot spring, where water emerges from the bluish center at\ntemperatures near the local boiling point (about 92 \u00baC), supports a thriving array of microbial life. The green, yellow, and orange\ncolors around the edges come from thick \u201cmats\u201d of photosynthetic bacteria. In fact, their coloration in part demonstrates their use\nof light energy\u2014some wavelengths of incoming sunlight are selectively captured for energy; the rest are reflected back. Since it lacks\nthe captured wavelengths, this light is now different in color than the sunlight that illuminates it. The blue part of the spring has\ntemperatures too high to allow photosynthetic life (hence the lack of color except that supplied by water itself), but life is still\npresent. Here, at nearly boiling temperatures, bacteria use the chemical energy supplied by the combination of hydrogen and other\nchemicals with oxygen. (credit: modification of work by Domenico Salvagnin)\nLife in Extreme Conditions\nAt a chemical level, life consists of many types of molecules that interact with one another to carry out the\nprocesses of life. In addition to water, elemental raw materials, and energy, life also needs an environment in\nwhich those complicated molecules are stable (don\u2019t break down before they can do their jobs) and their\ninteractions are possible. Your own biochemistry works properly only within a very narrow range of about 10\n\u00b0C in body temperature and two-tenths of a unit in blood pH (pH is a numerical measure of acidity, or the\namount of free hydrogen ions). Beyond those limits, you are in serious danger.\nLife overall must also have limits to the conditions in which it can properly work but, as we will see, they are\nmuch broader than human limits. The resources that fuel life are distributed across a very wide range of\nconditions. For example, there is abundant chemical energy to be had in hot springs that are essentially\nboiling acid (seeFigure 30.7). This provides ample incentive for evolution to fill as much of that range with life\nas is biochemically possible. An organism (usually a microbe) that tolerates or even thrives under conditions\nthat most of the life around us would consider hostile, such as very high or low temperature or acidity, is\nknown as anextremophile(where the suffix-philemeans \u201clover of\u201d). Let\u2019s have a look at some of the\nconditions that can challenge life and the organisms that have managed to carve out a niche at the far reaches\nof possibility.\nBoth high and low temperatures can cause a problem for life. As a large organism, you are able to maintain an\nalmost constant body temperature whether it is colder or warmer in the environment around you. But this is\nnot possible at the tiny size of microorganisms; whatever the temperature in the outside world is also the\ntemperature of the microbe, and its biochemistry must be able to function at that temperature. High\ntemperatures are the enemy of complexity\u2014increasing thermal energy tends to break apart big molecules\ninto smaller and smaller bits, and life needs to stabilize the molecules with stronger bonds and special\nproteins. But this approach has its limits.\nNevertheless, as noted earlier, high-temperature environments like hot springs and hydrothermal vents often\noffer abundant sources of chemical energy and therefore drive the evolution of organisms that can tolerate\nhigh temperatures (seeFigure 30.8); such an organism is called athermophile. Currently, the high\ntemperature record holder is a methane-producing microorganism that can grow at 122 \u00b0C, where the\npressure also is so high that water still does not boil. That\u2019s amazing when you think about it. We cook our\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30.2 \u2022 Astrobiology 1037\nfood\u2014meaning, we alter the chemistry and structure of its biomolecules\u2014by boiling it at a temperature of 100\n\u00b0C. In fact, food begins to cook at much lower temperatures than this. And yet, there are organisms whose\nbiochemistry remains intact and operates just fine at temperatures 20 degrees higher.\nFigure30.8Hydrothermal Vent on the Sea Floor.What appears to be black smoke is actually superheated water filled with\nminerals of metal sulfide. Hydrothermal vent fluid can represent a rich source of chemical energy, and therefore a driver for the\nevolution of microorganisms that can tolerate high temperatures. Bacteria feeding on this chemical energy form the base of a food\nchain that can support thriving communities of animals\u2014in this case, a dense patch of red and white tubeworms growing around\nthe base of the vent. (credit: modification of work by the University of Washington; NOAA/OAR/OER)\nCold can also be a problem, in part because it slows down metabolism to very low levels, but also because it\ncan cause physical changes in biomolecules. Cell membranes\u2014the molecular envelopes that surround cells\nand allow their exchange of chemicals with the world outside\u2014are basically made of fatlike molecules. And\njust as fat congeals when it cools, membranes crystallize, changing how they function in the exchange of\nmaterials in and out of the cell. Some cold-adapted cells (calledpsychrophiles) have changed the chemical\ncomposition of their membranes in order to cope with this problem; but again, there are limits. Thus far, the\ncoldest temperature at which any microbe has been shown to reproduce is about \u201325 \u00baC.\nConditions that are very acidic or alkaline can also be problematic for life because many of our important\nmolecules, like proteins and DNA, are broken down under such conditions. For example, household drain\ncleaner, which does its job by breaking down the chemical structure of things like hair clogs, is a very alkaline\nsolution. The most acid-tolerant organisms (acidophiles) are capable of living at pH values near zero\u2014about\nten million times more acidic than your blood (Figure 30.9). At the other extreme, somealkaliphilescan grow\nat pH levels of about 13, which is comparable to the pH of household bleach and almost a million times more\nalkaline than your blood. 1038 30 \u2022 Life in the Universe\nFigure30.9Spain\u2019s Rio Tinto.With a pH close to 2, Rio Tinto is literally a river of acid. Acid-loving microorganisms (acidophiles) not\nonly thrive in these waters, their metabolic activities help generate the acid in the first place. The rusty red color that gives the river\nits name comes from high levels of iron dissolved in the waters.\nHigh levels of salts in the environment can also cause a problem for life because the salt blocks some cellular\nfunctions. Humans recognized this centuries ago and began to salt-cure food to keep it from\nspoiling\u2014meaning, to keep it from being colonized by microorganisms. Yet some microbes have evolved to\ngrow in water that is saturated in sodium chloride (table salt)\u2014about ten times as salty as seawater (Figure\n30.10).\nFigure30.10Salt Ponds.The waters of an evaporative salt works near San Francisco are colored pink by thriving communities of\nphotosynthetic organisms. These waters are about ten times as salty as seawater\u2014enough for sodium chloride to begin to\ncrystallize out\u2014yet some organisms can survive and thrive in these conditions. (credit: modification of work by NASA)\nVery high pressures can literally squeeze life\u2019s biomolecules, causing them to adopt more compact forms that\ndo not work very well. But we still find life\u2014not just microbial, but even animal life\u2014at the bottoms of our\nocean trenches, where pressures are more than 1000 times atmospheric pressure. Many other adaptions to\nenvironmental \u201cextremes\u201d are also known. There is even an organism,Deinococcus radiodurans,that can\ntolerate ionizing radiation (such as that released by radioactive elements) a thousand times more intense than\nyou would be able to withstand. It is also very good at surviving extreme desiccation (drying out) and a variety\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30.3 \u2022 Searching for Life beyond Earth 1039\nof metals that would be toxic to humans.\nFrom many such examples, we can conclude that life is capable of tolerating a wide range of environmental\nextremes\u2014so much so that we have to work hard to identify places where life can\u2019t exist. A few such places\nare known\u2014for example, the waters of hydrothermal vents at over 300 \u00b0C appear too hot to support any\nlife\u2014and finding these places helps define the possibility for life elsewhere. The study of extremophiles over\nthe last few decades has expanded our sense of the range of conditions life can survive and, in doing so, has\nmade many scientists more optimistic about the possibility that life might exist beyond Earth.\n30.3 Searching for Life beyond Earth\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\nOutline what we have learned from exploration of the environment on Mars\nIdentify where in the solar system life is most likely sustainable and why\nDescribe some key missions and their findings in our search for life beyond our solar system\nExplain the use of biomarkers in the search for evidence of life beyond our solar system\nAstronomers and planetary scientists continue to search for life in the solar system and the universe at large.\nIn this section, we discuss two kinds of searches. First is the direct exploration of planets within our own solar\nsystem, especially Mars and some of the icy moons of the outer solar system. Second is the even more difficult\ntask of searching for evidence of life\u2014abiomarker\u2014on planets circling other stars. In the next section, we will\nexamine SETI, thesearch for extraterrestrial intelligence. As you will see, the approaches taken in these three\ncases are very different, even though the goal of each is the same: to determine if life on Earth is unique in the\nuniverse.\nLife on Mars\nThe possibility thatMarshosts, or has hosted, life has a rich history dating back to the \u201ccanals\u201d that some\npeople claimed to see on the martian surface toward the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of\nthe twentieth. With the dawn of the space age came the possibility to address this question up close through a\nprogression of missions to Mars that began with the first successful flyby of a robotic spacecraft in 1964 and\nhave led to the deployment of capable rovers, likeCuriosityandPerseverance, with instruments to look for\norganic chemistry.\nThe earliest missions to Mars provided some hints that liquid water\u2014one of life\u2019s primary requirements\u2014may\nonce have flowed on the surface, and later missions have strengthened this conclusion. The NASA Viking\nlanders, whose purpose was to search directly for evidence of life on Mars, arrived on Mars in 1976. Viking\u2019s\nonboard instruments found no organic molecules (the stuff of which life is made), and no evidence of\nbiological activity in the martian soils it analyzed.\nThis result is not particularly surprising because, despite the evidence of flowing liquid water in the past, liquid\nwater on the surface of Mars is generally not stable today. Over much of Mars, temperatures and pressures at\nthe surface are so low that pure water would either freeze or boil away (under very low pressures, water will\nboil at a much lower temperature than usual). To make matters worse, unlike Earth, Mars does not have a\nmagnetic field and ozone layer to protect the surface from harmful solar ultraviolet radiation and energetic\nparticles. However, Viking\u2019s analyses of the soil said nothing about whether life may have existed in Mars\u2019\ndistant past, when liquid water was more abundant. We do know that water in the form of ice exists in\nabundance on Mars, not so deep beneath its surface. Water vapor is also a constituent of the atmosphere of\nMars.\nSince the visit of Viking, our understanding of Mars has deepened spectacularly. Orbiting spacecraft have\nprovided ever-more detailed images of the surface and detected the presence of minerals that could have\nformed only in the presence of liquid water. Two bold surface missions, the Mars Exploration RoversSpiritand 1040 30 \u2022 Life in the Universe\nOpportunity(2004), followed by the much largerCuriosityRover (2012), confirmed these remote-sensing data.\nAll three rovers found abundant evidence for a past history of liquid water, revealed not only from the\nmineralogy of rocks they analyzed, but also from the unique layering of rock formations.\nCuriosityhas gone a step beyond evidence for water and confirmed the existence of habitable environments\non ancient Mars. \u201cHabitable\u201d means not only that liquid water was present, but that life\u2019s requirements for\nenergy and elemental raw materials could also have been met. The strongest evidence of an ancient habitable\nenvironment came from analyzing a very fine-grained rock called a mudstone\u2014a rock type that is widespread\non Earth but was unknown on Mars untilCuriosityfound it (seeFigure 30.11). The mudstone can tell us a great\ndeal about the wet environments in which they formed. ThePerseverancerover is collecting samples of\nsedimentary rock in a former lakebed, to later return to Earth for laboratory analysis.\nFigure30.11Mudstone.Shown are the first holes drilled by NASA\u2019sCuriosityMars rover into a mudstone, with \u201cfresh\u201d drill-pilings\naround the holes. Notice the difference in color between the red ancient martian surface and the gray newly exposed rock powder\nthat came from the drill holes. Each drill hole is about 0.6 inch (1.6 cm) in diameter. (credit: modification of work by NASA/JPL-\nCaltech/MSSS)\nFive decades of robotic exploration have allowed us to develop a picture of how Mars evolved through time.\nEarly Mars had epochs of warmer and wetter conditions that would have been conducive to life at the surface.\nHowever, Mars eventually lost much of its early atmosphere and the surface water began to dry up. As that\nhappened, the ever-shrinking reservoirs of liquid water on the martian surface became saltier and more acidic,\nuntil the surface finally had no significant liquid water and was bathed in harsh solar radiation. The surface\nthus became uninhabitable, but this might not be the case for the planet overall.\nReservoirs of ice and liquid water could still exist underground, where pressure and temperature conditions\nmake it stable. There is recent evidence to suggest that liquid water (probably very salty water) can\noccasionally (and briefly) flow on the surface even today. Thus, Mars might even have habitable conditions in\nthe present day, but of a much different sort than we normally think of on Earth.\nOur study of Mars reveals a planet with a fascinating history\u2014one that saw its ability to host surface life\ndwindle billions of years ago, but perhaps allowing life to adapt and survive in favorable environmental niches.\nEven if life did not survive, we expect that we might find evidence of life if it ever took hold on Mars. If it is\nthere, it is hidden in the crust, and we are still learning how best to decipher that evidence.\nLife in the Outer Solar System\nThe massive gas and ice giant planets of the outer solar system\u2014Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune\u2014are\nalmost certainly not habitable for life as we know it, but some of their moons might be (seeFigure 30.12).\nAlthough these worlds in the outer solar system contain abundant water, they receive so little warming\nsunlight in their distant orbits that it was long believed they would be \u201cgeologically dead\u201d balls of hard-frozen\nice and rock. But, as we saw in the chapter onRings, Moons, and Pluto, missions to the outer solar system\nhave found something much more interesting.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30.3 \u2022 Searching for Life beyond Earth 1041\nJupiter\u2019s moonEuroparevealed itself to the Voyager and Galileo missions as an active world whose icy surface\napparently conceals an ocean with a depth of tens to perhaps a hundred kilometers. As the moon orbits\nJupiter, the planet\u2019s massive gravity creates tides on Europa\u2014just as our own Moon\u2019s gravity creates our\nocean tides\u2014and the friction of all that pushing and pulling generates enough heat to keep the water in liquid\nform (Figure 30.13). Similar tides act upon other moons if they orbit close to the planet. Scientists now think\nthat six or more of the outer solar system\u2019s icy moons may harbor liquid water oceans for the same reason.\nAmong these, Europa and Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, have thus far been of greatest interest to\nastrobiologists.\nFigure30.12Jupiter\u2019s Moons.The Galilean moons of Jupiter are shown to relative scale and arranged in order of their orbital\ndistance from Jupiter. At far left, Io orbits closest to Jupiter and so experiences the strongest tidal heating by Jupiter\u2019s massive\ngravity. This effect is so strong that Io is thought to be the most volcanically active body in our solar system. At far right, Callisto\nshows a surface scarred by billions of years\u2019 worth of craters\u2014an indication that the moon\u2019s surface is old and that Callisto may be\nfar less active than its sibling moons. Between these hot and cold extremes, Europa, second from left, orbits at a distance where\nJupiter\u2019s tidal heating may be \u201cjust right\u201d to sustain a liquid water ocean beneath its icy crust. (credit: modification of work by NASA/\nJPL/DLR)\nEuropa has probably had an ocean for most or all of its history, but habitability requires more than just liquid\nwater. Life also requires energy, and because sunlight does not penetrate below the kilometers-thick ice crust\nof Europa, this would have to be chemical energy. One of Europa\u2019s key attributes from an astrobiology\nperspective is that its ocean is most likely in direct contact with an underlying rocky mantle, and the interaction\nof water and rocks\u2014especially at high temperatures, as within Earth\u2019s hydrothermal vent systems\u2014yields a\nreducing chemistry(where molecules tend to give up electrons readily) that is like one half of a chemical\nbattery. To complete the battery and provide energy that could be used by life requires that anoxidizing\nchemistry(where molecules tend to accept electrons readily) also be available. On Earth, when chemically\nreducing vent fluids meet oxygen-containing seawater, the energy that becomes available often supports\nthriving communities of microorganisms and animals on the sea floor, far from the light of the Sun.\nThe Galileo mission found that Europa\u2019s icy surface does contain an abundance of oxidizing chemicals. This\nmeans that availability of energy to support life depends very much on whether the chemistry of the surface\nand the ocean can mix, despite the kilometers of ice in between. That Europa\u2019s ice crust appears geologically\n\u201cyoung\u201d (only tens of millions of years old, on average) and that it is active makes it tantalizing to think that\nsuch mixing might indeed occur. Understanding whether and how much exchange occurs between the\nsurface and ocean of Europa will be a key science objective of future missions to Europa, and a major step\nforward in understanding whether this moon could be a cradle of life. 1042 30 \u2022 Life in the Universe\nFigure30.13Jupiter\u2019s Moon Europa, as Imaged by NASA\u2019s Galileo Mission.The relative scarcity of craters onEuropasuggests a\nsurface that is \u201cgeologically young,\u201d and the network of colored ridges and cracks suggests constant activity and motion. Galileo\u2019s\ninstruments also strongly suggested the presence of a massive ocean of salty liquid water beneath the icy crust. (credit: modification\nof work by NASA/JPL-Caltech/SETI Institute)\nIn 2005, the Cassini mission performed a close flyby of a small (500-kilometer diameter) moon of Saturn,\nEnceladus(Figure 30.14), and made a remarkable discovery. Plumes of gas and icy material were venting from\nthe moon\u2019s south polar region at a collective rate of about 250 kilograms of material per second. Several\nobservations, including the discovery of salts associated with the icy material, suggest that their source is a\nliquid water ocean beneath tens of kilometers of ice. Although it remains to be shown definitively whether the\nocean is local or global, transient or long-lived, it does appear to be in contact, and to have reacted, with a\nrocky interior. As on Europa, this is probably a necessary\u2014though not sufficient\u2014condition for habitability.\nWhat makes Enceladus so enticing to planetary scientists, though, are those plumes of material that seem to\ncome directly from its ocean: samples of the interior are there for the taking by any spacecraft sent flying\nthrough. For a future mission, such samples could yield evidence not only of whether Enceladus is habitable\nbut, indeed, of whether it is home to life.\nFigure30.14Image of Saturn\u2019s Moon Enceladus from NASA\u2019s Cassini Mission.The south polar region was found to have multiple\nplumes of ice and gas that, combined, are venting about 250 kilograms of material per second into space. Such features suggest that\nEnceladus, like Europa, has a sub-ice ocean. (credit: NASA/JPL/ SSI)\nSaturn\u2019s big moonTitanis very different from both Enceladus and Europa (seeFigure 30.15). Although it may\nhost a liquid water layer deep within its interior, it is the surface of Titan and its unusual chemistry that makes\nthis moon such an interesting place. Titan\u2019s thick atmosphere\u2014the only one among moons in the solar\nsystem\u2014is composed mostly of nitrogen but also of about 5% methane. In the upper atmosphere, the Sun\u2019s\nultraviolet light breaks apart and recombines these molecules into more complex organic compounds that are\ncollectively known astholins. The tholins shroud Titan in an orange haze, and imagery from Cassini and from\nthe Huygens probe that descended to Titan\u2019s surface show that heavier particles appear to accumulate on the\nsurface, even forming \u201cdunes\u201d that are cut and sculpted by flows of liquid hydrocarbons (such as liquid\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30.3 \u2022 Searching for Life beyond Earth 1043\nmethane). Some scientists see this organic chemical factory as a natural laboratory that may yield some clues\nabout the solar system\u2019s early chemistry\u2014perhaps even chemistry that could support the origin of life.\nFigure30.15Image of Saturn\u2019s Moon Titan from NASA\u2019s Cassini Mission.(a) The hazy orange glow comes from Titan\u2019s thick\natmosphere (the only one known among the moons of the solar system). That atmosphere is mostly nitrogen but also contains\nmethane and potentially a variety of complex organic compounds. The bright spot near the top of the image is sunlight reflected\nfrom a very flat surface\u2014almost certainly a liquid. We see this effect, called \u201cglint,\u201d when sunlight reflects off the surface of a lake or\nocean. (b) Cassini radar imagery shows what look very much like landforms and lakes on the surface of Titan. But the surface lakes\nand oceans of Titan are not water; they are probably made of liquid hydrocarbons like methane and ethane.

As we saw in the chapter on the formation of stars and planets, since\nthe discovery of the first exoplanet in 1995, there have been thousands of confirmed detections, and many\nmore candidates that are not yet confirmed. These include several dozen possibly habitable exoplanets. Such\nnumbers finally allow us to make some predictions about exoplanets and their life-hosting potential. The\nmajority of stars with mass similar to the Sun appear to host at least one planet, with multi-planet systems like\nour own not unusual. How many of these planets might be habitable, and how could we search for life there?\nLINK TO LEARNING\nTheNASA Exoplanet Archive(https://openstax.org/l/30NASAexoarc)is an up-to-date searchable online\nsource of data and tools on everything to do with exoplanets.

This concept focuses on\nlife\u2019s requirement for liquid water, and the habitable zone is generally thought of as the range of distances\nfrom the central star in which water could be present in liquid form at a planet\u2019s surface. In our own solar\nsystem, for example, Venus has surface temperatures far above the boiling point of water and Mars has\nsurface temperatures that are almost always below the freezing point of water. Earth, which orbits between\nthe two, has a surface temperature that is \u201cjust right\u201d to keep much of our surface water in liquid form.\nWhether surface temperatures are suitable for maintaining liquid water depends on a planet\u2019s \u201cradiation\nbudget\u201d \u2014how much starlight energy it absorbs and retains\u2014and whether or how processes like winds and\nocean circulation distribute that energy around the planet. How much stellar energy a planet receives, in turn,\n1\ndepends on how much and what sort of light the star emits and how far the planet is from that star, how\nmuch it reflects back to space, and how effectively the planet\u2019s atmosphere can retain heat through the\ngreenhouse effect (seeEarth as a Planet). All of these can vary substantially, and all matter a lot. For example,\nVenus receives about twice as much starlight per square meter as Earth but, because of its dense cloud cover,\nalso reflects about twice as much of that light back to space as Earth does. Mars receives only about half as\nmuch starlight as Earth, but also reflects only about half as much. Thus, despite their differing orbital\ndistances, the three planets actually absorb comparable amounts of sunlight energy. Why, then, are they so\ndramatically different?\nAs we learned in several chapters about the planets, some of the gases that make up planetary atmospheres\nare very effective at trapping infrared light\u2014the very range of wavelengths at which planets radiate thermal\nenergy back out to space\u2014and this can raise the planet\u2019s surface temperature quite a bit more than would\notherwise be the case. This is the same \u201cgreenhouse effect\u201d that is of such concern for global warming on our\nplanet. Earth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect, which comes mostly from water vapor and carbon dioxide in the\natmosphere, raises our average surface temperature by about 33 \u00b0C over the value it would have if there were\nno greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Mars has a very thin atmosphere and thus very little greenhouse\nwarming (about 2 \u00b0C worth), while Venus has a massive carbon dioxide atmosphere that creates very strong\ngreenhouse warming (about 510 \u00b0C worth). These worlds are much colder and much hotter, respectively, than\nEarth would be if moved into their orbits. Thus, we must consider the nature of any atmosphere as well as the\ndistance from the star in evaluating the range of habitability.\nOf course, as we have learned, stars also vary widely in the intensity and spectrum (the wavelengths of light)\nthey emit. Some are much brighter and hotter (bluer), while others are significantly dimmer and cooler\n(redder), and the distance of the habitable zone varies accordingly. For example, the habitable zone around M-\ndwarf stars is 3 to 30 times closer in than for G-type (Sun-like) stars. There is a lot of interest in whether such\nsystems could be habitable because\u2014although they have some potential downsides for supporting life\u2014M-\ndwarf stars are by far the most numerous and long-lived in our Galaxy.\nThe luminosity of stars like the Sun also increases over their main-sequence lifetime, and this means that the\nhabitable zone migrates outward as a star system ages. Calculations indicate that the power output of the Sun,\nfor example, has increased by at least 30% over the past 4 billion years. Thus, Venus was once within the\nhabitable zone, while Earth received a level of solar energy insufficient to keep the modern Earth (with its\npresent atmosphere) from freezing over. In spite of this, there is plenty of geological evidence that liquid\nwater was present on Earth\u2019s surface billions of years ago. The phenomenon of increasing stellar output and\nan outwardly migrating habitable zone has led to another concept: thecontinuouslyhabitable zone is defined\nby the range of orbits that would remain within the habitable zone during the entire lifetime of the star\nsystem. As you might imagine, the continuously habitable zone is quite a bit narrower than the habitable zone\n1 The amount of starlight received per unit area of a planet\u2019s surface (per square meter, for example) decreases with the square of\nthe distance from the star. Thus, when the orbital distance doubles, the illumination decreases by 4 times (22), and when the orbital\ndistance increases tenfold, the illumination decreases by 100 times (102). Venus and Mars orbit the sun at about 72% and 152% of\nEarth\u2019s orbital distance, respectively, so Venus receives about 1/(0.72)2= 1.92 (about twice) and Mars about 1/(1.52)2= 0.43 (about\nhalf) as much light per square meter of planet surface as Earth does.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30.3 \u2022 Searching for Life beyond Earth 1045\nis at any one time in a star\u2019s history. The nearest star to the Sun,Proxima Centauri, is an M star that has a\nplanet with a mass of at least 1.3 Earth masses, taking about 11 days to orbit. At the distance for such a quick\norbit (0.05 AU), the planet may be in the habitable zone of its star, although whether conditions on such a\nplanet near such a star are hospitable for life is a matter of great scientific debate.\nEven when planets orbit within the habitable zone of their star, it is no guarantee that they are habitable. For\nexample, Venus today has virtually no water, so even if it were suddenly moved to a \u201cjust right\u201d orbit within\nthe habitable zone, a critical requirement for life would still be lacking.\nScientists are working to understand all the factors that define the habitable zone and the habitability of\nplanets orbiting within that zone because this will be our primary guide in targeting exoplanets on which to\nseek evidence of life. As technology for detecting exoplanets has advanced, so too has our potential to find\nEarth-size worlds within the habitable zones of their parent stars. Of the confirmed or candidate exoplanets\nknown at the time of writing, nearly 300 are considered to be orbiting within the habitable zone and more than\n10% of those are roughly Earth-size.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nExplore the habitable universe at the onlinePlanetary Habitability Laboratory(https://openstax.org/l/\n30planhabitlab)created by the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo.

But are any\nof them inhabited? With no ability to send probes there to sample, we will have to derive the answer from the\nlight and other radiation that come to us from these faraway systems (Figure 30.16). What types of\nobservations might constitute good evidence for life?\nFigure30.16Earth, as Seen by NASA\u2019s Voyager 1.In this image, taken from 4 billion miles away, Earth appears as a \u201cpale blue dot\u201d 1046 30 \u2022 Life in the Universe\nrepresenting less than a pixel\u2019s worth of light. Would this light reveal Earth as a habitable and inhabited world? Our search for life on\nexoplanets will depend on an ability to extract information about life from the faint light of faraway worlds. (credit: modification of\nwork by NASA/JPL-Caltech)\nTo be sure, we need to look for robust biospheres (atmospheres, surfaces, and/or oceans) capable of creating\nplanet-scale change. Earth hosts such a biosphere: the composition of our atmosphere and the spectrum of\nlight reflected from our planet differ considerably from what would be expected in the absence of life.\nPresently, Earth is the only body in our solar system for which this is true, despite the possibility that habitable\nconditions might prevail in the subsurface of Mars or inside the icy moons of the outer solar system. Even if\nlife exists on these worlds, it is very unlikely that it could yield planet-scale changes that are both telescopically\nobservable and clearly biological in origin.\nWhat makes Earth \u201cspecial\u201d among the potentially habitable worlds in our solar system is that it has a\nphotosynthetic biosphere. This requires the presence of liquid water at the planet\u2019s surface, where organisms\nhave direct access to sunlight. The habitable zone concept focuses on this requirement for surface liquid\nwater\u2014even though we know that subsurface habitable conditions could prevail at more distant\norbits\u2014exactly because these worlds would have biospheres detectable at a distance.\nIndeed, plants and photosynthetic microorganisms are so abundant at Earth\u2019s surface that they affect the\ncolor of the light that our planet reflects out into space\u2014we appear greener in visible wavelengths and reflect\nmore near-infrared light than we otherwise would. Moreover, photosynthesis has changed Earth\u2019s\natmosphere at a large scale\u2014more than 20% of our atmosphere comes from the photosynthetic waste\nproduct, oxygen. Such high levels would be very difficult to explain in the absence of life. Other gases, such as\nnitrous oxide and methane, when found simultaneously with oxygen, have also been suggested as possible\nindicators of life. When sufficiently abundant in an atmosphere, such gases could be detected by their effect\non the spectrum of light that a planet emits or reflects. (As we saw in the chapter on exoplanets, astronomers\ntoday are beginning to have the capability of detecting the spectrum of the atmospheres of some planets\norbiting other stars.)\nAstronomers have thus concluded that, at least initially, a search for life outside our solar system should focus\non exoplanets that are as much like Earth as possible\u2014roughly Earth-size planets orbiting in the habitable\nzone\u2014and look for the presence of gases in the atmosphere or colors in the visible spectrum that are hard to\nexplain except by the presence of biology. Simple, right? In reality, the search for exoplanet life poses many\nchallenges.\nAs you might imagine, this task is more challenging for planetary systems that are farther away and, in\npractical terms, this will limit our search to the habitable worlds closest to our own. Should we become limited\nto a very small number of nearby targets, it will also become important to consider the habitability of planets\norbiting the M-dwarfs we discussed above.\nIf we manage to separate out a clean signal from the planet and find some features in the light spectrum that\nmight be indicative of life, we will need to work hard to think of any nonbiological process that might account\nfor them. \u201cLife is the hypothesis of last resort,\u201d noted astronomer Carl Sagan\u2014meaning that we must exhaust\nall other explanations for what we see before claiming to have found evidence of extraterrestrial biology. This\nrequires some understanding of what processes might operate on worlds that we will know relatively little\nabout; what we find on Earth can serve as a guide but also has potential to lead us astray (Figure 30.17).\nRecall, for example, that it would be extremely difficult to account for the abundance of oxygen in Earth\u2019s\natmosphere except by the presence of biology. But it has been hypothesized that oxygen could build up to\nsubstantial levels on planets orbiting M-dwarf stars through the action of ultraviolet radiation on the\natmosphere\u2014with no need for biology. It will be critical to understand where such \u201cfalse positives\u201d might exist\nin carrying out our search.\nWe need to understand that we might not be able to detect biospheres even if they exist. Life has flourished\non Earth for perhaps 3.5 billion years, but the atmospheric \u201cbiosignatures\u201d that, today, would supply good\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30.4 \u2022 The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence 1047\nevidence for life to distant astronomers have not been present for all of that time. Oxygen, for example,\naccumulated to detectable levels in our atmosphere only a little over 2 billion years ago. Could life on Earth\nhave been detected before that time? Scientists are working actively to understand what additional features\nmight have provided evidence of life on Earth during that early history, and thereby help our chances of\nfinding life beyond.\nFigure30.17Spectrum of Light Transmitted through Earth\u2019s Atmosphere.This graph shows wavelengths ranging from\nultraviolet (far left) to infrared. The many downward \u201cspikes\u201d come from absorption of particular wavelengths by molecules in\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere. Some of these compounds, like water and the combination oxygen/ozone and methane, might reveal Earth as\nboth habitable and inhabited. We will have to rely on this sort of information to seek life on exoplanets, but our spectra will be of\nmuch poorer quality than this one, in part because we will receive so little light from the planet.

Even if that life is microbial, we saw that we may soon have ways to search for\nchemical biosignatures. This search is of fundamental importance for understanding biology, but it does not\nanswer the question, \u201cAre we alone?\u201d that we raised at the beginning of this chapter. When we ask this\nquestion, many people think of other intelligent creatures, perhaps beings that have developed technology\nsimilar to our own. If any intelligent, technical civilizations have arisen, as has happened on Earth in the most\nrecent blink of cosmic time, how could we make contact with them?\nThis problem is similar to making contact with people who live in a remote part of Earth. If students in the\nUnited States want to converse with students in Australia, for example, they have two choices. Either one\ngroup gets on an airplane and travels to meet the other, or they communicate by sending a message\nremotely. Given how expensive airline tickets are, most students would probably select the message route.\nIn the same way, if we want to get in touch with intelligent life around other stars, we can travel, or we can try\nto exchange messages. Because of the great distances involved, interstellar space travel would be very slow\nand prohibitively expensive. The fastest spacecraft the human species has built so far would take almost\n80,000 years to get to the nearest star. While we could certainly design a faster craft, the more quickly we\nrequire it to travel, the greater the energy cost involved. To reach neighboring stars in less than a human life\nspan, we would have to travel close to the speed of light. In that case, however, the expense would become 1048 30 \u2022 Life in the Universe\ntruly astronomical.\nInterstellar Travel\nBernardOliver, an engineer with an abiding interest in life elsewhere, made a revealing calculation about the\ncosts of rapid interstellar space travel. Since we do not know what sort of technology we (or other civilizations)\nmight someday develop, Oliver considered a trip to the nearest star (and back again) in a spaceship with a\n\u201cperfect engine\u201d\u2014one that would convert its fuel into energy with 100% efficiency. Even with a perfect engine,\nthe energy cost of a single round-trip journey at 70% the speed of light turns out to be equivalent to several\nhundred thousand years\u2019 worth of total U.S. electrical energy consumption. The cost of such travel is literally\nout of this world.\nThis is one reason astronomers are so skeptical about claims that UFOs are spaceships from extraterrestrial\ncivilizations. Given the distance and energy expense involved, it seems unlikely that the dozens of UFOs (and\neven UFO abductions) claimed each year could be visitors from other stars so fascinated by Earth civilization\nthat they are willing to expend fantastically large amounts of energy or time to reach us. Nor does it seem\ncredible that these visitors have made this long and expensive journey and then systematically avoided\ncontacting our governments or political and intellectual leaders.\nNot every UFO report has been explained (in many cases, the observations are sketchy or contradictory). But\ninvestigation almost always converts them to IFOs (identified flying objects) or NFOs (not-at-all flying objects).\nWhile some are hoaxes, others are natural phenomena, such as bright planets, ball lightning, fireballs (bright\nmeteors), or even flocks of birds that landed in an oil slick to make their bellies reflective. Still others are\nhuman craft, such as private planes with some lights missing, or secret military aircraft. It is also interesting\nthat the group of people who most avidly look at the night sky, the amateur astronomers, have never reported\nUFO sightings. Further, not a single UFO has ever left behind any physical evidence that can be tested in a\nlaboratory and shown to be of nonterrestrial origin.\nAnother common aspect of belief that aliens are visiting Earth comes from people who have difficulty\naccepting human accomplishments. There are many books and TV shows, for example, that assert that\nhumans could not have built the great pyramids of Egypt, and therefore they must have been built by aliens.\nThe huge statues (called Moai) on Easter Island are also sometimes claimed to have been built by aliens. Some\npeople even think that the accomplishments of space exploration today are based on alien technology.\nHowever, the evidence from archaeology and history is clear: ancient monuments were built by ancient\npeople,whose brains and ingenuity were every bit as capable as ours are today, even if they didn\u2019t have\nelectronic textbooks like you do.\nMessages on Spacecraft\nWhile space travel by living creatures seems very difficult, robot probes can travel over long distances and over\nlong periods of time. Five spacecraft\u2014two Pioneers, two Voyagers, and New Horizons\u2014are now leaving the\nsolar system. At their coasting speeds, they will take hundreds of thousands or millions of years to get\nanywhere close to another star. On the other hand, they were the first products of human technology to go\nbeyond our home system, so we wanted to put messages on board to show where they came from.\nEachPioneercarries a plaque with a pictorial message engraved on a gold-anodized aluminum plate (Figure\n30.18). The Voyagers, launched in 1977, have audio and video records attached, which allowed the inclusion of\nover 100 photographs and a selection of music from around the world. Given the enormous space between\nstars in our section of the Galaxy, it is very unlikely that these messages will ever be received by anyone. They\nare more like a note in a bottle thrown into the sea by a shipwrecked sailor, with no realistic expectation of its\nbeing found soon but a slim hope that perhaps someday, somehow, someone will know of the sender\u2019s fate.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30.4 \u2022 The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence 1049\nFigure30.18Interstellar Messages.(a) This is the image engraved on the plaques aboard the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft.

It is likely to survive a billion years into our future, when our\ncivilization is profoundly altered. . . . If [another] civilization intercepts Voyager and can understand these\nrecorded contents, here is our message:\nThis is a present from a small, distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our\nthoughts, and our feelings. We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours. We hope,\nsomeday, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations. This record\nrepresents our hope and our determination, and our goodwill in a vast and awesome universe.\u201d\n\u2014Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America, June 16, 1977\nCommunicating with the Stars\nIf direct visits among stars are unlikely, we must turn to the alternative for making contact: exchanging\nmessages. Here the news is a lot better. We already use a messenger\u2014light or, more generally,\nelectromagnetic waves\u2014that moves through space at the fastest speed in the universe. Traveling at 300,000\nkilometers per second, light reaches the nearest star in only 4 years and does so at a tiny fraction of the cost of\nsending material objects. These advantages are so clear and obvious that we assume they will occur to any\nother species of intelligent beings that develop technology.\nHowever, we have access to a wide spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, ranging from the longest-\nwavelength radio waves to the shortest-wavelength gamma rays. Which would be the best for interstellar\ncommunication? It would not be smart to select a wavelength that is easily absorbed by interstellar gas and 1050 30 \u2022 Life in the Universe\ndust, or one that is unlikely to penetrate the atmosphere of a planet like ours. Nor would we want to pick a\nwavelength that has lots of competition for attention in our neighborhood.\nOne final criterion makes the selection easier: we want the radiation to be inexpensive enough to produce in\nlarge quantities. When we consider all these requirements, radio waves turn out to be the best answer. Being\nthe lowest-frequency (and lowest-energy) band of the spectrum, they are not very expensive to produce, and\nwe already use them extensively for communications on Earth. They are not significantly absorbed by\ninterstellar dust and gas. With some exceptions, they easily pass through Earth\u2019s atmosphere and through the\natmospheres of the other planets we are acquainted with.\nThe Cosmic Haystack\nHaving made the decision that radio is the most likely means of communication among intelligent civilizations,\nwe still have many questions and a daunting task ahead of us. Shall wesenda message, or try toreceiveone?\nObviously, if every civilization decides to receive only, then no one will be sending, and everyone will be\ndisappointed. On the other hand, it may be appropriate for us tobeginby listening, since we are likely to be\namong the most primitive civilizations in the Galaxy who are interested in exchanging messages.\nWe do not make this statement to insult the human species (which, with certain exceptions, we are rather fond\nof). Instead, we base it on the fact that humans have had the ability to receive (or send) a radio message\nacross interstellar distances for only a few decades. Compared to the ages of the stars and the Galaxy, this is a\nmere instant. If there are civilizations out there that are ahead of us in development by even a short time (in\nthe cosmic sense), they are likely to have a technology head start of many, many years.\nIn other words, we, who have just started, may well be the \u201cyoungest\u201d species in the Galaxy with this capability\n(see the discussion inExample 30.1). Just as the youngest members of a community are often told to be quiet\nand listen to their elders for a while before they say something foolish, so may we want to begin our exercise\nin extraterrestrial communication by listening.\nEven restricting our activities to listening, however, leaves us with an array of challenging questions. For\nexample, if an extraterrestrial civilization\u2019s signal is too weak to be detected by our present-day radio\ntelescopes, we will not detect them. In addition, it would be very expensive for an extraterrestrial civilization to\nbroadcast on a huge number of channels. Most likely, they select one or a few channels for their particular\nmessage. Communicating on a narrow band of channels also helps distinguish an artificial message from the\nradio static that comes from natural cosmic processes. But the radio band contains an astronomically large\nnumber of possible channels. How can we know in advance which one they have selected, and how they have\ncoded their message into the signal?\nTable 30.1summarizes these and other factors that scientists must grapple with when trying to tune in to\nradio messages from distant civilizations. Because their success depends on either guessing right about so\nmany factors or searching through all the possibilities for each factor, some scientists have compared their\nquest to looking for a needle in a haystack. Thus, they like to say that the list of factors inTable 30.1defines the\ncosmic haystack problem.\nThe Cosmic Haystack Problem: Some Questions about an Extraterrestrial Message\nFactors\nFrom which direction (which star) is the message coming?\nOn what channels (or frequencies) is the message being broadcast?\nTable30.1\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30.4 \u2022 The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence 1051\nFactors\nHow wide in frequency is the channel?\nHow strong is the signal (can our radio telescopes detect it)?\nIs the signal continuous, or does it shut off at times (as, for example, a lighthouse beam does when it turns\naway from us)?\nDoes the signal drift (change) in frequency because of the changing relative motion of the source and the\nreceiver?\nHow is the message encoded in the signal (how do we decipher it)?\nCan we even recognize a message from a completely alien species? Might it take a form we don\u2019t at all\nexpect?\nTable30.1\nRadio Searches\nAlthough thecosmic haystack problemseems daunting, many other research problems in astronomy also\nrequire a large investment of time, equipment, and patient effort. And, of course, if we don\u2019t search, we\u2019re\nsure not to find anything.\nThe very first search was conducted by astronomer Frank Drake in 1960, using the 85-foot antenna at the\nNational Radio Astronomy Observatory (Figure 30.19). Called Project Ozma, after the queen of the exotic Land\nof Oz in the children\u2019s stories of L. Frank Baum, his experiment involved looking at about 7200 channels and\ntwo nearby stars over a period of 200 hours. Although he found nothing, Drake demonstrated that we had the\ntechnology to do such a search, and set the stage for the more sophisticated projects that followed.\nFigure30.19Project Ozma and the Allen Telescope Array.(a) This 25th anniversary photo shows some members of the Project\nOzma team standing in front of the 85-foot radio telescope with which the 1960 search for extraterrestrial messages was performed.\nFrank Drake is in the back row, second from the right. (b) TheAllen Telescope Arrayin California is made up of 42 small antennas\nlinked together. This system allows simultaneous observations of multiple sources with millions of separate frequency channels.\n(credit a: modification of work by NRAO; credit b: modification of work by Colby Gutierrez-Kraybill) 1052 30 \u2022 Life in the Universe\nReceivers are constantly improving, and the sensitivity of SETI programs\u2014SETIstands for the search for\nextraterrestrial intelligence\u2014is advancing rapidly. Equally important, modern electronics and software allow\nsimultaneous searches on millions of frequencies (channels). If we can thus cover a broad frequency range,\nthe cosmic haystack problem of guessing the right frequency largely goes away. One powerful telescope array\n(funded with an initial contribution from Microsoft founder Paul Allen) that is built for SETI searches is the\nAllen Telescope in Northern California. Other radio telescopes being used for such searches have included the\ngiant Arecibo radio dish in Puerto Rico (which, sadly, collapsed due to storm damage in late 2020), the recently\ncompleted, and even larger, FAST dish in China, and the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, which is the\nlargest steerable radio telescope in the world.\nIn 2015, Silicon Valley investor and philanthropist Yuri Milner donated 100 million dollars to the University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley, to enhance the SETI endeavor for ten years. The project, called Breakthrough: Listen, is\nenlisting more telescopes around the world in the search and is developing sophisticated artificial intelligence\nprograms to scour the incoming signals for intelligent messages. The aim is to search more stars and more\nchannels than any SETI project so far.\nWhat kind of signals do we hope to pick up? We on Earth are inadvertently sending out a flood of radio signals,\ndominated by military radar systems. This is a kind of leakage signal, similar to the wasted light energy that is\nbeamed upward by poorly designed streetlights and advertising signs. Could we detect a similar leakage of\nradio signals from another civilization? The answer is just barely, but only for the nearest stars. For the most\npart, therefore, current radio SETI searches are looking for beacons, assuming that civilizations might be\nintentionally drawing attention to themselves or perhaps sending a message to another world or outpost that\nlies in our direction. Our prospects for success depend on how often civilizations arise, how long they last, and\nhow patient they are about broadcasting their locations to the cosmos.\nVOYAGERS IN ASTRONOMY\nJill Tarter: Trying to Make Contact\n1997 was quite a year for Jill CornellTarter(Figure 30.20), one of the world\u2019s leading scientists in the SETI\nfield. TheSETIInstitute announced that she would be the recipient of its first endowed chair (the equivalent\nof an endowed research professorship) named in honor of Bernard Oliver. The National Science Foundation\napproved a proposal by a group of scientists and educators she headed to develop an innovative hands-on\nhigh school curriculum based on the ideas of cosmic evolution (the topics of this chapter). And, at roughly\nthe same time, she was being besieged with requests for media interviews as news reports identified her as\nthe model for Ellie Arroway, the protagonist ofContact, Carl Sagan\u2019s best-selling novel about SETI. The book\nhad been made into a high-budget science fiction film, starring Jodie Foster, who had talked with Tarter\nbefore taking the role.\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30.4 \u2022 The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence 1053\nFigure30.20Jill Tarter (credit: Christian Schidlowski)\nTarter is quick to point out, \u201cCarl Sagan wrote a book about a woman who does what I do, not about me.\u201d\nStill, as the only woman in such a senior position in the small field of SETI, she was the center of a great deal\nof public attention. (However, colleagues and reporters pointed out that this was nothing compared to\nwhat would happen if her search for radio signals from other civilizations recorded a success.)\nBeing the only woman in a group is not a new situation to Tarter, who often found herself the only woman\nin her advanced science or math classes. Her father had encouraged her, both in her interest in science and\nher \u201ctinkering.\u201d As an undergraduate at Cornell University, she majored in engineering physics. That\ntraining became key to putting together and maintaining the complex systems that automatically scan for\nsignals from other civilizations.\nSwitching to astrophysics for her graduate studies, she wrote a PhD thesis that, among other topics,\nconsidered the formation of failed stars\u2014those whose mass was not sufficient to ignite the nuclear\nreactions that power more massive stars like our own Sun. Tarter coined the term \u201cbrown dwarf\u201d for these\nsmall, dim objects, and it has remained the name astronomers use ever since.\nIt was while she was still in graduate school that Stuart Bowyer, one of her professors at the University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley, asked her if she wanted to be involved in a small experiment to siphon off a bit of\nradiation from a radio telescope as astronomers used it year in and year out and see if there was any hint\nof an intelligently coded radio message buried in the radio noise. Her engineering and computer\nprogramming skills became essential to the project, and soon she was hooked on the search for life\nelsewhere.\nThus began an illustrious career working full time searching for what she calls the technosignatures (signs\nof technology) from extraterrestrial civilizations. Tarter has received many awards, including being elected\nfellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2002, the Adler Planetarium Women\nin Space Science Award in 2003, and a 2009 TED Prize.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nWatch theTED talk(https://openstax.org/l/30TarterSETI)Jill Tarter gave on the fascination of the search for\nintelligence. 1054 30 \u2022 Life in the Universe\nEXAMPLE 30.1\nThe Drake Equation\nAt the first scientific meeting devoted to SETI, FrankDrakewrote an equation on the blackboard that took\nthe difficult question of estimating the number of civilizations in the Galaxy and broke it down into a series\nof smaller, more manageable questions. Ever since then, both astronomers and students have used this\nDrake equationas a means of approaching the most challenging question: How likely is it that we are\nalone? Since this is at present an unanswerable question, astronomer Jill Tarter has called the Drake\nequation a \u201cway of organizing our ignorance.\u201d (SeeFigure 30.21.)\nFigure30.21Drake Equation.A plaque at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory commemorates the conference where the\nequation was first discussed. (credit: NRAO/NSF/AUI)\nThe form of the Drake equation is very simple. To estimate the number of communicating civilizations that\ncurrently exist in the Galaxy (we will define these terms more carefully in a moment), we multiply the rate of\nformation of such civilizations (number per year) by their average lifetime (in years). In symbols,\nTo make this formula easier to use (and more interesting), however, Drake separated the rate of formation\nR into a series of probabilities:\ntotal\nR is the rate of formation of stars like the Sun in our Galaxy, which is, very roughly, around 10 stars per\nstar\nyear. Each of the other terms is a fraction or probability (less than or equal to 1.0), and the product of all\nthese probabilities is itself the total probability that each star will have an intelligent, technological,\ncommunicating civilization that we might want to talk to. We have:\n\u2022 f = the fraction of these stars with planets\np\n\u2022 f = the fraction of the planetary systems that include habitable planets\ne\n\u2022 f= the fraction of habitable planets that actually support life\nl\n\u2022 f= the fraction of inhabited planets that develop advanced intelligence\ni\n\u2022 f = the fraction of these intelligent civilizations that develop science and the technology to build radio\nc\ntelescopes and transmitters\nEach of these factors can be discussed and perhaps evaluated, but we must guess at many of the values. In\nparticular, we don\u2019t know how to calculate the probability of something that happened once on Earth but\nhas not been observed elsewhere\u2014and these include the development of life, of intelligent life, and of\ntechnological life (the last three factors in the equation). One important advance in estimating the terms of\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30.4 \u2022 The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence 1055\nthe Drake equation comes from the recent discovery of exoplanets. When the Drake equation was first\nwritten, no one had any idea whether planets and planetary systems were common. Now we know they\nare\u2014another example of the Copernican principle.\nSolution\nEven if we don\u2019t know the answers, we can make some guesses and calculate the resulting numberN. Let\u2019s\nstart with the optimism implicit in the Copernican principle and set the last three terms equal to 1.0. IfRis\n10 stars/year and if we measure the average lifetime of a technological civilization in years, the units of\nyears cancel. If we also assume thatf is 0.1, andf is 1.0, the equation becomes\np e\nNow we see the importance of the term L, the lifetime of a communicating civilization (measured in years).\nWe have had this capability (to communicate at the distances of the stars) for only a few decades.\nCheck Your Learning\nSuppose we assume that this stage in our history lasts only one century.\nAnswer:\nWith our optimistic assumptions about the other factors,L= 100 years andN= 100 such civilizations in the\nentire Galaxy. In that case, there are so few other civilizations like ours that we are unlikely to detect any\nsignals in a SETI search. But suppose the average lifetime is a million years; in that case, there are a million\nsuch civilizations in the Galaxy, and some of them may be within range for radio communication.\nThe most important conclusion from this calculation is that even if we are extremely optimistic about the\nprobabilities, the only way we can expect success from SETI is if other civilizations are much older (and\nhence probably much more advanced) than ours.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nReadFrank Drake\u2019s own account(https://openstax.org/l/30drakeequat)of how he came up with his\n\u201cequation.\u201d And here is arecent interview(https://openstax.org/l/30frandrakinter)with Frank Drake by one\nof the authors of this textbook.\nSETI outside the Radio Realm\nFor the reasons discussed above, most SETI programs search for signals at radio wavelengths. But in science, if\nthere are other approaches to answering an unsolved question, we don\u2019t want to neglect them. So\nastronomers have been thinking about other ways we could pick up evidence for the existence of\ntechnologically advanced civilizations.\nRecently, technology has allowed astronomers to expand the search into the domain of visible light. You might\nthink that it would be hopeless to try to detect a flash of visible light from a planet given the brilliance of the\nstar it orbits. This is why we usually cannot measure the reflected light of planets around other stars. The\nfeeble light of the planet is simply swamped by the \u201cbig light\u201d in the neighborhood. So another civilization\nwould need a mighty strong beacon to compete with their star.\nHowever, in recent years, human engineers have learned how to make flashes of light brighter than the Sun.\nThe trick is to \u201cturn on\u201d the light for a very brief time, so that the costs are manageable. But ultra-bright, ultra-\nshort laser pulses (operating for periods of a billionth of a second) can pack a lot of energy and can be coded\nto carry a message. We also have the technology to detect such short pulses\u2014not with human senses, but\nwith special detectors that can be \u201ctuned\u201d to hunt automatically for such short bursts of light from nearby 1056 30 \u2022 Life in the Universe\nstars.\nWhy would any civilization try to outshine its own star in this way? It turns out that the cost of sending an\nultra-short laser pulse in the direction of a few promising stars can be less than the cost of sweeping a\ncontinuous radio message across the whole sky. Or perhaps they, too, have a special fondness for light\nmessages because one of their senses evolved using light. Several programs are now experimenting with\n\u201coptical SETI\u201d searches, which can be done with only a modest telescope. (The termopticalhere means using\nvisible light.)\nIf we let our imaginations expand, we might think of other fortechnosignatures\u2014signs of technology from\nother civilizations. For example, what if a truly advanced civilization should decide to (or need to) renovate its\nplanetary system to maximize the area for life? It could do so by breaking apart some planets or moons and\nbuilding a ring of solid material that surrounds or encloses the star and intercepts some or all of its light. This\nhuge artificial ring or sphere might glow very brightly at infrared wavelengths, as the starlight it receives is\neventually converted to heat and re-radiated into space. That infrared radiation could be detected by our\ninstruments, and searches for such infrared sources are also underway (Figure 30.22).\nFigure30.22Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE).Astronomers have used this infrared satellite to search for infrared\nsignatures of enormous construction projects by very advanced civilizations, but their first survey did not reveal any. (credit:\nmodification of work by NASA/JPL-Caltech)\nShould We Transmit in Addition to Listening?\nOur planet has some leakage of radio waves into space, from FM radio, television, military radars, and\ncommunication between Earth and our orbiting spacecraft. However, such leakage radiation is still quite weak,\nand therefore difficult to detect at the distances of the stars, at least with the radio technology we have. So at\nthe present time our attempts to communicate with other civilizations that may be out there mostly involve\ntrying to receive messages, but not sending any ourselves.\nSome scientists, however, think that it is inconsistent to search for beacons from other civilizations without\nannouncing our presence in a similar way. (We discussed earlier the problem that if every other civilization\nconfined itself to listening, no one would ever get in touch.) So, should we be making regular attempts at\nsending easily decoded messages into space? Some scientists warn that our civilization is too immature and\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30.4 \u2022 The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence 1057\ndefenseless to announce ourselves at this early point in our development. The decision whether to transmit or\nnot turns out to be an interesting reflection of how we feel about ourselves and our place in the universe.\nDiscussions of transmission also raise the question of who should speak for planet Earth. Today, anyone and\neveryone can broadcast radio signals, and many businesses, religious groups, and governments do. It would\nbe a modest step for the same organizations to use or build large radio telescopes and begin intentional\ntransmissions that are much stronger than the signals that leak from Earth today. And if we intercept a signal\nfrom an alien civilization, then the issue arises whether to reply.\nWho should make the decision about whether, when, and how humanity announces itself to the cosmos? Is\nthere freedom of speech when it comes to sending radio messages to other civilizations? Do all the nations of\nEarth have to agree before we send a signal strong enough that it has a serious chance of being received at\nthe distances of the stars? How our species reaches a decision about these kinds of questions may well be a\ntest of whether or not there is intelligent life on Earth.\nConclusion\nWhether or not we ultimately turn out to be the only intelligent species in our part of the Galaxy, our\nexploration of the cosmos will surely continue. An important part of that exploration will still be the search for\nbiomarkers from inhabited planets that have not produced technological creatures that send out radio signals.\nAfter all, creatures like butterflies and dolphins may never build radio antennas, but we are happy to share our\nplanet with them and would be delighted to find their counterparts on other worlds.\nWhether or not life exists elsewhere is just one of the unsolved problems in astronomy that we have discussed\nin this book. A humble acknowledgment of how much we have left to learn about the universe is one of the\nfundamental hallmarks of science. This should not, however, prevent us from feeling exhilarated about how\nmuch we have already managed to discover, and feeling curious about what else we might find out in the\nyears to come.\nOur progress report on the ideas of astronomy ends here, but we hope that your interest in the universe does\nnot. We hope you will keep up with developments in astronomy through media and online, or by going to an\noccasional public lecture by a local scientist. Who, after all, can even guess all the amazing things that future\nresearch projects will reveal about both the universe and our connection with it? 1058 30 \u2022 Key Terms\nKey Terms\namino acids organic compounds that are the molecular building blocks of proteins\nastrobiology the multidisciplinary study of life in the universe: its origin, evolution, distribution, and fate;\nsimilar terms areexobiologyandbioastronomy\nbiomarker evidence of the presence of life, especially a global indication of life on a planet that could be\ndetected remotely (such as an unusual atmospheric composition)\nDNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) a molecule that stores information about how to replicate a cell and its\nchemical and structural components\nDrake equation a formula for estimating the number of intelligent, technological civilizations in our Galaxy,\nfirst suggested by Frank Drake\nextremophile an organism (usually a microbe) that tolerates or even thrives under conditions that most of\nthe life around us would consider hostile, such as very high or low temperature or acidity\ngene the basic functional unit that carries the genetic (hereditary) material contained in a cell\nhabitable environment an environment capable of hosting life\nhabitable zone the region around a star in which liquid water could exist on the surface of terrestrial-sized\nplanets, hence the most probable place to look for life in a star\u2019s planetary system\norganic compound a compound containing carbon, especially a complex carbon compound; not necessarily\nproduced by life\norganic molecule a combination of carbon and other atoms\u2014primarily hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,\nphosphorus, and sulfur\u2014some of which serve as the basis for our biochemistry\nphotosynthesis a complex sequence of chemical reactions through which some living things can use\nsunlight to manufacture products that store energy (such as carbohydrates), releasing oxygen as one by-\nproduct\nprotein a key biological molecule that provides the structure and function of the body\u2019s tissues and organs,\nand essentially carries out the chemical work of the cell\nRNA (ribonucleic acid) a molecule that aids in the flow of genetic information from DNA to proteins\nSETI the search for extraterrestrial intelligence; usually applied to searches for radio signals from other\ncivilizations\nstromatolites solid, layered rock formations that are thought to be the fossils of oxygen-producing\nphotosynthetic bacteria in rocks that are 3.5 billion years old\nthermophile an organism that can tolerate high temperatures\nSummary\n30.1The Cosmic Context for Life\nLife on Earth is based on the presence of a key unit known as an organic molecule, a molecule that contains\ncarbon, especially complex hydrocarbons. Our solar system formed about 5 billion years ago from a cloud of\ngas and dust enriched by several generations of heavier element production in stars. Life is made up of\nchemical combinations of these elements made by stars. The Copernican principle, which suggests that there\nis nothing special about our place in the universe, implies that if life could develop on Earth, it should be able\nto develop in other places as well. The Fermi paradox asks why, if life is common, more advanced life-forms\nhave not contacted us.\n30.2Astrobiology\nThe study of life in the universe, including its origin on Earth, is called astrobiology. Life as we know it requires\nwater, certain elemental raw materials (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur), energy,\nand an environment in which the complex chemistry of life is stable. Carbon-based (or organic) molecules are\nabundant in space and may also have been produced by processes on Earth. Life appears to have spread\naround our planet within 400 million years after the end of heavy bombardment, if not sooner. The actual\nAccess for free at openstax.org 30 \u2022 For Further Exploration 1059\norigin of life\u2014the processes leading from chemistry to biology\u2014is not completely understood. Once life took\nhold, it evolved to use many energy sources, including first a range of different chemistries and later light, and\ndiversified across a range of environmental conditions that humans consider \u201cextreme.\u201d This proliferation of\nlife into so many environmental niches, so relatively soon after our planet became habitable, has served to\nmake many scientists optimistic about the chances that life could exist elsewhere.\n30.3Searching for Life beyond Earth\nThe search for life beyond Earth offers several intriguing targets. Mars appears to have been more similar to\nEarth during its early history than it is now, with evidence for liquid water on its ancient surface and perhaps\neven now below ground. The accessibility of the martian surface to our spacecraft offers the exciting potential\nto directly examine ancient and modern samples for evidence of life. In the outer solar system, the moons\nEuropa and Enceladus likely host vast sub-ice oceans that may directly contact the underlying rocks\u2014a good\nstart in providing habitable conditions\u2014while Titan offers a fascinating laboratory for understanding the sorts\nof organic chemistry that might ultimately provide materials for life. And the last decade of research on\nexoplanets leads us to believe that there may be billions of habitable planets in the Milky Way Galaxy. Study of\nthese worlds offers the potential to find biomarkers indicating the presence of life.\n30.4The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence\nSome astronomers are engaged in the search for extraterrestrial intelligent life (SETI). Because other planetary\nsystems are so far away, traveling to the stars is either very slow or extremely expensive (in terms of energy\nrequired). Despite many UFO reports and tremendous media publicity, there is no evidence that any of these\nare related to extraterrestrial visits. Scientists have determined that the best way to communicate with any\nintelligent civilizations out there is by using electromagnetic waves, and radio waves seem best suited to the\ntask. So far, they have only begun to comb the many different possible stars, frequencies, signal types, and\nother factors that make up what we call the cosmic haystack problem. Some astronomers are also undertaking\nsearches for brief, bright pulses of visible light and infrared signatures of huge construction projects by\nadvanced civilizations. If we do find a signal someday, deciding whether to answer and what to answer may be\ntwo of the greatest challenges humanity will face.\nFor Further Exploration\nArticles\nAstrobiology\nChyba, C. \u201cThe New Search for Life in the Universe.\u201dAstronomy(May 2010): 34.

If one of the rocks from Mars examined by a future mission to the red planet does turn out to have\nunambiguous signs of ancient life that formed on Mars, what does your group think would be the\nimplications of such a discovery for science and for our view of life elsewhere? Would such a discovery\nhave any long-term effects on your own thinking?\nB. Suppose we receive a message from an intelligent civilization around another star. What does your group\nthink the implications of this discovery would be? How would your own thinking or personal philosophy be\naffected by such a discovery?\nC. A radio message has been received from a civilization around a star 40 light-years away, which contains (in 1062 30 \u2022 Exercises\npictures) quite a bit of information about the beings that sent the message. The president of the United\nStates has appointed your group a high-level commission to advise whether humanity should answer the\nmessage (which was not particularly directed at us, but comes from a beacon that, like a lighthouse,\nsweeps out a circle in space). How would you advise the president? Does your group agree on your\nanswer or do you also have a minority view to present?\nD. If there is no evidence that UFOs are extraterrestrial visitors, why does your group think that television\nshows, newspapers, and movies spend so much time and effort publicizing the point of view that UFOs are\ncraft from other worlds? Make a list of reasons. Who stands to gain by exaggerating stories of unknown\nlights in the sky or simply fabricating stories that alien visitors are already here?\nE. Does your group think scientists should simply ignore all the media publicity about UFOs or should they\ntry to respond? If so, how should they respond? Does everyone in the group agree?\nF. Suppose your group is the team planning to select the most important sights and sounds of Earth to\nrecord and put on board the next interstellar spacecraft. What pictures (or videos) and sounds would you\ninclude to represent our planet to another civilization?\nG. Let\u2019s suppose Earth civilization has decided to broadcast a message announcing our existence to other\npossible civilizations among the stars. Your group is part of a large task force of scientists,\ncommunications specialists, and people from the humanities charged with deciding the form and content\nof our message. What would you recommend? Make a list of ideas.\nH. Think of examples of contact with aliens you have seen in movies and on TV. Discuss with your group how\nrealistic these have been, given what you have learned in this class. Was the contact in person (through\ntraveling) or using messages? Why do you think Hollywood does so many shows and films that are not\nbased on our scientific understanding of the universe?\nI. Go through the Drake equation with your group and decide on values for each factor in the estimate. (If\nyou disagree on what a factor should be within the group, you can have a \u201cminority report.\u201d) Based on the\nfactors, how many intelligent, communicating civilizations do you estimate to be thriving in our Galaxy\nright now?\nExercises\nReview Questions\n1.

If we do find life on Mars, what might be some ways to check whether it formed separately from Earth life,\nor whether exchanges of material between the two planets meant that the two forms of life have a\ncommon origin?\n16. What kind of evidence do you think would convince astronomers that an extraterrestrial spacecraft has\nlanded on Earth?\n17. What are some reasons that more advanced civilizations might want to send out messages to other star\nsystems?\n18. What are some answers to the Fermi paradox? Can you think of some that are not discussed in this\nchapter?\n19. Why is there so little evidence of Earth\u2019s earliest history and therefore the period when life first began on\nour planet?\n20. Why was the development of photosynthesis a major milestone in the evolution of life?\n21. Does all life on Earth require sunshine?\n22. Why is life unlikely to be found on the surface of Mars today?\n23. In this chapter, we identify these characteristic properties of life: life extracts energy from its environment,\nand has a means of encoding and replicating information in order to make faithful copies of itself. Does\nthis definition fully capture what we think of as \u201clife\u201d? How might our definition be biased by our\nterrestrial environment?\n24.

How can a planet\u2019s atmosphere affect the width of the habitable zone in its planetary system?\n28. Why are we limited to finding life on planets orbiting other stars to situations where the biosphere has\ncreated planet-scale changes? 1064 30 \u2022 Exercises\nFiguring for Yourself\n29. Suppose astronomers discover a radio message from a civilization whose planet orbits a star 35 light-\nyears away. Their message encourages us to send a radio answer, which we decide to do. Suppose our\ngoverning bodies take 2 years to decide whether and how to answer. When our answer arrives there, their\ngoverning bodies also take two of our years to frame an answer to us. How long after we get their first\nmessage can we hope to get their reply to ours? (A question for further thinking: Once communication\ngets going, should we continue to wait for a reply before we send the next message?)\n30. The light a planet receives from the Sun (per square meter of planet surface) decreases with the square of\nthe distance from the Sun. So a planet that is twice as far from the Sun as Earth receives (1/2)2= 0.25 times\n(25%) as much light and a planet that is three times as far from the Sun receives (1/3)2= 0.11 times (11%)\nas much light. How much light is received by the moons of Jupiter and Saturn (compared to Earth), worlds\nwhich orbit 5.2 and 9.5 times farther from the Sun than Earth?\n31. Think of our Milky Way Galaxy as a flat disk of diameter 100,000 light-years. Suppose we are one of 1000\ncivilizations, randomly distributed through the disk, interested in communicating via radio waves. How far\naway would the nearest such civilization be from us (on average)?\nAccess for free at openstax.org A \u2022 How to Study for an Introductory Astronomy Class 1065\nA How to Study for an Introductory Astronomy Class\nIn this brief appendix, we want to give you some hints for the effective study of astronomy. These suggestions\nare based on ideas from good teachers and good students around the United States. Your professor will\nprobably have other, more specific suggestions for doing well in your class.\nAstronomy, the study of the universe beyond the borders of our planet, is one of the most exciting and rapidly\nchanging branches of science. Even scientists from other fields often confess to having had a lifelong interest\nin astronomy, though they may now be doing something earthbound\u2014like biology, chemistry, engineering, or\nwriting software.\nBut some of the things that make astronomy so interesting also make it a challenge for the beginning student.\nThe universe is a big place, full of objects and processes that do not have familiar counterparts here on Earth.\nLike a visitor to a new country, it will take you a while to feel familiar with the territory or the local customs.\nAstronomy, like other sciences, also has its own special vocabulary, some of which you will have to learn to\ncommunicate well with your professor and classmates.\nStill, hundreds of thousands of non-science majors take an introductory astronomy course every year, and\nsurveys show that students from a wide range of backgrounds have succeeded in (and even enjoyed) these\nclasses. Astronomy is for everyone, not just those who are \u201cscience oriented.\u201d\nSo, here are some suggestions to help you increase your chances of doing well in your astronomy class.\n1. The best advice we can give you is to be sure to leave enough time in your schedule to study the material\nin this class regularly. It sounds obvious, but it is not very easy to catch up with a subject like astronomy by\ntrying to do everything just before an exam. (As astronomers like to put it, you can\u2019t learn the whole\nuniverse in one night!) Try to put aside some part of each day, or every other day, when you can have\nuninterrupted time for reading and studying astronomy.\n2. In class, put your phone away and focus on the class activities. If you have to use a laptop or tablet in\nclass, make a pact with yourself that you willnotcheck email, get on social media, or play games during\nclass. A number of careful studies of student behavior and grades have shown that students are not as\ngood at such multi-tasking as they think they are, and that students who donotuse screens during class\nget significantly better grades in the end.\n3. Try to take careful notes during class. Many students start college without good note-taking habits. If you\nare not a good note-taker, try to get some help. Many colleges and universities have student learning\ncenters that offer short courses, workbooks, tutors, or videos on developing good study habits. Good\nnote-taking skills will also be useful for many jobs or activities you are likely get involved with after college.\n4. Try to read each assignment in the textbook twice, once before it is discussed in class, and once afterward.\nYou can highlight text or make notes in your copy of this electronic book: just move your cursor over some\ntext and a box with highlight colors and room for notes will become visible.\n5. Form a small astronomy study group with people in your class. Get together with them regularly and\ndiscuss what you have been learning. Also, focus on the topics that may be giving group members\ntrouble. Make up sample exam questions and make sure everyone in the group can answer them\nconfidently. If you have always studied alone, you may at first resist this idea, but don\u2019t be too hasty to say\nno. Study groups are a very effective way to digest a large amount of new information.\n6. Before each exam, create a concise outline of the main ideas discussed in class and presented in your text.\nCompare your outline with those of other students as a check on your own study habits.\n7. If your professor suggests doing web-based sample quizzes, or looking at online apps, animations, or\nstudy guides, take advantage of these resources to enhance your studying.\n8. At the end of each chapter in this textbook you, will find four kinds of questions. The Collaborative Group\nActivities are designed to encourage you follow up on the material in the chapter as a group, rather than\nindividually. Review Questions help you see if you have learned the material in the chapter. Thought 1066 A \u2022 How to Study for an Introductory Astronomy Class\nQuestions test deeper understanding by asking you to apply your knowledge to new situations. And\nFiguring for Yourself exercises test and extend some of the mathematical examples in the chapter. (Not all\nprofessors will use the math sections; if they don\u2019t, you may not have homework from this section.)\n9. If you find a topic in the text or in class especially difficult or interesting, talk to your professor or teaching\nassistant. Many students are scared to show their ignorance in front of their teacher, but we can assure\nyou that most professors and TA\u2019slikeit when students come to office hours and show that they care\nenough about the course to ask for help.\n10. Don\u2019t stay up all night before a test and then expect your mind to respond well. For the same reason,\ndon\u2019t eat a big meal just before a test, since we all get a little sleepy and don\u2019t think as clearly after a big\nmeal. Take many deep breaths and try to relax during the test itself.\n11. Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself! If astronomy is new to you, many of the ideas and terms in this book may\nbe unfamiliar. Astronomy is like any new language: it may take a while to become a good\nconversationalist. Practice as much as you can, but also realize that it is natural to feel overwhelmed by\nthe vastness of the universe and the variety of things that are going on in it.\nAccess for free at openstax.org B \u2022 Astronomy Websites, Images, and Apps 1067\nB Astronomy Websites, Images, and Apps\nThroughout the textbook, we suggest useful resources for students on the specific topics in a given chapter.\nHere, we offer some websites for exploring astronomy in general, plus good sites for viewing and\ndownloading the best astronomy images, and guides to astronomical apps for smartphones and tablets.

In fact,\nwhen numbers become truly large in everyday life, such as the national debt in the United States, we call them\nastronomical. Among the ideas astronomers must routinely deal with is that the Earth is 150,000,000,000\nmeters from the Sun, and the mass of the hydrogen atom is 0.00000000000000000000000000167 kilograms. No\none in his or her right mind would want to continue writing so many zeros!\nInstead, scientists have agreed on a kind of shorthand notation, which is not only easier to write, but (as we\nshall see) makes multiplication and division of large and small numbers much less difficult. If you have never\nused this powers-of-ten notation or scientific notation, it may take a bit of time to get used to it, but you will\nsoon find it much easier than keeping track of all those zeros.\nWriting Large Numbers\nIn scientific notation, we generally agree to have only one number to the left of the decimal point. If a number\nis not in this format, it must be changed. The number 6 is already in the right format, because for integers, we\nunderstand there to be a decimal point to the right of them. So 6 is really 6., and there is indeed only one\nnumber to the left of the decimal point. But the number 965 (which is 965.) has three numbers to the left of\nthe decimal point, and is thus ripe for conversion.\nTo change 965 to proper form, we must make it 9.65 and then keep track of the change we have made. (Think\nof the number as a weekly salary and suddenly it makes a lot of difference whether we have $965 or $9.65.) We\nkeep track of the number of places we moved the decimal point by expressing it as a power of ten. So 965\nbecomes 9.65 \u00d7 102or 9.65 multiplied by ten to the second power. The small raised 2 is called an exponent, and\nit tells us how many times we moved the decimal point to the left.\nNote that 102also designates 10 squared, or 10 \u00d7 10, which equals 100. And 9.65 \u00d7 100 is just 965, the number\nwe started with. Another way to look at scientific notation is that we separate out the messy numbers out\nfront, and leave the smooth units of ten for the exponent to denote. So a number like 1,372,568 becomes\n1.372568 times a million (106) or 1.372568 times 10 multiplied by itself 6 times. We had to move the decimal\npoint six places to the left (from its place after the 8) to get the number into the form where there is only one\ndigit to the left of the decimal point.\nThe reason we call this powers-of-ten notation is that our counting system is based on increases of ten; each\nplace in our numbering system is ten times greater than the place to the right of it. As you have probably\nlearned, this got started because human beings have ten fingers and we started counting with them. (It is\ninteresting to speculate that if we ever meet intelligent life-forms with only eight fingers, their counting system\nwould probably be a powers-of-eight notation!)\nSo, in the example we started with, the number of meters from Earth to the Sun is 1.5 \u00d7 1011. Elsewhere in the\nbook, we mention that a string 1 light-year long would fit around Earth\u2019s equator 236 million or 236,000,000\ntimes. In scientific notation, this would become 2.36 \u00d7 108. Now if you like expressing things in millions, as the\nannual reports of successful companies do, you might like to write this number as 236 \u00d7 106. However, the\nusual convention is to have only one number to the left of the decimal point.\nWriting Small Numbers\nNow take a number like 0.00347, which is also not in the standard (agreed-to) form for scientific notation. To\nput it into that format, we must make the first part of it 3.47 by moving the decimal point three placesto the\nright. Note that this motion to the right is the opposite of the motion to the left that we discussed above. To\nkeep track, we call this change negative and put a minus sign in the exponent. Thus 0.00347 becomes 3.47 \u00d7\n10\u22123. 1074 C \u2022 Scientific Notation\nIn the example we gave at the beginning, the mass of the hydrogen atom would then be written as 1.67 \u00d7 10\u221227\nkg. In this system, one is written as 100, a tenth as 10\u22121, a hundredth as 10\u22122, and so on. Note that any number,\nno matter how large or how small, can be expressed in scientific notation.\nMultiplication and Division\nScientific notation is not only compact and convenient, it also simplifies arithmetic. To multiply two numbers\nexpressed as powers of ten, you need only multiply the numbers out front and thenaddthe exponents. If\nthere are no numbers out front, as in 100 \u00d7 100,000, then you just add the exponents (in our notation, 102\u00d7 105\n= 107). When there are numbers out front, you have to multiply them, but they are much easier to deal with\nthan numbers with many zeros in them.\nHere\u2019s an example:\nAnd here\u2019s another example:\nNote in the second example that when we added the exponents, we treated negative exponents as we do in\nregular arithmetic (\u22122 plus 6 equals 4). Also, notice that our first result had a 24 in it, which was not in the\nacceptable form, having two places to the left of the decimal point, and we therefore changed it to 2.4 and\nchanged the exponent accordingly.\nTo divide, you divide the numbers out front andsubtractthe exponents. Here are several examples:\nIn the last example, our first result was not in the standard form, so we had to change 0.452 into 4.52, and\nchange the exponent accordingly.\nIf this is the first time that you have met scientific notation, we urge you to practice many examples using it.\nYou might start by solving the exercises below. Like any new language, the notation looks complicated at first\nbut gets easier as you practice it.\nExercises\n1. At the end of September, 2015, the New Horizons spacecraft (which encountered Pluto for the first time in\nJuly 2015) was 4.898 billion km from Earth. Convert this number to scientific notation. How many\nastronomical units is this? (An astronomical unit is the distance from Earth to the Sun, or about 150 million\nkm.)\n2. During the first six years of its operation, the Hubble Space Telescope circled Earth 37,000 times, for a total\nof 1,280,000,000 km. Use scientific notation to find the number of km in one orbit.\n3. In a large university cafeteria, a soybean-vegetable burger is offered as an alternative to regular\nhamburgers. If 889,875 burgers were eaten during the course of a school year, and 997 of them were\nveggie-burgers, what fraction and what percent of the burgers does this represent?\n4. In a 2012 Kelton Research poll, 36 percent of adult Americans thought that alien beings have actually\nlanded on Earth. The number of adults in the United States in 2012 was about 222,000,000. Use scientific\nnotation to determine how many adults believe aliens have visited Earth.\nAccess for free at openstax.org C \u2022 Scientific Notation 1075\n5. In the school year 2009\u20132010, American colleges and universities awarded 2,354,678 degrees. Among\nthese were 48,069 PhD degrees. What fraction of the degrees were PhDs? Express this number as a\npercent. (Now go and find a job for all those PhDs!)\n6. A star 60 light-years away has been found to have a large planet orbiting it. Your uncle wants to know the\ndistance to this planet in old-fashioned miles. Assume light travels 186,000 miles per second, and there are\n60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, and 365 days in a year. How many miles\naway is that star?\nAnswers\n1. 4.898 billion is 4.898 \u00d7 109km. One astronomical unit (AU) is 150 million km = 1.5 \u00d7 108km. Dividing the\nfirst number by the second, we get 3.27 \u00d7 10(9 \u2013 8)= 3.27 \u00d7 101AU.\n2.\n3. (or roughly about one\nthousandth) of the burgers were vegetarian. Percent means per hundred. So\n(which is roughly one tenth of one percent).\n4. 36% is 36 hundredths or 0.36 or 3.6 \u00d7 10\u22121. Multiply that by 2.22 \u00d7 108and you get about 7.99 \u00d7 10(\u22121 + 8)=\n7.99 \u00d7 107or almost 80 million people who believe that aliens have landed on our planet. We need more\nastronomy courses to educate all those people.\n5. . (Note that in these examples we are rounding\noff some of the numbers so that we don\u2019t have more than 2 places after the decimal point.)\n6. One light-year is the distance that light travels in one year. (Usually, we use metric units and not the old\nBritish system that the United States is still using, but we are going to humor your uncle and stick with\nmiles.) If light travels 186,000 miles every second, then it will travel 60 times that in a minute, and 60 times\nthat in an hour, and 24 times that in a day, and 365 times that in a year. So we have 1.86 \u00d7 105\u00d7 6.0 \u00d7 101\u00d7\n6.0 \u00d7 101\u00d7 2.4 \u00d7 101\u00d7 3.65 \u00d7 102. So we multiply all the numbers out front together and add all the\nexponents. We get 586.57 \u00d7 1010= 5.86 \u00d7 1012miles in a light year (which is roughly 6 trillion miles\u2014a heck\nof a lot of miles). So if the star is 60 light-years away, its distance in miles is 6 \u00d7 101\u00d7 5.86 \u00d7 1012= 35.16 \u00d7\n1013= 3.516 \u00d7 1014miles. 1076 C \u2022 Scientific Notation\nAccess for free at openstax.org D \u2022 Units Used in Science 1077\nD Units Used in Science\nIn the American system of measurement (originally developed in England), the fundamental units of length,\nweight, and time are the foot, pound, and second, respectively. There are also larger and smaller units, which\ninclude the ton (2240 lb), the mile (5280 ft), the rod (16 1/2 ft), the yard (3 ft), the inch (1/12 ft), the ounce (1/16\nlb), and so on. Such units, whose origins in decisions by British royalty have been forgotten by most people,\nare quite inconvenient for conversion or doing calculations.\nIn science, therefore, it is more usual to use themetric system,which has been adopted in virtually all\ncountries except the United States. Its great advantage is that every unit increases by a factor of ten, instead of\nthe strange factors in the American system. The fundamental units of the metric system are:\n\u2022 length: 1 meter (m)\n\u2022 mass: 1 kilogram (kg)\n\u2022 time: 1 second (s)\nA meter was originally intended to be 1 ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole along\nthe surface of Earth. It is about 1.1 yd. A kilogram is the mass that on Earth results in a weight of about 2.2 lb.\nThe second is the same in metric and American units.\nLength\nThe most commonly used quantities of length of the metric system are the following.\nConversions\n1 kilometer (km) = 1000 meters = 0.6214 mile\n1 meter (m) = 0.001 km = 1.094 yards = 39.37 inches\n1 centimeter (cm) = 0.01 meter = 0.3937 inch\n1 millimeter (mm) = 0.001 meter = 0.1 cm\n1 micrometer (\u00b5m) = 0.000001 meter = 0.0001 cm\n1 nanometer (nm) = 10\u22129meter = 10\u22127cm\nTableD1Length\nTo convert from the American system, here are a few helpful factors:\n\u2022 1 mile = 1.61 km\n\u2022 1 inch = 2.54 cm\nMass\nAlthough we don\u2019t make the distinction very carefully in everyday life on Earth, strictly speaking the kilogram is\na unit of mass (measuring the quantity of matter in a body, roughly how many atoms it has,) while the pound\nis a unit of weight (measuring how strongly Earth\u2019s gravity pulls on a body).\nThe most commonly used quantities of mass of the metric system are the following. 1078 D \u2022 Units Used in Science\nConversions\n1 metric ton = 106grams = 1000 kg (and it produces a weight of 2.205 \u00d7 103lb on Earth)\n1 kg = 1000 grams (and it produces a weight of 2.2046 lb on Earth)\n1 gram (g) = 0.0353 oz (and the equivalent weight is 0.002205 lb)\n1 milligram (mg) = 0.001 g\nTableD2Mass\nA weight of 1 lb is equivalent on Earth to a mass of 0.4536 kg, while a weight of 1 oz is produced by a mass of\n28.35 g.\nTemperature\nThree temperature scales are in general use:\n\u2022 Fahrenheit (F); water freezes at 32 \u00b0F and boils at 212 \u00b0F.\n1\n\u2022 Celsius or centigrade (C); water freezes at 0 \u00b0C and boils at 100 \u00b0C.\n\u2022 Kelvin or absolute (K); water freezes at 273 K and boils at 373 K.\nAll molecular motion ceases at about \u2212459 \u00b0F = \u2212273 \u00b0C = 0 K, a temperature calledabsolute zero.Kelvin\ntemperature is measured from this lowest possible temperature, and it is the temperature scale most often\nused in astronomy. Kelvins have the same value as centigrade or Celsius degrees, since the difference\nbetween the freezing and boiling points of water is 100 degrees in each. (Note that we just say \u201ckelvins,\u201d not\nkelvin degrees.)\nOn the Fahrenheit scale, the difference between the freezing and boiling points of water is 180 degrees. Thus,\nto convert Celsius degrees or kelvins to Fahrenheit degrees, it is necessary to multiply by 180/100 = 9/5. To\nconvert from Fahrenheit degrees to Celsius degrees or kelvins, it is necessary to multiply by 100/180 = 5/9.\nThe full conversion formulas are:\n\u2022 K = \u00b0C + 273\n\u2022 \u00b0C = 0.555 \u00d7 (\u00b0F \u2013 32)\n\u2022 \u00b0F = (1.8 \u00d7 \u00b0C) + 32\n1 Celsius is now the name used for centigrade temperature; it has a more modern standardization but differs from the old\ncentigrade scale by less than 0.1\u00b0.\nAccess for free at openstax.org E \u2022 Some Useful Constants for Astronomy 1079\nE Some Useful Constants for Astronomy\nPhysical Constants\nName Value\nspeed of light (c) 2.9979 \u00d7 108m/s\ngravitational constant (G) 6.674 \u00d7 10\u221211m3/(kg s2)\nPlanck\u2019s constant (h) 6.626 \u00d7 10\u221234J-s\nmass of a hydrogen atom (M ) 1.673 \u00d7 10\u221227kg\nH\nmass of an electron (M) 9.109 \u00d7 10\u221231kg\ne\nRydberg constant ( \u221e) 1.0974 \u00d7 107m\u22121\n10\u22128J/(s\u00b7m2deg4)1\nStefan-Boltzmann constant (\u03c3) 5.670 \u00d7\nWien\u2019s law constant (\u03bb T) 2.898 \u00d7 10\u22123m K\nmax\nelectron volt (energy) (eV) 1.602 \u00d7 10\u221219J\nenergy equivalent of 1 ton TNT 4.2 \u00d7 109J\nTableE1\nAstronomical Constants\nName Value\nastronomical unit (AU) 1.496 \u00d7 1011m\nLight-year (ly) 9.461 \u00d7 1015m\nparsec (pc) 3.086 \u00d7 1016m = 3.262 light-years\nsidereal year (y) 3.156 \u00d7 107s\nmass of Earth (M ) 5.974 \u00d7 1024kg\nEarth\nequatorial radius of Earth (R ) 6.378 \u00d7 106m\nEarth\nTableE2\n1 deg stands for degrees Celsius or kelvins 1080 E \u2022 Some Useful Constants for Astronomy\nName Value\nobliquity of ecliptic 23\u00b0 26\u2019\nsurface gravity of Earth (g) 9.807 m/s2\nescape velocity of Earth (v ) 1.119 \u00d7 104m/s\nEarth\nmass of Sun (M ) 1.989 \u00d7 1030kg\nSun\nequatorial radius of Sun (R ) 6.960 \u00d7 108m\nSun\nluminosity of Sun (L ) 3.85 \u00d7 1026W\nSun\nsolar constant (flux of energy\n1.368 \u00d7 103W/m2\nreceived at Earth) (S)\napproximately 20 km/s per million light-years, or approximately 70\nHubble constant (H )\n0\nkm/s per megaparsec\nTableE2\nAccess for free at openstax.org F \u2022 Physical and Orbital Data for the Planets 1081\nF Physical and Orbital Data for the Planets\nPhysical Data for the Major Planets\nMajor Mean Mean Mass Mean Rotation Inclination Surface Velocity\nPlanet Diameter Diameter (Earth Density Period of Equator Gravity of\n(km) (Earth = = 1) (g/cm3) (d) to Orbit (\u00b0) (Earth = Escape\n1) 1[g]) (km/s)\nMercury 4879 0.38 0.055 5.43 58. 0.0 0.38 4.3\nVenus 12,104 0.95 0.815 5.24 \u2212243. 177 0.90 10.4\nEarth 12,756 1.00 1.00 5.51 1.000 23.4 1.00 11.2\nMars 6779 0.53 0.11 3.93 1.026 25.2 0.38 5.0\nJupiter 140,000 10.9 318 1.33 0.414 3.1 2.53 60.\nSaturn 117,000 9.13 95.2 0.69 0.440 26.7 1.07 36.\nUranus 50,700 3.98 14.5 1.27 \u22120.718 97.9 0.89 21.\nNeptune 49,200 3.86 17.2 1.64 0.671 29.6 1.14 23.\nTableF1\nPhysical Data for Well-Studied Dwarf Planets\nWell- Diameter Diameter Mass Mean Rotation Inclination Surface Velocity\nStudied (km) (Earth = (Earth Density Period of Equator Gravity of\nDwarf 1) = 1) (g/cm3) (d) to Orbit (\u00b0) (Earth Escape\nPlanet = 1[g]) (km/s)\nCeres 950 0.07 0.0002 2.2 0.378 3 0.03 0.5\nPluto 2470 0.18 0.0024 1.9 \u22126.387 122 0.06 1.3\nHaumea 1700 0.13 0.0007 3 0.163 \u2014 \u2014 0.8\nMakemake 1400 0.11 0.0005 2 0.321 \u2014 \u2014 0.8\n1\nEris 2326 0.18 0.0028 2.5 1.25 \u2014 \u2014 1.4\nTableF2\n1 This measurement is quite uncertain. 1082 F \u2022 Physical and Orbital Data for the Planets\nOrbital Data for the Major Planets\nMajor Semimajor Semimajor Sidereal Sidereal Mean Orbital Inclination\nPlanet Axis (AU) Axis (106 Period Period Orbital Eccentricity of Orbit to\nkm) (y) (d) Speed Ecliptic (\u00b0)\n(km/s)\nMercury 0.39 58 0.24 88.0 47.9 0.206 7.0\nVenus 0.72 108 0.6 224.7 35.0 0.007 3.4\nEarth 1.00 149 1.00 365.2 29.8 0.017 0.0\nMars 1.52 228 1.88 687.0 24.1 0.093 1.9\nJupiter 5.20 778 11.86 \u2014 13.1 0.048 1.3\nSaturn 9.54 1427 29.46 \u2014 9.6 0.056 2.5\nUranus 19.19 2871 84.01 \u2014 6.8 0.046 0.8\nNeptune 30.06 4497 164.82 \u2014 5.4 0.010 1.8\nTableF3\nOrbital Data for Well-Studied Dwarf Planets\nWell-Studied Semimajor Semimajor Sidereal Mean Orbital Inclination of\nDwarf Planet Axis (AU) Axis (106 Period Orbital Eccentricity Orbit to Ecliptic\nkm) (y) Speed (\u00b0)\n(km/s)\nCeres 2.77 414.0 4.6 18 0.08 11\nPluto 39.5 5915 248.6 4.7 0.25 17\nHaumea 43.1 6452 283.3 4.5 0.19 28\nMakemake 45.8 6850 309.9 4.4 0.16 29\nEris 68.0 10,120 560.9 3.4 0.44 44\nTableF4\nAccess for free at openstax.org G \u2022 Selected Moons of the Planets 1083\nG Selected Moons of the Planets\nNote: As this book goes to press, nearly two hundred moons are now known in the solar system and more are\nbeing discovered on a regular basis.

Next to each star's ancient name, we have added a column with its\nname in the system originated by Bayer (see theNaming Starsfeature box.)

free online resources.\n\u2022 One of the easiest is at the Skymaps website:http://www.skymaps.com/downloads.html\n(http://www.skymaps.com/downloads.html). Here you can print out a free PDF version of the northern sky\n(for roughly latitude 40\u00b0, which is reasonable for much of the United States). Maps of the sky from the\nequator and the southern hemisphere can also be printed.\n\u2022 Sky charts and other summaries of astronomical information can also be found athttp://www.heavens-\nabove.com/(http://www.heavens-above.com/).\n\u2022 A free, open-source computer application that shows the sky at any time from any place is called\nStellarium. You can find it athttp://www.stellarium.org/(http://www.stellarium.org/).\n\u2022 Appendix Bprovides a section of information for finding astronomy apps for cell phones and tablets.\nMany of these also provide star charts. If you have a smartphone, you can find a variety of inexpensive\napps that allow you to simply hold your phone upward to see what is in the sky behind your phone.\n\u2022 Aplanisphereis a sky chart that turns inside a round frame and can show you the night sky at your\nlatitude on any date and time of the year. You can buy them at science supply and telescope stores or\nonline. Or you can construct your own from templates at these two websites:\n\u25e6 Dennis Schatz\u2019s AstroAdventures Star
