{"text":"Introduction\nReading about any culture foreign to one\u2019s own tends to create a form of culture shock in the reader. In a world\nliterature class, students frequently face texts that are completely unfamiliar to them, and the typical culture shock\nreactions set in. We tend not to like things that we do not understand, in part because we do not like the feeling of\nnot knowing something. I have had students complain that they did not \u201clike\u201d a story before we discussed it in class,\nand then the same students decide after the class discussion that they now like it. Again, understanding and liking\ngo hand in hand. Give the literature a chance; something that might not make sense at first may end up being one of\nyour favorite stories after finding a way to approach it.\nThat being said, whether students like a story is not the point of reading that text in a literature class. We read\nliterature in these classes to learn something. It is a nice addition to the experience if students like the works, but we\ncan read and analyze texts that we do not enjoy just as effectively as the ones we do: In some cases, it is actually easier.\nCritical thinking comes from taking something that is unfamiliar, breaking it down into manageable chunks of infor-\nmation, fitting it back together, and using the experience to replicate the process in other situations in the future.\nA literature class is, of course, a perfect place to learn critical thinking skills. When interpreting a text, pre-\ntend that you are a lawyer in a courtroom arguing a case. Not all cases have smoking guns; most are won or lost on\ncircumstantial evidence alone. The interpretation needs to be based primarily on evidence from the text; therefore,\nthere can be more than one possible approach, but some interpretations can be wrong if there is no support in the\ntext for the generalizations that the student uses. Evidence is the key; based on what the text tells us, what do we\nactually know? Expert opinions (secondary sources) may help, but remember that both sides in a court case usually\ncan call some expert who will agree with them. Authorial intention is not entirely out of bounds in such an argu-\nment, but it operates on the same principles: What can we actually argue, based on the evidence? For instance, any\nknowledge of Hemingway\u2019s personal history makes it unlikely that the story \u201cSoldier\u2019s Home\u201d could be interpreted\nas unsupportive of soldiers. Alternately, there are cases when the author\u2019s life is of little or no help. Faulkner refused\nto tell an interviewer what the meaning of \u201cA Rose for Emily\u201d was, preferring perhaps that the reader not be limited\nby a simple (or simplistic) explanation of meaning.\nIn every interpretation, remember to distinguish between the views of the original audience and the views of\nthe modern reader. While a text may remind students about their grandfathers, that association does not often help\nwhen interpreting a story written by someone years ago who did not know their grandfather. (It may, of course, help\nstudents interpret their interpretations, but, except for the very best reader response theorists out there, that approach\nis more commonly found in a different field of study.) If the story is about a grandfather in ancient Greece, the com-\nparison with their grandfather would be most useful if it helped focus them on what the characters in that time period\nin Greek society thought about grandfathers (or treated them, or talked to them, etc.) back then that is similar to or\ndifferent from modern expectations. In other words, what does the work tell us about the expectations of the original\naudience? Without at least a solid guess about what the original audience thought about the work, it is impossible to\ndiscuss whether the author is writing something that conforms to society\u2019s expectations or argues against them, let\nalone what the original audience was expected to learn from the story, or how it expected to be entertained.\nThe expectations of the audience bring us full circle to the issue of culture shock once again. Students in U.S.\nuniversities often feel more comfortable with American or British literature, since the K-12 school system in the\nU.S. usually emphasizes those works. Even if some students have not lived through the 1960s in the U.S., there is\nstill a sense of familiarity to students raised in the U.S., although they might not understand as much of the deeper\nsocial context as they think they do. A world literature class may be the first place that some students have encoun-\ntered European works, let alone non-Western texts. The emphasis in this anthology, therefore, is on non-Western\nand European works, with only the British authors who were the most influential to European and non-Western au-\nthors (such as Shakespeare, whose works have influenced authors around the world to the present day). In a world\nliterature class, there is no way that a student can be equally familiar with all of the societies, contexts, time periods,\ncultures, religions, and languages that they will encounter; even though the works presented here are translated,\ni Compact Anthology of World Literature\nstudents will face issues such as unfamiliar names and parts of the story (such as puns) that may not translate well\nor at all. Since these stories are rooted in their cultures and time periods, it is necessary to know the basic context of\neach work to understand the expectations of the original audience. The introductions in this anthology are meant\nto be just that: a basic overview of what students need to know before they begin reading, with topics that students\ncan research further. An open access literature textbook cannot be a history book at the same time, but history is\nthe great companion of literature: The more history students know, the easier it is for them to interpret literature.\nThese works can help students understand the present, as well. In an electronic age, with this text available to\nanyone with computer access around the world, it has never been more necessary to recognize and understand\ndifferences among nationalities and cultures. The literature in this anthology is foundational, in the sense that these\nworks influenced the authors who followed them. For Western literature, it is necessary to know something about\nthe Trojan War (and the Trojan Horse) to understand everything from literary references to them (for almost three\nthousand or so years) to why a computer virus would be named a \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d because of what it does. In India,\nthe characters in the Mahabharata and the Ramayana still show up in regular conversations, and it would be im-\npossible to read modern Indian literature without a basic knowledge of these texts, which are referenced frequently.\nChinese literature is infused with Confucian concepts, which influenced Chinese culture for thousands of years.\nThese are just a few of the examples of why these texts are important to this day, and the introductions will explain\nthe influence of each work.\nA word to the instructor: The texts have been chosen with the idea that they can be compared and contrasted,\nusing common themes. Rather than numerous (and therefore often random) choices of texts from various periods,\nthese selected works are meant to make both teaching and learning easier. Students often learn better when there is\na theme or a set of themes that they can use to make sense of the stories. For example, the differences among cul-\ntures and time periods in the definition of a hero are found throughout the anthology. As the time periods progress,\nthe type of hero changes as well: warriors in the ancient world, knights and samurai in the medieval period, and\nsoldiers in works set in the Renaissance. Many of the works examine the role of women in society, and each time\nperiod contains numerous works of social commentary. There are epics across world literature to compare, belief\nsystems from the Greek pantheon of gods to Native American origin stories, and philosophical questions about\nethical and moral behavior.\nIt is by comparing similar topics and themes that students are most easily able to see the significant differences\nin the cultures. If I ask students to discuss a work such as the Analects of Confucius, they often do not know where to\nbegin or what to say. If I ask students to suggest what would happen if Gilgamesh were dropped into the environment\nof the Analects, they immediately see the problems: Gilgamesh is not a \u201cgentleman\u201d by Confucian standards, nor does\nhe have the temperament to attract gentlemen retainers, who would expect courteous and proper behavior from him.\nWhile cultural expectations are not universal, many of the themes found in these works are. Human beings\nhave always cared about friendship, love, and finding their place in the world; we still read and watch stories of\nheroic journeys, bravery in its many forms, family relationships (good and bad), and the triumphs and tragedies of\npeople who are not so different from ourselves.\nAs an example, the following assignment is one possible way to compare the texts in the Ancient World section.\nCulture Shock Essay: take a character such as Achilles and place him in a story with a culture that would be\ncompletely foreign to him (such as the Mahabharata). How would he react to the people around him, and\nwhat would they think about him\/his behavior? This topic could be mixed and matched: Hector in Gil-\ngamesh, Arjuna in the Aeneid, Aeneas in the Art of War, etc.\nAgain, by asking the students to compare cultures, it is easier for them to identify differences. Obviously, a\nsimilar type of essay would work in the medieval period and the Renaissance, and Ancient World texts could be\ncompared to medieval or Renaissance texts as the term progresses.\nA note about calendar systems: The anthology uses B.C.E. (Before Common Era) and C.E. (Common Era).\nAs a world literature text, it seeks to be as inclusive as possible of belief systems around the world. Of course, the\nnumbering system used comes from the Christian calendar\u2019s B.C. (Before Christ) and A.D. (Anno Domini\u2014in the\nyear of our Lord); basically, Christianity is the determiner of what is Common Era and before. Since there needs to\nbe a way of comparing time periods across these cultures, and today\u2019s world uses the numbering system that stems\nfrom the Christian calendar, it is the system used throughout. It would be too unwieldy to use all of the relevant\ncalendar systems, although it is worth noting to students that they exist. For instance, 2015 C.E. is the year 5776 in\nthe Hebrew calendar, the year 4713 in the Chinese calendar, and 1436 in the Islamic calendar. For Hinduism, the\ncurrent Epoch of this cycle of the universe (which is destroyed and remade numerous times) started in 3012 B.C.E.,\nand the current Era in that Epoch started in 78 C.E. Obviously, it would be both difficult and confusing to employ\nmore than one system.\nii P a r t T h r e e\nThe Renaissance In the European context, the Renaissance is traditionally dated from Christopher Columbus reaching North\nAmerica in 1492 C.E. Of course, since Columbus thought that he had reached the East Indies (from which mistake\nthe native peoples of the Americas came to be called \u201cIndians\u201d), it wasn\u2019t until 1513 C.E., when the conquistador\nBalboa crossed the isthmus of Panama and saw the Pacific Ocean, that Europeans began to grasp fully the enormity\nof what had been discovered: two continents about which they knew nothing. In some ways, the European perspec-\ntive of the world had just turned upside down. Everything that was \u201cknown\u201d before could potentially be questioned,\nleading to various reactions in literature: Throw rules to the wind (as Francois Rabelais does in his Gargantua and\nPantagruel), speculate about the ways that society could\u2014or should\u2014change (as Miguel de Cervantes does in\nhis Don Quixote and Thomas More does in his Utopia), or try to explain the New World in the context of the Old\nWorld (as Shakespeare does in The Tempest).\nAs mentioned in Part Two, the Renaissance is a European concept at its heart: the re-naissance (re-birth) of\nclassical Greek and Roman literature and culture. There is a certain egotism in naming one\u2019s own time period, but\neven more so in naming the previous time period: According to Renaissance writers, everything after the classical\nperiod and before the Renaissance is that stuff in the middle\u2014the Middle Ages. Such a perspective tells us very lit-\ntle about medieval authors, but it reveals a great deal about Renaissance writers. The world is always changing, but\nthe \u201cworld upside down\u201d concept separates the time periods. In Machiavelli\u2019s The Prince, the author asserts that the\nuncertainty of the times call for a strong (dictatorial) leader, who will impose order. In Cervantes\u2019 Don Quixote, the\ntitle character attempts to be a knight in shining armor to restore order. Although presented as insane, Don Quix-\note\u2019s actions\u2014to help the weak and defend the good\u2014take place in an environment where helping others seems\nold-fashioned. The critique of society is a biting one.\nCulturally, Europe saw several important changes, including the widespread use of the printing press (with the\naccompanying rise in literacy rates). The availability of books made possible the idea of a Renaissance man, cel-\nebrated by Rabelais and others. Guns and cannons altered the landscape for a hero; since bullets could penetrate\na knight\u2019s armor, soldiers began to take center stage. As Cervantes writes about someone clinging to the ideals of\nknighthood, he himself lived in a world where he was shot in the hand during the Battle of Lepanto.\nWorldwide, the spread of books and writing led to the recording of oral stories. Since the stories had been in\ncirculation for a long time before they were written down, there is very little that is Renaissance about these works\nby the European definition. The act of writing them down, however, sometimes was itself a world upside down\nexperience, since the means of recording the stories came from outside cultures. In Guatemala, the Popol Vuh\nsurvived as a written document because Christian missionaries were teaching the Mayans to translate the Bible;\ninstead, one scribe used the new writing system to preserve the Mayan origin story. In Africa, the Epic of Sundiata\/\nSonjara may have been first recorded during the Renaissance, but it still exists as an oral story to the present day. In\nAsia, the Renaissance time period does not correspond particularly well with the dates of the various literary move-\nments, which continued to focus on poetry and the emerging genres of prose narratives and drama.\nFor Students:\nThe works in this section are meant to be compared and contrasted. Consider the following questions while reading:\n\u2022 What views of the New World and the Old World do we find in Renaissance literature? What do we learn\nabout the writers who present those views?\n\u2022 How does the definition of leadership change in works such as The Prince, Hamlet, and Don Quixote?\n\u2022 What do we learn about heroism in the Renaissance? How has it changed?\n\u2022 What concepts of morality do we find in Gargantua and Pantagruel, Hamlet, and The Prince?\nThe texts also can be compared and contrasted with earlier time periods:\n\u2022 What are the differences among ancient world warriors, medieval knights, and Renaissance soldiers? How\ndoes that affect the Renaissance definition of a hero?\n\u2022 How has the view of authority (and authority figures) changed from the Ancient World to the Renaissance?\n\u2022 How has the role of women in society changed over time in these works? In what ways has it not changed?\n\u2022 Culture shock: How would Hamlet react if he were dropped into the Iliad? What would the characters in the\nIliad think about him, and why? How would the situation change if Hamlet were dropped into the Tale of Genji?\nWritten by Laura J. Getty 10\nKorea\nThis chapter introduces two prominent examples from the Joseon (also spelled as Chos\u014fn) Dynasty (1392-\n1897) in Korea: the Korean indigenous poetic form called \u201csijo\u201d and The Tale of Hong Gil-Dong (1612), one of the\nfirst novels written in Hangeul (also spelled \u201cHangul\u201d), the Korean alphabet. Joseon, a Confucian society that lasted\nfor about five centuries, was the last dynasty before Korea\u2019s modernization.\nIn Joseon literature, what is notable is the invention (1443) and promulgation (1446) of Hangeul, the Korean\nalphabet, by Sejong the Great, the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty, who reigned from 1418 to 1450. Before Han-\ngeul, Koreans did not have an indigenous written system that matched their oral language, and mostly borrowed\nChinese letters for writing. After the popularization of Hangeul, however, Korean indigenous literature in Korean\nblossomed.\nThe Joseon Dynasty was also a monarchial society based on a class system that consisted of yangban (\u201cnoble\nmen,\u201d such as scholars, landlords, rulers, and generals), jung-in (professionals, such as doctors, mathematicians, and\ntranslators), sang-in (merchants), and nobi (servants) in order of hierarchy from top to bottom. Furthermore, while\nit allowed patriarchal polygamy, the Confucian Joseon Dynasty limited the rights of the concubines and their\nchildren in inheritance and opportunities for social mobility. The Tale of Hong Gil-Dong deals with this social\ncontradiction and focuses on social discriminations against, and condescension for, the children of concubines.\nThere has been inconsistency in the Romanization of the\nKorean language. Before 2000, the McCune-Reischauer system\nwas the official system for South Korea. South Korea adopted the\nRevised Romanization of Korean in 2000, but there is still some\ninconsistency because some people continued to use the previous\nsystem or do not consult a standardized system. In this chapter,\nthe 2000 Revised Romanization of Korean is used, but some other\ncommon variations are indicated.\nAs you read, consider the following questions:\n\u2022 Select and examine a theme in a sijo poem. What idea\ndoes it suggest, and what surprising twist does it display at\nthe end? If you detect any humor or wit, can you explain\nthose elements as well?\n\u2022 Because sijo blossomed during the Joseon Dynasty, which\nofficially adopted Confucianism, some traditional sijo\nreflect Confucian themes, such as loyalty.

It is the best\nexample of Korean indigenous poetry and is comparable to other poetic traditions, especially those in East Asia.\nThe sijo is a three-line Korean poetic form, traditionally meant to be sung and recited, dealing with various\nthemes, such as the philosophical, pastoral, and personal. The first line is usually written in a 3-4-4-4 syllable\npattern and introduces an idea. The second line is usually written in a 3-4-4-4 syllable pattern and develops the idea.\n6 Sijo Poetry\nImage 10.3: \u201cA Beautiful Woman\u201d\n| A picture by Sin Yunbok, a famous\npainter of the Joseon dynasty.

Heo Gyun\nwas an unorthodox thinker. Despite the Confucian state ideology of the Joseon Dynasty, he developed interests in\nBuddhism, Taoism, and possibly even Catholicism.

N. Allen\nPart 1\nDuring the reign of the third king in Korea there lived a noble of high rank and noted family, by name Hong.\nHis title was Ye Cho Pansa. He had two sons by his wife and one by one of his concubines. The latter son was very\n8 The Tale of Hong Gil-Dong\nremarkable from his birth to his death, and he it is who forms the subject of this history.\nWhen Hong Pansa was the father of but two sons, he dreamed by night on one occasion that he heard the noise\nof thunder, and looking up he saw a huge dragon entering his apartment, which seemed too small to contain the\nwhole of his enormous body. The dream was so startling as to awaken the sleeper, who at once saw that it was a\ngood omen, and a token to him of a blessing about to be conferred. He hoped the blessing might prove to be anoth-\ner son, and went to impart the good news to his wife. She would not see him, however, as she was offended by his\ntaking a concubine from the class of \u201cdancing girls.\u201d The great man was sad, and went away. Within the year, how-\never, a son of marvelous beauty was born to one concubine, much to the annoyance of his wife and to himself, for\nhe would have been glad to have the beautiful boy a full son, and eligible to office. The child was named Gil-Dong,\nor Hong Gil-Dong. He grew fast, and became more and more beautiful. He learned rapidly, and surprised every one\nby his remarkable ability. As he grew up he rebelled at being placed with the slaves, and at not being allowed to call\nhis parent, father. The other children laughed and jeered at him, and made life very miserable. He refused longer\nto study of the duties of children to their parents. He upset his table in school, and declared he was going to be a\nsoldier. One bright moonlight night Hong Pansa saw his son in the courtyard practicing the arts of the soldier, and\nhe asked him what it meant. Gil-Dong answered that he was fitting himself to become a man that people should\nrespect and fear. He said he knew that heaven had made all things for the use of men, if they found themselves\ncapable of using them, and that the laws of men were only made to assist a few that could not otherwise do as they\nwould; but that he was not inclined to submit to any such tyranny, but would become a great man in spite of his evil\nsurroundings. \u201cThis is a most remarkable boy,\u201d mused Hong Pansa.\n\u201cWhat a pity that he is not my proper and legitimate son, that he might be an honor to my name. As it is, I fear\nhe will cause me serious trouble.\u201d He urged the boy to go to bed and sleep, but Gil-Dong said it was useless, that if\nhe went to bed he would think of his troubles till the tears washed sleep away from his eyes, and caused him to get\nup.\nThe wife of Hong Pansa and his other concubine (the dancing girl), seeing how much their lord and master\nthought of Gil-Dong, grew to hate the latter intensely, and began to lay plans for ridding themselves of him. They\ncalled some mootang, or sorceresses, and explained to them that their happiness was disturbed by this son of a\nrival, and that peace could only be restored to their hearts by the death of this youth. The witches laughed and said:\n\u201cNever mind. There is an old woman who lives by the east gate, tell her to come and prejudice the father. She can do\nit, and be will then look after his son.\u201d\nThe old hag came as requested. Hong Pansa was then in the women\u2019s apartments, telling them of the wonderful\nboy, much to their annoyance. A visitor was announced, and the old woman made a low7 bow outside. Hong Pansa\nasked her what her business was, and she stated that she had heard of his wonderful son, and came to see him, to\nforetell what his future was to be.\nGil-Dong came as called, and on seeing him the hag bowed and said: \u201cSend out all of the people.\u201d She then stat-\ned: \u201cThis will be a very great man; if not a king, he will be greater than the king, and will avenge his early wrongs by\nkilling all his family.\u201d At this the father called to her to stop, and enjoined strict secrecy upon her. He sent Gil-Dong\nat once to a strong room, and had him locked in for safe keeping.\nThe boy was very sad at this new state of affairs, but as his father let him have books, he got down to hard study,\nand learned the Chinese works on astronomy. He could not see his mother, and his unnatural father was too afraid\nto come near him. He made up his mind, however, that as soon as he could get out he would go to some far off\ncountry, where he was not known, and make his true power felt.\nMeanwhile, the unnatural father was kept in a state of continual excitement by his wicked concubine, who was\nbent on the destruction of the son of her rival, and kept constantly before her master the great dangers that would\ncome to him from being the parent of such a man as Gil-Dong was destined to be, if allowed to live. She showed\nhim that such power as the boy was destined to possess, would eventually result in his overthrows!, and with him\nhis father\u2019s house would be in disgrace, and, doubtless, would be abolished. While if this did not happen, the son\nwas sure to kill his family, so that, in either ease, it was the father\u2019s clear duty to prevent any further trouble by\nputting the boy out of the way. Hong Pansa was finally persuaded that his concubine was right, and sent for the\nassassins to come and kill his son. But % spirit filled the father with disease, and he told the men to stay their work.\nMedicines failed to cure the disease, and the mootang women were called in by the concubine. They beat their\ndrums and danced about the room, conjuring the spirit to leave, but it would not obey. At last they said, at the sug-\ngestion of the concubine, that Gil-Dong was the cause of the disorder, and that with his death the spirit would cease\ntroubling the father.\nAgain the assassins were sent for, and came with their swords, accompanied by the old hag from the east gate.\nWhile they were meditating on the death of Gil-Dong, he was musing on the unjust laws of men who allowed sons\nto be born of concubines, but denied them rights that were enjoyed by other men.\n9 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nPart 2\nWhile thus musing in the darkness of the night, he heard a crow caw three times and fly away. \u201cThis means\nsomething ill to me,\u201d thought he; and Just then his window was thrown open, and in stepped the assassins. They\nmade at the boy, but he was not there. In their rage they wounded each other, and killed the old woman who was\ntheir guide. To their amazement the room had disappeared, and they were surrounded by high mountains. A\nmighty storm arose, and rocks flew through the air. They could not escape, and, in their terror, were about to give\nup, when music was heard, and a boy came riding by on a donkey, playing a flute. He took away their weapons, and\nshowed himself to be Gil-Dong. He promised not to kill them, as they begged for their lives, but only on condition\nthat they should never try to kill another man. He told them that he would know if the promise was broken, and, in\nthat event, he would instantly kill them.\nGil-Dong went by night to see his father, who thought him a spirit, and was very much afraid. He gave his\nfather medicine, which instantly cured him; and sending for his mother, bade her good-by, and started for an un-\nknown country.\nHis father was very glad that the boy had escaped, and lost his affection for his wicked concubine. But the latter,\nwith her mistress, was very angry, and tried in vain to devise some means to accomplish their evil purposes.\nGil-Dong, free at last journeyed to the south. and began to ascend the lonely mountains. Tigers were abundant,\nbut he feared them not, and they seemed to avoid molesting him. After many days, he found himself high up on a\nbarren peat enveloped by the clouds and enjoyed the remoteness of the place, and the absence of men and obnox-\nious laws. He now felt himself a free man, and the equal of any, while he knew that heaven was smiling upon him\nand giving him powers not accorded to other men.\nThrough the clouds at some distance he thought he espied a huge stone door in the bare wall of rock. Going up\nto it, he found it to be indeed a movable door, and, opening it, he stepped inside, when, to his amazement, he found\nhimself in an open plain, surrounded by high and inaccessible mountains. He saw before him over two hundred\ngood houses, and many men, who, when they had somewhat recovered from their own surprise, came rushing\nupon him, apparently with evil intent. Laying hold upon him they asked him who he was, and why he came tres-\npassing upon their ground. He said: \u201cI am surprised to find myself in the presence of men. I am but the son of a\nconcubine, and men, with their laws, are obnoxious to me. Therefore, I thought to get away from man entirely, and,\nfor that reason, I wandered alone into these wild regions. But who are you, and why do you live in this lone spot?\nPerhaps we may have a kindred feeling.\u201d\n\u201cWe are called thieves,\u201d was answered; \u201cbut we only despoil the hated official class of some of their ill-gotten\ngains. We are willing to help the poor unbeknown, but no man can enter our stronghold and depart alive, unless he\nhas become one of us. To do so, however, he must prove himself to be strong in body and mind. If you can pass the\nexamination and wish to join our party, well and good; otherwise you die.\u201d\nThis suited Gil-Dong immensely, and he consented to the conditions. They gave him various trials of strength, but\nhe chose his own. Going up to a huge rock on which several men were seated, he laid hold of it and hurled it to some\ndistance, to the dismay of the men, who fell from their seat, and to the surprised delight of all. He was at once installed\na member, and a feast was ordered. The contract was sealed by mingling blood from the lips of all the members with\nblood similarly supplied by Gil-Dong. He was then given a prominent seat and served to wine and food.\nGil-Dong soon became desirous of giving to his comrades some manifestation of his courage. An opportunity\npresently offered. He heard the men bemoaning their inability to despoil a large and strong Buddhist temple not\nfar distant As was the rule, this temple in the mountains was well patronized by officials, who made it a place of\nretirement for pleasure and debauch, and in return the lazy, licentious priests were allowed to collect tribute from\nthe poor people about, till they had become rich and powerful. The several attempts made by the robber band had\nproved unsuccessful, by virtue of the number and vigilance of the priests, together with the strength of their enclo-\nsure. Gil-Dong agreed to assist them to accomplish their design or perish in the attempt, and such was their faith in\nhim that they readily agreed to his plans.\nOn a given day Gil-Dong, dressed in the red gown of a youth, just betrothed, covered himself with the dust of\ntravel, and mounted on a donkey, with one robber disguised as a servant, made his way to the temple. He asked on\narrival to be shown to the head priest, to whom he stated that he was the son of Hong Pansa, that his noble father\nhaving heard of the greatness of this temple, and the wisdom of its many priests, had decided to send him with a\nletter, which he produced, to be educated among their numbers. He also stated that a train of one hundred ponies\nloaded with rice had been sent as a present from his father to the priest, and he expected they would arrive before\ndark, as they did not wish to stop alone in the mountains, even though every pony was attended by a groom, who\nwas armed for defense. The priests were delighted, and having read the letter, they never for a moment suspected\nthat all was not right. A great feast was ordered in honor of their noble scholar, and all sat down before the tables,\nwhich were filled so high that one could hardly see his neighbor on the opposite side. They had scarcely seated\nthemselves and indulged in the generous wine, when it was announced that the train of ponies laden with rice\n10 Image 10.4: Hong Gil-Dong jeon | The first pages of a Korean Hong Gil-Dong novel.\nAuthor: Heo Gyun\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nThe Tale of Hong Gil-Dong\nhad arrived. Servants were sent to look after the tribute, and the eating and drinking went on. Suddenly Gil-Dong\nclapped his hand, over his cheek with a cry of pain, which drew the attention of all. When, to the great mortification\nof the priests, he produced from his month a pebble, previously introduced on the sly, and exclaimed: \u201cIs it to feed\non stones that my father sent me to this place? What do yon mean by setting such rice before a gentleman?\u201d\nPart 3\nThe priests were filled with mortification and dismay, and bowed their shaven heads to the floor in humiliation.\nWhen at a sign from Gil-Dong, a portion of the robbers, who had entered the court as grooms to the ponies, seized\nthe bending priests and bound them as they were. The latter shouted for help, but the other robbers, who had been\nconcealed in the bags, which were supposed to contain rice, seized the servants, while others were loading the po-\nnies with jewels, rice, cash and whatever of value they could lay hands upon.\nAn old priest who was attending to the fires, seeing the uproar, made off quietly to the yamen near by and called\nfor soldiers. The soldiers were sent after some delay, and Gil-Dong, disguised as a priest, called to them to follow him\ndown a by-path after the robbers. While he conveyed the soldiers over this rough path, the robbers made good their\nescape by the main road, and were soon joined in their stronghold by their youthful leader, who had left the soldiers\ngroping helplessly in the dark among the rocks and trees in a direction opposite that taken by the robbers.\nThe priests soon found out that they had lost almost all their riches, and were at no loss in determining how the\nskilful affair had been planned and carried out. Gil-Dong\u2019s name was noised abroad, and it was soon known that\nhe was heading a band of robbers, who, through his assistance, were able to do many marvelous things. The robber\nband was delighted at the success of his first undertaking, and made him their chief, with the consent of all. After\nsufficient time had elapsed for the full enjoyment of their last and greatest success, Gil-Dong planned a new raid.\nThe Governor of a neighboring province was noted for his overbearing ways and the heavy burdens that he laid\nupon his subjects. He was very rich, but universally hated, and Gil-Dong decided to avenge the people and humili-\nate the Governor, knowing that his work would be appreciated by the people, as were indeed his acts at the temple.\nHe instructed his band to proceed singly to the Governor\u2019s city\u2014the local capital\u2014at the time of a fair, when their\ncoming would not cause comment. At a given time a portion of them were to set fire to a lot of straw-thatched huts\noutside the city gates, while the others repaired in a body to the Governor\u2019s yamen. They did so. The Governor\nwas borne in his chair to a place where he could witness the conflagration, which also drew away the most of the\ninhabitants. The robbers bound the remaining servants, and while some were securing money, jewels, and weapons,\nGil-Dong wrote on the walls: \u201cThe wicked Governor that robs the people is relieved of his ill-gotten gains by Gil-\nDong\u2014the people\u2019s avenger.\u201d\nAgain the thieves made good their escape, and Gil-Dong\u2019s name became known everywhere.\nThe Governor offered a great reward for his capture, but no one seemed desirous of encountering a robber of\nsuch boldness. At last the King offered a reward after consulting with his officers. When one of them said he would\ncapture the thief alone, the King was astonished at his boldness and courage, and bade him be off and make the\nattempt. The officer was called the Pochang; he had charge of the prisons, and was a man of great courage.\nThe Pochang started on his search, disguised as a traveler. He took a donkey and servant, and after travelling\nmany days he put up at a little inn, at the same time that another man on a donkey rode up. The latter was Gil-Dong\nin disguise, and he soon entered into conversation with the man, whose mission was known to him.\n\u201cI goo\u201d said Gil-Dong, as he sat down to eat, \u201cthis is a dangerous country. I have just been chased by the robber\nGil-Dong till the life is about gone out of me.\u201d\n\u201cGil-Dong, did yon say?\u201d remarked Pochang. \u201cI wish he would chase me. I am anxious to see the man of whom\nwe hear so much.\u201d\n\u201cWell, if you see him once you will be satisfied,\u201d replied Gil-Dong.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked the Pochang. \u201cIs he such a fearful-looking man as to frighten one by his aspect alone?\u201d\n\u201cNo; on the contrary he looks much as do ordinary mortals. But we know he is different, you see.\u201d\n\u201cExactly,\u201d said the Pochang. \u201cThat is just the trouble. You are afraid of him before you see him. Just let me get a\nglimpse of him, and matters will be different, I think.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Gil-Dong, \u201cyou can be easily pleased, if that is all, for I dare say if you go back into the mountains\nhere you will see him, and get acquainted with him too.\u201d\n\u201cThat is good. Will you show me the place?\u201d\n\u201cNot I. I have seen enough of him to please me. I can tell you where to go, however, if you persist in your curi-\nosity,\u201d said the robber.\n\u201cAgreed!\u201d exclaimed the officer. \u201cLet us be off at once lest he escapes. And if you succeed in showing him to me,\nI will reward you for your work and protect you from the thief.\u201d\nAfter some objection by Gil-Dong, who appeared to be reluctant to go, and insisted on at least finishing his\ndinner, they started off, with their servants, into the mountains. Night overtook them, much to the apparent dismay\n11 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nof the guide, who pretended to be very anxious to give up the quest. At length, however, they came to the stone\ndoor, which was open. Having entered the robber\u2019s stronghold, the door closed behind them, and the guide dis-\nappeared, leaving the dismayed officer surrounded by the thieves. His courage had now left him, and he regretted\nhis rashness. The robbers bound him securely and led him past their miniature city into an enclosure surrounded\nby houses which, by their bright colors, seemed to be the abode of royalty. He was conveyed into a large audi-\nence-chamber occupying the most extensive building of the collection, and there, on a sort of throne, in royal style,\nsat his guide. The Pochang saw his mistake, and fell on his face, begging for mercy. Gil-Dong upbraided him for his\nimpudence and arrogance and promised to let him off this time, Wine was brought, and all partook of it. That given\nto the officer was drugged, and he fell into a stupor soon after drinking it. While in this condition he was put into a\nbag and conveyed in a marvelous manner to a high mountain overlooking the capital. Here he found himself upon\nrecovering from the effects of his potion; and not daring to face his sovereign with such a fabulous tale, he cast\nhimself down from the high mountain, and was picked up dead, by passers-by, in the morning. Almost at the same\ntime that His Majesty received word of the death of his officer, and was marveling at the audacity of the murderer in\nbringing the body almost to the palace doors, came simultaneous reports of great depredations in each of the eight\nprovinces. The trouble was in each case attributed to Gil-Dong, and the fact that he was reported as being in eight\nfar removed places at the same time caused great consternation.\nPart 4\nOfficial orders were issued to each of the eight governors to catch and bring to the city, at once, the robber\nGil-Dong. These orders were so well obeyed that upon a certain day soon after, a guard came from each province\nbringing Gil-Dong, and there in a line stood eight men alike in every respect.\nThe King on inquiry found that Gil-Dong was the son of Hong Pansa, and the father was ordered into the royal\npresence. He came with his legitimate son, and bowed his head in shame to the ground. When asked what he meant\nby having a son who would cause such general misery and distress, he swooned away, and would have died had\nnot one of the Gil-Dongs produced some medicine which cured him. The son, however, acted as spokesman, and\ninformed the King that Gil-Dong was but the son of his father\u2019s slave, that he was utterly incorrigible, and had fled\nfrom home when a mere boy. When asked to decide as to which was his true son, the father stated that his son had\na scar on the left thigh. Instantly each of the eight men pulled up the baggy trousers and displayed a soar. The guard\nwas commanded to remove the men and kill all of them: but when they attempted to do so the life had disappeared,\nand the men were found to be only figures in straw and wax.\nSoon after this a letter was seen posted on the Palace gate, announcing that if the government would confer\nupon Gil-Dong the rank of Pansa, as held by his father, and thus remove from him the stigma attaching; to him as\nthe son of a slave, he would stop his depredations. This proposition could not be entertained at first, but one of the\ncounsel suggested that it might offer a solution of the vexed question, and they could yet be spared the disgrace of\nhaving an officer with such a record. For, as he proposed, men could be so stationed that when the newly-appointed\nofficer came to make his bow before His Majesty, they could fall upon him and kill him before he arose. This plan\nwas greeted with applause, and a decree was issued conferring the desired rank; proclamations to that effect being\nposted in public places, so that the news would reach Gil-Dong. It did reach him, and he soon appeared at the city\ngate. A great crowd attended him as he rode to the Palace gates; but knowing the plans laid for him, as he passed\nthrough the gates and came near enough to be seen of the King, he was caught up in a cloud and borne away amid\nstrange music; wholly discomfiting his enemies.\nSome time after this occurrence the King was walking with a few eunuchs and attendants in the royal gardens. It\nwas evening time, but the full moon furnished ample light. The atmosphere was tempered just to suit; it was neither\ncold nor warm, while it lacked nothing of the bracing character of a Korean autumn. The leaves were blood-red on\nthe maples; the heavy cloak of climbing vines that enshrouded the great wall near by was also beautifully colored.\nThese effects could even be seen by the bright moonlight, and seated on a hill-side the royal party were enjoying the\ntranquility of the scene, when all were astonished by the sound of a flute played by some one up above them. Looking\nup among the tree-tops a man was seen descending toward them, seated upon the back of a gracefully moving stork.\nThe King imagined it must be some heavenly being, and ordered the chief eunuch to make some proper salutation.\nBut before this could be done, a voice was heard saying: \u201cFear not, O King. I am simply Hong Pansa (Gil-Dong\u2019s new\ntitle). I have come to make my obeisance before your august presence and be confirmed in my rank.\u201d\nThis he did, and no one attempted to molest him; seeing which, the King, feeling that it was useless longer to\nattempt to destroy a man who could read the unspoken thoughts of men, said:\n\u201cWhy do you persist in troubling the country ? I have removed from you now the stigma attached to your birth.\nWhat more will you have?\u201d\n\u201cI wish,\u201d said Gil-Dong, with due humility, \u201cto go to a distant laud, and settle down to the pursuit of peace and\nhappiness. If I may be granted three thousand bags of rice I will gladly go and trouble you no longer.\u201d\n12 The Tale of Hong Gil-Dong\n\u201cBut how will you transport such an enormous quantity of rice?\u201d asked the King.\n\u201cThat can be arranged,\u201d said Gil-Dong. \u201cIf I may be but granted the order, I will remove the rice at daybreak.\u201d\nThe order was given. Gil-Dong went away as he came, and in the early morning a fleet of junks appeared off the\nroyal granaries, took on the rice, and made away before the people were well aware of their presence.\nGil-Dong now sailed for an island off the west coast. He found one uninhabited, and with his few followers he\nstored his riches, and brought many articles of value from his former hiding-places. His people be taught to till the\nsoil, and all went well on the little island till the master made a trip to a neighboring island, which was famous for\nits deadly mineral poison\u2014a thing much prized for tipping the arrows with. Gil-Dong wanted to get some of this\npoison, and made a visit to the island. While passing through the settled districts he casually noticed that many\ncopies of a proclamation were posted up, offering a large reward to any one who would succeed In restoring to her\nfather a young lady who had been stolen by a band of savage people who lived in the mountains.\nGil-Dong journeyed on all day, and at night he found himself high up in the wild mountain regions, where the\npoison was abundant. Gazing about in making some preparations for passing the night in this place, he saw a light,\nand following it, he came to a house built below him on a ledge of rocks, and in an almost inaccessible position. He\ncould see the interior of a large hall, where were gathered many hairy, shaggy-looking men, eating, drinking, and\nsmoking. One old fellow, who seemed to be chief, was tormenting a young lady by trying to tear away her veil and\nexpose her to the gaze of the barbarians assembled. Gil-Dong could not stand this sight, and, taking a poisoned\narrow, he sent it direct for the heart of the villain, but the distance was so great that he missed his mark sufficiently\nto only wound the arm. All one of them threw aside her veil and implored for mercy. Then it was that Gil-Dong rec-\nognized the maiden whom he had rescued the previous evening. She was marvelously beautiful, and already he was\ndeeply smitten with her maidenly charms. Her voice seemed like that of an angel of peace sent to quiet the hearts of\nrough men. As she modestly begged for her life, she told the story of her capture by the robbers, and how she had\nbeen dragged away to their den, and was only saved from insult by the interposition of some heavenly being, who\nhad in pity smote the arm of her tormentor.\nGreat was Gil-Dong\u2019s joy at being able to explain his own part in the matter, and the maiden heart, already won\nby the manly beauty of her rescuer, now overflowed with gratitude and love. Remembering herself, however, she\nquickly veiled her face, but the mischief had been done; each had seen the other, and they could henceforth know\nno peace, except in each other\u2019s presence.\nThe proclamations had made but little impression upon Gil-Dong, and it was not till the lady had told her\nstory that he remembered reading them. He at once took steps to remove the beautiful girl and her companion in\ndistress, and not knowing but that other of the savages might return, he did not dare to make search for a chair and\nbearers, but mounting donkeys the little party set out for the home of the distressed parents, which they reached\nsafely in due time. The father\u2019s delight knew no bounds. He was a subject of Korea\u2019s King, yet he possessed this\nisland and ruled its people in his own right. And calling his subjects, he explained to them publicly the wonderful\nworks of the stranger, to whom he betrothed his daughter, and to whom he gave his official position.\nThe people indulged in all manner of gay festivities in honor of the return of the lost daughter of their chief; in\nrespect to the bravery of Gil-Dong; and to celebrate his advent as their ruler.\nIn due season the marriage ceremonies were celebrated, and the impatient lovers were given to each other\u2019s\nembrace. Their lives were full of happiness and prosperity. Other outlying islands were united under Gil-Dong\u2019s\nrule, and no desire or ambition remained ungratified. Yet there came a time when the husband grew sad, and tears\nswelled the heart of the young wife as she tried in vain to comfort him. He explained at last that he had a presenti-\nment that his father was either dead or dying, and that it was his duty to go and mourn at the grave. With anguish\nat the thought of parting, the wife urged him to go. Taking a junk laden with handsome marble slabs for the grave\nand statuary to surround it, and followed by junks bearing three thousand bags of rice, he set out for the capital.\nArriving, be cut off his hair, and repaired to his old Louie, where a servant admitted him on the supposition that\nhe was a priest. He found his father was no more; but the body yet remained, because a suitable place could not be\nfound for the burial. Thinking him to be a priest, Gil-Dong was allowed to select the spot, and the burial took place\nwith due ceremony. Then it was that the son revealed himself, and took his place with the mourners. The stone im-\nages and monuments were erected upon the nicely sodded grounds. Gil-Dong sent the rice he had brought, to the\ngovernment granaries in return for the King\u2019s loan to him, and regretted that mourning would prevent his paying\nhis respects to his King; he set out for his home with his true mother and his father\u2019s legal wife. The latter did not\nsurvive long after the death of her husband, but the poor slave-mother of the bright boy was spared many years to\nenjoy the peace and quiet of her son\u2019s bright home, and to be ministered to by her dutiful, loving children and their\nnumerous offspring.\n13 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n14 11\nEurope\nThe Renaissance in Europe refers to a period between the Middle Ages and the Modern period. Although\ndifferent parts of Europe experienced the Renaissance at different times in their own unique ways, it can be said that\nit roughly ranges from the fourteenth century to the seventeenth century.\nRather than having a clear demarcation from the previous and later\nperiods, it converges with the later phase of the Middle Ages (ranging\nfrom the fifth century to the fifteenth century) and with a large part of the\nEarly Modern period (ranging from 1450 C.E. to 1750 C.E.).\nAs the literal meaning of renaissance, \u201crebirth,\u201d indicates, the Eu-\nropean Renaissance was a period of a renewed interest in the Classical\nworld of Greece and Rome and the intellectual movement called human-\nism. In humanism, secular scholars sought to help humans break free\nfrom the mental restrictions based on religious orthodoxy, to encourage\nfree intellectual investigation, and to empower the potential of human\nthinking and creativity. This development first began in Italy and influ-\nenced all parts of Europe. Other major changes include the decline of the\nfeudal system, the growth of commerce, and the applications of innova-\ntions such as paper, printing, gunpowder, and the mariner\u2019s compass. The\ninvention of metal movable type (c. 1450 C.E.) is generally credited to\nJohannes Gutenberg; with the invention of printing came increased liter-\nacy and the development of vernacular literature. The Protestant Refor-\nmation led by Martin Luther presented a new form of Christianity that\nfocuses on the individual\u2019s inner experiences, and it also brought out\nCounter-Reformation in Catholic countries. Renaissance Europe also\nmade great strides in exploring new continents. Christopher Colum-\nbus arrived in America in 1492, which led to the far-reaching conse-\nquences of establishing European overseas empires. For example, Spain Image 11.1: Italy 1494 | A map of national\nboundaries on the Italian Peninsula and parts\nunder the reign of Phillip II (1556-1598 C.E.) was a powerful empire,\nof Europe, 1494 C.E.\ncontrolling many territories in Asia, Africa, and America, although it\neventually ran into bankruptcy and entered into a period of decline.\nAuthor: User \u201cCapmo\u201d\nThe selections in this chapter reflect many of the characteristics of\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nthis period.

Cervant-\nes\u2019s Don Quixote, generally regarded as the first Western novel, can be\ncompared with Rabelais\u2019s Gargantua and Pantagruel in its use of humor and satire.

(Part 1) and 1615 C.E. (Part 2)\nSpain\nDon Quixote was written by Miguel de Cervantes (Spanish novelist, playwright, and poet) and was published\nin two parts. The novel, influenced by Renaissance Humanism, was immediately popular although its literary\ngravity was only recognized later. As the prologue in part 1 of the novel states, it was conceived as a comic satire\nof chivalric romance literatures of the time. However, the novel presents multiple levels of implications beyond its\nattack on the previous literary tradition. Cervantes\u2019s diverse life experiences as a soldier, a slave, a civil servant,\nand a writer might have given him vantage points from which he could satirize different aspects of his contempo-\nrary society. In 1612, Thomas Shelton\u2019s English translation of the first part appeared, and soon Cervantes became\nwell-known beyond Spain, especially in England, France, and Italy.\nWritten by Kyounghye Kwon\n17 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nDon Quixote\nLicense: CC BY-SA 4.0\nMiguel de Cervantes [Saavedra], translated by John Ormsby\nEdited by Rhonda L.

An olla of rather\nmore beef than mutton,2 a salad on most nights, scraps on Sat-\nurdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra on Sundays,\nmade away with three-quarters of his income. The rest of it\nwent in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes\nto match for holidays, while on week-days he made a brave\nfigure in his best homespun. He had in his house a housekeep-\ner past forty, a niece under twenty, and a lad for the field and\nmarket-place, who used to saddle the hack as well as handle\nthe bill-hook. The age of this gentleman of ours was bordering\non fifty; he was of a hardy habit, spare, gaunt-featured, a very\nearly riser and a great sportsman. They will have it his sur-\nname was Quixada or Quesada (for here there is some differ-\nence of opinion among the authors who write on the subject),\nImage 11.4: Don Quixote goes mad from his read-\nalthough from reasonable conjectures it seems plain that he\ning of books of chivalry | Illustration by Gustave Dor\u00e9\nwas called Quexana.3 This, however, is of but little importance\ndepicting Don Quixote surrounded by characters from his\nto our tale; it will be enough not to stray a hair\u2019s breadth from books.\nthe truth in the telling of it.\nYou must know, then, that the above-named gentleman Author: Gustave Dor\u00e9\nwhenever he was at leisure (which was mostly all the year Source: Wikimedia Commons\nround) gave himself up to reading books of chivalry with License: Public Domain\nsuch ardour and avidity that he almost entirely neglected\nthe pursuit of his field-sports, and even the management of his property; and to such a pitch did his eagerness\nand infatuation go that he sold many an acre of tillageland to buy books of chivalry to read, and brought home as\nmany of them as he could get. But of all there were none he liked so well as those of the famous Feliciano de Silva\u2019s4\ncomposition, for their lucidity of style and complicated conceits were as pearls in his sight, particularly when in his\nreading he came upon courtships and cartels, where he often found passages like \u201cthe reason of the unreason with\nwhich my reason is afflicted so weakens my reason that with reason I murmur at your beauty;\u201d or again, \u201cthe high\nheavens, that of your divinity divinely fortify you with the stars, render you deserving of the desert your greatness\ndeserves.\u201d Over conceits of this sort the poor gentleman lost his wits, and used to lie awake striving to understand\nthem and worm the meaning out of them; what Aristotle5 himself could not have made out or extracted had he\ncome to life again for that special purpose. He was not at all easy about the wounds which Don Belianis6 gave and\ntook, because it seemed to him that, great as were the surgeons who had cured him, he must have had his face and\n1 \u201cA lean hack\u201d would be a skinny ill-bred horse.\n2 An \u201colla\u201d is a cooking pot; this pot contains beef more often than mutton, because beef is cheaper.\n3 The apparent concern for his surname is meant to draw attention to Don Quixote\u2019s physical appearance: a \u201cquixada\u201d is a jawbone,\nand, presumably, Don Quixote\u2019s was rather prominent, hence the confusion with his name.\n4 Feliciano de Silva (1491-1554) was a popular Spanish writer of chivalric romance novels. Cervantes does not intend Quixote\u2019s\nadmiration of de Silva as complimentary.\n5 Famed Greek philosopher (384-322 BCE).\n6 Don Belianis was a Spanish knight and the hero of the romance Don Belianis of Greece by Geronimo Fernandez (1632-1680). The\nnovel was a sequel of Amadis of Gaul.\n18 Don Quixote\nbody covered all over with seams and scars. He commended, however, the author\u2019s way of ending his book with the\npromise of that interminable adventure, and many a time was he tempted to take up his pen and finish it properly\nas is there proposed, which no doubt he would have done, and made a successful piece of work of it too, had not\ngreater and more absorbing thoughts prevented him.\nMany an argument did he have with the curate of his village (a learned man, and a graduate of Siguenza7) as to\nwhich had been the better knight, Palmerin of England8 or Amadis of Gaul.9 Master Nicholas, the village barber,\nhowever, used to say that neither of them came up to the Knight of Phoebus,10 and that if there was any that could\ncompare with him it was Don Galaor, the brother of Amadis of Gaul, because he had a spirit that was equal to every\noccasion, and was no finikin11 knight, nor lachrymose12 like his brother, while in the matter of valour he was not\na whit behind him. In short, he became so absorbed in his books that he spent his nights from sunset to sunrise,\nand his days from dawn to dark, poring over them; and what with little sleep and much reading his brains got so\ndry that he lost his wits. His fancy grew full of what he used to read about in his books, enchantments, quarrels,\nbattles, challenges, wounds, wooings, loves, agonies, and all sorts of impossible nonsense; and it so possessed his\nmind that the whole fabric of invention and fancy he read of was true, that to him no history in the world had more\nreality in it. He used to say the Cid Ruy Diaz was a very good knight, but that he was not to be compared with the\nKnight of the Burning Sword13 who with one back-stroke cut in half two fierce and monstrous giants. He thought\nmore of Bernardo del Carpio because at Roncesvalles he slew Roland in spite of enchantments,14 availing himself of\nthe artifice of Hercules when he strangled Antaeus the son of Terra in his arms.15 He approved highly of the giant\nMorgante,16 because, although of the giant breed which is always arrogant and ill-conditioned, he alone was affable\nand well-bred. But above all he admired Reinaldos of Montalban,17 especially when he saw him sallying forth from\nhis castle and robbing everyone he met, and when beyond the seas he stole that image of Mahomet18 which, as his\nhistory says, was entirely of gold. To have a bout of kicking at that traitor of a Ganelon19 he would have given his\nhousekeeper, and his niece into the bargain.\nIn short, his wits being quite gone, he hit upon the strangest notion that ever madman\nin this world hit upon, and that was that he fancied it was right and requisite, as well for the support of his own\nhonour as for the service of his country, that he should make a knight-errant of himself, roaming the world over\nin full armour and on horseback in quest of adventures, and putting in practice himself all that he had read of as\nbeing the usual practices of knights-errant; righting every kind of wrong, and exposing himself to peril and danger\nfrom which, in the issue, he was to reap eternal renown and fame. Already the poor man saw himself crowned by\nthe might of his arm Emperor of Trebizond20 at least; and so, led away by the intense enjoyment he found in these\npleasant fancies, he set himself forthwith to put his scheme into execution.\nThe first thing he did was to clean up some armour that had belonged to his great-grandfather, and had been\nfor ages lying forgotten in a corner eaten with rust and covered with mildew. He scoured and polished it as best\nhe could, but he perceived one great defect in it, that it had no closed helmet, nothing but a simple morion. This\ndeficiency, however, his ingenuity supplied, for he contrived a kind of half-helmet of pasteboard which, fitted on to\nthe morion, looked like a whole one. It is true that, in order to see if it was strong and fit to stand a cut, he drew his\nsword and gave it a couple of slashes, the first of which undid in an instant what had taken him a week to do. The\n7 \u201cSiguenza was one of the Universidades menores, the degrees of which were often laughed at by the Spanish humorists\u201d (Ormsby).\n8 Palmerin of England is another Amadis sequel by the Portuguese author Francisco de Moraes Cabral (1500-1572).\n9 Amadis of Gaul by Garci Rodr\u00edguez de Montalvo (1450-1504) was a Castilian chivalric romance recounting the adventures of\nAmadis, a knight errant. Amadis of Gaul is full of knights in shining armor and damsels in distress.\n10 From El caballero del Febo el troyano (The Knight of Phoebus, the Trojan) by Esteban Corbera (16th c.).\n11 Finikin: fastidious or finicky.\n12 Lachrymose: weepy; cries a lot.\n13 \u201cEl Cid\u201d (a.k.a. Rodrigo D\u00edaz de Vivar) (1043 \u2013 1099) was a legendary Castilian aristocrat and general. The Knight of the Burning\nSword is the eponymous hero of Amadis of Greece (a sequel to Amadis of Gaul) written by Silva. The joke here is that Quixote has lost touch\nwith reality to the point that he considers the fictional Amadis a greater knight than the real-life El Cid.\n14 Bernardo del Carpio, another legendary Castilian Christian knight comparable to El Cid, defended Spain against the Frankish\nEmperor Charlemagne\u2019s army at the Battle of Roncesvalles Pass; Carpio is credited with having killed the paladin Roland. A fictional account\nof that battle is recorded in the Song of Roland which notable omits the presence of the Spanish Christian forces and instead substitutes a\nMuslim army. Note that the French epic makes non-European Muslims the enemy, and the Spanish legends cast the Christian French forces\nin that role.\n15 The 11th of Hercules\u2019 12 Labors was the wrestling match with the giant Antaeus.\n16 The eponymous hero of Morgante an Italian romantic epic by Luigi Pulci (1432-1484) recounts the adventures of the giant Mor-\ngante and his friendship with Orlando (another name for Roland, Paladin of Charlemagne).\n17 Another of Charlemagne\u2019s Paladins, friend of Orlando, and character in Morgante.\n18 Mohammad, prophet of God and founder of Islam.\n19 Orlando\u2019s traitorous uncle.\n20 The Trebizond Empire followed the Byzantine Empire.\n19 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nease with which he had knocked it to pieces disconcerted him somewhat, and to guard against that danger he set to\nwork again, fixing bars of iron on the inside until he was satisfied with its strength; and then, not caring to try any\nmore experiments with it, he passed it and adopted it as a helmet of the most perfect construction.\nHe next proceeded to inspect his hack, which, with more quartos than a real and more blemishes than the steed\nof Gonela,21 that \u201ctantum pellis et ossa fuit,\u201d22 surpassed in his eyes the Bucephalus of Alexander or the Babieca of\nthe Cid.23 Four days were spent in thinking what name to give him, because (as he said to himself) it was not right\nthat a horse belonging to a knight so famous, and one with such merits of his own, should be without some dis-\ntinctive name, and he strove to adapt it so as to indicate what he had been before belonging to a knight-errant, and\nwhat he then was; for it was only reasonable that, his master taking a new character, he should take a new name,\nand that it should be a distinguished and full-sounding one, befitting the new order and calling he was about to\nfollow. And so, after having composed, struck out, rejected, added to, unmade, and remade a multitude of names\nout of his memory and fancy, he decided upon calling him Rocinante,24 a name, to his thinking, lofty, sonorous, and\nsignificant of his condition as a hack before he became what he now was, the first and foremost of all the hacks in\nthe world.\nHaving got a name for his horse so much to his taste, he was anxious to get one for himself, and he was eight\ndays more pondering over this point, till at last he made up his mind to call himself \u201cDon Quixote,\u201d whence, as has\nbeen already said, the authors of this veracious history have inferred that his name must have been beyond a doubt\nQuixada, and not Quesada as others would have it. Recollecting, however, that the valiant Amadis was not con-\ntent to call himself curtly Amadis and nothing more, but added the name of his kingdom and country to make it\nfamous, and called himself Amadis of Gaul, he, like a good knight, resolved to add on the name of his, and to style\nhimself Don Quixote of La Mancha, whereby, he considered, he described accurately his origin and country, and\ndid honour to it in taking his surname from it.\nSo then, his armour being furbished, his morion turned into a helmet, his hack christened, and he himself\nconfirmed, he came to the conclusion that nothing more was needed now but to look out for a lady to be in love\nwith; for a knight-errant without love was like a tree without leaves or fruit, or a body without a soul. As he said to\nhimself, \u201cIf, for my sins, or by my good fortune, I come across some giant hereabouts, a common occurrence with\nknights-errant, and overthrow him in one onslaught, or cleave him asunder to the waist, or, in short, vanquish and\nsubdue him, will it not be well to have some one I may send him to as a present, that he may come in and fall on his\nknees before my sweet lady, and in a humble, submissive voice say, \u2018I am the giant Caraculiambro, lord of the island\nof Malindrania,25 vanquished in single combat by the never sufficiently extolled knight Don Quixote of La Mancha,\nwho has commanded me to present myself before your Grace, that your Highness dispose of me at your pleasure\u2019?\u201d\nOh, how our good gentleman enjoyed the delivery of this speech, especially when he had thought of some one to\ncall his Lady! There was, so the story goes, in a village near his own a very good-looking farm-girl with whom he\nhad been at one time in love, though, so far as is known, she never knew it nor gave a thought to the matter. Her\nname was Aldonza Lorenzo,26 and upon her he thought fit to confer the title of Lady of his Thoughts; and after\nsome search for a name which should not be out of harmony with her own, and should suggest and indicate that of\na princess and great lady, he decided upon calling her Dulcinea del Toboso\u2014she being of El Toboso\u2014a name, to\nhis mind, musical, uncommon, and significant, like all those he had already bestowed upon himself and the things\nbelonging to him.\nCHAPter II.\nWHICH TREATS OF THE FIRST SALLY THE INGENIOUS DON QUIXOTE MADE FROM HOME\nThese preliminaries settled, he did not care to put off any longer the execution of his design, urged on to it by\nthe thought of all the world was losing by his delay, seeing what wrongs he intended to right, grievances to redress,\ninjustices to repair, abuses to remove, and duties to discharge. So, without giving notice of his intention to anyone,\nand without anybody seeing him, one morning before the dawning of the day (which was one of the hottest of the\nmonth of July) he donned his suit of armour, mounted Rocinante with his patched-up helmet on, braced his buck-\nler, took his lance, and by the back door of the yard sallied forth upon the plain in the highest contentment and sat-\nisfaction at seeing with what ease he had made a beginning with his grand purpose. But scarcely did he find himself\n21 \u201cGonela, or Gonnella, was a jester in the service of Borso, Duke of Ferrara (1450-1470). A book of the jests attributed to him was\nprinted in 1568, the year before Cervantes went to Italy\u201d (Ormsby).\n22 tantum pellis et fossa fuit: \u201cit was all skin and bones\u201d.\n23 Bucephalus and Babieca were the war horses of Alexander the Great and El Cid.\n24 \u201cRocin\u201d is Spanish for \u201chack\u201d (a work-horse; less valuable than a show-horse or a war-horse); \u201cante\u201d means \u201cbefore\u201d or \u201conce\u201d; thus\nRocinante means \u201cused to be a hack\u201d of \u201cformerly a hack\u201d.\n25 Names made up by Don Quixote.\n26 A peasant known to be strong and sturdy. In renaming her Dulcinea (Sweet Lady), Don Quixote idealizes her as a dainty noble-\nwoman.\n20 Don Quixote\nupon the open plain, when a terrible thought struck him, one all but enough to make him abandon the enterprise at\nthe very outset. It occurred to him that he had not been dubbed a knight, and that according to the law of chivalry\nhe neither could nor ought to bear arms against any knight; and that even if he had been, still he ought, as a nov-\nice knight, to wear white armour, without a device upon the shield until by his prowess he had earned one. These\nreflections made him waver in his purpose, but his craze being stronger than any reasoning, he made up his mind\nto have himself dubbed a knight by the first one he came across, following the example of others in the same case,\nas he had read in the books that brought him to this pass. As for white armour, he resolved, on the first opportunity,\nto scour his until it was whiter than an ermine; and so comforting himself he pursued his way, taking that which his\nhorse chose, for in this he believed lay the essence of adventures.\nThus setting out, our new-fledged adventurer paced along, talking to himself and saying, \u201cWho knows but that\nin time to come, when the veracious history of my famous deeds is made known, the sage who writes it, when he\nhas to set forth my first sally in the early morning, will do it after this fashion? \u2018Scarce had the rubicund Apollo\nspread o\u2019er the face of the broad spacious earth the golden threads of his bright hair, scarce had the little birds of\npainted plumage attuned their notes to hail with dulcet and mellifluous harmony the coming of the rosy Dawn,\nthat, deserting the soft couch of her jealous spouse, was appearing to mortals at the gates and balconies of the\nManchegan horizon, when the renowned knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, quitting the lazy down, mounted his\ncelebrated steed Rocinante and began to traverse the ancient and famous Campo de Montiel;\u2019\u201d which in fact he was\nactually traversing. \u201cHappy the age, happy the time,\u201d he continued, \u201cin which shall be made known my deeds of\nfame, worthy to be moulded in brass, carved in marble, limned in pictures, for a memorial for ever. And thou, O\nsage magician, whoever thou art, to whom it shall fall to be the chronicler of this wondrous history, forget not, I en-\ntreat thee, my good Rocinante, the constant companion of my ways and wanderings.\u201d Presently he broke out again,\nas if he were love-stricken in earnest, \u201cO Princess Dulcinea, lady of this captive heart, a grievous wrong hast thou\ndone me to drive me forth with scorn, and with inexorable obduracy banish me from the presence of thy beauty. O\nlady, deign to hold in remembrance this heart, thy vassal, that thus in anguish pines for love of thee.\u201d\nSo he went on stringing together these and other absurdities, all in the style of those his books had taught him,\nimitating their language as well as he could; and all the while he rode so slowly and the sun mounted so rapidly and\nwith such fervour that it was enough to melt his brains if he had any. Nearly all day he travelled without anything\nremarkable happening to him, at which he was in despair, for he was anxious to encounter some one at once upon\nwhom to try the might of his strong arm.\nWriters there are who say the first adventure he met with was that of Puerto Lapice; others say it was that of the\nwindmills; but what I have ascertained on this point, and what I have found written in the annals of La Mancha,\nis that he was on the road all day, and towards nightfall his hack and he found themselves dead tired and hungry,\nwhen, looking all around to see if he could discover any castle or shepherd\u2019s shanty where he might refresh himself\nand relieve his sore wants, he perceived not far out of his road an inn, which was as welcome as a star guiding him\nto the portals, if not the palaces, of his redemption; and quickening his pace he reached it just as night was setting\nin. At the door were standing two young women, girls of the district as they call them, on their way to Seville with\nsome carriers who had chanced to halt that night at the inn; and as, happen what might to our adventurer, every-\nthing he saw or imaged seemed to him to be and to happen after the fashion of what he read of, the moment he\nsaw the inn he pictured it to himself as a castle with its four turrets and pinnacles of shining silver, not forgetting\nthe drawbridge and moat and all the belongings usually ascribed to castles of the sort. To this inn, which to him\nseemed a castle, he advanced, and at a short distance from it he checked Rocinante, hoping that some dwarf would\nshow himself upon the battlements, and by sound of trumpet give notice that a knight was approaching the castle.\nBut seeing that they were slow about it, and that Rocinante was in a hurry to reach the stable, he made for the inn\ndoor, and perceived the two gay damsels who were standing there, and who seemed to him to be two fair maidens\nor lovely ladies taking their ease at the castle gate.\nAt this moment it so happened that a swineherd who was going through the stubbles collecting a drove of pigs\n(for, without any apology, that is what they are called) gave a blast of his horn to bring them together, and forth-\nwith it seemed to Don Quixote to be what he was expecting, the signal of some dwarf announcing his arrival; and\nso with prodigious satisfaction he rode up to the inn and to the ladies, who, seeing a man of this sort approaching\nin full armour and with lance and buckler, were turning in dismay into the inn, when Don Quixote, guessing their\nfear by their flight, raising his pasteboard visor, disclosed his dry dusty visage, and with courteous bearing and\ngentle voice addressed them, \u201cYour ladyships need not fly or fear any rudeness, for that it belongs not to the order\nof knighthood which I profess to offer to anyone, much less to highborn maidens as your appearance proclaims\nyou to be.\u201d The girls were looking at him and straining their eyes to make out the features which the clumsy visor\nobscured, but when they heard themselves called maidens, a thing so much out of their line, they could not restrain\ntheir laughter, which made Don Quixote wax indignant, and say, \u201cModesty becomes the fair, and moreover laughter\nthat has little cause is great silliness; this, however, I say not to pain or anger you, for my desire is none other than to\n21 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nserve you.\u201d\nThe incomprehensible language and the unpromising looks of our cavalier only increased the ladies\u2019 laughter,\nand that increased his irritation, and matters might have gone farther if at that moment the landlord had not come\nout, who, being a very fat man, was a very peaceful one. He, seeing this grotesque figure clad in armour that did not\nmatch any more than his saddle, bridle, lance, buckler, or corselet, was not at all indisposed to join the damsels in\ntheir manifestations of amusement; but, in truth, standing in awe of such a complicated armament, he thought it\nbest to speak him fairly, so he said, \u201cSenor Caballero, if your worship wants lodging, bating the bed (for there is not\none in the inn) there is plenty of everything else here.\u201d Don Quixote, observing the respectful bearing of the Alcaide\nof the fortress (for so innkeeper and inn seemed in his eyes), made answer, \u201cSir Castellan, for me anything will\nsuffice, for\n\u2018My armour is my only wear,\nMy only rest the fray.\u2019\u201d\nThe host fancied he called him Castellan because he took him for a \u201cworthy of Castile,\u201d though he was in fact\nan Andalusian, and one from the strand of San Lucar, as crafty a thief as Cacus and as full of tricks as a student or a\npage. \u201cIn that case,\u201d said he,\n\u201c\u2018Your bed is on the flinty rock,\nYour sleep to watch alway;\u2019\nand if so, you may dismount and safely reckon upon any quantity of sleeplessness under this roof for a twelve-\nmonth, not to say for a single night.\u201d So saying, he advanced to hold the stirrup for Don Quixote, who got down\nwith great difficulty and exertion (for he had not broken his fast all day), and then charged the host to take great\ncare of his horse, as he was the best bit of flesh that ever ate bread in this world. The landlord eyed him over but did\nnot find him as good as Don Quixote said, nor even half as good; and putting him up in the stable, he returned to\nsee what might be wanted by his guest, whom the damsels, who had by this time made their peace with him, were\nnow relieving of his armour. They had taken off his breastplate and backpiece, but they neither knew nor saw how\nto open his gorget or remove his make-shift helmet, for he had fastened it with green ribbons, which, as there was\nno untying the knots, required to be cut. This, however, he would not by any means consent to, so he remained all\nthe evening with his helmet on, the drollest and oddest figure that can be imagined; and while they were removing\nhis armour, taking the baggages who were about it for ladies of high degree belonging to the castle, he said to them\nwith great sprightliness:\n\u201cOh, never, surely, was there knight\nSo served by hand of dame,\nAs served was he, Don Quixote hight,\nWhen from his town he came;\nWith maidens waiting on himself,\nPrincesses on his hack\u2014\nor Rocinante, for that, ladies mine, is my horse\u2019s name, and Don Quixote of La Mancha is my own; for though I\nhad no intention of declaring myself until my achievements in your service and honour had made me known, the\nnecessity of adapting that old ballad of Lancelot to the present occasion has given you the knowledge of my name\naltogether prematurely. A time, however, will come for your ladyships to command and me to obey, and then the\nmight of my arm will show my desire to serve you.\u201d\nThe girls, who were not used to hearing rhetoric of this sort, had nothing to say in reply; they only asked him\nif he wanted anything to eat. \u201cI would gladly eat a bit of something,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cfor I feel it would come\nvery seasonably.\u201d The day happened to be a Friday, and in the whole inn there was nothing but some pieces of the\nfish they call in Castile \u201cabadejo,\u201d in Andalusia \u201cbacallao,\u201d and in some places \u201ccuradillo,\u201d and in others \u201ctroutlet;\u201d\nso they asked him if he thought he could eat troutlet, for there was no other fish to give him. \u201cIf there be troutlets\nenough,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cthey will be the same thing as a trout; for it is all one to me whether I am given eight\nreals in small change or a piece of eight; moreover, it may be that these troutlets are like veal, which is better than\nbeef, or kid, which is better than goat. But whatever it be let it come quickly, for the burden and pressure of arms\ncannot be borne without support to the inside.\u201d They laid a table for him at the door of the inn for the sake of the\nair, and the host brought him a portion of ill-soaked and worse cooked stockfish, and a piece of bread as black and\nmouldy as his own armour; but a laughable sight it was to see him eating, for having his helmet on and the beaver\nup, he could not with his own hands put anything into his mouth unless some one else placed it there, and this\nservice one of the ladies rendered him. But to give him anything to drink was impossible, or would have been so\nhad not the landlord bored a reed, and putting one end in his mouth poured the wine into him through the other;\nall which he bore with patience rather than sever the ribbons of his helmet.\nWhile this was going on there came up to the inn a sowgelder, who, as he approached, sounded his reed pipe\nfour or five times, and thereby completely convinced Don Quixote that he was in some famous castle, and that\n22 Don Quixote\nthey were regaling him with music, and that the stockfish was trout, the bread the whitest, the wenches ladies, and\nthe landlord the castellan of the castle; and consequently he held that his enterprise and sally had been to some\npurpose. But still it distressed him to think he had not been dubbed a knight, for it was plain to him he could not\nlawfully engage in any adventure without receiving the order of knighthood.\nCHAPter III.\nWHEREIN IS RELATED THE DROLL WAY IN WHICH DON QUIXOTE HAD HIMSELF DUBBED A KNIGHT\nHarassed by this reflection, he made haste with his scanty pothouse supper, and having finished it called the\nlandlord, and shutting himself into the stable with him, fell on his knees before him, saying, \u201cFrom this spot I rise\nnot, valiant knight, until your courtesy grants me the boon I seek, one that will redound to your praise and the\nbenefit of the human race.\u201d The landlord, seeing his guest at his feet and hearing a speech of this kind, stood star-\ning at him in bewilderment, not knowing what to do or say, and entreating him to rise, but all to no purpose until\nhe had agreed to grant the boon demanded of him. \u201cI looked for no less, my lord, from your High Magnificence,\u201d\nreplied Don Quixote, \u201cand I have to tell you that the boon I have asked and your liberality has granted is that you\nshall dub me knight to-morrow morning, and that to-night I shall watch my arms in the chapel of this your castle;\nthus tomorrow, as I have said, will be accomplished what I so much desire, enabling me lawfully to roam through\nall the four quarters of the world seeking adventures on behalf of those in distress, as is the duty of chivalry and of\nknights-errant like myself, whose ambition is directed to such deeds.\u201d\nThe landlord, who, as has been mentioned, was something of a wag, and had already some suspicion of his\nguest\u2019s want of wits, was quite convinced of it on hearing talk of this kind from him, and to make sport for the night\nhe determined to fall in with his humour. So he told him he was quite right in pursuing the object he had in view,\nand that such a motive was natural and becoming in cavaliers as distinguished as he seemed and his gallant bearing\nshowed him to be; and that he himself in his younger days had followed the same honourable calling, roaming in\nquest of adventures in various parts of the world, among others the Curing-grounds of Malaga, the Isles of Riaran,\nthe Precinct of Seville, the Little Market of Segovia, the Olivera of Valencia, the Rondilla of Granada, the Strand of\nSan Lucar, the Colt of Cordova, the Taverns of Toledo, and divers other quarters,27 where he had proved the nim-\nbleness of his feet and the lightness of his fingers, doing many wrongs, cheating many widows, ruining maids and\nswindling minors, and, in short, bringing himself under the notice of almost every tribunal and court of justice in\nSpain; until at last he had retired to this castle of his, where he was living upon his property and upon that of others;\nand where he received all knights-errant of whatever rank or condition they might be, all for the great love he bore\nthem and that they might share their substance with him in return for his benevolence. He told him, moreover, that\nin this castle of his there was no chapel in which he could watch his armour, as it had been pulled down in order to\nbe rebuilt, but that in a case of necessity it might, he knew, be watched anywhere, and he might watch it that night\nin a courtyard of the castle, and in the morning, God willing, the requisite ceremonies might be performed so as to\nhave him dubbed a knight, and so thoroughly dubbed that nobody could be more so. He asked if he had any money\nwith him, to which Don Quixote replied that he had not a farthing, as in the histories of knights-errant he had nev-\ner read of any of them carrying any. On this point the landlord told him he was mistaken; for, though not recorded\nin the histories, because in the author\u2019s opinion there was no need to mention anything so obvious and necessary\nas money and clean shirts, it was not to be supposed therefore that they did not carry them, and he might regard it\nas certain and established that all knights-errant (about whom there were so many full and unimpeachable books)\ncarried well-furnished purses in case of emergency, and likewise carried shirts and a little box of ointment to cure\nthe wounds they received. For in those plains and deserts where they engaged in combat and came out wounded,\nit was not always that there was some one to cure them, unless indeed they had for a friend some sage magician to\nsuccour them at once by fetching through the air upon a cloud some damsel or dwarf with a vial of water of such\nvirtue that by tasting one drop of it they were cured of their hurts and wounds in an instant and left as sound as if\nthey had not received any damage whatever. But in case this should not occur, the knights of old took care to see\nthat their squires were provided with money and other requisites, such as lint and ointments for healing purposes;\nand when it happened that knights had no squires (which was rarely and seldom the case) they themselves carried\neverything in cunning saddle-bags that were hardly seen on the horse\u2019s croup, as if it were something else of more\nimportance, because, unless for some such reason, carrying saddle-bags was not very favourably regarded among\nknights-errant. He therefore advised him (and, as his godson so soon to be, he might even command him) never\nfrom that time forth to travel without money and the usual requirements, and he would find the advantage of them\nwhen he least expected it.\n27 \u201cThe localities here mentioned were, and some of them still are, haunts of the rogue and vagabond, or, what would be called\nin Spain, the picaro class. \u2026 As Fermin Caballero says in a queer little book called the Geographical Knowledge of Cervantes, it is clear that\nCervantes knew by heart the \u2018Mapa picaresco de Espa\u00f1a.\u2019\u201d (Ormsby).\n23 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nDon Quixote promised to follow his advice scrupulously, and it was arranged forthwith that he should watch\nhis armour in a large yard at one side of the inn; so, collecting it all together, Don Quixote placed it on a trough that\nstood by the side of a well, and bracing his buckler on his arm he grasped his lance and began with a stately air to\nmarch up and down in front of the trough, and as he began his march night began to fall.\nThe landlord told all the people who were in the inn about the craze of his guest, the watching of the armour,\nand the dubbing ceremony he contemplated. Full of wonder at so strange a form of madness, they flocked to see it\nfrom a distance, and observed with what composure he sometimes paced up and down, or sometimes, leaning on\nhis lance, gazed on his armour without taking his eyes off it for ever so long; and as the night closed in with a light\nfrom the moon so brilliant that it might vie with his that lent it, everything the novice knight did was plainly seen\nby all.\nMeanwhile one of the carriers who were in the inn thought fit to water his team, and it was necessary to remove\nDon Quixote\u2019s armour as it lay on the trough; but he seeing the other approach hailed him in a loud voice, \u201cO thou,\nwhoever thou art, rash knight that comest to lay hands on the armour of the most valorous errant that ever girt on\nsword, have a care what thou dost; touch it not unless thou wouldst lay down thy life as the penalty of thy rashness.\u201d\nThe carrier gave no heed to these words (and he would have done better to heed them if he had been heedful of his\nhealth), but seizing it by the straps flung the armour some distance from him. Seeing this, Don Quixote raised his\neyes to heaven, and fixing his thoughts, apparently, upon his lady Dulcinea, exclaimed, \u201cAid me, lady mine, in this\nthe first encounter that presents itself to this breast which thou holdest in subjection; let not thy favour and pro-\ntection fail me in this first jeopardy;\u201d and, with these words and others to the same purpose, dropping his buckler\nhe lifted his lance with both hands and with it smote such a blow on the carrier\u2019s head that he stretched him on the\nground, so stunned that had he followed it up with a second there would have been no need of a surgeon to cure\nhim. This done, he picked up his armour and returned to his beat with the same serenity as before.\nShortly after this, another, not knowing what had happened (for the carrier still lay senseless), came with the\nsame object of giving water to his mules, and was proceeding to remove the armour in order to clear the trough,\nwhen Don Quixote, without uttering a word or imploring aid from anyone, once more dropped his buckler and\nonce more lifted his lance, and without actually breaking the second carrier\u2019s head into pieces, made more than\nthree of it, for he laid it open in four.28 At the noise all the people of the inn ran to the spot, and among them the\nlandlord. Seeing this, Don Quixote braced his buckler on his arm, and with his hand on his sword exclaimed, \u201cO\nLady of Beauty, strength and support of my faint heart, it is time for thee to turn the eyes of thy greatness on this\nthy captive knight on the brink of so mighty an adventure.\u201d By this he felt himself so inspired that he would not\nhave flinched if all the carriers in the world had assailed him. The comrades of the wounded perceiving the plight\nthey were in began from a distance to shower stones on Don Quixote, who screened himself as best he could with\nhis buckler, not daring to quit the trough and leave his armour unprotected. The landlord shouted to them to leave\nhim alone, for he had already told them that he was mad, and as a madman he would not be accountable even if he\nkilled them all. Still louder shouted Don Quixote, calling them knaves and traitors, and the lord of the castle, who\nallowed knights-errant to be treated in this fashion, a villain and a low-born knight whom, had he received the\norder of knighthood, he would call to account for his treachery. \u201cBut of you,\u201d he cried, \u201cbase and vile rabble, I make\nno account; fling, strike, come on, do all ye can against me, ye shall see what the reward of your folly and insolence\nwill be.\u201d This he uttered with so much spirit and boldness that he filled his assailants with a terrible fear, and as\nmuch for this reason as at the persuasion of the landlord they left off stoning him, and he allowed them to carry off\nthe wounded, and with the same calmness and composure as before resumed the watch over his armour.\nBut these freaks of his guest were not much to the liking of the landlord, so he determined to cut matters short\nand confer upon him at once the unlucky order of knighthood before any further misadventure could occur; so,\ngoing up to him, he apologised for the rudeness which, without his knowledge, had been offered to him by these\nlow people, who, however, had been well punished for their audacity. As he had already told him, he said, there\nwas no chapel in the castle, nor was it needed for what remained to be done, for, as he understood the ceremonial\nof the order, the whole point of being dubbed a knight lay in the accolade and in the slap on the shoulder, and that\ncould be administered in the middle of a field; and that he had now done all that was needful as to watching the\narmour, for all requirements were satisfied by a watch of two hours only, while he had been more than four about it.\nDon Quixote believed it all, and told him he stood there ready to obey him, and to make an end of it with as much\ndespatch as possible; for, if he were again attacked, and felt himself to be dubbed knight, he would not, he thought,\nleave a soul alive in the castle, except such as out of respect he might spare at his bidding.\nThus warned and menaced, the castellan forthwith brought out a book in which he used to enter the straw and\nbarley he served out to the carriers, and, with a lad carrying a candle-end, and the two damsels already mentioned,\nhe returned to where Don Quixote stood, and bade him kneel down. Then, reading from his account-book as if\nhe were repeating some devout prayer, in the middle of his delivery he raised his hand and gave him a sturdy blow\n28 \u201cThat is, inflicting two cuts that formed a cross\u201d (Ormsby).\n24 Don Quixote\non the neck, and then, with his own sword, a smart slap on the shoulder, all the while muttering between his teeth\nas if he was saying his prayers. Having done this, he directed one of the ladies to gird on his sword, which she did\nwith great self-possession and gravity, and not a little was required to prevent a burst of laughter at each stage of\nthe ceremony; but what they had already seen of the novice knight\u2019s prowess kept their laughter within bounds. On\ngirding him with the sword the worthy lady said to him, \u201cMay God make your worship a very fortunate knight, and\ngrant you success in battle.\u201d Don Quixote asked her name in order that he might from that time forward know to\nwhom he was beholden for the favour he had received, as he meant to confer upon her some portion of the honour\nhe acquired by the might of his arm. She answered with great humility that she was called La Tolosa, and that she\nwas the daughter of a cobbler of Toledo who lived in the stalls of Sanchobienaya, and that wherever she might be\nshe would serve and esteem him as her lord. Don Quixote said in reply that she would do him a favour if thencefor-\nward she assumed the \u201cDon\u201d and called herself Dona Tolosa. She promised she would, and then the other buckled\non his spur, and with her followed almost the same conversation as with the lady of the sword. He asked her name,\nand she said it was La Molinera,29 and that she was the daughter of a respectable miller of Antequera; and of her\nlikewise Don Quixote requested that she would adopt the \u201cDon\u201d and call herself Dona Molinera, making offers to\nher further services and favours.\nHaving thus, with hot haste and speed, brought to a conclusion these never-till-now-seen ceremonies, Don\nQuixote was on thorns until he saw himself on horseback sallying forth in quest of adventures; and saddling Ro-\ncinante at once he mounted, and embracing his host, as he returned thanks for his kindness in knighting him, he\naddressed him in language so extraordinary that it is impossible to convey an idea of it or report it. The landlord,\nto get him out of the inn, replied with no less rhetoric though with shorter words, and without calling upon him to\npay the reckoning let him go with a Godspeed.\nCHAPter IV.\nOF WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR KNIGHT WHEN HE LEFT THE INN\nDay was dawning when Don Quixote quitted the inn, so happy, so gay, so exhilarated at finding himself now\ndubbed a knight, that his joy was like to burst his horse-girths. However, recalling the advice of his host as to the\nrequisites he ought to carry with him, especially that referring to money and shirts, he determined to go home and\nprovide himself with all, and also with a squire, for he reckoned upon securing a farm-labourer, a neighbour of his,\na poor man with a family, but very well qualified for the office of squire to a knight. With this object he turned his\nhorse\u2019s head towards his village, and Rocinante, thus reminded of his old quarters, stepped out so briskly that he\nhardly seemed to tread the earth.\nHe had not gone far, when out of a thicket on his right there seemed to come feeble cries as of some one in\ndistress, and the instant he heard them he exclaimed, \u201cThanks be to heaven for the favour it accords me, that it so\nsoon offers me an opportunity of fulfilling the obligation I have undertaken, and gathering the fruit of my ambition.\nThese cries, no doubt, come from some man or woman in want of help, and needing my aid and protection;\u201d and\nwheeling, he turned Rocinante in the direction whence the cries seemed to proceed. He had gone but a few pac-\nes into the wood, when he saw a mare tied to an oak, and tied to another, and stripped from the waist upwards, a\nyouth of about fifteen years of age, from whom the cries came. Nor were they without cause, for a lusty farmer was\nflogging him with a belt and following up every blow with scoldings and commands, repeating, \u201cYour mouth shut\nand your eyes open!\u201d while the youth made answer, \u201cI won\u2019t do it again, master mine; by God\u2019s passion I won\u2019t do it\nagain, and I\u2019ll take more care of the flock another time.\u201d\nSeeing what was going on, Don Quixote said in an angry voice, \u201cDiscourteous knight, it ill becomes you to\nassail one who cannot defend himself; mount your steed and take your lance\u201d (for there was a lance leaning against\nthe oak to which the mare was tied), \u201cand I will make you know that you are behaving as a coward.\u201d The farmer,\nseeing before him this figure in full armour brandishing a lance over his head, gave himself up for dead, and made\nanswer meekly, \u201cSir Knight, this youth that I am chastising is my servant, employed by me to watch a flock of sheep\nthat I have hard by, and he is so careless that I lose one every day, and when I punish him for his carelessness and\nknavery he says I do it out of niggardliness, to escape paying him the wages I owe him, and before God, and on my\nsoul, he lies.\u201d\n\u201cLies before me, base clown!\u201d said Don Quixote. \u201cBy the sun that shines on us I have a mind to run you\nthrough with this lance. Pay him at once without another word; if not, by the God that rules us I will make an end\nof you, and annihilate you on the spot; release him instantly.\u201d\nThe farmer hung his head, and without a word untied his servant, of whom\nDon Quixote asked how much his master owed him.\nHe replied, nine months at seven reals a month. Don Quixote added it up, found that it came to sixty-three\n29 The lady-miller.\n25 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nreals, and told the farmer to pay it down immediately, if he did not want to die for it.\nThe trembling clown replied that as he lived and by the oath he had sworn (though he had not sworn any) it\nwas not so much; for there were to be taken into account and deducted three pairs of shoes he had given him, and a\nreal for two blood-lettings when he was sick.\n\u201cAll that is very well,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut let the shoes and the blood-lettings stand as a setoff against the\nblows you have given him without any cause; for if he spoiled the leather of the shoes you paid for, you have dam-\naged that of his body, and if the barber took blood from him when he was sick, you have drawn it when he was\nsound; so on that score he owes you nothing.\u201d\n\u201cThe difficulty is, Sir Knight, that I have no money here; let Andres come home with me, and I will pay him all,\nreal by real.\u201d\n\u201cI go with him!\u201d said the youth. \u201cNay, God forbid! No, senor, not for the world; for once alone with me, he\nwould ray me like a Saint Bartholomew.\u201d\n\u201cHe will do nothing of the kind,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cI have only to command, and he will obey me; and as he\nhas sworn to me by the order of knighthood which he has received, I leave him free, and I guarantee the payment.\u201d\n\u201cConsider what you are saying, senor,\u201d said the youth; \u201cthis master of mine is not a knight, nor has he received\nany order of knighthood; for he is Juan Haldudo the Rich, of Quintanar.\u201d\n\u201cThat matters little,\u201d replied Don Quixote; \u201cthere may be Haldudos knights; moreover, everyone is the son of his\nworks.\u201d\n\u201cThat is true,\u201d said Andres; \u201cbut this master of mine\u2014of what works is he the son, when he refuses me the wag-\nes of my sweat and labour?\u201d\n\u201cI do not refuse, brother Andres,\u201d said the farmer, \u201cbe good enough to come along with me, and I swear by all\nthe orders of knighthood there are in the world to pay you as I have agreed, real by real, and perfumed.\u201d\n\u201cFor the perfumery I excuse you,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cgive it to him in reals, and I shall be satisfied; and see\nthat you do as you have sworn; if not, by the same oath I swear to come back and hunt you out and punish you; and\nI shall find you though you should lie closer than a lizard. And if you desire to know who it is lays this command\nupon you, that you be more firmly bound to obey it, know that I am the valorous Don Quixote of La Mancha, the\nundoer of wrongs and injustices; and so, God be with you, and keep in mind what you have promised and sworn\nunder those penalties that have been already declared to you.\u201d\nSo saying, he gave Rocinante the spur and was soon out of reach. The farmer followed him with his eyes, and\nwhen he saw that he had cleared the wood and was no longer in sight, he turned to his boy Andres, and said,\n\u201cCome here, my son, I want to pay you what I owe you, as that undoer of wrongs has commanded me.\u201d\n\u201cMy oath on it,\u201d said Andres, \u201cyour worship will be well advised to obey the command of that good knight\u2014\nmay he live a thousand years\u2014for, as he is a valiant and just judge, by Roque, if you do not pay me, he will come\nback and do as he said.\u201d\n\u201cMy oath on it, too,\u201d said the farmer; \u201cbut as I have a strong affection for you, I want to add to the debt in order\nto add to the payment;\u201d and seizing him by the arm, he tied him up again, and gave him such a flogging that he left\nhim for dead.\n\u201cNow, Master Andres,\u201d said the farmer, \u201ccall on the undoer of wrongs; you will find he won\u2019t undo that, though\nI am not sure that I have quite done with you, for I have a good mind to flay you alive.\u201d But at last he untied him,\nand gave him leave to go look for his judge in order to put the sentence pronounced into execution.\nAndres went off rather down in the mouth, swearing he would go to look for the valiant Don Quixote of La\nMancha and tell him exactly what had happened, and that all would have to be repaid him sevenfold; but for all\nthat, he went off weeping, while his master stood laughing.\nThus did the valiant Don Quixote right that wrong, and, thoroughly satisfied with what had taken place, as\nhe considered he had made a very happy and noble beginning with his knighthood, he took the road towards his\nvillage in perfect self-content, saying in a low voice, \u201cWell mayest thou this day call thyself fortunate above all on\nearth, O Dulcinea del Toboso, fairest of the fair! since it has fallen to thy lot to hold subject and submissive to thy\nfull will and pleasure a knight so renowned as is and will be Don Quixote of La Mancha, who, as all the world\nknows, yesterday received the order of knighthood, and hath to-day righted the greatest wrong and grievance that\never injustice conceived and cruelty perpetrated: who hath to-day plucked the rod from the hand of yonder ruthless\noppressor so wantonly lashing that tender child.\u201d\nHe now came to a road branching in four directions, and immediately he was reminded of those cross-roads\nwhere knights-errant used to stop to consider which road they should take. In imitation of them he halted for a\nwhile, and after having deeply considered it, he gave Rocinante his head, submitting his own will to that of his\nhack, who followed out his first intention, which was to make straight for his own stable. After he had gone about\ntwo miles Don Quixote perceived a large party of people, who, as afterwards appeared, were some Toledo traders,\non their way to buy silk at Murcia. There were six of them coming along under their sunshades, with four servants\n26 Don Quixote\nmounted, and three muleteers on foot. Scarcely had Don Quixote descried them when the fancy possessed him\nthat this must be some new adventure; and to help him to imitate as far as he could those passages he had read of\nin his books, here seemed to come one made on purpose, which he resolved to attempt. So with a lofty bearing and\ndetermination he fixed himself firmly in his stirrups, got his lance ready, brought his buckler before his breast, and\nplanting himself in the middle of the road, stood waiting the approach of these knights-errant, for such he now\nconsidered and held them to be; and when they had come near enough to see and hear, he exclaimed with a haugh-\nty gesture, \u201cAll the world stand, unless all the world confess that in all the world there is no maiden fairer than the\nEmpress of La Mancha, the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso.\u201d\nThe traders halted at the sound of this language and the sight of the strange figure that uttered it, and from both\nfigure and language at once guessed the craze of their owner; they wished, however, to learn quietly what was the\nobject of this confession that was demanded of them, and one of them, who was rather fond of a joke and was very\nsharp-witted, said to him, \u201cSir Knight, we do not know who this good lady is that you speak of; show her to us, for,\nif she be of such beauty as you suggest, with all our hearts and without any pressure we will confess the truth that is\non your part required of us.\u201d\n\u201cIf I were to show her to you,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cwhat merit would you have in confessing a truth so man-\nifest? The essential point is that without seeing her you must believe, confess, affirm, swear, and defend it; else ye\nhave to do with me in battle, ill-conditioned, arrogant rabble that ye are; and come ye on, one by one as the order\nof knighthood requires, or all together as is the custom and vile usage of your breed, here do I bide and await you\nrelying on the justice of the cause I maintain.\u201d\n\u201cSir Knight,\u201d replied the trader, \u201cI entreat your worship in the name of this present company of princes, that,\nto save us from charging our consciences with the confession of a thing we have never seen or heard of, and one\nmoreover so much to the prejudice of the Empresses and Queens of the Alcarria and Estremadura, your worship\nwill be pleased to show us some portrait of this lady, though it be no bigger than a grain of wheat; for by the thread\none gets at the ball, and in this way we shall be satisfied and easy, and you will be content and pleased; nay, I believe\nwe are already so far agreed with you that even though her portrait should show her blind of one eye, and distilling\nvermilion and sulphur from the other, we would nevertheless, to gratify your worship, say all in her favour that you\ndesire.\u201d\n\u201cShe distils nothing of the kind, vile rabble,\u201d said Don Quixote, burning with rage, \u201cnothing of the kind, I say,\nonly ambergris and civet in cotton; nor is she one-eyed or humpbacked, but straighter than a Guadarrama spindle:\nbut ye must pay for the blasphemy ye have uttered against beauty like that of my lady.\u201d\nAnd so saying, he charged with levelled lance against the one who had spoken, with such fury and fierceness\nthat, if luck had not contrived that Rocinante should stumble midway and come down, it would have gone hard\nwith the rash trader. Down went Rocinante, and over went his master, rolling along the ground for some distance;\nand when he tried to rise he was unable, so encumbered was he with lance, buckler, spurs, helmet, and the weight of\nhis old armour; and all the while he was struggling to get up he kept saying, \u201cFly not, cowards and caitiffs! stay, for\nnot by my fault, but my horse\u2019s, am I stretched here.\u201d\nOne of the muleteers in attendance, who could not have had much good nature in him, hearing the poor pros-\ntrate man blustering in this style, was unable to refrain from giving him an answer on his ribs; and coming up to\nhim he seized his lance, and having broken it in pieces, with one of them he began so to belabour our Don Quixote\nthat, notwithstanding and in spite of his armour, he milled him like a measure of wheat. His masters called out not\nto lay on so hard and to leave him alone, but the muleteers blood was up, and he did not care to drop the game\nuntil he had vented the rest of his wrath, and gathering up the remaining fragments of the lance he finished with a\ndischarge upon the unhappy victim, who all through the storm of sticks that rained on him never ceased threaten-\ning heaven, and earth, and the brigands, for such they seemed to him. At last the muleteer was tired, and the traders\ncontinued their journey, taking with them matter for talk about the poor fellow who had been cudgelled. He when\nhe found himself alone made another effort to rise; but if he was unable when whole and sound, how was he to rise\nafter having been thrashed and well-nigh knocked to pieces? And yet he esteemed himself fortunate, as it seemed\nto him that this was a regular knight-errant\u2019s mishap, and entirely, he considered, the fault of his horse. However,\nbattered in body as he was, to rise was beyond his power.\nCHAPter V.\nIN WHICH THE NARRATIVE OF OUR KNIGHT\u2019S MISHAP IS CONTINUED\nFinding, then, that, in fact he could not move, he thought himself of having recourse to his usual remedy, which\nwas to think of some passage in his books, and his craze brought to his mind that about Baldwin and the Marquis\nof Mantua, when Carloto left him wounded on the mountain side, a story known by heart by the children, not\nforgotten by the young men, and lauded and even believed by the old folk; and for all that not a whit truer than the\n27 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nmiracles of Mahomet. This seemed to him to fit exactly the case in which he found himself, so, making a show of\nsevere suffering, he began to roll on the ground and with feeble breath repeat the very words which the wounded\nknight of the wood is said to have uttered:\nWhere art thou, lady mine, that thou\nMy sorrow dost not rue?\nThou canst not know it, lady mine,\nOr else thou art untrue.\nAnd so he went on with the ballad as far as the lines:\nO noble Marquis of Mantua,\nMy Uncle and liege lord!\nAs chance would have it, when he had got to this line there happened to come by a peasant from his own\nvillage, a neighbour of his, who had been with a load of wheat to the mill, and he, seeing the man stretched there,\ncame up to him and asked him who he was and what was the matter with him that he complained so dolefully.\nDon Quixote was firmly persuaded that this was the Marquis of Mantua, his uncle, so the only answer he made\nwas to go on with his ballad, in which he told the tale of his misfortune, and of the loves of the Emperor\u2019s son and\nhis wife all exactly as the ballad sings it.\nThe peasant stood amazed at hearing such nonsense, and relieving him of the visor, already battered to pieces\nby blows, he wiped his face, which was covered with dust, and as soon as he had done so he recognised him and\nsaid, \u201cSenor Quixada\u201d (for so he appears to have been called when he was in his senses and had not yet changed\nfrom a quiet country gentleman into a knight-errant), \u201cwho has brought your worship to this pass?\u201d But to all ques-\ntions the other only went on with his ballad.\nSeeing this, the good man removed as well as he could his breastplate and backpiece to see if he had any wound,\nbut he could perceive no blood nor any mark whatever. He then contrived to raise him from the ground, and with\nno little difficulty hoisted him upon his ass, which seemed to him to be the easiest mount for him; and collecting\nthe arms, even to the splinters of the lance, he tied them on Rocinante, and leading him by the bridle and the ass by\nthe halter he took the road for the village, very sad to hear what absurd stuff Don Quixote was talking.\nNor was Don Quixote less so, for what with blows and bruises he could not sit upright on the ass, and from\ntime to time he sent up sighs to heaven, so that once more he drove the peasant to ask what ailed him. And it could\nhave been only the devil himself that put into his head tales to match his own adventures, for now, forgetting Bald-\nwin, he bethought himself of the Moor Abindarraez, when the Alcaide of Antequera, Rodrigo de Narvaez, took him\nprisoner and carried him away to his castle; so that when the peasant again asked him how he was and what ailed\nhim, he gave him for reply the same words and phrases that the captive Abindarraez gave to Rodrigo de Narvaez,\njust as he had read the story in the \u201cDiana\u201d of Jorge de Montemayor where it is written, applying it to his own case\nso aptly that the peasant went along cursing his fate that he had to listen to such a lot of nonsense; from which,\nhowever, he came to the conclusion that his neighbour was mad, and so made all haste to reach the village to escape\nthe wearisomeness of this harangue of Don Quixote\u2019s; who, at the end of it, said, \u201cSenor Don Rodrigo de Narvaez,\nyour worship must know that this fair Xarifa I have mentioned is now the lovely Dulcinea del Toboso, for whom\nI have done, am doing, and will do the most famous deeds of chivalry that in this world have been seen, are to be\nseen, or ever shall be seen.\u201d\nTo this the peasant answered, \u201cSenor\u2014sinner that I am!\u2014cannot your\nworship see that I am not Don Rodrigo de Narvaez nor the Marquis of Mantua, but Pedro Alonso your neighbour,\nand that your worship is neither Baldwin nor Abindarraez, but the worthy gentleman Senor Quixada?\u201d\n\u201cI know who I am,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cand I know that I may be not only those I have named, but all the\nTwelve Peers of France and even all the Nine Worthies, since my achievements surpass all that they have done all\ntogether and each of them on his own account.\u201d\nWith this talk and more of the same kind they reached the village just as night was beginning to fall, but the\npeasant waited until it was a little later that the belaboured gentleman might not be seen riding in such a miserable\ntrim. When it was what seemed to him the proper time he entered the village and went to Don Quixote\u2019s house,\nwhich he found all in confusion, and there were the curate and the village barber, who were great friends of Don\nQuixote, and his housekeeper was saying to them in a loud voice, \u201cWhat does your worship think can have befallen\nmy master, Senor Licentiate Pero Perez?\u201d for so the curate was called; \u201cit is three days now since anything has been\nseen of him, or the hack, or the buckler, lance, or armour. Miserable me! I am certain of it, and it is as true as that\nI was born to die, that these accursed books of chivalry he has, and has got into the way of reading so constantly,\nhave upset his reason; for now I remember having often heard him saying to himself that he would turn knight-er-\nrant and go all over the world in quest of adventures. To the devil and Barabbas with such books, that have brought\nto ruin in this way the finest understanding there was in all La Mancha!\u201d\nThe niece said the same, and, more: \u201cYou must know, Master Nicholas\u201d\u2014for that was the name of the bar-\n28 Don Quixote\nber\u2014\u201dit was often my uncle\u2019s way to stay two days and nights together poring over these unholy books of misven-\ntures, after which he would fling the book away and snatch up his sword and fall to slashing the walls; and when\nhe was tired out he would say he had killed four giants like four towers; and the sweat that flowed from him when\nhe was weary he said was the blood of the wounds he had received in battle; and then he would drink a great jug of\ncold water and become calm and quiet, saying that this water was a most precious potion which the sage Esquife, a\ngreat magician and friend of his, had brought him. But I take all the blame upon myself for never having told your\nworships of my uncle\u2019s vagaries, that you might put a stop to them before things had come to this pass, and burn all\nthese accursed books\u2014for he has a great number\u2014that richly deserve to be burned like heretics.\u201d\n\u201cSo say I too,\u201d said the curate, \u201cand by my faith to-morrow shall not pass without public judgment upon them,\nand may they be condemned to the flames lest they lead those that read to behave as my good friend seems to have\nbehaved.\u201d\nAll this the peasant heard, and from it he understood at last what was the matter with his neighbour, so he be-\ngan calling aloud, \u201cOpen, your worships, to Senor Baldwin and to Senor the Marquis of Mantua, who comes badly\nwounded, and to Senor Abindarraez, the Moor, whom the valiant Rodrigo de Narvaez, the Alcaide of Antequera,\nbrings captive.\u201d\nAt these words they all hurried out, and when they recognised their friend, master, and uncle, who had not yet\ndismounted from the ass because he could not, they ran to embrace him.\n\u201cHold!\u201d said he, \u201cfor I am badly wounded through my horse\u2019s fault; carry me to bed, and if possible send for the\nwise Urganda to cure and see to my wounds.\u201d\n\u201cSee there! plague on it!\u201d cried the housekeeper at this: \u201cdid not my heart tell the truth as to which foot my\nmaster went lame of? To bed with your worship at once, and we will contrive to cure you here without fetching that\nHurgada. A curse I say once more, and a hundred times more, on those books of chivalry that have brought your\nworship to such a pass.\u201d\nThey carried him to bed at once, and after searching for his wounds could find none, but he said they were all\nbruises from having had a severe fall with his horse Rocinante when in combat with ten giants, the biggest and the\nboldest to be found on earth.\n\u201cSo, so!\u201d said the curate, \u201care there giants in the dance? By the sign of the Cross I will burn them to-morrow\nbefore the day over.\u201d\nThey put a host of questions to Don Quixote, but his only answer to all was\u2014give him something to eat, and\nleave him to sleep, for that was what he needed most. They did so, and the curate questioned the peasant at great\nlength as to how he had found Don Quixote. He told him, and the nonsense he had talked when found and on the\nway home, all which made the licentiate the more eager to do what he did the next day, which was to summon his\nfriend the barber, Master Nicholas, and go with him to Don Quixote\u2019s house.\nCHAPter VI.\nOF THE DIVERTING AND IMPORTANT SCRUTINY WHICH THE CURATE AND THE BARBER MADE IN\nTHE LIBRARY OF OUR INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN\nHe was still sleeping; so the curate asked the niece for the keys of the room where the books, the authors of all\nthe mischief, were, and right willingly she gave them. They all went in, the housekeeper with them, and found more\nthan a hundred volumes of big books very well bound, and some other small ones. The moment the housekeeper\nsaw them she turned about and ran out of the room, and came back immediately with a saucer of holy water and\na sprinkler, saying, \u201cHere, your worship, senor licentiate, sprinkle this room; don\u2019t leave any magician of the many\nthere are in these books to bewitch us in revenge for our design of banishing them from the world.\u201d\nThe simplicity of the housekeeper made the licentiate laugh, and he directed the barber to give him the books\none by one to see what they were about, as there might be some to be found among them that did not deserve the\npenalty of fire.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the niece, \u201cthere is no reason for showing mercy to any of them; they have every one of them done\nmischief; better fling them out of the window into the court and make a pile of them and set fire to them; or else\ncarry them into the yard, and there a bonfire can be made without the smoke giving any annoyance.\u201d The house-\nkeeper said the same, so eager were they both for the slaughter of those innocents, but the curate would not agree to\nit without first reading at any rate the titles.\nThe first that Master Nicholas put into his hand was \u201cThe four books of Amadis of Gaul.\u201d \u201cThis seems a myste-\nrious thing,\u201d said the curate, \u201cfor, as I have heard say, this was the first book of chivalry printed in Spain, and from\nthis all the others derive their birth and origin; so it seems to me that we ought inexorably to condemn it to the\nflames as the founder of so vile a sect.\u201d\n\u201cNay, sir,\u201d said the barber, \u201cI too, have heard say that this is the best of all the books of this kind that have been\n29 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nwritten, and so, as something singular in its line, it ought to be pardoned.\u201d\n\u201cTrue,\u201d said the curate; \u201cand for that reason let its life be spared for the present. Let us see that other which is\nnext to it.\u201d\n\u201cIt is,\u201d said the barber, \u201cthe \u2018Sergas de Esplandian,\u2019 the lawful son of\nAmadis of Gaul.\u201d\n\u201cThen verily,\u201d said the curate, \u201cthe merit of the father must not be put down to the account of the son. Take it,\nmistress housekeeper; open the window and fling it into the yard and lay the foundation of the pile for the bonfire\nwe are to make.\u201d\nThe housekeeper obeyed with great satisfaction, and the worthy \u201cEsplandian\u201d went flying into the yard to await\nwith all patience the fire that was in store for him.\n\u201cProceed,\u201d said the curate.\n\u201cThis that comes next,\u201d said the barber, \u201cis \u2018Amadis of Greece,\u2019 and, indeed, I believe all those on this side are of\nthe same Amadis lineage.\u201d\n\u201cThen to the yard with the whole of them,\u201d said the curate; \u201cfor to have the burning of Queen Pintiquiniestra,\nand the shepherd Darinel and his eclogues, and the bedevilled and involved discourses of his author, I would burn\nwith them the father who begot me if he were going about in the guise of a knight-errant.\u201d\n\u201cI am of the same mind,\u201d said the barber.\n\u201cAnd so am I,\u201d added the niece.\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d said the housekeeper, \u201chere, into the yard with them!\u201d\nThey were handed to her, and as there were many of them, she spared herself the staircase, and flung them\ndown out of the window.\n\u201cWho is that tub there?\u201d said the curate.\n\u201cThis,\u201d said the barber, \u201cis \u2018Don Olivante de Laura.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThe author of that book,\u201d said the curate, \u201cwas the same that wrote \u2018The Garden of Flowers,\u2019 and truly there is\nno deciding which of the two books is the more truthful, or, to put it better, the less lying; all I can say is, send this\none into the yard for a swaggering fool.\u201d\n\u201cThis that follows is \u2018Florismarte of Hircania,\u2019\u201d said the barber.\n\u201cSenor Florismarte here?\u201d said the curate; \u201cthen by my faith he must take up his quarters in the yard, in spite of\nhis marvellous birth and visionary adventures, for the stiffness and dryness of his style deserve nothing else; into\nthe yard with him and the other, mistress housekeeper.\u201d\n\u201cWith all my heart, senor,\u201d said she, and executed the order with great delight.\n\u201cThis,\u201d said the barber, \u201cis The Knight Platir.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cAn old book that,\u201d said the curate, \u201cbut I find no reason for clemency in it; send it after the others without\nappeal;\u201d which was done.\nAnother book was opened, and they saw it was entitled, \u201cThe Knight of the Cross.\u201d\n\u201cFor the sake of the holy name this book has,\u201d said the curate, \u201cits ignorance might be excused; but then, they\nsay, \u2018behind the cross there\u2019s the devil; to the fire with it.\u201d\nTaking down another book, the barber said, \u201cThis is \u2018The Mirror of Chivalry.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI know his worship,\u201d said the curate; \u201cthat is where Senor Reinaldos of Montalvan figures with his friends and\ncomrades, greater thieves than Cacus, and the Twelve Peers of France with the veracious historian Turpin; howev-\ner, I am not for condemning them to more than perpetual banishment, because, at any rate, they have some share\nin the invention of the famous Matteo Boiardo, whence too the Christian poet Ludovico Ariosto wove his web, to\nwhom, if I find him here, and speaking any language but his own, I shall show no respect whatever; but if he speaks\nhis own tongue I will put him upon my head.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I have him in Italian,\u201d said the barber, \u201cbut I do not understand him.\u201d\n\u201cNor would it be well that you should understand him,\u201d said the curate, \u201cand on that score we might have\nexcused the Captain if he had not brought him into Spain and turned him into Castilian. He robbed him of a great\ndeal of his natural force, and so do all those who try to turn books written in verse into another language, for, with\nall the pains they take and all the cleverness they show, they never can reach the level of the originals as they were\nfirst produced. In short, I say that this book, and all that may be found treating of those French affairs, should be\nthrown into or deposited in some dry well, until after more consideration it is settled what is to be done with them;\nexcepting always one \u2018Bernardo del Carpio\u2019 that is going about, and another called \u2018Roncesvalles;\u2019 for these, if they\ncome into my hands, shall pass at once into those of the housekeeper, and from hers into the fire without any re-\nprieve.\u201d\nTo all this the barber gave his assent, and looked upon it as right and proper, being persuaded that the curate\nwas so staunch to the Faith and loyal to the Truth that he would not for the world say anything opposed to them.\nOpening another book he saw it was \u201cPalmerin de Oliva,\u201d and beside it was another called \u201cPalmerin of England,\u201d\n30 Don Quixote\nseeing which the licentiate said, \u201cLet the Olive be made firewood of at once and burned until no ashes even are left;\nand let that Palm of England be kept and preserved as a thing that stands alone, and let such another case be made\nfor it as that which Alexander found among the spoils of Darius and set aside for the safe keeping of the works of\nthe poet Homer. This book, gossip, is of authority for two reasons, first because it is very good, and secondly be-\ncause it is said to have been written by a wise and witty king of Portugal. All the adventures at the Castle of Mira-\nguarda are excellent and of admirable contrivance, and the language is polished and clear, studying and observing\nthe style befitting the speaker with propriety and judgment. So then, provided it seems good to you, Master Nicho-\nlas, I say let this and \u2018Amadis of Gaul\u2019 be remitted the penalty of fire, and as for all the rest, let them perish without\nfurther question or query.\u201d\n\u201cNay, gossip,\u201d said the barber, \u201cfor this that I have here is the famous \u2018Don Belianis.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the curate, \u201cthat and the second, third, and fourth parts all stand in need of a little rhubarb to purge\ntheir excess of bile, and they must be cleared of all that stuff about the Castle of Fame and other greater affectations,\nto which end let them be allowed the over-seas term, and, according as they mend, so shall mercy or justice be met-\ned out to them; and in the mean time, gossip, do you keep them in your house and let no one read them.\u201d\n\u201cWith all my heart,\u201d said the barber; and not caring to tire himself with reading more books of chivalry, he told\nthe housekeeper to take all the big ones and throw them into the yard. It was not said to one dull or deaf, but to one\nwho enjoyed burning them more than weaving the broadest and finest web that could be; and seizing about eight at\na time, she flung them out of the window.\nIn carrying so many together she let one fall at the feet of the barber, who took it up, curious to know whose it\nwas, and found it said, \u201cHistory of the Famous Knight, Tirante el Blanco.\u201d\n\u201cGod bless me!\u201d said the curate with a shout, \u201c\u2019Tirante el Blanco\u2019 here! Hand it over, gossip, for in it I reckon\nI have found a treasury of enjoyment and a mine of recreation. Here is Don Kyrieleison of Montalvan, a valiant\nknight, and his brother Thomas of Montalvan, and the knight Fonseca, with the battle the bold Tirante fought with\nthe mastiff, and the witticisms of the damsel Placerdemivida, and the loves and wiles of the widow Reposada, and\nthe empress in love with the squire Hipolito\u2014in truth, gossip, by right of its style it is the best book in the world.\nHere knights eat and sleep, and die in their beds, and make their wills before dying, and a great deal more of which\nthere is nothing in all the other books. Nevertheless, I say he who wrote it, for deliberately composing such fool-\neries, deserves to be sent to the galleys for life. Take it home with you and read it, and you will see that what I have\nsaid is true.\u201d\n\u201cAs you will,\u201d said the barber; \u201cbut what are we to do with these little books that are left?\u201d\n\u201cThese must be, not chivalry, but poetry,\u201d said the curate; and opening one he saw it was the \u201cDiana\u201d of Jorge de\nMontemayor, and, supposing all the others to be of the same sort, \u201cthese,\u201d he said, \u201cdo not deserve to be burned like\nthe others, for they neither do nor can do the mischief the books of chivalry have done, being books of entertain-\nment that can hurt no one.\u201d\n\u201cAh, senor!\u201d said the niece, \u201cyour worship had better order these to be burned as well as the others; for it would\nbe no wonder if, after being cured of his chivalry disorder, my uncle, by reading these, took a fancy to turn shep-\nherd and range the woods and fields singing and piping; or, what would be still worse, to turn poet, which they say\nis an incurable and infectious malady.\u201d\n\u201cThe damsel is right,\u201d said the curate, \u201cand it will be well to put this stumbling-block and temptation out of our\nfriend\u2019s way. To begin, then, with the \u2018Diana\u2019 of Montemayor. I am of opinion it should not be burned, but that it\nshould be cleared of all that about the sage Felicia and the magic water, and of almost all the longer pieces of verse:\nlet it keep, and welcome, its prose and the honour of being the first of books of the kind.\u201d\n\u201cThis that comes next,\u201d said the barber, \u201cis the \u2018Diana,\u2019 entitled the \u2018Second Part, by the Salamancan,\u2019 and this\nother has the same title, and its author is Gil Polo.\u201d\n\u201cAs for that of the Salamancan,\u201d replied the curate, \u201clet it go to swell the number of the condemned in the yard,\nand let Gil Polo\u2019s be preserved as if it came from Apollo himself: but get on, gossip, and make haste, for it is growing\nlate.\u201d\n\u201cThis book,\u201d said the barber, opening another, \u201cis the ten books of the\n\u2018Fortune of Love,\u2019 written by Antonio de Lofraso, a Sardinian poet.\u201d\n\u201cBy the orders I have received,\u201d said the curate, \u201csince Apollo has been Apollo, and the Muses have been Muses,\nand poets have been poets, so droll and absurd a book as this has never been written, and in its way it is the best\nand the most singular of all of this species that have as yet appeared, and he who has not read it may be sure he has\nnever read what is delightful. Give it here, gossip, for I make more account of having found it than if they had given\nme a cassock of Florence stuff.\u201d\nHe put it aside with extreme satisfaction, and the barber went on, \u201cThese that come next are \u2018The Shepherd of\nIberia,\u2019 \u2018Nymphs of Henares,\u2019 and \u2018The Enlightenment of Jealousy.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cThen all we have to do,\u201d said the curate, \u201cis to hand them over to the secular arm of the housekeeper, and ask\n31 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nme not why, or we shall never have done.\u201d\n\u201cThis next is the \u2018Pastor de Filida.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cNo Pastor that,\u201d said the curate, \u201cbut a highly polished courtier; let it be preserved as a precious jewel.\u201d\n\u201cThis large one here,\u201d said the barber, \u201cis called \u2018The Treasury of various Poems.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cIf there were not so many of them,\u201d said the curate, \u201cthey would be more relished: this book must be weeded\nand cleansed of certain vulgarities which it has with its excellences; let it be preserved because the author is a friend\nof mine, and out of respect for other more heroic and loftier works that he has written.\u201d\n\u201cThis,\u201d continued the barber, \u201cis the \u2018Cancionero\u2019 of Lopez de\nMaldonado.\u201d\n\u201cThe author of that book, too,\u201d said the curate, \u201cis a great friend of mine, and his verses from his own mouth are\nthe admiration of all who hear them, for such is the sweetness of his voice that he enchants when he chants them:\nit gives rather too much of its eclogues, but what is good was never yet plentiful: let it be kept with those that have\nbeen set apart. But what book is that next it?\u201d\n\u201cThe \u2018Galatea\u2019 of Miguel de Cervantes,\u201d said the barber.\n\u201cThat Cervantes has been for many years a great friend of mine, and to my knowledge he has had more expe-\nrience in reverses than in verses. His book has some good invention in it, it presents us with something but brings\nnothing to a conclusion: we must wait for the Second Part it promises: perhaps with amendment it may succeed in\nwinning the full measure of grace that is now denied it; and in the mean time do you, senor gossip, keep it shut up\nin your own quarters.\u201d\n\u201cVery good,\u201d said the barber; \u201cand here come three together, the\n\u2018Araucana\u2019 of Don Alonso de Ercilla, the \u2018Austriada\u2019 of Juan Rufo,\nJustice of Cordova, and the \u2018Montserrate\u2019 of Christobal de Virues, the\nValencian poet.\u201d\n\u201cThese three books,\u201d said the curate, \u201care the best that have been written in Castilian in heroic verse, and they\nmay compare with the most famous of Italy; let them be preserved as the richest treasures of poetry that Spain\npossesses.\u201d\nThe curate was tired and would not look into any more books, and so he decided that, \u201ccontents uncertified,\u201d all\nthe rest should be burned; but just then the barber held open one, called \u201cThe Tears of Angelica.\u201d\n\u201cI should have shed tears myself,\u201d said the curate when he heard the title, \u201chad I ordered that book to be\nburned, for its author was one of the famous poets of the world, not to say of Spain, and was very happy in the\ntranslation of some of Ovid\u2019s fables.\u201d\nCHAPter VII.\nOF THE SECOND SALLY OF OUR WORTHY KNIGHT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA\nAt this instant Don Quixote began shouting out, \u201cHere, here, valiant knights! here is need for you to put forth\nthe might of your strong arms, for they of the Court are gaining the mastery in the tourney!\u201d Called away by this\nnoise and outcry, they proceeded no farther with the scrutiny of the remaining books, and so it is thought that\n\u201cThe Carolea,\u201d \u201cThe Lion of Spain,\u201d and \u201cThe Deeds of the Emperor,\u201d written by Don Luis de Avila, went to the fire\nunseen and unheard; for no doubt they were among those that remained, and perhaps if the curate had seen them\nthey would not have undergone so severe a sentence.\nWhen they reached Don Quixote he was already out of bed, and was still shouting and raving, and slashing and\ncutting all round, as wide awake as if he had never slept.\nThey closed with him and by force got him back to bed, and when he had become a little calm, addressing the\ncurate, he said to him, \u201cOf a truth, Senor Archbishop Turpin, it is a great disgrace for us who call ourselves the\nTwelve Peers, so carelessly to allow the knights of the Court to gain the victory in this tourney, we the adventurers\nhaving carried off the honour on the three former days.\u201d\n\u201cHush, gossip,\u201d said the curate; \u201cplease God, the luck may turn, and what is lost to-day may be won to-morrow;\nfor the present let your worship have a care of your health, for it seems to me that you are over-fatigued, if not badly\nwounded.\u201d\n\u201cWounded no,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cbut bruised and battered no doubt, for that bastard Don Roland has cud-\ngelled me with the trunk of an oak tree, and all for envy, because he sees that I alone rival him in his achievements.\nBut I should not call myself Reinaldos of Montalvan did he not pay me for it in spite of all his enchantments as soon\nas I rise from this bed. For the present let them bring me something to eat, for that, I feel, is what will be more to\nmy purpose, and leave it to me to avenge myself.\u201d\nThey did as he wished; they gave him something to eat, and once more he fell asleep, leaving them marvelling at\nhis madness.\n32 Don Quixote\nThat night the housekeeper burned to ashes all the books that were in the yard and in the whole house; and\nsome must have been consumed that deserved preservation in everlasting archives, but their fate and the laziness of\nthe examiner did not permit it, and so in them was verified the proverb that the innocent suffer for the guilty.\nOne of the remedies which the curate and the barber immediately applied to their friend\u2019s disorder was to wall\nup and plaster the room where the books were, so that when he got up he should not find them (possibly the cause\nbeing removed the effect might cease), and they might say that a magician had carried them off, room and all; and\nthis was done with all despatch. Two days later Don Quixote got up, and the first thing he did was to go and look at\nhis books, and not finding the room where he had left it, he wandered from side to side looking for it. He came to\nthe place where the door used to be, and tried it with his hands, and turned and twisted his eyes in every direction\nwithout saying a word; but after a good while he asked his housekeeper whereabouts was the room that held his\nbooks.\nThe housekeeper, who had been already well instructed in what she was to answer, said, \u201cWhat room or what\nnothing is it that your worship is looking for? There are neither room nor books in this house now, for the devil\nhimself has carried all away.\u201d\n\u201cIt was not the devil,\u201d said the niece, \u201cbut a magician who came on a cloud one night after the day your wor-\nship left this, and dismounting from a serpent that he rode he entered the room, and what he did there I know not,\nbut after a little while he made off, flying through the roof, and left the house full of smoke; and when we went to\nsee what he had done we saw neither book nor room: but we remember very well, the housekeeper and I, that on\nleaving, the old villain said in a loud voice that, for a private grudge he owed the owner of the books and the room,\nhe had done mischief in that house that would be discovered by-and-by: he said too that his name was the Sage\nMunaton.\u201d\n\u201cHe must have said Friston,\u201d said Don Quixote.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether he called himself Friston or Friton,\u201d said the housekeeper, \u201cI only know that his name\nended with \u2018ton.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cSo it does,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand he is a sage magician, a great enemy of mine, who has a spite against me\nbecause he knows by his arts and lore that in process of time I am to engage in single combat with a knight whom\nhe befriends and that I am to conquer, and he will be unable to prevent it; and for this reason he endeavours to\ndo me all the ill turns that he can; but I promise him it will be hard for him to oppose or avoid what is decreed by\nHeaven.\u201d\n\u201cWho doubts that?\u201d said the niece; \u201cbut, uncle, who mixes you up in these quarrels? Would it not be better to\nremain at peace in your own house instead of roaming the world looking for better bread than ever came of wheat,\nnever reflecting that many go for wool and come back shorn?\u201d\n\u201cOh, niece of mine,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201chow much astray art thou in thy reckoning: ere they shear me I shall\nhave plucked away and stripped off the beards of all who dare to touch only the tip of a hair of mine.\u201d\nThe two were unwilling to make any further answer, as they saw that his anger was kindling.\nIn short, then, he remained at home fifteen days very quietly without showing any signs of a desire to take up\nwith his former delusions, and during this time he held lively discussions with his two gossips, the curate and the\nbarber, on the point he maintained, that knights-errant were what the world stood most in need of, and that in him\nwas to be accomplished the revival of knight-errantry. The curate sometimes contradicted him, sometimes agreed\nwith him, for if he had not observed this precaution he would have been unable to bring him to reason.\nMeanwhile Don Quixote worked upon a farm labourer, a neighbour of his, an honest man (if indeed that title\ncan be given to him who is poor), but with very little wit in his pate. In a word, he so talked him over, and with such\npersuasions and promises, that the poor clown made up his mind to sally forth with him and serve him as esquire.\nDon Quixote, among other things, told him he ought to be ready to go with him gladly, because any moment an\nadventure might occur that might win an island in the twinkling of an eye and leave him governor of it. On these\nand the like promises Sancho Panza (for so the labourer was called) left wife and children, and engaged himself as\nesquire to his neighbour.\nDon Quixote next set about getting some money; and selling one thing and pawning another, and making a\nbad bargain in every case, he got together a fair sum. He provided himself with a buckler, which he begged as a loan\nfrom a friend, and, restoring his battered helmet as best he could, he warned his squire Sancho of the day and hour\nhe meant to set out, that he might provide himself with what he thought most needful. Above all, he charged him to\ntake alforjas with him. The other said he would, and that he meant to take also a very good ass he had, as he was not\nmuch given to going on foot. About the ass, Don Quixote hesitated a little, trying whether he could call to mind any\nknight-errant taking with him an esquire mounted on ass-back, but no instance occurred to his memory. For all\nthat, however, he determined to take him, intending to furnish him with a more honourable mount when a chance\nof it presented itself, by appropriating the horse of the first discourteous knight he encountered. Himself he provid-\ned with shirts and such other things as he could, according to the advice the host had given him; all which being\n33 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ndone, without taking leave, Sancho Panza of his wife and children, or Don Quixote of his housekeeper and niece,\nthey sallied forth unseen by anybody from the village one night, and made such good way in the course of it that by\ndaylight they held themselves safe from discovery, even should search be made for them.\nSancho rode on his ass like a patriarch, with his alforjas and bota,30 and longing to see himself soon governor of\nthe island his master had promised him. Don Quixote decided upon taking the same route and road he had taken\non his first journey, that over the Campo de Montiel, which he travelled with less discomfort than on the last occa-\nsion, for, as it was early morning and the rays of the sun fell on them obliquely, the heat did not distress them.\nAnd now said Sancho Panza to his master, \u201cYour worship will take care, Senor Knight-errant, not to forget\nabout the island you have promised me, for be it ever so big I\u2019ll be equal to governing it.\u201d\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \u201cThou must know, friend Sancho Panza, that it was a practice very much in\nvogue with the knights-errant of old to make their squires governors of the islands or kingdoms they won, and I am\ndetermined that there shall be no failure on my part in so liberal a custom; on the contrary, I mean to improve upon\nit, for they sometimes, and perhaps most frequently, waited until their squires were old, and then when they had\nhad enough of service and hard days and worse nights, they gave them some title or other, of count, or at the most\nmarquis, of some valley or province more or less; but if thou livest and I live, it may well be that before six days are\nover, I may have won some kingdom that has others dependent upon it, which will be just the thing to enable thee\nto be crowned king of one of them. Nor needst thou count this wonderful, for things and chances fall to the lot of\nsuch knights in ways so unexampled and unexpected that I might easily give thee even more than I promise thee.\u201d\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d said Sancho Panza, \u201cif I should become a king by one of those miracles your worship speaks of,\neven Juana Gutierrez, my old woman, would come to be queen and my children infantes.\u201d\n\u201cWell, who doubts it?\u201d said Don Quixote.\n\u201cI doubt it,\u201d replied Sancho Panza, \u201cbecause for my part I am persuaded that though God should shower down\nkingdoms upon earth, not one of them would fit the head of Mari Gutierrez. Let me tell you, senor, she is not worth\ntwo maravedis for a queen; countess will fit her better, and that only with God\u2019s help.\u201d\n\u201cLeave it to God, Sancho,\u201d returned Don Quixote, \u201cfor he will give her what suits her best; but do not underval-\nue thyself so much as to come to be content with anything less than being governor of a province.\u201d\n\u201cI will not, senor,\u201d answered Sancho, \u201cspecially as I have a man of such quality for a master in your worship,\nwho will know how to give me all that will be suitable for me and that I can bear.\u201d\nCHAPter VIII.\nOF THE GOOD FORTUNE WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE HAD IN THE TERRIBLE AND UN-\nDREAMT-OF ADVENTURE OF THE WINDMILLS, WITH OTHER OCCURRENCES WORTHY TO BE\nFITLY RECORDED\nAt this point they came in sight of thirty forty windmills that there are on plain, and as soon as Don Quixote\nsaw them he said to his squire, \u201cFortune is arranging matters for us better than we could have shaped our desires\nourselves, for look there, friend Sancho Panza, where thirty or more monstrous giants present themselves, all of\nwhom I mean to engage in battle and slay, and with whose spoils we shall begin to make our fortunes; for this is\nrighteous warfare, and it is God\u2019s good service to sweep so evil a breed from off the face of the earth.\u201d\n\u201cWhat giants?\u201d said Sancho Panza.\n\u201cThose thou seest there,\u201d answered his master, \u201cwith the long arms, and some have them nearly two leagues\nlong.\u201d\n\u201cLook, your worship,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cwhat we see there are not giants but windmills, and what seem to be their\narms are the sails that turned by the wind make the millstone go.\u201d\n\u201cIt is easy to see,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cthat thou art not used to this business of adventures; those are giants;\nand if thou art afraid, away with thee out of this and betake thyself to prayer while I engage them in fierce and un-\nequal combat.\u201d\nSo saying, he gave the spur to his steed Rocinante, heedless of the cries his squire Sancho sent after him, warn-\ning him that most certainly they were windmills and not giants he was going to attack. He, however, was so positive\nthey were giants that he neither heard the cries of Sancho, nor perceived, near as he was, what they were, but made\nat them shouting, \u201cFly not, cowards and vile beings, for a single knight attacks you.\u201d\nA slight breeze at this moment sprang up, and the great sails began to move, seeing which Don Quixote ex-\nclaimed, \u201cThough ye flourish more arms than the giant Briareus,31 ye have to reckon with me.\u201d\nSo saying, and commending himself with all his heart to his lady Dulcinea, imploring her to support him in\nsuch a peril, with lance in rest and covered by his buckler, he charged at Rocinante\u2019s fullest gallop and fell upon\n30 Saddle-bags and canteen.\n31 From Greek mythology, Briareus had 50 heads and 100 arms; he is known by the name Aegaeon in Virgil\u2019s Aeneid (10.566-67).\n34 Don Quixote\nthe first mill that stood in front of him; but as he drove his lance-point into the sail the wind whirled it round with\nsuch force that it shivered the lance to pieces, sweeping with it horse and rider, who went rolling over on the plain,\nin a sorry condition. Sancho hastened to his assistance as fast as his ass could go, and when he came up found him\nunable to move, with such a shock had Rocinante fallen with him.\n\u201cGod bless me!\u201d said Sancho, \u201cdid I not tell your worship to mind what you were about, for they were only wind-\nmills? and no one could have made any mistake about it but one who had something of the same kind in his head.\u201d\n\u201cHush, friend Sancho,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cthe fortunes of war more than any other are liable to frequent\nfluctuations; and moreover I think, and it is the truth, that that same sage Friston32 who carried off my study and\nbooks, has turned these giants into mills in order to rob me of the glory of vanquishing them, such is the enmity he\nbears me; but in the end his wicked arts will avail but little against my good sword.\u201d\n\u201cGod order it as he may,\u201d said Sancho Panza, and helping him to rise got him up again on Rocinante, whose\nshoulder was half out; and then, discussing the late adventure, they followed the road to Puerto Lapice, for there,\nsaid Don Quixote, they could not fail to find adventures in abundance and variety, as it was a great thoroughfare.\nFor all that, he was much grieved at the loss of his lance, and saying so to his squire, he added, \u201cI remember having\nread how a Spanish knight, Diego Perez de Vargas by name, having broken his sword in battle, tore from an oak a\nponderous bough or branch, and with it did such things that day, and pounded so many Moors,33 that he got the\nsurname of Machuca, and he and his descendants from that day forth were called Vargas y Machuca. I mention\nthis because from the first oak I see I mean to rend such another branch, large and stout like that, with which I am\ndetermined and resolved to do such deeds that thou mayest deem thyself very fortunate in being found worthy to\ncome and see them, and be an eyewitness of things that will with difficulty be believed.\u201d\n\u201cBe that as God will,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cI believe it all as your worship says it; but straighten yourself a little, for you\nseem all on one side, may be from the shaking of the fall.\u201d\n\u201cThat is the truth,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand if I make no complaint of the pain it is because knights-errant are\nnot permitted to complain of any wound, even though their bowels be coming out through it.\u201d\n\u201cIf so,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cI have nothing to say; but God knows I would rather your worship complained when any-\nthing ailed you. For my part, I confess I must complain however small the ache may be; unless this rule about not\ncomplaining extends to the squires of knights-errant also.\u201d\nDon Quixote could not help laughing at his squire\u2019s simplicity, and he assured him he might complain when-\never and however he chose, just as he liked, for, so far, he had never read of anything to the contrary in the order of\nknighthood.\nSancho bade him remember it was dinner-time, to which his master answered that he wanted nothing himself\njust then, but that he might eat when he had a mind. With this permission Sancho settled himself as comfortably as\nhe could on his beast, and taking out of the alforjas34 what he had stowed away in them, he jogged along behind his\nmaster munching deliberately, and from time to time taking a pull at the bota35 with a relish that the thirstiest tapster\nin Malaga might have envied; and while he went on in this way, gulping down draught after draught, he never gave a\nthought to any of the promises his master had made him, nor did he rate it as hardship but rather as recreation going\nin quest of adventures, however dangerous they might be. Finally they passed the night among some trees, from\none of which Don Quixote plucked a dry branch to serve him after a fashion as a lance, and fixed on it the head he\nhad removed from the broken one. All that night Don Quixote lay awake thinking of his lady Dulcinea, in order to\nconform to what he had read in his books, how many a night in the forests and deserts knights used to lie sleepless\nsupported by the memory of their mistresses. Not so did Sancho Panza spend it, for having his stomach full of some-\nthing stronger than chicory water he made but one sleep of it, and, if his master had not called him, neither the rays\nof the sun beating on his face nor all the cheery notes of the birds welcoming the approach of day would have had\npower to waken him. On getting up he tried the bota and found it somewhat less full than the night before, which\ngrieved his heart because they did not seem to be on the way to remedy the deficiency readily. Don Quixote did not\ncare to break his fast, for, as has been already said, he confined himself to savoury recollections for nourishment.\nThey returned to the road they had set out with, leading to Puerto Lapice, and at three in the afternoon they\ncame in sight of it. \u201cHere, brother Sancho Panza,\u201d said Don Quixote when he saw it, \u201cwe may plunge our hands\nup to the elbows in what they call adventures; but observe, even shouldst thou see me in the greatest danger in the\nworld, thou must not put a hand to thy sword in my defence, unless indeed thou perceivest that those who assail me\nare rabble or base folk; for in that case thou mayest very properly aid me; but if they be knights it is on no account\npermitted or allowed thee by the laws of knighthood to help me until thou hast been dubbed a knight.\u201d\n\u201cMost certainly, senor,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cyour worship shall be fully obeyed in this matter; all the more as of\n32 El Sabio Frest\u00f3n is a magician and a figment of Quixote\u2019s imagination.\n33 Spanish Muslims.\n34 saddle-bags.\n35 canteen.\n35 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nmyself I am peaceful and no friend to mixing in strife and quarrels: it is true that as regards the defence of my\nown person I shall not give much heed to those laws, for laws human and divine allow each one to defend himself\nagainst any assailant whatever.\u201d\n\u201cThat I grant,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cbut in this matter of aiding me against knights thou must put a restraint\nupon thy natural impetuosity.\u201d\n\u201cI will do so, I promise you,\u201d answered Sancho, \u201cand will keep this precept as carefully as Sunday.\u201d\nWhile they were thus talking there appeared on the road two friars of the order of St. Benedict, mounted on\ntwo dromedaries, for not less tall were the two mules they rode on. They wore travelling spectacles and carried sun-\nshades; and behind them came a coach attended by four or five persons on horseback and two muleteers on foot.\nIn the coach there was, as afterwards appeared, a Biscay lady on her way to Seville, where her husband was about\nto take passage for the Indies with an appointment of high honour. The friars, though going the same road, were\nnot in her company; but the moment Don Quixote perceived them he said to his squire, \u201cEither I am mistaken, or\nthis is going to be the most famous adventure that has ever been seen, for those black bodies we see there must be,\nand doubtless are, magicians who are carrying off some stolen princess in that coach, and with all my might I must\nundo this wrong.\u201d\n\u201cThis will be worse than the windmills,\u201d said Sancho. \u201cLook, senor; those are friars of St. Benedict, and the coach\nplainly belongs to some travellers: I tell you to mind well what you are about and don\u2019t let the devil mislead you.\u201d\n\u201cI have told thee already, Sancho,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cthat on the subject of adventures thou knowest little.\nWhat I say is the truth, as thou shalt see presently.\u201d\nSo saying, he advanced and posted himself in the middle of the road along which the friars were coming, and\nas soon as he thought they had come near enough to hear what he said, he cried aloud, \u201cDevilish and unnatural\nbeings, release instantly the highborn princesses whom you are carrying off by force in this coach, else prepare to\nmeet a speedy death as the just punishment of your evil deeds.\u201d\nThe friars drew rein and stood wondering at the appearance of Don Quixote as well as at his words, to which\nthey replied, \u201cSenor Caballero, we are not devilish or unnatural, but two brothers of St. Benedict following our road,\nnor do we know whether or not there are any captive princesses coming in this coach.\u201d\n\u201cNo soft words with me, for I know you, lying rabble,\u201d said Don Quixote, and without waiting for a reply he\nspurred Rocinante and with levelled lance charged the first friar with such fury and determination, that, if the friar\nhad not flung himself off the mule, he would have brought him to the ground against his will, and sore wounded, if\nnot killed outright. The second brother, seeing how his comrade was treated, drove his heels into his castle of a mule\nand made off across the country faster than the wind.\nSancho Panza, when he saw the friar on the ground, dismounting briskly from his ass, rushed towards him and\nbegan to strip off his gown. At that instant the friars muleteers came up and asked what he was stripping him for.\nSancho answered them that this fell to him lawfully as spoil of the battle which his lord Don Quixote had won. The\nmuleteers, who had no idea of a joke and did not understand all this about battles and spoils, seeing that Don Quix-\note was some distance off talking to the travellers in the coach, fell upon Sancho, knocked him down, and leaving\nhardly a hair in his beard, belaboured him with kicks and left him stretched breathless and senseless on the ground;\nand without any more delay helped the friar to mount, who, trembling, terrified, and pale, as soon as he found him-\nself in the saddle, spurred after his companion, who was standing at a distance looking on, watching the result of\nthe onslaught; then, not caring to wait for the end of the affair just begun, they pursued their journey making more\ncrosses than if they had the devil after them.\nDon Quixote was, as has been said, speaking to the lady in the coach: \u201cYour beauty, lady mine,\u201d said he, \u201cmay\nnow dispose of your person as may be most in accordance with your pleasure, for the pride of your ravishers lies\nprostrate on the ground through this strong arm of mine; and lest you should be pining to know the name of your\ndeliverer, know that I am called Don Quixote of La Mancha, knight-errant and adventurer, and captive to the peer-\nless and beautiful lady Dulcinea del Toboso: and in return for the service you have received of me I ask no more\nthan that you should return to El Toboso, and on my behalf present yourself before that lady and tell her what I\nhave done to set you free.\u201d\nOne of the squires in attendance upon the coach, a Biscayan, was listening to all Don Quixote was saying, and,\nperceiving that he would not allow the coach to go on, but was saying it must return at once to El Toboso, he made\nat him, and seizing his lance addressed him in bad Castilian and worse Biscayan after his fashion, \u201cBegone, caballe-\nro, and ill go with thee; by the God that made me, unless thou quittest coach, slayest thee as art here a Biscayan.\u201d\nDon Quixote understood him quite well, and answered him very quietly, \u201cIf thou wert a knight, as thou art\nnone, I should have already chastised thy folly and rashness, miserable creature.\u201d To which the Biscayan returned,\n\u201cI no gentleman!\u2014I swear to God thou liest as I am Christian: if thou droppest lance and drawest sword, soon shalt\nthou see thou art carrying water to the cat: Biscayan on land, hidalgo at sea, hidalgo at the devil, and look, if thou\nsayest otherwise thou liest.\u201d\n36 Don Quixote\n\u201c\u2019\u201dYou will see presently,\u201d said Agrajes,\u201d36 replied Don Quixote; and throwing his lance on the ground he drew\nhis sword, braced his buckler on his arm, and attacked the Biscayan, bent upon taking his life.\nThe Biscayan, when he saw him coming on, though he wished to dismount from his mule, in which, being one\nof those sorry ones let out for hire, he had no confidence, had no choice but to draw his sword; it was lucky for him,\nhowever, that he was near the coach, from which he was able to snatch a cushion that served him for a shield; and\nthey went at one another as if they had been two mortal enemies. The others strove to make peace between them,\nbut could not, for the Biscayan declared in his disjointed phrase that if they did not let him finish his battle he\nwould kill his mistress and everyone that strove to prevent him. The lady in the coach, amazed and terrified at what\nshe saw, ordered the coachman to draw aside a little, and set herself to watch this severe struggle, in the course of\nwhich the Biscayan smote Don Quixote a mighty stroke on the shoulder over the top of his buckler, which, given to\none without armour, would have cleft him to the waist. Don Quixote, feeling the weight of this prodigious blow,\ncried aloud, saying, \u201cO lady of my soul, Dulcinea, flower of beauty, come to the aid of this your knight, who, in\nfulfilling his obligations to your beauty, finds himself in\nthis extreme peril.\u201d To say this, to lift his sword, to shelter\nhimself well behind his buckler, and to assail the Biscayan\nwas the work of an instant, determined as he was to\nventure all upon a single blow. The Biscayan, seeing him\ncome on in this way, was convinced of his courage by his\nspirited bearing, and resolved to follow his example, so he\nwaited for him keeping well under cover of his cushion,\nbeing unable to execute any sort of manoeuvre with his\nmule, which, dead tired and never meant for this kind of\ngame, could not stir a step.\nOn, then, as aforesaid, came Don Quixote against the\nwary Biscayan, with uplifted sword and a firm intention\nof splitting him in half, while on his side the Biscayan\nwaited for him sword in hand, and under the protection\nof his cushion; and all present stood trembling, waiting in\nsuspense the result of blows such as threatened to fall, and\nthe lady in the coach and the rest of her following were\nmaking a thousand vows and offerings to all the images\nand shrines of Spain, that God might deliver her squire\nand all of them from this great peril in which they found\nthemselves. But it spoils all, that at this point and crisis the\nauthor of the history leaves this battle impending, giving\nas excuse that he could find nothing more written about\nthese achievements of Don Quixote than what has been\nalready set forth. It is true the second author of this work\nwas unwilling to believe that a history so curious could\nhave been allowed to fall under the sentence of oblivion,\nor that the wits of La Mancha could have been so undis-\ncerning as not to preserve in their archives or registries Image 11.5: Don Quixote de la Mancha and Sancho\nsome documents referring to this famous knight; and this Panza | Illustration by Gustave Dor\u00e9 depicting Don Quixote\nand Sancho Panza.\nbeing his persuasion, he did not despair of finding the\nconclusion of this pleasant history, which, heaven favour-\nAuthor: Gustave Dor\u00e9\ning him, he did find in a way that shall be related in the\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nSecond Part. License: Public Domain\nCHAPter Ix.\nIN WHICH IS CONCLUDED AND FINISHED THE TERRIFIC BATTLE BETWEEN THE GALLANT BIS-\nCAYAN AND THE VALIANT MANCHEGAN\nIn the First Part of this history we left the valiant Biscayan and the renowned Don Quixote with drawn swords uplift-\ned, ready to deliver two such furious slashing blows that if they had fallen full and fair they would at least have split and\ncleft them asunder from top to toe and laid them open like a pomegranate; and at this so critical point the delightful his-\ntory came to a stop and stood cut short without any intimation from the author where what was missing was to be found.\n36 Quixote quotes from Amadis of Gaul; Agrajes was a great knight and a cousin of Amadis.\n37 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThis distressed me greatly, because the pleasure derived from having read such a small portion turned to vex-\nation at the thought of the poor chance that presented itself of finding the large part that, so it seemed to me, was\nmissing of such an interesting tale. It appeared to me to be a thing impossible and contrary to all precedent that so\ngood a knight should have been without some sage to undertake the task of writing his marvellous achievements;\na thing that was never wanting to any of those knights-errant who, they say, went after adventures; for every one\nof them had one or two sages as if made on purpose, who not only recorded their deeds but described their most\ntrifling thoughts and follies, however secret they might be; and such a good knight could not have been so unfor-\ntunate as not to have what Platir and others like him had in abundance. And so I could not bring myself to believe\nthat such a gallant tale had been left maimed and mutilated, and I laid the blame on Time, the devourer and de-\nstroyer of all things, that had either concealed or consumed it.\nOn the other hand, it struck me that, inasmuch as among his books there had been found such modern ones\nas \u201cThe Enlightenment of Jealousy\u201d and the \u201cNymphs and Shepherds of Henares,\u201d his story must likewise be\nmodern, and that though it might not be written, it might exist in the memory of the people of his village and of\nthose in the neighbourhood. This reflection kept me perplexed and longing to know really and truly the whole\nlife and wondrous deeds of our famous Spaniard, Don Quixote of La Mancha, light and mirror of Manchegan\nchivalry, and the first that in our age and in these so evil days devoted himself to the labour and exercise of the\narms of knight-errantry, righting wrongs, succouring widows, and protecting damsels of that sort that used to ride\nabout, whip in hand, on their palfreys, with all their virginity about them, from mountain to mountain and valley\nto valley\u2014for, if it were not for some ruffian, or boor with a hood and hatchet, or monstrous giant, that forced\nthem, there were in days of yore damsels that at the end of eighty years, in all which time they had never slept a\nday under a roof, went to their graves as much maids as the mothers that bore them. I say, then, that in these and\nother respects our gallant Don Quixote is worthy of everlasting and notable praise, nor should it be withheld even\nfrom me for the labour and pains spent in searching for the conclusion of this delightful history; though I know\nwell that if Heaven, chance and good fortune had not helped me, the world would have remained deprived of an\nentertainment and pleasure that for a couple of hours or so may well occupy him who shall read it attentively. The\ndiscovery of it occurred in this way.\nOne day, as I was in the Alcana of Toledo, a boy came up to sell some pamphlets and old papers to a silk mercer,\nand, as I am fond of reading even the very scraps of paper in the streets, led by this natural bent of mine I took up\none of the pamphlets the boy had for sale, and saw that it was in characters which I recognised as Arabic, and as I\nwas unable to read them though I could recognise them, I looked about to see if there were any Spanish-speaking\nMorisco at hand to read them for me; nor was there any great difficulty in finding such an interpreter, for even had\nI sought one for an older and better language I should have found him. In short, chance provided me with one, who\nwhen I told him what I wanted and put the book into his hands, opened it in the middle and after reading a little in\nit began to laugh. I asked him what he was laughing at, and he replied that it was at something the book had written\nin the margin by way of a note. I bade him tell it to me; and he still laughing said, \u201cIn the margin, as I told you, this\nis written: \u2018This Dulcinea del Toboso so often mentioned in this history, had, they say, the best hand of any woman\nin all La Mancha for salting pigs.\u2019\u201d\nWhen I heard Dulcinea del Toboso named, I was struck with surprise and amazement, for it occurred to me at\nonce that these pamphlets contained the history of Don Quixote. With this idea I pressed him to read the begin-\nning, and doing so, turning the Arabic offhand into Castilian, he told me it meant, \u201cHistory of Don Quixote of La\nMancha, written by Cide Hamete Benengeli, an Arab historian.\u201d It required great caution to hide the joy I felt when\nthe title of the book reached my ears, and snatching it from the silk mercer, I bought all the papers and pamphlets\nfrom the boy for half a real; and if he had had his wits about him and had known how eager I was for them, he\nmight have safely calculated on making more than six reals by the bargain. I withdrew at once with the Morisco\ninto the cloister of the cathedral, and begged him to turn all these pamphlets that related to Don Quixote into the\nCastilian tongue, without omitting or adding anything to them, offering him whatever payment he pleased. He was\nsatisfied with two arrobas of raisins and two bushels of wheat, and promised to translate them faithfully and with\nall despatch; but to make the matter easier, and not to let such a precious find out of my hands, I took him to my\nhouse, where in little more than a month and a half he translated the whole just as it is set down here.\nIn the first pamphlet the battle between Don Quixote and the Biscayan was drawn to the very life, they planted\nin the same attitude as the history describes, their swords raised, and the one protected by his buckler, the other\nby his cushion, and the Biscayan\u2019s mule so true to nature that it could be seen to be a hired one a bowshot off. The\nBiscayan had an inscription under his feet which said, \u201cDon Sancho de Azpeitia,\u201d which no doubt must have been\nhis name; and at the feet of Rocinante was another that said, \u201cDon Quixote.\u201d Rocinante was marvellously portrayed,\nso long and thin, so lank and lean, with so much backbone and so far gone in consumption, that he showed plain-\nly with what judgment and propriety the name of Rocinante had been bestowed upon him. Near him was Sancho\nPanza holding the halter of his ass, at whose feet was another label that said, \u201cSancho Zancas,\u201d and according to the\n38 Don Quixote\npicture, he must have had a big belly, a short body, and long shanks, for which reason, no doubt, the names of Panza\nand Zancas were given him, for by these two surnames the history several times calls him. Some other trifling par-\nticulars might be mentioned, but they are all of slight importance and have nothing to do with the true relation of\nthe history; and no history can be bad so long as it is true.\nIf against the present one any objection be raised on the score of its truth, it can only be that its author was an\nArab, as lying is a very common propensity with those of that nation; though, as they are such enemies of ours, it is\nconceivable that there were omissions rather than additions made in the course of it. And this is my own opinion;\nfor, where he could and should give freedom to his pen in praise of so worthy a knight, he seems to me deliberately\nto pass it over in silence; which is ill done and worse contrived, for it is the business and duty of historians to be ex-\nact, truthful, and wholly free from passion, and neither interest nor fear, hatred nor love, should make them swerve\nfrom the path of truth, whose mother is history, rival of time, storehouse of deeds, witness for the past, example and\ncounsel for the present, and warning for the future. In this I know will be found all that can be desired in the pleas-\nantest, and if it be wanting in any good quality, I maintain it is the fault of its hound of an author and not the fault\nof the subject. To be brief, its Second Part, according to the translation, began in this way:\nWith trenchant swords upraised and poised on high, it seemed as though the two valiant and wrathful combat-\nants stood threatening heaven, and earth, and hell, with such resolution and determination did they bear them-\nselves. The fiery Biscayan was the first to strike a blow, which was delivered with such force and fury that had not\nthe sword turned in its course, that single stroke would have sufficed to put an end to the bitter struggle and to all\nthe adventures of our knight; but that good fortune which reserved him for greater things, turned aside the sword\nof his adversary, so that although it smote him upon the left shoulder, it did him no more harm than to strip all that\nside of its armour, carrying away a great part of his helmet with half of his ear, all which with fearful ruin fell to the\nground, leaving him in a sorry plight.\nGood God! Who is there that could properly describe the rage that filled the heart of our Manchegan when he\nsaw himself dealt with in this fashion? All that can be said is, it was such that he again raised himself in his stirrups,\nand, grasping his sword more firmly with both hands, he came down on the Biscayan with such fury, smiting him\nfull over the cushion and over the head, that\u2014even so good a shield proving useless\u2014as if a mountain had fallen\non him, he began to bleed from nose, mouth, and ears, reeling as if about to fall backwards from his mule, as no\ndoubt he would have done had he not flung his arms about its neck; at the same time, however, he slipped his feet\nout of the stirrups and then unclasped his arms, and the mule, taking fright at the terrible blow, made off across the\nplain, and with a few plunges flung its master to the ground. Don Quixote stood looking on very calmly, and, when\nhe saw him fall, leaped from his horse and with great briskness ran to him, and, presenting the point of his sword\nto his eyes, bade him surrender, or he would cut his head off. The Biscayan was so bewildered that he was unable to\nanswer a word, and it would have gone hard with him, so blind was Don Quixote, had not the ladies in the coach,\nwho had hitherto been watching the combat in great terror, hastened to where he stood and implored him with ear-\nnest entreaties to grant them the great grace and favour of sparing their squire\u2019s life; to which Don Quixote replied\nwith much gravity and dignity, \u201cIn truth, fair ladies, I am well content to do what ye ask of me; but it must be on\none condition and understanding, which is that this knight promise me to go to the village of El Toboso, and on my\nbehalf present himself before the peerless lady Dulcinea, that she deal with him as shall be most pleasing to her.\u201d\nThe terrified and disconsolate ladies, without discussing Don Quixote\u2019s demand or asking who Dulcinea might\nbe, promised that their squire should do all that had been commanded.\n\u201cThen, on the faith of that promise,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cI shall do him no further harm, though he well de-\nserves it of me.\u201d\nCHAPter x.\nOF THE PLEASANT DISCOURSE THAT PASSED BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS SQUIRE SANCHO PANZA\nNow by this time Sancho had risen, rather the worse for the handling of the friars\u2019 muleteers, and stood watch-\ning the battle of his master, Don Quixote, and praying to God in his heart that it might be his will to grant him the\nvictory, and that he might thereby win some island to make him governor of, as he had promised. Seeing, therefore,\nthat the struggle was now over, and that his master was returning to mount Rocinante, he approached to hold the\nstirrup for him, and, before he could mount, he went on his knees before him, and taking his hand, kissed it saying,\n\u201cMay it please your worship, Senor Don Quixote, to give me the government of that island which has been won\nin this hard fight, for be it ever so big I feel myself in sufficient force to be able to govern it as much and as well as\nanyone in the world who has ever governed islands.\u201d\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \u201cThou must take notice, brother Sancho, that this adventure and those like it are\nnot adventures of islands, but of cross-roads, in which nothing is got except a broken head or an ear the less: have pa-\ntience, for adventures will present themselves from which I may make you, not only a governor, but something more.\u201d\n39 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nSancho gave him many thanks, and again kissing his hand and the skirt of his hauberk, helped him to mount\nRocinante, and mounting his ass himself, proceeded to follow his master, who at a brisk pace, without taking leave,\nor saying anything further to the ladies belonging to the coach, turned into a wood that was hard by. Sancho fol-\nlowed him at his ass\u2019s best trot, but Rocinante stepped out so that, seeing himself left behind, he was forced to call to\nhis master to wait for him. Don Quixote did so, reining in Rocinante until his weary squire came up, who on reach-\ning him said, \u201cIt seems to me, senor, it would be prudent in us to go and take refuge in some church, for, seeing how\nmauled he with whom you fought has been left, it will be no wonder if they give information of the affair to the\nHoly Brotherhood and arrest us, and, faith, if they do, before we come out of gaol we shall have to sweat for it.\u201d\n\u201cPeace,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cwhere hast thou ever seen or heard that a knight-errant has been arraigned before a\ncourt of justice, however many homicides he may have committed?\u201d\n\u201cI know nothing about omecils,\u201d answered Sancho, \u201cnor in my life have had anything to do with one; I only\nknow that the Holy Brotherhood looks after those who fight in the fields, and in that other matter I do not meddle.\u201d\n\u201cThen thou needst have no uneasiness, my friend,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cfor I will deliver thee out of the hands of\nthe Chaldeans, much more out of those of the Brotherhood. But tell me, as thou livest, hast thou seen a more val-\niant knight than I in all the known world; hast thou read in history of any who has or had higher mettle in attack,\nmore spirit in maintaining it, more dexterity in wounding or skill in overthrowing?\u201d\n\u201cThe truth is,\u201d answered Sancho, \u201cthat I have never read any history, for I can neither read nor write, but what I\nwill venture to bet is that a more daring master than your worship I have never served in all the days of my life, and\nGod grant that this daring be not paid for where I have said; what I beg of your worship is to dress your wound, for\na great deal of blood flows from that ear, and I have here some lint and a little white ointment in the alforjas.\u201d\n\u201cAll that might be well dispensed with,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cif I had remembered to make a vial of the balsam of\nFierabras, for time and medicine are saved by one single drop.\u201d\n\u201cWhat vial and what balsam is that?\u201d said Sancho Panza.\n\u201cIt is a balsam,\u201d answered Don Quixote, \u201cthe receipt of which I have in my memory, with which one need have\nno fear of death, or dread dying of any wound; and so when I make it and give it to thee thou hast nothing to do\nwhen in some battle thou seest they have cut me in half through the middle of the body\u2014as is wont to happen\nfrequently,\u2014but neatly and with great nicety, ere the blood congeal, to place that portion of the body which shall\nhave fallen to the ground upon the other half which remains in the saddle, taking care to fit it on evenly and exactly.\nThen thou shalt give me to drink but two drops of the balsam I have mentioned, and thou shalt see me become\nsounder than an apple.\u201d\n\u201cIf that be so,\u201d said Panza, \u201cI renounce henceforth the government of the promised island, and desire noth-\ning more in payment of my many and faithful services than that your worship give me the receipt of this supreme\nliquor, for I am persuaded it will be worth more than two reals an ounce anywhere, and I want no more to pass the\nrest of my life in ease and honour; but it remains to be told if it costs much to make it.\u201d\n\u201cWith less than three reals, six quarts of it may be made,\u201d said Don Quixote.\n\u201cSinner that I am!\u201d said Sancho, \u201cthen why does your worship put off making it and teaching it to me?\u201d\n\u201cPeace, friend,\u201d answered Don Quixote; \u201cgreater secrets I mean to teach thee and greater favours to bestow\nupon thee; and for the present let us see to the dressing, for my ear pains me more than I could wish.\u201d\nSancho took out some lint and ointment from the alforjas; but when Don Quixote came to see his helmet shat-\ntered, he was like to lose his senses, and clapping his hand upon his sword and raising his eyes to heaven, be said, \u201cI\nswear by the Creator of all things and the four Gospels in their fullest extent, to do as the great Marquis of Mantua\ndid when he swore to avenge the death of his nephew Baldwin (and that was not to eat bread from a table-cloth, nor\nembrace his wife, and other points which, though I cannot now call them to mind, I here grant as expressed) until I\ntake complete vengeance upon him who has committed such an offence against me.\u201d\nHearing this, Sancho said to him, \u201cYour worship should bear in mind, Senor Don Quixote, that if the knight\nhas done what was commanded him in going to present himself before my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, he will have\ndone all that he was bound to do, and does not deserve further punishment unless he commits some new offence.\u201d\n\u201cThou hast said well and hit the point,\u201d answered Don Quixote; and so I recall the oath in so far as relates to\ntaking fresh vengeance on him, but I make and confirm it anew to lead the life I have said until such time as I take\nby force from some knight another helmet such as this and as good; and think not, Sancho, that I am raising smoke\nwith straw in doing so, for I have one to imitate in the matter, since the very same thing to a hair happened in the\ncase of Mambrino\u2019s helmet, which cost Sacripante so dear.\u201d\n\u201cSenor,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201clet your worship send all such oaths to the devil, for they are very pernicious to sal-\nvation and prejudicial to the conscience; just tell me now, if for several days to come we fall in with no man armed\nwith a helmet, what are we to do? Is the oath to be observed in spite of all the inconvenience and discomfort it will\nbe to sleep in your clothes, and not to sleep in a house, and a thousand other mortifications contained in the oath of\nthat old fool the Marquis of Mantua, which your worship is now wanting to revive? Let your worship observe that\n40 Don Quixote\nthere are no men in armour travelling on any of these roads, nothing but carriers and carters, who not only do not\nwear helmets, but perhaps never heard tell of them all their lives.\u201d\n\u201cThou art wrong there,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cfor we shall not have been above two hours among these cross-\nroads before we see more men in armour than came to Albraca to win the fair Angelica.\u201d\n\u201cEnough,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cso be it then, and God grant us success, and that the time for winning that island\nwhich is costing me so dear may soon come, and then let me die.\u201d\n\u201cI have already told thee, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cnot to give thyself any uneasiness on that score; for if an\nisland should fail, there is the kingdom of Denmark, or of Sobradisa, which will fit thee as a ring fits the finger, and\nall the more that, being on terra firma, thou wilt all the better enjoy thyself. But let us leave that to its own time; see\nif thou hast anything for us to eat in those alforjas, because we must presently go in quest of some castle where we\nmay lodge to-night and make the balsam I told thee of, for I swear to thee by God, this ear is giving me great pain.\u201d\n\u201cI have here an onion and a little cheese and a few scraps of bread,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cbut they are not victuals fit for\na valiant knight like your worship.\u201d\n\u201cHow little thou knowest about it,\u201d answered Don Quixote; \u201cI would have thee to know, Sancho, that it is the\nglory of knights-errant to go without eating for a month, and even when they do eat, that it should be of what\ncomes first to hand; and this would have been clear to thee hadst thou read as many histories as I have, for, though\nthey are very many, among them all I have found no mention made of knights-errant eating, unless by accident or\nat some sumptuous banquets prepared for them, and the rest of the time they passed in dalliance. And though it\nis plain they could not do without eating and performing all the other natural functions, because, in fact, they were\nmen like ourselves, it is plain too that, wandering as they did the most part of their lives through woods and wilds\nand without a cook, their most usual fare would be rustic viands such as those thou now offer me; so that, friend San-\ncho, let not that distress thee which pleases me, and do not seek to make a new world or pervert knight-errantry.\u201d\n\u201cPardon me, your worship,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor, as I cannot read or write, as I said just now, I neither know nor\ncomprehend the rules of the profession of chivalry: henceforward I will stock the alforjas with every kind of dry\nfruit for your worship, as you are a knight; and for myself, as I am not one, I will furnish them with poultry and\nother things more substantial.\u201d\n\u201cI do not say, Sancho,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cthat it is imperative on knights-errant not to eat anything else but\nthe fruits thou speakest of; only that their more usual diet must be those, and certain herbs they found in the fields\nwhich they knew and I know too.\u201d\n\u201cA good thing it is,\u201d answered Sancho, \u201cto know those herbs, for to my thinking it will be needful some day to\nput that knowledge into practice.\u201d\nAnd here taking out what he said he had brought, the pair made their repast peaceably and sociably. But anx-\nious to find quarters for the night, they with all despatch made an end of their poor dry fare, mounted at once, and\nmade haste to reach some habitation before night set in; but daylight and the hope of succeeding in their object failed\nthem close by the huts of some goatherds, so they determined to pass the night there, and it was as much to Sancho\u2019s\ndiscontent not to have reached a house, as it was to his master\u2019s satisfaction to sleep under the open heaven, for he\nfancied that each time this happened to him he performed an act of ownership that helped to prove his chivalry.\nCHAPter xLIx.\nWHICH TREATS OF THE SHREWD CONVERSATION WHICH SANCHO PANZA HELD WITH HIS MASTER\nDON QUIXOTE\n\u201cAha, I have caught you,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cthis is what in my heart and soul I was longing to know. Come now,\nsenor, can you deny what is commonly said around us, when a person is out of humour, \u2018I don\u2019t know what ails\nso-and-so, that he neither eats, nor drinks, nor sleeps, nor gives a proper answer to any question; one would think\nhe was enchanted\u2019? From which it is to be gathered that those who do not eat, or drink, or sleep, or do any of the\nnatural acts I am speaking of-that such persons are enchanted; but not those that have the desire your worship has,\nand drink when drink is given them, and eat when there is anything to eat, and answer every question that is asked\nthem.\u201d\n\u201cWhat thou sayest is true, Sancho,\u201d replied Don Quixote; \u201cbut I have already told thee there are many sorts of\nenchantments, and it may be that in the course of time they have been changed one for another, and that now it\nmay be the way with enchanted people to do all that I do, though they did not do so before; so it is vain to argue or\ndraw inferences against the usage of the time. I know and feel that I am enchanted, and that is enough to ease my\nconscience; for it would weigh heavily on it if I thought that I was not enchanted, and that in a faint-hearted and\ncowardly way I allowed myself to lie in this cage, defrauding multitudes of the succour I might afford to those in\nneed and distress, who at this very moment may be in sore want of my aid and protection.\u201d\n\u201cStill for all that,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cI say that, for your greater and fuller satisfaction, it would be well if your\n41 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nworship were to try to get out of this prison (and I promise to do all in my power to help, and even to take you out of\nit), and see if you could once more mount your good Rocinante, who seems to be enchanted too, he is so melancholy\nand dejected; and then we might try our chance in looking for adventures again; and if we have no luck there will\nbe time enough to go back to the cage; in which, on the faith of a good and loyal squire, I promise to shut myself up\nalong with your worship, if so be you are so unfortunate, or I so stupid, as not to be able to carry out my plan.\u201d\n\u201cI am content to do as thou sayest, brother Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand when thou seest an opportunity for\neffecting my release I will obey thee absolutely; but thou wilt see, Sancho, how mistaken thou art in thy conception\nof my misfortune.\u201d\nThe knight-errant and the ill-errant squire kept up their conversation till they reached the place where the\ncurate, the canon, and the barber, who had already dismounted, were waiting for them. The carter at once unyoked\nthe oxen and left them to roam at large about the pleasant green spot, the freshness of which seemed to invite, not\nenchanted people like Don Quixote, but wide-awake, sensible folk like his squire, who begged the curate to allow\nhis master to leave the cage for a little; for if they did not let him out, the prison might not be as clean as the propri-\nety of such a gentleman as his master required. The curate understood him, and said he would very gladly comply\nwith his request, only that he feared his master, finding himself at liberty, would take to his old courses and make\noff where nobody could ever find him again.\n\u201cI will answer for his not running away,\u201d said Sancho.\n\u201cAnd I also,\u201d said the canon, \u201cespecially if he gives me his word as a knight not to leave us without our consent.\u201d\nDon Quixote, who was listening to all this, said, \u201cI give it;-moreover one who is enchanted as I am cannot do as\nhe likes with himself; for he who had enchanted him could prevent his moving from one place for three ages, and if\nhe attempted to escape would bring him back flying.\u201d\u2014And that being so, they might as well release him, particu-\nlarly as it would be to the advantage of all; for, if they did not let him out, he protested he would be unable to avoid\noffending their nostrils unless they kept their distance.\nThe canon took his hand, tied together as they both were, and on his word and promise they unbound him, and\nrejoiced beyond measure he was to find himself out of the cage. The first thing he did was to stretch himself all over,\nand then he went to where Rocinante was standing and giving him a couple of slaps on the haunches said, \u201cI still\ntrust in God and in his blessed mother, O flower and mirror of steeds, that we shall soon see ourselves, both of us,\nas we wish to be, thou with thy master on thy back, and I mounted upon thee, following the calling for which God\nsent me into the world.\u201d And so saying, accompanied by Sancho, he withdrew to a retired spot, from which he came\nback much relieved and more eager than ever to put his squire\u2019s scheme into execution.\nThe canon gazed at him, wondering at the extraordinary nature of his madness, and that in all his remarks and\nreplies he should show such excellent sense, and only lose his stirrups, as has been already said, when the subject of\nchivalry was broached. And so, moved by compassion, he said to him, as they all sat on the green grass awaiting the\narrival of the provisions:\n\u201cIs it possible, gentle sir, that the nauseous and idle reading of books of chivalry can have had such an effect on\nyour worship as to upset your reason so that you fancy yourself enchanted, and the like, all as far from the truth\nas falsehood itself is? How can there be any human understanding that can persuade itself there ever was all that\ninfinity of Amadises in the world, or all that multitude of famous knights, all those emperors of Trebizond, all those\nFelixmartes of Hircania, all those palfreys, and damsels-errant, and serpents, and monsters, and giants, and mar-\nvellous adventures, and enchantments of every kind, and battles, and prodigious encounters, splendid costumes,\nlove-sick princesses, squires made counts, droll dwarfs, love letters, billings and cooings, swashbuckler women, and,\nin a word, all that nonsense the books of chivalry contain? For myself, I can only say that when I read them, so long\nas I do not stop to think that they are all lies and frivolity, they give me a certain amount of pleasure; but when I\ncome to consider what they are, I fling the very best of them at the wall, and would fling it into the fire if there were\none at hand, as richly deserving such punishment as cheats and impostors out of the range of ordinary toleration,\nand as founders of new sects and modes of life, and teachers that lead the ignorant public to believe and accept as\ntruth all the folly they contain. And such is their audacity, they even dare to unsettle the wits of gentlemen of birth\nand intelligence, as is shown plainly by the way they have served your worship, when they have brought you to such\na pass that you have to be shut up in a cage and carried on an ox-cart as one would carry a lion or a tiger from place\nto place to make money by showing it. Come, Senor Don Quixote, have some compassion for yourself, return to the\nbosom of common sense, and make use of the liberal share of it that heaven has been pleased to bestow upon you,\nemploying your abundant gifts of mind in some other reading that may serve to benefit your conscience and add to\nyour honour. And if, still led away by your natural bent, you desire to read books of achievements and of chivalry,\nread the Book of Judges in the Holy Scriptures, for there you will find grand reality, and deeds as true as they are\nheroic. Lusitania had a Viriatus, Rome a Caesar, Carthage a Hannibal, Greece an Alexander, Castile a Count Fernan\nGonzalez, Valencia a Cid, Andalusia a Gonzalo Fernandez, Estremadura a Diego Garcia de Paredes, Jerez a Garci\nPerez de Vargas, Toledo a Garcilaso, Seville a Don Manuel de Leon, to read of whose valiant deeds will entertain\n42 Don Quixote\nand instruct the loftiest minds and fill them with delight and wonder. Here, Senor Don Quixote, will be reading\nworthy of your sound understanding; from which you will rise learned in history, in love with virtue, strengthened\nin goodness, improved in manners, brave without rashness, prudent without cowardice; and all to the honour of\nGod, your own advantage and the glory of La Mancha, whence, I am informed, your worship derives your birth.\u201d\nDon Quixote listened with the greatest attention to the canon\u2019s words, and when he found he had finished, after\nregarding him for some time, he replied to him:\n\u201cIt appears to me, gentle sir, that your worship\u2019s discourse is intended to persuade me that there never were any\nknights-errant in the world, and that all the books of chivalry are false, lying, mischievous and useless to the State,\nand that I have done wrong in reading them, and worse in believing them, and still worse in imitating them, when\nI undertook to follow the arduous calling of knight-errantry which they set forth; for you deny that there ever were\nAmadises of Gaul or of Greece, or any other of the knights of whom the books are full.\u201d\n\u201cIt is all exactly as you state it,\u201d said the canon; to which Don Quixote returned, \u201cYou also went on to say that\nbooks of this kind had done me much harm, inasmuch as they had upset my senses, and shut me up in a cage, and\nthat it would be better for me to reform and change my studies, and read other truer books which would afford\nmore pleasure and instruction.\u201d\n\u201cJust so,\u201d said the canon.\n\u201cWell then,\u201d returned Don Quixote, \u201cto my mind it is you who are the one that is out of his wits and enchant-\ned, as you have ventured to utter such blasphemies against a thing so universally acknowledged and accepted as\ntrue that whoever denies it, as you do, deserves the same punishment which you say you inflict on the books that\nirritate you when you read them. For to try to persuade anybody that Amadis, and all the other knights-adventur-\ners with whom the books are filled, never existed, would be like trying to persuade him that the sun does not yield\nlight, or ice cold, or earth nourishment. What wit in the world can persuade another that the story of the Princess\nFloripes and Guy of Burgundy is not true, or that of Fierabras and the bridge of Mantible, which happened in the\ntime of Charlemagne? For by all that is good it is as true as that it is daylight now; and if it be a lie, it must be a lie\ntoo that there was a Hector, or Achilles, or Trojan war, or Twelve Peers of France, or Arthur of England, who still\nlives changed into a raven, and is unceasingly looked for in his kingdom. One might just as well try to make out\nthat the history of Guarino Mezquino, or of the quest of the Holy Grail, is false, or that the loves of Tristram and the\nQueen Yseult are apocryphal, as well as those of Guinevere and Lancelot, when there are persons who can almost\nremember having seen the Dame Quintanona, who was the best cupbearer in Great Britain. And so true is this, that\nI recollect a grandmother of mine on the father\u2019s side, whenever she saw any dame in a venerable hood, used to say\nto me, \u2018Grandson, that one is like Dame Quintanona,\u2019 from which I conclude that she must have known her, or at\nleast had managed to see some portrait of her. Then who can deny that the story of Pierres and the fair Magalona\nis true, when even to this day may be seen in the king\u2019s armoury the pin with which the valiant Pierres guided the\nwooden horse he rode through the air, and it is a trifle bigger than the pole of a cart? And alongside of the pin is\nBabieca\u2019s saddle, and at Roncesvalles there is Roland\u2019s horn, as large as a large beam; whence we may infer that there\nwere Twelve Peers, and a Pierres, and a Cid, and other knights like them, of the sort people commonly call adven-\nturers. Or perhaps I shall be told, too, that there was no such knight-errant as the valiant Lusitanian Juan de Merlo,\nwho went to Burgundy and in the city of Arras fought with the famous lord of Charny, Mosen Pierres by name, and\nafterwards in the city of Basle with Mosen Enrique de Remesten, coming out of both encounters covered with fame\nand honour; or adventures and challenges achieved and delivered, also in Burgundy, by the valiant Spaniards Pedro\nBarba and Gutierre Quixada (of whose family I come in the direct male line), when they vanquished the sons of the\nCount of San Polo. I shall be told, too, that Don Fernando de Guevara did not go in quest of adventures to Germa-\nny, where he engaged in combat with Micer George, a knight of the house of the Duke of Austria. I shall be told that\nthe jousts of Suero de Quinones, him of the \u2018Paso,\u2019 and the emprise of Mosen Luis de Falces against the Castilian\nknight, Don Gonzalo de Guzman, were mere mockeries; as well as many other achievements of Christian knights\nof these and foreign realms, which are so authentic and true, that, I repeat, he who denies them must be totally\nwanting in reason and good sense.\u201d\nThe canon was amazed to hear the medley of truth and fiction Don Quixote uttered, and to see how well ac-\nquainted he was with everything relating or belonging to the achievements of his knight-errantry; so he said in reply:\n\u201cI cannot deny, Senor Don Quixote, that there is some truth in what you say, especially as regards the Span-\nish knights-errant; and I am willing to grant too that the Twelve Peers of France existed, but I am not disposed\nto believe that they did all the things that the Archbishop Turpin relates of them. For the truth of the matter is\nthey were knights chosen by the kings of France, and called \u2018Peers\u2019 because they were all equal in worth, rank and\nprowess (at least if they were not they ought to have been), and it was a kind of religious order like those of Santia-\ngo and Calatrava in the present day, in which it is assumed that those who take it are valiant knights of distinction\nand good birth; and just as we say now a Knight of St. John, or of Alcantara, they used to say then a Knight of the\nTwelve Peers, because twelve equals were chosen for that military order. That there was a Cid, as well as a Bernardo\n43 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ndel Carpio, there can be no doubt; but that they did the deeds people say they did, I hold to be very doubtful. In that\nother matter of the pin of Count Pierres that you speak of, and say is near Babieca\u2019s saddle in the Armoury, I confess\nmy sin; for I am either so stupid or so short-sighted, that, though I have seen the saddle, I have never been able to\nsee the pin, in spite of it being as big as your worship says it is.\u201d\n\u201cFor all that it is there, without any manner of doubt,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cand more by token they say it is in-\nclosed in a sheath of cowhide to keep it from rusting.\u201d\n\u201cAll that may be,\u201d replied the canon; \u201cbut, by the orders I have received, I do not remember seeing it. However,\ngranting it is there, that is no reason why I am bound to believe the stories of all those Amadises and of all that mul-\ntitude of knights they tell us about, nor is it reasonable that a man like your worship, so worthy, and with so many\ngood qualities, and endowed with such a good understanding, should allow himself to be persuaded that such wild\ncrazy things as are written in those absurd books of chivalry are really true.\u201d\nCHAPter L.\nOF THE SHREWD CONTROVERSY WHICH DON QUIXOTE AND THE CANON HELD, TOGETHER WITH\nOTHER INCIDENTS\n\u201cA good joke, that!\u201d returned Don Quixote. \u201cBooks that have been printed with the king\u2019s licence, and with the\napprobation of those to whom they have been submitted, and read with universal delight, and extolled by great and\nsmall, rich and poor, learned and ignorant, gentle and simple, in a word by people of every sort, of whatever rank or\ncondition they may be\u2014that these should be lies! And above all when they carry such an appearance of truth with\nthem; for they tell us the father, mother, country, kindred, age, place, and the achievements, step by step, and day by\nday, performed by such a knight or knights! Hush, sir; utter not such blasphemy; trust me I am advising you now to\nact as a sensible man should; only read them, and you will see the pleasure you will derive from them. For, come, tell\nme, can there be anything more delightful than to see, as it were, here now displayed before us a vast lake of bubbling\npitch with a host of snakes and serpents and lizards, and ferocious and terrible creatures of all sorts swimming about in\nit, while from the middle of the lake there comes a plaintive voice saying: \u2018Knight, whosoever thou art who beholdest\nthis dread lake, if thou wouldst win the prize that lies hidden beneath these dusky waves, prove the valour of thy stout\nheart and cast thyself into the midst of its dark burning waters, else thou shalt not be worthy to see the mighty won-\nders contained in the seven castles of the seven Fays that lie beneath this black expanse;\u2019 and then the knight, almost\nere the awful voice has ceased, without stopping to consider, without pausing to reflect upon the danger to which he\nis exposing himself, without even relieving himself of the weight of his massive armour, commending himself to God\nand to his lady, plunges into the midst of the boiling lake, and when he little looks for it, or knows what his fate is to be,\nhe finds himself among flowery meadows, with which the Elysian fields are not to be compared.\n\u201cThe sky seems more transparent there, and the sun shines with a strange brilliancy, and a delightful grove of\ngreen leafy trees presents itself to the eyes and charms the sight with its verdure, while the ear is soothed by the\nsweet untutored melody of the countless birds of gay plumage that flit to and fro among the interlacing branches.\nHere he sees a brook whose limpid waters, like liquid crystal, ripple over fine sands and white pebbles that look like\nsifted gold and purest pearls. There he perceives a cunningly wrought fountain of many-coloured jasper and pol-\nished marble; here another of rustic fashion where the little mussel-shells and the spiral white and yellow mansions\nof the snail disposed in studious disorder, mingled with fragments of glittering crystal and mock emeralds, make up\na work of varied aspect, where art, imitating nature, seems to have outdone it.\n\u201cSuddenly there is presented to his sight a strong castle or gorgeous palace with walls of massy gold, turrets of\ndiamond and gates of jacinth; in short, so marvellous is its structure that though the materials of which it is built are\nnothing less than diamonds, carbuncles, rubies, pearls, gold, and emeralds, the workmanship is still more rare. And\nafter having seen all this, what can be more charming than to see how a bevy of damsels comes forth from the gate\nof the castle in gay and gorgeous attire, such that, were I to set myself now to depict it as the histories describe it to\nus, I should never have done; and then how she who seems to be the first among them all takes the bold knight who\nplunged into the boiling lake by the hand, and without addressing a word to him leads him into the rich palace or\ncastle, and strips him as naked as when his mother bore him, and bathes him in lukewarm water, and anoints him all\nover with sweet-smelling unguents, and clothes him in a shirt of the softest sendal, all scented and perfumed, while\nanother damsel comes and throws over his shoulders a mantle which is said to be worth at the very least a city, and\neven more? How charming it is, then, when they tell us how, after all this, they lead him to another chamber where\nhe finds the tables set out in such style that he is filled with amazement and wonder; to see how they pour out water\nfor his hands distilled from amber and sweet-scented flowers; how they seat him on an ivory chair; to see how the\ndamsels wait on him all in profound silence; how they bring him such a variety of dainties so temptingly prepared\nthat the appetite is at a loss which to select; to hear the music that resounds while he is at table, by whom or whence\nproduced he knows not. And then when the repast is over and the tables removed, for the knight to recline in the\n44 Don Quixote\nchair, picking his teeth perhaps as usual, and a damsel, much lovelier than any of the others, to enter unexpectedly\nby the chamber door, and herself by his side, and begin to tell him what the castle is, and how she is held enchanted\nthere, and other things that amaze the knight and astonish the readers who are perusing his history.\n\u201cBut I will not expatiate any further upon this, as it may be gathered from it that whatever part of whatever\nhistory of a knight-errant one reads, it will fill the reader, whoever he be, with delight and wonder; and take my ad-\nvice, sir, and, as I said before, read these books and you will see how they will banish any melancholy you may feel\nand raise your spirits should they be depressed. For myself I can say that since I have been a knight-errant I have\nbecome valiant, polite, generous, well-bred, magnanimous, courteous, dauntless, gentle, patient, and have learned\nto bear hardships, imprisonments, and enchantments; and though it be such a short time since I have seen myself\nshut up in a cage like a madman, I hope by the might of my arm, if heaven aid me and fortune thwart me not, to see\nmyself king of some kingdom where I may be able to show the gratitude and generosity that dwell in my heart; for\nby my faith, senor, the poor man is incapacitated from showing the virtue of generosity to anyone, though he may\npossess it in the highest degree; and gratitude that consists of disposition only is a dead thing, just as faith without\nworks is dead. For this reason I should be glad were fortune soon to offer me some opportunity of making myself\nan emperor, so as to show my heart in doing good to my friends, particularly to this poor Sancho Panza, my squire,\nwho is the best fellow in the world; and I would gladly give him a county I have promised him this ever so long,\nonly that I am afraid he has not the capacity to govern his realm.\u201d\nSancho partly heard these last words of his master, and said to him, \u201cStrive hard you, Senor Don Quixote, to\ngive me that county so often promised by you and so long looked for by me, for I promise you there will be no want\nof capacity in me to govern it; and even if there is, I have heard say there are men in the world who farm seigniories,\npaying so much a year, and they themselves taking charge of the government, while the lord, with his legs stretched\nout, enjoys the revenue they pay him, without troubling himself about anything else. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll do, and not\nstand haggling over trifles, but wash my hands at once of the whole business, and enjoy my rents like a duke, and let\nthings go their own way.\u201d\n\u201cThat, brother Sancho,\u201d said the canon, \u201conly holds good as far as the enjoyment of the revenue goes; but the\nlord of the seigniory must attend to the administration of justice, and here capacity and sound judgment come in,\nand above all a firm determination to find out the truth; for if this be wanting in the beginning, the middle and the\nend will always go wrong; and God as commonly aids the honest intentions of the simple as he frustrates the evil\ndesigns of the crafty.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand those philosophies,\u201d returned Sancho Panza; \u201call I know is I would I had the county as soon\nas I shall know how to govern it; for I have as much soul as another, and as much body as anyone, and I shall be as\nmuch king of my realm as any other of his; and being so I should do as I liked, and doing as I liked I should please\nmyself, and pleasing myself I should be content, and when one is content he has nothing more to desire, and when\none has nothing more to desire there is an end of it; so let the county come, and God he with you, and let us see one\nanother, as one blind man said to the other.\u201d\n\u201cThat is not bad philosophy thou art talking, Sancho,\u201d said the canon; \u201cbut for all that there is a good deal to be\nsaid on this matter of counties.\u201d\nTo which Don Quixote returned, \u201cI know not what more there is to be said; I only guide myself by the example\nset me by the great Amadis of Gaul, when he made his squire count of the Insula Firme; and so, without any scruples\nof conscience, I can make a count of Sancho Panza, for he is one of the best squires that ever knight-errant had.\u201d\nThe canon was astonished at the methodical nonsense (if nonsense be capable of method) that Don Quixote\nuttered, at the way in which he had described the adventure of the knight of the lake, at the impression that the\ndeliberate lies of the books he read had made upon him, and lastly he marvelled at the simplicity of Sancho, who\ndesired so eagerly to obtain the county his master had promised him.\nBy this time the canon\u2019s servants, who had gone to the inn to fetch the sumpter mule, had returned, and making a\ncarpet and the green grass of the meadow serve as a table, they seated themselves in the shade of some trees and made\ntheir repast there, that the carter might not be deprived of the advantage of the spot, as has been already said. As they\nwere eating they suddenly heard a loud noise and the sound of a bell that seemed to come from among some brambles\nand thick bushes that were close by, and the same instant they observed a beautiful goat, spotted all over black, white,\nand brown, spring out of the thicket with a goatherd after it, calling to it and uttering the usual cries to make it stop or\nturn back to the fold. The fugitive goat, scared and frightened, ran towards the company as if seeking their protection\nand then stood still, and the goatherd coming up seized it by the horns and began to talk to it as if it were possessed\nof reason and understanding: \u201cAh wanderer, wanderer, Spotty, Spotty; how have you gone limping all this time? What\nwolves have frightened you, my daughter? Won\u2019t you tell me what is the matter, my beauty? But what else can it be\nexcept that you are a she, and cannot keep quiet? A plague on your humours and the humours of those you take after!\nCome back, come back, my darling; and if you will not be so happy, at any rate you will be safe in the fold or with your\ncompanions; for if you who ought to keep and lead them, go wandering astray, what will become of them?\u201d\n45 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThe goatherd\u2019s talk amused all who heard it, but especially the canon, who said to him, \u201cAs you live, brother,\ntake it easy, and be not in such a hurry to drive this goat back to the fold; for, being a female, as you say, she will\nfollow her natural instinct in spite of all you can do to prevent it. Take this morsel and drink a sup, and that will\nsoothe your irritation, and in the meantime the goat will rest herself,\u201d and so saying, he handed him the loins of a\ncold rabbit on a fork.\nThe goatherd took it with thanks, and drank and calmed himself, and then said, \u201cI should be sorry if your worships\nwere to take me for a simpleton for having spoken so seriously as I did to this animal; but the truth is there is a certain\nmystery in the words I used. I am a clown, but not so much of one but that I know how to behave to men and to beasts.\u201d\n\u201cThat I can well believe,\u201d said the curate, \u201cfor I know already by experience that the woods breed men of learn-\ning, and shepherds\u2019 harbour philosophers.\u201d\n\u201cAt all events, senor,\u201d returned the goatherd, \u201cthey shelter men of experience; and that you may see the truth of\nthis and grasp it, though I may seem to put myself forward without being asked, I will, if it will not tire you, gentle-\nmen, and you will give me your attention for a little, tell you a true story which will confirm this gentleman\u2019s word\n(and he pointed to the curate) as well as my own.\u201d\nTo this Don Quixote replied, \u201cSeeing that this affair has a certain colour of chivalry about it, I for my part,\nbrother, will hear you most gladly, and so will all these gentlemen, from the high intelligence they possess and their\nlove of curious novelties that interest, charm, and entertain the mind, as I feel quite sure your story will do. So be-\ngin, friend, for we are all prepared to listen.\u201d\n\u201cI draw my stakes,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cand will retreat with this pasty to the brook there, where I mean to victual my-\nself for three days; for I have heard my lord, Don Quixote, say that a knight-errant\u2019s squire should eat until he can\nhold no more, whenever he has the chance, because it often happens them to get by accident into a wood so thick\nthat they cannot find a way out of it for six days; and if the man is not well filled or his alforjas well stored, there he\nmay stay, as very often he does, turned into a dried mummy.\u201d\n\u201cThou art in the right of it, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cgo where thou wilt and eat all thou canst, for I have had\nenough, and only want to give my mind its refreshment, as I shall by listening to this good fellow\u2019s story.\u201d\n\u201cIt is what we shall all do,\u201d said the canon; and then begged the goatherd to begin the promised tale.\nThe goatherd gave the goat which he held by the horns a couple of slaps on the back, saying, \u201cLie down here\nbeside me, Spotty, for we have time enough to return to our fold.\u201d The goat seemed to understand him, for as her\nmaster seated himself, she stretched herself quietly beside him and looked up in his face to show him she was all\nattention to what he was going to say, and then in these words he began his story.\nCHAPter LI.\nWHICH DEALS WITH WHAT THE GOATHERD TOLD THOSE WHO WERE CARRYING OFF DON QUIXOTE\nThree leagues from this valley there is a village which, though small, is one of the richest in all this neighbour-\nhood, and in it there lived a farmer, a very worthy man, and so much respected that, although to be so is the natural\nconsequence of being rich, he was even more respected for his virtue than for the wealth he had acquired. But what\nmade him still more fortunate, as he said himself, was having a daughter of such exceeding beauty, rare intelligence,\ngracefulness, and virtue, that everyone who knew her and beheld her marvelled at the extraordinary gifts with\nwhich heaven and nature had endowed her. As a child she was beautiful, she continued to grow in beauty, and at the\nage of sixteen she was most lovely. The fame of her beauty began to spread abroad through all the villages around\u2014\nbut why do I say the villages around, merely, when it spread to distant cities, and even made its way into the halls of\nroyalty and reached the ears of people of every class, who came from all sides to see her as if to see something rare\nand curious, or some wonder-working image?\nHer father watched over her and she watched over herself; for there are no locks, or guards, or bolts that can\nprotect a young girl better than her own modesty. The wealth of the father and the beauty of the daughter led many\nneighbours as well as strangers to seek her for a wife; but he, as one might well be who had the disposal of so rich a\njewel, was perplexed and unable to make up his mind to which of her countless suitors he should entrust her. I was\none among the many who felt a desire so natural, and, as her father knew who I was, and I was of the same town, of\npure blood, in the bloom of life, and very rich in possessions, I had great hopes of success. There was another of the\nsame place and qualifications who also sought her, and this made her father\u2019s choice hang in the balance, for he felt\nthat on either of us his daughter would be well bestowed; so to escape from this state of perplexity he resolved to re-\nfer the matter to Leandra (for that is the name of the rich damsel who has reduced me to misery), reflecting that as\nwe were both equal it would be best to leave it to his dear daughter to choose according to her inclination\u2014a course\nthat is worthy of imitation by all fathers who wish to settle their children in life. I do not mean that they ought to\nleave them to make a choice of what is contemptible and bad, but that they should place before them what is good\nand then allow them to make a good choice as they please. I do not know which Leandra chose; I only know her\n46 Don Quixote\nfather put us both off with the tender age of his daughter and vague words that neither bound him nor dismissed\nus. My rival is called Anselmo and I myself Eugenio\u2014that you may know the names of the personages that figure in\nthis tragedy, the end of which is still in suspense, though it is plain to see it must be disastrous.\nAbout this time there arrived in our town one Vicente de la Roca, the son of a poor peasant of the same town,\nthe said Vicente having returned from service as a soldier in Italy and divers other parts. A captain who chanced\nto pass that way with his company had carried him off from our village when he was a boy of about twelve years,\nand now twelve years later the young man came back in a soldier\u2019s uniform, arrayed in a thousand colours, and all\nover glass trinkets and fine steel chains. To-day he would appear in one gay dress, to-morrow in another; but all\nflimsy and gaudy, of little substance and less worth. The peasant folk, who are naturally malicious, and when they\nhave nothing to do can be malice itself, remarked all this, and took note of his finery and jewellery, piece by piece,\nand discovered that he had three suits of different colours, with garters and stockings to match; but he made so\nmany arrangements and combinations out of them, that if they had not counted them, anyone would have sworn\nthat he had made a display of more than ten suits of clothes and twenty plumes. Do not look upon all this that I am\ntelling you about the clothes as uncalled for or spun out, for they have a great deal to do with the story. He used to\nseat himself on a bench under the great poplar in our plaza, and there he would keep us all hanging open-mouthed\non the stories he told us of his exploits. There was no country on the face of the globe he had not seen, nor battle\nhe had not been engaged in; he had killed more Moors than there are in Morocco and Tunis, and fought more\nsingle combats, according to his own account, than Garcilaso, Diego Garcia de Paredes and a thousand others he\nnamed, and out of all he had come victorious without losing a drop of blood. On the other hand he showed marks\nof wounds, which, though they could not be made out, he said were gunshot wounds received in divers encounters\nand actions. Lastly, with monstrous impudence he used to say \u201cyou\u201d to his equals and even those who knew what he\nwas, and declare that his arm was his father and his deeds his pedigree, and that being a soldier he was as good as\nthe king himself. And to add to these swaggering ways he was a trifle of a musician, and played the guitar with such\na flourish that some said he made it speak; nor did his accomplishments end here, for he was something of a poet\ntoo, and on every trifle that happened in the town he made a ballad a league long.\nThis soldier, then, that I have described, this Vicente de la Roca, this bravo, gallant, musician, poet, was often\nseen and watched by Leandra from a window of her house which looked out on the plaza. The glitter of his showy\nattire took her fancy, his ballads bewitched her (for he gave away twenty copies of every one he made), the tales of\nhis exploits which he told about himself came to her ears; and in short, as the devil no doubt had arranged it, she\nfell in love with him before the presumption of making love to her had suggested itself to him; and as in love-affairs\nnone are more easily brought to an issue than those which have the inclination of the lady for an ally, Leandra and\nVicente came to an understanding without any difficulty; and before any of her numerous suitors had any suspicion\nof her design, she had already carried it into effect, having left the house of her dearly beloved father (for mother\nshe had none), and disappeared from the village with the soldier, who came more triumphantly out of this enter-\nprise than out of any of the large number he laid claim to. All the village and all who heard of it were amazed at the\naffair; I was aghast, Anselmo thunderstruck, her father full of grief, her relations indignant, the authorities all in a\nferment, the officers of the Brotherhood in arms. They scoured the roads, they searched the woods and all quarters,\nand at the end of three days they found the flighty Leandra in a mountain cave, stript to her shift, and robbed of all\nthe money and precious jewels she had carried away from home with her.\nThey brought her back to her unhappy father, and questioned her as to her misfortune, and she confessed\nwithout pressure that Vicente de la Roca had deceived her, and under promise of marrying her had induced her to\nleave her father\u2019s house, as he meant to take her to the richest and most delightful city in the whole world, which\nwas Naples; and that she, ill-advised and deluded, had believed him, and robbed her father, and handed over all\nto him the night she disappeared; and that he had carried her away to a rugged mountain and shut her up in the\neave where they had found her. She said, moreover, that the soldier, without robbing her of her honour, had taken\nfrom her everything she had, and made off, leaving her in the cave, a thing that still further surprised everybody. It\nwas not easy for us to credit the young man\u2019s continence, but she asserted it with such earnestness that it helped to\nconsole her distressed father, who thought nothing of what had been taken since the jewel that once lost can never\nbe recovered had been left to his daughter. The same day that Leandra made her appearance her father removed her\nfrom our sight and took her away to shut her up in a convent in a town near this, in the hope that time may wear\naway some of the disgrace she has incurred. Leandra\u2019s youth furnished an excuse for her fault, at least with those to\nwhom it was of no consequence whether she was good or bad; but those who knew her shrewdness and intelligence\ndid not attribute her misdemeanour to ignorance but to wantonness and the natural disposition of women, which is\nfor the most part flighty and ill-regulated.\nLeandra withdrawn from sight, Anselmo\u2019s eyes grew blind, or at any rate found nothing to look at that gave\nthem any pleasure, and mine were in darkness without a ray of light to direct them to anything enjoyable while\nLeandra was away. Our melancholy grew greater, our patience grew less; we cursed the soldier\u2019s finery and railed at\n47 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nthe carelessness of Leandra\u2019s father. At last Anselmo and I agreed to leave the village and come to this valley; and, he\nfeeding a great flock of sheep of his own, and I a large herd of goats of mine, we pass our life among the trees, giving\nvent to our sorrows, together singing the fair Leandra\u2019s praises, or upbraiding her, or else sighing alone, and to heav-\nen pouring forth our complaints in solitude. Following our example, many more of Leandra\u2019s lovers have come to\nthese rude mountains and adopted our mode of life, and they are so numerous that one would fancy the place had\nbeen turned into the pastoral Arcadia, so full is it of shepherds and sheep-folds; nor is there a spot in it where the\nname of the fair Leandra is not heard. Here one curses her and calls her capricious, fickle, and immodest, there an-\nother condemns her as frail and frivolous; this pardons and absolves her, that spurns and reviles her; one extols her\nbeauty, another assails her character, and in short all abuse her, and all adore her, and to such a pitch has this gener-\nal infatuation gone that there are some who complain of her scorn without ever having exchanged a word with her,\nand even some that bewail and mourn the raging fever of jealousy, for which she never gave anyone cause, for, as I\nhave already said, her misconduct was known before her passion. There is no nook among the rocks, no brookside,\nno shade beneath the trees that is not haunted by some shepherd telling his woes to the breezes; wherever there is\nan echo it repeats the name of Leandra; the mountains ring with \u201cLeandra,\u201d \u201cLeandra\u201d murmur the brooks, and\nLeandra keeps us all bewildered and bewitched, hoping without hope and fearing without knowing what we fear.\nOf all this silly set the one that shows the least and also the most sense is my rival Anselmo, for having so many\nother things to complain of, he only complains of separation, and to the accompaniment of a rebeck, which he plays\nadmirably, he sings his complaints in verses that show his ingenuity. I follow another, easier, and to my mind wiser\ncourse, and that is to rail at the frivolity of women, at their inconstancy, their double dealing, their broken promises,\ntheir unkept pledges, and in short the want of reflection they show in fixing their affections and inclinations. This,\nsirs, was the reason of words and expressions I made use of to this goat when I came up just now; for as she is a\nfemale I have a contempt for her, though she is the best in all my fold. This is the story I promised to tell you, and if\nI have been tedious in telling it, I will not be slow to serve you; my hut is close by, and I have fresh milk and dainty\ncheese there, as well as a variety of toothsome fruit, no less pleasing to the eye than to the palate.\nCHAPter LII.\nOF THE QUARREL THAT DON QUIXOTE HAD WITH THE GOATHERD, TOGETHER WITH THE RARE\nADVENTURE OF THE PENITENTS, WHICH WITH AN EXPENDITURE OF SWEAT HE BROUGHT TO A\nHAPPY CONCLUSION\nThe goatherd\u2019s tale gave great satisfaction to all the hearers, and the canon especially enjoyed it, for he had\nremarked with particular attention the manner in which it had been told, which was as unlike the manner of a\nclownish goatherd as it was like that of a polished city wit; and he observed that the curate had been quite right in\nsaying that the woods bred men of learning. They all offered their services to Eugenio but he who showed himself\nmost liberal in this way was Don Quixote, who said to him, \u201cMost assuredly, brother goatherd, if I found myself\nin a position to attempt any adventure, I would, this very instant, set out on your behalf, and would rescue Lean-\ndra from that convent (where no doubt she is kept against her will), in spite of the abbess and all who might try\nto prevent me, and would place her in your hands to deal with her according to your will and pleasure, observing,\nhowever, the laws of chivalry which lay down that no violence of any kind is to be offered to any damsel. But I trust\nin God our Lord that the might of one malignant enchanter may not prove so great but that the power of another\nbetter disposed may prove superior to it, and then I promise you my support and assistance, as I am bound to do by\nmy profession, which is none other than to give aid to the weak and needy.\u201d\nThe goatherd eyed him, and noticing Don Quixote\u2019s sorry appearance and looks, he was filled with wonder, and\nasked the barber, who was next him, \u201cSenor, who is this man who makes such a figure and talks in such a strain?\u201d\n\u201cWho should it be,\u201d said the barber, \u201cbut the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, the undoer of injustice, the\nrighter of wrongs, the protector of damsels, the terror of giants, and the winner of battles?\u201d\n\u201cThat,\u201d said the goatherd, \u201csounds like what one reads in the books of the knights-errant, who did all that you say\nthis man does; though it is my belief that either you are joking, or else this gentleman has empty lodgings in his head.\u201d\n\u201cYou are a great scoundrel,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand it is you who are empty and a fool. I am fuller than ever was\nthe whoreson bitch that bore you;\u201d and passing from words to deeds, he caught up a loaf that was near him and sent\nit full in the goatherd\u2019s face, with such force that he flattened his nose; but the goatherd, who did not understand\njokes, and found himself roughly handled in such good earnest, paying no respect to carpet, tablecloth, or diners,\nsprang upon Don Quixote, and seizing him by the throat with both hands would no doubt have throttled him, had\nnot Sancho Panza that instant come to the rescue, and grasping him by the shoulders flung him down on the table,\nsmashing plates, breaking glasses, and upsetting and scattering everything on it. Don Quixote, finding himself free,\nstrove to get on top of the goatherd, who, with his face covered with blood, and soundly kicked by Sancho, was on\nall fours feeling about for one of the table-knives to take a bloody revenge with. The canon and the curate, however,\n48 Don Quixote\nprevented him, but the barber so contrived it that he got Don Quixote under him, and rained down upon him such\na shower of fisticuffs that the poor knight\u2019s face streamed with blood as freely as his own. The canon and the curate\nwere bursting with laughter, the officers were capering with delight, and both the one and the other hissed them\non as they do dogs that are worrying one another in a fight. Sancho alone was frantic, for he could not free himself\nfrom the grasp of one of the canon\u2019s servants, who kept him from going to his master\u2019s assistance.\nAt last, while they were all, with the exception of the two bruisers who were mauling each other, in high glee\nand enjoyment, they heard a trumpet sound a note so doleful that it made them all look in the direction whence the\nsound seemed to come. But the one that was most excited by hearing it was Don Quixote, who though sorely against\nhis will he was under the goatherd, and something more than pretty well pummelled, said to him, \u201cBrother devil (for\nit is impossible but that thou must be one since thou hast had might and strength enough to overcome mine), I ask\nthee to agree to a truce for but one hour for the solemn note of yonder trumpet that falls on our ears seems to me\nto summon me to some new adventure.\u201d The goatherd, who was by this time tired of pummelling and being pum-\nmelled, released him at once, and Don Quixote rising to his feet and turning his eyes to the quarter where the sound\nhad been heard, suddenly saw coming down the slope of a hill several men clad in white like penitents.\nThe fact was that the clouds had that year withheld their moisture from the earth, and in all the villages of the\ndistrict they were organising processions, rogations, and penances, imploring God to open the hands of his mercy\nand send the rain; and to this end the people of a village that was hard by were going in procession to a holy her-\nmitage there was on one side of that valley. Don Quixote when he saw the strange garb of the penitents, without re-\nflecting how often he had seen it before, took it into his head that this was a case of adventure, and that it fell to him\nalone as a knight-errant to engage in it; and he was all the more confirmed in this notion, by the idea that an image\ndraped in black they had with them was some illustrious lady that these villains and discourteous thieves were car-\nrying off by force. As soon as this occurred to him he ran with all speed to Rocinante who was grazing at large, and\ntaking the bridle and the buckler from the saddle-bow, he had him bridled in an instant, and calling to Sancho for\nhis sword he mounted Rocinante, braced his buckler on his arm, and in a loud voice exclaimed to those who stood\nby, \u201cNow, noble company, ye shall see how important it is that there should be knights in the world professing the of\nknight-errantry; now, I say, ye shall see, by the deliverance of that worthy lady who is borne captive there, whether\nknights-errant deserve to be held in estimation,\u201d and so saying he brought his legs to bear on Rocinante\u2014for he had\nno spurs\u2014and at a full canter (for in all this veracious history we never read of Rocinante fairly galloping) set off\nto encounter the penitents, though the curate, the canon, and the barber ran to prevent him. But it was out of their\npower, nor did he even stop for the shouts of Sancho calling after him, \u201cWhere are you going, Senor Don Quixote?\nWhat devils have possessed you to set you on against our Catholic faith? Plague take me! mind, that is a proces-\nsion of penitents, and the lady they are carrying on that stand there is the blessed image of the immaculate Virgin.\nTake care what you are doing, senor, for this time it may be safely said you don\u2019t know what you are about.\u201d Sancho\nlaboured in vain, for his master was so bent on coming to quarters with these sheeted figures and releasing the lady\nin black that he did not hear a word; and even had he heard, he would not have turned back if the king had ordered\nhim. He came up with the procession and reined in Rocinante, who was already anxious enough to slacken speed a\nlittle, and in a hoarse, excited voice he exclaimed, \u201cYou who hide your faces, perhaps because you are not good sub-\njects, pay attention and listen to what I am about to say to you.\u201d The first to halt were those who were carrying the\nimage, and one of the four ecclesiastics who were chanting the Litany, struck by the strange figure of Don Quixote,\nthe leanness of Rocinante, and the other ludicrous peculiarities he observed, said in reply to him, \u201cBrother, if you\nhave anything to say to us say it quickly, for these brethren are whipping themselves, and we cannot stop, nor is it\nreasonable we should stop to hear anything, unless indeed it is short enough to be said in two words.\u201d\n\u201cI will say it in one,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cand it is this; that at once, this very instant, ye release that fair lady\nwhose tears and sad aspect show plainly that ye are carrying her off against her will, and that ye have committed\nsome scandalous outrage against her; and I, who was born into the world to redress all such like wrongs, will not\npermit you to advance another step until you have restored to her the liberty she pines for and deserves.\u201d\nFrom these words all the hearers concluded that he must be a madman, and began to laugh heartily, and their\nlaughter acted like gunpowder on Don Quixote\u2019s fury, for drawing his sword without another word he made a rush\nat the stand. One of those who supported it, leaving the burden to his comrades, advanced to meet him, flourishing\na forked stick that he had for propping up the stand when resting, and with this he caught a mighty cut Don Quixo-\nte made at him that severed it in two; but with the portion that remained in his hand he dealt such a thwack on the\nshoulder of Don Quixote\u2019s sword arm (which the buckler could not protect against the clownish assault) that poor\nDon Quixote came to the ground in a sad plight.\nSancho Panza, who was coming on close behind puffing and blowing, seeing him fall, cried out to his assailant not\nto strike him again, for he was poor enchanted knight, who had never harmed anyone all the days of his life; but what\nchecked the clown was, not Sancho\u2019s shouting, but seeing that Don Quixote did not stir hand or foot; and so, fancying\nhe had killed him, he hastily hitched up his tunic under his girdle and took to his heels across the country like a deer.\n49 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nBy this time all Don Quixote\u2019s companions had come up to where he lay; but the processionists seeing them\ncome running, and with them the officers of the Brotherhood with their crossbows, apprehended mischief, and\nclustering round the image, raised their hoods, and grasped their scourges, as the priests did their tapers, and\nawaited the attack, resolved to defend themselves and even to take the offensive against their assailants if they could.\nFortune, however, arranged the matter better than they expected, for all Sancho did was to fling himself on his mas-\nter\u2019s body, raising over him the most doleful and laughable lamentation that ever was heard, for he believed he was\ndead. The curate was known to another curate who walked in the procession, and their recognition of one another\nset at rest the apprehensions of both parties; the first then told the other in two words who Don Quixote was, and\nhe and the whole troop of penitents went to see if the poor gentleman was dead, and heard Sancho Panza saying,\nwith tears in his eyes, \u201cOh flower of chivalry, that with one blow of a stick hast ended the course of thy well-spent\nlife! Oh pride of thy race, honour and glory of all La Mancha, nay, of all the world, that for want of thee will be full\nof evil-doers, no longer in fear of punishment for their misdeeds! Oh thou, generous above all the Alexanders, since\nfor only eight months of service thou hast given me the best island the sea girds or surrounds! Humble with the\nproud, haughty with the humble, encounterer of dangers, endurer of outrages, enamoured without reason, imitator\nof the good, scourge of the wicked, enemy of the mean, in short, knight-errant, which is all that can be said!\u201d\nAt the cries and moans of Sancho, Don Quixote came to himself, and the first word he said was, \u201cHe who lives\nseparated from you, sweetest Dulcinea, has greater miseries to endure than these. Aid me, friend Sancho, to mount the\nenchanted cart, for I am not in a condition to press the saddle of Rocinante, as this shoulder is all knocked to pieces.\u201d\n\u201cThat I will do with all my heart, senor,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cand let us return to our village with these gentlemen,\nwho seek your good, and there we will prepare for making another sally, which may turn out more profitable and\ncreditable to us.\u201d\n\u201cThou art right, Sancho,\u201d returned Don Quixote; \u201cIt will be wise to let the malign influence of the stars which\nnow prevails pass off.\u201d\nThe canon, the curate, and the barber told him he would act very wisely in doing as he said; and so, highly\namused at Sancho Panza\u2019s simplicities, they placed Don Quixote in the cart as before. The procession once more\nformed itself in order and proceeded on its road; the goatherd took his leave of the party; the officers of the Broth-\nerhood declined to go any farther, and the curate paid them what was due to them; the canon begged the curate to\nlet him know how Don Quixote did, whether he was cured of his madness or still suffered from it, and then begged\nleave to continue his journey; in short, they all separated and went their ways, leaving to themselves the curate and\nthe barber, Don Quixote, Sancho Panza, and the good Rocinante, who regarded everything with as great resignation\nas his master. The carter yoked his oxen and made Don Quixote comfortable on a truss of hay, and at his usual de-\nliberate pace took the road the curate directed, and at the end of six days they reached Don Quixote\u2019s village, and en-\ntered it about the middle of the day, which it so happened was a Sunday, and the people were all in the plaza, through\nwhich Don Quixote\u2019s cart passed. They all flocked to see what was in the cart, and when they recognised their\ntownsman they were filled with amazement, and a boy ran off to bring the news to his housekeeper and his niece that\ntheir master and uncle had come back all lean and yellow and stretched on a truss of hay on an ox-cart. It was piteous\nto hear the cries the two good ladies raised, how they beat their breasts and poured out fresh maledictions on those\naccursed books of chivalry; all which was renewed when they saw Don Quixote coming in at the gate.\nAt the news of Don Quixote\u2019s arrival Sancho Panza\u2019s wife came running, for she by this time knew that her hus-\nband had gone away with him as his squire, and on seeing Sancho, the first thing she asked him was if the ass was\nwell. Sancho replied that he was, better than his master was.\n\u201cThanks be to God,\u201d said she, \u201cfor being so good to me; but now tell me, my friend, what have you made by\nyour squirings? What gown have you brought me back? What shoes for your children?\u201d\n\u201cI bring nothing of that sort, wife,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cthough I bring other things of more consequence and value.\u201d\n\u201cI am very glad of that,\u201d returned his wife; \u201cshow me these things of more value and consequence, my friend;\nfor I want to see them to cheer my heart that has been so sad and heavy all these ages that you have been away.\u201d\n\u201cI will show them to you at home, wife,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cbe content for the present; for if it please God that we\nshould again go on our travels in search of adventures, you will soon see me a count, or governor of an island, and\nthat not one of those everyday ones, but the best that is to be had.\u201d\n\u201cHeaven grant it, husband,\u201d said she, \u201cfor indeed we have need of it. But tell me, what\u2019s this about islands, for I\ndon\u2019t understand it?\u201d\n\u201cHoney is not for the mouth of the ass,\u201d returned Sancho; \u201call in good time thou shalt see, wife\u2014nay, thou wilt\nbe surprised to hear thyself called \u2018your ladyship\u2019 by all thy vassals.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about, Sancho, with your ladyships, islands, and vassals?\u201d returned Teresa Panza\u2014for\nso Sancho\u2019s wife was called, though they were not relations, for in La Mancha it is customary for wives to take their\nhusbands\u2019 surnames.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be in such a hurry to know all this, Teresa,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cit is enough that I am telling you the truth, so\nshut your mouth. But I may tell you this much by the way, that there is nothing in the world more delightful than\n50 Don Quixote\nto be a person of consideration, squire to a knight-errant, and a seeker of adventures. To be sure most of those one\nfinds do not end as pleasantly as one could wish, for out of a hundred, ninety-nine will turn out cross and contrary.\nI know it by experience, for out of some I came blanketed, and out of others belaboured. Still, for all that, it is a fine\nthing to be on the look-out for what may happen, crossing mountains, searching woods, climbing rocks, visiting\ncastles, putting up at inns, all at free quarters, and devil take the maravedi to pay.\u201d\nWhile this conversation passed between Sancho Panza and his wife, Don Quixote\u2019s housekeeper and niece took\nhim in and undressed him and laid him in his old bed. He eyed them askance, and could not make out where he\nwas. The curate charged his niece to be very careful to make her uncle comfortable and to keep a watch over him\nlest he should make his escape from them again, telling her what they had been obliged to do to bring him home.\nOn this the pair once more lifted up their voices and renewed their maledictions upon the books of chivalry, and\nimplored heaven to plunge the authors of such lies and nonsense into the midst of the bottomless pit. They were, in\nshort, kept in anxiety and dread lest their uncle and master should give them the slip the moment he found himself\nsomewhat better, and as they feared so it fell out.\nBut the author of this history,\nthough he has devoted research and\nindustry to the discovery of the deeds\nachieved by Don Quixote in his third\nsally, has been unable to obtain any\ninformation respecting them, at any\nrate derived from authentic docu-\nments; tradition has merely preserved\nin the memory of La Mancha the fact\nthat Don Quixote, the third time he\nsallied forth from his home, betook\nhimself to Saragossa, where he was\npresent at some famous jousts which\ncame off in that city, and that he had\nadventures there worthy of his valour\nand high intelligence.

Rabelais\u2019s comedy is all about excess, with lofty ideas mixing with slapstick humor; the\nterm \u201cRabelaisian\u201d now means bawdy humor and extreme caricature.

They were also wildly popular, making a mark on\nboth audiences and writers of comedy alike.\nWritten by Laura J.

Presently they appointed\nhim a great sophister-doctor, called Master Tubal Holofernes, who taught him\nhis ABC so well, that he could say it by heart backwards; and about this he was five years and three months. Then\nread he to him Donat, Le Facet, Theodolet, and Alanus in parabolis. About this he was thirteen years, six months,\nand two weeks. But you must remark that in the mean time he did learn to write in Gothic characters, and that he\nwrote all his books\u2014for the art of printing was not then in use\u2014and did ordinarily carry a great pen and inkhorn,\nweighing about seven thousand quintals (that is, 700,000 pound weight), the penner whereof was as big and as long\nas the great pillars of Enay, and the horn was hanging to it in great iron chains, it being of the wideness of a tun of\nmerchant ware. After that he read unto him the book de modis significandi, with the commentaries of Hurtbise, of\nFasquin, of Tropdieux, of Gualhaut, of John Calf, of Billonio, of Berlinguandus, and a rabble of others; and herein\nhe spent more than eighteen years and eleven months, and was so well versed in it that, to try masteries in school\ndisputes with his condisciples, he would recite it by heart backwards, and did sometimes prove on his finger-ends to\nhis mother, quod de modis significandi non erat scientia. Then did he read to him the compost for knowing the age\nof the moon, the seasons of the year, and tides of the sea, on which he spent sixteen years and two months, and that\njustly at the time that his said preceptor died of the French pox, which was in the year one thousand four hundred\nand twenty. Afterwards he got an old coughing fellow to teach him, named Master Jobelin Bride, or muzzled dolt,\nwho read unto him Hugutio, Hebrard(\u2018s) Grecism, the Doctrinal, the Parts, the Quid est, the Supplementum, Mar-\nmotretus, De moribus in mensa servandis, Seneca de quatuor virtutibus cardinalibus, Passavantus cum commento,\nand Dormi secure for the holidays, and some other of such like mealy stuff, by reading whereof he became as wise\nas any we ever since baked in an oven.\n54 Gargantua and Pantagruel\nChapter 1: XV\nHow Gargantua was put under other schoolmasters\nAt the last his father perceived that indeed he studied hard, and that, although he spent all his time in it, he did\nnevertheless profit nothing, but which is worse, grew thereby foolish, simple, doted, and blockish, whereof making\na heavy regret to Don Philip of Marays, Viceroy or Depute King of Papeligosse, he found that it were better for him\nto learn nothing at all, than to be taught such-like books, under such schoolmasters; because their knowledge was\nnothing but brutishness, and their wisdom but blunt foppish toys, serving only to bastardize good and noble spirits,\nand to corrupt all the flower of youth. That it is so, take, said he, any young boy of this time who hath only studied\ntwo years,\u2014if he have not a better judgment, a better discourse, and that expressed in better terms than your son,\nwith a completer carriage and civility to all manner of persons, account me for ever hereafter a very clounch and\nbacon-slicer of Brene. This pleased Grangousier very well, and he commanded that it should be done. At night at\nsupper, the said Des Marays brought in a young page of his, of Ville-gouges, called Eudemon, so neat, so trim, so\nhandsome in his apparel, so spruce, with his hair in so good order, and so sweet and comely in his behaviour, that\nhe had the resemblance of a little angel more than of a human creature. Then he said to Grangousier, Do you see\nthis young boy? He is not as yet full twelve years old. Let us try, if it please you, what difference there is betwixt the\nknowledge of the doting Mateologians of old time and the young lads that are now. The trial pleased Grangousier,\nand he commanded the page to begin. Then Eudemon, asking leave of the vice-king his master so to do, with his\ncap in his hand, a clear and open countenance, beautiful and ruddy lips, his eyes steady, and his looks fixed upon\nGargantua with a youthful modesty, standing up straight on his feet, began very gracefully to commend him; first,\nfor his virtue and good manners; secondly, for his knowledge, thirdly, for his nobility; fourthly, for his bodily ac-\ncomplishments; and, in the fifth place, most sweetly exhorted him to reverence his father with all due observancy,\nwho was so careful to have him well brought up. In the end he prayed him, that he would vouchsafe to admit of him\namongst the least of his servants; for other favour at that time desired he none of heaven, but that he might do him\nsome grateful and acceptable service. All this was by him delivered with such proper gestures, such distinct pronun-\nciation, so pleasant a delivery, in such exquisite fine terms, and so good Latin, that he seemed rather a Gracchus,\na Cicero, an Aemilius of the time past, than a youth of this age. But all the countenance that Gargantua kept was,\nthat he fell to crying like a cow, and cast down his face, hiding it with his cap, nor could they possibly draw one\nword from him, no more than a fart from a dead ass. Whereat his father was so grievously vexed that he would have\nkilled Master Jobelin, but the said Des Marays withheld him from it by fair persuasions, so that at length he pacified\nhis wrath. Then Grangousier commanded he should be paid his wages, that they should whittle him up soundly,\nlike a sophister, with good drink, and then give him leave to go to all the devils in hell. At least, said he, today shall\nit not cost his host much if by chance he should die as drunk as a Switzer. Master Jobelin being gone out of the\nhouse, Grangousier consulted with the Viceroy what schoolmaster they should choose for him, and it was betwixt\nthem resolved that Ponocrates, the tutor of Eudemon, should have the charge, and that they should go altogether to\nParis, to know what was the study of the young men of France at that time.\nChapter 1: XXIII\nHow Gargantua was instructed by Ponocrates, and in such sort disciplinated, that he lost not one hour of the day\nWhen Ponocrates knew Gargantua\u2019s vicious manner of living, he resolved to bring him up in another kind;\nbut for a while he bore with him, considering that nature cannot endure a sudden change, without great violence.\nTherefore, to begin his work the better, he requested a learned physician of that time, called Master Theodorus,\nseriously to perpend, if it were possible, how to bring Gargantua into a better course. The said physician purged\nhim canonically with Anticyrian hellebore, by which medicine he cleansed all the alteration and perverse habitude\nof his brain. By this means also Ponocrates made him forget all that he had learned under his ancient preceptors, as\nTimotheus did to his disciples, who had been instructed under other musicians. To do this the better, they brought\nhim into the company of learned men, which were there, in whose imitation he had a great desire and affection to\nstudy otherwise, and to improve his parts. Afterwards he put himself into such a road and way of studying, that he\nlost not any one hour in the day, but employed all his time in learning and honest knowledge. Gargantua awaked,\nthen, about four o\u2019clock in the morning. Whilst they were in rubbing of him, there was read unto him some chapter\nof the holy Scripture aloud and clearly, with a pronunciation fit for the matter, and hereunto was appointed a young\npage born in Basche, named Anagnostes. According to the purpose and argument of that lesson, he oftentimes gave\nhimself to worship, adore, pray, and send up his supplications to that good God, whose Word did show his majesty\nand marvellous judgment. Then went he unto the secret places to make excretion of his natural digestions. There\nhis master repeated what had been read, expounding unto him the most obscure and difficult points. In returning,\n55 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nthey considered the face of the sky, if it was such as they had observed it the night before, and into what signs the\nsun was entering, as also the moon for that day. This done, he was apparelled, combed, curled, trimmed, and per-\nfumed, during which time they repeated to him the lessons of the day before. He himself said them by heart, and\nupon them would ground some practical cases concerning the estate of man, which he would prosecute sometimes\ntwo or three hours, but ordinarily they ceased as soon as he was fully clothed. Then for three good hours he had\na lecture read unto him. This done they went forth, still conferring of the substance of the lecture, either unto a\nfield near the university called the Brack, or unto the meadows, where they played at the ball, the long-tennis, and\nat the piletrigone (which is a play wherein we throw a triangular piece of iron at a ring, to pass it), most gallantly\nexercising their bodies, as formerly they had done their minds. All their play was but in liberty, for they left off\nwhen they pleased, and that was commonly when they did sweat over all their body, or were otherwise weary. Then\nwere they very well wiped and rubbed, shifted their shirts, and, walking soberly, went to see if dinner was ready.\nWhilst they stayed for that, they did clearly and eloquently pronounce some sentences that they had retained of the\nlecture. In the meantime Master Appetite came, and then very orderly sat they down at table. At the beginning of\nthe meal there was read some pleasant history of the warlike actions of former times, until he had taken a glass of\nwine. Then, if they thought good, they continued reading, or began to discourse merrily together; speaking first of\nthe virtue, propriety, efficacy, and nature of all that was served in at the table; of bread, of wine, of water, of salt, of\nfleshes, fishes, fruits, herbs, roots, and of their dressing. By means whereof he learned in a little time all the passages\ncompetent for this that were to be found in Pliny, Athenaeus, Dioscorides, Julius Pollux, Galen, Porphyry, Oppian,\nPolybius, Heliodore, Aristotle, Aelian, and others. Whilst they talked of these things, many times, to be the more\ncertain, they caused the very books to be brought to the table, and so well and perfectly did he in his memory retain\nthe things above said, that in that time there was not a physician that knew half so much as he did. Afterwards they\nconferred of the lessons read in the morning, and, ending their repast with some conserve or marmalade of quinc-\nes, he picked his teeth with mastic tooth-pickers, washed his hands and eyes with fair fresh water, and gave thanks\nunto God in some fine cantiques, made in praise of the divine bounty and munificence. This done, they brought in\ncards, not to play, but to learn a thousand pretty tricks and new inventions, which were all grounded upon arithme-\ntic. By this means he fell in love with that numerical science, and every day after dinner and supper he passed his\ntime in it as pleasantly as he was wont to do at cards and dice; so that at last he understood so well both the theory\nand practical part thereof, that Tunstall the Englishman, who had written very largely of that purpose, confessed\nthat verily in comparison of him he had no skill at all. And not only in that, but in the other mathematical sciences,\nas geometry, astronomy, music, &c. For in waiting on the concoction and attending the digestion of his food, they\nmade a thousand pretty instruments and geometrical figures, and did in some measure practise the astronomical\ncanons.\nAfter this they recreated themselves with singing musically, in four or five parts, or upon a set theme or ground\nat random, as it best pleased them. In matter of musical instruments, he learned to play upon the lute, the virginals,\nthe harp, the Almain flute with nine holes, the viol, and the sackbut. This hour thus spent, and digestion finished,\nhe did purge his body of natural excrements, then betook himself to his principal study for three hours together, or\nmore, as well to repeat his matutinal lectures as to proceed in the book wherein he was, as also to write handsomely,\nto draw and form the antique and Roman letters. This being done, they went out of their house, and with them a\nyoung gentleman of Touraine, named the Esquire Gymnast, who taught him the art of riding. Changing then his\nclothes, he rode a Naples courser, a Dutch roussin, a Spanish jennet, a barded or trapped steed, then a light fleet\nhorse, unto whom he gave a hundred carieres, made him go the high saults, bounding in the air, free the ditch with\na skip, leap over a stile or pale, turn short in a ring both to the right and left hand. There he broke not his lance; for\nit is the greatest foolery in the world to say, I have broken ten lances at tilts or in fight. A carpenter can do even as\nmuch. But it is a glorious and praise-worthy action with one lance to break and overthrow ten enemies. Therefore,\nwith a sharp, stiff, strong, and well-steeled lance would he usually force up a door, pierce a harness, beat down a\ntree, carry away the ring, lift up a cuirassier saddle, with the mail-coat and gauntlet. All this he did in complete\narms from head to foot. As for the prancing flourishes and smacking popisms for the better cherishing of the horse,\ncommonly used in riding, none did them better than he. The cavallerize of Ferrara was but as an ape compared to\nhim. He was singularly skilful in leaping nimbly from one horse to another without putting foot to ground, and\nthese horses were called desultories. He could likewise from either side, with a lance in his hand, leap on horseback\nwithout stirrups, and rule the horse at his pleasure without a bridle, for such things are useful in military engage-\nments. Another day he exercised the battle-axe, which he so dexterously wielded, both in the nimble, strong, and\nsmooth management of that weapon, and that in all the feats practicable by it, that he passed knight of arms in the\nfield, and at all essays.\nThen tossed he the pike, played with the two-handed sword, with the backsword, with the Spanish tuck, the\ndagger, poniard, armed, unarmed, with a buckler, with a cloak, with a target. Then would he hunt the hart, the roe-\nbuck, the bear, the fallow deer, the wild boar, the hare, the pheasant, the partridge, and the bustard. He played at the\nballoon, and made it bound in the air, both with fist and foot. He wrestled, ran, jumped\u2014not at three steps and a\n56 Gargantua and Pantagruel\nleap, called the hops, nor at clochepied, called the hare\u2019s leap, nor yet at the Almains; for, said Gymnast, these jumps\nare for the wars altogether unprofitable, and of no use\u2014but at one leap he would skip over a ditch, spring over a\nhedge, mount six paces upon a wall, ramp and grapple after this fashion up against a window of the full height of\na lance. He did swim in deep waters on his belly, on his back, sideways, with all his body, with his feet only, with\none hand in the air, wherein he held a book, crossing thus the breadth of the river of Seine without wetting it, and\ndragged along his cloak with his teeth, as did Julius Caesar; then with the help of one hand he entered forcibly into\na boat, from whence he cast himself again headlong into the water, sounded the depths, hollowed the rocks, and\nplunged into the pits and gulfs. Then turned he the boat about, governed it, led it swiftly or slowly with the stream\nand against the stream, stopped it in his course, guided it with one hand, and with the other laid hard about him\nwith a huge great oar, hoisted the sail, hied up along the mast by the shrouds, ran upon the edge of the decks, set the\ncompass in order, tackled the bowlines, and steered the helm. Coming out of the water, he ran furiously up against a\nhill, and with the same alacrity and swiftness ran down again. He climbed up at trees like a cat, and leaped from the\none to the other like a squirrel. He did pull down the great boughs and branches like another Milo; then with two\nsharp well-steeled daggers and two tried bodkins would he run up by the wall to the very top of a house like a rat;\nthen suddenly came down from the top to the bottom, with such an even composition of members that by the fall\nhe would catch no harm.\nHe did cast the dart, throw the bar, put the stone, practise the javelin, the boar-spear or partisan, and the\nhalbert. He broke the strongest bows in drawing, bended against his breast the greatest crossbows of steel, took\nhis aim by the eye with the hand-gun, and shot well, traversed and planted the cannon, shot at butt-marks, at the\npapgay from below upwards, or to a height from above downwards, or to a descent; then before him, sideways, and\nbehind him, like the Parthians. They tied a cable-rope to the top of a high tower, by one end whereof hanging near\nthe ground he wrought himself with his hands to the very top; then upon the same track came down so sturdily and\nfirm that you could not on a plain meadow have run with more assurance. They set up a great pole fixed upon two\ntrees. There would he hang by his hands, and with them alone, his feet touching at nothing, would go back and fore\nalong the foresaid rope with so great swiftness that hardly could one overtake him with running; and then, to exer-\ncise his breast and lungs, he would shout like all the devils in hell. I heard him once call Eudemon from St. Victor\u2019s\ngate to Montmartre. Stentor had never such a voice at the siege of Troy. Then for the strengthening of his nerves or\nsinews they made him two great sows of lead, each of them weighing eight thousand and seven hundred quintals,\nwhich they called alteres. Those he took up from the ground, in each hand one, then lifted them up over his head,\nand held them so without stirring three quarters of an hour and more, which was an inimitable force. He fought at\nbarriers with the stoutest and most vigorous champions; and when it came to the cope, he stood so sturdily on his\nfeet that he abandoned himself unto the strongest, in case they could remove him from his place, as Milo was wont\nto do of old. In whose imitation, likewise, he held a pomegranate in his hand, to give it unto him that could take it\nfrom him. The time being thus bestowed, and himself rubbed, cleansed, wiped, and refreshed with other clothes, he\nreturned fair and softly; and passing through certain meadows, or other grassy places, beheld the trees and plants,\ncomparing them with what is written of them in the books of the ancients, such as Theophrast, Dioscorides, Mari-\nnus, Pliny, Nicander, Macer, and Galen, and carried home to the house great handfuls of them, whereof a young\npage called Rizotomos had charge; together with little mattocks, pickaxes, grubbing-hooks, cabbies, pruning-knives,\nand other instruments requisite for herborizing. Being come to their lodging, whilst supper was making ready, they\nrepeated certain passages of that which hath been read, and sat down to table. Here remark, that his dinner was\nsober and thrifty, for he did then eat only to prevent the gnawings of his stomach, but his supper was copious and\nlarge, for he took then as much as was fit to maintain and nourish him; which, indeed, is the true diet prescribed by\nthe art of good and sound physic, although a rabble of loggerheaded physicians, nuzzeled in the brabbling shop of\nsophisters, counsel the contrary. During that repast was continued the lesson read at dinner as long as they thought\ngood; the rest was spent in good discourse, learned and profitable. After that they had given thanks, he set himself\nto sing vocally, and play upon harmonious instruments, or otherwise passed his time at some pretty sports, made\nwith cards or dice, or in practising the feats of legerdemain with cups and balls. There they stayed some nights in\nfrolicking thus, and making themselves merry till it was time to go to bed; and on other nights they would go make\nvisits unto learned men, or to such as had been travellers in strange and remote countries. When it was full night\nbefore they retired themselves, they went unto the most open place of the house to see the face of the sky, and there\nbeheld the comets, if any were, as likewise the figures, situations, aspects, oppositions, and conjunctions of both the\nfixed stars and planets.\nThen with his master did he briefly recapitulate, after the manner of the Pythagoreans, that which he had read,\nseen, learned, done, and understood in the whole course of that day.\nThen prayed they unto God the Creator, in falling down before him, and strengthening their faith towards him,\nand glorifying him for his boundless bounty; and, giving thanks unto him for the time that was past, they recom-\nmended themselves to his divine clemency for the future. Which being done, they went to bed, and betook them-\nselves to their repose and rest.\n57 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nChapter 1: XXIV\nHow Gargantua spent his time in rainy weather\nIf it happened that the weather were anything cloudy, foul, and rainy, all the forenoon was employed, as be-\nfore specified, according to custom, with this difference only, that they had a good clear fire lighted to correct the\ndistempers of the air. But after dinner, instead of their wonted exercitations, they did abide within, and, by way\nof apotherapy (that is, a making the body healthful by exercise), did recreate themselves in bottling up of hay, in\ncleaving and sawing of wood, and in threshing sheaves of corn at the barn. Then they studied the art of painting or\ncarving; or brought into use the antique play of tables, as Leonicus hath written of it, and as our good friend Lasca-\nris playeth at it. In playing they examined the passages of ancient authors wherein the said play is mentioned or any\nmetaphor drawn from it. They went likewise to see the drawing of metals, or the casting of great ordnance; how the\nlapidaries did work; as also the goldsmiths and cutters of precious stones. Nor did they omit to visit the alchemists,\nmoney-coiners, upholsterers, weavers, velvet-workers, watchmakers, looking-glass framers, printers, organists, and\nother such kind of artificers, and, everywhere giving them somewhat to drink, did learn and consider the industry\nand invention of the trades. They went also to hear the public lectures, the solemn commencements, the repetitions,\nthe acclamations, the pleadings of the gentle lawyers, and sermons of evangelical preachers. He went through the\nhalls and places appointed for fencing, and there played against the masters themselves at all weapons, and showed\nthem by experience that he knew as much in it as, yea, more than, they. And, instead of herborizing, they visited\nthe shops of druggists, herbalists, and apothecaries, and diligently considered the fruits, roots, leaves, gums, seeds,\nthe grease and ointments of some foreign parts, as also how they did adulterate them. He went to see the jugglers,\ntumblers, mountebanks, and quacksalvers, and considered their cunning, their shifts, their somersaults and smooth\ntongue, especially of those of Chauny in Picardy, who are naturally great praters, and brave givers of fibs, in matter\nof green apes.\nAt their return they did eat more soberly at supper than at other times, and meats more desiccative and exten-\nuating; to the end that the intemperate moisture of the air, communicated to the body by a necessary confinitive,\nmight by this means be corrected, and that they might not receive any prejudice for want of their ordinary bodily\nexercise. Thus was Gargantua governed, and kept on in this course of education, from day to day profiting, as you\nmay understand such a young man of his age may, of a pregnant judgment, with good discipline well continued.\nWhich, although at the beginning it seemed difficult, became a little after so sweet, so easy, and so delightful, that it\nseemed rather the recreation of a king than the study of a scholar. Nevertheless Ponocrates, to divert him from this\nvehement intension of the spirits, thought fit, once in a month, upon some fair and clear day, to go out of the city\nbetimes in the morning, either towards Gentilly, or Boulogne, or to Montrouge, or Charanton bridge, or to Vanves,\nor St. Clou, and there spend all the day long in making the greatest cheer that could be devised, sporting, making\nmerry, drinking healths, playing, singing, dancing, tumbling in some fair meadow, unnestling of sparrows, taking\nof quails, and fishing for frogs and crabs. But although that day was passed without books or lecture, yet was it not\nspent without profit; for in the said meadows they usually repeated certain pleasant verses of Virgil\u2019s agriculture, of\nHesiod and of Politian\u2019s husbandry, would set a-broach some witty Latin epigrams, then immediately turned them\ninto roundelays and songs for dancing in the French language. In their feasting they would sometimes separate the\nwater from the wine that was therewith mixed, as Cato teacheth, De re rustica, and Pliny with an ivy cup would\nwash the wine in a basinful of water, then take it out again with a funnel as pure as ever. They made the water go\nfrom one glass to another, and contrived a thousand little automatory engines, that is to say, moving of themselves.\nChapter 1: LII\nHow Gargantua caused to be built for the Monk the Abbey of Theleme\nThere was left only the monk to provide for, whom Gargantua would have made Abbot of Seville, but he\nrefused it. He would have given him the Abbey of Bourgueil, or of Sanct Florent, which was better, or both, if it\npleased him; but the monk gave him a very peremptory answer, that he would never take upon him the charge nor\ngovernment of monks. For how shall I be able, said he, to rule over others, that have not full power and command\nof myself? If you think I have done you, or may hereafter do any acceptable service, give me leave to found an\nabbey after my own mind and fancy. The motion pleased Gargantua very well, who thereupon offered him all the\ncountry of Theleme by the river of Loire till within two leagues of the great forest of Port-Huaulx. The monk then\nrequested Gargantua to institute his religious order contrary to all others. First, then, said Gargantua, you must not\nbuild a wall about your convent, for all other abbeys are strongly walled and mured about. See, said the monk, and\nnot without cause (seeing wall and mur signify but one and the same thing); where there is mur before and mur\nbehind, there is store of murmur, envy, and mutual conspiracy. Moreover, seeing there are certain convents in the\n58 Gargantua and Pantagruel\nworld whereof the custom is, if any woman come in, I mean chaste and honest women, they immediately sweep\nthe ground which they have trod upon; therefore was it ordained, that if any man or woman entered into religious\norders should by chance come within this new abbey, all the rooms should be thoroughly washed and cleansed\nthrough which they had passed. And because in all other monasteries and nunneries all is compassed, limited, and\nregulated by hours, it was decreed that in this new structure there should be neither clock nor dial, but that ac-\ncording to the opportunities and incident occasions all their hours should be disposed of; for, said Gargantua, the\ngreatest loss of time that I know is to count the hours. What good comes of it? Nor can there be any greater dotage\nin the world than for one to guide and direct his courses by the sound of a bell, and not by his own judgment and\ndiscretion.\nItem, Because at that time they put no women into nunneries but such as were either purblind, blinkards, lame,\ncrooked, ill-favoured, misshapen, fools, senseless, spoiled, or corrupt; nor encloistered any men but those that were\neither sickly, subject to defluxions, ill-bred louts, simple sots, or peevish trouble-houses. But to the purpose, said the\nmonk. A woman that is neither fair nor good, to what use serves she? To make a nun of, said Gargantua. Yea, said\nthe monk, and to make shirts and smocks. Therefore was it ordained that into this religious order should be admit-\nted no women that were not fair, well-featured, and of a sweet disposition; nor men that were not comely, person-\nable, and well conditioned.\nItem, Because in the convents of women men come not but underhand, privily, and by stealth, it was therefore\nenacted that in this house there shall be no women in case there be not men, nor men in case there be not women.\nItem, Because both men and women that are received into religious orders after the expiring of their noviciate\nor probation year were constrained and forced perpetually to stay there all the days of their life, it was therefore or-\ndered that all whatever, men or women, admitted within this abbey, should have full leave to depart with peace and\ncontentment whensoever it should seem good to them so to do.\nItem, for that the religious men and women did ordinarily make three vows, to wit, those of chastity, poverty,\nand obedience, it was therefore constituted and appointed that in this convent they might be honourably married,\nthat they might be rich, and live at liberty. In regard of the legitimate time of the persons to be initiated, and years\nunder and above which they were not capable of reception, the women were to be admitted from ten till fifteen, and\nthe men from twelve till eighteen.\nChapter 1: LIII\nHow the abbey of the Thelemites was built and endowed\nFor the fabric and furniture of the abbey Gargantua caused to be\ndelivered out in ready money seven-and-twenty hundred thousand,\neight hundred and one-and-thirty of those golden rams of Berry\nwhich have a sheep stamped on the one side and a flowered cross on\nthe other; and for every year, until the whole work were completed, he\nallotted threescore nine thousand crowns of the sun, and as many of\nthe seven stars, to be charged all upon the receipt of the custom. For\nthe foundation and maintenance thereof for ever, he settled a perpet-\nual fee-farm-rent of three-and-twenty hundred, three score and nine\nthousand, five hundred and fourteen rose nobles, exempted from all\nhomage, fealty, service, or burden whatsoever, and payable every year\nat the gate of the abbey; and of this by letters patent passed a very good\ngrant. The architecture was in a figure hexagonal, and in such a fashion\nthat in every one of the six corners there was built a great round tower\nof threescore foot in diameter, and were all of a like form and bigness.\nUpon the north side ran along the river of Loire, on the bank where-\nof was situated the tower called Arctic. Going towards the east, there\nwas another called Calaer,\u2014the next following Anatole,\u2014the next\nMesembrine,\u2014the next Hesperia, and the last Criere. Every tower was\ndistant from other the space of three hundred and twelve paces. The\nwhole edifice was everywhere six storeys high, reckoning the cellars\nImage 11.8: Gargantua | The giant Gargan- underground for one.

Between every tower in the midst of the said body of building there was a pair of winding,\nsuch as we now call lantern stairs, whereof the steps were part of porphyry, which is a dark red marble spotted with\nwhite, part of Numidian stone, which is a kind of yellowishly-streaked marble upon various colours, and part of\nserpentine marble, with light spots on a dark green ground, each of those steps being two-and-twenty foot in length\nand three fingers thick, and the just number of twelve betwixt every rest, or, as we now term it, landing-place. In\nevery resting-place were two fair antique arches where the light came in: and by those they went into a cabinet,\nmade even with and of the breadth of the said winding, and the reascending above the roofs of the house ended\nconically in a pavilion. By that vise or winding they entered on every side into a great hall, and from the halls into\nthe chambers. From the Arctic tower unto the Criere were the fair great libraries in Greek, Latin, Hebrew, French,\nItalian, and Spanish, respectively distributed in their several cantons, according to the diversity of these languages.\nIn the midst there was a wonderful scalier or winding-stair, the entry whereof was without the house, in a vault or\narch six fathom broad. It was made in such symmetry and largeness that six men-at-arms with their lances in their\nrests might together in a breast ride all up to the very top of all the palace. From the tower Anatole to the Mesem-\nbrine were fair spacious galleries, all coloured over and painted with the ancient prowesses, histories, and descrip-\ntions of the world. In the midst thereof there was likewise such another ascent and gate as we said there was on the\nriver-side. Upon that gate was written in great antique letters that which followeth.\nChapter 1: LIV\nThe inscription set upon the great gate of Theleme\nHere enter not vile bigots, hypocrites,\nExternally devoted apes, base snites,\nPuffed-up, wry-necked beasts, worse than the Huns,\nOr Ostrogoths, forerunners of baboons:\nCursed snakes, dissembled varlets, seeming sancts,\nSlipshod caffards, beggars pretending wants,\nFat chuffcats, smell-feast knockers, doltish gulls,\nOut-strouting cluster-fists, contentious bulls,\nFomenters of divisions and debates,\nElsewhere, not here, make sale of your deceits.\nYour filthy trumperies\nStuffed with pernicious lies\n(Not worth a bubble),\nWould do but trouble\nOur earthly paradise,\nYour filthy trumperies.\nHere enter not attorneys, barristers,\nNor bridle-champing law-practitioners:\nClerks, commissaries, scribes, nor pharisees,\nWilful disturbers of the people\u2019s ease:\nJudges, destroyers, with an unjust breath,\nOf honest men, like dogs, even unto death.\nYour salary is at the gibbet-foot:\nGo drink there! for we do not here fly out\nOn those excessive courses, which may draw\nA waiting on your courts by suits in law.\nLawsuits, debates, and wrangling\nHence are exiled, and jangling.\n60 Gargantua and Pantagruel\nHere we are very\nFrolic and merry,\nAnd free from all entangling,\nLawsuits, debates, and wrangling.\nHere enter not base pinching usurers,\nPelf-lickers, everlasting gatherers,\nGold-graspers, coin-gripers, gulpers of mists,\nNiggish deformed sots, who, though your chests\nVast sums of money should to you afford,\nWould ne\u2019ertheless add more unto that hoard,\nAnd yet not be content,\u2014you clunchfist dastards,\nInsatiable fiends, and Pluto\u2019s bastards,\nGreedy devourers, chichy sneakbill rogues,\nHell-mastiffs gnaw your bones, you ravenous dogs.\nYou beastly-looking fellows,\nReason doth plainly tell us\nThat we should not\nTo you allot\nRoom here, but at the gallows,\nYou beastly-looking fellows.\nHere enter not fond makers of demurs\nIn love adventures, peevish, jealous curs,\nSad pensive dotards, raisers of garboils,\nHags, goblins, ghosts, firebrands of household broils,\nNor drunkards, liars, cowards, cheaters, clowns,\nThieves, cannibals, faces o\u2019ercast with frowns,\nNor lazy slugs, envious, covetous,\nNor blockish, cruel, nor too credulous,\u2014\nHere mangy, pocky folks shall have no place,\nNo ugly lusks, nor persons of disgrace.\nGrace, honour, praise, delight,\nHere sojourn day and night.\nSound bodies lined\nWith a good mind,\nDo here pursue with might\nGrace, honour, praise, delight.\nHere enter you, and welcome from our hearts,\nAll noble sparks, endowed with gallant parts.\nThis is the glorious place, which bravely shall\nAfford wherewith to entertain you all.\nWere you a thousand, here you shall not want\nFor anything; for what you\u2019ll ask we\u2019ll grant.\nStay here, you lively, jovial, handsome, brisk,\nGay, witty, frolic, cheerful, merry, frisk,\nSpruce, jocund, courteous, furtherers of trades,\nAnd, in a word, all worthy gentle blades.\nBlades of heroic breasts\nShall taste here of the feasts,\nBoth privily\nAnd civilly\nOf the celestial guests,\n61 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nBlades of heroic breasts.\nHere enter you, pure, honest, faithful, true\nExpounders of the Scriptures old and new.\nWhose glosses do not blind our reason, but\nMake it to see the clearer, and who shut\nIts passages from hatred, avarice,\nPride, factions, covenants, and all sort of vice.\nCome, settle here a charitable faith,\nWhich neighbourly affection nourisheth.\nAnd whose light chaseth all corrupters hence,\nOf the blest word, from the aforesaid sense.\nThe holy sacred Word,\nMay it always afford\nT\u2019 us all in common,\nBoth man and woman,\nA spiritual shield and sword,\nThe holy sacred Word.\nHere enter you all ladies of high birth,\nDelicious, stately, charming, full of mirth,\nIngenious, lovely, miniard, proper, fair,\nMagnetic, graceful, splendid, pleasant, rare,\nObliging, sprightly, virtuous, young, solacious,\nKind, neat, quick, feat, bright, compt, ripe, choice, dear, precious.\nAlluring, courtly, comely, fine, complete,\nWise, personable, ravishing, and sweet,\nCome joys enjoy.

Upon the top thereof stood the\nthree Graces, with their cornucopias, or horns of abundance, and did jet out the water at their breasts, mouth, ears,\neyes, and other open passages of the body. The inside of the buildings in this lower court stood upon great pillars\nof chalcedony stone and porphyry marble made archways after a goodly antique fashion. Within those were spa-\ncious galleries, long and large, adorned with curious pictures, the horns of bucks and unicorns: with rhinoceroses,\nwater-horses called hippopotames, the teeth and tusks of elephants, and other things well worth the beholding.\nThe lodging of the ladies, for so we may call those gallant women, took up all from the tower Arctic unto the gate\nMesembrine. The men possessed the rest. Before the said lodging of the ladies, that they might have their recre-\nation, between the two first towers, on the outside, were placed the tiltyard, the barriers or lists for tournaments,\nthe hippodrome or riding-court, the theatre or public playhouse, and natatory or place to swim in, with most\nadmirable baths in three stages, situated above one another, well furnished with all necessary accommodation,\nand store of myrtle-water. By the river-side was the fair garden of pleasure, and in the midst of that the glorious\nlabyrinth. Between the two other towers were the courts for the tennis and the balloon. Towards the tower Criere\nstood the orchard full of all fruit-trees, set and ranged in a quincuncial order. At the end of that was the great park,\nabounding with all sort of venison. Betwixt the third couple of towers were the butts and marks for shooting with a\nsnapwork gun, an ordinary bow for common archery, or with a crossbow. The office-houses were without the tower\n62 Gargantua and Pantagruel\nHesperia, of one storey high. The stables were beyond the offices, and before them stood the falconry, managed\nby ostrich-keepers and falconers very expert in the art, and it was yearly supplied and furnished by the Candians,\nVenetians, Sarmates, now called Muscoviters, with all sorts of most excellent hawks, eagles, gerfalcons, goshawks,\nsacres, lanners, falcons, sparrowhawks, marlins, and other kinds of them, so gentle and perfectly well manned, that,\nflying of themselves sometimes from the castle for their own disport, they would not fail to catch whatever they\nencountered. The venery, where the beagles and hounds were kept, was a little farther off, drawing towards the park.\nAll the halls, chambers, and closets or cabinets were richly hung with tapestry and hangings of divers sorts,\naccording to the variety of the seasons of the year. All the pavements and floors were covered with green cloth. The\nbeds were all embroidered. In every back-chamber or withdrawing-room there was a looking-glass of pure crys-\ntal set in a frame of fine gold, garnished all about with pearls, and was of such greatness that it would represent to\nthe full the whole lineaments and proportion of the person that stood before it. At the going out of the halls which\nbelong to the ladies\u2019 lodgings were the perfumers and trimmers through whose hands the gallants passed when\nthey were to visit the ladies. Those sweet artificers did every morning furnish the ladies\u2019 chambers with the spirit of\nroses, orange-flower-water, and angelica; and to each of them gave a little precious casket vapouring forth the most\nodoriferous exhalations of the choicest aromatical scents.\nChapter 1: LVI\nHow the men and women of the religious order of Theleme were apparelled\nThe ladies at the foundation of this order were apparelled after their own pleasure and liking; but, since that of\ntheir own accord and free will they have reformed themselves, their accoutrement is in manner as followeth. They\nwore stockings of scarlet crimson, or ingrained purple dye, which reached just three inches above the knee, having\na list beautified with exquisite embroideries and rare incisions of the cutter\u2019s art. Their garters were of the colour of\ntheir bracelets, and circled the knee a little both over and under. Their shoes, pumps, and slippers were either of red,\nviolet, or crimson-velvet, pinked and jagged like lobster waddles.\nNext to their smock they put on the pretty kirtle or vasquin of pure silk camlet: above that went the taffety or\ntabby farthingale, of white, red, tawny, grey, or of any other colour. Above this taffety petticoat they had another\nof cloth of tissue or brocade, embroidered with fine gold and interlaced with needlework, or as they thought good,\nand according to the temperature and disposition of the weather had their upper coats of satin, damask, or velvet,\nand those either orange, tawny, green, ash-coloured, blue, yellow, bright red, crimson, or white, and so forth; or had\nthem of cloth of gold, cloth of silver, or some other choice stuff, enriched with purl, or embroidered according to\nthe dignity of the festival days and times wherein they wore them.\nTheir gowns, being still correspondent to the season, were either of cloth of gold frizzled with a silver-raised\nwork; of red satin, covered with gold purl; of tabby, or taffety, white, blue, black, tawny, &c., of silk serge, silk camlet,\nvelvet, cloth of silver, silver tissue, cloth of gold, gold wire, figured velvet, or figured satin tinselled and overcast with\ngolden threads, in divers variously purfled draughts.\nIn the summer some days instead of gowns they wore light handsome mantles, made either of the stuff of the\naforesaid attire, or like Moresco rugs, of violet velvet frizzled, with a raised work of gold upon silver purl, or with\na knotted cord-work of gold embroidery, everywhere garnished with little Indian pearls. They always carried a fair\npanache, or plume of feathers, of the colour of their muff, bravely adorned and tricked out with glistering spangles\nof gold. In the winter time they had their taffety gowns of all colours, as above-named, and those lined with the rich\nfurrings of hind-wolves, or speckled lynxes, black-spotted weasels, martlet skins of Calabria, sables, and other cost-\nly furs of an inestimable value. Their beads, rings, bracelets, collars, carcanets, and neck-chains were all of precious\nstones, such as carbuncles, rubies, baleus, diamonds, sapphires, emeralds, turquoises, garnets, agates, beryls, and\nexcellent margarites. Their head-dressing also varied with the season of the year, according to which they decked\nthemselves. In winter it was of the French fashion; in the spring, of the Spanish; in summer, of the fashion of Tusca-\nny, except only upon the holy days and Sundays, at which times they were accoutred in the French mode, because\nthey accounted it more honourable and better befitting the garb of a matronal pudicity.\nThe men were apparelled after their fashion. Their stockings were of tamine or of cloth serge, of white, black,\nscarlet, or some other ingrained colour. Their breeches were of velvet, of the same colour with their stockings, or\nvery near, embroidered and cut according to their fancy. Their doublet was of cloth of gold, of cloth of silver, of\nvelvet, satin, damask, taffeties, &c., of the same colours, cut, embroidered, and suitably trimmed up in perfection.\nThe points were of silk of the same colours; the tags were of gold well enamelled. Their coats and jerkins were of\ncloth of gold, cloth of silver, gold, tissue or velvet embroidered, as they thought fit. Their gowns were every whit\nas costly as those of the ladies. Their girdles were of silks, of the colour of their doublets. Every one had a gallant\nsword by his side, the hilt and handle whereof were gilt, and the scabbard of velvet, of the colour of his breeches,\nwith a chape of gold, and pure goldsmith\u2019s work. The dagger was of the same. Their caps or bonnets were of black\nvelvet, adorned with jewels and buttons of gold. Upon that they wore a white plume, most prettily and minion-like\n63 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nparted by so many rows of gold spangles, at the end whereof hung dangling in a more sparkling resplendency fair\nrubies, emeralds, diamonds, &c., but there was such a sympathy betwixt the gallants and the ladies, that every day\nthey were apparelled in the same livery. And that they might not miss, there were certain gentlemen appointed to\ntell the youths every morning what vestments the ladies would on that day wear: for all was done according to the\npleasure of the ladies. In these so handsome clothes, and habiliments so rich, think not that either one or other of\neither sex did waste any time at all; for the masters of the wardrobes had all their raiments and apparel so ready\nfor every morning, and the chamber-ladies so well skilled, that in a trice they would be dressed and completely in\ntheir clothes from head to foot. And to have those accoutrements with the more conveniency, there was about the\nwood of Theleme a row of houses of the extent of half a league, very neat and cleanly, wherein dwelt the goldsmiths,\nlapidaries, jewellers, embroiderers, tailors, gold-drawers, velvet-weavers, tapestry-makers and upholsterers, who\nwrought there every one in his own trade, and all for the aforesaid jolly friars and nuns of the new stamp. They were\nfurnished with matter and stuff from the hands of the Lord Nausiclete, who every year brought them seven ships\nfrom the Perlas and Cannibal Islands, laden with ingots of gold, with raw silk, with pearls and precious stones. And\nif any margarites, called unions, began to grow old and lose somewhat of their natural whiteness and lustre, those\nwith their art they did renew by tendering them to eat to some pretty cocks, as they use to give casting unto hawks.\nChapter 1: LVII\nHow the Thelemites were governed, and of their manner of living\nAll their life was spent not in laws, statutes, or rules, but according to their own free will and pleasure. They\nrose out of their beds when they thought good; they did eat, drink, labour, sleep, when they had a mind to it and\nwere disposed for it. None did awake them, none did offer to constrain them to eat, drink, nor to do any other\nthing; for so had Gargantua established it. In all their rule and strictest tie of their order there was but this one\nclause to be observed,\nDo What Thou Wilt; because men that are free, well-born, well-bred, and conversant in honest companies, have\nnaturally an instinct and spur that prompteth them unto virtuous actions, and withdraws them from vice, which\nis called honour. Those same men, when by base subjection and constraint they are brought under and kept down,\nturn aside from that noble disposition by which they formerly were inclined to virtue, to shake off and break that\nbond of servitude wherein they are so tyrannously enslaved; for it is agreeable with the nature of man to long after\nthings forbidden and to desire what is denied us.\nBy this liberty they entered into a very laudable emulation to do all of them what they saw did please one. If\nany of the gallants or ladies should say, Let us drink, they would all drink. If any one of them said, Let us play, they\nall played. If one said, Let us go a-walking into the fields they went all. If it were to go a-hawking or a-hunting, the\nladies mounted upon dainty well-paced nags, seated in a stately palfrey saddle, carried on their lovely fists, min-\niardly begloved every one of them, either a sparrowhawk or a laneret or a marlin, and the young gallants carried the\nother kinds of hawks. So nobly were they taught, that there was neither he nor she amongst them but could read,\nwrite, sing, play upon several musical instruments, speak five or six several languages, and compose in them all very\nquaintly, both in verse and prose. Never were seen so valiant knights, so noble and worthy, so dexterous and skilful\nboth on foot and a-horse-back, more brisk and lively, more nimble and quick, or better handling all manner of\nweapons than were there. Never were seen ladies so proper and handsome, so miniard and dainty, less froward, or\nmore ready with their hand and with their needle in every honest and free action belonging to that sex, than were\nthere. For this reason, when the time came that any man of the said abbey, either at the request of his parents, or for\nsome other cause, had a mind to go out of it, he carried along with him one of the ladies, namely, her whom he had\nbefore that chosen for his mistress, and (they) were married together. And if they had formerly in Theleme lived in\ngood devotion and amity, they did continue therein and increase it to a greater height in their state of matrimony;\nand did entertain that mutual love till the very last day of their life, in no less vigour and fervency than at the very\nday of their wedding. Here must not I forget to set down unto you a riddle which was found under the ground as\nthey were laying the foundation of the abbey, engraven in a copper plate, and it was thus as followeth.\nChapter 1: LVIII\nA prophetical riddle\nPoor mortals, who wait for a happy day,\nCheer up your hearts, and hear what I shall say:\nIf it be lawful firmly to believe\nThat the celestial bodies can us give\nWisdom to judge of things that are not yet;\n64 Gargantua and Pantagruel\nOr if from heaven such wisdom we may get\nAs may with confidence make us discourse\nOf years to come, their destiny and course;\nI to my hearers give to understand\nThat this next winter, though it be at hand,\nYea and before, there shall appear a race\nOf men who, loth to sit still in one place,\nShall boldly go before all people\u2019s eyes,\nSuborning men of divers qualities\nTo draw them unto covenants and sides,\nIn such a manner that, whate\u2019er betides,\nThey\u2019ll move you, if you give them ear, no doubt,\nWith both your friends and kindred to fall out.\nThey\u2019ll make a vassal to gain-stand his lord,\nAnd children their own parents; in a word,\nAll reverence shall then be banished,\nNo true respect to other shall be had.\nThey\u2019ll say that every man should have his turn,\nBoth in his going forth and his return;\nAnd hereupon there shall arise such woes,\nSuch jarrings, and confused to\u2019s and fro\u2019s,\nThat never were in history such coils\nSet down as yet, such tumults and garboils.\nThen shall you many gallant men see by\nValour stirr\u2019d up, and youthful fervency,\nWho, trusting too much in their hopeful time,\nLive but a while, and perish in their prime.\nNeither shall any, who this course shall run,\nLeave off the race which he hath once begun,\nTill they the heavens with noise by their contention\nHave fill\u2019d, and with their steps the earth\u2019s dimension.\nThen those shall have no less authority,\nThat have no faith, than those that will not lie;\nFor all shall be governed by a rude,\nBase, ignorant, and foolish multitude;\nThe veriest lout of all shall be their judge,\nO horrible and dangerous deluge!\nDeluge I call it, and that for good reason,\nFor this shall be omitted in no season;\nNor shall the earth of this foul stir be free,\nTill suddenly you in great store shall see\nThe waters issue out, with whose streams the\nMost moderate of all shall moistened be,\nAnd justly too; because they did not spare\nThe flocks of beasts that innocentest are,\nBut did their sinews and their bowels take,\nNot to the gods a sacrifice to make,\nBut usually to serve themselves for sport:\nAnd now consider, I do you exhort,\nIn such commotions so continual,\nWhat rest can take the globe terrestrial?\nMost happy then are they, that can it hold,\nAnd use it carefully as precious gold,\nBy keeping it in gaol, whence it shall have\nNo help but him who being to it gave.\nAnd to increase his mournful accident,\nThe sun, before it set in th\u2019 occident,\n65 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nShall cease to dart upon it any light,\nMore than in an eclipse, or in the night,\u2014\nSo that at once its favour shall be gone,\nAnd liberty with it be left alone.\nAnd yet, before it come to ruin thus,\nIts quaking shall be as impetuous\nAs Aetna\u2019s was when Titan\u2019s sons lay under,\nAnd yield, when lost, a fearful sound like thunder.\nInarime did not more quickly move,\nWhen Typheus did the vast huge hills remove,\nAnd for despite into the sea them threw.\nThus shall it then be lost by ways not few,\nAnd changed suddenly, when those that have it\nTo other men that after come shall leave it.\nThen shall it be high time to cease from this\nSo long, so great, so tedious exercise;\nFor the great waters told you now by me,\nWill make each think where his retreat shall be;\nAnd yet, before that they be clean disperst,\nYou may behold in th\u2019 air, where nought was erst,\nThe burning heat of a great flame to rise,\nLick up the water, and the enterprise.\nIt resteth after those things to declare,\nThat those shall sit content who chosen are,\nWith all good things, and with celestial man (ne,)\nAnd richly recompensed every man:\nThe others at the last all stripp\u2019d shall be,\nThat after this great work all men may see,\nHow each shall have his due. This is their lot;\nO he is worthy praise that shrinketh not!\nNo sooner was this enigmatical monument read over, but Gargantua, fetching a very deep sigh, said unto those\nthat stood by, It is not now only, I perceive, that people called to the faith of the gospel, and convinced with the\ncertainty of evangelical truths, are persecuted. But happy is that man that shall not be scandalized, but shall always\ncontinue to the end in aiming at that mark which God by his dear Son hath set before us, without being distracted\nor diverted by his carnal affections and depraved nature.\nThe monk then said, What do you think in your conscience is meant and signified by this riddle? What? said\nGargantua,\u2014the progress and carrying on of the divine truth. By St. Goderan, said the monk, that is not my expo-\nsition. It is the style of the prophet Merlin. Make upon it as many grave allegories and glosses as you will, and dote\nupon it you and the rest of the world as long as you please; for my part, I can conceive no other meaning in it but\na description of a set at tennis in dark and obscure terms. The suborners of men are the makers of matches, which\nare commonly friends. After the two chases are made, he that was in the upper end of the tennis-court goeth out,\nand the other cometh in. They believe the first that saith the ball was over or under the line. The waters are the heats\nthat the players take till they sweat again. The cords of the rackets are made of the guts of sheep or goats. The globe\nterrestrial is the tennis-ball. After playing, when the game is done, they refresh themselves before a clear fire, and\nchange their shirts; and very willingly they make all good cheer, but most merrily those that have gained. And so,\nfarewell!\nChapter 2: II\nOf the nativity of the most dread and redoubted Pantagruel\nGargantua at the age of four hundred fourscore forty and four years begat his son Pantagruel, upon his wife\nnamed Badebec, daughter to the king of the Amaurots in Utopia, who died in childbirth; for he was so wonderful-\nly great and lumpish that he could not possibly come forth into the light of the world without thus suffocating his\nmother. But that we may fully understand the cause and reason of the name of Pantagruel which at his baptism was\ngiven him, you are to remark that in that year there was so great drought over all the country of Africa that there\npassed thirty and six months, three weeks, four days, thirteen hours and a little more without rain, but with a heat\n66 Gargantua and Pantagruel\nso vehement that the whole earth was parched and withered by it. Neither was it more scorched and dried up with\nheat in the days of Elijah than it was at that time; for there was not a tree to be seen that had either leaf or bloom\nupon it. The grass was without verdure or greenness, the rivers were drained, the fountains dried up, the poor\nfishes, abandoned and forsaken by their proper element, wandering and crying upon the ground most horribly. The\nbirds did fall down from the air for want of moisture and dew wherewith to refresh them. The wolves, foxes, harts,\nwild boars, fallow deer, hares, coneys, weasels, brocks, badgers, and other such beasts, were found dead in the fields\nwith their mouths open. In respect of men, there was the pity, you should have seen them lay out their tongues like\nhares that have been run six hours. Many did throw themselves into the wells. Others entered within a cow\u2019s belly to\nbe in the shade; those Homer calls Alibants. All the country was idle, and could do no virtue. It was a most lamen-\ntable case to have seen the labour of mortals in defending themselves from the vehemency of this horrific drought;\nfor they had work enough to do to save the holy water in the churches from being wasted; but there was such order\ntaken by the counsel of my lords the cardinals and of our holy Father, that none did dare to take above one lick. Yet\nwhen anyone came into the church, you should have seen above twenty poor thirsty fellows hang upon him that\nwas the distributor of the water, and that with a wide open throat, gaping for some little drop, like the rich glutton\nin Luke, that might fall by, lest anything should be lost. O how happy was he in that year who had a cool cellar un-\nder ground, well plenished with fresh wine!\nThe philosopher reports, in moving the question, Wherefore it is that the sea-water is salt, that at the time when\nPhoebus gave the government of his resplendent chariot to his son Phaeton, the said Phaeton, unskilful in the art,\nand not knowing how to keep the ecliptic line betwixt the two tropics of the latitude of the sun\u2019s course, strayed out\nof his way, and came so near the earth that he dried up all the countries that were under it, burning a great part of\nthe heavens which the philosophers call Via lactea, and the huffsnuffs St. James\u2019s way; although the most coped,\nlofty, and high-crested poets affirm that to be the place where Juno\u2019s milk fell when she gave suck to Hercules. The\nearth at that time was so excessively heated that it fell into an enormous sweat, yea, such a one as made it sweat out\nthe sea, which is therefore salt, because all sweat is salt; and this you cannot but confess to be true if you will taste of\nyour own, or of those that have the pox, when they are put into sweating, it is all one to me.\nJust such another case fell out this same year: for on a certain Friday, when the whole people were bent upon\ntheir devotions, and had made goodly processions, with store of litanies, and fair preachings, and beseechings of\nGod Almighty to look down with his eye of mercy upon their miserable and disconsolate condition, there was\neven then visibly seen issue out of the ground great drops of water, such as fall from a puff-bagged man in a top\nsweat, and the poor hoidens began to rejoice as if it had been a thing very profitable unto them; for some said that\nthere was not one drop of moisture in the air whence they might have any rain, and that the earth did supply the\ndefault of that. Other learned men said that it was a shower of the antipodes, as Seneca saith in his fourth book\nQuaestionum naturalium, speaking of the source and spring of Nilus. But they were deceived, for, the procession\nbeing ended, when everyone went about to gather of this dew, and to drink of it with full bowls, they found that it\nwas nothing but pickle and the very brine of salt, more brackish in taste than the saltest water of the sea. And because\nin that very day Pantagruel was born, his father gave him that name; for Panta in Greek is as much to say as all, and\nGruel in the Hagarene language doth signify thirsty, inferring hereby that at his birth the whole world was a-dry and\nthirsty, as likewise foreseeing that he would be some day supreme lord and sovereign of the thirsty Ethrappels, which\nwas shown to him at that very same hour by a more evident sign. For when his mother Badebec was in the bringing of\nhim forth, and that the midwives did wait to receive him, there came first out of her belly three score and eight trege-\nneers, that is, salt-sellers, every one of them leading in a halter a mule heavy laden with salt; after whom issued forth\nnine dromedaries, with great loads of gammons of bacon and dried neat\u2019s tongues on their backs. Then followed seven\ncamels loaded with links and chitterlings, hogs\u2019 puddings, and sausages. After them came out five great wains, full of\nleeks, garlic, onions, and chibots, drawn with five-and-thirty strong cart-horses, which was six for every one, besides\nthe thiller. At the sight hereof the said midwives were much amazed, yet some of them said, Lo, here is good provi-\nsion, and indeed we need it; for we drink but lazily, as if our tongues walked on crutches, and not lustily like Lansman\nDutches. Truly this is a good sign; there is nothing here but what is fit for us; these are the spurs of wine, that set it\na-going. As they were tattling thus together after their own manner of chat, behold! out comes Pantagruel all hairy like\na bear, whereupon one of them, inspired with a prophetical spirit, said, This will be a terrible fellow; he is born with all\nhis hair; he is undoubtedly to do wonderful things, and if he live he shall have age.\nChapter 2: VIII\nHow Pantagruel, being at Paris, received letters from his father Gargantua, and the copy of them\nPantagruel studied very hard, as you may well conceive, and profited accordingly; for he had an excellent un-\nderstanding and notable wit, together with a capacity in memory equal to the measure of twelve oil budgets or butts\nof olives. And, as he was there abiding one day, he received a letter from his father in manner as followeth.\n67 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nMost dear Son,\u2014Amongst the gifts, graces, and prerogatives, with which the sovereign plasmator God Al-\nmighty hath endowed and adorned human nature at the beginning, that seems to me most singular and excellent\nby which we may in a mortal state attain to a kind of immortality, and in the course of this transitory life perpetuate\nour name and seed, which is done by a progeny issued from us in the lawful bonds of matrimony. Whereby that in\nsome measure is restored unto us which was taken from us by the sin of our first parents, to whom it was said that,\nbecause they had not obeyed the commandment of God their Creator, they should die, and by death should be\nbrought to nought that so stately frame and plasmature wherein the man at first had been created.\nBut by this means of seminal propagation there (\u201cWhich continueth\u201d in the old copy.) continueth in the chil-\ndren what was lost in the parents, and in the grandchildren that which perished in their fathers, and so successively\nuntil the day of the last judgment, when Jesus Christ shall have rendered up to God the Father his kingdom in a\npeaceable condition, out of all danger and contamination of sin; for then shall cease all generations and corrup-\ntions, and the elements leave off their continual transmutations, seeing the so much desired peace shall be attained\nunto and enjoyed, and that all things shall be brought to their end and period. And, therefore, not without just and\nreasonable cause do I give thanks to God my Saviour and Preserver, for that he hath enabled me to see my bald old\nage reflourish in thy youth; for when, at his good pleasure, who rules and governs all things, my soul shall leave this\nmortal habitation, I shall not account myself wholly to die, but to pass from one place unto another, considering\nthat, in and by that, I continue in my visible image living in the world, visiting and conversing with people of hon-\nour, and other my good friends, as I was wont to do. Which conversation of mine, although it was not without sin,\nbecause we are all of us trespassers, and therefore ought continually to beseech his divine majesty to blot our trans-\ngressions out of his memory, yet was it, by the help and grace of God, without all manner of reproach before men.\nWherefore, if those qualities of the mind but shine in thee wherewith I am endowed, as in thee remaineth the\nperfect image of my body, thou wilt be esteemed by all men to be the perfect guardian and treasure of the immor-\ntality of our name. But, if otherwise, I shall truly take but small pleasure to see it, considering that the lesser part\nof me, which is the body, would abide in thee, and the best, to wit, that which is the soul, and by which our name\ncontinues blessed amongst men, would be degenerate and abastardized. This I do not speak out of any distrust that\nI have of thy virtue, which I have heretofore already tried, but to encourage thee yet more earnestly to proceed from\ngood to better. And that which I now write unto thee is not so much that thou shouldst live in this virtuous course,\nas that thou shouldst rejoice in so living and having lived, and cheer up thyself with the like resolution in time to\ncome; to the prosecution and accomplishment of which enterprise and generous undertaking thou mayst easily\nremember how that I have spared nothing, but have so helped thee, as if I had had no other treasure in this world\nbut to see thee once in my life completely well-bred and accomplished, as well in virtue, honesty, and valour, as in\nall liberal knowledge and civility, and so to leave thee after my death as a mirror representing the person of me thy\nfather, and if not so excellent, and such in deed as I do wish thee, yet such in my desire.\nBut although my deceased father of happy memory, Grangousier, had bent his best endeavours to make me\nprofit in all perfection and political knowledge, and that my labour and study was fully correspondent to, yea,\nwent beyond his desire, nevertheless, as thou mayest well understand, the time then was not so proper and fit for\nlearning as it is at present, neither had I plenty of such good masters as thou hast had. For that time was darksome,\nobscured with clouds of ignorance, and savouring a little of the infelicity and calamity of the Goths, who had, wher-\never they set footing, destroyed all good literature, which in my age hath by the divine goodness been restored unto\nits former light and dignity, and that with such amendment and increase of the knowledge, that now hardly should\nI be admitted unto the first form of the little grammar-schoolboys\u2014I say, I, who in my youthful days was, and that\njustly, reputed the most learned of that age. Which I do not speak in vain boasting, although I might lawfully do\nit in writing unto thee\u2014in verification whereof thou hast the authority of Marcus Tullius in his book of old age,\nand the sentence of Plutarch in the book entitled How a man may praise himself without envy\u2014but to give thee an\nemulous encouragement to strive yet further.\nNow is it that the minds of men are qualified with all manner of discipline, and the old sciences revived which\nfor many ages were extinct. Now it is that the learned languages are to their pristine purity restored, viz., Greek,\nwithout which a man may be ashamed to account himself a scholar, Hebrew, Arabic, Chaldaean, and Latin. Printing\nlikewise is now in use, so elegant and so correct that better cannot be imagined, although it was found out but in\nmy time by divine inspiration, as by a diabolical suggestion on the other side was the invention of ordnance. All the\nworld is full of knowing men, of most learned schoolmasters, and vast libraries; and it appears to me as a truth, that\nneither in Plato\u2019s time, nor Cicero\u2019s, nor Papinian\u2019s, there was ever such conveniency for studying as we see at this\nday there is. Nor must any adventure henceforward to come in public, or present himself in company, that hath not\nbeen pretty well polished in the shop of Minerva. I see robbers, hangmen, freebooters, tapsters, ostlers, and such\nlike, of the very rubbish of the people, more learned now than the doctors and preachers were in my time.\nWhat shall I say? The very women and children have aspired to this praise and celestial manner of good learn-\n68 Gargantua and Pantagruel\ning. Yet so it is that, in the age I am now of, I have been constrained to learn the Greek tongue\u2014which I contemned\nnot like Cato, but had not the leisure in my younger years to attend the study of it\u2014and take much delight in the\nreading of Plutarch\u2019s Morals, the pleasant Dialogues of Plato, the Monuments of Pausanias, and the Antiquities of\nAthenaeus, in waiting on the hour wherein God my Creator shall call me and command me to depart from this\nearth and transitory pilgrimage. Wherefore, my son, I admonish thee to employ thy youth to profit as well as thou\ncanst, both in thy studies and in virtue. Thou art at Paris, where the laudable examples of many brave men may stir\nup thy mind to gallant actions, and hast likewise for thy tutor and pedagogue the learned Epistemon, who by his\nlively and vocal documents may instruct thee in the arts and sciences.\nI intend, and will have it so, that thou learn the languages perfectly; first of all the Greek, as Quintilian will have\nit; secondly, the Latin; and then the Hebrew, for the Holy Scripture sake; and then the Chaldee and Arabic likewise,\nand that thou frame thy style in Greek in imitation of Plato, and for the Latin after Cicero. Let there be no history\nwhich thou shalt not have ready in thy memory; unto the prosecuting of which design, books of cosmography will\nbe very conducible and help thee much. Of the liberal arts of geometry, arithmetic, and music, I gave thee some\ntaste when thou wert yet little, and not above five or six years old. Proceed further in them, and learn the remainder\nif thou canst. As for astronomy, study all the rules thereof. Let pass, nevertheless, the divining and judicial astrology,\nand the art of Lullius, as being nothing else but plain abuses and vanities. As for the civil law, of that I would have\nthee to know the texts by heart, and then to confer them with philosophy.\nNow, in matter of the knowledge of the works of nature, I would have thee to study that exactly, and that so\nthere be no sea, river, nor fountain, of which thou dost not know the fishes; all the fowls of the air; all the sever-\nal kinds of shrubs and trees, whether in forests or orchards; all the sorts of herbs and flowers that grow upon the\nground; all the various metals that are hid within the bowels of the earth; together with all the diversity of precious\nstones that are to be seen in the orient and south parts of the world. Let nothing of all these be hidden from thee.\nThen fail not most carefully to peruse the books of the Greek, Arabian, and Latin physicians, not despising the\nTalmudists and Cabalists; and by frequent anatomies get thee the perfect knowledge of the other world, called the\nmicrocosm, which is man. And at some hours of the day apply thy mind to the study of the Holy Scriptures; first in\nGreek, the New Testament, with the Epistles of the Apostles; and then the Old Testament in Hebrew. In brief, let me\nsee thee an abyss and bottomless pit of knowledge; for from henceforward, as thou growest great and becomest a\nman, thou must part from this tranquillity and rest of study, thou must learn chivalry, warfare, and the exercises of\nthe field, the better thereby to defend my house and our friends, and to succour and protect them at all their needs\nagainst the invasion and assaults of evildoers.\nFurthermore, I will that very shortly thou try how much thou hast profited, which thou canst not better do than\nby maintaining publicly theses and conclusions in all arts against all persons whatsoever, and by haunting the com-\npany of learned men, both at Paris and otherwhere. But because, as the wise man Solomon saith, Wisdom entereth\nnot into a malicious mind, and that knowledge without conscience is but the ruin of the soul, it behoveth thee to\nserve, to love, to fear God, and on him to cast all thy thoughts and all thy hope, and by faith formed in charity to\ncleave unto him, so that thou mayst never be separated from him by thy sins. Suspect the abuses of the world. Set\nnot thy heart upon vanity, for this life is transitory, but the Word of the Lord endureth for ever. Be serviceable to\nall thy neighbours, and love them as thyself. Reverence thy preceptors: shun the conversation of those whom thou\ndesirest not to resemble, and receive not in vain the graces which God hath bestowed upon thee. And, when thou\nshalt see that thou hast attained to all the knowledge that is to be acquired in that part, return unto me, that I may\nsee thee and give thee my blessing before I die. My son, the peace and grace of our Lord be with thee. Amen.\nThy father Gargantua.\nFrom Utopia the 17th day of the month of March.\nThese letters being received and read, Pantagruel plucked up his heart, took a fresh courage to him, and was\ninflamed with a desire to profit in his studies more than ever, so that if you had seen him, how he took pains, and\nhow he advanced in learning, you would have said that the vivacity of his spirit amidst the books was like a great\nfire amongst dry wood, so active it was, vigorous and indefatigable.\nChapter 2: XXXII\nHow Pantagruel with his tongue covered a whole army, and what the author saw in his mouth\nThus, as Pantagruel with all his army had entered into the country of the Dipsodes, everyone was glad of it,\nand incontinently rendered themselves unto him, bringing him out of their own good wills the keys of all the cities\nwhere he went, the Almirods only excepted, who, being resolved to hold out against him, made answer to his her-\nalds that they would not yield but upon very honourable and good conditions.\n69 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nWhat! said Pantagruel, do they ask any better terms than the hand at the pot and the glass in their fist? Come,\nlet us go sack them, and put them all to the sword. Then did they put themselves in good order, as being fully de-\ntermined to give an assault, but by the way, passing through a large field, they were overtaken with a great shower\nof rain, whereat they began to shiver and tremble, to crowd, press, and thrust close to one another. When Panta-\ngruel saw that, he made their captains tell them that it was nothing, and that he saw well above the clouds that it\nwould be nothing but a little dew; but, howsoever, that they should put themselves in order, and he would cover\nthem. Then did they put themselves in a close order, and stood as near to (each) other as they could, and Pantagruel\ndrew out his tongue only half-way and covered them all, as a hen doth her chickens. In the meantime, I, who relate\nto you these so veritable stories, hid myself under a burdock-leaf, which was not much less in largeness than the\narch of the bridge of Montrible, but when I saw them thus covered, I went towards them to shelter myself likewise;\nwhich I could not do, for that they were so, as the saying is, At the yard\u2019s end there is no cloth left. Then, as well\nas I could, I got upon it, and went along full two leagues upon his tongue, and so long marched that at last I came\ninto his mouth. But, O gods and goddesses! what did I see there? Jupiter confound me with his trisulc lightning\nif I lie! I walked there as they do in Sophia (at) Constantinople, and saw there great rocks, like the mountains in\nDenmark\u2014I believe that those were his teeth. I saw also fair meadows, large forests, great and strong cities not a jot\nless than Lyons or Poictiers. The first man I met with there was a good honest fellow planting coleworts, whereat\nbeing very much amazed, I asked him, My friend, what dost thou make here? I plant coleworts, said he. But how,\nand wherewith? said I. Ha, sir, said he, everyone cannot have his ballocks as heavy as a mortar, neither can we be all\nrich. Thus do I get my poor living, and carry them to the market to sell in the city which is here behind. Jesus! said\nI, is there here a new world? Sure, said he, it is never a jot new, but it is commonly reported that, without this, there\nis an earth, whereof the inhabitants enjoy the light of a sun and a moon, and that it is full of and replenished with\nvery good commodities; but yet this is more ancient than that. Yea but, said I, my friend, what is the name of that\ncity whither thou carriest thy coleworts to sell? It is called Aspharage, said he, and all the indwellers are Christians,\nvery honest men, and will make you good cheer. To be brief, I resolved to go thither. Now, in my way, I met with a\nfellow that was lying in wait to catch pigeons, of whom I asked, My friend, from whence come these pigeons? Sir,\nsaid he, they come from the other world. Then I thought that, when Pantagruel yawned, the pigeons went into his\nmouth in whole flocks, thinking that it had been a pigeon-house.\nThen I went into the city, which I found fair, very strong, and seated in a good air; but at my entry the guard\ndemanded of me my pass or ticket. Whereat I was much astonished, and asked them, My masters, is there any danger\nof the plague here? O Lord! said they, they die hard by here so fast that the cart runs about the streets. Good God! said\nI, and where? Whereunto they answered that it was in Larynx and Pharynx, which are two great cities such as Rouen\nand Nantes, rich and of great trading. And the cause of the plague was by a stinking and infectious exhalation which\nlately vapoured out of the abysms, whereof there have died above two and twenty hundred and threescore thousand\nand sixteen persons within this sevennight. Then I considered, calculated, and found that it was a rank and unsavoury\nbreathing which came out of Pantagruel\u2019s stomach when he did eat so much garlic, as we have aforesaid.\nParting from thence, I passed amongst the rocks, which were his teeth, and never left walking till I got up on\none of them; and there I found the pleasantest places in the world, great large tennis-courts, fair galleries, sweet\nmeadows, store of vines, and an infinite number of banqueting summer outhouses in the fields, after the Italian\nfashion, full of pleasure and delight, where I stayed full four months, and never made better cheer in my life as\nthen. After that I went down by the hinder teeth to come to the chaps. But in the way I was robbed by thieves in a\ngreat forest that is in the territory towards the ears. Then, after a little further travelling, I fell upon a pretty petty\nvillage\u2014truly I have forgot the name of it\u2014where I was yet merrier than ever, and got some certain money to live\nby. Can you tell how? By sleeping. For there they hire men by the day to sleep, and they get by it sixpence a day, but\nthey that can snort hard get at least ninepence. How I had been robbed in the valley I informed the senators, who\ntold me that, in very truth, the people of that side were bad livers and naturally thievish, whereby I perceived well\nthat, as we have with us the countries Cisalpine and Transalpine, that is, behither and beyond the mountains, so\nhave they there the countries Cidentine and Tradentine, that is, behither and beyond the teeth. But it is far better\nliving on this side, and the air is purer. Then I began to think that it is very true which is commonly said, that the\none half of the world knoweth not how the other half liveth; seeing none before myself had ever written of that\ncountry, wherein are above five-and-twenty kingdoms inhabited, besides deserts, and a great arm of the sea. Con-\ncerning which purpose I have composed a great book, entitled, The History of the Throttias, because they dwell in\nthe throat of my master Pantagruel.\nAt last I was willing to return, and, passing by his beard, I cast myself upon his shoulders, and from thence slid\ndown to the ground, and fell before him. As soon as I was perceived by him, he asked me, Whence comest thou, Alcof-\nribas? I answered him, Out of your mouth, my lord. And how long hast thou been there? said he. Since the time, said I,\nthat you went against the Almirods. That is about six months ago, said he. And wherewith didst thou live? What didst\nthou drink?

The impact of those plays, however, is beyond question. Shakespeare is credited with introducing\nabout 1700 words to the English language (by invention, by turning nouns into verbs, by pulling words from other\nlanguages, etc.). When we talk about a gust of wind, or someone swaggering into a room, or bumping into someone, we\nare using Shakespeare\u2019s words. Many phrases introduced by Shakespeare are also in common usage: such as if some-\none catches a cold after too much of a good thing and is now a sorry sight who has seen better days. It is Shakespeare\u2019s use\nof language that has kept him so popular; the basic plot of Hamlet was based on historical events recounted by Saxo\nGrammaticus and written about by previous authors, but like Homer\u2019s version of the story of the Trojan War, Shake-\nspeare\u2019s presentation of the material surpasses all others. Hamlet\u2019s grief about his father\u2019s death\u2014and his mother\u2019s\nsubsequent marriage to his uncle\u2014could have led to a straightforward Elizabethan revenge tragedy. In Shakespeare\u2019s\nhands, the play instead explores the philosophical, psychological, and physical ramifications of revenge. Shakespeare\u2019s\nplays are well known around the world, and they have influenced countless authors. Hamlet is a particularly good\nexample of this phenomenon; Goethe\u2019s Faust (a masterpiece in its own right) includes quotations from Hamlet and\nrewrites the Hamlet\/Ophelia relationship in the context of Romanticism, while Fyodor Dostoevsky rewrites the rela-\ntionship in the context of Realism in his Notes from Underground. Shakespeare\u2019s plays have been adapted successfully\nin many countries, which is an argument for their timeless appeal. For example, Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa\u2019s\nThrone of Blood (1957) takes Macbeth and sets it in feudal Japan, with the title character as a samurai. Of all of the\nplays, Hamlet is both the most well-known and the most frequently adapted, both on the stage and in film.\nWritten by Laura J.

In October 1492, Co-\nlumbus and his crew arrived in the Bahamas, believing that they had found Asia. Columbus made four transatlantic\nvoyages and wrote letters, reports, and journal entries (not private entries, but entries to be read by other people)\nabout his voyages. Some of the journal entries were entirely or partially lost. The journal for the first voyage was lost\nbut partly reconstructed. Although Columbus was once celebrated as a hero who \u201cdiscovered\u201d America, this view\nhas been challenged by other records of earlier travelers and the destructive consequences that European explora-\ntion and colonization of the Americas have had on indigenous peoples. Columbus\u2019s journal entries and letters shed\nlight on transatlantic cross-cultural encounters in the fifteenth and sixteenth century.\nWritten by Kyounghye Kwon\n186 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\nSelections from the journals of Christopher Columbus - the First Voyage\nLicense: Public Domain\nChristopher Columbus, translated by Clements R.

As part of my duty I thought it\nwell to write an account of all the voyage very punctually, noting from day to day all that I should do and see, and\nthat should happen, as will be seen further on. Also, Lords Princes, I resolved to describe each night what passed\nin the day, and to note each day how I navigated at night. I propose to construct a new chart for navigating, on\nwhich I shall delineate all the sea and lands of the Ocean in their proper positions under their bearings; and further,\nI propose to prepare a book, and to put down all as it were in a picture, by latitude from the equator, and western\nlongitude. Above all, I shall have accomplished much, for I shall forget sleep, and shall work at the business of navi-\ngation, that so the service may be performed; all which will entail great labour.\n187 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nFriday, 3d of August\nWe departed on Friday, the 3d of August, in the year 1492, from the bar of Saltes, at 8 o\u2019clock, and proceed-\ned with a strong sea breeze until sunset, towards the south, for 60 miles, equal to 15 leagues; afterwards S.W. and\nW.S.W., which was the course for the Canaries.\nSaturday, 4th of August\nThey steered S.W. \\ S.\nSunday, 5th of August\nThey continued their course day and night more than 40 leagues.\nMonday, 6th of August\nThe rudder of the caravel Pinta became unshipped, and Martin Alonso Pinzon, who was in command, believed\nor suspected that it was by contrivance of Gomes Rascon and Cristobal Quintero, to whom the caravel belonged,\nfor they dreaded to go on that voyage. The Admiral says that, before they sailed, these men had been displaying a\ncertain backwardness, so to speak. The Admiral was much disturbed at not being able to help the said caravel with-\nout danger, and he says that he was eased of some anxiety when he reflected that Martin Alonso Pinzon was a man\nof energy and ingenuity. They made, during the day and night, 29 leagues.\nTuesday, 7th of August\nThe rudder of the Pinta was shipped and secured, and they proceeded on a course for the island of Lanzarote,\none of the Canaries. They made, during the day and night, 25 leagues.\nWednesday, 8th of August\nOpinions respecting their position varied among the pilots of the three caravels; but that of the Admiral proved\nto be nearer the truth. He wished to go to Gran Canaria, to leave the caravel Pinta, because she was disabled by the\nfaulty hanging of her rudder, and was making water. He intended to obtain another there if one could be found.\nThey could not reach the place that day.\nThursday, 9th of August\nThe Admiral was not able to reach Gomera until the night of Sunday, while Martin Alonso remained on that\ncoast of Gran Canaria by order of the Admiral, because his vessel could not be navigated. Afterwards the Admiral\ntook her to Canaria, and they repaired the Pinta very thoroughly through the pains and labour of the Admiral, of\nMartin Alonso, and of the rest. Finally they came to Gomera. They saw a great fire issue from the mountain of the\nisland of Tenerife, which is of great height. They rigged the Pinta with square sails, for she was lateen rigged; and\nthe Admiral reached Gomera on Sunday, the 2nd of September, with the Pinta repaired.\nThe Admiral says that many honourable Spanish gentlemen who were at Gomera with Dona Ines Peraza, moth-\ner of Guillen Peraza (who was afterwards the first Count of Gomera), and who were natives of the island of Hierro,\ndeclared that every year they saw land to the west of the Canaries; and others, natives of Gomera, affirmed the same\non oath. The Admiral here says that he remembers, when in Portugal in the year 1484, a man came to the King\nfrom the island of Madeira, to beg for a caravel to go to this land that was seen, who swore that it could be seen\nevery year, and always in the same way. He also says that he recollects the same thing being affirmed in the islands\nof the Azores; and all these lands were described as in the same direction, and as being like each other, and of the\nsame size. Having taken in water, wood, and meat, and all else that the men had who were left at Gomera by the\nAdmiral when he went to the island of Canaria to repair the caravel Pinta, he finally made sail from the said island\nof Gomera, with his three caravels, on Thursday, the 6th day of September.\nThursday, 6th of September\nHe departed on that day from the port of Gomera in the morning, and shaped a course to go on his voyage;\nhaving received tidings from a caravel that came from the island of Hierro that three Portuguese caravels were off\n188 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\nthat island with the object of taking him. There was a calm all that day and night, and in the morning he found\nhimself between Gomera and Tenerife.\nFriday, 7th of September\nThe calm continued all Friday and Saturday, until the third hour of the night.\nSaturday, 8th of September\nAt the third hour of Saturday night it began to blow from the N.E., and the Admiral shaped a course to the\nwest. He took in much sea over the bows, which retarded progress, and 9 leagues were made in that day and night.\nSunday, 9th of September\nThis day the Admiral made 19 leagues, and he arranged to reckon less than the number run, because if the voy-\nage was of long duration, the people would not be so terrified and disheartened. In the night he made 120 miles, at\nthe rate of 12 miles an hour, which are 30 leagues. The sailors steered badly, letting the ship fall off to N.E., and even\nmore, respecting which the Admiral complained many times.\nMonday, 10th of September\nIn this day and night he made 60 leagues, at the rate of 10 miles an hour, which are 2 1\/2 leagues; but he only\ncounted 48 leagues, that the people might not be alarmed if the voyage should be long.\nTuesday, 11th of September\nThat day they sailed on their course, which was west, and made 20 leagues and more. They saw a large piece of\nthe mast of a ship of 120 tons, but were unable to get it. In the night they made nearly 20 leagues, but only counted\n16, for the reason already given.\nWednesday, 12th of September\nThat day, steering their course, they made 33 leagues during the day and night, counting less.\nThursday, 13th of September\nThat day and night, steering their course, which was west, they made 33 leagues, counting 3 or 4 less. The cur-\nrents were against them. On this day, at the commencement of the night, the needles turned a half point to north-\nwest, and in the morning they turned somewhat more north-west.\nFriday, 14th of September\nThat day they navigated, on their westerly course, day and night, 20 leagues, counting a little less. Here those\nof the caravel Ni\u00f1a reported that they had seen a tern and a boatswain bird, and these birds never go more than 25\nleagues from the land.\nSaturday, 15th of September\nThat day and night they made 27 leagues and rather more on their west course; and in the early part of the\nnight there fell from heaven into the sea a marvellous flame of fire, at a distance of about 4 or 5 leagues from them.\nSunday, 16th of September\nThat day and night they steered their course west, making 39 leagues, but the Admiral only counted 36. There\nwere some clouds and small rain. The Admiral says that on that day, and ever afterwards, they met with very tem-\nperate breezes, so that there was great pleasure in enjoying the mornings, nothing being wanted but the song of\nnightingales. He says that the weather was like April in Andalusia. Here they began to see many tufts of grass which\nwere very green, and appeared to have been quite recently torn from the land. From this they judged that they were\nnear some island, but not the main land, according to the Admiral, \u201cbecause,\u201d as he says, \u201cI make the main land to\nbe more distant.\u201d\n189 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nMonday, 17th of September\nThey proceeded on their west course, and made over 50 leagues in the day and night, but the Admiral only\ncounted 47. They were aided by the current. They saw much very fine grass and herbs from rocks, which came from\nthe west. They, therefore, considered that they were near land. The pilots observed the north point, and found that\nthe needles turned a full point to the west of north. So the mariners were alarmed and dejected, and did not give\ntheir reason. But the Admiral knew, and ordered that the north should be again observed at dawn. They then found\nthat the needles were true. The cause was that the star makes the movement, and not the needles.\nAt dawn, on that Monday, they saw much more weed appearing, like herbs from rivers, in which they found a\nlive crab, which the Admiral kept. He says that these crabs are certain signs of land. The sea-water was found to be\nless salt than it had been since leaving the Canaries. The breezes were always soft. Everyone was pleased, and the\nbest sailers went ahead to sight the first land. They saw many tunny-fish, and the crew of the Ni\u00f1a killed one. The\nAdmiral here says that these signs of land came from the west, \u201cin which direction I trust in that high God in whose\nhands are all victories that very soon we shall sight land\u201d. In that morning he says that a white bird was seen which\nhas not the habit of sleeping on the sea, called rabo de junco (boatswain-bird).\nTuesday, 18th of September\nThis day and night they made over 55 leagues, the Admiral only counting 48. In all these days the sea was very\nsmooth, like the river at Seville. This day Martin Alonso, with the Pinta, which was a fast sailer, did not wait, for he\nsaid to the Admiral, from his caravel, that he had seen a great multitude of birds flying westward, that he hoped to\nsee land that night, and that he therefore pressed onward, A great cloud appeared in the north, which is a sign of\nthe proximity of land.\nWednesday, 17th of September\nThe Admiral continued on his course, and during the day and night he made but 25 leagues because it was\ncalm. He counted 22. This day, at 10 o\u2019clock, a booby came to the ship, and in the afternoon another arrived, these\nbirds not generally going more than 20 leagues from the land. There was also some drizzling rain without wind,\nwhich is a sure sign of land. The Admiral did not wish to cause delay by beating to windward to ascertain whether\nland was near, but he considered it certain that there were islands both to the north and south of his position, (as\nindeed there were, and he was passing through the middle of them). For his desire was to press onwards to the\nIndies, the weather being fine. For on his return, God willing, he could see all. These are his own words. Here the\npilots found their positions. He of the Ni\u00f1a made the Canaries 440 leagues distant, the Pinta 420. The pilot of the\nAdmiral\u2019s ship made the distance exactly 400 leagues.\nThursday, 20th of September\nThis day the course was W. b. N., and as her head was all round the compass owing to the calm that prevailed,\nthe ships made only 7 or 8 leagues. Two boobies came to the ship, and afterwards another, a sign of the proximity of\nland. They saw much weed, although none was seen on the previous day. They caught a bird with the hand, which\nwas like a tern. But it was a river-bird, not a sea-bird, the feet being like those of a gull. At dawn two or three land-\nbirds came singing to the ship, and they disappeared before sunset. Afterwards a booby came from W.N.VV., and\nflew to the S.VV., which was a sign that it left land in the W.N.VV.; for these birds sleep on shore, and go to sea in\nthe mornings in search of food, not extending their flight more than 20 leagues from the land.\nFriday, 21st of September\nMost of the day it was calm, and later there was a little wind. During the day and night they did not make good\nmore than 13 leagues. At dawn they saw so much weed that the sea appeared to be covered with it, and it came\nfrom the west. A booby was seen. The sea was very smooth, like a river, and the air the best in the world. They saw a\nwhale, which is a sign that they were near land, because they always keep near the shore.\nSaturday, 22nd of September\nThey shaped a course W.N.W. more or less, her head turning from one to the other point, and made 30 leagues.\nScarcely any weed was seen. They saw some sandpipers and another bird. Here the Admiral says: \u201cThis contrary\nwind was very necessary for me, because my people were much excited at the thought that in these seas no wind\never blew in the direction of Spain.\u201d Part of the day there was no weed, and later it was very thick.\n190 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\nSunday, 23rd of September\nThey shaped a course N.W., and at times more northerly; occasionally they were on their course, which was\nwest, and they made about 22 leagues. They saw a dove and a booby, another river-bird, and some white birds.\nThere was a great deal of weed, and they found crabs in it. The sea being smooth and calm, the crew began to mur-\nmur, saying that here there was no great sea, and that the wind would never blow so that they could return to Spain.\nAfterwards the sea rose very much, without wind, which astonished them. The Admiral here says: \u201cThus the high\nsea was very necessary to me, such as had not appeared but in the time of the Jews when they went out of Egypt and\nmurmured against Moses, who delivered them out of captivity.\u201d\nMonday, 24th of September\nThe Admiral went on his west course all day and night, making 14 leagues. He counted 12. A booby came to the\nship, and many sandpipers.\nImage 11.13: the Voyages of Christopher Columbus | A map showing the four sea voyages taken to the New World by Columbus.\nAuthor: User \u201cJasonAQuest\u201d\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0\nTuesday, 25th of September\nThis day began with a calm, and afterwards there was wind. They were on their west course until night. The\nAdmiral conversed with Martin Alonso Pinzon, captain of the other caravel Pinta, respecting a chart which he had\nsent to the caravel three days before, on which, as it would appear, the Admiral had certain islands depicted in that\nsea. Martin Alonso said that the ships were in the position on which the islands were placed, and the Admiral re-\nplied that so it appeared to him: but it might be that they had not fallen in with them, owing to the currents which\nhad always set the ships to the N.E., and that they had not made so much as the pilots reported. The Admiral then\n191 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nasked for the chart to be returned, and it was sent back on a line. The Admiral then began to plot the position on it,\nwith the pilot and mariners. At sunset Martin Alonso went up on the poop of his ship, and with much joy called to the\nAdmiral, claiming the reward as he had sighted land. When the Admiral heard this positively declared, he says that he\ngave thanks to the Lord on his knees, while Martin Alonso said the Gloria in excelsis with his people. The Admiral\u2019s\ncrew did the same. Those of the Ni\u00f1a all went up on the mast and into the rigging, and declared that it was land. It so\nseemed to the Admiral, and that it was distant 25 leagues. They all continued to declare it was land until night. The Ad-\nmiral ordered the course to be altered from VV. to S.W., in which direction the land had appeared. That day they made\n4 leagues on a west course, and 17 S.W. during the night, in all 21; but the people were told that 13 was the distance\nmade good: for it was always feigned to them that the distances were less, so that the voyage might not appear so long.\nThus two reckonings were kept on this voyage, the shorter being feigned, and the longer being the true one. The sea\nwas very smooth, so that many sailors bathed alongside. They saw many dorados and other fish.\nWednesday, 26th of September\nThe Admiral continued on the west course until after noon. Then he altered course to S.W., until he made out\nthat what had been said to be land was only clouds. Day and night they made 31 leagues, counting 24 for the peo-\nple. The sea was like a river, the air pleasant and very mild.\nThursday, 27th of September\nThe course west, and distance made good during day and night 24 leagues, 20 being counted for the people.\nMany dorados came. One was killed. A boatswain-bird came.\nFriday, 28th of September\nThe course was west, and the distance, owing to calms, only 14 leagues in day and night, 13 leagues being\ncounted. They met with little weed; but caught two dorados, and more in the other ships.\nSaturday, 29th of September\nThe course was west, and they made 24 leagues, counting 21 for the people. Owing to calms, the distance made\ngood during day and night was not much. They saw a bird called rabiforcado (man-o\u2019-war bird), which makes the\nboobies vomit what they have swallowed, and eats it, maintaining itself on nothing else. It is a sea-bird, but does not\nsleep on the sea, and does not go more than 20 leagues from the land. There are many of them at the Cape Verde\nIslands. Afterwards they saw two boobies. The air was very mild and agreeable, and the Admiral says that nothing\nwas wanting but to hear the nightingale. The sea smooth as a river. Later, three boobies and a man-o\u2019-war bird were\nseen three times. There was much weed.\nSunday, 30th of September\nThe western course was steered, and during the day and night, owing to calms, only 14 leagues were made, 11\nbeing counted. Four boatswain-birds came to the ship, which is a great sign of land, for so many birds of this kind\ntogether is a sign that they are not straying or lost. They also twice saw four boobies. There was much weed. Note\nthat the stars which are called las guardias (the Pointers), when night comes on, are near the western point, and\nwhen dawn breaks they are near the N.E. point; so that, during the whole night, they do not appear to move more\nthan three lines or 9 hours, and this on each night. The Admiral says this, and also that at nightfall the needles vary\na point westerly, while at dawn they agree exactly with the star. From this it would appear that the north star has a\nmovement like the other stars, while the needles always point correctly.\nMonday, 1st of October\nCourse west, and 25 leagues made good, counted for the crew as 20 leagues. There was a heavy shower of rain. At\ndawn the Admiral\u2019s pilot made the distance from Hierro 578 leagues to the west. The reduced reckoning which the\nAdmiral showed to the crew made it 584 leagues; but the truth which the Admiral observed and kept secret was 707.\nTuesday, 2nd of October\nCourse west, and during the day and night 39 leagues were made good, counted for the crew as 30. The sea\nalways smooth. Many thanks be given to God, says the Admiral, that the weed is coming from east to west, contrary\nto its usual course. Many fish were seen, and one was killed. A white bird was also seen that appeared to be a gull.\n192 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\nWednesday, 3rd of October\nThey navigated on the usual course, and made good 47 leagues, counted as 40. Sandpipers appeared, and much\nweed, some of it very old and some quite fresh and having fruit. They saw no birds. The Admiral, therefore, thought\nthat they had left the islands behind them which were depicted on the charts. The Admiral here says that he did not\nwish to keep the ships beating about during the last week, and in the last few days when there were so many signs of\nland, although he had information of certain islands in this region. For he wished to avoid delay, his object being to\nreach the Indies. He says that to delay would not be wise.\nThursday, 4th of October\nCourse west, and 63 leagues made good during the day and night, counted as 46. More than forty sandpipers\ncame to the ship in a flock, and two boobies, and a ship\u2019s boy hit one with a stone. There also came a man-o\u2019-war\nbird and a white bird like a gull.\nFriday, 5th of October\nThe Admiral steered his course, going 11 miles an hour, and during the day and night they made good 57\nleagues, as the wind increased somewhat during the night: 45 were counted. The sea was smooth and quiet. \u201cTo\nGod\u201d, he says, \u201cbe many thanks given, the air being pleasant and temperate, with no weed, many sandpipers, and\nflying-fish coming on the deck in numbers.\u201d\nSaturday, 6th of October\nThe Admiral continued his west course, and during day and night they made good 40 leagues, 33 being count-\ned. This night Martin Alonso said that it would be well to steer south of west, and it appeared to the Admiral that\nMartin Alonso did not say this with respect to the island of Cipango. He saw that if an error was made the land\nwould not be reached so quickly, and that consequently it would be better to go at once to the continent and after-\nwards to the islands.\nSunday, 7th of October\nThe west course was continued; for two hours they went at the rate of 12 miles an hour, and afterwards 8 miles\nan hour. They made good 23 leagues, counting 18 for the people. This day, at sunrise, the caravel Ni\u00f1a, which\nwent ahead, being the best sailer, and pushed forward as much as possible to sight the land first, so as to enjoy the\nreward which the Sovereigns had promised to whoever should see it first, hoisted a flag at the mast-head and fired\na gun, as a signal that she had sighted land, for such was the Admiral\u2019s order. He had also ordered that, at sunrise\nand sunset, all the ships should join him; because those two times are most proper for seeing the greatest distance,\nthe haze clearing away. No land was seen during the afternoon, as reported by the caravel Ni\u00f1a, and they passed a\ngreat number of birds flying from N. to S.W. This gave rise to the belief that the birds were either going to sleep on\nland, or were flying from the winter which might be supposed to be near in the land whence they were coming The\nAdmiral was aware that most of the islands held by the Portuguese were discovered by the flight of birds. For this\nreason he resolved to give up the west course, and to shape a course W.S.W. for the two following days. He began\nthe new course one hour before sunset. They made good, during the night, about 5 leagues, and 23 in the day, alto-\ngether 28 leagues.\nMonday, 8th of October\nThe course was W.S.W., and 11 1\/2 or 12 leagues were made good in the day and night; and at times it appears\nthat they went at the rate of 1 5 miles an hour during the night (if the handwriting is not deceptive). The sea was\nlike the river at Seville. \u201cThanks be to God,\u201d says the Admiral, \u201cthe air is very soft like the April at Seville; and it is a\npleasure to be here, so balmy are the breezes.\u201d The weed seemed to be very fresh. There were many land-birds, and\nthey took one that was flying to the S.W. Terns, ducks, and a booby were also seen.\nTuesday, 9th of October\nThe course was S.W., and they made 5 leagues. The wind then changed, and the Admiral steered W. by N.\n4 leagues. Altogether, in day and night, they made 11 leagues by day and 20 1\/2 leagues by night; counted as 17\nleagues altogether. Throughout the night birds were heard passing.\n193 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nWednesday, 10th of October\nThe course was W.S.W., and they went at the rate of 10 miles an hour, occasionally 12 miles, and sometimes 7.\nDuring the day and night they made 59 leagues, counted as no more than 44. Here the people could endure no lon-\nger. They complained of the length of the voyage. But the Admiral cheered them up in the best way he could, giving\nthem good hopes of the advantages they might gain from it. He added that, however much they might complain, he\nhad to go to the Indies, and that he would go on until he found them, with the help of our Lord.\nThursday, 11th of October\nThe course was W.S.W., and there was more sea than there had been during the whole of the voyage. They\nsaw sandpipers, and a green reed near the ship. Those of the caravel Pinta saw a cane and a pole, and they took up\nanother small pole which appeared to have been worked with iron; also another bit of cane, a land-plant, and a\nsmall board. The crew of the caravel Ni\u00f1a also saw signs of land, and a small branch covered with berries. Everyone\nbreathed afresh and rejoiced at these signs. The run until sunset was 26 leagues.\nAfter sunset the Admiral returned to his original west course, and they went along at the rate of 12 miles an\nhour. Up to two hours after midnight they had gone 90 miles, equal to 22 1\/2 leagues. As the caravel Pinta was a\nbetter sailer, and went ahead of the Admiral, she found the land, and made the signals ordered by the Admiral. The\nland was first seen by a sailor named Rodrigo de Triana. But the Admiral, at ten in the previous night, being on\nthe castle of the poop, saw a light, though it was so uncertain that he could not affirm it was land. He called Pero\nGutierrez, a gentleman of the Kings bedchamber, and said that there seemed to be a light, and that he should look\nat it. He did so, and saw it. The Admiral said the same to Rodrigo Sanchez of Segovia, whom the King and Queen\nhad sent with the fleet as inspector, but he could see nothing, because he was not in a place whence anything could\nbe seen. After the Admiral had spoken he saw the light once or twice, and it was like a wax candle rising and falling.\nIt seemed to few to be an indication of land; but the Admiral made certain that land was close. When they said the\nSalve, which all the sailors were accustomed to sing in their way, the Admiral asked and admonished the men to\nkeep a good look-out on the forecastle, and to watch well for land; and to him who should first cry out that he saw\nland, he would give a silk doublet, besides the other rewards promised by the Sovereigns, which were 10,000 mar-\navedis to him who should first see it. At two hours after midnight the land was sighted at a distance of two leagues.\nThey shortened sail, and lay by under the mainsail without the bonnets. The vessels were hove to, waiting for\ndaylight; and on Friday they arrived at a small island of the Lucayos, called, in the language of the Indians, Guana-\nhani. Presently they saw naked people. The Admiral went on shore in the armed boat, and Martin Alonso Pinzon,\nand Vicente Yanez, his brother, who was captain of the Ni\u00f1a. The Admiral took the royal standard, and the captains\nwent with two banners of the green cross, which the Admiral took in all the ships as a sign, with an F and a Y and a\ncrown over each letter, one on one side of the cross and the other on the other. Having landed, they saw trees very\ngreen, and much water, and fruits of diverse kinds. The Admiral called to the two captains, and to the others who\nleaped on shore, and to Rodrigo Escovedo, secretary of the whole fleet, and to Rodrigo Sanchez of Segovia, and said\nthat they should bear faithful testimony that he, in presence of all, had taken, as he now took, possession of the said\nisland for the King and for the Queen, his Lords making the declarations that are required, as is more largely set\nforth in the testimonies which were then made in writing.\nPresently many inhabitants of the island assembled. What follows is in the actual words of the Admiral in his\nbook of the first navigation and discovery of the Indies. \u201cI,\u201d he says, \u201cthat we might form great friendship, for I knew\nthat they were a people who could be more easily freed and converted to our holy faith by love than by force, gave\nto some of them red caps, and glass beads to put round their necks, and many other things of little value, which\ngave them great pleasure, and made them so much our friends that it was a marvel to see. They afterwards came to\nthe ship\u2019s boats where we were, swimming and bringing us parrots, cotton threads in skeins, darts, and many other\nthings; and we exchanged them for other things that we gave them, such as glass beads and small bells. In fine, they\ntook all, and gave what they had with good will. It appeared to me to be a race of people very poor in everything.\nThey go as naked as when their mothers bore them, and so do the women, although I did not see more than one\nyoung girl. All I saw were youths, none more than thirty years of age. They are very well made, with very handsome\nbodies, and very good countenances. Their hair is short and coarse, almost like the hairs of a horse\u2019s tail. They wear\nthe hairs brought down to the eyebrows, except a few locks behind, which they wear long and never cut. They paint\nthemselves black, and they arc the colour of the Canarians, neither black nor white. Some paint themselves white,\nothers red, and others of what colour they find. Some paint their faces, others the whole body, some only round\nthe eyes, others only on the nose. They neither carry nor know anything of arms, for I showed them swords, and\nthey took them by the blade and cut themselves through ignorance. They have no iron, their darts being wands\nwithout iron, some of them having a fish\u2019s tooth at the end, and others being pointed in various ways. They are all\nof fair stature and size, with good faces, and well made. I saw some with marks of wounds on their bodies, and I\n194 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\nmade signs to ask what it was, and they gave me to understand that people from other adjacent islands came with\nthe intention of seizing them, and that they defended themselves. I believed, and still believe, that they come here\nfrom the mainland to take them prisoners. They should be good servants and intelligent, for I observed that they\nquickly took in what was said to them, and I believe that they would easily be made Christians, as it appeared to me\nthat they had no religion. I, our Lord being pleased, will take hence, at the time of my departure, six natives for your\nHighnesses, that they may learn to speak. I saw no beast of any kind except parrots, on this island.\u201d The above is in\nthe words of the Admiral.\nSaturday, 13th of October\n\u201cAs soon as dawn broke many of these people came to the beach, all youths, as I have said, and all of good\nstature, a very handsome people. Their hair is not curly, but loose and coarse, like horse hair. In all the forehead is\nbroad, more so than in any other people I have hitherto seen. Their eyes are very beautiful and not small, and them-\nselves far from black, but the colour of the Canarians. Nor should anything; else be expected, as this island is in a\nline east and west from the island of Hierro in the Canaries. Their legs are very straight, all in one line, and no belly,\nbut very well formed. They came to the ship in small canoes, made out of the trunk of a tree like a long boat, and all\nof one piece, and wonderfully worked, considering the country. They are large, some of them holding 40 to 45 men,\nothers smaller, and some only large enough to hold one man. They are propelled with a paddle like a baker\u2019s shovel,\nand go at a marvellous rate. If the canoe capsizes they all promptly begin to swim, and to bale it out with calabash-\nes that they take with them. They brought skeins of cotton thread, parrots, darts, and other small things which it\nwould be tedious to recount, and they give all in exchange for anything that may be given to them. I was attentive,\nand took trouble to ascertain if there was gold. I saw that some of them had a small piece fastened in a hole they\nhave in the nose, and by signs I was able to make out that to the south, or going from the island to the south, there\nwas a king who had great cups full, and who possessed a great quantity. I tried to get them to go there, but after-\nwards I saw that they had no inclination. I resolved to wait until to-morrow in the afternoon and then to depart,\nshaping a course to the S.W., for, according to what many of them told me, there was land to the S., to the S.W., and\nN.W., and that the natives from the N.W. often came to attack them, and went on to the S.W. in search of gold and\nprecious stones.\n\u201cThis island is rather large and very flat, with bright green trees, much water, and a very large lake in the centre,\nwithout any mountain, and the whole land so green that it is a pleasure to look on it. The people are very docile, and\nfor the longing to possess our things, and not having anything to give in return, they take what they can get, and\npresently swim away. Still, they give away all they have got, for whatever may be given to them, down to broken bits\nof crockery and glass. I saw one give 16 skeins of cotton for three ceotis of Portugal, equal to one blanca of Spain,\nthe skeins being as much as an arroba of cotton thread. I shall keep it, and shall allow no one to take it, preserving\nit all for your Highnesses, for it may be obtained in abundance. It is grown in this island, though the short time did\nnot admit of my ascertaining this for a certainty. Here also is found the gold they wear fastened in their noses. But,\nin order not to lose time, I intend to go and see if I can find the island of Cipango. Now, as it is night, all the natives\nhave gone on shore with their canoes.\u201d\nSunday, 14th of October\n\u201cAt dawn I ordered the ship\u2019s boat and the boats of the caravels to be got ready, and I went along the coast of\nthe island to the N.N.E., to see the other side, which was on the other side to the east, and also to see the villages.\nPresently I saw two or three, and the people all came to the shore, calling out and giving thanks to God. Some of\nthem brought us water, others came with food, and when they saw that I did not want to land, they got into the sea,\nand came swimming to us. We understood that they asked us if we had come from heaven. One old man came into\nthe boat, and others cried out, in loud voices, to all the men and women, to come and see the men who had come\nfrom heaven, and to bring them to eat and drink. Many came, including women, each bringing something, giving\nthanks to God, throwing themselves on the ground and shouting to us to come on shore. But I was afraid to land,\nseeing an extensive reef of rocks which surrounded the island, with deep water between it and the shore forming\na port large enough for as many ships as there are in Christendom, but with a very narrow entrance. It is true that\nwithin this reef there are some sunken rocks, but the sea has no more motion than the water in a well. In order to\nsee all this I went this morning, that I might be able to give a full account to your Highnesses, and also where a\nfortress might be established. I saw a piece of land which appeared like an island, although it is not one, and on it\nthere were six houses. It might be converted into an island in two days, though I do not see that it would be neces-\nsary, for these people are very simple as regards the use of arms, as your Highnesses will see from the seven that I\ncaused to be taken, to bring home and learn our language and return; unless your Highnesses should order them all\nto be brought to Castille, or to be kept as captives on the same island; for with fifty men they can all be subjugated\n195 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nand made to do what is required of them. Close to the above peninsula there are gardens of the most beautiful trees\nI ever saw, and with leaves as green as those of Castille in the month of April and May, and much water. I examined\nall that port, and afterwards I returned to the ship and made sail. I saw so many islands that I hardly knew how to\ndetermine to which I should go first. Those natives I had with me said, by signs, that there were so many that they\ncould not be numbered, and they gave the names of more than a hundred. At last I looked out for the largest, and\nresolved to shape a course for it, and so I did. It will be distant five leagues from this of San Salvador, and the others\nsome more, some less. All are very flat, and all are inhabited. The natives make war on each other, although these\nare very simple-minded and handsomely-formed people.\u201d\nMonday, 15th of October\n\u201cI had laid by during the night, with the fear of reaching the land to anchor before daylight, not knowing\nwhether the coast was clear of rocks, and at dawn I made sail. As the island was more than 5 leagues distant and\nnearer 7, and the tide checked my way, it was noon when we arrived at the said island. I found that side facing to-\nwards the island of San Salvador trended north and south with a length of 5 leagues, and the other which I followed\nran east and west for more than 10 leagues. As from this island I saw another larger one to the west, I clued up the\nsails, after having run all that day until night, otherwise I could not have reached the western cape. I gave the name\nof Santa Maria de la Concepcion to the island, and almost as the sun set I anchored near the said cape to ascertain\nif it contained gold. For the people I had taken from the island of San Salvador told me that here they wore very\nlarge rings of gold on their arms and legs. I really believed that all they said was nonsense, invented that they might\nescape. My desire was not to pass any island without taking possession, so that, one having been taken, the same\nmay be said of all. I anchored, and remained until to-day, Tuesday, when I went to the shore with the boats armed,\nand landed. The people, who were numerous, went naked, and were like those of the other island of San Salvador.\nThey let us go over the island, and gave us what we required. As the wind changed to the S.E., I did not like to stay,\nand returned to the ship. A large canoe was alongside the Ni\u00f1a, and one of the men of the island of San Salvador,\nwho was on board, jumped into the sea and got into the canoe. In the middle of the night before, another swam\naway behind the canoe, which fled, for there never was boat that could have overtaken her, seeing that in speed they\nhave a great advantage. So they reached the land and left the canoe. Some of my people went on shore in chase of\nthem, but they all fled like fowls, and the canoe they had left was brought alongside the caravel Ni\u00f1a, whither, from\nanother direction, another small canoe came, with a man who wished to barter with skeins of cotton. Some sailors\njumped into the sea, because he would not come on board the caravel, and seized him. I was on the poop of my\nship, and saw everything. So I sent for the man, gave him a red cap, some small beads of green glass, which I put on\nhis arms, and small bells, which I put in his ears, and ordered his canoe, which was also on board, to be returned to\nhim. I sent him on shore, and presently made sail to go to the other large island which was in sight to the westward.\nI also ordered the other large canoe, which the caravel Ni\u00f1a was towing astern, to be cast adrift; and I soon saw that\nit reached the land at the same time as the man to whom I had given the above things. I had not wished to take the\nskein of cotton that he offered me. All the others came round him and seemed astonished, for it appeared clear to\nthem that we were good people. The other man who had fled might do us some harm, because we had carried him\noff, and for that reason I ordered this man to be set free and gave him the above things, that he might think well of\nus, otherwise, when your Highnesses again send an expedition, they might not be friendly. All the presents I gave\nwere not worth four maravedis. At lo we departed with the wind S.W., and made for the south, to reach that other\nisland, which is very large, and respecting which all the men that I bring from San Salvador make signs that there\nis much gold, and that they wear it as bracelets on the arms, on the legs, in the ears and nose, and round the neck.\nThe distance of this island from that of Santa Maria is 9 leagues on a course east to west. All this part of the island\ntrends N.W. and S.E., and it appeared that this coast must have a length of 28 leagues. It is very flat, without any\nmountain, like San Salvador and Santa Maria, all being beach without rocks, except that there are some sunken\nrocks near the land, whence it is necessary to keep a good lookout when it is desired to anchor, and not to come\nto very near the land; but the water is always very clear, and the bottom is visible. At a distance of two shots of a\nlombard, there is, off all these islands, such a depth that the bottom cannot be reached. These islands arc very green\nand fertile, the climate very mild. They may contain many things of which I have no knowledge, for I do not wish to\nstop, in discovering and visiting many islands, to find gold. These people make signs that it is worn on the arms and\nlegs; and it must be gold, for they point to some pieces that I have. I cannot err, with the help of our Lord, in finding\nout where this gold has its origin. Being in the middle of the channel between these two islands, that is to say, that\nof Santa Maria and this large one, to which I give the name of Fernandina, I came upon a man alone in a canoe\ngoing from Santa Maria to Fernandina. He had a little of their bread, about the size of a fist, a calabash of water, a\npiece of brown earth powdered and then kneaded, and some dried leaves, which must be a thing highly valued by\nthem, for they bartered with it at San Salvador. He also had with him a native basket with a string of glass beads,\n196 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\nand two blancas, by which I knew that he had come from the island of San Salvador, and had been to Santa Maria,\nand thence to Fernandina. He came alongside the ship, and I made him come on board as he desired, also getting\nthe canoe inboard, and taking care of all his property. I ordered him to be given to eat bread and treacle, and also to\ndrink: and so I shall take him on to Fernandina, where I shall return everything to him, in order that he may give\na good account of us, that, our Lord pleasing, when your Highnesses shall send here, those who come may receive\nhonor, and that the natives may give them all they require.\u201d\nTuesday, 16th of October\n\u201cI sailed from the island of Santa Maria de la Concepcion at about noon, to go to Fernandina island, which\nappeared very large to the westward, and I navigated all that day with light winds. I could not arrive in time to be\nable to see the bottom, so as to drop the anchor on a clear place, for it is necessary to be very careful not to lose the\nanchors. So I stood off and on all that night until day, when I came to an inhabited place where I anchored, and\nwhence that man had come that I found yesterday in the canoe in mid channel. He had given such a good report\nof us that there was no want of canoes alongside the ship all that night, which brought us water and what they had\nto offer. I ordered each one to be given something, such as a few beads, ten or twelve of those made of glass on a\nthread, some timbrels made of brass such as are worth a maravedi in Spain, and some straps, all which they looked\nupon as most excellent. I also ordered them to be given treacle to eat when they came on board. At three o\u2019clock I\nsent the ship\u2019s boat on shore for water, and the natives with good will showed my people where the water was, and\nthey themselves brought the full casks down to the boat, and did all they could to please us. \u201cThis island is\nvery large, and I have determined to sail round it, because, so far as I can understand, there is a mine in or near it.\nThe island is eight leagues from Santa Maria, nearly east and west; and this point I had reached, as well as all the\ncoast, trends N.N.W. and S.S.E. I saw at least 20 leagues of it, and then it had not ended. Now, as I am writing this,\nI made sail with the wind at the south, to sail round the island, and to navigate until I find Samaot, which is the\nisland or city where there is gold, as all the natives say who are on board, and as those of San Salvador and Santa\nMaria told us. These people resemble those of the said islands, with the same language and customs, except that\nthese appear to me a rather more domestic and tractable people, yet also more subtle. For I observed that those who\nbrought cotton and other trifles to the ship, knew better than the others how to make a bargain. In this island I saw\ncotton cloths made like mantles. The people were better disposed, and the women wore in front of their bodies a\nsmall piece of cotton which scarcely covered them.\n\u201cIt is a very green island, level and very fertile, and I have no doubt that they sow and gather corn all the year\nround, as well as other things. I saw many trees very unlike those of our country. Many of them have their branches\ngrowing in different ways and all from one trunk, and one twig is one form, and another in a different shape, and so\nunlike that it is the greatest wonder in the world to see the great diversity; thus one branch has leaves like those of a\ncane, and others like those of a mastick tree: and on a single tree there are five or six different kinds. Nor are these\ngrafted, for it may be said that grafting is unknown, the trees being wild, and untended by these people. They do not\nknow any religion, and I believe they could easily be converted to Christianity, for they are very intelligent. Here the\nfish are so unlike ours that it is wonderful. Some are the shape of dories, and of the finest colours in the world, blue,\nyellow, red, and other tints, all painted in various ways, and the colours are so bright that there is not a man who\nwould not be astonished, and would not take great delight in seeing them. There are also whales. I saw no beasts on\nthe land of any kind, except parrots and lizards. A boy told me that he saw a large serpent. I saw neither sheep, nor\ngoats, nor any other quadruped. It is true I have been here a short time, since noon, yet I could not have failed to\nsee some if there had been any. I will write respecting the circuit of this island after I have been round it.\u201d\nWednesday, 17th of October\n\u201cAt noon I departed from the village off which I was anchored, and where I took in water, to sail round this\nisland of Fernandina. The wind was S.W. and South. My wish was to follow the coast of this island to the S.E., from\nwhere I was, the whole coast trending N.N.W. and S.S.E.; because all the Indians I bring with me, and others, made\nsigns to this southern quarter, as the direction of the island they call Samoet, where the gold is. Martin Alonso\nPinzon, captain of the caravel Pinta, on board of which I had three of the Indians, came to me and said that one of\nthem had given him to understand very positively that the island might be sailed round much quicker by shaping a\nN.N.W. course. I saw that the wind would not help me to take the course I desired, and that it was fair for the other,\nso I made sail to the N.N.W. When I was two leagues from the cape of the island, I discovered a very wonderful\nharbour. It has one mouth, or, rather, it may be said to have two, for there is an islet in the middle. Both are very\nnarrow, and within it is wide enough for a hundred ships, if there was depth and a clean bottom, and the entrance\nwas deep enough. It seemed desirable to explore it and take soundings, so I anchored outside, and went in with all\n197 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nthe ship\u2019s boats, when we saw there was insufficient depth. As I thought, when I first saw it, that it was the mouth of\nsome river, I ordered the water-casks to be brought. On shore I found eight or ten men, who presently came to us\nand showed us the village, whither I sent the people for water, some with arms, and others with the casks: and, as it\nwas some little distance, I waited two hours for them.\n\u201cDuring that time I walked among the trees, which was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen, beholding as\nmuch verdure as in the month of May in Andalusia. The trees are as unlike ours as night from day, as are the fruits,\nthe herbs, the stones, and everything. It is true that some of the trees bore some resemblance to those in Castille,\nbut most of them are very different, and some were so unlike that no one could compare them to anything in\nCastille. The people were all like those already mentioned: like them naked, and the same size. They give what they\npossess in exchange for anything that may be given to them. I here saw some of the ship\u2019s boys bartering broken bits\nof glass and crockery for darts. The men who went for water told me that they had been in the houses of the natives,\nand that they were very plain and clean inside. Their beds and bags for holding things were like nets of cotton. The\nhouses are like booths, and very high, with good chimneys. But, among many villages that I saw, there was none\nthat consisted of more than from twelve to fifteen houses. Here they found that the married women wore clouts\nof cotton, but not the young girls, except a few who were over eighteen years of age. They had dogs, mastiffs and\nhounds; and here they found a man who had a piece of gold in his nose, the size of half a castellano, on which they\nsaw letters. I quarrelled with these people because they would not exchange or give what was required; as I wished\nto see what and whose this money was; and they replied that they were not accustomed to barter.\n\u201cAfter the water was taken I returned to the ship, made sail, and shaped a course N.W., until I had discovered\nall the part of the coast of the island which trends east to west. Then all the Indians turned round and said that this\nisland was smaller than Samoet, and that it would be well to return back so as to reach it sooner. The wind presently\nwent down, and then sprang up from W.N.W., which was contrary for us to continue on the previous course. So I\nturned back, and navigated all that night to E.S.E., sometimes to east and to S.E. This course was steered to keep\nme clear of the land, for there were very heavy clouds and thick weather, which did not admit of my approaching\nthe land to anchor. On that night it rained very heavily from midnight until nearly dawn, and even afterwards the\nclouds threatened rain. We found ourselves at the S.W. end of the island, where I hoped to anchor until it cleared\nup, so as to see the other island whither I have to go. On all these days, since I arrived in these Indies, it has rained\nmore or less. Your Highnesses may believe that this land is the best and most fertile, and with a good climate, level,\nand as good as there is in the world.\u201d\nThursday, 18th of October\n\u201cAfter it had cleared up I went before the wind, approaching the island as near as I could, and anchored when it\nwas no longer light enough to keep under sail. But I did not go on shore, and made sail at dawn.\u201d\nFriday, 19th of October\n\u201cI weighed the anchors at daylight, sending the caravel Pinta on an E.S.E. course, the caravel Ni\u00f1a S.S.E., while\nI shaped a S.E. course, giving orders that these courses were to be steered until noon, and that then the two caravels\nshould alter course so as to join company with me. Before we had sailed for three hours we saw an island to the east,\nfor which we steered, and all three vessels arrived at the north point before noon. Here there is an islet, and a reef\nof rocks to seaward of it, besides one between the islet and the large island. The men of San Salvador, whom I bring\nwith me, called it Saomete, and I gave it the name of Isabella. The wind was north, and the said islet bore from the\nisland of Fernandina, whence I had taken my departure, east and west. Afterwards we ran along the coast of the is-\nland, westward from the islet, and found its length to be 12 leagues as far as a cape, which I named Cabo Hermoso,\nat the western end. The island is beautiful, and the coast very deep, without sunken rocks off it. Outside the shore\nis rocky, but further in there is a sandy beach, and here I anchored on that Friday night until morning. This coast\nand the part of the island I saw is almost flat, and the island is very beautiful; for if the other islands are lovely, this\nis more so. It has many very green trees, which are very large. The land is higher than in the other islands, and in it\nthere are some hills, which cannot be called mountains; and it appears that there is much water inland. From this\npoint to the N.E. the coast makes a great angle, and there are many thick and extensive groves. I wanted to go and\nanchor there, so as to go on shore and see so much beauty; but the water was shallow, and we could only anchor at\na distance from the land. The wind also was fair for going to this cape, where I am now anchored, to which I gave\nthe name of Cabo Hermoso, because it is so. Thus it was that I do not anchor in that angle, but as I saw this cape so\ngreen and so beautiful, like all the other lands of these islands, I scarcely knew which to visit first; for I can never\ntire my eyes in looking at such lovely vegetation, so different from ours. I believe that there are many herbs and\nmany trees that are worth much in Europe for dyes and for medicines; but I do not know, and this causes me great\n198 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\nsorrow. Arriving at this cape, I found the smell of the trees and flowers so delicious that it seemed the pleasantest\nthing in the world. To-morrow, before I leave this place, I shall go on shore to see what there is at this cape. There\nare no people, but there are villages in the interior, where, the Indians I bring with me say, there is a king who has\nmuch gold. To-morrow I intend to go so far inland as to find the village, and see and have some speech with this\nking, who, according to the signs they make, rules over all the neighbouring islands, goes about clothed, and wears\nmuch gold on his person. I do not give much faith to what they say, as well because I do not understand them as\nbecause they are so poor in gold that even a little that this king may have would appear much to them. This cape, to\nwhich I have given the name of Cabo Fermoso, is, I believe, on an island separated from Saometo, and there is an-\nother small islet between them. I did not try to examine them in detail, because it could not be done in 50 years. For\nmy desire is to see and discover as much as I can before returning to your Highnesses, our Lord willing, in April. It\nis true that in the event of finding places where there is gold or spices in quantity I should stop until I had collected\nas much as I could. I, therefore, proceed in the hope of coming across such places.\u201d\nSaturday, 20th of October\n\u201cTo-day, at sunrise, I weighed the anchors from where I was with the ship, and anchored off the S.W. point\nof the island of Saometo, to which I gave the name of Cabo de la Laguna, and to the island Isabella. My intention\nwas to navigate to the north-east and east from the south-east and south, where, I understood from the Indians I\nbrought with me, was the village of the king. I found the sea so shallow that I could not enter nor navigate in it, and\nI saw that to follow a route by the south-east would be a great round. So I determined to return by the route that I\nhad taken from the N.N.E. to the western part, and to sail round this island to. . . .\n\u201cI had so little wind that I never could sail along the coast, except during the night. As it was dangerous to an-\nchor off these islands except in the day, when one can see where to let go the anchor: for the bottom is all in patches,\nsome clear and some rocky: I lay to all this Sunday night. The caravels anchored because they found themselves\nnear the shore, and they thought that, owing to the signals that they were in the habit of making, I would come to\nanchor, but I did not wish to do so.\u201d\nSunday, 21st of October\n\u201cAt ten o\u2019clock I arrived here, off this islet, and anchored, as well as the caravels. After breakfast I went on shore,\nand found only one house, in which there was no one, and I supposed they had fled from fear, because all their\nproperty was left in the house. I would not allow anything to be touched, but set out with the captains and people\nto explore the island. If the others already seen are very beautiful, green, and fertile, this is much more so, with\nlarge trees and very green. Here there are large lagoons with wonderful vegetation on their banks. Throughout the\nisland all is green, and the herbage like April in Andalusia. The songs of the birds were so pleasant that it seemed as\nif a man could never wish to leave the place. The flocks of parrots concealed the sun; and the birds were so numer-\nous, and of so many different kinds, that it was wonderful. There are trees of a thousand sorts, and all have their\nseveral fruits; and I feel the most unhappy man in the world not to know them, for I am well assured that they are\nall valuable. I bring home specimens of them, and also of the land. Thus walking along round one of the lakes I\nsaw a serpent, which we killed, and I bring home the skin for your Highnesses. As soon as it saw us it went into\nthe lagoon, and we followed, as the water was not very deep, until we killed it with lances. It is 7 palmos long, and\nI believe that there are many like it in these lagoons. Here I came upon some aloes, and I have determined to take\nten quintals on board to-morrow, for they tell me that they are worth a good deal. Also, while in search of good\nwater, we came to a village about half a league from our anchorage. The people, as soon as they heard us, all fled\nand left their houses, hiding their property in the wood. I would not allow a thing to be touched, even the value of a\npin. Presently some men among them came to us, and one came quite close. I gave him some bells and glass beads,\nwhich made him very content and happy. That our friendship might be further increased, I resolved to ask him for\nsomething; I requested him to get some water. After I had gone on board, the natives came to the beach with cala-\nbashes full of water, and they delighted much in giving it to us. I ordered another string of glass beads to be present-\ned to them, and they said they would come again to-morrow. I wished to fill up all the ships with water at this place,\nand, if there should be time, I intended to search the island until I had had speech with the king, and seen whether\nhe had the gold of which I had heard. I shall then shape a course for another much larger island, which I believe to\nbe Cipango, judging from the signs made by the Indians I bring with me. They call it Cuba, and they say that there\nare ships and many skilful sailors there. Beyond this island there is another called Bosio, which they also say is very\nlarge, and others we shall see as we pass, lying between. According as I obtain tidings of gold or spices I shall settle\nwhat should be done. I am still resolved to go to the mainland and the city of Guisay, and to deliver the letters of\nyour Highnesses to the Gran Can, requesting a reply and returning with it.\u201d\n199 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nMonday, 22nd of October\n\u201cAll last night and to-day I was here, waiting to see if the king or other person would bring gold or anything of\nvalue. Many of these people came, like those of the other islands, equally naked and equally painted, some white,\nsome red, some black, and others in many ways. They brought darts and skeins of cotton to barter, which they\nexchanged with the sailors for bits of glass, broken crockery, and pieces of earthenware. Some of them had pieces of\ngold fastened in their noses, which they willingly gave for a hawk\u2019s bell and glass beads. But there was so little that it\ncounts for nothing. It is true that they looked upon any little thing that I gave them as a wonder, and they held our\narrival to be a great marvel, believing that we came from heaven. We got water for the ships from a lagoon which is\nnear the Cabo del Isleo (Cape of the islet), as we named it. In the said lagoon Martin Alonso Pinzon, captain of the\nPinta, killed another serpent 7 palmos long, like the one we got yesterday. I made them gather here as much of the\naloe as they could find.\u201d\nTuesday, 23rd of October\n\u201cI desired to set out to-day for the island of Cuba, which I think must be Cipango, according to the signs these\npeople make, indicative of its size and riches, and I did not delay any more here nor round this island to the resi-\ndence of this King or Lord, and have speech with him, as I had intended. This would cause me much delay, and I see\nthat there is no gold mine here. To sail round would need several winds, for it does not blow here as men may wish.\nIt is better to go where there is great entertainment, so I say that it is not reasonable to wait, but rather to continue\nthe voyage and inspect much land, until some very profitable country is reached, my belief being that it will be rich\nin spices. That I have no personal knowledge of these products causes me the greatest sorrow in the world, for I see\na thousand kinds of trees, each one with its own special fruit, all green now as in Spain during the months of May\nand June, as well as a thousand kinds of herbs with their flowers; yet I know none of them except this aloe, of which\nI ordered a quantity to be brought on board to bring to your Highnesses. I have not made sail for Cuba because\nthere is no wind, but a dead calm with much rain. It rained a great deal yesterday without causing any cold. On the\ncontrary, the days are hot and the nights cool, like May in Andalusia.\u201d\nWednesday, 24th of October\n\u201cAt midnight I weighed the anchors and left the anchorage at Cabo del Isleo, in the island of Isabella. From\nthe northern side, where I was, I intended to go to the island of Cuba, where I heard of the people who were very\ngreat, and had gold, spices, merchandise, and large ships. They showed me that the course thither would be W.S.W.,\nand so I hold. For I believe that it is so, as all the Indians of these islands, as well as those I brought with me in the\nships, told me by signs. I cannot understand their language, but I believe that it is of the island of Cipango that they\nrecount these wonders. On the spheres I saw, and on the delineations of the map of the world, Cipango is in this\nregion. So I shaped a course W.S.W. until daylight, but at dawn it fell calm and began to rain, and went on nearly\nall night. I remained thus, with little wind, until the afternoon, when it began to blow fresh. I set all the sails in the\nship, the mainsail with two bonnets, the foresail, spritsail, mizen, main topsail, and the boat\u2019s sail on the poop. So I\nproceeded until nightfall, when the Cabo Verde of the island of Fernandina, which is at the S.W. end, bore N.W. dis-\ntant 7 leagues. As it was now blowing hard, and I did not know how far it was to this island of Cuba, I resolved not\nto go in search of it during the night; all these islands being very steep-to, with no bottom round them for a distance\nof two shots of a lombard. The bottom is all in patches, one bit of sand and another of rock, and for this reason it is\nnot safe to anchor without inspection with the eye. So I determined to take in all the sails except the foresail, and to\ngo on under that reduced canvas. Soon the wind increased, while the route was doubtful, and there was very thick\nweather, with rain. I ordered the foresail to be furled, and we did not make two leagues during that night.\u201d\nThursday, 25th of October\n\u201cI steered W.S.W, from after sunset until 9 o\u2019clock, making 5 leagues. Afterwards I altered course to west, and\nwent 8 miles an hour until one in the afternoon; and from that time until three made good 44 miles. Then land was\nsighted, consisting of 7 or 8 islands, the group running north and south, distant from us 5 leagues.\u201d\nFriday, 26th of October\n\u201cThe ship was on the south side of the islands, which were all low, distant 5 or 6 leagues. I anchored there.\nThe Indians on board said that thence to Cuba was a voyage in their canoes of a day and a half; these being small\ndug-outs without a sail. Such are their canoes. I departed thence for Cuba, for by the signs the Indians made of its\ngreatness, And of its gold and pearls, I thought that it must be Cipango.\u201d\n200 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\nSaturday, 27th of October\n\u201cI weighed from these islands at sunrise, and gave them the name of Las Islas de Arena, owing to the little depth\nthe sea had for a distance of 6 leagues to the southward of them. We went 8 miles an hour on a S.S.W. course until one\no\u2019clock, having made 40 miles. Until night we had run 28 miles on the same course, and before dark the land was sight-\ned. At night there was much rain. The vessels, on Saturday until sunset, made 17 leagues on a S.S.W. course.\u201d\nSunday, 28th of October\n\u201cI went thence in search of the island of Cuba on a S.S.W. coast, making for the nearest point of it, and entered\na very beautiful river without danger of sunken rocks or other impediments. All the coast was clear of dangers up\nto the shore. The mouth of the river was 12 brazos across, and it is wide enough for a vessel to beat in. I anchored\nabout a lombard-shot inside.\u201d The Admiral says that \u201che never beheld such a beautiful place, with trees bordering\nthe river, handsome, green, and different from ours, having fruits and flowers each one according to its nature.\nThere are many birds, which sing very sweetly. There are a great number of palm trees of a different kind from those\nin Guinea and from ours, of a middling height, the trunks without that covering, and the leaves very large, with\nwhich they thatch their houses. The country is very level.\u201d The Admiral jumped into his boat and went on shore.\nHe came to two houses, which he believed to belong to fishermen who had fled from fear. In one of them he found\na kind of dog that never barks, and in both there were nets of palm-fibre and cordage, as well as horn fish-hooks,\nbone harpoons, and other apparatus \u201cfor fishing, and several hearths. He believed that many people lived together\nin one house. He gave orders that nothing in the houses should be touched, and so it was done.\u201d The herbage was as\nthick as in Andalusia during April and\nMay. He found much purslane and wild amaranth. He returned to the boat and went up the river for some dis-\ntance, and he says it was great pleasure to see the bright verdure, and the birds, which he could not leave to go back.\nHe says that this island is the most beautiful that eyes have seen, full of good harbours and deep rivers, and the sea\nappeared as if it never rose; for the herbage on the beach nearly reached the waves, which does not happen where\nthe sea is rough. (Up to that time they had not experienced a rough sea among all those islands.) He says that the\nisland is full of very beautiful mountains, although they are not very extensive as regards length, but high; and all\nthe country is high like Sicily. It is abundantly supplied with water, as they gathered from the Indians they had tak-\nen with them from the island of Guanahani. These said by signs that there are ten great rivers, and that they cannot\ngo round the island in twenty days. When they came near land with the ships, two canoes came out; and, when they\nsaw the sailors get into a boat and row about to find the depth of the river where they could anchor, the canoes fled.\nThe Indians say that in this island there are gold mines and pearls, and the Admiral saw a likely place for them and\nmussel-shells, which are signs of them. He understood that large ships of the Gran Can came here, and that from\nhere to the mainland was a voyage of ten days. The Admiral called this river and harbour San Salvador.\nMonday, 29th of October\nThe Admiral weighed anchor from this port and sailed to the westward, to go to the city, where, as it seemed,\nthe Indians said that there was a king. They doubled a point six leagues to the N.W., and then another point, then\neast ten leagues. After another league he saw a river with no very large entrance, to which he gave the name of Rio\nde la Luna. He went on until the hour of Vespers. He saw another river much larger than the others, as the Indians\ntold him by signs, and near he saw goodly villages of houses. He called the river Rio de Mares. He sent two boats\non shore to a village to communicate, and one of the Indians he had brought with him, for now they understood\na little, and show themselves content with Christians. All the men, women, and children fled, abandoning their\nhouses with all they contained. The Admiral gave orders that nothing should be touched. The houses were better\nthan those he had seen before, and he believed that the houses would improve as he approached the mainland. They\nwere made like booths, very large, and looking like tents in a camp without regular streets, but one here and anoth-\ner there. Within they were clean and well swept, with the furniture well made. All are of palm branches beautifully\nconstructed. They found many images in the shape of women, and many heads like masks, very well carved. It was\nnot known whether these were used as ornaments, or to be worshipped. They had dogs which never bark, and wild\nbirds tamed in their houses. There was a wonderful supply of nets and other fishing implements, but nothing was\ntouched. He believed that all the people on the coast were fishermen, who took the fish inland, for this island is very\nlarge, and so beautiful, that he is never tired of praising it. He says that he found trees and fruits of very marvellous\ntaste; and adds that they must have cows or other cattle, for he saw skulls which were like those of cows. The songs\nof the birds and the chirping of crickets throughout the night lulled everyone to rest, while the air was soft and\nhealthy, and the nights neither hot nor cold. On the voyage through the other islands there was great heat, but here\nit is tempered like the month of May. He attributed the heat of the other islands to their flatness, and to the wind\n201 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ncoming from the east, which is hot. The water of the rivers was salt at the mouth, and they did not know whence\nthe natives got their drinking-water, though they have sweet water in their houses. Ships are able to turn in this\nriver, both entering and coming out, and there are very good leading-marks. He says that all this sea appears to be\nconstantly smooth, like the river at Seville, and the water suitable for the growth of pearls. He found large shells un-\nlike those of Spain. Remarking on the position of the river and port, to which he gave the name of San Salvador, he\ndescribes its mountains as lofty and beautiful, like the Pena de las Enamoradas, and one of them has another little\nhill on its summit, like a graceful mosque. The other river and port, in which he now was, has two round mountains\nto the S.W., and a fine low cape running out to the W.S.W.\nTuesday, 30th of October\nHe left the Rio de Mares and steered N.W., seeing a cape covered with palm trees, to which he gave the name of\nCabo de Palmas after having made good 15 leagues. The Indians on board the caravel Pinta said that beyond that\ncape there was a river, and that from the river to Cuba it was four days journey. The captain of the Pinta reported that\nhe understood from that, that this Cuba was a city, and that the land was a great continent trending far to the north.\nThe king of that country, he gathered, was at war with the Gran Can, whom they called Cami, and his land or city\nFava, with many other names. The Admiral resolved to proceed to that river, and to send a present, with the letter of\nthe Sovereigns, to the king of that land. For this service there was a sailor who had been to Guinea, and some of the\nIndians of Guanahani wished to go with him, and afterwards to return to their homes. The Admiral calculated that he\nwas forty-two degrees to the north of the equinoctial line (but the handwriting is here illegible). He says that he must\nattempt to reach the Gran Can, who he thought was here or at the city of Cathay, which belongs to him, and is very\ngrand, as he was informed before leaving Spain. All this land, he adds, is low and beautiful, and the sea deep.\nWednesday, 31st of October\nAll Tuesday night he was beating to windward, and he saw a river, but could not enter it because the entrance\nwas narrow. The Indians fancied that the ships could enter wherever their canoes could go. Navigating onwards, he\ncame to a cape running out very far, and surrounded by sunken rocks, and he saw a bay where small vessels might\ntake shelter. He could not proceed because the wind had come round to the north, and all the coast runs N.W. and\nS.E. Another cape further on ran out still more. For these reasons, and because the sky showed signs of a gale, he\nhad to return to the Rio de Mares.\nThursday, November the 1st\nAt sunrise the Admiral sent the boats on shore to the houses that were there, and they found that all the people\nhad fled. After some time a man made his appearance. The Admiral ordered that he should be left to himself, and\nthe sailors returned to the boats. After dinner, one of the Indians on board was sent on shore. He called out from a\ndistance that there was nothing to fear, because the strangers were good people and would do no harm to anyone,\nnor were they people of the Gran Can, but they had given away their things in many islands where they had been.\nThe Indian then swam on shore, and two of the natives took him by the arms and brought him to a house, where\nthey heard what he had to say. When they were certain that no harm would be done to them they were reassured,\nand presently more than sixteen canoes came to the ships with cotton-thread and other trifles. The Admiral ordered\nthat nothing should be taken from them, that they might understand that he sought for nothing but gold, which\nthey call nucay. Thus they went to and fro between the ships and the shore all day, and they came to the Christians\non shore with confidence. The Admiral saw no gold whatever among them, but he says that he saw one of them\nwith a piece of worked silver fastened to his nose. They said, by signs, that within three days many merchants from\ninland would come to buy the things brought by the Christians, and would give information respecting the king of\nthat land. So far as could be understood from their signs, he resided at a distance of four days\u2019 journey. They had\nsent many messengers in all directions, with news of the arrival of the Admiral. \u201cThese people\u201d, says the Admiral,\n\u201care of the same appearance and have the same customs as those of the other islands, without any religion so far as\nI know, for up to this day I have never seen the Indians on board say any prayer; though they repeat the Salve and\nAve Maria with their hands raised to heaven, and they make the sign of the cross. The language is also the same,\nand they are all friends; but I believe that all these islands are at war with the Gran Can, whom they called Cavila,\nand his province Bafan. They all go naked like the others.\u201d This is what the Admiral says. \u201cThe river,\u201d he adds, \u201cis\nvery deep, and the ships can enter the mouth, going close to the shore. The sweet water does not come within a\nleague of the mouth. It is certain,\u201d says the Admiral, \u201cthat this is the mainland, and that I am in front of Zayto and\nGuinsay, a hundred leagues, a little more or less, distant the one from the other. It is very clear that no one before\nhas been so far as this by sea. Yesterday, with wind from the N.W., I found it cold.\u201d\n202 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\nFriday, 2nd of November\nThe Admiral decided upon sending two Spaniards, one named Rodrigo de Jerez, who lived in Ayamonte,\nand the other Luis de Torres, who had .served in the household of the Adelantado of Murcia, and had been a Jew,\nknowing Hebrew, Chaldee, and even some Arabic. With these men he sent two Indians, one from among those he\nhad brought from Guanahani, and another a native of the houses by the river-side. He gave them strings of beads\nwith which to buy food if they should be in need, and ordered them to return in six days. He gave them specimens\nof spices, to see if any were to be found. Their instructions were to ask for the king of that land, and they were told\nwhat to say on the part of the Sovereigns of Castille, how they had sent the Admiral with letters and a present, to\ninquire after his health and establish friendship, favouring him in what he might desire from them. They were to\ncollect information respecting certain provinces, ports, and rivers of which the Admiral had notice, and to ascertain\ntheir distances from where he was.\nThis night the Admiral took an altitude with a quadrant, and found that the distance from the equinoctial line\nwas 42 degrees. He says that, by his reckoning, he finds that he has gone over 1,142 leagues from the island of Hier-\nro. He still believes that he has reached the mainland.\nSaturday, 3rd of November\nIn the morning the Admiral got into the boat, and, as the river is like a great lake at the mouth, forming a very\nexcellent port, very deep, and clear of rocks, with a good beach for careening ships, and plenty of fuel, he explored\nit until he came to fresh water at a distance of two leagues from the mouth. He ascended a small mountain to obtain\na view of the surrounding country, but could see nothing, owing to the dense foliage of the trees, which were very\nfresh and odoriferous, so that he felt no doubt that there were aromatic herbs among them. He said that all he saw\nwas so beautiful that his eyes could never tire of gazing upon such loveliness, nor his ears of listening to the songs of\nbirds. That day many canoes came to the ships, to barter with cotton threads and with the nets in which they sleep,\ncalled hamacas.\nSunday, 4th of November\nAt sunrise the Admiral again went away in the boat, and landed to hunt the birds he had seen the day before.\nAfter a time, Martin Alonso Pinzon came to him with two pieces of cinnamon, and said that a Portuguese, who was\none of his crew, had seen an Indian carrying two very large bundles of it; but he had not bartered for it, because of\nthe penalty imposed by the Admiral on anyone who bartered. He further said that this Indian carried some brown\nthings like nutmegs. The master of the Pinta said that he had found the cinnamon trees. The Admiral went to the\nplace, and found that they were not cinnamon trees. The Admiral showed the Indians some specimens of cinnamon\nand pepper he had brought from Castillo, and they knew it, and said, by signs, that there was plenty in the vicinity,\npointing to the S.E. He also showed them gold and pearls, on which certain old men said that there was an infinite\nquantity in a place called Bohio, and that the people wore it on their necks, ears, arms, and legs, as well as pearls. He\nfurther understood them to say that there were great ships and much merchandise, all to the S.E. He also under-\nstood that, far away, there were men with one eye, and others with dogs\u2019 noses who were cannibals, and that when\nthey captured an enemy they beheaded him and drank his blood.\nThe Admiral then determined to return to the ship and wait for the return of the two men he had sent, intend-\ning to depart and seek for those lands, if his envoys brought some good news touching what he desired. The Admi-\nral further says: \u201cThese people arc very gentle and timid; they go naked, as I have said, without arms and without\nlaw. The country is very fertile. The people have plenty of roots called zanahorias (yams), with a smell like chesnuts;\nand they have beans of kinds very different from ours. They also have much cotton, which they do not sow, as it is\nwild in the mountains, and I believe they collect it throughout the year, because I saw pods empty, others full, and\nflowers all on one tree. There are a thousand other kinds of fruits which it is impossible for me to write about, and\nall must be profitable.\u201d All this the Admiral says.\nMonday, 5th of November\nThis morning the Admiral ordered the ship to be careened, afterwards the other vessels, but not all at the same\ntime. Two were always to be at the anchorage, as a precaution; although he says that these people were very safe,\nand that without fear all the vessels might have been careened at the same time. Things being in this state, the mas-\nter of the Ni\u00f1a came to claim a reward from the Admiral because he had found mastick, but he did not bring the\nspecimen, as he had dropped it. The Admiral promised him a reward, and sent Rodrigo Sanchez and master Diego\nto the trees. They collected some, which was kept to present to the Sovereigns, as well as the tree. The Admiral says\nthat he knew it was mastick, though it ought to be gathered at the proper season. There is enough in that district for\n203 Compact Anthology of World Literature\na yield of 1,000 qnintals every year. The Admiral also found here a great deal of the plant called aloe. He further says\nthat the Puerto de Mares is the best in the world, with the finest climate and the most gentle people. As it has a high,\nrocky cape, a fortress might be built, so that, in the event of the place becoming rich and important, the merchants\nwould be safe from any other nations. He adds: \u201cThe Lord, in whose hands are all victories, will ordain all things for\nhis service. An Indian said by signs that the mastick was good for pains in the stomach.\u201d\nTuesday, 6th of November\n\u201cYesterday, at night\u201d, says the Admiral, \u201cthe two men came back who had been sent to explore the interior.\nThey said that after walking 12 leagues they came to a village of 50 houses, were there were a thousand inhabitants,\nfor many live in one house. These houses are like very large booths. They said that they were received with great\nsolemnity, according to custom, and all, both men and women, came out to see them. They were lodged in the best\nhouses, and the people touched them, kissing their hands and feet, marvelling and believing that they came from\nheaven, and so they gave them to understand. They gave them to eat of what they had. When they arrived, the chief\npeople conducted them by the arms to the principal house, gave them two chairs on which to sit, and all the natives\nsat round them on the ground. The Indian who came with them described the manner of living of the Christians,\nand said that they were good people. Presently the men went out, and the women came sitting round them in the\nsame way, kissing their hands and feet, and looking to see if they were of flesh and bones like themselves. They\nbegged the Spaniards to remain with them at least five days.\u201d The Spaniards showed the natives specimens of cin-\nnamon, pepper, and other spices which the Admiral had given them, and they said, by signs, that there was plenty\nat a short distance from thence to S.E., but that there they did not know whether there was any. Finding that they\nhad no information respecting cities, the Spaniards returned; and if they had desired to take those who wished\nto accompany them, more than 500 men and women would have come, because they thought the Spaniards were\nreturning to heaven. There came, however, a principal man of the village and his son, with a servant. The\nAdmiral conversed with them, and showed them much honour. They made signs respecting many lands and is-\nlands in those parts. The Admiral thought of bringing them to the Sovereigns. He says that he knew not what fancy\ntook them; either from fear, or owing to the dark night, they wanted to land. The ship was at the time high and dry,\nbut, not wishing to make them angry, he let them go on their saying that they would return at dawn, but they never\ncame back. The two Christians met with many people on the road going home, men and women with a half-burnt\nweed in their hands, being the herbs they are accustomed to smoke. They did not find villages on the road of more\nthan five houses, all receiving them with the same reverence. They saw many kinds of trees, herbs, and sweet-smell-\ning flowers; and birds of many different kinds, unlike those of Spain, except the partridges, geese, of which there are\nmany, and singing nightingales. They saw no quadrupeds except the dogs that do not bark. The land is very fertile,\nand is cultivated with yams and several kinds of beans different from ours, as well as corn. There were great quan-\ntities of cotton gathered, spun, and worked up. In a single house they saw more than 500 arrobas, and as much as\n4,000 quintals could be yielded every year. The Admiral said that \u201cit did not appear to be cultivated, and that it bore\nall the year round. It is very fine, and has a large boll. All that was possessed by these people they gave at a very low\nprice, and a great bundle of cotton was exchanged for the point of a needle or other trifle. They are a people\u201d, says\nthe Admiral, \u201cguileless and unwarlike. Men and women go as naked as when their mothers bore them. It is true that\nthe women wear a very small rag of cotton-cloth, and they are of very good appearance, not very dark, less so than\nthe Canarians. I hold, most serene Princes, that if devout religious persons were here, knowing the language, they\nwould all turn Christians. I trust in our Lord that your Highnesses will resolve upon this with much diligence, to\nbring so many great nations within the Church, and to convert them; as you have destroyed those who would not\nconfess the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. And after your days, all of us being mortal, may your kingdoms\nremain in peace, and free from heresy and evil, and may you be well received before the eternal Creator, to whom\nI pray that you may have long life and great increase of kingdoms and lordships, with the will and disposition to\nincrease the holy Christian religion as you have done hitherto. Amen!\u201d \u201cTo day I got the ship afloat, and prepared to\ndepart on Thursday, in the name of God, and to steer S.E. in search of gold and spices, and to discover land.\u201d These\nare the words of the Admiral, who intended to depart on Thursday, but, the wind being contrary, he could not go\nuntil the 12th of November.\nMonday, 12th of November\nThe Admiral left the port and river of Mares before dawn to visit the island called Babeque, so much talked of\nby the Indians on board, where, according to their signs, the people gather the gold on the beach at night with can-\ndles, and afterwards beat it into bars with hammers. To go thither it was necessary to shape a course E. b. S. After\nhaving made 8 leagues along the coast, a river was sighted, and another 4 leagues brought them to another river,\n204 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\nwhich appeared to be of great volume, and larger than any they had yet seen. The Admiral did not wish to stop nor\nto enter any of these rivers, for two reasons: the first and principal one being that wind and weather were favourable\nfor going in search of the said island of Babeque; the other, that, if there was a populous and famous city near the\nsea, it would be visible, while, to go up the rivers, small vessels are necessary, which those of the expedition were\nnot. Much time would thus be lost; moreover, the exploration of such rivers is a separate enterprise. All that coast\nwas peopled near the river, to which the name of Rio del Sol was given.\nThe Admiral says that, on the previous Sunday, the 11th of November, it seemed good to take some persons\nfrom amongst those at Rio de Mares, to bring to the Sovereigns, that they might learn our language, so as to be able\nto tell us what there is in their lands. Returning, they would be the mouthpieces of the Christians, and would adopt\nour customs and the things of the faith. \u201c I saw and knew\u201d (says the Admiral) \u201c that these people arc without any\nreligion, not idolaters, but very gentle, not knowing what is evil, nor the sins of murder and theft, being without\narms, and so timid that a hundred would fly before one Spaniard, although they joke with them. They, however,\nbelieve and know that there is a God in heaven, and say that we have come from heaven. At any prayer that we say,\nthey repeat, and make the sign of the cross. Thus your Highnesses should resolve to make them Christians, for I\nbelieve that, if the work was begun, in a little time a multitude of nations would be converted to our faith, with the\nacquisition of great lordships, peoples, and riches for Spain. Without doubt, there is in these lands a vast quantity\nof gold, and the Indians I have on board do not speak without reason when they say that in these islands there are\nplaces where they dig out gold, and wear it on their necks, ears, arms, and legs, the rings being very large. There are\nalso precious stones, pearls, and an infinity of spices. In this river of Mares, whence we departed to-night, there is\nundoubtedly a great quantity of mastick, and much more could be raised, because the trees may be planted, and\nwill yield abundantly. The leaf and fruit are like the mastick, but the tree and leaf are larger. As Pliny describes it, I\nhave seen it on the island of Chios in the Archipelago. I ordered many of these trees to be tapped, to see if any of\nthem would yield resin; but, as it rained all the time I was in that river, I could not get any, except a very little, which\nI am bringing to your Highnesses. It may not be the right season for tapping, which is, I believe, when the trees\ncome forth after winter and begin to flower. But when I was there the fruit was nearly ripe. Here also there is a great\nquantity of cotton, and I believe it would have a good sale here without sending it to Spain, but to the great cities\nof the Gran Can, which will be discovered without doubt, and many others ruled over by other lords, who will be\npleased to serve your Highnesses, and whither will be brought other commodities of Spain and of the Eastern lands;\nbut these are to the west as regards us. There is also here a great yield of aloes, though this is not a commodity that\nwill yield great profit. The mastick, however, is important, for it is only obtained from the said island of Chios, and\nI believe the harvest is worth 50,000 ducats, if I remember right. There is here, in the mouth of the river, the best\nport I have seen up to this time, wide, deep, and clear of rocks. It is an excellent site for a town and fort, for any ship\ncould come close up to the walls; the land is high, with a temperate climate, and very good water.\n\u201cYesterday a canoe came alongside the ship, with six youths in it. Five came on board, and I ordered them to be\ndetained. They are now here. I afterwards sent to a house on the western side of the river, and seized seven women,\nold and young, and three children. I did this because the men would behave better in Spain if they had women of\ntheir own land, than without them. For on many occasions the men of Guinea have been brought to learn the lan-\nguage in Portugal, and afterwards, when they returned, and it was expected that they would be useful in their land,\nowing to the good company they had enjoyed and the gifts they had received, they never appeared after arriving.\nOthers may not act thus. But, having women, they have the wish to perform what they are required to do; besides,\nthe women would teach our people their language, which is the same in all these islands, so that those who make\nvoyages in their canoes are understood everywhere. On the other hand, there are a thousand different languages in\nGuinea, and one native does not understand another.\n\u201cThe same night the husband of one of the women came alongside in a canoe, who was father of the three\nchildren\u2014one boy and two girls. He asked me to let him come with them, and besought me much. They are now\nall consoled at being with one who is a relation of them all. He is a man of about 45 years of age.\u201d All these are the\nwords of the Admiral. He also says that he had felt some cold, and that it would not be wise to continue discoveries\nin a northerly direction in the winter. On this Monday, until sunset, he steered a course E. b. S., making 18 leagues,\nand reaching a cape, to which he gave the name of Cabo de Cuba.\nTuesday, 13th of November\nThis night the ships were on a bowline, as the sailors say, beating to windward without making any progress. At\nsunset they began to see an opening in the mountains, where two very high peaks were visible. It appeared that here\nwas the division between the land of Cuba and that\nof Bohio, and this was affirmed by signs, by the Indians who were on board. As soon as the day had dawned,\nthe Admiral made sail towards the land, passing a point which appeared at night to be distant two leagues. He then\n205 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nentered a large gulf, 5 leagues to the S.S.E., and there remained 5 more, to arrive at the point where, between two\ngreat mountains, there appeared to be an opening; but it could not be made out whether it was an inlet of the sea.\nAs he desired to go to the island called Babeque, where, according to the information he had received, there was\nmuch gold; and as it bore east, and as no large town was in sight, the wind freshening more than ever, he resolved\nto put out to sea, and work to the east with a northerly wind. The ship made 8 miles an hour, and from ten in the\nforenoon, when that course was taken, until sunset, 56 miles, which is 14 leagues to the eastward from the Cabo\nde Cuba. The other land of Bohio was left to leeward. Commencing from the cape of the said gulf, he discovered,\naccording to his reckoning, 80 miles, equal to 20 leagues, all that coast running E.S.E. and W.N.W.\nWednesday, 14th of November\nAll last night the Admiral was boating to windward (he said that it would be unreasonable to navigate among\nthose islands during the night, until they had been explored), for the Indians said yesterday that it would take three\ndays to go from Rio de Mares to the island of Babeque, by which should be understood days\u2019 journeys in their\ncanoes equal to about 7 leagues. The wind fell, and, the course being east, she could not lay her course nearer than\nS.E., and, owing to other mischances, he was detained until the morning. At sunrise he determined to go in search\nof a port, because the wind had shifted from north to N.E., and, if a port could not be found, it would be necessary\nto go back to the ports in the island of Cuba, whence they came. The Admiral approached the shore, having gone\nover 28 miles E.S.E. that night. He steered south \u2026.. miles to the land, where he saw many islets and openings. As\nthe wind was high and the sea rough, he did not dare to risk an attempt to enter, but ran along the coast W.N.W.,\nlooking out for a port, and saw many, but none very clear of rocks. After having proceeded for 64 miles, he found a\nvery deep opening, a quarter of a mile wide, with a good port and river. He ran in with her head S.S.W., afterwards\nsouth to S.E. The port was spacious and very deep, and he saw so many islands that he could not count them all,\nwith very high land covered with trees of many kinds, and an infinite number of palms. He was much astonished\nto see so many lofty islands; and assured the Sovereigns that the mountains and isles he had seen since yesterday\nseemed to him to be second to none in the world; so high and clear of clouds and snow, with the sea at their bases\nso deep. He believes that these islands are those innumerable ones that are depicted on the maps of the world in the\nFar East. He believed that they yielded very great riches in precious stones and spices, and that they extend much\nfurther to the south, widening out in all directions. He gave the name of La Mar de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora, and to the\nhaven, which is near the mouth of the entrance to these islands, Puerto del Principe. He did not enter it, but exam-\nined it from outside, until another time, on Saturday of the next week, as will there appear. He speaks highly of the\nfertility, beauty, and height of the islands which he found in this gulf, and he tells the Sovereigns not to wonder at\nhis praise of them, for that he has not told them the hundredth part. Some of them seemed to reach to heaven, run-\nning up into peaks like diamonds. Others have a flat top like a table. At their bases the sea is of a great depth, with\nenough water for a very large carrack. All are covered with foliage and without rocks.\nThursday, 15th of November\nThe Admiral went to examine these islands in the ships\u2019 boats, and speaks marvels of them, how he found ma-\nstick, and aloes without end. Some of them were cultivated with the roots of which the Indians make bread; and he\nfound that fires had been lighted in several places. He saw no fresh water. There were some natives, but they fled. In\nall parts of the sea where the vessels were navigated he found a depth of 15 or 16 fathoms, and all basa, by which he\nmeans that the ground is sand, and not rocks; a thing much desired by sailors, for the rocks cut their anchor cables.\nFriday, 16th of November\nAs in all parts, whether islands or mainlands, that he visited, the Admiral always left a cross; so, on this occasion,\nhe went in a boat to the entrance of these havens, and found two very large trees on a point of land, one longer than\nthe other. One being placed over the other, made a cross, and he said that a carpenter could not have made it better.\nHe ordered a very large and high cross to be made out of these timbers. He found canes on the beach, and did not\nknow where they had grown, but thought they must have been brought down by some river, and washed up on the\nbeach (in which opinion he had reason). He went to a creek on the south-east side of the entrance to the port. Here,\nunder a height of rock and stone like a cape, there was depth enough for the largest carrack in the world close in\nshore, and there was a corner where six ships might lie without anchors as in a room. It seemed to the Admiral that a\nfortress might be built here at small cost, if at any time any famous trade should arise in that sea of islands.\nReturning to the ship, he found that the Indians who were on board had fished up very large shells found in\nthose seas. He made the people examine them, to see if there was mother-o\u2019-pearl, which is in the shells where\n206 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\npearls grow. They found a great deal, but no pearls, and their absence was attributed to its not being the season,\nwhich is May and June. The sailors found an animal which seemed to be a taso, or taxor. They also fished with nets,\nand, among many others, caught a fish which was exactly like a pig, not like a tunny, but all covered with a very\nhard shell, without a soft place except the eyes. It was ordered to be salted, to bring home for the Sovereigns to see.\nSaturday, 17th of November\nThe Admiral got into the boat, and went to visit the islands he had not yet seen to the S.W. He saw many more\nvery fertile and pleasant islands, with a great depth between them. Some of them had springs of fresh water, and\nhe believed that the water of those streams came from some sources at the summits of the mountains. He went on,\nand found a beach bordering on very sweet water, which was very cold. There was a beautiful meadow, and many\nvery tall palms. They found a large nut of the kind belonging to India, great rats, and enormous crabs. He saw many\nbirds, and there was a strong smell of musk, which made him think it must be there. This day the two eldest of the\nsix youths brought from the Rio de Mares, who were on board the caravel Ni\u00f1a, made their escape.\nSunday, 18th of November\nThe Admiral again went away with the boats, accompanied by many of the sailors, to set up the cross which he\nhad ordered to be made out of the two large trees at the entrance to the Puerto del Principe, on a fair site cleared of\ntrees, whence there was an extensive and very beautiful view. He says that there is a greater rise and fall there than\nin any other port he has seen, and that this is no marvel, considering the numerous islands. The tide is the reverse\nof ours, because here, when the moon is S.S.W., it is low water in the port. He did not get under weigh, because it\nwas Sunday.\nMonday, 19th of November\nThe Admiral Qt under weigh before sunrise, in a calm. In the afternoon there was some wind from the east,\nand lie shaped a N.N.E. course. At sunset the Puerto del Principe bore S.S.W. 7 leagues. He saw the island of\nBabeque bearing due east about 60 miles. He steered N.E. all that night, making 60 miles, and up to ten o\u2019clock of\nTuesday another dozen; altogether 18 leagues N.E. b. W.\nTuesday, 20th of November\nThey left Babeque, or the islands of Babeque, to the E.S.E., the wind being contrary; and, seeing that no prog-\nress was being made, and the sea was getting rough, the Admiral determined to return to the Puerto del Principe,\nwhence he had started, which was 25 leagues distant. He did not wish to go to the island he had called Isabella,\nwhich was twelve leagues off, and where he might have anchored that night, for two reasons: one was that he had\nseen two islands to the south which he wished to explore; the other, because the Indians he brought with him,\nwhom he had taken at the island of Guanahani, which he named San Salvador, eight leagues from Isabella, might\nget away, and he said that he wanted them to take to Spain. They thought that, when the Admiral had found gold,\nhe would let them return to their homes. He came near the Puerto del Principe, but could not reach it, because it\nwas night, and because the current drifted them to the N.W. He turned her head to N.E. with a light wind. At three\no\u2019clock in the morning the wind changed, and a course was shaped E.N.E., the wind being S.S.W., and changing at\ndawn to south and S.E. At sunset Puerto del Principe bore nearly S.W. by W. 48 miles, which are 12 leagues.\nWednesday, 21st of November\nAt sunrise the Admiral steered cast, with a southerly wind, but made little progress, owing to a contrary sea. At\nvespers he had gone 24 miles. Afterwards the wind changed to east, and he steered S. b. E., at sunset having gone\n12 miles. Here he found himself forty-two degrees north of the equinoctial line, as in the port of Mares, but he says\nthat he kept the result from the quadrant in suspense until he reached the shore, that it might be adjusted (as it\nwould seem that he thought this distance was too great, and he had reason, it not being possible, as these islands are\nonly in. . . . .degrees).\nThis day Martin Alonso Pinzon parted company with the caravel Pinta, in disobedience to and against the wish\nof the Admiral, and out of avarice, thinking that an Indian who had been put on board his caravel could show him\nwhere there was much gold. So he parted company, not owing to bad weather, but because he chose. Here the Ad-\nmiral says: \u201cHe had done and said many other things to me.\u201d\n207 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThursday, 22nd of November\nOn Wednesday night the Admiral steered S.S.E., with the wind east, but it was nearly calm. At 3 it began to\nblow from N.N.E.; and he continued to steer south to see the land he had seen in that quarter. When the sun rose\nhe was as far off as the day before, owing to adverse currents, the land being 40 miles off. This night Martin Alonso\nshaped a course to the east, to go to the island of Babeque, where the Indians say there is much gold. He did this in\nsight of the Admiral, from whom he was distant 16 miles. The Admiral stood towards the land all night. He short-\nened sail, and showed a lantern, because Pinzon would thus have an opportunity of joining him, the night being\nvery clear, and the wind fair to come, if he had wished to do so.\nFriday, 23rd of November\nThe Admiral stood towards the land all day, always steering south with little wind, but the current would never\nlet them reach it, being as far off at sunset as in the morning. The wind was E.N.E., and they could shape a southerly\ncourse, but there was little of it. Beyond this cape there stretched out another land or cape, also trending east, which\nthe Indians on board called Bohio. They said that it was very large, and that there were people in it who had one\neye in their foreheads, and others who were cannibals, and of whom they were much afraid. When they saw that\nthis course was taken, they said that they could not talk to these people because they would be eaten, and that they\nwere very well armed. The Admiral says that he well believes that there were such people, and that if they are armed\nthey must have some ability. He thought that they may have captured some of the Indians, and because they did not\nreturn to their homes, the others believed that they had been eaten. They thought the same of the Christians and of\nthe Admiral when some of them first saw the strangers.\nSaturday, 24th of November\nThey navigated all night, and at 3 they reached the island at the very same point they had come to the week\nbefore, when they started for the island of Babeque. At first the Admiral did not dare to approach the shore, be-\ncause it seemed that there would be a great surf in that mountain-girded bay. Finally he reached the sea of Nuestra\nSe\u00f1ora, where there are many islands, and entered a port near the mouth of the opening to the islands. He says that\nif he had known of this port before he need not have occupied himself in exploring the islands, and it would not\nhave been necessary to go back. He, however, considered that the time was well spent in examining the islands. On\nnearing the land he sent in the boat to sound; finding a good sandy bottom in 6 to 20 fathoms. He entered the hav-\nen, pointing the ship\u2019s head S.W. and then west, the flat island bearing north. This, with another island near it, forms\na harbour which would hold all the ships of Spain safe from all winds. This entrance on the S.W. side is passed by\nsteering S.S.W., the outlet being to the west very deep and wide. Thus a vessel can pass amidst these islands, and he\nwho approaches from the north, with a knowledge of them, can pass along the coast. These islands are at the foot\nof a great mountain-chain running east and west, which is longer and higher than any others on this coast, where\nthere are many. A reef of rocks outside runs parallel with the said mountains, like a bench, extending to the en-\ntrance. On the side of the flat island, and also to the S.E., there is another small reef, but between them there is great\nwidth and depth. Within the port, near the S.E. side of the entrance, they saw a large and very fine river, with more\nvolume than any they had yet met with, and fresh water could be taken from it as far as the sea. At the entrance\nthere is a bar, but within it is very deep, 19 fathoms. The banks are lined with palms and many other trees.\nSunday, 25th of November\nBefore sunrise the Admiral got into the boat, and went to see a cape or point of land to the S.E. of the flat island,\nabout a league and a half distant, because there appeared to be a good river there. Presently, near to S.E. side of\nthe cape, at a distance of two cross-bow shots, he saw a large stream of beautiful water falling from the mountains\nabove, with a loud noise. He went to it, and saw some stones shining in its bed like gold. He remembered that in\nthe river Tejo, near its junction with the sea, there was gold; so it seemed to him that this should contain gold, and\nhe ordered some of these stones to be collected, to be brought to the Sovereigns. Just then the sailor boys called out\nthat they had found large pines. The Admiral looked up the hill, and saw that they were so wonderfully large that he\ncould not exaggerate their height and straightness, like stout yet fine spindles. He perceived that here there was ma-\nterial for great store of planks and masts for the largest ships in Spain. He saw oaks and arbutus trees, with a good\nriver, and the means of making water-power. The climate was temperate, owing to the height of the mountains. On\nthe beach he saw many other stones of the colour of iron, and others that some said were like silver ore, all brought\ndown by the river. Here he obtained a new mast and yard for the mizen of the caravel Ni\u00f1a. He came to the mouth\nof the river, and entered a creek which was deep and wide, at the foot of that S.E. part of the cape, which would ac-\ncommodate a hundred ships without any anchor or hawsers. Eyes never beheld a better harbour. The mountains are\n208 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\nvery high, whence descend many limpid streams, and all the hills are covered with pines, and an infinity of diverse\nand beautiful trees. Two or three other rivers were not visited.\nThe Admiral described all this, in much detail, to the Sovereigns, and declared that he had derived unspeakable\njoy and pleasure at seeing it, more especially the pines, because they enable as many ships as is desired to be built\nhere, bringing out the rigging, but finding here abundant supplies of wood and provisions. He affirms that he has\nnot enumerated a hundredth part of what there is here, and that it pleased our Lord always to show him one thing\nbetter than another, as well on the ground and among the trees, herbs, fruits, and flowers, as in the people, and\nalways something different in each place. It had been the same as regards the havens and the waters. Finally, he says\nthat if it caused him who saw it so much wonder, how much more will it affect those who hear about it; yet no one\ncan believe until he sees it.\nMonday, 26th of November\nAt sunrise the Admiral weighed the anchors in the haven of Santa Catalina, where he was behind the flat island,\nand steered along the coast in the direction of Cabo del Pico, which was S.E. He reached the cape late, because the\nwind failed, and then saw another cape, S.E. b. E. 60 miles, which, when 20 miles off, was named Cabo de Campa-\nna, but it could not be reached that day. They made good 32 miles during the day, which is 8 leagues. During this\ntime the Admiral noted nine remarkable ports, which all the sailors thought wonderfully good, and five large rivers;\nfor they sailed close along the land, so as to see everything. All along the coast there are very high and beautiful\nmountains, not arid or rocky, but all accessible, and very lovely. The valleys, like the mountains, were full of tall and\nfine trees, so that it was a glory to look upon them, and there seemed to be many pines. Also, beyond the said Cabo\nde Pico to the S.E. there are two islets, each about two leagues round, and inside them three excellent havens and\ntwo large rivers. Along the whole coast no inhabited places were visible from the sea. There may have been some,\nand there were indications of them, for, when the men landed, they found signs of people and numerous remains\nof fires. The Admiral conjectured that the land he saw to-day S.E. of the Cabo de Campana was the island called by\nthe Indians Bohio: it looked as if this cape was separated from the mainland. The Admiral says that all the people he\nhas hitherto met with have very great fear of those of Caniba or Canima. They affirm that they live in the island of\nBohio, which must be very large, according to all accounts. The Admiral understood that those of Caniba come to\ntake people from their homes, they being very cowardly, and without knowledge of arms. For this cause it appears\nthat these Indians do not settle on the sea-coast, owing to being near the land of Caniba. When the natives who\nwere on board saw a course shaped for that land, they feared to speak, thinking they were going to be eaten; nor\ncould they rid themselves of their fear. They declared that the Canibas had only one eye and dogs\u2019 faces. The Admi-\nral thought they lied, and was inclined to believe that it was people from the dominions of the Gran Can who took\nthem into captivity.\nTuesday, 27th of November\nYesterday, at sunset, they arrived near a cape named Campana by the Admiral; and, as the sky was clear and\nthe wind light, he did not wish to run in close to the land and anchor, although he had five or six singularly good\nhavens under his lee. The Admiral was attracted on the one hand by the longing and delight he felt to gaze upon\nthe beauty and freshness of those lands, and on the other by a desire to complete the work he had undertaken. For\nthese reasons he remained close hauled, and stood off and on during the night. But, as the currents had set him\nmore than 5 or 6 leagues to the S.E. beyond where he had been at nightfall, passing the land of Campana, he came\nin sight of a great opening beyond that cape, which seemed to divide one land from another, leaving an island\nbetween them. He decided to go back, with the wind S.E., steering to the point where the opening had appeared,\nwhere he found that it was only a large bay; and at the end of it, on the S.E. side, there was a point of land on which\nwas a high and square-cut hill, which had looked like an island. A breeze sprang up from the north, and the Admi-\nral continued on a S.E. course, to explore the coast and discover all that was there. Presently he saw, at the foot of\nthe Cabo de Campana a wonderfully good port, and a large river, and, a quarter of a league on, another river, and\na third, and a fourth to a seventh at similar distances, from the furthest one to Cabo de Campana being 20 miles\nS.E. Most of these rivers have wide and deep mouths, with excellent havens for large ships, without sandbanks or\nsunken rocks. Proceeding onwards from the last of these rivers, on a S.E, course, they came to the largest inhabited\nplace they had yet seen, and a vast concourse of people came down to the beach with loud shouts, all naked, with\ntheir darts in their hands. The Admiral desired to have speech with them, so he furled sails and anchored. The boats\nof the ship and the caravel were sent on shore, with orders to do no harm whatever to the Indians, but to give them\npresents. The Indians made as if they would resist the landing, but, seeing that the boats of the Spaniards continued\nto advance without fear, they retired from the beach. Thinking that they would not be terrified if only two or three\nlanded, three Christians were put on shore, who told them not to be afraid, in their own language, for they had been\n209 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nable to learn a little from the natives who were on board. But all ran away, neither great nor small remaining. The\nChristians went to the houses, which were of straw, and built like the others they had seen, but found no one in any\nof them. They returned to the ships, and made sail at noon in the direction of a fine cape to the eastward, about 8\nleagues distant. Having gone about half a league, the Admiral saw, on the south side of the same bay, a very remark-\nable harbour, and to the S.E. some wonderfully beautiful country like a valley among the mountains, whence much\nsmoke arose, indicating a large population, with signs of much cultivation. So he resolved to stop at this port, and\nsee if he could have any speech or intercourse with the inhabitants. It was so that, if the Admiral had praised the\nother havens, he must praise this still more for its lands, climate, and people. He tells marvels of the beauty of the\ncountry and of the trees, there being palms and pine trees; and also of the great valley, which is not flat, but diversi-\nfied by hill and dale, the most lovely scene in the world. Many streams flow from it, which fall from the mountains.\nAs soon as the ship was at anchor the Admiral jumped into the boat, to get soundings in the port, which is the\nshape of a hammer. When he was facing the entrance he found the mouth of a river on the south side of sufficient\nwidth for a galley to enter it, but so concealed that it is not visible until close to. Entering it for the length of the\nboat, there was a depth of from 5 to 8 fathoms. In passing up it the freshness and beauty of the trees, the clearness\nof the water, and the birds, made it all so delightful that he wished never to leave them. He said to the men who\nwere with him that to give a true relation to the Sovereigns of the things they had seen, a thousand tongues would\nnot suffice, nor his hand to write it, for that it was like a scene of enchantment. He desired that many other prudent\nand credible witnesses might see it, and he was sure that they would be as unable to exaggerate the scene as he was.\nThe Admiral also says:\u2014\u201cHow great the benefit that is to be derived from this country would be, I cannot say. It\nis certain that where there are such lands there must be an infinite number of things that would be profitable. But I\ndid not remain long in one port, because I wished to see as much of the country as possible, in order to make a re-\nport upon it to your Highnesses; and besides, I do not know the language, and these people neither understand me\nnor any other in my company; while the Indians I have on board often misunderstand. Moreover, I have not been\nable to see much of the natives, because they often take to flight. But now, if our Lord pleases, I will see as much as\npossible, and will proceed by little and little, learning and comprehending; and I will make some of my followers\nlearn the language. For I have perceived that there is only one language up to this point. After they understand the\nadvantages, I shall labour to make all these people Christians. They will become so readily, because they have no\nreligion nor idolatry, and your Highnesses will send orders to build a city and fortress, and to convert the people.\nI assure your Highnesses that it does not appear to me that there can be a more fertile country nor a better climate\nunder the sun, with abundant supplies of water. This is not like the rivers of Guinea, which are all pestilential. I\nthank our Lord that, up to this time, there has not been a person of my company who has so much as had a head-\nache, or been in bed from illness, except an old man who has suffered from the stone all his life, and he was well\nagain in two days. I speak of all three vessels. If it will please God that your Highnesses should send learned men\nout here, they will see the truth of all I have said. I have related already how good a place Rio de Mares would be\nfor a town and fortress, and this is perfectly true; but it bears no comparison with this place, nor with the Mar de\nNuestra Se\u00f1ora. For here there must be a large population, and very valuable productions, which I hope to discover\nbefore I return to Castille. I say that if Christendom will find profit among these people, how much more will Spain,\nto whom the whole country should be subject. Your Highnesses ought not to consent that any stranger should trade\nhere, or put his foot in the country, except Catholic Christians, for this was the beginning and end of the undertak-\ning; namely, the increase and glory of the Christian religion, and that no one should come to these parts who was\nnot a good Christian.\u201d\nAll the above are the Admiral\u2019s words. He ascended the river for some distance, examined some branches of it,\nand, returning to the mouth, he found some pleasant groves of trees, like a delightful orchard. Here he came upon\na canoe, dug out of one tree, as big as a galley of twelve, benches, fastened under a boat-house made of wood, and\nthatched with palm-leaves, so that it could be neither injured by sun nor by the water. He says that here would be\nthe proper site for a town and fort, by reason of the good port, good water, good land, and abundance of fuel.\nWednesday, 28th of November\nThe Admiral remained during this day, in consequence of the rain and thick weather, though he might have run\nalong the coast, the wind being S.W., but he did not weigh, because he was unacquainted with the coast beyond,\nand did not know what danger there might be for the vessels. The sailors of the two vessels went on shore to wash\ntheir clothes, and some of them walked inland for a short distance. They found indications of a large population,\nbut the houses were all empty, everyone having fled. They returned by the banks of another river, larger than that\nwhich they knew of, at the port.\n210 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\nThursday, 29th of November\nThe rain and thick weather continuing, the Admiral did not get under weigh. Some of the Christians went to\nanother village to the N.W., but found no one, and nothing in the houses. On the road they met an old man who\ncould not run away, and caught him. They told him they did not wish to do him any harm, gave him a few pres-\nents, and let him go. The Admiral would have liked to have had speech with him, for he was exceedingly satisfied\nwith the delights of that land, and wished that a settlement might be formed there, judging that it must support a\nlarge population. In one house they found a cake of wax, which was taken to the Sovereigns, the Admiral saying\nthat where there was wax there were also a thousand other good things. The sailors also found, in one house, the\nhead of a man in a basket, covered with another basket, and fastened to a post of the house. They found the same\nthings in another village. The Admiral believed that they must be the heads of some founder, or principal ancestor\nof a lineage, for the houses are built to contain a great number of people in each; and these should be relations, and\ndescendants of a common ancestor.\nFriday, 30th of November\nThey could not get under weigh to-day because the wind was cast, and dead against them. The Admiral sent\n8 men well armed, accompanied by two of the Indians he had on board, to examine the villages inland, and get\nspeech with the people. They came to many houses, but found no one and nothing, all having fled. They saw four\nyouths who were digging in their fields, but, as soon as they saw the Christians, they ran away, and could not be\novertaken. They marched a long distance, and saw many villages and a most fertile land, with much cultivation and\nmany streams of water. Near one river they saw a canoe dug out of a single tree, 95 palmos long, and capable of\ncarrying 150 persons.\nSaturday, 1st of December\nThey did not depart, because there was still a foul wind, with much rain. The Admiral set up a cross at the\nentrance of this port, which he called Puerto Santo on some bare rocks. The point is that which is on the S.E. side\nof the entrance; but he who has to enter should make more over to the N.W.; for at the foot of both, near the rock,\nthere are 12 fathoms and a very clean bottom. At the entrance of the port, towards the S.E. point, there is a reef of\nrocks above water, sufficiently far from the shore to be able to pass between if it is necessary; for both on the side of\nthe rock and the shore there is a depth of 12 to 15 fathoms: and, on entering, a ship\u2019s head should be turned S.W.\nSunday, 2nd of December\nThe wind was still contrary, and they could not depart. Every night the wind blows on the land, but no vessel\nneed be alarmed at all the gales in the world, for they cannot blow home by reason of a reef of rocks at the opening\nto the haven. A sailor-boy found, at the mouth of the river, some stones which looked as if they contained gold;\nso they were taken to be shown to the Sovereigns. The Admiral says that there are great rivers at the distance of a\nlombard shot.\nMonday, 3rd of December\nBy reason of the continuance of an easterly wind the Admiral did not leave this port. He arranged to visit a very\nbeautiful headland a quarter of a league to the S.E. of the anchorage. He went with the boats and some armed men.\nAt the foot of the cape there was the mouth of a fair river, and on entering it they found the width to be a hundred\npaces, with a depth of one fathom. Inside they found 12, 5, 4, and 2 fathoms, so that it would hold all the ships there\nare in Spain. Leaving the river, they came to a cove in which were five very large canoes, so well constructed that\nit was a pleasure to look at them. They were under spreading trees, and a path led from them to a very well-built\nboat-house, so thatched that neither sun nor rain could do any harm. Within it there was another canoe made out\nof a single tree like the others, like a galley with 17 benches. It was a pleasant sight to look upon such goodly work.\nThe Admiral ascended a mountain, and afterwards found the country level, and cultivated with many things of that\nland, including such calabashes, as it was a glory to look upon them. In the middle there was a large village, and\nthey came upon the people suddenly; but, as soon as they were seen, men and women took to flight. The Indian\nfrom on board, who was with the Admiral, cried out to them that they need not be afraid, as the strangers were\ngood people. The Admiral made him give them bells, copper ornaments, and glass beads, green and yellow, with\nwhich they were well content. He saw that they had no gold nor any other precious thing, and that it would suffice\n211 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nto leave them in peace. The whole district was well peopled, the rest having fled from fear. The Admiral assures the\nSovereigns that ten thousand of these men would run from ten, so cowardly and timid are they. No arms are carried\nby them, except wands, on the point of which a short piece of wood is fixed, hardened by fire, and these they are\nvery ready to exchange. Returning to where he had left the boats, he sent back some men up the hill, because he\nfancied he had seen a large apiary. Before those he had sent could return, they were joined by many Indians, and\nthey went to the boats, where the Admiral was waiting with all his people. One of the natives advanced into the riv-\ner near the stern of the boat, and made a long speech, which the Admiral did not understand. At intervals the other\nIndians raised their hands to heaven, and shouted. The Admiral thought he was assuring him that he was pleased\nat his arrival; but he saw the Indian who came from the ship change the colour of his face, and turn as yellow as\nwax, trembling much, and letting the Admiral know by signs that he should leave the river, as they were going to\nkill him. He pointed to a cross-bow which one of the Spaniards had, and showed it to the Indians, and the Admiral\nlet it be understood that they would all be slain, because that cross-bow carried far and killed people. He also took\na sword and drew it out of the sheath, showing it to them, and saying the same, which, when they had heard, they\nall took to flight; while the Indian from the ship still trembled from cowardice, though he was a tall, strong man.\nThe Admiral did not want to leave the river, but pulled towards the place where the natives had assembled in great\nnumbers, all painted, and as naked as when their mothers bore them. Some had tufts of feathers on their heads, and\nall had their bundles of darts.\nThe Admiral says: \u201cI came to them, and gave them some mouthfuls of bread, asking for the darts, for which\nI gave in exchange copper ornaments, bells, and glass beads. This made them peaceable, so that they came to the\nboats again, and gave us what they had. The sailors had killed a turtle, and the shell was in the boat in pieces. The\n.sailor-boys gave them some in exchange for a bundle of darts. These are like the other people we have seen, and\nwith the same belief that we came from heaven. They are ready to give whatever thing they have in exchange for\nany trifle without saying it is little; and I believe they would do the same with gold and spices if they had any. I saw\na fine house, not very large, and with two doors, as all the rest have. On entering, I saw a marvellous work, there be-\ning rooms made in a peculiar way, that I scarcely know how to describe it. Shells and other things were fastened to\nthe ceiling. I thought it was a temple, and I called them and asked, by signs, whether prayers were offered up there.\nThey said that they were not, and one of them climbed up and offered me all the things that were there, of which I\ntook some.\u201d\nTuesday, 4th of December\nThe Admiral made sail with little wind, and left that port, which he called Puerto Santo. After going two\nleagues, he saw the great river of which he spoke yesterday. Passing along the land, and beating to windward on S.E.\nand W.N.W. courses, they reached Cabo Lindo, which is E.S.E. 5 leagues from Cabo del Monte. A league and a half\nfrom Cabo del Monte there is an important but rather narrow river, which seemed to have a good entrance, and\nto be deep. Three-quarters of a league further on, the Admiral saw another very large river, and he thought it must\nhave its source at a great distance. It had a hundred paces at its mouth, and no bar, with a depth of 8 fathoms. The\nAdmiral sent the boat in, to take soundings, and they found the water fresh until it enters the sea.\nThis river had great volume, and must have a large population on its banks. Beyond Cabo Lindo there is a great\nbay, which would be open for navigation to E.N.E. and S.E. and S.S.W.\nWednesday, 5th of December\nAll this night they were beating to windward off Cape Lindo, to reach the land to the east, and at sunrise the\nAdmiral sighted another cape, two and a half leagues to the east. Having passed it, he saw that the land trended S.\nand S.W., and presently saw a fine high cape in that direction, 7 leagues distant. He would have wished to go there,\nbut his object was to reach the island of Babeque, which, according to the Indians, bore N.E.; so he gave up the\nintention. He could not go to Babeque either, because the wind was N.E. Looking to the S.E., he saw land, which\nwas a very large island, according to the information of the Indians, well peopled, and called by them Bohio. The\nAdmiral say that the inhabitants of Cuba, or Juana, and of all the other islands, are much afraid of the inhabitants of\nBohio, because they say that they eat people.\nThe Indians relate other things, by signs, which are very wonderful; but the Admiral did not believe them. He\nonly inferred that those of Bohio must have more cleverness and cunning to be able to capture the others, who,\nhowever, are very poor-spirited. The wind veered from N.E. to North, so the Admiral determined to leave Cuba, or\nJuana, which, up to this time, he had supposed to be the mainland, on account of its size, having coasted along it\nfor 120 leagues. He shaped a course S.E. b. E., the land he had sighted hearing S.E.; taking this precaution because\nthe wind always veered from N. to N.E. again, and thence to East and S.E. The wind increased, and he made all sail,\nthe current helping them; so that they were making 8 miles an hour from the morning until one in the afternoon\n212 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\n(which is barely 6 hours, for they say that the nights were nearly 15 hours). Afterwards they went 10 miles an hour,\nmaking good 88 miles by sunset, equal to 22 leagues, all to the S.E. As night was coming on, the Admiral ordered\nthe caravel Ni\u00f1a, being a good sailer, to proceed ahead, so as to sight a harbour at daylight. Arriving at the entrance\nof a port which was like the Bay of Cadiz, while it was still dark, a boat was sent in to take soundings, which showed\na light from a lantern. Before the Admiral could beat up to where the caravel was, hoping that the boat would show\na leading-mark for entering the port, the candle in the lantern went out. The caravel, not seeing the light, showed a\nlight to the Admiral, and, running down to him, related what had happened. The boat\u2019s crew then showed another\nlight, and the caravel made for it; but the Admiral could not do so, and was standing off and on all night.\nThursday, 6th of December\nWhen daylight arrived the Admiral found himself four leagues from the port, to which he gave the name of\nPuerto Maria and to a fine cape bearing S.S.W, he gave the name of Cabo del Estrella. It seemed to be the furthest\npoint of the island towards the south, distant 28 miles. Another point of land, like an island, appeared about 40\nmiles to the east. To another fine point, 54 miles to the east, he gave the name of Cabo del Elefante, and he called\nanother, 28 miles to the S.E., Cabo de Cinquin. There was a great opening or bay, which might be the mouth of a\nriver, distant 20 miles. It seemed that between Cabo del Elefante and that of Cinquin there was a great opening,\nand some of the sailors said that it formed an island, to which the name of Isla de la Tortuga was given. The island\nappeared to be very high land, not closed in with mountains, but with beautiful valleys, well cultivated, the crops\nappearing like the wheat on the plain of Cordova in May. That night they saw many fires, and much smoke, as if\nfrom workshops, in the day time; it appeared to be a signal made by people who were at war. All the coast of this\nland trends to the cast.\nAt the hour of vespers the Admiral reached this port, to which he gave the name of Puerto de San Nicolas, in\nhonour of St. Nicholas, whose day it was; and on entering it he was astonished at its beauty and excellence. Al-\nthough he had given great praise to the ports of Cuba, he had no doubt that this one not only equalled, but excelled\nthem, and none of them are like it. At the entrance it is a league and a half wide, and a vessel\u2019s head should be\nturned S.S.E., though, owing to the great width, she may be steered on any bearing that is convenient; proceeding\non this course for two leagues. On the south side of the entrance the coast forms a cape, and thence the course is\nalmost the same as far as a point where there is a fine beach, and a plain covered with fruit-bearing trees of many\nkinds; so that the Admiral thought there must be nutmegs and other spices among them, but he did not know\nthem, and they were not ripe. There is a river falling into the harbour, near the middle of the beach. The depth of\nthis port is surprising, for, until reaching the land, for a distance of. . . . .the lead did not reach the bottom at 40 fath-\noms; and up to this length there are 15 fathoms with a very clean bottom. Throughout the port there is a depth of 1\n5 fathoms, with a clean bottom, at a short distance from the shore; and all along the coast there are soundings with\nclean bottom, and not a single sunken rock. Inside, at the length of a boat\u2019s oar from the land, there are 5 fathoms.\nBeyond the limit of the port to the S.S.E. a thousand carracks could beat up. One branch of the port to the N.E. runs\ninto the land for a long half league, and always the same width, as if it had been measured with a cord. Being in this\ncreek, which is 25 paces wide, the principal entrance to the harbour is not in sight, so that it appears land-locked.\nThe depth of this creek is 11 fathoms throughout, all with clean bottom; and close to the land, where one might put\nthe gangboards on the grass, there are eight fathoms.\nThe whole port is open to the air, and clear of trees. All the island appeared to be more rocky than any that\nhad been discovered. The trees are smaller, and many of them of the same kinds as are found in Spain, such as the\nilex, the arbutus, and others, and it is the same with the herbs. It is a very high country, all open and clear, with a\nvery fine air, and no such cold has been met with elsewhere, though it cannot be called cold except by comparison.\nTowards the front of the haven there is a beautiful valley, watered by a river; and in that district there must be many\ninhabitants, judging from the number of large canoes, like galleys, with 15 benches. All the natives fled as soon as\nthey saw the ships. The Indians who were on board had such a longing to return to their homes that the Admiral\nconsidered whether he should not take them back when he should depart from here. They were already suspicious,\nbecause he did not shape a course towards their country; whence he neither believed what they said, nor could he\nunderstand them, nor they him, properly. The Indians on board had the greatest fear in the world of the people\nof this island. In order to get speech of the people it would be necessary to remain some days in harbour; but the\nAdmiral did not do so, because he had to continue his discoveries, and because he could not tell how long he might\nbe detained. He trusted in our Lord that the Indians he brought with him would understand the language of the\npeople of this island; and afterwards he would communicate with them, trusting that it might please God\u2019s Majesty\nthat he might find trade in gold before he returned.\nFriday, 7th of December\n213 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nAt daybreak the Admiral got under weigh, made sail, and left the port of St. Nicholas. He went on with the\nwind in the west for two leagues, until he reached the point which forms the Carenero, when the angle in the coast\nbore S.E., and the Cabo de la Estrella was 24 miles to the S.W. Thence he steered along the coast eastward to Cabo\nCinquin about 48 miles, 20 of them being on an E.N.E. coast. All the coast is very high, with a deep sea. Close in\nshore there are 20 to 30 fathoms, and at the distance of a lombard-shot there is no bottom; all which the Admiral\ndiscovered that day, as he sailed along the coast with the wind S.W., much to his satisfaction. The cape, which runs\nout in the port of St. Nicholas the length of a shot from a lombard, could be made an island by cutting across it,\nwhile to sail round it is a circuit of 3 or 4 miles. All that land is very high, not clothed with very high trees, but with\nilex, arbutus, and others proper to the land of Castille. Before reaching Cape Cinquin by two leagues, the Admiral\ndiscovered an opening in the mountains, through which he could see a very large valley, covered with crops like\nbarley, and he therefore judged that it must sustain a large population. Behind there was a high range of mountains.\nOn reaching Cabo Cinquin, the Cabo de la Tortuga bore N.E. 32 miles. Off Cabo Cinquin, at the distance of a lom-\nbard-shot, there is a high rock, which is a good landmark. The Admiral being there, he took the bearing of Cabo\ndel Elefante, which was E.S.E. about 70 miles, the intervening land being very high. At a distance of 6 leagues there\nwas a conspicuous cape, and he saw many large valleys and plains, and high mountains inland, all reminding him\nof Spain. After 8 leagues he came to a very deep but narrow river, though a carrack might easily enter it, and the\nmouth without bar or rocks. After 16 miles there was a wide and deep harbour, with no bottom at the entrance, nor,\nat 3 paces from the shore, less than 15 fathoms; and it runs inland a quarter of a league. It being yet very early, only\none o\u2019clock in the afternoon, and the wind being aft and blowing fresh, yet, as the sky threatened much rain, and it\nwas very thick, which is dangerous even on a known coast, how much more in an unknown country, the\nAdmiral resolved to enter the port, which he called Puerto de la Concepcion. He landed near a small river\nat the point of the haven, flowing from valleys and plains, the beauty of which was a marvel to behold. He took\nfishing-nets with him; and, before he landed, a skate, like those of Spain, jumped into the boat, this being the first\ntime they had seen fish resembling the fish of Castille. The sailors caught and killed others. Walking a short distance\ninland, the Admiral found much land under cultivation, and heard the singing of nightingales and other birds of\nCastille. Five men were seen, but they would not stop, running away. The Admiral found myrtles and other Spanish\nplants, while land and mountains were like those of Castille.\nSaturday, 8th of December\nIn this port there was heavy rain, with a fresh breeze from the north. The harbour is protected from all winds\nexcept the north; but even this can do no harm whatever, because there is a great surf outside, which prevents such\na sea within the river as would make a ship work on her cables. After midnight the wind veered to N.E., and then to\nEast, from which winds this port is well sheltered by the island of Tortuga, distant 36 miles.\nSunday, 9th of December\nTo-day it rained, and the weather was wintry, like October in Castille. No habitations had been seen except a very\nbeautiful house in the Puerto de S. Nicolas, which was better built than any that had been in other parts. \u201cThe island is\nvery large,\u201d says the Admiral: \u201cit would not be much if it has a circumference of 200 leagues. All the parts he had seen\nwere well cultivated. He believed that the villages must be at a distance from the sea, whither they went when the ships\narrived; for they all took to flight, taking everything with them, and they made smoke-signals, like a people at war.\u201d\nThis port has a width of a thousand paces at its entrance, equal to a quarter of a league. There is neither bank nor reef\nwithin, and there are scarcely soundings close in shore. Its length, running inland, is 3,000 paces, all clean, and with a\nsandy bottom; so that any ship may anchor in it without fear, and enter it without precaution. At the upper end there\nare the mouths of two rivers, with the most beautiful campaign country, almost like the lands of Spain: these even have\nthe advantage; for which reasons the Admiral gave the name of the said island Isla Espa\u00f1ola\nMonday, 10th of December\nIt blew hard from the N.E., which made them drag their anchors half a cable\u2019s length. This surprised the Ad-\nmiral, who had seen that the anchors had taken good hold of the ground. As he saw that the wind was foul for the\ndirection in which he wanted to steer, he sent six men on shore, well armed, to go two or three leagues inland, and\nendeavour to open communications with the natives. They came and returned without having seen either people\nor houses. But they found some hovels, wide roads, and some places where many fires had been made. They saw\nexcellent lands, and many mastick trees, some specimens of which they took; but this is not the time for collecting\nit, as it does not coagulate.\n214 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\nTuesday, 11th of December\nThe Admiral did not depart, because the wind was still east and S.E. In front of this port, as has been said, is\nthe island of La Tortuga. It appears to be a large island, with the coast almost like that of Espa\u00f1ola, and the distance\nbetween them is about ten leagues. It is well to know that from the Cabo de Cinquin, opposite Tortuga, the coast\ntrends to the south. The Admiral had a great desire to see that channel between these two islands, and to examine\nthe island of Espa\u00f1ola, which is the most beautiful thing in the world. According to what the Indians said who were\non board, he would have to go to the island of Babeque. They declared that it was very large, with great mountains,\nrivers, and valleys; and that the island of Bohio was larger than Juana, which they call Cuba, and that it is not sur-\nrounded by water. They seem to imply that there is mainland behind Espa\u00f1ola, and they call it Caritaba, and say it\nis of vast extent. They have reason in saying that the inhabitants are a clever race, for all the people of these islands\narc in great fear of those of Caniba. So the Admiral repeats, what he has said before, that Caniba is nothing else but\nthe Gran Can, who ought now to be very near. He sends ships to capture the islanders; and as they do not return,\ntheir countrymen believe that they have been eaten. Each day we understand better what the Indians say, and they\nus, so that very often we are intelligible to each other. The Admiral sent people on shore, who found a great deal\nof mastick, but did not gather it. He says that the rains make it, and that in Chios they collect it in March. In these\nlands, being warmer, they might take it in January. They caught many fish like those of Castille\u2014dace, salmon,\nhake, dory, gilt heads, skates, corbinas, shrimps, and they saw sardines. They found many aloes.\nWednesday, 12th of December\nThe Admiral did not leave the port to-day, for the same reason: a contrary wind. He set up a great cross on the\nwest side of the entrance, on a very picturesque height, \u201cin sign\u201d, he says, \u201cthat your Highnesses hold this land for\nyour own, but chiefly as a sign of our Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d This being done, three sailors strolled into the woods to see\nthe trees and bushes. Suddenly they came upon a crowd of people, all naked like the rest. They called to them, and\nwent towards them, but they ran away. At last they caught a woman; for I had ordered that some should be caught,\nthat they might be treated well, and made to lose their fear. This would be a useful event, for it could scarcely be\notherwise, considering the beauty of the country. So they took the woman, who was very young and beautiful, to\nthe ship, where she talked to the Indians on board; for they all speak the same language. The Admiral caused her\nto be dressed, and gave her glass beads, hawks\u2019 bells, and brass ornaments; then he sent her back to the shore very\ncourteously, according to his custom. He sent three of the crew with her, and three of the Indians he had on board,\nthat they might open communications with her people. The sailors in the boat, who took her on shore, told the\nAdmiral that she did not want to leave the ship, but would rather remain with the other women he had seized at the\nport of Mares, in the island of Juana or Cuba. The Indians who went to put the woman on shore said that the na-\ntives came in a canoe, which is their caravel, in which they navigate from one place to another; but when they came\nto the entrance of the harbour, and saw the ships, they turned back, left the canoe, and took the road to the village.\nThe woman pointed out the position of the village. She had a piece of gold in her nose, which showed that there was\ngold in that island.\nThursday, 13th of December\nThe three men who had been sent by the Admiral with the woman returned at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, not\nhaving gone with her to the village, because the distance appeared to be long, or because they were afraid. They said\nthat next day many people would come to the ships, as they would have been reassured by the news brought them\nby the woman. The Admiral, with the desire of ascertaining whether there were any profitable commodities in that\nland, being so beautiful and fertile, and of having some speech with the people, and being desirous of serving the\nSovereigns, determined to send again to the village, trusting in the news brought by the woman that the Christians\nwere good people. For this service he selected nine men well armed, and suited for such an enterprise, with whom\nan Indian went from those who were on board. They reached the village, which is 4 1\/2 leagues to the S.E., and\nfound that it was situated in a very large and open valley. As soon as the inhabitants saw the Christians coming\nthey all fled inland, leaving all their goods behind them. The village consisted of a thousand houses, with over three\nthousand inhabitants. The Indian whom the Christians had brought with them ran after the fugitives, saying that\nthey should have no fear, for the Christians did not come from Cariba, but were from heaven, and that they gave\nmany beautiful things to all the people they met. They were so impressed with what he said, that upwards of two\nthousand came close up to the Christians, putting their hands on their heads, which was a sign of great reverence\nand friendship; and they were all trembling until they were reassured. The Christians related that, as soon as the na-\ntives had cast off their fear, they all went to the houses, and each one brought what he had to eat, consisting of yams,\nwhich are roots like large radishes, which they sow and cultivate in all their lands, and is their staple food. They\nmake bread of it, and roast it. The yam has the smell of a chesnut, and anyone would think he was eating chesnuts.\nThey gave their guests bread and fish, and all they had. As the Indians who came in the ship had understood that\n215 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nthe Admiral wanted to have some parrots, one of those who accompanied the Spaniards mentioned this, and the\nnatives brought out parrots, and gave them as many as they wanted, without asking anything for them. The natives\nasked the Spaniards not to go that night, and that they would give them many other things that they had in the\nmountains. While all these people were with the Spaniards, a great multitude was seen to come, with the husband of\nthe woman whom the Admiral had honoured and sent away. They wore hair over their shoulders, and came to give\nthanks to the Christians for the honour the Admiral had done them, and for the gifts. The Christians reported to\nthe Admiral that this was a handsomer and finer people than any that had hitherto been met with. But the Admiral\nsays that he does not see how they can be a finer people than the others, giving to understand that all those he had\nfound in the other islands were very well conditioned. As regards beauty, the Christians said there was no compar-\nison, both men and women, and that their skins are whiter than the others. They saw two girls whose skins were as\nwhite as any that could be seen in Spain. They also said, with regard to the beauty of the country they saw, that the\nbest land in Castille could not be compared with it. The Admiral also, comparing the lands they had seen before\nwith these, said that there was no comparison between them, nor did the plain of Cordova come near them, the dif-\nference being as great as between night and day. They said that all these lands were cultivated, and that a very wide\nand large river passed through the centre of the valley, and could irrigate all the fields. All the trees were green and\nfull of fruit, and the plants tall and covered with flowers. The roads were broad and good. The climate was like April\nin Castille; the nightingale and other birds sang as they do in Spain during that month, and it was the most pleasant\nplace in the world. Some birds sing sweetly at night. The crickets and frogs are heard a good deal. The fish are like\nthose of Spain. They saw much aloe and mastick, and cotton-fields. Gold was not found, and it is not wonderful that\nit should not have been found in so short a time.\nHere the Admiral calculated the number of hours in the day and night, and from sunrise to sunset. He found\nthat twenty half-hour glasses passed, though he says that here there may be a mistake, either because they were not\nturned with equal quickness, or because some sand may not have passed. He also observed with a quadrant, and\nfound that he was 34 degrees from the equinoctial line.\nFriday, 14th of December\nThe Admiral left the Puerto de la Concepcion with the land-breeze, but soon afterwards it fell calm (and this\nis experienced every day by those who are on this coast). Later an east wind sprang up, so he steered N.N.E., and\narrived at the island of Tortuga. He sighted a point which he named Punta Pierna, E.N.E. of the end of the island\n12 miles; and from thence another point was seen and named Punta Lanzada, in the same N.E. direction 16 miles.\nThus from the end of Tortuga to Punta Aguda the distance is 44 miles, which is 11 leagues E.N.E. Along this route\nthere are several long stretches of beach. The island of Tortuga is very high, but not mountainous, and is very beau-\ntiful and populous, like Espa\u00f1ola, and the land is cultivated, so that it looked like the plain of Cordova. Seeing that\nthe wind was foul, and that he could not steer for the island of Baneque, he determined to return to the Puerto de la\nConcepcion whence he had come; but he could not fetch a river which is two leagues to the east of that port.\nSaturday, 15th of December\nOnce more the Admiral left the Puerto de la Concepcion, but, on leaving the port, he was again met by a con-\ntrary east wind. He stood over to Tortuga, and then steered with the object of exploring the river he had been unable\nto reach yesterday; nor was he able to fetch the river this time, but he anchored half a league to leeward of it, where\nthere was clean and good anchoring ground. As soon as the vessels were secured, he went with the boats to the river,\nentering an arm of the sea, which proved not to be the river. Returning, he found the mouth, there being only one, and\nthe current very strong. He went in with the boats to find the villagers that had been seen the day before. He ordered a\ntow-rope to be got out and manned by the sailors, who hauled the boats up for a distance of two lombard-shots. They\ncould not get further owing to the strength of the current. He saw some houses, and the large valley where the villages\nwere, and he said that a more beautiful valley he had never seen, this river flowing through the centre of it. He also saw\npeople at the entrance, but they all took to flight. He further says that these people must be much hunted, for they live\nin such a state of fear. When the ships arrived at any port, they presently made smoke signals throughout the country;\nand this is done more in this island of Espa\u00f1ola and in Tortuga, which is also a large island, than in the others that\nwere visited before. He called this valley Valle del Paraiso, and the river Guadalquivir; because he says that it is the size\nof the Guadalquivir at Cordova. The banks consist of shingle, suitable for walking.\nSunday, 16th of December\nAt midnight the Admiral made sail with the land-breeze to get clear of that gulf. Passing along the coast of Es-\npa\u00f1ola on a bowline, for the wind had veered to the cast, he met a canoe in the middle of the gulf, with a single In-\n216 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\ndian in it. The Admiral was surprised how he could have kept afloat with such a gale blowing. Both the Indian and\nhis canoe were taken on board, and he was given glass beads, bells, and brass trinkets, and taken in the ship, until\nshe was off a village 17 miles from the former anchorage, where the Admiral came to again. The village appeared to\nhave been lately built, for all the houses were new. The Indian then went on shore in his canoe, bringing the news\nthat the Admiral and his companions were good people; although the intelligence had already been conveyed to the\nvillage from the place where the natives had their interview with the six Spaniards. Presently more than five hun-\ndred natives with their king came to the shore opposite the ships, which were anchored very close to the land. Pres-\nently one by one, then many by many, came to the ship without bringing anything with them, except that some had\na few grains of very fine gold in their ears and noses, which they readily gave away. The Admiral ordered them all to\nbe well treated; and he says: \u201cfor they are the best people in the world, and the gentlest; and above all I entertain the\nhope in our Lord that your Highnesses will make them all Christians, and that they will be all your subjects, for as\nyours I hold them.\u201d He also saw that they all treated the king with respect, who was on the sea-shore. The Admiral\nsent him a present, which he received in great state. He was a youth of about 21 years of age, and he had with him\nan aged tutor, and other councillors who advised and answered him, but he uttered very few words. One of the\nIndians who had come in the Admiral\u2019s ship spoke to him, telling him how the Christians had come from heaven,\nand how they came in search of gold, and wished to find the island of Baneque. He said that it was well, and that\nthere was much gold in the said island. He explained to the alguazil of the Admiral that the way they were going\nwas the right way, and that in two days they would be there; adding, that if they wanted anything from the shore he\nwould give it them with great pleasure. This king, and all the others, go naked as their mothers bore them, as do the\nwomen without any covering, and these were the most beautiful men and women that had yet been met with. They\nare fairly white, and if they were clothed and protected from the sun and air, they would be almost as fair as people\nin Spain. This land is cool, and the best that words can describe. It is very high, yet the top of the highest mountain\ncould be ploughed with bullocks; and all is diversified with plains and valleys. In all Castille there is no land that\ncan be compared with this for beauty and fertility. All this island, as well as the island of Tortuga, is cultivated like\nthe plain of Cordova. They raise on these lands crops of yams, which are small branches, at the foot of which grow\nroots like carrots, which serve as bread. They powder and knead them, and make them into bread; then they plant\nthe same branch in another part, which again sends out four or five of the same roots, which are very nutritious,\nwith the taste of chesnuts. Here they have the largest the Admiral had seen in any part of the world, for he says that\nthey have the same plant in Guinea. At this place they were as thick as a man\u2019s leg. All the people were stout and\nlusty, not thin, like the natives that had been seen before, and of a very pleasant manner, without religious belief.\nThe trees were so luxuriant that the leaves left off being green, and were dark coloured with verdure. It was a won-\nderful thing to see those valleys, and rivers of sweet water, and the cultivated fields, and land fit for cattle, though\nthey have none, for orchards, and for anything in the world that a man could seek for.\nIn the afternoon the king came on board the ship, where the Admiral received him in due form, and caused\nhim to be told that the ships belonged to the Sovereigns of Castille, who were the greatest Princes in the world. But\nneither the Indians who were on board, who acted as interpreters, nor the king, believed a word of it. They main-\ntained that the Spaniards came from heaven, and that the Sovereigns of Castille must be in heaven, and not in this\nworld. They placed Spanish food before the king to eat, and he ate a mouthful, and gave the rest to his councillors\nand tutor, and to the rest who came with him.\n\u201cYour Highnesses may believe that these lands are so good and fertile, especially these of the island of Espa\u00f1o-\nla, that there is no one who would know how to describe them, and no one who could believe if he had not seen\nthem. And your Highnesses may believe that this island, and all the others, are as much yours as Castille. Here there\nis only wanting a settlement and the order to the people to do what is required. For I, with the force I have under\nme, which is not large, could march over all these islands without opposition. I have seen only three sailors land,\nwithout wishing to do harm, and a multitude of Indians fled before them. They have no arms, and are without war-\nlike instincts; they all go naked, and are so timid that a thousand would not stand before three of our men. So that\nthey are good to be ordered about, to work and sow, and do all that may be necessary, and to build towns, and they\nshould be taught to go about clothed and to adopt our customs.\u201d\nMonday, 17th of December\nIt blew very hard during the night from E.N.E., but there was not much sea, as this part of the coast is enclosed\nand sheltered by the island of Tortuga. The sailors were sent away to fish with nets. They had much intercourse with\nthe natives, who brought them certain arrows of the Caribas or Canibales. They are made of reeds, pointed with\nsharp bits of wood hardened by fire, and are very long. They pointed out two men who wanted certain pieces of\nflesh on their bodies, giving to understand that the Canibales had eaten them by mouthfuls. The Admiral did not\nbelieve it. Some Christians were again sent to the village, and, in exchange for glass beads, obtained some pieces of\n217 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ngold beaten out into fine leaf. They saw one man, whom the Admiral supposed to be Governor of that province, called\nby them Cacique, with a piece of gold leaf as large as a hand, and it appears that he wanted to barter with it. He went\ninto his house, and the other remained in the open space outside. He cut the leaf into small pieces, and each time he\ncame out he brought a piece and exchanged it. When he had no more left, he said by signs that he had sent for more,\nand that he would bring it another day. The Admiral says that all these things, and the manner of doing them, with\ntheir gentleness and the information they gave, showed these people to be more lively and intelligent than any that\nhad hitherto been met with. In the afternoon a canoe arrived from the island of Tortuga with a crew of forty men; and\nwhen they arrived on the beach, all the people of the village sat down in sign of peace, and nearly all the crew came\non shore. The Cacique rose by himself, and, with words that appeared to be of a menacing character, made them go\nback to the canoe and shove off. He took up stones from the beach and threw them into the water, all having obedi-\nently gone back into the canoe. He also took a stone and put it in the hands of my Alguazil, that he might throw it.\nHe had been sent on shore with the Secretary to see if the canoe had brought anything of value. The Alguazil did not\nwish to throw the stone. That Cacique showed that he was well disposed to the Admiral. Presently the canoe departed,\nand afterwards they said to the Admiral that there was more gold in Tortuga than in Espa\u00f1ola, because it is nearer to\nBaneque. The Admiral did not think that there were gold mines either in Espa\u00f1ola or Tortuga, but that the gold was\nbrought from Baneque in small quantities, there being nothing to give in return. That land is so rich that there is no\nnecessity to work much to sustain life, nor to clothe themselves, as they go naked. He believed that they were very near\nthe source, and that our Lord would point out where the gold has its origin. He had information that from here to\nBaneque was four days\u2019 journey, about 34 leagues, which might be traversed with a fair wind in a single day.\nTuesday, 18th of December\nThe Admiral remained at the same anchorage, because there was no wind, and also because the Cacique had\nsaid that he had sent for gold. The Admiral did not expect much from what might be brought, but he wanted to\nunderstand better whence it came. Presently he ordered the ship and caravel to be adorned with arms and dressed\nwith flags, in honour of the feast of Santa Maria de la O, or commemoration of the Annunciation, which was on\nthat day, and many rounds were fired from the lombards. The king of that island of Espa\u00f1ola had got up very early\nand left his house, which is about five leagues away, reaching the village at three in the morning.\nThere were several men from the ship in the village, who had been sent by the Admiral to see if any gold had\narrived. They said that the king came with two hundred men; that he was carried in a litter by four men; and that\nhe was a youth, as has already been said. To-day, when the Admiral was dining under the poop, the king came on\nboard with all his people.\nThe Admiral says to the Sovereigns: \u201cWithout doubt, his state, and the reverence with which he is treated by all\nhis people, would appear good to your Highnesses, though they all go naked. When he came on board, he found\nthat I was dining at a table under the poop, and, at a quick walk, he came to sit down by me, and did not wish that\nI should give place by coming to receive him or rising from the table, but that I should go on with my dinner. I\nthought that he would like to eat of our viands, and ordered them to be brought for him to eat. When he came\nunder the poop, he made signs with his hand that all the rest should remain outside, and so they did, with the\ngreatest possible promptitude and reverence. They all sat on the deck, except the men of mature age, whom I believe\nto be his councillors and tutor, who came and sat at his feet. Of the viands which I put before him, he took of each\nas much as would serve to taste it, sending the rest to his people, who all partook of the dishes. The same thing in\ndrinking: he just touched with his lips, giving the rest to his followers. They were all of fine presence and very few\nwords. What they did say, so far as I could make out, was very clear and intelligent. The two at his feet watched his\nmouth, speaking to him and for him, and with much reverence. After dinner, an attendant brought a girdle, made\nlike those of Castille, but of different material, which he took and gave to me, with pieces of worked gold, very thin.\nI believe they get very little here, but they say that they are very near the place where it is found, and where there\nis plenty. I saw that he was pleased with some drapery I had over my bed, so I gave it him, with some very good\namber beads I wore on my neck, some coloured shoes, and a bottle of orange-flower water. He was marvellously\nwell content, and both he and his tutor and councillors were very sorry that they could not understand me, nor I\nthem. However, I knew that they said that, if I wanted anything, the whole island was at my disposal. I sent for some\nbeads of mine, with which, as a charm, I had a gold excelente, on which your Highnesses were stamped. I showed it\nto him, and said, as I had done yesterday, that your Highnesses ruled the best part of the world, and that there were\nno Princes so great. I also showed him the royal standards, and the others with a cross, of which he thought much.\nHe said to his councillors what great lords your Highnesses must be to have sent me from so far, even from heaven\nto this country, without fear. Many other things passed between them which I did not understand, except that it was\neasy to see that they held everything to be very wonderful.\u201d\nWhen it got late, and the king wanted to go, the Admiral sent him on shore in his boat very honourably, and\nsaluted him with many guns. Having landed, he got into his litter, and departed with his 200 men, his son being\n218 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\ncarried behind on the shoulders of an Indian, a man highly respected. All the sailors and people from the ships\nwere given to eat, and treated with much honour wherever they liked to stop. One sailor said that he had stopped\nin the road and seen all the things given by the Admiral. A man carried each one before the king, and these men\nappeared to be among those who were most respected. His son came a good distance behind the king, with a simi-\nlar number of attendants, and the same with a brother of the king, except that the brother went on foot, supported\nunder the arms by two honoured attendants. This brother came to the ship after the king, and the Admiral present-\ned him with some of the things used for barter. It was then that the Admiral learnt that a king was called Cacique in\ntheir language. This day little gold was got by barter, but the Admiral heard from an old man that there were many\nneighbouring islands, at a distance of a hundred leagues or more, as he understood, in which much gold is found;\nand there is even one island that was all gold. In the others there was so much that it was said they gather it with\nsieves, and they fuse it and make bars, and work it in a thousand ways. They explained the work by signs. This old\nman pointed out to the Admiral the direction and position, and he determined to go there, saying that if the old\nman had not been a principal councillor of the king he would detain him, and make him go, too; or if he knew the\nlanguage he would ask him, and he believed, as the old man was friendly with him and the other Christians, that\nhe would go of his own accord. But as these people were now subjects of the King of Castille, and it would not be\nright to injure them, he decided upon leaving him. The Admiral set up a very large cross in the centre of the square\nof that village, the Indians giving much help; they made prayers and worshipped it, and, from the feeling they show,\nthe Admiral trusted in our Lord that all the people of those islands would become Christians.\nWednesday, 19th of December\nThis night the Admiral got under weigh to leave the gulf formed between the islands of Tortuga and Espa\u00f1ola,\nbut at dawn of day a breeze sprang up from the cast, against which he was unable to get clear of the strait between\nthe two islands during the whole day. At night he was unable to reach a port which was in sight. He made out four\npoints of land, and a great bay with a river, and beyond he saw a large bay, where there was a village, with a valley\nbehind it among high mountains covered with trees, which appeared to be pines. Over the Two Brothers there is a\nvery high mountain-range running N.E. and S.W., and E.S.E. from the Cabo de Torres is a small island to which the\nAdmiral gave the name of Santo Tomas, because to-morrow was his vigil. The whole circuit of this island alternates\nwith capes and excellent harbours, so far as could be judged from the sea. Before coming to the island on the west\nside, there is a cape which runs far into the sea, in part high, the rest low; and for this reason the Admiral named it\nCabo Alto y Bajo. From the road of Torres to E.S.E. 60 miles, there is a mountain higher than any that reaches the\nsea, and from a distance it looks like an island, owing to a depression on the land side. It was named Monte Cari-\nbata, because that province was called Caribata. It is very beautiful, and covered with green trees, without snow or\nclouds. The weather was then, as regards the air and temperature, like March in Castille, and as regards vegetation,\nlike May. The nights lasted 14 hours.\nThursday, 20th of December\nAt sunrise they entered a port between the island of Santo Tomas and the Cabo de Caribata, and anchored. This\nport is very beautiful, and would hold all the ships in Christendom. The entrance appears impossible from the sea\nto those who have never entered, owing to some reefs of rocks which run from the mountainous cape almost to the\nisland. They are not placed in a row, but one here, another there, some towards the sea, others near the land. It is\ntherefore necessary to keep a good look-out for the entrances, which are wide and with a depth of 7 fathoms, so that\nthey can be used without fear. Inside the reefs there is a depth of 12 fathoms. A ship can lie with a cable made fast,\nagainst any wind that blows. At the entrance of this port there is a channel on the west side of a sandy islet with 7\nfathoms, and many trees on its shore. But there are many sunken rocks in that direction, and a look-out should be\nkept up until the port is reached. Afterwards there is no need to fear the greatest storm in the world. From this port\na very beautiful cultivated valley is in sight, descending from the S.E., surrounded by such lofty mountains that they\nappear to reach the sky, and covered with green trees. Without doubt there are mountains here which are higher\nthan the island of Tenerife in the Canaries, which is held to be the highest yet known. On this side of the island of\nSanto Tomas, at a distance of a league, there is another islet, and beyond it another, forming wonderful harbours;\nthough a good look- out must be kept for sunken rocks. The Admiral also saw villages, and smoke made by them.\nFriday, 21st of December\nTo-day the Admiral went with the ship\u2019s boats to examine this port, which he found to be such that it could not\nbe equalled by any he had yet seen; but, having praised the others so much, he knew not how to express himself,\nfearing that he will be looked upon as one who goes beyond the truth. He therefore contents himself with saying\nthat he had old sailors with him who say the same. All the praises he has bestowed on the other ports are true, and\n219 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nthat this is better than any of them is equally true. He further says: \u201cI have traversed the sea for 23 years, without\nleaving it for any time worth counting, and I saw all in the east and the west, going on the route of the north, which\nis England, and I have been to Guinea, but in all those parts there will not be found perfection of harbours. . . .\n.always found. . . . .better than another, that I, with good care, saw written; and I again affirm it was well written,\nthat this one is better than all others, and will hold all the ships of the world, secured with the oldest cables.\u201d From\nthe entrance to the end is a distance of five leagues. The Admiral saw some very well cultivated lands, although they\nare all so, and he sent two of the boat\u2019s crew to the top of a hill to see if any village was near, for none could be seen\nfrom the sea. At about ten o\u2019clock that night, certain Indians came in a canoe to see the Admiral and the Christians,\nand they were given presents, with which they were much pleased. The two men returned, and reported that they\nhad seen a very large village at a short distance from the sea. The Admiral ordered the boat to row towards the place\nwhere the village was until they came near the land, when he saw two Indians, who came to the shore apparently in\na state of fear. So he ordered the boats to stop, and the Indians that were with the Admiral were told to assure the\ntwo natives that no harm whatever was intended to them. Then they came nearer the sea, and the Admiral nearer\nthe land. As soon as the natives had got rid of their fear, so many came that they covered the ground, with women\nand children, giving a thousand thanks. They ran hither and thither to bring us bread made of yams, which they\ncall ajes, which is very white and good, and water in calabashes, and in earthen jars made like those of Spain, and\neverything else they had and that they thought the Admiral could want, and all so willingly and cheerfully that it\nwas wonderful. \u201cIt cannot be said that, because what they gave was worth little, therefore they gave liberally, be-\ncause those who had pieces of gold gave as freely as those who had a calabash of water; and it is easy to know when\na thing is given with a hearty desire to give.\u201d These are the Admiral\u2019s words. \u201cThese people have no spears nor any\nother arms, nor have any of the inhabitants of the whole island, which I believe to be very large. They go naked as\nwhen their mothers bore them, both men and women. In Cuba and the other islands the women wear a small clout\nof cotton in front, as well as the men, as soon as they have passed the age of twelve years, but here neither old nor\nyoung do so. Also, the men in the other islands jealously hide their women from the Christians, but here they do\nnot.\u201d The women have very beautiful bodies, and they were the first to come and give thanks to heaven, and to bring\nwhat they had, especially things to eat, such as bread of ajes (yams), nuts, and four or five kinds of fruits, some of\nwhich the Admiral ordered to be preserved, to be taken to the Sovereigns. He says that the women did not do less\nin other ports before they were hidden; and he always gave orders that none of his people should annoy them; that\nnothing should be taken against their wills, and that everything that was taken should be paid for. Finally, he says\nthat no one could believe that there could be such good-hearted people, so free to give, anxious to let the Christians\nhave all they wanted, and, when visitors arrived, running to bring everything to them.\nAfterwards the Admiral sent six Christians to the village to see what it was like, and the natives showed them all\nthe honour they could devise, and gave them all they had; for no doubt was any longer entertained that the Admiral\nand all his people had come from heaven; and the same was believed by the Indians who were brought from the\nother islands, although they had now been told what they ought to think. When the six Christians had gone, some\ncanoes came with people to ask the Admiral to come to their village when he left the place where he was. Canoa\nis a boat in which they navigate, some large and others small. Seeing that this village of the Chief was on the road,\nand that many people were waiting there for him, the Admiral went there; but, before he could depart, an enor-\nmous crowd came to the shore, men, women, and children, crying out to him not to go, but to stay with them. The\nmessengers from the other Chief, who had come to invite him, were waiting with their canoes, that he might not go\naway, but come to see their Chief, and so he did. On arriving where the Chief was waiting for him with many things\nto eat, he ordered that all the people should sit down, and that the food should be taken to the boats, where the Ad-\nmiral was, on the sea-shore. When he saw that the Admiral had received what he sent, all or most of the Indians ran\nto the village, which was near, to bring more food, parrots, and other things they had, with such frankness of heart\nthat it was marvellous. The Admiral gave them glass beads, brass trinkets, and bells: not because they asked for any-\nthing in return, but because it seemed right, and, above all, because he now looked upon them as future Christians,\nand subjects of the Sovereigns, as much as the people of Castille. He further says that they want nothing except to\nknow the language and be under governance; for all they may be told to do will be done without any contradiction.\nThe Admiral left this place to go to the ships, and the people, men, women, and children, cried out to him not to go,\nbut remain with them. After the boats departed, several canoes full of people followed after them to the ship, who\nwere received with much honour, and given to eat. There had also come before another Chief from the west, and\nmany people even came swimming, the ship being over a good half-league from the shore. I sent certain persons to\nthe Chief, who had gone back, to ask him about these islands. He received them very well, and took them to his vil-\nlage, to give them some large pieces of gold. They arrived at a large river, which the Indians crossed by swimming.\nThe Christians were unable, so they turned back. In all this district there are very high mountains which seem to\nreach the sky, so that the mountain in the island of Tenerife appears as nothing in height and beauty, and they are\nall green with trees. Between them there are very delicious valleys, and at the end of this port, to the south, there\n220 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\nis a valley so large that the end of it is not visible, though no mountains intervene, so that it seems to be 15 or 20\nleagues long. A river flows through it, and it is all inhabited and cultivated and as green as Castille in May or June;\nbut the night contains 14 hours, the land being so far north. This port is very good for all the winds that can blow,\nbeing enclosed and deep, and the shores peopled by a good and gentle race without arms or evil designs. Any ship\nmay lie within it without fear that other ships will enter at night to attack her, because, although the entrance is over\ntwo leagues wide, it is protected by reefs of rocks which are barely awash; and there is only a very narrow channel\nthrough the reef, which looks as if it had been artificially made, leaving an open door by which ships may enter. In\nthe entrance there are 7 fathoms of depth up to the shore of a small flat island, which has a beach fringed with trees.\nThe entrance is on the west side, and a ship can come without fear until she is close to the rock. On the N.W.\nside there are three islands, and a great river a league from the cape on one side of the port. It is the best harbour in\nthe world, and the Admiral gave it the name of Puerto de la mar de Santo Tomas, because to-day it was that Saint\u2019s\nday. The Admiral called it a sea, owing to its size.\nSaturday, 22nd of December\nAt dawn the Admiral made sail to shape a course in search of the islands which the Indians had told him\ncontained much gold, some of them having more gold than earth. But the weather was not favourable, so he an-\nchored again, and sent away the boat to fish with a net. The Lord of that land, who had a place near there, sent a\nlarge canoe full of people, including one of his principal attendants, to invite the Admiral to come with the ships\nto his land, where he would give him all he wanted. The Chief sent, by this servant, a girdle which, instead of a\nbag, had attached to it a mask with two large ears made of beaten gold, the tongue, and the nose. These people are\nvery open-hearted, and whatever they are asked for they give most willingly; while, when they themselves ask for\nanything, they do so as if receiving a great favour. So says the Admiral. They brought the canoe alongside the boat,\nand gave the girdle to a boy; then they came on board with their mission. It took a good part of the day before they\ncould be understood. Not even the Indians who were on board understood them well, because they have some dif-\nferences of words for the names of things. At last their invitation was understood by signs. The Admiral determined\nto start to-morrow, although he did not usually sail on a Sunday, owing to a devout feeling, and not on account of\nany superstition whatever. But in the hope that these people would become Christians through the willingness they\nshow, and that they will be subjects of the Sovereigns of Castille, and because he now holds them to be so, and that\nthey may serve with love, he wished and endeavoured to please them. Before leaving, to-day, the\nAdmiral sent six men to a large village three leagues to the westward, because the Chief had come the day\nbefore and said that he had some pieces of gold. When the Christians arrived, the Secretary of the Admiral, who\nwas one of them, took the Chief by the hand. The Admiral had sent him, to prevent the others from imposing upon\nthe Indians. As the Indians are so simple, and the Spaniards so avaricious and grasping, it does not suffice that the\nIndians should give them all they want in exchange for a bead or a bit of glass, but the Spaniards would take every-\nthing without any return at all. The Admiral always prohibits this, although, with the exception of gold, the things\ngiven by the Indians are of little value. But the Admiral, seeing the simplicity of the Indians, and that they will give a\npiece of gold in exchange for six beads, gave the order that nothing should be received from them unless something\nhad been given in exchange. Thus the Chief took the Secretary by the hand and led him to his house, followed by\nthe whole village, which was very large. He made his guests eat, and the Indians brought them many cotton fabrics,\nand spun-cotton in skeins. In the afternoon the Chief gave them three very fat geese and some small pieces of gold.\nA great number of people went back with them, carrying all the things they had got by barter, and they also carried\nthe Spaniards themselves across streams and muddy places. The Admiral ordered some things to be given to the\nChief, and both he and his people were very well satisfied, truly believing that the Christians had come from heav-\nen, so that they considered themselves fortunate in beholding them. On this day more than 120 canoes came to the\nships, all full of people, and all bringing something, especially their bread and fish, and fresh water in earthen jars.\nThey also brought seeds of good kinds, and there was a grain which they put into a porringer of water and drank it.\nThe Indians who were on board said that this was very wholesome.\nSunday, 23rd of December\nThe Admiral could not go with the ships to that land whither he had been invited by the Chief, because there\nwas no wind. But he sent, with the three messengers who were waiting for the boats, some people, including the\nSecretary. While they were gone, he sent two of the Indians he had on board with him to the villages which were\nnear the anchorage. They returned to the ship with a chief, who brought the news that there was a great quantity\nof gold in that island of Espa\u00f1ola, and that people from other parts came to buy it. They said that here the Admi-\nral would find as much as he wanted. Others came, who confirmed the statement that there was much gold in the\nisland, and explained the way it was collected. The Admiral understood all this with much difficulty; nevertheless,\n221 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nhe concluded that there was a very great quantity in those parts, and that, if he could find the place whence it was\ngot, there would be abundance; and, if not, there would be nothing. He believed there must be a great deal, because,\nduring the three days that he had been in that port, he had got several pieces of gold, and he could not believe that\nit was brought from another land. \u201cOur Lord, who holds all things in his hands, look upon me, and grant what shall\nbe for his service.\u201d These are the Admiral\u2019s words. He says that, according to his reckoning, a thousand people had\nvisited the ship, all of them bringing something. Before they come alongside, at a distance of a crossbow-shot, they\nstand up in the canoe with what they bring in their hands, crying out, \u201cTake it! take it!\u201d He also reckoned that 500\ncame to the ship swimming, because they had no canoes, the ship being near a league from the shore. Among the\nvisitors, five chiefs had come, sons of chiefs, with all their families of wives and children, to see the Christians. The\nAdmiral ordered something to be given to all, because such gifts were all well employed. \u201cMay our Lord favour me\nby his clemency, that I may find this gold, I mean the mine of gold, which I hold to be here, many saying that they\nknow it.\u201d These are his words. The boats arrived at night, and said that there was a grand road as far as they went,\nand they found many canoes, with people who went to see the Admiral and the Christians, at the mountain of Cari-\nbatan. They held it for certain that, if the Christmas festival was kept in that port, all the people of the island would\ncome, which they calculated to be larger than England. All the people went with them to the village which they said\nwas the largest, and the best laid out with streets, of any they had seen. The Admiral says it is part of the Punta Santa,\nalmost three leagues S.E. The canoes go very fast with paddles; so they went ahead to apprise the Cacique, as they\ncall the chief. They also have another greater name\u2014Nitayno; but it was not clear whether they used it for lord, or\ngovernor, or judge. At last the Cacique came to them, and joined them in the square, which was clean-swept, as was\nall the village. The population numbered over 2,000 men. This king did great honour to the people from the ship, and\nevery inhabitant brought them something to eat and drink. Afterwards the king gave each of them cotton cloths such\nas women wear, with parrots for the Admiral, and some pieces of gold. The people also gave cloths and other things\nfrom their houses to the sailors; and as for the trifles they got in return, they seemed to look upon them as relics.\nWhen they wanted to return in the afternoon, he asked them to stay until the next day, and all the people did the\nsame. When they saw that the Spaniards were determined to go, they accompanied them most of the way, carrying\nthe gifts of the Cacique on their backs as far as the boats, which had been left at the mouth of the river.\nMonday, 24th of December\nBefore sunrise the Admiral got under weigh with the land-breeze. Among the numerous Indians who had come\nto the ship yesterday, and had made signs that there was gold in the island, naming the places whence it was col-\nlected, the Admiral noticed one who seemed more fully informed, or who spoke with more willingness, so he asked\nhim to come with the Christians and show them the position of the gold mines. This Indian has a companion or\nrelation with him, and among other places they mentioned where gold was found, they named Cipango, which they\ncalled Civao. Here they said that there was a great quantity of gold, and that the Cacique carried banners of beaten\ngold. But they added that it was very far off to the eastward.\nHere the Admiral addresses the following words to the Sovereigns: \u201cYour Highnesses may believe that there is\nno better nor gentler people in the world. Your Highnesses ought to rejoice that they will soon become Christians,\nand that they will be taught the good customs of your kingdom. A better race there cannot be, and both the people\nand the lands are in such quantity that I know not how to write it. I have spoken in the superlative degree of the\ncountry and people of Juana, which they call Cuba, but there is as much difference between them and this island\nand people as between day and night. I believe that no one who should see them could say less than I have said, and\nI repeat that the things and the great villages of this island of Espa\u00f1ola, which they call Bohio, are wonderful. All\nhere have a loving manner and gentle speech, unlike the others, who seem to be menacing when they speak. Both\nmen and women are of good stature, and not black. It is true that they all paint, some with black, others with other\ncolours, but most with red. I know that they are tanned by the sun, but this does not affect them much. Their hous-\nes and villages are pretty, each with a chief, who acts as their judge, and who is obeyed by them. All these lords use\nfew words, and have excellent manners. Most of their orders are given by a sign with the hand, which is understood\nwith surprising quickness.\u201d All these are the words of the Admiral.\nHe who would enter the sea of Santo Tom\u00e9 ought to stand for a good league across the mouth to a flat island in\nthe middle, which was named La Amiga, pointing her head towards it. When the ship is within a stone\u2019s-throw of it\nthe course should be altered to make for the eastern shore, leaving the west side, and this shore, and not the other,\nshould be kept on board, because a great reef runs out from the west, and even beyond that there are three sunken\nrocks. This reef comes within a lombard-shot of the Amiga island. Between them there are seven fathoms at least,\nwith a gravelly bottom. Within, a harbour will be found large enough for all the ships in the world, which would\nbe there without need of cables. There is another reef, with sunken rocks, on the east side of the island of Amiga,\nwhich are extensive and run out to sea, reaching within two leagues of the cape. But it appeared that between them\n222 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\nthere was an entrance, within two lombard-shots of Amiga, on the west side of Monte Caribatan, where there was a\ngood and very large port.\nTuesday, 25th of December. Christmas\nNavigating yesterday, with little wind, from Santo Tom\u00e9 to Punta Santa, and being a league from it, at about\neleven o\u2019clock at night the Admiral went down to get some sleep, for he had not had any rest for two days and a\nnight. As it was calm, the sailor who steered the ship thought he would go to sleep, leaving the tiller in charge of a\nboy. The Admiral had forbidden this throughout the voyage, whether it was blowing or whether it was calm. The\nboys were never to be entrusted with the helm. The Admiral had no anxiety respecting sand-banks and rocks,\nbecause, when he sent the boats to that king on Sunday, they had passed to the east of Punta Santa at least three\nleagues and a half, and the sailors had seen all the coast, and the rocks there arc from Punta Santa, for a distance\nof three leagues to the E.S.E. They saw the course that should be taken, which had not been the case before, during\nthis voyage. It pleased our Lord that, at twelve o\u2019clock at night, when the Admiral had retired to rest, and when\nall had fallen asleep, seeing that it was a dead calm and the sea like glass, the tiller being in the hands of a boy, the\ncurrent carried the ship on one of the sand-banks. If it had not been night the bank could have been seen, and the\nsurf on it could be heard for a good league. But the ship ran upon it so gently that it could scarcely be felt. The boy,\nwho felt the helm and heard the rush of the sea, cried out. The Admiral at once came up, and so quickly that no one\nhad felt that the ship was aground. Presently the master of the ship, whose watch it was, came on deck. The Admiral\nordered him and others to launch the boat, which was on the poop, and lay out an anchor astern. The master, with\nseveral others, got into the boat, and the Admiral thought that they did so with the object of obeying his orders. But\nthey did so in order to take refuge with the caravel, which was half a league to leeward. The caravel would not allow\nthem to come on board, acting judiciously, and they therefore returned to the ship; but the caravel\u2019s boat arrived\nfirst. When the Admiral saw that his own people fled in this way, the water rising and the ship being across the sea,\nseeing no other course, he ordered the masts to be cut away and the ship to be lightened as much as possible, to see\nif she would come off. But, as the water continued to rise, nothing more could be done. Her side fell over across the\nsea, but it was nearly calm. Then the timbers opened, and the ship was lost. The Admiral went to the caravel to ar-\nrange about the reception of the ship\u2019s crew, and as a light breeze was blowing from the land, and continued during\nthe greater part of the night, while it was unknown how far the bank extended, he hove her to until daylight. He\nthen went back to the ship, inside the reef; first having sent a boat on shore with Diego de Arana of Cordova, Algua-\nzil of the Fleet, and Pedro Gutierrez, Gentleman of the King\u2019s Bed-chamber, to inform the king, who had invited the\nships to come on the previous Saturday. His town was about a league and a half from the sand-bank. They reported\nthat he wept when he heard the news, and he sent all his people with large canoes to unload the ship. This was done,\nand they landed all there was between decks in a very short time. Such was the great promptitude and diligence\nshown by that king. He himself, with brothers and relations, were actively assisting as well in the ship as in the care\nof the property when it was landed, that all might be properly guarded. Now and then he sent one of his relations\nweeping to the Admiral, to console him, saying that he must not feel sorrow or annoyance, for he would supply all\nthat was needed. The Admiral assured the Sovereigns that there could not have been such good watch kept in any\npart of Castille, for that there was not even a needle missing. He ordered that all the property should be placed by\nsome houses which the king placed at his disposal, until they were emptied, when everything would be stowed and\nguarded in them. Armed men were placed round the stores to watch all night. \u201cThe king and all his people wept.\nThey are a loving people, without covetousness, and fit for anything; and I assure your Highnesses that there is no\nbetter land nor people. They love their neighbours as themselves, and their speech is the sweetest and gentlest in the\nworld, and always with a smile. Men and women go as naked as when their mothers bore them. Your Highnesses\nshould believe that they have very good customs among themselves. The king is a man of remarkable presence, and\nwith a certain self-contained manner that is a pleasure to see. They have good memories, wish to see everything,\nand ask the use of what they see.\u201d All this is written by the Admiral.\nWednesday, 26th of December\nTo-day, at sunrise, the king of that land came to the caravel Ni\u00f1a, where the Admiral was, and said to him,\nalmost weeping, that he need not be sorry, for that he would give him all he had; that he had placed two large\nhouses at the disposal of the Christians who were on shore, and that he would give more if they were required, and\nas many canoes as could load from the ship and discharge on shore, with as many people as were wanted. This had\nall been done yesterday, without so much as a needle being missed. \u201cSo honest are they,\u201d says the Admiral, \u201cwithout\nany covetousness for the goods of others, and so above all was that virtuous king.\u201d While the Admiral was talking to\nhim, another canoe arrived from a different place, bringing some pieces of gold, which the people in the canoe\nwanted to exchange for a hawk\u2019s bell; for there was nothing they desired more than these bells. They had scarcely\n223 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ncome alongside when they called and held up the gold, saying Chuq chuq for the bells, for they are quite mad about\nthem. After the king had seen this, and when the canoes which came from other places had departed, he called the\nAdmiral and asked him to give orders that one of the bells was to be kept for another day, when he would bring four\npieces of gold the size of a man\u2019s hand. The Admiral rejoiced to hear this, and afterwards a sailor, who came from\nthe shore, told him that it was wonderful what pieces of gold the men on shore were getting in exchange for next to\nnothing. For a needle they got a piece of gold worth two castellanos and that this was nothing to what it would be\nwithin a month. The king rejoiced much when he saw that the Admiral was pleased. He understood that his friend\nwanted much gold, and he said, by signs, that he knew where there was, in the vicinity, a very large quantity; so that\nhe must be in good heart, for he should have as much as he wanted. He gave some account of it, especially saying\nthat in Cipango, which they call Cibao, it is so abundant that it is of no value, and that they will bring it, although\nthere is also much more in the island of Espa\u00f1ola which they call Bohio, and in the province of Caritaba. The king\ndined on board the caravel with the Admiral and afterwards went on shore, where he received the Admiral with\nmuch honour. He gave him a collation consisting of three or four kinds of yams, with shellfish and game, and other\nviands they have, besides the bread they call cazavi. He then took the Admiral to see some groves of trees near the\nhouses, and they were accompanied by at least a thousand people, all naked. The Lord had on a shirt and a pair of\ngloves, given to him by the Admiral, and he was more delighted with the gloves than with anything else. In his\nmanner of eating, both as regards the high-bred air and the peculiar cleanliness he clearly showed his nobility. After\nhe had eaten, he remained some time at table, and they brought him certain herbs, with which he rubbed his hands.\nThe Admiral thought that this was done to make them soft, and they also gave him water for his hands. After the\nmeal he took the Admiral to the beach. The Admiral then sent for a Turkish bow and a quiver of arrows, and took a\nshot at a man of his company, who had been warned. The chief, who knew nothing about arms, as they neither have\nthem nor use them, thought this a wonderful thing. He, however, began to talk of those of Caniba, whom they call\nCaribes. They come to capture the natives, and have bows and arrows without iron, of which there is no memory in\nany of these lands, nor of steel, nor any other metal except gold and copper. Of copper the Admiral had only seen\nvery little. The Admiral said, by signs, that the Sovereigns of Castille would order the Caribs to be destroyed, and\nthat all should be taken with their heads tied together. He ordered a lombard and a hand-gun to be fired off, and\nseeing the effect caused by its force and what the shots penetrated, the king was astonished. When his people heard\nthe explosion they all fell on the ground. They brought the Admiral a large mask, which had pieces of gold for the\neyes and ears and in other parts, and this they gave, with other trinkets of gold that the same king had put on the\nhead and round the neck of the Admiral, and of other Christians, to whom they also gave many pieces. The Admi-\nral received much pleasure and consolation from these things, which tempered the anxiety and sorrow he felt at the\nloss of the ship. He knew our Lord had caused the ship to stop here, that a settlement might be formed. \u201cFrom this\u201d,\nhe says, \u201coriginated so many things that, in truth, the disaster was really a piece of good fortune. For it is certain\nthat, if I had not lost the ship, I should have gone on without anchoring in this place, which is within a great bay,\nhaving two or three reefs of rock. I should not have left people in the country during this voyage, nor even, if I had\ndesired to leave them, should I have been able to obtain so much information, nor such supplies and provisions for\na fortress. And true it is that many people had asked me to give them leave to remain. Now I have given orders for a\ntower and a fort, both well built, and a large cellar, not because I believe that such defences will be necessary. I\nbelieve that with the force I have with me I could subjugate the whole island, which I believe to be larger than\nPortugal, and the population double. But they are naked and without arms, and hopelessly timid. Still, it is advisable\nto build this tower, being so far from your Highnesses. The people may thus know the skill of the subjects of your\nHighnesses, and what they can do; and will obey them with love and fear. So they make preparations to build the\nfortress, with provision of bread and wine for more than a year, with seeds for sowing, the ship\u2019s boat, a caulker and\ncarpenter, a gunner and cooper. Many among these men have a great desire to serve your Highnesses and to please\nme, by finding out where the mine is whence the gold is brought. Thus everything is got in readiness to begin the\nwork. Above all, it was so calm that there was scarcely wind nor wave when the ship ran aground.\u201d This is what the\nAdmiral says; and he adds more to show that it was great good luck, and the settled design of God, that the ship\nshould be lost in order that people might be left behind. If it had not been for the treachery of the master and his\nboat\u2019s crew, who were all or mostly his countrymen, in neglecting to lay out the anchor so as to haul the ship off in\nobedience to the Admiral\u2019s orders, she would have been saved. In that case, the same knowledge of the land as has\nbeen gained in these days would not have been secured, for the Admiral always proceeded with the object of\ndiscovering, and never intended to stop more than a day at any one place, unless he was detained by the wind. Still,\nthe ship was very heavy and unsuited for discovery. It was the people of Palos who obliged him to take such a ship,\nby not complying \u201cwith what they had promised to the King and Queen, namely, to supply suitable vessels for this\nexpedition. This they did not do. Of all that there was on board the ship, not a needle, nor a board, nor a nail was\nlost, for she remained as whole as when she sailed, except that it was necessary to cut away and level down in order\nto get out the jars and merchandise, which were landed and carefully guarded.\u201d He trusted in God that, when he\n224 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\nreturned from Spain, according to his intention, he would find a ton of gold collected by barter by those he was to\nleave behind, and that they would have found the mine, and spices in such quantities that the Sovereigns would, in\nthree years, be able to undertake and fit out an expedition to go and conquer the Holy Sepulchre. \u201cThus\u201d, he says, \u201cI\nprotest to your Highnesses that all the profits of this my enterprise may be spent in the conquest of Jerusalem. Your\nHighnesses may laugh, and say that it is pleasing to you, and that, without this, you entertain that desire.\u201d These are\nthe Admiral\u2019s words.\nThursday, 27th of December\nThe king of that land came alongside the caravel at sunrise, and said that he had sent for gold, and that he\nwould collect all he could before the Admiral departed; but he begged him not to go. The king and one of his\nbrothers, with another very intimate relation, dined with the Admiral, and the two latter said they wished to go to\nCastille with him. At this time the news came that the caravel Pinta was in a river at the end of this island. Presently\nthe Cacique sent a canoe there, and the Admiral sent a sailor in it. For it was wonderful how devoted the Cacique\nwas to the Admiral. The necessity was now evident of hurrying on preparations for the return to Castille.\nFriday, 28th of December\nThe Admiral went on shore to give orders and hurry on the work of building the fort, and to settle what men\nshould remain behind. The king, it would seem, had watched him getting into the boat, and quickly went into his\nhouse, dissimulating, sending one of his brothers to receive the Admiral, and conduct him to one of the houses that\nhad been set aside for the Spaniards, which was the largest and best in the town. In it there was a couch made of palm\nmatting, where they sat down. Afterwards the brother sent an attendant to say that the Admiral was there, as if the\nking did not know that he had come. The Admiral, however, believed that this was a feint in order to do him more\nhonour. The attendant gave the message, and the Cacique came in great haste, and put a large soft piece of gold he had\nin his hand round the Admiral\u2019s neck. They remained together until the evening, arranging what had to be done.\nSaturday, 29th of December\nA very youthful nephew of the king came to the caravel at sunrise, who showed a good understanding and dis-\nposition. As the Admiral was always working to find out the origin of the gold, he asked everyone, for he could now\nunderstand somewhat by signs. This youth told him that, at a distance of four days\u2019 journey, there was an island to\nthe eastward called Guarionex, and others called Macorix, Mayonic, Fuma, Cibao, and Coroay, in which there was\nplenty of gold. The Admiral wrote these names down, and now understood what had been said by a brother of the\nking, who was annoyed with him, as the Admiral understood. At other times the Admiral had suspected that the\nking had worked against his knowing where the gold had its origin and was collected, that he might not go away to\nbarter in another part of the island. For there are such a number of places in this same island that it is wonderful.\nAfter nightfall the king sent a large mask of gold, and asked for a washhand basin and jug. The Admiral thought he\nwanted them for patterns to copy from, and therefore sent them.\nSunday, 30th of December\nThe Admiral went on shore to dinner, and came at a time when five kings had arrived, all with their crowns,\nwho were subject to this king, named Guacanagari. They represented a very good state of affairs, and the Admiral\nsays to the Sovereigns that it would have given them pleasure to see the manner of their arrival. On landing, the\nAdmiral was received by the king, who led him by the arms to the same house where he was yesterday, where there\nwere chairs, and a couch on which the Admiral sat. Presently the king took the crown off his head and put it on the\nAdmiral\u2019s head, and the Admiral took from his neck a collar of beautiful beads of several different colours, which\nlooked very well in all its parts, and put it on the king. He also took off a cloak of fine material, in which he had\ndressed himself that day, and dressed the king in it, and sent for some coloured boots, which he put on his feet, and\nhe put a large silver ring on his finger, because he had heard that he had admired greatly a silver ornament worn\nby one of the sailors. The king was highly delighted and well satisfied, and two of those kings who were with him\ncame with him to where the Admiral was, and each gave him a large piece of gold. At this time an Indian came and\nreported that it was two days since he left the caravel Pinta in a port to the eastward. The Admiral returned to the\ncaravel, and Vicente Anes, the captain, said that he had seen the rhubarb plant, and that they had it on the island\nAmiga, which is at the entrance of the sea of Santo Tom\u00e9, six leagues off, and that he had recognised the branches\nand roots. They say that rhubarb forms small branches above ground, and fruit like green mulberries, almost dry,\nand the stalk, near the root, is as yellow and delicate as the best colour for painting, and underground the root\ngrows like a large pear.\n225 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nMonday, 31st of December\nTo-day the Admiral was occupied in seeing that water and fuel were taken on board for the voyage to Spain, to\ngive early notice to the Sovereigns, that they might despatch ships to complete the discoveries. For now the business\nappeared to be so great and important that the Admiral was astonished. He did not wish to go until he had exam-\nined all the land to the eastward, and explored the coast, so as to know the route to Castille, with a view to sending\nsheep and cattle. But as he had been left with only a single vessel, it did not appear prudent to encounter the dan-\ngers that are inevitable in making discoveries. He complained that all this inconvenience had been caused by the\ncaravel Pinta having parted company.\nTuesday, 1st of January 1493\nAt midnight the Admiral sent a boat to the island Amiga to bring the rhubarb. It returned at vespers with a\nbundle of it. They did not bring more because they had no spade to dig it up with; it was taken to be shown to the\nSovereigns. The king of that land said that he had sent many canoes for gold. The canoe returned that had been sent\nfor tidings of the Pinta, without having found her. The sailor who went in the canoe said that twenty leagues from\nthere he had seen a king who wore two large plates of gold on his head, but when the Indians in the canoe spoke to\nhim he took them off. He also saw much gold on other people. The Admiral considered that the King Guacanagari\nought to have prohibited his people from selling gold to the Christians, in order that it might all pass through his\nhands. But the king knew the places, as before stated, where there was such a quantity that it was not valued. The\nspicery also is extensive, and is worth more than pepper or manegueta. He left instructions to those who wished to\nremain that they were to collect as much as they could.\nWednesday, 2nd of January\nIn the morning the Admiral went on shore to take leave of the King Guacanagari, and to depart from him in\nthe name of the Lord. He gave him one of his shirts. In order to show him the force of the lombards, and what effect\nthey had, he ordered one to be loaded and fired into the side of the ship that was on shore, for this was apposite to\nthe conversation respecting the Caribs, with whom Guacanagari was at war. The king saw whence the lombard-shot\ncame, and how it passed through the side of the ship and went far away over the sea. The Admiral also ordered a\nskirmish of the crews of the ships, fully armed, saying to the Cacique that he need have no fear of the Caribs even if\nthey should come. All this was done that the king might look upon the men who were left behind as friends, and that\nhe might also have a proper fear of them. The king took the Admiral to dinner at the house where he was established,\nand the others who came with him. The Admiral strongly recommended to his friendship Diego de Arana, Pedro\nGutierrez, and Rodrigo Escovedo, whom he left jointly as his lieutenants over the people who remained behind, that\nall might be well regulated and governed for the service of their Highnesses. The Cacique showed much love for the\nAdmiral, and great sorrow at his departure, especially when he saw him go on board. A relation of that king said to\nthe Admiral that he had ordered a statue of pure gold to be made, as big as the Admiral, and that it would be brought\nwithin ten days. The Admiral embarked with the intention of sailing presently, but there was no wind.\nHe left on that island of Espa\u00f1ola, which the Indians called Bohio, 39 men with the fortress, and he says that\nthey were great friends of Guacanagari. The lieutenants placed over them were Diego de Arana of Cordova, Pedro\nGutierrez, Gentleman of the King\u2019s Bedchamber, and Rodrigo de Escovedo, a native of Seogvia, nephew of Fray Ro-\ndrigo Perez, with all the powers he himself received from the Sovereigns. He left behind all the merchandise which\nhad been provided for bartering, which was much, that they might trade for gold. He also left bread for a year\u2019s sup-\nply, wine, and much artillery. He also left the ship\u2019s boat, that they, most of them being sailors, might go, when the\ntime seemed convenient, to discover the gold mine, in order that the Admiral, on his return, might find much gold.\nThey were also to find a good site for a town, for this was not altogether a desirable port; especially as the gold the\nnatives brought came from the east; also, the farther to the east the nearer to Spain. He also left seeds for sowing,\nand his officers, the Alguazil and Secretary, as well as a ship\u2019s carpenter, a caulker, a good gunner well acquainted\nwith artillery, a cooper, a physician, and a tailor, all being seamen as well.\nThursday, 3rd of January\nThe Admiral did not go to-day, because three of the Indians whom he had brought from the islands, and who\nhad staid behind, arrived, and said that the others with their women would be there at sunrise. The sea also was\nrather rough, so that they could not land from the boat. He determined to depart to-morrow, with the grace of God.\nThe Admiral said that if he had the caravel Pinta with him he could make sure of shipping a ton of gold, because he\ncould then follow the coasts of these islands, which he would not do alone, for fear some accident might impede his\nreturn to Castille, and prevent him from reporting all he had discovered to the Sovereigns. If it was certain that the\n226 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\ncaravel Pinta would arrive safely in Spain with Martin Alonso Pinzon, he would not hesitate to act as he desired; but\nas he had no certain tidings of him, and as he might return and tell lies to the Sovereigns, that he might not receive\nthe punishment he deserved for having done so much harm in having parted company without permission, and\nimpeded the good service that might have been done; the Admiral could only trust in our Lord that he would grant\nfavourable weather, and remedy all things.\nFriday, 4th of January\nAt sunrise the Admiral weighed the anchor, with little wind, and turned her head N.W. to get clear of the reef,\nby another channel wider than the one by which he entered, which, with others, is very good for coming in front of\nthe Villa de la Navidad, in all which the least depth is from 3 to 9 fathoms. These two channels run N.W. and S.E.,\nand the reefs are long, extending from the Cabo Santo to the Cabo de Sierpe for more than six leagues, and then\na good three leagues out to sea. At a league outside Cabo Santo there arc not more than 8 fathoms of depth, and\ninside that cape, on the east side, there are many sunken rocks, and channels to enter between them. All this coast\ntrends N.W. and S.E., and it is all beach, with the land very level for about a quarter of a league inland. After that\ndistance there are very high mountains, and the whole is peopled with a very good race, as they showed themselves\nto the Christians. Thus the Admiral navigated to the east, shaping a course for a very high mountain, which looked\nlike an island, but is not one, being joined to the mainland by a very low neck. The mountain has the shape of a very\nbeautiful tent. He gave it the name of Monte Cristi. It is due east of Cabo Santo, at a distance of 18 leagues. That\nday, owing to the light wind, they could not reach within six leagues of Monte Cristi. He discovered four very low\nand sandy islets, with a reef extending N.W. and S.E. Inside, there is a large gulf, which extends from this mountain\nto the S.E. at least twenty leagues, which must all be shallow, with many sand-banks, and inside numerous rivers\nwhich are not navigable. At the same time the sailor who was sent in the canoe to get tidings of the Pinta reported\nthat he saw a river into which ships might enter. The Admiral anchored at a distance of six leagues from Monte\nCristi, in 19 fathoms, and so kept clear of many rocks and reefs. Here he remained for the night. The Admiral gives\nnotice to those who would go to the Villa de la Navidad that, to make Monte Cristi, he should stand off the land two\nleagues, etc. (But as the coast is now known it is not given here.) The Admiral concluded that Cipango was in that\nisland, and that it contained much gold, spices, mastick, and rhubarb.\nSaturday, 5th of January\nAt sunrise the Admiral made sail with the land-breeze, and saw that to the S.S.E. of Monte Cristi, between it and\nan island, there seemed to be a good port to anchor in that night. He shaped an E.S.E. course, afterwards S.S.E., for six\nleagues round the high land, and found a depth of 17 fathoms, with a very clean bottom, going on for three leagues\nwith the same soundings. Afterwards it shallowed to 12 fathoms up to the morro of the mountain, and off the morro,\nat one league, the depth of 9 fathoms was found, the bottom clean, and all fine sand. The Admiral followed the same\ncourse until he came between the mountain and the island, where he found 3 1\/2 fathoms at low water, a very good\nport, and here he anchored. He went in the boat to the islet, where he found remains of fire and footmarks, showing\nthat fishermen had been there. Here they saw many stones painted in colours, or a quarry of such stones, very beau-\ntifully worked by nature, suited for the building of a church or other public work, like those he found on the island of\nSan Salvador. On this islet he also found many plants of mastick. He says that this Monte Cristi is very fine and high,\nbut accessible, and of a very beautiful shape, all the land round it being low, a very fine plain, from which the height\nrises, looking at a distance like an island disunited from other land. Beyond the mountain, to the east, he saw a cape\nat a distance of 24 miles, which he named Cabo del Becerro whence to the mountain for two leagues there are reefs\nof rocks, though it appeared as if there were navigable channels between them. It would, however, be advisable to\napproach in daylight, and to send a boat ahead to sound. From the mountain eastward to Cabo del Becerro, for four\nleagues, there is a beach, and the land is low, but the rest is very high, with beautiful mountains and some cultivation.\nInland, a chain of mountains runs N.E. and S.W., the most beautiful he had seen, appearing like the hills of Cordova.\nSome other very lofty mountains appear in the distance towards the south and S.E., and very extensive green valleys\nwith large rivers: all this in such quantity that he did not believe he had exaggerated a thousandth part. Afterwards he\nsaw, to the eastward of the mountain, a land which appeared like that of Monte Cristi in size and beauty. Further to the\neast and N.E. there is land which is not so high, extending for some hundred miles or near it.\nSunday, 6th of January\nThat port is sheltered from all winds, except north and N.W., and these winds seldom blow in this region. Even\nwhen the wind is from those quarters, shelter may be found near the islet in 3 or 4 fathoms. At sunset the Admi-\nral made sail to proceed along the coast, the course being cast, except that it is necessary to look out for several\n227 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nreefs of stone and sand, within which there are good anchorages, with channels leading to them. After noon it\nblew fresh from the east. The Admiral ordered a sailor to go to the mast-head to look out for reefs, and he saw the\ncaravel Pinta coming, with the wind aft, and she joined the Admiral. As there was no place to anchor, owing to the\nrocky bottom, the Admiral returned for ten leagues to Monte Cristi, with the Pinta in company. Martin Alonso\nPinzon came on board the caravel Ni\u00f1a where the Admiral was, and excused himself by saying that he had parted\ncompany against his will, giving reasons for it. But the Admiral says that they were all false; and that on the night\nwhen Pinzon parted company he was influenced by pride and covetousness. He could not understand whence had\ncome the insolence and disloyalty with which Pinzon had treated him during the voyage. The Admiral had taken\nno notice, because he did not wish to give place to the evil works of Satan, who desired to impede the voyage. It\nappeared that one of the Indians, who had been put on board the caravel by the Admiral with others, had said that\nthere was much gold in an island called Baneque, and, as Pinzon\u2019s vessel was light and swift, he determined to go\nthere, parting company with the Admiral, who wished to remain and explore the coasts of Juana and Espanola, with\nan easterly course. When Martin Alonso arrived at the island of Baneque he found no gold. He then went to the\ncoast of Espa\u00f1ola, on information from the Indians that there was a great quantity of gold and many mines in that\nisland of Espa\u00f1ola, which the Indians call Bohio. He thus arrived near the Villa de Navidad about 15 leagues from\nit, having then been absent more than twenty days, so that the news brought by the Indians was correct, on account\nof which the King Guacanagari sent a canoe, and the Admiral put a sailor on board; but the Pinta must have gone\nbefore the canoe arrived. The Admiral says that the Pinta obtained much gold by barter, receiving large pieces the\nsize of two fingers in exchange for a needle. Martin Alonso took half, dividing the other half among the crew. The\nAdmiral then says: \u201cThus I am convinced that our Lord miraculously caused that vessel to remain here, this being\nthe best place in the whole island to form a settlement, and the nearest to the gold mines.\u201d He also says that he knew\n\u201cof another great island, to the south of the island of Juana, in which there is more gold than in this island, so that\nthey collect it in bits the size of beans, while in Espa\u00f1ola they find the pieces the size of grains of corn. They call\nthat island Yamaye. The Admiral also heard of an island further east, in which there were only women, having been\ntold this by many people. He was also informed that Yamaye and the island of Espa\u00f1ola were ten days\u2019 journey in a\ncanoe from the mainland, which would be about 70 or 80 leagues, and that there the people wore clothes.\nMonday, 7th of January\nThis day the Admiral took the opportunity of caulking the caravel, and the sailors were sent to cut wood. They\nfound mastick and aloes in abundance.\nTuesday, 8th of January\nAs the wind was blowing fresh from the east and S.E., the Admiral did not get under weigh this morning. He\nordered the caravel to be filled up with wood and water and with all other necessaries for the voyage. He wished to\nexplore all the coast of Espa\u00f1ola in this direction. But those he appointed to the caravels as captains were brothers,\nnamely, Martin Alonso Pinzon and Vicente Anes. They also had followers who were filled with pride and avarice,\nconsidering that all now belonged to them, and unmindful of the honour the Admiral had done them. They had not\nand did not obey his orders, but did and said many unworthy things against him; while Martin Alonso had deserted\nhim from the 21st of November until the 6th of January without cause or reason, but from disaffection. All these\nthings had been endured in silence by the Admiral in order to secure a good end to the voyage. He determined to\nreturn as quickly as possible, to get rid of such an evil company, with whom he thought it necessary to dissimulate,\nalthough they were a mutinous set, and though he also had with him many good men; for it was not a fitting time\nfor dealing out punishment.\nThe Admiral got into the boat and went up the river which is near, towards the S.S.W. of Monte Cristi, a good\nleague. This is where the sailors went to get fresh water for the ships. He found that the sand at the mouth of the\nriver, which is very large and deep, was full of very fine gold, and in astonishing quantity. The Admiral thought that\nit was pulverized in the drift down the river, but in a short time he found many grains as large as horse-beans, while\nthere was a great deal of the fine powder.\nAs the fresh water mixed with the salt when it entered the sea, he ordered the boat to go up for the distance of\na stone\u2019s-throw. They filled the casks from the boat, and when they went back to the caravel they found small bits\nof gold sticking to the hoops of the casks and of the barrel. The Admiral gave the name of Rio del Oro to the river.\nInside the bar it is very deep, though the mouth is shallow and very wide. The distance to the Villa de la Navidad is\n17 leagues, and there are several large rivers on the intervening coast, especially three which probably contain much\nmore gold than this one, because they are larger. This river is nearly the size of the Guadalquivir at Cordova, and\nfrom it to the gold mines the distance is not more than 20 leagues. The Admiral further says that he did not care to\ntake the sand containing gold, because their Highnesses would have it all as their property at their town of Navidad;\n228 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\nand because his first object was now to bring the news and to get rid of the evil company that was with him, whom\nhe had always said were a mutinous set.\nWednesday, 9th of January\nThe Admiral made sail at midnight, with the wind S.E., and shaped an E.N.E. course, arriving at a point named\nPunta Roja, which is 60 miles east of Monte Cristi, and anchored under its lee three hours before nightfall. He did\nnot venture to go out at night, because there are many reefs, until they are known. Afterwards, if, as will probably be\nthe case, channels are found between them, the anchorage, which is good and well sheltered, will be profitable. The\ncountry between Monte Cristi and this point where the Admiral anchored is very high land, with beautiful plains,\nthe range running east and west, all green and cultivated, with numerous streams of water, so that it is wonderful to\nsee such beauty. In all this country there are many turtles, and the sailors took several when they came on shore to\nlay their eggs at Monte Cristi as large as a great wooden buckler.\nOn the previous day, when the Admiral went to the Rio del Oro he saw three mermaids, which rose well out of\nthe sea; but they are not so beautiful as they are painted, though to some extent they have the form of a human face.\nThe Admiral says that he had seen some, at other times, in Guinea, on the coast of the Manequeta.\nThe Admiral says that this night, in the name of our Lord, he would set out on his homeward voyage without\nany further delay whatever, for he had found what he sought, and he did not wish to have further cause of offence\nwith Martin Alonso until their Highnesses should know the news of the voyage and what had been done. After-\nwards he says, \u201cI will not suffer the deeds of evil-disposed persons, with little worth, who, without respect for him\nto whom they owe their positions, presume to set up their own wills with little ceremony.\u201d\nThursday, 10th of January\nHe departed from the place where he had anchored, and at sunset he reached a river, to which he gave the\nname of Rio de Gracia, three leagues to the S.E. He came to at the mouth, where there is good anchorage on the\neast side. There is a bar with no more than two fathoms of water, and very narrow across the entrance. It is a good\nand well-sheltered port, except that there it is often misty, owing to which the caravel Pinta, under Martin Alonso,\nreceived a good deal of damage. He had been here bartering for 16 days, and got much gold, which was what Mar-\ntin Alonso wanted. As soon as he heard from the Indians that the Admiral was on the coast of the same island of\nEspa\u00f1ola, and that he could not avoid him, Pinzon came to him. He wanted all the people of the ship to swear that\nhe had not been there more than six days. But his treachery was so public that it could not be concealed. He had\nmade a law that half of all the gold that was collected was his. When he left this port he took four men and two girls\nby force. But the Admiral ordered that they should be clothed and put on shore to return to their homes. \u201cThis\u201d, the\nAdmiral says, \u201cis a service of your Highnesses. For all the men and women are subjects of your Highnesses, as well\nin this island as in the others. Here, where your Highnesses already have a settlement, the people ought to be treat-\ned with honour and favour, seeing that this island has so much gold and such good spice-yielding lands.\u201d\nFriday, 11th of January\nAt midnight the Admiral left the Rio de Gracia with the land-breeze, and steered eastward until he came to a\ncape named Belprado, at a distance of four leagues. To the S.E. is the mountain to which he gave the name of Monte\nde Plata, eight leagues distant. Thence from the cape Belprado to E.S.E. is the point named Angel, eighteen leagues\ndistant; and from this point to the Monte de Plata there is a gulf, with the most beautiful lands in the world, all\nhigh and fine lands which extend far inland. Beyond there is a range of high mountains running east and west, very\ngrand and beautiful. At the foot of this mountain there is a very good port, with 14 fathoms in the entrance. The\nmountain is very high and beautiful, and all the country is well peopled. The Admiral believed there must be fine\nrivers and much gold. At a distance of 4 leagues E.S.E. of Cabo del Angel there is a cape named Punta del Hierro,\nand on the same course, 4 more leagues, a point is reached named Punta Seca. Thence, 6 leagues further on, is Cabo\nRedondo, and further on Cabo Frances, where a large bay is formed, but there did not appear to be anchorage in\nit. A league further on is Cabo del Buen Tiempo, and thence, a good league S.S.E., is Cabo Tajado. Thence, to the\nsouth, another cape was sighted at a distance of about 15 leagues. To-day great progress was made, as wind and tide\nwere favourable. The Admiral did not venture to anchor for fear of the rocks, so he was hove-to all night.\nSaturday, 12th of January\nTowards dawn the Admiral filled and shaped a course to the east with a fresh wind, running 20 miles before\ndaylight, and in two hours afterwards 24 miles. Thence he saw land to the south, and steered towards it, distant 48\nmiles. During the night he must have run 28 miles N.N.E., to keep the vessels out of danger. When he saw the land,\n229 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nhe named one cape that he saw Cabo de Padre y Hijo, because at the east point there are two rocks, one larger than\nthe other. Afterwards, at two leagues to the eastward, he saw a very fine bay between two grand mountains. He saw\nthat it was a very large port with a very good approach; but, as it was very early in the morning, and as the great-\ner part of the time it was blowing from the east, and then they had a N.N.W. breeze, he did not wish to delay any\nmore. He continued his course to the east as far as a very high and beautiful cape, all of scarped rock, to which he\ngave the name of Cabo del Enamorado, which was 32 miles to the east of the port named Puerto Sacro. On round-\ning the cape, another finer and loftier point came in sight, like Cape St. Vincent in Portugal, 12 miles east of Cabo\ndel Enamorado. As soon as he was abreast of the Cabo del Enamorado, the Admiral saw that there was a great bay\nbetween this and the next point, three leagues across, and in the middle of it a small island. The depth is great at\nthe entrance close to the land. He anchored here in twelve fathoms, and sent the boat on shore for water, and to see\nif intercourse could be opened with the natives, but they all fled. He also anchored to ascertain whether this was\nall one land with the island of Espa\u00f1ola, and to make sure that this was a gulf, and not a channel, forming another\nisland. He remained astonished at the great size of Espa\u00f1ola.\nSunday, 13th of January\nThe Admiral did not leave the port, because there was no land-breeze with which to go out. He wished to shift\nto another better port, because this was rather exposed. He also wanted to wait, in that haven, the conjunction of\nthe sun and moon, which would take place on the 17th of this month, and their opposition with Jupiter and con-\njunction with Mercury, the sun being in opposition to Jupiter, which is the cause of high winds. He sent the boat on\nshore to a beautiful beach to obtain yams for food. They found some men with bows and arrows, with whom they\nstopped to speak, buying two bows and many arrows from them. They asked one of them to come on board the car-\navel and see the Admiral; who says that he was very wanting in reverence, more so than any native he had yet seen.\nHis face was all stained with charcoal, but in all parts there is the custom of painting the body different colours. He\nwore his hair very long, brought together and fastened behind, and put into a small net of parrots\u2019 feathers. He was\nnaked, like all the others. The Admiral supposed that he belonged to the Caribs, who eat men, and that the gulf he\nhad seen yesterday formed this part of the land into an island by itself. The Admiral asked about the Caribs, and he\npointed to the east, near at hand, which means that he saw the Admiral yesterday before he entered the bay. The In-\ndian said there was much gold to the east, pointing to the poop of the caravel, which was a good size, meaning that\nthere were pieces as large. He called gold tuob, and did not understand caona, as they call it in the first part of the\nisland that was visited, nor nozay, the name in San Salvador and the other islands. Copper is called tuob in Espa\u00f1o-\nla. He also spoke of the island of Goanin where there was much tuob. The Admiral says that he had received notices\nof these islands from many persons; that in the other islands the natives were in great fear of the Caribs, called by\nsome of them Caniba, but in Espa\u00f1ola Carib. He thought they must be an audacious race, for they go to all these\nislands and eat the people they can capture. He understood a few words, and the Indians who were on board com-\nprehended more, there being a difference in the languages owing to the great distance between the various islands.\nThe Admiral ordered that the Indian should be fed, and given pieces of green and red cloth, and glass beads, which\nthey like very much, and then sent on shore. He was told to bring gold if he had any, and it was believed that he had,\nfrom some small things he brought with him. When the boat reached the shore there were fifty-five men behind the\ntrees, naked, and with very long hair, as the women wear it in Castille. Behind the head they wore plumes of feath-\ners of parrots and other birds, and each man carried a bow. The Indian landed, and signed to the others to put down\ntheir bows and arrows, and a piece of a staff, which is like. . . . .very heavy, carried instead of a sword. As soon as\nthey came to the boat the crew landed, and began to buy the bows and arrows and other arms, in accordance with\nan order of the Admiral. Having sold two bows, they did not want to give more, but began to attack the Spaniards,\nand to take hold of them. They were running back to pick up their bows and arrows where they had laid them aside,\nand took cords in their hands to bind the boat\u2019s crew. Seeing them rushing down, and being prepared\u2014for the\nAdmiral always warned them to be on their guard\u2014the Spaniards attacked the Indians, and gave one a stab with\na knife in the buttocks, wounding another in the breast with an arrow. Seeing that they could gain little, although\nthe Christians were only seven and they numbered over fifty, they fled, so that none were left, throwing bows and\narrows away. The Christians would have killed many, if the pilot, who was in command, had not prevented them.\nThe Spaniards presently returned to the caravel with the boat. The Admiral regretted the affair for one reason, and\nwas pleased for another. They would have fear of the Christians, and they were no doubt an ill-conditioned people,\nprobably Caribs, who eat men. But the Admiral felt alarm lest they should do some harm to the 39 men left in the\nfortress and town of Navidad, in the event of their coming here in their boat. Even if they are not Caribs, they are a\nneighbouring people, with similar habits, and fearless, unlike the other inhabitants of the island, who are timid, and\nwithout arms. The Admiral says all this, and adds that he would have liked to have captured some of them. He says\nthat they lighted many smoke signals, as is the custom in this island of Espa\u00f1ola.\n230 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\nMonday, 14th of January\nThis evening the Admiral wished to find the houses of the Indians and to capture some of them, believing them\nto be Caribs. For, owing to the strong east and north-east winds and the heavy sea, he had remained during the\nday. Many Indians were seen on shore. The Admiral, therefore, ordered the boat to be sent on shore, with the crew\nwell armed. Presently the Indians came to the stern of the boat, including the man who had been on board the day\nbefore, and had received presents from the Admiral. With him there came a king, who had given to the said Indian\nsome beads in token of safety and peace for the boat\u2019s crew. This king, with three of his followers, went on board the\nboat and came to the caravel. The Admiral ordered them to be given biscuit and treacle to eat, and gave the chief a\nred cap, some beads, and a piece of red cloth. The others were also given pieces of cloth. The chief said that next day\nhe would bring a mask made of gold, affirming that there was much here, and in Carib and Matinino. They after-\nwards went on shore well satisfied.\nThe Admiral here says that the caravels were making much water, which entered by the keel; and he complains of\nthe caulkers at Palos, who caulked the vessels very badly, and ran away when they saw that the Admiral had detected\nthe badness of their work, and intended to oblige them to repair the defect. But, notwithstanding that the caravels were\nmaking much water, he trusted in the favour and mercy of our Lord, for his high Majesty well knew how much contro-\nversy there was before the expedition could be despatched from Castille, that no one was in the Admiral\u2019s favour save\nHim alone who knew his heart, and after God came your Highnesses, while all others were against him without any\nreason. He further says: \u201cAnd this has been the cause that the royal crown of your Highnesses has not a hundred cuen-\ntos of revenue more than after I entered your service, which is seven years ago in this very month, the 20th of January.\nThe increase will take place from now onwards. For the almighty God will remedy all things.\u201d These are his words.\nTuesday, 15th of January\nThe Admiral now wished to depart, for there was nothing to be gained by further delay, after these occurrences\nand the tumult with the Indians. To-day he had heard that all the gold was in the district of the town of Navidad,\nbelonging to their Highnesses; and that in the island of Carib there was much copper, as well as in Matinino. The in-\ntercourse at Carib would, however, be difficult, because the natives are said to eat human flesh. Their island would be\nin sight from thence, and the Admiral determined to go there, as it was on the route, and thence to Matinino, which\nwas said to be entirely peopled by women, without men. He would thus see both islands, and might take some of the\nnatives. The Admiral sent the boat on shore, but the king of that district had not come, for his village was distant.\nHe, however, sent his crown of gold, as he had promised; and many other natives came with cotton, and bread made\nfrom yams, all with their bows and arrows. After the bartering was finished, four youths came to the caravel. They\nappeared to the Admiral to give such a clear account of the islands to the eastward, on the same route as the Admiral\nwould have to take, that he determined to take them to Castille with him. He says that they had no iron nor other\nmetals; at least none was seen, but it was impossible to know much of the land in so short a time, owing to the diffi-\nculty with the language, which the Admiral could not understand except by guessing, nor could they know what was\nsaid to them, in such a few days. The bows of these people are as large as those of France or England. The arrows are\nsimilar to the darts of the natives who have been met with previously, which are made of young canes, which grow\nvery straight, and a vara and a half or two varas in length. They point them with a piece of sharp wood, a palmo and a\nhalf long, and at the end some of them fix a fish\u2019s tooth, but most of them anoint it with an herb. They do not shoot as\nin other parts, but in a certain way which cannot do much harm. Here they have a great deal of fine and long cotton,\nand plenty of mastick. The bows appeared to be of yew, and there is gold and copper. There is also plenty of aji, which\nis their pepper, which is more valuable than pepper, and all the people cat nothing else, it being very wholesome.\nFifty caravels might be annually loaded with it from Espa\u00f1ola. The Admiral says that he found a great deal of weed\nin this bay, the same as was met with at sea when he came on this discovery. He therefore supposed that there were\nislands to the eastward, in the direction of the position where he began to meet with it; for he considers it certain\nthat this weed has its origin in shallow water near the land, and, if this is the case, these Indies must be very near the\nCanary Islands. For this reason he thought the distance must be less than 400 leagues.\nWednesday, 16th of January\nThey got under weigh three hours before daylight, and left the gulf, which was named Golfo de las Flechas with\nthe land-breeze. Afterwards there was a west wind, which was fair to go to the island of Carib on an E.N.E. course.\nThis was where the people live of whom all the natives of the other islands are so frightened, because they roam\nover the sea in canoes without number, and eat the men they can capture. The Admiral steered the course indicated\nby one of the four Indians he took yesterday in the Puerto de las Flechas. After having sailed about 64 miles, the\nIndians made signs that the island was to the S.E. The Admiral ordered the sails to be trimmed for that course, but,\n231 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nafter having proceeded on it for two leagues, the wind freshened from a quarter which was very favourable for the\nvoyage to Spain. The Admiral had noticed that the crew were downhearted when he deviated from the direct route\nhome, reflecting that both caravels were leaking badly, and that there was no help but in God. He therefore gave\nup the course leading to the islands, and shaped a direct course for Spain E.N.E. He sailed on this course, making\n48 miles, which is 12 leagues, by sunset. The Indians said that by that route they would fall in with the island of\nMatinino, peopled entirely by women without men, and the Admiral wanted very much to take five or six of them\nto the Sovereigns. But he doubted whether the Indians understood the route well, and he could not afford to delay,\nby reason of the leaky condition of the caravels. He, however, believed the story, and that, at certain seasons, men\ncame to them from the island of Carib, distant ten or twelve leagues. If males were born, they were sent to the island\nof the men; and if females, they remained with their mothers. The Admiral says that these two islands cannot have\nbeen more than 1 5 or 20 leagues to the S.E. from where he altered course, the Indians not understanding how to\npoint out the direction. After losing sight of the cape, which was named San Theramo, which was left 16 leagues to\nthe west, they went for 12 leagues E.N.E. The weather was very fine.\nThursday, 17th of January\nThe wind went down at sunset yesterday, the caravels having sailed 14 glasses, each a little less than half-an-\nhour, at 4 miles an hour, making 28 miles. Afterwards the wind freshened, and they ran all that watch, which was\n10 glasses. Then another six until sunrise at 8 miles an hour, thus making altogether 84 miles, equal to 21 leagues,\nto the E.N.E., and until sunset 44 miles, or 11 leagues, to the east. Here a booby came to the caravel, and afterwards\nanother. The Admiral saw a great deal of gulf-weed.\nFriday, 18th of January\nDuring the night they steered E.S.E., with little wind, for 40 miles, equal to 10 leagues, and then 30 miles, or 7\n1\/2 leagues, until sunrise. All day they proceeded with little wind to E.N.E. and N.E. by E., more or less, her head\nbeing sometimes north and at others N.N.E., and, counting one with the other, they made 60 miles, or 15 leagues.\nThere was little weed, but yesterday and to-day the sea appeared to be full of tunnies. The Admiral believed that\nthey were on their way to the tunny-fisheries of the Duke, at Conil and C\u00e1diz. He also thought they were near some\nislands, because a frigate-bird flew round the caravel, and afterwards went away to the S.S.E. He said that to the S.E.\nof the island of Espa\u00f1ola were the islands of Carib, Matinino, and many others.\nSaturday, 19th of January\nDuring the night they made good 56 miles N.N.E., and 64 N.E. by N. After sunrise they steered N.E. with the\nwind fresh from S.W., and afterwards W.S.W. 84 miles, equal to 21 leagues. The sea was again full of small tunnies.\nThere were boobies, frigate-birds, and terns.\nSunday, 20th of January\nIt was calm during the night, with occasional slants of wind, and they only made 20 miles to the N.E. After\nsunrise they went 11 miles S.E., and then 36 miles N.N.E., equal to 9 leagues. They saw an immense quantity of\nsmall tunnies, the air very soft and pleasant, like Seville in April or May, and the sea, for which God be given many\nthanks, always very smooth. Frigate- birds, sandpipers, and other birds were seen.\nMonday, 21st of January\nYesterday, before sunset, they steered N.E. b. E., with the wind east, at the rate of 8 miles an hour until midnight,\nequal to 56 miles. Afterwards they steered N.N.E 8 miles an hour, so that they made 104 miles, or 26 leagues, during\nthe night N.E. by N. After sunrise they steered N.N.E. with the same wind, which at times veered to N.E., and they\nmade good 88 miles in the eleven hours of daylight, or 21 leagues: except one that was lost by delay caused by closing\nwith the Pinta to communicate. The air was colder, and it seemed to get colder as they went further north, and also\nthat the nights grew longer owing to the narrowing of the sphere. Many boatswain-birds and terns were seen, as well\nas other birds, but not so many fish, perhaps owing to the water being colder. Much weed was seen.\nTuesday, 22nd of January\nYesterday, after sunset, they steered N.N.E. with an east wind. They made 8 miles an hour during five glasses,\nand three before the watch began, making eight glasses, equal to 72 miles, or 18 leagues. Afterwards they went N.E.\n232 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\nby N. for six glasses, which would be another 18 miles. Then, during four glasses of the second watch N.E. at six\nmiles an hour, or three leagues. From that time to sunset, for eleven glasses, E.N.E. at 6 leagues an hour, equal to\nseven leagues. Then E.N.E. until 11 o\u2019clock, 32 miles. Then the wind fell, and they made no more during that day.\nThe Indians swam about. They saw boatswain-birds and much weed.\nWednesday, 23rd of January\nTo-night the wind was very changeable, but, making the allowances applied by good sailors, they made 84\nmiles, or 21 leagues, N.E. by N. Many times the caravel Ni\u00f1a had to wait for the Pinta, because she sailed badly\nwhen on a bowline, the mizen being of little use owing to the weakness of the mast. If her captain, Martin Alonso\nPinzon, had taken the precaution to provide her with a good mast in the Indies, where there are so many and such\nexcellent spars, instead of deserting his commander from motives of avarice, he would have done better. They saw\nmany boatswain-birds and much weed. The heavens have been clouded over during these last days, but there has\nbeen no rain. The sea has been as smooth as a river, for which many thanks be given to God. After sunrise they\nwent free, and made 30 miles, or 7 1\/2 leagues N.E. During the rest of the day E.N.E. another 30 miles.\nThursday, 24th of January\nThey made 44 miles, or 11 leagues, during the night, allowing for many changes in the wind, which was gener-\nally N.E. After sunrise until sunset E.N.E. 14 leagues.\nFriday, 25th of January\nThey steered during part of the night E.N.E. for 13 glasses, making 9 1\/2 leagues. Then N.N.E. 6 miles. The\nwind fell, and during the day they only made 28 miles E.N.E., or 7 leagues. The sailors killed a tunny and a very\nlarge shark, which was very welcome, as they now had nothing but bread and wine, and some yams from the Indies.\nSaturday, 26th of January\nThis night they made 56 miles, or 14 leagues, E.S.E. After sunrise they steered E.S.E., and sometimes S.E., mak-\ning 40 miles up to 11 o\u2019clock. Afterwards they went on another tack, and then on a bowline, 24 miles, or 6 leagues,\nto the north, until night.\nSunday, 27th of January\nYesterday, after sunset, they steered N.E. and N.E. by N. at the rate of five miles an hour, which in thirteen hours\nwould be 65 miles, or 16 1\/2 leagues. After sunrise they steered N.E. 24 miles, or 6 leagues, until noon, and from\nthat time until sunset 3 leagues E.N.E.\nMonday, 28th of January\nAll night they steered E.N.E. 36 miles, or 9 leagues. After sunrise until sunset E.N.E. 20 miles, or 5 leagues. The\nweather was temperate and pleasant. They saw boatswain-birds, sandpipers, and much weed.\nTuesday, 29th of January\nThey steered E.N.E. 39 miles, or 9 1\/2 leagues, and during the whole day 8 leagues. The air was very pleasant,\nlike April in Castille, the sea smooth, and fish they call dorados came on board.\nWednesday, 30th of January\nAll this night they made 6 leagues E.N.E., and in the day S.E. by S. 13 1\/2 leagues. Boatswain-birds, much weed,\nand many tunnies.\nThursday, 31st of January\nThis night they steered N.E. by N. 30 miles, and afterwards N.E. 35 miles, or 16 leagues. From sunrise to night\nE.N.E. 13 1\/2 leagues. They saw boatswain-birds and terns.\n233 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nFriday, 1st of February\nThey made 16 1\/2 leagues E.N.E. during the night, and went on the same course during the day 29 1\/4 leagues.\nThe sea very smooth, thanks be to God.\nSaturday, 2nd of February\nThey made 40 miles, or 10 leagues, E.N.E. this night. In the daytime, with the same wind aft, they went 7 miles\nan hour, so that in eleven hours they had gone 77 miles, or 9 1\/4 leagues. The sea was very smooth, thanks be to\nGod, and the air very soft. They saw the sea so covered with weed that, if they had not known about it before, they\nwould have been fearful of sunken rocks. They saw terns.\nSunday, 3rd of February\nThis night, the wind being aft and the sea very smooth, thanks be to God, they made 29 leagues. The North\nStar appeared very high, as it docs off Cape St. Vincent. The Admiral was unable to take the altitude, either with the\nastrolabe or with the quadrant, because the rolling caused by the waves prevented it. That day he steered his course\nE.N.E., going 10 miles an hour, so that in eleven hours he made 27 leagues.\nMonday, 4th of February\nDuring the night the course was N.E. by E., going twelve miles an hour part of the time, and the rest ten miles.\nThus they made 130 miles, or 32 leagues and a half. The sky was very threatening and rainy, and it was rather cold,\nby which they knew that they had not yet reached the Azores. After sunrise the course was altered to east. During\nthe whole day they made 77 miles, or 19 1\/4 leagues.\nTuesday, 5th of February\nThis night they steered east, and made 55 miles, or 13 1\/2 leagues. In the day they were going ten miles an hour,\nand in eleven hours made 110 miles, or 27 1\/2 leagues. They saw sandpipers, and some small sticks, a sign that they\nwere near land.\nWednesday, 6th of February\nThey steered east during the night, going at the rate of eleven miles an hour, so that in the thirteen hours of\nthe night they made 143 miles, or 35 1\/4 leagues. They saw many birds. In the day they went 14 miles an hour, and\nmade 154 miles, or 38 1\/2 leagues; so that, including night and day, they made 74 leagues, more or less. Vicente\nAnes said that they had left the island of Flores to the north and Madeira to the cast. Roldan said that the island of\nFayal, or San Gregorio, was to the N.N.E. and Puerto Santo to east. There was much weed.\nThursday, 7th of February\nThis night they steered east, going ten miles an hour, so that in thirteen hours they made 130 miles, or 32 1\/2\nleagues. In the daytime the rate was eight miles an hour, in eleven hours 88 miles, or 22 leagues. This morning the\nAdmiral found himself 65 leagues south of the island of Flores, and the pilot Pedro Alonso, being further north,\naccording to his reckoning, passed between Terceira and Santa Maria to the east, passing to windward of the island\nof Madeira, twelve leagues further north. The sailors saw a new kind of weed, of which there is plenty in the islands\nof the Azores.\nFriday, 8th of February\nThey went three miles an hour to the eastward for some time during the night, and afterwards E.S.E., going\ntwelve miles an hour. From sunrise to noon they made 27 miles, and the same distance from noon till sunset, equal\nto 13 leagues S.S.E.\nSaturday, 9th of February\nFor part of this night they went 3 leagues S.S.E., and afterwards S. by E., then N.E. 5 leagues until ten o\u2019clock in\nthe forenoon, then 9 leagues east until dark.\n234 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\nSunday, 10th of February\nFrom sunset they steered east all night, making 130 miles, or 32 1\/2 leagues. During the day they went at the\nrate of nine miles an hour, making 99 miles, or 24 1\/2 leagues, in eleven hours.\nIn the caravel of the Admiral, Vicente Ya\u00f1ez and the two pilots, Sancho Ruiz and Pedro Alonso Ni\u00f1o, and\nRoldan, made charts and plotted the route. They all made the position a good deal beyond the islands of the Azores\nto the east, and, navigating to the north, none of them touched Santa Maria, which is the last of all the Azores. They\nmade the position five leagues beyond it, and were in the vicinity of the islands of Madeira and Puerto Santo. But\nthe Admiral was very different from them in his reckoning, finding the position very much in rear of theirs. This\nnight he found the island of Flores to the north, and to the east he made the direction to be towards Nafe in Africa,\npassing to leeward of the island of Madeira to the north. . . . .leagues. So that the pilots were nearer to Castille than\nthe Admiral by 150 leagues. The Admiral says that, with the grace of God, when they reach the land they will find\nout whose reckoning was most correct. He also says that he went 263 leagues from the island of Hierro to the place\nwhere he first saw the gulf-weed.\nMonday, 11th of February\nThis night they went twelve miles an hour on their course, and during the day they ran 16 1\/2 leagues. They saw\nmany birds, from which they judged that land was near.\nTuesday, 12th of February\nThey went six miles an hour on an east course during the night, altogether 73 miles, or 18 1\/4 leagues. At this\ntime they began to encounter bad weather with a heavy sea; and, if the caravel had not been very well managed, she\nmust have been lost. During the day they made 11 or 12 leagues with much difficulty and danger.\nWednesday, 13th of February\nFrom sunset until daylight there was great trouble with the wind, and the high and tempestuous sea. There was\nlightning three times to the N.N.E.\u2014a sign of a great storm coming either from that quarter or its opposite. They\nwere lying-to most of the night, afterwards showing a little sail, and made 52 miles, which is 13 leagues. In the day\nthe wind moderated a little, but it soon increased again. The sea was terrific, the waves crossing each other, and\nstraining the vessels. They made 55 miles more, equal to 13 1\/2 leagues.\nThursday, 14th of February\nThis night the wind increased, and the waves were terrible, rising against each other, and so shaking and strain-\ning the vessel that she could make no headway, and was in danger of being stove in. They carried the mainsail very\nclosely reefed, so as just to give her steerageway, and proceeded thus for three hours, making 20 miles. Meanwhile,\nthe wind and sea increased, and, seeing the great danger, the Admiral began to run before it, there being nothing\nelse to be done. The caravel Pinta began to run before the wind at the same time, and Martin Alonso ran her out of\nsight, although the Admiral kept showing lanterns all night, and the other answered. It would seem that she could\ndo no more, owing to the force of the tempest, and she was taken far from the route of the Admiral. He steered\nthat night E.N.E., and made 54 miles, equal to 13 leagues. At sunrise the wind blew still harder, and the cross sea\nwas terrific. They continued to show the closely-reefed mainsail, to enable her to rise from between the waves, or\nshe would otherwise have been swamped. An E.N.E. course was steered, and afterwards N.E. by E. for six hours,\nmaking 7 1\/2 leagues. The Admiral ordered that a pilgrimage should be made to Our Lady of Guadaloupe, carrying\na candle of 6 lbs. of weight in wax, and that all the crew should take an oath that the pilgrimage should be made by\nthe man on whom the lot fell. As many beans were got as there were persons on board, and on one a cross was cut\nwith a knife. They were then put into a cap and shaken up. The first who put in his hand was the Admiral, and he\ndrew out the bean with a cross, so the lot fell on him; and he was bound to go on the pilgrimage and fulfil the vow.\nAnother lot was drawn, to go on pilgrimage to Our Lady of Loreto, which is in the march of Ancona, in the Papal\nterritory, a house where Our Lady works many and great miracles. The lot fell on a sailor of the port of Santa Maria,\nnamed Pedro dc Villa, and the Admiral promised to pay his travelling expenses. Another pilgrimage was agreed\nupon, to watch for one night in Santa Clara at Moguer, and have a Mass said, for which they again used the beans,\nincluding the one with a cross. The lot again fell on the Admiral. After this the Admiral and all the crew made a\nvow that, on arriving at the first land, they would all go in procession, in their shirts, to say their prayers in a church\ndedicated to Our Lady.\n235 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nBesides these general vows made in common, each sailor made a special vow; for no one expected to escape,\nholding themselves for lost, owing to the fearful weather from which they were suffering. The want of ballast in-\ncreased the danger of the ship, which had become light, owing to the consumption of the provisions and water. On\naccount of the favourable weather enjoyed among the islands, the Admiral had omitted to make provision for this\nneed, thinking that ballast might be taken on board at the island inhabited by women, which he had intended to\nvisit. The only thing to do was to fill the barrels that had contained wine or fresh water with water from the sea, and\nthis supplied a remedy.\nHere the Admiral writes of the causes which made him fear that he would perish, and of others that gave him\nhope that God would work his salvation, in order that such news as he was bringing to the Sovereigns might not be\nlost. It seemed to him that the strong desire he felt to bring such great news, and to show that all he had said and\noffered to discover had turned out true, suggested the fear that he would not be able to do so, and that each stinging\ninsect would be able to thwart and impede the work. He attributes this fear to his little faith, and to his want of con-\nfidence in Divine Providence. He was comforted, on the other hand, by the mercies of God in having vouchsafed\nhim such a victory, in the discoveries he had made, and in that God had complied with all his desires in Castille,\nafter much adversity and many misfortunes. As he had before put all his trust in God, who had heard him and\ngranted all he sought, he ought now to believe that God would permit the completion of what had been begun, and\nordain that he should be saved. Especially as he had freed him on the voyage out, when he had still greater reason\nto fear, from the trouble caused by the sailors and people of his company, who all with one voice declared their in-\ntention to return, and protested that they would rise against him. But the eternal God gave him force and valour to\nwithstand them all, and in many other marvellous ways had God shown his will in this voyage besides those known\nto their Highnesses. Thus he ought not to fear the present tempest, though his weakness and anxiety prevent him\nfrom giving tranquillity to his mind. He says further that it gave him great sorrow to think of the two sons he had\nleft at their studies in Cordova, who would be left orphans, without father or mother, in a strange land; while the\nSovereigns would not know of the services he had performed in this voyage, nor would they receive the prosperous\nnews which would move them to help the orphans. To remedy this, and that their Highnesses might know how\nour Lord had granted a victory in all that could be desired respecting the Indies, and that they might understand\nthat there were no storms in those parts, which may be known by the herbs and trees which grow even within the\nsea; also that the Sovereigns might still have information, even if he perished in the storm, he took a parchment\nand wrote on it as good an account as he could of all he had discovered, entreating anyone who might pick it up to\ndeliver it to the Sovereigns. He rolled this parchment up in waxed cloth, fastened it very securely, ordered a large\nwooden barrel to be brought, and put it inside, so that no one else knew what it was. They thought that it was some\nact of devotion, and so he ordered the barrel to be thrown into the sea. Afterwards, in the showers and squalls, the\nwind veered to the west, and they went before it, only with the foresail, in a very confused sea, for five hours. They\nmade 2 1\/2 leagues N.E. They had taken in the reefed mainsail, for fear some wave of the sea should carry all away.\nFriday, 15th of February\nLast night, after sunset, the sky began to clear towards the west, showing that the wind was inclined to come from\nthat quarter. The Admiral added the bonnet to the mainsail. The sea was still very high, although it had gone down\nslightly. They steered E.N.E., and went four miles an hour, which made 13 leagues during the eleven hours of the night.\nAfter sunrise they sighted land. It appeared from the bows to bear E.N.E. Some said it was the island of Madeira, oth-\ners that it was the rock of Cintra, in Portugal, near Lisbon. Presently the wind headed to E.N.E., and a heavy sea came\nfrom the west, the caravel being 5 leagues from the land. The Admiral found by his reckoning that he was close to the\nAzores, and believed that this was one of them. The pilots and sailors thought it was the land of Castille.\nSaturday, 16th of February\nAll that night the Admiral was standing off and on to keep clear of the land, which they now knew to be an island,\nsometimes standing N.E., at others N.N.E., until sunrise, when they tacked to the south to reach the island, which was\nnow concealed by a great mist. Another island was in sight from the poop, at a distance of eight leagues. Afterwards,\nfrom sunrise until dark, they were tacking to reach the land against a strong wind and head-sea. At the time of repeat-\ning the Salve, which is just before dark, some of the men saw a light to leeward, and it seemed that it must be on the\nisland they first saw yesterday. All night they were beating to windward, and going as near as they could, so as to see\nsome way to the island at sunrise. That night the Admiral got a little rest, for he had not slept nor been able to sleep\nsince Wednesday, and his legs were very sore from long exposure to the wet and cold. At sunrise he steered S.S.W., and\nreached the island at night, but could not make out what island it was, owing to the thick weather.\n236 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\nMonday, 18th of February\nYesterday, after sunset, the Admiral was sailing round the island, to see where he could anchor and open com-\nmunications. He let go one anchor, which he presently lost, and then stood off and on all night. After sunrise he\nagain reached the north side of the island, where he anchored, and sent the boat on shore. They had speech with\nthe people, and found that it was the island of Santa Maria, one of the Azores. They pointed out the port to which\nthe caravel should go. They said that they had never seen such stormy weather as there had been for the last fifteen\ndays, and they wondered how the caravel could have escaped. They gave many thanks to God, and showed great joy\nat the news that the Admiral had discovered the Indies. The Admiral says that his navigation had been very certain,\nand that he had laid the discoveries down on the chart. Many thanks were due to our Lord, although there had been\nsome delay. But he was sure that he was in the region of the Azores, and that this was one of them. He pretended to\nhave gone over more ground, to mislead the pilots and mariners who pricked off the charts, in order that he might\nremain master of that route to the Indies, as, in fact, he did. For none of the others kept an accurate reckoning, so\nthat no one but himself could be sure of the route to the Indies.\nTuesday, 19th of February\nAfter sunset three natives of the island came to the beach and hailed. The Admiral sent the boat, which re-\nturned with fowls and fresh bread. It was carnival time, and they brought other things which were sent by the\ncaptain of the island, named Juan de Casta\u00f1eda, saying that he knew the Admiral very well, and that he did not\ncome to see him because it was night, but that at dawn he would come with more refreshments, bringing with him\nthree men of the boat\u2019s crew, whom he did not send back owing to the great pleasure he derived from hearing their\naccount of the voyage. The Admiral ordered much respect to be shown to the messengers, and that they should be\ngiven beds to sleep in that night, because it was late, and the town was far off. As on the previous Thursday, when\nthey were in the midst of the storm, they had made a vow to go in procession to a church of Our Lady as soon as\nthey came to land, the Admiral arranged that half the crew should go to comply with their obligation to a small\nchapel, like a hermitage, near the shore; and that he would himself go afterwards with the rest. Believing that it was\na peaceful land, and confiding in the offers of the captain of the island, and in the peace that existed between Spain\nand Portugal, he asked the three men to go to the town and arrange for a priest to come and say Mass. The half of\nthe crew then went in their shirts, in compliance with their vow. While they were at their prayers, all the people of\nthe town, horse and foot, with the captain at their head, came and took them all prisoners. The Admiral, suspect-\ning nothing, was waiting for the boat to take him and the rest to accomplish the vow. At 11 o\u2019clock, seeing that they\ndid not come back, he feared that they had been detained, or that the boat had been swamped, all the island being\nsurrounded by high rocks. He could not see what had taken place, because the hermitage was round a point. He got\nup the anchor, and made sail until he was in full view of the hermitage, and he saw many of the horsemen dismount\nand get into the boat with arms. They came to the caravel to seize the Admiral. The captain stood up in the boat,\nand asked for an assurance of safety from the Admiral, who replied that he granted it; but, what outrage was this,\nthat he saw none of his people in the boat? The Admiral added that they might come on board, and that he would\ndo all that might be proper. The Admiral tried, with fair words, to get hold of this captain, that he might recover his\nown people, not considering that he broke faith by giving him security, because he had offered peace and security,\nand had then broken his word. The captain, as he came with an evil intention, would not come on board. Seeing\nthat he did not come alongside, the Admiral asked that he might be told the reason for the detention of his men, an\nact which would displease the King of Portugal, because the Portuguese received much honour in the territories of\nthe King of Castille, and were as safe as if they were in Lisbon. He further said that the Sovereigns had given him\nletters of recommendation to all the Lords and Princes of the world, which he would show the captain if he would\ncome on board; that he was the Admiral of the Ocean Sea, and Viceroy of the Indies, which belonged to their High-\nnesses, and that he would show the commissions signed with their signatures, and attested by their seals, which he\nheld up from a distance. He added that his Sovereigns were in friendship and amity with the King of Portugal, and\nhad ordered that all honour should be shown to ships that came from Portugal. Further, that if the captain did not\nsurrender his people, he would still go on to Castille, as he had quite sufficient to navigate as far as Seville, in which\ncase the captain and his followers would be severely punished for their offence. Then the captain and those with\nhim replied that they did not know the King and Queen of Castille there, nor their letters, nor were they afraid of\nthem, and they would give the Admiral to understand that this was Portugal, almost menacing him. On hearing\nthis the Admiral was much moved, thinking that some cause of disagreement might have arisen between the two\nkingdoms during his absence, yet he could not endure that they should not be answered reasonably. Afterwards he\nturned to the captain, and said that he should go to the port with the caravel, and that all that had been done would\n237 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nbe reported to the King his Lord. The Admiral made those who were in the caravel bear witness to what he said,\ncalling to the captain and all the others, and promising that he would not leave the caravel until a hundred Portu-\nguese had been taken to Castille, and all that island had been laid waste. He then returned to anchor in the port\nwhere he was first, the wind being very unfavourable for doing anything else.\nWednesday, 20th of February\nThe Admiral ordered the ship to be repaired, and the casks to be filled alongside for ballast. This was a very bad\nport, and he feared he might have to cut the cables. This was so, and he made sail for the island of San Miguel; but\nthere is no good port in any of the Azores for the weather they then experienced, and there was no other remedy\nbut to go to sea.\nThursday, 21st of February\nYesterday the Admiral left that island of Santa Maria for that of San Miguel, to see if a port could be found to\nshelter his vessel from the bad weather. There was much wind and a high sea, and he was sailing until night with-\nout being able to see either one land or the other, owing to the thick weather caused by wind and sea. The Admiral\nsays he was in much anxiety, because he only had three sailors who knew their business, the rest knowing nothing\nof seamanship. He was lying-to all that night, in great danger and trouble. Our Lord showed him mercy in that the\nwaves came in one direction, for if there had been a cross sea they would have suffered much more. After sunrise\nthe island of San Miguel was not in sight, so the Admiral determined to return to Santa Maria, to see if he could\nrecover his people and boat, and the anchors and cables he had left there.\nThe Admiral says that he was astonished at the bad weather he encountered in the region of these islands. In\nthe Indies he had navigated throughout the winter without the necessity for anchoring, and always had fine weath-\ner, never having seen the sea for a single hour in such a state that it could not be navigated easily. But among these\nislands he had suffered from such terrible storms. The same had happened in going out as far as the Canary Islands,\nbut as soon as they were passed there was always fine weather, both in sea and air. In concluding these remarks, he\nobserves that the sacred theologians and wise men said well when they placed the terrestrial paradise in the Far\nEast, because it is a most temperate region. Hence these lands that he had now discovered must, he says, be in the\nextreme East.\nFriday, 22nd of February\nYesterday the Admiral came-to off Santa Maria, in the place or port where he had first anchored. Presently a\nman came down to some rocks at the edge of the beach, hailing that they were not to remain there. Soon afterwards\nthe boat came with five sailors, two priests, and a scrivener. They asked for safety, and when it was granted by the\nAdmiral, they came on board, and, as it was night they slept on board, the Admiral showing them all the civility he\ncould. In the morning they asked to be shown the authority of the Sovereigns of Castille, by which the voyage had\nbeen made. The Admiral felt that they did this to give some colour of right to what they had done, and to show that\nthey had right on their side. As they were unable to secure the person of the Admiral, whom they intended to get\ninto their power when they came with the boat armed, they now feared that their game might not turn out so well,\nthinking, with some fear, of what the Admiral had threatened, and which he proposed to put into execution. In\norder to get his people released, the Admiral displayed the general letter of the Sovereigns to all Princes and Lords,\nand other documents, and having given them of what he had, the Portuguese went on shore contented, and pres-\nently released all the crew and the boat. The Admiral heard from them that if he had been captured also, they never\nwould have been released, for the captain said that those were the orders of the King his Lord.\nSaturday, 23rd of February\nYesterday the weather began to improve, and the Admiral got under weigh to seek a better anchorage, where he\ncould take in wood and stones for ballast; but he did not find one until late.\nSunday, 24th of February\nHe anchored yesterday in the afternoon, to take in wood and stones, but the sea was so rough that they could not\nland from the boat, and during the first watch it came on to blow from the west and S.W. He ordered sail to be made,\nowing to the great danger there is off these islands in being at anchor with a southerly gale, and as the wind was S.W.\nit would go round to south. As it was a good wind for Castille, he gave up his intention of taking in wood and stones,\n238 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\nand shaped an easterly course until sunset, going seven miles an hour for six hours and a half, equal to 45 1\/2 miles.\nAfter sunset he made six miles an hour, or 66 miles in eleven hours, altogether 111 miles, equal to 28 leagues.\nMonday, 25th of February\nYesterday, after sunset, the caravel went at the rate ot five miles an hour on an easterly course, and in the eleven\nhours of the night she made 65 miles, equal to 16 1\/4 leagues. From sunrise to sunset they made another 16 1\/2\nleagues with a smooth sea, thanks be to God. A very large bird, like an eagle, came to the caravel.\nTuesday, 26th of February\nYesterday night the caravel steered her course in a smooth sea, thanks be to God. Most of the time she was\ngoing eight miles an hour, and made a hundred miles, equal to 25 leagues. After sunrise there was little wind and\nsome rain-showers. They made about 8 leagues E.N.E.\nWednesday, 27th of February\nDuring the night and day she was off her course, owing to contrary winds and a heavy sea. She was found to be\n125 leagues from Cape St. Vincent, and 80 from the island of Madeira, 106 from Santa Maria. It was very trouble-\nsome to have such bad weather just when they were at the very door of their home.\nThursday, 28th of February\nThe same weather during the night, with the wind from south and S.E., sometimes shifting to N.E. and E.N.E.,\nand it was the same all day.\nFriday, 1st of March\nTo-night the course was E.N.E., and they made twelve leagues. During the day, 23 1\/2 leagues on the same\ncourse.\nSaturday, 2nd of March\nThe course was E.N.E., and distance made good 28 leagues during the night, and 20 in the day.\nSunday, 3rd of March\nAfter sunset the course was east; but a squall came down, split all the sails, and the vessel was in great danger;\nbut God was pleased to deliver them. They drew lots for sending a pilgrim in a shirt to Santa Maria de la Cinta at\nHuelva, and the lot fell on the Admiral. The whole crew also made a vow to fast on bread and water during the first\nSaturday after their arrival in port. They had made 60 miles before the sails were split. Afterwards they ran under\nbare poles, owing to the force of the gale and the heavy sea. They saw signs of the neighbourhood of land, finding\nthemselves near Lisbon.\nMonday, 4th of March\nDuring the night they were exposed to a terrible storm, expecting to be overwhelmed by the cross seas, while\nthe wind seemed to raise the caravel into the air, and there was rain and lightning in several directions. The Admiral\nprayed to our Lord to preserve them, and in the first watch it pleased our Lord to show land, which was reported\nby the sailors. As it was advisable not to reach it before it was known whether there was any port to which he could\nrun for shelter, the Admiral set the mainsail, as there was no other course but to proceed, though in great danger.\nThus God preserved them until daylight, though all the time they were in infinite fear and trouble. When it was\nlight, the Admiral knew the land, which was the rock of Cintra, near the river of Lisbon, and he resolved to run in\nbecause there was nothing else to be done. So terrible was the storm, that in the village of Cascaes, at the mouth of\nthe river, the people were praying for the little vessel all that morning. After they were inside, the people came off,\nlooking upon their escape as a miracle. At the third hour they passed Rastelo, within the river of Lisbon, where they\nwere told that such a winter, with so many storms, had never before been known, and that 25 ships had been lost in\nFlanders, while others had been wind-bound in the river for four months. Presently the Admiral wrote to the King\nof Portugal, who was then at a distance of nine leagues, to state that the Sovereigns of Castille had ordered him to\n239 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nenter the ports of his Highness, and ask for what he required for payment, and requesting that the King would give\npermission for the caravel to come to Lisbon, because some ruffians, hearing that he had much gold on board, might\nattempt a robbery in an unfrequented port, knowing that they did not come from Guinea, but from the Indies.\nTuesday, 5th of March\nTo-day the great ship of the King of Portugal was also at anchor off Rastelo, with the best provision of artillery\nand arms that the Admiral had ever seen. The master of her, named Bartolom\u00e9 Diaz, of Lisbon, came in an armed\nboat to the caravel, and ordered the Admiral to get into the boat, to go and give an account of himself to the agents\nof the king and to the captain of that ship. The Admiral replied that he was the Admiral of the Sovereigns of Cas-\ntille, and that he would not give an account to any such persons, nor would he leave the ship except by force, as\nhe had not the power to resist. The master replied that he must then send the master of the caravel. The Admiral\nanswered that neither the master nor any other person should go except by force, for if he allowed anyone to go, it\nwould be as if he went himself; and that such was the custom of the Admirals of the Sovereigns of Castille, rather to\ndie than to submit, or to let any of their people submit. The master then moderated his tone, and told the Admiral\nthat if that was his determination he might do as he pleased. He, however, requested that he might be shown the\nletters of the Kings of Castille, if they were on board. The Admiral readily showed them, and the master returned\nto the ship and reported what had happened to the captain, named Alvaro Dama. That officer, making great festival\nwith trumpets and drums, came to the caravel to visit the Admiral, and offered to do all that he might require.\nWednesday, 6th of March\nAs soon as it was known that the Admiral came from the Indies, it was wonderful how many people came from\nLisbon to see him and the Indians, giving thanks to our Lord, and saying that the heavenly Majesty had given all\nthis to the Sovereigns of Castille as a reward for their faith and their great desire to serve God.\nThursday, 7th of March\nTo-day an immense number of people came to the caravel, including many knights, and amongst them the\nagents of the king, and all gave infinite thanks to our Lord for so wide an increase of Christianity granted by our\nLord to the Sovereigns of Castille; and they said that they received it because their Highnesses had worked and\nlaboured for the increase of the religion of Christ.\nFriday, 8th of March\nTo-day the Admiral received a letter from the King of Portugal brought by Don Martin de Noro\u00f1a, asking him\nto visit him where he was, as the weather was not suitable for the departure of the caravel. He complied, to prevent\nsuspicion, although he did not wish to go, and went to pass the night at Sacanben. The king had given orders to his\nofficers that all that the Admiral, his crew, and the caravel were in need of should be given without payment, and\nthat all the Admiral wanted should be complied with.\nSaturday, 9th of March\nTo-day the Admiral left Sacanben, to go where the king was residing, which was at Valparaiso, nine leagues\nfrom Lisbon. Owing to the rain, he did not arrive until night. The king caused him to be received very honourably\nby the principal officers of his household; and the king himself received the Admiral with great favour, making him\nsit down, and talking very pleasantly. He offered to give orders that everything should be done for the service of\nthe Sovereigns of Castille, and said that the successful termination of the voyage had given him great pleasure. He\nsaid further that he understood that, in the capitulation between the Sovereigns and himself, that conquest be-\nlonged to him. The Admiral replied that he had not seen the capitulation, nor knew more than that the Sovereigns\nhad ordered him not to go either to Lamina or to any other port of Guinea, and that this had been ordered to be\nproclaimed in all the ports of Andalusia before he sailed. The king graciously replied that he held it for certain that\nthere would be no necessity for any arbitrators. The Admiral was assigned as a guest to the Prior of Crato, who was\nthe principal person present, and from whom he received many favours and civilities.\nSunday, 10th of March\nTo-day, after Mass, the king repeated that if the Admiral wanted anything he should have it. He conversed\nmuch with the Admiral respecting his voyage, always ordering him to sit down, and treating him with great favour.\n240 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\nMonday, 11th of March\nTo-day the Admiral took leave of the king, who entrusted him with some messages to the Sovereigns, and\nalways treating him with much friendliness. He departed after dinner, Don Martin de Noro\u00f1a being sent with him,\nand all the knights set out with him, and went with him some distance, to do him honour. Afterwards he came to a\nmonastery of San Antonio, near a place called Villafranca, where the Queen was residing. The Admiral went to do\nher reverence and to kiss her hand, because she had sent to say that he was not to go without seeing her. The Duke\nand the Marquis were with her, and the Admiral was received with much honour. He departed at night, and went to\nsleep at Llandra.\nTuesday, 12th of March\nTo-day, as he was leaving Llandra to return to the caravel, an esquire of the king arrived, with an offer that if he\ndesired to go to Castille by land, that he should be supplied with lodgings, and beasts, and all that was necessary.\nWhen the Admiral took leave of him, he ordered a mule to be supplied to him, and another for his pilot, who was\nwith him, and he says that the pilot received a present of twenty espadines. He said this that the Sovereigns might\nknow all that was done. He arrived on board the caravel that night.\nWednesday, 13th of March\nTo-day, at 8 o\u2019clock, with the flood tide, and the wind N.N.W., the Admiral got under weigh and made sail for\nSeville.\nThursday, 14th of March\nYesterday, after sunset, a southerly course was steered, and before sunrise they were off Cape St. Vincent, which\nis in Portugal. Afterwards he shaped a course to the east for Saltes, and went on all day with little wind, \u201cuntil now\nthat the ship is off Furon.\u201d\nFriday, 15th of March\nYesterday, after sunset, she went on her course with little wind, and at sunrise she was off Saltes. At noon, with\nthe tide rising, they crossed the bar of Saltes, and reached the port which they had left on the 3rd of August of the\nyear before. The Admiral says that so ends this journal, unless it becomes necessary to go to Barcelona by sea, hav-\ning received news that their Highnesses are in that city, to give an account of all his voyage which our Lord had per-\nmitted him to make, and saw fit to set forth in him. For, assuredly, he held with a firm and strong knowledge that\nhis high Majesty made all things good, and that all is good except sin. Nor can he value or think of anything being\ndone without His consent. \u201cI know respecting this voyage\u201d, says the Admiral, \u201cthat he has miraculously shown his\nwill, as may be seen from this journal, setting forth the numerous miracles that have been displayed in the voyage,\nand in me who was so long at the court of your Highnesses, working in opposition to and against the opinions of so\nmany chief persons of your household, who were all against me, looking upon this enterprise as folly.

I took possession of all of them for our most fortunate King by making public proc-\nlamation and unfurling his standard, no one making any resistance. To the first of them I have given the name of\nour blessed Saviour, whose aid I have reached this and all the rest; but the Indians call it Guanahani. To each of the\nothers also I gave a new name, ordering one to be called Sancta Maria de Concepcion, another Fernandina, another\nIsabella, another Juana; and so with all the rest. As soon as we reached the island which I have just said was called\nJuana, I sailed along its coast some considerable distance towards the West, and found it to be so large, without any\napparent end, that I believed it was not an island, but a continent, a province of Cathay. But I saw neither towns nor\ncities lying on the seaboard, only some villages and country farms, with whose inhabitants I could not get speech,\nbecause they fled as soon as they beheld us. I continued on, supposing I should come upon some city, or coun-\ntry-houses. At last, finding that no discoveries rewarded our further progress, and that this course was leading us\ntowards the North, which I was desirous of avoiding, as it was now winter in these regions, and it had always been\nmy intention to proceed Southwards, and the winds also were favorable to such desires, I concluded not to attempt\nany other adventures; so, turning back, I came again to a certain harbor, which I had remarked. From there I sent\ntwo of our men into the country to learn whether there was any king or cities in that land. They journeyed for three\ndays, and found innumerable people and habitations, but small and having no fixed government; on which account\nthey returned. Meanwhile I had learned from some Indians, whom I had seized at this place, that this country was\nreally an island. Consequently I continued along towards the East, as much as 322 miles, always hugging the shore.\nWhere was the very extremity of the island, from there I saw another island to the Eastwards, distant 54 miles from\nthis Juana, which I named Hispana; and proceeded to it, and directed my course for 564 miles East by North as it\nwere, just as I had done at Juana.\nThe island called Juana, as well as the others in its neighborhood, is exceedingly fertile. It has numerous har-\nbors on all sides, very safe and wide, above comparison with any I have ever seen. Through it flow many very broad\nand health-giving rivers; and there are in it numerous very lofty mountains. All these island are very beautiful, and\nof quite different shapes; easy to be traversed, and full of the greatest variety of trees reaching to the stars. I think\nthese never lose their leaves, and I saw them looking as green and lovely as they are wont to be in the month of May\nin Spain. Some of them were in leaf, and some in fruit; each flourishing in the condition its nature required. The\nnightingale was singing and various other little birds, when I was rambling among them in the month of November.\nThere are also in the island called Juana seven or eight kinds of palms, which as readily surpass ours in height and\nbeauty as do all the other trees, herbs, and fruits. There are also wonderful pinewoods, fields, and extensive mead-\nows; birds of various kinds, and honey; and all the different metals, except iron.\nIn the island, which I have said before was called Hispana, there are very lofty and beautiful mountains, great\nfarms, groves and fields, most fertile both for cultivation and for pasturage, and well adapted for constructing\nbuildings. The convenience of the harbors in this island, and the excellence of the rivers, in volume and salubrity,\nsurpass human belief, unless on should see them. In it the trees, pasture-lands and fruits different much from those\nof Juana. Besides, this Hispana abounds in various kinds of species, gold and metals. The inhabitants of both sexes\nof this and of all the other island I have seen, or of which I have any knowledge, always go as naked as they came\ninto the world, except that some of the women cover their private parts with leaves or branches, or a veil of cotton,\nwhich they prepare themselves for this purpose. They are all, as I said before, unprovided with any sort of iron, and\nthey are destitute of arms, which are entirely unknown to them, and for which they are not adapted; not on account\nof any bodily deformity, for they are well made, but because they are timid and full of terror. They carry, however,\ncanes dried in the sun in place of weapons, upon whose roots they fix a wooded shaft, dried and sharpened to a\npoint. But they never dare to make use of these; for it has often happened, when I have sent two or three of my men\nto some of their villages to speak with the inhabitants, that a crowd of Indians has sallied forth; but when they saw\nour men approaching, they speedily took to flight, parents abandoning children, and children their parents. This\nhappened not because any loss or injury had been inflicted upon any of them. On the contrary I gave whatever I\nhad, cloth and many other things, to whomsoever I approached, or with whom I could get speech, without any re-\nturn being made to me; but they are by nature fearful and timid. But when they see that they are safe, and all fear is\nbanished, they are very guileless and honest, and very liberal of all they have. No one refuses the asker anything that\nhe possesses; on the contrary they themselves invite us to ask for it. They manifest the greatest affection towards all\nof us, exchanging valuable things for trifles, content with the very least thing or nothing at all. But I forbade giving\nthem a very trifling thing and of no value, such as bits of plates, dishes, or glass; also nails and straps; although it\nseemed to them, if they could get such, that they had acquired the most beautiful jewels in the world. For it chanced\nthat a sailor received for a single strap as much weight of gold as three sold solidi; and so others for other things\nof less price, especially for new blancas, and for some gold coins, for which they gave whatever they seller asked;\nfor instance, an ounce and a half or two ounces of gold, or thirty or forty pounds of cotton, with which they were\nalready familiar. So too for pieces of hoops, jugs, jars, and pots they bartered cotton and gold like beasts. This I for-\n242 The Journals of Christopher Columbus\nbade, because it was plainly unjust; and I gave them many beautiful and pleasing things, which I had brought with\nme, for no return whatever, in order to win their affection, and that they might become Christians and inclined to\nlove our King and Queen and Princes and all the people of Spain; and that they might be eager to search for and\ngather and give to us what they abound in and we greatly need.\nThey do not practice idolatry; on the contrary, they believe that all strength, all power, in short all blessings,\nare from Heaven, and I have come down from there with these ships and sailors; and in this spirit was I received\neverywhere, after they had got over their fear. They are neither lazy nor awkward; but, on the contrary, are of an\nexcellent and acute understanding. Those who have sailed these seas give excellent accounts of everything; but they\nhave never seen men wearing clothes, or ships like ours.\nAs soon as I had come into this sea, I took by force some Indians from the first island, in order that they might\nlearn from us, and at the same time tell us what they knew about affairs in these regions. This succeeded admira-\nbly; for in a short time we understood them and they us both by gesture and signs and words; and they were of\ngreat service to us. They are coming now with me, and have always believed that I have come from Heaven, not-\nwithstanding the long time they have been, and still remain, with us. They were the first who told this wherever\nwe went, one calling to another, with a loud voice, Come, Come, you will see Men from Heaven. Whereupon both\nwomen and men, children and adults, young and old, laying aside the fear they had felt a little before, flocked eager-\nly to see us, a great crowd thronging about our steps, some bringing food, and others drink, with greatest love and\nincredible good will.\nIn each island are many boats made of solid wood; though narrow, yet in length and shape similar to our\ntwo-bankers, but swifter in motion, and managed by oars only. Some of them are large, some small, and some of\nmedium size; but most are larger than a two-banker rowed by 18 oars. With these they sail to all the islands, which\nare innumerable; engaging in traffic and commerce with each other. I saw some of these biremes, or boats, which\ncarried 70 or 80 rowers. In all these islands there is no difference in the appearance of the inhabitants, and none in\ntheir customs and language, so that all understand one another. This is a circumstance most favorable for what I\nbelieve our most serene King especially desires, that is, their conversion to the holy faith of Christ; for which,\nindeed, so far as I could understand, they are very ready and prone.\nI have told already how I sailed in a straight course along the island of Juana from West to East 322 miles. From\nthis voyage and the extent of my journeyings I can say that this Juana is larger than England and Scotland together.\nFor beyond the aforesaid 322 miles, in that portion which looks towards the West, there are two more provinces,\nwhich I did not visit. One of them the\nIndians call Anan, and its inhabitants\nare born with tails. These provinces\nextend 180 miles, as I learned from the\nIndians, whom I am bringing with me,\nand who are well acquainted with all\nthese islands.\nThe distance around Hispana is\ngreater than all Spain from Colonia to\nFontarabia; as is readily proved, because\nits fourth side, which I myself traversed\nin a straight course from West to East,\nstretches 540 miles. This island is to be\ncoveted, and not to be despised when\nacquired. As I have already taken pos-\nsession of all the others, as I have said,\nfor our most invincible King, and the\nrole over them is entirely committed\nto the said King, so in this one I have\ntaken special possession of a certain\nlarge town, in a most convenient spot,\nwell suited for all profit and commerce,\nto which I have given the name of the\nNativity of our Lord; and there I ordered Image 11.14: the Death of Columbus | Illustration by Louis Prang & Co., depict-\na fort of be built forthwith, which ought ing Columbus on his death bed, surrounded by mournful onlookers.\nto be finished now. In it I left as many\nAuthor: L. Prang & Co.\nmen as seemed necessary, with all kinds\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nof arms, and provisions sufficient for\nLicense: Public Domain\n243 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nmore than a year; also a caravel and men to build others, skilled not only in trade but in others. I secured for them\nthe good will and remarkable friendship of the King of the island; for these people are very affectionate and kind;\nso much so that the aforesaid King took a pride in my being called his brother. Although they should change their\nminds, and wish to harm those who have remained in the fort, they cannot; because they are without arms, go\nnaked and are too timid; so that, in truth, those who hold the aforesaid fort can lay waste the whole of that island,\nwithout any danger to themselves, provided they do not violate the rules and instructions I have given them.\nIn all these islands, as I understand, every man is satisfied with only one wife, except the princes or kings, who\nare permitted to have 20. The women appear to work more than the men; but I could not well understand whether\nthey have private property, or not; for I saw that what every one had was shared with the others, especially meals,\nprovisions and such things. I found among them no monsters, as very many expected; but men of great deference\nand kind; nor are they black like Ethiopians; but they have long, straight hair. They do not dwell where the rays of\nSun have most power, although the Sun\u2019s heat is very great there, as this region is twenty-six degrees distant from\nthe equinoctial line. From the summits of the mountains there comes great cold, but the Indians mitigate it by\nbeing inured to the weather, and by the help of very hot food, which they consume frequently and in immoderate\nquantities.\nI saw no monsters, neither did I hear accounts of any such except in an island called Charis, the second as one\ncrosses over from Spain to India, which is inhabited by a certain race regarded by their neighbors as very ferocious.\nThey eat human flesh, and make use of several kinds of boats by which they cross over to all the Indian islands, and\nplunder and carry off whatever they can. But they differ in no respect from the others except in wearing their hair\nlong after the fashion of women. They make use of bows and arrows made of reeds, having pointed shafts fastened\nto the thicker portion, as we have before described. For this reason they are considered to be ferocious, and the oth-\ner Indians consequently are terribly afraid of them; but I consider them of no more account than the others. They\nhave intercourse with certain women who dwell alone upon the island of Mateurin, the first as one crosses from\nSpain to India. These women follow none of the usual occupations of their sex; but they use bows and arrows like\nthose of their husbands, which I have described, and protect themselves with plates of copper, which is found in the\ngreatest abundance among them.\nI was informed that there is another island larger than the aforesaid Hispana, whose inhabitants have no hair;\nand that there is a greater abundance of gold in it than in any of the others. Some of the inhabitants of these islands\nand of the others I have seen I am bringing over with me to bear testimony to what I have reported. Finally, to sum\nup in a few words the chief results and advantages of our departure and speedy return, I make this promise to our\nmost invincible Sovereigns, that, if I am supported by some little assistance from them, I will give them as much\ngold as they have need of, and in addition spices, cotton and mastic, which is found only in Chios, and as much\naloes-wood, and as many heathen slaves as their majesties may choose to demand; besides these, rhubarb and other\nkinds of drugs, which I think the men I left in the fort before alluded to, have already discovered, or will do so; as I\nhave delayed nowhere longer than the winds compelled me, except while I was providing for the construction of a\nfort in the city of Nativity, and for making all things safe.\nAlthough these matters are very wonderful and unheard of, they would have been much more so, if ships to a\nreasonable amount had been furnished me. But what has been accomplished is great and wonderful, and not at all\nproportionate to my deserts, but to the sacred Christian faith, and to the piety and religion of our Sovereigns. For\nwhat is the mind of man could not compass the spirit of God has granted to mortals. For God is wont and listen to\nhis servants who love his precepts, even in impossibilities, as has happened to me in the present instance, who have\naccomplished what human strength has hitherto never attained. For if any one has written or told anything about\nthese islands, all have done so either obscurely or by guesswork, so that if has almost seemed to be fabulous.\nTherefore let King and Queen and Princes, and their most fortunate realms, and all other\nChristian provinces, let us all return thanks to our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who has bestowed so great\na victory and reward upon us; let there be processions and solemn sacrifices prepared; let the churches be decked\nwith festal boughs; let Christ rejoice upon Earth as he rejoices in Heaven, as he foresees that so many souls of so\nmany people heretofore lost are to be saved; and let us be glad not only for the exaltation of our faith, but also for\nthe increase of temporal prosperity, in which not only Spain but all Christendom is about to share.\nAs these things have been accomplished so have they been briefly narrated.

This booklet, composed of twenty-six chapters, is a political treatise offering advice to rulers on\nhow to obtain and keep power. It is assumed that a version of the manuscript had been circulated from 1513 on,\nwhereas it was first officially published in 1532, posthumously. Drawing lessons from the Roman historian Livy, its\ninnovation lies in the treatise\u2019s focus on the efficacy of ruling, a significant contrast from traditional Christian-moral-\nity-based instructions for rulers. Although some had even interpreted it as a satire, the adjective \u201cMachiavellian\u201d has\ncome to have a pejorative connation because of the text\u2019s apparent indifference to moral and ethical concerns.\nWritten by Kyounghye Kwon\nSelections from the Prince\nLicense: Public Domain\nNicolo Machiavelli, translated by W. K. Marriott\nINTRODUCTION\nNicolo Machiavelli was born at Florence on 3rd May 1469. He was the second son of Bernardo di Nicolo\nMachiavelli, a lawyer of some repute, and of Bartolommea di Stefano Nelli, his wife. Both parents were members of\nthe old Florentine nobility.\nHis life falls naturally into three periods, each of which\nsingularly enough constitutes a distinct and important era in the\nhistory of Florence. His youth was concurrent with the greatness\nof Florence as an Italian power under the guidance of Lorenzo\nde\u2019 Medici, Il Magnifico. The downfall of the Medici in Florence\noccurred in 1494, in which year Machiavelli entered the public\nservice. During his official career Florence was free under the\ngovernment of a Republic, which lasted until 1512, when the\nMedici returned to power, and Machiavelli lost his office. The\nMedici again ruled Florence from 1512 until 1527, when they\nwere once more driven out. This was the period of Machiavelli\u2019s\nliterary activity and increasing influence; but he died, within a\nfew weeks of the expulsion of the Medici, on 22nd June 1527, in\nhis fifty-eighth year, without having regained office.\nW. K. Marriott\nDEDICATION\nTo the Magnificent Lorenzo Di Piero De\u2019 Medici:\nThose who strive to obtain the good graces of a prince are ac-\ncustomed to come before him with such things as they hold most\nprecious, or in which they see him take most delight; whence\none sees horses, arms, cloth of gold, precious stones, and similar\nornaments presented to princes, worthy of their greatness.\nDesiring therefore to present myself to your Magnificence\nwith some testimony of my devotion towards you, I have not\nfound among my possessions anything which I hold more dear\nImage 11.15: Machiavelli Principe Cover Page |\nthan, or value so much as, the knowledge of the actions of great The cover of Machiavelli\u2019s The Prince.\nmen, acquired by long experience in contemporary affairs, and\na continual study of antiquity; which, having reflected upon it Author: User \u201cRJC\u201d\nwith great and prolonged diligence, I now send, digested into a Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\nlittle volume, to your Magnificence.\n245 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nAnd although I may consider this work unworthy of your countenance, nevertheless I trust much to your\nbenignity that it may be acceptable, seeing that it is not possible for me to make a better gift than to offer you the\nopportunity of understanding in the shortest time all that I have learnt in so many years, and\nwith so many troubles and dangers; which work I have not embellished with swelling or magnificent words,\nnor stuffed with rounded periods, nor with any extrinsic allurements or adornments whatever, with which so many\nare accustomed to embellish their works; for I have wished either that no honour should be given it, or else that the\ntruth of the matter and the weightiness of the theme shall make it acceptable.\nNor do I hold with those who regard it as a presumption if a man of low and humble condition dare to discuss\nand settle the concerns of princes; because, just as those who draw landscapes place themselves below in the plain\nto contemplate the nature of the mountains and of lofty places, and in order to contemplate the plains place them-\nselves upon high mountains, even so to understand the nature of the people it needs to be a prince, and to under-\nstand that of princes it needs to be of the people.\nTake then, your Magnificence, this little gift in the spirit in which I send it; wherein, if it be diligently read and\nconsidered by you, you will learn my extreme desire that you should attain that greatness which fortune and your\nother attributes promise. And if your Magnificence from the summit of your greatness will sometimes turn your\neyes to these lower regions, you will see how unmeritedly I suffer a great and continued malignity of fortune.\nCHAPTER X\nCONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH THE STRENGTH OF ALL PRINCIPALITIES\nOUGHT TO BE MEASURED\nIt is necessary to consider another point in examining the character of these principalities: that is, whether\na prince has such power that, in case of need, he can support himself with his own resources, or whether he has\nalways need of the assistance of others. And to make this quite clear I say that I consider those who are able to\nsupport themselves by their own resources who can, either by abundance of men or money, raise a sufficient army\nto join battle against any one who comes to attack them; and I consider those always to have need of others who\ncannot show themselves against the enemy in the field, but are forced to defend themselves by sheltering behind\nwalls. The first case has been discussed, but we will speak of it again should it recur. In the second case one can say\nnothing except to encourage such princes to provision and fortify their towns, and not on any account to defend the\ncountry. And whoever shall fortify his town well, and shall have managed the other concerns of his subjects in the\nway stated above, and to be often repeated, will never be attacked without great caution, for men are always adverse\nto enterprises where difficulties can be seen, and it will be seen not to be an easy thing to attack one who has his\ntown well fortified, and is not hated by his people.\nThe cities of Germany are absolutely free, they own but little country around them, and they yield obedience\nto the emperor when it suits them, nor do they fear this or any other power they may have near them, because they\nare fortified in such a way that every one thinks the taking of them by assault would be tedious and difficult, seeing\nthey have proper ditches and walls, they have sufficient artillery, and they always keep in public depots enough for\none year\u2019s eating, drinking, and firing. And beyond this, to keep the people quiet and without loss to the state, they\nalways have the means of giving work to the community in those labours that are the life and strength of the city,\nand on the pursuit of which the people are supported; they also hold military exercises in repute, and moreover\nhave many ordinances to uphold them.\nTherefore, a prince who has a strong city, and had not made himself odious, will not be attacked, or if any one\nshould attack he will only be driven off with disgrace; again, because that the affairs of this world are so changeable,\nit is almost impossible to keep an army a whole year in the field without being interfered with. And whoever should\nreply: If the people have property outside the city, and see it burnt, they will not remain patient, and the long siege\nand self-interest will make them forget their prince; to this I answer that a powerful and courageous prince will\novercome all such difficulties by giving at one time hope to his subjects that the evil will not be for long, at another\ntime fear of the cruelty of the enemy, then preserving himself adroitly from those subjects who seem to him to be\ntoo bold.\nFurther, the enemy would naturally on his arrival at once burn and ruin the country at the time when the spir-\nits of the people are still hot and ready for the defence; and, therefore, so much the less ought the prince to hesitate;\nbecause after a time, when spirits have cooled, the damage is already done, the ills are incurred, and there is no lon-\nger any remedy; and therefore they are so much the more ready to unite with their prince, he appearing to be under\nobligations to them now that their houses have been burnt and their possessions ruined in his defence. For it is the\nnature of men to be bound by the benefits they confer as much as by those they receive. Therefore, if everything is\nwell considered, it will not be difficult for a wise prince to keep the minds of his citizens steadfast from first to last,\nwhen he does not fail to support and defend them.\n246 The Prince\nCHAPTER XI\nCONCERNING ECCLESIASTICAL PRINCIPALITIES\nIt only remains now to speak of ecclesiastical principalities, touching which all difficulties are prior to getting\npossession, because they are acquired either by capacity or good fortune, and they can be held without either; for\nthey are sustained by the ancient ordinances of religion, which are so all-powerful, and of such a character that the\nprincipalities may be held no matter how their princes behave and live. These princes alone have states and do not\ndefend them; and they have subjects and do not rule them; and the states, although unguarded, are not taken from\nthem, and the subjects, although not ruled, do not care, and they have neither the desire nor the ability to alienate\nthemselves. Such principalities only are secure and happy. But being upheld by powers, to which the human mind\ncannot reach, I shall speak no more of them, because, being exalted and maintained by God, it would be the act of a\npresumptuous and rash man to discuss them.\nNevertheless, if any one should ask of me how comes it that the Church has attained such greatness in temporal\npower, seeing that from Alexander backwards the Italian potentates (not only those who have been called poten-\ntates, but every baron and lord, though the smallest) have valued the temporal power very slightly\u2014yet now a king\nof France trembles before it, and it has been able to drive him from Italy, and to ruin the Venetians\u2014 although this\nmay be very manifest, it does not appear to me superfluous to recall it in some measure to memory.\nBefore Charles, King of France, passed into Italy37, this country was under the dominion of the Pope, the Vene-\ntians, the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and the Florentines. These potentates had two principal anxieties: the\none, that no foreigner should enter Italy under arms; the other, that none of themselves should seize more territo-\nry. Those about whom there was the most anxiety were the Pope and the Venetians. To restrain the Venetians the\nunion of all the others was necessary, as it was for the defence of Ferrara; and to keep down the Pope they made use\nof the barons of Rome, who, being divided into two factions, Orsini and Colonnesi, had always a pretext for disor-\nder, and, standing with arms in their hands under the eyes of the Pontiff, kept the pontificate weak and powerless.\nAnd although there might arise sometimes a courageous pope, such as Sixtus, yet neither fortune nor wisdom could\nrid him of these annoyances. And the short life of a pope is also a cause of weakness; for in the ten years, which\nis the average life of a pope, he can with difficulty lower one of the factions; and if, so to speak, one people should\nalmost destroy the Colonnesi, another would arise hostile to the Orsini, who would support their opponents, and\nyet would not have time to ruin the Orsini. This was the reason why the temporal powers of the pope were little\nesteemed in Italy.\nAlexander the Sixth arose afterwards, who of all the pontiffs that have ever been showed how a pope with both\nmoney and arms was able to prevail; and through the instrumentality of the Duke Valentino, and by reason of the\nentry of the French, he brought about all those things which I have discussed above in the actions of the duke. And\nalthough his intention was not to aggrandize the Church, but the duke, nevertheless, what he did contributed to the\ngreatness of the Church, which, after his death and the ruin of the duke, became the heir to all his labours.\nPope Julius came afterwards and found the Church strong, possessing all the Romagna, the barons of Rome\nreduced to impotence, and, through the chastisements of Alexander, the factions wiped out; he also found the way\nopen to accumulate money in a manner such as had never been practised before Alexander\u2019s time. Such things Ju-\nlius not only followed, but improved upon, and he intended to gain Bologna, to ruin the Venetians, and to drive the\nFrench out of Italy. All of these enterprises prospered with him, and so much the more to his credit, inasmuch as he\ndid everything to strengthen the Church and not any private person. He kept also the Orsini and Colonnesi factions\nwithin the bounds in which he found them; and although there was among them some mind to make disturbance,\nnevertheless he held two things firm: the one, the greatness of the Church, with which he terrified them; and the\nother, not allowing them to have their own cardinals, who caused the disorders among them. For whenever these\nfactions have their cardinals they do not remain quiet for long, because cardinals foster the factions in Rome and\nout of it, and the barons are compelled to support them, and thus from the ambitions of prelates arise disorders and\ntumults among the barons. For these reasons his Holiness Pope Leo38 found the pontificate most powerful, and it\nis to be hoped that, if others made it great in arms, he will make it still greater and more venerated by his goodness\nand infinite other virtues.\nCHAPTER XIV\nTHAT WHICH CONCERNS A PRINCE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ART OF WAR\nA prince ought to have no other aim or thought, nor select anything else for his study, than war and its rules\nand discipline; for this is the sole art that belongs to him who rules, and it is of such force that it not only upholds\n37 Charles VIII invaded Italy in 1494.\n38 Pope Leo X was the Cardinal de\u2019 Medici.\n247 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nthose who are born princes, but it often enables men to rise from a private station to that rank. And, on the con-\ntrary, it is seen that when princes have thought more of ease than of arms they have lost their states. And the first\ncause of your losing it is to neglect this art; and what enables you to acquire a state is to be master of the art. Fran-\ncesco Sforza, through being martial, from a private person became Duke of Milan; and the sons, through avoiding\nthe hardships and troubles of arms, from dukes became private persons. For among other evils which being un-\narmed brings you, it causes you to be despised, and this is one of those ignominies against which a prince ought to\nguard himself, as is shown later on. Because there is nothing proportionate between the armed and the unarmed;\nand it is not reasonable that he who is armed should yield obedience willingly to him who is unarmed, or that the\nunarmed man should be secure among armed servants. Because, there being in the one disdain and in the other\nsuspicion, it is not possible for them to work well together. And therefore a prince who does not understand the\nart of war, over and above the other misfortunes already mentioned, cannot be respected by his soldiers, nor can\nhe rely on them. He ought never, therefore, to have out of his thoughts this subject of war, and in peace he should\naddict himself more to its exercise than in war; this he can do in two ways, the one by action, the other by study.\nAs regards action, he ought above all things to keep his men well organized and drilled, to follow incessantly\nthe chase, by which he accustoms his body to hardships, and learns something of the nature of localities, and gets\nto find out how the mountains rise, how the valleys open out, how the plains lie, and to understand the nature of\nrivers and marshes, and in all this to take the greatest care. Which knowledge is useful in two ways. Firstly, he learns\nto know his country, and is better able to undertake its defence; afterwards, by means of the knowledge and ob-\nservation of that locality, he understands with ease any other which it may be necessary for him to study hereafter;\nbecause the hills, valleys, and plains, and rivers and marshes that are, for instance, in Tuscany, have a certain resem-\nblance to those of other countries, so that with a knowledge of the aspect of one country one can easily arrive at a\nknowledge of others. And the prince that lacks this skill lacks the essential which it is desirable that a captain should\npossess, for it teaches him to surprise his enemy, to select quarters, to lead armies, to array the battle, to besiege\ntowns to advantage.\nPhilopoemen,39Prince of the Achaeans, among other praises which writers have bestowed on him, is commend-\ned because in time of peace he never had anything in his mind but the rules of war; and when he was in the country\nwith friends, he often stopped and reasoned with them: \u201cIf the enemy should be upon that hill, and we should find\nourselves here with our army, with whom would be the advantage? How should one best advance to meet him,\nkeeping the ranks? If we should wish to retreat, how ought we to pursue?\u201d And he would set forth to them, as he\nwent, all the chances that could befall an army; he would listen to their opinion and state his, confirming it with\nreasons, so that by these continual discussions there could never arise, in time of war, any unexpected circumstanc-\nes that he could not deal with.\nBut to exercise the intellect the prince should read histories, and study there the actions of illustrious men,\nto see how they have borne themselves in war, to examine the causes of their victories and defeat, so as to avoid\nthe latter and imitate the former; and above all do as an illustrious man did, who took as an exemplar one who\nhad been praised and famous before him, and whose achievements and deeds he always kept in his mind, as it is\nsaid Alexander the Great imitated Achilles, Caesar Alexander, Scipio Cyrus. And whoever reads the life of Cyrus,\nwritten by Xenophon, will recognize afterwards in the life of Scipio how that imitation was his glory, and how in\nchastity, affability, humanity, and liberality Scipio conformed to those things which have been written of Cyrus by\nXenophon. A wise prince ought to observe some such rules, and never in peaceful times stand idle, but increase his\nresources with industry in such a way that they may be available to him in adversity, so that if fortune chances it\nmay find him prepared to resist her blows.\nCHAPTER XV\nCONCERNING THINGS FOR WHICH MEN, AND ESPECIALLY PRINCES, ARE PRAISED OR BLAMED\nIt remains now to see what ought to be the rules of conduct for a prince towards subject and friends. And as\nI know that many have written on this point, I expect I shall be considered presumptuous in mentioning it again,\nespecially as in discussing it I shall depart from the methods of other people. But, it being my intention to write a\nthing which shall be useful to him who apprehends it, it appears to me more appropriate to follow up the real truth\nof the matter than the imagination of it; for many have pictured republics and principalities which in fact have\nnever been known or seen, because how one lives is so far distant from how one ought to live, that he who neglects\nwhat is done for what ought to be done, sooner effects his ruin than his preservation; for a man who wishes to act\nentirely up to his professions of virtue soon meets with what destroys him among so much that is evil.\nHence it is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to know how to do wrong, and to make use of it or\nnot according to necessity. Therefore, putting on one side imaginary things concerning a prince, and discussing\n39 Philopoemen, \u201cthe last of the Greeks,\u201d born 252 B.C., died 183 B.C.\n248 The Prince\nthose which are real, I say that all men when they are spoken of, and chiefly princes for being more highly placed,\nare remarkable for some of those qualities which bring them either blame or praise; and thus it is that one is reputed\nliberal, another miserly, using a Tuscan term (because an avaricious person in our language is still he who desires to\npossess by robbery, whilst we call one miserly who deprives himself too much of the use of his own); one is reputed\ngenerous, one rapacious; one cruel, one compassionate; one faithless, another faithful; one effeminate and cowardly,\nanother bold and brave; one affable, another haughty; one lascivious, another chaste; one sincere, another cunning;\none hard, another easy; one grave, another frivolous; one religious, another unbelieving, and the like. And I know\nthat every one will confess that it would be most praiseworthy in a prince to exhibit all the above qualities that are\nconsidered good; but because they can neither be entirely possessed nor observed, for human conditions do not\npermit it, it is necessary for him to be sufficiently prudent that he may know how to avoid the reproach of those vic-\nes which would lose him his state; and also to keep himself, if it be possible, from those which would not lose him\nit; but this not being possible, he may with less hesitation abandon himself to them. And again, he need not make\nhimself uneasy at incurring a reproach for those vices without which the state can only be saved with difficulty, for\nif everything is considered carefully, it will be found that something which looks like virtue, if followed, would be\nhis ruin; whilst something else, which looks like vice, yet followed brings him security and prosperity.\nCHAPTER XVI\nCONCERNING LIBERALITY AND MEANNESS\nCommencing then with the first of the above-named characteristics, I say that it would be well to be reputed\nliberal. Nevertheless, liberality exercised in a way that does not bring you the reputation for it, injures you; for if one\nexercises it honestly and as it should be exercised, it may not become known, and you will not avoid the reproach of\nits opposite. Therefore, any one wishing to maintain among men the name of liberal is obliged to avoid no attribute\nof magnificence; so that a prince thus inclined will consume in such acts all his property, and will be compelled in\nthe end, if he wish to maintain the name of liberal, to unduly weigh down his people, and tax them, and do ev-\nerything he can to get money. This will soon make him odious to his subjects, and becoming poor he will be little\nvalued by any one; thus, with his liberality, having offended many and rewarded few, he is affected by the very first\ntrouble and imperilled by whatever may be the first danger; recognizing this himself, and wishing to draw back\nfrom it, he runs at once into the reproach of being miserly.\nTherefore, a prince, not being able to exercise this virtue of liberality in such a way that it is recognized, ex-\ncept to his cost, if he is wise he ought not to fear the reputation of being mean, for in time he will come to be more\nconsidered than if liberal, seeing that with his economy his revenues are enough, that he can defend himself against\nall attacks, and is able to engage in enterprises without burdening his people; thus it comes to pass that he exercises\nliberality towards all from whom he does not take, who are numberless, and meanness towards those to whom he\ndoes not give, who are few.\nWe have not seen great things done in our time except by those who have been considered mean; the rest have\nfailed. Pope Julius the Second was assisted in reaching the papacy by a reputation for liberality, yet he did not strive\nafterwards to keep it up, when he made war on the King of France; and he made many wars without imposing any\nextraordinary tax on his subjects, for he supplied his additional expenses out of his long thriftiness. The present\nKing of Spain would not have undertaken or conquered in so many enterprises if he had been reputed liberal. A\nprince, therefore, provided that he has not to rob his subjects, that he can defend himself, that he does not become\npoor and abject, that he is not forced to become rapacious, ought to hold of little account a reputation for being\nmean, for it is one of those vices which will enable him to govern.\nAnd if any one should say: Caesar obtained empire by liberality, and many others have reached the highest\npositions by having been liberal, and by being considered so, I answer: Either you are a prince in fact, or in a way to\nbecome one. In the first case this liberality is dangerous, in the second it is very necessary to be considered liberal;\nand Caesar was one of those who wished to become pre-eminent in Rome; but if he had survived after becoming so,\nand had not moderated his expenses, he would have destroyed his government. And if any one should reply: Many\nhave been princes, and have done great things with armies, who have been considered very liberal, I reply: Either a\nprince spends that which is his own or his subjects\u2019 or else that of others. In the first case he ought to be sparing, in\nthe second he ought not to neglect any opportunity for liberality. And to the prince who goes forth with his army,\nsupporting it by pillage, sack, and extortion, handling that which belongs to others, this liberality is necessary,\notherwise he would not be followed by soldiers. And of that which is neither yours nor your subjects\u2019 you can be a\nready giver, as were Cyrus, Caesar, and Alexander; because it does not take away your reputation if you squander\nthat of others, but adds to it; it is only squandering your own that injures you.\nAnd there is nothing wastes so rapidly as liberality, for even whilst you exercise it you lose the power to do\nso, and so become either poor or despised, or else, in avoiding poverty, rapacious and hated. And a prince should\n249 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nguard himself, above all things, against being despised and hated; and liberality leads you to both. Therefore it is\nwiser to have a reputation for meanness which brings reproach without hatred, than to be compelled through seek-\ning a reputation for liberality to incur a name for rapacity which begets reproach with hatred.\nCHAPTER XVII\nCONCERNING CRUELTY AND CLEMENCY,\nAND WHETHER IT IS BETTER TO BE LOVED THAN FEARED\nComing now to the other qualities mentioned above, I say that every prince ought to desire to be considered\nclement and not cruel. Nevertheless he ought to take care not to misuse this clemency. Cesare Borgia was consid-\nered cruel; notwithstanding, his cruelty reconciled the Romagna, unified it, and restored it to peace and loyalty.\nAnd if this be rightly considered, he will be seen to have been much more merciful than the Florentine people, who,\nto avoid a reputation for cruelty, permitted Pistoia to be destroyed.40 Therefore a prince, so long as he keeps his\nsubjects united and loyal, ought not to mind the reproach of cruelty; because with a few examples he will be more\nmerciful than those who, through too much mercy, allow disorders to arise, from which follow murders or robber-\nies; for these are wont to injure the whole people, whilst those executions which originate with a prince offend the\nindividual only.\nAnd of all princes, it is impossible for the new prince to avoid the imputation of cruelty, owing to new states\nbeing full of dangers. Hence Virgil, through the mouth of Dido, excuses the inhumanity of her reign owing to its\nbeing new, saying:\n\u201cRes dura, et regni novitas me talia cogunt\nMoliri, et late fines custode tueri.\u201d41\nNevertheless he ought to be slow to believe and to act, nor should he himself show fear, but proceed in a tem-\nperate manner with prudence and humanity, so that too much confidence may not make him incautious and too\nmuch distrust render him intolerable.\nUpon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be an-\nswered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to\nbe feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of\nmen, that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely;\nthey will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when\nit approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other\nprecautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind,\nmay indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scru-\nple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which,\nowing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread\nof punishment which never fails.\nNevertheless a prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he does not win love, he avoids hatred; because\nhe can endure very well being feared whilst he is not hated, which will always be as long as he abstains from the\nproperty of his citizens and subjects and from their women. But when it is necessary for him to proceed against the\nlife of someone, he must do it on proper justification and for manifest cause, but above all things he must keep his\nhands off the property of others, because men more quickly forget the death of their father than the loss of their\npatrimony. Besides, pretexts for taking away the property are never wanting; for he who has once begun to live by\nrobbery will always find pretexts for seizing what belongs to others; but reasons for taking life, on the contrary, are\nmore difficult to find and sooner lapse. But when a prince is with his army, and has under control a multitude of\nsoldiers, then it is quite necessary for him to disregard the reputation of cruelty, for without it he would never hold\nhis army united or disposed to its duties.\nAmong the wonderful deeds of Hannibal this one is enumerated: that having led an enormous army, composed\nof many various races of men, to fight in foreign lands, no dissensions arose either among them or against the\nprince, whether in his bad or in his good fortune. This arose from nothing else than his inhuman cruelty, which,\nwith his boundless valour, made him revered and terrible in the sight of his soldiers, but without that cruelty, his\nother virtues were not sufficient to produce this effect. And short-sighted writers admire his deeds from one point\nof view and from another condemn the principal cause of them. That it is true his other virtues would not have\nbeen sufficient for him may be proved by the case of Scipio, that most excellent man, not only of his own times but\nwithin the memory of man, against whom, nevertheless, his army rebelled in Spain; this arose from nothing but his\n40 During the rioting between the Cancellieri and Panciatichi factions in 1502 and 1503.\n41 . . . against my will, my fate \/ A throne unsettled, and an infant state, \/ Bid me defend my realms with all my pow\u2019rs, \/And guard\nwith these severities my shores. (trans. Christopher Pitt)\n250 The Prince\ntoo great forbearance, which gave his soldiers more license than is consistent with military discipline. For this he\nwas upbraided in the Senate by Fabius Maximus, and called the corrupter of the Roman soldiery. The Locrians were\nlaid waste by a legate of Scipio, yet they were not avenged by him, nor was the insolence of the legate punished, ow-\ning entirely to his easy nature. Insomuch that someone in the Senate, wishing to excuse him, said there were many\nmen who knew much better how not to err than to correct the errors of others. This disposition, if he had been con-\ntinued in the command, would have destroyed in time the fame and glory of Scipio; but, he being under the control\nof the Senate, this injurious characteristic not only concealed itself, but contributed to his glory.\nReturning to the question of being feared or loved, I come to the conclusion that, men loving according to their\nown will and fearing according to that of the prince, a wise prince should establish himself on that which is in his\nown control and not in that of others; he must endeavour only to avoid hatred, as is noted.\nCHAPTER XVIII\nCONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH PRINCES SHOULD KEEP FAITH42\nEvery one admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith, and to live with integrity and not with craft.\nNevertheless our experience has been that those princes who have done great things have held good faith of little\naccount, and have known how to circumvent the intellect of men by craft, and in the end have overcome those\nwho have relied on their word. You must know there are two ways of contesting,43 the one by the law, the other by\nforce; the first method is proper to men, the second to beasts; but because the first is frequently not sufficient, it is\nnecessary to have recourse to the second. Therefore it is necessary for a prince to understand how to avail himself\nof the beast and the man. This has been figuratively taught to princes by ancient writers, who describe how Achilles\nand many other princes of old were given to the Centaur Chiron to nurse, who brought them up in his discipline;\nwhich means solely that, as they had for a teacher one who was half beast and half man, so it is necessary for a\nprince to know how to make use of both natures, and that one without the other is not durable. A prince, therefore,\nbeing compelled knowingly to adopt the beast, ought to choose the fox and the lion; because the lion cannot defend\nhimself against snares and the fox cannot defend himself against wolves. Therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to dis-\ncover the snares and a lion to terrify the wolves. Those who rely simply on the lion do not understand what they are\nabout. Therefore a wise lord cannot, nor ought he to, keep faith when such observance may be turned against him,\nand when the reasons that caused him to pledge it exist no longer. If men were entirely good this precept would not\nhold, but because they are bad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are not bound to observe it with them. Nor\nwill there ever be wanting to a prince legitimate reasons to excuse this non-observance. Of this endless modern ex-\namples could be given, showing how many treaties and engagements have been made void and of no effect through\nthe faithlessness of princes; and he who has known best how to employ the fox has succeeded best.\nBut it is necessary to know well how to disguise this characteristic, and to be a great pretender and dissembler;\nand men are so simple, and so subject to present necessities, that he who seeks to deceive will always find someone\nwho will allow himself to be deceived. One recent example I cannot pass over in silence. Alexander the Sixth did\nnothing else but deceive men, nor ever thought of doing otherwise, and he always found victims; for there never was\na man who had greater power in asserting, or who with greater oaths would affirm a thing, yet would observe it less;\nnevertheless his deceits always succeeded according to his wishes,44 because he well understood this side of mankind.\nTherefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities I have enumerated, but it is very necessary to\nappear to have them. And I shall dare to say this also, that to have them and always to observe them is injurious, and\nthat to appear to have them is useful; to appear merciful, faithful, humane, religious, upright, and to be so, but with a\nmind so framed that should you require not to be so, you may be able and know how to change to the opposite.\nAnd you have to understand this, that a prince, especially a new one, cannot observe all those things for which\nmen are esteemed, being often forced, in order to maintain the state, to act contrary to fidelity,45friendship, human-\n42 \u201cThe present chapter has given greater offence than any other portion of Machiavelli\u2019s writings.\u201d Burd, \u201cIl Principe,\u201d p. 297.\n43 \u201cContesting,\u201d i.e. \u201cstriving for mastery.\u201d Mr Burd points out that this passage is imitated directly from Cicero\u2019s \u201cDe Officiis\u201d: \u201cNam\ncum sint duo genera decertandi, unum per disceptationem, alterum per vim; cumque illud proprium sit hominis, hoc beluarum; confugien-\ndum est ad posterius, si uti non licet superiore.\u201d\n44 \u201cNondimanco sempre gli succederono gli inganni (ad votum).\u201d The words \u201cad votum\u201d are omitted in the Testina addition, 1550.\nAlexander never did what he said, \/ Cesare never said what he did.

It is noteworthy that\nthese two phrases, \u201ccontro alla fede\u201d and \u201ctutto fede,\u201d were omitted in the Testina edition, which was published with the sanction of the papal\nauthorities. It may be that the meaning attached to the word \u201cfede\u201d was \u201cthe faith,\u201d i.e. the Catholic creed, and not as rendered here \u201cfidelity\u201d\nand \u201cfaithful.\u201d Observe that the word \u201creligione\u201d was suffered to stand in the text of the Testina, being used to signify indifferently every shade\nof belief, as witness \u201cthe religion,\u201d a phrase inevitably employed to designate the Huguenot heresy. South in his Sermon IX, p. 69, ed. 1843,\ncomments on this passage as follows: \u201cThat great patron and Coryphaeus of this tribe, Nicolo Machiavel, laid down this for a master rule in\n251 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nity, and religion. Therefore it is necessary for him to have a mind ready to turn itself accordingly as the winds and\nvariations of fortune force it, yet, as I have said above, not to diverge from the good if he can avoid doing so, but, if\ncompelled, then to know how to set about it.\nFor this reason a prince ought to take care that he never lets anything slip from his lips that is not replete\nwith the above-named five qualities, that he may appear to him who sees and hears him altogether merciful,\nfaithful, humane, upright, and religious. There is nothing more necessary to appear to have than this last qual-\nity, inasmuch as men judge generally more by the eye than by the hand, because it belongs to everybody to see\nyou, to few to come in touch with you. Every one sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are, and\nthose few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many, who have the majesty of the state to defend\nthem; and in the actions of all men, and especially of princes, which it is not prudent to challenge, one judges\nby the result.\nFor that reason, let a prince have the credit of conquering and holding his state, the means will always be con-\nsidered honest, and he will be praised by everybody; because the vulgar are always taken by what a thing seems to\nbe and by what comes of it; and in the world there are only the vulgar, for the few find a place there only when the\nmany have no ground to rest on.\nOne prince46 of the present time, whom it is not well to name, never preaches anything else but peace and good\nfaith, and to both he is most hostile, and either, if he had kept it, would have deprived him of reputation and king-\ndom many a time.\nCHAPTER XIX\nTHAT ONE SHOULD AVOID BEING DESPISED AND HATED\nNow, concerning the characteristics of which mention is made above, I have spoken of the more important\nones, the others I wish to discuss briefly under this generality, that the prince must consider, as has been in part said\nbefore, how to avoid those things which will make him hated or contemptible; and as often as he shall have suc-\nceeded he will have fulfilled his part, and he need not fear any danger in other reproaches.\nIt makes him hated above all things, as I have said, to be rapacious, and to be a violator of the property and\nwomen of his subjects, from both of which he must abstain. And when neither their property nor their honor is\ntouched, the majority of men live content, and he has only to contend with the ambition of a few, whom he can\ncurb with ease in many ways.\nIt makes him contemptible to be considered fickle, frivolous, effeminate, mean-spirited, irresolute, from all\nof which a prince should guard himself as from a rock; and he should endeavour to show in his actions greatness,\ncourage, gravity, and fortitude; and in his private dealings with his subjects let him show that his judgments are ir-\nrevocable, and maintain himself in such reputation that no one can hope either to deceive him or to get round him.\nThat prince is highly esteemed who conveys this impression of himself, and he who is highly esteemed is not\neasily conspired against; for, provided it is well known that he is an excellent man and revered by his people, he can\nonly be attacked with difficulty. For this reason a prince ought to have two fears, one from within, on account of\nhis subjects, the other from without, on account of external powers. From the latter he is defended by being well\narmed and having good allies, and if he is well armed he will have good friends, and affairs will always remain quiet\nwithin when they are quiet without, unless they should have been already disturbed by conspiracy; and even should\naffairs outside be disturbed, if he has carried out his preparations and has lived as I have said, as long as he does not\ndespair, he will resist every attack, as I said Nabis the Spartan did.\nBut concerning his subjects, when affairs outside are disturbed he has only to fear that they will conspire secret-\nly, from which a prince can easily secure himself by avoiding being hated and despised, and by keeping the people\nsatisfied with him, which it is most necessary for him to accomplish, as I said above at length. And one of the most\nefficacious remedies that a prince can have against conspiracies is not to be hated and despised by the people, for\nhe who conspires against a prince always expects to please them by his removal; but when the conspirator can only\nlook forward to offending them, he will not have the courage to take such a course, for the difficulties that confront\na conspirator are infinite. And as experience shows, many have been the conspiracies, but few have been successful;\nbecause he who conspires cannot act alone, nor can he take a companion except from those whom he believes to\nbe malcontents, and as soon as you have opened your mind to a malcontent you have given him the material with\nwhich to content himself, for by denouncing you he can look for every advantage; so that, seeing the gain from this\ncourse to be assured, and seeing the other to be doubtful and full of dangers, he must be a very rare friend, or a\nthoroughly obstinate enemy of the prince, to keep faith with you.\nhis political scheme: \u2018That the show of religion was helpful to the politician, but the reality of it hurtful and pernicious.\u2019\u201d\n46 Ferdinand of Aragon. \u201cWhen Machiavelli was writing \u2018The Prince\u2019 it would have been clearly impossible to mention Ferdinand\u2019s\nname here without giving offence.\u201d Burd\u2019s \u201cIl Principe,\u201d p. 308.\n252 The Prince\nAnd, to reduce the matter into a small compass, I say that, on the side of the conspirator, there is nothing but\nfear, jealousy, prospect of punishment to terrify him; but on the side of the prince there is the majesty of the princi-\npality, the laws, the protection of friends and the state to defend him; so that, adding to all these things the popular\ngoodwill, it is impossible that any one should be so rash as to conspire. For whereas in general the conspirator has\nto fear before the execution of his plot, in this case he has also to fear the sequel to the crime; because on account of\nit he has the people for an enemy, and thus cannot hope for any escape.\nEndless examples could be given on this subject, but I will be content with one, brought to pass within the\nmemory of our fathers. Messer Annibale Bentivogli, who was prince in Bologna (grandfather of the present Anni-\nbale), having been murdered by the Canneschi, who had conspired against him, not one of his family survived but\nMesser Giovanni,47 who was in childhood: immediately after his assassination the people rose and murdered all the\nCanneschi. This sprung from the popular goodwill which the house of Bentivogli enjoyed in those days in Bologna;\nwhich was so great that, although none remained there after the death of Annibale who was able to rule the state,\nthe Bolognese, having information that there was one of the Bentivogli family in Florence, who up to that time had\nbeen considered the son of a blacksmith, sent to Florence for him and gave him the government of their city, and it\nwas ruled by him until Messer Giovanni came in due course to the government.\nFor this reason I consider that a prince ought to reckon conspiracies of little account when his people hold him\nin esteem; but when it is hostile to him, and bears hatred towards him, he ought to fear everything and everybody.\nAnd well-ordered states and wise princes have taken every care not to drive the nobles to desperation, and to keep\nthe people satisfied and contented, for this is one of the most important objects a prince can have.\nAmong the best ordered and governed kingdoms of our times is France, and in it are found many good insti-\ntutions on which depend the liberty and security of the king; of these the first is the parliament and its authority,\nbecause he who founded the kingdom, knowing the ambition of the nobility and their boldness, considered that a\nbit to their mouths would be necessary to hold them in; and, on the other side, knowing the hatred of the people,\nfounded in fear, against the nobles, he wished to protect them, yet he was not anxious for this to be the particular\ncare of the king; therefore, to take away the reproach which he would be liable to from the nobles for favouring the\npeople, and from the people for favouring the nobles, he set up an arbiter, who should be one who could beat down\nthe great and favour the lesser without reproach to the king. Neither could you have a better or a more prudent\narrangement, or a greater source of security to the king and kingdom. From this one can draw another important\nconclusion, that princes ought to leave affairs of reproach to the management of others, and keep those of grace in\ntheir own hands. And further, I consider that a prince ought to cherish the nobles, but not so as to make himself\nhated by the people.\nIt may appear, perhaps, to some who have examined the lives and deaths of the Roman emperors that many of\nthem would be an example contrary to my opinion, seeing that some of them lived nobly and showed great qualities\nof soul, nevertheless they have lost their empire or have been killed by subjects who have conspired against them.\nWishing, therefore, to answer these objections, I will recall the characters of some of the emperors, and will show\nthat the causes of their ruin were not different to those alleged by me; at the same time I will only submit for con-\nsideration those things that are noteworthy to him who studies the affairs of those times.\nIt seems to me sufficient to take all those emperors who succeeded to the empire from Marcus the philosopher\ndown to Maximinus; they were Marcus and his son Commodus, Pertinax, Julian, Severus and his son Antoninus\nCaracalla, Macrinus, Heliogabalus, Alexander, and Maximinus.\nThere is first to note that, whereas in other principalities the ambition of the nobles and the insolence of the peo-\nple only have to be contended with, the Roman emperors had a third difficulty in having to put up with the cruelty\nand avarice of their soldiers, a matter so beset with difficulties that it was the ruin of many; for it was a hard thing to\ngive satisfaction both to soldiers and people; because the people loved peace, and for this reason they loved the un-\naspiring prince, whilst the soldiers loved the warlike prince who was bold, cruel, and rapacious, which qualities they\nwere quite willing he should exercise upon the people, so that they could get double pay and give vent to their own\ngreed and cruelty. Hence it arose that those emperors were always overthrown who, either by birth or training, had\nno great authority, and most of them, especially those who came new to the principality, recognizing the difficulty of\nthese two opposing humours, were inclined to give satisfaction to the soldiers, caring little about injuring the people.\nWhich course was necessary, because, as princes cannot help being hated by someone, they ought, in the first place,\nto avoid being hated by every one, and when they cannot compass this, they ought to endeavour with the utmost\ndiligence to avoid the hatred of the most powerful. Therefore, those emperors who through inexperience had need\nof special favour adhered more readily to the soldiers than to the people; a course which turned out advantageous to\nthem or not, accordingly as the prince knew how to maintain authority over them.\n47 Giovanni Bentivogli, born in Bologna 1438, died at Milan 1508. He ruled Bologna from 1462 to 1506. Machiavelli\u2019s strong condem-\nnation of conspiracies may get its edge from his own very recent experience (February 1513), when he had been arrested and tortured for his\nalleged complicity in the Boscoli conspiracy.\n253 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nFrom these causes it arose that Marcus, Pertinax, and Alexander, being all men of modest life, lovers of justice,\nenemies to cruelty, humane, and benignant, came to a sad end except Marcus; he alone lived and died honoured,\nbecause he had succeeded to the throne by hereditary title, and owed nothing either to the soldiers or the people;\nand afterwards, being possessed of many virtues which made him respected, he always kept both orders in their\nplaces whilst he lived, and was neither hated nor despised.\nBut Pertinax was created emperor against the wishes of the soldiers, who, being accustomed to live licentiously\nunder Commodus, could not endure the honest life to which Pertinax wished to reduce them; thus, having given\ncause for hatred, to which hatred there was added contempt for his old age, he was overthrown at the very begin-\nning of his administration. And here it should be noted that hatred is acquired as much by good works as by bad\nones, therefore, as I said before, a prince wishing to keep his state is very often forced to do evil; for when that body\nis corrupt whom you think you have need of to maintain yourself\u2014it may be either the people or the soldiers or the\nnobles\u2014you have to submit to its humours and to gratify them, and then good works will do you harm.\nBut let us come to Alexander, who was a man of such great goodness, that among the other praises which are\naccorded him is this, that in the fourteen years he held the empire no one was ever put to death by him unjudged;\nnevertheless, being considered effeminate and a man who allowed himself to be governed by his mother, he became\ndespised, the army conspired against him, and murdered him.\nTurning now to the opposite characters of Commodus, Severus, Antoninus Caracalla, and Maximinus, you will\nfind them all cruel and rapacious-men who, to satisfy their soldiers, did not hesitate to commit every kind of iniq-\nuity against the people; and all, except Severus, came to a bad end; but in Severus there was so much valour that,\nkeeping the soldiers friendly, although the people were oppressed by him, he reigned successfully; for his valour\nmade him so much admired in the sight of the soldiers and people that the latter were kept in a way astonished and\nawed and the former respectful and satisfied. And because the actions of this man, as a new prince, were great, I\nwish to show briefly that he knew well how to counterfeit the fox and the lion, which natures, as I said above, it is\nnecessary for a prince to imitate.\nKnowing the sloth of the Emperor Julian, he persuaded the army in Sclavonia, of which he was captain, that it\nwould be right to go to Rome and avenge the death of Pertinax, who had been killed by the praetorian soldiers; and\nunder this pretext, without appearing to aspire to the throne, he moved the army on Rome, and reached Italy before\nit was known that he had started. On his arrival at Rome, the Senate, through fear, elected him emperor and killed\nJulian. After this there remained for Severus, who wished to make himself master of the whole empire, two difficul-\nties; one in Asia, where Niger, head of the Asiatic army, had caused himself to be proclaimed emperor; the other in\nthe west where Albinus was, who also aspired to the throne. And as he considered it dangerous to declare himself\nhostile to both, he decided to attack Niger and to deceive Albinus. To the latter he wrote that, being elected emperor\nby the Senate, he was willing to share that dignity with him and sent him the title of Caesar; and, moreover, that the\nSenate had made Albinus his colleague; which things were accepted by Albinus as true.\nBut after Severus had conquered and killed Niger, and settled oriental affairs, he returned to Rome and com-\nplained to the Senate that Albinus, little recognizing the benefits that he had received from him, had by treachery\nsought to murder him, and for this ingratitude he was compelled to punish him. Afterwards he sought him out in\nFrance, and took from him his government and life. He who will, therefore, carefully examine the actions of this\nman will find him a most valiant lion and a most cunning fox; he will find him feared and respected by every one,\nand not hated by the army; and it need not be wondered at that he, a new man, was able to hold the empire so well,\nbecause his supreme renown always protected him from that hatred which the people might have conceived against\nhim for his violence.\nBut his son Antoninus was a most eminent man, and had very excellent qualities, which made him admira-\nble in the sight of the people and acceptable to the soldiers, for he was a warlike man, most enduring of fatigue, a\ndespiser of all delicate food and other luxuries, which caused him to be beloved by the armies. Nevertheless, his\nferocity and cruelties were so great and so unheard of that, after endless single murders, he killed a large number of\nthe people of Rome and all those of Alexandria. He became hated by the whole world, and also feared by those he\nhad around him, to such an extent that he was murdered in the midst of his army by a centurion. And here it must\nbe noted that such-like deaths, which are deliberately inflicted with a resolved and desperate courage, cannot be\navoided by princes, because any one who does not fear to die can inflict them; but a prince may fear them the less\nbecause they are very rare; he has only to be careful not to do any grave injury to those whom he employs or has\naround him in the service of the state. Antoninus had not taken this care, but had contumeliously killed a brother\nof that centurion, whom also he daily threatened, yet retained in his bodyguard; which, as it turned out, was a rash\nthing to do, and proved the emperor\u2019s ruin.\nBut let us come to Commodus, to whom it should have been very easy to hold the empire, for, being the son of\nMarcus, he had inherited it, and he had only to follow in the footsteps of his father to please his people and soldiers;\nbut, being by nature cruel and brutal, he gave himself up to amusing the soldiers and corrupting them, so that he\n254 The Prince\nmight indulge his rapacity upon the people; on the other hand, not maintaining his dignity, often descending to\nthe theatre to compete with gladiators, and doing other vile things, little worthy of the imperial majesty, he fell into\ncontempt with the soldiers, and being hated by one party and despised by the other, he was conspired against and\nwas killed.\nIt remains to discuss the character of Maximinus. He was a very warlike man, and the armies, being disgusted\nwith the effeminacy of Alexander, of whom I have already spoken, killed him and elected Maximinus to the throne.\nThis he did not possess for long, for two things made him hated and despised; the one, his having kept sheep in\nThrace, which brought him into contempt (it being well known to all, and considered a great indignity by every\none), and the other, his having at the accession to his dominions deferred going to Rome and taking possession of\nthe imperial seat; he had also gained a reputation for the utmost ferocity by having, through his prefects in Rome\nand elsewhere in the empire, practised many cruelties, so that the whole world was moved to anger at the meanness\nof his birth and to fear at his barbarity. First Africa rebelled, then the Senate with all the people of Rome, and all\nItaly conspired against him, to which may be added his own army; this latter, besieging Aquileia and meeting with\ndifficulties in taking it, were disgusted with his cruelties, and fearing him less when they found so many against\nhim, murdered him.\nI do not wish to discuss Heliogabalus, Macrinus, or Julian, who, being thoroughly contemptible, were quickly\nwiped out; but I will bring this discourse to a conclusion by saying that princes in our times have this difficulty of\ngiving inordinate satisfaction to their soldiers in a far less degree, because, notwithstanding one has to give them\nsome indulgence, that is soon done; none of these princes have armies that are veterans in the governance and\nadministration of provinces, as were the armies of the Roman Empire; and whereas it was then more necessary to\ngive satisfaction to the soldiers than to the people, it is now more necessary to all princes, except the Turk and the\nSoldan, to satisfy the people rather the soldiers, because the people are the more powerful.\nFrom the above I have excepted the Turk, who always keeps round him twelve thousand infantry and fifteen\nthousand cavalry on which depend the security and strength of the kingdom, and it is necessary that, putting aside\nevery consideration for the people, he should keep them his friends. The kingdom of the Soldan is similar; being\nentirely in the hands of soldiers, it follows again that, without regard to the people, he must keep them his friends.\nBut you must note that the state of the Soldan is unlike all other principalities, for the reason that it is like the\nChristian pontificate, which cannot be called either an hereditary or a newly formed principality; because the sons\nof the old prince are not the heirs, but he who is elected to that position by those who have authority, and the sons\nremain only noblemen. And this being an ancient custom, it cannot be called a new principality, because there are\nnone of those difficulties in it that are met with in new ones; for although the prince is new, the constitution of the\nstate is old, and it is framed so as to receive him as if he were its hereditary lord.\nBut returning to the subject of our discourse, I say that whoever will consider it will acknowledge that either\nhatred or contempt has been fatal to the above-named emperors, and it will be recognized also how it happened\nthat, a number of them acting in one way and a number in another, only one in each way came to a happy end and\nthe rest to unhappy ones. Because it would have been useless and dangerous for Pertinax and Alexander, being new\nprinces, to imitate Marcus, who was heir to the principality; and likewise it would have been utterly destructive to\nCaracalla, Commodus, and Maximinus to have imitated Severus, they not having sufficient valour to enable them\nto tread in his footsteps. Therefore a prince, new to the principality, cannot imitate the actions of Marcus, nor,\nagain, is it necessary to follow those of Severus, but he ought to take from Severus those parts which are necessary\nto found his state, and from Marcus those which are proper and glorious to keep a state that may already be stable\nand firm.\nCHAPTER XXV\nWHAT FORTUNE CAN EFFECT IN HUMAN AFFAIRS AND HOW TO WITHSTAND HER\nIt is not unknown to me how many men have had, and still have, the opinion that the affairs of the world are\nin such wise governed by fortune and by God that men with their wisdom cannot direct them and that no one can\neven help them; and because of this they would have us believe that it is not necessary to labour much in affairs, but\nto let chance govern them. This opinion has been more credited in our times because of the great changes in affairs\nwhich have been seen, and may still be seen, every day, beyond all human conjecture. Sometimes pondering over\nthis, I am in some degree inclined to their opinion. Nevertheless, not to extinguish our free will, I hold it to be true\nthat Fortune is the arbiter of one-half of our actions, but that she still leaves us to direct the other half, or perhaps a\nlittle less.\nI compare her to one of those raging rivers, which when in flood overflows the plains, sweeping away trees\nand buildings, bearing away the soil from place to place; everything flies before it, all yield to its violence, without\nbeing able in any way to withstand it; and yet, though its nature be such, it does not follow therefore that men,\n255 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nwhen the weather becomes fair, shall not make provision, both with defences and barriers, in such a manner that,\nrising again, the waters may pass away by canal, and their force be neither so unrestrained nor so dangerous. So it\nhappens with fortune, who shows her power where valour has not prepared to resist her, and thither she turns her\nforces where she knows that barriers and defences have not been raised to constrain her.\nAnd if you will consider Italy, which is the seat of these changes, and which has given to them their impulse, you\nwill see it to be an open country without barriers and without any defence. For if it had been defended by proper\nvalour, as are Germany, Spain, and France, either this invasion would not have made the great changes it has made or\nit would not have come at all. And this I consider enough to say concerning resistance to fortune in general.\nBut confining myself more to the particular, I say that a prince may be seen happy to-day and ruined to-mor-\nrow without having shown any change of disposition or character. This, I believe, arises firstly from causes that\nhave already been discussed at length, namely, that the prince who relies entirely on fortune is lost when it chang-\nes. I believe also that he will be successful who directs his actions according to the spirit of the times, and that he\nwhose actions do not accord with the times will not be successful. Because men are seen, in affairs that lead to the\nend which every man has before him, namely, glory and riches, to get there by various methods; one with caution,\nanother with haste; one by force, another by skill; one by patience, another by its opposite; and each one succeeds in\nreaching the goal by a different method. One can also see of two cautious men the one attain his end, the other fail;\nand similarly, two men by different observances are equally successful, the one being cautious, the other impetuous;\nall this arises from nothing else than whether or not they conform in their methods to the spirit of the times. This\nfollows from what I have said, that two men working differently bring about the same effect, and of two working\nsimilarly, one attains his object and the other does not.\nChanges in estate also issue from this, for if, to one who governs himself with caution and patience, times and\naffairs converge in such a way that his administration is successful, his fortune is made; but if times and affairs\nchange, he is ruined if he does not change his course of action. But a man is not often found sufficiently circum-\nspect to know how to accommodate himself to the change, both because he cannot deviate from what nature\ninclines him to do, and also because, having always prospered by acting in one way, he cannot be persuaded that it\nis well to leave it; and, therefore, the cautious man, when it is time to turn adventurous, does not know how to do it,\nhence he is ruined; but had he changed his conduct with the times fortune would not have changed.\nPope Julius the Second went to work impetuously in all his affairs, and found the times and circumstances\nconform so well to that line of action that he always met with success. Consider his first enterprise against Bologna,\nMesser Giovanni Bentivogli being still alive. The Venetians were not agreeable to it, nor was the King of Spain, and\nhe had the enterprise still under discussion with the King of France; nevertheless he personally entered upon the\nexpedition with his accustomed boldness and energy, a move which made Spain and the Venetians stand irresolute\nand passive, the latter from fear, the former from desire to recover the kingdom of Naples; on the other hand, he\ndrew after him the King of France, because that king, having observed the movement, and desiring to make the\nPope his friend so as to humble the Venetians, found it impossible to refuse him. Therefore Julius with his impetu-\nous action accomplished what no other pontiff with simple human wisdom could have done; for if he had waited in\nRome until he could get away, with his plans arranged and everything fixed, as any other pontiff would have done,\nhe would never have succeeded. Because the King of France would have made a thousand excuses, and the others\nwould have raised a thousand fears.\nI will leave his other actions alone, as they were all alike, and they all succeeded, for the shortness of his life did\nnot let him experience the contrary; but if circumstances had arisen which required him to go cautiously, his ruin\nwould have followed, because he would never have deviated from those ways to which nature inclined him.\nI conclude, therefore that, fortune being changeful and mankind steadfast in their ways, so long as the two are\nin agreement men are successful, but unsuccessful when they fall out. For my part I consider that it is better to be\nadventurous than cautious, because fortune is a woman, and if you wish to keep her under it is necessary to beat\nand ill-use her; and it is seen that she allows herself to be mastered by the adventurous rather than by those who\ngo to work more coldly. She is, therefore, always, woman-like, a lover of young men, because they are less cautious,\nmore violent, and with more audacity command her.\n256 The Tempest\ntHe teMPeSt\nWilliam Shakespeare (1564 C.E.-1616 C.E.)\nPublished in the First Folio of 1623 C.E.\nEngland\nThe Tempest is regarded as the last play Shakespeare wrote alone, based\non the fact that it uses material only available in late 1610 C.E. and it was\nperformed before King James on Hallowmas Night, 1611 C.E.

As the double meaning indicates, More\u2019s invented\nsociety may sound great, but it does not actually exist. In More\u2019s work, the country of Utopia is in the New World,\nand details about it are reported by Hythloday, a sailor whose name translates as \u201cspeaker of nonsense.\u201d What\nfollows is actually a criticism of the Old World, in that the Utopians do well in all of the things that More thinks\nthat his society does poorly; for example, as More praises the Utopians for consciously despising gold, he implicitly\ncondemns his own society, which he says will scarcely believe that any society would not desire gold. Other authors\nfollowed his lead (such as Jonathan Swift, who plays with the idea of utopia in Gulliver\u2019s Travels), and eventually\nutopian literature led to another genre: dystopian literature, such as George Orwell\u2019s Animal Farm and 1984, movies\nsuch as Blade Runner, and a list of young adult novels, including The Hunger Games.\nWritten by Laura J. Getty\nSelections from Utopia\nLicense: Public Domain\nThomas More, Translated by Gilbert Burnet\nHenry VIII., the unconquered King of England, a prince adorned with all the virtues that become a great\nmonarch, having some differences of no small consequence with Charles the most serene Prince of Castile, sent me\ninto Flanders, as his ambassador, for treating and composing matters between them. I was colleague and compan-\n321 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nion to that incomparable man Cuthbert Tonstal, whom the King, with such universal applause, lately made Master\nof the Rolls; but of whom I will say nothing; not because I fear that the testimony of a friend will be suspected, but\nrather because his learning and virtues are too great for me to do them justice, and so well known, that they need\nnot my commendations, unless I would, according to the proverb, \u201cShow the sun with a lantern.\u201d Those that were\nappointed by the Prince to treat with us, met us at Bruges, according to agreement; they were all worthy men. The\nMargrave of Bruges was their head, and the chief man among them; but he that was esteemed the wisest, and that\nspoke for the rest, was George Temse, the Provost of Casselsee: both art and nature had concurred to make him\neloquent: he was very learned in the law; and, as he had a great capacity, so, by a long practice in affairs, he was very\ndexterous at unravelling them. After we had several times met, without coming to an agreement, they went to\nBrussels for some days, to know the Prince\u2019s pleasure; and, since our business would admit it, I went to Antwerp.\nWhile I was there, among many that visited me, there was one that was more acceptable to me than any other, Peter\nGiles, born at Antwerp, who is a man of great honour, and of a good rank in his town, though less than he deserves;\nfor I do not know if there be anywhere to be found a more learned and a better bred young man; for as he is both a\nvery worthy and a very knowing person, so he is so civil to all men, so particularly kind to his friends, and so full of\ncandour and affection, that there is not, perhaps, above one or two anywhere to be found, that is in all respects so\nperfect a friend: he is extraordinarily modest, there is no artifice in him, and yet no man has more of a prudent\nsimplicity. His conversation was so pleasant and so innocently cheerful, that his company in a great measure\nlessened any longings to go back to my country, and to my wife and children, which an absence of four months had\nquickened very much. One day, as I was returning home from mass at St. Mary\u2019s, which is the chief church, and the\nmost frequented of any in Antwerp, I saw him, by accident, talking with a stranger, who seemed past the flower of\nhis age; his face was tanned, he had a long beard, and his cloak was hanging carelessly about him, so that, by his\nlooks and habit, I concluded he was a seaman. As soon as Peter saw me, he came and saluted me, and as I was\nreturning his civility, he took me aside, and pointing to him with whom he had been discoursing, he said, \u201cDo you\nsee that man? I was just thinking to bring him to you.\u201d I answered, \u201cHe should have been very welcome on your\naccount.\u201d \u201cAnd on his own too,\u201d replied he, \u201cif you knew the man, for there is none alive that can give so copious an\naccount of unknown nations and countries as he can do, which I\nknow you very much desire.\u201d \u201cThen,\u201d said I, \u201cI did not guess amiss,\nfor at first sight I took him for a seaman.\u201d \u201cBut you are much\nmistaken,\u201d said he, \u201cfor he has not sailed as a seaman, but as a\ntraveller, or rather a philosopher. This Raphael, who from his\nfamily carries the name of Hythloday, is not ignorant of the Latin\ntongue, but is eminently learned in the Greek, having applied\nhimself more particularly to that than to the former, because he\nhad given himself much to philosophy, in which he knew that the\nRomans have left us nothing that is valuable, except what is to be\nfound in Seneca and Cicero. He is a Portuguese by birth, and was\nso desirous of seeing the world, that he divided his estate among\nhis brothers, ran the same hazard as Americus Vesputius, and bore\na share in three of his four voyages that are now published; only he\ndid not return with him in his last, but obtained leave of him,\nalmost by force, that he might be one of those twenty-four who\nwere left at the farthest place at which they touched in their last\nvoyage to New Castile. The leaving him thus did not a little gratify\none that was more fond of travelling than of returning home to be\nburied in his own country; for he used often to say, that the way to\nheaven was the same from all places, and he that had no grave had\nthe heavens still over him. Yet this disposition of mind had cost\nhim dear, if God had not been very gracious to him; for after he,\nwith five Castalians, had travelled over many countries, at last, by\nstrange good fortune, he got to Ceylon, and from thence to Cali-\ncut, where he, very happily, found some Portuguese ships; and,\nImage 11.18: Utopia, More | Thomas More\u2019s\nbeyond all men\u2019s expectations, returned to his native country.\u201d\nUtopia, written in Latin and decorated with cherub\nWhen Peter had said this to me, I thanked him for his kindness in\nangels around the text.\nintending to give me the acquaintance of a man whose conversa-\nAuthor: Thomas More tion he knew would be so acceptable; and upon that Raphael and I\nSource: Wikimedia Commons embraced each other. After those civilities were past which are usu-\nLicense: Public Domain al with strangers upon their first meeting, we all went to my house,\n322 Utopia\nand entering into the garden, sat down on a green bank and entertained one another in discourse. He told us that\nwhen Vesputius had sailed away, he, and his companions that stayed behind in New Castile, by degrees insinuated\nthemselves into the affections of the people of the country, meeting often with them and treating them gently; and\nat last they not only lived among them without danger, but conversed familiarly with them, and got so far into the\nheart of a prince, whose name and country I have forgot, that he both furnished them plentifully with all things\nnecessary, and also with the conveniences of travelling, both boats when they went by water, and waggons when\nthey trained over land: he sent with them a very faithful guide, who was to introduce and recommend them to such\nother princes as they had a mind to see: and after many days\u2019 journey, they came to towns, and cities, and to com-\nmonwealths, that were both happily governed and well peopled. Under the equator, and as far on both sides of it as\nthe sun moves, there lay vast deserts that were parched with the perpetual heat of the sun; the soil was withered, all\nthings looked dismally, and all places were either quite uninhabited, or abounded with wild beasts and serpents,\nand some few men, that were neither less wild nor less cruel than the beasts themselves. But, as they went farther, a\nnew scene opened, all things grew milder, the air less burning, the soil more verdant, and even the beasts were less\nwild: and, at last, there were nations, towns, and cities, that had not only mutual commerce among themselves and\nwith their neighbours, but traded, both by sea and land, to very remote countries. There they found the convenien-\ncies of seeing many countries on all hands, for no ship went any voyage into which he and his companions were not\nvery welcome. The first vessels that they saw were flat-bottomed, their sails were made of reeds and wicker, woven\nclose together, only some were of leather; but, afterwards, they found ships made with round keels and canvas sails,\nand in all respects like our ships, and the seamen understood both astronomy and navigation. He got wonderfully\ninto their favour by showing them the use of the needle, of which till then they were utterly ignorant. They sailed\nbefore with great caution, and only in summer time; but now they count all seasons alike, trusting wholly to the\nloadstone, in which they are, perhaps, more secure than safe; so that there is reason to fear that this discovery,\nwhich was thought would prove so much to their advantage, may, by their imprudence, become an occasion of\nmuch mischief to them. But it were too long to dwell on all that he told us he had observed in every place, it would\nbe too great a digression from our present purpose: whatever is necessary to be told concerning those wise and\nprudent institutions which he observed among civilised nations, may perhaps be related by us on a more proper\noccasion. We asked him many questions concerning all these things, to which he answered very willingly; we made\nno inquiries after monsters, than which nothing is more common; for everywhere one may hear of ravenous dogs\nand wolves, and cruel men-eaters, but it is not so easy to find states that are well and wisely governed.\nAs he told us of many things that were amiss in those new-discovered countries, so he reckoned up not a few\nthings, from which patterns might be taken for correcting the errors of these nations among whom we live; of\nwhich an account may be given, as I have already promised, at some other time; for, at present, I intend only to\nrelate those particulars that he told us, of the manners and laws of the Utopians: but I will begin with the occasion\nthat led us to speak of that commonwealth. After Raphael had discoursed with great judgment on the many errors\nthat were both among us and these nations, had treated of the wise institutions both here and there, and had spoken\nas distinctly of the customs and government of every nation through which he had past, as if he had spent his whole\nlife in it, Peter, being struck with admiration, said, \u201cI wonder, Raphael, how it comes that you enter into no king\u2019s\nservice, for I am sure there are none to whom you would not be very acceptable; for your learning and knowledge,\nboth of men and things, is such, that you would not only entertain them very pleasantly, but be of great use to them,\nby the examples you could set before them, and the advices you could give them; and by this means you would\nboth serve your own interest, and be of great use to all your friends.\u201d \u201cAs for my friends,\u201d answered he, \u201cI need not\nbe much concerned, having already done for them all that was incumbent on me; for when I was not only in good\nhealth, but fresh and young, I distributed that among my kindred and friends which other people do not part with\ntill they are old and sick: when they then unwillingly give that which they can enjoy no longer themselves. I think\nmy friends ought to rest contented with this, and not to expect that for their sakes I should enslave myself to any\nking whatsoever.\u201d \u201cSoft and fair!\u201d said Peter; \u201cI do not mean that you should be a slave to any king, but only that\nyou should assist them and be useful to them.\u201d \u201cThe change of the word,\u201d said he, \u201cdoes not alter the matter.\u201d \u201cBut\nterm it as you will,\u201d replied Peter, \u201cI do not see any other way in which you can be so useful, both in private to your\nfriends and to the public, and by which you can make your own condition happier.\u201d \u201cHappier?\u201d answered Raphael,\n\u201cis that to be compassed in a way so abhorrent to my genius? Now I live as I will, to which I believe, few courtiers\ncan pretend; and there are so many that court the favour of great men, that there will be no great loss if they are\nnot troubled either with me or with others of my temper.\u201d Upon this, said I, \u201cI perceive, Raphael, that you neither\ndesire wealth nor greatness; and, indeed, I value and admire such a man much more than I do any of the great men\nin the world. Yet I think you would do what would well become so generous and philosophical a soul as yours is,\nif you would apply your time and thoughts to public affairs, even though you may happen to find it a little uneasy\nto yourself; and this you can never do with so much advantage as by being taken into the council of some great\nprince and putting him on noble and worthy actions, which I know you would do if you were in such a post; for the\n323 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nsprings both of good and evil flow from the prince over a whole nation, as from a lasting fountain. So much learn-\ning as you have, even without practice in affairs, or so great a practice as you have had, without any other learning,\nwould render you a very fit counsellor to any king whatsoever.\u201d \u201cYou are doubly mistaken,\u201d said he, \u201cMr. More, both\nin your opinion of me and in the judgment you make of things: for as I have not that capacity that you fancy I have,\nso if I had it, the public would not be one jot the better when I had sacrificed my quiet to it. For most princes apply\nthemselves more to affairs of war than to the useful arts of peace; and in these I neither have any knowledge, nor do\nI much desire it; they are generally more set on acquiring new kingdoms, right or wrong, than on governing well\nthose they possess: and, among the ministers of princes, there are none that are not so wise as to need no assistance,\nor at least, that do not think themselves so wise that they imagine they need none; and if they court any, it is only\nthose for whom the prince has much personal favour, whom by their fawning and flatteries they endeavour to fix to\ntheir own interests; and, indeed, nature has so made us, that we all love to be flattered and to please ourselves with\nour own notions: the old crow loves his young, and the ape her cubs. Now if in such a court, made up of persons\nwho envy all others and only admire themselves, a person should but propose anything that he had either read in\nhistory or observed in his travels, the rest would think that the reputation of their wisdom would sink, and that\ntheir interests would be much depressed if they could not run it down: and, if all other things failed, then they\nwould fly to this, that such or such things pleased our ancestors, and it were well for us if we could but match them.\nThey would set up their rest on such an answer, as a sufficient confutation of all that could be said, as if it were a\ngreat misfortune that any should be found wiser than his ancestors. But though they willingly let go all the good\nthings that were among those of former ages, yet, if better things are proposed, they cover themselves obstinately\nwith this excuse of reverence to past times.\n* * * * * * * * *\nUpon this I said to him, \u201cI earnestly beg you would describe that island very particularly to us; be not too short,\nbut set out in order all things relating to their soil, their rivers, their towns, their people, their manners, constitu-\ntion, laws, and, in a word, all that you imagine we desire to know; and you may well imagine that we desire to know\neverything concerning them of which we are hitherto ignorant.\u201d \u201cI will do it very willingly,\u201d said he, \u201cfor I have\ndigested the whole matter carefully, but it will take up some time.\u201d \u201cLet us go, then,\u201d said I, \u201cfirst and dine, and then\nwe shall have leisure enough.\u201d He consented; we went in and dined, and after dinner came back and sat down in the\nsame place. I ordered my servants to take care that none might come and interrupt us, and both Peter and I desired\nRaphael to be as good as his word. When he saw that we were very intent upon it he paused a little to recollect\nhimself, and began in this manner:\u2014\n\u201cThe island of Utopia is in the middle two hundred miles broad, and holds almost at the same breadth over a\ngreat part of it, but it grows narrower towards both ends. Its figure is not unlike a crescent. Between its horns the\nsea comes in eleven miles broad, and spreads itself into a great bay, which is environed with land to the compass of\nabout five hundred miles, and is well secured from winds. In this bay there is no great current; the whole coast is,\nas it were, one continued harbour, which gives all that live in the island great convenience for mutual commerce.\nBut the entry into the bay, occasioned by rocks on the one hand and shallows on the other, is very dangerous. In the\nmiddle of it there is one single rock which appears above water, and may, therefore, easily be avoided; and on the\ntop of it there is a tower, in which a garrison is kept; the other rocks lie under water, and are very dangerous. The\nchannel is known only to the natives; so that if any stranger should enter into the bay without one of their pilots he\nwould run great danger of shipwreck. For even they themselves could not pass it safe if some marks that are on the\ncoast did not direct their way; and if these should be but a little shifted, any fleet that might come against them, how\ngreat soever it were, would be certainly lost. On the other side of the island there are likewise many harbours; and\nthe coast is so fortified, both by nature and art, that a small number of men can hinder the descent of a great army.\nBut they report (and there remains good marks of it to make it credible) that this was no island at first, but a part\nof the continent. Utopus, that conquered it (whose name it still carries, for Abraxa was its first name), brought the\nrude and uncivilised inhabitants into such a good government, and to that measure of politeness, that they now far\nexcel all the rest of mankind. Having soon subdued them, he designed to separate them from the continent, and to\nbring the sea quite round them. To accomplish this he ordered a deep channel to be dug, fifteen miles long; and that\nthe natives might not think he treated them like slaves, he not only forced the inhabitants, but also his own soldiers,\nto labour in carrying it on. As he set a vast number of men to work, he, beyond all men\u2019s expectations, brought it\nto a speedy conclusion. And his neighbours, who at first laughed at the folly of the undertaking, no sooner saw it\nbrought to perfection than they were struck with admiration and terror.\n\u201cThere are fifty-four cities in the island, all large and well built, the manners, customs, and laws of which are\nthe same, and they are all contrived as near in the same manner as the ground on which they stand will allow. The\nnearest lie at least twenty-four miles\u2019 distance from one another, and the most remote are not so far distant but that\n324 Utopia\na man can go on foot in one day from it to that which lies next it. Every city sends three of their wisest senators\nonce a year to Amaurot, to consult about their common concerns; for that is the chief town of the island, being\nsituated near the centre of it, so that it is the most convenient place for their assemblies. The jurisdiction of every\ncity extends at least twenty miles, and, where the towns lie wider, they have much more ground. No town desires to\nenlarge its bounds, for the people consider themselves rather as tenants than landlords. They have built, over all the\ncountry, farmhouses for husbandmen, which are well contrived, and furnished with all things necessary for country\nlabour. Inhabitants are sent, by turns, from the cities to dwell in them; no country family has fewer than forty men\nand women in it, besides two slaves. There is a master and a mistress set over every family, and over thirty families\nthere is a magistrate. Every year twenty of this family come back to the town after they have stayed two years in\nthe country, and in their room there are other twenty sent from the town, that they may learn country work from\nthose that have been already one year in the country, as they must teach those that come to them the next from\nthe town. By this means such as dwell in those country farms are never ignorant of agriculture, and so commit no\nerrors which might otherwise be fatal and bring them under a scarcity of corn. But though there is every year such\na shifting of the husbandmen to prevent any man being forced against his will to follow that hard course of life\ntoo long, yet many among them take such pleasure in it that they desire leave to continue in it many years. These\nhusbandmen till the ground, breed cattle, hew wood, and convey it to the towns either by land or water, as is most\nconvenient. They breed an infinite multitude of chickens in a very curious manner; for the hens do not sit and hatch\nthem, but a vast number of eggs are laid in a gentle and equal heat in order to be hatched, and they are no sooner\nout of the shell, and able to stir about, but they seem to consider those that feed them as their mothers, and follow\nthem as other chickens do the hen that hatched them. They breed very few horses, but those they have are full of\nmettle, and are kept only for exercising their youth in the art of sitting and riding them; for they do not put them\nto any work, either of ploughing or carriage, in which they employ oxen. For though their horses are stronger, yet\nthey find oxen can hold out longer; and as they are not subject to so many diseases, so they are kept upon a less\ncharge and with less trouble. And even when they are so worn out that they are no more fit for labour, they are\ngood meat at last. They sow no corn but that which is to be their bread; for they drink either wine, cider or perry,\nand often water, sometimes boiled with honey or liquorice, with which they abound; and though they know exactly\nhow much corn will serve every town and all that tract of country which belongs to it, yet they sow much more and\nbreed more cattle than are necessary for their consumption, and they give that overplus of which they make no use\nto their neighbours. When they want anything in the country which it does not produce, they fetch that from the\ntown, without carrying anything in exchange for it. And the magistrates of the town take care to see it given them;\nfor they meet generally in the town once a month, upon a festival day. When the time of harvest comes, the magis-\ntrates in the country send to those in the towns and let them know how many hands they will need for reaping the\nharvest; and the number they call for being sent to them, they commonly despatch it all in one day.\n* * * * * * * * *\n\u201cIn their great council at Amaurot, to which there are three sent from every town once a year, they examine\nwhat towns abound in provisions and what are under any scarcity, that so the one may be furnished from the other;\nand this is done freely, without any sort of exchange; for, according to their plenty or scarcity, they supply or are\nsupplied from one another, so that indeed the whole island is, as it were, one family. When they have thus taken\ncare of their whole country, and laid up stores for two years (which they do to prevent the ill consequences of an\nunfavourable season), they order an exportation of the overplus, both of corn, honey, wool, flax, wood, wax, tallow,\nleather, and cattle, which they send out, commonly in great quantities, to other nations. They order a seventh part\nof all these goods to be freely given to the poor of the countries to which they send them, and sell the rest at mod-\nerate rates; and by this exchange they not only bring back those few things that they need at home (for, indeed, they\nscarce need anything but iron), but likewise a great deal of gold and silver; and by their driving this trade so long,\nit is not to be imagined how vast a treasure they have got among them, so that now they do not much care whether\nthey sell off their merchandise for money in hand or upon trust. A great part of their treasure is now in bonds; but\nin all their contracts no private man stands bound, but the writing runs in the name of the town; and the towns that\nowe them money raise it from those private hands that owe it to them, lay it up in their public chamber, or enjoy\nthe profit of it till the Utopians call for it; and they choose rather to let the greatest part of it lie in their hands, who\nmake advantage by it, than to call for it themselves; but if they see that any of their other neighbours stand more in\nneed of it, then they call it in and lend it to them. Whenever they are engaged in war, which is the only occasion in\nwhich their treasure can be usefully employed, they make use of it themselves; in great extremities or sudden acci-\ndents they employ it in hiring foreign troops, whom they more willingly expose to danger than their own people;\nthey give them great pay, knowing well that this will work even on their enemies; that it will engage them either to\nbetray their own side, or, at least, to desert it; and that it is the best means of raising mutual jealousies among them.\n325 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nFor this end they have an incredible treasure; but they do not keep it as a treasure, but in such a manner as I am\nalmost afraid to tell, lest you think it so extravagant as to be hardly credible. This I have the more reason to appre-\nhend because, if I had not seen it myself, I could not have been easily persuaded to have believed it upon any man\u2019s\nreport.\n\u201cIt is certain that all things appear incredible to us in proportion as they differ from known customs; but one\nwho can judge aright will not wonder to find that, since their constitution differs so much from ours, their value of\ngold and silver should be measured by a very different standard; for since they have no use for money among them-\nselves, but keep it as a provision against events which seldom happen, and between which there are generally long\nintervening intervals, they value it no farther than it deserves\u2014that is, in proportion to its use. So that it is plain\nthey must prefer iron either to gold or silver, for men can no more live without iron than without fire or water; but\nNature has marked out no use for the other metals so essential as not easily to be dispensed with. The folly of men\nhas enhanced the value of gold and silver because of their scarcity; whereas, on the contrary, it is their opinion that\nNature, as an indulgent parent, has freely given us all the best things in great abundance, such as water and earth,\nbut has laid up and hid from us the things that are vain and useless.\n\u201cIf these metals were laid up in any tower in the kingdom it would raise a jealousy of the Prince and Senate, and\ngive birth to that foolish mistrust into which the people are apt to fall\u2014a jealousy of their intending to sacrifice the\ninterest of the public to their own private advantage. If they should work it into vessels, or any sort of plate, they\nfear that the people might grow too fond of it, and so be unwilling to let the plate be run down, if a war made it nec-\nessary, to employ it in paying their soldiers. To prevent all these inconveniences they have fallen upon an expedient\nwhich, as it agrees with their other policy, so is it very different from ours, and will scarce gain belief among us who\nvalue gold so much, and lay it up so carefully. They eat and drink out of vessels of earth or glass, which make an\nagreeable appearance, though formed of brittle materials; while they make their chamber-pots and close-stools of\ngold and silver, and that not only in their public halls but in their private houses. Of the same metals they likewise\nmake chains and fetters for their slaves, to some of which, as a badge of infamy, they hang an earring of gold, and\nmake others wear a chain or a coronet of the same metal; and thus they take care by all possible means to render\ngold and silver of no esteem; and from hence it is that while other nations part with their gold and silver as unwill-\ningly as if one tore out their bowels, those of Utopia would look on their giving in all they possess of those metals\n(when there were any use for them) but as the parting with a trifle, or as we would esteem the loss of a penny! They\nfind pearls on their coasts, and diamonds and carbuncles on their rocks; they do not look after them, but, if they\nfind them by chance, they polish them, and with them they adorn their children, who are delighted with them, and\nglory in them during their childhood; but when they grow to years, and see that none but children use such bau-\nbles, they of their own accord, without being bid by their parents, lay them aside, and would be as much ashamed to\nuse them afterwards as children among us, when they come to years, are of their puppets and other toys.\n\u201cI never saw a clearer instance of the opposite impressions that different customs make on people than I ob-\nserved in the ambassadors of the Anemolians, who came to Amaurot when I was there. As they came to treat of\naffairs of great consequence, the deputies from several towns met together to wait for their coming. The ambassa-\ndors of the nations that lie near Utopia, knowing their customs, and that fine clothes are in no esteem among them,\nthat silk is despised, and gold is a badge of infamy, used to come very modestly clothed; but the Anemolians, lying\nmore remote, and having had little commerce with them, understanding that they were coarsely clothed, and all in\nthe same manner, took it for granted that they had none of those fine things among them of which they made no\nuse; and they, being a vainglorious rather than a wise people, resolved to set themselves out with so much pomp\nthat they should look like gods, and strike the eyes of the poor Utopians with their splendour. Thus three ambassa-\ndors made their entry with a hundred attendants, all clad in garments of different colours, and the greater part in\nsilk; the ambassadors themselves, who were of the nobility of their country, were in cloth-of-gold, and adorned with\nmassy chains, earrings and rings of gold; their caps were covered with bracelets set full of pearls and other gems\u2014in\na word, they were set out with all those things that among the Utopians were either the badges of slavery, the marks\nof infamy, or the playthings of children. It was not unpleasant to see, on the one side, how they looked big, when\nthey compared their rich habits with the plain clothes of the Utopians, who were come out in great numbers to see\nthem make their entry; and, on the other, to observe how much they were mistaken in the impression which they\nhoped this pomp would have made on them. It appeared so ridiculous a show to all that had never stirred out of\ntheir country, and had not seen the customs of other nations, that though they paid some reverence to those that\nwere the most meanly clad, as if they had been the ambassadors, yet when they saw the ambassadors themselves so\nfull of gold and chains, they looked upon them as slaves, and forbore to treat them with reverence. You might have\nseen the children who were grown big enough to despise their playthings, and who had thrown away their jewels,\ncall to their mothers, push them gently, and cry out, \u2018See that great fool, that wears pearls and gems as if he were yet\na child!\u2019 while their mothers very innocently replied, \u2018Hold your peace! this, I believe, is one of the ambassadors\u2019\nfools.\u2019 Others censured the fashion of their chains, and observed, \u2018That they were of no use, for they were too slight\n326 Utopia\nto bind their slaves, who could easily break them; and, besides, hung so loose about them that they thought it easy\nto throw their away, and so get from them.\u201d But after the ambassadors had stayed a day among them, and saw so\nvast a quantity of gold in their houses (which was as much despised by them as it was esteemed in other nations),\nand beheld more gold and silver in the chains and fetters of one slave than all their ornaments amounted to, their\nplumes fell, and they were ashamed of all that glory for which they had formed valued themselves, and according-\nly laid it aside\u2014a resolution that they immediately took when, on their engaging in some free discourse with the\nUtopians, they discovered their sense of such things and their other customs. The Utopians wonder how any man\nshould be so much taken with the glaring doubtful lustre of a jewel or a stone, that can look up to a star or to the\nsun himself; or how any should value himself because his cloth is made of a finer thread; for, how fine soever that\nthread may be, it was once no better than the fleece of a sheep, and that sheep, was a sheep still, for all its wear-\ning it. They wonder much to hear that gold, which in itself is so useless a thing, should be everywhere so much\nesteemed that even man, for whom it was made, and by whom it has its value, should yet be thought of less value\nthan this metal; that a man of lead, who has no more sense than a log of wood, and is as bad as he is foolish, should\nhave many wise and good men to serve him, only because he has a great heap of that metal; and that if it should\nhappen that by some accident or trick of law (which, sometimes produces as great changes as chance itself) all this\nwealth should pass from the master to the meanest varlet of his whole family, he himself would very soon become\none of his servants, as if he were a thing that belonged to his wealth, and so were bound to follow its fortune! But\nthey much more admire and detest the folly of those who, when they see a rich man, though they neither owe him\nanything, nor are in any sort dependent on his bounty, yet, merely because he is rich, give him little less than divine\nhonours, even though they know him to be so covetous and base-minded that, notwithstanding all his wealth, he\nwill not part with one farthing of it to them as long as he lives!\n\u201cThese and such like notions have that people imbibed, partly from their education, being bred in a country\nwhose customs and laws are opposite to all such foolish maxims, and partly from their learning and studies\u2014for\nthough there are but few in any town that are so wholly excused from labour as to give themselves entirely up to\ntheir studies (these being only such persons as discover from their childhood an extraordinary capacity and dispo-\nsition for letters), yet their children and a great part of the nation, both men and women, are taught to spend those\nhours in which they are not obliged to work in reading; and this they do through the whole progress of life. They\nhave all their learning in their own tongue, which is both a copious and pleasant language, and in which a man can\nfully express his mind; it runs over a great tract of many countries, but it is not equally pure in all places. They had\nnever so much as heard of the names of any of those philosophers that are so famous in these parts of the world,\nbefore we went among them; and yet they had made the same discoveries as the Greeks, both in music, logic, arith-\nmetic, and geometry. But as they are almost in everything equal to the ancient philosophers, so they far exceed our\nmodern logicians for they have never yet fallen upon the barbarous niceties that our youth are forced to learn in\nthose trifling logical schools that are among us. They are so far from minding chimeras and fantastical images made\nin the mind that none of them could comprehend what we meant when we talked to them of a man in the abstract\nas common to all men in particular (so that though we spoke of him as a thing that we could point at with our fin-\ngers, yet none of them could perceive him) and yet distinct from every one, as if he were some monstrous Colossus\nor giant; yet, for all this ignorance of these empty notions, they knew astronomy, and were perfectly acquainted\nwith the motions of the heavenly bodies; and have many instruments, well contrived and divided, by which they\nvery accurately compute the course and positions of the sun, moon, and stars. But for the cheat of divining by the\nstars, by their oppositions or conjunctions, it has not so much as entered into their thoughts. They have a particular\nsagacity, founded upon much observation, in judging of the weather, by which they know when they may look for\nrain, wind, or other alterations in the air; but as to the philosophy of these things, the cause of the saltness of the\nsea, of its ebbing and flowing, and of the original and nature both of the heavens and the earth, they dispute of them\npartly as our ancient philosophers have done, and partly upon some new hypothesis, in which, as they differ from\nthem, so they do not in all things agree among themselves.\n* * * * * * * * *\n\u201cThere are several sorts of religions, not only in different parts of the island, but even in every town; some wor-\nshipping the sun, others the moon or one of the planets. Some worship such men as have been eminent in former\ntimes for virtue or glory, not only as ordinary deities, but as the supreme god. Yet the greater and wiser sort of them\nworship none of these, but adore one eternal, invisible, infinite, and incomprehensible Deity; as a Being that is far\nabove all our apprehensions, that is spread over the whole universe, not by His bulk, but by His power and virtue;\nHim they call the Father of All, and acknowledge that the beginnings, the increase, the progress, the vicissitudes,\nand the end of all things come only from Him; nor do they offer divine honours to any but to Him alone. And,\nindeed, though they differ concerning other things, yet all agree in this: that they think there is one Supreme Being\n327 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nthat made and governs the world, whom they call, in the language of their country, Mithras. They differ in this:\nthat one thinks the god whom he worships is this Supreme Being, and another thinks that his idol is that god; but\nthey all agree in one principle, that whoever is this Supreme Being, He is also that great essence to whose glory and\nmajesty all honours are ascribed by the consent of all nations.\n\u201cBy degrees they fall off from the various superstitions that are among them, and grow up to that one religion\nthat is the best and most in request; and there is no doubt to be made, but that all the others had vanished long\nago, if some of those who advised them to lay aside their superstitions had not met with some unhappy accidents,\nwhich, being considered as inflicted by heaven, made them afraid that the god whose worship had like to have been\nabandoned had interposed and revenged themselves on those who despised their authority.\n\u201cAfter they had heard from us an account of the doctrine, the course of life, and the miracles of Christ, and of\nthe wonderful constancy of so many martyrs, whose blood, so willingly offered up by them, was the chief occasion\nof spreading their religion over a vast number of nations, it is not to be imagined how inclined they were to receive\nit. I shall not determine whether this proceeded from any secret inspiration of God, or whether it was because it\nseemed so favourable to that community of goods, which is an opinion so particular as well as so dear to them;\nsince they perceived that Christ and His followers lived by that rule, and that it was still kept up in some communi-\nties among the sincerest sort of Christians. From whichsoever of these motives it might be, true it is, that many of\nthem came over to our religion, and were initiated into it by baptism. But as two of our number were dead, so none\nof the four that survived were in priests\u2019 orders, we, therefore, could only baptise them, so that, to our great regret,\nthey could not partake of the other sacraments, that can only be administered by priests, but they are instructed\nconcerning them and long most vehemently for them. They have had great disputes among themselves, whether\none chosen by them to be a priest would not be thereby qualified to do all the things that belong to that character,\neven though he had no authority derived from the Pope, and they seemed to be resolved to choose some for that\nemployment, but they had not done it when I left them.\n\u201cThose among them that have not received our religion do not fright any from it, and use none ill that goes over\nto it, so that all the while I was there one man was only punished on this occasion. He being newly baptised did,\nnotwithstanding all that we could say to the contrary, dispute publicly concerning the Christian religion, with more\nzeal than discretion, and with so much heat, that he not only preferred our worship to theirs, but condemned all\ntheir rites as profane, and cried out against all that adhered to them as impious and sacrilegious persons, that were\nto be damned to everlasting burnings. Upon his having frequently preached in this manner he was seized, and after\ntrial he was condemned to banishment, not for having disparaged their religion, but for his inflaming the people\nto sedition; for this is one of their most ancient laws, that no man ought to be punished for his religion. At the first\nconstitution of their government, Utopus having understood that before his coming among them the old inhab-\nitants had been engaged in great quarrels concerning religion, by which they were so divided among themselves,\nthat he found it an easy thing to conquer them, since, instead of uniting their forces against him, every different\nparty in religion fought by themselves. After he had subdued them he made a law that every man might be of what\nreligion he pleased, and might endeavour to draw others to it by the force of argument and by amicable and modest\nways, but without bitterness against those of other opinions; but that he ought to use no other force but that of per-\nsuasion, and was neither to mix with it reproaches nor violence; and such as did otherwise were to be condemned\nto banishment or slavery.\n\u201cThis law was made by Utopus, not only for preserving the public peace, which he saw suffered much by daily\ncontentions and irreconcilable heats, but because he thought the interest of religion itself required it. He judged\nit not fit to determine anything rashly; and seemed to doubt whether those different forms of religion might not\nall come from God, who might inspire man in a different manner, and be pleased with this variety; he therefore\nthought it indecent and foolish for any man to threaten and terrify another to make him believe what did not ap-\npear to him to be true. And supposing that only one religion was really true, and the rest false, he imagined that the\nnative force of truth would at last break forth and shine bright, if supported only by the strength of argument, and\nattended to with a gentle and unprejudiced mind; while, on the other hand, if such debates were carried on with\nviolence and tumults, as the most wicked are always the most obstinate, so the best and most holy religion might be\nchoked with superstition, as corn is with briars and thorns; he therefore left men wholly to their liberty, that they\nmight be free to believe as they should see cause; only he made a solemn and severe law against such as should so\nfar degenerate from the dignity of human nature, as to think that our souls died with our bodies, or that the world\nwas governed by chance, without a wise overruling Providence: for they all formerly believed that there was a state\nof rewards and punishments to the good and bad after this life; and they now look on those that think otherwise as\nscarce fit to be counted men, since they degrade so noble a being as the soul, and reckon it no better than a beast\u2019s:\nthus they are far from looking on such men as fit for human society, or to be citizens of a well-ordered common-\nwealth; since a man of such principles must needs, as oft as he dares do it, despise all their laws and customs: for\nthere is no doubt to be made, that a man who is afraid of nothing but the law, and apprehends nothing after death,\n328 Utopia\nwill not scruple to break through all the laws of his country, either by fraud or force, when by this means he may\nsatisfy his appetites. They never raise any that hold these maxims, either to honours or offices, nor employ them\nin any public trust, but despise them, as men of base and sordid minds. Yet they do not punish them, because they\nlay this down as a maxim, that a man cannot make himself believe anything he pleases; nor do they drive any to\ndissemble their thoughts by threatenings, so that men are not tempted to lie or disguise their opinions; which being\na sort of fraud, is abhorred by the Utopians: they take care indeed to prevent their disputing in defence of these\nopinions, especially before the common people: but they suffer, and even encourage them to dispute concerning\nthem in private with their priest, and other grave men, being confident that they will be cured of those mad opin-\nions by having reason laid before them. There are many among them that run far to the other extreme, though it is\nneither thought an ill nor unreasonable opinion, and therefore is not at all discouraged. They think that the souls of\nbeasts are immortal, though far inferior to the dignity of the human soul, and not capable of so great a happiness.\nThey are almost all of them very firmly persuaded that good men will be infinitely happy in another state: so that\nthough they are compassionate to all that are sick, yet they lament no man\u2019s death, except they see him loath to part\nwith life; for they look on this as a very ill presage, as if the soul, conscious to itself of guilt, and quite hopeless, was\nafraid to leave the body, from some secret hints of approaching misery. They think that such a man\u2019s appearance\nbefore God cannot be acceptable to Him, who being called on, does not go out cheerfully, but is backward and un-\nwilling, and is as it were dragged to it. They are struck with horror when they see any die in this manner, and carry\nthem out in silence and with sorrow, and praying God that He would be merciful to the errors of the departed soul,\nthey lay the body in the ground: but when any die cheerfully, and full of hope, they do not mourn for them, but sing\nhymns when they carry out their bodies, and commending their souls very earnestly to God: their whole behaviour\nis then rather grave than sad, they burn the body, and set up a pillar where the pile was made, with an inscription to\nthe honour of the deceased. When they come from the funeral, they discourse of his good life, and worthy actions,\nbut speak of nothing oftener and with more pleasure than of his serenity at the hour of death. They think such\nrespect paid to the memory of good men is both the greatest incitement to engage others to follow their example,\nand the most acceptable worship that can be offered them; for they believe that though by the imperfection of\nhuman sight they are invisible to us, yet they are present among us, and hear those discourses that pass concerning\nthemselves. They believe it inconsistent with the happiness of departed souls not to be at liberty to be where they\nwill: and do not imagine them capable of the ingratitude of not desiring to see those friends with whom they lived\non earth in the strictest bonds of love and kindness: besides, they are persuaded that good men, after death, have\nthese affections; and all other good dispositions increased rather than diminished, and therefore conclude that they\nare still among the living, and observe all they say or do. From hence they engage in all their affairs with the great-\ner confidence of success, as trusting to their protection; while this opinion of the presence of their ancestors is a\nrestraint that prevents their engaging in ill designs.\n329  12\nNative America\nWith the exception of a few pictographic systems, literature in the Americas was transmitted orally until the\narrival of Europeans. The Quich\u00e9 Mayans of Central America quickly used the new alphabet system to write texts in\ntheir native language, while the Cherokee of North America (in the early 1800s C.E.) developed their own syllabary,\nrather than using Roman letters. Because there were so many different languages spoken in North, Central, and\nSouth America, stories were most often recorded in either English or Spanish.\nThe transition between oral and written culture, therefore, took place after the mutual culture shock of meet-\ning new groups of people. As a result, there are elements in some Native American stories that clearly have been\ninfluenced. For example, horses were not found in the Americas before the arrival of the conquistadors, but there\nare some creation stories among the native tribes of the Great Plains that include the creation of horses. Obviously,\nany story that includes a reference to Europeans was influenced by contact with the new group. Scholars are partic-\nularly interested in trying to identify the stories, or elements of stories, that pre-date contact with the Europeans,\nin order to preserve as much of the previous oral culture that has survived. There is value, however, in reading the\ninfluenced stories as well, since they record in literary form the reactions of the native groups to the newcomers.\nSometimes the reaction is humorous, with critical undertones (such as Coyote tricking the man who owns the\ntrading post out of his horse, his money, and his clothes), but more often the stories reflect the tragic consequences\nof the interaction.\nThe earliest recorded stories generally fall into the following categories: myths, legends, folktales (including\njokes and riddles), and biography\/autobiography. The definition of mythology in this instance is simply a collec-\ntion of beliefs held by one group; all groups technically have a mythology, which outsiders usually regard as false,\nleading to the more common modern application of the word myth. Myths take place before recorded history,\nexplaining how the world came to be the way that it is. Legends have a kernel of truth to them, with lots of embel-\nlishment added over the years (for example, a real person who becomes superhuman over the centuries of telling\nstories about him). Folktales are timeless; with a little adaptation, a folktale could be adapted to another time or\nplace. Folktales are also considered fiction by the people hearing the stories, whereas myths and legends are consid-\nered true by the original audiences. The stories in this section generally fall under the category of myth: stories of\nthe creation of the world.\nAs you read, consider the following questions:\n\u2022 Which elements of the stories seem to be original (from the oral past), and which seem influenced by con-\ntact with the Europeans? What evidence is there in the text?\n\u2022 What kind of worldview do the narrators have? What is important to them, and why?\n\u2022 What view of nature does each story have? Is nature to be feared or not, and why?\n\u2022 What examples of that group\u2019s culture are in the stories? There is a huge difference between the cultures of\nthe Pima and the Cherokee, for example.\nWritten by Laura J. Getty\nMytHS oF tHe CHeroKee\nCherokee (Native America)\nCompiled by James Mooney (1861-1921 C.E.)\n331 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nPublished in 1900 C.E.\nThe Cherokee are a group of North American Indians of Iroquoian lineage and were one of the largest tribes\nwhen Europeans colonized the Americas. It is estimated that in 1650 about 22,500 Cherokee Indians controlled\napproximately 40,000 square miles of the Appalachian Mountains, the areas that are now northern Georgia, east-\nern Tennessee, and the western Carolinas. A typical Cherokee town had between 30 and 60 log-cabin houses and a\ncouncil house; they used deer, bear, and elk for meat and clothing, made baskets and pottery, and grew corn, beans,\nand squash. The Spanish, French, and English all attempted to colonize parts of the Southeast of North America,\nincluding Cherokee territory. After 1800, the Cherokee quickly assimilated aspects of American settler culture in\nsuch areas as farming, weaving, and home building; they also developed their own government, modeling it after\nthe United States, and invented a writing system for the Cherokee language. Despite their adaptive efforts, however,\nthe Indian Removal Act of 1830 under President Andrew Jackson forcibly moved Cherokee Indians to Oklahoma;\nabout 4,000 Cherokee died on the Tail of Tears, during the fall and winter of 1838\u201339. As of the twenty-first centu-\nry, there are more than 730,000 individuals of Cherokee descent living in the United States. Myths of the Cherokee\nwas compiled by James Moony, an early twentieth-century ethnographer who lived with the Cherokee for several\nyears, but these stories can be traced back to the time of or even before the arrival of the Europeans.\nWritten by Kyounghye Kwon\nSelections from Myths of the Cherokee\nLicense: Public Domain\nCompiled by James Mooney\nCherokee Cosmogonic Myths\n1. How the World Was Made\nThe earth is a great island floating in a sea of water, and\nsuspended at each of the four cardinal points by a cord hang-\ning down from the sky vault, which is of solid rock. When\nthe world grows old and worn out, the people will die and the\ncords will break and let the earth sink down into the ocean,\nand all will be water again. The Indians are afraid of this.\nWhen all was water, the animals were above in G\u00e4l\u00fb\u00f1\u2019l\u00e4t\u00ef,\nbeyond the arch; but it was very much crowded, and they\nwere wanting more room. They wondered what was below the\nwater, and at last D\u00e2yuni\u2019s\u00ef, \u201cBeaver\u2019s Grandchild,\u201d the little\nWater-beetle, offered to go and see if it could learn. It darted\nin every direction over the surface of the water, but could find\nno firm place to rest. Then it dived to the bottom and came\nup with some soft mud, which began to grow and spread on\nevery side until it became the island which we call the earth. It\nwas afterward fastened to the sky with four cords, but no one\nremembers who did this.\nAt first the earth was flat and very soft and wet. The an-\nimals were anxious to get down, and sent out different birds\nto see if it was yet dry, but they found no place to alight and\ncame back again to G\u00e4l\u00fb\u00f1\u2019l\u00e4t\u00ef. At last it seemed to be time,\nand they sent out the Buzzard and told him to go and make\nready for them. This was the Great Buzzard, the father of all\nthe buzzards we see now. He flew all over the earth, low down\nImage 12.1: Individuals of Cherokee Heritage | near the ground, and it was still soft. When he reached the\nA collage of people with Cherokee ancestry.\nCherokee country, he was very tired, and his wings began\nto flap and strike the ground, and wherever they struck the\nAuthor: User \u201cRobfergusonjr\u201d\nearth there was a valley, and where they turned up again there\nSource: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain was a mountain. When the animals above saw this, they were\n332 Myths of the Cherokee\nafraid that the whole world would be mountains, so they called him back, but the Cherokee country remains full of\nmountains to this day.\nWhen the earth was dry and the animals came down, it was still dark, so they got the sun and set it in a track\nto go every day across the island from east to west, just overhead. It was too hot this way, and Tsiska\u2019g\u00efl\u00ef\u2019, the Red\nCrawfish, had his shell scorched a bright red, so that his meat was spoiled; and the Cherokee do not eat it. The\nconjurers put the sun another hand-breadth higher in the air, but it was still too hot. They raised it another time,\nand another, until it was seven handbreadths high and just under the sky arch. Then it was right, and they left it so.\nThis is why the conjurers call the highest place G\u00fblkw\u00e2\u2019gine Di\u2019g\u00e4l\u00fb\u00f1\u2019l\u00e4tiy\u00fb\u00f1\u2019, \u201cthe seventh height,\u201d because it is seven\nhand-breadths above the earth. Every day the sun goes along under this arch, and returns at night on the upper side\nto the starting place.\nThere is another world under this, and it is like ours in everything\u2014animals, plants, and people\u2014save that the\nseasons are different. The streams that come down from the mountains are the trails by which we reach this under-\nworld, and the springs at their heads are the doorways by which we enter it, but to do this, one must fast and go to\nwater and have one of the underground people for a guide. We know that the seasons in the underworld are differ-\nent from ours, because the water in the springs is always warmer in winter and cooler in summer than the outer air.\nWhen the animals and plants were first made\u2014we do not know by whom\u2014they were told to watch and keep\nawake for seven nights, just as young men now fast and keep awake when they pray to their medicine. They tried\nto do this, and nearly all were awake through the first night, but the next night several dropped off to sleep, and the\nthird night others were asleep, and then others, until, on the seventh night, of all the animals only the owl, the pan-\nther, and one or two more were still awake. To these were given the power to see and to go about in the dark, and to\nmake prey of the birds and animals which must sleep at night. Of the trees only the cedar, the pine, the spruce, the\nholly, and the laurel were awake to the end, and to them it was given to be always green and to be greatest for medi-\ncine, but to the others it was said: \u201cBecause you have not endured to the end you shall lose your, hair every winter.\u201d\nMen came after the animals and plants. At first there were only a brother and sister until he struck her with a\nfish and told her to multiply, and so it was. In seven days a child was born to her, and thereafter every seven days\nanother, and they increased very fast until there was danger that the world could not keep them. Then it was made\nthat a woman should have only one child in a year, and it has been so ever since.\n2. The First Fire\nIn the beginning there was no fire, and the world was cold, until the Thunders (Ani\u2019-Hy\u00fb\u00f1\u2019t\u00efkw\u00e4l\u00e2\u2019sk\u00ef), who\nlived up in G\u00e4l\u00fb\u00f1\u2019l\u00e4t\u00ef, sent their lightning and put fire into the bottom of a hollow sycamore tree which grew on an\nisland. The animals knew it was there, because they could see the smoke coming out at the top, but they could not\nget to it on account of the water, so they held a council to decide what to do. This was a long time ago.\nEvery animal that could fly or swim was anxious to go after the fire. The Raven offered, and because he was\nso large and strong they thought he could surely do the work, so he was sent first. He flew high and far across the\nwater and alighted on the sycamore tree, but while he was wondering what to do next, the heat had scorched all his\nfeathers black, and he was frightened and came back without the fire. The little Screech-owl (Wa\u2019huhu\u2019) volunteered\nto go, and reached the place safely, but while he was looking down into the hollow tree a blast of hot air came up\nand nearly burned out his eves. He managed to fly home as best he could, but it was a long time before he could see\nwell, and his eyes are red to this day. Then the Hooting Owl (U\u2019guku\u2019) and the Horned Owl (Tsk\u00efl\u00ef\u2019) went, but by the\ntime they got to the hollow tree the fire was burning so fiercely that the smoke nearly blinded them, and the ashes\ncarried up by the wind made white rings about their eyes. They had to come home again without the fire, but with\nall their rubbing they were never able to get rid of the white rings.\nNow no more of the birds would venture, and so the little Uksu\u2019h\u00ef snake, the black racer, said he would go\nthrough the water and bring back some fire. He swam across to the island and crawled through the grass to the tree,\nand went in by a small hole at the bottom. The heat and smoke were too much for him, too, and after dodging about\nblindly over the hot ashes until he was almost on fire himself he managed by good luck to get out again at the same\nhole, but his body had been scorched black, and he has ever since had the habit of darting and doubling on his track\nas if trying to escape from close quarters. He came back, and the great blacksnake, G\u00fble\u2019g\u00ef, \u201cThe Climber,\u201d offered\nto go for fire. He swam over to the island and climbed up the tree on the outside, as the blacksnake always does, but\nwhen he put his head down into the hole the smoke choked him so that he fell into the burning stump, and before\nhe could climb out again he was as black as the Uksu\u2019h\u00ef.\nNow they held another council, for still there was no fire, and the world was cold, but birds, snakes, and\nfour-footed animals, all had some excuse for not going, because they were all afraid to venture near the burning\nsycamore, until at last K\u00e4n\u00e4ne\u2019sk\u00ef Amai\u2019y\u00ebh\u00ef (the Water Spider) said she would go. This is not the water spider that\nlooks like a mosquito, but the other one, with black downy hair and red stripes on her body. She can run on top of\n333 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nthe water or dive to the bottom, so there would be no trouble to get over to the island, but the question was, \u2018How\ncould she bring back the fire?\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ll manage that,\u201d said the Water Spider; so she spun a thread from her body and\nwove it into a tusti bowl, which she fastened on her back. Then she crossed over to the island and through the grass\nto where the fire was still burning. She put one little coal of fire into her bowl, and came back with it, and ever since\nwe have had fire, and the Water Spider still keeps her tusti bowl.\n3. Kana\u2019t\u00ef and Selu: The Origin of Game and Corn\nWhen I was a boy this is what the old men told me they had heard when they were boys.\nLong years ago, soon after the world was made, a hunter and his wife lived at Pilot Knob with their only child,\na little boy. The father\u2019s name was Kana\u2019t\u00ef (The Lucky Hunter), and his wife was called Selu (Corn). No matter when\nKana\u2019t\u00ef went into the wood, he never failed to bring back a load of game, which his wife would cut up and prepare,\nwashing off the blood from the meat in the river near the house. The little boy used to play down by the river every\nday, and one morning the old people thought they heard laughing and talking in the bushes as though there were\ntwo children there. When the boy came home at night his parents asked him who had been playing with him all\nday. \u201cHe comes out of the water,\u201d said the boy, \u201cand he calls himself my elder brother. He says his mother was cruel\nto him and threw him into the river.\u201d Then they knew that the strange boy had sprung from the blood of the game\nwhich Selu had washed off at the river\u2019s edge.\nEvery day when the little boy went out to play the other would join him, but as he always went back again into\nthe water the old people never had a chance to see him. At last one evening Kana\u2019t\u00ef said to his son, \u201cTomorrow,\nwhen the other boy comes to play, get him to wrestle with you, and when you have your arms around him hold on\nto him and call for us.\u201d The boy promised to do as he was told, so the next day as soon as his playmate appeared he\nchallenged him to a wrestling match. The other agreed at once, but as soon as they had their arms around each oth-\ner, Kana\u2019t\u00ef\u2019s boy began to scream for his father. The old folks at once came running down, and as soon as the Wild\nBoy saw them he struggled to free himself and cried out, \u201cLet me go; you threw me away!\u201d but his brother held on\nuntil the parents reached the spot, when they seized the Wild Boy and took him home with them. They kept him in\nthe house until they had tamed him, but he was always wild and artful in his disposition, and was the leader of his\nbrother in every mischief. It was not long until the old people discovered that he had magic powers, and they called\nhim I\u2019n\u00e4ge-ut\u00e4s\u00fb\u00f1\u2019h\u00ef (He-who-grew-up-wild).\nWhenever Kana\u2019t\u00ef went into the mountains he always brought back a fat buck or doe, or maybe a couple of tur-\nkeys. One day the Wild Boy said to his brother, \u201cI wonder where our father gets all that game; let\u2019s follow him next\ntime and find out.\u201d A few days afterward Kana\u2019t\u00ef took a bow and some feathers in his hand and started off toward\nthe west. The boys waited a little while and then went after him, keeping out of sight until they saw him go into\na swamp where there were a great many of the small reeds that hunters use to make arrow shafts. Then the Wild\nBoy changed himself into a puff of birds down, which the wind took up and carried until it alighted upon Kana\u2019t\u00ef\u2019s\nshoulder just as he entered the swamp, but Kana\u2019t\u00ef\u2019 knew nothing about it. The old man cut reeds, fitted the feath-\ners to them and made some arrows, and the Wild Boy\u2014in his other shape\u2014thought, \u201cI wonder what those things\nare for?\u201d When Kana\u2019t\u00ef had his arrows finished he came out of the swamp and went on again. The wind blew the\ndown from his shoulder, and it fell in the woods, when the Wild Boy took his right shape again and went back and\ntold his brother what he had seen. Keeping out of sight of their father, they followed him up the mountain until he\nstopped at a certain place and lifted a large rock. At once there ran out a buck, which Kana\u2019t\u00ef shot, and then lifting it\nupon his back he started for home again. \u201cOho!\u201d exclaimed the boys, \u201che keeps all the deer shut up in that hole, and\nwhenever he wants meat he just lets one out and kills it with those things he made in the swamp.\u201d They hurried and\nreached home before their father, who had the heavy deer to carry, and he never knew that they had followed.\nA few days later the boys went back to the swamp, cut some reeds, and made seven arrows and then started up\nthe mountain to where their father kept the game. When they got to the place, they raised the rock and a deer came\nrunning out. Just as they drew back to shoot it, another came out, and then another and another, until the boys got\nconfused and forgot what they were about. In those days all the deer had their tails hanging down like other ani-\nmals, but as a buck was running past the Wild Boy struck its tail with his arrow so that it pointed upward. The boys\nthought this good sport, and when the next one ran past the Wild Boy struck its tail so that it stood straight up, and\nhis brother struck the next one so hard with his arrow that the deer\u2019s tail was almost curled over his back. The deer\ncarries his tail this way ever since. The deer came running past until the last one had come out of the hole and es-\ncaped into the forest. Then came droves of raccoons, rabbits, and all the other four-footed animals-all but the bear,\nbecause there was no bear then. Last came great flocks of turkeys, pigeons, and partridges that darkened the air like\na cloud and made such a noise with their wings that Kana\u2019t\u00ef, sitting at home, heard the sound like distant thunder\non the mountains and said to himself, \u201cMy bad boys have got into trouble; I must go and see what they are doing.\u201d\nSo he went up the mountain, and when he came to the place where he kept the game he found the two boys\n334 Myths of the Cherokee\nstanding by the rock, and all the birds and animals were gone. Kana\u2019t\u00ef was furious, but without saying a word he\nwent down into the cave and kicked the covers off four jars in one corner, when out swarmed bedbugs, fleas, lice,\nand gnats, and got all over the boys. They screamed with pain and fright and tried to beat off the insects, but the\nthousands of vermin crawled over them and bit and stung them until both dropped down nearly dead. Kana\u2019t\u00ef\nstood looking on until he thought they had been punished enough, when he knocked off the vermin and made the\nboys a talk. \u201cNow, you rascals,\u201d said he, \u201cyou have always had plenty to eat and never had to work for it. Whenever\nyou were hungry all I had to do was to come up here and get a deer or a turkey and bring it home for your mother\nto cook; but now you have let out all the animals, and after this when you want a deer to eat you will have to hunt all\nover the woods for it, and then maybe not find one. Go home now to your mother, while I see if I can find some-\nthing to eat for supper.\u201d\nWhen the boys got home again they were very tired and hungry and asked their mother for something to eat.\n\u201cThere is no meat,\u201d said Selu, \u201cbut wait a little while and I\u2019ll get you something.\u201d So she took a basket and started out\nto the storehouse. This storehouse was built upon poles high up from the ground, to keep it out of the reach of ani-\nmals, and there was a ladder to climb up by, and one door, but no other opening. Every day when Selu got ready to\ncook the dinner she would go out to the storehouse with a basket and bring it back full of corn and beans. The boys\nhad never been inside the storehouse, so wondered where all the corn and beans could come from, as the house was\nnot a very large one; so as soon as Selu went out of the door the Wild Boy said to his brother, \u201cLet\u2019s go and see what\nshe does.\u201d They ran around and climbed up at the back of the storehouse and pulled out a piece of clay from between\nthe logs, so that they could look in. There they saw Selu standing in the middle of the room with the basket in front\nof her on the floor. Leaning over the basket, she rubbed her stomach\u2014so\u2014and the basket was half full of corn. Then\nshe rubbed under her armpits\u2014so\u2014and the basket was full to the top with beans. The boys looked at each other and\nsaid, \u201cThis will never do; our mother is a witch. If we eat any of that it will poison us. We must kill her.\u201d\nWhen the boys came back into the house, she knew their thoughts before they spoke. \u201cSo you are going to kill\nme?\u201d said Selu. \u201cYes,\u201d said the boys, \u201cyou are a witch.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said their mother, \u201cwhen you have killed me, clear a\nlarge piece of ground in front of the house and drag my body seven times around the circle. Then drag me seven\ntimes over the ground inside the circle, and stay up all night and watch, and in the morning you will have plenty of\ncorn.\u201d The boys killed her with their clubs, and cut off her head and put it up on the roof of the house with her face\nturned to the west, and told her to look for her husband. Then they set to work to clear the ground in front of the\nhouse, but instead of clearing the whole piece they cleared only seven little spots. This is why corn now grows only\nin a few places instead of over the whole world. They dragged the body of Selu around the circle, and wherever her\nblood fell on the ground the corn sprang up. But instead of dragging her body seven times across the ground they\ndragged it over only twice, which is the reason the Indians still work their crop but twice. The two brothers sat up\nand watched their corn all night, and in the morning it was full grown and ripe.\nWhen Kana\u2019t\u00ef came home at last, he looked around, but could not see Selu anywhere, and asked the boys where\nwas their mother. \u201cShe was a witch, and we killed her,\u201d said the boys; \u201cthere is her head up there on top of the\nhouse.\u201d When he saw his wife\u2019s head on the roof, he was very angry, and said, \u201cI won\u2019t stay with you any longer; I\nam going to the Wolf people.\u201d So he started off, but before he had gone far the Wild Boy changed himself again to\na tuft of down, which fell on Kana\u2019t\u00ef\u2019s shoulder. When Kana\u2019t\u00ef reached the settlement of the Wolf people, they were\nholding a council in the townhouse. He went in and sat down with the tuft of bird\u2019s down on his shoulder, but he\nnever noticed it. When the Wolf chief asked him his business, he said: \u201cI have two bad boys at home, and I want you\nto go in seven days from now and play ball against them.\u201d Although Kana\u2019t\u00ef spoke as though he wanted them to play\na game of ball, the Wolves knew that he meant for them to go and kill the two boys. They promised to go. Then the\nbird\u2019s down blew off from Kana\u2019t\u00ef\u2019s shoulder, and the smoke carried it up through the hole in the roof of the town-\nhouse. When it came down on the ground outside, the Wild Boy took his right shape again and went home and told\nhis brother all that he had heard in the townhouse. But when Kana\u2019t\u00ef left the Wolf people, he did not return home,\nbut went on farther.\nThe boys then began to get ready for the Wolves, and the Wild Boy\u2014the magician\u2014told his brother what to\ndo. They ran around the house in a wide circle until they had made a trail all around it excepting on the side from\nwhich the Wolves would come, where they left a small open space. Then they made four large bundles of arrows\nand placed them at four different points on the outside of the circle, after which they hid themselves in the woods\nand waited for the Wolves. In a day or two a whole party of Wolves came and surrounded the house to kill the boys.\nThe Wolves did not notice the trail around the house, because they came in where the boys had left the opening, but\nthe moment they went inside the circle the trail changed to a high brush fence and shut them in. Then the boys on\nthe outside took their arrows and began shooting them down, and as the Wolves could not jump over the fence they\nwere all killed, excepting a few that escaped through the opening into a great swamp close by. The boys ran around\nthe swamp, and a circle of fire sprang up in their tracks and set fire to the grass and bushes and burned up nearly all\nthe other wolves. Only two or three got away, and from these have come all the wolves that are now in the world.\n335 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nSoon afterward some strangers from a distance, who had heard that the brothers had a wonderful grain from\nwhich they made bread, came to ask for some, for none but Selu and her family had ever known corn before. The\nboys gave them seven grains of corn, which they told them to plant the next night on their way home, sitting up all\nnight to watch the corn, which would have seven ripe ears in the morning. These they were to plant the next night\nand watch in the same way, and so on every night until they reached home, when they would have corn enough\nto supply the whole people. The strangers lived seven days\u2019 journey away. They took the seven grains and watched\nall through the darkness until morning, when they saw seven tall stalks, each stalk bearing a ripened ear. They\ngathered the ears and went on their way. The next night they planted all their corn, and guarded it as before until\ndaybreak, when they found an abundant increase. But the way was long and the sun was hot, and the people grew\ntired. On the last night before reaching home they fell asleep, and in the morning the corn they had planted had not\neven sprouted. They brought with them to their settlement what corn they had left and planted it, and with care and\nattention were able to raise a crop. But ever since the corn must be watched and tended through half the year, which\nbefore would grow and ripen in a night.\nAs Kana\u2019t\u00ef did not return, the boys at last concluded to go and find him. The Wild Boy took a gaming wheel and\nrolled it toward the Darkening land. In a little while the wheel came rolling back, and the boys knew their father\nwas not there. He rolled it to the south and, to the north, and each time the wheel came back to him, and they knew\ntheir father was not there. Then he rolled it toward the Sunland, and it did not return. \u201cOur father is there,\u201d said\nthe Wild Boy, \u201clet us go and find him.\u201d So the two brothers set off toward the east, and after traveling a long time\nthey came upon Kana\u2019t\u00ef walking along with a little dog by his side. \u201cYou bad boys,\u201d said their father, \u201chave you come\nhere?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d they answered, \u201cWe always accomplish what we start out to do\u2014we are men.\u201d \u201cThis dog overtook me\nfour days ago,\u201d then said Kana\u2019t\u00ef, but the boys knew that the dog was the wheel which they had sent after him to find\nhim. \u201cWell,\u201d said Kana\u2019t\u00ef, \u201cas you have found me, we may as well travel together, but I shall take the lead.\u201d\nSoon they came to a swamp, and Kana\u2019t\u00ef told them there was something dangerous there and they must keep\naway from it. He went on ahead, but as soon as he was out of sight the Wild Boy said to his brother, \u201cCome and let\nus see what is in the swamp.\u201d They went in together, and in the middle of the swamp they found a large panther\nasleep. The Wild Boy got out an arrow and shot the panther in the side of the head. The panther turned his head\nand the other boy shot him on that side. He turned his head away again and the two brothers shot together\u2014tust,\ntust, tust! But the panther was not hurt by the arrows and paid no more attention to the boys. They came out of the\nswamp and soon overtook Kana\u2019t\u00ef, who was waiting for them. \u201cDid you find it?\u201d asked Kana\u2019t\u00ef. \u201cYes,\u201d said the boys,\n\u201cWe found it, but it never hurt us. We are men.\u201d Kana\u2019t\u00ef was surprised, but said nothing, and they went on again.\nAfter a while he turned to them and said, \u201cNow you must be careful. We are coming to a tribe called the\nAn\u00e4da\u2019d\u00fb\u00f1t\u00e4sk\u00ef. (\u201cRoasters,\u201d i.e., cannibals), and if they get you they will put you into a pot and feast on you.\u201d\nThen he went on ahead. Soon the boys came to a tree which had been struck by lightning, and the Wild Boy\ndirected his brother to gather some of the splinters from the tree and told him what to do with them. In a little\nwhile they came to the settlement of the cannibals, who, as soon as they saw the boys, came running out crying,\n\u201cGood, here are two nice fat strangers. Now we\u2019ll have a grand feast!\u201d They caught the boys and dragged them\ninto the townhouse, and sent word to all the people of the settlement to come to the feast. They made up a great\nfire, put water into a large pot and set it to boiling, and then seized the Wild Boy and put him down into it. His\nbrother was not in the least frightened and made no attempt to escape, but quietly knelt down and began putting\nthe splinters into the fire, as if to make it burn better. When the cannibals thought the meat was about ready they\nlifted the pot from the fire, and that instant a blinding light filled the townhouse, and the lightning began to dart\nfrom one side to the other, striking down the cannibals until not one of them was left alive. Then the lightning\nwent up through the smokehole, and the next moment there were the two boys standing outside the townhouse\nas though nothing had happened. They went on and soon met Kana\u2019t\u00ef, who seemed much surprised to see them,\nand said, \u201cWhat! Are you here again?\u201d \u201cO, yes, we never give up. We are great men!\u201d \u201cWhat did the cannibals do\nto you?\u201d \u201cWe met them and they brought us to their townhouse, but they never hurt us.\u201d Kana\u2019t\u00ef said nothing\nmore, and they went on.\n* * * * * * *\nHe soon got out of sight of the boys, but they kept on until they came to the end of the world, where the sun\ncomes out. The sky was just coming down when they got there, but they waited until it went up again, and then they\nwent through and climbed up on the other side. There they found Kana\u2019t\u00ef and Selu sitting together. The old folk\nreceived them kindly and were glad to see them, telling them they might stay there a while, but then they must go\nto live where the sun goes down. The boys stayed with their parents seven days and then went on toward the Dark-\nening land, where they are now. We call them Anisga\u2019ya Tsunsdi\u2019 (The Little Men), and when they talk to each other\nwe hear low rolling thunder in the west.\n336 Myths of the Cherokee\nAfter Kana\u2019t\u00ef\u2019s boys had let the deer out from the cave where their father used to keep them, the hunters\ntramped about in the woods for a long time without finding any game, so that the people were very hungry. At last\nthey heard that the Thunder Boys were now living in the far west, beyond the sun door, and that if they were sent\nfor they could bring back the game. So they sent messengers for them, and the boys came and sat down in the mid-\ndle of the townhouse and began to sing.\nAt the first song there was a roaring sound like a strong wind in the northwest, and it grew louder and nearer\nas the boys sang on, until at the seventh song a whole herd of deer, led by a large buck, came out from the woods.\nThe boys had told the people to be ready with their bows and arrows, and when the song was ended and all the deer\nwere close around the townhouse, the hunters shot into them and killed as many as they needed before the herd\ncould get back into the timber.\nThen the Thunder Boys went back to the Darkening land, but before they left they taught the people the seven\nsongs with which to call up the deer. It all happened so long ago that the songs are now forgotten\u2014all but two,\nwhich the hunters still sing whenever they go after deer.\nWahnenauhi Version\nAfter the world had been brought up from under the water, \u201cThey then made a man and a woman and led them\naround the edge of the island. On arriving at the starting place they planted some corn, and then told the man and\nwoman to go around the way they had been led. This they did, and on returning they found the corn up and grow-\ning nicely. They were then told to continue the circuit. Each trip consumed more time. At last the corn was ripe and\nready for use.\u201d\n* * * * * * *\nAnother story is told of how sin came into the world. A man and a woman reared a large family of children in\ncomfort and plenty, with very little trouble about providing food for them. Every morning the father went forth\nand very soon returned bringing with him a deer, or a turkey, or some other animal or fowl. At the same time the\nmother went out and soon returned with a large basket filled with ears of corn which she shelled and pounded in a\nmortar, thus making meal for bread.\nWhen the children grew up, seeing with what apparent ease food was provided for them, they talked to each\nother about it, wondering that they never saw such things as their parents brought in. At last, one proposed to\nwatch when their parents went out and to follow them.\nAccordingly, the next morning the plan was carried out. Those who followed the father saw him stop at a\nshort distance from the cabin and turn over a large stone that appeared to be carelessly leaned against another. On\nlooking closely they saw an entrance to a large cave, and in it were many different kinds of animals and birds, such\nas their father had sometimes brought in for food. The man standing at the entrance called a deer, which was lying\nat some distance and back of some other animals. It rose immediately as it heard the call and came close up to him.\nHe picked it up, closed the mouth of the cave, and returned, not once seeming to suspect what his sons had done.\nWhen the old man was fairly out of sight, his sons, rejoicing how they had outwitted him, left their hiding\nplace and went to the cave, saying they would show the old folks that they, too, could bring in something. They\nmoved the stone away, though it was very heavy and they were obliged to use all their united strength. When the\ncave was opened, the animals, instead of waiting to be picked up, all made a rush for the entrance, and leaping\npast the frightened and bewildered boys, scattered in all directions and disappeared in the wilderness, while the\nguilty offenders could do nothing but gaze in stupefied amazement as they saw them escape. There were animals\nof all kinds, large and small\u2014buffalo, deer, elk, antelope, raccoons, and squirrels; even catamounts and panthers,\nwolves and foxes, and many others, all fleeing together. At the same time birds of every kind were seen emerging\nfrom the opening, all in the same wild confusion as the quadrupeds\u2014turkeys, geese, swans, ducks, quails, eagles,\nhawks, and owls.\nThose who followed the mother saw her enter a small cabin, which they had never seen before, and close the door.\nThe culprits found a small crack through which they could peer. They saw the woman place a basket on the ground\nand standing over it shake herself vigorously, jumping up and down\u2014when lo and behold!\u2014large ears of corn began\nto fall into the basket. When it was well filled she took it up and, placing it on her head, came out, fastened the door,\nand prepared their breakfast as usual. When the meal had been finished in silence the man spoke to his children,\ntelling them that he was aware of what they had done; that now he must die and they would be obliged to provide for\nthemselves. He made bows and arrows for them, then sent them to hunt for the animals which they had turned loose.\nThen the mother told them that as they had found out her secret she could do nothing more for them; that she\nwould die, and they must drag her body around over the ground; that wherever her body was dragged corn would\ncome up. Of this they were to make their bread. She told them that they must always save some for seed and plant\nevery year.\n337 Compact Anthology of World Literature\n4. Origin of Disease and Medicine\nIn the old days the beasts, birds, fishes, insects, and plants could all talk, and they and the people lived togeth-\ner in peace and friendship. But as time went on the people increased so rapidly that their settlements spread over\nthe whole earth, and the poor animals found themselves beginning to be cramped for room. This was bad enough,\nbut to make it worse Man invented bows, knives, blowguns, spears, and hooks, and began to slaughter the larger\nanimals, birds, and fishes for their flesh or their skins, while the smaller creatures, such as the frogs and worms,\nwere crushed and trodden upon without thought, out of pure carelessness or contempt. So the animals resolved to\nconsult upon measures for their common safety.\nThe Bears were the first to meet in council in their townhouse under Kuw\u00e2\u2019h\u00ef mountain, the \u201cMulberry place,\u201d\nand the old White Bear chief presided. After each in turn had complained of the way in which Man killed their\nfriends, ate their flesh, and used their skins for his own purposes, it was decided to begin war at once against him.\nSomeone asked what weapons Man used to destroy them. \u201cBows and arrows, of course,\u201d cried all the Bears in cho-\nrus. \u201cAnd what are they made of?\u201d was the next question. \u201cThe bow of wood, and the string of our entrails,\u201d replied\none of the Bears. It was then proposed that they make a bow and some arrows and see if they, could not use the\nsame weapons against Man himself. So one Bear got a nice piece of locust wood and another sacrificed himself for\nthe good of the rest in order to furnish a piece of his entrails for the string. But when everything was ready and the\nfirst Bear stepped up to make the trial, it was found that in letting the arrow fly after drawing back the bow, his long\nclaws caught the string and spoiled the shot. This was annoying, but someone suggested that they might trim his\nclaws, which was accordingly done, and on a second trial it was found that the arrow went straight to the mark. But\nhere the chief, the old White Bear, objected, saying it was necessary that they should have long claws in order to be\nable to climb trees. \u201cOne of us has already died to furnish the bowstring, and if we now cut off our claws we must all\nstarve together. It is better to trust to the teeth and claws that nature gave us, for it is plain that man\u2019s weapons were\nnot intended for us.\u201d\nNo one could think of any better plan, so the old chief dismissed the council and the Bears dispersed to the\nwoods and thickets without having concerted any way to prevent the increase of the human race. Had the result of\nthe council been otherwise, we should now be at war with the Bears, but as it is, the hunter does not even ask the\nBear\u2019s pardon when he kills one.\nThe Deer next held a council under their chief, the Little Deer, and after some talk decided to send rheumatism\nto every hunter who should kill one of them unless he took care to ask their pardon for the offense. They sent notice\nof their decision to the nearest settlement of Indians and told them at the same time what to do when necessity\nforced them to kill one of the Deer tribe. Now, whenever the hunter shoots a Deer, the Little Deer, who is swift as\nthe wind and can not be wounded, runs quickly up to the spot and, bending over the blood-stains, asks the spirit\nof the Deer if it has heard the prayer of the hunter for pardon. If the reply be \u201cYes,\u201d all is well, and the Little Deer\ngoes on his way; but if the reply be \u201cNo,\u201d he follows on the trail of the hunter, guided by the drops of blood on the\nground, until he arrives at his cabin in the settlement, when the Little Deer enters invisibly and strikes the hunter\nwith rheumatism, so that he becomes at once a helpless cripple. No hunter who has regard for his health ever fails\nto ask pardon of the Deer for killing it, although some hunters who have not learned the prayer may try to turn\naside the Little Deer from his pursuit by building a fire behind them in the trail.\nNext came the Fishes and Reptiles, who had their own complaints against Man. They held their council to-\ngether and determined to make their victims dream of snakes twining about them in slimy folds and blowing foul\nbreath in their faces, or to make them dream of eating raw or decaying fish, so that they would lose appetite, sicken,\nand die. This is why people dream about snakes and fish.\nFinally the Birds, Insects, and smaller animals came together for the same purpose, and the Grubworm was\nchief of the council. It was decided that each in turn should give an opinion, and then they would vote on the ques-\ntion as to whether or not Man was guilty. Seven votes should be enough to condemn him. One after another de-\nnounced Man\u2019s cruelty and injustice toward the other animals and voted in favor of his death. The Frog spoke first,\nsaying: \u201cWe must do something to check the increase of the race, or people will become so numerous that we shall\nbe crowded from off the earth. See how they have kicked me about because I\u2019m ugly, as they say, until my back is\ncovered with sores;\u201d and here he showed the spots on his skin. Next came the Bird\u2014no one remembers now which\none it was\u2014who condemned Man \u201cbecause he burns my feet off,\u201d meaning the way in which the hunter barbe-\ncues birds by impaling them on a stick set over the fire, so that their feathers and tender feet are singed off. Others\nfollowed in the same strain. The Ground-squirrel alone ventured to say a good word for Man, who seldom hurt him\nbecause he was so small, but this made the others so angry that they fell upon the Ground-squirrel and tore him\nwith their claws, and the stripes are on his back to this day.\nThey began then to devise and name so many new diseases, one after another, that had not their invention\nat last failed them, no one of the human race would have been able to survive. The Grubworm grew constant-\nly more pleased as the name of each disease was called off, until at last they reached the end of the list, when\n338 Myths of the Cherokee\nsomeone proposed to make menstruation sometimes fatal to women. On this he rose-up in his place and cried:\n\u201cWad\u00e2\u00f1\u2019! [Thanks!] I\u2019m glad some more of them will die, for they are getting so thick that they tread on me.\u201d The\nthought fairly made him shake with joy, so that he fell over backward and could not get on his feet again, but had to\nwriggle off on his back, as the Grubworm has done ever since.\nWhen the Plants, who were friendly to Man, heard what had been done by the animals, they determined to\ndefeat the latter\u2019s evil designs. Each Tree, Shrub, and Herb, down even to the Grasses and Mosses, agreed to furnish\na cure for some one of the diseases named, and each said: \u201cI shall appear to help Man when he calls upon me in his\nneed.\u201d Thus came medicine; and the plants, every one of which has its use if we only knew it, furnish the remedy to\ncounteract the evil wrought by the revengeful animals. Even weeds were made for some good purpose, which we\nmust find out for ourselves. When the doctor does not know what medicine to use for a sick man the spirit of the\nplant tells him.\n5. The Daughter of the Sun\nThe Sun lived on the other side of the sky vault, but her daughter lived in the middle of the sky, directly above\nthe earth, and every day as the Sun was climbing along the sky arch to the west she used to stop at her daughter\u2019s\nhouse for dinner.\nNow, the Sun hated the people on the earth, because they could never look straight at her without screwing up\ntheir faces. She said to her brother, the Moon, \u201cMy grandchildren are ugly; they grin all over their faces when they\nlook at me.\u201d But the Moon said, \u201cI like my younger brothers; I think they are very handsome\u201d \u2014because they always\nsmiled pleasantly when they saw him in the sky at night, for his rays were milder.\nThe Sun was jealous and planned to kill all the people, so every day when she got near her daughter\u2019s house she\nsent down such sultry rays that there was a great fever and the people died by hundreds, until everyone had lost\nsome friend and there was fear that no one would be left. They went for help to the Little Men, who said the only\nway to save themselves was to kill the Sun.\nThe Little Men made medicine and changed two men to snakes, the Spreading-adder and the Copperhead, and\nsent them to watch near the door of the daughter of the Sun to bite the old Sun when she came next day. They went\ntogether and bid near the house until the Sun came, but when the Spreading-adder was about to spring, the bright\nlight blinded him and he could only spit out yellow slime, as he does to this day when he tries to bite. She called\nhim a nasty thing and went by into the house, and the Copperhead crawled off without trying to do anything.\nSo the people still died from the heat, and they went to the Little Men a second time for help. The Little Men\nmade medicine again and changed one man into the great Uktena and another into the Rattlesnake and sent them\nto watch near the house and kill the old Sun when\nshe came for dinner. They made the Uktena very\nlarge, with horns on his head, and everyone thought\nhe would be sure to do the work, but the Rattle-\nsnake was so quick and eager that he got ahead and\ncoiled up just outside the house, and when the Sun\u2019s\ndaughter opened the door to look out for her\nmother, he sprang up and bit her and she fell dead\nin the doorway. He forgot to wait for the old Sun,\nbut went back to the people, and the Uktena was so\nvery angry that he went back, too. Since then we\npray to the rattlesnake and do not kill him, because\nhe is kind and never tries to bite if we do not\ndisturb him. The Uktena grew angrier all the time\nand very dangerous, so that if he even looked at a\nman, that man\u2019s family would die. After a long time\nthe people held a council and decided that he was\ntoo dangerous to be with them, so they sent him up\nto G\u00e4l\u00fb\u00f1\u2019l\u00e4t\u00ef, and he is there now. The Spread-\ning-adder, the Copperhead, the Rattlesnake, and the\nImage 12.2: three Cherokee Diplomats in London | Three Cher-\nUktena were all men.\nokee men with traditional outfits and styles stand beside a contemporary\nWhen the Sun found her daughter dead, she London man, sharply contrasting their appearances.\nwent into the house and grieved, and the people did\nnot die any more, but now the world was dark all Author: Henry Timberlake\nthe time, because the Sun would not come out. They Source: Wikimedia Commons\nLicense: Public Domain\n339 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nwent again to the Little Men, and these told them that if they wanted the Sun to come out again they must bring\nback her daughter from Ts\u00fbsgin\u00e2\u2019\u00ef, the Ghost country, in Us\u2019\u00fb\u00f1hi\u2019y\u00ef, the Darkening land in the west. They chose\nseven men to go, and gave each a sourwood rod a hand-breadth long. The Little Men told them they must take a\nbox with them, and when they got to Ts\u00fbsgin\u00e2\u2019\u00ef they would find all the ghosts at a dance. They must stand outside\nthe circle, and when the young woman passed in the dance they must strike her with the rods and she would fall to\nthe ground. Then they must put her into the box and bring her back to her mother, but they must be very sure not\nto open the box, even a little way, until they were home again.\nThey took the rods and a box and traveled seven days to the west until they came to the Darkening land. There\nwere a great many people there, and they were having a dance just as if they were at home in the settlements. The\nyoung woman was in the outside circle, and as she swung around to where the seven men were standing, one struck\nher with his rod and she turned her head and saw him. As she came around the second time another touched her\nwith his rod, and then another and another, until at the seventh round she fell out of the ring, and they put her into\nthe box and closed the lid fast. The other ghosts seemed never to notice what had happened.\nThey took up the box and started home toward the east. In a little while the girl came to life again and begged to\nbe let out of the box, but they made no answer and went on. Soon she called again and said she was hungry, but still\nthey made no answer and went on. After another while she spoke again and called for a drink and pleaded so that it\nwas very hard to listen to her, but the men who carried the box said nothing and still went on. When at last they\nwere very near home, she called again and begged\nthem to raise the lid just a little, because she was\nsmothering. They were afraid she was really dying\nnow, so they lifted the lid a little to give her air, but as\nthey did so there was a fluttering sound inside and\nsomething flew past them into the thicket and they\nheard a redbird cry, \u201ckwish! kwish! Kwish!\u201d in the\nbushes. They shut down the lid and went on again to\nthe settlements, but when they got there and opened\nthe box it was empty.\nSo we know the Redbird is the daughter of the\nSun, and if the men had kept the box closed, as the\nLittle Men told them to do, they would have brought\nher home safely, and we could bring back our other\nfriends also from the Ghost country, but now when\nthey die we can never bring them back.\nThe Sun had been glad when they started to the\nGhost country, but when they came back without her\ndaughter she grieved and cried, \u201cMy daughter, my\ndaughter,\u201d and wept until her tears made a flood upon\nthe earth, and the people were afraid the world would\nbe drowned. They held another council, and sent their\nhandsomest young men and women to amuse her so\nthat she would stop crying. They danced before the\nImage 12.3: Sequoya\u2019s Arranged Syllabary | The syllabary for\nwriting the Cherokee language, designed by Sequoya.

How They Brought Back the Tobacco\nIn the beginning of the world, when people and animals were all the same, there was only one tobacco plant,\nto which they all came for their tobacco until the Dag\u00fbl`k\u00fb geese stole it and carried it far away to the south. The\npeople were suffering without it, and there was one old woman who grew so thin and weak that everybody said she\nwould soon die unless she could get tobacco to keep her alive.\nDifferent animals offered to go for it, one after another, the larger ones first and then the smaller ones, but the\nDag\u00fbl`k\u00fb saw and killed every one before he could get to the plant. After the others the little Mole tried to reach it\nby going under the ground, but the Dag\u00fbl`k\u00fb saw his track and killed him as he came out.\nAt last the Hummingbird offered, but the others said he was entirely too small and might as well stay at home.\n340 Myths of the Cherokee\nHe begged them to let him try, so they showed him a plant in a field and told him to let them see how he would go\nabout it. The next moment he was gone and they saw him sitting on the plant, and then in a moment he was back\nagain, but no one had seen him going or coming, because he was so swift. \u201cThis is the way I\u2019ll do,\u201d said the Hum-\nmingbird, so they let him try.\nHe flew off to the east, and when he came in sight of the tobacco the Dag\u00fbl`k\u00fb were watching all about it,\nbut they could not see him because he was so small and flew so swiftly. He darted down on the plant\u2014tsa!\u2014and\nsnatched off the top with the leaves and seeds, and was off again before the Dag\u00fbl`k\u00fb knew what had happened.\nBefore he got home with the tobacco the old woman had fainted and they thought she was dead, but he blew the\nsmoke into her nostrils, and with a cry of \u201cTs\u00e2\u2019l\u00fb! [Tobacco!]\u201d she opened her eyes and was alive again.\nSecond Version\nThe people had tobacco in the beginning, but they had used it all, and there was great suffering for want of it.\nThere was one old man so old that he had to be kept alive by smoking, and as his son did not want to see him die\nhe decided to go himself to try and get some more. The tobacco country was far in the south, with high mountains\nall around it, and the passes were guarded, so that it was very hard to get into it, but the young man was a conjurer\nand was not afraid. He traveled southward until he came to the mountains on the border of the tobacco country.\nThen he opened his medicine bag and took out a hummingbird skin and put it over himself like a dress. Now he\nwas a hummingbird and flew over the mountains to the tobacco field and pulled some of the leaves and seed and\nput them into his medicine bag. He was so small and swift that the guards, whoever they were, did not see him,\nand when he had taken as much as he could carry he flew back over the mountains in the same way. Then he took\noff the hummingbird skin and put it into his medicine bag, and was a man again. He started home, and on his way\ncame to a tree that had a hole in the trunk, like a door, near the first branches, and a very pretty woman was looking\nout from it. He stopped and tried to climb the tree, but although he was a good climber he found that he always\nslipped back. He put on a pair of medicine moccasins from his pouch, and then he could climb the tree, but when\nhe reached the first branches he looked up and the hole was still as far away as before. He climbed higher and high-\ner, but every time he looked up the hole seemed to be farther than before, until at last he was tired and came down\nagain. When he reached home he found his father very weak. but still alive, and one draw at the pipe made him\nstrong again. The people planted the seed and have had tobacco ever since.\n7. The Journey to the Sunrise\nA long time ago several young men made up their minds to find the place where the Sun lives and see what the\nSun is like. They got ready their bows and arrows, their parched corn and extra moccasins, and started out toward\nthe east. At first they met tribes they knew, then they came to tribes they had only heard about, and at last to others\nof which they had never heard.\nThere was a tribe of root eaters and another of acorn eaters, with great piles of acorn shells near their houses. In\none tribe they found a sick man dying, and were told it was the custom there when a man died to bury his wife in\nthe same grave with him. They waited until he was dead, when they saw his friends lower the body into a great pit,\nso deep and dark that from the top they could not see the bottom. Then a rope was tied around the woman\u2019s body,\ntogether with a bundle of pine knots, a lighted pine knot was put into her hand, and she was lowered into the pit to\ndie there in the darkness after the last pine knot was burned.\nThe young men traveled on until they came at last to the sunrise place where the sky reaches down to the\nground. They found that the sky was an arch or vault of solid rock hung above the earth and was always swinging\nup and down, so that when it went up there was an open place like a door between the sky and ground, and when it\nswung back the door was shut. The Sun came out of this door from the east and climbed along on the inside of the\narch. It had a human figure, but was too bright for them to see clearly and too hot to come very near. They waited\nuntil the Sun had come out and then tried to get through while the door was still open, but just as the first one was\nin the doorway the rock came down and crushed him. The other six were afraid to try it, and as they were now at\nthe end of the world they turned around and started back again, but they had traveled so far that they were old men\nwhen they reached home.\n8. The Moon and the Thunders.\nThe Sun was a young woman and lived in the East, while her brother, the Moon. lived in the West. The girl had\na lover who used to come every month in the dark of the moon to court her. He would come at night, and leave\nbefore daylight, and although she talked with him she could not see his face in the dark, and he would not tell her\nhis name, until she was wondering all the time who it could be. At last she hit upon a plan to find out, so the next\n341 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ntime he came, as they were sitting together in the dark of the \u00e2si, she slyly dipped her hand into the cinders and\nashes of the fireplace and rubbed it over his face, saying, \u201cYour face is cold; you must have suffered from the wind,\u201d\nand pretending to be very sorry for him, but he did not know that she had ashes on her hand. After a while he left\nher and went away again.\nThe next night when the Moon came up in the sky his face was covered with spots, and then his sister knew he\nwas the one who had been coming to see her. He was so much ashamed to have her know it that he kept as far away as\nhe could at the other end of the sky all the night. Ever since he tries to keep a long way behind the Sun, and when he\ndoes sometimes have to come near her in the west he makes himself as thin as a ribbon so that he can hardly be seen.\nSome old people say that the moon is a ball which was thrown up against the sky in a game a long time ago.\nThey say that two towns were playing against each other, but one of them had the best runners and had almost won\nthe game, when the leader of the other side picked up the ball with his hand\u2014a thing that is not allowed in the\nImage 12.4: Fain\u2019s Island\ngame\u2014and tried to throw it to the goal, but it struck against the solid sky vault and was fastened there, to remind\nShell Gorget | Shell artwork of\nplayers never to cheat.

License: Public Domain\nThe common people call both Sun and Moon N\u00fb\u00f1d\u00e4, one being \u2018N\u00fb\u00f1d\u00e4 that dwells in the day\u201d and the other\n\u201cN\u00fb\u00f1d\u00e4 that dwells in the night,\u201d but the priests call the Sun Su\u2019t\u00e4lidih\u00ef\u2019, \u201cSix-killer,\u201d and the Moon Ge\u2019`y\u00e4gu\u2019ga,\nthough nobody knows now what this word means, or why they use these names. Sometimes people ask the Moon\nnot to let it rain or snow.\nThe great Thunder and his sons, the two Thunder boys, live far in the west above the sky vault. The lightning\nand the rainbow are their beautiful dress. The priests pray to the Thunder and call him the Red Man, because that\nis the brightest color of his dress. There are other Thunders that live lower down, in the cliffs and mountains, and\nunder waterfalls, and travel on invisible bridges from one high peak to another where they have their town houses.\nThe great Thunders above the sky are kind and helpful when we pray to them, but these others are always plotting\nmischief. One must not point at the rainbow, or one\u2019s finger will swell at the lower joint.\n9. What the Stars Are Like\nThere are different opinions about the stars. Some say they are balls of light, others say they are human, but\nmost people say they are living creatures covered with luminous fur or feathers.\nOne night a hunting party camping in the mountains noticed two lights like large stars moving along the top\nof a distant ridge. They wondered and watched until the light disappeared on the other side. The next night, and\nthe next, they saw the lights again moving along the ridge, and after talking over the matter decided to go on the\nmorrow and try to learn the cause. In the morning they started out and went until they came to the ridge, where,\nafter searching some time, they found two strange creatures about so large (making a circle with outstretched\narms), with round bodies covered with fine fur or downy feathers, from which small heads stuck out like the heads\nof terrapins. As the breeze played upon these feathers showers of sparks flew out.\nThe hunters carried the strange creatures back to the camp, intending to take them home to the settlements on\ntheir return. They kept them several days and noticed that every night they would grow bright and shine like great\nstars, although by day they were only balls of gray fur, except when the wind stirred and made the sparks fly out.\nThey kept very quiet, and no one thought of their trying to escape, when, on the seventh night, they suddenly rose\nfrom the ground like balls of fire and were soon above the tops of the trees. Higher and higher they went, while\nthe wondering hunters watched, until at last they were only two bright points of light in the dark sky, and then the\nhunters knew that they were stars.\n10. Origin of the Pleiades and the Pine\nLong ago, when the world was new, there were seven boys who used to spend all their time down by the town-\nhouse playing the gatay\u00fb\u2019st\u00ef game, rolling a stone wheel along the ground and sliding a curved stick after it to strike\nit. Their mothers scolded, but it did no good, so one day they collected some gatay\u00fb\u2019st\u00ef stones and boiled them in\nthe pot with the corn for dinner. When the boys came home hungry their mothers dipped out the stones and said,\n\u201cSince you like the gatay\u00fb\u2019st\u00ef better than the cornfield, take the stones now for your dinner.\u201d\nThe boys were very angry, and went down to the townhouse, saying, \u201cAs our mothers treat us this way, let us go\nwhere we shall never trouble them anymore.\u201d They began a dance\u2014some say it was the Feather dance\u2014and went\n342 Myths of the Cherokee\ntime he came, as they were sitting together in the dark of the \u00e2si, she slyly dipped her hand into the cinders and round and round the townhouse, praying to the spirits to help them.

William Lloyd (1857-1940 C.E.)\nPublished in 1911 C.E.\nPima (Native America)\nThe Pima are North American Indians who traditionally lived along the Gila and Salt rivers in Arizona, U.S.,\nwhich was the location of the Hohokam culture (200 to 1400 C.E.). Pima Indians call themselves the \u201cRiver People,\u201d\nspeak a Uto-Aztecan language, and are usually considered to be the descendants of the Hohokam whose settle-\nments were abandoned probably because of the Great Drought (1276-99) and the subsequent sparse and unpredict-\nable rainfall that lasted until 1450. The Pima were traditionally sedentary farmers utilizing the rivers for irrigation\nand supplementing their diet with some hunting and gathering. The active farming led the Pima to develop larger\ncommunities than their neighboring tribes, along with complex political organizations. From the time of their early\nencounter with European and American colonizers, Pima Indians have been seen as a friendly people. As of the\nearly 21st century, there are about 11,000 Pima descendants. J. William Lloyd, an amateur ethnographer who lived\nwith the Pima people for two months in 1903, collected and transcribed Comalk-hawk-kih (Thin Buckskin)\u2019s tradi-\ntional Pima stories via the interpretation of Edward Hubert Wood, but these stories can be traced back to the time\nof or even before the arrival of the Europeans. The stories are organized as Stories of the First Night, the Second\nNight, the Third Night, and the Fourth Night.\nWritten by Kyounghye Kwon\n344 Aw-aw-tam Indian Nights: The Myths and Legends of the Pimas\nSelections from Aw-Aw-tam Indian nights: Being the Myths and Legends of the\nPimas of Arizona\nLicense: Public Domain\nJ. William Lloyd\nThe Story of These Stories\nWHEN I was at the Pan-American Fair, at Buffalo, in July,\n1901, I one day strolled into the Bazaar and drifted naturally to\nthe section where Indian curios were displayed for sale by J. W.\nBenham. Behind the counter, as salesman, stood a young Indi-\nan, whose frank, intelligent, good-natured face at once attracted\nme. Finding me interested in Indian art, he courteously invited\nme behind the counter and spent an hour or more in explain-\ning the mysteries of baskets and blankets.\nHow small seeds are! From that interview came everything\nthat is in this book.\nSeveral times I repeated my visits to my Indian friend, and\nwhen I had left Buffalo I had earned that his name was Edward\nHubert Wood, and that he was a full-blooded Pima, educated at\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico.\nAfterward we came into a pleasant correspondence, and\nso I came to know that one of my Indian friend\u2019s dreams was\nthat he should be the means of the preservation of the ancient\ntales of his people. He had a grand-uncle, Comalk-Hawk-Kih,\nor Thin Buckskin, who was a see-nee-yaw-kum, or professional\ntraditionalist, who knew all the ancient stories, but who had no\nsuccessor, and with whose death the stories would disappear.\nHe did not feel himself equal to putting these traditions into\ngood English, and so did not quite know what to do.\nWe discussed this matter in letters; and finally it was de-\ncided that I should visit the Gila River Reservation, in Arizona,\nwhere the Pimas were, and get the myths from the old see-\nneeyawkum in person, and that Mr. Wood should return home\nImage 12.5: Pima Men and Women | A collage of\nfrom Pyramid Lake, Nevada, where he was teaching carpentry\nNative Americans, mostly of Pima ancestry, from the\nto the Pai-utes, and be my host and interpreter.\nSouthwest United States region.\nSo, on the morning of July 31st, 1903, I stepped from a\ntrain at Casa Grande, Arizona, and found myself in the desert Author: User \u201cRobfergusonjr\u201d\nland of which I had so long dreamed. I had expected Mr. Wood Source: Wikimedia Commons\nto meet me there, but he was not at the station and therefore License: Public Domain\nI took passage with the Irish mail-carrier whose stage was in\ndaily transit between Casa Grande and Sacaton, the Agency village of the Pima Reservation.\nWe had driven perhaps half the distance, and my Irish friend was beguiling the tedium by an interminable\nseries of highly spiced yarns, calculated to flabbergast the tenderfoot, when my anxious eyes discerned in the dis-\ntance the oncoming of a neat little open buggy, drawn by two pretty ponies, one of which was a pinto, and in which\nsat Mr. Wood. Just imagine: It was the last day of July, a blazing morning in the open desert, with the temperature\nsoaring somewhere between 100 and 120 degrees, yet here was my Indian friend, doubtless to do me honor, arrayed\nin a \u201cpepper-and-salt\u201d suit, complete with underclothes; vest buttoned up; collar and necktie, goggles and buckskin\ndriving gloves. And this in an open buggy, while the Irishman and I, under our tilt, were stripped to our shirts, with\nsleeves rolled above elbows, and swigging water, ever and anon, from an enormous canteen swathed in wet flannel\nto keep it cool. Truly Mr. Wood had not intended that I should take him for an uncivilized Indian, if clothes could\ngive the lie; but the face was the same kindly one of my \u201cBrother Ed,\u201d and it did not take me long to greet him and\ntransfer myself to his care.\nWe came to Sacaton (which Ed said was a Mexican name meaning \u201cmuch tall grass\u201d\u2014reminding me that Em-\nory, of the \u201cArmy of the West,\u201d who found the Pimas in 1846, reported finding fine meadows there\u2014but which the\nPimas call Tawt-sit-ka, \u201cthe Place of Fear and Flight,\u201d because of some Apache-caused panic) but we did not stop\nthere, but passed around it, to the Northwest, and on and over the Gila, Akee-mull, The River, as the Pimas affec-\n345 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ntionately call it, for to them it is as the Nile to Egypt. The famous Gila is not a very imposing stream at any time,\nand now was no stream at all, but a shallow dry channel, choked with desert dust, or paved with curling flakes of\nbaked mud which cracked like bits of broken pottery under our ponies\u2019 feet. But I afterwards many times saw it a\nturbid torrent of yellow mud, rushing and foaming from the mountain rains; perilous with quicksand and snag, the\nroaring of its voice heard over the chapparal for miles to windward.\nThe Pimas live in villages, each with its sub-chief, and we were bound for the village of Lower San-tan. But in\nthese villages the houses are now seldom aggregated, as in old days of Apache and Yuma war, but scatter out for\nmiles in farm homesteads.\nBrother Ed had lately sold his neat farmstead, near Sacaton, and when I came to his home I found he was\ntemporarily living under a vachtoe (pronounce first syllable as if German), or arbor-shed, made of mezquite forks,\nsupporting a flat roof of weeds and brush for shade. Near by he was laying the foundations of a neat little adobe\ncottage, which was finally completed during my stay.\nEd introduced me to his mother, a matronly Indian woman of perhaps fifty-five, who must have been quite\na belle in her day, and whose features were still regular and strong, and his step-father, \u201cMr. Wells,\u201d who deserves\nmore than a passing word from me, for his kindness was unremitting (bless his good-natured, smiling face!) and his\nsolicitude for my comfort constant. These were all the family, for Ed himself was a widower. Fifty yards or so to the\nnorthwest were the huts of two old and wretchedly poor Pimas (the man was blind) who had been allowed to settle\nthere temporarily by Mr. Wood, owing to some difficulty about their own location on their adjoining land. One\nor two hundred yards in the other direction were two old caw-seens, or storehouses, square structures of a sort of\nwattlework of poles, weeds and brush, plastered over with adobe and roofed with earth. In one of these I placed my\ntrunk, and on its flat roof I slept, rolled in my blankets, most of the nights of the two months of my stay. I came to\nknow it as \u201cmy Arizona Bedstead,\u201d and I shall never forget it and its quaint, crooked ladder.\nMy Indian brother was not slow in shedding his dress-parade garments, and in getting down to the comfort of\nouting shirt and overalls, neck handkerchief and sombrero. Then I had my first meal with Indians in Arizona. Mrs.\nWells, or as I prefer to call her, Sparkling-Soft-Feather (her Indian name) was a good cook of her kind, and gave\nus a meal of tortillas, frijole beans, peppers (kaw-awl-kull), coffee, and choo-oo-kook or jerked beef. Ed and I were\ngiven the dignity of chairs and a table, but the elder Indians squatted on the ground in the good old Pima way, with\ntheir dishes on a mat. There were knives and spoons, but no forks, and the usefulness of fingers was not obsolete.\nA waggish, pale-eyed pup, flabbily deprecative and good-natured, and a big-footed Mexican choo-chool, or chick-\nen, were obtrusively familiar. Neither of the older Indians could speak a word of English, but chatted and laughed\naway together in Pima. The hot, soft wind of the desert kissed our faces as we ate, and off in the back ground rose\nthe stately volcanic pile of Cheoff-skaw-mack, the nearest mountain, and all around the horizon other bare volcanic\npeaks burned into the blue. Sometimes a whirlwind of dust travelled rapidly over the plain, making one ponder\nwhat would happen should it gyrate into the vachtoe.\nThe old woman from the near-by kee slunk by as we ate, going to the well. She wore gah-kai-gey-aht-kum-soosk\n(literally string-shoes), or sandals, of rawhide, on her feet, and was quite the most wretched-looking hag I ever saw\namong the Pimas. Her withered body was hung with indescribable rags and her gray hair was a tangled mat. Yet I\ncame to know that that wretched creature had a heart and a good one. She was kind and cheerful, industrious and\nuncomplaining, and devotion itself to her old blind husband; who did nothing all day long but move out of the\ntravelling sun into the shade, rolling nearly naked in the dust.\nAfter dinner we got our guns and started out to go to the farm of old Thin Buckskin (\u201cWilliam Higgins,\u201d if you\nplease!) the seeneeyawkum I had come so far to see. Incidentally we were to shoot some kah-kai-cheu, or plumed\nquails, and taw-up-pee, or rabbits, for supper.\nWe found the old man plowing for corn in his field. The strong, friendly grasp he gave my hand was all that could\nbe desired. Tall, lean, dignified, with a harsh. yet musical voice; keen, intelligent black eyes, and an impressive manner,\nhe was plainly a gentleman and a scholar, even if he could neither read nor write, nor speak a sentence of English.\nThe next afternoon he came, and under Ed\u2019s vachtoe gave me the first installment of the coveted tales. It was\nslow work. First he would tell Ed a paragraph of tradition, and Ed would translate it to me. Then I would write\nit down, and then read it aloud to Ed again, getting his corrections. When all was straight, to his satisfaction, we\nwould go on to another paragraph, and so on, till the old man said enough. As these Indians are all Christianized\nnow, and mostly zealous in the faith, I could get no traditions on Sunday. And indeed, when part way thru, this zeal\ncame near balking me altogether. A movement started to stop the recovery of these old heathen tales; the sub-chief\nhad a word with Comalk, who became suddenly too busy to go on with his narrations, and it took increased shekels\nand the interposition of the Agent, Mr. J. B. Alexander, who was very kind to me, before I could get the wheels\nstarted again.\nSometimes the old man came at night, instead of afternoon, and I find this entry in my journal: \u201cSept. 6.\u2014We\nsat up till midnight in the old cawseen getting the traditions. It was a wild, strange scene-the old cawseen interior,\n346 Aw-aw-tam Indian Nights: The Myths and Legends of the Pimas\nthe mesquite forks that supported the roof, the poles overhead, and weeds above that, the mud-plastered walls\nwith loop-hole windows; bags, boxes, trunks, ollas, and vahs-hrom granary baskets about. Ed sitting on the ground,\nagainst the wall, nodding when I wrote and waking up to interpret; the old man bent forward, both hands out,\npalms upward, or waving in strange eloquent gestures; his lean, wrinkled features drawn and black eyes gleaming;\ntelling the strange tales in a strange tongue. On an old olla another Indian, Miguel, who came in to listen, and in\nhis hand a gorgeously decorated quee-a-kote, or flute, with which, while I wrote, he would sometimes give us a few\nwild, plaintive, thrilling bars, weird as an incantation. And finally myself, sitting on a mattress on my trunk, writing,\nfast as pencil could travel, by the dim light of a lantern hung against a great post at my right. Outside a cold, strong\nwind, for the first time since I came to Arizona, bright moonlight, and some drifting white clouds telling the last of\nthe storm.\u201d\nAgain, on Sept. 12th: \u201cTraditions, afternoon and until midnight. I shall never forget how the half-moon looked,\nrising over Vah-kee-woldt-kee, or the Notched Cliffs, toward midnight, while the coyotes laughed a chorus some-\nwhere off toward the Gila, and we sat around, outdoors, in the wind, and heard the old seeneeyawkum tell his\nweird, incoherent tales of the long ago.\u201d\nMy interpreter was eager and willing, and well-posted in the meaning of English, and was a man of unusual\nintelligence and poetry of feeling, but was not well up in grammar, and in the main I had to edit and recast his\nsentences; yet just as far as possible I have kept his words and the Indian idiom and simplicity of style. Sometimes\nhe would give me a sentence so forceful and poetic, and otherwise faultless, that I have joyfully written it down\nexactly as received. I admit that in a very few places, where the Indian simplicity and innocence of thought caused\nan almost Biblical plainness of speech on family matters, I have expurgated and smoothed a little for prudish Cau-\ncasian ears, but these changes are few, and mostly unimportant, leaving the meaning unimpaired. And never once\nwas there anything in the spirit of what was told me that revealed foulness of thought. All was grave and serious, as\nbefitted the scriptures of an ancient people.\nOccasionally I have added a word or sentence to make the meaning stand out clearer, but otherwise I have\ntaken no liberties with the original.\nAs a rule the seeneeyawkum told these tales in his own words, but the parts called speeches were learned by\nheart and repeated literally. These parts gave us much trouble. They were highly poetic, and manifestly mystic, and\ntherefore very difficult to translate with truthfulness to the involved meanings and startling and obscure metaphors.\nBesides they contained many archaic words, the meaning of which neither seeneeyawkum nor interpreter now\nknew, and which they could only translate by guess, or leave out altogether. But we did the best we could.\nThe stories were also embellished with songs, some of which I had translated. They were chants of from one to\nfour lines each, seldom more than two, many times repeated in varying cadence; weird, somber, thrillingly passion-\nate in places, and by no means unmusical, but, of course, monotonous. I obtained phonograph records of a number,\nand the translations given are as literal as possible.\nAs to the meaning of the tales I got small satisfaction. The Indians seemed to have no explanations to offer.\nThey seemed to regard them as fairy tales, but admitted they had once been believed as scriptures.\nMy own theory came to be that they had been invented, from time to time, by various and successive mah-\nkais to answer the questions concerning history, phenomena, and the origin of things, which they, as the reputed\nwisest of the tribe, were continually asked. My chief reason for supposing this is because in almost every tale the\nhero is a mahkai of some sort. The word mah-kai (now translated doctor, or medicine-man) seems to have been\napplied in old time to every being capable of exerting magical or supernatural and mysterious power, from the\nCreator down; and it is easy to see how such use of the word would apparently establish the divine relationship and\nbolster the authority of the medicine men, while the charm of the tale would focus attention upon them. The temp-\ntation was great and, I think, yielded to.\nI doubt if much real history is worked in, or that it is at all reliable.\nAll over the desert, where irrigation was at all practicable, in the Gila and Salt River valleys, and up to the edge\nof the mountains, among the beautiful giant cactus and flatbean trees, you will ride your bronco over evidences of a\nprehistoric race:\u2014old irrigating ditches, lines of stone wall; or low mounds of adobe rising above the grease, wood\nand cacti, and littered over profusely with bits of broken and painted pottery, broken cornmills and grinders, per-\nhaps showing here and there a stone ax, arrowhead, or other old stone implement. These mounds (vah-ahk-kee is\nthe Pima word for such a ruin) are the heaps caused by the fallen walls of what were once pueblos of stone and clay.\nIn some places there must have been populous cities, and at the famous site of Casa Grande one finds one of the\nbuildings still standing\u2014a really imposing citadel, with walls four or five feet thick, several stories high, and habit-\nable since the historic period.\nNow according to these traditions it was the tribes now known as Pimas, Papagoes, Yumas and Maricopas, that\ninvaded the land, from some mythic underworld, and overthrew the vahahkkees & killed all their inhabitants, and\nthis is the most interesting part of the tales from a historic point of view. Fewkes, and other ethnologists, think the\n347 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nancestors of the Pimas built the Casa Grande & other vahahkkees, but I doubt this. Is it reasonable to suppose that\nif a people as intelligent & settled as the Pimas had once evoluted far enough in architecture & fortification to erect\nsuch noble citadels and extensive cities as those of Casa Grande & Casa Blanca, that they, while still surrounded\nby the harassing Apaches, would have descended to contentment with such miserable & indefensible hovels as\ntheir present kees and cawseens? To me it is not. They are as industrious as any of the pueblo-building Indians, not\notherwise degenerate, and had they once ever builded pueblos I do not think would have abandoned the art. But it\nis easy to understand that a horde of desert campers, overthrowing a more civilized nation, might never rebuild or\ncopy after its edifices. So far, then, I am inclined to agree with the traditions and disagree with the ethnologists.\nBut these traditions are evidently very ancient. They appear to me to have originated from the aborigines of this\ncountry; people who knew no other. land. Every story is saturated with local color. From the top of Cheoffskaw-\nmack, I believe I could have seen almost every place mentioned in the traditions, except the Rio Colorado & the\nocean, and the ocean was to them, I believe, little more than a name. They never speak of it with their usual sketchy\n& graphic detail, and the fact that in the ceremony of purification it is spoken of as a source of drinking water shows\nthey really knew nothing of it. The Indian is too exact in his natural science to speak of salt water as potable. And\nthese stories certainly say that the dwellers in the vahahkkees were the children of Ee-ee-toy, created right here.\nAnd that the army that carried out Ee-ee-toy\u2019s revenge upon his rebellious people were the children of Juhwerta\nMahkai, who had been somewhere else since the flood, but who were also originally created here.\nNow, for what it is worth, I will give a theory to reconcile these differences. I assume that their flood was a\nreal event, but a local one, and the greater part of the people destroyed by it. A minority escaped by flight into the\ndesert, and neither they nor their descendants, for many generations, returned to the place where the catastrophe\noccurred. Another remnant escaped by floating on various objects & climbing mountains. The first were those of\nwhom it is fabled that Juhwerta Mahkai let them escape thru a hole in the earth. These became nomadic, desert\ndwellers. The second remained in the Gila country, became agricultural & settled in habit, irrigating their land &\nbuilding pueblos, growing rich, effeminate & inapt at war. At length the desert fugitives, also grown numerous, and\nwarlike & fierce with the wild, wolf-like existence they had led, and moved by we know not what motives of revenge\nor greed, returned & swept over the land, in a sudden invasion, like a swarm of locusts; ruthlessly destroying the\nvahahkees and all who dwelt therein; breaking even the ma-ta-tes & every utensil in their vandal fury; dividing the\nregion thus taken among themselves. According to these traditions the Apaches were already dwellers in the outly-\ning deserts & mountains, and were not affected especially by this invasion.\nIs it now unreasonable to suppose that some of the invaders kept up, to a great extent, their old habits of desert\nwandering (Papagoes for instance), and that others adopted to some extent the agricultural habits of those they had\nconquered, and yet retained, with slight change, the little brush & mud houses & arbors they had grown accus-\ntomed to in their wanderings? These last would be our present Pimas.\nIf it is considered strange that these adopted the habits, to any extent, of those they supplanted it may be urged\nthat they almost certainly, in conquering the vahahkkee people, spared and married many of the women, and\nadopted many of the children; this being in accordance with their custom in historic times. And this infusion of the\ngentler blood may have been very large. And these women would naturally go on, and would be required by their\nnew husbands to go on, with the agricultural methods to which they were accustomed & would teach them to their\nnew masters. And their children, being wholly or partly of the old stock, would have a natural tendency to the same\nwork, to some extent.\nThis theory not only explains & agrees with the main parts of the old traditions, but seems confirmed by other\nthings. Thus the Pimas, Papagoes, Quojatas, and the \u201cRabbit-Eaters\u201d of Mexico, speak about the same language, which\nwould seem to prove them originally the same people. But some have kept the old ways, some have become agricul-\ntural, and some are in manners between, and thus have become classed as different tribes. And, judging from the\nremains, the life of the old vahahkkee dwellers was in many ways like that of the modern Pima, only less primitive.\nBut the real value of these stories is as folklore, and in their literary merit. They throw a wonderful side-light on\nthe old customs, beliefs and feelings. I consider them ancient, in the main, but do not doubt that in coming down\nthru many seeneeyawkums they have been much modified by the addition of embellishment, the subtraction of\nforgetfulness. As proof I adduce the accounting for the origin of the white people, who use pens & ink, in the story\nof Van-daih. The ancient Pimas knew neither white men, nor pens, nor ink, therefore this passage is clearly an\ninterpolation by some later narrator, if the story is really ancient, as I suppose it is. In the story of Noo-ee\u2019s meeting\nthe sun, the word used by old Comalk, for the sun\u2019s weapon, was vai-no-ma-gaht (literally iron-bow) which is the\nmodern Pima\u2019s name for the white man\u2019s gun, and it was translated as gun by my interpreter. But iron and guns\nwere both unknown to ancient Pimas, therefore this term must have been first used by some seeneeyawkum after\nthe white man came, who thought a gun more appropriate than a bow for the sun\u2019s shooting.\nHow much has been lost by forgetfulness we can never know; but at least I found that the meaning of many\nancient words had disappeared, that the mystic meaning of the highly symbolic speeches seemed all gone, and I felt\n348 Aw-aw-tam Indian Nights: The Myths and Legends of the Pimas\ncertain that the last part of the Story of the Gambler\u2019s War had been lost by forgetting; for it stops short with the pre-\nliminary speeches, instead of going on with a detailed account of the battles as does the Story of Paht-ahn-kum\u2019s war.\nAnother proof that these tales were changed by different narrators is afforded by the variants of some of them\npublished by Emory, Grossman, Cook, and other writers about the Pimas.\nAs to the mystic meaning I can only guess. The mystic number four, so constantly used, probably refers to the\nfour cardinal points, but my Indians seemed not aware of this. In the stories, West is black, East is white or light,\nSouth is blue, North is yellow, and Above is green. Of course the west is black because there night swallows up the\nsun, and the east is light because it gives the sun, but why south is blue and north is yellow I do not know. But south\nis the nearest way to the ocean, and as in one story the word ocean seems used in place of south, I infer the blue\ncolor was derived from that. And the desert lying north of the ocean may suggest the desert tint, yellow, as the color\nof the north. As to the sky being green, I find this in my journal: \u201cAugust 29-Last evening, after sunset, there were\nthe most wonderful sky effects-there was a line of light clouds across the sky, in the west, about half way up to the\nzenith, and suddenly the white part of these was washed over, as tho by a paint brush, with a strong but delicate\npea-green, while under this spread a mist or haze of dainty pink, changing to a rich, delicate mauve. Lasted quar-\nter of an hour or more. Never saw anything like it in nature before.\u201d Again, on September 6, I saw nearly the same\nphenomenon. The green was very strong and vivid, and could not fail to attract an Indian\u2019s eye, and something of\nthe sort, I fancy, made him make the strange choice of green for the sky color.\nThose who like to compare myths and folktales and ancient scriptures will find a rich field here. And the in-\nteresting thing is that these tales come straight from a line of Indians who could neither read nor write nor speak\nEnglish, therefore adulteration by white man\u2019s literature seems improbable.\nAs to the literary merit of these tales, after all that is lost by a double interpretation, I consider it still very high.\nYou must come to them as a little child, for they are intensely child-like, and to expect them to be like a white man\u2019s\nnarrative is absurd. But they are sketched in such clear, bold lines, with such a sure touch and delicate expressive-\nness of salient points; there are such close-fitting, shrewd bits of human nature; such real yet startling touches of\npoetry in metaphor; such fertile and altogether Indian imagination in plot and incident, that the interest never\nfails. No two stories are alike, and if surprise is a literary charm of high value, and I think it is, then these tales are\ncertainly charming, for they constantly bring surprise.\nAnd the, poetry, in Eeeetoy\u2019s speech for example, is so rich and strong; and in such parts as the story of\nthe Nah-vah-choo the mysticism seems to challenge one like a riddle.\nWhen these old tales were told with all proper ceremony and respect, they were told on four successive nights.\nThis could not be in the giving of them to me, for many practical reasons, but I have endeavored to give them that\nform for my reader and hence the title of my book. But I did not discover how many or what ones were told on any\none night, so my division is arbitrary, and only aims at reasonable equality. The naming, too, of the different stories\nis try own, for the old man did not appear to have any set names for them. I fancy the old man was rusty and out of\npractice, and forgot some of the tales in their proper sequence, and brought them in afterward as they recurred to\nhim.. For instance, the story of Tcheu-nas-set Seeven\u2019s singing away another chief\u2019s wives evidently belongs among\nthe early stories of the vahahkkee people, and before the account of his death, when the vahahkkees were destroyed.\nBut I have given the stories in the order in which they were told to me, leaving all responsibility on the old see-\nneeyawkum\u2019s shoulders.\nI lived a little more than two months with these Indians, collecting these stories, enjoying their kindly hospitality,\nliving as they lived, eating their food, riding their ponies, sleeping on their roofs under the splendid Arizona stars.\nI shall never forget that day, before I left, when Ed and I saddled our ponies in the early morning and rode\ntwenty milts to the Casa Grande ruins. On the way we crossed the dry bed of the Gila; and passed thru the Agen-\ncy village of Sacaton and the village of Blackwater; skirting the Maricopa Slaughter mountains, where once some\nunfortunate Maricopias were waylaid and massacred by a band of Apaches, almost in sight of Sacaton. The Casa\nGrande ruins are imposing enough, but sadly belittled in effect by the well-meant roof which the government has\nerected over them to preserve them. This kills all the poetry and gives them the ludicrous aspect of a museum spec-\nimen. Had the old walls been skillfully capped with a waterproof cement and the walls coated with some weath-\nerproof and transparent wash, all necessary security could have been effected with perhaps less expense than this\nabsurd roof, and all the romance of impression preserved. Let us hope the genial and manly young custodian, Mr.\nFrank Pinckly, to whose warm-hearted hospitality and that of his parents I owe grateful thanks, will consider this\nsuggestion favorably and earn the blessing of future travellers. A storm broke on us while we were at the ruins, and\nriding home that evening we found the Gila flooded. I shall always remember how its muddy torrent looked to me,\nplunging along at my feet, where that morning I had crossed dry shod; its yellow waves shot with blood-red reflec-\ntions from the last colors of sunset.\n\u201cYou better see that Pinto\u2019s cinch is tight, or she may try to get you off in the river,\u201d warned Ed, in my ear, as he\njumped off to cinch. up \u201cGeorgie.\u201d\n349 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nIt was always exciting to me to ford the treacherous Gila, the tawny waters were so sweeping, and the ponies\nplunged so when their feet felt the quicksands, but we got across all right, and galloped home on the slippery, mud-\ndy roads.\nWhen I left these people it was with a genuine regard for their virtues. I found them in the main kind,\nhonest, simple-minded, industrious, surprisingly clean, considering their obstacles of scant water and ever-present\ndust., and the calmest tempered people I have ever known.\nI remember the second day of my stay we were going to ride to the Casa Blanca ruins. In watering the ponies\nat the well, \u201cGeorgie\u2019s\u201d loosened saddle turned and swung under his belly. Such bucking and frantic kicking as that\nhalf-broken colt indulged in for a few moments would have made a congress of cow-boys applaud, and when it was\nover the beautiful colt stood exhausted on the far side of a twenty acre field, with the saddle fragments somewhere\nbetween. Now to poor Indians the loss of a saddle is not small, and I fancy most frontiersmen, under the provo-\ncation, would have made the air blue with oaths, but Ed only sadly said: \u201cI\u2019m afraid that spoils Georgie,\u201d and the\nstepfather laughed and started patiently out on the trail of the colt \u201cto save the pieces,\u201d while the mother took one\nof her bowl-shaped Pima baskets, with beans in it, and coaxed the colt till she caught him. Then he was patted and\nsoothed and fed with sugar, the saddle patched up and replaced, and we rode eighteen miles that day and never\nanother mishap. And from first to last never a harsh or complaining word.\nI at no time encountered a beggar among the Pimas, and tho they were mostly very poor I had not a pin\u2019s worth\nstolen. I never heard an oath, or saw a brutal or violent act, or a child slapped or scolded, or a woman treated with\ndisrespect or tyranny, nor any drunkenness or cruelty to animals. Perhaps I was especially fortunate, but I can only\nspeak of what I saw. Their self-respect and serenity continually aroused my admiration.\nI must say that they appeared to me to excel any average white neighborhood in good behavior.\nIt is a strange land, that in which the Pimas dwell; a desert overgrown with strange soft-tinted weeds, \u201csalt\nweeds,\u201d pink, red, green, gray, blue, purple; the rich-green yellow-flowering greasewood; odd cacti, and all manner\nof thornbearing bushes. The soil is inexhaustibly rich, were there water enough, but the white people, settling above\nthe Indians, on the Gila, have so withdrawn the water that crop failures from lack of sufficient irrigation are the\nrule, now, instead of the exception, and the once ever-flowing Gila is more often a dry channel, as sun-baked as the\ndesert around it.\nAll around their valley, and rising here and there from the plain, are low volcanic peaks, mere dead masses\nof rock except where in places a giant cactus stands candelabra-like among the slopes of stone. About the feet of\nthese mountains, and along the channels where the torrents rush down in times of rain, are weird forests of desert\ngrowths, mesquite, cat-claw, flat-beans, screw-beans, greasewood, giant-cactus, cane-cactus, white-cactus, chol-\nla-cactus, and a host of others, almost everything bristling with innumerable thorns.\nOn this strange pasture of weed and thorn the Indian\u2019s ponies & his few cattle graze.\nHere in summer the sun beats down till the mercury registers 118 to 120 degrees in the shade, and dust storms\n& dust whirlwinds travel over the burning plain.\nStories of the First night\nThe Traditions of the Pimas\nThe old man, Comalk Hawk-Kih, (Thin Buckskin) began by saying that these were stories which he used to\nhear his father tell, they being handed down from father to son, and that when he was little he did not pay much\nattention, but when he grew older he determined to learn them, and asked his father to teach him, which his father\ndid, and now he knew them all.\nThe Story of Creation\nIn the beginning there was no earth, no water\u2014nothing. There was only a Person, Juh-wert-a-Mah-kai (The\nDoctor of the Earth).\nHe just floated, for there was no place for him to stand upon. There was no sun, no light, and he just floated\nabout in the darkness, which was Darkness itself.\nHe wandered around in the nowhere till he thought he had wandered enough. Then he rubbed on his breast\nand rubbed out moah-haht-tack, that is perspiration, or greasy earth. This he rubbed out on the palm of his hand\nand held out. It tipped over three times, but the fourth, time it staid straight in the middle of the air and there it\nremains now as the world.\nThe first bush he created was the greasewood bush.\n350 Aw-aw-tam Indian Nights: The Myths and Legends of the Pimas\nAnd he made ants, little tiny ants, to live on that bush, on its gum which comes out of its stem.\nBut these little ants did not do any good, so be created white ants, and these worked and enlarged the earth; and\nthey kept on increasing it, larger and larger, until at last it was big enough for himself to rest on.\nThen he created a Person. He made him out of his eye, out of the shadow of his eyes, to assist him, to be like\nhim, and to help him in creating trees and human beings and everything that was to be on the earth.\nThe name of this being was Noo-ee (the Buzzard).\nNooee was given all power, but he did not do the work he was created for. He did not care to help Juhwerta-\nmahkai, but let him go by himself.\nAnd so the Doctor of the Earth himself created the mountains and everything that has seed and is good to eat.\nFor if he had created human beings first they would have had nothing to live on.\nBut after making Nooee and before making the mountains and seed for food, Juhwertamahkai made the sun.\nIn order to make the sun he first made water, and this he placed in a hollow vessel, like an earthen dish (hwas-\nhah-ah) to harden into something like ice. And this hardened ball he placed in the sky. First he placed it in the\nNorth, but it did not work; then he placed it in the West, but it did not work; then he placed it in the South, but it\ndid not work; then he placed it in the East and there it worked as he wanted it to.\nAnd the moon he made in the same way and tried in the same places, with the same results.\nBut when he made the stars he took the water in his mouth and spurted it up into the sky. But the first night his\nstars did not give light enough. So he took the Doctor-stone (diamond), the tone-dum-haw-teh, and smashed it up,\nand took the pieces and threw them into the sky to mix with the water in the stars, and then there was light enough.\nAnd now Juhwertamahkai, rubbed again on his breast, and from the substance he obtained there made two\nlittle dolls, and these he laid on the earth. And they were human beings, man and woman.\nAnd now for a time the people increased till they filled the earth. For the first parents were perfect, and there\nwas no sickness and no death. But when the earth was full, then there was nothing to eat, so they killed and ate each\nother.\nBut Juhwertamahkai did not like the way his people acted, to kill and eat each other, and so he let the sky fail\nto kill them. But when the sky dropped he, himself, took a staff and broke a hole thru, thru which he and Nooee\nemerged and escaped, leaving behind them all the people dead.\nAnd Juhwertamahkai, being now on the top of this fallen sky, again made a man and a woman, in the same way\nas before. But this man and woman became grey when old, and their children became grey still younger, and their\nchildren became grey younger still, and so on till the babies were gray in their cradles.\nAnd Juhwertamahkai, who had made a new earth and sky, just as there had been before, did not like his people\nbecoming grey in their cradles, so he let the sky fall on them again, and again made a hole and escaped, with Nooee,\nas before.\nAnd Juhwertamahkai, on top of this second sky, again made a new heaven and a new earth, just as he had done\nbefore, and new people.\nBut these new people made a vice of smoking. Before human beings had never smoked till they were old, but\nnow they smoked younger, and each generation still younger, till the infants wanted to smoke in their cradles.\nAnd Juhwertamahkai did not like this, and let the sky fall again, and created everything new again in the same\nway, and this time he created the earth as it is now.\nBut at first the whole slope of the world was westward, and tho there were peaks rising from this slope there\nwere no true valleys, and all the water that fell ran away and there was no water for the people to drink. So Juhwer-\ntamahkai sent Nooee to fly around among the mountains, and over the earth, to cut valleys with his wings, so that\nthe water could be caught and distributed and there might be enough for the people to drink.\nNow the sun was male and the moon was female and they met once a month. And the moon became a mother\nand went to a mountain called Tahs-my-et-tahn Toe-ahk (sun striking mountain) and there was born her baby. But\nshe had duties to attend to, to turn around and give light, so she made a place for the child by tramping down the\nweedy bushes and there left it. And the child, having no milk, was nourished on the earth.\nAnd this child was the coyote, and as he grew he went out to walk and in his walk came to the house of Juhwer-\ntamahkai and Nooee, where they lived.\nAnd when he came there Juhwertamahkai knew him and called him Toe-hahvs, because he was laid on the\nweedy bushes of that name.\nBut now out of the North came another powerful personage, who has two names, See-ur-huh and Ee-ee-toy.\nNow Seeurhuh means older brother, and when this personage came to Juhwertamahkai, Nooee and Toehahvs\nhe called them his younger brothers. But they claimed to have been here first, and to be older than he, and there\nwas a dispute between them. But finally, because he insisted so strongly, and just to please him, they let him be\ncalled older brother.\n351 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nJuhwerta Mahkai\u2019s Song Of Creation\nJuhwerta mahkai made the world\u2014\nCome and see it and make it useful!\nHe made it round\u2014\nCome and see it and make it useful!\nNotes on \u201cThe Story of Creation\u201d\nThe idea of creating the earth from the perspiration and waste cuticle of the Creator is, I believe, original.\nThe local touch in making the greasewood bush the first vegetation is very strong.\nIn the tipping over of the earth three times, and its standing right the fourth time, we are introduced to the first\nof the mystic fours in which the whole scheme of the stories is cast. Almost everything is done four times before\nfinished.\nThe peculiar Indian idea of type-animals, the immortal and supernatural representatives of their respective an-\nimal tribes, appears in Nooee and Toehahvs, and here again the local color is rich and strong in making the buzzard\nand the coyote, the most common and striking animals of the desert, the particular aides on the staff of the Creator.\nMight not the creation of Nooee out of the shadow of the eyes of the Doctor of the Earth be a poetical allusion\nto the flying shadow of the buzzard on the sun-bright desert?\nIn the creation of sun and moon we find the mystic four referred to the four corners of the universe, North,\nSouth, East and West, and this, I am persuaded, is really the origin of its sacred significance, for most religions find\nroot and source in astronomy.\nIn the dropping of the sky appears the old idea of its solid character.\nIn the \u201cslope of the world to the Westward\u201d there is something curiously significant when we remember that\nboth the Gila and Salt Rivers flow generally westward.\nNooee cuts the valleys with his wings. It would almost appear that Nooee was Juhwertamahkai\u2019s agent in the air\nand sky, Toehahvs on earth.\nThe night-prowling coyote is appropriately and poetically mothered by the moon.\nAnd here appears Eeeetoy, the most active and mysterious personality in Piman mythology. Out of the\nNorth, apparently self-existent, but little inferior in power to Juhwertamahkai, and claiming greater age, he appears,\nby pure \u201cbluff\u201d and persistent push and wheedling, to have induced the really more powerful, but good-natured\nand rather lazy Juhwertamahkai to give over most of the real work and government of the world to him. In convers-\ning with Harry Azul, the head chief\u2019s son, at Sacaton, I found he regarded Eeeetoy and Juhwertamahki as but two\nnames for the same. And indeed it is hard to fix Eeeetoy\u2019s place or power.\nThe Story of the Flood\nNow Seeurhuh was very powerful, like Juhwerta Mahkai, and as he took up his residence with them, as one of\nthem, he did many wonderful things which pleased Juhwerta Mahkai, who liked to watch him.\nAnd after doing many marvelous things he, too, made a man.\nAnd to this man whom he had made, Seeurhuh (whose other name was Ee-ee-toy) gave a bow & arrows, and\nguarded his arm against the bow string by a piece of wild-cat skin, and pierced his ears & made ear-rings for him,\nlike turquoises to look at, from the leaves of the weed called quah-wool. And this man was the most beautiful man\nyet made.\nAnd Ee-ee-toy told this young man, who was just of marriageable age, to look around and see if he could find\nany young girl in the villages that would suit him and, if he found her, to see her relatives and see if they were will-\ning he should marry her.\nAnd the beautiful young man did this, and found a girl that pleased him, and told her family of his wish, and\nthey accepted him, and he married her.\nAnd the names of both these are now forgotten and unknown.\nAnd when they were married Ee-ee-toy, foreseeing what would happen, went & gathered the gum of the grease-\nwood tree.\nHere the narrative states, with far too much plainness of circumstantial detail for popular reading, that this\nyoung man married a great many wives in rapid succession, abandoning the last one with each new one wedded,\nand had children with abnormal, even uncanny swiftness, for which the wives were blamed and for which suspicion\nthey were thus heartlessly divorced. Because of this, Juhwerta Mahkai and Ee-ee-toy foresaw that nature would be\nconvulsed and a great flood would come to cover the world. And then the narrative goes on to say:\n352 Aw-aw-tam Indian Nights: The Myths and Legends of the Pimas\nNow there was a doctor who lived down toward the sunset whose name was Vahk-lohv Mahkai, or South\nDoctor, who had a beautiful daughter. And when his daughter heard of this young man and what had happened to\nhis wives she was afraid and cried every day. And when her fattier saw her crying he asked her what was the matter?\nwas she sick? And when she had told him what she was afraid of, for every one knew and was talking of this thing,\nhe said yes, he knew it was true, but she ought not to be afraid, for there was happiness for a woman in marriage\nand the mothering of children.\nAnd it took many years for the young man to marry all these wives, and have all these children, and all this\ntime Ee-ee-toy was busy making a great vessel of the gum he had gathered from the grease bushes, a sort of olla\nwhich could be closed up, which would keep back water. And while he was making this he talked over the reasons\nfor it with Juhwerta Mahkai, Nooee, and Toehahvs, that it was because there was a great flood coming.\nAnd several birds heard them talking thus\u2014the woodpecker, Hick-o-vick; the humming-bird, Vee-pis-mahl; a\nlittle bird named Gee-ee-sop, and another called Quota-veech.\nEeeetoy said he would escape the flood by getting into the vessel he was making from the gum of the grease\nbushes or ser-quoy.\nAnd Juhwerta Mahkai said he would get into his staff, or walking stick, and float about.\nAnd Toehahvs said he would get into a cane-tube.\nAnd the little birds said the water would not reach the sky, so they would fly up there and hang on by their bills\ntill it was over.\nAnd Nooee, the buzzard, the powerful, said he did not care if the flood did reach the sky, for he could find a\nway to break thru.\nNow Ee-ee-toy was envious, and anxious to get ahead of Juhwerta Mahkai and get more fame for his wonderful\ndeeds, but Juhwerta Mahkai, though really the strongest, was generous and from kindness and for relationship sake\nlet Ee-ee-toy have the best of it.\nAnd the young girl, the doctor\u2019s daughter, kept on crying, fearing the young man, feeling him ever coming\nnearer, and her father kept on reassuring her, telling her it would be all right, but at last, out of pity for her fears &\ntears, he told her to go and get him the little tuft of the finest thorns on the top of the white cactus, the haht-sahn-\nkahm, and bring to him.\nAnd her father took the cactus-tuft which she had brought him, and took hair from her head and wound about\none end of it, and told her if she would wear this it would protect her. And she consented and wore the cactus-tuft.\nAnd he told her to treat the young man right, when he came, & make him broth of corn. And if the young man\nshould eat all the broth, then their plan would fail, but if he left any broth she was to eat that up and then their plan\nwould succeed.\nAnd he told her to be sure and have a bow and arrows above the door of the kee, so that he could take care of\nthe young man.\nAnd after her father had told her this, on that very evening the young man came, and the girl received him\nkindly, and took his bows & arrows, and put them over the door of the kee, as her father had told her, and made the\nyoung man broth of corn and gave it to him to eat.\nAnd he ate only part of it and what was left she ate herself.\nAnd before this her father had told her: \u201cif the young man is wounded by the thorns you wear, in that moment\nhe will become a woman and a mother and you will become a young man.\u201d\nAnd in the night all this came to be, even so, and by day-break the child was crying.\nAnd the old woman ran in and said: \u201cMossay!\u201d which means an old woman\u2019s grandchild from a daughter.\nAnd the daughter, that had been, said: \u201cIt is not your moss, it is your cah-um-maht,\u201d that is an old woman\u2019s\ngrandchild from a son.\nAnd then the old man ran in and said: \u201cBah-ahm-ah-dah!\u201d that is an old man\u2019s grandchild from a daughter, but\nhis daughter said: \u201cIt is not your bah-ahm-maht, but it is your voss-ahm-maht,\u201d which is an old man\u2019s grandchild\nfrom a son.\nAnd early in the morning this young man (that had been, but who was now a woman & a mother) made\na wawl-kote, a carrier, or cradle, for the baby and took the trail back home.\nAnd Juhwerta Mahkai told his neighbors of what was coming, this young man who had changed into a woman\nand a mother and was bringing a baby born from himself, and that when he arrived wonderful things would hap-\npen & springs would gush forth from under every tree and on every mountain.\nAnd the young man-woman came back and by the time of his return Ee-ee-toy had finished his vessel and had\nplaced therein seeds & everything that is in the world.\nAnd the young man-woman, when he came to his old home, placed his baby in the bushes and left it, going in\nwithout it, but Ee-ee-toy turned around and looked at him and knew him, for he did not wear a woman\u2019s dress, and\nsaid to him: \u201cWhere is my Bahahmmaht? Bring it to me. I want to see it. It is a joy for an old man to see his grandchild.\n353 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nI have sat here in my house and watched your going, and all that has happened you, and foreseen some one\nwould send you back in shame, although I did not like to think there was anyone more powerful than I. But never\nmind, he who has beaten us will see what will happen.\u201d\nAnd when the young man-woman went to get his baby, Ee-ee-toy got into his vessel, and built a fire on the\nhearth he had placed therein, and sealed it up.\nAnd the young man-woman found his baby crying, and the tears from it were all over the ground, around. And\nwhen he stooped over to pick up his child he turned into a sand-snipe, and the baby turned into a little teeter-snipe.\nAnd then that came true which Juhwerta Mahkai had said, that water would gush out from under every tree & on\nevery mountain; and the people when they saw it, and knew that a flood was coming, ram to Juhwerta Mahkai;\nand he took his staff and made a hole in the earth and let all those thru who had come to him, but the rest were\ndrowned.\nThen Juhwerta Mahkai got into his walking stick & floated, and Toehahvs got into his tube of cane and floated,\nbut Ee-ee-toy\u2019s vessel was heavy & big and remained until the flood was much deeper before it could float.\nAnd the people who were left out fled to the mountains; to the mountains called Gah-kote-kih (Superstition\nMts.) for they were living in the plains between Gahkotekih and Cheoffskawmack (Tall Gray Mountain.)\nAnd there was a powerful man among these people, a doctor (mahkai), who set a mark on the mountain side\nand said the water would not rise above it.\nAnd the people believed him and camped just beyond the mark; but the water came on and they had to go\nhigher. And this happened four times.\nAnd the mahkai did this to help his people, and also used power to raise the mountain, but at last he saw all was\nto be a failure. And he called the people and asked them all to come close together, and he took his doctor-stone\n(mahkai-haw-teh) which is called Tonedumhawteh or Stone-of-Light, and held it in the palm of his hand and struck\nit hard with his other hand, and it thundered so loud that all the people were frightened and they were all turned\ninto stone.\nAnd the little birds, the woodpecker, Hickovick; the humming-bird, Veepismahl; the little bird named Ge-ee-\nsop, and the other called Quotaveech, all flew up to the sky and hung on by their bills, but Nooee still floated in the\nair and intended to keep on the wing unless the floods reached the heavens.\nBut Juhwerta Mahkai, Ee-ee-toy and Toehahvs floated around on the water and drifted to the west and did not\nknow where they were.\nAnd the flood rose higher until it reached the woodpecker\u2019s tail, and you can see the marks to this day.\nAnd Quotaveech was cold and cried so loud that the other birds pulled off their feathers and built him a nest up\nthere so he could keep warm. And when Quotaveech was warm he quit crying.\nAnd then the little birds sang, for they had power to make the water go down by singing, and as they sang the\nwaters gradually receded.\nBut the others still floated around.\nWhen the land began to appear Juhwerta Mahkai and Toehahvs got out, but Ee-ee-toy had to wait for his house\nto warm up, for he had built a fire to warm his vessel enough for him to unseal it.\nWhen it was warm enough he unsealed it, but when he looked out he saw the water still running & he got back\nand sealed himself in again.\nAnd after waiting a while he unsealed his vessel again, and seeing dry land enough he got out.\nAnd Juhwerta Mahkai went south and Toehahvs went west, and Ee-ee-toy went northward. And as they did not\nknow where they were they missed each other, and passed each other unseen, but afterward saw each other\u2019s tracks,\nand then turned back and shouted, but wandered from the track, and again passed unseen. And this happened four\ntimes.\nAnd the fourth time Juhwerta Mahkai and Ee-ee-toy met, but Toehahvs had passed already.\nAnd when they met, Ee-ee-toy said to Juhwerta Mahkai \u201cMy younger brother!\u201d but Juhwerta Mahkai greeted\nhim as younger brother & claimed to have come out first. Then Ee-ee-toy said again: \u201cI came out first and you can\nsee the water marks on my body.\u201d But Juhwerta Mahkai replied: \u201cI came out first and also have the water marks on\nmy person to prove it.\u201d\nBut Ee-ee-toy so insisted that he was the eldest that Juhwerta Mahkai, just to please him, gave him his way and\nlet him be considered the elder.\nAnd then they turned westward and yelled to find Toehahvs, for they remembered to have seen his tracks, and\nthey kept on yelling till he heard them. And when Toehahvs saw them he called them his younger brothers, and\nthey called him younger brother. And this dispute continued till Ee-ee-toy again got the best of it, and although\nreally the younger brother was admitted by the others to be Seeurhuh, or the elder.\nAnd the birds came down from the sky and again there was a dispute about the relationship, but Ee-ee-toy\nagain got the best of them all.\n354 Aw-aw-tam Indian Nights: The Myths and Legends of the Pimas\nBut Quotaveech staid up in the sky because he had a comfortable nest there, and they called him Vee-ick-koss-\nkum Mahkai, the Feather-Nest Doctor.\nAnd they wanted to find the middle, the navel of the earth, and they sent Veeppismahl, the humming bird, to\nthe west, and Hickovick, the woodpecker, to the east, and all the others stood and waited for them at the starting\nplace. And Veepismahl & Hickovick were to go as far as they could, to the edge of the world, and then return to find\nthe middle of the earth by their meeting. But Hickovick flew a little faster and got there first, and so when they met\nthey found it was not the middle, and they parted & started again, but this time they changed places and Hickovick\nwent westward and Veepismahl went east.\nAnd this time Veepismahl was the faster, and Hickovick was late, and the judges thought their place of meeting\nwas a little east of the center so they all went a little way west. Ee-ee-toy, Juhwerta Mahkai and Toehahvs stood there\nand sent the birds out once more, and this time Hickovick went eastward again, and Veepismahl went west. And\nHickovick flew faster and arrived there first. And they said : \u201cThis is not the middle. It is a little way west yet.\u201d\nAnd so they moved a little way, and again the birds were sent forth, and this time Hickovick went west and\nVeepismahl went east. And when the birds returned they met where the others stood and all cried \u201cThis is the Hick,\nthe Navel of the World!\u201d\nAnd they stood there because there was no dry place yet for them to sit down upon; and Ee-eetoy rubbed upon\nhis breast and took from his bosom the smallest ants, the O-auf-taw-ton, and threw them upon the ground, and\nthey worked there and threw up little hills; and this earth was dry. And so they sat down.\nBut the: water was still running in the valleys, and Ee-ee-toy took a hair from his head & made it into a snake\u2014\nVuck-vahmuht. And with this snake he pushed the waters south, but the head of the snake was left lying to the west\nand his tail to the east.\nBut there was more water, and Ee-ee-toy took another hair from his head and made another snake, and with\nthis snake pushed the rest of the water north. And the head of this snake was left to the east and his tail to the west.\nSo the head of each snake was left lying with the tail of the other.\nAnd the snake that has his tail to the east, in the morning will shake up his tail to start the morning wind to\nwake the people and tell them to think of their dreams.\nAnd the snake that has his tail to the west, in the evening will shake up his tail to start the cool wind to tell the\npeople it is time to go in and make the fires & be comfortable.\nAnd they said: \u201cWe will make dolls, but we will not let each other see them until they are finished.\u201d\nAnd Ee-ee-toy sat facing the west, and Toehahvs facing the south, and Juhwerta Mahkai facing the east.\nAnd the earth was still damp and they took clay and began to make dolls. And Ee-ee-toy made the best. But\nJuhwerta Mahkai did not make good ones, because he remembered some of his people had escaped the flood thru a\nhole in the earth, and he intended to visit them and he did not want to make anything better than they were to take\nthe place of them. And Toehahvs made the poorest of all.\nThen Ee-ee-toy asked them if they were ready, and they all said yes, and then they turned about and showed\neach other the dolls they had made.\nAnd Ee-ee-toy asked Juhwerta Mahkai why he had made such queer dolls. \u201cThis one,\u201d he said, \u201cis not right, for\nyou have made him without any sitting-down parts, and how can he get rid of the waste of what he eats?\u201d\nBut Juhwerta Mahkai said: \u201cHe will not need to eat, he can just smell the smell of what is cooked.\u201d\nThen Ee-ee-toy asked again: \u201cWhy did you make this doll with only one leg\u2014how can he run?\u201d But Juh-\nwerta Mahkai replied: \u201cHe will not need to run; he can just hop around.\u201d\nThen Ee-ee-toy asked Toehahvs why he had made a doll with webs between his fingers and toes\u2014\u201dHow can he\npoint directions?\u201d But Toehahvs said he had made these dolls so for good purpose, for if anybody gave them small\nseeds they would not slip between their fingers, and they could use the webs for dippers to drink with.\nAnd Ee-ee-toy held up his dolls and said: \u201cThese are the best of all, and I want you to make more like them.\u201d\nAnd he took Toehahv\u2019s dolls and threw them into the water and they became ducks & beavers. And he took Juhwer-\nta Mahkai\u2019s dolls and threw them away and they all broke to pieces and were nothing.\nAnd Juhwerta Mahkai was angry at this and began to sink into the ground; and took his stick and hooked it\ninto the sky and pulled the sky down while he was sinking. But Ee-ee-toy spread his hand over his dolls, and held\nup the sky, and seeing that Juhwerta Mahkai was sinking into the earth he sprang and tried to hold him & cried,\n\u201cMan, what are you doing? Are you going to leave me and my people here alone?\u201d\nBut Juhwerta Mahkai slipped through his hands, leaving in them only the waste & excretion of his skin. And\nthat is how there is sickness & death among us.\nAnd Ee-ee-toy, when Juhwerta Mahkai escaped him, went around swinging his hands & saying: \u201cI never\nthought all this impurity would come upon my people!\u201d and the swinging of his hands scattered disease over all\nthe earth. And he washed himself in a pool or pond and the impurities remaining in the water are the source of the\nmalarias and all the diseases of dampness.\n355 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nAnd Ee-ee-toy and Toehahvs built a house for their dolls a little way off, and Ee-ee-toy sent Toehahvs to listen\nif they were yet talking. And the Aw-up, (the Apaches) were the first ones that talked. And Ee-ee-toy said: \u201cI never\nmeant to have those Apaches talk first, I would rather have had the Aw-aw-tam, the Good People, speak first. \u201c\nBut he said: \u201cIt is all right. I will give them strength, that they stand the cold & all hardships.\u201d And all the differ-\nent people that they had made talked, one after the other, but the Awawtam talked last.\nAnd they all took to playing together, and in their play they kicked each other as the Maricopas do in sport to\nthis day; but the Apaches got angry and said: \u201cWe will leave you and go into the mountains and eat what we can get,\nbut we will dream good dreams and be just as happy as you with all your good things to eat.\u201d\nAnd some of the people took up their residence on the Gila, and some went west to the Rio Colorado. And\nthose who builded vahahkkees, or houses out of adobe and stones, lived in the valley of the Gila, between the\nmountains which are there now.\nJuhwerta Mahkai\u2019s Song Before The Flood\nMy poor people,\nWho will see,\nWho will see\nThis water which will moisten the earth!\nThe Song Of Superstition Mountains\nWe are destroyed!\nBy my stone we are destroyed!\nWe are rightly turned into stone.\nEe-Ee-Toy\u2019s Song When He Made The World Serpents\nI know what to do;\nI am going to move the water both ways.\nNotes on \u201cThe Story of the Flood\u201d\nIn the Story of the Flood we are introduced to Indian marriage. Among the Pimas it was a very simple affair.\nThere was no ceremony whatever. The lover usually selected a relative, who went with him to the parents of the girl\nand asked the father to permit the lover to marry her. Presents were seldom given unless a very old man desired\na young bride. The girl was consulted and her consent was essential, her refusal final. If, however, all parties were\nsatisfied, she went at once with her husband as his wife. If either party became dissatisfied, separation at once\nconstituted divorce and either could leave the other. A widow or divorced woman, if courted by another suitor, was\napproached directly, with no intervention of relatives. Of course, on these terms there were many separations, yet\nall accounts agree that there was a good deal of fidelity and many life-long unions and cases of strong affection.\nPolygamy was not unknown.\nGrossman says that the wife was the slave of the husband, but it is difficult to see how a woman, free at any\nmoment to divorce herself without disgrace or coercion, could be properly regarded as a slave. Certainly the men\nappear always to have done a large part of the hard work, and as far as I could see the women were remarkably\nequal and independent and respectfully treated, as such a system would naturally bring about. A man would be\na fool to ill-treat a woman, whose love or services were valuable to him, if at any moment of discontent she could\nleave him, perhaps for a rival. The chances are that he would constantly endeavor to hold her allegiance by special\nkindness and favors.\nBut today legal marriage is replacing the old system.\nSo far as I saw the Pimas were very harmonious and kindly in family life.\nThe birds, gee-ee-sop and quotaveech, were pointed out to me by the Pimas, and as near as I could tell\nquotaveech was Bendire\u2019s thrasher, or perhaps the curve-bill thrasher. It has a very sweet but timid song. I did not\nsucceed in identifying gee-ee-sop, but find these entries about him in my journal: \u201cAug. 5\u2014I saw a little bird which\nI suppose to be a gee-ee-sop in a mezquite today, smaller and more slender than a vireo, but like one in action, but\nthe tail longer and carried more like a brown thrasher, nearly white below, dark, leaden gray above, top of head and\ntail black.\u201d Again on Sept. 1: \u201cWhat a dear little bird the gee-ee-sop is! Two of them in the oas-juh-wert-pot tree\nwere looking at me a few minutes back. Dark slate-blue above and nearly white below, with beady black eyes and\nblack, lively tails, tipped with white, they are very pretty, tame and confiding.\u201d\n356 Aw-aw-tam Indian Nights: The Myths and Legends of the Pimas\nThe faith of the Aw-aw-tam in witchcraft appears first in this story and afterwards is conspicuous in nearly all.\nAlmost all diseases they supposed were caused by bewitching, and it was the chief business of the medicine-men\nto find out who or what had caused the bewitching. Sometimes people were accused and murders followed. This\nwas the darkest spot in Piman life. Generally, however, some animal or inanimate object was identified. Grossman\u2019s\naccount in the Smithsonian Report for 1871 is interesting. In the stories, however, witchcraft appears usually as the\nability of the mahkai to work transformations in himself or others, in true old fairy-tale style.\nSuperstition Mountain derives its name from this story, It is a very beautiful and impressive mountain, with\nterraces of cliffs, marking perhaps the successive pausing places of the fugitives, and the huddled rocks on the top\nrepresent their petrified forms. Some of the older Indians still fear to go up into this mountain, lest a like fate befall\nthem.\nWhat beautiful poetic touches are the wetting of the woodpecker\u2019s tail, and the singing of the little birds to\nsubdue the angry waters.\nThe resemblances to Genesis will of course be noted by all in these two first stories. Yet after all they are few and\nslight in any matter of detail.\nIn Ee-ee-toy\u2019s serpents, that pushed back the waters, there is a strong reminder of the Norse Midgard Ser-\npent.\nThe making of the dolls in this story is one of the prettiest and most amusing spots in the traditions.\nThe waste and perspiration of Juhwerta Mahkai\u2019s skin again comes into play, but this time as a malign force\ninstead of a beneficent one. It would also appear from this that the more intelligent Pimas had a glimmering of the\nfact that there were other causes than witchcraft for disease.\nI have generally used the word Aw-aw-tam (Good People, or People of Peace) as synonymous with Pima, but it\nis sometimes used to embrace all Indians of the Piman stock and may be so understood in this story.\nAnd perhaps this is as good a place as any to say a few descriptive words about these Pimas of Arizona, and\ntheir allies, who have from prehistoric times inhabited what the old Spanish historian, Clavigero, called \u201cPimeria,\u201d\nthat is, the valleys of the Gila and Salt Rivers.\nTheir faces seemed to me to be of almost Caucasian regularity and rather of an English or Dutch cast, that is\nrather heavily moulded. The forehead is vertical and inclined to be square; and the chin, broad, heavy and full,\ncomes out well to its line. The nose is straight, or a little irregular, or rounded, at the end, but not often very aq-\nuiline, never flat or wide-nostriled. The mouth is large but well shaped, with short, white, remarkably even teeth,\nseldom showing any canine projection. The whole face is a little heavy and square, but the cheek bones are not\nespecially prominent. The eyes are level, frank and direct in glance, with long lashes and strong black brows. In the\nbabies a slight uptilt to the eye is sometimes\u2019 seen, like a Japanese, which indeed the babies suggest. The head of\nalmost all adults is well-balanced and finely poised on a good neck.\nAnother type possesses more of what we call the Indian feature. The forehead retreats somewhat, so does the\nchin, while the upper lip is larger, longer, more convex and the nose, above is more aquiline, with wider nostrils.\nConsequently this face in profile is more convex thru out. The cheek-bones are much more prominent, too, and the\nhead not generally so well-balanced and proportional.\nWhile I have seen no striking beauty I believe the average good looks is greater than among white men, taken\nas they come.\nThe women as a rule, however, do not carry themselves gracefully, are apt to be too broad, fat and dumpy in\nfigure, with too large waists, and often loose, ungracefully-moving hips. This deformity of the hips, for it almost\namounts to that, I observe among Italian peasant women, too, and some negresses, and, I take it, is caused by car-\nrying too heavy loads on the head at too early an age. There seems to be a settling down of the body into the pelvis,\nwith a loose alternate motion of the hips. There are exceptions, of course, and I have seen those of stately figure and\nfine carriage Sometimes the loose-hip motion appears in a man.\nA slight tattooing appears on almost all Pima faces not of the last generation. In the women this consists of two\nblue lines running down from each corner of the mouth, under the chin, crossing, at the start, the lower lip, and a\nsingle blue line running back from the outer angle of each eye to the hair.\nIn the men it is usually a single zigzag blue line across the forehead.\nThe pigment used is charcoal.\nThe men are generally erect and of good figure, with good chests and rather heavy shoulders, the legs often a\nlittle bowed. Strange to say I never saw one who walked \u201cPigeon-toed.\u201d All turned the toes out like white men. The\nhands are often small and almost always well-shaped; and the feet of good shape, too, not over large, with a well-\narched instep.\nEmory and his comrades found the Pimas wearing a kind of breech-cloth and a cotton serape only for gar-\nments; the women wearing only a serape tied around the waist and falling to the knee, being otherwise nude. Today\nthe average male Pima dresses like a white workman, in hat, shirt, trousers and perhaps shoes, and his wife or\n357 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ndaughter wears a single print gown, rather loose at the waist and ruffled at the bottom, which reaches only to the\nankles. Both sexes are commonly barefooted, but the old sandals, once universal, are still often seen. These gah-kai-\ngey-aht-kum-soosk, or string-shoes, as the word means, were made in several different ways, and often projected\nsomewhat around the foot as a protection against the frequent and formidable thorns of the country.\nSometimes a wilder or older Indian will be seen, even now, with only a breech-cloth on, and some apology for a\ngarment on his shoulders.\nThe skin is often of a very beautiful rich red-bronze tint, or perhaps more like old mahogany.\nExcept the tattooing both sexes are remarkable for their almost entire absence of any marked adornment or\nornament of person. Even a finger-ring, or a ribbon on the hair, is not common, and the profuse bead-work and\nembroidery of the other tribes is never seen.\nThe exceedingly thick and intensely black hair was formerly worn very long, even to the waist, being banged\noff just over the eyes of the women and over the eyes and ears of the men and allowed to hang perfectly loose. But\nthe women seldom wore: as long hair as the men. This long hair is still sometimes seen and is exceedingly pictur-\nesque, especially on horseback, and it is a great pity so sightly a fashion should ever die out. I have seen Maricopas\nroll theirs in ringlets. Sometimes the men braided the hair into a cue, or looped up the ends with a fillet. But the\nGovernment discourages long and loose hair, and now most men cut it short, and women part theirs and braid it.\nLike all Indians, the men have scant beards, and the few whiskers that grow are shaved clean or resolutely pinched\noff with an old knife or pulled out by tweezers.\nTheir hair appears to turn gray as early as ours, tho I saw no baldness except on one individual. In old times\n(and even now to some extent) the hair was dressed with a mixture of mud and mezquite gum, at times, which was\nleft on long enough for the desired effect and then thoroly washed off. This cleansed it and made it glossy and the\ngum dyed the gray hair quite a lasting, jet black, tho several applications might be needed.\nWomen still carry their ollas and other burdens on their heads and are exceedingly strong and expert in the art,\nbalancing great and awkward weights with admirable dexterity.\nThe convenient and even beautiful gyih-haw (a word very difficult to pronounce correctly), or burden basket,\nof the old time Pima woman, seems to have entirely disappeared. It was not only picturesque, but an exceedingly\nuseful utensil.\nThe wawl-kote, or carrying-cradle for the baby, is obsolete, too, now. Strange to say, tho in shape like most pap-\npoose-cradles, it was carried poised on the head, instead of slung on the back in the usual way.\nThe Pimas are fond of conversation and often come together in the evening and have long talks. Their voices are\nlow, rapid, soft and very pleasant and they laugh, smile and joke a great deal. They are remarkable for calmness and\nevenness of temper and the expression of the face is nearly always intelligent, frank, and good-natured.\nThey are noticeably devoid of hurry, worry, irritability or nervousness.\nUnlike most Indians these have not been removed from the soil of their fathers and, indeed, such an act would\nhave been cruelly unjust, for, true to their name, the Pimas have maintained an unbroken peace with the whites.\nLieutenant Colonel W. H. Emory, of \u201cThe Army of the West,\u201d who visited them in 1846, was perhaps the first\nAmerican to observe and describe these people. He says: \u201cBoth nations (Pimas and Maricopas) cherished an aver-\nsion to war and a profound attachment to all the peaceful pursuits of life. This predilection arose from no incapacity\nfor war, for they were at all times able and willing to keep the Apaches, whose hands are raised against all other\npeople, at a respectful distance, and prevent depredations by those mountain robbers who held Chihuahua, Sonora\nand a part of Durango in a condition approaching almost to tributary provinces.\u201d\nAs observed by Emory and the other officers of the \u201cArmy of the West\u201d they were an agricultural people rais-\ning at that time \u201ccotton, wheat, maize, beans, pumpkins and water melons.\u201d I found them raising all these in 1903,\nexcept cotton, and I think he might have added to his list, peppers, gourds, tobacco and the pea called cah-lay-vahs.\nEmory says: \u201cWe were at once impressed with the beauty, order, and disposition of the arrangements made for\nirrigating the land . . . the fields are subdivided by ridges of earth into rectangles of about 200x100 feet, for the con-\nvenience of irrigating. The fences are of sticks, matted with willow and mezquite.\u201d I found this still comparatively\ncorrect. The fields are still irrigated by acequias or ditches from the Gila, and still fenced by forks of trees set closely\nin the ground and reinforced with branches of thorn or barbed wire. Some of these fences with their antler-like\neffect of tops are very picturesque.\nFrom the description given by Emory, and Captain A. R. Johnson of the same army, of their kees or winter\nlodges, they were essentially the same as I found some of them still inhabiting. There is the following entry in my\njournal: \u201cI have been examining the old kee next door, since the old couple left it. It is quite neatly and systematical-\nly made. Four large forks are set in the ground, and these support a square of large poles, covered with other poles,\narrow-weeds, chaff and earth, for the roof. The walls are a neat arrangement of small saplings, about 10 inches\napart curving up from the ground on a bending slant to the roof, so that the whole structure comes to resemble a\n358 Aw-aw-tam Indian Nights: The Myths and Legends of the Pimas\nturtle-shell or rather an inverted bowl. These side sticks arc connected by three lines of smaller sticks tied across\nthem with withes, all the way around the kee. Against these arrow-weeds are stood, closely and neatly, tops down\n(perhaps thatched on) and kept in place by three more lines of small sticks, bound on and corresponding to those\nwithin. Then the whole structure is plastered over with adobe mud till rain-proof. No window, and only one small\ndoor, about 2\u00bd feet square, closed by a slat-work.\u201d\nThis kee of the Pima was not to his credit. The most friendly must admit it dirty, uncomfortable and unpictur-\nesque. It was too low to stand erect in, the little fire was made in the center, the smoke escaping at last from the low\ndoorway after trying everywhere else and festooning the ceiling with soot.\nThe establishment of the Pima was most simple. He sat, ate and slept on the earth, consequently a few mats and\nblankets, baskets, bowls and pots included his furniture. A large earthen olla, called by the Pimas hah-ah, stood in a\ntriple fork under the shade of the vachtoe and being porous enough to permit a slight evaporation kept the drinking\nwater cool.\nThe arbor-shed or vachtoe pertains to almost every Piman home and consists of a flat roof of poles and ar-\nrow-weeds supported by stout forks. Sometimes earth is added to the roof to keep off rain. Sometimes the sides\nare enclosed with a rude wattle work of weeds and bushes, making a grateful shade, admitting air freely; screening\nthose within from view, while permitting vision from within outward in any direction. Sometimes this screen of\nweeds and bushes, in a circular form, was made without any roof and was then called an o-num. Sometimes after\nthe vachtoe had been inclosed with wattle work the whole structure was plastered over with adobe mud and then\nbecame a caws-seen, or storehouse. All these structures were used at times as habitations, but now the Pima is com-\ning more and more to the white man\u2019s adobe cottage as a house and home. But the vachtoe, attached or detached, is\nstill a feature of almost every homestead.\nUnder the vachtoe usually stood the matate, or mill (called by the Pimas mah-choot) which was a large flat or\nconcave stone, below, across which was rubbed an oblong, narrow stone (vee-it-kote), above, to grind the corn or\nwheat. Other important utensils were a vatcheeho, or wooden trough, for mixing, and a chee-o-pah, or mortar, of\nwood or stone, for crushing things with a pestle. The nah-dah-kote, or fire-place, was an affair of stones and adobe\nmud to support the earthern pots for cooking or to support the earthern plates on which the thin cakes of corn or\nwheat meal were baked. These were what the Mexicans call tortillas. Perhaps the staple food of the Pima even more\nthan corn (hohn) or wheat (payl-koon) is frijole beans\u2014these of two kinds, the white (bah-fih) the brown (mohn). A\nsort of meal made of parched corn or wheat; ground on the mahchoot and eaten, or perhaps one might say drank,\nwith water and brown sugar (panoche) was the famous pinole, the food carried on war trips when nutrition, light-\nness of weight and smallness of bulk were all desired. It has a remarkable power to cool and quench thirst. Taw-\nmahls, or corn-cakes of ground green corn, wrapped in husks and roasted in the ashes, or boiled, were also favor-\nites. Peppers (kaw-aw-kull) were a good deal used for seasoning and relishes.\nToday the country of the Pima is very destitute of large game but he adds to the above bill of fare all the small\ngame, especially rabbits, quail and doves, that he can kill. In the old days when the Gila always had water it held fine\nfish and the Indians caught them with their hands or swept them up on the banks by long chains of willow hurdles\nor faggots, carried around the fish by waders. I could not learn that they ever had any true fish-nets or fish-hooks;\nnor any rafts, canoes or other boats. But owing to the frequent necessity of crossing the treacherous Gila the men,\nand many of the women, were good swimmers.\nThe Toe-hawn-awh Aw-aw-tam, or Papagoes, whose reservation is in Pima County, near Tucson (and\ncalled St. Xavier) are counted \u201cblood brothers\u201d of the Pimas, speak essentially the same language, are on the most\ncordial terms with them, and are under the same agency.\nThe Maricopas are a refugee tribe, related to the Yumas, who once threatened them with extermination because\nof an inter-tribal feud. They were adopted by the Pimas and protected by them, and have ever since lived with them\nas one people, having however a different language, identical with that of the Yumas.\nThe Quojatas are a small tribe, of the Piman stock, living south of the Casa Grande.\nThe total number of Pimas, Papagoes and Maricopas in the U. S. is now estimated at about 8000, the Pimas\nalone as 4000.\nI am not a linguist, or a philologist, and my time was short with these people, and I did not go to any extent into\ntheir language, or study its grammar. Their voices were soft and pleasant, and I was continually surprised at the low\ntones in which they generally conversed and the quickness with which they heard. But their words were most awk-\nward to my tongue. There were German sounds, and French sounds, too, I would say, in their language, and there\nwere letters that seemed to disappear as they uttered them, or never to come really forth, and syllables that were\nswallowed like spoonfuls of hot soup. But I trust that I am substantially correct in the words that I have retained in\nthe stories and that I have written them so that the English reader can pronounce them in a way to be understood.\nThe accent is generally on the first syllable.\n359 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nThe Story of Ah-Ahn-He-Eat-Toe-Pahk Mah-Mahkai\nAnd there was an orphan named Ah-ahn-he-eat-toe-pahk Mahkai (which means Braided-Feather Doctor) who\nlived at a place called Two Reservoirs (Go-awk-Vahp-itchee-kee) north of Cheoff-Skawmack, or Tall Gray Mountain.\nAnd his only relative was an old grandmother. And she used to go and get water in earthern vessels, a number\nof them in her carrying basket. And when she neared home she would call to her grandson, saying: \u201cCome, help me\nwrestle with it!\u201d meaning to help her down with her load. And he would jump and run, and wrestle so roughly he\nwould break all the vessels in her basket.\nAnd thus was he mean and mischievous, a bad boy in many ways. And one day his grandmother sent him to\nget some of the vegetable called \u201cowl\u2019s-feathers,\u201d which the Awawtam cook by making it into a sort of tortilla, baked\non the hot ground where a fire has just been. And he went and found an owl and pulled its feathers out & brought\nthem to the old woman, and she said: \u201cThis is not what I want! It is a vegetable that I mean!\u201d\nAnd so he went off again and got the vegetable owl\u2019s-feathers for her.\nAfter that she sent him for the vegetables named \u201ccrow\u2019s-feet\u201d and \u201cblack bird\u2019s-eyes,\u201d saying to him that they\nwere very good cooked together. And the mischievous orphan went & got the feet of some real crows and the eyes\nof real blackbirds and brought them to her. And she said: \u201cThis is not what I mean! I want the vegetables named\nafter these things!\u201d\nAnd the boy, who was then about twelve years old, went and got what she wanted and she cooked them.\nAnd this orphan boy had a dream which he liked and wished to have come true, and went to a dance that was\nbeing danced in the neighborhood, a ceremonial dance such as is celebrated when a young girl arrives at woman-\nhood, and he went to see it, hoping it would in some way be like his dream, but when he saw it he was disgusted.\nAnd he went to hear the song of a singing doctor, a mahkai or medicine-man, but when he heard his singing he\nwas disgusted with that too.\nAnd he left his home and on his way found a little house, or kee, made of rough bushes. And the one who lived\ntherein invited him to stay awhile and see all the different people who would arrive there.\nAnd he did so, and in the early evening they came\u2014all the fiercest animals, cougars, bears, eagles, and they\nwere bewitching each other, but nobody bewitched him, and in the morning he went on.\nAnd he went along until he came to another kee, and the owner invited him to stay over night and see all\nthe people who came there. And he did so, and in the early evening came the same creatures and did the same as\nbefore, but he was not bewitched.\nAnd he went on again till he came to a desert place, utterly barren, without trees or bushes and there a wind\ncame to meet him, a whirlwind, Seev-a-lick, and it caught him up and carried him to the East & then back again,\nand to the North and back again; and to the West & back again; and then South & back again. And so it got posses-\nsion of his soul and carried it off to its own place.\nAnd Seevalick, the whirlwind, said to him: \u201cYou shall be like me.\u201d\nAnd there his dream. came true and he said: \u201cThis is what I was looking for; this it is for which I was travelling.\u201d\nAnd he wished to go back, and the wind took his soul back again into his body, and so he returned to his home.\nAnd after his return he was the best young man in the country, kind to everybody, and everybody liked him.\nBut he did not care to be with boys of his own age, but liked better to be with the wise old men, and went where\nthey came together at nights. And he would sit and listen to them, but did not attempt to make any speeches him-\nself. His reasons were that the young were often vicious, thieves, beggars, murderers, and he would rather be with\nthe old who followed what was better.\nAnd in the evening he would often hear the old people say: \u201cWe will go rabbit-hunting in such a place,\u201d but he\nstayed at home and did not go with them.\nBut one night, after a while, when they said: \u201cTomorrow we will go jack-rabbit hunting,\u201d he went home as they\ndid, but the next morning, when they went hunting, he went and made himself a bow & arrows, as Seevalick had\ntold him and placed them where he could find them.\nAnd the next evening they were talking again of hunting, and appointed a place to meet, and the following\nmorning, when they were getting ready, he got his bows & arrows, but he did not come quite up to the meeting\nplace, but sat a little way off.\nAnd as he sat there the people came up to him and made fun of him and asked him if he expected to kill any-\nthing with his weapons, for he had made a big bow & arrows as the Whirlwind had done. And the people handed\nthese about among themselves, laughing, and when they were thru ridiculing them they brought back the bow\nand arrows and laid them down before him. But he said nothing, and when the people were thru he left the bow &\narrows there, and went home and went again to look for a suitable stick to make a bow from.\nAnd he made a new bow & arrows and left them where he could find them, and went home.\nAnd again he went in the evening to the old people\u2019s gathering and heard them appoint a place for the\nhunting, and went home when they did. And in the morning, when he heard the signal cry for hunting, he went\n360 Aw-aw-tam Indian Nights: The Myths and Legends of the Pimas\nand got his bow & arrows and followed after them again, but again stayed some distance off. And again the people\ncame about him and handled his bow & arrows and laughed at them. And again he left them lying there on the\nground and went home to make a new bow & arrows.\nAnd the fourth time this happened he was late at the place of meeting, and before he came the one at whose\nhouse the meeting was said to the others: \u201cThere is a young man who has been several times with us to the place\nwhere we come together for the hunting, and I suppose he has made a new bow & arrows today, for he has to do\nthat whenever you handle his weapons. Now I want you not to handle his weapons any more, but to let him be till\nwe see what he will do, for it appears to me that he is some kind of a powerful personage (mahkai).\nAnd Toehahvs, who was listening, said: \u201cYou yourself, were the very first to handle his weapons.\u201d\nAnd the next morning when Ahahnheeattoepahk Mahkai heard the signal yells for the hunting, he went to the\nmeeting place, with his bow and arrows, and sat away off, as before, but this time nobody came to him.\nAnd then the hunting began, and in it some one called to him: \u201cThere is a jack-rabbit (choo-uff) coming\nyour way!\u201d and he shot the rabbit with his arrow; but when he came to it he did not pick it up, but grasped the ar-\nrow and with a swinging motion threw the rabbit from it to the man nearest him.\nAnd thus he went on all day, killing rabbits and giving them to others, keeping none for himself.\nAnd again he was late at the place of meeting, and the man who had spoken the night before said: \u201cNow you\nsee what he has done! This is the fourth bow that he has made. If you people had left him alone before, he would,\nbefore. this, have been killing game for you. And now if you do not disturb him I am sure he will go on, and you\nwill have jack-rabbits to eat all the time.\u201d\nAnd so he killed rabbits at every hunt, and gave them away, especially to the old. Whenever he killed one he\nwould pick it up and give it to an old man, and keep on that way.\nAnd one night at the place of meeting the spokesman said: \u201cTomorrow we will surround the mountain and\nhunt deer, and we will put him at the place where the deer will run, and we will see how many he will kill!\u201d\nAnd in the morning, at the mountain, they placed him at the deer-run, and told him to \u201cshut the valley,\u201d mean-\ning for him to head-off and kill any deer which might run toward him. But the young man began to get big rocks\nand try to make a wall to close the valley up, and paid no attention to the deer running past him, and when the\npeople came, and asked him about his shooting he said: \u201cYou did not tell me to kill the deer, you told me to \u2018shut the\nvalley.\u2019\u201d\n(Not but what he understood them, but he was acting again as he had once done with his grandmother.)\nAnd the next day they tried another mountain and said: \u201cWe will see if the young man will kill us any deer\nthere.\u201d So when they came to this mountain they told him to go to a certain valley, on the other side, and hang\nhimself there. This is a form of speech which means to hang around or remain at a place; but the young hunter went\nthere and left his bow & arrows on the ground, and hung himself up by his two hands clasped around the limb of a\ntree.\nAnd after they had chased many deer in his direction they said: \u201cLet us go now & butcher-up the deer the\nyoung man has killed, for he must have killed a good many by this time.\u201d\nBut when they came to where the young man was, there he hung by his hands, and when they asked him how\nmany he had killed, he said: \u201cI have not killed any. You did not tell me to kill any, only to hang myself here, which I\ndid, and I have hung here and watched the deer running past.\nAnd they tried him again, on another morning, at another valley, and this time they told him if he saw a doe big\nwith fawn, \u201csnon-ham,\u201d which is also the word used for a woman soon to become a mother, he should kill her. And\nhe went to his place, and there came by such a woman and he shot her down and killed her.\nAnd the next day they took him to another mountain and told him to kill the \u201ckurly,\u201d which means the old, but\nthey meant him to understand old deer. And when they came to him later to butcher-up the deer he had killed, and\nasked him where they were, he replied: \u201cI have not killed any deer, you did not tell me to kill deer, but to kill the\nkurly, and there is the kurly I have killed!\u201d\nAnd it was the old man who goes ahead whom he had shot with his arrow.\nAnd after they had buried the old man they returned to the village, and that night the man who owned the\nmeeting place said: \u201cTomorrow we must give him another trial, and this time I want you to tell him straight just\nwhat you want. Tell him to kill the deer, either young or old, and he will do it. If you had done this before he would\nhave killed us many deer. You should have understood him better by this time, but you did not tell him straight, and\nnow he has killed two of us.\u201d\nAnd the next morning they took him to another mountain, and placed him in a low place, and told him to kill\nall the deer which came his way. And, when they went after a while, after chasing many deer toward him, they asked\nhim where the deer were which he had killed, and he replied: \u201cDown in the low place you will find plenty deer.\u201d\nAnd they went there and found many dead deer of all kinds, and butchered them up.\n361 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nNotes on \u201cThe Story of Ah-Ahn-He-Eat-Toe-Pahk Mah-Mahkai\u201d\nIn the story of Ah-ahn-he-eat-toe-pahk Mahkai we are introduced to the Indian faith in dreams and to more\nwitchcraft. We come, too, to the national sport of rabbit-hunting, with its picturesqueness and excitement.\nIn the transaction between Seevalick and the boy we have a reappearance of the world-wide belief that there is a\nconnection between the wind and the human soul.\nThe strange quality of savage humor, labored, sometimes gruesome, and often tragic, appears in the latter part\nof the tale.\nIt is noticeable that they buried the old man, but no mention is made of burying the woman who was shot. The\nPimas of old time buried their dead in a sitting posture, neck and knees tied together with ropes, four to six feet\nunder ground, and covered the grave with logs and thorn-brush to keep away wolves. The interment was usually at\nnight, with chants, but without other ceremony. Then, immediately after, the house of the deceased was burned, and\nall personal effects destroyed, even food; the horses and cattle being killed and eaten by the mourners, excepting\nsuch as the deceased might have given to his heirs. After the prescribed time of mourning (one month for a child\nor distant relative, six months or a year for husband or wife) the name of the dead was never more mentioned and\neverything about him treated as forgotten.\nThe Maricopas burn their dead.\nIt is noticeable, too, that no one appears to have punished the slayer for his murderous practical jokes. Indeed,\nwhile the Awawtam appear to have been people of exceptionally good character, it also appears that they seldom\npunished any crimes except by a sort of boycott or pressure of public disapproval.\nThe Story of Vandaih, the Man-Eagle\nAnd thus Ahahnheteatoepahk Mahkai became famous for the killing of game; and there was another young\nman, named Van-daih, who wanted to be his friend, So one day Vandaih made him four tube-pipes of cane, such as\nthe Indians use for ceremonious smoking, and went to see the young hunter. But when he entered the young man\nwas lying down, and he just looked at Vandaih and then turned his face away, saying nothing,\nAnd Vandaih sat there and when the young man became tired of lying one way and turned over he lit up one of\nhis pipes. But the young man took no notice of him. And this went on all night. Every time there was a chance Van-\ndaih tried his pipe, but Ahahnheeattoepahk Mahkai never spoke, and in the morning Vandaih went away without\nthe friend he desired having responded to him.\nThe next evening Vandaih came again and sat there all night, but the friend he courted never said a word, and\nin the morning he went away again.\nAnd he slept in the daytime, and when evening came he went again, and sat all night long, but the young man\nspoke to him not at all.\nAnd the third morning that this happened the wife of Ahahnheeattoepahk Mahkai said to him: \u201cWhy are you\nso mean to Vandaih as never to speak to him? Perhaps he has something important to say. He comes here every\nnight, and sits the whole night thru before you, and you do not speak to him. And maybe he will come tonight\nagain, and I feel very sorry for him that you never say a word to him when he comes.\u201d\nAnd the young man said: \u201cI know it is true, what you have said, but I know, too, very well, that Vandaih is not a\ngood man. He gambles with the gains-skoot, he is a liar, thief, licentious, and is everything that is bad. I wish some\nother boys would come to see me instead of him, and better than he, for I know very well that he will repeat things\nthat I say in a way that I did not mean and raise a scandal about it.\u201d\nAnd the next night Vandaih came again and sat in the same place; and when Ahahnheeattoepahk Mahkai\nsaw him he just looked at him and then turned over and went to sleep. But along in the night he awoke, and when\nVandaih saw he was awake he lit one of his pipes. Then Ahahnheeattoepahk Mahkai got up. And when he got up\nVandaih buried his pipe, but the other said: \u201cWhat do you bury your pipe for? I want to smoke.\u201d\nVandaih said: \u201cI have another pipe,\u201d and he lit one and gave it to Ahahnheeattoepahk Mahkai, and then he dug\nup own pipe, and relighted it, and they both began to smoke.\nAnd Ahahnheeattoepahk Mahkai said: \u201cWhen did you come?\u201d And Vandaih replied: \u201cO just a little while ago.\u201d\nAnd Ahahnheeattoepahk Mahkai said: \u201cI have seen you here for four nights, now, but I know you too well not\nto know you have a way to follow,\u201d (\u201ca way to follow\u201d means to have some purpose behind) \u201cbut if you will quit all\nthe bad habits you have I will be glad to have you come; but there are many others, better than you, whom I would\nrather have come to see me.\nAnd now I am going to tell you something, but I am afraid that when you go away from here you will tell what I\nhave said and make more of it, and then people will talk, and I shall be sorry.\nI will tell you the habits you have\u2014you are a liar, a gambler with the dice-game and the wah-pah-tee, a beggar,\nyou follow after women and are a thief.\n362 Aw-aw-tam Indian Nights: The Myths and Legends of the Pimas\nNow I want you to stop these bad habits. You may not know all that the people say about you: They say that\nwhen any hunter brings in game you are always the first to be there, and you will be very apt to swallow charcoal if\nyou are so greedy.\nWherever you go, when the people see you coming, they say: \u2018There comes a man who is a thief,\u2019 and they hide\ntheir precious things. When you arrive they are kind to you, of course, but they do not care much about you.\nI don\u2019t know whether you know that people talk thus about you, but it is a great shame to me to know,\nwhen I have done some bad thing, that people talk about it.\nNow if you quit these things you will be happy, and I want you to stop them. I am not angry with you, but I\nwant you to know how the people are talking about you.\nNow I want you to go home, but not say anything about what I have told you. Just take a rest, and tomorrow\nnight come again.\u201d\nAnd the next night Vandaih came again, and Ahahnheeattoepahk Mahkai was in bed when he came, but he got\nright up and received him, and said: \u201cNow after this I mean to tell you what is for your good, but I want you to keep\nquiet about it. There are many people that gamble with you. If they ask you again to gamble with them, do not do\nit. Tell them you do not gamble any more. And if they do not stop when you tell them this, but keep on asking you,\ncome to me, and tell me, first, that you are going to play. And if I tell you, then, that I do not want you to gamble, I\nwant you not to do it, but if I tell you you may gamble & you win once, then you may bet again, but I do not want\nyou to keep on after winning twice. Twice is enough. But if the other man beats you at first, then I do not want you\nto play any more, but to quit gambling forever.\u201d\nAnd after this a man did want to gamble with Vandaih, but Vandaih said: \u201cI have nothing to wager, and so can-\nnot play with you.\u201d\nAnd still another man wanted to gamble with him, and he made him the same answer, but this man kept on\nasking, and at last Vandaih said: \u201cPerhaps I will play with you, I will see about it. But I must have a little time first.\u201d\nAnd he came to Ahahnheeattoepahk Mahkai and said: \u201cThere is a man who keeps on asking me to gamble with\nhim, and I have come to tell you about it as you told me to do.\u201d\nAnd Ahahnheeattoepahk Mahkai told him to gamble, and gave him things to wager on the game, but said: \u201cIf\nhe beats you I do not want you to gamble any more.\u201d\nAnd Vandaih took the things which had been given him, and went & played a game with this man who was so\npersistent, and won a game. And he played another game and won that, and then he said, \u201cThat is enough, I do not\nwant to play any more;\u201d but the other man kept on asking him to play.\nBut Vandaih refused & took the things which he had won to Ahahnheeattoepahk Mahkai and gave them all to\nhim.\nAnd the next morning he gambled again, and won twice, and he stopped after the second winning, as before.\nAnd thus the young man kept on winning and Ahahnheeattoepahk Mahkai made gainskoot (dice-sticks) for\nhim, and this was one reason why he won, for Ahahnheeattoepahk Mahkai was a powerful doctor & the dice were\ncharmed.\nAnd he beat every one who played against him till he had beat all the gamblers of his neighborhood, and then\ndistant gamblers came & he beat them also. And so he won all the precious things that were in the country and gave\nall to Ahahnheeattoepahk Mahkai & kept nothing back. But one man went to Ee-ee-toy, who was living at the Salt\nRiver Mountain (Mo-hah-dheck) and asked him to let him have some things to wager against Vandaih. And Ee-ee-\ntoy said: \u201cYou can have whatever you want, and I will go along to see the game.\u201d\nBut when Ee-ee-toy got there he found the dice were not like common dice, and it would be difficult for any\none to win against them, they were made by so powerful a man.\nAnd Ee-eetoy went westward and found a powerful doctor who had a daughter, and said to the father: \u201cI want\nyour daughter to go around to all the big trees and find me all the feathers she can of large birds, not of small birds,\nand bring them here. And I will come again & see what she may have found.\u201d\nAnd her father told her, and the very next morning she began to hunt the feathers, and when Ee-eetoy came\nagain she had a bundle, and Eeeetoy took them and took the pith out of their shafts and cleansed every feather\nwhich she had brought him.\nAnd Ee-ee-toy threw away the pith and cut the shafts into small pieces and told the girl to roast them in\na broken pot over a fire; and she got the broken pot & roasted them, and they curled up as they roasted till they\nlooked like grains of corn. And then he told her to roast some real corn & mix both together and grind them all up\nvery fine, And Ee-ee-toy told her to take some ollas of this pinole in her syih-haw to the reservoirs.\nAnd she did so, and passed by where Vandaih was going to play, and Vandaih said: \u201cBefore I can play I must\ndrink.\u201d But the man who was playing with him said: \u201cGet some water of some one near,\u201d but Vandaih said, \u201cI would\nrather go to the reservoir.\u201d\nAnd Ee-ee-toy had prepared the girl before this, telling her that when she passed the players Vandaih would\n363 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nfollow her to the reservoir and want too marry her. \u201cBe polite to him,\u201d he said \u201cand ask him to drink some of the\npinole, and to see your parents first.\u201d\nAnd the man who was going to gamble with Vandaih asked him not to go so far, for he wanted to gamble right\naway, but Vandaih replied: \u201cI would rather go there. I will come right back. You be making holes till I get back.\u201d\nSo the girl went to the reservoir, and Vandaih followed her and asked her to be his wife, and she said: \u201cI want\nyou to drink some of this pinole, and in the evening you may go and see my folks and ask them about it.\u201d\nSo Vandaih mixed some pinole and drank it, and it made him feet feverish, like one with a cold; and the second\ntime he drank the gooseflesh came out on his skin; and the third time he drank feathers came out all over him; and\nthe fourth time long feathers grew out on his arms, and the fifth time he became an eagle and went and perched on\nthe high place, or bank of the reservoir.\nThen the girl went to the place where the other man was waiting to play the game and told all the people to\ncome and see the terrible thing which had happened to Vandaih.\nAnd the people, when they saw him, got their bows and arrows and surrounded him and were going to shoot him.\nAnd they fired arrows at him, and some of them struck him, but could not pierce him, and then all were afraid\nof him. And first he began to hop around, and then to fly a little higher, until he perched on a tree, but he broke the\ntree down; and he tried another tree and broke that down; and then he flew to a mountain and tumbled its rocks\ndown its side, and finally he settled on a strong cliff. And even the cliff swayed at first as if it would fall;\u2014but finally\nit settled and stood still.\nAnd this was foretold when the earth was being made, that one of the race of men should be turned into an\neagle. Vandaih was a handsome man, but he had a bad character, and ever since the beginning parents had warned\ntheir children to practice virtue lest they be turned into eagles; because it had been foretold that some good-looking\nbad person should be thus transformed, and it was to be seen that good-looking people were often bad and homely\nones good characters.\nAnd Vandaih took that cliff for his residence and hunted over all the country round about, killing jack-rabbits,\ndeer and all kinds of game for his food. And when the game became scarce he turned to men and one day he killed\na man and took the body to his cliff to eat. And after this manner he went on. Early in the morning he would bring\nhome a human being, and sometimes he would bring home two.\nThen the people sent a messenger to Ee-eetoy, to his home on Mohahdheck, asking him to kill for them this\nman-eagle. And Ee-ee-toy said to the man: \u201cYou can go back, and in about four days I will be there.\u201d But when the\nfourth day came Ee-eetoy had not arrived, as he had promised, but Vandaih was among the people, killing them,\ncarrying them away to -the cliff.\nAnd the people again sent the messenger, saying to him: \u201cYou must tell Ee-ee-toy he must come and help his\npeople or we shall all be lost.\u201d\nAnd the man delivered his message and Ee-ee-toy said, as before, that he would be there in four days.\nAnd this went on, the people sending to Ee-ee-toy, and Ee-ee-toy promising to come in four days, until a\nwhole year had passed. And not only for one year, but for four years, for the people had misunderstood him, and\nwhen he said four days he meant four years, and so for four years it went on as we have said.\n(Now Ee-ee-toy and Vandaih were relatives, and that was one reason why Ee-ee-toy kept the people waiting so\nlong for his help and worked to gain time. He did not want to hurt Vandaih.)\nBut when the fourth year came Ee-ee-toy did go, and told the people to get him the \u201cseed-roaster.\u201d\nAnd the people ran around, guessing what he meant, and they brought him the charcoal, but Ee-ee-toy said: \u201cI\ndid not mean this, I meant the \u2018seed-roaster\u2019!\u201d\nSo they ran around again, and they brought him the long open earthen vessel with handles at each end, used for\nroasting, and with it they brought the charcoal which is made from ironwood. But he said: \u201cI did not mean these. I\nmean the \u2018seed-roaster.\u2019\u201d\nAnd they kept on guessing, and nobody could guess it right. They brought him the black stones of the nah-\ndahcote, or fire place, and he said: \u201cI do not want these. I want the \u2018seed-roaster.\u2019\u201d\nAnd the people kept on guessing, and could not guess it right, and so, at last, he told them that what he wanted\nwas obsidian, that black volcanic stone, like glass, from which arrow heads are made. And this was what he called\nthe \u201cseed-roaster.\u201d\nSo the people got it for him.\nThen he told them to bring him four springy sticks. And they ran and brought all the kinds of springy sticks\nthey could find, but he told them he did not mean any of these.\nAnd for many days they kept on trying to get him the sticks which he wanted. And after they had completely\nfailed Ee-ee-toy told them what he wanted. It was a kind of stick called vahs-iff, which did not grow there, therefore\nthey had not been able to find it. And beside vahsiff sticks were not springy sticks at all, but the strongest kind of\nsticks, very stiff.\n364 Aw-aw-tam Indian Nights: The Myths and Legends of the Pimas\nSo they sent a person to get these, who brought them, and Ee-ee-toy whittled them so that they had sharp\npoints. And there were four of them.\nAnd Ee-ee-toy said: \u201cNow I am going, and I want you to watch the top of the highest mountain, and if you see a\nbig cloud over it, you will know I have done something wonderful. But if there is a fog over the world for four days\nyou will know I am killed.\u201d\nWhen he started he allowed one of the dust storms of the desert to arise, and went in that, so that the man-ea-\ngle should not see him.\nFor many days he journeyed toward the cliff, and when sunset of the last day came he was still a good way off;\nbut he went on and arrived at the foot of the cliff after it was dark, and hid himself there under a rock.\nAbout daybreak the man-eagle got up and flew around the cliff four times and then flew off. And after he was\ngone Ee-ee-toy took one of his sticks and stuck it into a crack in the cliff, and climbed on it, and stuck another\nabove it and so he went on to the top, pulling out the sticks behind him and putting them in above.\nAnd when he got to the home of the man-eagle, Vandaih, on the top of the cliff, he found a woman there. And\nshe was the same woman who had given Vandaih the pinole with eagles\u2019 feathers in it. He had found her, and car-\nried her up there, and made her his wife.\nWhen Ee-ee-toy came to the woman he found she had a little boy, and he asked her if the child could speak yet,\nand she replied that he was just beginning to talk; and he enquired further when the man-eagle would return, and\nshe said that formerly when game was plenty he had not stayed away long, but now that game was scarce it usually\ntook him about half a day, so he likely would not be there till noon.\nAnd Ee-ee-toy enquired: \u201cWhat does he do when he comes back? Does he sleep or not? Does he lie right down,\nor does he go looking around first?\u201d\nAnd the wife said: \u201cHe looks all around first, everywhere. And even the little flies he will kill, he is so afraid that\nsome one will come to kill him. And after he has looked around, and finished eating, he comes to lay his head in my\nlap and have me look for the lice in his head. And it is then that he goes to sleep.\u201d\nSo Ee-ee-toy turned into a big fly and hid in a crack in the rock, and asked the woman if she could see him, and\nshe said: \u201cYes, I can see you very plainly.\u201d\nAnd he hid himself three times, and each time she could see him, but the fourth time he got into one of the\ndead bodies, into its lungs, and had her pile the other dead bodies over him, and then when he asked her she said:\n\u201cNo, I cannot see you now.\u201d\nAnd Ee-ee-toy told her: \u201cAs soon as he goes to sleep, whistle, so that I may know that he is surely asleep.\u201d\nAt noon Ee-ee-toy heard the man-eagle coming. He-was bringing two bodies, still living & moaning, and dropped\nthem over the place where Ee-ee-toy lay. And the first thing the man-eagle did was to look all around, and he said to\nhis wife: \u201cWhat smell is this that I smell?\u201d And she said: \u201cWhat kind of a smell?\u201d And he replied: \u201cWhy, it smells like an\nuncooked person!\u201d \u201cThese you have just brought in are uncooked persons, perhaps it is these you smell.\u201d\nThen Vandaih went to the pile of dead bodies and turned them over & over, but the oldest body at the bottom\nhe did not examine, for he did not think there could be anyone there.\nSo his wife cooked his dinner, and he ate it and then asked her to look for the lice in his head. And as he lay\ndown he saw a fly pass before his face, and he jumped up to catch it, but the fly got into a crack in the rock where he\ncould not get it.\nAnd when he lay down again the child said: \u201cFather! come!\u201d And Vandaih said: \u201cWhy does he say that? He\nnever said that before. He must be trying to tell me that some one is coming to .injure me!\u201d But the wife said: \u201cYou\nknow he is only learning to talk, and what he means is that he is glad that his father has come. That is very plain.\u201d\nBut Vandaih said: \u201cNo, I think he is trying to tell me some one has come.\u201d\nBut at last Vandaih lay down and the woman searched his head and sang to put him to sleep. And when he\nseemed sound asleep she whistled. And her whistle waked him up and he said: \u201cWhy did you whistle! you never\ndid that before?\u201d And she said: \u201cI whistled because I am so glad about the game you have brought. I used to feel bad\nabout the people you killed, but now I know I must be contented & rejoice when you have a good hunt. And after\nthis I will whistle every time when you bring game home.\u201d\nAnd she sang him to sleep again, and whistled when he slept; and waked him up again, and said the same thing\nagain in reply to his question.\nAnd the third time, while she was singing, she turned Vandaih\u2019s head from side to side. And when he seemed\nfast asleep she whistled. And after she had whistled she turned the head again, but Vandaih did not get up, and so\nshe knew that this time he was fast asleep.\nSo Ee-ee-toy came out of the dead body he had hidden in, and came to where Vandaih was, and the woman laid\nhis head down & left him. And Ee-ee-toy took the knife which he had made from the volcanic glass, obsidian, and\ncut Vandaih\u2019s throat, and beheaded him, and threw his head eastward & his body westward. And he beheaded the\nchild, too, and threw its head westward and its body eastward.\n365 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nAnd because of the killing of so powerful a personage the cliff swayed as if it would fall down, but Ee-ee-toy\ntook one of his sharpened stakes and drove it into the cliff and told the woman to hold onto that; and he took an-\nother and drove that in and took hold of that himself.\nAnd after the cliff had steadied enuf, Ee-ee-toy told the woman to heat some water, and when she had done so\nhe sprinkled the dead bodies.\nThe first ones he sprinkled came to life and he asked them where there home was & when they told him he sent\nthem there by his power.\nAnd he had more water heated and sprinkled more bodies, and when he learned where their home was he sent\nthem home, also, by his power.\nAnd this was done a third time, with a third set of bodies.\nAnd the forth time the hot water was sprinkled on the oldest bodies of all, the mere skeletons, and it took them a\nlong time to come to life, and when they were revived they could not remember where their homes were or where they\nhad come from.. So Ee-ee-toy cutoff eagles\u2019 feathers slanting-wise (pens) and gave them, and gave them dried blood\nmixed with water (ink) and told them their home should be in the East, and by the sign of the slanting-cut feather they\nshould know each other. And they are the white people of this day. And he sent them eastward by his power.\nAnd in the evening he & the woman went down the cliff by the aid of the sharpened stakes, even as he had\ncome up, and when they reached the foot of the mountain they stayed there over night. They took some of the long\neagle feathers and made a kee from them, & some of the soft eagle feathers and made a bed with them. And they\nstayed there four nights, at the foot of the cliff.\nAnd after a day\u2019s journey they made another kee of shorter eagle feathers, and a bed of tail feathers. And they\nstaid at this second camp four nights.\nAnd then they journeyed on again another day and build another kee, like the first one, & stayed there also four nights.\nAnd they journeyed on yet another day and built again a kee, like the second one, and stayed there four nights.\nAnd on the morning of each fourth day Ee-ee-toy took the bath of purification, as the Pimas have since done\nwhen they have slain Apaches, and when he arrived home he did not go right among the people but stayed out in\nthe bushes for a while.\nAnd the people knew he had killed Vandaih, the man-eagle, for they had watched and had seen the cloud over\nthe high mountain.\nAnd after the killing of Vandaih, for a long time, the people had nothing to be afraid of, and they were all happy.\nNotes on \u201cThe Story of Vandaih\u201d\nIn the story of Vandaih we are given a curious glimpse into Indian friendship. The reference to smoking, too,\nis interesting. The Pimas had no true pipes. They used only cigarettes of tobacco and corn-husk, or else short tubes\nof cane stuffed with tobacco. These I have called tube-pipes. They smoked on all ceremonial occasions, but appear\nto have had no distinctive pipe of peace. The ceremonial pipes of cane had bunches of little birds\u2019 feathers tied to\nthem, and in my photo of the old seeneeyawkum he holds such a ceremonial pipe in his hand.\n\u201cHe gambles with the gain-skoot:\u201d The gain-skoot were the Pima dice\u2014two sticks so marked and painted as\nto represent the numerals kee-ick (four) and choat-puh (six), and two called respectively see-ick-ko, the value of\nwhich was fourteen, and gains, the value of which was fifteen. These were to be held in the hand and knocked in the\nair with a flat round stone. At the same time there was to be on the ground a parallelogram of holes with a sort of\ngoal, or \u201chome,\u201d at two corners. If the sticks all fell with face sides up they counted five, If all fell with blank sides up\nit was ten. If only one face side turned up it counted its full value, but if two or three turned up then they counted\nonly as one each. If a gain was scored the count was kept by placing little sticks or stones (soy-yee-kuh) in the holes\nas counters. If the second player overtook the first in a hole the first man was \u201ckilled\u201d and had to begin over. Among\nall Indians gambling was a besetting vice, and there was nothing they would not wager.\nSometimes instead of the gain-skoot they used waw-pah-tee, which was simply a guessing game. They guessed in\nwhich hand a certain painted stick was held, or in which of four decorated cane-tubes, filled with sand, a certain little\nball was hidden and wagered on their guess. These tubes were differently marked, and one was named \u201cOld Man,\u201d one\n\u201cOld Woman,\u201d one \u201cBlack Head,\u201d and one \u201cBlack in the Middle.\u201d Sticks were given to keep count of winnings.\nThe moral advice which Ahahnheeattoepahk Mahkai gives Vandaih, is very quaint, and the shrewd cunning with\nwhich he loads the dice, pockets the proceeds, and yet finally unloads all the blame on poor Vandaih, is quite of a piece\nwith the confused morals of most folk-lore in all lands. On these points it is really very hard to understand the workings\nof the primitive mind. Here is certain proof that the modern conscience has evoluted from something very chaotic.\nIt will be noticed that Vandaih drinks the pinole, which bewitches him, five times instead of the usual four. Whether\nthis is a mistake of the seeneeyawkum, or significant I do not know. Perhaps four is a lucky and five an unlucky number.\nAnother variation in the numerical order is in the woman whistling only three times, in putting Vandaih to sleep.\nAs I have before pointed out the reference to white men, and pens and ink, is evidently a modern interpolation,\n366 Aw-aw-tam Indian Nights: The Myths and Legends of the Pimas\nnot altogether lacking in flavor of sarcasm.\nThere are suggestions in this story of Jack the Giant Killer, of the Roc of the Arabian Nights, of the harpies, and\nof the frightful creatures, part human, part animal, so familiar in all ancient folk-lore.\nThe latter part of this tale is particularly interesting, as perhaps throwing light on the origin of that mysterious\nprocess of purification for slaying enemies, so peculiar to the Pimas.\nIt seems to have been held by the Awawtam that to kill an Apache rendered the slayer unclean, even tho the act\nitself was most valiant and praiseworthy, and must be expiated by an elaborate process of purification. From old\nComalk Hawk Kih I got a careful description of the process.\nAccording to his account, as soon as an Apache had been killed, if possible, the fact was at once telegraphed to\nthe watchers at home by the smoke signal from some mountain. This custom is evidently referred to in E-ee-toy\u2019s\ncloud over a high mountain as a signal of success. The Indians apparently regarded smoke and clouds as closely\nrelated, if not the same, as is shown in their faith in the power of tobacco to make rain.\nAs soon as the Apache has been killed the slayer begins to fast and to look for a \u201cfather.\u201d His \u201cfather\u201d is one who\nis to perform all his usual duties for him, for be is now unclean and cannot do these himself. The \u201cfather,\u201d too, must\nknow how to perform all the ceremonial duties necessary to his office, as will be explained. If a \u201cfather\u201d can be found\namong the war-party the slayer need only fast two days, but if not he must wait till he gets home again, even if it takes\nfour or more days. It appears that this friend, who has charge of the slayer, is humorously called a \u201cfather\u201d because his\n\u201cchild\u201d is usually so restless under his long fast, and keeps asking him to do things for him and divert him.\nIt there is no \u201cfather\u201d for him in the war-party, as soon as possible a messenger is sent on ahead to get some one\nat home to take the office for him, and to make the fires in the kee, that being a man\u2019s special duty. And the wife of\nthe slayer is also now unclean by his act, and must purify herself as long as he, tho she must keep apart from him.\nAnd she also must have a substitute to do her usual work. She must keep close at home, and her husband, the slayer,\nremain out in the bushes till the purification is accomplished.\nFor two days the fast is complete, but on the morning of the third day the slayer is allowed one drink of pinole,\nvery thin, and no more than he can drink at one breath. The moment he pauses he can have no more at that time.\nWhen presenting this pinole. the \u201cfather\u201d makes this speech:\n\u201cYour fame has come, and I was overjoyed, and have run all the way to the ocean, and back again, bringing you\nthis water.\nOn my return I strengthened myself four times, and in the dish in which I carried the, water stood See-vick-a\nWay-hohm, The Red Thunder Person, the Lightning, and because of his force I fell down.\nAnd when I got up I smelled the water in the dish, and it smelled as if something had been burned in it.\nAnd when I got up I strengthened myself four times, and there came from the sky, and stood in the dish, Tone-\ndum Bah-ahk The Eagle of Light. And he turned the water in the dish in a circle, and because of his force I fell\ndown, and when I rose up again and smelled the water in the dish it was stinking.\nAnd when I had started again I strengthened myself four times, and Vee-sick the Chicken Hawk, came down\nfrom the sky and stood in the dish. And by his force I was thrown down. And when I stood again and smelled the\nwater in the dish, it smelled like fresh blood.\nAnd I started again, strengthening myself four times, and there came from the East our gray cousin, Skaw-mack\nTee-worm-gall, The Coyote, who threw me down again, and stood in the dish, and turned the water around, and left\nit smelling as the coyote smells.\nAnd when I rose up I started again, and in coming to you I have rested four times; and now I have brought you\nthe water, and so many powerful beings have done wonderful things to it that I want you to drink it all at one time.\u201d\nAfter the third day the \u201cfather\u201d brings his charge a little to eat every morning and evening, but a very little.\nOn the morning of the fourth day, at daybreak the slayer takes a bath of purification, even if it is winter and he\nhas to break the ice and dive under to do it. And this is repeated on the morning of each fourth day, till four baths\nhave been taken in sixteen days.\nThe slayer finds an owl and without killing him pulls long feathers out of his wings and takes them home. The\nslayer had cut a little lock of hair from the head of the Apache he had killed. (for in old times, at least, the Pimas\noften took no scalps) and now a little bag of buck-skin is made, and a ball of grease-wood gum is stuck on the end\nof this lock of hair which is placed in the bag, and on the bag are tied a feather of the owl and one from a chicken\nhawk, and some of the soft feathers of an eagle, and around the neck of the bag a string of blue beads.\n(And during this time the women are carrying wood in their giyh-haws to the dancing place.)\nNow the Apaches are contemptuously called children, and this bag represents a child, being supposed to con-\ntain the ghost of the dead Apache, and the slayer sits on the ground with it, and takes it in his hands as if it were a\nbaby, and inhales from it four times as if he were kissing it. And when it is time for the dance the slayers who are\na good ways off from the dancing place start before sunset, but those who are close wait till the sun is down. And\nthe \u201cfather\u201d goes with the slayer, through woods and bushes, avoiding roads. And before this the \u201cFather\u201d has dug\n367 Compact Anthology of World Literature\na hole at the dancing place about ten inches deep and two feet wide, just big enough for a man to squat in with legs\nfolded, and behind the hole planted a mezquite fork, about five feet high, on which are hung the weapons of the\nslayer, his shield, club, bow, quiver of arrows, perhaps his gun or lance.\n(The shield was made of raw hide, very thick, able to turn an arrow and was painted jet black by a mixture of\nmezquite gum and charcoal, with water, which made it glossy and shiny. The design on it was in white, or red and\nwhite. The handle was of wood, curved, placed in the centre of the inside, bound down at the ends by raw. hide, and\nthe hand fended from the rough shield by a piece of sheepskin.)\nIn this hole the slayer sits down and behind him and the fork lies down his dancer, for the slayer himself does\nnot dance but some stranger who represents him perhaps a Papago or a Maricopa, drawn from a distance by the\nfame of the exploit. Nor do the slayers sing, but old men who in their day have slain Apaches. These singers are each\nallowed to sing two songs of their own choice, the rest of the veterans joining in. And as soon as the first old man\nbegins to sing, the dancers get up, take the weapons of the men they represent, and dance around the fire, which the\n\u201cfathers\u201d keep burning, keeping time with the song.\nAnd the women cook all kinds of good things, and set them before the singers, but the bystanders jump in and\nsnatch them away. But sometimes the wife of an old singer will get something and save it for him.\nAnd the relatives of the slayers will bring presents for the dancers, buckskin, baskets, and anything that an Indi-\nan values. And as soon as presented some relative of the dancer runs in and takes the present and keeps it for him.\nAnd while this big war-dance is going on the rest of the people are having dances in little separate groups, all\naround. And as soon as the dance is over the weapons are returned to the forks they were taken from.\nBy this time it is nearly morning, and the slayers get up and take their bath in the river, and return and dry\nthemselves by the expiring fire. Then returning to the bushes they remain there again four days, and that is the last\nof their purification.\nAs this dance is on the eve of the sixteenth day, there were twenty days in all.\nGrossmans account differs considerably from this, and is worth reading.\nDuring the time of purifying, the slayers wear their hair in a strange way, like the top-knot of a white woman,\nsomewhat, and in it stick a stick, called a kuess\u2014kote to scratch themselves with, as they are not allowed to use the\nfingers. This is alluded to in the Story of Paht-ahn-kum\u2019s War. A picture of a Maricopa interpreter, with his hair thus\narranged, is in the report of Col. W. H. Emory, before alluded to. This picture is interesting, because it shows that\nthe Maricopas, when with the Pimas, adopted the same custom. When I showed this picture to the old see-nee-\nyaw-kum he was much interested, saying he himself had known this man, who was a relative of his, there being a\ndash of Maricopa blood in his family, and that he had been born in Mexico and had there learned Spanish enough\nto be an interpreter. His Mexican name, he said, was Francisco Lucas, but the Pimas called him How-app-ahl Tone-\num-kum, or Thirsty Hawk, a name which has an amusing significance when we recall what Emory says about his\ntaste for aguardiente, and that Captain Johnston says of the same man, \u201cthe dog had a liquorish tooth.\u201d\noF CAnnIBALS\nMichel de Montaigne (1533-1592)\nPublished 1580\nFrance\nMichel de Montaigne is best known for the literary genre he largely invented: the essay. His massive Essais,\ntranslated by Montaigne\u2019s first English translator Charles Cotton in 1685-1686 as \u201cAttempts,\u201d is a collection of\nshorter written pieces that raise questions and significant issues while often deferring to give final accounts of\nthe subjects he treats. The Essais feature a frank, skeptical, and (unusual up to this time) personal consciousness,\nblending serious philosophical discourse with witty biographical anecdotes in a style both original and strikingly\nmodern. His open-minded and questioning approach to his subject matter directly influenced Descartes and other\nthinkers who paved the way for modern scientific inquiry. When young and growing up in an aristocratic family,\nMontaigne received a model humanist education devised by his father, who insisted that his son learn Latin as his\nfirst language. Later as a distinguished courtier and lawyer at the court of Charles IX, Montaigne witnessed costly\nand violent religious conflicts pitting Protestants against Catholics, and a disdain for intolerance runs through his\nwritings. The essay \u201cOf Cannibals,\u201d known by Shakespeare and referenced in his late play The Tempest (1610-11),\nfeatures a central irony one often finds in Montaigne\u2019s writings. Relying upon contemporary accounts of barbarism\nand savagery in the peoples of the New World, Montaigne contrasts the colonized with their European colonizers,\nwho have their own agenda of greed and violence. Ultimately, he finds war (\u201cthe human disease\u201d) more prevalent\nand more selfishly motivated among the Europeans than among the allegedly uncivilized natives. In characteristic\n368 Of Cannibals\nfashion, Montaigne calls into question an accepted binary, in this case, of civilized\/uncivilized, as he asks his reader\nto rethink the subject of inquiry.\nQuestions to consider while reading this selection:\n\u2022 Montaigne begins his essay with a flurry of quotations from learned writers of the Classical (Greek and\nRoman) period. Why does he do this? What is the effect of his doing so?\n\u2022 In his essay, Montaigne sets up a contrast between a \u201cplain ignorant fellow\u201d and \u201cbetter-bred sort of men.\u201d\nAside from economics, what sets the two apart?\n\u2022 Montaigne is renowned for being a \u201cskeptic,\u201d a questioner of accepted beliefs and customs. Give a few ex-\namples of his skeptical take on things.\nWritten by Douglass Thomson\nSelection from Montaigne\u2019s essays [of Cannibals]\nLicense: Public Domain\nMichel de Montaigne, translated by John Florio\nAt what time King Pirrhus came into Italie, after he had survaid the marshalling of the Armie, which the\nRomans sent against him: \u2018I wot not,\u2019 said he, \u2018what barbarous men these are (for so were the Grecians wont to\ncall all strange nations) \u2018but the disposition of this Armie, which I see, is nothing barbarous.\u2019 So said the Grecians\nof that which Flaminius sent into their countrie: And Philip viewing from a Tower the order and distribution of\nthe Romaine camp, in his kingdome under Publius Sulpitius Galba. See how a man ought to take heed, lest he\nover-weeningly follow vulgar opinions, which should be measured by the rule of reason, and not by the common\nreport. I have had long time dwelling with me a man, who for the space of ten or twelve yeares had dwelt in that\nother worlde which in our age was lately discovered in those parts where Villegaignon first landed, and surnamed\nAntartike France. This discoverie of so infinit and vast a countrie, seemeth worthy great consideration. I wot not\nwhether I can warrant my selfe, that some other be not discovered hereafter, sithence so many worthy men, and\nbetter learned than we are, have so many ages beene deceived in this. I feare me our eies be greater than our bellies,\nand that we have more curiositie than capacitie. We embrace all, but we fasten nothing but wind. Plato maketh\nSolon to report (Plat. Tim.) that he had learn\u2019t of the Priests of the Citie of Says in \u00c6gypt, that whilom, and before\nthe generall Deluge, there was a great land called Atlantis, situated at the mouth of the strait of Gibraltar, which\ncontained more firme land than Affrike and Asia together. And that the kings of that countrie did not only possesse\nthat Iland, but had so farre entred into the maine land, that of the bredth of Affrike, they held as farre as \u00c6gypt; and\nof Europes length, as farre as Tuscanie: and that they undertooke to invade Asia, and to subdue all the nations that\ncompasse the Mediterranean Sea, to the gulfe of Mare-Maggiore [the Black Sea], and to that end they traversed all\nSpaine, France and Italie, so farre as Greece, where the Athenians made head against them; but that a while after,\nboth the Athenians themselves, and that great Iland, were swallowed up by the Deluge. It is verie likely this extreme\nruine of waters wrought strange alterations in the habitations of the earth; as some hold that the Sea hath divided\nSicilie from Italie,\nH\u00e6c loca vi quandam, et vasta convulsa ruina\nDissiluisse ferunt, cum protinus utraque tellus\nVna foret. \u2014 Virg \u00c6n. iii 414, 416.\nThen say, sometimes this land by that forsaken,\nAnd that by this, we re split, and ruine-shaken,\nWhereas till then both lands as one were taken.\nCypres from Suria, the Iland of Negroponto from the maine land of Beotia, and in other places joyned lands\nthat were sundred by the Sea, filling with mud and sand the chanels betweene them.\n------ sterilisque diu palus aptaque remis\nVicinas urbes alit, et grave sentit aratrum. \u2014 Hor.

Besides, our moderne Navigations have now almost discovered that it is not an\nIland, but rather firme land, and a continent, with the East Indias on one side, and the countries lying under the\ntwo Poles on the other; from which if it be divided, it is with so narrow a strait and intervall, that it no way deser-\nveth to be named an Iland: For, it seemeth there are certaine motions in these vast bodies, some naturall, and other\nsome febricitant, as well as in ours. When I consider the impression my river of Dordoigne worketh in my time,\ntoward the right shoare of her descent, and how much it hath gained in twentie yeares, and how many foundations\nof divers houses it hath overwhelmed and violently carried away; I confesse it to be an extraordinarie agitation: for,\nshould it alwaies keepe one course, or had it ever kept the same, the figure of the world had ere this beene over-\nthrowne: But they are subject to changes and alterations. Sometimes they overflow and spread themselves on one\nside, sometimes on another; and other times they containe themselves in their naturall beds or chanels: I speak\nnot of sudden inundations, whereof we now treat the causes. In Medoc alongst the Sea-coast, my brother the Lord\nof Arsacke, may see a towne of his buried under the sands, which the sea casteth up before it: The tops of some\nbuildings are yet to be discerned. His Rents and Demaines have beene changed into barren pastures. The inhabi-\ntants thereabouts affirme, that some yeares since, the Sea encrocheth so much upon them, that they have lost foure\nleagues of firme land: These sands are her fore-runners. And we see great hillocks of gravell moving, which march\nhalfe a league before it, and usurpe on the firme land. The other testimonie of antiquitie, to which some will referre\nthis discoverie, is in Aristotle (if at least that little booke of unheard of wonders be his) where he reporteth that cor-\ntaine Carthaginians having sailed athwart the Atlantike Sea, without the strait of Gibraltar, after long time, they at\nlast discovered a great fertill Iland, all replenished with goodly woods, and watred with great and deepe rivers, farre\ndistant from al land, and that both they and others, allured by the goodnes and fertility of the same, went thither\nwith their wives, children, and household, and there began to inhabit and settle themselves. The Lords of Carthage\nseeing their countrie by little and little to be dispeopled, made a law and expresse inhibition, that upon paine of\ndeath no more men should goe thither, and banished all that were gone thither to dwell, fearing (as they said) that\nin successe of time, they would so multiply as they might one day supplant them, and overthrow their owne estate.\nThis narration of Aristotle hath no reference unto our new found countries. This servant I had, was a simple and\nrough-hewen fellow: a condition fit to yeeld a true testimonie. For, subtile people may indeed marke more curious-\nly, and observe things more exactly, but they amplifie and glose them: and the better to perswade, and make their\ninterpretations of more validitie, they cannot chuse but somewhat alter the storie. They never represent things truly,\nbut fashion and maske them according to the visage they saw them in; and to purchase credit to their judgement,\nand draw you on to beleeve them, they commonly adorne, enlarge, yea, and hyperbolize the matter. Wherein is re-\nquired either a most sincere reporter, or a man so simple, that he may, have no invention to build upon, and to give\na true likelihood unto false devices, and be not wedded to his owne will. Such a one was my man; who besides his\nowne report, hath many times shewed me divers Mariners and Merchants, whom hee had knowne in that voyage.\nSo am I pleased with his information, that I never enquire what Cosmographers say of it. We had need of Topogra-\nphers to make us particular narrations of the places they have beene in. For some of them, if they have the advan-\ntage of us, that they have seene Palestine, will challenge a privilege, to tell us newes of all the world besides. I would\nhave every man write what he knowes, and no more: not only in that, but in all other subjects. For one may have\nparticular knowledge of the nature of one river, and experience of the qualitie of one fountaine, that in other things\nknowes no more than another man: who neverthelesse to publish this little scantling, will undertake to write of all\nthe Physickes. From which vice proceed divers great inconveniences. Now to returne to my purpose I finde (as farre\nas I have beene informed) there is nothing in that nation that is either barbarous or savage, unless men call that\nbarbarisme which is not common to them. As indeed, we have no other ayme of truth and reason, than the exam-\nple and Idea of the opinions and customes of the countrie we live in. There is ever perfect religion, perfect policie,\nperfect and compleat use of all things. They are even savage, as we call those fruits wilde which nature of her selfe\na nd of her ordinarie progresse hath produced: whereas indeed, they are those which our selves have altered by our\nartificiall devices, and diverted from their common order, we should rather terme savage. In those are the true and\nmost profitable vertues, and naturall properties most lively and vigorous, which in these we have bastardized, apph-\ning them to the pleasure of our corrupted taste. And if notwithstanding, in divers fruits of those countries that were\nnever tilled, we shall finde that in respect of ours they are most excellent, and as delicate unto our taste; there is no\nreason, art should gaine the point of honour of our great and puissant mother Nature. We have so much by our in-\nventions surcharged the beauties and riches of her workes, that we have altogether overchoaked her: yet where ever\nher puritie shineth, she makes our vaine and frivolous enterprises wonderfully ashamed.\nEt veniunt hader\u00e6 sponte sua melius,\nSurgit et in solis formsior arbutus antris.\nEt volucres nulla dulcius arte canunt. \u2014 Propert. i El. ii. 10.\n370 Of Cannibals\nIvies spring better of their owne accord,\nUnhaunted spots much fairer trees afford.\nBirds by no art much sweeter notes record.\nAll our endeavour or wit cannot so much as reach to represent the nest of the least birdlet, its contexture,\nbeautie, profit and use, no nor the web of a seely spider. All things (saith Plato) are produced either by nature, by\nfortune, or by art. The greatest and fairest by one or other of the two first, the least and imperfect by the last. Those\nnations seeme therefore so barbarous unto me, because they have received very little fashion from humane wit, and\nare yet neere their originall naturalitie. The lawes of nature doe yet command them which are but little bastardized\nby ours, and that with such puritie, as I am sometimes grieved the knowledge of it came no sooner to light, at what\ntime there were men that better than we could have judged of it. I am sorie Lycurgus and Plato had it not: for me\nseemeth that what in those nations we see by experience, doth not only exceed all the pictures wherewith licentious\nPoesie hath proudly imbellished the golden age, and all her quaint inventions to faine a happy condition of man,\nbut also the conception and desire of Philosophy. They could not imagine a genuitie so pure and simple as we see\nit by experience; nor ever beleeve our societie might be maintained with so little art and humane combination. It\nis a nation, would I answer Plato, that hath no kinde of traffike, no knowledge of Letters, no intelligence of num-\nbers, no name of magistrate, nor of politike superioritie; no use of service, of riches or of povertie; no contracts, no\nsuccessions, no partitions, no occupation but idle; no respect of kindred, but common, no apparell but naturall, no\nmanuring of lands, no use of wine, corne, or mettle. The very words that import lying, falshood, treason, dissimu-\nlations, covetousnes, envie, detraction, and pardon, were never heard of amongst them. How dissonant would hee\nfinde his imaginarie common-wealth from this perfection?\nHos natura modos primum dedit.\nNature at first uprise,\nThese manners did devise.\nFurtherrnore, they live in a country of so exceeding pleasant and temperate situation, that as my testimonies\nhave told me, it is verie rare to see a sicke body amongst them; and they have further assured me, they never saw\nany man there either shaking with the palsie, tooth lesse, with eies dropping, or crooked and stooping through age.\nThey are seated along the sea-coast, encompassed toward the land with huge and steepie mountaines, having\nbetweene both, a hundred leagues or thereabout of open and champaine ground. They have great abundance of fish\nand flesh, that have no resemblance at all with ours, and eat them without any sawces or skill of Cookerie, but\nplaine boiled or broiled. The first man that brought a horse thither, althongh he had in many other voyages con-\nversed with them, bred so great a horror in the land, that before they could take notice of him, they slew him with\narrowes. Their buildings are very long, and able to containe two or three hundred soules, covered with barkes of\ngreat trees, fastned in the ground at one end, enterlaced and joyned close together by the tops, after the manner of\nsome of our Granges; the covering whereof hangs downe to the ground, and steadeth them as a flancke. They have a\nkinde of wood so hard, that ryving and cleaving the same, they make blades, swords, and gridirons to broile their\nmeat with. Their beds are of a kinde of cotten cloth, fastened to the house roofe, as our ship-cabbanes: everie one\nhath his severall couch for the women lie from their husbands. They rise with the Sunne, and feed for all day, as\nsoone as they are up: and make no more meales atter that. They drinke not at meat, as Suidas reporteth, of some\nother people of the East, which dranke after meales but drinke many times a day, and are much given to pledge\ncarowses. Their drinke is made of a certaine root, and of the colour of our Claret wines, which lasteth but two or\nthree daies; they drinke it warme: It hath somewhat a sharpe taste, wholesome for the stomack, nothing heady, but\nlaxative for such as are not used unto it, yet verie pleasing to such as are accustomed unto it. In stead of bread, they\nuse a certaine white composition, like unto Corianders confected. I have eaten some, the taste whereof is somewhat\nsweet and wallowish. They spend the whole day in dancing. Their young men goe a hunting after wilde beasts with\nbowes and arroes. Their women busie themselves therewhil\u2019st with warming of their drinke, which is their chiefest\noffice. Some of their old men, in the morning before they goe to eating, preach in common to all the household,\nwalking from one end of the house to the other, repeating one selfe-same sentence many times, till he have ended\nhis turne (for their buildings are a hundred paces in length) he commends but two things unto his auditorie. First\nvalour against their enemies, then lovingnesse unto their wives. They never misse (for their restrainte) to put men\nin minde of this dutie, that it is their wives whiche keepe their drinke luke-warme and well-seasoned. The forme of\ntheir beds, cords, swords blades, and woodden bracelets, wherewith they cover their hand wrists, when they fight,\nand great Canes open at one end, by the sound of which they keepe time and cadence in their dancing, are in many\nplaces to be seene, and namely in mine owne house. They are shaven all over, much more close and cleaner than\nwee are, with no other Razors than of wood or stone. They beleeve their soules to be eternall, and those that have\n371 Compact Anthology of World Literature\ndeserved well of their Gods to be placed in that part of heaven where the Sunne riseth, and the cursed toward the\nWest in opposition. They have certaine Prophets and Priests which commonly abide in the mountaines, and very\nseldome shew themselves unto the people; but when they come downe there is a great feast prepared, and a solemne\nassembly of manie towneshipes together (each grange as I have described maketh a village, and they are about a\nFrench league one from another.) The Prophet speakes to the people in public, exhorting them to embrace vertue,\nand follow their dutie. All their moral discipline containeth but these two articles; first an undismaied resolution to\nwarre, then an inviolable affection to their wives. Hee doth also Prognosticate of things to come, and what successe\nthey shall hope for in their enterprises hee neither swadeth or disswadeth them from warre but if he chance to\nmisse of his divination, and that it succeed otherwise than hee foretold them, if hee be taken, he is hewen in a\nthousand peeces, and condemned for a false Prophet. And therefore he that hath once misreckoned himselfe is\nnever seene againe. Divination is the gift of God; the abusing whereof should be a punishable imposture. When the\nDivines amongst the Scythians had foretold an untruth, they were couched along upon hurdles full of heath or\nbrushwood, drawne by oxen, and so manicled hand and foot, burned to death. Those which manage matters subject\nto the conduct of man\u2019s sufficiencie are excusable, although they shew the utmost of their skill. But those that gull\nand conicatch us with the assurance of an extraordinarie facultie, and which is beyond our knowledge, ought to be\ndouble punished; first because they performe not the effect of their promise, then for the rashnesse of their impos-\nture and unadvisednesse of their fraud. They warre against the nations that lie beyond their mountaines, to which\nthey go naked, having no other weapons than bowes or woodden swords, sharpe at one end as our broaches are. It\nis an admirable thing to see the constant resolution of their combats, which never end but by effusion of blood and\nmurther: for they know not what feare or rowts are. Every Victor brings home the head of the enemie he hath slaine\nas a Trophey of his victorie, and fasteneth the same at the entrance of his dwelling place. After they have long time\nused and entreated their prisoners well, and with all commodities they can devise, he that is the Master of them;\nsommining a great assembly of his acquaintance; tieth a corde to one of the prisoners armes, by the end whereof he\nholds him fast, with some distance from him, for fear he might offend him, and giveth the other arme, bound in\nlike manner, to the dearest friend he hath, and both in the presence of all the assembly kill him with swords: which\ndone, they roast and then eat him in common, and send some slices of him to such of their friends as are absent. It\nis not, as some imagine, to nourish themselves with it (as anciently the Scithians wont to doe), but to represent an\nextreme and inexpiable revenge. Which we prove thus; some of them perceiving the Portugales, who had confeder-\nated themselves with their adversaries, to use another kinde of death when they tooke them prisoners; which was,\nto burie them up to the middle, and against the upper part of the body to shoot arrowes, and then being almost\ndead, to hang them up; they supposed, that the people of the other world (as they who had sowed the knowledge of\nmany vices amongst their neighbours, and were much more cunning in all kindes of evils and mischiefe than they)\nunder-tooke not this manner of revenge without cause, and that consequently it was more smartfull and cruell than\ntheirs, and thereupon began to leave their old fashion to follow this. I am not sorie we note the barbarous horror of\nsuch an action, but grieved, that prying so narrowly into their faults we are so blinded in ours. I thinke there is\nmore barbarisme in eating men alive, than to feed upon them being dead; to mangle by tortures and torments a\nbody full of lively sense, to roast him in peeces, and to make dogs and swine to gnaw and teare him in mammocks\n(as we have not only read, but seene very lately, yea and in our owne memorie, not amongst ancient enemies, but\nour neighbours and fellow-citizens; and which is worse, under pretence of pietie and religion) than to roast and eat\nhim after he is dead. Chrysippus and Zeno, arch-pillars of the Stoicke sect, have supposed that it was no hurt at all\nin time of need, and to what end soever, to make use of our carrion bodies, and to feed upon them, as did our\nforefathers, who being besieged by C\u00e6sar in the Citie of Alexia, resolved to sustaine the famine of the siege, with\nthe bodies of old men, women, and other persons unserviceable and unfit to fight.\nVascones (fama est) alimentis talibus usi\nProduxere ammas. \u2014 Juven. Sat. xv. 93.\nGascoynes (as fame reports)\nLiv\u2019d with meats of such sortes.\nAnd Physitians feare not, in all kindes of compositions availefull to our health, to make use of it, be it for\noutward or inward applications. But there was never any opinion found so unnaturall and immodest, that would\nexcuse treason, treacherie, disloyaltie, tyrannie, crueltie, and such like, which are our ordinarie faults. We may\nthen well call them barbarous, in regard to reasons rules, but not in respect of us that exceed them in all kindes of\nbarbarisme. Their warres are noble and generous and have as much excuse and beautie as this humane infirmitie\nmay admit: they ayme at nought so much, and have no other foundation amongst them, but the meere jelousie\nof vertue. They contend not for the gaining of new lands; for to this day they yet enioy that natural ubertie and\nfruitfulnesse, which without labouring toyle, doth in such plenteous abundance furnish them with all necessary\n372 Of Cannibals\nthings, that they need not enlarge their limits. They are yet in that happy estate as they desire no more than what\ntheir naturall necessities direct them: whatsoever is beyond it, is to them superfluous. Those that are much about\none age, doe generally enter-call one another brethren, and such as are younger they call children, and the aged\nare esteemed as fathers to all the rest. These leave this full possession of goods in common, and without division to\ntheir heires, without other claim or title but that which nature doth plainely impart unto all creatures, even as shee\nbrings them into the world. If their neighbours chance to come over the mountaines to assaile or invade them, and\nthat they get the victorie over them, the Victors conquest is glorie, and the advantage to be and remaine superior\nin valour and vertue: else have they nothing to doe with the goods and spoyles of the vanquished, and so returne\ninto their countrie, where they neither want any necessarie thing, nor lacke this great portion, to know how to\nenjoy their condition happily, and are contented with what nature affoordeth them. So doe these when their turne\ncommeth. They require no other ransome of their prisoners, but an acknowledgement and confession that they\nare vanquished. And in a whole age, a man shall not finde one that doth not rather embrace death, than either by\nword or countenance remissely to yeeld one jot of an invincible courage. There is none seene that would not rather\nbe slaine and devoured, than sue for life, or shew any feare. They use their prisoners with all libertie, thatl they may\nso much the more hold their lives deare and precious, and commonly entertaine them with threats of future death,\nwith the torments they shall endure, with the preparations intended for that purpose, with mangling and slicing of\ntheir members, and with the feast that shall be kept at their charge. All which is done, to wrest some remisse, and\nexact some faint yeelding speech of submission from them, or to possesse them with a desire to escape or run away;\nthat so they may have the advantage to have danted and made them afraid, and to have forced their constancie. For\ncertainly true victorie consisteth in that only point.\n------ Victoria nulla est\nQuam qu\u00e6 confessos animo quoque subjugat hostes.\n\u2014 Claud. vi. Cons. Hon. Pan. 245.\nNo conquest such, as to suppresse\nFoes hearts, the conquest to confesse.\nThe Hungarians, a most warre-like nation, were whilome wont to pursue their prey Tio longer than they had\nforced their enemie to yeeld unto their mercy. For, having wrested this confession from him, they set him at libertie\nwithout offence or ransome, except it were to make him sweare never after to beare armes against them. Wee get\nmany advantages of our enemies, that are but borrowed and not ours: It is the qualitie of porterly-rascall, and not of\nvertue, to have stronger armes and sturdier legs: Disposition is a dead and corporall qualitie. It is a tricke of fortune\nto make our enemie stoope, and to bleare his eies with the Sunnes-light: It is a pranke of skill and knowledge to be\ncunning in the art of fencing, and which may happen unto a base and worthelesse man. The reputation and worth\nof a man consisteth in his heart and will: therin consists true honour: Constancie is valour, not of armesand legs but\nof minde and courage; it consisteth not of the spirit and courage of our horse, nor of our armes, but in ours. He that\nobstinately faileth in his courage, Si succiderit, de genu pugnat. \u2018If hee slip or fall he fights upon his knee.\u2019 He that in\ndanger of imminent death is no whit danted in his assurednesse; he that in yeelding up his ghost beholding his\nenemie with a scornefull and fierce looke, he is vanquished, not by us, but by fortune: he is slaine, but not con-\nquered. The most valiant are often the most unfortunate. So are there triumphant losses in envie of victories. Not\nthose foure sister victories, the fairest that ever the Sunne beheld with his allseeing eie, of Salamis, of Plate\u00e6, of\nMycale, and of Sicilia, durst ever dare to oppose all their glorie together to the glorie of the King Leonidas his\ndiscomfiture and of his men, at the passage of Thermopyl\u00e6: what man did ever run with so glorious an envie or\nmore ambitious desire to the goale of a combat, than Captaine Ischolas to an evident losse and overthrow? who so\ningeniously or more politikely did ever assure himselfe of his welfare than he of his ruine? he was appointed to\ndefend a certaine passage of Peloponesus against the Arcadians, which finding himselfe altogether unable to\nperforme, seeing the nature of the place and inequalitie of the forces, and resolving that whatsoever should present\nit selfe unto his enemie, must necessarily be utterly defeated: On the other side, deeming it unworthy both his\nvertue and magnanimitie, and the Lacedemonian name, to faile or faint in his charge, betweene these two extremi-\nties he resolved upon a meane and indifferent course, which was this. The youngest and best-disposed of his troupe\nhe reserved for the service and defence of their countrie, to which hee sent them backe; and with those whose losse\nwas least, and who might best be spared, he determined to maintaine that passage, and by their death to force the\nenemie to purchase the entrance of it as deare as possibly he could; as indeed it followed. For being suddenly\nenvironed round by the Arcadians, after a great slaughter made of them, both himselfe and all his were put to the\nsword. Is any Trophey assigned for conquerours that is not more duly due unto these conquered? A true conquest\nrespecteth rather an undanted resolution, an honourable end, than a faire escape, and the honour of vertue doth\nmore consist in combating than in beating. But to returne to our historie, these prisoners, howsoever they are dealt\n373 Compact Anthology of World Literature\nwithall, are so farre from yeelding, that contrariwise during two or three moneths that they are kept, they ever carry\na cheerfull countenance, and urge their keepers to hasten their triall, they outragiously dote and injure them. They\nupbraid them with their cowardlinesse, and with the number of battels they have lost againe theirs. I have a song\nmade by a prisoner, wher ein is this clause, \u2018Let them boldly come altogether, and flocks in multitudes, to feed on\nhim; for with him they shall feed upon their fathers and grandfathers, that heretofore have served his body for food\nand nourishment: These muscles,\u2019 saith he, \u2018this flesh, and these veines, are your owne; fond men as you are, know\nyou not that the substance of your forefathers limbes is yet tied unto ours? Taste them welle for in them shall you\nfinde the relish of your owne flesh:\u2019 An invention, that hath no shew of barbarisme. Those that paint them dying,\nand that represent this action, when they are put to execution, delineate the prisoners spitting in their executioners\nfaces, and making mowes at them. Verily, so long as breath is in their body they never cease to brave and defie\nthem, both in speech and countenance. Surely in respect of us these are very savage men: for either they must be so\nin good sooth, or we must be so indeed; There is a wondrous difference betweene their forme and ours. Their men\nhave many wives, and by how much more they are reputed valiant so much the greater is their number. The manner\nand beautie of their marriages is wondrous strange and remarkable: For, the same jealousie our wives have to keepe\nus from the love and affection of other women, the same have theirs to procure it. Being more carefull for their\nhusbands honour and content than of any thing else, they endevour and apply all their industrie to have as many\nrivals as possibly they can, forasmuch as it is a testimonie of their husbands vertue. Our women would count it a\nwonder, but it is not so: It is vertue properly Matrimoniall, but of the highest kinde. And in the Bible, Lea, Rachell,\nSara, and Iacobs wives brought their fairest maiden servants into their husbands beds. And Livia seconded the\nlustfull appetites of Augustus to her great prejudice. And Stratonica, the wife of King Dejotarus did not only bring\nthe most beauteous chamber-maide that served her to her husbands bed, but very carefully brought up the children\nhe begot on her, and by all possible meanes aided and furthered them to succeed in their fathers royaltie. And least\na man should thinke that all this is done by a simple and servile or awefull dutie unto their custome, and by the\nimpression of their ancient customes authoritie, without discourse or judgement, and because they are so blockish\nand dull- spirited, that they can take no other resolution, it is not amisse we alleage some evidence of their sufficien-\ncie. Besides what I have said of one of their warlike songs, I have another amorous canzonet, which beginneth in\nthis sense: \u2018Adder stay, stay good adder, that my sister may by the patterne of thy partie-coloured coat drawe the\nfashion and worke of a rich lace, for me to give unto my love; so may thy beautie, thy nimblenesse or disposition be\never preferred before all other serpents.\u2019 The first couplet is the burthen of the song. I am so conversant with Poesie\nthat I may judge this invention hath no barbarisme at all in it, but is altogether Anacreontike. Their language is a\nkinde of pleasant speech, and hath a pleasing sound, and some affinitie with the Greeke terminations. Three of that\nnation, ignorant how deare the knowledge of our corruptions will one day cost their repose, securitie, and happi-\nnesse, and how their ruine shall proceed from this commerce, which I imagine is already well advanced (miserable\nas they are to have suffered themselves to be so cosened by a desire of new-fangled novelties, and to have quit the\ncalmnesse of their climate to come and see ours), were at Roane in the time of our late King Charles the ninth, who\ntalked with them a great while. They were shewed our fashions, our pompe, and the forme of a faire citie; afterward\nsome demanded their advice, and would needs know of them what things of note and admirable they had observed\namongst us: they answered three things, the last of which I have forgotten, and am very sorie for it, the other two I\nyet remember. They said, \u2018First they found it very strange that so many tall men with long beards, strong and well\narmed, as it were about the Kings person [it is very likely they meant the Switzers of his guard] would submit\nthemselves to obey a beardlesse childe, and that we did not rather chuse one amongst them to command the rest.\u2019\nSecondly (they have a manner of phrase whereby they call men but a moytie one of another.) \u2018They had perceived\nthere were men amongst us full gorged with all sorts of commodities, and others which, hunger- starved and bare\nwith need and povertie, begged at their gates: and found it strange these moyties so needy could endure such an\ninjustice, and that they tooke not the others by the throate, or set fire on their houses.\u2019 I talked a good while with\none of them, but I had so bad an interpreter, who did so ill apprehend my meaning, and who through his foolish-\nnesse was so troubled to conceive my imaginations, that I could draw no great matter from him. Touching that\npoint, wherein I demanded of him what good he received by the superioritie he had amongst his countriemen (for\nhe was a Captaine and our Mariners called him King), he told me it was to march foremost in any charge of warre:\nfurther, I asked him how many men did follow him, hee shewed me a distance of place, to signifie they were as\nmany as might be contained in so much round, which I guessed to be about 4 or 5 thousand men: moreover,\ndemanded if when warres were ended, all his authoritie expired; he answered, that hee had only this left him, which\nwas, that when he went on progresse, and visited the villages depending of him, the inhabitants prepared paths and\nhigh-waies athwart the hedges of their woods, for him to passe through at ease. All this is not verie ill; but what of\nthat? They weare no kinde of breeches nor hosen.\n374 Popol Vuh\nPoPoL VUH\nTranscribed 1554-1558 (almost certainly drawing from an earlier council book)\nMayan\nThe Popol Vuh (\u2018\u201cThe Book of the People\u201d) provides a valuable record of a subject about which knowledge is\nquite scarce: the Mesoamerican civilization. Specifically, the Popol Vuh provides valuable records of the literate\nMayan Quich\u00e9 people, who once prospered in what is today Guatemala. One finds a sad irony in the fact that the\nsurvival of the text is due to the translation of the Spanish Dominican clergy man Francesco Xim\u00e9ne, as the same\ngroup of colonists who would lead to the destruction of the Mayan empire also preserved one of its most import-\nant cultural documents. Within the Popol Vuh, one finds reference to the Spanish conquerors and Christians, some\nstraightforward allusions, others oblique and debated by scholars. The text is often cited in the study of comparative\nliterature for its Creation and Flood narratives, but Popol Vuh also contains stories that provide the iconic source ma-\nterial for certain important Mayan rituals, such as the ball games and sacrifice. Of special interest is the role played\nby the hero-twins, Hunahp\u00fa and Xbalanqu\u00e9. The twins manage to defeat such threatening forces as Seven Macaw\nand the lords of the underworld not through a display of brawn and bravado but through their wit and trickery. The\nsection of Popol Vuh for the reading ends with a moving prayer for future generations of the Quich\u00e9 people.\nQuestions to consider while reading this selection:\n\u2022 How do Hunahpu and Xbalanque, the heroes of Mayan myth, compare and contrast with other epic heroes\nthat we have encountered in our studies?\n\u2022 In much Western culture, human beings are set above the animal and natural world (see for example the\naccounts of creation inGenesis and Metamorphoses).
