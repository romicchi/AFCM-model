The rate of change \u2013 that is, how\nfast society changes \u2013 has been accelerating since the dawn of industrialization,\nupending the international order and introducing new systems and inventions to\nthe global intellectual marketplace. The 18th and 19th centuries shook traditional\ncultures to their cores with the introduction of human rights, science, nationalism,\nand industrialization; in the 20th century, these changes would further upset and\ncomplicate the world, opening new possibilities and dissolving old ways of living,\nsometimes very rapidly and often against some peoples\u2019 will.\nBefore we take a voyage through the second half of the 20thcentury, we\nneed to do two things. First, we need to define certain terms, such as \u201cdemocracy\u201d\nand \u201csocialism.\u201d These ideas changed how people lived their lives, so we should\nunderstand what they mean and why they represented important changes to\nprevious ideas. Also, words like \u201csocialism\u201d are sometimes used incorrectly and\noften as insults; it wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing to learn the actual meanings, so that we\nare all discussing the same things when we use these words.\nSecond, we need to look at global trends prior to World War II, so that we\ncan better understand why the 20th century was a time of profound change. In\nstudying history, it\u2019s always useful to take a \u201crunning start\u201d at the time period one\nis studying by backing up a few decades first.\nWe will do both in this introduction, defining important terms as we\nexamine the historic trends evident at the start of the 20th century.\n11 Democracy, Nationalism, and Imperialism\nThe idea of \u201cgovernment of the people, by the people, for the people\u201d is not a new\none. The earliest known democracy was 5th Century BCE Athens, although there may have\nbeen other democracies in other advanced societies, such as India. Early democracies were\ndirect democracies \u2013 that is, the entire town would gather in once place, and vote on issues\nwith a show of hands (with women and slaves excluded, of course). Early democracies, such\nas Athens or the Roman Republic, did not last, eventually devolving into empires. In the\nmedieval period, democracy sometimes existed at the local or regional level, with peoples\u2019\nassemblies retaining the power to make some local decisions, although always under the\numbrella of a larger monarchy or oligarchy (rule by a small group of elites). It was not until\nthe American Revolution that the concept of national-level democracy was re-introduced;\nthis time it would be a representative democracy, with elected representatives making the\ndecisions, since in a large society it is impractical for the people get together to vote on\nevery topic.\nDemocracies have certain advantages over monarchies, which surprised many ob-\nservers who expected the United States to fail. If the democracy truly represents the will\nof the people (more or less), the people will perceive it as (more or less) just, and give the\nsystem their loyalty. If the system provides justice and equality, why rebel against it? If a\nsystem provides freedom, why not defend it against foreign invaders who want to impose\ntheir will? Democracies provide the people with more rights and privileges than any other\nsystem, and so create more loyalty and attachment than other systems, explaining the popu-\nlarity of democracy.\nBut these statements come with many caveats. First, democracies do not need to be\nliberal democracies \u2013 that is, democracies in which all adults have the right to vote. For\nmany years, women in Western democracies were not permitted to vote at the federal level.\nIn the United States, it took decades to remove laws preventing voting by those who did\nnot possess a certain amount of property, or who were not members of certain churches.\nIn the United States, slaves were of course barred from voting. Even after slavery ended,\nJim Crow laws in the former Confederate states prevented African Americans from voting\nin those states. When the American founding fathers created the first modern democracy,\nthey allowed landed white males of the correct churches to vote, and closed the door to\nfreedom on everyone else. The following centuries have largely been the story of those who\nwere originally closed out forcing that door back open so that they can also step through.\nThis applies to all the democracies around the world.\nAnother important point about democracy is that it means much more than just\nvoting. Democracy means a dispersal of real power across all of society. Voting means very\nlittle if a small segment of society holds all the real political or economic power. Democracy\nmeans having an independent judiciary \u2013 that is, the judges and courts do not answer to\npolitical leaders, and can make their own decisions. It means having trials by juries, where\ncitizens are judged by their peers, not by elites. It means freedom of the press, where jour-\nnalists can criticize the government without fear of retaliation. It means freedom of religion\n(or from it) and the freedom of association, the right to form workers\u2019 unions or other\ncivic groups. All of this creates a society in which power is dispersed widely through the\npopulation, preventing any one group from dominating the others. Of course, since there\nare always people who want to seize power for themselves, the citizens must constantly be\non their guard against consolidation of power and always be ready to use their voices to\nprevent it. As it has been said: democracy is not a spectator sport. You have to participate.\nDemocracy is the most difficult form of government to maintain. There are a great\n2 Introduction many \u201cfake\u201d democracies in the world, where elections are stolen or otherwise manipulated\nand opposition to the elites is crushed, either bluntly or surreptitiously. This is why elections\nare not the only requirement of democracy; the system demands a real division of power,\nwhich most elites are unwilling to relinquish. Many countries use corrupt elections to con-\nvince their citizens that they live in a real democracy and thus buy their loyalty; typically,\nthe people are not convinced by these shows. They understand the real situation.\nAll these difficulties with democracies makes them inherently unstable, and only\nthe commitment of the citizens keeps them functioning as they should. Democracies can\nand do fail (see Chapter 1 for examples of this). So perhaps the best description of democ-\nracy is Winston Churchill\u2019s: \u201cDemocracy is the worst form of government in the world...\nexcept for all the others.\u201d\nThe rebirth of democracy went hand-in-hand with a new concept, born of the\nFrench and American revolutions: nationalism. Kingdoms and empires \u2013 the most\ncommon forms of governments until the 18th century \u2013 were primarily the private prop-\nerties of their respective kings and emperors. The people living in these states were not\ncitizens; they were subjects of the monarchs, just people who lived on the monarch\u2019s land\nand owed him fealty. Religion was usually used to justify this system. A nation, however, is\ndifferent. A nation is a state which belongs to the people who live there; since these people\nare not the subjects of a monarch, they are citizens, co-owners of the nation with certain\nhuman rights. In a nation, as opposed to a monarchy, the glue holding the state together\nwas set of traits shared by the citizens. These might include language, religion, ethnicity, and\na shared history. These traits create an identity to which, in theory, people give their loyalty\n(for the best explanation of how this happens, see Benedict Anderson\u2019s classic, Imagined\nCommunities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism). Although a nation\nexists only in peoples\u2019 imagination, it is probably the most powerful idea in history, and\nmillions of people have been willing to fight, kill, and die for their nation.\nStarting in the 18th century, certain historical trends combined to weaken mon-\narchies and strengthen nationalism: new Enlightenment concepts of human rights, an\nempowered middle class which wanted the power and wealth reserved for royalty, and in-\ndependence movements within empires, among others. These forces led to the revolutions\nand wars which would, eventually, convert nearly all the world into a community of nations\ninstead of kingdoms.\nHowever, as in democracy, there is an inherent instability within nationalism.\nBecause the nation exists only in the minds of citizens, it invites the question: what is the\nnature of this nation? What does it mean to be a citizen? Who are the real citizens? Who\ngets to make these decisions? What happens to those who don\u2019t \u201cfit in?\u201d Furthermore, na-\ntionalism tends to be chauvinistic, pushing the narrative that the citizens of the nation are\nthe best people in the world, or at least better than their neighbors across the border. This\nis a useful tool for national leaders who want to carry out wars or divert attention from\ninternal problems.\nThese two trends \u2013 democracy and nations \u2013 are very important to the history of\nthe 20th century, as they represent major continuing trends in world history. The develop-\nment of fascism (Chapter 1) was a response to these trends.\nA third related thread in world history is imperialism, summarized in Chapter 4.\nFollowing the growth of nationalism, several of the great empires had fallen by the mid-\n20th century; for example, nationalism and war had destroyed the Austro-Hungarian and\nOttoman empires. The remaining empires were European, with the notable exception of the\nJapanese Empire, which would shortly contend with the West for control of the Pacific.\nToday, although nations still try to dominate and control others, no official empires\nremain; the idea of imperialism has become anathema, so no nation would claim to prac-\ntice it. Before World War II, empire was still alive and well, but the spread of nationalist\n3 consciousness across the world was challenging the concept of empire. People, as a whole,\ndo not like being ruled by foreigners. Furthermore, that the British, French, and Dutch\nempires should practice democracy at home and autocracy in their empires was viewed as\nthe height of hypocrisy by the colonized. Even many Europeans were beginning to reject\nimperialism, a sure sign that the imperial project was endangered. The cognitive dissonance\nof upholding two systems, a free one for white people and an unfree one for nonwhites,\ncould not be maintained for much longer.\nIndustrialization\nIndustrialization basically means using machines to make commodities, rather\nthan making them by hand. Despite this simple definition, industrialization produced the\nmost important transformation of human culture since the development of agriculture\ntwelve thousand years ago.\nThe process began in 18th century England with the development of the first prac-\ntical steam engine. Using this new tireless machine, powered by coal, the English first in-\ndustrialized the textile industry, producing thread, cloth, and clothing with steam-powered\nlooms. This exponentially increased productivity and the volume of available commodities,\nwhich in turn drastically reduced the prices of commodities, suddenly making them afford-\nable to the average person for the first time. Industrialization was also applied to agriculture\nin the forms of tractors, combines, harvesters, threshers, and other machines. This vastly\nincreased agricultural production, drastically reducing the price of food, which had cost\nthe average person about one-third of their income before industrialization; it reduced\nstarvation and improved the overall health of the population. Furthermore, the amount of\nraw materials and finished products now being shipped demanded the industrialization of\ntransportation, leading to railroads and steamships to speed up industrial processes. And\nall the new factories required millions of workers, engineers, and managers, creating new\nemployment opportunities.\nBut industrialization also caused tremendous problems, for which society was not\nprepared. As agriculture industrialized, it required far fewer workers. These farm workers,\nwho in earlier times had numbered perhaps ninety percent of the population, were now\nquickly rendered unemployed \u2013 today, in the United States, only about three percent of\nworkers are farmers. Where did all the farmers go? As industrialization spread, people left\nthe farms, where they were no longer needed, and moved into the cities, looking for jobs\nin the new factories. This unprecedented movement is known as urbanization, and the\nworld\u2019s cities grew as never before.\nUnfortunately, they weren\u2019t ready for it. Builders threw up cheap tenements for\nworkers, who needed living space. But there were few building codes in place; the new\napartments were therefore built with adequate ventilation or running water or even fire es-\ncapes. The tenements became synonymous with squalor and disease, overcrowded hotspots\nfor tuberculosis and dangerous fire traps.\nNor had society had time to adjust to life in the new factories. There were no min-\nimum wage laws, no worker safety standards, no racial or sexual discrimination laws, and\nno maternity leave. Since labor unions were illegal, workers had no way to advocate for\nbetter conditions. There was no unemployment insurance nor old age pensions. Since all\nthe factories had the same conditions, and no motivation to be otherwise, workers had few\nopportunities to improve their lot in life.\nBut social change went even further. In preindustrial times, when almost everyone\nwas a farmer, people lived together in families on farms. The family was an economic unit,\nworking together all day to produce wealth. The father was the \u201cboss\u201d in these patriarchal\n4 Introduction systems, supported by his wife, and the children worked for the family. When the adults\nwere too old to work, their children took care of them. And the elderly, the grandparents,\nwere the most valuable members of society, because over the course of their lives they had\nacquired all the necessary knowledge related to living on a farm. And if the local elite,\nperhaps a manor lord, mistreated the people, the people could always appeal to religious\nauthorities to restrain him on moral grounds. This arrangement had existed everywhere in\nthe world since agriculture was developed, twelve thousand years ago.\nThen, almost overnight, it all changed. Families were replaced by farm machinery,\nand the newly-unemployed flooded into the cities to look for work. The factories, short\nof labor, had jobs ready for them. In the absence of labor laws, workers, including chil-\ndren, worked extremely long hours for low pay in harsh conditions, exposed to dangerous\nmachines and chemicals. They had not a shred of protection from discrimination or other\nabuse. Perhaps worst of all, family bonds were quickly being eroded. People no longer\nworked together as family; they worked for bosses, managers, and owners, who were not re-\nlated to them, who did not care about them at all, perhaps whom they had never even met.\nTheir work lives had become completely impersonal, working with strangers for strangers\nin places that were not theirs; everything was alien in this new world. Children originally\nworked in factories with their parents, but before long, societies created compulsory edu-\ncation to give the children a safe environment while their parents worked and to provide a\nbasic education that a worker would need. This separated children from their parents for at\nleast half the day. And the elderly were no longer useful at all, since their knowledge of farm\nwork was no longer relevant. Those too old to work remained at home alone, largely useless\nto this new society. All these changes produced a social ill that Karl Marx called \u201calienation,\u201d\nthe feeling of being cut off from others, even one\u2019s own family, in this new industrial culture.\nThis new world began in England, then spread to continental Europe. From there,\nindustrialization spread across the world. Some societies, or segments of societies, resisted,\nseeing how it completely changed cultures. Some nations grudgingly accepted it because\nit was strengthening rival nations; this begrudging change was known as defensive mod-\nernization. But it became clear that nonindustrial cultures were at a disadvantage when\ncompeting with the power and wealth of industrial nations. Resistance to capitalism and\nindustrialism continues in certain rural cultures to this day.\nA 19th Century Factory Floor\n5 Socialism\nThe first major industrial city in the world was Manchester, the center of the English\ntextile industry. Upon seeing the living conditions of the factory workers in the city, a young\nGerman named Frederick Engels wrote:\nEverywhere half or wholly ruined buildings\u2026rarely a wooden or stone floor to be\nseen in the houses, almost uniformly broken, ill-fitting windows and doors, and a state of\nfilth! Everywhere heaps of d\u00e9bris, refuse, and offal; standing pools for gutters, and a stench\nwhich alone would make it impossible for a human being in any degree civilised to live in\nsuch a district...Such is the Old Town of Manchester, and on re-reading my description, I\nam forced to admit that instead of being exaggerated, it is far from black enough to convey a\ntrue impression of the filth, ruin, and uninhabitableness, the defiance of all considerations of\ncleanliness, ventilation, and health which characterise the construction of this single district,\ncontaining at least twenty to thirty thousand inhabitants\u2026If any one wishes to see in how\nlittle space a human being can move, how little air \u2013 and such air! \u2013 he can breathe, how\nlittle of civilisation he may share and yet live, it is only necessary to travel hither. Karl Max\nEngels was hardly alone in his assessment of working and living conditions of the\nEnglish working class; those who had migrated from farm to factory were more than aware\nof their terrible plight. They had little choice. They had no farm jobs to which to return, no\neducation useful to their new work, and no recourse to the law. Their only relief came from\nreligious and secular charities, which could hardly counterbalance the weight of such wide-\nspread poverty. This form of capitalism is known as laissez-faire, in which the government\ndoes not regulate business. There were no safety regulations, non-discrimination laws, en-\nvironmental regulations, and so on. Since the creation of agriculture, most people had lived\nand worked on farms, and most economic activity revolved around food. Governments had\nnot foreseen the massive social changes wrought by industrialization, and were not legally\nor legislatively prepared for them. Naturally, there were calls for regulation of business and\ncity planning, to make the workers\u2019 situation more tolerable; these pleas largely fell on deaf\nears in the 19th century, since the factory owners and tenement landlords had little incen-\ntive to regulate their behavior. Any benefits for workers \u2013 higher pay, better working condi-\ntions, and so on \u2013 would by necessity come out of their profits. And these wealthy business\nowners had access to politicians and lawyers, allowing them to retain their privileges. If the\nworkers tried to unionize or strike, the police would handle that.\nTheir problem was that the system could not be maintained for long. The situation\nwas simply too harsh for most people, and hatred of the elites and political pressure grew\namong the disaffected. The industrializing nations of Europe were increasingly democratic,\nallowing the citizens to elect representatives who would legislate change. And if the wealthy\nelites managed to retain power, there was always another, less civilized option: violent revo-\nlution. This was the choice that every industrializing nation faced in the late 19th and early\n20th centuries.\nAn important note before proceeding with the history. Socialism refers to any\nFriedrich Engels\nsocial system (political and economic) which emphasizes the needs of the many over the\nwants and needs of the few. For example, regulating a business to prevent it from poisoning\nthe environment is socialistic thinking, instead of granting it the freedom to do whatever\nit wants (laissez-faire). We are used to thinking of socialism as left-wing (typically called\nMarxism), but there is also a right-wing form of socialism known as national socialism or\nfascism (see Chapter 1).\nReturning to history: Karl Marx and Frederick Engels described a modern form\n6 Introduction of left-wing socialism in their writings in the mid-19th century. This is the system we\ncommonly call socialism. Like doctors, Marx and Engels first described the symptoms of\nmodern society, using about ninety percent of their writings to do so; they then described\ntheir cure, which constituted the last ten percent.\nMarx and Engels asked the question: why did the factory owners have all the\npower in the new industrial society? The answer was that the elites, known as capitalists or\nbourgeoisie, owned the means of production, which means the way in which wealth is\ngenerated in a society. For example, in preindustrial days, most all wealth came from farms;\ntherefore, those who owned the land (the royals and nobles) had all the power. In early\nindustrial societies, wealth was generated by factories and railroads; therefore, whoever\nowned those assets had the economic advantage. There are more workers (known as the\nproletariat) than factories and railroads, so the owners have the more valuable commod-\nities. Furthermore, said Marx and Engels, the owners use their advantageous situation to\nabuse the workers, giving them just enough to survive while maximizing their own prof-\nits. This situation, they claimed, was the reason for the squalor which Engels described in\nManchester.\nThe two political philosophers then elaborated on what they considered to be the\nsolution for the situation. It entailed a revolution in which the proletariat would seize the\nmeans of production from the bourgeoisie. The new state would now run all the means of\nproduction \u2013 the farms, railroads, factories, shipyards, coal mines, and so on \u2013 not for a\nprivate profit, but for the benefit of the proletariat. In other words, the proletariat owned\nthe means of production collectively, and the state administered them on the proletariat\u2019s\nbehalf. This collective ownership meant that everyone would be economically equal. In such\na country, everyone would have as much power and money as everyone else, so that no one\nwould have an advantage over anyone else, and would therefore not be able to abuse anyone\nelse. This form of socialism came to be known as Marxism or, in its Russian context, as\nBolshevism.\nHowever, the pair took their program a step further. A socialist nation, they said,\nshould educate its children in socialist ethics, specifically, the rejection of private gain and\nthe endorsement of the social good. New generations of socialists would therefore become\nincreasingly morally pure, doing less and less harm to their fellow citizens. Eventually, over\nyears, police would become unnecessary, because no one would want to break the law.\nEventually, they claimed, a government would no longer be necessary, because the people\nwould be capable of running everything themselves without the guidance of politicians.\nThis would lead to a utopian state of anarchy known as communism. The terms \u201csocialism\u201d\nand \u201ccommunism\u201d are often used interchangeably, but technically they are different forms\nof government. Communism refers to socialist anarchy, while in socialism there is still a\ngovernment, and one which is very involved in peoples\u2019 lives. There has never been a nation\nmatching Marx\u2019s definition of communism.\nMarx felt that socialism would begin in labor unions, because they represented cen-\nters of power for the proletariat. However, when the Russian Revolution actually created a\nMarxist state for the first time, Vladimir Lenin decided that Marxism needed modification\nin order to actually work. Marx believed that people would naturally do this themselves, or-\nganized mainly around labor unions, which he thought would be the centers of revolution.\nRussia, however, had very little industry and therefore little union organization. Therefore,\nLenin\u2019s first change was to create a vanguard party, a socialist political party which would\nlead the people to true communism. The USSR was a one-party state; although there were\nelections, only members of the Communist Party could run for office, so the party and the\ngovernment were virtually the same entity.\nFurthermore, Marx had advocated for worldwide revolution. Capitalist nations, he\nclaimed, would surely try to destroy any socialist nation, as the bourgeoisie would not allow\n7 the workers to be free. Socialism therefore required workers in every country in the world\nto rise up against capitalism. This messianic view of revolution terrified the capitalists, who\nviewed socialism as an aggressive philosophy which would, if it caught on, destroy all they\nhad built. Vladimir Lenin did not agree with this policy of worldwide socialist revolution.\nThe USSR was the only socialist country in the world at that time and was hardly in a posi-\ntion to fight the entire world. Therefore, Lenin instituted a policy of \u201csocialism in one coun-\ntry\u201d rather than attempt to free the entire world from capitalist exploitation. Josef Stalin, his\nsuccessor, continued this policy, as did all other Soviet premiers. That did not assuage the\ncapitalists, who always believed that the USSR was out to dominate the world. These two\nmodifications to Marxism \u2013 a vanguard party and socialism in one country -- created a new\nform of socialism known as Marxist-Leninism, which was the state ideology of the Soviet\nUnion.\nAnother socialist trait which nettled the capitalists was atheism. Marx and Engels\nwere materialists who rejected any concept of the supernatural and viewed religion and\nchurches as negative influences on mankind. Marx referred to religion as the \u201copiate of the\nmasses,\u201d a drug which keeps people focused on a better life to come after death. He con-\ntended that, if the numbing influence of religion was removed, people would be motivated\nby the pain of injustice to rise in revolt and end the true source of their pain, which was\ncapitalism. As one might imagine, most of 19th century Europe was appalled by such think-\ning, and the churches decried socialism as anti-Christ. Later, when they fought the USSR\nand other socialists, the fascists claimed they were fighting atheism, trying to leverage fear\nof godless communists.\nThat, then, is the Marxist critique of industrial society and the remedy it proposes.\nMarxism was instituted first in the Soviet Union, and later in other nations \u2013 for example,\nVietnam and Cuba. But Marxism was not the only possible response to laissez-faire capital-\nism and industrialization. Another way was possible.\nProgressivism\nProgressivism, in its 19th and early 20th century definition, was a liberal response\nto the m\u00e9lange of laissez-faire capitalism and the poor working conditions of industrializa-\ntion. Broadly defined, progressivism was the belief that it was possible to improve society\nthrough science and reason, the foundations of the Enlightenment. As a response to in-\ndustrialization, it meant government intervention in the economy and society in general to\nfight poverty and inequality, and thus create a better life for citizens. This would require the\ngovernment to regulate business. Karl Marx claimed that the bourgeoisie would never allow\nthis to happen, as they had most of the political power in a nation and would use it to pre-\nvent any usurpation of their power and wealth. He and Engels claimed that only revolution\nwould work.\nThe first national leader to attempt to change the laissez-faire system without de-\nstroying it was Otto von Bismarck, Chancellor of the newly-formed nation of Germany in\n1871. Bismarck was a conservative and as far from a socialist as one could get; nevertheless,\nhe realized that the socialists had a point. Laissez-faire living conditions were so difficult\nthat the socialists, who were the only ones promising anything to the workers, would even-\ntually win the struggle. That would destroy the capitalist nation that Bismarck was trying to\nbuild. And the socialists were a real threat in Germany, which was now going through rapid\nindustrialization.\nIn order to forestall a successful socialist revolt, Bismarck created legislation to im-\nprove workers\u2019 lives. This legislation created a system of health insurance (the cost of which\n8 Introduction was split between workers and employers), old-age pensions, and accident insurance. He\ndid not press for better working conditions in the factories, believing that it would slow\neconomic growth. Furthermore, rather than term these changes \u201csocialist,\u201d he referred to\nthem as \u201cpractical Christianity,\u201d connecting them to Christian charity rather than atheistic\nMarxism.\nIt worked. The socialists opposed the new legislation because it would eliminate\nthe socialists\u2019 influence, which it did. Bismarck had created the world\u2019s first \u201cwelfare state,\u201d\nthe first laissez-faire nation to modify the system to placate the workers and forestall revolt.\nThese progressive changes made the German worker more loyal to the state; in fact, German\nimmigration to America suddenly decreased, since workers perceived that life in Germany\nwas worth staying for.\nSuffering from the same malaise as Germany, other industrialized countries soon\nfollowed suit, creating welfare states to balance the power of the industrialists. This did not\nalways go smoothly \u2013 Bismarck had considerable difficulty in carrying out his plan, and\nother national leaders would have to fight hard against both conservatives and socialists to\nget legislation passed.\nOther nations took the welfare state even further once the concept had been proven.\nIn the United States, old-age pension and disability insurance became known as \u201csocial se-\ncurity,\u201d so named because it (at least partially) removed some of the paralyzing insecurity of\nmodern industrial life. But social legislation went much further over time. Remember that,\ndespite the power of the factory owners and other bourgeoisie, the industrializing nations\nwere mainly democracies. The workers in those nations could organize and elect politicians\nwho would support welfare legislation, although it sometimes took years to affect change in\nthe face of bourgeois resistance.\nThe biggest change to laissez-faire economics was the legalization of labor unions,\nallowing workers to organize and strike for better wages. Out of this came legislation im-\nproving working conditions: labor laws outlawing child labor or guaranteeing maternity\nleave, or granting weekends off and paid overtime. Later developments included worker\nsafety standards (called OSHA in the United States), food and drug safety laws, and an-\nti-monopoly regulations. Some of these changes took decades to enact; for example, laws\nagainst discriminatory hiring practices were not passed in the United States until 1964.\nNevertheless, outside the communist world, progressivism would sweep every industrializ-\ning nation. Today, these is not a single laissez-faire nation left in the world.\nBut progressivism went beyond economic considerations. New legislation also ex-\npanded democracy to all adults to build more loyal citizens who would reject socialism.\nOne by one, industrializing nations removed voting restrictions based on religion or social\nstatus, and eventually permitted women to vote, the single greatest democratic leap since\nthe French and American revolutions.\nAnother major change was compulsory education. Although children worked in\nfactories and mines at the start of the industrial revolutions, all industrialized nations even-\ntually passed child labor laws to protect children from the exploitation of long work days\nand dangerous work conditions. Mandatory schooling by day not only gave children a safe\nenvironment while their parents worked during the day, but also gave them the chance to\nobtain an education, something that was typically reserved for wealthier families in the past.\nAllowing all children to receive an education is a great social equalizer, giving lower-class\nchildren the opportunity to compete for higher-class jobs and incomes. Compulsory edu-\ncation was not universally popular at first, as the wealthy decried it as a waste of taxpayer\nmoney to try to educate the lower classes, and some poor families rejected the demand\nthat their children stop making an income for their families. Nevertheless, compulsory ed-\nucation was eventually accepted in all industrial societies, and governments found them a\n9 useful space for indoctrinating young citizens in nationalism.\nSocial and economic progressivism were based on changing government policies in\norder to provoke change, and did indeed create tremendous changes in industrialized society.\nThese changes are generally felt to have created stronger nations, since citizens felt that the\nnation was more apt to look after their best interests; they also reduced crime and distributed\nwealth more evenly though society. But other less-controlled forces were sweeping industrialized\ncultures at the same time, and their influences were as profound as progressive forces.\nSecularism (a philosophy of basing human conduct on non-religious foundations)\ngained in popularity in the 20th century in most industrializing nations. Removing religion from\npolitics was a growing force since the Age of Enlightenment, primarily because it prevented the\nreligious warfare which had so devasted Europe. Early public schools were technically secular,\nalthough deeply influenced by religious thought; they became increasingly secular over time,\nmeaning that younger generations were less influenced by religious thinking, at least at school.\nAt the same time, consumerism was growing as a social influence. Industrialization made it\neasier for lower classes buy the various commodities flowing from the factories: cars, appliances,\nhome d\u00e9cor, clothes, and so on. But sales depend on buyers, and buyers need to be convinced\nto spend their money. Thus, modern advertising was born, filling the pages of newspapers or\nbroadcast over the new device of the radio. It seemed to do as designed: people became increas-\ningly interested in acquiring material things, and it seemed to some that consumerism was re-\nplacing religion as the nation\u2019s guiding light.\nThere was good reason for this change of loyalty. While prayer did not seem to stop\ndisease, medical science could. The developments in medicine in the late 19th and 20th centu-\nries seemed to deliver miracles. The three most important contributions were antibiotics, vac-\ncination, and the purification of drinking water, all the results of germ theory, which became\nclarified in the 1890s. Many diseases were now curable or, more importantly, preventable. The\ngovernment became deeply involved in a trend known as public health, building hospitals and\nfunding research and vaccination programs. Human lifespans lengthened and people placed\nmore faith in the new sciences.\nWhile progressive developments were generally felt to be positive, not everyone appreci-\nated them, especially when it came to the children. Compulsory education profoundly changed\nthe traditional family. While education opened the door to new careers and economic oppor-\ntunity, it also split up the family during the day. While parents worked, children were being\neducated by adults other than their parents, and spending their time primarily with other chil-\ndren. This was part of what created what is known as youth culture, the idea that children have\ntheir own subculture, apart from their parents. This may manifest in their clothing or hair styles,\ntheir music and literature and slang, and most importantly their attitudes towards the world.\nAdvertisers were quick to exploit this new youth market, aiming products directly at their demo-\ngraphic. These differences created a gap between parents and children known as the generation\ngap, where children were living in a different mental and social world from their parents. Many\ntraditionalists, already disturbed by secularism and the decline of patriarchy, decried the new\nlack of control over their own children.\nOther traditionalists had similar misgivings about other social changes: the new po-\nlitical and economic empowerment of women, the right to vote granted to \u201clower classes\u201d or\nethnic minorities, and the general instability of democracy. While progressivism had stabilized\neconomics to some degree, democracy seemed to be upending them, allowing new social voices\ninto the public sphere. Feminists, union leaders, socialists, atheists, and others who were tradi-\ntionally suppressed were allowed a social space and the subsequent influence. This angered many\nconservatives, who pushed for a return to \u201cthe old days,\u201d even if it meant the degradation of\ndemocracy. This would lead to the rise of fascism in certain places (see Chapter 1).\nIn most industrializing nations, progressivism won the battle against socialism, creating\nmore equitable societies within the context of capitalist societies, though not without a great\n10 Introduction deal of political and social turmoil in the process. Socialist political parties survived in\nthese nations, constantly agitating for greater equality if not for revolution; they provided\na necessary counterbalance against laissez-faire capitalism, providing the motivation for\ngovernments to enact progressive legislation to counter the threat, as Bismarck had done in\nGermany.\nBy the early 20th century, the standard of living in industrial societies was increas-\ning and promised to rise even more in the future. Europe was experiencing an unusually\nlong period of peace, without a major war since 1871. Medicine was defeating age-old\nscourges such as smallpox. Unless one lived in a colony, the future tended to look bright.\nWorld War I damaged that optimistic view. The politics and technology that had\nbrought unprecedented peace and prosperity suddenly turned to war. Within four years,\nbetween 15 and 22 million people had died, with a similar number wounded. The war\u2019s\ncausalities shocked national leaders, who had not expected such a disastrous slaughter.\nThe long-term human cost of the war can hardly be calculated; for example, half a mil-\nlion French children grew up as orphans, having lost fathers to the war. Millions suffered\nfrom trauma, known at the time as \u201cshell shock\u201d (now referred to as Post-Traumatic Stress\nDisorder, or PTSD), for which there was no treatment at the time. People now questioned\nthe ardent nationalism which had built such strong countries, but which they now blamed\nfor the war. Religious belief waned as people questioned why God would allow such a trag-\nedy to occur, a common response after great catastrophes. Although not universal, a wave\nof disillusionment and nihilism swept the West, with those who had suffered in the war\nknown as the \u201cLost Generation\u201d who had lost faith in traditional culture.\nImproving industrial techniques and capacity led to increasing consumerism in\nboth East and West after the war. Women\u2019s participation in the war, both as nurses and\nfactory workers, gave women a new sense of importance and pride, since they had helped\ndefend the nation. These changes allowed for a new role for women, known as the \u201cNew\nWoman\u201d who was employed, sexually active, socially-engaged, and freed from traditional\nnorms. New medias, such as cinema, helped solidify new norms. This was yet another ex-\nample of social change disrupting traditional norms and nettling conservatives.\nWestern economies expanded in the 1920s, but the wealth was largely illusionary;\nstock markets were based on excessive speculation instead of actual economic health. The\nworld economy was increasingly globalized, so that any disruption would affect almost the\nentire world \u2013 which is exactly what happened in October of 1929. A stock market crash\nin the United States precipitated the Great Depression, the greatest economic collapse in\nhistory. The entire world economy plummeted, further encouraged by a poor response of\neconomic protectionism. Personal savings disappeared as banks failed. Millions of people\nfell into unemployment and poverty, losing their homes. Factories closed. World War I had\ncreated mistrust in nationalism and technology; now, faith in capitalism was failing, and\nsocialists quickly moved to capitalize on its failure.\nThere were several responses possible to this worldwide malaise. One was to remain\ncommitted to democracy and progressivism. This was the course of most of the West, in-\ncluding the United States. President Franklin D. Roosevelt launched an economic recovery\nprogram known as the New Deal, which was responsible for most of the progressive pol-\nicies in the United States; only the desperation of the Depression could allow the passage\nof such progressive legislation in economically-conservative America. However, in some\nnations \u2013 Germany, Italy, and Japan \u2013 the response to the Great Depression was to abandon\ndemocracy for a more extreme form of government known as fascism. This move set up the\nnext major event in world history, World War II, which is where this textbook takes up the\nnarrative.\nThe second half of the 20th century was nearly as tumultuous as the first. The Cold\nWar between the democratic and socialist worlds threatened nuclear annihilation. The last\n11 remaining empires collapsed, more than doubling the number of independent countries\nin the world, each with its own local drama. A new international human rights paradigm\ndisrupted traditional relationships, and rapid technological change disrupted social norms\nin unforeseen ways. The rate of change was rapidly increasing, and many people found it\ndifficult to keep their feet on the ground. There seemed to be no area of life which remained\nthe same; dependent on their social position, some welcomed the changes, while others\nresisted them.\nSo, how do we sum up the 20th century? This time was so varied, so tumultuous,\nthat one could reach many different conclusions. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Delpech penned a book on this\nperiod, and its similarities to our own, and titled it Savage Century: Back to Barbarism.\nHistorian Mark Mazower published a book on 20th century Europe and, in honor of the\ntwo world wars, named it Dark Continent. Steven Pinker takes the opposite view, claiming\nthat we are now living in the least violent time in history, and that the 20th century was\nmerely an anomaly; his book is called The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has\nDeclined. Famed historian Eric Hobsbawm wrote of the 20th century in a book titled The\nAge of Extremes, pointing to the rapidly-changing nature of this tumultuous time.\nWhich one of them is right? This book will help the reader come to their own conclusion.\nChild labor in the United States before Progressivism.\n12 Introduction For the Instructor\nThis textbook is meant for college survey classes in World History form 1945 to the present. Each chapter is approximately\n30 pages in length; the intended rate is one chapter per week, so all salient points of postwar world history will be covered in\na fifteen-week semester.\nThe book also contains two chapters (4 and 8) which are considered \u201cSpecial Topics.\u201d These chapters contain more\nin-depth information on Colonization and Decolonization, and the civil rights movement in both the US and South Africa.\nThese chapters, while informative, can be skipped without losing major historical subjects, as their contents are summarized\nin other chapters. The main purpose of the Special Topics chapters is to allow for some expansion in the textbook in the\nfuture. Recent History textbooks have the disadvantage of requiring editing as the present becomes the recent past. It is not\nsimply a problem of adding chapters, as the textbook would quickly go beyond 30 pages of reading per week; instead, exist-\ning chapters need to be entirely edited to shorten them, therefore allowing new material to be added without lengthening\nthe chapters.\nThe Special Topic chapters work around this complex problem. In the future, new chapters will be added to bring\nthe textbook up to date; at that time, an instructor could skip the Special Topics chapters and use the new chapters instead\nwithout adding or subtracting to the numbers of pages to be read during the semester.\nEach chapter is designed to give a basic overview of the postwar historical narrative of a country or region and\nserves as the foundation for a more in-depth classroom lecture on the topics. It is hoped that the primary source documents\nincluded with each chapter will facilitate these lectures.\nDr. David Bassano\nBrookdale Community College\nJanuary, 2023\nGlossary\nBolshevism: revolutionary Marxist-Leninism in Russia.\nBourgeoisie: Marx\u2019s term for social elites who own the means of production in a country.\nCitizen: a member of a nation, considered to be a co-owner of the nation with all other citizens,\nCommunism: The theoretical state of utopian anarchy after many generations of socialism, when a government\nis no longer required.

Over 100 million combatants fought in the war, and between\n50 and 85 million people, mainly civilians, lost their lives. The war changed modern society\nfar beyond the rearrangement of national borders; it demoted Western Europe, the premier\nworld power since the 16th century, to second place after the rise of the two postwar\nsuperpowers. The imperial colonies would gain their independence, international relations\nwere permanently altered, and new technologies developed during the war would change\ndaily life.\nThis chapter will examine the causes of World War II, its progress and outcome, and the\nconsequences of history\u2019s greatest conflict.\n16 Chapter 1: World War II and the Aftermath The Rise of Fascism\nAs we saw in the Introduction, the 17th and 18th centuries brought tremendous\nchanges to human society. The development and spread of democracy in Europe and the\nAmericas remade the relationship between citizen and state. Democracy not only spread\ngeographically, but also widened to extend rights to more people; this manifested, for exam-\nple, as the abolition of slavery and the global women\u2019s rights movement. Industrialization\nremade not just economies, but the very foundation of workers\u2019 lives, changing how they\nrelated to each other and their families. Clearly, the implications of industrialization were\nprofound.\nThese changes caused unprecedented social upheaval. While democracy brought\nincreasing freedom to the common man, some opposed it; for example, nobles and royals\nmight not want to lose their privileged hereditary positions, and racists might despise the\nidea of extending equality to ethnic minorities, while many others opposed the idea of\nwomen\u2019s rights. Such people wanted empowerment for themselves, but not for others.\nEconomic changes caused even more turmoil. In the early days of industrializa-\ntion, capitalism was almost entirely unregulated. There was no minimum wage, no unem-\nployment insurance, no old-age pensions, no safety standards, and no anti-discrimination\nlaws. New agricultural machinery, like tractors and harvesters, replaced farm workers, who\nflooded into the cities in search of jobs. Workers were forced to live in unregulated tene-\nments (cheap apartments), often without ventilation or running water. All these intolerable\nconditions led to the Progressive and Socialist movements, which tried to provide economic\nrelief to workers (see the Introduction for a more thorough explanation).\nThis tension was magnified in the opening decades of the 20th century. The First\nWorld War defeated and destroyed old empires, but not without angering the losers, whose\ndesire for revenge simmered. The Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and founding of the\nUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) as the world\u2019s first socialist nation seemed to\nconfirm the worst revolutionary fears of elites. And then the Great Depression, beginning\nin 1929, devastated the global economy, resulting in worldwide poverty and suffering. These\ncatastrophes served only to increase social pressures.\nIn the 1930s, a political movement in several nations sought to address these ten-\nsions: fascism. Adherents of fascism wanted a return to the \u201cglory days\u201d of the past, when\ntheir nation was noble, stable, and powerful, even if this vision of the nation\u2019s past was more\nmythological than historical. Fascists believed that their nation had become degraded be-\ncause it had moved away from tradition. Democracy had allowed new voices onto the social\nstage, voices such as feminists, socialists, homosexuals, the labor unions, ethnic minorities,\nand so on. Fascists believed that these \u201cnontraditional\u201d people, these outsiders, had led the\ncountry astray, away from the traditional path. Fascists embraced victimization, the belief\nthat one\u2019s group or nation is under attack by groups seeking its destruction; and typically,\nin this view, it is the outsiders who are the guilty parties. Fascism, therefore, seeks to restore\nthe nation to health by removing the new social voices and returning to tradition.\nIt is notoriously difficult to define fascist ideology, because the theory and exe-\ncution varied so much from one nation to the next. However, all forms of fascism share\nseveral common traits. Fascism is reactionary \u2013 that is, it is a response to social changes,\nand aims to stop and reverse those changes. In that sense, it is the opposite of progressivism.\nAlso, fascism is a form of right-wing socialism, because it proclaims that the needs of the\nsociety outweigh the desires of the individual. However, the society that fascism upholds is\nnot based on economic class, as in Marxism; it is based instead on nationalism, the belief\nthat one\u2019s own nation is superior to others. In fascism, the individual must abandon his\nown desires and instead serve the nation. The extreme nationalism of fascism also dovetails\nwith racism, since the nation under fascism is thought to be based on ethnicity even more\n17 than geography. Fascism is also always authoritarian. It views democracy as a failure re-\nsponsible for the chaos in society, and seeks to bring every aspect of human society under\nthe total control of the state. And fascism is unrepentantly militarist; its adherents believe\nin the energizing power of war, not just to defend or even expand the nation, but also to\nkeep the society virulent, preventing it from falling into decadence and, thus, destruction\nfrom within. This aggression is excused through victimization, believing that all the nation\u2019s\nills are due to nontraditional outsiders who seek to destroy the country from within. Once\none accepts this theory, then violence against \u201cnontraditional\u201d groups is a logical next step.\nTherefore, fascists wanted to bring their nation under total control, unified under their own\nsocial vision, allowing no other voices to interfere. They could then eliminate the \u201cdegener-\nAdolf Hitler\nate\u201d forces within the nation and return it to its former glory.\nAs with Marxism, fascism was based on older social theories. Benito Mussolini,\nan Italian army veteran of WWI, coined the term \u201cfascism\u201d in 1919 to describe his political\nideas. Mussolini began in Milan, in northern Italy, and brought together anti-communists,\nsuch as business leaders and large landowners. These economic elites feared a communist\nrevolution in Italy, a repeat of the recent Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. Mussolini\u2019s fol-\nlowers formed into street-fighting bands known as Blackshirts to attack local communist\nleaders. From the very beginning, the fascists relied on violence and intimidation. Through\norganizing and repressing other political parties, the fascists\u2019 strength grew.\nIn October 1922, Mussolini was ready to strike. After announcing, \u201cEither the gov-\nernment will be given to us, or we will seize it by marching on Rome,\u201d Mussolini and his\nBlackshirts did in fact march to Rome by the tens of thousands. The parliament of Italy\nJoseph Stalin\nresigned in fear. The king of Italy, Victor Emmanuel, was forced to form a new government\nand, to pacify the fascists, made Mussolini the prime minister of Italy. (Incidentally, this\nerror of trying to placate fascists with concessions would be repeated several times in the\n1930s. It never worked for long.)\nTwo years later, in 1924, Mussolini called for new parliamentary elections which\nwould include his own Fascist Party as well as a smaller, allied fascist party. The election was\nmarred by fraud and voter intimidation by the fascists, who won 66 percent of the vote.\nNow in full control of the national government, the fascists moved quickly to con-\nsolidate all political and social power into their own hands. Mussolini abolished all political\nparties except his own, outlawed labor unions and strikes, and took total control of educa-\ntion, turning it into a propaganda outlet for his party. He formed his own secret police to\neliminate political enemies. His party controlled the economy, both capital and labor alike,\nBenito Mussolini\nalthough his policies tended to benefit the wealthy. Nevertheless, Mussolini\u2019s policies did\nreduce unemployment during the Great Depression, increasing his popularity. Eventually,\nthe fascists neutralized even the mighty Catholic Church; Mussolini made concessions to\nthe church with anti-abortion and anti-divorce legislation, and in return, the church re-\nmained aloof from politics. By 1925, Mussolini was effectively a dictator, referring to him-\nself as Il Duce (the Leader).\nHaving gained complete control of Italy, Mussolini took the next step in his plan for\nglory: military conquest. He dreamed of creating an Italian empire in the image of Imperial\nRome. To him, doing so would restore Italy to its former (and proper) glory, prove the cor-\nrectness of fascism, and fashion himself into an imperial emperor.\nMussolini began with Ethiopia in Africa, the nation which in 1896 had successfully\nHideki Tojo resisted an Italian invasion. In 1935, Mussolini again attacked, this time successfully thanks\nto improved military technology. Mussolini also sought reproachment with Germany,\nagainst which Italy had fought in WWI, and even made a pact with Germany (the \u201cPact of\nSteel\u201d) in 1939, asserting that each nation would help the other in time of war.\n18 Chapter 1: World War II and the Aftermath Proto-fascist philosophies were not unknown in Germany, either. Many of these\nright-wing, ultranationalist theories were espoused by the National Socialist German\nWorkers\u2019 Party (NSDAP), later more colloquially known outside Germany as the Nazi Party.\n(Again, note that this socialism is not the same as Marxism, which the Nazis despised).\nAdolf Hitler, a veteran of WWI, was a military intelligence agent in 1919, and was assigned\nthe mission of infiltrating the NSDAP, since it was regarded as an extremist and potentially\ndangerous organization. Hitler found that he appreciated the organization\u2019s racist ultrana-\ntionalism. He became a very useful member due to his newly-discovered talent for public\nspeaking. He became a true believer, and was so important in the party that, by 1921, he was\nits leader, a role he would hold until his death.\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt\nHitler\u2019s philosophy differed from Mussolini\u2019s in that he placed much more empha-\nsis on race and ethnicity than his Italian counterpart. Hitler\u2019s racial theories drove both his\ndomestic and foreign policies. To Hitler, all of Germany\u2019s troubles were due to the Jews,\nwhom he claimed were working in coordination with communists and foreign enemies, like\nthe British and French, to suppress the German people. From the very beginning, Hitler\nintended to disenfranchise German Jews and empower pure-blooded \u201cAryan\u201d Germans.\nAntisemitism and anti-communism were already strong in Germany, so Hitler\u2019s message\nfound a wide audience. But Hitler did not want to just expel \u201cNon-Aryans\u201d from Germany.\nThe Treaty of Versailles, which stipulated the peace terms ending World War I, separated\ncertain regions of ethnically-German people from Germany itself: Austria (becoming an\nindependent republic in 1919), the Sudetenland (going to Czechoslovakia), and the prov-\ninces of Posen and West Prussia (going to Poland). Hitler wanted to bring those territories\nWinston Churchill\nback into the nation, thus achieving German unity under a single state. Furthermore, Hitler\ndreamed of conquering vast territories in Eastern Europe, mainly in Russia, expelling or\nkilling the \u201cethnically-inferior\u201d Slavic people living there, and giving the land to the German\npeople. This policy was called Drang nach Osten (Drive to the East), and Hitler was very\nserious about accomplishing it. All these steps would culminate in the establishment of the\nThird Reich (Third German Empire), which Hitler claimed would last for a thousand years.\nCarving up German land was not the Nazis\u2019 only complaint with their former en-\nemies. A popular myth in Germany, especially among veterans of World War I, such as\nHitler himself, was that Germany\u2019s defeat in the war was not due to any failure of the army.\nThey instead blamed the surrender on disloyal elements within Germany itself, particularly\nJews and socialists. Once they had purged the \u201ctraitors\u201d from Germany, the Nazis planned\nto remove the shame of the surrender. Many Germans viewed the Treaty of Versailles as\nChiang Kai-Shek\nvery unfair towards Germany. First, Germans were made to shoulder all the blame for the\nwar, and therefore required to pay huge reparations to France, payments which the stricken\nnation could not afford. The allies also demanded that Germany demilitarize the Rhineland\nregion, so that German troops would not be adjacent to France. Furthermore, Germany was\nnot permitted to possess any aircraft or tanks, and very few warships. As these restrictions\nwere so odious to many Germans, the Nazi plan to renounce the Treaty of Versailles earned\nthem considerable popularity.\nInfluenced by Mussolini\u2019s success in Italy, Hitler attempted a coup in 1923 (the\n\u201cBeer Hall Putsch\u201d), which failed, leading to Hitler\u2019s arrest and imprisonment. It was during\nhis prison term that he wrote his autobiography, Mein Kampf (My Struggle). But such was\nHitler\u2019s popularity and influence that he served only nine months in prison.\nThe Nazi Party\u2019s power and influence grew dramatically after 1930, when the\nGreat Depression gutted the German economy and drove the people to desperation. The\nNazi Party blamed the Depression on Jews and communists, a claim which resonated in\nGermany at the time. By 1932, the Nazi party controlled nearly a third of the seats in the\nReichstag (parliament), making it the single largest faction in the government. Although\n19 German President Hindenburg despised Hitler, the Nazis\u2019 political position compelled him\nto appoint Hitler to serve as Chancellor of Germany.\nOnce he was Chancellor, Hitler moved quickly to consolidate power. Four weeks\nafter his appointment, a fire broke out in the Reichstag building in Berlin. Hitler blamed\nthe fire on communists and claimed that this terrorism was the start of a political coup. He\ndemanded that the Reichstag grant him emergency powers to fight the uprising \u2013 powers\nwhich would suspend the constitution and give Hitler broad, though not total, political\npower. The Reichstag voted to grant Hitler this power for four years, and the Nazis quickly\nleveraged their new position. Hitler outlawed all other political parties and abolished the\npowers of the states\u2019 governments. When President Hindenburg died the next year, Hitler\ncombined the roles of Chancellor and President into one position, making him the Head of\nState. He did so with the approval of the majority of Germans. Hitler\u2019s ambitions, previously\nlaughed at by so many, were finally realized. The Nazis followed this with a series of sup-\npressions and persecutions of Jews, homosexuals, Romani, and other political and ethnic\nenemies, killing thousands in the process.\nAlthough the Japanese did not refer to the ultranationalism that led them into\nWorld War II as fascism, it was remarkably similar to the ideologies of German and Italian\nfascists. Prior to 1868, Japan was a closed country, almost completely isolated from the\nworld; although the emperor was the nominal ruler, the shogun (a samurai warlord) exer-\ncised actual power through a feudal system of lords.\nBy the 19th century, however, Western powers seemed to threaten Japan. Great\nBritain had conquered India, Burma, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia; the French had\ntaken Indochina, and the Dutch had captured Indonesia. Although Western empires could\nnot conquer all of China, they regularly humiliated the Chinese in incidents such as the\nOpium Wars. American Commodore Matthew Perry had visited Japan with warships in\n1853 and forced a trade treaty upon the country at gunpoint. All of this convinced certain\nJapanese leaders that the West would someday attack or extort Japan, and that the sho-\ngun\u2019s feudal government was not strong enough to repel them. Therefore, they decided that\ntheir country needed a new government, one that would transform Japan into a powerful,\nmodern nation.\nIn 1868, these modernizing lords launched the Meiji Restoration, a coup which\nplanned to place the young emperor Meiji, who was sympathetic to the modernizers, back\nin executive power of Japan. Since the emperor was considered to be descended from the\nsun god, the shogun could not directly oppose the emperor without losing the support of\nthe Japanese people, and so surrendered his position. The samurai families, who were a priv-\nileged military class in Japan, were stripped of their power. This spawned a series of revolts\nby traditional, disaffected samurai. The national army, however, had quickly modernized\nalong European designs, and managed to defeat the samurai revolts. In the meantime, the\nflood of modern, Western ideas into Japan included the concepts of democracy and human\nrights, and the Japanese people now demanded a constitutional, representative government.\nTherefore, a constitution and Diet (parliament) were established in 1889. It seemed that\nJapan had become a modern nation in every way, in an astonishingly short time.\nThe Meiji Constitution, however, contained some critical errors in terms of democ-\nracy. First, the emperor was granted a lofty position, \u201csacred and inviolable,\u201d according to\nArticle 3. The Army and Navy also held veto power in the formation of government cabi-\nnets, a direct intervention of the military into civilian politics. These provisions weakened\nJapanese democracy and eventually allowed for the rise of military rule.\nThe Japanese had modernized their industry and military with astonishing speed.\nJapan\u2019s new military conquered Taiwan and Korea; then, in 1905, Japan defeated Russia to\nseize Port Arthur in China, the first time in modern history an Asian power defeated a\nWestern one.\n20 Chapter 1: World War II and the Aftermath During the 1920s, ultranationalists, particularly in the military, initiated a plan to\nseize control of the civilian government, which they considered (not without reason) to be\ncorrupt and ineffective; they wanted a return to the days of military rule and to launch an\nambitious military campaign to purge the Far East of Western influence and make Japan the\nsupreme power in Asia. Secret anti-democratic societies within the military assassinated\ncivilian leaders and even launched unsuccessful coups in the early 1930s. By 1940, ultrana-\ntionalists, through coordinated violence and political maneuvering, had gained complete\ncontrol of the government. By the time Japan attacked the United States, its military no\nlonger answered to civilian control but only to the emperor. Emperor Hirohito was at first\nresistant to fascism, and put down the various illegal attempts to seize power; but once the\nmilitary had control of the government, he seemed to surrender to them and allowed them\nto carry out their campaigns.\nThe Early War Years\nWorld War II did not begin all at once and, depending on where you are from, you\ncould place the outbreak at different times. Eight years of fighting and negotiation preceded\nthe main theatres of the war, with all sides struggling to either prevent a general war or to\ngain an advantage before full-scale conflict began.\nAfter their military success in the Russo-Japanese war, militant Japanese leaders\nsought to fulfill their expansionist dreams. Their long-term goal was to end the Western\ndominance of China and monopolize that nation\u2019s raw materials and markets; they claimed\nthat Japan would liberate Asia from the domineering Western empires, but Japan\u2019s brutal\nbehavior towards conquered Asians revealed more imperial motivations. Japanese leaders\nchose to move north to secure the raw materials they would need to conquer all of China. In\n1931, without informing their government, Japanese forces in their colony of Korea invaded\nManchuria, a northeastern province of China, and turned it into a puppet state.\nThis proved a critical moment. After the First World War, the Treaty of Versailles\nestablished the League of Nations, an international organization to prevent future wars, an\nearly form of the United Nations. The strength of the League was collective security. The\nagreement was that, should any nation invade another without due cause, all the other na-\ntions of the League would contribute troops to a powerful international force, which would\nstop the aggressor. Since no nation was as powerful as all the other nations combined, no\nnation would dare to defy the League and launch a war.\nThe League condemned the invasion of Manchuria, but the members of the League\ndeclined to enforce its decrees with force. Although collective security looked good on\npaper, the member nations were unwilling to make the necessary sacrifices on the battle-\nfield to enforce it. It is widely believed that the League\u2019s failure to punish Japan was the\nJapanese troops in Manchuria, Nov. 1931\n21 green light for the fascists, indicating to them that the world would not stop them in their\nmarch for conquest.\nItaly began its imperial expansion in 1936 when it invaded Ethiopia. Mussolini\u2019s\nplans were not based on such a clear ideology as Hitler\u2019s; his plan was simply to conquer\nall the lands surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, as the Roman Empire had once done.\nWhen Ethiopia asked the League of Nations to activate collective security, the League again\ndemurred, offering only ineffective sanctions against Italy. In his speech to the League,\nEthiopian Emperor Haile Selassie made the chilling prophecy, \u201cIt is us today. It will be you\ntomorrow.\u201d\nThe Nazis had no intention of confining their conquest to Germany; much of their\nappeal to the German people was their promise to settle old scores with other nations.\nHowever, since Germany had been defanged by the Treaty of Versailles and weakened by the\nGreat Depression, Hitler had to first rearm Germany before contemplating foreign adven-\ntures. In 1936, he marched his troops back into the Rhineland, and began a massive military\nrearmament program, both of which were in direct violation of the Treaty of Versailles.\nBritain and France, both keen to avoid another war, did not attempt to stop him.\nIn 1936, political tensions in Spain exploded after a major left-wing electoral victo-\nry convinced the right that a communist government would soon be installed. Right-wing\ngeneral Francisco Franco led a military revolt against the government. Germany and Italy\nsent aid to his Nationalists, and the USSR supported the leftist Republican government.\nThousands of international volunteers flooded into the country and fought on both sides.\nThe Nationalists proved victorious in 1939, and Spain remained a right-wing dictatorship\nuntil 1975. The Spanish Civil War is widely regarded as a \u201cdress rehearsal\u201d for World War\nII, with Germany, Italy, and the USSR testing new weapons and tactics in the war.\nJapan took the fateful step of reopening their war with the Republic of China in\n1937, this time with the intention of conquering the entire country. The well-disciplined\nJapanese Army made deep inroads, capturing Beijing, Shanghai, and the capital, Nanjing.\nDespite terrible casualties, the Chinese forces, under the leadership of Chiang Kai-Shek,\nrefused to surrender, and simply retreated farther into the vast interior of China and fought\non, now with material support from the USSR, which feared Japanese expansion in Asia.\nA nearly-forgotten border conflict between Japan and the USSR in 1939 proved to\nbe one of the most fateful conflicts of the 1930s. The two nations disagreed on the border\nbetween Manchukuo, the Japanese puppet state in northeastern China, and Mongolia, a\nSoviet client state. In 1939, the Japanese crossed into Mongolia with the intention of driv-\ning Soviet forces from the area (as with so many Japanese military campaigns, they had no\npermission from the government to conduct this attack). Joseph Stalin, leader of the USSR,\ndecided to make an impression on the Japanese and sent a powerful force to repel them. The\nJapanese were pushed back, and a ceasefire was arranged.\nAlthough no one could have known it at the time, it was one of the most important\nbattles of the century. The Japanese badly needed oil to continue their war in China, since\nmodern warfare requires vast quantities of fuel to power vehicles. Having no oil reserves of\nits own, Japan was purchasing American oil. But when the US embargoed Japan in 1941 to\nstop their conquest of China, Japanese leaders realized that they had to either find another\nsource of oil, or else abandon their military plans in China. They first planned to invade\nSiberia in the USSR to capture the oil there, a plan which would look especially attractive\nafter the German invasion of the USSR in June 1941. However, recalling the defeat they suf-\nfered at Soviet hands in Mongolia in 1939, Japanese military leaders decided that invading\nthe USSR was too dangerous. Therefore, they planned instead to attack the weaker British\nand Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia to secure the oil of the region. The only problem with\nthis plan was that the US Navy would come to the aid of America\u2019s European allies and\n22 Chapter 1: World War II and the Aftermath disrupt Japanese plans. Japan therefore planned to strike the American fleet at Pearl Harbor\nto eliminate the threat \u2013 a move which brought the US into the war on the side of the allies\nand ultimately led to Japan\u2019s defeat.\nIn Europe, the Nazis took another step towards the establishment of their Reich\nwith the Anschluss (\u201cUnity\u201d) of Austria in 1938. Hitler demanded that Austria, his home\ncountry, reunite with Germany. Rather than let the Austrian people decide the issue in a\nvote, Hitler ordered the German Army to occupy the country. The Austrian government,\ncowed by the Nazis, did not resist. Once in power, the Nazis conducted the same ethnic\npersecutions which they had carried out in Germany.\nHitler immediately followed this by threatening war with Czechoslovakia, a country\nwhose northern border region was home to millions of ethnic Germans. Hitler demanded\nthat this region, the Sudetenland, be given to Germany, or else Germany would take it by force.\nThe Czechs had a defensive alliance with France, so if Germany invaded Czechoslovakia,\nFrance would have to fight as well, and would certainly ask the British to assist them, since\nGermany would be violating the Treaty of Versailles which both countries had signed.\nNeither France nor Britain favored a war; at the Munich Conference of September 1938,\nFrance and Great Britain agreed that they would not fight over the Sudetenland, provided\nthat Hitler respected the territorial integrity of the rest of Czechoslovakia. Hitler agreed.\nThe Czech government realized it could not fight Germany single-handedly and so, feeling\nbetrayed, relinquished the Sudetenland. Great Britain and France celebrated, thinking that,\nby abandoning their Czech allies, they had avoided war. The next year, Germany, through\ninvasion and intimidation, conquered the rest of Czechoslovakia in direct violation of the\nMunich Agreement. This convinced many in Europe and the United States that there was\nno way to negotiate with the fascists.\nAn American propaganda poster showing the extent of the Lend-Lease Program\n23 The trigger for global conflict was the joint German \u2013 Soviet invasion of Poland in\nSeptember 1939. Hitler claimed territory in Poland, and had shown no hesitation in using\nthreat or force in previous territorial claims. France and Great Britain concluded a pact with\nPoland in 1939, requiring the Western nations to assist Poland if it was attacked. The USSR,\nfor its part, was fearful of invasion from the capitalist West. Stalin first tried to establish a\ndefensive alliance with France, Great Britain, and Poland, but that fell through due to Polish\ndistrust of the Soviets. Clearly, fear and paranoia were in the air in 1939.\nRejected by the allies, Stalin then concluded the secret Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, in\nwhich Germany and the USSR promised not to attack each other, and which would divide\nPoland between Germany and the Soviets. Although no love was lost between the two na-\ntions, it benefitted them both in the moment. The pact aided Germany by removing the\nUSSR from the Polish equation, as Hitler was already expecting war with France and Great\nBritain; the Soviets bought themselves time to prepare for war with Germany, as well as\nmore than half of Poland, which would serve as a buffer zone between their country and the\nNazis.\nDespite French and British threats of war, Germany invaded Poland from the west\non September 1, 1939, and the USSR attacked from the east on the 17th. France and Great\nBritain, true to their alliance, declared war on Germany. Poland fell to the invaders before\nits allies could amass their troops for battle; but now, all of Europe was embroiled in the war\nthat the allies had striven so hard to avoid. Soon, most of the of the world would follow.\nProgress of the War\nAfter Poland\u2019s defeat, Hitler wanted to immediately invade France, which had\nalready declared war; however, bad weather compelled the Germans to wait for spring to\nattack. France and Great Britain began a naval blockade of Germany, aimed at cutting the\nNazis off from foreign trade. In retaliation, Germany began unrestricted submarine warfare\nagainst the allies, which would destroy both civilian and military shipping.\nIn the meantime, the USSR threatened war with the Baltic nations of Latvia,\nLithuania, and Estonia, unless they accepted Soviet troops in their territory. Stalin was\ntrying to use these nations as another buffer between himself and the Nazis. All three na-\ntions submitted, but Finland rejected a similar threat, so the USSR invaded it in November\n1939. Soviet performance in this \u201cWinter War\u201d was unimpressive, and they gained only\nsmall territorial concessions from the Finns when the war ended in March 1940.\nIn April 1940, Germany invaded both Denmark and Norway, since control of these\ncountries would help Germany protect the shipping lanes between Germany and neutral\nSweden from the allied navies, and Germany was importing iron ore from Sweden. The\nfailure of Great Britain to contain the Nazis forced the resignation of British Prime Minister\nNeville Chamberlain, who was replaced by Winston Churchill on May 10, 1940 \u2013 the\nsame day that German troops finally attacked France.\nFrance had constructed a line of fortifications, known as the Maginot Line,\nalong their border with Germany and trusted that the defenses would repel the Nazis. The\nGermans simply went around the fortifications by invading neutral Belgium, Netherlands,\nand Luxembourg, then turning south and invading France where it was largely undefended.\nThe new Germany strategy of blitzkrieg (Lightning War), which relied on close coordination\nbetween armored vehicles, aircraft, and motorized troops, allowed the German military to\nmove much more quickly than it had in the previous war. It overran both the French army\nand their British allies in only six weeks, sending the remaining British troops retreating\nacross the Channel. Italy also invaded France once a fascist victory was assured. France was\ndivided up between a German-occupied zone and a pro-Nazi puppet state known as Vichy\nFrance.\n24 Chapter 1: World War II and the Aftermath The Nazis now faced a difficult strategic problem in Europe. Hitler wanted to elim-\ninate Great Britain from the war by invading the island, but with the British navy and air\nforce still intact, this was impossible, as any invasion force would be destroyed upon the sea.\nTherefore, Hitler initiated an air campaign which became known as the Battle of Britain.\nFor an entire year, Germany bombed Great Britain, targeting cities such as London, and\nGreat Britain\u2019s air force fought back against numerically-superior opponents. Hitler hoped\nto force the British into surrendering, but British morale held.\nWhile this aerial battle raged, British and Commonwealth (British colonies and\nformer colonies) forces fought Germany and Italy in North Africa. Italy attacked British\nSomaliland and Egypt, and the British counterattacked, capturing Libya. Hitler sent\nGerman forces to stabilize the situation, and the Italians and Germans together forced the\nBritish back again and looked set to drive them out of North Africa entirely. At about the\nsame time, German and Italian forces conquered both Greece and Yugoslavia.\nA major development in 1940 was the signing of the Tripartite Pact, a defensive\narrangement in which Germany, Italy, and Japan all agreed that an attack by any nation\n(except the USSR) on any of the three Tripartite nations would be considered an attack\non all three, who would fight together. The treaty was soon widened to include Hungary,\nSlovakia, and Romania. These nations would come to be known as the Axis Powers.\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt, President of the United States, wanted to join the war\non the side of the allies, but the US was still neutral, and American public opinion regard-\ning the war was unsettled. When the war in Poland began, under FDR\u2019s leadership, the US\namended its neutrality laws to permit allied nations to purchase war material in the US,\nprovided they transported it themselves (to avoid the sinking of American ships). After the\nfall of Paris, the US began a major naval construction program to prepare for war in Europe.\nIn September of 1940, the US agreed to give Great Britain fifty old, mothballed destroyers\nin exchange for use of British military bases in the Caribbean. Finally, in early 1941, the US\nsigned the Lend-Lease Act, by which the US supplied Great Britain and other allied coun-\ntries with war materials. The Americans were slowly changing their opinions and, overall,\ntaking an anti-fascist stance.\nHitler had not forgotten about his arch-enemy, the Soviet Union. He long dreamed\nof destroying the world\u2019s premier socialist nation and giving its lands to the German people,\nas he claimed he would in Mein Kampf. In June 1941, Germany, Italy, and Romania invad-\ned the USSR in a surprise attack called Operation Barbarossa, the largest land invasion\nin history. Axis forces drove deep into the USSR, quickly conquering the Baltic states and\nUkraine, nearly reaching Moscow before being stopped. Although the fascists had inflicted\nterrible casualties on the Red Army (the army of the Soviet Union) and civilians alike, they\nhad failed to deliver a decisive knock-out blow.\nThe final Axis strategic gambit of the war came in December 1941. The Allies had\nstopped selling Japan the oil it needed to complete its war in China, which had become\ndeadlocked. In October 1941, General Hideki Tojo was named Prime Minister of Japan.\nTojo was a member of one of the ultranationalist groups in the military \u2013 specifically, the\nBlack Dragons. To him, the idea of forgoing war in China was intolerable. He therefore\nordered the military to launch the planned attack into the Pacific, to seize the Dutch East\nIndies, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. These would provide Japan with the rubber\nand oil they needed to fuel their war machine. They also attacked the Americans, primarily\nat Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, as well as in the Philippines, in an attempt to forestall an American\ncounterattack. The United States declared war on Japan the next day, and Germany and Italy\nfollowed with declarations of war against the US. With all neutrality cast aside, the United\nStates finally entered the global struggle wholeheartedly.\n25 American bombers over Germany\nIn August 1941, the US and Great Britain had signed the Atlantic Charter, an\nagreement that outlined the nations\u2019 post-war goals. They agreed that, when the fascists\nwere defeated, the peoples of formerly-occupied nations would be allowed to decide their\nown governments, and that the Allies would not seek territorial gain in the war. It also\nlaid out concepts of economic and political cooperation. This charter became the basis\nfor the Declaration by United Nations, the official \u201crulebook\u201d for the Allies during the\nwar (\u201cUnited Nations\u201d was the formal name of the allied coalition). First, it acknowledged\nthat all the United Nations should abide by the Atlantic Charter; second, that each nation\n\u201cpledges itself to employ its full resources, military or economic, against those members of\nthe Tripartite Pact and its adherents with which such government is at war\u201d; and that no\nnation would abandon the others by making a separate peace with the enemy.\nIn the Pacific, Japan enjoyed early successes against the unprepared Allied forces;\nbut by June 1942, the tide had turned. The American fleet stopped a Japanese advance to\nseize the Australian territory of Papua, and decisively defeated the Japanese fleet at Midway\nIsland. Late in the year, the Americans successfully went on the offensive by invading the\nJapanese-held island of Guadalcanal, the first of many such bloody battles in the Pacific.\n26 Chapter 1: World War II and the Aftermath On the Eastern Front (in the USSR), the Germans also enjoyed early successes\nin their drive into the southern Caucus region, but were stopped at the city of Stalingrad,\nwhere some of the bloodiest fighting of the war took place. By February 1943, the Germans\nwere soundly beaten and driven back with terrible losses; they would never again achieve\nthe initiative on the Eastern Front.\nThe North African theatre was a seesaw affair of offensive and counter-offensive\nacross the barren desert until November 1942, when the Americans entered the theatre by\nlanding troops in Algeria and Morocco. The combined British \u2013 American force then drove\nthe Axis forces into Tunisia.\nIn the meantime, two other battles raged nonstop. The first was the Battle of the\nAtlantic, where Allied forces strove to protect the shipping lanes between Great Britain and\nthe US from German submarines. The second was the strategic bombing campaign against\nthe Axis, which saw British and American bombers attacking German cities to reduce both\ntheir industrial capacity and morale. This campaign caused a great many civilian casualties.\nIn the Pacific in 1943, the Americans continued their \u201cisland-hopping\u201d campaign,\nwherein they captured certain Japanese-held islands and bypassed others, allowing them\nto concentrate their forces where they were most needed. In the USSR, despite desperate\nfighting, the Germans were unable to make further headway against the Soviets and were\npushed back from the city of Leningrad, which had endured a horrific siege. And in the\nMediterranean, American and British forces successfully invaded Sicily from North Africa\nin July. This defeat caused the Italians to oust Mussolini and arrest him, although Il Duce\nwasn\u2019t quite finished yet. In September, Italy changed sides, joining the Allies. In response,\nGerman forces rescued Mussolini and invaded Italy, even as Allied forces were landing in\nthe south of that country.\nThe next year saw the Allies closing in on the Axis from all directions. The British,\nCanadians, and Americans landed in France in June and liberated Paris on August 25, but\nencountered stiffening resistance as they reached the German border. In the east, the Soviets\nlaunched a massive attack which liberated all the territory taken by the Axis and even con-\ntinued into the Balkans to drive out Axis forces there. In Italy, however, Allied forces were\nbogged down by strong German defenses and could make little headway. They had more\nsuccess in the Pacific, with the Americans liberating the Philippines in October.\nThe war would end the next year. Despite a desperate German counterattack, Allied\nforces in Western Europe continued their advance into Germany, freeing countries which\nthe fascists had overrun early in the war. Anti-fascist Italian partisans captured and execut-\ned Mussolini on April 28, 1945. The Soviets drove across Poland and into eastern Germany;\nthey captured Berlin in April, only to find that Hitler had committed suicide to prevent his\ncapture. The German government surrendered on May 8. The war in Europe was over.\nIn the Pacific, the Americans took the strategic islands of Iwo Jima and Okinawa,\nwhich put their bombers in range of Japan. They then began a devastating bombing cam-\npaign, like the one they had conducted against Germany. The USSR assisted the Allies in\nAsia by attacking Japanese forces in northeast China. Finally, the first use of atomic weap-\nons in August, combined with defeats at the hands of the USSR, convinced the emperor to\nsurrender on September 2, ending the war. Although casualty estimates vary widely, it is\nassumed that upwards of 85 million people died in the war, the majority of them civilians.\nThe War\u2019s Outcome\nAt the beginning of World War II, the fascist nations were holding all the cards.\nTheir militaries were far more powerful than those of the Allies, who were keen to avoid\nwar. Why did the Allies win? Here are four primary reasons:\n27 First, Adolf Hitler made the error of invading the Soviet Union before he had neu-\ntralized Great Britain. When it became clear that Germany could not soon invade the UK,\nand that the UK could not present a threat to Hitler for some time, Hitler decided to turn\neast and eliminate the USSR in the meantime. Initially, Hitler was loathe to fight a two-front\nwar, fearing an encirclement; however, he was convinced that the Red Army would fall in\nonly weeks, and that with the USSR destroyed, he would then be able to handle the UK\nat his leisure. Hitler\u2019s appraisal of the Red Army, and the USSR in general, proved incor-\nrect. The communist nation had vastly greater reserves of men than he estimated, and their\npeople fought on through utterly horrific conditions without surrender. When Berlin finally\nfell, it was to the Red Army, not the democracies. And by sending eighty percent of his war\nmachine into the USSR, Hitler so weakened his western flank that it permitted the Western\nallies to invade France in 1944, allowing the allies back into continental Europe and creating\nthe encirclement he once feared.\nThe second reason for the fascist defeat was that Hideki Tojo underestimated\nAmerican fighting ability and morale. Tojo, who hated all things Western, viewed American\nsociety as decadent and soft. He knew that a battle across the Pacific to reach Japan would\nbe exceedingly bloody \u2013 and he was right about that. His mistake was believing that the\nAmericans did not have the courage to make the necessary sacrifices, and would sue for\npeace before reaching Japan. As to his own military, Tojo believed that the Japanese people\nwere superior to all others, and by dint of their superior willpower, would surely win the\nwar. Had Tojo been more educated about the Americans, he might never have chosen to\nattack them.\nThe third reason was that the United States, protected by two large, insulating\noceans, was never directly attacked (apart from its Pacific possessions and a few insignificant\nattacks against the mainland). President Roosevelt knew that, with modern technology, the\noceans were no longer enough to protect America forever, and so wanted to push back the\nfascists as soon as possible, before they could reach the American mainland. But America\u2019s\ngeographic isolation from Europe and Asia bought it enough time to build up its industrial\nmight, which was the country\u2019s main contribution to the war. British, Soviet, and Chinese\nfactories came under constant attack, making it difficult for them to produce the necessary\nwar materials. Safe from bombardment, American industry could produce more and more\nweapons and equipment all the time. During the war, the United States outproduced the\nrest of the world combined, churning out unprecedented amounts of every type of war ma-\nterial. This allowed the United States not only to lavishly equip its own troops, but also to\nsupply the Allies\u2019 armies as well. America was, as FDR put it, the \u201cArsenal of Democracy.\u201d\nFinally, the brutality of the fascist armies, as demonstrated at Leningrad, Nanking,\nand the Philippines, among other places, convinced the allied nations that surrender to the\nfascists was a fate worse than death. Hitler openly promised genocide against the \u201cracial-\nly-inferior\u201d Slavs of the USSR and against Jews everywhere. Stories of Japanese atrocities,\nas well as a desire for revenge, likewise convinced the Americans that negotiation and ac-\ncommodation with Japan was out of the question. Since the allies had nothing to lose, they\nendured some of the worst suffering in human history, held their coalition together, and\nfought together to the end. The brutality of their enemies had convinced them that failure\nwas simply not an option.\nNotable Aspects of the War\nWorld War II was noteworthy for more than its geographical span and casualty\ncount. Several other aspects stand out as well.\nThe first is the concept of Total War, of which World War II was the foremost\n28 Chapter 1: World War II and the Aftermath example. Total War refers to a war in which a nation dedicates all its civilian capabilities\nto victory, from agriculture to industry to the media. All major nations involved in World\nWar II were forced, by necessity, to focus their entire national life on the war. Factories\nonly made war materials, ignoring unnecessary civilian products. Most men of fighting\nage found themselves in uniform, so women took over manufacturing jobs in all coun-\ntries. Imperial nations such as Great Britain and France recruited men from their overseas\ncolonies to fight, and the US launched a program to invite Mexican civilians to work in\nagriculture to make up for the manpower deficit. Civilians practiced rationing at home, so\nthat their militaries had the food, gasoline, rubber, and other materials needed for victory.\nTechnological research focused on new weapons, the media on propaganda. It is notewor-\nthy that suicides go down during a war, because the civilian population feels that it has a job\nto do, a meaningful purpose to fulfill, and civilians worldwide dedicated themselves to their\nnations.\nBut there is another side to Total War. Traditional, pre-industrial laws of warfare in\nmany cultures stated that non-combatants (women, children, prisoners of war, etc.) were\nnot to be harmed, and that non-military targets (places of worship, hospitals, schools, etc.)\nwere not to be destroyed. The idea was that these targets present no threat to an army, and\ntherefore should be spared. Of course, these rules were not always followed, but at least\nthere were some ethical norms that might restrain armies.\nIn Total War, however, such rules are often abandoned. In a modern, industrialized\nwar, factories are necessary for victory; but factories are civilian targets, not military, as are\nthe workers in the factories. If these civilian installations and workers are critical to the\nenemy, it then follows that one must destroy them. While this is logical, it breaks the tra-\nditional laws of war. The logic of Total War led to the strategic bombing campaigns against\nGreat Britain, Germany, and Japan during the war, and was one reason why most of the\nwar\u2019s causalities were civilians. The acceptance of Total War during World War II, plus the\ndevelopment of nuclear weapons in the same war, would soon influence superpower strate-\ngy. During the Cold War, the superpowers planned to use nuclear weapons to destroy entire\ncities with no thought to civilian casualties; wiping out nations became the primary goal.\nThis apocalyptic strategy represents the combination of nuclear weapons and the theory of\nTotal War. It haunts the entire world to this day.\nAnother notable aspect of the war was the number of atrocities and war crimes\ncommitted. The Holocaust, the Rape of Nanking, and the Bataan Death March were only a\nfew of the war\u2019s recorded atrocities. One reason for all these crimes was that the militaries\nof World War II were highly mobile, with troops quickly ranging over vast areas, so that\nmore civilians found themselves in harm\u2019s way. Another reason was the racism that drove\nso much of the rationale for the war, primarily on the Axis side. Axis governments had\nconvinced their people that their enemies were subhuman, and that killing them was no\nworse than killing animals. Furthermore, the Nazi plan for Eastern Europe was genocidal\nfrom the start, and aimed at the total elimination of Slavs, Jews, and other groups. In their\ncase, at least, massacres and other atrocities were the plan, not an error.\nA final major aspect of the war was technological development. War is the ultimate\nform of competition, and all sides in the conflict sought every advantage they could, mo-\nbilizing the best minds in their nations to develop better weapons. World War II saw the\ndevelopment of the first practical jet aircraft, the first military rockets, the first use of radar\nin war, the atom bomb, as well as the rapid development of many existing technologies.\nIndustrial processes were developed and improved. These technologies would be put to ci-\nvilian use after the war, becoming part of everyday life.\n29 The Aftermath of the War\nA great many of the topics in this book are the results of World War II. The most\nimmediate and obvious was the beginning of the Cold War, a nuclear stand-off between the\nworld\u2019s two remaining superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union (see Chapter\n2). This battle for the future of mankind (as viewed by its participants, anyway) was fought\nthrough proxy nations and massive propaganda campaigns, because direct military conflict\nbetween the superpowers was considered too devastating. This culture war started shortly\nafter World War II and continued until 1991 (the collapse of the USSR). All internation-\nal developments and conflicts took place in the context of the Cold War, the influence of\nwhich hung like a shadow over world events for about forty-five years.\nWhile the Cold War seemed to divide the world into two camps, the remaining em-\npires \u2013 Great Britain, France, Portugal, and the Netherlands \u2013 were being divided up as well.\nOne result of World War II was decolonization, the process by which colonized nations gain\ntheir independence (see Chapter 4). The first two decades after the war saw the end of the\nworld\u2019s legacy empires as various new political forces conspired to make their maintenance\nimpossible. This led to a period of great instability, with dozens of new countries being\nborn, some of them in great violence.\nAt the same time, there was a countercurrent against this wave of division, born\nof the need to prevent future wars. One factor was the rise of international human rights.\nThe concept of legal protections for the dignity, freedom, and well-being of individuals and\ngroups can be traced back primarily to the Age of Enlightenment, and was instrumental in\nthe American and French revolutions. During World War II, the Allies declared that the\npoint of the war was to uphold human rights, which the fascists were in the process of de-\nstroying. With human rights violations being associated with fascists, respect for human\nrights became the foundation of legitimate government, at least theoretically. This manifest\nin several international laws and covenants signed after the war (see Chapter 12 for more\ninformation), which provided a legal and moral basis for revolutions after the war, particu-\nlarly anticolonial struggles.\nFinally, major international organizations were created after the war to prevent\nfuture wars. The United Nations (Chapter 12) was founded to preserve world peace and\nassist in social and economic development. European integration (Chapter 12) was another\nunifying project, which created international unions in Europe designed both to remove\nthe divisions which had caused the war, but also to aid in reconstruction and economic de-\nvelopment. This movement eventually created the European Union, one of the great power\nblocs of today\u2019s world.\nConclusion\nWorld War II was the result of longstanding tensions, both nationalistic and\nethnic, as well as a desire for revenge and a fear of foreign powers. That is why the\nUnited Nations was established to end the divisions which caused the war. But the peace\nfollowing the war turned out to be uneasy at best, as the Cold War cast the pall of nuclear\nwar over all mankind, a threat which can never be entirely ended. The newly decolonized\nnations, although now free from domination, had to face the tangle of problems which\nperplex any independent nation. The postwar decades were a tug-of-war between division\nand unity; and now that the Pandora\u2019s Box of nuclear weapons had been opened, the\nconsequences of division could be, at their worst, apocalyptic.\n30 Chapter 1: World War II and the Aftermath Suggested Further Reading\nThe Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II by Iris Chang (Ishi Press, 2012, ISBN-13: 978-\n4871872188).\nThe Origins of Totalitarianism by Hannah Arendt (Andesite Press, 2017, ISBN-13: 978-1376196207).\nAdolf Hitler by John Toland (Ballantine Books, 1977, ISBN 13: 9780345258991).\nThe Good War by Studs Terkel (The New Press, 2011, ISBN-13. 978-1565843431).\nRussia at War, 1941\u20131945 by Alexander Werth (Skyhorse Publishing, 2017, ISBN-13. 978-1510716254).\nGlossary\nAdolf Hitler: Head of the National Socialist Workers\u2019 Party and Fuhrer (leader) of fascist Germany.\nAnschluss: Literally, \u201cJoining;\u201d the German annexation of Austria in March 1938.\nAtlantic Charter: A joint British / American statement on their plans for the postwar world; basically, their\nvision of the world they are fighting for.\nAuthoritarian: A political system characterized by strong government control and a lack of democracy.\nExamples are Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany.\nAxis Powers: The military coalition which fought against the allies in WWII.

I will,\ntherefore, begin by saying the most unpopular and most unwelcome thing. I will begin by saying what\neverybody would like to ignore or forget but which I must nevertheless be stated, namely, that we have\nsustained a total and unmitigated defeat, and that France has suffered even more than we have.\nViscoutess Astor: Nonsense.\nChurchill: When the Noble Lady cries \u201cNonsense,\u201d she could not have heard the Chancellor of the Exchequer\n(Sir John Simon) admit in his illuminating and comprehensive speech just now that Herr Hitler had gained in\nthis particular leap forward in substance all he set out to gain. ...\nWe are in the presence of a disaster of the first magnitude which has befallen Great Britain and France. Do\nnot let us blind ourselves to that. It must now be accepted that all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe\nwill make the best terms they can with the triumphant Nazi Power. The system of alliances in Central Europe\nupon which France has relied for her safety has been swept away, and I can see no means by which it can be\nreconstituted. The road down the Danube Valley to the black Sea, the resources of corn and oil, the road which\nleads as far as Turkey, has been opened. In fact, if not in form, it seems to me that all those countries of Middle\nEurope, all those Danubian countries, will, one after another, be drawn into this vast system of power politics\n33 -- not only power military politics but power economic politics -- radiating from Berlin, and I believe this can\nbe achieved quite smoothly and swiftly and will not necessarily entail the firing of a single shot....\nI do not grudge our loyal, brave people, who were ready to do their duty no matter what the cost, who never\nflinched under the strain of last week -- I do not grudge them the natural, spontaneous outburst of joy and\nrelief when they learned that the hard ordeal would no longer be required of them at the moment; but they\nshould know the truth.\nThey should know that there has been gross neglect and deficiency in our defenses; they should know that we\nhave sustained a defeat without a war, the consequences of which will travel far with us along our road; they\nshould know that we have passed an awful milestone in our history, when the whole equilibrium of Europe\nhas been deranged, and that the terrible words have for the time being been pronounced against the Western\ndemocracies:\n\u201cThou are weighed in the balance and found wanting.\u201d\nAnd do not suppose that this is the end. This is only the beginning of the reckoning. This is only the first sip,\nthe first foretaste of a bitter cup which will be proffered to us year by year unless by a supreme recovery of\nmoral health and martial vigor, we arise again and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time.\nFDR\u2019s \u201cArsenal of Democracy\u201d Speech\nFireside Chat from Washington DC, December 29,1940\n(highlights)\nMy friends:\nThis is not a fireside chat on war. It is a talk on national security; because the nub of the whole purpose of your\nPresident is to keep you now, and your children later, and your grandchildren much later, out of a last-ditch\nwar for the preservation of American independence and all the things that American independence means to\nyou and to me and to ours....\nNever before since Jamestown and Plymouth Rock has our American civilization been in such danger as now.\nFor, on September 27, 1940, by an agreement signed in Berlin, three powerful nations, two in Europe and one\nin Asia, joined themselves together in the threat that if the United States of America interfered with or blocked\nthe expansion program of these three nations -- a program aimed at world control -- they would unite in\nultimate action against the United States.\nThe Nazi masters of Germany have made it clear that they intend not only to dominate all life and thought\nin their own country, but also to enslave the whole of Europe, and then to use the resources of Europe to\ndominate the rest of the world.\nIt was only three weeks ago their leader stated this: \u201cThere are two worlds that stand opposed to each other.\u201d\nAnd then in defiant reply to his opponents, he said this: \u201cOthers are correct when they say: With this world we\ncannot ever reconcile ourselves. . . . I can beat any other power in the world.\u201d So said the leader of the Nazis.\nIn other words, the Axis not merely admits but proclaims that there can be no ultimate peace between their\nphilosophy of government and our philosophy of government.\nIn view of the nature of this undeniable threat, it can be asserted, properly and categorically, that the United\n34 Chapter 1: World War II and the Aftermath States has no right or reason to encourage talk of peace, until the day shall come when there is a clear intention\non the part of the aggressor nations to abandon all thought of dominating or conquering the world.\nDoes anyone seriously believe that we need to fear attack anywhere in the Americas while a free Britain remains\nour most powerful naval neighbor in the Atlantic? Does anyone seriously believe, on the other hand, that we\ncould rest easy if the Axis powers were our neighbors there?\nIf Great Britain goes down, the Axis powers will control the continents of Europe, Asia, Africa, Australasia,\nand the high seas-and they will be in a position to bring enormous military and naval resources against this\nhemisphere. It is no exaggeration to say that all of us, in all the Americas, would be living at the point of a gun\n-- a gun loaded with explosive bullets, economic as well as military.\nSome of us like to believe that even if Great Britain falls, we are still safe, because of the broad expanse of the\nAtlantic and of the Pacific. But the width of those oceans is not what it was in the days of clipper ships. At one\npoint between Africa and Brazil the distance is less than from Washington to Denver, Colorado-five hours for\nthe latest type of bomber. And at the North end of the Pacific Ocean America and Asia almost touch each other.\nEven today we have planes that could fly from the British Isles to New England and back again without\nrefueling. And remember that the range of the modern bomber is ever being increased.\nSome nations of Europe were bound by solemn non-intervention pacts with Germany. Other nations were\nassured by Germany that they need never fear invasion. Non-intervention pact or not, the fact remains that\nthey were attacked, overrun and thrown into the modern form of slavery at an hour\u2019s notice, or even without\nany notice at all. As an exiled leader of one of these nations said to me the other day -- \u201cThe notice was a minus\nquantity. It was given to my Government two hours after German troops had poured into my country in a\nhundred places.\u201d\nThe fate of these nations tells us what it means to live at the point of a Nazi gun....\nThere are also American citizens, many of them in high places, who, unwittingly in most cases, are aiding and\nabetting the work of these agents. I do not charge these American citizens with being foreign agents. But I do\ncharge them with doing exactly the kind of work that the dictators want done in the United States.\nThese people not only believe that we can save our own skins by shutting our eyes to the fate of other\nnations. Some of them go much further than that. They say that we can and should become the friends and\neven the partners of the Axis powers. Some of them even suggest that we should imitate the methods of the\ndictatorships. Americans never can and never will do that.\nThe experience of the past two years has proven beyond doubt that no nation can appease the Nazis. No man\ncan tame a tiger into a kitten by stroking it. There can be no appeasement with ruthlessness. There can be no\nreasoning with an incendiary bomb. We know now that a nation can have peace with the Nazis only at the price\nof total surrender.\nThe American appeasers ignore the warning to be found in the fate of Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland,\nNorway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and France. They tell you that the Axis powers are going to win\nanyway; that all this bloodshed in the world could be saved; that the United States might just as well throw its\ninfluence into the scale of a dictated peace, and get the best out of it that we can.\nThey call it a \u201cnegotiated peace.\u201d Nonsense! Is it a negotiated peace if a gang of outlaws surrounds your\n35 community and on threat of extermination makes you pay tribute to save your own skins?\nThe British people and their allies today are conducting an active war against this unholy alliance. Our own\nfuture security is greatly dependent on the outcome of that fight. Our ability to \u201ckeep out of war\u201d is going to be\naffected by that outcome.\nThinking in terms of today and tomorrow, I make the direct statement to the American people that there is\nfar less chance of the United States getting into war, if we do all we can now to support the nations defending\nthemselves against attack by the Axis than if we acquiesce in their defeat, submit tamely to an Axis victory, and\nwait our turn to be the object of attack in another war later on.\nThe people of Europe who are defending themselves do not ask us to do their fighting. They ask us for the\nimplements of war, the planes, the tanks, the guns, the freighters which will enable them to fight for their\nliberty and for our security. Emphatically we must get these weapons to them in sufficient volume and quickly\nenough, so that we and our children will be saved the agony and suffering of war which others have had to\nendure.\nNine days ago I announced the setting up of a more effective organization to direct our gigantic efforts to\nincrease the production of munitions. The appropriation of vast sums of money and a well coordinated\nexecutive direction of our defense efforts are not in themselves enough. Guns, planes, ships and many other\nthings have to be built in the factories and arsenals of America. They have to be produced by workers and\nmanagers and engineers with the aid of machines which in turn have to be built by hundreds of thousands of\nworkers throughout the land.\nWe must be the great arsenal of democracy. For us this is an emergency as serious as war itself. We must apply\nourselves to our task with the same resolution, the same sense of urgency, the same spirit of patriotism and\nsacrifice as we would show were we at war.\nWe have furnished the British great material support and we will furnish far more in the future.\nI believe that the Axis powers are not going to win this war. I base that belief on the latest and best information.\nI have the profound conviction that the American people are now determined to put forth a mightier effort\nthan they have ever yet made to increase our production of all the implements of defense, to meet the threat to\nour democratic faith.\nCharles Lindbergh\u2019s Des Moines Speech\nSeptember 11, 1941\n(excerpted)\nIt is now two years since this latest European war began. From that day in September, 1939, until the present\nmoment, there has been an over-increasing effort to force the United States into the conflict.\nThat effort has been carried on by foreign interests, and by a small minority of our own people; but it has been\nso successful that, today, our country stands on the verge of war.\nAt this time, as the war is about to enter its third winter, it seems appropriate to review the circumstances that\nhave led us to our present position. Why are we on the verge of war? Was it necessary for us to become so\ndeeply involved?\n36 Chapter 1: World War II and the Aftermath Who is responsible for changing our national policy from one of neutrality and independence to one of\nentanglement in European affairs?\nPersonally, I believe there is no better argument against our intervention than a study of the causes and\ndevelopments of the present war. I have often said that if the true facts and issues were placed before the\nAmerican people, there would be no danger of our involvement.\nWhen this war started in Europe, it was clear that the American people were solidly opposed to entering it.\nWhy shouldn\u2019t we be? We had the best defensive position in the world; we had a tradition of independence\nfrom Europe; and the one time we did take part in a European war left European problems unsolved, and debts\nto America unpaid.\nNational polls showed that when England and France declared war on Germany, in 1939, less than 10 percent\nof our population favored a similar course for America. But there were various groups of people, here and\nabroad, whose interests and beliefs necessitated the involvement of the United States in the war. I shall point\nout some of these groups tonight, and outline their methods of procedure. In doing this, I must speak with the\nutmost frankness, for in order to counteract their efforts, we must know exactly who they are.\nThe three most important groups who have been pressing this country toward war are the British, the Jewish\nand the Roosevelt administration.\nBehind these groups, but of lesser importance, are a number of capitalists, Anglophiles, and intellectuals\nwho believe that the future of mankind depends upon the domination of the British empire. Add to these the\nCommunistic groups who were opposed to intervention until a few weeks ago, and I believe I have named the\nmajor war agitators in this country.\nWhen hostilities commenced in Europe, in 1939, it was realized by these groups that the American people had\nno intention of entering the war. They knew it would be worse than useless to ask us for a declaration of war at\nthat time. But they believed that this country could be entered into the war in very much the same way we were\nentered into the last one.\nThey planned: first, to prepare the United States for foreign war under the guise of American defense; second,\nto involve us in the war, step by step, without our realization; third, to create a series of incidents which would\nforce us into the actual conflict. These plans were of course, to be covered and assisted by the full power of their\npropaganda.\nOur theaters soon became filled with plays portraying the glory of war. Newsreels lost all semblance of\nobjectivity. Newspapers and magazines began to lose advertising if they carried anti-war articles. A smear\ncampaign was instituted against individuals who opposed intervention. The terms \u201cfifth columnist,\u201d \u201ctraitor,\u201d\n\u201cNazi,\u201d \u201canti-Semitic\u201d were thrown ceaselessly at any one who dared to suggest that it was not to the best\ninterests of the United States to enter the war. Men lost their jobs if they were frankly anti-war. Many others\ndared no longer speak.\nBefore long, lecture halls that were open to the advocates of war were closed to speakers who opposed it. A\nfear campaign was inaugurated. We were told that aviation, which has held the British fleet off the continent of\nEurope, made America more vulnerable than ever before to invasion. Propaganda was in full swing.\nThere was no difficulty in obtaining billions of dollars for arms under the guise of defending America. Our\n37 people stood united on a program of defense. Congress passed appropriation after appropriation for guns and\nplanes and battleships, with the approval of the overwhelming majority of our citizens. That a large portion of\nthese appropriations was to be used to build arms for Europe, we did not learn until later. That was another\nstep.\nEver since its inception, our arms program has been laid out for the purpose of carrying on the war in Europe,\nfar more than for the purpose of building an adequate defense for America.\nEngland and France would win if the United States would only repeal its arms embargo and sell munitions for\ncash, we were told. And then [illegible] began, a refrain that marked every step we took toward war for many\nmonths--\u201dthe best way to defend America and keep out of war.\u201d we were told, was \u201cby aiding the Allies.\u201d\nFirst, we agreed to sell arms to Europe; next, we agreed to loan arms to Europe; then we agreed to patrol the\nocean for Europe; then we occupied a European island in the war zone. Now, we have reached the verge of war.\nMen and women of Iowa; only one thing holds this country from war today. That is the rising opposition of the\nAmerican people. Our system of democracy and representative government is on test today as it has never been\nbefore. We are on the verge of a war in which the only victor would be chaos and prostration.\nWe are on the verge of war, but it is not yet too late to stay out. It is not too late to show that no amount of\nmoney, or propaganda, or patronage can force a free and independent people into war against its will. It is not\nyet too late to retrieve and to maintain the independent American destiny that our forefathers established in\nthis new world.\nThe entire future rests upon our shoulders. It depends upon our action, our courage, and our intelligence. If\nyou oppose our intervention in the war, now is the time to make your voice heard.\nThe Atlantic Charter\nAugust 14, 1941\nThe President of the United States of America and the Prime Minister, Mr. Churchill, representing His\nMajesty\u2019s Government in the United Kingdom, being met together, deem it right to make known certain\ncommon principles in the national policies of their respective countries on which they base their hopes for a\nbetter future for the world.\nFirst, their countries seek no aggrandizement, territorial or other;\nSecond, they desire to see no territorial changes that do not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the\npeoples concerned;\nThird, they respect the right of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they will live; and\nthey wish to see sovereign rights and self government restored to those who have been forcibly deprived of\nthem;\nFourth, they will endeavor, with due respect for their existing obligations, to further the enjoyment by all\nStates, great or small, victor or vanquished, of access, on equal terms, to the trade and to the raw materials of\nthe world which are needed for their economic prosperity;\nFifth, they desire to bring about the fullest collaboration between all nations in the economic field with the\n38 Chapter 1: World War II and the Aftermath object of securing, for all, improved labor standards, economic advancement and social security;\nSixth, after the final destruction of the Nazi tyranny, they hope to see established a peace which will afford to all\nnations the means of dwelling in safety within their own boundaries, and which will afford assurance that all\nthe men in all lands may live out their lives in freedom from fear and want;\nSeventh, such a peace should enable all men to traverse the high seas and oceans without hindrance;\nEighth, they believe that all of the nations of the world, for realistic as well as spiritual reasons must come to\nthe abandonment of the use of force. Since no future peace can be maintained if land, sea or air armaments\ncontinue to be employed by nations which threaten, or may threaten, aggression outside of their frontiers, they\nbelieve, pending the establishment of a wider and permanent system of general security, that the disarmament\nof such nations is essential. They will likewise aid and encourage all other practicable measure which will\nlighten for peace-loving peoples the crushing burden of armaments.\n[signed]\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\nWinston S.

While the confrontation between these two superpowers,\nthe Cold War, is covered in Chapter 3, this chapter will narrate the domestic histories of the US\nand the USSR after World War II. However, each nation was so obsessed with the Cold War\nthat their domestic histories cannot be disentangled from their ideological conflict.\n40 Chapter 2: USA and the USSR The United States: Postwar Prosperity and Fear\nWorld War II profoundly changed the United States. Before the war, the US was\nalready the most industrialized nation in the world, although not the most powerful (Nazi\nGermany had the greatest military in the world at the start of the war, and the US was far\nbehind). The war not only transformed American industry and economics, but also re-\nshaped its role in the world and, most importantly, its view of itself.\nRather than demobilize its military, as it had largely done after World War I, the US\nwould now keep troops stationed around the world to contain communism; this mission\nwas spelled out in the Truman Doctrine of 1947 (see Chapter 3). The doctrine redefined\nAmerica\u2019s role in the world but, simultaneously, life in America was about to change drasti-\ncally.\nThe American postwar economy initially stumbled with the end of wartime ra-\ntioning and regulation. However, millions of returning servicemen married, had children,\nand bought homes. They now needed appliances, furniture, cars, and a plethora of other\nthings. This massive consumer need, coupled with America\u2019s new industrial capacity and\nstrong union membership, produced the greatest economic boom in US history. More\npeople rose from poverty to the middle class than ever before, as evidenced by record home\nownership. The new marriages also produced the Baby Boom, a surge in births in the first\ntwenty years after World War II. The \u201cBoomers\u201d would change American culture as they\nmoved through history together.\nThe US invested enormous sums in public projects. A mix of private and federal\nfunds helped produce, then distribute, Salk\u2019s Vaccine, which eliminated the threat of polio.\nUnder the Eisenhower administration, the US invested in its interstate highway system,\nwhich improved domestic commerce and travel. Good roads, coupled with low gas prices\nand inexpensive automobiles, meant that America now moved predominantly by road,\ninstead of by rail as it had done for decades. Cars also contributed to the rise of suburbs,\ncommunities outside the cities where people lived but didn\u2019t work. Suburbs consequently\nled to White Flight, the phenomenon of newly middle-class White Americans moving to\nthe suburbs from the inner cities, leaving the inner cities poorer due to lower tax revenues.\nAmerican lifespans increased due to several factors. Not only did medical technol-\nogy evolve (largely in the forms of vaccinations and antibiotics), but health education also\nexpanded, giving people the information they needed to avoid unhealthy habits. Higher\nAmerican incomes contributed to better diets and widespread health insurance. All these\nfactors increased the average American lifespan from 62.9 years in 1940 to 76.7 years by\n1998.\nAnother major change in American culture was the development of television.\nAlthough created in the 1920s for educational purposes, the Great Depression, and then\nWorld War II, delayed its large-scale introduction. Now TV became a fixture of American\nlife, replacing to some degree the mainstays of cinema and radio. TV was a factor in pro-\nducing a unified culture in America, where people across the country watched the same\nnews and entertainment, creating a common national experience. It also helped popularize\nprofessional sports.\nTV contributed to youth culture, wherein young people have their own subcul-\nture, separate from that of their parents. In preindustrial societies, families worked together\ndaily, mainly on farms; but with industrialization came compulsory education, meaning\nchildren are away from their parents at least half the day, spending their time instead with\nchildren their own age. It is not surprising, then, that they should develop their own social\nviews, clothing, and slang. TV (and other media) leverages youth culture, and helps create\nit, by providing programming and advertising which is aimed exclusively at children and\nyouths. The new sensation of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll music was a product of youth culture, and helped\n41 Civil Rights leaders in a march in Washington DC against Jim Crow laws, 1963.\nFrom the National Archives\nyoung adults identify with their own generation. The generation gap which youth culture\nproduces is a constant source of frustration for parents in industrialized cultures, who often\nfear that they are losing control of their children.\nAlthough America was developing into a superpower on the world stage and an\neconomic powerhouse at home, dark undercurrents cut through American culture which\ncould not be ignored. Racism in America manifest, at its worst, as the Jim Crow laws in\nthe former Confederate states. Although the Civil War had ended slavery, the subsequent\nReconstruction Era failed to end systemic racism. Consequently, southern states set up a\nsystem of laws known collectively as Jim Crow to prevent African Americans from attaining\npolitical and economic equality. These laws prevented Blacks from voting (in contravention\nof the US Constitution), from serving on juries, from studying for certain professions in\ncollege, and from marrying White people. They also physically segregated Black citizens, in\nschools and in other public places. This racist system, in place for nearly a hundred years,\nwould shortly be challenged by the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s (see\nChapter 8 for an in-depth description).\n42 Chapter 2: USA and the USSR The Cold War inspired a fear of communist infiltration in the United States, a fear which\ncertain politicians were quick to leverage for their own gain. Joseph McCarthy (R-WI)\ndrummed up fear of communist spies to save his failing political career. He ran a campaign\nof conspiracy theories and false accusations against left-wing politicians and celebrities, cre-\nating a climate of paranoia in which simply to be accused of communist sympathies meant\nlosing one\u2019s reputation or even one\u2019s job. It was one of two Red Scares in US history. As with\nso many witch hunts, he and other conservatives used this fear to attack any and all political\nenemies, such as feminists, anti-racists, and homosexuals, accusing them all of disloyalty.\nAlthough McCarthy eventually fell from grace, the fear continued, and the possibility of\nnuclear war with the communists also darkened the American dream.\nThe United States: Social Change of the 1960s\nThe decade of the 1960s has a reputation for radicalism, both in the United States\nand abroad. There are many theories as to why: that World War II had revealed the human\nrights hypocrisy of imperialism, racism, and sexism in the democracies; that postwar\nwealth drove the new Baby Boomers to expect more from life; that youth culture rebelled\nagainst what it regarded as a very conservative culture of their parents. Certainly, the war\nin Vietnam, and the subsequent draft (conscription), forced young American men to take\na stance on the war one way or another. In the sixties, it seemed that all social conflicts\nintensified.\nThe Civil Rights Movement in the US was one such example (see Chapter 8). Led\nprimarily by Rev. Martin Luther King, this movement sought, through direct action, to\nremove the Jim Crow laws and secure the vote for African Americans, as well as eliminate\nsegregation. It was ultimately successful; President Lyndon Johnson knew that American\nhypocrisy on race was weakening the country\u2019s anticommunist mission, making democracy\nseem illegitimate. He passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as a result.\nThe women\u2019s rights movement of the 1960s was known as the Second Wave of\nFeminism (the First Wave was the push for women\u2019s suffrage, won in 1920). Launched by\nthe publication of Betty Friedan\u2019s The Feminine Mystique in 1963, the movement demanded\na change in attitude towards women in postwar American society, from regarding them as\ngood only for child-rearing and homemaking, to equals in the realms of career and poli-\ntics. The movement succeeded in winning American women the rights to birth control and\nabortion, as well as legislation to prevent employment discrimination.\nOther major social movements of the 1960s included the anti-war movement,\nwhich might be more accurately described as the \u201canti-draft\u201d movement. American popu-\nlar ambiguity towards the war in Vietnam, coupled with reports of American war crimes,\nmeant that Vietnam (see Chapter 7) did not engender the same patriotic surge that Pearl\nHarbor had. The 1960s also saw the start of the Environmental Movement, launched pri-\nmarily by the publication of Silent Spring by Rachael Carson in 1962 (again demonstrat-\ning the remarkable power of a good book). Corporate America, responsible for so much\npollution, was at first disparaging of the movement and ignored it, which proved a critical\nerror. President Richard Nixon, seeing the growing power of the movement, created the\nEPA (Environmental Protection Agency), and the newly-regulated corporations found\nthemselves suddenly on the defensive. Other movements of the 1960s sought to protect the\nrights of homosexuals and American Indians in the United States.\nThe Cold War heated up along with social tensions in the early 1960s, culminating\nin the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. American nuclear missiles in NATO allies Italy and\nTurkey compelled the USSR to install missiles in post-revolution Cuba (see Chapter 3). This\nled to a naval stand-off in the Caribbean which very nearly exploded into war, a war which\n43 almost certainly would have gone nuclear. Although the two Cold War enemies subsequent-\nly tried to cool tensions through a process known as d\u00e9tente, they still supported opposing\nsides in the Second Indochina War and tensions remained fairly high. Another arena of\ncompetition between the US and USSR was the Space Race, a competition of \u201cfirsts\u201d in\nspace, in which the Soviets held an early lead with the first artificial satellite in 1957 and\nthe first human space flight in 1961. The US, however, \u201cwon\u201d the race in 1969 with the first\nmoon landing.\nEventually, the progressivism of the 1960s led to a conservative backlash against\nracial and gender equality. The nation also experienced a general anti-government senti-\nment, brought on by the draft and government enforcement of anti-segregation rulings\nin the South. Richard Nixon exploited these currents in American society for political\ngain. He promised to get America out of Vietnam \u201cwith honor;\u201d he also promised south-\nern democrats that he would not push for racial equality, as Johnson had. This was part\nof his \u201cSouthern Strategy\u201d to draw southern democrats, opposed to civil rights, into the\nRepublican Party. The strategy worked, and swelled the ranks of the Republican Party.\nNixon changed US policies in the Cold War, particularly in Asia. His process of\n\u201cVietnamization\u201d withdrew American troops from Vietnam while providing supplies and\ntraining to South Vietnamese troops; this process was popular in America, but could not\nprop up the corrupt South Vietnamese government, which fell to the North in 1975. In\norder to pressure the USSR into nuclear weapons reductions talks, Nixon opened diplomat-\nic and economic ties with China, which the US had embargoed since 1949. This new China\npolicy would have economic repercussions for both countries long after Nixon was gone.\nThe United States: the 1970s\nAlthough the progressive movements of the 1960s and early 1970s made lasting\nchanges to American culture, it was clear that they would not continue at the same intensity\ninto the mid-1970s. People tired of so much rapid change and social tension. Then came\nthe shock of Watergate, when President Nixon resigned to avoid being impeached for\ncovering up his involvement in a break-in and theft at the Democratic Party headquarters\nin Washington DC; the American failure in Vietnam and the Watergate crisis depressed\nthe American people, leading them to doubt their government and their capabilities.\nFurthermore, the American economy declined. First, the OPEC Oil Crisis (see Chapter\n11) spurred a global recession which hit the Americans hard. Second, the postwar rise of\nAsian economies, such as Japan and China, now seriously challenged American industry in\nthe global market.\nThe twin ecological catastrophes of Three Mile Island (a partial meltdown in a\nnuclear power plant in Pennsylvania) and Love Canal (where a New York school was built\nover a leaking toxic waste dump) reminded Americans that they had not yet solved their\nenvironmental problems; it did, however, keep the environmental movement invigorated.\nTwo events in the 1970s would later have profound consequences for the nation and\nthe world, although few recognized it at the time. The first was the signing of the Helsinki\nAccords, in which the United States and Europe recognized the borders of the Warsaw Pact\nin return for a promise that the Soviets would safeguard human rights (see Chapter 3 for\nmore). Subsequent Soviet history demonstrates that this agreement was one of the catalysts\nfor the fall of communism in Europe.\nThe other major development was the invention of the first commercially-avail-\nable microprocessor in 1971. Prior to this breakthrough, computers were large and ex-\npensive, used only by major corporations, universities, the government, or the military.\nMicroprocessors are tiny electronic apparatus which use a tiny percentage of the power of\n44 Chapter 2: USA and the USSR previous computers. These made computers much smaller and cheaper, allowing them to be\nused for a great many applications in business, science, and consumer culture. The ubiqui-\ntous devices would soon transform everyday life in the United States, although perhaps no\none at the time realized just how profound the change would be.\nThree events in 1979 shook America\u2019s confidence. First, American citizens were\ntaken hostage as a result of the Iranian Revolution (Chapter 11), humiliating the super-\npower. Then the successful Sandinista Revolution in Nicaragua (Chapter 10) convinced\nthe Carter administration that the leftist rebels would turn their country into another Cuba.\nFinally, the administration feared that the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan at the end of\nthe year (Chapter 13) was a Soviet move to occupy the oil fields of Iran (it wasn\u2019t). To many\nAmericans, it seemed that their enemies were on the march around the world and that they\nwere powerless to stop them.\nRonald and Nancy Reagan in 1981. Courtesy of the Reagan Library.\nThe United States: The Reagan Revolution\nRepublican Ronald Reagan exploited this malaise in his 1980 presidential cam-\npaign. A former governor of California, Reagan was the first major politician to harness the\npower of the American evangelical community. This fundamentalist strain of Christianity\ntraditionally avoided politics, but the Roe v. Wade finding of 1973, which legalized abortion\nin the US, provoked evangelicals into action, and Reagan rode their rising political tide to\nvictory. The \u201cReagan Revolution\u201d was built on three pillars: small government (the belief\nthat a large federal government is bad), nationalism and anticommunism, and social con-\nservatism.\nReagan shrank the size of the federal government for the sake of reducing taxes\n(except for the military, which he expanded). He also reignited the Cold War, believing that\nd\u00e9tente had been a mistake and taking the invasion of Afghanistan as proof that the Soviets\nneeded to be pressured. Reagan also promoted a conservative social agenda, which meant\n45 anti-homosexual and anti-abortion policies, as well as pushing for mandatory prayer in\npublic schools. He also ran a major anti-drug campaign (the motto was \u201cJust Say No\u201d) and\nwas perceived as tough on crime.\nThe 1980s were a time of conservative resurgence in America, including a rise of\nmaterialism and consumerism as the economy improved; the increasing wealth (not avail-\nable to all, of course) also allowed for new epidemics of cocaine (for the better off) and\ncrack (for the urban poor). Another major epidemic of the 1980s was biological: the arrival\nof AIDS in the US. The disease\u2019s cause was not understood in the early days of the epidemic,\nand people only knew that it was most prevalent among homosexuals and Haitians, causing\na backlash against those two communities. It was only with time that AIDS became treat-\nable (though not curable), thus allowing the panic to subside.\nUnion membership declined in the 1980s, largely due to a loss of manufacturing\nbase to Asian competitors, which brought down relative wages; strong pro-business gov-\nernment policies led to a surging stock market, allowing for an increasing concentration of\nwealth in the upper classes. The government also cut social spending, increasing the pov-\nerty rate. And with the revelation of the Iran-Contra Affair in 1986, in which the Reagan\nadministration broke federal law by providing weapons and money to terrorist groups, the\nUnited States learned that its government did not necessarily respect its own laws.\nReagan\u2019s presidency, two terms long, was probably the most consequential since\nFDR\u2019s. Since the 1930s, America\u2019s economy had been based on Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, which\nwas a program of large government to improve the economy. Now, the Reagan Revolution\nreversed that trend, moving the economy towards small government and concentration of\nwealth, a trend which continues into the 21st century.\nThe United States: The 1990s\nReagan was followed by George Bush Sr., scion of a wealthy Connecticut family\nturned Texas oilman. Bush Sr. was notable for having few policy ideas, apart from refusing\nto raise taxes (which he ended up doing anyway). However, since the world was about to\nchange dramatically and unexpectedly under his watch, it might be just as well that Bush\nhad no policy commitments, as he would have had to adapt them to changing conditions\nanyway.\nThe greatest change was the end of the Cold War. The collapse of communism in\nEastern Europe was followed by the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Naturally, the US wel-\ncomed what appeared to many as \u201cvictory\u201d in the Cold War; but it also confused policy\nmakers, who did not foresee this tectonic shift in foreign affairs and were left without a plan.\nThe US seemed much clearer regarding the Middle East where, in 1990, Iraq invaded neigh-\nboring Kuwait. The Saudi royal family asked the United States to send troops to protect\ntheir oil fields from possible invasion, and the US responded. Not only did the US protect\nSaudi Arabia, but the next year attacked Iraqi forces in Kuwait to liberate the country in\nOperation Desert Storm (see Chapter 11).\nOn the domestic political front, the Democratic Party, under President Bill Clinton,\nremained progressive on social issues while drifting closer to conservatives on fiscal policy.\nThese \u201cNew Democrats\u201d found that shifting to the right on economic issues was useful\nfor getting policies passed, as Republicans were less willing to fight them. This led to the\ncontinuation of Reagan\u2019s economic policies, even under a Democratic presidency, though\nnot of his social policies.\nA major development in the 1990s was the expansion and practical application of\nthe internet. The growth and spread of microcomputers in the 1980s, thanks mainly to the\nmicroprocessor, meant that more and more American homes sported a personal computer.\n46 Chapter 2: USA and the USSR These home computers could be linked, initially by common phone lines, to larger servers,\nwhich served as the backbone for the internet. Common protocols allowed computers any-\nwhere in the world to communicate and transmit data between them. The internet infra-\nstructure and home computers evolved in complexity until they could perform secure credit\ncard transactions and stream video and music. Entrepreneurs were quick to exploit this new\ntool, and the internet soon became an important part of the global economy. Today, more\nAmericans have internet access than have a television.\nThe United States: The War on Terror, 2001 \u2013 2020\nAmerican triumphalism over the fall of the USSR ended on September 11, 2001.\nAn Islamic fundamentalist terrorist organization known as Al-Qaeda attacked the United\nStates by flying two passenger jets into the World Trade Center in New York and another\ninto the Pentagon in Washington DC (a fourth aircraft was brought down by the passengers\nbefore it could reach its target). This attack started the War on Terror, a twenty-year mili-\ntary and intelligence campaign by the United States. It included the invasion of Afghanistan\nin October 2001 and Iraq in 2003. The War on Terror also included the capture and torture\nof terror suspects abroad (often against international law) and surveillance against Muslims\nin the United States. This campaign would not end until the last US troops left Afghanistan\nin 2021, making the War on Terror America\u2019s longest war.\nAlthough September 11th brought Americans together as few events before, this\nunity did not last. The Great Recession, started by a housing bubble in the United States,\ndamaged the American economy and opened the door to the election of Barack Obama,\nAmerica\u2019s first African American president. Obama fought the recession with a stimulus\npackage and the Affordable Care Act (government-subsidized health care), which proved\nvery controversial in this new age of small government.\nFollowing Obama was the surprising election victory of Donald Trump, a business\nmagnate who ran on a rightist populist ticket. Known for his lively and combative style,\nTrump\u2019s policies consisted of immigration restrictions (such as trying to build a wall along\nthe US / Mexican border), and an \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy, which seemed to represent\na retreat into isolationism. Trump became one of only three presidents to face impeach-\nment, due to a scandal related to aid to Ukraine. Trump\u2019s time in office was also punctuated\nby severe racial tension in America, mainly owing to police killings of unarmed African\nAmericans. This led to the Black Lives Matter movement in the US. Furthermore, the ar-\nrival of the COVID-19 virus in the US initiated the worst American epidemic since the\n1918 Spanish Flu outbreak, leading to over a million deaths in the US.\nTrump was bested in the next presidential election by former Vice President Joe\nBiden; but Trump and his supporters tried to deny and overturn the results of the election.\nBesides numerous legal failures, these attempts led to the January 6, 2021 riot at the capitol,\nwhich attempted to prevent the certification of Biden\u2019s victory. The last major change in US\npolicy at the time of this writing (2022) was the Supreme Court\u2019s reversal of Roe V. Wade\nin June 2022, meaning that the legality of abortion was now to be determined by the states;\nthis was the first time in American history that a constitutional right was revoked by the\nSupreme Court.\n47 The United States: Conclusion\nSeveral major trends in American postwar history stand out. First, Americans have\nbeen increasingly willing to grant rights and freedoms to traditionally subaltern groups,\nsuch as women, ethnic minorities, LGBTQ people, and the disabled. These groups have\nmade economic, political, and social strides which would have seemed impossible before\nthe 1950s, although those rights would later be threatened by a conservative Supreme Court.\nThe United States is also vastly more ethnically diverse than it was before World\nWar II. In 1965, only 5% of the American population was foreign-born; today it is 14%.\nMost of this immigration was from Mexico and Central America, although Asians are now\nthe largest immigrant group. By the mid-21st century, the US will probably not have any\nsingle ethnic majority.\nThe traditional American family, consisting of a married man and woman with an\naverage 2.33 children (in 1960), is changing. Marriage rates have declined as divorces have\nincreased, so that now a smaller percentage of Americans are married than ever before.\nAbout one-quarter of all American children grow up in single-parent households. And the\nroles of mother and father are changing, now that women are often the main breadwinner\nin the family and men do a larger share of child-rearing.\nTraditional religion is suffering a similar fate in the US, where the percentage\nof adults affiliated with an organized religion has decreased. This is particularly true for\n\u201cMillennials\u201d (born 1981 \u2013 1996), who are over one-third unaffiliated. This trend, inciden-\ntally, is by no means an American oddity. In about half the world\u2019s nations, \u201cunaffiliated\u201d is\nthe second-largest religious group.\nThe United States is also, since about 1971, a much less socially-mobile society than\nit once was. The middle class, which expanded in the strong postwar economy as more\nAmericans left poverty, has been hollowed out; more Americans are now lower-class than\nbefore 1970, as more money has become concentrated in the upper class. In the United\nStates, the richest 10% now own 70% of all the nation\u2019s wealth (almost double the 1970\nlevel), and the poorest 50% own about 2.5 percent. The causes of this inequality trend are\nnumerous. Racism still plays a role in preventing ethnic minorities from getting jobs for\nwhich they are qualified; African American families, for example, have barely benefitted\nfrom all the economic growth since 1960. Furthermore, college education has become more\nexpensive, making it harder to pay for degrees that lead to well-paid professions. Income\ntaxes on the wealthy are much lower than they once were, especially after the Reagan Era\ntax cuts, as are taxes on corporations. These factors, plus a growing salary gap between reg-\nular workers and corporate CEOs (now at about 278 to 1), allow the wealthy to acquire and\nretain more wealth than the middle and lower classes. Loss of jobs to foreign competition\nand smaller union memberships also contribute to the wealth gap.\nFinally, Americans seem less unified than ever, with a wide political divide and\nincreasing radicalization. The shared feelings of Americaness, strong after World War II\nand September 11, 2001, are clearly fading, with Americans dividing into exclusive political\ntribes.\n48 Chapter 2: USA and the USSR The Soviet Union: Founding Through Stalinism\nThe Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR, or Soviet Union) was a multina-\ntional union under a socialist government which lasted from 1922 to 1991. The successor\nto the Russian Empire, it was comprised of fifteen different republics unified under a single\ngovernment in Moscow. As the world\u2019s first socialist country, it represented a major shift\nin world politics and power, and influenced millions worldwide while inspiring fear and\nhostility among the world\u2019s capitalist nations.\nThe Russian Revolution of 1905 brought few reforms to the Russian empire, and the\ncountry became a hotbed for political radicalism. Anarchists and various sorts of socialists\nvied for power, both against the Tsar and against each other. Russia\u2019s disastrous losses in\nWorld War I led to the Russian Revolution of 1917, in which the communist group known\nas the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, seized control of the country. For the next seven\nyears, the Bolsheviks fought against the anti-communist White Russians, other communist\ngroups who sought power, unaffiliated anticommunist rebels, and a foreign intervention by\nthe United States, France, Great Britain, and Japan. The Red Army defeated all these groups\nand established the absolute power of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, officially\nfounding the USSR in 1922. Lenin served as its first premier, but after his death in 1924,\na power struggle emerged within the government over who would be his successor. Josef\nStalin, General Secretary of the Russian Communist Party (RCP), proved victorious and\nbecame absolute leader of the USSR.\nStalin proceeded to build a cult of personality around himself; controlling all media,\nhe created a public persona as a far-seeing political visionary who would could solve all the\nnation\u2019s problems. His secret police disposed of those who remained unconvinced. From\n1927 to 1941, Stalin consolidated all political and social power into himself and attempted\nto transform the Soviet economy as per Marx\u2019s theories. He collectivized agriculture, seizing\nprivate farms and forming them into huge plantations administered by the state. This led to\nfamine in the early 1930s; it is debated whether Stalin caused this famine in order to elimi-\nnate by starvation the wealthier peasants whom he considered to be enemies of socialism.\nStalin also focused on industrialization and heavy industry, both sorely lacking in\nthe new nation. Since this was a true socialist economy, the government owned all means\nof production, including factories, and exercised complete control over them; independent\nworkers\u2019 unions were illegal. The vast industrialization program led to virtually zero unem-\nployment, although workers were compelled to work very long shifts in the factories, and\nlateness or absenteeism was punishable by prison time.\nEducation was greatly increased and illiteracy diminished. Women\u2019s rights in Soviet\nsociety were an improvement over Tsarism, with women entering the work force and at-\ntending school. Health care was made universal, immunization programs were established,\nand the average lifespan in the USSR was greatly improved.\nThe socialist government was highly antagonistic towards religion, particularly the\nRussian Orthodox Church. Marx believed that religion was a tool of bourgeoise exploita-\ntion, and the Soviet leadership declared atheism to be the national philosophy. Religious\ninstitutions of all sects were closed and the leaders often executed. During World War II,\nhowever, Stalin stopped persecuting the church, believing that religion would improve na-\ntional morale. The Soviet state in the 1930s was also infamous for its censorship of print\nmaterials and other media, and permitted no ideas not approved by the state.\nDuring World War II, Stalin successfully engineered a change in Russian identity.\nBefore the war, Soviet identity was supposedly based on a shared, classless socialist society,\nrather than on ethnicity or religion, as was the case in most countries. This was thought\nto neutralize the nationalism of non-Russians (Ukrainians, Uzbeks, etc.) and make them\nmore amenable to socialist control. But, during the war, Stalin believed that identity based\n49 on ideology was insufficient, and decided to promote nationalistic sentiments (among the\nRussians, at least) to strengthen morale. He believed that people were more likely to fight\nfor a nation than for an ideology, and it seemed the gamble paid off. After the war, Soviet\ncitizens were both nationalists and communists, quite against the teachings of Marx, who\nwas ardently anti-nationalist. Stalin, dealing with real people rather than political theories,\nwas forced to be more pragmatic than the German philosopher.\nAfter the war, a certain d\u00e9tente was established between the Soviet government and\nwhat the West would call the \u201cmiddle class\u201d of the USSR. These citizens, usually technical\nexperts or government bureaucrats, demanded a degree of freedom from the state in return\nfor their loyalty and sacrifice during the war. The state needed their technical expertise to\nbuild a strong nation, and they knew it. Therefore, the state would often turn a blind eye to\nthe increasing materialism of this class (sometimes manifesting as embezzlement, smug-\ngling, and long vacations in rural dachas), as well as allowing them to read romance novels\nand watch foreign films, both of which were previously banned. Stalin was not an idealogue\nand he was not stupid. He acquiesced when necessary. Therefore, viewing the USSR as an\nOrwellian state where the government had complete control is not quite accurate; the gov-\nernment mostly kept control, and allowed for a certain amount of freedom, simply because\nit lacked the power to dominate everyone all the time.\nFinally, Stalin, who was notably paranoid and fearful, continuously sought to\nimprison or kill anyone who opposed him, or even had sufficient power and prestige to\npossibly oppose him. About three-quarters of a million people were accused of sedition and\nexecuted in the Great Purge of the late 1930s, while another million were sentenced to hard\nlabor in the gulags (prison camps). Many of those \u201cpurged\u201d were officers of the Red Army;\nthe lack of experienced military leaders would prove a serious problem for the USSR in\nWorld War II.\nWorld War II (Chapter 1)\nWorkers imprisoned in a Soviet gulag in the 1930s.\ndevastated the USSR; one-\nthird of all wartime casu-\nalties were Soviet, mainly\ncivilians. Industry and in-\nfrastructure were destroyed\nin the fighting. Stalin had\nsuspected that Hitler would\ninvade the USSR, but was\nnot expecting the attack so\nsoon. The country had not\neven mobilized its troops for\nwar and was unprepared for\nthe attack. However, Stalin\u2019s\nindustrialization plan in the\n1930s had given the Soviet\nUnion the necessary facto-\nries to produce the arma-\nments necessary for victory.\nThe Red Army took Berlin\nin May 1945, ending the\nEuropean theatre of the war.\n50 Chapter 2: USA and the USSR After the war, in contravention of the Declaration of United Nations, Stalin refused\nto allow the nations occupied by the USSR to freely choose their own governments, instead\nopting to create socialist governments vetted by the USSR to run those countries. This ef-\nfectively turned them into \u201csatellite states,\u201d subservient to the USSR. This convinced the\nWestern democracies that Stalin was attempting to conquer Western Europe, or perhaps\nthe entire world \u2013 an accusation which was patently false, but nonetheless compelling in the\nWest (see Chapter 3 for more information). Stalin\u2019s plan was to use the satellite countries as\na buffer zone against a feared capitalist attack on the USSR, as well as exploit the resources\nand industries of those countries. Finally, the old Russian urge to dominate Eastern Europe,\ngoing back to the Tsars, no doubt played into Stalin\u2019s plans. Nevertheless, Stalin was more\nafraid of the West than it was of him. Stalin did, however, end up providing material sup-\nport to North Korea during the Korean War, although he was initially hesitant to do so, for\nfear of provoking war with the West (see Chapter 3).\nThe Soviet Union: the Khrushchev Era\nStalin died in March 1953. He had left no handpicked successor, nor established\na method for the transfer of power. The Central Committee of the Communist Party met\nimmediately and established a system of collective leadership among the top eight party\nmembers, including First Secretary of the Central Committee, Nikita Khrushchev, and\nGeorgi Malenkov, the new Premier of the Soviet Union. These leaders agreed that Stalin\u2019s\ncult of personality was bad for the USSR and were determined to prevent another one from\narising. But this group also began to fight among themselves for control of Soviet policy \u2013\nand not all of them would survive.\nFirst Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Lavrentiy Beria, had been\nchief of internal security and the secret police under Josef Stalin. Perhaps surprisingly, after\nStalin\u2019s death, he urged a liberalization of policy, such as releasing non-political prisoners,\nending torture of prisoners, and withdrawing from Eastern Europe. His nemesis, Nikita\nKhrushchev, did not believe that Beria was honest about his liberalization plans and hated\nthe idea of abandoning Eastern Europe, as he was staunchly anti-capitalist. Therefore, with\nthe help of the army, Khrushchev engineered a coup against Beria, accusing him of treason\nand arresting, then executing him, after a show trial. Beria\u2019s secret police were reorganized\nas the KGB so that they would never again be controlled by anyone but the Communist\nParty leadership. Finally, after out-maneuvering the other members of the committee,\nKhrushchev became the guiding hand of the Soviet government, although collective leader-\nship nominally continued to function.\nKhrushchev shocked not just the Soviet Union, but the entire world, in 1956.\nDuring the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev de-\nnounced Stalin\u2019s crimes and cult of personality, as well as those who helped him carry them\nout. He also stated that he did not think that war between capitalism and communism was\ninevitable, but rather that the USSR should peacefully compete with the West to demon-\nstrate which system was better. This started a period called De-Stalinization, and sent\nshock waves through the USSR. Some truly believed Stalin was a great hero and denounced\nKhrushchev; others agreed with his appraisal of Stalin, but questioned why Khrushchev and\nothers had either abetted Stalin at the time, or waited so long to denounce him. Khrushchev\ndid follow some of Beria\u2019s advice and released over a million prisoners.\nA political faction within the Communist Party, known as the \u201cAnti-Party Group,\u201d\ntried to remove Khrushchev and restore Stalin\u2019s policies; Khrushchev defeated this group\nin the Politburo, but did not imprison or execute them (perhaps the Stalinists appreciat-\ned Khrushchev\u2019s new policies a bit more after that). Having defeated his Stalinist rivals,\n51 Khrushchev was elected Premier of the Soviet Union in 1958 and consolidated the lion\u2019s\nshare of political power in himself, although he never ruled with the same absolutism as\nStalin.\nDe-Stalinization included reforms in economic planning. Khrushchev reduced\nStalin\u2019s obsession with heavy industry for the military and focused more on consumer\ngoods for the common man, improving both the economy and the quality of life in the\nUSSR. Other economic policies were mediocre at best, such as Khrushchev\u2019s strange plan to\ngrow corn in Siberia and drought-prone virgin lands in Central Asia. Industrial output was\nunimpressive, although the USSR launched the first artificial satellite in 1957 and put the\nfirst man in space in 1961, igniting the Space Race.\nProbably the greatest effect of De-Stalinization was that it shattered the na\u00efve view\nof Stalin and the USSR which was still held by so many, including Western communists.\nChinese and North Korean leadership, however, remained enamored with the memory of\nStalin and criticized Khrushchev. This was another break in global communist unity.\nKhrushchev was not very successful in foreign relations. De-Stalinization did\nnot include a change in relations with Warsaw Pact countries; Khrushchev had no plans\nto liberate Eastern Europe, as Beria had suggested. He brutally suppressed an uprising in\nHungary in 1956, (see Chapter 3) and was unable to persuade communist Yugoslavia to\njoin the Soviet orbit; that nation remained neutral in the Cold War. And while Khrushchev\nhoped to forge a good relationship with the United States, President Kennedy distrusted\nhim. In 1962, this animosity blossomed into the Cuban Missile Crisis (see Chapter 3) which\nnearly ended in war between the two countries.\nThe Soviet Union: Brezhnev\u2019s Tenure\nIn 1964, the Politburo removed Khrushchev from power due to the failure of his\neconomic reforms, his increasingly autocratic methods, and for nearly getting the USSR\ninto a war over Cuba. Leonid Brezhnev was made the First Secretary of the Communist\nParty and, although he had to rule within the confines of collective leadership, was the man\nwho guided Soviet policy until his death in 1982. This period, from 1964 to 1982, became\nknown as a period of stability, although Soviet politician Mikhail Gorbachev derisively\nnamed it the \u201cEra of Stagnation\u201d for its economic sluggishness and calcified leadership and\npolicies.\nThe Soviet economy was moribund in the last days of Khrushchev\u2019s reign; Brezhnev\nnow instituted economic reforms to stimulate the economy. These changes were incremen-\ntal, rather than radical, and involved the decentralization of economic planning. Although\nthese reforms had some initial success, Soviet leadership disapproved, since allowing region-\nal leaders to run their own economic affairs restricted the power of the Central Committee\nin Moscow. When the leaders chose to ignore the reforms and retain power, they found that\nmaking all economic decisions within a command economy was a task beyond their bu-\nreaucratic abilities. The economy began to decline, and corruption and black marketeering\nwere rife in the USSR.\nBrezhnev and his fellow leaders in the Kremlin did manage to stabilize the Soviet\nUnion, avoiding major political upheavals, but it soon became clear that they had over-cor-\nrected. The USSR developed into a gerontocracy, meaning rule by the oldest men. Soviet\nleadership was very conservative, becoming more and more resistant to reform. This led\nto a selection method in politics in which older, more conservative administrators were\nappointed to new posts, rather than reform-minded younger men. Soon, the average age\nof the Kremlin\u2019s top executives was seventy-one years, and fresh economic and social ideas\nwere nowhere to be seen. The military, which had attained parity with the United States in\n52 Chapter 2: USA and the USSR the early 1970s, was becoming a tremendous expense for the USSR (though the Americans\nwere having the same problem with their own military). Still, the Red Army was a powerful\npolitical force, believed to be the only protection against capitalist aggression; this meant\nthat the defense budget could not be cut, and began to bleed the Soviet economy dry.\nEarly in his tenure, Brezhnev enjoyed some small successes with the United States,\nsuch as arms control talks and other treaties. Relations with China remained poor, as Mao\nZedong viewed himself, not Brezhnev, as the proper leader of global communism. After\nthe Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 (see Chapter 13), Soviet relations with the\nUnited States sharply declined, as President Carter perceived the attack as expansionistic.\nRelations between the United States and the USSR remained poor until the term of Mikhail\nGorbachev in 1985.\nLife in the Soviet Union during this period was an improvement over Stalinist days.\nThe Soviet economy improved until the early 1970s, with more consumer goods available\nfor the average citizen. But after the failure of economic reforms, the economy declined\nstarting in about 1973. The Soviet industrial base was much more primitive than that of the\nWest, so manufactured items were less plentiful and more expensive (also explaining why\nthe USSR had to sink so much money into defense; with more advanced machinery, it was\nsimply cheaper for the West to make all those weapons).\nMost Soviet citizens, having no political recourse for change, simply accepted their\nlot and did the best they could. Certain brave citizens did publicly criticize the system, most\nnotably author Alexander Solzhenitsyn, who ended up being exiled from the country, but\nsuch dissidents rarely had a lasting effect on society. One important change came with the\nsigning of the Helsinki Accords (see Chapter 3), in which the Soviet government promised\ntheir citizens certain human rights which they never actually permitted. This exposed the\nhypocrisy of the Soviet system, causing people to lose even more respect for their govern-\nment.\nThe Soviet agricultural sector was so weak that the USSR had to import wheat\nfrom the United States \u2013 a terrible embarrassment for the country. Women lined up for\nhours daily to wait for scarce products at supermarkets. Professional life was stagnant, with\npoor wages, long hours, and lack of promotion opportunity. Alcoholism was rampant, as\nwere divorce and suicide. The average lifespan decreased. People took comfort within a\npopular non-socialist culture which was tolerated, but not sanctioned, by the government.\nFor example, people listened to Western radio and TV programs, took a liking to Western\nrock music (especially the Beatles), and sought out Western products (denim jeans were\nparticularly valued). The government even tolerated some homegrown Soviet rock music\nand locally-produced jeans. Still, a sort of fatalistic despondency settled over the country,\nwith people doing the minimum required to satisfy their bosses. With a government policy\nof zero-percent unemployment, lazy or incompetent workers were typically moved around\ninstead of fired, so workers figured they had nothing to lose by slacking off. The famous\nSoviet expression was, \u201cWe pretend to work, they pretend to pay us.\u201d\nThe Soviet Union: Gorbachev and the Dissolution of the USSR\nAfter Brezhnev died in 1982, he was replaced by Yuri Andropov, who died only\ntwo years later. Next came Konstantin Chernenko; that elderly statesman lived only an-\nother year. These two leaders made no significant changes to the Soviet system. Finally, in\nMarch 1985, the Politburo decided it needed a younger, more dynamic leader to save the\nfailing economy. Mikhail Gorbachev, only fifty-four years old, was groomed for the post\nof General Secretary by Andropov and had little competition in the Politburo. Gorbachev\nplanned to revive the USSR by implementing radical reforms while still retaining the basic\n53 socialist system. What he would soon discover was that he could only do one or the other.\nKnowing that the old guard would prevent him from making significant changes, he im-\nmediately removed a great many government administrators, replacing them with younger,\nmore talented people. Gorbachev\u2019s policies were called perestroika (political and economic\nreform and restructuring) and glasnost (\u201copenness\u201d). Gorbachev realized that, in a com-\nmand economy, economic reform and development could not come without a degree of\npolitical restructuring. Therefore, perestroika included such elements as some privatization\nof business, and even multiparty elections, although both were against Marxist-Leninist\nprinciples. Glasnost meant fewer controls on the media, allowing for open discussion\nof social and political affairs in contrast to the censorship of the past. Gorbachev hoped\nthat these reforms would revive the Soviet economy. But Gorbachev\u2019s most impactful\npolicy was the new relationship between the USSR and the Warsaw Pact countries. One of\nGorbachev\u2019s signature polices was informally known as the \u201cSinatra Doctrine,\u201d in which\nWarsaw Pact countries would be permitted to leave the Soviet orbit if they chose to do so,\nin direct contravention of the old Soviet policy which had suppressed revolts in Hungary\nand Czechoslovakia. (The name was a reference to Frank Sinatra\u2019s song \u201cMy Way,\u201d since the\nWarsaw Pact countries would be allowed to go their own way.)\nThe Sinatra Doctrine would prove one of the most consequential in European his-\ntory. In 1989, a Polish pro-democracy independence party (Solidarity) participated in, and\nwon, the first multiparty elections in Poland since before World War II (see Chapter 13).\nGorbachev, under the new doctrine, refused to intervene in Polish affairs, and Solidarity\nembraced democracy and capitalism and exited the Warsaw Pact. Very quickly, the rest of\nEastern Europe responded; the Berlin Wall was torn down and both Germanies reunited as\na democracy. The other socialist nations of the Warsaw Pact did so as well (see Chapter 13),\nand the Pact was dissolved.\nNow came a reckoning in the Soviet Union itself. It started with a strong nation-\nalist resurgence in the various republics of the USSR; people wanted their independence\nfrom the USSR and self-governance as sovereign nations. Riots broke out in several places.\nGorbachev did not want to dissolve the USSR into its constituent republics, but only to\nallow more freedom within the existing system. His problem was that too few people in the\nUSSR wanted the system to continue; they wanted to use their new freedoms to push for\nindependence and an end to the Soviet empire. Their own national identities had survived\nthe Soviet effort to drown them within a unified socialist identity, and now they wanted\ntheir own countries back.\nWith this wellspring of nationalism unleashed, Gorbachev quickly lost control of\nthe situation. In August 1991, a group of hardcore communists attempted a coup against\nthe government in order to reverse the reforms and growing nationalism; Gorbachev was\ndetained but refused to relinquish power. Boris Yeltsin, President of the Russian Republic,\nopposed the coup and led the resistance to the coup plotters. In the face of overwhelming\npublic resistance, the coup plotters surrendered and Gorbachev was released.\nHowever, Yeltsin was now extremely popular in Russia and, as a nationalist, pushed\nfor the dissolution of the USSR. He even began to unilaterally take Russia out of the Soviet\nUnion, in direct opposition to Gorbachev. By mid-December 1991, Gorbachev had to\nadmit defeat. On December 26, the Soviet leadership voted to dissolve the USSR into its\nconstituent republics. That officially occurred at midnight, December 31 1991. The Soviet\nUnion was no more.\n54 Chapter 2: USA and the USSR Soviet Union: Conclusion\nThe USSR was founded as the world\u2019s first Marxist-Leninist state and was intended\nto create a classless society and guide the way to true communism. It was perhaps the grand-\nest social experiment ever carried out. However, the USSR demonstrated the weaknesses\ninherent in Marxism. Marxism intends to eliminate nationalism and religion and replace\nthem with an internationalist, universalist view of mankind. The USSR failed to eliminate\neither of these ideologies; and nationalism, in particular, was critical to the overthrow of the\nsocialist government. The command economy of the USSR was unable to compete success-\nfully with Western capitalism. Socialist governments do continue to this day, most notably\nin China, North Korea, Vietnam, and Cuba.\nCompared to the United States, the history of the USSR is deeply tied to the policies\nof its leaders. Certainly, the policies of American political leaders deeply impact society; but\nin a democracy, other segments of society (churches, unions, business, the media, etc.) also\ncontribute to and influence the wider society, making American culture a complex environ-\nment, difficult for any single sector to dominate. The Soviet Union\u2019s command economy,\nstrict censorship, and police state meant that political leaders such as Stalin held tremen-\ndous power over Soviet culture, so that a single individual could shape the nation\u2019s destiny,\nfor better or worse.\nSuggested Further Reading\nThe Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II by Iris Chang (Ishi Press, 2012, ISBN-13: 978-\n4871872188).\nAmerican Dreams: The United States Since 1945 by H.

We expressed understanding that honest\nconvictions in racial matters could properly be pursued in the courts, but urged that decisions of those courts\nshould in the meantime be peacefully obeyed.\nSince that time there had been some evidence of increased forbearance and a willingness to face facts.\nResponsible citizens have undertaken to work on various problems which cause racial friction and unrest. In\nBirmingham, recent public events have given indication that we all have opportunity for a new constructive\nand realistic approach to racial problems.\nHowever, we are now confronted by a series of demonstrations by some of our Negro citizens, directed and led\nin part by outsiders. We recognize the natural impatience of people who feel that their hopes are slow in being\nrealized. But we are convinced that these demonstrations are unwise and untimely.\nWe agree rather with certain local Negro leadership [opposed to MLK\u2019s tactics]which has called for honest\nand open negotiation of racial issues in our area. And we believe this kind of facing of issues can best be\naccomplished by citizens of our own metropolitan area, white and Negro, meeting with their knowledge and\nexperience of the local situation. All of us need to face that responsibility and find proper channels for its\naccomplishment.\nJust as we formerly pointed out that \u201chatred and violence have no sanction in our religious and political\ntraditions,\u201d we also point out that such actions as incite to hatred and violence, however technically peaceful\nthose actions may be, have not contributed to the resolution of our local problems. We do not believe that these\ndays of new hope are days when extreme measures are justified in Birmingham.\nWe commend the community as a whole, and the local news media and law enforcement officials in particular,\non the calm manner in which these demonstrations have been handled. We urge the public to continue to show\nrestraint should the demonstrations continue, and the law enforcement officials to remain calm and continue to\nprotect our city from violence.\nWe further strongly urge our own Negro community to withdraw support from these demonstrations, and\nto unite locally in working peacefully for a better Birmingham. When rights are consistently denied, a cause\nshould be pressed in the courts and in negotiations among local leaders, and not in the streets. We appeal to\nboth our white and Negro citizenry to observe the principles of law and order and common sense.\nApril 12, 1963\n60 Chapter 2: USA and the USSR Excerpts from The Feminine Mystique (1963)\nby Betty Friedan\nThe problem lay buried, unspoken, for many years in the minds of American women. It was a strange stirring,\na sense of dissatisfaction, a yearning that women suffered in the middle of the twentieth century in the United\nStates. Each suburban wife struggled with it alone. As she made the beds, shopped for groceries, matched\nslipcover material, ate peanut butter sandwiches with her children, chauffeured Cub Scouts and Brownies, lay\nbeside her husband at night\u2014she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question\u2014Is this all?\u201d\nFor over fifteen years there was no word of this yearning in the millions of words written about women, for\nwomen, in all the columns, books and articles by experts telling women their role was to seek fulfillment as\nwives and mothers. Over and over women heard in voices of tradition and of Freudian sophistication that they\ncould desire no greater destiny than to glory in their own femininity. Experts told them how to catch a man\nand keep him, how to breastfeed children and handle their toilet training, how to cope with sibling rivalry\nand adolescent rebellion; how to buy a dishwasher, bake bread, cook gourmet snails, and build a swimming\npool with their own hands; how to dress, look, and act more feminine and make marriage more exciting; how\nto keep their husbands from dying young and their sons from growing into delinquents. They were taught\nto pity the neurotic, unfeminine, unhappy women who wanted to be poets or physicists or presidents. They\nlearned that truly feminine women do not want careers, higher education, political rights\u2014the independence\nand the opportunities that the old-fashioned feminists fought for. Some women, in their forties and fifties, still\nremembered painfully giving up those dreams, but more of the younger women no longer thought about them.\nA thousand expert voices applauded their femininity, their adjustment, their new maturity. All they had to do\nwas devote their lives from earliest girlhood to finding a husband and bearing children.\nBy the end of the nineteen-fifties, the average marriage age of women in America dropped to 20, and was\nstill dropping, into the teens. Fourteen million girls were engaged by 17. The proportion of women attending\ncollege in comparison with men dropping from 47 per cent in 1920 to 35 per cent in 1958. A century earlier,\nwomen had fought for higher education, now girls went to college to get a husband. By the mid-fifties, 60 per\ncent dropped out of college to marry, or because they were afraid too much education would be a marriage bar.\nColleges built dormitories for \u201cmarried students,\u201d but the students were almost always the husbands. A new\ndegree was instituted for the wives\u2014\u201dPh.T.\u201d (Putting Husband Through)....\nBy the end of the fifties, the United States birthrate was overtaking India\u2019s. The birth- control movement,\nrenamed Planned Parenthood, was asked to find a method whereby women who had been advised that a third\nor fourth baby would be born dead or defective might have it anyhow. Statisticians were especially astounded at\nthe fantastic increase in the number of babies among college women. Where once they had two children, now\nthey had four, five, six. Women who had once wanted careers were now making careers out of having babies.\nSo rejoiced Life magazine in a 1956 paean to the movement of American women back to the home.\nIn a New York hospital, a woman had a nervous breakdown when she found she could not breastfeed her baby.\nIn other hospitals, women dying of cancer refused a drug which research had proved might save their lives: its\nside effects were said to be unfeminine. \u201cIf I have only one life, let me live it as a blonde, \u201c a larger-than-life-\nsized picture of a pretty, vacuous woman proclaimed from newspaper, magazine, and drugstore ads. And across\nAmerica, three out of every ten women dyed their hair blonde. They ate a chalk called Metrecal, instead of\nfood, to shrink to the size of the thin young models. Department-store buyers reported that American women,\nsince 1939, had become three and four sizes smaller. \u201cWomen are out to fit the clothes, instead of vice-versa,\u201d\none buyer said.\nInterior decorators were designing kitchens with mosaic murals and original paintings, for kitchens were once\nagain the center of women\u2019s lives. Home sewing became a million-dollar industry. Many women no longer\n61 left their homes, except to shop, chauffeur their children, or attend a social engagement with their husbands.\nGirls were growing up in America without ever having jobs outside the home. In the late fifties, a sociological\nphenomenon was suddenly remarked: a third of American women now worked, but most were no longer\nyoung and very few were pursuing careers. They were married women who held part-time jobs, selling or\nsecretarial, to put their husbands through school, their sons through college, or to help pay the mortgage. Or\nthey were widows supporting families. Fewer and fewer women were entering professional work. The shortages\nin the nursing, social work, and teaching professions caused crises in almost every American city. Concerned\nover the Soviet Union\u2019s lead in the space race, scientists noted that America\u2019s greatest source of unused brain-\npower was women. But girls would not study physics: it was \u201cunfeminine.\u201d A girl refused a science fellowship at\nJohns Hopkins to take a job in a real- estate office. All she wanted, she said, was what every other American girl\nwanted\u2014to get married, have four children and live in a nice house in a nice suburb.\nThe suburban housewife\u2014she was the dream image of the young American women and the envy, it was said,\nof women all over the world. The American housewife\u2014freed by science and labor-saving appliances from the\ndrudgery, the dangers of childbirth and the illnesses of her grandmother. She was healthy, beautiful, educated,\nconcerned only about her husband, her children, her home. She had found true feminine fulfillment. As a\nhousewife and mother, she was respected as a full and equal partner to man in his world. She was free to\nchoose automobiles, clothes, appliances, supermarkets; she had everything that women ever dreamed of.\nIn the fifteen years after World War II, this mystique of feminine fulfillment became the cherished and self-\nperpetuating core of contemporary American culture. Millions of women lived their lives in the image of those\npretty pictures of the American suburban housewife, kissing their husbands goodbye in front of the picture\nwindow, depositing their stationwagonsful of children at school, and smiling as they ran the new electric waxer\nover the spotless kitchen floor. They baked their own bread, sewed their own and their children\u2019s clothes,\nkept their new washing machines and dryers running all day. They changed the sheets on the beds twice a\nweek instead of once, took the rug-hooking class in adult education, and pitied their poor frustrated mothers,\nwho had dreamed of having a career. Their only dream was to be perfect wives and mothers; their highest\nambition to have five children and a beautiful house, their only fight to get and keep their husbands. They had\nno thought for the unfeminine problems of the world outside the home; they wanted the men to make the\nmajor decisions. They gloried in their role as women, and wrote proudly on the census blank: \u201cOccupation:\nhousewife.\u201d...\nIf the woman had a problem in the 1950\u2019s and 1960\u2019s, she knew that something must be wrong with her\nmarriage, or with herself. Other women were satisfied with their lives, she thought. What kind of a woman was\nshe if she did not feel this mysterious fulfillment waxing the kitchen floor? She was so ashamed to admit her\ndissatisfaction that she never knew how many other women shared it....\nBut on an April morning in 1959, I heard a mother of four, having coffee with four other mothers in a\nsuburban development fifteen miles from New York, say in a tone of quiet desperation, \u201cthe problem.\u201d And the\nothers knew, without words, that she was not talking about a problem with her husband, or her children, or her\nhome. Suddenly they realized they all shared the same problem, the problem that has no name. They began,\nhesitantly, to talk about it. Later, after they had picked up their children at nursery school and taken them\nhome to nap, two of the women cried, in sheer relief, just to know they were not alone.\nGradually I came to realize that the problem that has no name was shared by countless women in America.\nAs a magazine writer I often interviewed women about problems with their children, or their marriages,\nor their houses, or their communities. But after a while I began to recognize the telltale signs of this other\nproblem. I saw the same signs in suburban ranch houses and split-levels on Long Island and in New Jersey and\nWestchester County; in colonial houses in a small Massachusetts town; on patios in Memphis; in surburban\n62 Chapter 2: USA and the USSR and city apartments; in living rooms in the Midwest. Sometimes I sensed the problem, not as a reporter, but\nas a suburban housewife, for during this time I was also bringing up my own three children in Rockland\nCounty, New York. I heard echoes of the problem in college dormitories and semi-private maternity wards, at\nPTA meetings and luncheons of the League of Women Voters, at suburban cocktail parties, in station wagons\nwaiting for trains, and in snatches of conversation overheard at Schrafft\u2019s. The groping words I heard from\nother women, on quiet afternoons when children were at school or on quiet evenings when husbands worked\nlate, I think I understood first as a woman long before I understood their larger social and psychological\nimplications.\nJust what was this problem that has no name? What were the words women used when they tried to express\nit? Sometimes a woman would say \u201cI feel empty somehow ... incomplete.\u201d Or she would say, \u201cI feel as if I don\u2019t\nexist.\nSometimes she blotted out the feeling with a tranquilizer....\nIt is no longer possible to ignore that voice, to dismiss the desperation of so many American women. This is\nnot what being a woman means, no matter what the experts say. For human suffering there is a reason; perhaps\nthe reason has not been found because the right questions have not been asked, or pressed far enough. I do\nnot accept the answer that there is no problem because American women have luxuries that women in other\ntimes and lands never dreamed of; part of the strange newness of the problem is that it cannot be understood\nin terms of the age-old material problems of man: poverty, sickness, hunger, cold. The women who suffer this\nproblem have a hunger that food cannot fill. It persists in women whose husbands are struggling interns and\nlaw clerks, or prosperous doctors and lawyers; in wives of workers and executives who make $5,000 a year or\n$50,000. It is not caused by lack of material advantages; it may not even be felt by women preoccupied with\ndesperate problems of hunger, poverty or illness. And women who think it will be solved by more money, a\nbigger house, a second car, moving to a better suburb, often discover it gets worse.\nIt is no longer possible today to blame the problem on loss of femininity: to say that education and\nindependence and equality with men have made American women unfeminine. I have heard so many women\ntry to deny this dissatisfied voice within themselves because it does not fit the pretty picture of femininity\nthe experts have given them. I think, in fact, that this is the first clue to the mystery: the problem cannot be\nunderstood in the generally accepted terms by which scientists have studied women, doctors have treated them,\ncounselors have advised them, and writers have written about them. Women who suffer this problem, in whom\nthis voice is stirring, have lived their whole lives in the pursuit of feminine fulfillment. They are not career\nwomen (although career women may have other problems); they are women whose greatest ambition has been\nmarriage and children. For the oldest of these women, these daughters of the American middle class, no other\ndream was possible. The ones in their forties and fifties who once had other dreams gave them up and threw\nthemselves joyously into life as housewives. For the youngest, the new wives and mothers, this was the only\ndream. They are the ones who quit high school and college to marry, or marked time in some job in which they\nhad no real interest until they married. These women are very \u201cfeminine\u201d in the usual sense, and yet they still\nsuffer the problem....\nIf I am right, the problem that has no name stirring in the minds of so many American women today is not\na matter of loss of femininity or too much education, or the demands of domesticity. It is far more important\nthan anyone recognizes. It is the key to these other new and old problems which have been torturing women\nand their husbands and children, and puzzling their doctors and educators for years. It may well be the key\nto our future as a nation and a culture. We can no longer ignore that voice within women that says: \u201cI want\nsomething more than my husband and my children and my home.\u201d\nFriedan, Betty. The Feminine Mystique. NY: W. W. Norton & Company, 2013.\n63 Nixon\u2019s Vietnamization Speech (Excerpts)\n. . . Tonight I want to talk to you on a subject of deep concern to all Americans and to many people in all parts\nof the world - the war in Vietnam.\nI believe that one of the reasons for the deep division about Vietnam is that many Americans have lost\nconfidence in what their Government has told them about our policy. The American people cannot and should\nnot be asked to support a policy which involves the overriding issues of war and peace unless they know the\ntruth about that policy . . . .\nIn January I could only conclude that the precipitate withdrawal of American forces from Vietnam would be a\ndisaster not only for South Vietnam but for the United States and for the cause of peace.\nFor the South Vietnamese, our precipitate withdrawal would inevitably allow the Communists to repeat the\nmassacres which followed their takeover in the North fifteen years before. . . .\nFor the United States, this first defeat in our nation\u2019s history would result in a collapse of confidence in\nAmerican leadership not only in Asia but throughout the world.\nThree American Presidents have recognized the great stakes involved in Vietnam and understood what had to\nbe done. . . .\nFor the future of peace, precipitate withdrawal would thus be a disaster of immense magnitude.\n- A nation cannot remain great if it betrays its allies and lets down its friends.\n- Our defeat and humiliation in South Vietnam without question would promote recklessness in the\ncouncils of those great powers who have not yet abandoned their goals of world conquest.\n- This would spark violence wherever our commitments help maintain the peace - in the Middle East, in\nBerlin, eventually even in the Western Hemisphere.\nUltimately, this would cost more lives. It would not bring peace; it would bring more war.\nFor these reasons I rejected the recommendation that I should end the war by immediately withdrawing all our\nforces. I chose instead to change American policy on both the negotiating front and the battlefront.\nIn order to end a war fought on many fronts, I initiated a pursuit for peace on many fronts.\nIn a television speech on May 14, in a speech before the United Nations, and on a number of other occasions, I\nset forth our peace proposals in great detail.\n- We have offered the complete withdrawal of all outside forces within one year.\n- We have proposed a cease-fire under international supervision.\n- We have offered free elections under international supervision, with the Communists participating in\nthe organization and conduct of the elections as an organized political force. The Saigon Government has\n64 Chapter 2: USA and the USSR pledged to accept the result of the elections.\nMy fellow Americans, I am sure you can recognize from what I have said that we really only have two choices\nopen to us if we want to end this war:\n- I can order an immediate, precipitate withdrawal of all Americans from Vietnam without regard to the\neffects of that action.\n- Or we can persist in our search for a just peace, through a negotiated settlement if possible or through\ncontinued implementation of our plan for Vietnamization if necessary - a plan in which we will withdraw\nall of our forces from Vietnam on a schedule in accordance with our program, as the South Vietnamese\nbecome strong enough to defend their own freedom.\nI have chosen this second course. It is not the easy way. It is the right way. It is a plan which will end the war\nand serve the cause of peace, not just in Vietnam, but in the Pacific and in the world.\nIn speaking of the consequences of a precipitate withdrawal, I mentioned that our allies would lose confidence\nin America.\nFar more dangerous, we would lose confidence in ourselves. Oh, the immediate reaction would be a sense\nof relief that our men were coming home. But as we saw the consequences of what we had done, inevitable\nremorse and divisive recrimination would scar our spirit as a people.\nWe have faced other crises in our history and have become stronger by rejecting the easy way out and taking\nthe right way in meeting our challenges. Our greatness as a nation has been our capacity to do what had to be\ndone when we knew our course was right.\nI recognize that some of my fellow citizens disagree with the plan for peace I have chosen. . . . I would be untrue\nto my oath of office if I allowed the policy of this nation to be dictated by the minority who hold that point and\nwho try to impose it on the Nation by mounting demonstrations in the street.\nFor almost two hundred years, the policy of this nation has been made under our Constitution by those leaders\nin the Congress and in the White House elected by all of the people. If a vocal minority, however fervent its\ncause, prevails over reason and the will of the majority, this nation has no future as a free society.\nAnd now I would like to address a word, if I may, to the young people of this nation who are particularly\nconcerned - and I understand why they are concerned - about this war.\nI respect your idealism.\nI share your concern for peace.\nI want peace as much as you do. . . .\nI have chosen a plan for peace, I believe it will succeed.\nIf it does succeed, what the critics say now won\u2019t matter. If it does not succeed, anything I say then won\u2019t matter.\nLet historians not record that when America was the most powerful nation in the world we passed on the other\nside of the road and allowed the last hopes for peace and freedom of millions of people to be suffocated by the\nforces of totalitarianism. . . .\n65 Ronald Reagan, First Inaugural Address (1981)\nThese United States are confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions. We suffer from the longest\nand one of the worst sustained inflations in our national history. It distorts our economic decisions, penalizes\nthrift, and crushes the struggling young and the fixed-income elderly alike. It threatens to shatter the lives of\nmillions of our people.\nIdle industries have cast workers into unemployment, causing human misery and personal indignity. Those\nwho do work are denied a fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes successful achievement\nand keeps us from maintaining full productivity.\nBut great as our tax burden is, it has not kept pace with public spending. For decades, we have piled deficit\nupon deficit, mortgaging our future and our children\u2019s future for the temporary convenience of the present. To\ncontinue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous social, cultural, political, and economic upheavals.\nYou and I, as individuals, can, by borrowing, live beyond our means, but for only a limited period of time.\nWhy, then, should we think that collectively, as a nation, we are not bound by that same limitation?\nWe must act today in order to preserve tomorrow. And let there be no misunderstanding - we are going to begin\nto act, beginning today.\nThe economic ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades. They will not go away in days, weeks, or\nmonths, but they will go away. They will go away because we, as Americans, have the capacity now, as we have\nhad in the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom.\nIn this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.\nFrom time to time, we have been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by\nself-rule, that government by an elite group is superior over government for, by, and of the people. But if no\none among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else? All\nof us together, in and out of government, must bear the burden. The solutions we seek must be equitable, with\nno one group singled out to pay a higher price.\nWe hear much of special interest groups. Our concern must be for a special interest group that has been too\nlong neglected. It knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions, and it crosses political party\nlines. It is made up of men and women who raise our food, patrol our streets, man our mines and our factories,\nteach our children, keep our homes, and heal us when we are sick - professionals, industrialists, shopkeepers,\nclerks, cabbies, and truckdrivers. They are, in short, \u201cWe the people,\u201d this breed called Americans.\nWell, this administration\u2019s objective will be a healthy, vigorous, growing economy that provides equal\nopportunity for all Americans, with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination. Putting America back to\nwork means putting all Americans back to work. Ending inflation means freeing all Americans from the terror\nof runaway living costs. All must share in the productive work of this \u201cnew beginning\u201d and all must share in\nthe bounty of a revived economy. With the idealism and fair play which are the core of our system and our\nstrength, we can have a strong and prosperous America at peace with itself and the world.\nSo, as we begin, let us take inventory. We are a nation that has a government - not the other way around. And\nthis makes us special among the nations of the Earth. Our government has no power except that granted it\nby the people. It is time to check and reverse the growth of government which shows signs of having grown\nbeyond the consent of the governed.\n66 Chapter 2: USA and the USSR It is my intention to curb the size and influence of the Federal establishment and to demand recognition of the\ndistinction between the powers granted to the Federal Government and those reserved to the States or to the\npeople. All of us need to be reminded that the Federal Government did not create the States; the States created\nthe Federal Government.\nNow, so there will be no misunderstanding, it is not my intention to do away with government. It is, rather, to\nmake it work - work with us, not over us; to stand by our side, not ride on our back. Government can and must\nprovide opportunity, not smother it; foster productivity, not stifle it.\nIf we look to the answer as to why, for so many years, we achieved so much, prospered as no other people on\nEarth, it was because here, in this land, we unleashed the energy and individual genius of man to a greater\nextent than has ever been done before. Freedom and the dignity of the individual have been more available and\nassured here than in any other place on Earth. The price for this freedom at times has been high, but we have\nnever been unwilling to pay that price.\nIt is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are proportionate to the intervention and intrusion\nin our lives that result from unnecessary and excessive growth of government. It is time for us to realize that we\nare too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams. We are not, as some would have us believe, doomed\nto an inevitable decline. I do not believe in a fate that will fall on us no matter what we do. I do believe in a\nfate that will fall on us if we do nothing. So, with all the creative energy at our command, let us begin an era of\nnational renewal. Let us renew our determination, our courage, and our strength. And let us renew our faith\nand our hope.\nLetter to Government Officials from Gulag Prisoners, 1926.\nTo the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolshevik)\nWe appeal to you, asking you to pay a minimum of attention to our request.\nWe are prisoners who are returning from the Solovetsky concentration camp because of our poor health.\nWe went there full of energy and good health, and now we are returning as invalids, broken and crippled\nemotionally and physically. We are asking you to draw your attention to the arbitrary use of power and the\nviolence that reign at the Solovetsky concentration camp in Kemi and in all sections of the concentration camp.\nIt is difficult for a human being even to imagine such terror, tyranny, violence, and lawlessness. When we went\nthere, we could not conceive of such a horror, and now we, crippled ourselves, together with several thousands\nwho are still there, appeal to the ruling center of the Soviet state to curb the terror that reigns there. As though\nit weren\u2019t enough that the Unified State Political Directorate [OGPU] without oversight and due process sends\nworkers and peasants there who are by and large innocent (we are not talking about criminals who deserve to\nbe punished), the former tsarist penal servitude system in comparison to Solovky had 99% more humanity,\nfairness, and legality. [...]\nPeople die like flies, i.e., they die a slow and painful death; we repeat that all this torment and suffering\nis placed only on the shoulders of the proletariat without money, i.e., on workers who, we repeat, were\nunfortunate to find themselves in the period of hunger and destruction accompanying the events of the\nOctober Revolution, and who committed crimes only to save themselves and their families from death\nby starvation; they have already borne the punishment for these crimes, and the vast majority of them\nsubsequently chose the path of honest labor. Now because of their past, for whose crime they have already paid,\nthey are fired from their jobs. Yet, the main thing is that the entire weight of this scandalous abuse of power,\nbrute violence, and lawlessness that reign at Solovky and other sections of the OGPU concentration camp is\n67 placed on the shoulders of workers and peasants; others, such as counterrevolutionaries, profiteers and so on,\nhave full wallets and have set themselves up and live in clover in the Soviet State, while next to them, in the\nliteral meaning of the word, the penniless proletariat dies from hunger, cold, and back- breaking 14-16 hour\ndays under the tyranny and lawlessness of inmates who are the agents and collaborators of the State Political\nDirectorate [GPU].\nIf you complain or write anything (\u201cHeaven forbid\u201d), they will frame you for an attempted escape or for\nsomething else, and they will shoot you like a dog. They line us up naked and barefoot at 22 degrees below zero\nand keep us outside for up to an hour. It is difficult to describe all the chaos and terror that is going on in Kemi,\nSolovky, and the other sections of the concentrations camp. All annual inspections uncover a lot of abuses. But\nwhat they discover in comparison to what actually exists is only a part of the horror and abuse of power, which\nthe inspection accidently uncovers. (One example is the following fact, one of a thousand, which is registered\nin GPU and for which the guilty have been punished: THEY FORCED THE INMATES TO EAT THEIR OWN\nFECES. \u201cComrades,\u201d if we dare to use this phrase, verify that this is a fact from reality, about which, we repeat,\nOGPU has the official evidence, and judge for yourself the full extent of effrontery and humiliation in the\nsupervision by those who want to make a career for themselves. [...]\nWe are sure and we hope that in the All-Union Communist Party there are people, as we have been told, who\nare humane and sympathetic; it is possible, that you might think that it is our imagination, but we swear to\nyou all, by everything that is sacred to us, that this is only one small part of the nightmarish truth, because it\nmakes no sense to make this up. We repeat, and will repeat 100 times, that yes, indeed there are some guilty\npeople, but the majority suffer innocently, as is described above. The word law, according to the law of the\nGPU concentration camps, does not exist; what does exist is only the autocratic power of petty tyrants, i.e.,\ncollaborators, serving time, who have power over life and death. Everything described above is the truth and\nwe, ourselves, who are close to the grave after 3 years in Solovky and Kemi and other sections, are asking you\nto improve the pathetic, tortured existence of those who are there who languish under the yoke of the OGPU\u2019s\ntyranny, violence, and complete lawlessness...\nTo this we subscribe: G. Zheleznov, Vinogradov, F. Belinskii.\nDec. 14, 1926\nFrom the Library of Congress.\nMemorandum on the Grain Problem in Ukraine, 1932.\nAddendum to the minutes of Politburo [meeting] No. 93.\nRESOLUTION OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE\u2019S COMMISSARS OF THE UKRAINIAN SOVIET\nSOCIALIST REPUBLIC AND OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY\n(BOLSHEVIK) OF UKRAINE ON BLACKLISTING VILLAGES THAT MALICIOUSLY SABOTAGE THE\nCOLLECTION OF GRAIN.\nIn view of the shameful collapse of grain collection in the more remote regions of Ukraine, the Council of\nPeople\u2019s Commissars and the Central Committee call upon the oblast executive committees and the oblast\n[party] committees as well as the raion executive committees and the raion [party] committees: to break up\nthe sabotage of grain collection, which has been organized by kulak and counterrevolutionary elements; to\nliquidate the resistance of some of the rural communists, who in fact have become the leaders of the sabotage;\nto eliminate the passivity and complacency toward the saboteurs, incompatible with being a party member;\nand to ensure, with maximum speed, full and absolute compliance with the plan for grain collection.\n68 Chapter 2: USA and the USSR The Council of People\u2019s Commissars and the Central Committee resolve:\nTo place the following villages on the black list for overt disruption of the grain collection plan and for\nmalicious sabotage, organized by kulak and counterrevolutionary elements:\n1. village of Verbka in Pavlograd raion, Dnepropetrovsk oblast.\n...\n5. village of Sviatotroitskoe in Troitsk raion, Odessa oblast.\n6. village of Peski in Bashtan raion, Odessa oblast.\nThe following measures should be undertaken with respect to these villages :\n1. Immediate cessation of delivery of goods, complete suspension of cooperative and state trade in the\nvillages, and removal of all available goods from cooperative and state stores.\n2. Full prohibition of collective farm trade for both collective farms and collective farmers, and for private\nfarmers.\n3. Cessation of any sort of credit and demand for early repayment of credit and other financial obligations.\n4. Investigation and purge of all sorts of foreign and hostile elements from cooperative and state institutions,\nto be carried out by organs of the Workers and Peasants Inspectorate.\n5. Investigation and purge of collective farms in these villages, with removal of counterrevolutionary\nelements and organizers of grain collection disruption.\nThe Council of People\u2019s Commissars and the Central Committee call upon all collective and private farmers\nwho are honest and dedicated to Soviet rule to organize all their efforts for a merciless struggle against kulaks\nand their accomplices in order to: defeat in their villages the kulak sabotage of grain collection; fulfill honestly\nand conscientiously their grain collection obligations to the Soviet authorities; and strengthen collective farms.\nCHAIRMAN OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE\u2019S COMMISSARS OF THE UKRAINIAN SOVIET\nSOCIALIST REPUBLIC - V.

However, the\nnumber of persons who took part in their preparation and distribution (1663) increased by 9.4% because of\nsome growth of cliquish, negative occurrences among the youth of the Kazakh SRR and Latvia.\nThe number of instances of distributed materials criticizing the international assistance to Afghanistan by the\nUSSR declined by 77%, and the number of pro-fascist slogans and symbols fell by 24%.\nDuring the year 44 instances of distribution of anonymous materials containing terrorist statements against\nleaders of the CPSU and the Soviet government, 108 threats of physical violence against representatives of the\nlocal party, soviet activists, and functionaries, 308 nationalistic, basically anti-Russian fabrications, and 46\ninstances of disagreement with the measures for perestroika in Soviet society were recorded.\nA significant number of anonymous incidents occurred in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moscow,\nand Leningrad.\nIn 1987, 1,312 authors of pamphlets, letters, and graffiti were identified. Of this number, 33 persons admitted to\nstatements of a terrorist nature about the leaders of the party and the government; and 67, to threats of physical\nviolence against local party and soviet activists and functionaries.\nOf the total number of authors investigated, 37.2% are university students and students in vocational and trade\nschools, 18.6% are workers, 16.8% are office workers, 9.5% are retired persons, 17.9% are other categories of\ncitizens, including persons serving time in correctional-labor facilities.\nAmong the authors who were identified are 59 members and candidate members in the Communist Party and\n361 in the Young Communist League.\nReasons for preparing and distributing anonymous materials are: nationalist sentiments (248 persons);\ndissatisfaction with measures taken to strengthen discipline and fight drunkenness and alcoholism (187\npersons); inadequacies in the food supply to the population and also high prices for certain commercial\nproducts (43 persons); difficulties with housing and household needs (41 persons); hooliganism (238 persons);\nmercenary motives (86 persons); mental illness (86 persons); illegal actions by some local managers manifested\nin coarse treatment of subordinates, officious treatment of citizens\u2019 petitions, violations of ethical behavior, etc.\n(23 persons).\nThe reasons for the preparation and distribution of anonymous materials by the remaining 276 authors are\nnow being investigated.\nAfter appropriate review, the majority of the authors under investigation (55.6%) were dealt with through\nmeasures of a preventive nature, 66 persons were tried pursuant to articles of the general Criminal Code of the\nRSFSR and the criminal codes of other union republics.\n70 Chapter 2: USA and the USSR The KGB is implementing measures to prevent and suppress in a timely fashion negative incidents connected\nwith the distribution of anonymous materials of hostile content and to increase the effectiveness of the effort to\nidentify the authors and distributors of these materials.\nFor your information.\nCommittee Chairman\n/s/\nV.

The \u201cwar,\u201d in which the two sides never fought each other\ndirectly, was more like a mutual obsession; each side\u2019s foreign policy was primarily based\non trying to counter the other. Each side viewed the other as an active and existential threat\nthat was trying to conquer the world. That view was clearly incorrect, but leaders on both\nsides pushed it anyway; stirring up fear of a foreign enemy makes people rally around their\ngovernment in self-defense.\n72 Chapter 3: Early Cold War Even prior to World War II, the US and the USSR were antagonistic towards each\nother. The US did not officially recognize the USSR until 1933, sixteen years after the October\nRevolution; the capitalist nation, like most of Western Europe, was anti-communist by nature.\nThe Soviet leadership, for its part, combined a traditional Russian distrust of the West with\nMarx\u2019s assertion that capitalist nations would inevitably try to destroy a communist state. This\nmutual antagonism was suspended during World War II for the sake of defeating the common\nenemy of fascism. After the war, the distrust flared up again, this time almost resulting in a third\nworld war.\nThis chapter will cover the beginning of the Cold War and narrate the chronology of the\nconflict until the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, which began a new period of reduced tensions\nknown as d\u00e9tente.\nThe Division of Europe and the Truman Policy\nLong before the war in Europe ended, allied leaders began considering how they\nwould rebuild Europe and Japan when the fighting ended. Winston Churchill distrusted\nJosef Stalin and wanted to ensure that the Soviets would not occupy any countries border-\ning the Mediterranean Sea, from which they might threaten British colonial shipping in the\nfuture. The British, however, would find themselves too impoverished after the war to push\ntheir plans very hard. President Roosevelt was much more concerned that fascism would\nrise again from the ashes; he emphasized promoting democracy, to prevent the re-establish-\nment of fascism, rather than preparing to counter the communists.\nIn order to understand the Cold War and how it began, it is very important to\nunderstand Josef Stalin\u2019s motivations, which were the subject of much debate in the West.\nSoviet leadership was very distrustful of the West. Germany had twice invaded Russia (in\nthe world wars), and several Western nations had invaded Russia with a multinational force\nto prevent the Russian Revolution from succeeding. Furthermore, the imperial powers\n(Great Britain, France, and the Netherlands) had several hundred years of world conquest\nand domination to their names, and even the United States had a history of strong-arming\nLatin American nations (particularly Panama). It was no great leap for Stalin, already nota-\nbly paranoid, to conclude that the West would attack him once again.\nWhen Stalin reflected on the Soviet experience in World War II, he noted two\nevents which prevented a catastrophic loss to Germany. The first was his pre-war industri-\nalization program, which had given the USSR the necessary production capacity (though\njust barely) to defeat the fascists. Therefore, he continued this heavy industry program\nafter the war. Second, his annexation of half of Poland in 1939 gave him a sufficient buffer\nzone \u2013 again, just barely \u2013 to prevent Nazi forces from reaching Moscow. Therefore, fearing\nanother attack from the West after World War II, he decided that only another buffer zone\nbetween the Soviet Union and the West would save his nation in the next war, and he began\nto create just such a buffer. The freedom of the people living in that buffer zone was of little,\nif any, concern to him.\nOne of the stipulations of the Declaration of United Nations was that the Allies\nwould seek no territorial expansion as a result of the war. Stalin agreed to this, but also\nknew that there were ways to control countries other than outright annexation. When the\nwar in Europe ended in May 1945, the Soviet Union occupied the eastern part of Germany\n(west to the Elbe River), as well as all of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, Albania,\n73 Bulgaria, and Romania. The allied leaders held wartime conferences to determine what to\ndo with these occupied countries after the war. They agreed to allow the people of these\nnations to hold elections and determine their own form of government. However, through\nmanipulation and coercion, Stalin engineered the elections in Soviet-occupied countries to\nensure that the local socialist parties would win (except in Austria, which was adminis-\ntered by a joint Western-Soviet force until its independence as a democracy in 1955). In\nCzechoslovakia, when manipulation wasn\u2019t enough, Stalin even encouraged a socialist\ncoup. Next, Stalin consolidated control by merging the new governments\u2019 security forces\nwith those of the USSR and imprisoning or executing independent-minded socialists who\nwould not obey Moscow. The process was over by 1949, and Stalin got his buffer zone of\nsatellite states between himself and the West without technically violating the Declaration\nof United Nations.\nYugoslavia was an interesting exception to the increasing polarization between the\nWestern democracies and the USSR. The Nazis occupied the nation during World War II\nand several resistance groups fought the fascist invaders. The largest of these was a socialist\ncadre led by Josip Tito. When the Germans retreated from Yugoslavia, Tito and his men\ndeclared Yugoslavia a socialist state, but one which was not under Soviet sway (much to\nStalin\u2019s indignation). This socialist state declared itself part of the neutral \u201cnon-aligned\nmovement\u201d and even received some economic aid from the United States. This was the\nfirst split among communist nations, demonstrating that communism was not a monolithic\nbloc bent on world conquest. There would soon be other splits and disagreements among\ncommunist nations.\nThe disposition of Germany was even more complicated than Eastern Europe. The\ndemocracies and the USSR wanted to rebuild Germany but could not agree on what type of\npolitical or economic structures to create; obviously, each side believed in different systems.\nFurthermore, the Soviets wanted Germany to pay large reparations to them for the damage\ncaused by the war, and the Western nations did not want to saddle the new Germany with\ndebts it could not pay. Their meetings to iron out these differences went nowhere. Tensions\nincreased between the communist East and the capitalist West, with the war barely over.\nThe Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and disagreements over Germany, made\nthe Western allies highly suspicious. In his writings, Karl Marx had advocated for over-\nthrowing every capitalist nation on earth in a crusade to free the proletariat from their bour-\ngeois masters. Noting Stalin\u2019s authoritarianism, many Western leaders, including President\nHarry S. Truman of the United States, believed that Stalin\u2019s domination of Eastern Europe\nrepresented the first step in a plan to conquer Western Europe, or perhaps even the entire\nworld, in the name of communism. (This author, who grew up during the Cold War, re-\nmembers hearing \u201cthe communists want to take over the world\u201d more times than he can\ncount.) This, however, was not the case. Although Stalin no doubt would have enjoyed\nbeing dictator of the globe, he realized that conquering the world, or even just Europe, was\nan impossible task and one which was likely to get him killed. Unlike Hitler, Stalin was\nnot an adventurer, and he certainly was not an idealist who would risk war for the sake of\nthe proletariat or anyone else. He was a careful, cold-hearted strategist who knew how to\nnegotiate, compromise, and even retreat if the risk was too great.\nPresident Truman\u2019s view of Stalin and the Soviet Union was overwhelmingly neg-\native. Truman hated communism and viewed the USSR with great suspicion. But Truman,\nwho became president after Roosevelt\u2019s death in April 1945, had almost no foreign policy\nexperience and lacked the credibility of his long-serving predecessor. He took advice from\nmany different people, including George Kennan, a State Department official who advised\na policy of \u201ccontainment,\u201d or restricting the further spread of communist governments.\nFurthermore, Truman, like Stalin, had learned lessons from World War II. Western leaders\nlooked back on the Munich Conference, which gave Hitler a green light in Czechoslovakia,\n74 Chapter 3: Early Cold War as a na\u00efve attempt at bargaining with dictators. Hitler had, of course, negotiated in bad faith\nand betrayed the agreement. The lesson from this, Western leaders agreed, was that dicta-\ntors cannot be trusted and must be dealt with forcefully. Stalin was not Hitler, but Truman\ncould not be sure of the Soviet leader\u2019s intentions. In the end, Truman heeded the guidance\nof his more hawkish advisors (although Kennan later thought the US was being far too\naggressive with the USSR) and decided that isolationism was not the path the US would\nfollow after the war. Now, the US would stay engaged in the global community to prevent\nthe spread of communism. This decision would forever change US foreign policy.\nThe proximate cause of the new policy was the civil war raging in Greece after\nWorld War II. Communist rebels in Greece, having previously fought their Nazi occu-\npiers, now continued their armed struggle against the right-wing Greek government.\n(Interestingly, while Yugoslavia and Albania supported the Greek communists, Stalin\nwanted to end the war, because he felt that it would antagonize the Western allies. This is a\ngood example of Stalin\u2019s willingness to compromise, when necessary, as well as of the policy\nsplit between communist countries.) Determined not to allow a communist stronghold on\nthe Mediterranean, the British dispatched troops to train and equip the new Greek army;\nhowever, as impoverished as the UK was after the war, they could not afford to continue this\neffort. The British government informed President Truman that the only way to prevent a\ncommunist victory was for the US to take up the fight and supply the Greek government.\nThis was a profound moment in history: the mighty British Empire, the largest in history,\nwas now offering the torch of world leadership to the United States.\nTruman accepted the offer. In a 1947 address before a joint session of Congress,\nTruman announced a new American strategy, soon known as the Truman Doctrine: \u201cI\nbelieve it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting\nattempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.\u201d Although diplomacy\nforced Truman to use vague language, when he said, \u201carmed minorities,\u201d he meant commu-\nnists, and \u201coutside pressures\u201d meant the USSR, and everyone knew it. The speech was met\nwith broad approval. Two months later, the US sent $400 million in economic and military\naid to Greece. It worked; the communists were defeated in 1949. Thus, the Greek Civil War\nwas the first confrontation of the Cold War. From now on, the US would base its foreign\npolicy on anticommunism, and would remain deeply entrenched in world affairs, even after\nthe fall of the Soviet Union.\nNext, Truman launched a huge economic aid package to support the new doctrine.\nIt was named the Marshall Plan after Secretary of State George Marshall, whose office was\nthe main source of the plan. One problem that the United States faced was that the poverty\nof Western European nations might benefit socialist parties who would take advantage of\nthe situation to advocate for political change. Furthermore, Europe\u2019s poverty was preventing\nit from buying US goods, stymying US economic growth. A large aid package would stim-\nulate the Western European economy, reducing poverty. Finally, providing aid to Europe\nwould make those nations dependent on the United States, making it the dominant power\nin the West.\nThe United States was the only nation in the world with the financial means to\ncreate a continent-wide aid package. The program, amounting to $13 billion, was an eco-\nnomic success, and proved even better as a marketing campaign for American friendship\nand leadership. Although the US offered the USSR and their satellite states a portion of\nthe money, Stalin rejected the offer and forbade his satellites from accepting it \u2013 much to\nTruman\u2019s relief, since he didn\u2019t really want to provide funds to the communists anyway. The\noffer was just for propaganda purposes.\nThe next major conflict in the Cold War came only months after the Marshall Plan\nwas implemented. To understand the Berlin Airlift, one must understand the disposition of\nthe city of Berlin after the war. The nation of Germany was split into zones of control mainly\n75 The division of Germany into\nWest (dark green) and East (light\ngreen). Note that Berlin, deep\nwithin East Germany, is divided\nbetween West Berlin and East\nBerlin in a microcosm of the\nentire country. West Berlin was\npart of West Germany despite its\nlocation; East Berlin served as the\ncapitol of East Germany. Courtesy\nof Encarta Encyclopedia.\nalong the final battle lines of the war, with the US, UK, and France controlling different\nsectors west of the Elbe River, and the USSR controlling the region of Germany to the east.\nWartime agreements divided up the capital of Berlin in the same way; the Western allies\ncontrolled the western half of the city, and the Soviets had the eastern half. However, the\nentire city was one-hundred and ten miles inside the Soviet-controlled part of Germany,\nmeaning that it was surrounded by communist forces, and was linked to the Western region\nby a handful of rail, road, and air corridors. This meant that the Soviets could cut off the city\nfrom the West at will as a means of applying pressure \u2013 but such a move might trigger a war.\nFrustrated with Soviet delays in establishing German economic policy, the United\nStates unilaterally decided to create a new currency for Germany, without Soviet input. The\nSoviets retaliated by cutting off the land routes to Berlin in June 1948. Stalin\u2019s plan was to\nstarve West Berlin, so that its citizens would have to ask the Soviets for food and fuel. Stalin\nwould then use that dependency to extort the West into compliance. The problem with this\nplan was that the Americans might view the blockade as cause for war. To avoid this, Stalin\nallowed the air routes to Berlin to remain open to the West. Stalin believed that airlift ca-\npacity alone would not be able to supply West Berlin with everything it needed to survive;\naircraft cannot carry nearly as much cargo as trains. Therefore, Stalin believed that he could\nbring the West to heel without risking a war.\nThe allies, who were as keen as Stalin to avoid a war, responded with the Berlin\nAirlift, the operation to supply West Berlin strictly by air. Over the course of fifteen months,\nthey did exactly what Stalin said they could not, supplying West Berlin entirely by air, with\nBritish and American planes landing in Berlin every thirty seconds at the airlift\u2019s peak.\nFinally, Stalin recognized that his plan had backfired; not only had he failed to starve West\nBerlin, but he had made himself look like a villain, and the democracies like saviors, to the\npeople of West Berlin. He lifted the blockade. But West Berlin would remain the hot spot of\nthe Cold War, forever tense and determined; its residents proudly called their city \u201cFront-\nLine Berlin.\u201d\nThis economic war for Berlin finally killed Western hopes for accommodation with\nthe Soviets over reunifying Germany. In May 1949, the Allies declared that their part of\nGermany, west of the Elbe River, would now be an independent state, the Federal Republic\n76 Chapter 3: Early Cold War of Germany (more commonly known in English as West Germany). The only part of\nWestern Germany which did not immediately join the new nation was the province of\nSaarland, still under French occupation; it joined West Germany in 1957. West Berlin was\nalso a part of West Germany, isolated though it was. The capitol city was Bonn, and the new\ncountry was founded as a capitalist democracy, closely allied with the West. The Soviets\nresponded five months later by creating the German Democratic Republic, better known\nas East Germany, in their zone of occupation. The mirror image of West Germany, East\nGermany was a socialist state in the image of the USSR, and indeed served as a satellite\nstate of that nation. The capitol was East Berlin. Stalin proposed a re-unification of the two\ncountries in 1952, but the West did not trust Stalin to negotiate in good faith, and the new\ngovernment of West Germany wanted no part of Soviet plans. The reunification of Germany\nwould have to wait forty years, a living relic of World War II.\nBoth the United States and its European allies feared further Soviet expansion into\nWestern Europe. To prevent this, these nations committed to a military alliance in April\n1949, in which an attack on one would be considered an attack on all, bringing them all into\nbattle together; this was essentially an anti-Soviet pact. This organization, called the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), initially included twelve nations, among them the\nUnited States and Canada. Another four nations joined between 1949 and 1982. This treaty\nwould eventually lead to 400,000 American troops being stationed in Europe, mainly in\nGermany, to protect against Soviet aggression.\nThe division of Europe into\nNATO (in blue) and the Warsaw\nPact (red) during the Cold War.\nNATO has since expanded to\nother countries.\nFrom Wikipedia Commons:\nhttps://creativecommons.org/\nlicenses/by-sa/3.0/.\n77 The Soviet Union, of course, saw the founding of NATO as proof of capitalist\naggression, fearing that the alliance was planning to invade. The re-armament of West\nGermany also frightened Eastern Europe, as they feared that Germany would now reignite\nold conflicts over borders. As a result, the USSR joined with its seven satellite states in\nEastern Europe in 1955, and formed the Warsaw Pact, a military alliance to prevent a\nWestern invasion.\nThe division of Europe into two camps, as far as the protagonists were concerned,\nwas complete. Of course, members of the non-aligned movement \u2013 for example, democrat-\nic Sweden, socialist Yugoslavia, and ever-neutral Switzerland \u2013 did not participate in this\ndualistic view of Europe and concentrated on economically supporting each other. But for\nmember states of NATO and the Warsaw Pact, Europe was divided into two tribes which\ncould never reconcile. And, especially after the USSR developed the atom bomb in August\n1949, no one was in a hurry to settle the issue by force. The casualties would have been too\nterrible to contemplate.\nThe division of Europe seemed to go global in 1949, with the victory of Mao\nZedong\u2019s communist forces in the Chinese Civil War (see Chapter 6). Although the United\nStates had aided nationalist forces in China against the communists, the government of\nChiang Kai-Shek was corrupt and largely inept and could not withstand the communist\nforces. As China was adjacent to the USSR, communist countries now formed a continuous\ngeographic bloc from East Germany all the way to the Pacific Ocean. To NATO, it appeared\nas if communism would shortly engulf the entire world. Truman\u2019s commitment to contain\ncommunism seemed like a very optimistic project indeed.\nEarly Cold War Confrontations\nAs we have seen, the Soviets were committed to protecting their borders from\npossible aggressors by controlling the nations on those borders (a policy that China would\nimitate, as we shall see in the next section). But the United States was also determined to\nprevent any leftist governments which might be pro-Soviet from gaining a foothold any-\nwhere near it \u2013 primarily in Latin America, which America considered its \u201cbackyard.\u201d To do\nthis, the United States consistently supported anti-communist governments, regardless of\nwhether those governments were democracies. The United States supported dictatorships\nin Nicaragua, Cuba, the Congo, Peru, Panama, Chile, and elsewhere to guarantee that left-\nists would not take power. To the Americans, nothing was as bad as a communist; it was\nwilling to tolerate any form of abusive government to contain even the slightest threat of\ncommunism.\nBut the United States also used containment as a cover to eliminate governments\nwhich opposed US economic policy as well. The United States overthrew the democratic\ngovernment of Iran in 1953 to prop up Reza Pahlavi, the Shah (king) of Iran, to prevent the\ngovernment from raising the price of oil. It also engineered a coup against the democrati-\ncally elected government of Guatemala in 1954 for seizing lands from a corrupt American\ncorporation and invaded the Dominican Republic in 1965 to prevent it from defaulting on\nloans. While this heavy-handed tactic seemed the most efficient to decision makers at the\ntime, there were negative consequences for the United States. Many nations became dis-\ntrustful of the United States, and their governments found that they could remain in power\nby generating anti-American sentiments. The CIA referred to these negative consequences\nas \u201cblowback\u201d against previous US polices.\nThe next major conflict in the Cold War came in 1950. After World War II, Korea\nwas divided into two countries, communist North and US-supported South, in an Asian\nversion of divided Germany (see Chapter 5). Kim Il-Sung, Soviet-selected leader of North\n78 Chapter 3: Early Cold War A map depicting the political division of\nKorea into north and south on the eve of the\nKorean War. The 38th parallel was, by treaty,\nthe dividing line between the two Koreas.\nAfter the conflict, a new line was created\nslightly north of the original.\nFrom the Norfolk Museums Service.\nKorea, was ambitious and wanted to conquer the South, reuniting the nation under com-\nmunism; but he was unable to accomplish this without support from the USSR. Stalin re-\nalized that this was a gamble for him. He did not want a war with the United States. But he\nalso calculated that a war in Korea would pin down US forces in Asia, making it less likely\nthat the Americans could threaten him in Europe. Aiding North Korea in a victorious war\nwould also lend Stalin credibility among Asian communists.\nStalin hedged his bet by requesting that China commit to sending troops to Korea if\nit should prove necessary. Mao agreed; now, Soviet troops would not be required in Korea,\nmaking a wider war less likely. Stalin would eventually send fighter squadrons to Korea,\nalthough they were painted to match North Korean aircraft. With these assurances in place,\nStalin sent equipment and advisors to North Korea, and Kim launched the war in June 1950.\nPresident Truman immediately referred the situation to the United Nations\nSecurity Council, requesting a UN military force to protect a rapidly-collapsing South\nKorea. For the Security Council to approve such a force, all five permanent members would\nhave to vote affirmatively. Since the Soviet Union was a member of the council, one would\nthink that the Soviets would not approve a war against a war they were already support-\ning. However, the Soviet ambassador to the council was absent when the vote was taken,\nbecause the USSR was protesting the fact that the Security Council had removed China\nfrom the council after the communist revolution there. Therefore, no communist members\nvoted, and the three remaining members \u2013 the US, Great Britain, and France \u2013 voted to go\nto war. It was the only time the UN has launched a full-fledged war. (Incidentally, this rather\nproves that Stalin wanted the US to get involved, in order to preoccupy it in Asia. Had Stalin\nwanted to prevent the UN, and the US, from getting involved, the Soviets would not have\nboycotted that meeting).\n79 While the operation to stop the communists was carried out under UN auspices,\nonly the United States had the money and forces to lead the mission, and most UN troops\nin Korea would be American. The UN chose American General Douglas MacArthur, a\nfive-star general and Medal of Honor recipient, to lead UN forces in Korea. MacArthur\nwas in Japan, commanding American occupation forces after the war. It was fortunate that\nhe and his troops were so close to Korea, as communist troops had swept aside the South\u2019s\narmy and were about to conquer the entire country.\nIn a brilliant strategic move, MacArthur landed his forces at Incheon, far north of\nthe current battle lines, cutting off communist forces from the North. Then, pressing his\nadvantage, he drove north, into North Korea itself, and towards the Yalu River, the border\nwith China. Mao warned Truman and MacArthur not to approach the border of China, as\nhe would not tolerate capitalist forces on his border. Neither MacArthur nor Truman took\nthe threat seriously.\nThey should have. Mao sent three hundred thousand Chinese troops to attack UN\nforces, and the United States, led by one of its best military minds, was driven into the lon-\ngest retreat in American military history \u2013 all the way back down the Korean peninsula. The\nentire calculus of the war had changed.\nMacArthur approached President Truman with a proposal to use the atom bomb\non communist forces, as well as to bomb targets in China. Truman, wary of provoking the\nUSSR into a war, forbade both. MacArthur responded by complaining in writing to several\nUS congressmen that Truman was hampering the war effort by not using maximum force.\nTruman, angry at this insubordination, had MacArthur removed from his command. He\nwas replaced by General Matthew Ridgway, who led an offensive which drove back com-\nmunist forces once again. Now the battle lines reached the 38th parallel, the original border\nbetween North and South Korea. Truman ordered his forces to stand fast, and the war de-\ngenerated into static trench warfare, with neither side able to advance.\nJosef Stalin encouraged the Chinese and Koreans to continue fighting, as he felt\nhe was benefitting from US forces being tied down. But Stalin died in March 1953, and the\nChinese and Koreans decided to seek an armistice with the South. This they achieved in July\n1953, placing the new border near the original 38th parallel. The war had cost five million\nlives. However, the two Koreas never signed a peace treaty; technically, both sides remain at\nwar, with millions of troops on their border, where violence occasionally flares up. It is the\nlast hotspot of a Cold War which ended decades ago.\nIt may be that the easy victory in Greece gave US decision-makers the idea that\ncontaining communism would be relatively easy. After Korea, they no longer harbored that\nillusion. President Eisenhower, succeeding Truman, knew that the cost of maintaining a\nmassive military to oppose the communists was draining resources which could be better\nused elsewhere:\n\u201cEvery gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired\nsignifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are\nnot fed, those who are cold and are not clothed\u2026This is not a way\nof life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war,\nit is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.\u201d\nEisenhower, April 1953\n80 Chapter 3: Early Cold War Eisenhower, therefore, sought to contain communism as cheaply as possible,\na task which proved difficult for all successive presidents until the end of the Cold War.\nEisenhower\u2019s strategy was called the \u201cNew Look\u201d because it contemplated new, less-\nexpensive plans for containment. For example, he instituted a strategy called \u201cmassive\nretaliation,\u201d by which Soviet aggression would be met with nuclear weapons, which were\nrelatively cheap compared to the huge expense of maintaining a large standing army. But the\nstrategy was not a very logical one. Would the US start a nuclear war if the communists re-\ninvaded South Korea, or captured a nation in Africa? Probably not \u2013 and the Soviets knew\nit, which negated the threat. More importantly, Eisenhower initiated a program of alliance-\nbuilding, creating military coalitions of nations bordering the USSR and China in the hopes\nof containing communism. Besides NATO, the US helped create the Bagdad Pact (Turkey,\nPakistan, Iran, and Iraq) and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO, comprised\nmainly of Philippines and Thailand). People in these\nnations could view the alliances as guarantees of US\nassistance in the case of communist attack\u2026or as an\nattempt by the US to use them as cannon fodder in\nits containment program. In any case, the Soviets, of\ncourse viewed the new alliances as further proof that\nthe capitalists were conspiring to surround, and then\ndestroy, the USSR, which made them seek alliances of\ntheir own (for example, see Cuba, below).\nWhile the Cold War flared hot in Korea, the di-\nvision of Europe did not mean that the ideological\nwar was over on the continent. The reformist govern-\nment of Hungary, led by Imre Nagy, was frustrated\nwith poor Soviet economic policy and the continued\npresence of Soviet troops in their country. After\nlocal anti-communists attacked the communist secret\npolice, Nagy declared that he was withdrawing from\nthe Warsaw Pact and transitioning the nation towards\nAnti-communist guerillas in democracy. This uprising became known as the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.\nthe Hungarian Revolt of 1956.\nAfter twelve days of discussion and negotiation, Soviet leadership decided that it\ncould not allow Hungary to leave the Soviet orbit, as it would encourage other satellites to\ndo the same, ending the Soviet buffer against the West. Thousands of heavily armed Red\nArmy troops were sent to suppress the uprising. Six thousand Hungarians died and two\nhundred thousand fled the country. The USSR installed a new satellite government which\nwould remain loyal to Moscow.\nThe confrontation set the tone for the rest of the Cold War in Europe. Until the\nHungarian Revolution, some American leaders contemplated \u201crollback,\u201d the concept of lib-\nerating Warsaw Pact countries by force. During the Hungarian Revolution many observers,\nand the revolutionaries themselves, expected the United States to intervene in Hungary and\nprevent a Soviet invasion. However, the Eisenhower administration rejected the idea, citing\nthe possibility of nuclear war should American troops end up in combat with the Red Army.\nThe West was simply not willing to pay the terrible price for liberating the Hungarians or\nanyone else. The strategy that followed was along the lines of what George Kennan had\ntermed \u201ccontainment,\u201d or preventing further communist expansion \u2013 for example, into\nSouth Korea. There would be no further serious consideration of rollback, and anti-com-\nmunist strategies would extend only to propaganda and espionage. The Hungarians, for\ntheir part, were bitterly disappointed in American inaction.\n81 The Space Race\nThe propaganda campaigns of the Cold War, carried out mainly in the global media,\nwere designed to convince people that each side\u2019s way of life was superior to the other. And\nthe greatest (and certainly most expensive) propaganda campaign of the Cold War, and all\nhuman history, was known as the Space Race.\nAfter World War II, both the United States and the Soviet Union realized that\ntravel beyond the earth\u2019s atmosphere would soon be possible; both nations had captured\nNazi military technology and the rocket scientists themselves as the war ended. The initial\nmotivation of capturing, copying, and improving these technologies was strictly military.\nEach nation was, it was thought, in an existential conflict with the other and needed every\npossible advantage. The rockets could keep getting larger, and the nuclear bombs smaller,\nso that eventually the bombs could be put into the rockets for delivery to their targets. A\nnuclear-tipped missile would be unstoppable, and capable of destroying an entire city. The\nUSSR launched the first such nuclear missile in 1957.\nBut the destructive power of such rockets was not the only attraction. These rockets\nwere also extremely high technology for the time, and served as examples of a nation\u2019s tech-\nnical capability. Therefore, the US and the USSR both began a program of trying to achieve\nthe most impressive \u201cfirsts\u201d in space, in order to convince the world that their own way of\nlife was superior to the other. This race for perceived superiority was the heart and purpose\nof the space race.\nThe Soviets achieved a great early victory in the space race by launching Sputnik\n1, the world\u2019s first artificial satellite, on Oct. 4, 1957. The program was led by rocket pioneer\nSergey Korolev. The US responded with its own satellite, Explorer 1, only four months\nlater; but the fact that the Soviets had beaten the Americans into space frightened the US,\nwhich in July 1958 created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\nto guide and accelerate US research.\nThe USSR continued to lead the Americans in the early days of the space race. They\nlaunched the first animal (a dog) into space in 1957, put the first man, Yuri Gagarin, into\nspace in 1961, and achieved the first soft landing on the moon, with a robotic lander, in\nFebruary 1966. While the Americans were never far behind, they found it frightening that\nthe communists seemed to have the technical advantage.\nNevertheless, President\nKennedy decided in May 1961\nto dedicate the United States to\n\u201clanding a man on the moon,\nand returning him safely, before\nthe decade is out.\u201d That was a\nvery bold statement to make\nat that time, considering that\nYuri Gagarin had only become\nthe first man in space a mere\nmonth earlier. Kennedy (and\nthe presidents who followed\nhim) backed this commitment\nwith a lot of money \u2013 over $25\nbillion, reaching just over 4% of\nthe federal budget at one point.\nThe Apollo Program became\nAmerica\u2019s greatest technological\naccomplishment, beating the\nYuri Gagarin, the first man in space.\n82 Chapter 3: Early Cold War Soviets to the moon in 1969. Many considered this to be the finish line of the Space Race,\nand the Americans had reached it first.\nAnother notable event from the early Cold War had a much smaller material effect\nthan Korea or the Space Race but served as the symbol of the conflict. The focal point was\nagain Berlin. East Berliners had been escaping for years from the Soviet sector by simply\ncrossing into West Berlin in broad daylight. Citizens of other Soviet satellite states even\ntravelled to Berlin to cross sides, as it was the easiest place to do so. Anyone crossing into\nWest Berlin was granted political asylum. This led to a \u201cbrain drain\u201d in Eastern Europe, as\neducated workers of every stripe left the East. To stop this, the East German government\nerected a concrete wall starting in 1961. Known as the Berlin Wall, this concrete barrier ran\nthrough the middle of Berlin, dividing the city. The cordon extended into the countryside\nin the form of barbed wire and minefields. The communist government stated that the wall\u2019s\npurpose was to prevent Western spies from penetrating East Germany, but anyone going\nwest was shot as well, and hundreds of people died trying to cross the wall. It became the\nvery symbol of the division of Europe.\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis\nThe escalating tensions of the early Cold War finally came to a head in Cuba in\nOctober 1962 in an event that is considered the closest the superpowers ever came to nucle-\nar war: the Cuban Missile Crisis.\nThe origins of the crisis lay in Fidel Castro\u2019s 1959 victory in the Cuban Revolution\n(see Chapter 10). Although there was a chance for peace between Castro and the US just\nafter the revolution, the United States took a hard line towards the Cuban government when\nit expropriated American-owned territory; subsequent American embargoes pushed Castro\ninto the Soviet orbit to seek economic relief. After Cuba aligned with the USSR, the US\nwould go to great lengths to eliminate the communist government only ninety miles from\nFlorida. The CIA armed Cuban exiles who had fled Castro\u2019s regime and sent them to invade\nCuba; this resulted in the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, which utterly failed and only\ncemented Castro\u2019s popularity in Cuba. Thereafter, the CIA attempted to assassinate Castro\nin Operation Mongoose, and again failed to remove the Cuban leader. Castro, however,\nwas afraid that the United States would soon attempt an all-out invasion of Cuba, and knew\nhe could not withstand that without help from the only nation that might provide it.\nAt the same time, Khrushchev of the USSR was disturbed by US medium-range\nnuclear missiles based in Italy and Turkey, both NATO allies of the US. These missiles, so\nclose to the USSR, were considered a grave danger because their short travel time to their\ntargets gave the Soviets little time to react. The USSR had nowhere to place missiles close\nto the US in order to balance the threat \u2013 until the Cuban Revolution and Castro\u2019s new\nrelationship with the USSR.\nKhrushchev offered to place Soviet missiles in Cuba, which would not only let the\nUSSR balance out the US missile threat but would also give Castro some guarantee against\nUS invasion. Also, Khrushchev held a low opinion of US President Kennedy. He viewed\nKennedy as a rich playboy lacking in courage. Castro agreed to the plan, believing that it\nwould secure him from invasion. The Soviets dispatched engineers to build launch gantries\nin Cuba and sent anti-aircraft missiles to protect them. The US government spotted this\nactivity using its U-2 spy plane and was determined to keep Soviet missiles out of Cuba.\nKennedy carefully considered the advice of his military advisors. Most of them\nadvocated an invasion of Cuba, but Kennedy was hesitant, believing that the Soviets would\nretaliate against West Berlin or even launch a nuclear strike against the US or its NATO\nallies. He decided on a phased approach that would inch towards war only after trying\nvarious diplomatic alternatives. He considered a naval blockade of Cuba to prevent nu-\nclear missiles from arriving there from the Soviet Union (unaware that a certain number\n83 A US military aircraft shadows a\nSoviet freighter enroute to Cuba\nduring the Cuban Missile Crisis\nin 1962. Photo by the US Navy.\nof nuclear weapons were already present in Cuba). A blockade of all shipping would have\nviolated international law and therefore could have served as a pretense for a Soviet attack;\ntherefore, Kennedy opted for a \u201cquarantine\u201d of Cuba, in which the US would search all ships\nbound for Cuba and turn them back if they were found to be carrying offensive weapons.\nKhrushchev stated that he would not accept this, and that seizing Soviet missiles would be\ngrounds for war. After all, the US had missiles in Turkey and Italy. If that was legal, then so\nwere Soviet missiles in Cuba.\nThe situation off the coast of Cuba became very tense as the Soviet and American\nnavies confronted each other and neither side would back down; each side threatened war.\nThe US prepared not only to invade Cuba, but also to launch nuclear strikes against the\nUSSR. At the critical moment, when war seemed imminent, Khrushchev offered a settle-\nment to Kennedy. He promised to remove missiles from Cuba if the Americans removed\nmissiles from Turkey and Italy and promised not to invade Cuba. Kennedy knew that US\nmissiles in those NATO countries were already obsolete; he had planned to remove them\nanyway. He agreed to consent to Khrushchev\u2019s plan only if the removal of missiles from\nTurkey and Italy would remain secret. Khrushchev agreed. Therefore, to the world, it looked\nas if Kennedy had intimidated the Soviets and forced them to retreat, when the actual situa-\ntion was much more equitable. In the West, and especially in America, Kennedy appeared a\nhero \u2013 just in time for the next presidential campaign.\nKennedy did not survive to see the next election, as he was assassinated the fol-\nlowing year. Khrushchev, for his part, was disgraced in the USSR, where the Cuban Missile\nCrisis was viewed as a humiliating loss and accelerated his removal from power. The real\nwinner was Castro, who had secured a US promise not to invade his country \u2013 though the\nUS continued to try to assassinate him for years to come.\n84 Chapter 3: Early Cold War Conclusion\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis convinced both the Soviets and the Americans that, unless they\nmade a concerted effort to reduce tensions, a nuclear war would eventually happen, whether\naccidentally or not. In response, the two nations instituted a policy known as d\u00e9tente, a cooling\nof tensions designed to prevent a war. This did not end the Cold War; it merely meant that each\nside was dedicated to avoiding another close call. The US lifted certain trade embargoes against\nthe USSR and both sides engaged in arms reduction talks. Political rhetoric was cooled, and a\nsystem of direct communication between the President and Premier was established to ensure\nthat crises would be immediately defused. Although certain confrontations were still to come \u2013\nthe American phase of the Second Indochina War was just around the corner (see Chapter 7)\n\u2013 both sides took pains to ensure that nuclear war would not result. This policy of d\u00e9tente lasted\nuntil 1980, when Ronald Reagan won the presidency of the United States and reversed course,\nheating up the Cold War once more and resurrecting the specter of nuclear war.\nSuggested Further Reading\nThe Cold War: A World History by Odd Arne Westad (Basic Books, 2019.

TRUMAN\u2019S ADDRESS BEFORE A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS,\nMARCH 12, 1947\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Congress of the United States:\nThe gravity of the situation which confronts the world today necessitates my appearance before a joint session\nof the Congress. The foreign policy and the national security of this country are involved.\nOne aspect of the present situation, which I wish to present to you at this time for your consideration and\ndecision, concerns Greece and Turkey.\nThe United States has received from the Greek Government an urgent appeal for financial and economic\nassistance. Preliminary reports from the American Economic Mission now in Greece and reports from the\nAmerican Ambassador in Greece corroborate the statement of the Greek Government that assistance is\nimperative if Greece is to survive as a free nation.\nI do not believe that the American people and the Congress wish to turn a deaf ear to the appeal of the Greek\nGovernment.\nGreece is not a rich country. Lack of sufficient natural resources has always forced the Greek people to work\nhard to make both ends meet. Since 1940, this industrious and peace loving country has suffered invasion, four\nyears of cruel enemy occupation, and bitter internal strife.\nWhen forces of liberation entered Greece they found that the retreating Germans had destroyed virtually all the\nrailways, roads, port facilities, communications, and merchant marine. More than a thousand villages had been\nburned. Eighty-five per cent of the children were tubercular. Livestock, poultry, and draft animals had almost\ndisappeared. Inflation had wiped out practically all savings.\nAs a result of these tragic conditions, a militant minority, exploiting human want and misery, was able to create\npolitical chaos which, until now, has made economic recovery impossible.\nGreece is today without funds to finance the importation of those goods which are essential to bare\nsubsistence. Under these circumstances the people of Greece cannot make progress in solving their problems\nof reconstruction. Greece is in desperate need of financial and economic assistance to enable it to resume\npurchases of food, clothing, fuel and seeds. These are indispensable for the subsistence of its people and are\nobtainable only from abroad. Greece must have help to import the goods necessary to restore internal order\nand security, so essential for economic and political recovery.\nThe Greek Government has also asked for the assistance of experienced American administrators, economists\nand technicians to insure that the financial and other aid given to Greece shall be used effectively in creating a\nstable and self-sustaining economy and in improving its public administration.\nThe very existence of the Greek state is today threatened by the terrorist activities of several thousand armed\nmen, led by Communists, who defy the government\u2019s authority at a number of points, particularly along\nthe northern boundaries. A Commission appointed by the United Nations security Council is at present\n88 Chapter 3: Early Cold War investigating disturbed conditions in northern Greece and alleged border violations along the frontier between\nGreece on the one hand and Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia on the other.\nMeanwhile, the Greek Government is unable to cope with the situation. The Greek army is small and poorly\nequipped. It needs supplies and equipment if it is to restore the authority of the government throughout Greek\nterritory. Greece must have assistance if it is to become a self-supporting and self-respecting democracy.\nThe United States must supply that assistance. We have already extended to Greece certain types of relief and\neconomic aid but these are inadequate.\nThere is no other country to which democratic Greece can turn.\nNo other nation is willing and able to provide the necessary support for a democratic Greek government.\nThe British Government, which has been helping Greece, can give no further financial or economic aid after\nMarch 31. Great Britain finds itself under the necessity of reducing or liquidating its commitments in several\nparts of the world, including Greece.\nWe have considered how the United Nations might assist in this crisis. But the situation is an urgent one\nrequiring immediate action and the United Nations and its related organizations are not in a position to extend\nhelp of the kind that is required.\nIt is important to note that the Greek Government has asked for our aid in utilizing effectively the financial\nand other assistance we may give to Greece, and in improving its public administration. It is of the utmost\nimportance that we supervise the use of any funds made available to Greece; in such a manner that each dollar\nspent will count toward making Greece self-supporting, and will help to build an economy in which a healthy\ndemocracy can flourish.\nNo government is perfect. One of the chief virtues of a democracy, however, is that its defects are always visible\nand under democratic processes can be pointed out and corrected. The Government of Greece is not perfect.\nNevertheless it represents eighty-five per cent of the members of the Greek Parliament who were chosen in an\nelection last year. Foreign observers, including 692 Americans, considered this election to be a fair expression\nof the views of the Greek people.\nThe Greek Government has been operating in an atmosphere of chaos and extremism. It has made mistakes.\nThe extension of aid by this country does not mean that the United States condones everything that the Greek\nGovernment has done or will do. We have condemned in the past, and we condemn now, extremist measures\nof the right or the left. We have in the past advised tolerance, and we advise tolerance now.\nGreece\u2019s neighbor, Turkey, also deserves our attention.\nThe future of Turkey as an independent and economically sound state is clearly no less important to the\nfreedom-loving peoples of the world than the future of Greece. The circumstances in which Turkey finds itself\ntoday are considerably different from those of Greece. Turkey has been spared the disasters that have beset\nGreece. And during the war, the United States and Great Britain furnished Turkey with material aid.\nNevertheless, Turkey now needs our support.\nSince the war Turkey has sought financial assistance from Great Britain and the United States for the purpose\n89 of effecting that modernization necessary for the maintenance of its national integrity.\nThat integrity is essential to the preservation of order in the Middle East.\nThe British government has informed us that, owing to its own difficulties can no longer extend financial or\neconomic aid to Turkey.\nAs in the case of Greece, if Turkey is to have the assistance it needs, the United States must supply it. We are the\nonly country able to provide that help.\nI am fully aware of the broad implications involved if the United States extends assistance to Greece and\nTurkey, and I shall discuss these implications with you at this time.\nOne of the primary objectives of the foreign policy of the United States is the creation of conditions in which\nwe and other nations will be able to work out a way of life free from coercion. This was a fundamental issue in\nthe war with Germany and Japan. Our victory was won over countries which sought to impose their will, and\ntheir way of life, upon other nations.\nTo ensure the peaceful development of nations, free from coercion, the United States has taken a leading part\nin establishing the United Nations, The United Nations is designed to make possible lasting freedom and\nindependence for all its members. We shall not realize our objectives, however, unless we are willing to help\nfree peoples to maintain their free institutions and their national integrity against aggressive movements that\nseek to impose upon them totalitarian regimes. This is no more than a frank recognition that totalitarian\nregimes imposed on free peoples, by direct or indirect aggression, undermine the foundations of international\npeace and hence the security of the United States.\nThe peoples of a number of countries of the world have recently had totalitarian regimes forced upon them\nagainst their will. The Government of the United States has made frequent protests against coercion and\nintimidation, in violation of the Yalta agreement, in Poland, Rumania, and Bulgaria. I must also state that in a\nnumber of other countries there have been similar developments.\nAt the present moment in world history nearly every nation must choose between alternative ways of life. The\nchoice is too often not a free one.\nOne way of life is based upon the will of the majority, and is distinguished by free institutions, representative\ngovernment, free elections, guarantees of individual liberty, freedom of speech and religion, and freedom from\npolitical oppression.\nThe second way of life is based upon the will of a minority forcibly imposed upon the majority. It relies upon\nterror and oppression, a controlled press and radio; fixed elections, and the suppression of personal freedoms.\nI believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted\nsubjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.\nI believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies in their own way.\nI believe that our help should be primarily through economic and financial aid which is essential to economic\nstability and orderly political processes.\n90 Chapter 3: Early Cold War The world is not static, and the status quo is not sacred. But we cannot allow changes in the status quo in\nviolation of the Charter of the United Nations by such methods as coercion, or by such subterfuges as political\ninfiltration. In helping free and independent nations to maintain their freedom, the United States will be giving\neffect to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\nIt is necessary only to glance at a map to realize that the survival and integrity of the Greek nation are of\ngrave importance in a much wider situation. If Greece should fall under the control of an armed minority, the\neffect upon its neighbor, Turkey, would be immediate and serious. Confusion and disorder might well spread\nthroughout the entire Middle East.\nMoreover, the disappearance of Greece as an independent state would have a profound effect upon those\ncountries in Europe whose peoples are struggling against great difficulties to maintain their freedoms and their\nindependence while they repair the damages of war.\nIt would be an unspeakable tragedy if these countries, which have struggled so long against overwhelming\nodds, should lose that victory for which they sacrificed so much. Collapse of free institutions and loss of\nindependence would be disastrous not only for them but for the world. Discouragement and possibly failure\nwould quickly be the lot of neighboring peoples striving to maintain their freedom and independence.\nShould we fail to aid Greece and Turkey in this fateful hour, the effect will be far reaching to the West as well as\nto the East.\nWe must take immediate and resolute action.\nI therefore ask the Congress to provide authority for assistance to Greece and Turkey in the amount of\n$400,000,000 for the period ending June 30, 1948. In requesting these funds, I have taken into consideration\nthe maximum amount of relief assistance which would be furnished to Greece out of the $350,000,000 which\nI recently requested that the Congress authorize for the prevention of starvation and suffering in countries\ndevastated by the war.\nIn addition to funds, I ask the Congress to authorize the detail of American civilian and military personnel\nto Greece and Turkey, at the request of those countries, to assist in the tasks of reconstruction, and for the\npurpose of supervising the use of such financial and material assistance as may be furnished. I recommend that\nauthority also be provided for the instruction and training of selected Greek and Turkish personnel.\nFinally, I ask that the Congress provide authority which will permit the speediest and most effective use, in\nterms of needed commodities, supplies, and equipment, of such funds as may be authorized.\nIf further funds, or further authority, should be needed for purposes indicated in this message, I shall not\nhesitate to bring the situation before the Congress. On this subject the Executive and Legislative branches of the\nGovernment must work together.\nThis is a serious course upon which we embark.\nI would not recommend it except that the alternative is much more serious. The United States contributed\n$341,000,000,000 toward winning World War II. This is an investment in world freedom and world peace.\nThe assistance that I am recommending for Greece and Turkey amounts to little more than 1 tenth of 1 per\ncent of this investment. It is only common sense that we should safeguard this investment and make sure that it\n91 was not in vain.\nThe seeds of totalitarian regimes are nurtured by misery and want. They spread and grow in the evil soil of\npoverty and strife. They reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died. We must\nkeep that hope alive.\nThe free peoples of the world look to us for support in maintaining their freedoms.\nIf we falter in our leadership, we may endanger the peace of the world -- and we shall surely endanger the\nwelfare of our own nation.\nGreat responsibilities have been placed upon us by the swift movement of events.\nI am confident that the Congress will face these responsibilities squarely.\nNATO Treaty; April 4, 1949\nWashington DC.\nThe Parties to this Treaty reaffirm their faith in the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations\nand their desire to live in peace with all peoples and all governments.\nThey are determined to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilisation of their peoples, founded on the\nprinciples of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law.\nThey seek to promote stability and well-being in the North Atlantic area.\nThey are resolved to unite their efforts for collective defence and for the preservation of peace and security.\nThey therefore agree to this North Atlantic Treaty:\nARTICLE 1\nThe Parties undertake, as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations, to settle any international dispute in\nwhich they may be involved by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security and\njustice are not endangered, and to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force in any\nmanner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.\nARTICLE 2\nThe Parties will contribute toward the further development of peaceful and friendly international relations by\nstrengthening their free institutions, by bringing about a better understanding of the principles upon which\nthese institutions are founded, and by promoting conditions of stability and well-being.

Eisenhower, 1961\nMy fellow Americans:\nThree days from now, after half a century in the service of our country, I shall lay down the responsibilities of\noffice as, in traditional and solemn ceremony, the authority of the Presidency is vested in my successor.\nThis evening I come to you with a message of leave-taking and farewell, and to share a few final thoughts with\nyou, my countrymen.\nLike every other citizen, I wish the new President, and all who will labor with him, Godspeed. I pray that the\ncoming years will be blessed with peace and prosperity for all.\nOur people expect their President and the Congress to find essential agreement on issues of great moment, the\nwise resolution of which will better shape the future of the Nation.\nMy own relations with the Congress, which began on a remote and tenuous basis when, long ago, a member of\nthe Senate appointed me to West Point, have since ranged to the intimate during the war and immediate post-\nwar period, and, finally, to the mutually interdependent during these past eight years.\nIn this final relationship, the Congress and the Administration have, on most vital issues, cooperated well, to\nserve the national good rather than mere partisanship, and so have assured that the business of the Nation\nshould go forward. So, my official relationship with the Congress ends in a feeling, on my part, of gratitude that\nwe have been able to do so much together.\nII.\nWe now stand ten years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars among great nations.\nThree of these involved our own country. Despite these holocausts America is today the strongest, the most\ninfluential and most productive nation in the world. Understandably proud of this pre-eminence, we yet realize\nthat America\u2019s leadership and prestige depend, not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches and\nmilitary strength, but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment.\n97 III.\nThroughout America\u2019s adventure in free government, our basic purposes have been to keep the peace; to\nfoster progress in human achievement, and to enhance liberty, dignity and integrity among people and among\nnations. To strive for less would be unworthy of a free and religious people. Any failure traceable to arrogance,\nor our lack of comprehension or readiness to sacrifice would inflict upon us grievous hurt both at home and\nabroad.\nProgress toward these noble goals is persistently threatened by the conflict now engulfing the world. It\ncommands our whole attention, absorbs our very beings. We face a hostile ideology -- global in scope, atheistic\nin character, ruthless in purpose, and insidious in method. Unhappily the danger is poses promises to be\nof indefinite duration. To meet it successfully, there is called for, not so much the emotional and transitory\nsacrifices of crisis, but rather those which enable us to carry forward steadily, surely, and without complaint the\nburdens of a prolonged and complex struggle -- with liberty the stake. Only thus shall we remain, despite every\nprovocation, on our charted course toward permanent peace and human betterment.\nCrises there will continue to be. In meeting them, whether foreign or domestic, great or small, there is a\nrecurring temptation to feel that some spectacular and costly action could become the miraculous solution to\nall current difficulties. A huge increase in newer elements of our defense; development of unrealistic programs\nto cure every ill in agriculture; a dramatic expansion in basic and applied research -- these and many other\npossibilities, each possibly promising in itself, may be suggested as the only way to the road we wish to travel.\nBut each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration: the need to maintain balance in and\namong national programs -- balance between the private and the public economy, balance between cost and\nhoped for advantage -- balance between the clearly necessary and the comfortably desirable; balance between\nour essential requirements as a nation and the duties imposed by the nation upon the individual; balance\nbetween actions of the moment and the national welfare of the future. Good judgment seeks balance and\nprogress; lack of it eventually finds imbalance and frustration.\nThe record of many decades stands as proof that our people and their government have, in the main,\nunderstood these truths and have responded to them well, in the face of stress and threat. But threats, new in\nkind or degree, constantly arise. I mention two only.\nIV.\nA vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant\naction, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction.\nOur military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime, or\nindeed by the fighting men of World War II or Korea.\nUntil the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American makers of\nplowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency\nimprovisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry\nof vast proportions. Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the\ndefense establishment. We annually spend on military security more than the net income of all United States\ncorporations.\nThis conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American\n98 Chapter 3: Early Cold War experience. The total influence -- economic, political, even spiritual -- is felt in every city, every State house,\nevery office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must\nnot fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very\nstructure of our society.\nIn the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought\nor unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists\nand will persist.\nWe must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should\ntake nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the\nhuge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and\nliberty may prosper together.\nAkin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial-military posture, has been the\ntechnological revolution during recent decades.\nIn this revolution, research has become central; it also becomes more formalized, complex, and costly. A\nsteadily increasing share is conducted for, by, or at the direction of, the Federal government.\nToday, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in\nlaboratories and testing fields. In the same fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free\nideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research. Partly because of the\nhuge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity. For every\nold blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers.\nThe prospect of domination of the nation\u2019s scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power\nof money is ever present\nand is gravely to be regarded. Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must\nalso be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-\ntechnological elite.\nIt is the task of statesmanship to mold, to balance, and to integrate these and other forces, new and old, within\nthe principles of our democratic system -- ever aiming toward the supreme goals of our free society.\nV.\nAnother factor in maintaining balance involves the element of time. As we peer into society\u2019s future, we -- you\nand I, and our government -- must avoid the impulse to live only for today, plundering, for our own ease and\nconvenience, the precious resources of tomorrow. We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren\nwithout risking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage. We want democracy to survive for all\ngenerations to come, not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow.\nVI.\nDown the long lane of the history yet to be written America knows that this world of ours, ever growing\nsmaller, must avoid becoming a community of dreadful fear and hate, and be instead, a proud confederation of\nmutual trust and respect.\n99 Such a confederation must be one of equals. The weakest must come to the conference table with the same\nconfidence as do we, protected as we are by our moral, economic, and military strength. That table, though\nscarred by many past frustrations, cannot be abandoned for the certain agony of the battlefield.\nDisarmament, with mutual honor and confidence, is a continuing imperative. Together we must learn\nhow to compose differences, not with arms, but with intellect and decent purpose. Because this need is so\nsharp and apparent I confess that I lay down my official responsibilities in this field with a definite sense of\ndisappointment. As one who has witnessed the horror and the lingering sadness of war -- as one who knows\nthat another war could utterly destroy this civilization which has been so slowly and painfully built over\nthousands of years -- I wish I could say tonight that a lasting peace is in sight.\nHappily, I can say that war has been avoided. Steady progress toward our ultimate goal has been made. But,\nso much remains to be done. As a private citizen, I shall never cease to do what little I can to help the world\nadvance along that road.\nVII.\nSo -- in this my last good night to you as your President -- I thank you for the many opportunities you have\ngiven me for public service in war and peace. I trust that in that service you find some things worthy; as for the\nrest of it, I know you will find ways to improve performance in the future.\nYou and I -- my fellow citizens -- need to be strong in our faith that all nations, under God, will reach the goal\nof peace with justice. May we be ever unswerving in devotion to principle, confident but humble with power,\ndiligent in pursuit of the Nation\u2019s great goals.\nTo all the peoples of the world, I once more give expression to America\u2019s prayerful and continuing aspiration.\nImage Credits\n\u201cAmerican and Soviet tanks facing each other across the dividing line in Berlin, 1961\u201d is from the U.S. Army\nArchives.\n\u201cThe division of Germany into West (dark green) and East (light green)\u201d is from Encarta Encyclopedia.\n\u201cThe division of Europe into NATO (in blue) and the Warsaw Pact (red) during the Cold War,\u201d \u201cYuri Gagarin,\nthe first man in space\u201d are from Wikipedia Commons: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/.\n\u201cA map depicting the political division of Korea into north and south on the eve of the Korean War\u201d is from the\nNorfolk Museums Service.\n\u201cA US military aircraft shadows a Soviet freighter enroute to Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962\u201d is\nfrom the US Navy.\n100 Chapter 3: Early Cold War Chapter 4\nColonization and Decolonization\nImperialism: the formal domination of one nation over another,\nusually through military conquest. When one nation conquers\nanother, or several others, the resulting multinational unit is\nreferred to as an empire, with the conquering nation acting as\nruler over the others.\nColonization: a form of imperialism in which people from the\nconquering nation move to and live in the conquered nation,\nenjoying advantages over the indigenous population \u2013 or perhaps\neven relocating them entirely.\nA 19th-century American cartoon, representing Great Britain\nas a colonial monster grabbing up nations around the world.\nThe conquest of one kingdom by another is a very old story; the first empire\nwas probably created by Sargon of Akkad in about 2300 BCE. Over the last 500\nyears, all the dominant empires have been European in origin, leading many to view\nimperialism as a Caucasian, Christian endeavor. But European imperialism is only\nthe latest iteration of an age-old dream of conquest which persisted until the mid-20th\ncentury.\nThis ancient practice of imperialism and colonization ended after WWII,\nwhen the remaining empires \u2013 the British, French, Dutch, and Portuguese \u2013 finally\ncollapsed. The process of this collapse, and the resulting independence of the\nconquered countries, is known as decolonization. The result of global decolonization\nwas an explosion of new nations, mainly in Africa and Asia, in the twenty years after\nWorld War II. Some examples of decolonization were violent in the extreme; others\nwere largely undramatic, at least until independence opened the door to unforeseen\nconflicts. Between 1945 and 2000, 142 new nations were born, creating a period of\ninstability which has not yet completely settled. It was no less than the collapse of the\nold world order and the start of a new age in global history.\nThe individual dramas of these newly-independent nations are covered mainly\nin chapters 5, 7, and 9. The point of this chapter is to examine why decolonization\noccurred when it did, and explore the numerous problems involved in the process.\nHowever, to appreciate the importance of decolonization, we need to first\nreview colonization and its effects on both the colonizer and the colonized. Only then\ncan we understand the importance of decolonization and why the process was so\ncomplicated and fraught.\n101 Theodor de Bry, \u201cNegotiating Peace with the Indians,\u201d 1634.\nCompliments of Virginia Historical Society.\nThe First Wave of European Colonization\nOne of the great historical questions of the past five hundred years concerns\nEuropean dominance of the globe. With few exceptions (for example, the Greek and Roman\nempires), the European kingdoms and empires were always second-rate; one traditionally\nlooked to the Middle East or Asia for the greatest economies, cultures, arts, and militaries.\nBut after approximately 1500 CE, the Europeans dominated the earth with their empires,\ncapturing entire continents and ruling over them for hundreds of years. How did the\nEuropeans do this? Many researchers (for example, Jared Diamond in his popular work,\nGuns, Germs, and Steel) have addressed this question.\nThe first reason for European dominance was a strong economic drive. The Age of\nExploration was born of a need to re-connect Europe with the Asian and Middle Eastern\nspice markets. Silks, spices, and other goods had flowed from India and China to Europe\nsince the Roman Empire, with Middle Eastern businesses acting as the middlemen. After\nthe fall of the Mongol Empire and the rise of the Ottomans, land routes between Europe\nand Asia were no longer safe enough for trade. The only way for Europeans to reconnect\nwith global trade routes was by sea, and the Europeans had never sailed so far. It would be a\nlong and difficult process to build better ships and sail off the edges of their existing maps,\nbut a great deal of money hung in the balance.\nCoupled with this desire for profit was the growing power of European nations,\nborn of constant fighting. Since the fall of the Roman Empire, no power in Europe had been\nable to dominate all the others, leading to virtually nonstop warfare though the entire medi-\naeval period. Not only did the Europeans fight each other, but also fended off invasions from\nMuslims and Mongols and, just before Columbus\u2019 first expedition, destroyed the Muslim\ncaliphate in Spain. One advantage of all this fighting was that European nations had learned\nto build the powerful, centralized states necessary for winning wars. They developed strong\n102 Chapter 4: Colonization and Decolonization central governments, market economies, and efficient tax collection systems to ensure that\nthe kingdom had the necessary funds. These administrative tools created kingdoms strong\nenough to survive the constant wars of Europe, and those that failed to adopt them were\neliminated.\nThese two factors \u2013 exploration for the sake of trade, and powerful centralized\nkingdoms \u2013 meant that the Europeans were motivated to explore the globe, and toughened\nby constant fighting to be aggressive and capable conquerors. This did not mean instant\nsuccess; for example, when the Portuguese first arrived in the Indian Ocean after having\nsuccessfully navigated around Africa, they were unable to simply dominate the Middle\nEastern empires, which were already very powerful. Total domination would have to wait a\nfew more centuries.\nHowever, the Europeans did have a huge advantage over the tribes and empires of\nthe American continents. The indigenous Americans lacked steel weapons and firearms; in\nonly a few instances had they formed large empires that could fight the invading Europeans.\nColumbus was not looking for a new continent; he was looking for a passage to China, to\naccess the Asian markets. But after discovering gold and silver in the Americas, the Spanish\ninvaded with legions of mercenary troops, with the intention of plundering the wealth of\nthe continent. With time, this massive robbery developed into colonialism, as Spaniards\nemigrated to Latin America to run the plantations and mines, using slaves to extract even\ngreater wealth than they had initially stolen. The Northern European kingdoms soon fol-\nlowed, occupying what would later become the United States and Canada. This conquest\nwas backed by the Christian churches of Europe, which viewed imperialism as an oppor-\ntunity to spread their religion. It is clear, however, that the main drive behind colonization\nwas wealth. Religious conversion was at best a secondary consideration, at worst a mere\nexcuse for aggression.\nAs the Europeans explored farther afield, still seeking markets in Asia, they eventu-\nally located weak societies they could conquer, establishing ports in them for peaceful trade\nwith kingdoms they were unable to conquer, as well as producing spices on their own plan-\ntations. The Dutch seized parts of what would eventually be Indonesia; the Spanish con-\nquered the Philippines; the French took Indochina; and the British conquered the Indian\nsubcontinent, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore. Not only did the Europeans battle\nthe locals for control of their land, but continued their endless wars with each other, and\nthese wars extended to attacking each other\u2019s colonies. Add to this the pirates who constant-\nly stalked the trade routes, and the new colonial world became a very dangerous place.\nThe Second Wave of Colonization\nThe West had succeeded in its goal of reconnecting with the global trade networks.\nHowever, by the late 19th century, Europe was a completely different place from when\nColumbus embarked on his somewhat misguided mission. Starting with Great Britain,\nEurope had industrialized, converting its agricultural economy to one based on mechanized\nmanufacturing and transportation. This created new economic imperatives. Europeans\nneeded more raw materials to feed their factories, and many of these \u2013 such as rubber \u2013\nwere not available in Europe. Furthermore, the European markets were saturated \u2013 that is,\ntheir factories were producing more goods than their people could buy, limiting economic\ngrowth. With foreign markets difficult to penetrate due to economic protectionism, one\navailable option was to force conquered peoples to buy European products by forbidding\nthem from making their own. This could only be done in colonies the Europeans completely\ncontrolled. Finally, creating modern militaries required strong economies; if a European na-\ntion\u2019s rivals had more colonies, and therefore more wealth, then its rivals could build larger\n103 armies. That, European leaders asserted, was unacceptable. These economic and military\nconcerns drove what is called the Second Wave of Colonization, or \u201cNew Imperialism,\u201d\nwhich lasted from 1880, to the start of World War I in 1914. This new colonization was\naided not only by new technologies, but also new justifications for the venture.\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of this new imperialism was the Scramble\nfor Africa. Prior to the late 19th century, Europeans maintained trading posts on the Sub-\nSaharan African coasts, mainly to access the African slave trade. These possessions equaled\nabout ten percent of all African territory. Europeans rarely penetrated into the interior\ndue to the threat of tropical diseases against which they had no resistance. The worst of\nthese was malaria. This prevented the Europeans from conquering and colonizing Africa,\nalthough it was much closer to Europe than their Asian possessions.\nHowever, large-scale production of the drug quinine after 1850 could protect\nEuropeans from malaria, and suddenly opened all of Africa to colonization. Before the\ninevitable scramble could occur, however, the European powers foresaw a problem in ad-\nvance: in their rush to colonize Africa, they might end up fighting each other to capture\nthe most profitable places. To avoid this, leaders met in Berlin from 1884 to 1885 to divide\nAfrica among them in advance, to avoid fighting. This was known at the Berlin Conference\nand, predictably, no Africans were at the table. With the arrangements made in advance,\nthe Europeans then proceeded to conquer ninety percent of Africa over the next few de-\ncades. They also continued to advance in Asia, capturing all of Indonesia, Malaysia, and\nIndochina. The United States also carried out a more stumbling form of imperialism by\ntaking the Philippines and Puerto Rico from Spain in 1898.\nIn this round of colonization,\nthe West easily defeated all other cul-\ntures, due to the advanced technology\ngranted by science and industrialization.\nWestern militaries now sported au-\ntomatic weapons, modern artillery,\nsteam-powered ships, and the telegraph.\nThese developments meant that the\nWest could conquer virtually every\nother society on earth, with the notable\nexception of China, which was simply\ntoo large to easily conquer. And ease of\nconquest was important; since the main\nthrust of colonization was economic\ngain, conquests had to be carried out\ncheaply, with a minimum of men and\nresources, in order to maximize profit. Africa, as divided among the European\nColonization was just another business, imperialists at the Berlin Conference.\nFrom Wikipedia Commons:\ndriven by profit and loss. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\nThe colonizing nations had\nchanged considerably since the First Wave of Colonization; they had become more democ-\nratized in the meantime, as well as more secular. This posed a new problem for them during\nthe second wave: how could a democracy justify conquest of a people who had not harmed\nit? How does society square the \u201cinalienable rights\u201d of man with aggressive imperialism?\nSince the West was increasingly democratic, it was now even more important that their\npopulations condoned imperialism, as they could stop it simply by voting for anti-impe-\nrialist leaders. Religious crusading alone would no longer suffice; a new justification was\nrequired. The West found it in two sources: scientific racism and the civilizing mission.\nScience was a relatively new and rising power in the West. It had delivered tech-\nnology and medicine which improved human life. Moreover, science was regarded as an\n104 Chapter 4: Colonization and Decolonization objective mode of thought, based on experimentation and facts, unlike religious faith.\nTherefore, the imperialists based their new justification on scientific racism, the concept\nthat science proves that one race is inherently superior to another. Through dubious \u201cscien-\ntific\u201d experiments, Western racists claimed that White people were proven to be mentally\nand morally superior to nonwhites. This, they furthermore believed, gave whites the right to\nrule over the inferior nonwhites. Charles Darwin\u2019s views of natural selection, or \u201csurvival of\nthe fittest,\u201d were becoming popular in the late 19th century. Racists applied this thinking to\nhumans, claiming that Whites were \u201cfittest,\u201d as proven by their superior wealth and power.\nTherefore, they claimed, it was only natural that Whites should rule the world, as the most\npowerful predators ruled the animal kingdom.\nIncidentally: scientific racism is fake science, carried out with a bias in order to\nprove pre-existing racism. Actual science has never proven any mental or moral superiority\nbetween races. In fact, within science, there is no such thing as \u201crace.\u201d There is only one\nhuman species, homo sapiens. Furthermore, Charles Darwin never meant for natural selec-\ntion to apply to human culture, but only to explain evolution in the animal world.\nOnce one accepted scientific racism, it opened the door to the next justification: the\ncivilizing mission, or what Rudyard Kipling, in his famous poem, called the \u201cWhite man\u2019s\nburden\u201d:\nTake up the White Man\u2019s burden\u2014\nSend forth the best ye breed\u2014\nGo bind your sons to exile\nTo serve your captives\u2019 need;\nTo wait in heavy harness\nOn fluttered folk and wild\u2014\nYour new-caught, sullen peoples,\nHalf devil and half child.\nIn this poem, Kipling tells White people that it is their historic task to raise non-\nwhite people \u2013 \u201chalf devil and half child\u201d \u2013 out of darkness and into enlightened (i.e.,\nWestern) society. Western governments used this \u201ccivilizing mission\u201d to justify their con-\nquests, claiming that dominating other cultures was helpful, a gift, bringing them superior\ncivilization. Someday, the Americans and Europeans claimed, these cultures would be suffi-\nciently Western that the colonizers would go home, granting the newly-developed cultures\ntheir freedom. In the late 19th century, most white people, though not all, were ready to\naccept this logic.\nEuropean colonization lasted from 1492 to the 1960s \u2013 nearly five hundred years.\nIt brought tremendous wealth and power to the West, placing Europe and the United States\natop all other world powers. But how did colonization affect the colonized peoples of the\nworld?\nThe first effect was simply death, especially during the First Wave. The European\nconquest of the American hemisphere virtually annihilated the indigenous population.\nMost of these deaths came through diseases the Europeans brought with them, particularly\nsmallpox, against which the native population had no resistance. Other causes were more\ndirect, the result of barbarism against the indigenous. Between disease, wars, slavery, and\nintentional starvation, the Europeans killed between ninety and ninety-five percent of the\nindigenous population of the Americas. It is thought that about 145 million Amerindians\nlived in the Americas before the arrival of the Europeans; by 1700, it was only 15 million, a\nloss of 130 million lives \u2013 the single greatest demographic loss in history. This also led to the\nnear-total destruction of indigenous language, culture, and religion. To the indigenous, it\nwas the greatest possible catastrophe, the end of everything, the apocalypse.\n105 Furthermore, this demographic loss led the European col- A 16th-century print showing the progression of\nsmallpox in a Native American victim of the disease.\nonizers to turn to Africa to find slaves to work the new plantations\nof the Americas. The Portuguese, with their trading posts on the\nAfrican coasts, were the first to tap into the existing African slave\ntrade, as the Arabs had already done. The Atlantic slave trade even-\ntually transported between twelve and thirteen million Africans\ninto slavery in the Americas, mainly in Brazil and the Caribbean.\nBesides reducing the African population, this trade also enticed\nAfrican kingdoms into warring against each other to capture\nslaves to sell to the Europeans, keeping Africa in a constant state of\nturmoil long before the Scramble for Africa began.\nRonald and Nancy Reagan in 1981. Courtesy of the Reagan Library.\nAfrican slaves on a\nsugarcane plantation on\nAntigua. Compliments of\nthe British Library.\nThe New Imperialism of the 19th century featured less loss of life, which doesn\u2019t say\nmuch; also, the slave trade had ended by then. Nevertheless, the effect of African and Asian\ncolonization was devastating for the colonized.\nThe first major effect was the seizure of the best agricultural lands by the coloniz-\ner. By force of arms, and with the collaboration of some of the indigenous, the colonizers\nkicked the locals off their lands, they turned into plantations for cash crops such as tobacco,\nsugarcane, cotton, and so on. The colonized now had no source of income or even food; the\ncolonizers further exploited them by hiring them as cheap agricultural laborers on the lands\nthey once owned, working for poverty wages under conditions that would never be permit-\nted in Europe or America. This would keep the colonized permanently poor and dependent\non the colonizer, exactly as the colonizer wanted.\n106 Chapter 4: Colonization and Decolonization The colonizer had not come to the colonized to learn their ways or their language\nany more than necessary. Native arts and culture declined, replaced by those of the coloniz-\ner. The newly-introduced Christianity competed with local religions, sometimes splitting\nfamilies apart. The colonizers held all their own cultural artifacts as superior to those of the\ncolonized, who were encouraged to abandon their traditional ways in exchange for that of\nthe colonized \u2013 except for democracy, which was largely withheld from them.\nAll of this demoralized the colonized. The colonizers did indeed bring modern civ-\nilization to the colonies in the form of hospitals, schools, infrastructure, and factories; but\nall of these primarily benefitted the colonizers, not the locals. And colonization could not\nbe carried out without some assistance from the colonized. The colonizers could not speak\nthe languages of the colonized; they did not understand their customs or religions. They\nneeded collaborators, locals who spoke their language and would work for the colonizers\nas translators, advisors, bureaucrats, or even local leaders. These collaborators gained access\nto the Western world and usually tried to assimilate to some degree. They received a rela-\ntively good salary (rare for the colonized), could attend Western universities, and had other\nprivileges denied to most indigenous people. Gandhi\u2019s father was one such man, working\nfor the British Raj (see Chapter 7). Of course, locals often viewed these people as traitors,\nalthough the collaborators would sometimes work for the locals\u2019 benefit within the system\nas much as they could. The collaborators lived a complex and often difficult life, with a foot\nin both worlds of colonizer and colonized, and were usually entirely trusted in neither. For\nexample, the colonized could often serve in the armies of the colonizer \u2013 but only under\nthe control of White officers. The colonizers were not about to trust the colonized with that\nmuch power.\nOver centuries of colonization, it became clear to the colonized, even the collabo-\nrators, that the colonizer would never consider them equals, no matter what the colonizers\npromised. To do so would break down the entire colonial system, which was based from the\nstart on benefitting the mother country, not the colonized people. Without inequality, there\ncould be no colonialism.\nUnderstandably, most colonized would not go along with this unless forced to do\nso. Colonization was always a military affair, and always used some form of terrorism to\nmaintain control. Even the most restrained of colonizers deployed lethal force when neces-\nsary. During the Second Wave of Imperialism, the most violent colony was the Congo Free\nState, which was the personal property of King Leopold II of Belgium. Known as \u201cthe place\nwhere there ain\u2019t no Ten Commandments,\u201d the Congo colony was the scene of some of\nhistory\u2019s darkest crimes. The colonizers, utilizing a mercenary army, forced the indigenous\npopulation into slavery to exploit the\nnatural resources of this vast region\nof Africa for Leopold\u2019s benefit. This\nbrutal slavery, and the terrorism that\nsupported it, killed over ten million\npeople.\nForced labor in Congo Free State. Notice\nthat the guards are also African; such\npeople were the \u201ccollaborators\u201d needed\nto make colonialism work.\n107 The great debate in the Global North during the second wave was whether the col-\nonized benefitted from colonization, as Kipling suggested. Imperial governments, of course,\nclaimed that they did, and worked hard to hide all evidence to the contrary. For example,\nKing Leopold insisted that his efforts in the Congo were philanthropic, designed to bring\nenlightened society to savages. But eventually word of the true situation in the Congo\nreached the West, spurring an early international human rights movement to end the abuse.\nPerhaps the best evidence that colonization did not benefit the colonized was the\nfrequency of revolts against imperial rule. One general rule about people is that they do not\nlike to be ruled by foreigners; they almost invariably prefer one of their own to rule. Even if\nthe Westerners had brought good things to the colonized, why was it necessary for them to\nrule the country in order to do so? If their cause was philanthropic, couldn\u2019t they have built\nhospitals and gone home?\nRealizing the true nature of the colonial project, the colonized launched numerous\nuprisings against their occupiers. Sub-Saharan Africa alone saw at least twenty uprisings\nagainst European rule prior to World War I. If colonization was benefitting the colonized,\nthis would not have happened. The colonizers, for their part, explained away the revolts as\nfoolishness, jealousy, or as a \u201cpsychotic reaction\u201d against modernity.\nFor all the might of the empires, for all their centuries of domination, their time\nwas rapidly running out by the end of World War II, and the colonized peoples of the world\nknew it. The entire balance of world power was about to shift, almost at once.\nDecolonization\nDecolonization is the process by which a colony gains its freedom and becomes\nan independent nation. The process may be the result of violence (in the case of the United\nStates or Vietnam, for example) or not (India or Canada). The great wave of decolonization\nwhich ended European imperialism was largely a consequence of World War II. We need to\nexamine that particular historical moment.\nThe first reason for the wave of postwar decolonization was the impoverishment\nof the European nations. The two world wars cost the world approximately 1.5 trillion US\ndollars (or about 24 trillion US dollars in 2022 currency). Furthermore, the devastation\nof Europe meant that such wealth as they still retained had to be dedicated to rebuilding\nThe British Empire in 1921.\nFrom Wikipedia Commons:\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\n108 Chapter 4: Colonization and Decolonization \u2013 and, as we have already seen, economic\nassistance from the United States was crit-\nical. Therefore, retaining standing armies to\nmaintain control of the colonies was con-\nsidered prohibitively expensive, especially\nfor a population that was sick of war.\nBut if colonies were good for the imperial\neconomy, as imperial leaders claimed, why\ndid the impoverished imperial nations\nwithdraw from their colonies? Wouldn\u2019t\nthey have made more money if they had\nstayed? The truth is that colonization was\nnever beneficial to the imperial nation as\na whole. It benefitted the companies who\nhad the royal monopolies to operate in the\ncolonies; it benefitted those who held high\npositions in the colonial governments.\nBut in the end, the cost of maintaining the\ncolonies was greater than the profit for the\nnation as a whole. This encouraged the col-\nonizers to abandon the colonies.\nThe British, realizing that the days of\nempire were over, decided to withdraw\nfrom their empire, albeit in an orderly and\n(mostly) dignified way, leaving behind\nAnti-colonial revolutionaries in\nlocal governments which were at least initially pro-Western.

Leaders believed that retaining the colonies was critical to\nFrom the Tropenmuseum\nCollection. this. Therefore, both countries fought to keep their rebellious colonies, specifically Vietnam\nand Algeria for the French, and Indonesia in the case of the Dutch. Both nations lost their\ncolonies anyway. The tsunami of decolonization left nothing standing in its wake.\nThere were several other factors involved in this historical moment. Over the de-\ncades, the colonized had developed national consciousness, the concept that they were\nall citizens of a nation, with a set of shared traits. This may seem elementary for citizens of\nEurope and the United States, but the colonized were not initially members of a nation-state.\nWhen the imperialists created their colonies, the new borders they established ignored the\ncultural reality on the ground; for example, they joined together people of different tribes\nand religions who had never lived together before, and divided existing tribal lands among\ndifferent colonizers, so that tribe members could not cross the borders to visit each other\nas they had since time immemorial. The Berlin Conference was the clearest example of this\nwillful ignorance of colonial cultures. This added to the chaos of the colonized, only further\nproving that aiding the colonized peoples was not the point of the imperial project.\nOver the decades, the colonized people came to identify with each other, primarily\nbecause they shared one important trait: they all hated the imperial powers and wanted\nthem to leave. Ironically, it was the colonizers who provided the colonized with the unity\nthey needed to prevail. The colonized were willing to put aside their differences in order to\nfight the colonizers. Furthermore, after World War II, the colonizers\u2019 veneer of invincibil-\nity had been shattered. The Europeans had cultivated the myth that their civilization was\n109 superior to all others, but the Japanese, an Asian people, had pushed the British from their\nSoutheast Asian colonies like Malaysia and Singapore. Seeing Asians defeat Westerners in\nbattle encouraged the colonized people to fight the imperialists.\nOther historic factors came into play. The United States was opposed to European\ncolonization, mainly because it had fought the first modern anti-imperial revolt in 1776.\nAnti-imperialism is part of the American cultural DNA, which made American domination\nof Latin America and other countries an uncomfortable arrangement (see Chapter 10). The\nAmericans, for the most part, declined to aid the French and Dutch in maintaining their\ncolonies after the war. They even pressured the Dutch into leaving Indonesia by threatening\nto cut off postwar economic aid, something the Dutch could not afford to lose. The USSR\nalso opposed colonization, as anti-imperialism is a bedrock of Marxist thought. The Soviets\nsent aid to anti-colonial revolutionaries, much to the chagrin of the democracies, who saw it\nas a case of communist infiltration and conquest.\nAnother factor in decolonization was the opposition of the United Nations. In\n1948, the UN signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the first global declaration\nof human rights (see Chapter 12). One of the rights in this document \u2013 which the imperial-\nists signed \u2013 is that all people have the right to self-determination, meaning that they had\nthe right to rule themselves. This made the imperialists look bad. The fascists, who were\njust defeated, claimed the right to rule over others; were the imperialists going to act like\nNazis after they just defeated them? Again, the colonizers found that the world seemed to be\nleaving them behind.\nFinally, the changing global economy itself was rendering colonization useless. The\nBretton Woods Conference of 1944 designed the postwar capitalist economic system in\norder to rebuild the shattered world and strengthen economic development (see Chapter\n14). The Bretton Woods system empowered global trade by seeking to remove trade barriers\nsuch as tariffs and other protectionism. By enabling free trade, the system removed much\nof the economic impetus for colonialism, which had been founded, in part, to circumvent\ninternational trade barriers.\nTaken together, it was clear that the global conditions permitting colonization had\nfaded, a testament to just how great were the changes wrought by World War II.\nThere were many groups among the colonized prepared to resist the colonizers \u2013\nand that was part of their problem. Various groups had different goals and methods, as well\nas different visions for the new nation. Some groups were nativist, who wanted to return the\ncolony to the tribal or monarchical state that existed before the colonizers conquered them.\nSome were religious nationalists who wanted a new government based on their religion.\nSome, especially collaborationists who had been educated in the West, wanted a democrat-\nic government like Western Europe or the United States. Still others were socialists who\nwanted to establish a Marxist government. Furthermore, some leaders, like Gandhi, wanted\nindependence through nonviolent means; others, like Ho Chi Minh, believed only violence\nwould achieve victory. Each group saw the others as hindrances to independence. Therefore,\na major problem for these groups was to build coalitions that could work together for the\ncommon goal of independence, despite their differences. The colonizers, for their part, were\nmore than happy to play one group off against another, emphasizing the differences between\nthe revolutionaries to keep them at odds with each other.\nIt is important to remember that decolonization took place in the context of the\nCold War. The Americans and Europeans would go to great lengths to prevent socialists\nfrom taking power in any former colony, although they often failed to do so (see Vietnam\nand Algeria, Chapters 7 and 11 respectively). The Westerners viewed all socialists as agents\nof the USSR although, as we have seen, that was clearly not the case. For the US in particu-\nlar, any socialist country was a threat to its existence (see the case of the Belgian Congo in\nChapter 9). This led to US covert actions and military aid in many decolonizing countries to\n110 Chapter 4: Colonization and Decolonization prevent socialist victories. The British, who wanted to exit their colonies, would not do so\nwithout leaving behind democratic, pro-Western governments. They did all they could to\nsuppress socialists, or even just leftist groups with socialist leanings, before leaving (see the\nexample of Singapore in Chapter 5).\nNew Nations, New Challenges\nOnce the colonizers were gone by one method or another, the formerly colonized\nwere free to create their own nations. This began a tug-of-war between two social forces: the\ncommonalities binding the new nations together, and the differences pulling them apart.\nDuring colonization, the various religious, tribal, ethnic, and political groups\namong the colonized usually put aside their differences and worked together for indepen-\ndence. What had brought them together was their common hatred of the colonizer. But\nwhen the colonizer left, that commonality was gone as well, and the differences came to the\nfore. What kind of government would be established? Democracy? Socialist? Theocracy?\nWould any particular ethnic or tribal group rule? Could different regions have their own\nlaws, according to their original precolonial societies? What would be the national lan-\nguage? These were differences which the Americans and Europeans had centuries to settle,\noften with great violence (consider the European Thirty Years War, or the American Civil\nWar, for example). Now the new nations, full of internal contradictions which the coloniz-\nThe African Renaissance ers had created from the start by ignoring social realities in creating the colonies, had to go\nMonument, commemorating\nthrough the same process. Opportunistic leaders could take advantage of the conflicts and\nthe 50th anniversary of Senegal\u2019s\nindependence from France. fashion themselves into dictators (see Chapter 9), only\nmaking the situation worse. The intervention of both\nthe US and the USSR to influence the new nations com-\nplicated things even further. This was why the period of\ndecolonization was one of the most chaotic in history,\nalthough also one of the most hopeful.\nThere were also the practical problems of ad-\nministering a new country. The colonized, having\nbeen subjugated for centuries, had no experience in\nnational-level self-rule. Those who had collaborated\nwith the colonizers and educated in the West had some\nexperience in governing the colony, and often sought to\nbecome the new national leaders, but many others con-\nsidered them to be traitors for having collaborated with\nthe colonizers. The nativists, in particular, were loath\nto follow them. Economic problems abounded. The\nentire economy had been run by the colonizer, and for\nhis own purposes. Native industries had been forbidden\nto prevent competition for the Europeans. Now, a new\neconomy had to be built from scratch, and quickly, as\npoverty would produce even more chaos.\nAnd the new nations were not entering a level\nplaying field; they were going to compete with older and\nmuch more established nations. Some of these nations,\nparticularly the powerful ones, could be downright\npredatorial in their international relations. Not only did\nthe US and USSR strive to counter each other\u2019s efforts in\nthe new nations, but international corporations sought\n111 new business opportunities in them, often on terms not to the new nation\u2019s advantage. The\nnewly decolonized nation, in dire need of money, might need to accept any available deal,\neven bad ones. Financial assistance from the global North can also be used to gain leverage\nover a poor country, if that country becomes dependent on the money. All of this led to a\nnew theory in international relations in the late 1960s known as dependency theory \u2013 the\nidea that the developed world wants the developing world to remain weak and dependent,\nthe better to control its resources and markets.\nConclusions\nDecolonization was one of the most important moments in world history,\ngranting hundreds of millions of people their political sovereignty. Although this\nwas a necessary first step, it was far from the last. These nations had to create\nnational consciousness, provide political stability, and build their economies.\nCertain new nations \u2013 for example, Singapore and Malaysia \u2013 have done a notably\ngood job at this monumental task. Other nations, particularly in Africa, have\nhad a much more difficult time of it, with revolts, poverty, and chaos. We should\nbear in mind that these nations are only sixty or seventy years old, very young as\ncountries go. They became independent in a world full of powerful nations which\nwanted to influence their politics or control their economies. There is no reason\nto believe that these new nations could go through this process without a long\nstruggle to establish their economic and social stability and independence.\nSuggested Further Reading\nThe Colonizer and the Colonized by Albert Memmi (Beacon Press, 1991.

He is especially remembered for\nchampioning laws that removed Catholic influence from most education in France and for promoting a vast\nextension of the French colonial empire.\nThe policy of colonial expansion is a political and economic system ... that can be connected to three sets of\nideas: economic ideas; the most far-reaching ideas of civilization; and ideas of a political and patriotic sort.\nIn the area of economics, I am placing before you, with the support of some statistics, the considerations that\njustify the policy of colonial expansion, as seen from the perspective of a need, felt more and more urgently\nby the industrialized population of Europe and especially the people of our rich and hardworking country of\nFrance: the need for outlets [for exports]. Is this a fantasy? Is this a concern [that can wait] for the future? Or is\nthis not a pressing need, one may say a crying need, of our industrial population? I merely express in a general\nway what each one of you can see for himself in the various parts of France. Yes, what our major industries\n[textiles, etc.], irrevocably steered by the treaties of 18601 into exports, lack more and more are outlets. Why?\nBecause next door Germany is setting up trade barriers; because across the ocean the United States of America\nhave become protectionists, and extreme protectionists at that; because not only are these great markets ...\nshrinking, becoming more and more difficult of access, but these great states are beginning to pour into our\nown markets products not seen there before. This is true not only for our agriculture, which has been so sorely\ntried ... and for which competition is no longer limited to the circle of large European states .... Today, as you\nknow, competition, the law of supply and demand, freedom of trade, the effects of speculation, all radiate in\na circle that reaches to the ends of the earth .... That is a great complication, a great economic difficulty; ... an\nextremely serious problem. It is so serious, gentlemen, so acute, that the least informed persons must already\nglimpse, foresee, and take precautions against the time when the great South American market that has, in\na manner of speaking, belonged to us forever will be disputed and perhaps taken away from us by North\nAmerican products. Nothing is more serious; there can be no graver social problem; and these matters are\nlinked intimately to colonial policy.\nGentlemen, we must speak more loudly and more honestly! We must say openly that indeed the higher races\nhave a right over the lower races ....\nI repeat, that the superior races have a right because they have a duty. They have the duty to civilize the\ninferior races .... In the history of earlier centuries these duties, gentlemen, have often been misunderstood; and\ncertainly when the Spanish soldiers and explorers introduced slavery into Central America, they did not fulfill\ntheir duty as men of a higher race .... But, in our time, I maintain that European nations acquit themselves with\ngenerosity, with grandeur, and with sincerity of this superior civilizing duty.\nI say that French colonial policy, the policy of colonial expansion, the policy that has taken us under the\nEmpire [the Second Empire, of Napoleon 1111, to Saigon, to Indochina [Vietnam], that has led us to Tunisia,\nto Madagascar-I say that this policy of colonial expansion was inspired by... the fact that a navy such as ours\ncannot do without safe harbors, defenses, supply centers on the high seas .... Are you unaware of this? Look at a\nmap of the world.\nGentlemen, these are considerations that merit the full attention of patriots. The conditions of naval warfare\nhave greatly changed .... At present, as you know, a warship, however perfect its design, cannot carry more than\ntwo weeks\u2019 supply of coal; and a vessel without coal is a wreck on the high seas, abandoned to the first occupier.\nHence the need to have places of supply, shelters, ports for defense and provisioning.... And that is why we\nneeded Tunisia; that is why we needed Saigon and Indochina; that is why we need Madagascar... and why we\n117 shall never leave them! ... Gentlemen, in Europe such as it is today, in this competition of the many rivals we\nsee rising up around us, some by military or naval improvements, others by the prodigious development of a\nconstantly growing population; in a Europe, or rather in a universe thus constituted, a policy of withdrawal or\nabstention is simply the high road to decadence! In our time nations are great only through the activity they\ndeploy; it is not by spreading the peaceable light of their institutions ... that they are great, in the present day.\nSpreading light without acting, without taking part in the affairs of the world, keeping out of all European\nalliances and seeing as a trap, an adventure, all expansion into Africa or the Orient-for a great nation to live this\nway, believe me, is to abdicate and, in less time than you may think, to sink from the first rank to the third and\nfourth.\nFerry, Jules. \u201c On French Colonial Expansion.\u201d Internet History Sourcebooks Project.

On the right is Hiroshima today. One could view the photographs as a metaphor for the recovery of\nall Japan after World War II \u2013 a great many Japanese cities looked like Hiroshima at war\u2019s end. Japan not\nonly recovered, but became one of the world\u2019s great industrial powerhouses, challenging America\u2019s postwar\neconomic hegemony. The first part of this chapter is the story of how Japan accomplished this tremendous feat.\nKorea has had a much more complicated postwar history. Although once a unified kingdom, Korea\nis now divided into two nations, socialist in the North and democratic in the South. Although the United\nStates was involved in rebuilding both South Korea and Japan after the war, certain variables, particularly\nthe occupation of the North by Soviet forces after the war, made the South Korean experience far more\ndifficult. And although South Korea has recovered from the Korean War, a peace treaty was never signed; that\nsmoldering conflict is the last remnant of the Cold War.\n119 Japan -- Surrender and Occupation\nJapan surrendered to the Allies on September 2, 1945. Two events convinced\nEmperor Hirohito to ask for peace: the use of the atomic bombs and the Soviet invasion of\nJapanese-held territories in China and Korea, both in August. Hideki Tojo and his generals\nwanted to fight on despite the desperation of the situation. Hirohito, however, wanted to\nspare the Japanese people the inevitable slaughter which would follow an American invasion\nor repeated atomic attacks. Without Tojo\u2019s knowledge, the emperor broadcast a recorded\nspeech over the radio, ordering his people to surrender unconditionally. Since the emperor\nwas considered a semi-divine being, the people were bound to obey his orders. Tojo knew\nthat he\u2019d been outmaneuvered. He had led Japan into war by controlling the emperor; now\nthat he had lost control of the emperor, he had lost control of both the war and Japan.\nAfter the surrender, President Truman chose General Douglas Macarthur to\nadminister the occupation of Japan. MacArthur was a natural choice for the role. He had\nbeen overall Allied commander in the Pacific, one of only nine Americans to reach the\nrank of Five-Star General, and a Medal of Honor recipient for his campaign to liberate the\nPhilippines. By the end of 1945, MacArthur had about 350,000 American troops under his\nheadquarters, SCAP (Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers), in Japan on occupa-\ntion duty.\nMacArthur\u2019s initial objective in Japan was to ensure that fascism in Japan was dead\nand would not return; he was to replace it with a Western-style democracy. The objective\nwas, therefore, primarily political and social, just as it was in occupied Germany. Before\nthe United States withdrew from Japan in 1952, this project would become one of the most\nintensive and successful political programs in history.\nMacArthur\u2019s plans to remake Japanese society were halted by one inescapable fact:\nvirtually everyone in Japan was starving. The American bombing campaign had destroyed\nthe nation\u2019s infrastructure, so that such food as was\nstill being grown could not be brought to the cities\nfrom the countryside. There was no point in writing\na constitution while people were dying in droves; as\none Japanese political scientist put it, \u201cDemocracy\ncannot be taught to a starving people.\u201d Therefore,\nMacArthur\u2019s first task was providing food to pre-\nvent widescale starvation during the first postwar\nwinter. The program was a great success.\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1947 that MacArthur creat-\ned Japan\u2019s postwar constitution, which gave Japan\na parliamentary monarchy and enshrined human\nrights into law. The role of the emperor was reduced\nto a strictly ceremonial one, with all real power held\nby the people through their representatives. Article\n9 of the constitution is notable; it prevents Japan\nfrom building a military or stationing troops over-\nseas. This was designed to prevent re-militarization\nin Japan and a return to fascism. However, the need\nfor Japan to protect itself from communism during\nthe Cold War led to the creation of the capable\nJapanese Self-Defense Forces. These troops are\nlegally designated as law enforcement, in order to\navoid violating Article 9.\nGeneral MacArthur and Emperor\nHirohito. Compliments of US Army.\n120 Chapter 5: Japan and Korea The emperor was a special problem for MacArthur. The general held war crimes\ntrials in Japan, like those in postwar Germany, and hanged several leaders, including Hideki\nTojo. Emperor Hirohito was theoretically guilty of war crimes, as he was Head of State at\nthe time. MacArthur decided against prosecution, believing that it would turn the Japanese\npeople against the American occupiers. Instead, he made the emperor publicly renounce his\ndivinity, thus removing his supernatural authority from Japanese politics.\nWith the start of the Cold War, however, MacArthur changed his objectives in\nJapan. Fascism seemed vanquished and democracy solidly established; but the Americans\nfelt that the threat of communism was growing in Asia, especially after Mao\u2019s revolutionary\nvictory in China in 1949. What the Americans now needed was a strong ally in Asia to\nsupport its new policy of containment. Japan would be the perfect ally, were it not still eco-\nnomically dependent on the United States. A strong Japanese economy would also dampen\nthe allure of socialism in that nation, something the Americans were keen to do. Therefore,\nMacArthur decided on a \u201creverse course\u201d to revise US objectives from democracy-building\nto economic development. This would build a wealthy Japan that could support its own\nmilitary and assist the United States in protecting Asia from communism \u2013 even though\nArticle 9 of the American-made constitution forbade both of those things.\nInitially, MacArthur disliked the zaibatsu. The zaibatsu were large business con-\nglomerates in Japan which cooperated much more closely than in American-style capi-\ntalism. They were essentially tight associations of corporations, banks, labor unions, and\nthe government in order to overcome business problems collectively; they emphasized the\ncommon good of the economy rather than individual gains. SCAP was suspicious of the\nmonopolistic nature of the zaibatsu system and its apparent socialist bent. The zaibatsu had\nalso been deeply involved in the fascist armament program, further arousing American\nsuspicion. Therefore, MacArthur began dissolving the zaibatsu companies and changing\nbusiness regulation to suppress what remained; the idea was to come closer to the American\nsystem of competition instead of cooperation. But during the reverse course, this anti-zai-\nbatsu policy was halted because the Japanese considered the zaibatsu important to econom-\nic recovery. The dissolution policy was halted halfway, leaving Japan with a watered-down,\ninformal version of zaibatsu economics known as keiretsu, a system which exists to this day.\nMacArthur also completely remade the Japanese agricultural sector. Over the cen-\nturies, wealthy landowners in Japan had acquired more and more land, concentrating own-\nership in a small elite until most of the rural population was reduced to low-wage tenant\nworkers instead of independent land-owning farmers. This produced an economically-de-\npressed rural Japan.\nSCAP changed this situation in only three years, though it cost a great deal of\nAmerican money to do so. MacArthur\u2019s headquarters forbade anyone from owning more\nthan a certain amount of land, forcing them to turn over the rest to the government, with\ncompensation paid by SCAP. By this method, SCAP acquired millions of acres, amounting\nto nearly forty percent of Japanese farmland, from the wealthy landowners. It then resold\nthe land in small lots to peasant farmers at affordable prices, allowing them to own their\nown farms. This produced a new agricultural middle-class in Japan, dispersing the wealth of\nthe countryside and assisting Japan\u2019s economic recovery.\nThe occupation was complicated by the unexpected start of the Korean War in\nJune, 1950 (see Chapter 3). President Truman tapped General MacArthur to lead the UN\nresponse to North Korean aggression; a practical choice, since MacArthur was geographi-\ncally close to the frontline with hundreds of thousands of US troops, who were immediately\nsent to Korea to stop the attack (MacArthur ran the war from Japan, and only visited Korea\nonce).\n121 The Korean War had several effects on the occupation of Japan. First, the Americans\nwere keener than ever for Japan to build a military and assist America in containing com-\nmunism in the East. That meant Japan needed its independence. The United States and\nJapan signed the San Francisco Peace Treaty on September 8, 1951, ending the occupation\nand granting Japan its independence.\nA more immediate effect was economic. The Korean War forced the United States\nto supply thousands of troops on the far side of the globe, and the long supply train caused\na host of logistical problems. To solve this, as well as boost the Japanese economy, Japanese\ncompanies were granted the contracts to produce military supplies for the US forces. This\nnot only gave Japanese manufacturing a much-needed boost, but also allowed the supplies\nto be shipped a much shorter distance from Japan to Korea, simplifying the logistical chain.\nPostwar Economic Miracle\nThe war was the beginning of what is referred to as the \u201cJapanese postwar eco-\nnomic miracle.\u201d Along with the war contracts, Japanese manufacturing did all it could to\nimprove efficiency. Management examined every step of the production processes, weeding\nout even the most insignificant inefficiencies. The keiretsu model aided economic recov-\nery, with the government stepping in to guide improvements, removing financial or leg-\nislative roadblocks to development, and passing pro-business legislation. Various sectors\nof the economy assisted each other. Under the occupation, blue-collar union membership\nwas now legal and strong, improving wages and thus\nstimulating the economy; but the government also\nprevented major strikes by negotiating between labor\nand capital. Finally, Japanese corporations reduced\nthe ubiquitous insecurity of industrialized capital-\nism by guaranteeing lifelong employment of their\nworkers. If someone took a job with a particular cor-\nporation, they could expect to remain there for their\nentire career, with corporations and workers each\ndisplaying loyalty for the other.\nAll these factors allowed the Japanese econ-\nomy, led mainly by manufacturing, to explode in a\nremarkable period of growth. Japan did suffer an eco-\nnomic setback during the 1973 oil crisis that resulted\nfrom the Yom Kippur War (see Chapter 11), but so\ndid the entire global economy. Except for that blip,\nthe Japanese economy surged, and even the mighty\nUnited States feared that Japan would soon overtake\nits own economy in the world market.\nWorkers making transistor\nAlthough Japan\u2019s close relationship with the United States and the favorable global radios in Japan, 1962.\neconomic situation were both causes of the postwar economic miracle, Japanese society Compliments of the Truman\nPresidential Library.\nitself held a key to the miracle. Japan has traditionally had a particularly strong work ethic;\nthis is probably the result of the lack of arable land in the nation, which created a culture\nof very hard-working, disciplined farmers necessary to feeding everyone. This work ethic\nserved Japan well after the war, but its extreme nature caused problems of its own. In the\nlate 1960s, corporations started noticing workers dying, often on the job, from heart attacks\nand strokes at relatively young ages. Given that a quarter of employees were working over\n60 hours a week, including unpaid overtime, corporations and governments concluded\nthat these deaths amounted to what they termed karoshi (death from overwork). The term\n122 Chapter 5: Japan and Korea includes victims of stress-induced suicide. Both government and corporations have taken\nsteps to reduce the incidence of karoshi, attempting to reduce demands placed on workers\nand provide necessary time off. Furthermore, Japanese workers are increasingly opting for\npart-time work, paid by the hour, instead of salaried positions. Karoshi is not just a Japanese\nphenomenon; China, Korea, and other Asian nations suffer a similar epidemic.\nDespite the stress of overwork, the Japanese economy expanded exponentially,\nbecoming the second largest GNP in the world (after the United States) and successfully\ncompeting with US products in the global marketplace.\nThe Japanese economy recovered from the oil crisis, but not from the next shock,\nwhich was self-induced. Low interest rates led to excessive borrowing and investment,\nwhich caused the Japanese stock market to become a speculative bubble, in which stock\nprices were vastly greater than the actual value of the companies. This is what caused the\nGreat Depression in 1929, and the Japanese government knew it. But when the government\nraised interest rates to stop the over-borrowing and speculation, the stock market bubble\nburst, leading to a stock market crash and debt crisis. The result was that, all during the\n1990s, economic growth was halted \u2013 this was known as the Lost Decade. In the decades\nsince, the economy has never recovered to pre-crash proportions. The Chinese economy is\nnow the second largest in the world after the United States; nevertheless, the economy of\nJapan is still the third-largest, commanding just over five percent of the world\u2019s wealth.\nA few major controversies continue to plague Japanese culture. People are having\nfar fewer children than in past decades (a common occurrence in wealthy countries), so that\nthe population is trending older; this in turn drives economic stagnation, as there are more\nretirees and fewer working-age people to create wealth and tax income. Another problem is\nJapan\u2019s continued ambiguity towards World War II. While the successive emperors of Japan\nhave apologized for the war, a strong nationalist sentiment remains; Japanese history text-\nbooks often whitewash Japanese war crimes, and Japanese politicians continue to visit the\nYasukuni Shrine, a memorial to deceased veterans \u2013 including some war criminals. Such\nattitudes continue to rankle the people of South Korea and China, who suffered terrible\ncrimes at the hands of the Japanese during the war.\nNevertheless, Japan has risen from the ashes from war to become a major world\neconomic power and cultural influence. Japanese food (particularly sushi) is celebrated\nworldwide, as are their films and video games. Popular Japanese art (amine and manga, for\nexample) enjoy a worldwide fandom. After the war, Japan not only transformed its govern-\nment and economy, but also opened itself to the world, contributing to the global culture\nwhile also being changed by it.\nPost-World War II Korea\nAlthough the Korean postwar experience shared some characteristics with\nGermany (division between Cold War rivals and intensive rebuilding, for example), the\nKorean War and slow democratic development in South Korea meant that the peninsula\nsuffered far more than its European equivalent, and certainly much more than Japan. In a\nway, Korea demonstrated what would have happened in Europe had NATO and the Warsaw\nPact chosen war to settle the German question.\nKorea had been an independent kingdom prior to 1910, when Japan annexed the\ncountry and sent colonizers to run the government. Korean rebels resisted Japanese occupa-\ntion constantly until the end of World War II.\nTwo events persuaded the emperor of Japan to surrender in World War II. The first\nwas the atomic bomb; the second was the successful Soviet invasion of Japanese-occupied\nChina in August of 1945, which demonstrated that Japan could not hold anything it had\n123 taken. Besides helping to persuade Hirohito of the hopelessness of his cause, the invasion\nalso changed the subsequent geopolitics of Asia. Soviet forces pushed into Korea from\nChina, forcing the Japanese to retreat. When Japan surrendered, the fighting stopped, and\ntroops from the United States entered Korea from the south to take over occupation from\nthe Japanese. The result of this was that Korea was divided between the Soviet Union and\nthe United States in a situation similar to the division of Germany. The dividing line be-\ntween the two zones was the 38th Parallel line, which put nearly twice as many Koreans in\nthe south as the north.\nAs with Germany, the Americans and the Soviets set up their respective occupation\nzones to reflect their own political cultures, even while they debated the route to reunifica-\ntion of the country. In the Soviet zone, Korean communists were given leading roles in the\nlocal government. In the South, the Americans promoted an anti-communist stance, but\ntheir program was far less effective than in Japan. The South experienced rebellions against\nUS occupation, something that was never seen in Japan. They were put down by force.\nAs with Germany, the United States and the USSR struggled to find a way to reunite\nall of Korea under a single government. The United Nations agreed to hold elections for\na united Korean government, but the USSR boycotted the election in the North. Finally,\nunable to reach any consensus, Korea was permanently divided, just as Germany had been.\nOn August 15, 1948, the United States founded the Republic of Korea (ROK, also known as\nSouth Korea) in its occupation zone. It was a Western-style democracy, like West Germany.\nSouth Korea\u2019s first presidential election in July 1948, under UN auspices, installed Syngman\nRhee, an authoritarian and anti-communist politician. Across the border, the USSR created\nthe Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK, or North Korea) in September 1948.\nThe provisional government elected Kim Il-sung, a former communist guerilla who had\nfought Japanese occupation, to lead the new country. Two things unified the two leaders:\neach saw his government as the legitimate government of the entire Korean peninsula, and\neach was willing to use force to reunify all Korea under his own flag. This was what made\nthe division of Korea potentially more explosive than Germany. The United Nations, for its\npart, recognized South Korea as the sole legitimate government of all Korea, because it had\ncooperated with the election process.\nThe Two Koreas\nRhee had two primary policies: anticommunism within his own country, and re-\nunification via violence against the North. Rhee was particularly undemocratic, passing\nlaws which outlawed dissent, arresting tens of thousands of political opponents, and even\nassassinating political enemies. The early republic saw several communist uprisings, sup-\nported by the North, most notably on the island of Jeju; upward of 60,000 people were killed\nin these revolts. Rhee made little progress with the ROK economy. Almost his entire GNP\nconsisted of US aid. Although the ROK held most of the agricultural land in Korea, the\ncountry remained impoverished as hundreds of thousands of refugees from North Korea\nflooded the country. Rhee did institute a successful program of land reform, similar to what\nMacArthur had carried out in Japan.\nIn North Korea, Kim combined all the communist parties into the Workers\u2019 Party\nof North Korea; opposition leaders either fled or were imprisoned. Kim immediately set\nup a communist government along Soviet lines, with the Worker\u2019s Party as the sole political\nparty. The party nationalized all industry and passed new legislation on labor and women\u2019s\nrights. With Soviet assistance, he also created the Korean People\u2019s Army (KPA), a force\nmuch more experienced and better-equipped than its counterpart in the south. And when\nthe communist revolts in South Korea failed to overthrow the democratic government, Kim\ndecided that the KPA was the only instrument which could reunify Korea under the com-\nmunist banner.\n124 Chapter 5: Japan and Korea The Korean War is covered in Chapter 3. Suffice it to say here that both Koreas\nwere ravaged by the war, which spanned the entire peninsula in its course. Approximately\nfive million soldiers and civilians died; over half that number were civilians, amounting to\nabout ten percent of the total Korean population.\nDuring the war, Syngman Rhee persecuted political opponents to retain power,\naided by martial law considered necessary during the war. Even after the war, Rhee con-\ntinued his autocratic path \u2013 since the war had ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty,\nthe war technically continued, giving Rhee a permanent excuse to curtail civil liberties. At\none point, Rhee pushed through a constitutional amendment making him exempt from the\neight-year term limit for president, theoretically allowing him to become president-for-life.\nHe also devolved democracy by concentrating administrative power in himself.\nThough these moves were unpopular, the final straw was Rhee\u2019s blatant rigging\nof the 1960 presidential election. Protests led by university students, known as the April\nRevolution, exploded all over the country, and the police and army killed dozens of the\nprotesters. Before April was over, Rhee resigned the presidency and fled to the United\nStates. He died in Honolulu in 1965.\nIn the North, Kim Il-Sung concentrated power into himself, purging, arresting and\nexecuting political opponents in the communist party. After Khrushchev\u2019s denunciation of\nStalin in 1956 (see Chapter 2), the Soviets accused Kim of building up a cult of personality\n(including building giant statues of himself) and practicing the same depravations as Stalin.\nKim remained unmoved; he consid-\nered himself as great a communist\nleader as Lenin or Stalin and looked\ndown on the new Soviet leadership.\nKim arrested tens of thousands of\npeople, not only for political dissent,\nbut for merely criticizing or seem-\ning to insult him. Distinguishing\nhimself from both China and the\nUSSR, Kim implemented a national\nphilosophy known as juche, or in-\ndependence in economics, politics,\nand the military. Kim claimed that\nNorth Korea should not rely on\nother nations, including commu-\nnist ones, for assistance, as it would\nweaken the nation\u2019s international\nposition. All of this earned Kim the\ndispleasure of both his Soviet and\nChinese comrades \u2013 but not enough\nfor them to abandon an ally.\nKim\u2019s policies towards the US and\nSouth Korea remained hostile de-\nspite the peace treaty. Kim publicly\nMap of North and South Korea in\n1993. This shows the post-Korean\nWar border as a dashed line.\nCourtesy of Library of Congress.\n125 declared that reunification under communism was a \u201cnational duty,\u201d and the late 1960s were\ntense indeed. There were several clashes along the DMZ (demilitarized zone) between\nthe two Koreas, and in 1966, North Korean commandos entered South Korea and nearly\nsucceeded in assassinating Korean president Park Chung-hee in the infamous Blue House\nattack. This was quickly followed by the North Korean seizure of a US spy ship, the USS\nPueblo, and holding the crew hostage for nearly a year. Three years later, North Korea shot\ndown an American spy plane, killing all aboard. The US claimed that neither the ship nor\nthe plane had violated North Korean territory, but the US was deeply involved in Vietnam\nat the time, limiting the potential military response.\nNorth Korea also distanced itself from China at this time; Mao Ze-tung was estab-\nlishing ties with the United States and refused to support Kim\u2019s efforts to restart the Korean\nWar. Kim, for his part, derided Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution as \u201cidiocy.\u201d As a result, North\nKorea moved closer to the USSR, and began cultivating new relationships with authoritari-\nan regimes around the world, such as Gaddafi in Libya and Pol Pot in Cambodia.\nThe postwar North Korean economy was slow to recover, especially in the agricul-\ntural sector. Kim collectivized farmland \u2013 that is, nationalized it (made it the property of the\nstate) and forbade private ownership of either the land or the profits derived from it. The\nproduce and profits would be distributed by the state. However, mismanagement (in the\nform of overestimating crop yields, probably to impress the leaders), as well as resistance to\nthe program, led to a manmade famine which killed nearly a million people in 1954 \u2013 1955.\nIn manufacturing, Kim followed the same path as Stalin, emphasizing the military\nand heavy industry at the expense of consumer goods. With Chinese and Soviet assistance,\nNorth Korea rebuilt its shattered manufacturing base and greatly expanded its infrastruc-\nture and educational sectors. It also improved its mining sector, selling extracted minerals\non the international market to fund its manufacturing expansion. Within a few years, the\nNorth Korean economy was the equivalent of the South\u2019s.\nStarting in 1973, however, the situation changed for the worse. Mineral prices fell on\nthe international market, consequently reducing North Korean export income (a common\nproblem in countries whose GNPs depend on exporting raw materials) and forcing the\ncountry to default on foreign loans. The country\u2019s standard of living declined. Furthermore,\nas the capitalist world began to computerize manufacturing and business in the late 1970s,\nNorth Korea (along with the USSR) failed to make the shift to high technology, making it\nmuch less competitive in the international markets.\nGeneral Park Chung-hee\u2019s Coup\nIn the South, Rhee\u2019s removal ushered in a brief period of democracy, but not stabil-\nity. Leftist groups, long suppressed and persecuted by Rhee and the right, now demanded\nreforms and justice. The government prosecuted thousands of police, military, and govern-\nment officials who were accused of corruption or abuse of power. (A swing from one pole\nto the other is common after revolutions, as formerly suppressed groups press their new\nadvantage and perhaps seek revenge.) But the new government had inherited a litany of\neconomic and social problems from the Rhee administration, and the divided government\nwas not up to the task of repairing them with any speed. The government\u2019s relative inef-\nfectiveness and the newfound freedom to protest led to many demonstrations against the\ngovernment, and some in the military feared that the North would take advantage of the\nchaos to attack.\n126 Chapter 5: Japan and Korea On May 16, 1961, Major General Park Chung-\nhee staged a successful military coup. He blamed the gov-\nernment, all the way back to Syngman Rhee, for following\nineffective economic policies, which he contrasted with\nthe Japanese economic miracle. He claimed that such\npolicies weakened South Korea in the face of a continued\ncommunist threat. He pledged to repair the economy,\nstrengthen relations with the United States, eliminate po-\nlitical corruption, and pursue peaceful reunification with\nthe North. He also promised to hold elections within two\nyears, and that he and his government junta would not\nrun for office. In 1963, he kept his promise to hold elec-\ntions, but decided to run for president as candidate of the\nDemocratic Republican Party. He won the election in a\nclose vote.\nPark then instituted a major economic program\nbased on the Japanese model: he would use US financial\naid to build up South Korea\u2019s manufacturing base for\nan export-oriented economy. Like Japan, Park imple-\nmented business-friendly policies, and Park cooperated\nwith the chaebol, which are large family-owned indus-\ntrial conglomerates of immense economic and political\npower. Education and infrastructure were also expand-\ned. Naturally, all this urban, industrial growth did little\nMajor General Park Chung-he. for the farmers, who continued to live in near-poverty.\nPark therefore launched a program to aid the rural poor with infrastructure, irrigation, and\nhousing, all of which reduced rural poverty significantly.\nPark also turned South Korea into a major international player. South Korea still\nhad a poor relationship with Japan, which once brutally occupied the nation. Park estab-\nlished formal relations with Japan in 1965, accepting financial compensation from Japan\n(although not a formal apology, to the chagrin of many in his country). He also sent 300,000\nSouth Korean troops to assist the United States in Vietnam (see Chapter 7), further cement-\ning South Korea as a strong Cold War ally of the Americans.\nPark narrowly won the 1967 presidential election, and it was at this point that\nhis military junta ran up against the limits of Korean democracy. At the time, the Korean\nconstitution forbade presidents from seeking a third term, but Park pushed amendments\nthrough the National Assembly to allow it. This resulted in major protests across the coun-\ntry and the political rise of opposition leader Kim Dae-jung. Park was able to hold on and\nwin the 1971 presidential elections. However, his political opposition made gains in the\nNational Assembly, threatening his power. In 1972, Park declared martial law, suspending\nboth the National Assembly and the constitution. Rather than returning to civilian govern-\nment, Park had taken South Korea into military dictatorship.\nThe rest of Park\u2019s political career was fraught with controversy and conflict. He cre-\nated a new constitution which granted his junta sweeping political power, removing presi-\ndential term limits and bringing the legislature, judiciary, and educational sector under his\ncontrol. The president was no longer a directly-elected position. This led to years of massive\nprotests and demonstrations, to which Park responded with suppression and violence. The\neconomy continued to grow throughout this period, however.\nPark\u2019s reign came to an end in 1979 when he was assassinated by Kim Jae-gyu,\n127 Director of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency. Kim\u2019s position was in danger, and Park\nthought that he wasn\u2019t sufficiently vicious in his suppression of demonstrators and political\nopponents; but it has also been revealed that he had secret pro-democracy leanings and was\ntrying to moderate Park\u2019s behavior. It is a longstanding controversy in South Korea over\nwhether Kim killed Park for personal or political reasons. In any case, he was hanged for\ntreason.\nPark also remains a divisive figure. He greatly improved the South Korean econ-\nomy and forged the nation into a strong international presence, but did so at the cost of\ndemocracy; he jailed and murdered political opponents. He was certainly problematic for\nthe United States. The superpower was trying to contain communism and had to present\nitself as a protector of human rights and democracy worldwide. Having an anticommunist\nally like Park behave like a dictator stained America\u2019s image and provided fine propaganda\nmaterial to the communists, who jumped on this example of capitalist hypocrisy.\nNorth Korea and Kim Jong-il\nAcross the border, North Korea was increasingly impoverished and isolated. Ronald\nReagan\u2019s election in 1979 brought an end to d\u00e9tente (see Chapter 3) and increased pressure\non the communist nation. Chinese \u2013 Soviet rivalry and distrust remained high, splitting the\ncommunist world at a time when Kim needed its economic support. South Korea was grow-\ning not only economically stronger, but also more respected around the world, particularly\nafter Park\u2019s removal from power. In 1981, Seoul (capital of South Korea) was selected as the\nsite of the 1988 Olympics, and Kim\u2019s proposal that the two Koreas co-host the Olympics\nwas ignored. As the world had seen with the 1966 Blue House attack, North Korea typically\naddressed both its international and domestic problems with violence rather than negotia-\ntions.\nIn 1980, Kim Jong-il, Kim Il-sung\u2019s son, emerged as the heir apparent to his father\u2019s\nalmost godlike position in the country. He was already highly placed in North Korean mil-\nitary and politics. The younger Kim lacked the military credentials and experience of his\nfather, but he soon found ways to distinguish himself, after his father\u2019s fashion.\nIn 1983, the younger Kim ordered the assassination of Chun Doo-hwan, President\nof South Korea, while he was visiting Rangoon in Burma. The bombing attack at a war me-\nmorial killed 18 South Korean officials and journalists; Chun escaped harm only because\nhe was late to the event. Kim also ordered the bombing of Korean Air Flight 858 in 1987,\nkilling all 115 people aboard. These attacks were probably intended to tarnish South Korea\u2019s\nimage, making it appear weak and insecure just before the Olympics. Kim Jong-il probably\nalso intended to show his own military and party that he was tough enough to confront\nSouth Korea. In international terms, the attacks only hurt North Korea, further isolating it.\nThe US placed the nation on its list of terrorism-supporting countries.\nKim Il-sung died of a sudden heart attack in 1994, and Kim Jong-il took over as\nleader of North Korea. The country was now in dire economic straits. The collapse of the\nUSSR ended about half of North Korea\u2019s economic aid, leaving China as its last major sup-\nporter. Flooding in 1995 led to widespread famine in North Korea, compounding Kim\u2019s\nproblems. Kim\u2019s unlikely response was a policy known as songun, or \u201cmilitary first.\u201d This\ninvested heavily in the military at the expense of the rest of the economy. It may be that Kim\nwas trying to strengthen his relationship with his generals, as the military was his base of\npolitical and social power; it may have also been meant to dissuade the South from thinking\nthat it could now attack the weakened North. As is typical with North Korea and other\nauthoritarian countries, the real reasons for government policies are unclear, and we are left\nto guess.\n128 Chapter 5: Japan and Korea One important development in North Korea, and one watched carefully by the\nglobal community, was its nuclear program. North Korea\u2019s first nuclear power plant went\nonline in 1986. As this and other planned reactors could help produce the plutonium\nneeded to create nuclear weapons, the United States entered into a series of negotiations\nwith North Korea to prevent it from obtaining such materials. It offered to build a reactor\nfor North Korea (one which could not produce weapons-grade materials) if North Korea\nshut down its reactors. It also suspended military exercises with South Korea and offered\ncertain economic aid. North Korea initially agreed, but the plan eventually broke down\nafter long negotiations, and North Korea restarted its reactors. The nation must have put the\nreactor to its intended use because, in 2006, North Korea detonated its first atomic bomb.\nIt also developed an indigenous ICBM to deliver nuclear warheads, possibly with the inten-\ntion of threatening the United States mainland.\nThis brought North Korea and the Americans back to the negotiating table, which\nmay have been Kim\u2019s intention all along. The US offered economic aid if North Korea aban-\ndoned its nuclear ambitions. North Korea again shut down a reactor, only to restart it in\n2009.\nIn 2010, North Korea again increased tensions on the peninsula with attacks on\nthe South Korean navy and shelling of its territory; but North Korea was about to undergo\nanother unexpected change.\nSecond Junta and Democratization\nIn South Korea, Park\u2019s assassination led almost immediately to another military\ncoup led by General Chun Doo-Hwan. Unsurprisingly, this led to a new round of protests,\nand Chun responded by arresting opposition politicians and activ-\nists. University students in the city of Gwangju launched protests\nwhich were put down by the military with force, causing over a\nthousand civilian casualties. Before the end of 1980, Chun had writ-\nten a new constitution for South Korea. He pledged to restore de-\nmocracy, and his constitution established the power of the National\nAssembly and Supreme court. But it also decreed that the President\nwas to be elected by the indirect vote of politicians; by appointing\nmilitary officers to government positions, Chun guaranteed that the\njunta\u2019s chosen candidate would win. The public was not fooled by\nthis anti-democratic system.\nEconomically, South Korea did quite well under Chun, his author-\nitarianism aside. The high-tech manufacturing sector thrived in the\nexport market under careful government guidance. But since man-\nufacturing only provides urban jobs, the rural economy stagnated,\nleading to a widening wealth gap and increasing regional tensions.\nAnd Chun\u2019s authoritarian rule was already generating tension, as\nhis political prisoners remained in jail and the media remained cen-\nsured.\nTensions finally came to a head in 1987 after a university activist\nwas killed by police during interrogation. This was the match that\nlit the June Struggle, a mass movement of over a million people\nprotesting the government. Such was the social pressure that the\njunta\u2019s presidential candidate, General Roh Tae-woo, declared that\nthe next president would be chosen via direct election; he also called\nfor improved human rights in South Korea. He passed the necessary\nKim Jong-Il.\nImage by the Kremlin.\n129 amendments to the constitution, and, in December, he became the first directly-elected\nSouth Korean president in sixteen years, largely because the other parties were too divided\nto form a coherent opposition.\nRoh Tae-woo made good on his pro-democracy promises, removing the last rem-\nnants of military rule. Hosting the Olympic games in 1988 boosted South Korea\u2019s interna-\ntional prestige, and Roh took steps to improve relations with North Korea via a series of\nhigh-level talks, cultural exchanges, and denuclearization agreements.\nRoh was followed in 1993 by Kim Young-sam, the first civilian president since\n1962. Kim oversaw continued democratization and also a reckoning with the past, as both\nChun and Roh were arrested, tried, and imprisoned for their roles in the coup following\nPark\u2019s death, and for the Gwangju massacre and other human rights violations. Both former\npresidents were pardoned soon afterwards, however. In 1997, a financial crisis swept across\nAsia, including South Korea, where the economy was already slowing after the sharp growth\nof the 1980s. The new crisis allowed pro-democracy activist Kim Dae-jung to win the next\npresidential election in the same year.\nKim Dae-jung was perhaps the most notable South Korean president after Park. He\naddressed the 1997 financial crisis with an aggressive policy of government intervention\nwhich quickly ended the crisis. He also took steps to reform the chaebol system; the fami-\nly-run conglomerates had grown monopolistic and were often accused of corruption. Kim\ninstituted a series of changes which forced the chaebol to practice greater transparency in\ntheir finances, making crimes more difficult to hide.\nBut Kim Dae-jung\u2019s greatest accomplishment was his 1998 \u201cSunshine Policy.\u201d The\ntwo Koreas had been born out of the Cold War. With the fall of the USSR in 1991, and\nthe subsequent end of the Cold War, South Korea suffered something of an identity crisis.\nWithout a Cold War, was North Korea still an enemy? Furthermore, North Korea\u2019s economy\nwas a shambles, with millions of people starving; South Korea could assist the North in re-\nbuilding its economy, which might temper the North\u2019s hostility to the South. The result was\na series of talks between the two Koreas and reunions of families separated by the border.\nFor his efforts, Kim Dae-jung was awarded the 2000 Nobel Peace Prize. The program had\nits ups and downs, though. In 2002, US President George Bush labelled North Korea as an\nenemy in his \u201cAxis of Evil\u201d speech. Consequently, North Korea reversed its denuclearization\nprogram and even engaged in naval skirmishes with the South Korean navy.\nKim\u2019s successor as president, Roh Moo-hyun, continued the Sunshine Policy with\nsome success, providing considerable economic aid to the North. The program was not\nwithout its critics. Older generations, who remembered the war, may have been more ret-\nicent towards peace efforts. Others pointed out that North Korea\u2019s own government was\nthe cause of the North Korean famine, and believed that starvation would drive the North\nKoreans to overthrow their government. Food aid, they claimed, was forestalling the anti-\ncommunist revolt.\nThe Sunshine Policy ended in 2008. North Korea began testing new atomic weap-\nons and the missiles necessary to carry them, while South Korea elected a conservative, Lee\nMyung-bak, to the presidency. This combination brought the policy to an end. There were\nfurther attempts to restart the policy in 2017, with cultural exchanges and talks; but they\nfizzled out by 2019, accomplishing little of consequence.\nSince Kim Dae-jung\u2019s presidency, politics have stabilized in South Korea, ending the\ndays of military juntas. Corruption in government, however, seems all too common, as two\nformer South Korean presidents have served time on corruption charges while a third com-\nmitted suicide before he could be imprisoned. But the long story of South Korea has been\none of strong postwar economic development, guided by the government, alongside slow\ndemocratization. Unlike Germany or Japan, Korea had no historical experience with de-\nmocracy, so the system was slower to take root there. Furthermore, the Korean War, which\ntechnically never ended, allowed military governments to suppress political opponents on\n130 Chapter 5: Japan and Korea the grounds that they were pro-communist. Since the collapse of the USSR and the end of\nthe Cold War, this is no longer a viable tool of political control; this allowed other political\nparties to gain traction.\nNorth Korea under Kim Jong-un\nKim Jong-il died in December 2011; his son, Kim Jong-un, immediately assumed\ncontrol of the party and nation, continuing the traditional cult of personality around the\nKim family. He immediately removed potential political rivals by arresting and imprison-\ning them. Kim\u2019s uncle, Jang Song-thaek, was highly respected within the government; Kim\nhad him arrested, publicly denounced for treason, and executed. In this way, Kim removed\nanyone who could pose a threat to his power.\nIn 2017, Kim successfully tested a ballistic missile capable of reaching the United\nStates, upping the tension in one of the last remnants of the Cold War. Denuclearization\ntalks were reopened with US President Trump, but quickly collapsed without firm agree-\nments.\nThe youngest Kim has continued not only his family\u2019s cult of personality, but also\nits Stalinist surveillance state. Life in North Korea is extremely regimented and monitored;\nno dissent is permitted, and even to be suspected of disloyalty is punishable with imprison-\nment or death (one of the crimes Jang Song-thaek was accused of was not clapping enthusi-\nastically enough at public events).\nThe North Korean economy remains state-controlled, still aligned with the juche\nprinciples of the Cold War. The collapse of the USSR meant that North Korea lost a major\ninternational supporter, and now must rely on China for economic support. North Korea\nhas been embargoed by several nations and by the United Nations. Many of these embar-\ngoes were enacted after North Korea tested its first nuclear weapon in contravention of\ninternational law. China is now North Korea\u2019s last major supporter, responsible for half its\ntrade. China has had a tumultuous relationship with North Korea, and relations have waxed\nand waned over the years; nevertheless, China continued to support North Korea because\nA North Korean missile on parade. it makes North Korea dependent on its northern neighbor. This gives China considerable\nImage by the government of power over what amounts to a buffer zone between its border and capitalist South Korea.\nNorth Korea.\n131 North Korea is very creative in securing income despite the embargoes and devel-\noped a unique economy based on crime. Although the extent of these efforts is debated,\nthere is widespread evidence of the North Korean government producing and distributing\ncounterfeit currency and illicit drugs. It is also accused of participating in human trafficking\nand the illegal arms trade. These efforts probably pay for the country\u2019s nuclear program, as\nwell as supply the party elite with luxury goods while the common citizen struggles to feed\nhimself.\nConclusions\nThe postwar histories of Japan, South Korea, and North Korea were intimately linked to the Cold War, a\nsituation which none of the three nations created. The Korean War could not have happened without the support\nof the USSR and China, making the peninsula just another front in the global struggle between superpowers.\nContinuous US support for Japan and South Korea were both predicated on the goal of preventing either country\nfrom falling to communism, and that each country would assist the US in the Cold War.\nJapan had major advantages over South Korea in its journey into democracy. Japan had a democracy\nbefore the fascist coup of the 1930s; that meant that the people had experience in democracy and were able to\nreturn to it quite easily. South Korea had no such history, instead having been a colony of Japan. Furthermore,\nMacArthur ran a very effective rebuilding program in Japan, while the American occupation authority in South\nKorea was often downright amateurish.\nThe biggest difference between Japan and South Korea, however, was the Korean war. The war has kept\nSouth Korea in a constant state of tension. This permanent security threat allowed for the rise of authoritarian\nleaders who insisted that strong government control was necessary to protect the nation; anyone who insisted\non more democracy was castigated as a traitor who would weaken the country and allow the enemy to win. This\nwartime authoritarianism delayed the development of democracy, particularly since South Korea had no history\nof democracy and thus no model to refer to.\nDespite the difficulties, South Korea eventually found its way to democracy, though the tensions with\nNorth Korea continue to smolder. South Korea and Japan have both grown into major international players, con-\ntributing to the global economy and culture. North Korea, by contrast, is now an international pariah, embar-\ngoed by most of the world. South Korea, aided by the United States, continues to guard the border between the\ntwo countries and skirmishes are always possible. Since war against North Korea is not considered an acceptable\nsolution, due to the casualties it would entail, the situation with North Korea remains in limbo, and will probably\nstay that way until a coup or other change of leadership in North Korea changes the situation from within.\nSuggested Further Reading\nA Cultural History of Postwar Japan: 1945-1980 by Shunsuke Tsurumi (Routledge, 2010.

In order\nto accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea and air forces, as well as other war potential, will\nnever be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized.\u201d\n\u2014 Article 9, The Constitution of Japan (1947)\n134 Chapter 5: Japan and Korea Bilateral Security Treaty Between the United States of America and Japan (September 8, 1951)\nJapan has this day signed a treaty of peace with the Allied Powers. On the coming into\nforce of that treaty, Japan will not have the effective means to exercise its inherent right of self-\ndefense because it has been disarmed.\nThere is danger to Japan in this situation because irresponsible militarism has not yet\nbeen driven from the world. Therefore, Japan desires a security treaty with the United States of\nAmerica to come into force simultaneously with the treaty of peace between the United States of\nAmerica and Japan.\nThe treaty of peace recognizes that Japan as a sovereign nation has the right to enter into\ncollective security arrangements, and further, the Charter of the United Nations recognizes that\nall nations possess an inherent right of individual and collective self-defense.\nIn exercise of these rights, Japan desires, as a provisional arrangement for its defense,\nthat the United States of America should maintain armed forces of its own in and about Japan\nso as to deter armed attack upon Japan.\nThe United States of America, in the interest of peace and security, is at present willing\nto maintain certain of its armed forces in and about Japan, in the expectation, however, that\nJapan will itself increasingly assume responsibility for its own defense against direct and\nindirect aggression, always avoiding any armament which could be an offensive threat or serve\nother than to promote peace and security in accordance with the purposes and principles of the\nUnited Nations Charter.\nAccordingly, the two countries have agreed as follows:\nArticle 1.\nJapan grants, and the United States of America accepts, the right, upon the\ncoming into force of the Treaty of Peace and of this Treaty, to dispose United States land, air,\nand sea forces in and about Japan. Such forces may be utilized to contribute to the maintenance\nof international peace and security in the Far East and to the security of Japan against armed\nattack from without, including assistance given at the express request of the Japanese\nGovernment to put down large-scale internal riots and disturbances in Japan, caused through\ninstigation or intervention by an outside power or powers.\nArticle 2.\nDuring the exercise of the right referred to in Article 1, Japan will not grant,\nwithout the prior consent of the United States of America, any bases or any rights, powers or\nauthority whatsoever, in or relating to bases or the right of garrison or of maneuver, or transit of\nground, air, or naval forces to any third power.\nArticle 3.\nThe conditions which shall govern the disposition of armed forces of the\nUnited States of America in and about Japan shall be determined by administrative agreements\n135 between the two Governments.\nArticle 4.\nThis treaty shall expire whenever in the opinion of the governments of the\nUnited States of America and Japan there shall have come into force such United Nations\narrangements or such alternative individual or collective security dispositions as will\nsatisfactorily provide for the maintenance by the United Nations or otherwise of international\npeace and security in the Japan area.\n\u201cOn Eliminating Dogmatism and Formalism and Establishing Juche [Chuch\u2019e] in Ideological Work\u201d\n(Speech, 1955)\nBy Kim Il Sung\nToday I want to address a few remarks to you on the shortcomings in our Party\u2019s\nideological work and on how to eliminate them in the future. As you learned at yesterday\u2019s\nsession, there have been serious ideological errors on the literary front. It is obvious, then, that\nour propaganda work also cannot have been faultless. It is to be regretted that it suffers in many\nrespects from dogmatism and formalism.\nThe principal shortcomings in ideological work are the failure to delve deeply into all\nmatters and the lack of Juche. It may not be correct to say Juche is lacking, but, in fact, it has not\nyet been firmly established. This is a serious matter. We must thoroughly rectify this\nshortcoming. Unless this problem is solved, we cannot hope for good results in ideological\nwork.\nWhy does our ideological work suffer from dogmatism and formalism? Why do our\npropaganda and agitation workers only embellish the facade and fail to go deeply into matters,\nand why do they merely copy and memorize things foreign, instead of working creatively? This\noffers us food for serious reflection.\nWhat is Juche in our Party\u2019s ideological work? What are we doing? We are not engaged\nin any other country\u2019s revolution, but solely in the Korean revolution. This, the Korean\nrevolution, determines the essence of Juche in the ideological work of our Party. Therefore, all\nideological work must be subordinated to the interests of the Korean revolution. When we\nstudy the history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the history of the Chinese\nrevolution, or the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, it is entirely for the purpose of correctly\ncarrying out our own revolution.\nBy saying that the ideological work of our Party is lacking in Juche, I do not mean, of\ncourse, that we have not made the revolution and that our revolutionary work was undertaken\nby outsiders. Nonetheless, Juche has not been firmly established in ideological work, and this\nleads to dogmatic and formalistic errors and does much harm to our revolutionary cause.\nTo make revolution in Korea we must know Korean history and geography as well as\nthe customs of the Korean people. Only then is it possible to educate our people in a way that\nsuits them and to inspire in them an ardent love for their native place and their motherland.\nIt is of paramount importance to study and widely publicize among the working people\n136 Chapter 5: Japan and Korea the history of our country and of our people\u2019s struggle. ... Only when we educate our people in\nthe history of their own struggle and its traditions can we stimulate their national pride and\nrouse the broad masses to revolutionary struggle. Yet, many of our functionaries are ignorant of\nour country\u2019s history and so do not strive to discover, inherit and carry forward our fine\ntraditions. Unless this is corrected, it will lead, in the long run, to the negation of Korean\nhistory.\n...\nOnce I visited a People\u2019s Army rest home, where there was a picture of the Siberian\nsteppe on the wall. Russians probably like that landscape. But we Korean people like the\nbeautiful scenery of our own country. There are beautiful mountains such as Kumgang and\nMyohyang in our country. There are clear streams, the blue sea with its rolling waves, and\nfields with their ripening crops. If we are to inspire in our People\u2019s Army men a love for their\nnative place and their country, we must display more pictures of our own landscapes. ... I\nnoticed in a primary school that all the portraits on the walls were of foreigners, such as\nMayakovsky and Pushkin, but there were none of Koreans. If children are educated in this way,\nhow can they be expected to have national pride? ...\nWe should study our own things in earnest and get to know them well. ...\n...\nIt is important in our work to grasp revolutionary truth, Marxist-Leninist truth, and\napply it correctly to our actual conditions. There should be no set rule that we must follow the\nSoviet pattern. Some advocate the Soviet way and others the Chinese, but is it not high time to\nwork out our own? The point is that we should not mechanically copy the forms and methods\nof the Soviet Union, but should learn from its experience in struggle and from the truth of\nMarxism-Leninism. So, while learning from the experience of the Soviet Union, we must put\nstress not on the form but on the essence of its experience. ...\nMerely copying the forms used by others instead of learning the truth of Marxism-\nLeninism does us no good, only harm. In both revolutionary struggle and construction, we\nshould firmly adhere to Marxist-Leninist principles, applying them in a creative way to suit the\nspecific conditions and national characteristics of our country. If we mechanically apply foreign\nexperience, disregarding the history of our country and the traditions of our people and\nwithout taking account of our own realities and our people\u2019s political level, we will commit\ndogmatic errors and do much harm to the revolutionary cause. This is not fidelity to Marxism-\nLeninism nor to internationalism. It runs counter to them.\nSelections from To Build a Nation (1971)\nby Park Chung-hee\nBefore May 16 the Korean economy was in disorder. Accumulated political blunders\nand misguided economic policy had utterly disarranged it. The postwar rehabilitation of the\nnation was at a near-standstill, while the amount of grant-type foreign aid was lessening.\nEconomic stagnation aggravated poverty and unemployment. Farmers\u2019 debts rose sharply ...\nWith growth at a standstill at the turn of the 1960s, Korea found itself one of the lowest income\ncountries in the world. The industrial structure was not solid. Due to a huge gravitation toward\nthem of a huge amount of foreign aid, the secondary and tertiary industries seemed excessively\n137 swollen in comparison with primary industry. ...\n...\nThe institutional and moral aspects of the society were no better. People fatalistically\ntook poverty and reliance on foreign aid as unavoidable facts of life. Businessmen and\nindustrialists failed to fulfill their important role in economic development. Many corrupt\ngovernment officials and parvenus worked together to amass illegal fortunes. The market,\nsuffering from its small scale and lack of vigorous competition, did not function normally. The\nunderdeveloped agricultural system was unable to meet the demand for food \u2014 we were\nforced to rely on the farm products of advanced countries. The whole economy was afflicted by\ninexperience, inefficiency, and wasteful management.\nWhen I took over power as the leader of the revolutionary group on 16 May 1961, I felt,\nhonestly speaking, as if I had been given a pilfered household or a bankrupt firm to manage.\nAround me I could find little hope or encouragement. The outlook was bleak.\nBut I had to rise above this pessimism to rehabilitate the household. I had to break, once\nand for all, the vicious circle of poverty and economic stagnation. Only by curing the abnormal\neconomic structure could we lay the foundation for decent living standards. But I soon came to\nrealize the difficulty of simultaneously achieving our goals of social stability and economic\ndevelopment and the goal of efficient government. I was also aware of the fact that economic\ndevelopment in the capitalist manner requires not only an immense investment of money and\nmaterials but also a stable political situation and competent administrators.\nTo achieve this stability, the military revolutionary government temporarily suspended\npolitical activities of students, the press, labor unions, and other social and political\norganizations, which had caused political crises and social unrest during the rule of the\nDemocratic Party regime. We also made it clear that civilian government would be restored in\n1963.\nMeanwhile, we organized a planning committee of college professors and experts with\nspecialized knowledge in many fields. By mobilizing the maximum available expertise for\ngovernment administration and policy making, we intended to hold in check the arbitrariness\nand rashness of the military officers. The establishment of this committee served as a turning\npoint. Korean professors began to show positive interest in the realities of the country and to\npresent policy recommendations on the basis of scientific analyses of the country\u2019s situation.\nEven though not all of these recommendations could be justified in terms of efficiency and\nrationality, their advice was of great help to the revolutionary government. Thus the Confucian\ntradition of Yi Korea, in which scholars played a positive part in government affairs, seems to\nhave been revived.\nThe key to improving a backward economy is the way one uses human resources, for\neconomic development is a human undertaking, impossible without combining the people\u2019s\npotential into a dynamic driving force. This task requires not only strong national willpower\nbut also the ability to translate willpower into achievement. Blueprints must be drawn and\nexplained. If people have a sympathetic understanding of a task, they will voluntarily\nparticipate in it.\n138 Chapter 5: Japan and Korea In 1961 the revolutionary government announced the first Five-Year Economic\nDevelopment Plan (to start in 1962), the first such overall development program ever prepared\nfor Korea. To prepare it, the revolutionary government mobilized all the wisdom and\nknowledge available and set clear goals, the primary goal being to establish a self-supporting\nindustrial economy. The principle of free enterprise and respect for the creativity of private\nindustry was adopted, for in this way we believed that the private sector would be encouraged\nto act voluntarily. Under the plan, however, the economy was not entirely free, since\ndevelopment of basic industries was directed by the government.\nTaking into consideration the structural characteristics of the Korean economy, the five-year\nplan gave priority to the following things:\n1. Development of energy industries such as coal production and electric\npower;\n2. Expansion of agricultural production aimed at increasing farm income\nand correcting the structural imbalance of the national economy;\n3. Development of basic industries and the economic infrastructure;\n4. Maximum utilization of idle resources; increased employment;\nconservation and utilization of land;\n5. Improvement of the balance of payments through export promotion;\n6. Promotion of science and technology.\nY\u014fng-ho Ch\u2019oe, Peter H. Lee, and Wm. Theodore de Bary, ed.

Europe and North America became the richest,\nmost powerful, most consequential regions in the world. Modern science, capitalism, and\nindustrialization were all born in the West, and they allowed the West to dominate the rest of the\nworld, with the great European empires spanning the globe.\nThis was a new development. For most of human history, one would have looked to either\nthe Middle East or Asia for the global centers of power and culture. When Vasco de Gama arrived\nin India, reconnecting Europe to the spice trade, he encountered a society vastly wealthier and\nmore cosmopolitan than his own. Seventeenth-century China was wealthier than the British\nEmpire \u2013 so wealthy that it hardly needed foreign trade, given its massive domestic market.\n141 The Edict of Abdication\nof the last emperor of the\nQing Dynasty, Puyi. This\ndocument officially ended\nmonarchy in China.\nThe situation changed over the next four hundred and fifty years. The British Empire\nconquered the Mughal, Maratha, and Sikh empires of the Indian subcontinent, as well as\nthe remaining independent kingdoms of the region, and combined them all into what they\ntermed India. While the Western nations could not conquer China \u2013 it was simply too big\n\u2013 the West did have a sufficiently-large technological advantage over the Chinese that they\ncould extort and otherwise dominate and humiliate the Chinese.\nThe Asians have forgotten neither their glorious empires, nor the humiliations, of\nthe past. There is a school of historical thought (Declinism) which affirms that the West has\nseen the apex of its power; that the world wars demoralized and impoverished the West,\nrendering their empires untenable and allowing the new rise of Asia, manifest primarily by\npostwar China and Japan. While obituaries for the West are premature, the explosive rise of\nAsian economies has presented a challenge to American hegemony, particularly since the\nend of the Cold War.\nThis chapter will investigate the postwar rise of the world\u2019s two most populous na-\ntions, China and India. These two nations addressed their problems in radically different\nways, setting them on very different paths to the future.\nThe Republic of China\nIn the 19th century, China was an empire ruled by the Qing Dynasty. The dynasty\nwas notably conservative, refusing to modernize its economy; as a result, while the Western\nworld gained strength from industrialization and capitalism, China was falling behind.\nWhile not even the mighty British Empire could conquer China, various nations could\nextort the Qing Empire. For example, the British fought two successful wars against China,\nknown as the Opium Wars, to force China to allow them to sell opium in the empire. After\nthe Second Opium War, Britain also forced China into leasing them the island of Hong\nKong, a humiliation the Chinese would not forget. Other nations exploited China\u2019s weak-\nness as well.\nThese \u201cnational humiliations,\u201d as the Chinese called them, led to a repudiation of\nthe dynasty and the Xinhai Rebellion in 1911. A successful revolt by military units against\nthe dynasty established the Republic of China, China\u2019s first democracy, with Sun Yat-sen\nas the first President. Unfortunately, as with so many new democracies, the peace was short-\nlived. The new government was unable to prevent the country from fragmenting into fac-\ntions and kingdoms led by local warlords. Furthermore, the ruling party (the Kuomintang,\nor KMT), split into left- and right-wing factions. General Chiang Kai-shek, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of\n142 Chapter 6: China and India After World War II Sun Yat-sen, led the rightist faction to a bloody victory over the left in 1928, and assumed\ncontrol of the national government.\nStanding against the KMT were not only the warlords, but also the Chinese\nCommunist Party (CCP). The communists were led by a man of extraordinary charisma:\nMao Zedong, the scion of a wealthy agricultural family from Shaoshan. Mao rose through\nthe ranks of the CCP, leading protests and uprisings against the KMT government. In 1931,\nhe even led the CCP to capture several mountainous regions of central China and declare\nthem an independent communist state (the Soviet Chinese Republic). However, a civil\nwar within the communist state allowed the KMT to conquer it; Mao then led the CCP on\nlongest military retreat in history (the Long March) into Western China, where he once\nMao Zedong\nagain rebuilt the People\u2019s Army and prepared to try again.\nIn the meantime, the KMT had conquered most of the warlords, reuniting their\nterritory with the nation. Unfortunately for Chiang, this did not lead to peace, as Japan\ninvaded the Chinese province of Manchuria in 1931, as a prequel to its attempt at conquer-\ning all of China. Consequently, in 1935, Chiang and Mao agreed to fight together against\nthe Japanese, but during the war (1931 to 1945), spent as much time fighting each other as\nfighting the Japanese.\nBesides the external threats he faced, Chiang also caused himself problems with his\nown policies. Although a democracy on paper, China, under Chiang and the KMT, became\na one-party, authoritarian state. Chiang and his family were often accused of nepotism and\ngraft. Political opponents were brutally repressed. This generated ill-will among the people,\na factor which would become critical in 1946.\nChiang Kai-Shek\nDespite their many advantages, the Japanese proved incapable of conquering\nChina. The United States provided considerable military and economic aid to the KMT\ngovernment, and the CCP also fought successfully against the Japanese. Japan was forced\nto surrender to the Americans in 1945, and their forces withdrew from China. The fragile\npeace between the KMT and the CCP was soon abandoned, thus beginning the Chinese\nCommunist Revolution, the battle for control of China.\nThe CCP enjoyed several advantages over the KMT, not least of which was that the\ncorruption of Chiang\u2019s government destroyed its credibility with its own people, leading\npeople to join the communists. Furthermore, the KMT military was a shambles, uncoor-\ndinated and unprofessional. When the communists closed in, Chiang Kai-shek fled to the\nMao Zedong (left) and\nChiang Kai-shek (right)\ncelebrate their 1935\ncollaboration against the\nJapanese. Within five years,\nthey were at war again.\n143 island of Taiwan in 1948 in a well-prepared retreat, with the intention of one day returning\nto reconquer China. The CCP completed the conquest of China in October 1949, and Mao\ndeclared the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).\nMao\u2019s first act was to initiate a purge of all suspected enemies of the state, from\nwealthy landowners to former KMT operatives. Just as economists have targets for unem-\nployment and the GNP, Mao had execution targets. He calculated that, in order to eliminate\nlingering anticommunists, the CCP would have to execute one-tenth of one percent of\nthe entire population. This was done via public executions for the purpose of terrorizing\nthe population. Just to be accused was usually enough to guarantee death in the explosive\npost-revolutionary environment. In the first four years of the PRC, the CCP executed be-\ntween three and five million people, with another million and a half sent to labor camps,\nperhaps never to return.\nSuch harshness prevented many educated people in China from participating in\ngovernment, for fear of offending the CCP or being accused of disloyalty. Therefore, in\n1957, Mao launched the Hundred Flowers Campaign, which invited constructive criti-\ncism of government policies. Within a year, the volume of criticism angered Mao; he now\nfelt threatened by anyone opposing his ideas. He therefore ordered the arrest and imprison-\nment of 300,000 people who had criticized his policies.\nThese anti-rightist campaigns effectively silenced criticism of Mao and the CCP,\nassuring that future errors would remain unaddressed. And Mao was about to make an\nerror of colossal proportions.\nImpatient of the slow development of the Chinese economy, Mao launched a mas-\nsive program known as the Great Leap Forward. This was designed to make China the\neconomic equivalent of the United States in just fifteen years. The plan was to mobilize the\nChinese people to work day and night, so that their numbers might compensate for the low\ndegree of technology they possessed. The program focused on two main sectors: steelmak-\ning and agriculture.\nIn the steelmaking campaign, people collected recyclable iron and steel, built\nmakeshift furnaces in their villages, and tried to provide the government with the quotas\nit set. But such ad-hoc methods could only produce useless, low-quality steel. Properly\ntrained metallurgists in China knew this from the start, but no one dared speak out after the\nHundred Flowers Campaign. The program was a short-lived failure.\nWorse still, the effort to increase grain output led to disaster and famine, as had\nthe earlier attempts at collectivization in North Korea. Party officials overstated the amount\nof grain the farms produced, so that they would not be punished for failure. But when the\ngovernment collected the grain for redistribution, it took grain according to the inflated\nfigures, and consequently left the peasants with nothing to eat. Rather than admit their lies\nand face execution, the officials simply let the peasants starve to death. The results are diffi-\ncult to calculate; some estimates are that 20 to 50 million people either died of starvation or\nwere executed for resisting the program. This makes the famine one of the worst, if not the\nworst, famine on record \u2013 and it was completely avoidable.\nFinally, in 1962, the CCP accepted that the Great Leap Forward had been an error.\nMao went into semi-retirement, and the President of China, Liu Shaoqi, moderated eco-\nnomic policies in order to repair the economy. This did not sit well with Mao, who saw\nopposition to his policies as anti-communism and, worse, a personal affront.\nTo regain control of the country from Liu, Mao, who was still the Chairman of the\nCCP, launched the Cultural Revolution in 1966. He claimed that bourgeois elements had\ntaken control of the CCP and wanted to reinstitute capitalism in China; he wanted to launch\na new revolution to remove them and restart his Maoist policies. To do so, he bypassed the\nusual instruments of state power and built up a cult of personality among the young, forcing\neveryone to carry a copy of The Sayings of Chairman Mao, better known as \u201cThe Little Red\n144 Chapter 6: China and India After World War II Book.\u201d His followers organized into cadres of \u201cRed Guards\u201d who harassed, attacked, and\nkilled anyone who they believed was against Mao, including prominent CCP officials who\nhad fought alongside Mao since the beginning.\nChina\u2019s international relations were tumultuous. The most important early relation-\nship was obviously with the USSR, the communist state on China\u2019s border. Although Mao\nadmired the Soviet Union\u2019s accomplishments, he and Stalin did not trust each other very\nwell, disagreeing over Korean War policy as well as other issues. After Stalin\u2019s death in 1953,\nrelations deteriorated further, since Mao considered himself a more important communist\nleader than Khrushchev; there were even skirmishes on the Sino-Soviet border in 1969, and\nthe Soviets encouraged the ethnic Uighurs of Western China to rebel against Mao. By 1956,\nthe Sino-Soviet Split had hardened.\nThis spat between the communist giants did not go unnoticed. US President Richard\nNixon decided to leverage the split by establishing relations with the PRC. The US had cut\nall relations with the PRC after their revolution and considered Chiang\u2019s government in\nTaiwan as the sole legitimate government of China, as did the United Nations. Nixon\u2019s hope\nwas that, by driving a wedge between China and the USSR by forging closer ties with China,\nthe US might be better able to get them both to retract their support for North Vietnam\n(see Chapter 7). He also perhaps hoped that it would frighten the USSR into agreeing to\nnuclear weapons reduction talks. Mao stood to gain from establishing relations with the US;\nhe could improve his economy without aid from the USSR and establish himself as a major\nworld power, not second-fiddle to the Soviets. Mao did not like being second to anyone.\nAs a result of these overtures, Richard Nixon became the first US President to visit\nChina in 1972, where he met Mao Zedong. This led to the lifting of US trade sanctions\nagainst the PRC, something that would develop into one of the biggest trade relationships in\nhistory, with the US serving as the largest market for Chinese goods, despite all ideological\ndifferences. As a precondition for complete diplomatic relations, the US had to acknowledge\nthe CCP, not the Taiwanese government, as the legitimate government of China, and did so\nin 1979. The UN had already recognized the PRC as the legitimate government of China in\n1971, when the PRC threatened to leave the UN if it did not do so.\nThe Cultural Revolution did not really end until Mao died in 1976. He was replaced\nas CCP Chairman by his hand-picked successor, Hua Guofeng, who promised to continue\nMao\u2019s policies. After Mao\u2019s disastrous programs, few in the CCP\u2019s leadership wanted a new\nversion of Mao in power. But Hua was opposed by a remarkable politician named Deng\nXiaoping, who had once fought alongside Mao in the revolution. Deng had been impris-\noned by the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution for opposing Mao\u2019s extremism. The\nCCP leadership now released him from jail and, remembering him as a moderate, sensible,\nand steadfast leader, supported him over Hua. In December 1978, Deng outmaneuvered\nHua to become the supreme leader of the PRC. In a clear break with the past, Deng did not\nimprison Hua, but allowed him to continue in the CCP with a reduced role. This was the\nfirst indication that Mao\u2019s brutality and extremism was a thing of the past.\nDeng\u2019s first move as leader was to halt the Cultural Revolution and reverse its dev-\nastating effects. He reopened the colleges and released political prisoners; he also launched\na campaign to stop the rampant crime which was surging in the aftermath of the Cultural\nRevolution. This stabilized the society and created the opportunity for change and growth.\nDeng also differed from Mao in his economic policies. He planned for steady, moderate\ngrowth, instead of the sudden surges which Mao pushed. He allowed for decentralization of\nboth agriculture and industry, allowing local leaders more autonomy; he sought a slow and\nsteady industrial growth by focusing first on light industry.\nAnother of his major economic changes was the establishment of Special\nEconomic Zones in coastal Southeastern China. These were cities, such as Shanghai and\nDalian, in which Marxist control of the means of production was largely suspended. These\n145 zones had a great deal of economic freedom, allowing them to use capitalist, market-based\npolicies which would both improve the economy and attract foreign investment. The policy\nwas a great success, leading to a massive increase in industrial output for the export market\n\u2013 China is now the world\u2019s largest export economy, contributing about ten percent of all\nglobal trade.\nDeng also instituted his famous \u201cFour Modernizations,\u201d a program to modernize\nChina\u2019s industrial base, science and technology, military, and agriculture. The CCP invested\ntremendous wealth and expertise in these areas, successfully modernizing all four sectors.\nAs a result of both the Four Modernizations and the new mixed economy (a combina-\ntion of socialism and capitalism), China has vastly increased its GPD, as well as per capita\nincome, expanded literacy, and improved life expectancy. In 1979, the CCP also launched\nthe controversial \u201cOne Child Policy,\u201d which punished women who had more than one\nchild with stiff financial penalties, or even forced sterilization. The intention was to improve\nthe economy by preventing overpopulation, so that the nation\u2019s wealth did not have to be\nsplit among too many citizens. The CCP claimed that, before the program was changed to\na two-child policy in 2015, it prevented 400 million births. However, the program had un-\nintended consequences. For example, the preference for boys (to carry on the family name)\nled to a high incidence of abortion or infanticide of baby girls. This has led to a large gender\nimbalance in China, with as many as 40% more men than women in some parts of China.\nBecause of this, China ceased all stipulations for births in 2021.\nDeng also initiated political reforms designed to prevent a concentration of power,\nsuch as decentralizing political power and strengthening the separation of powers in the\ngovernment. These changes did provoke some controversy within the CCP; furthermore,\nthe rapid economic changes stirred dissent, from hardline communists who believed the\nparty was straying too far from Marx and Mao, to liberals who wanted to see even more\nchange. Economic growth in China, alongside the still-centralized power of the CCP, led to\nan increase of corruption in the government, which Deng attempted to suppress.\nDeng\u2019s greatest challenge came in 1989, with the death of reform politician Hu\nYaobang. Hundreds of thousands of protestors, mainly university students, turned out for\nhis funeral in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. The gathering turned into a pro-democracy\nprotest which spread to several cities. Faced with a growing revolutionary threat, Deng de-\nployed the Liberation Army to disperse the protestors. Thousands were killed and many\nmore arrested and imprisoned; the nascent pro-democracy movement was effectively\nsilenced. Deng may have embraced aspects of capitalism, but democracy was to remain\noff-limits.\nDeng Xiaoping retired from his post shortly thereafter in a peaceful transfer of\npower to Jiang Zemin. Although Mao was the leader who had established the PRC, his\neconomic and political policies were unsustainable. It was Deng who modernized China\nand established it as a world power. After Tiananmen Square, though, his political decen-\ntralization reforms were halted, as the CCP re-tightened controls to retain power. But he\nsucceeded in protecting his economic policies, which continue in China to this day.\nJiang Zemin continued Deng\u2019s policy of a mixed economy, ending obsolescent state-\nrun companies and replacing them with more capitalist models. This foray into capitalism\nalso drove income inequality and corruption, both of which China struggles to address.\nJiang also oversaw the return of Hong Kong to China in 1997. After the Second Opium War,\nthe British had forced the Chinese monarchy to lease them the rights to the city, which sits\non an island just off mainland China. Hong Kong became a British colony; although this\noccupation of Chinese territory infuriated the CCP, the arrangement was completely legal,\nand the CCP could not move the British off the island without giving the UK cause for\nwar, or at least sanctions. In 1997, the lease expired, and the CCP refused to renegotiate it.\nThe UK returned the island to China in a formal ceremony, ending this humiliating legacy\n146 Chapter 6: China and India After World War II for the PRC. Although the PRC promised to allow the continuance of democracy in Hong\nKong, it has slowly dismantled democratic institutions on the island and suppressed the\nsubsequent protests with force.\nXi Jinping became the president of China in 2013. While continuing Deng\u2019s eco-\nnomic legacies, he has changed China\u2019s political and foreign policy landscape. Xi pushed\nthrough a constitutional amendment removing term limits for presidents, probably to pro-\ntect his own status; he has also been accused of building up a cult of personality, as Mao did,\nraising fears of similar results. His anti-corruption crackdowns have mainly targeted politi-\ncal rivals, and he has also attacked human rights activists and lawyers in China, imprisoning\nmany. Of particular consequence is his violent suppression of the ethnic Uighur people of\nWestern China in an attempt to remove the influence of Islam and cultural separatism still\nlingering there. This is probably the worst single human rights problem in the CCP.\nXi has also been much more aggressive in foreign relations than his predecessors. He has\nmade territorial claims in the South China Sea, claiming and even occupying and fortifying\nislands claimed by several nations; he has also been more aggressive in his dealings with\nTaiwan, and became embroiled in a trade war with the United States in 2018. Between ex-\npanding Chinese economic investments around the world and growing more assertive in\nhis foreign relations, Xi seems intent on expanding the PRC\u2019s influence, at least regionally,\nif not globally.\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China has made tremendous strides since its founding in\n1949, vastly expanding its economy and developing into a modern nation. However, the\nspeed of its growth, and its authoritarian model relative to democracies, has led to a number\nof seemingly intractable problems. In the relentless pursuit of economic growth, the CCP\nhas done great damage to the environment; the air in Beijing is among the most polluted\nin the world, causing long-term health problems for residents. The autocratic nature of the\ngovernment \u2013 one that does not have to answer to anyone outside it -- leads to corruption\namong bureaucrats, law enforcement, the judiciary, and corporate leadership. This cor-\nruption, coupled with human rights abuses such as suppression of free speech and a lack\nof workers\u2019 rights, leads to protests which are usually brutally suppressed, particularly in\npro-democracy Hong Kong and Buddhist Tibet. The population, now with a gender imbal-\nance, still grows rapidly, challenging the CCP to grow the economy fast enough to provide a\ngood per capita income to the growing population. These represent major problems for the\nCCP, and the party\u2019s continued survival probably depends on its ability to overcome them.\nWhether or not the party is up to the challenge will determine the future of the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China.\nIndia under the Raj\nLike China, India was one of antiquity\u2019s most successful cultures, producing art and\narchitecture which outshone the West for thousands of years. During the Mughal Empire\u2019s\ntenure of the Indian subcontinent, India controlled one-quarter of the world\u2019s economy\nand produced a quarter of global manufacturing, surpassing even mighty China. It was the\ntrade of India and China, after all, that the Europeans sought during the Age of Exploration.\nIn the 19th century, most of the Indian subcontinent was ruled by the Mughal,\nMaratha, and Sikh empires; however, the internal weaknesses and fighting among the var-\nious regions allowed for their domination by the British East India Company, a private\nentity which established factories and trading posts in India to export the goods to Europe.\nThe company had the legal authority to wage war and capture territory, and raised a private\narmy to carry out its campaigns in India. Through conquest and negotiation, the compa-\nny gained either direct or indirect rule (through local proxy leaders) of nearly the entire\n147 subcontinent, thanks largely to the political disunity of the region, which allowed the com-\npany to carry out a divide-and-conquer strategy. The company then ruled India as a private,\nprofit-making enterprise.\nEast India Company rule came to an end after a revolt by Indian soldiers in the\ncompany\u2019s employ in 1857. Although the company suppressed the revolt and retained con-\ntrol of India, the British government realized that the company\u2019s exploitive policies would\nonly lead to more rebellions, and so seized control of India in 1858, dissolving the company.\nIndia (eventually including what is now Pakistan, Burma, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh) was\nnow ruled by Great Britain in the form of a colonial government called the British Raj.\nOther European nations (France, the Netherlands, and Portugal) held a few trading posts in\nthe region as well.\nThe Raj quickly developed Indian industry and infrastructure, modernizing the\nphysical form of the nation while trying to leave its cultural norms untouched; this was\ndone to prevent another rebellion. However, by the mid-1880s, discontent flared. Indians\ncomplained of unfair taxes, unfair trade policies (such as British monopolies on the manu-\nfacture of certain goods), and the use of Indian troops in foreign wars which did not benefit\nthe Indian people. All of these complaints were common among colonized peoples. The\nIndian National Congress, an indigenous organization of educated Indian elites, was cre-\nated in 1885 to address the problems of the Raj. Anti-British movements followed, most\ncommonly efforts to boycott British goods, but revolutionary violence was not unknown.\nSeveral famines, exacerbated by British incompetence, only fueled the anger.\nWorld War I was a watershed moment in the Indian home rule (i.e., independence)\nmovement. A million Indian troops fought with distinction alongside the British in the\nMiddle East and even in Europe. This gave Indians a strong sense of pride, as they had\nmeaningfully contributed to the outcome of the Great War and helped save the British\nEmpire. How could they continue to view themselves as inferior to the British, fit only to be\nruled?\nThe independence movements in India intensified between the world wars. One\nreason for this was the return to India of a man who would personify the swaraj, or \u201chome\nrule,\u201d movement: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Gandhi was the son of a local state\nminister and attended law school in London. In 1893, he traveled to South Africa, home to\nthousands of Indians living in British colonial areas. He went to represent an Indian mer-\nchant in court; but what he encountered there led him to stay for twenty-one years. Gandhi\ninitially believed the British propaganda that all British subjects were equal under the law.\nOnce in South Africa, he experienced the racism of the empire \u2013 being kicked off trains\nbecause he tried to sit in first-class as a person of color, and pushed off sidewalks by White\npolice officers. This is how Gandhi learned the hypocrisy of the imperial project, and then\ndedicated his life to fighting it.\nWhile in South Africa, Gandhi developed his unique tactic for fighting repression,\nknown as satyagraha (\u201ctruth force\u201d). This strategy of nonviolent resistance depended on\nshaming the authorities into changing their behavior by exposing their brutality to the\nworld. Indian protesters would provoke the police, for example, by walking in areas reserved\nfor Whites. When the police would attack them, the protestors would not respond with vio-\nlence, but would accept the blows \u2013 while newspapermen recorded what happened and told\nthe world. It was hoped that the moral disgust felt back in Europe would force the British\nto change their behavior. It was a success; Gandhi\u2019s movement forced the government to\nchange anti-Indian policies in Africa.\nGandhi returned to India in 1915 to help organize opposition to the increased\ntaxes which the British had imposed on the Indian people, and spending time in jail as\na result. While Gandhi organized nonviolent resistance, violent rebellion against the Raj\nwas growing, manifesting as terrorist attacks. These led to a harsh government response in\n1919: the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, in which British General Reginald Dyer ordered his\n148 Chapter 6: China and India After World War II A map of the British Empire in India, 1909.\ntroops to fire on Indian civilians, killing or wounding thousands. Gandhi had joined the\nIndian National Congress, and in 1924 assumed leadership of the organization. It is import-\nant to note that there were many other organizations and leaders struggling for indepen-\ndence, with different goals and methods. Some groups, such as the Hindustan Republican\nAssociation, embraced violence in the pursuit of independence; others, like the All-India\nMuslim League, espoused independence, but also wanted India partitioned into two coun-\ntries, one Muslim and one Hindu.\nIn 1930, Gandhi led what was probably the greatest individual satyagraha cam-\npaign: the Salt March. Indians always resented the British monopoly on the production\nand distribution of salt in their country. Gandhi led a protest march of over 240 miles,\nspreading word of the protest as he went; at its conclusion, thousands of protesters gathered\nsalt at the Indian Ocean in violation of the law. This was the start of a year-long campaign\nof civil disobedience and non-cooperation. The police retaliated with arrests and beatings\nof protesters, who did not respond with violence. These actions were reported around the\nworld, and world opinion towards the British Raj was negative. As a result, the Raj invited\n149 Gandhi to negotiate new reforms in London during the Round Table Conferences. These\nconferences resulted in a greater degree of home rule in India, but not independence.\nThe independence movement continued into World War II. The British Raj, with-\nout consulting the Indian people, declared war against the Axis powers. In 1942, the INC\nannounced the Quit India movement, demanding that the British leave India immediately.\nThe British government was in no way ready to do so. Not only did the UK need manpower,\nresources, and money of India during the war, but the Japanese were pressing into Burma\nfrom the east, and the UK did not want to abandon India to them. To counteract Gandhi\nand his followers, the Raj arrested him and most of the Indian National Congress leader-\nship, who spent the rest of the war in jail. India sent about two and a half million men to\nfight in the war on the Allied side.\nIndian Independence\nAfter the war, the British realized that the days of empire were over. The US and\nUnited Nations both opposed imperialism, and the UK lacked the money and will to con-\ntinue occupying its colonies. And the UK needed US money to survive in the immediate\npostwar years, so defying the US was not in Great Britain\u2019s interests.\nLeaving India was not a simple matter. The main division in Indian culture to this\nday is religion. India is about 80% Hindu and 14% Muslim, with the remainder mainly\nBuddhists, Sikhs, Jains, and Christians. Although Indians tend to believe in religious tol-\nerance, a hallmark of Indian culture is the overwhelming division along religious lines \u2013\nIndians prefer to live in communities of their own religion and associate with, and marry,\nonly members of their own faith. Religion, specifically Hinduism, also forms the basis of the\ncaste system.\nThese divisions complicated things for the Raj. The Muslim League demanded that\nthe Raj be partitioned into two states, one Hindu and the other Islamic, divided along lines\nbetween states by majority religion. Although Gandhi vehemently opposed dividing India,\nthe British realized that forcing Indian Muslims into a union they didn\u2019t want would lead to\nviolence which would prevent, or at least delay, a British withdrawal. Therefore, the British\nagreed to partition India into two states: India (Hindu) and Pakistan (Muslim). The eastern\nstate of Bengal, geographically far removed from Pakistan, was also part of the Muslim state\nand became known as East Pakistan. The British hastily drew a dividing line which, due to\nlack of knowledge and care, ran through religious communities, leaving many people on\nthe wrong side of the line (an ironic repeat of the lines drawn at the Berlin Conference in\nthe 1880s, which doomed Africa to tribal divisions). This led to a tremendous demographic\nupheaval, where ten million people were forced from their lands by members of the ma-\njority religion in the area. Inspired by religious bigots and extremists, violence broke out\nagainst religious minorities on both sides of the lines, and as many as two million people\nwere murdered in savage attacks. Despite the disruption, India and Pakistan both attained\nindependence in August 1947. The Indian constitution created a secular, democratic repub-\nlic; Pakistan became an Islamic Republic. The INC became the Congress Party, standing\ncandidates for office in the new democracy.\nGandhi accepted no position in the new Indian government, and, in any case,\nwas busy trying to halt the sectarian violence. The Congress Party won the elections, and\nJawaharlal Nehru, a longtime ally and friend of Gandhi, became the nation\u2019s first prime\nminister. Gandhi was assassinated in January 1948 by a Hindu nationalist who viewed\nGandhi as a traitor for trying to make peace with Muslims. He thereby joined a long list of\npeacemakers, such as Anwar Sadat and Yitzhak Rabin, who died for their commitment to\npeace. His legacy goes far beyond India; his method of satyagraha has been used in social\n150 Chapter 6: China and India After World War II movements by such leaders as Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela.\nOne of the first problems for the new Indian government was national consoli-\ndation. The government had to integrate the 565 princely states (areas of India which the\nBritish had not directly controlled, but only ruled indirectly) into a unified India, as well as\naddress the remaining Portuguese and French enclaves on the subcontinent. Responsibility\nfor the princely states fell to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the new Deputy Prime Minister\nand Minister for Home and States Affairs. Patel, an old political ally of Gandhi in the INC,\nbrought 552 of the princely states into the Indian fold, incorporated into existing provinc-\nes, with the rest going to Pakistan. Although there was violence in several princely states\nduring the annexations, the worst spot was certainly Jammu and Kashmir. Local Muslims\nand Pakistani forces clashed with the Indian Army over possession of the state, leading to\nthe First Indo-Pakistani War, which lasted until the end of 1948. In the end, the state was\nroughly divided between the two countries, but the conflict was far from settled.\nPrime Minister Nehru and the Congress Party led the new democracy until 1964.\nNehru was a social democrat \u2013 that it, he believed in socialist economics, with the govern-\nment controlling most economic activity, coupled with multi-party elections, as is done in\ndemocracies. The advantage of this system over the Marxist-Leninist system of one-party\npolitics is that the social democrats can be voted out of office, a feature which prevents\nauthoritarianism and corruption. Nehru believed that socialist policies would better serve\nIndia, which suffered from great poverty and economic stratification. His party national-\nized heavy industry to quickly develop the economy, and also vastly expanded education\nand infrastructure development.\nThe integration of the princely states into existing provinces created tensions, however, as\nthey now incorporated different ethnic groups, with different policy preferences, into the\nsame states. In 1956, the government enacted the States Reorganization Act, which redrew\nstates\u2019 boundaries along linguistic lines (language being a major marker of ethnic identity).\nInternationally, India pursued a neutral path, proclaiming nonalignment in the\nCold War. The nation\u2019s first 20 years were not very peaceful as boundary disputes raged on.\nIn 1960, India finally annexed the last Western possession in India,\nthe Portuguese colony of Goa, in a military operation after negoti-\nations failed. The next year, China attacked after violent skirmishes\nalong the Tibetan border; Chinese forces pushed the Indians back\nin the Sino-Indian War before unilaterally declaring a ceasefire.\nWhile the US refused to provide India with advanced weapons, the\nUSSR was willing to do so, mainly as a way of containing Chinese\naggression in Western Asia. This pushed India into closer relations\nwith the USSR. And in 1965, India and Pakistan fought the Second\nIndo-Pakistani War, again over Kashmir, and again with no deci-\nsive outcome despite considerable casualties.\nAs is so often the case after independence, the party which led\nthe resistance enjoyed an initial popularity; in the case of India,\nthis was the Congress Party. But when party leadership passed to\nIndira Gandhi (Nehru\u2019s daughter) in 1966, the party split into two\nfactions. A group of Congress Party officials sought a more right-\nwing economic model in line with the capitalist democracies. These\nmembers formed a new party, called Congress (O), while Gandhi\nmaintained leadership of the original party, now called Congress\n(R).\nGandhi\u2019s Congress (R) party continued Nehru\u2019s socialist policies,\nfor example by nationalizing the banking system. The party also\nJawaharlal Nehru, first Prime Minister of India.\n151 launched very successful initiatives to improve agriculture and dairy production in the\ncountry, protecting it from the famines of the past. Gandhi directed the Indian military to\nintervene in the Bangladesh War of Independence, when East Pakistan sought indepen-\ndence from the rest of the Muslim-majority country. India defeated Pakistani forces during\nthe intervention (also sometimes called the Third Indo-Pakistani War), and the revolution\nsucceeded, resulting in the formation of the independent country of Bangladesh. Gandhi\nalso oversaw the annexation of the Kingdom of Sikkim into India in 1973.\nBut Gandhi had many political opponents. In 1974, a social movement against gov-\nernment corruption and overreach spread across the country, culminating in a high court\nfinding Indira Gandhi guilty of violating election laws. This led to a nationwide strike and\nprotests led by opposition parties. Gandhi\u2019s government responded strongly, suspending\ncivil rights and elections and arresting opposition leaders. This twenty-one-month suspen-\nsion of democracy was known as the Indian Emergency. The opposition, however, formed\na unity party known as the Janata Party which challenged the Congress (R) in the next\nelection after the emergency. They defeated the incumbents, then launched an investigation\ninto government corruption, even arresting and imprisoning Gandhi for a time.\nEconomic Change in India\nThe Janata Party conducted a study in 1979 (the Mandal Commission) to address\nthe caste system in India. The stratification of society along religious lines was an ancient\npractice in India, and circumscribed many aspects of one\u2019s life, such as occupation and mar-\nriage. The British Raj had used the caste system as a way of administering the colony, for\nexample by determining taxes (despite their emphasis on freedom, British society was quite\nstratified, and they may have felt rather at home with caste). The Mandal Commission even-\ntually led to a system of reservation, or affirmative action, in which a certain number of\nslots for students in higher education, or for government positions, be reserved for people\nof lower castes, to improve social mobility. Naturally, this was very controversial, as those of\nhigher castes considered it a form of reverse-discrimination.\nAs the Indian economy grew more capitalist and deregulated in the 1990s, the role\nof caste weakened; less government control of the economy led to more social mobility.\nToday, there is much less caste-based discrimination and abuse in India than there once\nwas. Nevertheless, most Indians associate mainly with people of their own caste and do not\nmarry outside it.\nThe Janata Party could not maintain their parliamentary coalition and were per-\nceived as ineffective in addressing the nation\u2019s problems; they were defeated by Gandhi in\nthe next national election in 1980, who now led a splinter political party known as Congress\n(I).\nIndira Gandhi would not remain prime minister for long. Sikh militants in the\nnorthern state of Punjab clashed with police in their campaign to create a separate Sikh\nhomeland in India. In 1984, Gandhi was assassinated by Sikh members of her own body-\nguard unit. The resulting anti-Sikh riots claimed 3000 lives.\nRajiv Gandhi, Indira\u2019s oldest son, had been elected to parliament two years before.\nNow, Congress party officials chose him for prime minister in the wake of his mother\u2019s\ndeath. Gandhi abandoned many of his mother\u2019s policies; for example, he shifted away from\nsocialist economics by deregulating business. He also forged closer links with the United\nStates, which led to some American financial and technical support. He pushed to mod-\nernize the tech industries in India, the greatest example of which was the founding of the\nIndian space program.\nHe also faced several scandals and difficulties. A Union Carbide pesticide plant\n152 Chapter 6: China and India After World War II in Bhopal leaked poisonous chemicals into the community, killing thousands; several\ngovernment officials were caught accepting bribes from a foreign military contractor; and\nthousands of Indian troops were killed in Sri Lanka while participating in peacekeeping op-\nerations. Unemployment remained very high. Gandhi himself suffered the same fate as his\nmother: he was also assassinated, this time by a Sri Lankan rebel group that Indian troops\nhad been fighting.\nSectarian violence continued in India in the 1990s. Hindu and Muslim extremists\ncontinued to fight for control of Jammu and Kashmir, while the destruction of the Babri\nMasjid mosque by Hindu extremists led to thousands of deaths in riots. In 1999, India\nlaunched a military campaign in Kashmir to dislodge a terrorist network supported by\nPakistani troops (the Kargil Conflict), even though the two nations had started a peace\nprocess only three months before.\nEconomic development in India, however, remained strong. The government con-\ntinued to privatize national industries and deregulate business. These policies would, by the\nearly 2000s, lead to an expanding GNP and per capita income, although the wealth gap was\nquickly widening. Economic growth, coupled with the fact that India grew to one billion\ncitizens at the turn of the century, has convinced many observers that India is on the path to\nbecome a superpower.\nThe 1990s also saw the rise of a new right-wing power in India: the Bharatiya\nJanata Party (BJP). The BJP espouses Hindu Nationalism (the concept that only Hindus\ncan truly be Indian). Major BJP parliamentary victories in 1996 and 2014 led to an increase\nin sectarian legislation, such as beef bans (Hindus are vegetarian) and to religious violence\nin the form of anti-Muslim mob lynchings. And violence is not contained to India alone;\nthe strained relationship with Muslim Pakistan flares up from time to time as well, a par-\nticularly dangerous prospect given that both countries now possess nuclear weapons. The\n2001 Attack on the Indian Parliament was a case in point; five Muslim terrorists (backed\nby Pakistan, according to the Indian government) attempted to storm the parliament but\nwere killed by security forces. This led to India shelling Pakistani forces along the Kashmiri\nborder. The BJP also shepherded the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act, which\nprevents Muslims from certain countries from becoming naturalized Indian citizens \u2013 the\nfirst time religion has played a role in citizenship in postcolonial India. The BJP\u2019s Indian\nagriculture acts deregulated the agricultural sector. This spawned the Indian Farmer\u2019s\nProtest, as already-strained farmers feared that the new policies would lead to decreased\nprofits.\nModern India is a study in contradiction, where wealth and poverty, tradition and\nmodernity, reside side-by-side, particularly along urban / rural lines. It is an extremely\ncomplex and ancient culture, encompassing a dizzying array of religions, languages, and\nethnicities. It is remarkable that, in such a short time since independence, India has not\nonly avoided fragmentation, but has made great economic and political strides. Its inter-\nnational situation has stabilized following the Indo-Pakistani wars, though tensions with\nboth Pakistan and China still smolder. But India remains a bold experiment: it is the largest\ndemocracy in the world by population, despite the diversity of its people, as well as the most\nsuccessful of all decolonized nations. India serves as a sort of bellwether for developing na-\ntions, where democracy can prove itself in the most challenging of environments.\n153 Conclusions\nThe economic rise of both China and India is a major change in world affairs at the start of the\n21st century. What is most interesting is not the similarities between them, but their differences -- both\nhave developed into major international players using very different methods. While both nations have\nstruggled with balancing capitalism and socialism in their mixed economies, China maintains an au-\nthoritarian, one-party government. India remains committed to democracy and pluralism, though the\ncommitment is often tested by religious conflict. China is the wealthier state by far, but also introduced\ncapitalist reforms twenty years before India, giving it a head start in that direction.\nPerhaps more important is India\u2019s international position. India is a large, developing democracy\nin a region where commitment to democracy is largely either shaky or nonexistent. India, as an anchor of\ndemocracy, may prove an important stabilizing force in Asia through the turmoil of the 21st century. The\nentire developing world is watching how these two Asian giants develop, and are sure to be influenced by\nwhat they see.\nSuggested Further Reading\nIndia After Gandhi: The History of the World\u2019s Largest Democracy by Ramachandra Guha (Pan Macmillan\nIndia, 2017.

The bourgeoisie\ndoes not welcome this truth because it does not want to be overthrown.\nAs everyone knows, our Party passed through these twenty-eight years not in peace but amid hardships, for\nwe had to fight enemies, both foreign and domestic, both inside and outside the Party. We thank Marx, Engels,\nLenin and Stalin for giving us a weapon. This weapon is not a machine gun, but Marxism-Leninism...\nThe Russians made the October Revolution and created the world\u2019s first socialist state. Under the leadership\nof Lenin and Stalin, the revolutionary energy of the great proletariat [working class] and labouring people of\nRussia suddenly erupted like a volcano, and the Chinese and all mankind began to see the Russians in a new\nlight. Then, and only then, did the Chinese enter an entirely new era in their thinking and their life...\nThere are bourgeois republics in foreign lands, but China cannot have a bourgeois republic because she is a\ncountry suffering under imperialist oppression. The only way is through a people\u2019s republic led by the working\nclass....\n[T]he Chinese revolution, led by the Communist Party of China, has made tremendous advances both in\n158 Chapter 6: China and India After World War II theory and practice and has radically changed the face of China...\nIn the light of the experiences accumulated in these forty years and these twenty-eight years, all Chinese\nwithout exception must lean either to the side of imperialism [and capitalism] or to the side of socialism\n[and communism]. Sitting on the fence will not do, nor is there a third road. We oppose Chiang Kaishek [the\ncapitalist leader] who leans to the side of imperialism, and we also oppose the illusions about a third road...\n[To those who say:] \u201cWe need help from the British and U.S. governments.\u201d This, too, is a naive idea in these\ntimes. Would the present rulers of Britain and the United States, who are imperialists, help a people\u2019s state?\nWhy do these countries do business with us and, supposing they might be willing to lend us money on terms\nof mutual benefit in the future, why would they do so? Because their capitalists want to make money and their\nbankers want to earn interest to extricate themselves from their own crisis -- it is not a matter of helping the\nChinese people.\n[To those who say:] \u201cYou are dictators.\u201d My dear sirs, you are right, that is just what we are. All the experience\nthe Chinese people have accumulated through several decades teaches us to enforce the people\u2019s democratic\ndictatorship, that is, to deprive the reactionaries of the right [i.e., anticommunists] to speak and let the people\nalone have that right.\n\u201cWho are the people?\u201d At the present stage in China, they are the working class, the peasantry, the urban petty\nbourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie. These classes, led by the working class and the Communist Party\nunite to form their own state and elect their own government they enforce their dictatorship over the running\ndogs of imperialism-the landlord class and bureaucrat bourgeoisie.... Democracy is practiced within the ranks\nof the people, who enjoy the rights of freedom of speech, assembly, association and so on. The right to vote\nbelongs only to the people, not to the reactionaries. The combination of these two aspects, democracy for the\npeople and dictatorship over the reactionaries, is the people\u2019s democratic dictatorship.\n\u201cWhy must things be done this way?\u201d The reason is quite clear to everybody. If things were not done this way,\nthe revolution would fail, the people would suffer, the country would be conquered.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want to abolish state power?\u201d Yes, we do, but not right now; we cannot do it yet. Why? Because\nimperialism still exists, because domestic reaction still exists, because classes still exist in our country. Our\npresent task is to strengthen the people\u2019s state apparatus-mainly the people\u2019s army, the people\u2019s police and the\npeople\u2019s courts-in order to consolidate national defense and protect the people\u2019s interests. Given this condition,\nChina can develop steadily, under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, from an\nagricultural into an industrial country and from a new-democratic into a socialist and communist society, can\nabolish classes and realize the Great Harmony....\nAs for the members of the reactionary classes and individual reactionaries [those who oppose communism], so\nlong as they do not rebel, sabotage or create trouble after their political power has been overthrown, land and\nwork will be given to them as well in order to allow them to live and remold themselves through labor into new\npeople. If they are not willing to work, the people\u2019s state will compel them to work....\nTo sum up our experience and concentrate it into one point, it is: the people\u2019s democratic dictatorship under\nthe leadership of the working class (through the Communist Party) and based upon the alliance of workers and\npeasants. This dictatorship must unite as one with the international revolutionary forces. This is our formula,\nour principal experience, our main program...\nThe Communist Party of the Soviet Union is our best teacher and we must learn from it. The situation both at\n159 home and abroad is in our favor we can rely fully on the weapon of the people\u2019s democratic dictatorship, unite\nthe people throughout the country, the reactionaries excepted, and advance steadily to our goal.\nMao Zedong. \u201c The People\u2019s Democratic Dictatorship.\u201d Internet History Sourcebooks Project.

They are the fundamental premise for realizing the four\nmodernizations. They are [as follows]:\n1. We must uphold the socialist road.\n2. We must uphold the dictatorship of the proletariat.\n3. We must uphold the leadership of the Communist Party.\n4. We must uphold Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.\nThe Center believes that we must reemphasize upholding the four basic principles today because some\npeople (albeit an extreme minority) have attempted to shake those basic principles. ... Recently, a tendency\nhas developed for some people to create trouble in some parts of the country. ... Some others also deliberately\nexaggerate and create a sensation by raising such slogans as \u201cOppose starvation\u201d and \u201cDemand human rights.\u201d\nUnder these slogans, they incite some people to demonstrate and scheme to get foreigners to propagandize\ntheir words and actions to the outside world. The so-called China Human Rights Organization has even tacked\nup big character posters requesting the American president \u201cto show solicitude\u201d toward human rights in China.\nCan we permit these kinds of public demands for foreigners to interfere in China\u2019s domestic affairs?

In the 19th century, France conquered several kingdoms in what is now\nCambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, and named this new possession French Indochina. They\nseized the resources of the region, particularly rice and rubber, and monopolized trade in\nthe colony, particularly the wine and salt markets. These resources and markets provided\nabout half the income that France took from its global empire. But French imperialism, and\nits brutal response to dissent, led to various and sporadic uprisings against its rule.\nThe French situation changed drastically during World War II. Nazi Germany over-\nran France and set up a right-wing, pro-Nazi regime called Vichy France. Vichy allowed\nJapanese troops to enter Indochina, as Japan hoped the region would provide a new front in\ntheir war against China. Just months before surrendering to the United States, Japan took\npossession of Indochina to prevent an allied landing there. They were opposed by the Viet\nMinh, a socialist, nationalist coalition fighting for Vietnamese independence. This group\nwas led by Ho Chi Minh, founder of the Indochinese Communist Party. Since the Viet\nMinh fought the Japanese, they received aid from the US, the USSR, and China.\nAfter Japan surrendered in August 1945, Japanese troops returned home.\nNationalist China occupied the northern part of Vietnam, known as Tonkin. While France\nwanted Indochina returned to her empire, the Viet Minh (and President Roosevelt of the\nUSA, for that matter) opposed this. Ho Chi Minh declared Vietnam an independent nation\n(the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, or DRV) on September 2, 1945, the same day the\nJapanese surrendered. However, British and French troops arrived in Saigon in southern\nVietnam (known as Cochin China) the next month, and quickly asserted control of both the\nNorth and South. The French had more than just money on their minds; since their country\nhad been conquered by Nazi Germany in WWII, French conservative leaders wanted to\nreclaim their empire to restore their damaged national pride. After FDR died in April 1945,\nthe US was not inclined to argue the point. After a brief period of unfruitful negotiations\nbetween Ho Chi Minh and France regarding power-sharing, all-out war between the Viet\nMinh and the French began in December 1946. This was known as the First Indochina\nWar.\nInitially, France held the advantage. However, after the Chinese Civil War ended\nwith a communist victory in 1949, the Viet Minh began receiving support from both the\nPRC, in the form of instruction in guerilla warfare, and the USSR, in the form of weapons.\nThe US supported France with weapons and advisors, viewing a potential Viet Minh victory\nas another victory for communism in Asia.\nThe war swung back and forth, with one side and then the other gaining the advan-\ntage on the battlefield, but French public opinion was turning against the war. The decisive\nmoment was Dien Bien Phu, one of the most important battles of the 20th century. The\nViet Minh attacked a heavily-fortified French position in a valley between forested moun-\ntains, where the French did not believe the Viet Minh could bring their heavy weapons due\nto the terrain. They were wrong; the Viet Minh cut roads through the jungle with hand tools\nand carried their cannons up into the mountains surrounding the valley. After a bloody\n57-day siege, the French surrendered on May 7, 1954. This battle inspired anti-imperialists\neverywhere by proving that the Westerners could be beaten.\nThe subsequent Geneva Accords established the results for Vietnam. The French\nwould leave Indochina, ending their Asian empire. Vietnam would be divided temporarily\ninto two states: North Vietnam, where Ho Chi Minh was in control, and South Vietnam,\nwhere Ngo Dinh Diem was prime minister of the new state. The plan was for a referendum\n162 Chapter 7: Southeast Asia to be held in both North and South in July 1956, and the people of both nations togeth-\ner would choose which government would reunify the country under its rule. While the\nFrench and Viet Minh agreed to this, the new South Vietnamese government did not. Ngo\nthen declared that South Vietnam was an independent country, the Republic of Vietnam\n(ROV). US leaders knew that, if the referendum was held, Ho Chi Minh would win by a\nwide margin. To prevent the unification of Vietnam under communism, they decided to\nback Ngo. They realized that Ngo was corrupt, authoritarian, and unpopular, but they had\nno alternative leader to support.\nDetermined to reunite the country, North Vietnam prepared for the conflict which\nwould later be known as the Second Indochina War. Ho Chi Minh\u2019s first strategy in 1955,\nwas to establish a guerilla group inside South Vietnam while he prepared his conventional\nforces for a long and bitter struggle. He ordered the construction of the Ho Chi Minh Trail,\na series of roads and trails which passed through neutral Laos and Cambodia, allowing\nNorth Vietnamese personnel, weapons, and ammunition to pass unhindered into South\nVietnam. By 1962, there were about 300,000 Viet Cong (Vietnamese Communist) guerillas\nin the South, carrying out a terror campaign designed to weaken Ngo\u2019s regime.\nNaturally, this greatly disturbed the United States; President Kennedy decided that\nUS credibility was at stake, and decided to \u201cdraw a line in the sand\u201d in Vietnam. Kennedy\nwanted to support South Vietnam with equipment, money, and advisors. The problem with\nthis strategy was that both the South Vietnamese government, from Ngo down, and the\nmilitary (ARVN \u2013 the Army of the Republic of Vietnam), were corrupt and inept. Before\nlong, it became clear that Ngo could not save Vietnam, no matter how much the US sup-\nported him.\nOn November 2, 1963, a group of South Vietnamese generals assassinated Ngo\n(and his younger brother, who ran the hated secret police), after the US government in-\nformed them that the US would not oppose such a coup \u2013 after all, the US wanted a leader\nin place who would win the war against the Viet Cong. Kennedy himself was assassinated\nonly 20 days later. South Vietnam then fell into a period of extreme political instability. One\nmilitary coup followed another in quick succession as corrupt generals sought power for\nthemselves. Ho Chi Minh, watching the chaos, pushed his guerillas to fight harder.\nMap of Indochina\n(Library of Congress)\n163 The situation in Vietnam took yet another turn in August 1964. The USS Maddox,\na US destroyer, engaged North Vietnamese vessels in combat in the Gulf of Tonkin; two\ndays later, the USS Turner Joy reported being attacked, though it was later discovered that\nthis second attack never actually happened. The second attack was the trigger for the Gulf\nof Tonkin Resolution, in which the US Congress authorized President Johnson to take\nwhatever actions he needed to protect US forces. Johnson viewed this as carte blanche to do\nwhatever he saw fit in Vietnam. This began a long aerial campaign against the Viet Cong in\nSouth Vietnam, the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos, and North Vietnam itself.\nIn 1965, Johnson made the fateful decision to send US troops to fight the Viet Cong\nin South Vietnam, with nearly 200,000 Americans in-country by the end of the year. This\nrepresented a major shift in US policy, as US troops would now take up the fight themselves\nin the face of South Vietnamese ineffectiveness. Johnson\u2019s generals told him that they could\nwin the war by the end of 1967.\nThis was far from true. With the entrance of US troops, the People\u2019s Army of North\nVietnam (PAVN), the North\u2019s conventional force, joined the fight. Now the US was fighting\neverywhere in the country at once. US troop strength reached 500,000 in 1968. Both sides\nof the conflict committed war crimes, murdering civilians and burning villages. The war\nrequired a draft in the US to secure the necessary troops; this proved very unpopular in the\nUS, where protests were almost nonstop and a declining percentage of Americans approved\nof the war.\nThe essential problem for the US was that, so long as the North Vietnamese contin-\nued to fight, the US had no way to win the war. One South Vietnamese regime after another\ncame and went, each as corrupt and inept as the last. And the US could not invade North\nVietnam without triggering a massive Chinese intervention, as had happened in the Korean\nWar. This left the US with only one strategy: continue fighting until the communists gave\nup.\nThe final turning point in the war was the Tet Offensive of 1968. The Viet Cong\nlaunched a massive surprise attack on Tet, the Vietnamese New Year. Catching the US off-\nguard, the Viet Cong attempted to capture 100 cities inside South Vietnam simultaneously.\nWhile the US finally beat off the offensive, Tet convinced many in the US that the war was\nfar from over, contrary to what Johnson and the generals were saying. Johnson\u2019s approval\nrate plummeted. As a result, he declined to run for another term as president in the 1968\nelections.\nRichard Nixon, on winning the 1968 elections, promised to get the US out of\nVietnam \u201cwith honor.\u201d Nixon\u2019s problem was that the US could not appear to abandon\nVietnam, as it was thought that this would look like the US was abandoning the fight against\ncommunism; yet, US public opinion would no longer allow Nixon to remain in Vietnam.\nNixon, therefore, proposed a strategy called Vietnamization. The plan was to equip and\ntrain South Vietnam\u2019s troops so that they could resist the communists on their own, without\nUS troops. Few decision makers thought the plan would work \u2013 after all, the US had been\naiding South Vietnam since 1955, and still had to rescue its military from the North\u2019s inva-\nsion. But no other policy was politically viable.\nNorth Vietnam also changed strategies after Ho Chi Minh\u2019s death in 1969. The Tet\noffensive had cost the Viet Cong guerillas dearly; now the North focused on modernizing\nits conventional army. At first, it seemed that Vietnamization was working, as the Viet Cong\nwere launching far fewer attacks. The illusion was shattered in Easter 1972, when the PAVN\nlaunched a fierce attack from the North; the only thing that saved the South was a massive\nbombing campaign by the US Air Force. It was clear that only US support could save South\nVietnam \u2013 and that support was about to end.\nIn January 1973, President Nixon coerced South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van\nThieu into accepting a ceasefire with the North. The intention was for the US to withdraw\n164 Chapter 7: Southeast Asia from Vietnam while there was peace, so that it would not appear that the US was running\nfrom a fight. The Paris Peace Accords decreed that both nations would respect the territo-\nrial integrity of the other, and that elections for reunification of the country, as per the 1954\nplan, would be carried out. The US had armed the South, but the effort was haphazard, with\nthe ARVN unprepared for a serious conflict. All remaining US forces were withdrawn in\nMarch 1973.\nAfter some small offensives from the North in violation of the ceasefire, PAVN\nlaunched a major attack in December 1974. Although the South expected an invasion, its\narmy was helpless to stop it; morale was low, and its soldiers surrendered or fled. The South\ndevolved into a hellish morass of fleeing troops and civilians, refugees trying to escape the\ncountry by boat or plane, and advancing communist troops. President Thieu fled to Taiwan,\naccusing the US of betrayal. In Washington, President Ford assured his country on nation-\nal TV that US troops would not return to Vietnam. On April 30, 1975, PAVN conquered\nSaigon, ending all resistance. Ho Chi Minh\u2019s dream of reunification was achieved, and the\nnext year, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRVN) was established. The victory had cost\nNorth Vietnam over one million dead.\nThe first decade of unity was not a happy one. The Marxist government established\na Stalinist / Maoist economic model, with state-run farming collectives and complete con-\ntrol of industry, education, and the media. Embargoed by the US, the country\u2019s economy\ncollapsed until it was one of the poorest in the world, with a per capita GNP of under $300\nUS. Fortunately, Vietnam was closely aligned with the USSR, which provided massive fi-\nnancial aid to keep the country afloat; unfortunately, China was displeased with Vietnam\u2019s\nfriendship with its communist rival, and China ended most of its economic support.\nDeteriorating human rights and poverty led to hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing\nthe country.\nRelations with China soured even further in January 1979. The Khmer Rouge of\nCambodia (see section on Cambodia below) raided western Vietnam, and Vietnam re-\nsponded with an invasion of Cambodia. China, a supporter of the Khmer Rouge, retaliated\nwith an invasion of Vietnam in February in order to, according to Deng Xiaoping, \u201cteach\nVietnam a lesson.\u201d The PRC ravaged the borderlands but could proceed no further against\nthe Vietnamese. They withdrew after a month. The invasion did not dissuade the Vietnamese\nfrom ousting the Khmer Rouge and taking control of Cambodia. The Vietnamese finally\nwithdrew from Cambodia in 1989, leaving the country to UN administration.\nReal change did not begin in Vietnam until the mid-1980s. Vietnam recognized\nthat it suffered from the same political problem as the USSR: its leadership was old and very\nconservative, unable to create new solutions to lingering economic and social problems,\nsuch as the soaring rates of poverty, crime, and corruption. In the mid-1980s, therefore,\nmost of the primary leaders of the communist party and state were either removed from\noffice or retired, allowing younger, more energetic leaders to step up.\nThe new leaders instituted the same economic changes that Deng had in China,\nslowly shifting from a state-run system to relatively free markets, grafting elements of capi-\ntalism onto socialism to create a mixed economy. The fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 drove\nChina and Vietnam closer, as two of the last socialist states in the world needed each other\u2019s\nsupport.\nVietnam, largely isolated from the capitalist world, now worked to establish rela-\ntions and trade with the global community. The US lifted its embargo in 1994 and restarted\ndiplomatic ties in 1995. Vietnam also established relations with several Asian and Western\nEuropean nations. The economy grew quickly, but also suffered from a common problem of\na more capitalist system: a growing wealth gap between rich and poor, especially along rural\n/ urban lines (China suffers the same situation). And, as in China, government corruption\nand human rights abuses remain major problems. Despite these difficulties, Vietnam quali-\nfied to join the World Trade Organization in 2007.\n165 Another contemporary issue in Vietnam is China\u2019s aggressive moves in the South\nChina Sea, seizing islands which Vietnam considers its territory. The fiercely nationalistic\nVietnamese people responded with protests at the Chinese embassy in Hanoi in 2011. The\nVietnamese government is keen to maintain good relations with China; China is Vietnam\u2019s\nbiggest trading partner, representing almost one-quarter of Vietnam\u2019s foreign trade. The\ngovernment broke up the protests.\nCambodia\nThe history of post-colonial Cambodia is intimately tied up with that of Vietnam,\nbecause the war in Vietnam spilled over into that country\u2019s neighbors. While the French\nwere determined to retain power over Indochina after WWII, King Norodom Sihanouk\nof Cambodia pushed hard for independence. The French granted limited autonomy to the\nkingdom, but Sihanouk declared full independence on November 9, 1953. The French,\nheavily engaged with the Viet Minh, could do nothing about it. The Geneva Accords of\n1954 affirmed the independence of the Kingdom of Cambodia. Sihanouk, only thirty-one\nyears old at the time, soon earned a reputation as one of the most capable, wily, and intoler-\nant politicians in a region full of such leaders.\nTo everyone\u2019s surprise, Sihanouk abdicated the throne in 1955 in order to pursue a\npartisan political career; his father took the throne. It is thought that Sihanouk believed that\nthis would relieve him of the constricting role of monarch, while allowing him to enjoy the\nmystique and deference that royalty granted him. He quickly established a new conservative\npolitical party, the Sangkum, by merging several rightist parties. When campaigning for\nPrime Minister, Sihanouk used his social influence to have opposition politicians arrested\nand imprisoned, guaranteeing that he would win the election in 1955. In 1960, he created a\nnew position, head of state, and won the referendum for the position.\nSihanouk played a complex game in foreign relations, shifting towards one side or\nthe other in the Cold War, all while declaring neutrality in the contest. He hoped to play off\neach side against the other and come out ahead of both. If he had any philosophy \u2013 other\nthan self-aggrandizement \u2013 it was preserving Cambodia\u2019s independence in a region that\nwas, at the time, consumed by aggression and betrayal. For example, Sihanouk accepted\nmilitary and financial aid from the US until it appeared, in 1965, that North Vietnam would\nwin the war against the South. At that point, he cut relations with the US and allowed the\nNorth Vietnamese to construct permanent bases in Cambodia. Then he decided that the\nVietnamese and their communist allies in Cambodia were becoming too powerful, and al-\nlowed the US to attack Viet Cong bases in Cambodia. He restored relations with the US the\nnext year.\nDomestically, he nationalized banking and foreign trade, thus removing foreign in-\nfluence from those sectors. Economically, he pursued a vague system of Buddhist Socialism\n(similar to Christian Socialism in Europe). However, this system concentrated economic\npower into his own party, permitting ever-more embezzlement and nepotism. He also\ngranted women the franchise in Cambodia, not that it meant much \u2013 through rigged elec-\ntions and other forms of corruption, the Sangkum was practically the only legal party in the\nkingdom.\nIn 1970, while Sihanouk was vacationing in France, Prime Minister Lon Nol led a\ncoup against Sihanouk on the claim that allowing the Vietnamese to remain in Cambodia\nwas drawing the nation into the Vietnam War; his new regime was far right-wing and de-\nspised communists. The National Assembly voted to depose Sihanouk and grant Lon Nol\nextensive emergency powers. Sihanouk went into exile in China, and Lon Nol renamed the\ncountry the Khmer Republic (Khmer is the main ethnic group of Cambodia, as well as the\nname of its language).\n166 Chapter 7: Southeast Asia The new republic found little peace. From China, Sihanouk formed a leftist rebel\ngroup to oust the rightist Lon Nol. Worse yet, the Chinese persuaded a powerful Cambodian\ncommunist group, the Khmer Rouge, to side with Sihanouk in his struggle against the re-\npublic, hoping that the result would be a friendly communist state on their border. This\nfighting was known as the Cambodian Civil War. The US armed the republic\u2019s troops and\nassisted with aerial bombardment, which, by 1973 was its only remaining strategy. It wasn\u2019t\nenough. The Khmer Rouge conquered the capitol of Phnom Penh and soon established\nDemocratic Kampuchea, with political beliefs based on a synthesis of Maoism and Khmer\nnationalism. While run by a committee, the Khmer Rouge were effectively led by Pol Pot,\nknown as \u201cBrother Number 1.\u201d\nThe Khmer Rouge instituted the most extreme social engineering project in 20th\ncentury history, surpassing even the savagery of Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution. Details of their\npolitical program are sketchy, due to the secrecy of their regime, and interpretations of their\ntheories are debated to this day. Essentially, the Khmer Rouge wanted to return to the glory\ndays of their great Angkor Empire (802\u20131431 AD), a time before Western imperialism. They\nfiercely hated anything Western, as well as all non-Khmer people. Therefore, their program\nwas based on returning to a pure version of their culture, unstained by French influence.\nBy extension, they viewed anything modern \u2013 Western medicine, higher education, and so\non \u2013 as evils to be destroyed. This was not merely theory; they meant to destroy modernity\nin their country.\nDeclaring that they were now in the Year Zero and that God was dead, the regime\nproceeded to empty out the cities at gunpoint. The city people were either murdered or sent\nto farming collectives to grow rice. Education, religion, and media were all forbidden; fac-\ntories and hospitals were closed. The Khmer Rouge party ran all aspects of human life with\nan iron fist, mercilessly killing anyone with an education, anyone who wasn\u2019t Khmer (such\nas those of Chinese or Vietnamese descent), and all those professing a religion. Through\nmurder and the starvation from their inefficient farming and medical systems, the Khmer\nRouge killed approximately 2 million people, or 25% of their entire population.\nPrince Sihanouk was returned to Cambodia / Kampuchea in 1975 by the Khmer\nRouge to serve as a figurehead king, a link to the old days of empire; but he quickly grew\ndisillusioned with them and was placed under house arrest.\nThe Khmer Rouge\u2019s critical error was their aggression against Vietnam. Fearing\nthat Vietnam planned to dominate Cambodia, as it had in the past, the fiercely nationalistic\nleaders decided to attack Vietnam. Their invasion killed thousands of Vietnamese civilians.\nIn 1979, the Vietnamese counterattacked and destroyed Kampuchea\u2019s army in only two\nweeks, pushing the regime into Thailand, although some Khmer military units continued\nto fight on. Their victory ended the genocidal policies of the Khmer Rouge and established\na communist government in Cambodia. The UN negotiated an end to hostilities, set up a\npeacekeeping force in Cambodia and, for the first time, actually ran the nation until demo-\ncratic elections could be held in 1993.\nThe Vietnamese had released Sihanouk from house arrest when they defeated the\nKhmer Rouge; now, he became King of Cambodia once again, heading a constitutional\nmonarchy. He abdicated the throne again in 2004, owing to old age, and was succeeded by\nhis son, Norodom Sihamoni. He died in 2012 and is remembered, like Fidel Castro, as a\ntrue survivor; moreover, he gave Cambodians a sense of stability and continuity during an\nextremely unstable time in their national history.\nSince 1993, Cambodian politics have been dominated by three issues. The first is\nfacing the nation\u2019s recent history of genocide. In 1994, thousands of Khmer Rouge guerillas\nsurrendered as part of a government amnesty, ending their threat to the country; but that\ndid not settle the question of justice for their former leaders. Some of these leaders, such as\nPol Pot, had already died in exile. In July 2007, UN-backed\n167 tribunals finally began in Cambodia, arresting and trying former Khmer Rouge leaders for\ncrimes against humanity and other charges. Several of the main leaders were found guilty\nand given long prison sentences.\nThe second issue has been Cambodia\u2019s historically bad relationship with Thailand;\nthe two kingdoms have fought many wars along their border. The modern controversies\nlargely surround nationalist sentiments on both sides of the border and ownership of his-\ntoric archeological sites in the frontier region. There have even been shooting incidents\nbetween the two countries in the border region, with UN efforts to cool the tensions.\nFinally, Cambodia has a notably corrupt and undemocratic government.\nEmbezzlement, bribery, and nepotism are rampant across the political hierarchy. In 2021,\nTransparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index ranked Cambodia as the 23rd\nmost corrupt nation in the world, out of the 180 nations they cover. Elections are typically\nunfair or rigged; as a result, the Prime Minister, Hun Sen, has held the office for 25 years.\nDespite these problems, Cambodia\u2019s constitutional monarchy has survived. Like all decol-\nonized nations, Cambodia faces a long struggle towards true democracy; given its horrific\nrecent past, it is unsurprising that Cambodia\u2019s road would be longer and more difficult than\nmost.\nIndonesia\nThe history of Dutch imperialism in Indonesia is remarkably similar to that of the\nBritish East India Company in India. In 1602, the royal government of the Netherlands\nfounded the Dutch East India Company, the first multinational corporation, to colonize\nwhat is now Indonesia and monopolize its lucrative spice trade. This company became even\nricher than its British counterpart, sending over two and a half million tons of Asian goods\nto Europe over its lifetime. But, like its British counterpart, it was eventually nationalized\nand its Asian possessions became a colony of the Netherlands known as the Dutch East\nIndies, founded in 1800. At the time, the archipelago was not politically united; the inhab-\nitants were a collection of many different ethnicities and religions. As with India, it was\nthe imperialists who unwittingly united the people under a single concept: their desire for\nindependence. Nationalists of the archipelago called themselves Indonesians.\nThe Dutch effectively suppressed nationalist activity in the colony until the start\nof World War II changed the situation. Japan invaded the Dutch East Indies in January\n1942, and the colonial defenders surrendered three months later. At first, most Indonesians\nwelcomed the Japanese as liberators from the Dutch. The Japanese, however, exploited the\npeople ruthlessly. The conquerors forced approximately half a million Indonesians to work\nfor them under appalling conditions, sometimes deporting them to other countries; they\nalso seized food crops to feed their army. Between overwork, seizure of food, and the vio-\nlent repression of dissent, the Japanese killed about four million Indonesians during their\noccupation.\nOn the other hand, Japan prepared Indonesia for independence. The Japanese al-\nlowed the Indonesians to establish a local collaborationist government to administer the\ncolony, to help them exploit the colony\u2019s assets. This gave the Indonesians some experience\nin self-rule. As the Allies fought their way across the Pacific, the Japanese feared that the\nAllies might invade Indonesia. They wanted the Indonesians to help them resist an inva-\nsion, telling them that the Dutch would reimpose colonial rule if they won. The Japanese\nencouraged nationalism to promote their new program of local defense. This later led to an\nindependence movement when the Dutch finally returned. Considering these two themes\nof exploitation and the encouragement of nationalism, it is easy to see why the Indonesians\nhad a rather ambivalent attitude towards the Japanese.\n168 Chapter 7: Southeast Asia Map of Indonesia, The primary leader of the Indonesian nationalists (among many) was an architect\nwith names of some\nnamed Sukarno (like many Javanese people, he used only one name). Sukarno was a very\nof the many islands in\nthe archipelago. From intelligent man, fluent in several languages, and fiercely nationalistic. Like Nehru in India,\nWikipedia Commons. Sukarno believed that independence had to be wedded with modernity to build a strong\nnation. When the Japanese invaded, they found that the Dutch colonial government had\nsent him into internal exile in Indonesia, cut off from his supporters. The Japanese brought\nhim back and asked him to lead nationalist and collaborationist efforts. He agreed, hoping\nthe Japanese would eventually grant his nation independence.\nThat moment came sooner than he expected. When Japan surrendered in August\n1945, both the Japanese and Indonesian nationalists pushed him to declare independence.\nHe hesitated, as he was uncertain how the Allies would treat those who collaborated with\nthe Japanese during the war. But he bowed to pressure, and on August 17 declared the\nindependence of Indonesia. The guiding principles of the constitution were known as the\nPancasila: humanitarianism, national unity, democracy, social justice (manifesting as so-\ncialist economic programs), and belief in God (and not any particular religion, in order to\nunite Indonesians of all faiths). The nationalist plan also called for Sukarno to serve as the\nfirst president, and fellow nationalist Mohammad Hatta to be his vice president.\nThe situation in Indonesia was extremely complex. Many different nationalist\ngroups had armed themselves \u2013 some of them with weapons and previous training from the\nJapanese \u2013 and tried to assert authority in Indonesia. Sukarno and Hatta were not in control\nof most of it, and revolutionaries killed anyone they thought to be an enemy of Indonesian\nnationalism, from wealthy landowners and feudal lords, to foreigners, ethnic minorities,\nand Japanese troops.\nThe situation grew more complicated still as Allied forces, led by the British, ar-\nrived in late September 1945. While British forces had no objectives other than maintaining\norder, the Dutch troops were intent on regaining imperial control. In October, a major\nbattle erupted in Surabaya in East Java, as local nationalist groups attacked British troops;\nthe subsequent battle was the bloodiest in the revolution. The nationalists were defeated,\nbut it showed the Westerners that the nationalists were a force they could not ignore.\nThe Dutch entered years-long negotiations with Sukarno, hoping to secure some\npower-sharing arrangement which would give them access to the resources of Indonesia.\nThe nationalists not only faced Dutch troops, but internal threats as well. Muslim sepa-\nratists pronounced the Indonesian Islamic State, a breakaway nation under Shariah rule.\nIn September 1948, an Indonesian communist group clashed with nationalists, claiming\nthat the nationalists were selling out to the Dutch by negotiating. When nationalist forces\ndefeated them, it had the benefit of endearing the nationalists to the United States, who now\nviewed Sukarno as a potential ally in the Cold War.\n169 In December 1948, the Dutch re-opened their offensive against the nationalists, and\nwhile they were successful on the battlefield, the effort backfired. The international commu-\nnity and the UN both supported the nationalists (it was one of the few times the US and\nthe USSR agreed on something). Furthermore, the US was providing the Netherlands with\nmillions of dollars in financial support as part of the Marshall Plan; the US now threatened\nto cut off this support if the Dutch did not accept a peace treaty and independence. This\nwas an interesting case of dollar diplomacy, with the US reining in the Netherlands with\nmoney instead of force.\nThe Dutch could not afford to lose US aid or suffer international condemnation.\nThey agreed to turn over sovereignty to Indonesia in December 1949, though not in the\nway the nationalists wanted. The Dutch established an independent state that was a loose\nconfederation of non-contiguous states, some ruled by old feudal leaders. The nationalists\naccepted the deal, and the Dutch withdrew their forces. Within a year, the nationalists in\nthe new parliament voted to disband this rickety system and create a unified republic. In\nAugust 1950, the Republic of Indonesia was born, led by Sukarno and Hatta. The nation-\nalists had secured their victory exactly five years to the day after Sukarno\u2019s declaration of\nindependence.\nThe initial period, from 1950 to 1959, was very chaotic. This was the first time that\nIndonesians had practiced national-level self-rule. There was a bewildering array of social\nvoices in the new political scene. Some Muslin groups wanted Indonesia to be governed by\nSharia. The communists, powerful in the cities, pushed for Marxist policies. Then there were\nregional affiliations, largely based on the rivalry between heavily-populated Java and the\nmore rural outlaying regions. Class interests and ethnic differences also played a role. All\nthese different groups coalesced into various political parties, vying for power in the par-\nliament. Even the Army sought political representation as a distinct social group. Various\nrevolts broke out around the country, and the Army was busy suppressing them; this gave\nthe military particular political clout, as it was regarded as a necessary organization for na-\ntional unity.\nThe economy was in bad condition. The revolution had destroyed important in-\nfrastructure, and many of the skilled technical workers had fled the violence or were killed.\nInflation skyrocketed and agricultural distribution failed. While Sukarno was focused on\nbuilding national unity and pride, he had no answers to the nation\u2019s economic problems,\nand at times seemed hardly worried about them.\nIn international relations, Sukarno hosted the Bandung Conference in 1955, in\nwhich newly-decolonized nations promised to oppose imperialism and cooperate in build-\ning their new nations. It was also viewed as an early step in the nonaligned movement.\nAs the decade wore on, Sukarno became discouraged with the parliamentary system\nin Indonesia. It was accomplishing little, and seemed to be sidelining him as a political\nforce. Hatta resigned from the vice presidency. Sukarno traveled to China and met Mao\nZedong, admiring Mao\u2019s centralized control over the nation. Sukarno was now convinced\nthat Western-style democracy would not work in Indonesia. Over a period of two years, he\nestablished martial law in Indonesia and created a new system of government. By 1959, the\nnew system was in place: Guided Democracy.\nRather than rely on parliamentary democracy, Sukarno turned instead to tradi-\ntional indigenous politics, in which community elders governed by creating consensus be-\ntween different groups, rather than by voting. He set up a corporatist federal structure, with\ndifferent social groups represented in his National Council. He then worked to encourage\nthese different groups to reach a consensus agreement on different political issues, so that\nno group would come away empty-handed and ready to revolt. The two most important\ngroups were the military and the communists, who had to be carefully balanced against\neach other to prevent the violence that either could initiate.\n170 Chapter 7: Southeast Asia Sukarno was growing more assertive, and even aggressive, in international affairs.\nIn 1962, the nation almost launched a war against the Dutch for possession of Western\nNew Guinea, the last region of Indonesia still in Dutch hands. A last-minute agreement\ntransferred power to Indonesia, avoiding another war with the Netherlands.\nIn September 1963, the British relinquished control of their Malayan colonies,\nestablishing the new nation of Malaysia. Sukarno saw Malaysia as a British puppet state\nintended to expand Western dominance over the region. In response, Sukarno launched\na low-grade war against Malaysia known as the Konfrontasi. This was a combination of\nsmall-scale ground combat and terrorist attacks designed to inspire racial conflict within\nMalaysia. It continued until an armistice was agreed in 1966, with Malaysia having survived\nthe test.\nAll the while, Sukarno was denouncing the US and the West and moving closer to\nthe USSR and China, viewing those nations as the only hope to prevent further Western\ndominance of Southeast Asia.Then Sukarno\u2019s political balancing act between the army and\nthe communists failed.\nIn October 1965, General Suharto launched a coup, claiming that a communist\nrevolt was in progress, something the communist parties denied. Nevertheless, Suharto led\na massacre of communists across the nation, killing untold thousands of them. He then\nproceeded to force Sukarno to grant him more power, power which he then used to remove\nSukarno from office and make himself head of government. In 1968, Suharto was formally\nappointed president.\nSuharto immediately replaced Sukarno\u2019s vision for the country with policies\ntermed \u201cThe New Order.\u201d Indonesia now sought foreign investment, particularly in the oil\nindustry. Complex business regulations were simplified, and Suharto re-negotiated foreign\ndebt at advantageous terms. The economy grew spectacularly, but not at all evenly. Wealthy\nmiddle and upper-class businesspeople benefitted far more than the massive lower class.\nSuharto was also guilty of large-scale nepotism; his family members were given tremendous\nadvantages, such as no-bid government contracts, and amassed a huge fortune as result.\nJava, where most of the factories were located, grew faster than rural areas, although the\ngovernment took some steps to rectify the regional differences. Politically, Suharto had the\nsupport of the military and used it to maintain authoritarian control, while still allowing\na degree of democracy. Still, Suharto had to suppress uprisings, particularly Islamic ones,\nand even invaded the Portuguese colony of East Timor in the archipelago, stirring up a\nlong-lasting insurgency against Indonesia and drawing accusations of imperialism.\nIn 1998, a monetary crisis in Thailand threw the entire Asian economy into dis-\norder, badly affecting Indonesia. Organized riots broke out in Jakarta, and the parliament\nrefused to cooperate with Suharto. The ageing Suharto decided to resign the presidency. He\nwas to be (to date) the last of the Indonesian strongmen.\nThe next period was known as Reformasi (political reformation) which contin-\nued over the course of several presidencies. Reformasi referred to the strengthening of\ndemocracy, elections, and freedom of speech, as well as more effective law enforcement. Of\ncourse, this new freedom produced more calls for independence from different sectors of\nsociety, threatening national unity. Corruption and political scandals continued, including\none presidential impeachment. Internationally, Indonesia became more integrated into the\nglobal economy, and East Timor was granted independence in 2002.\nDespite political scandals, and several major natural disasters such as the 2004 tsunami, the\neconomy grew steadily until 2013, when it finally began to cool. Politically, the country has\nimproved over the last twenty years, with the chances of uprisings and revolts diminishing.\n171 The island city-state of Singapore\nis located at the southern tip of\nthe Malaysian Peninsula.\nSingapore\nWhile the city-state of Singapore resembles Vietnam, Cambodia, and Indonesia\ninasmuch as it was a participant in decolonization, its history is very different from those\nnations. In fact, Singapore\u2019s history is unique, and demonstrates how well decolonization\ncan progress. Singapore is, for the most part, a success story, especially compared with the\nrest of Southeast Asia.\nSingapore is a city-state (a nation made up of a single city). There are only three\nof these left in the world, the other two being Monaco and Vatican City. The nation of\nSingapore is a small island on the southern tip of the Malaysian Peninsula, only 274 square\nmiles in area (slightly larger than El Paso, Texas). The British took control of the island in the\nearly 19th century and established a port. It was an excellent choice of location, astride the\nStraits of Malacca. Most of the world\u2019s Asian maritime trade passed through these straits, so\nthe British turned the island city into an entrepot. This type of port is used as a convenient\nlocation to unload and store trade goods, where they are then purchased and shipped to\nother regions. Furthermore, the port was on an island, making it easily defensible (or so the\nBritish thought). Since the British also owned the colony of Malaysia adjacent to Singapore,\nthey believed the island was quite secure. Over the next 200 years, Singapore became one of\nthe primary trading ports and most cosmopolitan cities in the world, bustling with shipping\nand trade and home to expatriates from around the world.\nIn early 1942, the Japanese captured Malaysia and Singapore as part of their Pacific\ncampaign. Although Singapore was strongly defended against attack from the sea, the\nJapanese came down the Malaysia peninsula and captured the city from behind, handing\nthe British Empire a humiliating defeat. During the war, Allied forces never attempted to\ncapture Singapore, preferring to bypass it on their way to Japan. They couldn\u2019t afford to let\n172 Chapter 7: Southeast Asia the Japanese keep such an elaborate port, either, so they bombed the port severely. When\nthe Japanese evacuated Singapore after the war, the British returned to retake control of the\nisland colony.\nWhen they arrived, they found that city had devolved into near-anarchy. Allied\nbombing had not only destroyed the port facilities, but also the city\u2019s infrastructure; there\nwas no electricity, running water, or telephone service. The population lacked food, which\nled to robbery and violent crime. The British military government worked to reestablish\nbasic services and get the port back into operation.\nThe British, however, found that the locals had a different attitude towards them\nnow. While the British had presented themselves as invincible before the war, their defeat\nat the hands of Asians proved otherwise. Singaporeans\u2019 resentment of imperial rule now\nmanifest as workers\u2019 strikes against the British; their new attitude was summed up by the\npopular word merdeka \u2013 \u201cindependence\u201d in the Malay language. This attitude was similar\nto what the Dutch encountered in Indonesia and the French found in Indochina. But the\nBritish, who had not been occupied by the Nazis during the war, were prepared to leave\nSingapore, as they were already leaving India.\nThe process of decolonization was delayed by a communist insurgency in Malaysia\nknown as the Malayan Emergency. The British, as junior partners in the Cold War with\nthe US, were unwilling to leave Malaysia and Singapore while the insurgents were trying\nto establish a socialist government. In both colonies, the British instituted the Internal\nSecurity Act, which allowed them to arrest and imprison, without trial, anyone thought to\nbe a threat to security. As the Malaysian insurgents were socialists, the British cracked down\non Singaporean leftists, socialists or not. Since most of the pro-independence leaders were\nleftists, this was viewed as an attack on independence itself.\nThe worst of the Malayan Emergency was over by 1953, brutally suppressed by the\nBritish. At this point, the British decided to transition Singapore, by degrees, to indepen-\ndence. The preliminary step was to create a local Legislative Assembly that would eventually\nserve as the parliament. For now, the British would retain control over security, and had\nthe power to veto any of the Assembly\u2019s legislation. When elections for Assembly were held\nin 1959, the left-wing People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) dominated the legislature \u2013 much to\nthe UK\u2019s chagrin, too, as some of the PAP members were pro-communist. Lee Kuan Yew\nbecame the first prime minister.\nThe PAP\u2019s priority was eliminating poverty, mainly by inviting foreign investment\ninto Singapore. The assembly drained a swamp and built a large industrial park outside the\ncity, then enticed foreign corporations to set up there by offering strong tax incentives. It\nalso modernized the education system, as an educated population would be necessary to\nattract foreign investment; all students were required to learn English in addition to Malay.\nThe PAP also invested heavily in a public housing program to aid the homeless. They built\nover 25,000 new apartments; they were hardly luxurious, but were affordable and went a\nlong way towards ending homelessness.\nDespite these efforts, PAP leadership was dubious that Singapore could survive as\nan independent nation. After all, it had no natural resources and no room for expansion. It\nseemed completely dependent on the vicissitudes of global trade. Some leaders thought that,\nwhen the UK granted Malaysia its independence, Singapore should become part of that new\nnation, rather than go it alone. Not all PAP members agreed; the leftists opposed the idea\nbecause Malaysians were quite anticommunist and right-wing after the Emergency, and so\nthought they would suddenly find themselves in a hostile country. The ruling factions of\nMalaysia were wary as well, as their power base was among the ethnic Malay population,\nand the Singaporeans were majority Chinese. They felt that Singapore would be natural-\nly opposed to Malaysian control. Nevertheless, the UK decided to grant independence to\nboth Singapore and Malaysia together, as a single country. In July 1963, the Federation of\nMalaysia was founded.\n173 Ethnic tensions between the Malays and Chinese immediately flared. Since Malaysia\nwas majority Malayan, the government instituted affirmative action programs benefitting\nMalays; the Chinese majority of Singapore resented this. Rumors also circulated through\nMalaysia that the PAP was abusing Malays in Singapore. This was the moment that Sukarno\nchose to launch the Konfrontasi to instigate ethnic strife in the new nation and break it\napart. The resulting riots required police actions and curfews to suppress.\nWhile the Konfrontasi ended, the ill-will between ethnicities was such that, in\nAugust 1965, the parliament of Malaysia voted to oust the city of Singapore from the nation.\nSingapore had no choice but to become an independent state, the Republic of Singapore.\nIn this respect, the Konfrontasi had been a success. The UN accepted Singapore\u2019s applica-\ntion, and the city \u2013 state had to make nationhood work, like it or not. The PAP remained\nin power, and Lee Kuan Yew remained prime minister; during the merger, however, he had\nremoved leftist politicians from the party, as they had opposed his plans for the merger, and\nshifted its policies to center-right.\nFortunately, the PAP had set in motion the programs to improve the economy\nthrough foreign investment, and subsequent governments retained this program. Singapore\ninvited major oil companies to establish refineries on the island, offering generous tax in-\ncentives. Soon, Singapore became a major refinery hub, although the nation itself had no\noil reserves. Its manufacturing base was threatened in the 1980s when other Asian nations\nheld the advantage of large, cheap labor forces; Singapore adapted by switching to high-tech\nindustries, such as computer silicon wafer manufacturing, which gave their better-educat-\ned workers a competitive advantage. Singapore continued to expand public housing, and\nfought unemployment by investing in the service sectors \u2013 restaurants and so on \u2013 to meet\nthe needs of the growing tourist industry. The PAP was the primary political party the entire\ntime, and Lee Kuan Yew the prime minister from 1959 to 1990; he is often regarded as the\nfather of the country.\nThe PAP was economically very successful, and Singapore now has the sec-\nond-highest per capita GDP in the world. It has a less stellar reputation for human rights.\nAlthough the PAP has kept the government remarkably free of corruption (it is thought\nto be the 4th least corrupt in the world), Lee Kuan Yew was known as a harsh, authoritar-\nian figure, though hardly a Mao or Pol Pot. He often repressed labor unions, suppressed\nfree speech and demonstrations, and charged political opponents with defamation. Even\ntoday, the government is considered a \u201cflawed democracy,\u201d with room for improvement in\ntransparency and freedom. Male homosexual behavior, for example, is still outlawed, as are\npublic protests outside of a single place in the city.\n174 Chapter 7: Southeast Asia Conclusions\nAfter the war, all the countries in this chapter shared three things: European\nimperialism, Japanese occupation, and growing nationalism and anti-imperialism. While\ndecolonization was never entirely smooth, the Cold War complicated it further. Communist\ninvolvement in the process brought the attention of the US, UK, China, and the USSR, all of\nwhich sought to influence the process to their benefit.\nOne major factor in decolonization was the recent history of the local imperial power.\nBecause of their experience in the war, the French and Dutch decided to re-occupy their\ncolonies, inevitably leading to violence, particularly in Indochina. Even the British, who were\nacquiescing to decolonization, found it difficult to withdraw while preventing communists from\ntaking power in their stead. Nevertheless, British colonies suffered much less violence than\nthose fought for by France and the Netherlands.\nNewly-independent nations faced an intimidating list of social, economic, and political\nproblems. Ethnic tensions, long repressed by the imperialists, came to the fore. Different groups\nvied for political power, including those willing to use violence in pursuit of their goals. The\nresurgence of nationalism complicated relations with the developed world. Interestingly, this\nmanifested in post-colonial art, which shied away from European influences and explored\nindigenous themes and styles instead. The trend moderated by the mid-1980s, when the new\nnations were ready to socially re-engage with the West on their own terms. Social trends can\nusually be traced in popular art in this way.\nIn the end, nations which charted the most moderate course developed the quickest,\nthough never without difficulty. And extremist responses were, unsurprisingly, seen mostly\nwhere the imperialists fought to retain the colony. Extremist tendencies had mostly run\ntheir courses by the 1980s, by which time the region was stabilized and mainly devoted to\ndemocracy. Southeast Asia\u2019s problems are not over, but the region now has the necessary\npolitical and social stability to address its problems without resorting to radicalism.\nSuggested Further Reading\nA Brief History of Vietnam: Colonialism, War and Renewal: The Story of a Nation Transformed by Bill Hayton\n(Tuttle Publishing, 2022).

They are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; among these are\nLife, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201d\nThis immortal statement was made in the Declaration of Independence of the United States of America in 1776.\nIn a broader sense, this means: All the peoples on the earth are equal from birth, all the peoples have a right to\nlive, to be happy and free.\nThe Declaration of the French Revolution made in 1791 on the Rights of Man and the Citizen also states: \u201cAll\nmen are born free and with equal rights, and must always remain free and have equal rights.\u201d\nThose are undeniable truths.\nNevertheless, for more than eighty years, the French imperialists, abusing the standard of Liberty, Equality,\nand Fraternity, have violated our Fatherland and oppressed our fellow-citizens. They have acted contrary to the\nideals of humanity and justice.\nIn the field of politics, they have deprived our people of every democratic liberty.\n178 Chapter 7: Southeast Asia They have enforced inhuman laws; they have set up three distinct political regimes in the North, the Center,\nand the South of Vietnam in order to wreck our national unity and prevent our people from being united.\nThey have built more prisons than schools. They have mercilessly slain our patriots; they have drowned our\nuprisings in rivers of blood.\nThey have fettered public opinion; they have practiced obscurantism against our people.\nTo weaken our race they have forced us to use opium and alcohol.\nIn the field of economics, they have fleeced us to the backbone, impoverished our people, and devastated our\nland.\nThey have robbed us of our rice fields, our mines, our forests, and our raw materials. They have monopolized\nthe issuing of banknotes and the export trade.\nThey have invented numerous unjustifiable taxes and reduced our people, especially our peasantry, to a state of\nextreme poverty.\nThey have hampered the prospering of our national bourgeoisie; they have mercilessly exploited our workers.\nIn the autumn of 1940, when the Japanese Fascists violated Indochina\u2019s territory to establish new bases in their\nfight against the Allies, the French imperialists went down on their bended knees and handed over our country\nto them.\nThus, from that date, our people were subjected to the double yoke of the French and the Japanese. Their\nsufferings and miseries increased. The result was that from the end of last year to the beginning of this year,\nfrom Quang Tri province to the North of Vietnam, more than two million of our fellow citizens died from\nstarvation. On March 9, the French troops were disarmed by the Japanese. The French colonialists either fled\nor surrendered showing that not only were they incapable of \u201cprotecting\u201d us, but that, in the span of five years,\nthey had twice sold our country to the Japanese.\nOn several occasions before March 9, the Vietminh League urged the French to ally themselves with it against\nthe Japanese. Instead of agreeing to this proposal, the French colonialists so intensified their terrorist activities\nagainst the Vietminh members that before fleeing they massacred a great number of our political prisoners\ndetained at Yen Bay and Caobang.\nNotwithstanding all this, our fellow -citizens have always manifested toward the French a tolerant and humane\nattitude. Even after the Japanese putsch of March 1945, the Vietminh League helped many Frenchmen to cross\nthe frontier, rescued some of them from Japanese jails, and protected French lives and property.\nFrom the autumn of 1940, our country had in fact ceased to be a French colony and had become a Japanese\npossession.\nAfter the Japanese had surrendered to the Allies, our whole people rose to regain our national sovereignty and\nto found the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.\nThe truth is that we have wrested our independence from the Japanese and not from the French.\nThe French have fled, the Japanese have capitulated, Emperor Bao Dai has abdicated. Our people have broken\n179 the chains which for nearly a century have fettered them and have won independence for the Fatherland.\nOur people at the same time have overthrown the monarchic regime that has reigned supreme for dozens of\ncenturies. In its place has been established the present Democratic Republic.\nFor these reasons, we, members of the Provisional Government, representing the whole Vietnamese people,\ndeclare that from now on we break off all relations of a colonial character with France; we repeal all the\ninternational obligation that France has so far subscribed to on behalf of Vietnam and we abolish all the special\nrights the French have unlawfully acquired in our Fatherland.\nThe whole Vietnamese people, animated by a common purpose, are determined to fight to the bitter end\nagainst any attempt by the French colonialists to reconquer their country.\nWe are convinced that the Allied nations, which at Tehran and San Francisco have acknowledged the principles\nof self-determination and equality of nations, will not refuse to acknowledge the independence of Vietnam.\nA people who have courageously opposed French domination for more than eight years, a people who have\nfought side by side with the Allies against the Fascists during these last years, such a people must be free and\nindependent.\nFor these reasons, we, members of the Provisional Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam,\nsolemnly declare to the world that Vietnam has the right to be a free and independent country-and in fact is\nso already. The entire Vietnamese people are determined to mobilize all their physical and mental strength, to\nsacrifice their lives and property in order to safeguard their independence and liberty.\nHo Chi Minh, \u201cDeclaration of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, \u201c Selected Writings\n(Hanoi: Foreign Languages Publishing House, 1977), pp. 5356.\nHo Chi Minh, Selected Works Vol. 3, (Hanoi: Foreign Languages Publishing House, 1960\u201362).\nPresident Sukarno of Indonesia:\nSpeech at the Opening of the Bandung Conference,\nApril 18 1955 (excerpts)\nThis twentieth century has been a period of terrific dynamism. Perhaps the last fifty years have seen more\ndevelopments and more material progress than the previous five hundred years. Man has learned to control\nmany of the scourges which once threatened him. He has learned to consume distance. He has learned to\nproject his voice and his picture across oceans and continents. lie has probed deep into the secrets of nature\nand learned how to make the desert bloom and the plants of the earth increase their bounty. He has learned\nhow to release the immense forces locked in the smallest particles of matter.\nBut has man\u2019s political skill marched hand-in-hand with his technical and scientific skill? Man can chain\nlightning to his command-can be control the society in which be lives? The answer is No! The political skill\nof man has been far outstripped by technical skill, and what lie has made he cannot be sure of controlling.\nThe result of this is fear. And man gasps for safety and morality. Perhaps now more than at any other moment\nin the history of the world, society, government and statesmanship need to be based upon the highest code\nof morality and ethics. And in political terms, what is the highest code of morality? It is the subordination of\neverything to the well-being of mankind.\nBut today we are faced with a situation where the well-being of mankind is not always the primary\n180 Chapter 7: Southeast Asia consideration. Many who are in places of high power think, rather, of controlling the world. Yes, we are living\nin a world of fear. The life of man today is corroded and made bitter by fear. Fear of the future, fear of the\nhydrogen bomb, fear of ideologies.\nPerhaps this fear is a greater danger than the danger itself, because it is fear which drives mento act foolishly,\nto act thoughtlessly, to act dangerously. . .. All of us, I am certain, are united by more important things than\nthose which superficially divide us. We are united, for instance, by a common detestation of colonialism\nin whatever form it appears. We are united by a common detestation of racialism. And we are united by a\ncommon determination to preserve and stabilise peace in the world. . . .\nWe are often told \u201cColonialism is dead.\u201d Let us not be deceived or even soothed by that. 1 say to you,\ncolonialism is not yet dead. How can we say it is dead, so long as vast areas of Asia and Africa are unfree.\nAnd, I beg of you do not think of colonialism only in the classic form which we of Indonesia, and our\nbrothers in different parts of Asia and Africa, knew. Colonialism has also its modern dress, in the form of\neconomic control, intellectual control, actual physical control by a small but alien community within a\nnation. It is a skillful and determined enemy, and it appears in many guises. It does not give up its loot easily.\nWherever, whenever and however it appears, colonialism is an evil thing, and one which must be eradicated\nfrom the earth. . . .\nNot so very long ago we argued that peace was necessary for us because an outbreak of fighting in our part\nof the world would imperil our precious independence, so recently won at such great cost. Today, the picture\nis more black. War would riot only mean a threat to our independence, it may mean the end of civilisation and\neven of human life. There is a force loose in the world whose potentiality for evil no man truly knows. Even in\npractice and rehearsal for war the effects may well be building up into something of unknown horror.\nNot so long ago it was possible to take some little comfort from the idea that the clash, if it came, could\nperhaps be settled by what were called \u201cconventional weapons \u201c-bombs, tanks, cannon and men. Today\nthat little grain of comfort is denied us for it has been made clear that the weapons of ultimate horror will\ncertainly be used, and the military planning of nations is on that basis. The unconventional has become the\nconventional, and who knows what other examples of misguided and diabolical scientific skill have been\ndiscovered as a plague on humanity.\nAnd do not think that the oceans and the seas will protect us. The food that we cat, the water that we drink,\nyes, even the very air that we breathe can be contaminated by poisons originating from thousands of miles\naway. And it could be that, even if we ourselves escaped lightly, the unborn generations of our children would\nbear on their distorted bodies the marks of our failure to control the forces which have been released on the\nworld. No task is more urgent than that of preserving peace. Without peace our independence means little. The\nrehabilitation and upbuilding of our countries will have little meaning. Our revolutions will not be allowed to\nrun their course. . . .\nWhat can we do? We can do much! We can inject the voice of reason into world affairs. We can mobilise all\nthe spiritual, all the moral, all the political strength of Asia and Africa on the side of peace. Yes, we! We, the\npeoples of Asia and Africa, 1,400,000,000 strong, far more than half the human population of the world, we\ncan mobilise what I have called the Moral Violence of Nations in favour of peace. We can demonstrate to the\nminority of the world which lives on the other continents that we, the majority are for peace, not for war, and\nthat whatever strength we have will always be thrown on to the side of peace.\nIn this struggle, some success has already been scored. I think it is generally recognised that the activity of\n181 the Prime Ministers of the Sponsoring Countries which invited you here had a not unimportant role to play in\nending the fighting in Indo-China. Look, the peoples of Asia raised their voices, and the world listened. It was\nno small victory and no negligible precedent! The five Prime Ministers did not make threats. They issued no\nultimatum, they mobilised no troops. Instead they consulted together, discussed the issues, pooled their ideas,\nadded together their individual political skills and came forward with sound and reasoned suggestions which\nformed the basis for a settlement of the long struggle in Indo-China.\nI have often since then asked myself why these five were successful when others, with long records of\ndiplomacy, were unsuccessful, and, in fact, had allowed a bad situation to get worse, so that there was a danger\nof the conflict spreading. . . .\nI think that the answer really lies in the fact that those five Prime Ministers brought a fresh approach to bear\non the problem. They were not seeking advantage for their own countries. They had no axe of power-politics\nto grind. They had but one interest-how to end the fighting in such a way that the chances of continuing peace\nand stability were enhanced. . . .\nSo, let this Asian-African Conference be a great success! Make the \u201cLive and let live\u201d principle and the \u201cUnity\nin Diversity\u201d motto the unifying force which brings us all together-to seek in friendly, uninhibited discussion,\nways and means by which each of us can live his own life, and let others live their own lives, in their own way,\nin harmony, and in peace.\nIf we succeed in doing so, the effect of it for the freedom, independence and the welfare of man will be great\non the world at large. The Light of Understanding has again been lit, the Pillar of Cooperation again erected.\nThe likelihood of success of this Conference is proved already by the very presence of you all here today. It is\nfor us to give it strength, to give it the power of inspiration-to spread its message all over the World.\nSource: from Africa-Asia Speaks from Bandong, (DjakartaL Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 1955),\n19-29.

Both movements ended long periods of\nlegalized, institutionalized racial discrimination in their respective countries, removing\nmajor barriers to true democracy.\nNeither of these movements attained its goals easily; it took years of coordinated\neffort in the face of violent government and social resistance to finally remove\nundemocratic systems in their nations. This chapter will narrate each movement, analyze\nthe outcomes, and compare the two movements.\n183 Jim Crow in the United States\nAfter the US Civil War in the 19th century, the federal government thought that\nwidespread racial discrimination in the South would end, now that slavery was eliminated.\nHowever, after US troops withdrew from former Confederate states, those states enacted\nlaws to prevent African Americans from achieving full citizenship and civil rights. Known\ncolloquially as Jim Crow laws, these state statutes physically separated the races, prevent-\ning African Americans from attending the same schools as Whites, or even using the\nsame restaurants and hotels. They also legalized employment discrimination, preventing\nAfrican Americans from holding well-paid jobs, or jobs with legal power, such as judges.\nFinally, they also prevented African Americans from voting in elections. Although the\nUS Constitution gives all adult citizens the right to vote, Jim Crow laws circumvented the\nConstitution by allowing states to place requirements on voters, such as literacy tests or poll\ntaxes. These laws, therefore, effectively prevented full democracy in the Southern states and\nlegally protected racial discrimination.\nBefore WWII, African Americans challenged Jim Crow laws, and discrimination\nin general, mainly through court challenges and public outreach. Leaders such as Booker T.\nWashington and W.E.B. DuBois struggled against discrimination, although they often used\ndifferent tactics. The strongest advocacy organization was the National Association for the\nAdvancement of Colored People (NAACP), which filed lawsuits against cases of racial\ndiscrimination.\nWWII energized African Americans and their struggle. Many African Americans\nRosa Parks\nserved in the military; they gained leadership experience and confidence in the war, and\nknew that the nation owed them full rights since they had fought for the nation. Also, the\nfascists preached racist doctrines, and Allied propaganda emphasized freedom. It now\nseemed the height of hypocrisy to suppress African American rights after fighting against\nthe very same philosophy during the war. Then, during the Korean War, President Truman\ndesegregated the military, and White and Black Americans fought together side-by-side for\nthe first time.\nBut what is referred to as the Civil Rights Movement began in 1954. Litigants (with\nthe help of the NAACP) sued state governments over segregated schools, claiming that\nschools for African Americans were underfunded and inferior by design. Proponents of\nsegregation claimed that schools, and other facilities, did not violate civil rights because\nthey were \u201cseparate but equal.\u201d The US Supreme Court, in the famous Brown v. Board of\nEducation decision of 1954, proclaimed that \u201cseparate but equal\u201d was a lie, and that the\nclaimants had proven their case. The court then ordered all states to desegregate their\nschools \u201cwith all deliberate speed.\u201d Other rulings desegregated other public spaces, such as\nrestaurants and bus stations. But the states chose to ignore the rulings.\nThis set up the coming conflict. It is the responsibility of the Executive Branch\nof the US federal government to uphold the law, but it was politically explosive to try to\ndesegregate the South, where discrimination was a tradition. Activists now saw that legal\nvictories were not enough to eliminate Jim Crow, because the government would simply\nignore the law. Therefore, the movement which followed was won through direct action,\nsuch as protests and other demonstrations. Activists were now convinced that there was no\nother way. The objective was clear: to dismantle the racist Jim Crow system.\nMartin Luther King, Jr.\nThe first mass demonstration in the movement came in December 1955 in\nMontgomery, Alabama. Rosa Parks, an NAACP activist, refused to give up her seat on\na bus to a White passenger. She was arrested and convicted of violating a local law. This\ntriggered a response from local African American leaders, who formed the Montgomery\nImprovement Association to launch a protest movement. They chose for their leader young\nBaptist minister of extraordinary charisma and ability: Martin Luther King Jr. In King\u2019s\n184 Chapter 8: Civil Rights in the USA and South Africa first major leadership role, he organized a boycott of Montgomery busses in order to bank-\nrupt the public bussing system; the boycott continued for about a year, when the Supreme\nCourt intervened, ordering the city to desegregate bussing. The city complied, and the\nmovement had won its first victory. King had taken Gandhi\u2019s tactics of nonviolent resistance\nand coupled them with Christian morality to create a new and powerful tool for resisting\nracism in America. The next year, he and his supporters formed the Southern Christian\nLeadership Conference (SCLC), an organization which provided support for direct action\ncampaigns.\nThe next major challenge for the movement came in Little Rock, Arkansas. The\nLittle Rock school board had decided to desegregate after Brown v. Board of Ed, unlike most\nof the South. In 1957, nine African American students enrolled in Little Rock High School,\nthe first Black students to ever do so. Arkansas governor Orval Faubus ordered the National\nGuard to prevent the Little Rock Nine from entering the school the first day of the term. A\nfederal judge intervened, allowing the nine students to attend, but they were again blocked,\nthis time by an angry mob of local White citizens. Finally, President Eisenhower intervened,\nsending federal troops to protect the Little Rock Nine as they attended classes. Despite the\nprotection, the abuse the teenagers suffered from White students was traumatic; only one of\nthe nine, Ernest Green, managed to graduate.\nSo great was the resistance to integration that Little Rock chose to close all its public\nschools rather than allow White and Black students to attend together. This \u201cLost Year\u201d was\nfinally ended by a federal court order in 1959, forcing the public schools to desegregate.\nAs an aside: The first major split in the movement came in 1960. King and the SCLC had been\ncollege students are famous as\nmoving slowly and carefully; some activists, especially younger ones, wanted to move faster\nactivists in social movements\nand rebellions throughout and with less top-down control, a common disagreement in social movements.

By the end of the spring, over 70,000 protesters had participated in sit-ins in\ndozens of towns in the South, and media coverage allowed the entire world to watch.\nThe Greensboro Sit-Ins had an influence far beyond the Woolworth lunch counter\nCivil Rights protesters\nat Woolworth\u2019s Sit-\nIn, Durham, NC, 10\nFebruary, 1960\n185 (which is now a civil rights memorial site). The NAACP and SLCL tried to bring the move-\nment under their control, but the students declined. Following the philosophy that \u201cstrong\npeople do not need strong leaders,\u201d the students instead established the Student Nonviolent\nCoordinating Committee (SNCC). This was a grassroots group dedicated to helping local\nactivists follow their own plans, rather than operate with a top-down philosophy, as the\nNAACP and SCLC did. This presented King and other leaders with a problem: if they were\nto continue leading the movement, they would have to satisfy the younger activists and\npush for more agitation and faster change; but that would bring a harsher reaction from\nWhite authorities, perhaps even violence. In the end, King shifted towards a more confron-\ntational stance in an attempt at retaining some unity in the movement.\nThe opportunity came in 1961, when the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE)\nlaunched the Freedom Rides. In the South, it was illegal for Whites and Blacks to ride\nbusses together or sit together in bus stations. Interracial groups, composed mainly of col-\nlege students, many from the North, planned to ride together to challenge segregationist\nlaws. In Alabama, one bus was firebombed, and the riders beaten by a White mob when\nthey fled the flaming vehicle. When CORE considered abandoning the protests as too dan-\ngerous, SNCC and SCLC stepped in to offer support. The rides continued and expanded\nthroughout the South. In many places, particularly Mississippi, riders were arrested for\ndaring to ride together and were thrown in prison. The Freedom Rides represented an in-\ntensification of the movement, with the SCLC shifting to more provocative actions.\nAll of this was causing problems for the Democratic Party in the United States. The\nExecutive Branch under Democratic President John F. Kennedy was tasked with desegregat-\ning the South, as the Supreme Court had ordered; but the South was controlled mainly by\nDemocrats. Although northern Democrats sympathized with the protestors, their southern\ncounterparts, called Dixiecrats, were segregationists. This caused a split in the Democratic\nParty, where the President could not enforce the law without angering much of his own\nparty. This was one reason why the government was so unwilling to enforce its own laws.\nAttorney General Robert F. Kennedy asked the movement for a \u201ccooling off\u201d period, but\nmovement leaders refused; they knew that only sustained pressure would bring change.\nThe next major campaign \u2013 and probably the most intense of the entire movement\n\u2013 came in Birmingham, Alabama in 1963. Local activists had failed to make headway in\nwhat was thought to be the most segregated city in America. King and the SCLC stepped\nin to help, launching huge protests composed mainly of young people. Local authorities\nresponded brutally. The Commissioner of Public Safety, Eugene \u201cBull\u201d Connor, ordered\npolice to use fire hoses and police dogs to attack protestors, assaulting and arresting thou-\nsands. King himself was quickly jailed in an attempt to break the protests.\nWhen a group of eight Alabama clergymen published an open letter in a local paper,\nasking King to stop the protests, King replied with one of the most eloquent and important\nstatements in US history, the Letter from a Birmingham Jail. In his open letter, MLK re-\nplied point-by-point to the clergymen\u2019s pleas, explaining why the protests were necessary\nand exposing the clergymen\u2019s apparent concern for safety as mere self-serving excuses to\ncontinue segregation.\nCivil Rights Protest\n186 Chapter 8: Civil Rights in the USA and South Africa The Birmingham campaign was the turning point in the movement and in American\nhistory as well, occurring as it did at the height of the Cold War. Via the expanding media\nof television, the entire world saw the nonviolent protestors being attacked simply for pur-\nsuing their civil rights \u2013 this in the \u201chome of the free.\u201d The USSR took full advantage of this,\nclaiming that the American capitalists were hypocrites and racists; why should Africans join\nthe US side in the Cold War, when White Americans abused Black people in their own\ncountry? It was a convincing argument, and America\u2019s allies were deeply concerned that it\nwas working.\nIt was Birmingham which finally convinced Kennedy that he had to act, even if it\nwould divide his own party. He planned to sign civil rights legislation to end segregation in\nthe South, but was assassinated before he could do so. It would fall to his vice president and\nsuccessor, Lyndon Johnson, to carry it out.\nKennedy did intervene in Birmingham, where Jim Crow laws were dismantled\nas a result of the protests. MLK and the movement continued, since segregation contin-\nued throughout the South. In August 1963, over 200,000 people attended the March on\nWashington for Jobs and Freedom. It was here that King gave his most famous address, \u201cI\nHave a Dream,\u201d in which he linked African American appeals for civil rights to the aspira-\ntions of the Founding Fathers. It was a positive, aspirational view of America which sought\nunity rather than division.\nThe movement finally achieved its first national victory since Brown v. Board of Ed\nwith the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. President Johnson fought hard against the\nDixiecrats to get Congress to pass the act, which prohibited segregation in America. When\nhe finally signed the act in July, legend claims that he told a Democratic aide, \u201cWe have lost\nthe South for a generation.\u201d It was to prove a prophetic statement.\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not end voting discrimination in the South, which\nwas one of the most egregious aspects of Jim Crow. The movement therefore continued,\neven as MLK was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize the same year. The next major campaign\nwas a series of marches from Selma, Alabama, to the capitol of Montgomery, to protest\nthe ongoing denial of voting rights for African Americans. Many of the protestors were\nbeaten by state police, and White mobs killed several of them. President Johnson sent\ntroops and federal agents to protect the marchers because the state government would not.\nThat summer, Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which removed all Jim Crow\nrestrictions on voting. This was the last major victory for the movement.\nThe next year, the movement began to splinter once again. Young African American\nradicals launched their own organizations, and their goals and methods were not the same\nas King\u2019s. Rallying around the cry of \u201cBlack Power,\u201d the new activists rejected collaboration\nwith Whites and sought more than just civil rights, but also political, economic, and social\npower. Perhaps most importantly, they rejected nonviolence as a necessity. Race riots were\nbreaking out across America; some White police brutalized Black citizens in retaliation for\nwhat they saw as a Black takeover of the country, and Black citizens were longer of a mind\nto accept it passively. The Watts Riots of August 1965 killed 34 people and injured a thou-\nsand. Other major riots broke out in Chicago and Detroit.\nThe Black Panthers were the most famous of the radical groups. Originally formed\nas armed neighborhood patrols to counter police abuse, the group also sponsored volunteer\nprograms to assist the poor. The group rejected King\u2019s nonviolence, and sometimes engaged\nin fights with the police, killing people on both sides. King denounced such tactics, claim-\ning that it stained the reputation of the movement and would slow social change. The Black\nPanthers believed that King was too moderate. Malcom X, spokesman for the Nation of\nIslam, felt the same way. Discouraged with the slow rate of change in America, he rejected\nthe civil rights movement and preached that Black people should not live with Whites. His\ndream was to create a separate homeland in America for African Americans; but that was\njust a step on the way to the end goal, which was the return of all African diaspora to the true\nhomeland of Africa (see Pan-Africanism in Chapter 9). Martin Luther King called Malcom\n187 X misguided, and Malcom called MLK a \u201cchump.\u201d Nevertheless, King\u2019s part of the movement\ncontinued with the December 1967 launch of the Poor People\u2019s Campaign, designed to lobby\nfor an end to poverty in America.\nThe FBI had been running a campaign of monitoring civil rights leaders from its very\nbeginnings. Edgar J. Hoover, head of the FBI, suspected King of having communist sympathies,\nespecially after King spoke out against the Vietnam war. The FBI even sent King anonymous\nletters encouraging him to commit suicide. The agency went even farther against the Black\nPanthers, whom they regarded as an existential threat to the country.\nMLK was assassinated in April 1968 by a White supremacist, and the civil rights move-\nment began to decline. One reason was that the movement had succeeded in eliminating Jim\nCrow laws in the South, and many people considered its goals accomplished, even though racism\nremained in many forms. Furthermore, radical organizations like the Black Panthers turned\nmany moderates away from the movement, and the urban riots disenchanted others. Finally, the\nFBI cracked down on the radicals, arresting many of them and even killing some of the leaders.\nMalcom X eventually rejected Nation of Islam as too radical, and was killed by some of their\nmembers in revenge. Both moderate and radical leaders were dying, and enthusiasm for the\nmovement was waning. Although the movement had no distinct end, most historians agree that\nit was mostly over by 1968.\nResults of the Civil Rights Movement\nWhat the movement accomplished, and failed to accomplish, have been hotly debated.\nClearly, the movement did force the government to enforce the constitution and the Supreme\nCourt\u2019s findings and eliminate Jim Crow laws. As a result, African Americans in the South seized\nthe franchise which the constitution granted them after the Civil War; it also allowed African\nAmericans to run for public office, which many successfully did. The movement also removed\nlegalized discrimination in hiring. None of this came without a price. At least 41 activists were\nkilled during the movement by police or White supremacists; another 74 are suspected to have\nbeen killed for their work. Add to that the thousands who were beaten or imprisoned, and it is\nclear that the movement paid a considerable price for victory.\nHowever, the movement failed to bring complete equality to African Americans, nor\ncould it have in such a short time. Racism and stereotyping still exist, often with deadly conse-\nquences when it comes to policing. African Americans are incarcerated at a rate five times great-\ner than White Americans, destroying their chances at economic mobility. Economic disparities\nare very difficult to overcome. Banks are often guilty of \u201credlining,\u201d or refusing to give mortgages\nto people living in areas which are mainly African American. This prevents home ownership,\na major factor in building intergenerational wealth. Informal hiring discrimination still exists.\nSchools are still largely segregated, not by laws, but by the fact that Blacks and Whites tend to\nlive in different neighborhoods due to old racist practices. That means that school districts will\nlean towards one race or the other, and predominantly African American schools tend to be\nunderfunded when compared with White ones.\nMartin Luther King shifted the movement after 1964 to address these disparities, but\ndied before he could make much headway. In any case, economic justice is a much more difficult\ntask than repealing unjust laws, and will probably take decades to accomplish, although a great\nmany activists are intent on succeeding. In that respect, the Civil Rights Movement was not only\npartially successful, but is also still ongoing.\nBesides eliminating the Jim Crow system in the South, the movement had another\nlasting effect on American society, although it was unintended. Republican presidential candi-\ndate Richard Nixon noticed the division in the Democratic Party and decided to leverage it,\njust as Johnson feared he would. Nixon approached the Dixiecrats and invited them to join the\nRepublican Party, promising that he would not pursue civil rights the way that Johnson did; this\nbecame known as the Southern Strategy. Angry with their own party, the Dixiecrats switched\n188 Chapter 8: Civil Rights in the USA and South Africa parties, handing the South to the Republicans and the presidency to Nixon in 1969. Nixon had little\nto do with civil rights, because the movement was largely defunct by then. When the federal courts\ninstituted a system of bussing children out of their school districts in order to eliminate de facto\nsegregation, Nixon did not oppose it, hoping instead to remove segregation as a public issue before\nthe next election. He would have won that election, too, were it not for the scandal of Watergate.\nSouth African Apartheid\nConcurrent with the civil rights movement in the United States was an even larger move-\nment in South Africa with essentially the same purpose.\nSouth Africa was unusual among African colonies in that it did not go through the normal\ndecolonization struggle so common after World War II. It was a British colony until 1910, when it\nbecame an independent nation. Unlike most of Africa, South Africa contained a significant White\npopulation of both Dutch and British descent (the Dutch were the original European settlers of\nSouth Africa). The temperate climate and good agricultural land of South Africa made the colony\nan attractive place for Europeans to emigrate. Their one concern was the people who already lived\nthere. As elsewhere in the imperial world, the Europeans stole the best agricultural lands from the\nindigenous people and forced them to live on marginal land. The Whites also enslaved the Black\nAfricans; when that practice ended in 1834, the White South Africans were unwilling to grant them\ntotal freedom in a case similar to the US after the Civil War. To maintain White supremacy, the White\ncolonists established laws to formalize the racial hierarchy. This African version of the American\nJim Crow laws, formally finalized in 1948, was called apartheid (\u201capartness\u201d in Afrikaans, the local\ndialect of Dutch). From 1948 to 1959, various laws were made to maintain the separation between\nraces and keep the White minority in power. These included:\n1. The establishment of Black \u201chomelands\u201d in South Africa. All Black people were forced\nto live in these \u201cBantustans,\u201d which were essentially giant ghettos for each tribe. Eighty\npercent of South Africa now belonged to White people, while the remainder \u2013 the worst\nagricultural lands \u2013 were given over to the indigenous. By the end of apartheid, more\nthan three and a half million people had been forcibly moved into the Bantustans. These\nhomelands not only removed Black Africans from the political life of the country, but also\nseparated the tribes from each other, to prevent them from forming a unified resistance.\nBlack Africans who were needed to work in the cities were required to live in \u201ctownships\u201d\noutside the city; Black people were not allowed to live in White cities. They were required\nto commute to work each day, showing their passports to cross the border between\ncommunities.\n2. Demanding that every citizen, by age 16, be classified as a particular race, with\nappropriate identification.\n3. Forbidding mixed-race marriages and even sexual relations between races.\n4. Establishing \u201cpass laws,\u201d requiring nonwhites to have government visas when traveling\noutside their homeland or township.\n5. Creating separate public facilities for Blacks and Whites, as Jim Crow did.\n6. Gave the White government authority to run schools in the Bantustans, to control\neducation.\n7. Outlawing communism and communist parties, and associating all anti-apartheid\nactivity with communism in order to eliminate that as well.\n189 Black suffrage was not even forbidden by the apartheid laws because it had never\nexisted in South Africa. Blacks could vote in elections in their Bantustan, but not in nation-\nal elections, since they were not considered full citizens. Although these laws were more\nfar-reaching than Jim Crow in the US, the purpose was the same: to prevent Black people\nfrom gaining the same rights as Whites.\nResistance to Apartheid\nNaturally, resistance to these laws began immediately. The most prominent resis-\ntance organizations at the start of apartheid were the African National Congress (ANC),\nthe South African Communist Party (SACP), and the South African Indian National\nCongress (SAINC, the party Gandhi had worked with in South Africa). Influenced by the\nSAINC, the new movement opted for nonviolent opposition. In 1950, this coalition or-\nganized a massive workers\u2019 strike against the Suppression of Communism Act \u2013 even the\nnon-communists knew that the law was meant to suppress all anti-apartheid groups, not\njust communists. The government broke up the strikes with violence, killing 18 workers.\nThe same coalition launched an even larger protest movement which lasted the\nsecond half of 1952, called the \u201cCampaign of Defiance of Unjust Laws.\u201d Black workers in\nthe townships, when entering the White cities, would enter \u201cWhites only\u201d areas in a prelude\nto the American sit-ins; they would also burn their passbooks. While the workers protested,\nan ANC leader named Nelson Mandela rose to prominence within the movement by trav-\neling throughout the country, giving speeches inspiring people to rebel against apartheid.\nAgain, the government responded brutally, shooting protesters and arresting their leaders,\nincluding Mandela.\nThe Defiance Campaign caught the world\u2019s attention. A group of African and Asian\ncountries asked the United Nations to send a committee to South Africa to observe the\nsituation and report back to the General Assembly. The resolution was vetoed by the United\nStates. This was the beginning of a long and sometimes contentious US policy of supporting\nthe South African government. Although the US was uncomfortable with apartheid, partic-\nularly during the civil rights movement, the country was inclined to support South Africa.\nThe South African government was anti-communist, and the US considered it an ally in\npreventing communist insurgencies on the continent; furthermore, South Africa sold the\nUS certain minerals necessary for steel production but not commonly found in the United\nStates, and the US did not want to lose access to them by embargoing the country.\nIn 1955, several groups involved in the movement decided to create a unified\numbrella group to set forth the movement\u2019s demands and coordinate its activities. They\nformed the Congress Alliance (CA), with the ANC as the leading organization. At its first\nmeeting \u2013 before police interrupted the proceedings \u2013 the organization signed the Freedom\nCharter, which claimed in its preamble: \u201cWe, the People of South Africa, declare for all our\ncountry and the world to know: that South Africa belongs to all who live in it, Black and\nWhite, and that no government can justly claim authority unless it is based on the will of all\nthe people\u2026\u201d The charter went on to demand democracy, human rights, labor rights, land\nreform, and nationalization of the nation\u2019s assets.\nThe fact that the charter accepted the equal rights of White people angered some\nparticipants who thought that South Africa should be governed by Black people only; these\npeople broke from the CA and formed the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), dedicated to\nBlack nationalism. And in 1956, the government arrested most of the CA leaders, including\nall those of the ANC. They were charged with treason, but their 5-year trial ended with an\nacquittal for all involved.\nA turning point in the movement came in March 1960 in the township of\n190 Chapter 8: Civil Rights in the USA and South Africa Sharpeville. A group from the PAC launched a nonviolent protest, and police responded\nwith violence, killing 67 people, and wounding another 180. This produced two important\noutcomes. First, it convinced many leaders of the movement, within the CA and without,\nthat nonviolent resistance alone would not undo apartheid; the state, they believed, was so\nracist that it could not be shamed into changing its policy. (Remember that Gandhi was\ndealing with the British, who had the option of leaving India and going home. White South\nAfricans were already home, and so would fight much harder.)\nThe second change was that the rest of the world, shocked at the government\u2019s brutality,\nbegan to view South Africa as a pariah state. A global movement against apartheid began to\nbuild; sports teams would not play in South Africa, academics refused to hold conferences\nthere, and musicians refused to play there. The United Nations severed ties with South\nAfrica in 1962, overcoming American resistance. This pressure would only intensify as the\nyears went on.\nAfter Sharpeville, the South African government effectively banned anti-apartheid\nparties, including the ANC and the communist SACP, and arrested most of their leaders,\nimprisoning or executing them. Nelson Mandela toured Africa, speaking to enthusiastic\nnational leaders and garnering support for his cause. However, Black South Africans were\nnot permitted to travel without permission, and Mandela was arrested in 1963 when he\ntried to secretly re-enter South Africa. The ANC went into exile in Zambia, where it could\ncontinue operating. Also, the ANC and SACP cooperated in founding Umkhonto we Sizwe\n(MK, Spear of the Nation). This would serve as the military arm of the movement, and\nwould carry out sabotage and bombings in South Africa. Initially, this group was unwilling\nto cause civilian casualties, and aimed to destroy, for example, unoccupied government\nbuildings and electrical infrastructure. The association of the communists in the movement\nmeant that MK would receive considerable technical sup-\nport from the USSR \u2013 and earn it the disdain of the United\nStates.\nWith MK and other associated organizations such as\nPeople\u2019s Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) operating\nfrom just outside South Africa\u2019s borders, the South African\nDefence Force (SADF) began raiding into neighboring\n\u201cfront line\u201d countries to disrupt them. This regionalized the\nconflict, whether or not the neighboring countries wanted it\nthat way, and made the South African \u201cborder wars\u201d a proxy\nfor the Cold War, with Israel and the US supporting South\nAfrica, and the USSR supporting the rebels. MK, PLAN,\nand other groups attacked government targets in South\nAfrica, and the SADF would cross the borders into Angola,\nZambia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Botswana to strike\nback against their bases. They sometimes tangled with the\nlocal militaries in doing so, as well as kill local civilians and\ndestroy local infrastructure. The greatest of these proxy\nwars was the Angolan Civil War, fought between com-\nmunists and anticommunists starting in 1975. The US and\nSouth Africa supported the anticommunists, and the SADF\neven sent troops to aid them (to no avail). These border\nwars continued with none of the actors gaining a distinct\nadvantage.\nThe 1976 protests in Soweto, a Black township outside\nJohannesburg, increased tensions even further. The govern-\nment demanded that all Black students be taught Afrikaans,\nthe language of the apartheid government. Since\nMandela Voting in 1994\n191 language is a major marker of ethnic identity, the students naturally rebelled against this.\nAbout 20,000 Soweto students protested, and the police broke up the protests with bullets\nand tear gas, killing hundreds.\nThe protests convinced many South African Black youths that they would never\nhave peace under apartheid, and the international community, astonished by the govern-\nment\u2019s brutality, agreed with them. Thousands of youths left the country and joined the MK\nor other militant organizations. This in turn led to a surge in militant attacks. Students also\nformed the Black Consciousness Movement, based on the Black Power movement in the\nUnited States. The point of the movement was to remove the stigmas and inferiority com-\nplexes instilled by the Apartheid government. The leader of the movement, Steven Biko,\nwas arrested in 1977 and beaten to death in police custody.\nThe intensification made the 1980s the most intense time in apartheid South Africa.\nP.W. Botha, 1962\nThe movement\u2019s objective was to make the nation ungovernable through protests, strikes,\nkillings of pro-apartheid leaders, and militant attacks. Violence and nonviolence were to\nwork together towards the same goal, which was, according to Mandela, to crush apartheid\n\u201cbetween the anvil of united mass action and the hammer of the armed struggle.\u201d\nThe White majority had no intention of relinquishing power at that point. The elec-\ntion of P. W. Botha, a White supremacist and anti-communist, as prime minister in 1978\nportended difficult times ahead. In 1985, Botha proclaimed a state of emergency across\nmost of the country, giving him sweeping autocratic powers. Tens of thousands of people\nwere arrested and imprisoned without trial, and tens of thousands more were whipped as\npunishment for resistance. Curfews were imposed and the media was censored. Thousands\nof Black activists were murdered by government paramilitaries, and the government even\nkilled South African activists who had fled to the UK, sending agents to murder them in\nLondon.\nTo maintain apartheid and White minority rule, Botha and his ministers developed\na plan called \u201cTotal Strategy,\u201d which focused all aspects of national life on security. Young\nmen received military training while still in school, and were required to serve two years in\nthe military afterwards. Military spending ballooned to 20% of the national budget. Attacks\non militant bases in neighboring countries increased. But resistance to apartheid also in-\ncreased; a new organization, the United Democratic Front (UDF), united hundreds of\ncivil groups under the motto of \u201cUDF Unites, Apartheid Divides.\u201d This group coordinated\nmultiracial, nonviolent actions such as massive workers\u2019 strikes, demonstrations, and rent\nstrikes.\nThe United States under President Ronald Reagan, as well as Margaret Thatcher\u2019s\nUnited Kingdom, both supported the apartheid government in the interests of prevent-\ning communism from taking root in Africa. Both countries declared the ANC a terrorist\ngroup, forbidding their citizens from giving it material support. This created tension in\nthe two countries, as their citizens viewed their governments as supporters of apartheid.\nIn the United States, Rep. Ronald Dellums (D-CA) introduced legislation to embar-\ngo South Africa until apartheid was ended. Reagan vetoed the legislation, and the US\nSenate and Congress overrode the veto in a rare rebuke of Reagan\u2019s policy. The resulting\nComprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act (CAAA) severely damaged the South African econo-\nmy at a time when it was already reeling from strikes.\nIt was during the 1980s that international opposition to apartheid reached its peak.\nSports teams and cultural organizations refused to have anything to do with South Africa;\ninternational banks refused to do business with the nation; ninety American corporations\nwould not trade with South Africa; and citizen worldwide pledged not to buy South African\nconsumer products. The nation had become almost completely ostracized.\nBotha responded by trying to defuse the situation. He offered to allow Indians and\nmixed-race people to vote in national elections. Then he abolished the pass laws and the\nrestriction on interracial marriage. None of these efforts dissuaded the opposition, who by\n192 Chapter 8: Civil Rights in the USA and South Africa this point would settle for nothing short of full equality. He even offered to release Nelson\nMandela, who had been on Robben Island (a notorious prison) since 1964, if Mandela\nwould disavow violence and go into internal exile in his Bantustan. Mandela declined the\noffer. Botha paid a price for these overtures: extremists in his own government chided him\nfor giving in to Black activists, and some even threatened civil war rather than dismantle\napartheid.\nIn 1989, Botha suffered a stroke, and resigned to make way for F.W. de Klerk. De\nKlerk was a conservative from the same apartheid National Party (NP), but he understood\nthat apartheid was preventing South Africa from participating in the community of na-\ntions. He decided to work out a negotiated settlement with the ANC to deconstruct apart-\nheid without allowing the Black nationalist radicals to take power. To begin negotiations, de\nKlerk eliminated some apartheid laws and unbanned the SACP, ANC, and PAC, allowing\nexiled leaders to return to South Africa. He also released Nelson Mandela from prison after\n27 years.\nThe ANC was regarded to be the main negotiating party for the anti-apartheid\nside, and Mandela was its chief negotiator. The government\u2019s main stipulation for talks was\nthat the ANC and MK cease all militant attacks. Although Mandela had to work hard to\nconvince his party to do so, they agreed; the government lifted the state of emergency and\ncommitted to talks regarding a new non-racial constitution and Black suffrage in the next\nelections.\nThe negotiations were fraught, as extremist groups on both sides tried to sabotage\nthe talks by attacking police or anti-apartheid activists. The talks broke down at one point\nover this violence, but then were restarted. After three years, the two sides agreed to create\nan interim constitution, under which it would hold multi-party elections with universal\nsuffrage in 1994. The provisional constitution would be made permanent in 1996. For their\nefforts, de Klerk and Mandela shared the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize.\nIn April 1994, the historic elections were held, and the ANC won the majority of\nvotes, making it the leading party in South Africa, and Nelson Mandela was elected presi-\ndent. With a new constitution and universal suffrage in place in South Africa, the apartheid\nera was over.\nResults of the Anti-Apartheid Movement\nThe movement succeeded in pressuring the government to remove all apartheid\nlaws from the books, disbanding the Bantustans and townships, and allowing for Black\nsuffrage in South Africa, bringing true democracy to the nation. At least 600 activists had\nbeen killed by police and security forces, and fighting between different movement parties \u2013\nmainly the Black nationalists and the ANC \u2013 killed thousands more. Tens of thousands had\nbeen imprisoned and physically abused.\nWhile the movement did succeed in ending apartheid, it did not succeed in bring-\ning full equality to South Africa \u2013 something the movement leaders recognized and sought\nto address after the first election. Generations of legalized discrimination had created a so-\nciety in which only White people had significant wealth, and that continued after apartheid.\nToday, perhaps eighty percent of the land in South Africa is owned by the White minority,\nand Black South Africans are vastly more likely to live in poverty than Whites. This has led\nto serious crime in Black communities.\nWhen it gained political power in 1994, the ANC pursued a policy of strong state\nintervention in the economy, and affirmative action programs, to give Black Africans some\nopportunity for economic success. The ANC shifted from this policy in 1996 to one which\nwas more neoliberal, or capitalist, in outlook, drawing much criticism from leftist parties\nin South Africa. Still, the ANC\u2019s policies remained geared towards a mixed economy, in the\nhope of removing the racial wealth gap in their country.\n193 Comparing the Movements\nIt is natural, in retrospect, to compare the Civil Rights Movement in the United\nStates with the Anti-Apartheid Movement. The movements had a lot in common. The situ-\nations of legalized, institutionalized racial discrimination in both countries were the result\nof European attitudes during the Age of Exploration, hundreds of years before MLK and\nMandela. White supremacist ideas were already firmly in place when both the United States\nand South Africa were colonized, and those ideas carried over into the colonies\u2019 national\nphases. In South Africa, Black Africans were always suppressed, first by slavery and, after\nemancipation, by apartheid. In the United States, the situation was very similar, though\nthe Black Africans were first imported to America during the era of slavery. After the US\nCivil War, the South maintained its own form of apartheid (Jim Crow) to suppress African\nAmericans and keep the racial hierarchy in place.\nOne important difference between the two countries is that the American Jim Crow\nsystem existed only in the former Confederate states, not the entire country. The Northern\nstates did not have such laws, although racism certainly still existed there. Some Northern\nWhites sympathized with the Civil Rights movement and participated in it, particularly the\nFreedom Rides. The Jim Crow system, therefore, did not have unified White support in the\nUS.\nFurthermore, Jim Crow defied both the US Constitution and the Supreme Court,\nwhich ordered states to desegregate. The only reason that it existed was that the Executive\nBranch was loathe to enforce the law, until Cold War tensions exposed US hypocrisy and\nmade it necessary. The movement leaders could rightfully claim that they were merely de-\nmanding that the government faithfully execute American law, which sounded reasonable\nto Northern Whites.\nIn South Africa, however, apartheid was the law of the entire nation. Apartheid\nlaws did not violate any national laws, so appeals to justice could not be made on legal\ngrounds. There were White South Africans who fought against apartheid, but apartheid was\nnot simply a regional problem for South Africa; it was an existential problem for the entire\nnation, and the right-wing Nationalist Party was determined to fight on until it was clear\nthat it could not win. In the American South, the state governments could be restrained by\nthe federal government, and eventually were. The apartheid government, however, was the\nfederal government. Nothing but a unified resistance could fight it.\nBoth these factors meant that the situation in South Africa was much more fraught,\nmore extreme, than the one in the American South. With most Whites behind it, the South\nAfrican government deployed vastly more violence than the Southern states of the US\ncould. Furthermore, the apartheid laws were more restrictive than even Jim Crow, forcing\nBlack Africans into a hopeless situation; they could not move to another state to escape it.\nAnd that explains why the South African movement finally accepted violence as necessary.\nWhen the South African state demonstrated at Sharpeville that it was willing to kill even\nBlack children, Mandela and the ANC abandoned nonviolence, and not without careful\nconsideration. Committing violence made it easy for the state to portray the movement\nas terrorists and murders, which is one reason why Gandhi never used violence. Violence\nalso makes it harder to achieve peace. Historians have noted that nonviolent campaigns\nusually meet with more success, and with good reason. Not only can they claim the moral\nhigh ground, but they can also reconcile with their former enemies more easily; the enemy\nis much less likely to talk peace and reconciliation after you have killed their family and\nfriends.\n194 Chapter 8: Civil Rights in the USA and South Africa Mandela and the ANC nevertheless chose to turn to sabotage, and later arson, both very\nlimited forms of violence. As Mandela put it in his autobiography:\n\u201cNonviolent passive resistance is effective as long as your\nopposition adheres to the same rules as you do.\nBut if peaceful protest is met with violence, its efficacy is at an end.\nFor me, nonviolence was not a moral principle but a strategy;\nthere is no moral goodness in using an ineffective weapon.\u201d\n-Nelson Mandela\nIt should be noted that, for Gandhi, nonviolence was a moral principle, and he\nthought it effective as well. Mandela was not following Gandhi blindly. But the extreme\nnature of South African apartheid, when compared with Jim Crow, is the most important\nexplanation of why MLK maintained nonviolence while Mandela could not. The extreme\nviolence, and all-encompassing totalitarianism of the South African state, explain most of the\ndifferences between the movements.\nAside from their successful outcomes, one thing the two movements shared is that\nthey could not solve all their respective countries\u2019 racial problems, particularly the econom-\nic ones. Economic inequality based on race is very difficult to uproot without resorting to\nsocialism, even when laws forbidding racist hiring practices or redlining exist. And racism,\nwhich exists in people\u2019s minds, instead of in laws and legislation, is perhaps impossible to fully\nuproot. Therefore, a continuing problem in both the US and South Africa, and one which\nhas spawned new social movements, is to bring equal economic and social opportunity to its\nBlack citizens.\nSuggested Further Reading\nLong Walk to Freedom by Nelson Mandela (Little Brown Book Group, 2013.

We expressed understanding that honest\nconvictions in racial matters could properly be pursued in the courts, but urged that decisions of those courts\nshould in the meantime be peacefully obeyed.\nSince that time there had been some evidence of increased forbearance and a willingness to face facts.\nResponsible citizens have undertaken to work on various problems which cause racial friction and unrest. In\nBirmingham, recent public events have given indication that we all have opportunity for a new constructive\nand realistic approach to racial problems.\n198 Chapter 8: Civil Rights in the USA and South Africa However, we are now confronted by a series of demonstrations by some of our Negro citizens, directed and led\nin part by outsiders. We recognize the natural impatience of people who feel that their hopes are slow in being\nrealized. But we are convinced that these demonstrations are unwise and untimely.\nWe agree rather with certain local Negro leadership [opposed to MLK\u2019s tactics]which has called for honest\nand open negotiation of racial issues in our area. And we believe this kind of facing of issues can best be\naccomplished by citizens of our own metropolitan area, white and Negro, meeting with their knowledge and\nexperience of the local situation. All of us need to face that responsibility and find proper channels for its\naccomplishment.\nJust as we formerly pointed out that \u201chatred and violence have no sanction in our religious and political\ntraditions,\u201d we also point out that such actions as incite to hatred and violence, however technically peaceful\nthose actions may be, have not contributed to the resolution of our local problems. We do not believe that these\ndays of new hope are days when extreme measures are justified in Birmingham.\nWe commend the community as a whole, and the local news media and law enforcement officials in particular,\non the calm manner in which these demonstrations have been handled. We urge the public to continue to show\nrestraint should the demonstrations continue, and the law enforcement officials to remain calm and continue to\nprotect our city from violence.\nWe further strongly urge our own Negro community to withdraw support from these demonstrations, and\nto unite locally in working peacefully for a better Birmingham. When rights are consistently denied, a cause\nshould be pressed in the courts and in negotiations among local leaders, and not in the streets. We appeal to\nboth our white and Negro citizenry to observe the principles of law and order and common sense.\nApril 12, 1963\nThe Freedom Charter,\nAdopted at the Congress of the People, Kliptown, on 26 June 1955.\nWe, the People of South Africa, declare for all our country and the world to know:\nthat South Africa belongs to all who live in it, black and white, and that no government can justly claim\nauthority unless it is based on the will of all the people;\nthat our people have been robbed of their birthright to land, liberty and peace by a form of government\nfounded on injustice and inequality;\nthat our country will never be prosperous or free until all our people live in brotherhood, enjoying equal rights\nand opportunities;\nthat only a democratic state, based on the will of all the people, can secure to all their birthright without\ndistinction of colour, race, sex or belief;\nAnd therefore, we, the people of South Africa, black and white together equals, countrymen and brothers adopt\nthis Freedom Charter;\nAnd we pledge ourselves to strive together, sparing neither strength nor courage, until the democratic changes\nhere set out have been won.\n199 The People Shall Govern!\nEvery man and woman shall have the right to vote for and to stand as a candidate for all bodies which make\nlaws;\nAll people shall be entitled to take part in the administration of the country;\nThe rights of the people shall be the same, regardless of race, colour or sex;\nAll bodies of minority rule, advisory boards, councils and authorities shall be replaced by democratic organs of\nself-government .\nAll National Groups Shall have Equal Rights!\nThere shall be equal status in the bodies of state, in the courts and in the schools for all national groups and\nraces;\nAll people shall have equal right to use their own languages, and to develop their own folk culture and customs;\nAll national groups shall be protected by law against insults to their race and national pride;\nThe preaching and practice of national, race or colour discrimination and contempt shall be a punishable\ncrime;\nAll apartheid laws and practices shall be set aside.\nThe People Shall Share in the Country\u2019s Wealth!\nThe national wealth of our country, the heritage of South Africans, shall be restored to the people;\nThe mineral wealth beneath the soil, the Banks and monopoly industry shall be transferred to the ownership of\nthe people as a whole;\nAll other industry and trade shall be controlled to assist the wellbeing of the people;\nAll people shall have equal rights to trade where they choose, to manufacture and to enter all trades, crafts and\nprofessions.\nThe Land Shall be Shared Among Those Who Work It!\nRestrictions of land ownership on a racial basis shall be ended, and all the land re-divided amongst those who\nwork it to banish famine and land hunger;\nThe state shall help the peasants with implements, seed, tractors and dams to save the soil and assist the tillers;\nFreedom of movement shall be guaranteed to all who work on the land;\nAll shall have the right to occupy land wherever they choose;\nPeople shall not be robbed of their cattle, and forced labour and farm prisons shall be abolished.\nAll Shall be Equal Before the Law!\n200 Chapter 8: Civil Rights in the USA and South Africa No-one shall be imprisoned, deported or restricted without a fair trial;

I was born in Mthatha, 46 years ago.\nMy guardian was my cousin, who was the acting paramount chief of Tembuland, and I am related both to the\npresent paramount chief of Tembuland, Sabata Dalindyebo, and to Kaizer Matanzima, the chief minister of the\nTranskei.\nAs I understand the state case... the suggestion is that Umkhonto was the inspiration of the Communist Party\nwhich sought by playing upon imaginary grievances to enrol the African people into an army which ostensibly\nwas to fight for African freedom, but in reality was fighting for a communist state...\nNothing could be further from the truth. In fact the suggestion is preposterous. Umkhonto was formed by\nAfricans to further their struggle for freedom in their own land.\nOur fight is against real, and not imaginary, hardships or, to use the language of the state prosecutor, so-called\nhardships. Basically, we fight against two features which are the hallmarks of African life in South Africa and\nwhich are entrenched by legislation which we seek to have repealed.\nThese features are poverty and lack of human dignity, and we do not need communists or so-called agitators to\nteach us about these things.\nSouth Africa is the richest country in Africa, and could be one of the richest countries in the world. But it is a\nland of extremes and remarkable contrasts. The whites enjoy what may well be the highest standard of living in\nthe world, whilst Africans live in poverty and misery.\nPoverty goes hand in hand with malnutrition and disease. The incidence of malnutrition and deficiency\ndiseases is very high amongst Africans. Tuberculosis, pellagra, kwashiorkor, gastro-enteritis, and scurvy bring\ndeath and destruction of health. The incidence of infant mortality is one of the highest in the world.\nThe complaint of Africans, however, is not only that they are poor and the whites are rich, but that the laws\nwhich are made by the whites are designed to preserve this situation.\nThere are two ways to break out of poverty. The first is by formal education, and the second is by the worker\nacquiring a greater skill at his work and thus higher wages. As far as Africans are concerned, both these avenues\nof advancement are deliberately curtailed by legislation...\nThe present government has always sought to hamper Africans in their search for education. One of their early\nacts, after coming into power, was to stop subsidies for African school feeding. Many African children who\nattended schools depended on this supplement to their diet. This was a cruel act.\nThere is compulsory education for all white children at virtually no cost to their parents, be they rich or poor.\nSimilar facilities are not provided for the African children, though there are some who receive such assistance.\nThe other main obstacle to the economic advancement of the African is the industrial colour-bar under which\nall the better jobs of industry are reserved for whites only.\nThe lack of human dignity experienced by Africans is the direct result of the policy of white supremacy. White\nsupremacy implies black inferiority. Legislation designed to preserve white supremacy entrenches this notion.\nMenial tasks in South Africa are invariably performed by Africans. When anything has to be carried or cleaned\n203 the white man will look around for an African to do it for him, whether the African is employed by him or not.\nBecause of this sort of attitude, whites tend to regard Africans as a separate breed.\nThey do not look upon them as people with families of their own; they do not realise that they have emotions\n- that they fall in love like white people do; that they want to be with their wives and children like white people\nwant to be with theirs; that they want to earn enough money to support their families properly, to feed and\nclothe them and send them to school. And what \u201chouse-boy\u201d or \u201cgarden-boy\u201d or labourer can ever hope to do\nthis?\nPass laws, which to the Africans are among the most hated bits of legislation in South Africa, render any African\nliable to police surveillance at any time. I doubt whether there is a single African male in South Africa who has\nnot at some stage had a brush with the police over his pass.\nHundreds and thousands of Africans are thrown into jail each year under pass laws. Even worse than this is the\nfact that pass laws keep husband and wife apart and lead to the breakdown of family life...\nPoverty and the breakdown of family life have secondary effects. Children wander about the streets of the\ntownships because they have no schools to go to, or no money to enable them to go to school, or no parents at\nhome to see that they go to school, because both parents (if there be two) have to work to keep the family alive.\nThis leads to a breakdown in moral standards, to an alarming rise in illegitimacy, and to growing violence\nwhich erupts not only politically, but everywhere. Life in the townships is dangerous.\nThere is not a day that goes by without somebody being stabbed or assaulted. And violence is carried out of the\ntownships in the white living areas. People are afraid to walk alone in the streets after dark.\nAfricans want to be paid a living wage. Africans want to perform work which they are capable of doing, and\nnot work which the government declares them to be capable of. Africans want to be allowed to live where they\nobtain work, and not be endorsed out of an area because they were not born there.\nAfricans want to be allowed to own land in places where they work, and not to be obliged to live in rented\nhouses which they can never call their own. Africans want to be part of the general population, and not\nconfined to living in their own ghettos.\nAfrican men want to have their wives and children to live with them where they work, and not be forced\ninto an unnatural existence in men\u2019s hostels. African women want to be with their men folk and not be left\npermanently widowed in the Reserves.\nAfricans want to be allowed out after 11 o\u2019clock at night and not to be confined to their rooms like little\nchildren. Africans want to be allowed to travel in their own country and to seek work where they want to and\nnot where the Labour Bureau tells them to.\nAfricans want a just share in the whole of South Africa; they want security and a stake in society.\nAbove all, we want equal political rights, because without them our disabilities will be permanent. I know this\nsounds revolutionary to the whites in this country, because the majority of voters will be Africans. This makes\nthe white man fear democracy...\nBut this fear cannot be allowed to stand in the way of the only solution which will guarantee racial harmony\n204 Chapter 8: Civil Rights in the USA and South Africa and freedom for all. It is not true that the enfranchisement of all will result in racial domination.\nPolitical division, based on colour, is entirely artificial and, when it disappears, so will the domination of one\ncolour group by another.\nThe ANC has spent half a century fighting against racialism. When it triumphs it will not change that policy.\nThis then is what the ANC is fighting. Their struggle is a truly national one. It is a struggle of the African\npeople, inspired by their own suffering and their own experience. It is a struggle for the right to live.\nDuring my lifetime I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people. I have fought against white\ndomination, and I have fought against black domination.\nI have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and\nwith equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for\nwhich I am prepared to die.\nImage Credits\n\u201cAn apartheid sign in South Africa,\u201d \u201cMartin Luther King, Jr.,\u201d \u201cCivil Rights protesters at Woolworth\u2019s Sit-In,\u201d\n\u201cMandela Voting in 1994,\u201d and \u201cP.W.

The Europeans used this term because they\nPhoto by the United Nations.\nbelieved the interior of the continent was unexplored. To be sure, the Sahara\nDesert presented a daunting obstacle to communication and travel between the\nMediterranean world and the kingdoms and tribes to its south, but trade routes\ncrossed the desert, plied by expert nomadic guides since the days of the Roman\nEmpire. In the 15th Century, Portuguese navigators charted the West coast of the\ncontinent, and Bartolomeu Dias rounded the Cape of Good Hope in 1488, opening\na sea route to India. The Europeans certainly understood the African slave trade well\nenough. By tapping into the existing trade, and encouraging its practice among the\nlocal chieftains, Europeans found the cheap manpower they needed to exploit the\nriches of the New World.\nWhen the British outlawed the slave trade in 1807, Europeans had little\nuse for Sub-Saharan Africa. They had captured colonies in North Africa, such as\nMorocco and Algeria, which is no more than the Romans had done; the coastal\nclimate suited them, and coastal North Africa also has excellent agricultural lands.\nBut, although they knew the coasts of Sub-Saharan Africa, they were prevented\nfrom colonizing it by a tiny but implacable enemy: malaria. Malaria is passed\nfrom mosquito to human, and, fortunately, not transmissible between humans.\n206 Chapter 9: Africa Malaria-carrying mosquitos thrive in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Europeans had no genetic\nimmunity to the disease, as Africans had.\nWith the development of quinine pills in the mid-19th Century, Europeans\ncould protect themselves from malaria, allowing them to safely travel into the continent.\nFurthermore, the industrial revolution was underway, meaning that Europeans needed\nthe resources of the region for their factories, as well as new markets for their goods. At the\n1884 Berlin Conference, European leaders divided Africa between them, to prevent them\nfrom fighting each other for the spoils of the continent. After that, the Europeans conquered\nthe entire continent, except for Liberia, allied with the United States, and Ethiopia, which\nresisted an Italian conquest and remained independent.\nThe conquest of Africa was extremely disruptive of African culture. The Europeans\nseized the best agricultural lands, leaving the less-productive land to the Africans, thus\nimpoverishing them. Colonial economies were established to exploit the natural resources of\nAfrica, using Africans as cheap labor, mid-level administrators, or substitute local leaders, but\nnever empowering them as real decision-makers. Numerous laws established and enforced a\nsystem of racial hierarchy of White over Black, enforced by local police. While some Africans\nwere able to leverage this system through collaboration, gaining a higher social status\nthan they were born into, most Africans found their lot in life worse than it was before the\nEuropean conquest. As a result, colonial Africa saw at least 25 revolts against White rule prior\nto World War I, none of them successful.\nAs we saw in Chapter 4, World War II changed the calculus of imperialism. Western\nEuropean nations were impoverished by the world wars and focused on rebuilding; they had\nlittle money to spare for policing their colonies, and anyway the Bretton Woods Agreement\nremoved some of the economic impetus for imperialism. The colonized peoples saw their\nopportunity, especially since the UN, the US, and the USSR were all anti-imperial. The first\nthree decades after World War II witnessed the birth of 50 new nations in Africa, each with\nits own local drama, some peaceful, some exceedingly bloody.\nImperial Approaches to Independence\nAfter the war, the European imperial powers initially hoped to use their colonies\nto pay for reconstruction; the plan was to not only retain control of the colonies, but to\nactually expand their extractive industries, producing more raw materials for international\nsale and increasing profits.\nThis brought a strong backlash from the Africans. For one thing, about 374,000\nAfricans had served in the British military in World War II, with another 400,000 serving\nwith the French. These soldiers had a new sense of pride and confidence, having helped save\ntheir imperial masters from fascism. They returned home to unemployment and repression,\nleading to an unsurprising backlash - \u2013 and the first postwar resistance to White rule began\nwith riots in the British colony of Gold Coast (Ghana) in February 1948.\nRealizing how expensive it would be to constantly repress the colony, and that it\nstill needed the financial support of the anti-imperialist US, the UK attempted to placate the\nopposition. They allowed Africans to elect representatives to a parliamentary government\nwhich would exercise a certain amount of self-rule, though not over defense or foreign re-\nlations. The British were disappointed when Kwame Nkrumha\u2019s pro-independence party,\nthe Convention People\u2019s Party, won the elections and agitated for the end of White rule. The\nBritish realized that their imperial cause was lost, and began the process of granting Ghana\nfull independence, which it received in 1957. That was the beginning of decolonization in\nAfrica.\n207 The imperial powers improvised their responses to African nationalist movements.\nWhile the Europeans knew what they wanted \u2013 the wealth of the colonies, as well as to keep\nthe Soviets out of Africa -- they didn\u2019t know how to get them. The British and French at first\nKwame Nkrumha\ntried to accommodate the nationalists, granting the colonies limited self-rule so long as it\ndidn\u2019t interfere with economic control. The nationalists didn\u2019t fall for it; across Africa, both\nnorth and south of the Sahara, Africans demanded complete independence. The British\nsubsequently decided to grant independence, since they guessed (correctly) that the new\ninternational trade standards of Bretton Woods would still grant them access to African\nresources. The French, however, needed to restore their national pride, which had been\ndamaged by their loss to the Germans during the war. And the best way to do that, they\ndecided, was to fight for their colonies. The hardest fight would be in Algeria.\nAlgeria\nAlgeria was the most consequential anti-imperial battle in postwar Africa. France\nwrested the country from the Ottoman Empire in 1830, while also suppressing local nation-\nalists. Algeria was one of only three colonies in Africa which saw large-scale European im-\nmigration, the others being South Africa and Rhodesia. As with South Africa, the Algerian\ncoast attracted Europeans with its moderate Mediterranean climate. French citizens in\nAlgeria, known as colons (colonists) or, later, as pied-noir (black feet), seized the best ag-\nricultural lands from the indigenous and established themselves as an elite ruling class. By\n1962, about a million and a half colons lived in Algeria, constituting about fifteen percent of\nthe national population.\nAnother salient point of French Algeria is that, legally, it was considered an integral\npart of France. Unlike other colonies, Algeria was considered as inviolable as Normandy or\nProvence, and France could no more abandon it than it could French provinces. These two\nfactors \u2013 the large European population and the legal status of the colony \u2013 made it very dif-\nficult for France to justify granting Algeria its independence. Add to that the fact that France\nwas even more willing to fight for its last major colony after the loss of Indochina, and it is\nunsurprising that France would fight as hard as it did to retain Algeria. What French leaders\ndid not know was just how high the price would be, and that the conflict would reach into\nthe heart of France itself.\nFLN troops in Algeria.\nImage by Zdravko Pe\u010dar, Museum of\nAfrican Art at Belgrade.\n208 Chapter 9: Africa Algerian nationalist movements had flared all during the 122-year occupation.\nIn October 1954, experienced anti-imperialists formed a new organization: the Front de\nLiberation Nationale (FLN, National Liberation Front). The FLN\u2019s leaders proclaimed they\nsought independence for Algeria and a government of social democracy, based on Islamic\nvalues and citizenship for all Algerians of both native and European ancestry. Over the next\ntwo years, the FLN carried out attacks across Algeria, threatening to overrun colonial cities.\nThe new French prime minister, Guy Mollet, promised to quash the revolt and sent half a\nmillion troops to Algeria. Furthermore, France decided to grant independence to its two\nother North African colonies, Morocco and Tunisia; since they were not considered part\nof France, the French government could afford to give them up. It only meant that France\nhad more assets to use in maintaining control over Algeria. To keep the two newly-inde-\npendent countries from assisting their fellow Muslims in Algeria, the French also erected\nlong border fortifications, including electric fences, along the Algerian borders to isolate the\ncolony. FLN leaders decided to fly to Tunisia to discuss their plans; the French, alerted to\nthe flight, intercepted the plane and forced it to land in the Algerian capital of Algiers. The\nFrench arrested the leaders, who spent the rest of the war in jail. This did not dissuade the\nFLN, who found new leaders and intensified their fight.\nIn 1956 and 1957, the FLN fought a campaign in Algiers itself, using assassination\nand bombings to terrorize the Europeans and their Algerian sympathizers. The French re-\nsponded in kind, arresting anyone suspected of sympathizing with the FLN, and torturing\nand even murdering them. While this did stop the FLN campaign, driving the rebels into\nthe countryside, it also had the effect of angering many Muslims. Once-loyal Algerians were\nshocked at the French depredations that killed as many innocent people as rebels. Many\nMuslims joined the FLN after that.\nIn 1958, a new crisis emerged as European Algerians, fearing that the French\ngovernment would abandon them by granting Algeria its independence, demanded that\nCharles de Gaulle be appointed Prime Minister of France. De Gaulle had been leader of\nthe Free French Forces in World War II (see Chapter 1). A conservative and an imperial-\nist, he was also a war hero, and the French Algerians viewed him as a champion of their\ncause. The French military \u2013 both veterans of WWII and serving officers \u2013 were typically\npro-imperialism and pro- de Gaulle. The political tensions in France had grown so intense\nover the Algerian issue that high-ranking French military officers planned a mutiny and\ninsurrection if de Gaulle not was made prime minister.\nOn June 1, 1958, the National Assembly did appoint de Gaulle the prime minister.\nDe Gaulle then oversaw the establishment of a new constitution, the passage of which cre-\nated the Fifth Republic in France. The pied-noir and the French conservatives, including\nmost of the military, were about to be sorely disappointed. In 1959, de Gaulle \u2013 probably\nrealizing that the era of imperialism had passed \u2013 stated that the Algerians had a right to\nself-determination. This brought resentment and violence from European Algerians, who\nattacked Muslim Algerians in a campaign of murder and terror.\nThe battle came to France, where Algerians, both pro- and anti-independence, lived\nas immigrants. Algerians of both sides attacked each other, bombing the cafes they tended\nto frequent in a campaign known as the Caf\u00e9 Wars. Furthermore, a group of disgruntled\nFrench conservatives who opposed Algerian independence formed a terrorist group called\nthe Organisation Arm\u00e9e Secr\u00e8te (OAS, \u201cSecret Armed Organization\u201d). This group com-\nmitted bombings and assassinations in France to dissuade the government from abandon-\ning Algeria. The group also tried to assassinate Charles de Gaulle and philosopher Jean-Paul\nSartre (who supported the FLN); both attempts were unsuccessful.\nFinally, de Gaulle managed to persuade all sides to accept a peace treaty, pending a\nreferendum in Algeria regarding independence. In July 1962, Algerians voted overwhelm-\ningly for independence. The Algerian War for Independence had cost the lives of over\n209 100,000 Algerian rebels and 10,000 French soldiers; hundreds of thousands of civilians on\nboth sides were killed and tortured. Furthermore, the majority of French Algerians, fearing\nreprisals, fled the country for France, along with thousands of native Algerians who had\nsupported them.\nThe war not only granted Algeria its independence; it also served as an example for\nother African colonies, who now considered violent revolution a viable tool in decoloniza-\ntion, should more peaceful methods fail. The British were well-aware of this new attitude\nand careful to avoid going down the French route.\nPan-Africanism\nKwame Nkrumha, the new Prime Minister of Ghana, had another role to play\nbeyond being the first leader of a decolonized African nation. Nkrumha was the foremost\nAfrican proponent of Pan-Africanism. Pan-Africanism is the concept that people of\nAfrican descent, no matter where they live, are linked by cultural and spiritual bonds and\nshare a brotherhood despite living in different countries. The idea actually came from the\nAmericas; W.E.B. DuBois and Marcus Garvey were early proponents of this idea. Nkrumha\nalso believed that Pan-Africanism was an anti-colonial idea. To him, it meant that all\nAfrican people should become politically unified; that the old boundaries established by the\nimperialists at the Berlin Conference should be dissolved, and that Africa should become a\nfederation of states, united by their cultural commonalities. Other African nationalist lead-\ners, such as Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya, also subscribed to this idea.\nNkrumha did what he could to advance Pan-Africanism. He sent advisors to assist\nother African nationalists in their anti-colonial struggles in the name of African unity. He\nalso established the short-lived Union of African States between Ghana, Guinea, and Mali;\nhe meant for this union to serve as a model for a future African federation.\nDespite its appeal, Pan-Africanism also had its detractors. Many nationalist leaders\nfighting for independence from Europeans were not keen to simply hand power over to\nother Africans via a continental federation. This philosophy may be been based on a true\ndesire for their people\u2019s independence, or perhaps a selfish desire to rule their new countries\nwithout outside interference. Furthermore, Nkrumha was a socialist, and some African na-\ntionalists feared he would turn a Pan-African union into a socialist state.\nNevertheless, Nkrumha\u2019s Pan-African political vision remained a major philosophy\nin Africa until 1963. That year, independent African states established the Organization of\nAfrican Unity (OAU), the predecessor to the African Union (AU). The OAU rejected the\nidea of a Pan-African political federation, asserting that the old European colonial bound-\naries must be maintained. It did promote cooperation between African nations to improve\ntheir economies and to resolve tensions between nations, but it did not go as far towards\npolitical union as Nkrumha advocated. The OAU was a nail in the coffin of Nkrumha\u2019s Pan-\nAfrican dream; Nkrumha himself was overthrown in a coup in 1966, ending his aspirations.\nWhile the concept of Pan-Africanism continues as a philosophy, it was never able to over-\npower the idea of nationalism and sovereignty in Africa.\nThe Cold War and African Decolonization\nGiven that the African continent underwent a massive political upheaval after\nWorld War II, it is unsurprising that the superpowers would both intervene, to some degree,\nto influence the process to their own benefit. Nor was it surprising that some African na-\ntionalists were interested in communism, since the imperial powers which had suppressed\nthem for so long were capitalist democracies \u2013 demonstrating, once again, that democracies\nare their own worst enemy.\n210 Chapter 9: Africa Nevertheless, the superpowers were not very concerned with Africa. The Soviets\nwere more concerned with influencing India and the Middle East, which would bring them\ngreater strategic benefits. The main exception was Somalia, where the USSR was able to\nuse the naval base at Berbera. The US was not very interested in Africa, either; it had few\neconomic or security concerns there, and thought it appropriate to let the imperial powers\nsuppress communists before they granted independence. Furthermore, African national-\nists were rarely ideologically-pure Marxists, preferring instead what they termed \u201cAfrican\nSocialism,\u201d a collection of socialist-inspired theories adapted to African culture. Moscow\nwas not particularly impressed or interested. The Africans were also unwilling to uncritical-\nly embrace the Soviets since, although they were busy trying to eject their capitalist rulers,\nthey were also unprepared to swap them for communist ones.\nAlthough Africa was not critical to the superpowers, they did sometimes find\nthemselves involved in regional decolonization. The foremost example was Angola.\nAngola\nPortugal probably doesn\u2019t come first to mind when one considers the great empires\nof history, being much smaller than the grand British and French empires; but Portugal cre-\nated the first European overseas empire in the Age of Exploration, starting with its African\ncolonies, established as it mapped the African coasts. The Portuguese colonized what is now\nAngola, the Cape Verde Islands, Mozambique, Guinea, and the islands of Sao Tome and\nPrincipe, exploiting the resources and the local slave trade.\nWhile Portugal\u2019s empire was relatively small, its government was initially unwilling\nto part with it after World War II. The semi-fascist government of Portugal, led by dictator\nAnt\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar, had a policy of autarky (economic autonomy in order to\nneutralize foreign embargoes; see Chapter 1 for other fascist nations with this policy). That\npolicy required Portugal to keep its colonies for access to their resources. Since Portugal\nwas not a democracy at the time, the government could largely ignore public opinion about\nthe ethics of imperialism. Nor did foreign pressure amount to much, since Portugal was\na valued member of NATO, with air and naval bases helping secure the Atlantic Ocean.\nAlliance members were unwilling to push Portugal too hard for the sake of its African colo-\nnies.\nIn 1961, anti-imperial groups in Angola, Guinea-Bissau, and Mozambique launched\narmed revolts against Portuguese rule; this became known collectively as the Portuguese\nColonial War, since the rebels in the various colonies supported each other. The worst\nspot in the conflict, and probably the most consequential, was Angola, the largest of the\nPortuguese colonies.\nThe three major rebel groups in Angola were the National Union for the Total\nIndependence of Angola (UNITA, a communist group supported by China), the Popular\nMovement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA, also communist, supported by the USSR\nand Cuba), and the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA, a nationalist group\nsupported by the US, South Africa, and several other nations). In response to the upris-\ning, Portugal mobilized its military (already on the alert since the Algerian Revolution)\nas well as local security forces and paramilitaries. The resulting 13-year Angolan War of\nIndependence cost the lives of thirteen thousand people. It only ended due to the 1974\nCarnation Revolution, a nearly-bloodless coup in Portugal. Angered by repression, large-\nscale conscription, and debilitating military expenditures in Africa, left-wing military offi-\ncers overthrew the Portuguese government and established democracy. One effect of this\nwas the Alvor Agreement, in which Portugal granted Angola its independence. Separate\nagreements were made with the other Portuguese colonies too, and Portuguese forces de-\nparted Africa, with hundreds of thousands of Europeans and their African collaborators\n211 fleeing the former colonies for fear of retribution.\nAngola\u2019s problems were just beginning. Because the three major Angolan rebel\ngroups differed ideologically (the communist groups didn\u2019t agree on policy, and each de-\nmanded total power), the country quickly devolved into the Angolan Civil War. The FNLA\nand UNITA decided to join forces against the MPLA despite their differences. Then, in\nOctober 1975, South African forces entered Angola to prevent an MPLA victory; South\nAfrica was already fighting against communist groups at home, and new a communist\ncountry on its borders would assist the insurgents. The MPLA then asked its own ally, Cuba,\nfor support, and Castro sent 12,000 Cuban troops to assist them. US President Gerald Ford\ninterpreted that as Soviet expansionism and asked Congress for more money to support\nthe FNLA-UNITA. Congress was unwilling to become too deeply involved in the region so\nsoon after the debacle in Vietnam; furthermore, Congress did not want to be seen as sup-\nporters of South Africa, an apartheid state. As a result, the MPLA and Cubans drove out the\nSouth Africans and took control of the country. The FNLA-UNITA coalition continued to\nresist sporadically until 2002. The war cost around 800,000 lives, with another four million\ndisplaced due to the fighting. The Republic of Angola is now a constitutional republic, and\nthe MPLA remains the strongest political party.\nThe Congo Crisis\nIn Chapter 4, we saw that the Congo Free State was probably the worst place in\ncolonial Africa, due to its being the private property of King Leopold of Belgium and free\nfrom any oversight. The Belgian government, after international outcry, took possession in\n1908 and renamed the colony the Belgian Congo. While the government relaxed the repres-\nsion to some degree, it still exploited the wealth of the colony and suppressed independence\nmovements. After World War II, the colony would become a Cold War hotspot, fought over\nby many different rebel factions, the Congolese government, United Nations troops, and\nhired mercenaries.\nThe two largest nationalist groups in the Congo were the Mouvement National\nCongolais (MNC), led by Patrice Lumumba, and the Alliance des Bakongo (ABAKO)\nled by Joseph Kasa-Vubu. The ABAKO was the more radical of the two, pushing for im-\nmediate independence rather than gradualism; it was also more focused on ethnicity and\nfederalism than the MNC. There were several smaller, provincial groups, and each party\nhad several splinter groups, creating a badly-fragmented political situation.\nUnder pressure from both the international community and Congolese national-\nists (who instigated widespread anticolonial rioting in 1959), the government of Belgium\ndecided to grant the colony its independence in June, 1960. Meetings between the Belgians\nPatrice Lumumba and major Congolese parties sought to settle political questions before that time, but left\nmany questions unresolved due to ideological differences. Nevertheless, the Republic of the\nCongo was established on June 30 1960. Lumumba was appointed the first president, and\nKasa-Vubu the prime minister. This created a divided government, and one which Belgium\ndid not appreciate; the Belgians disliked Lumumba, accusing him of communism. Since\nthe Belgians still wanted to exploit the wealth of the Congo despite its independence, they\nhoped for a weak, fragmented Congolese government that would be easier to manipulate.\nMost of the ten thousand Belgian administrators in Congo expected to maintain their posi-\ntions of power despite independence.\nThe trouble began immediately. One month after independence, Belgian Lieutenant-\nGeneral \u00c9mile Janssens, commander of the national military, declared that independence\nmeant nothing to the troops and that Black personnel would remain in low-ranking posi-\ntions under White officers. This provoked a nation-wide mutiny by disgruntled troops, who\nrioted, plundering Belgian property and killing White civilians. The Belgian government\n212 Chapter 9: Africa responded by sending troops to protect its citizens fleeing the attacks; the troops ended up\nin combat against Congolese forces.\nIn July, separatist forces in the mineral-rich province of Katanga declared Katanga\u2019s\nindependence from Congo, with Mo\u00efse Tshombe as its new leader. The Belgian govern-\nment sent military support to the breakaway province in the hopes of gaining access to the\nmineral wealth there. This was followed the next month by the secession of a portion of\nKasai province, another mineral-rich area.\nInternational pressure forced the UN to act. The UN sent a peacekeeping force into\nCongo to protect civilians, and also demanded that Belgian forces leave the country. The\nUN force was ordered not to get involved in the secession crises, considering them an in-\nternal affair. This disappointed Lumumba, who hoped the UN would assist him in bringing\nthe rebellious areas under control. He first asked for American assistance against the rebels;\nthe Eisenhower administration refused the request. Lumumba then turned to the USSR for\nhelp. The Soviet Union sent a thousand advisors who assisted Congolese forces in retaking\nthe breakaway Kasai region. The arrival of Soviet forces alarmed the US, and the CIA be-\nlieved that it represented an attempt to expand Soviet power into Africa.\nSoviet support also caused a fatal split in the Congolese government. Kasa-Vubu\nand Lumumba, bitterly at odds over the crisis and other issues, each tried to dismiss the\nother, leading to a divided government in the middle of the crisis.\nIn order to resolve the situation, the ambitious Army Chief of Staff, Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9\nMobutu, launched a military coup and appointed Kasa-Vubu the President, arresting\nLumumba. Mobutu exercised real control from behind the scenes. In December 1961,\nLumumba was turned over to Katangese forces loyal to Tshombe, tortured, and executed.\nMeanwhile, the UN peacekeeping forces found little peace to keep. A group of\nIrish UN peacekeepers were captured by Katangese forces, and the UN\u2019s attempts to disarm\nmercenary troops led to several firefights. When UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld\nflew to Congo to resolve the situation, his plane crashed, killing him. His UN successor,\nU Thant, took a much harder line towards Congo than the moderate Hammarskj\u00f6ld. He\npushed for the UN to authorize its forces to end Katangese secession, and in December\n1962, UN forces defeated the Katangese and ended the revolt.\nWith the rebellions over, the government tried to reconcile the various groups by\nwriting a new constitution granting more power to the provinces; Kasa-Vubu even made\nTshombe the new prime minister as an offering to the Katangese. The constitution also\nchanged the name of the country to the Democratic Republic of the Congo as a sign of\ntheir hopes. It was not enough to placate followers of Lumumba who, following a vague-\nly-Maoist ideology coupled with indigenous religion, launched the Simba Revolt in 1964.\nThe marauding rebels were finally suppressed by CIA-supported White mercenary troops,\nwho were also responsible for war crimes against civilians.\nKasa-Vubu\u2019s government again broke down in political infighting, and Mobutu\nagain launched a coup to break the impasse. This time, however, after declaring martial\nlaw, he established himself as dictator by turning the country into a one-party state and\nremoving any officials not personally loyal to him. Mobutu ran the nation from 1967 to\n1997, when he was finally ousted from power. Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu\n213 South Africa and Rhodesia\nAside from Algeria, two other colonies hosted large White populations: South\nAfrica and Rhodesia. South Africa had the same Mediterranean climate as Algeria, and\nRhodesia had encouraged European technicians and other specialists to immigrate in order\nto run the many mines in the mineral-rich country.\nGreat Britain granted South Africa its independence in 1910. The South African\nWhite population was descended from both British and Dutch settlers, but it was the\nAfrican Dutch, called Afrikaners, who dominated the government. South African Whites\nhad a long tradition of exploiting Black Africans as cheap labor in the gold and diamond\nmines. They also seized all the best agricultural lands, again using the indigenous people as\nlabor.\nThis economy required the Afrikaners to keep tight political and social control over\nBlack Africans. The system of racial segregation and domination was eventually codified\nand named apartheid (\u201capartness\u201d) in 1948. Apartheid was far more abusive than even\nthe Jim Crow laws in the Southern US. Black Africans were forced to live in states known as\nBantustans; they were not allowed to live in White cities. While Black Africans had some\npolitical autonomy in their own Bantustans, which were organized by tribe, they could\nnot vote in national elections and exercised no control over national policies. Nor could\nBantustans collaborate with each other, preventing African unity. Black Africans could not\nleave their Bantustans without a passport and visa. If Black South Africans needed to work\nin White cities, they could live in adjacent Black townships, which were as controlled as\nwere the Bantustans; they served as large-scale workers\u2019 barracks. Under apartheid, Black\nAfricans could not marry White people nor even use the same public facilities, like bus\nThe Black Township of Soweto. Townships essentially\nserved as segregated worker\u2019s barracks outside White\ncities and were notably poor. Image by the UN.\n214 Chapter 9: Africa stations, as Whites. This was racial segregation and control taken to the extreme.\nBritish decolonization did not involve South Africa, which was already an independent\nnation. The White population there had no intention of ending apartheid. As decolonization\nswept the continent, White South Africans viewed themselves as surrounded by nations hostile\nto their racist system, and dug in their heels to resist.\nThe White government of Rhodesia also felt besieged. While the British government\nexpected to help the colony transition to independence, it also had a policy of \u201cno independence\nbefore majority rule,\u201d meaning that Black Africans must be permitted to participate equally\nin politics. Rhodesia\u2019s White rulers balked at this. Instead, in November 1965, Prime Minister\nIan Smith of Rhodesia unilaterally declared Rhodesia an independent state to the applause of\nthe ruling White minority there. The British government condemned the move as treasonous,\nbut since the Whites of Rhodesia were of British descent, it was loathe to use military force to\nbring them back into the colonial fold. The UN was also appalled by the move, since it set up\na racist, minority-rule government in Rhodesia in contravention to the UN Charter. The UN\ninitiated an embargo of Rhodesia, but many countries (including the United States and South\nAfrica) ignored the embargo. But no country, even South Africa, recognized the legitimacy of\nthe Rhodesian government, so as not to antagonize the UK.\nBlack nationalists in Rhodesia realized that the Smith government would never consent\nto real democracy, and two groups, the Zimbabwe African People\u2019s Union (ZAPU) and the\nZimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) launched an insurgency. This quickly developed\ninto the Rhodesian Bush War, which became a Cold War proxy conflict. The USSR supported\none small communist group, and China supported another, and these two groups fought the\nRhodesian military separately and sometimes fought each other as well. South African troops\ncrossed the border to suppress the rebels, fearing that they would help the ANC and other an-\nti-apartheid parties. Although the US did not send troops to help Rhodesia, several hundred\nWhite Americans volunteered to join a mercenary group to fight for White minority rule.\nThe Bush War raged until 1980. By that point, the White population was tired of war;\nso many of them had fled the country that those remaining wondered why they were still fight-\ning. After a series of attempted compromises, Rhodesia agreed to hold democratic elections in\nFebruary 1980. ZANU won the election and its leader, Robert Mugabe, became prime minister.\nThe new Black-majority government renamed the country the Republic of Zimbabwe.\nWhite rule lasted longer in South Africa, though not by much. The African National\nCongress (ANC) and other Black nationalist groups demonstrated against the Afrikaner gov-\nernment, demanding an end to apartheid. Since some of these groups were communist, the\nUnited States supported South Africa, although the superpower looked on with increasing\nunease at South Africa\u2019s racist policies. The apartheid government was notably brutal in its sup-\npression of Black nationalism, which only brought internal dissent, international condemnation,\nand embargoes. Finally, after it was almost entirely isolated, the White government decided to\nnegotiate with Nelson Mandela, leader of the ANC, who had been in prison for over two de-\ncades. In 1994, South Africa held its first national elections with Black participation, and Nelson\nMandela became President of the Republic of South Africa.\nEthnic tensions\nAfrica is the most ethnically-diverse continent in the world, the Sub-Saharan nations\nparticularly so. There are more than three thousand ethnic groups in Africa, speaking over 2100\nlanguages. This diversity is often cited as a cause of African conflicts, with commentators refer-\nring to intrinsic ethnic hatred and ancient animosities between groups, suggesting that there is\nno answer to these intractable struggles. Such beliefs can translate into misguided and ineffective\n215 government policies.\nCareful historical analysis demonstrates that people do not fight strictly over ethnic differ-\nences. In Africa and elsewhere, people of different ethnicities live as neighbors, work together, share\nreligions, languages, and nationalities, and intermarry. The cause of ethnic conflict is not ethnic dif-\nferences, but political leaders who leverage differences for their own political gain. Blaming ethnic\nminorities for the nation\u2019s problems is an easy diversion, displacing responsibility onto scapegoats;\nit can also be used to manipulate people into attacking leaders\u2019 chosen enemies (consider the case of\nthe Nazis). In other situations, policies meant to buy the cooperation of one group may be detrimen-\ntal to other groups, causing animosity that is based more on injustice than ethnicity.\nOne of many examples may be found in Plateau State in Nigeria. Local governments in the\nstate are responsible for classifying all people as \u201cindigenous\u201d or \u201csettlers\u201d (based on whether they\nmoved there from other regions of the country). Settlers are not permitted to own land or hold\ncertain government positions. The Hausa-speaking Muslims are usually classified as settlers, even\nthough their families have lived in Plateau State for generations. This cuts them off from economic\nopportunities and incites hatred and inter-ethnic violence.\nGhana is another example. The dictator, General I.K. Acheampong, needed the support of\nnorthern tribes in a national referendum designed to make the country a one-party state. To buy\ntheir support, he granted a few tribes control of all the land in the northern part of the state. This an-\ngered other tribes, and violence began shortly thereafter. Outside observers saw this as mere ethnic\nconflict, unaware of the backroom deal which had been made. As Clement Mweyang Aapenguo\nput it, \u201cPeople do not kill each other because of ethnic differences; they kill each other when these\ndifferences are promoted as the barrier to advancement and opportunity.\u201d\nOften, the European imperial powers were responsible for the ethnic animosity in their col-\nonies, conflicts which continued after independence. The clearest case was in Rwanda. The German\nimperialists, who were replaced by the Belgians after World War I, used ethnicity as a tool of indi-\nrect rule. The two main ethnicities of Rwanda are the Tutsis and Hutus. It is quite difficult, ever for\nRwandans, to differentiate between the two groups based on physical appearance alone, as they are\nso similar and speak the same language. In fact, the terms Tutsi and Hutu were more indicative of\nwhether one was a farmer or a herder, and one\u2019s identity could change if one changed his occupation.\nThe German imperialists preferred the Tutsis over the Hutus for vague racial reasons, and\nbecause the Tutsis were more agreeable to conversion to Christianity than the Hutus. The Germans\ngranted the Tutsi king power over the entire colony, ruling indirectly through him. This gave the\nTutsis great advantages over the Hutus, setting off a series of revolts and conflicts spanning years.\nThe 1994 Rwandan Genocide, in which Hutu extremists murdered eight hundred thousand Tutsis\nand moderate Hutus, was one such conflict. The genocide was the result of ambitious Hutu leaders\nwho weaponized longstanding ethnic hatred in order to eliminate political enemies and consolidate\ntheir power. And the ethnic hatred they leveraged through propaganda did not even exist before the\nGermans created it.\n216 Chapter 9: Africa Conclusion\nThe world had high expectations for post-colonial Africa. Exploited for decades, the people now\ncontemplated greater political freedom and, most of all, expanded economic opportunities and a higher\nstandard of living.\nThey were, almost everywhere in Africa, disappointed. Instead, Africa seemed to descend into\nan endless cycle of corruption, poverty, and coups. A great many problems plagued the new nations from\nthe start, most of them legacies of imperialism. In the colonies, most of the capable specialists and admin-\nistrators were White, and they returned to Europe upon independence, robbing the new nations of civil\nservants and necessary specialists. For example, the new nation of Tanzania had nine million citizens, and\nonly nine doctors. It would take many years to train enough doctors to serve the population.\nAnother legacy of imperialism is badly decentralized government. The British, in particular,\npracticed indirect rule; they controlled the central government, but outlying areas were allowed to rule\nthemselves as long as they carried out the colonizer\u2019s orders. After the British left, this led to a nation in\nwhich the outlying regions were so accustomed to ruling themselves that the new central government\ncould not control them. This led to corruption, lawlessness, and even revolts. In many countries, autocratic\ngovernments set up patronage systems (see Chapter 10), in which government positions were handed out\nto political supporters, regardless of their qualifications. This leads to ineffective government, in which\ncivil servants are more interested in plundering the national treasury than serving the people.\nOften, the proffered cures for poverty make matters worse. The International Monetary Fund\nand World Bank, while interested in helping developing nations, have often done more harm than good\nwith Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs). In these programs, the IMF and World Bank offer\nmulti-million-dollar development loans to nations which are in economic crisis. But the receiving nation\nmust restructure its economy to obtain the loan, in order to guarantee, they are told, that they can pay it\nback. The structural adjustments are based on neoliberalism (i.e., unregulated capitalism). Some of the\nadjustment policies are not even universally accepted in the Global North, such as privatized water and\nhealth care, but are forced on the borrower nations if they accept the money. While ostensibly voluntary,\nthe crushing poverty in these countries has compelled their governments to take the loans and accept the\nchanges. This has caused tremendous upheaval in Africa, where people found that they were no longer\nin control of economic policy in their country. SAPs have forced nations to remove trade restrictions,\nforbidding economic protectionism for indigenous manufacturing; this has led to the collapse of much\nof Africa\u2019s traditional craftwork due to foreign competition. Other conditions for SAPs include cutting\nbudgets for housing or food assistance, or raising taxes, making them very unpopular with the poor. Since\nthe loans must be repaid in cash, governments sometimes privatize communal land in order to grow and\nsell cash crops on the international market to get the money, or open new areas to mining or oil drilling,\ncompletely transforming the nature of certain regions without the input of the people living there. Many\nAfricans complain that SAPs are actually a system of neocolonialism, opening African markets and natural\nresources to foreign exploitation. In any case, SAPs do not have a very good record in solving African\npoverty; while the sacrifices for the loans were made, the development programs have typically failed to\ndeliver the promised results. As one analyst put it, African SAPs are \u201call pain, no gain.\u201d\nCertainly, Africa remains economically weak and politically divided. These weaknesses make the\nregion susceptible to unforeseen shocks, like famine or the AIDS epidemic, because they have few resourc-\nes to marshal in the face of disaster. Furthermore, many African governments are \u201cpseudo-democracies,\u201d\nwhich hold elections but are marred by political repression and voting irregularities. Others analysts hold\nout hope for Africa, claiming that democracy is finally catching on in the region, and that true democracy\nwill finally translate into economic policies which lift the region out of poverty.\n217 Suggested Further Reading\nAfricans: The History of a Continent by John Iliffe (Cambridge University Press; 3rd edition, 2017.

Our desire, too, is to spare you the confusion that imperialism\nand its administrative agents and other crooked politicians could entertain.\nWe consider above all that after decades of struggle, the national movement has reached its phase of realization.\nIndeed, the goal of a revolutionary movement being to create all the conditions for liberating action, we believe\nthat, in its internal aspects, the people are united behind the slogan of independence and action and, in the\nexternal aspects, the climate of detente is favorable for the resolution of the minor problems, of which ours,\nwith especially the diplomatic support of our Arab-Muslim brothers. The events in Morocco and Tunisia are\nsignificant on this subject and deeply mark the process of the liberation struggle in North Africa. (Note in this\narea that we have long been the precursors of unity in action, unfortunately never achieved between the three\ncountries).\nToday, both parties are resolutely committed to this path, and we, relegated to the rear, we suffer the fate of\nthose who are overwhelmed. This is how our national movement, struck down by years of immobility and\nroutine, badly oriented, deprived of the essential support of popular opinion, overtaken by events, gradually\ndisintegrates to the great satisfaction of colonialism which believes it has won the greatest victory in its struggle\nagainst the Algerian vanguard.\nTHE SITUATION IS SERIOUS !\nCharles de Gaulle, French Premier:\nSpeech at Constantine, Algeria, October 3, 1958\nLast Sunday, three and a half million men and women of Algeria, without distinction of community, in\ncomplete equality, gave France and myself their vote of confidence. They did this quite simply without any\nconstraint and in spite of the threats that certain fanatics brought to bear against them, their families and\ntheir property. This is a fact, as clear as the bright light of clay. And this fact is fundamental not only because\nit mutually and forever pledges, one to the other, Algeria and France, but also because it ties in with what\nhappened that same day in Metropolitan France, in the Overseas Departments, in the Territories of the\nCommunity.\nThe least that can be said of this great demonstration is that the French people proved to themselves and to the\nentire world their determination for renovation, and that, at the same time, a hundred million men decided to\nbuild their future together in Liberty, Equality and Fraternity.\nWith regard to Algeria, what is the future to which France is calling her? Women and men of Algeria, I have\ncome here to tell you what it is.\nWhat must be achieved is the basic transformation of this country, so brave, so alive, but also so full of\n221 difficulties and suffering. This means that it is necessary for the living conditions of each man and woman to\nimprove from day to day. This means that, for the benefit of the inhabitants, the resources of the earth and\nthe ability of the elites must be brought to light and developed. This means that children must be taught. This\nmeans that all Algeria must have her share in what modern civilization can and must bring to men in terms of\nwell-being and dignity.\nBut the loftiest plans call for practical measures. Here are the measures that my Government intends to take\nin the near future covering the next five years by virtue of the full powers that the new Constitution has just\nconferred upon it.\nDuring these five years, of the young people in Metropolitan France - yes, I say in Metropolitan France-that\nenter the service of the State, in the Administration, in the Army, in education and in the public services, at\nleast a tenth of these young people must be recruited from the Arab, the Kabyle and Mozabite communities,\nand that without prejudice to an increased proportion of Algerians serving in Algeria.\nIn the course of these five years, salaries and wages in Algeria will be raised to a level comparable to what they\nare in Metropolitan France.\nBefore the end of these five years, 250,000 hectares [617,500 acres] of new land will be allotted to Moslem\nfarmers.\nBefore the end of these five years, the first phase of the plan for the agricultural and industrial development of\nAlgeria will be brought to its conclusion. This phase includes, in particular, the delivery and the distribution\nof the oil and gas of the Sahara, the setting up, on this soil, of great metallurgical and chemical complexes,\nthe construction of housing for a million people, the corresponding development of health services, of roads,\nports, means of communication-in short, the regular employment of 400,000 new workers.\nGradually in the course of these five years, two-thirds of the girls and boys will be enrolled in school and,\nduring the three years after that, complete school enrollment of all Algerian youth will be achieved.\nDuring these five years, the human contact that has been made especially by the French Army-by its career\nofficers, its reserve officers, its fighting men, its young conscripts-will be continued and developed and, in\nMetropolitan France, the same must be true, in Paris and n our provinces.\nWhat will be the political Consequences of this evolution which calls for very extensive and prolonged efforts?\nI believe it is quite useless to freeze in advance, in words, that which, in any event, is going to take shape, little\nby little, as it is undertaken. But, in any case, two things arc certain as of now: the first concerns the present.\nIn two months, Algeria will elect her representatives under the same conditions as will Metropolitan France.\nBut at least two thirds of her representatives will have to be Moslem citizens.\nThe other refers to the future. The future of Algeria will in any event - because that is the nature of things-be\nbuilt on a double foundation: her personality and her close solidarity with Metropolitan France.\nIn any case, it is absolutely essential that this fruitful transformation be accomplished. This is necessary for\nthe good of the men of Algeria, for the good of the women, for the good of the children who live here; but it is\nalso necessary for the honor of mankind. It is necessary for the peace of the world. For no one has any interest\nin the stagnation of a people, except the kind of people, who, to serve their ambitions, gamble on the spirit of\n222 Chapter 9: Africa revolt and the poverty of others.\nThis transformation, this immense political, economic, social and cultural task-who could effect this\ntransformation, if not France?\nNow it happens that France has the will and the means to do so. It also happens that the vote of the Algerians\nhas just proved that they desire this transformation and that it should be carried out with France.\nTherefore, turning toward those who are prolonging a fratricidal conflict, who are organizing lamentable\nattacks in Metropolitan France, or who are spreading through the chancelleries, through underground dens, by\nmeans of the radios and the newspapers of certain foreign capitals-vilifications of France, to those I say: Why\nkill? We must enable people to live. Why destroy? Our duty is to build. Why hate? We must cooperate.\nStop this absurd fighting and you will at once see a new blossoming of hope over all the land of Algeria. You\nwill see the prisons emptying; you will see the opening up of a future big enough for everybody, and for you\nyourselves in particular. And then, speaking to those States which are throwing oil on the fire here while their\nunhappy peoples writhe under dictatorships, I say: Could you do what France is in a position to do here, what\nonly France is capable of doing? Could you people do it? No. Then let France carry on, unless you deliberately\ndecide to envenom the conflict in order to distract attention from your own difficulties. But in the present\nstate of the world, where can these bitter incitements lead if not to a universal cataclysm? Only two paths lie\nopen to the human race today: war or brotherhood. In Algeria as everywhere, France, for her part, has chosen\nbrotherhood.\nLong live the Republic!

The white man arrogated to himself the\nright to rule and to be obeyed by the non-white; his mission, he claimed, was to \u201ccivilise\u201d Africa. Under this\ncloak, the Europeans robbed the continent of vast riches and inflicted unimaginable suffering on the African\npeople.\nAll this makes a sad story, but now we must be prepared to bury the past with its unpleasant memories\nand look to the future. All we ask of the former colonial powers is their goodwill and co-operation to remedy\npast mistakes and injustices and to grant independence to the colonies in Africa...\nIt is clear that we must find an African solution to our problems, and that this can only be found in\nAfrican unity. Divided we are weak; united, Africa could become one of the greatest forces for good in the\nworld.\nAlthough most Africans are poor, our continent is potentially extremely rich. Our mineral resources,\n223 which are being exploited with foreign capital only to enrich foreign investors, range from gold and diamonds\nto uranium and petroleum. Our forests contain some of the finest woods to be grown anywhere. Our cash crops\ninclude cocoa, coffee, rubber, tobacco and cotton. As for power, which is an important factor in any economic\ndevelopment, Africa contains over 40% of the potential water power of the world, as compared with about 10%\nin Europe and 13% in North America. Yet so far, less than 1% has been developed. This is one of the reasons\nwhy we have in Africa the paradox of poverty in the midst of plenty, and scarcity in the midst of abundance.\nNever before have a people had within their grasp so great an opportunity for developing a continent\nendowed with so much wealth. Individually, the independent states of Africa, some of them potentially rich,\nothers poor, can do little for their people. Together, by mutual help, they can achieve much. But the economic\ndevelopment of the continent must be planned and pursued as a whole. A loose confederation designed only\nfor economic co-operation would not provide the necessary unity of purpose. Only a strong political union can\nbring about full and effective development of our natural resources for the benefit of our people.\nThe political situation in Africa today is heartening and at the same time disturbing. It is heartening\nto see so many new flags hoisted in place of the old; it is disturbing to see so many countries of varying\nsizes and at different levels of development, weak and, in some cases, almost helpless. If this terrible state of\nfragmentation is allowed to continue it may well be disastrous for us all.\nThere are at present some 28 states in Africa, excluding the Union of South Africa, and those countries\nnot yet free. No less than one of these states have a population of less than three million. Can we seriously\nbelieve that the colonial powers meant these countries to be independent, viable states? The example of South\nAmerica, which has as much wealth, if not more than North America, and yet remains weak and dependent on\noutside interests, is one which every African would do well to study.\nCritics of African unity often refer to the wide differences in culture, language and ideas in various\nparts of Africa. This is true, but the essential fact remains that we are all Africans, and have a common interest\nin the independence of Africa. The difficulties presented by questions of language, culture and different\npolitical systems are not insuperable. If the need for political union is agreed by us all, then the will to create it\nis born; and where there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a way.\nThe present leaders of Africa have already shown a remarkable willingness to consult and seek advice\namong themselves. Africans have, indeed, begun to think continentally. They realise that they have much in\ncommon, both in their past history, in their present problems and in their future hopes. To suggest that the\ntime is not yet ripe for considering a political union of Africa is to evade the facts and ignore realities in Africa\ntoday.\nThe greatest contribution that Africa can make to the peace of the world is to avoid all the dangers\ninherent in disunity, by creating a political union which will also by its success, stand as an example to a\ndivided world. A Union of African states will project more effectively the African personality. It will command\nrespect from a world that has regard only for size and influence. The scant attention paid to African opposition\nto the French atomic tests in the Sahara, and the ignominious spectacle of the U.N.in the Congo quibbling\nabout constitutional niceties while the Republic was tottering into anarchy, are evidence of the callous disregard\nof African Independence by the Great Powers.\nWe have to prove that greatness is not to be measured in stockpiles of atom bombs. I believe strongly\nand sincerely that with the deep-rooted wisdom and dignity, the innate respect for human lives, the intense\nhumanity that is our heritage, the African race, united under one federal government, will emerge not as just\n224 Chapter 9: Africa another world bloc to flaunt its wealth and strength, but as a Great Power whose greatness is indestructible\nbecause it is built not on fear, envy and suspicion, nor won at the expense of others, but founded on hope,\ntrust, friendship and directed to the good of all mankind.\nThe emergence of such a mighty stabilizing force in this strife-worn world should be regarded not\nas the shadowy dream of a visionary, but as a practical proposition, which the peoples of Africa can, and\nshould, translate into reality. There is a tide in the affairs of every people when the moment strikes for political\naction. Such was the moment in the history of the United States of America when the Founding Fathers saw\nbeyond the petty wranglings of the separate states and created a Union. This is our chance. We must act now.\nTomorrow may be too late and the opportunity will have passed, and with it the hope of free Africa\u2019s survival.\nFrom Kwame Nkrumah, I Speak of Freedom: A Statement of African Ideology (London: William Heinemann\nLtd., 1961), pp. xi-xiv.\nA. L. Geyer: The Case for Apartheid, 1953\nThe following speech was given before the Rotary Club of London on August 19, 1953. A supporter of apartheid\nexplains why it is the best policy for all races in South Africa.\nAs one of the aftermaths of the last war, many people seem to suffer from a neurotic guilt complex with regard\nto colonies. This has led to a strident denunciation of the Black African\u2019s wrongs, real or imaginary, under the\nwhite man\u2019s rule in Africa. It is a denunciation, so shrill and emotional, that the vast debt owed by Black Africa\nto those same white men is lost sight of (and, incidentally, the Black African is encouraged to forget that debt).\nCon fining myself to that area of which I know at least a very little, Africa south of the Equator, I shall say\nthis without fear of reasonable contradiction: ever) millimetre of progress in all that vast area is due entirely\nto the White Man. You are familiar with the cry that came floating over the ocean from the West-a cry that\n\u201ccolonialism\u201d is outmoded and pernicious, a cry that is being vociferously echoed by a certain gentleman in the\nEast. (This refers to Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India.)\nMay I point out that African colonies are of comparatively recent date Before that time Black Africa did have\nindependence for a thousand years and more-and what did she make of it? One problem, I admit, she did\nsolve most effectively. There was no overpopulation. Interminable savage inter-tribal wars, witchcraft, disease,\nfamine, and even cannibalism saw to that.\nLet me turn to my subject, to that part of Africa south of the Sahara which, historically, is not part of Black\nAfrica at all - my own country. Its position is unique in Africa as its racial problem is unique in the world.\nSouth Africa is no more the original home of its black Africans, the Bantu than it is of its white Africans. Both\nraces went there as colonists and, what is more, as practically contemporary colonists. In some parts the Bantu\narrived first, in other parts the Europeans were the first comers.\nSouth Africa contains the only independent white nation in all Africa \u2013 . South African nation which has no\nother homeland to which it could retreat; a nation which has created a highly developed modern state, and t\nwhich occupies a position of inestimable importance\nSouth Africa is the only independent country in the world in which white people are outnumbered by black\npeople. Including all coloured races or peoples the proportion in Brazil is 20 to 1. In South Africa it is 1 to 4.\nThis brings me to the question of the future. To me there seems to be two possible lines of development:\n225 Apartheid or Partnership. Partnership means Cooperation of the individual citizens within a single community,\nirrespective of race.... (It) demands that there shall be no discrimination whatsoever in trade and industry, in\nthe professions and the Public Service. Therefore, whether a man is black or a white African, must according\nto this policy be as irrelevant as whether in London a man is a Scotsman or an Englishman. I take it: that\nPartnership must also aim at the eventual disappearance of all social segregation based on race. This policy\nof Partnership admittedly does not envisage immediate adult suffrage. Obviously, however, the loading of the\nfranchise in order to exclude the great majority of the Bantu could be no more than a temporary expedient....\n(In effect) \u201cthere must one day be black domination, in the sense that power must pass to the immense African\nmajority. Need I say more to show that this policy of Partnership could, in South Africa, only mean the\neventual disappearance of the white South African nation? And will you be greatly surprised if I tell you that\nthis white nation is not prepared to commit national suicide, not even by slow poisoning? The only alternative\nis a policy of apartheid, the policy of separate development. The germ of this policy is inherent in almost all of\nour history, implanted there by the force of circumstances.... Apartheid is a policy of self preservation. We make\nno apology for possessing that very natural urge. But it is more than that. It is an attempt at self-preservation in\na manner that will enable the Bantu to develop fully as a separate people.\nWe believe that, for a long time to come, political power will have to remain with the whites, also in the interest\nof our still very immature Bantu. But we believe also, in the words of a statement by the Dutch Reformed\nChurch in 1950, a Church that favours apartheid, that \u201cno people in the world worth their salt, would be\ncontent indefinitely with no say or only indirect say in the affairs of the State or in the country\u2019s socio economic\norganisation in which decisions are taken about their interests and their future.\u201d\nThe immediate aim is, therefore, to keep the races outside the Bantu areas apart as far as possible, to continue\nthe process of improving the conditions and standards of living of the Bantu, and to give them greater\nresponsibility for their own local affairs. At the same time the long-range aim is to develop the Bantu areas\nboth agriculturally and industrially, with the object of making these areas in every sense the national home of\nthe Bantu - areas in which their interests are paramount, in which to an ever greater degree all professional\nand other positions are to be occupied by them, and in which they are to receive progressively more and more\nautonomy.\nFrom Union of South Africa Government: Information Pamphlet (New York, 1953), reprinted in Ruth E.\nGordon and Clive Talbot, eds., From Dias to Vorster: Source Material on South African History 14881 975\n(Goodwood, S.A.: Nasou, n.d.), pp. 409 410.\nThis text is part of the Internet Modern History Sourcebook.\nDesmond Tutu: The Question of South Africa, 1984\nBishop Desmond Tutu (1931-) was the first Black Archbishop of Capetown, the head of the Anglican Church in\nSouth Africa. Tutu used this position to speak out against Apartheid. In 1984 he was awarded the Nobel Peace\nPrize. Shortly afterwards he gave following speech, attacking South Africa\u2019s racial policies, to the United Nations\nSecurity Council. Tutu is here pessimistic about the future. As events turned out, change came peacefully..\nI speak out of a full heart, for I am about to speak about a land that I love deeply and passionately; a beautiful\nland of rolling hills and gurgling streams, of clear starlit skies, of singing birds, and gamboling lambs; a land\nGod has richly endowed with the good things of the earth, a land rich in mineral deposits of nearly every\nkind; a land of vast open spaces, enough to accommodate all its inhabitants comfortably; a land capable of\nfeeding itself and other lands on the beleaguered continent of Africa, a veritable breadbasket; a land that could\n226 Chapter 9: Africa contribute wonderfully to the material and spiritual development and prosperity of all Africa and indeed of the\nwhole world. It is endowed with enough to satisfy the material and spiritual needs of all its peoples.\nAnd so we would expect that such a land, veritably flowing with milk and honey, should be a land where peace\nand harmony and contentment reigned supreme. Alas, the opposite is the case. For my beloved country is\nwracked by division, by alienation, by animosity, by separation, by injustice, by avoidable pain and suffering.\nIt is a deeply fragmented society, ridden by fear and anxiety, covered by a pall of despondency and a sense of\ndesperation, split up into hostile, warring factions.\nIt is a highly volatile land, and its inhabitants sit on a powder keg with a very short fuse indeed, ready to blow\nus all up into kingdom come. There is endemic unrest, like a festering sore that will not heal until not just the\nsymptoms are treated but the root causes are removed.\nSouth African society is deeply polarized. Nothing illustrates this more sharply than the events of the past\nweek. While the black community was in the seventh heaven of delight because of the decision of that\ncommittee in Oslo, and while the world was congratulating the recipient of the Nobel Peace prize, the white\ngovernment and most white South Africans, very sadly, were seeking to devalue that prize. An event that\nshould have been the occasion of uninhibited joy and thanksgiving revealed a sadly divided society.\nBefore I came to this country in early September to go on sabbatical, I visited one of the trouble spots near\nJohannesburg. I went with members of the Executive Committee of the South African Council of Churches,\nwhich had met in emergency session after I had urged Mr. P. W. Botha to meet with church leaders to deal\nwith a rapidly deteriorating situation. As a result of our peace initiative, we did get to meet with two cabinet\nministers, demonstrating thereby our concern to carry out our call to be ministers of reconciliation and\nambassadors of Christ.\nIn this black township, we met an old lady who told us that she was looking after her grandchildren and the\nchildren of neighbors while they were at work. On the day about which she was speaking, the police had been\nchasing black schoolchildren in that street, but the children had eluded the police, who then drove down the\nstreet past the old lady\u2019s house. Her wards were playing in front of the house, in the yard. She was sitting in\nthe kitchen at the back, when her daughter burst in, calling agitatedly for her. She rushed out into the living\nroom. A grandson had fallen just inside the door, dead. The police had shot him in the back. He was six years\nold. Recently a baby, a few weeks old, became the first white casualty of the current uprisings. Every death is\none too many. Those whom the black community has identified as collaborators with a system that oppresses\nthem and denies them the most elementary human rights have met cruel death, which we deplore as much as\nany others. They have rejected these people operating within the system, whom they have seen as lackies and\nstooges, despite their titles of town councilors, and so on, under an apparently new dispensation extending the\nright of local government to the blacks.\nOver 100,000 black students are out of school, boycotting what they and the black community perceive as an\ninferior education designed deliberately for inferiority. An already highly volatile situation has been ignited\nseveral times and, as a result, over 80 persons have died. There has been industrial unrest, with the first official\nstrike by black miners taking place, not without its toll of fatalities among the blacks.\nSome may be inclined to ask: But why should all this unrest be taking place just when the South African\ngovernment appears to have embarked on the road of reform, exemplified externally by the signing of the\nNkomati accord and internally by the implementation of a new constitution which appears to depart radically\nfrom the one it replaces, for it makes room for three chambers: one for whites, one for Coloureds, and one for\n227 Indians; a constitution described by many as a significant step forward?\nI wish to state here, as I have stated on other occasions, that Mr. P. W. Botha must be commended for his\ncourage in declaring that the future of South Africa could no longer be determined by whites only. That was\na very brave thing to do. The tragedy of South Africa is that something with such a Considerable potential\nfor resolving the burgeoning crisis of our land should have been vitiated by the exclusion of 73 percent of the\npopulation, the Overwhelming majority in the land.\nBy no stretch of the imagination could that kind of constitution be considered to be democratic. The\ncomposition of the committees, in the ratio of four whites to two Coloureds to one Indian, demonstrates\neloquently what most people had suspected all along-that it was intended to perpetuate the rule of a minority.\nThe fact that the first qualification for membership in the chambers is racial says that this constitution was\ndesigned to entrench racism and ethnicity. The most obnoxious features of apartheid would remain untouched\nand unchanged. The Group Areas Act, the Population Registration Act, separate educational systems for the\ndifferent race groups; all this and more would remain quite unchanged.\nThis constitution was seen by the mainline English speaking churches and the official white opposition as\ndisastrously inadequate, and they called for its rejection in the whites only referendum last November. The\ncall was not heeded. The blacks overwhelmingly rejected what they regarded as a sham, an instrument in\nthe politics of exclusion. Various groups campaigned for a boycott of the Coloured and Indian elections-\ncampaigned, I might add, against very great odds, by and large peacefully. As we know, the authorities\nresponded with their usual iron fist tactics, detaining most of the leaders of the United Democratic Front (UDF)\nand other organizations that had organized the boycott-and we have some of them now holed up in the British\nConsulate in Durban, causing a diplomatic contretemps.\nThe current unrest was in very large measure triggered off by the reaction of the authorities to anti election\ndemonstrations in August. The farcical overall turnout of only about 20 percent says more eloquently than\nanything else that the Indians and Coloureds have refused to be co opted as the junior partners of apartheid-the\nphrase used by Allan Boesak, the founding father of the UDF and president of the World Alliance of Reformed\nChurches.\nBut there is little freedom in this land of plenty. There is little freedom to disagree with the determinations of\nthe authorities. There is large scale unemployment because of the drought and the recession that has hit most of\nthe world\u2019s economy. And it is at such a time that the authorities have increased the prices of various foodstuffs\nand also of rents in black townships-measures designed to hit hardest those least able to afford the additional\ncosts. It is not surprising that all this has exacerbated an already tense and volatile situation.\nSo the unrest is continuing, in a kind of war of attrition, with the casualties not being large enough at any one\ntime to shock the world sufficiently for it to want to take action against the system that is the root cause of\nall this agony. We have warned consistently that unrest will be endemic in South Africa until its root cause is\nremoved. And the root cause is apartheid-a vicious, immoral and totally evil, and unchristian system.\nPeople will refer to the Nkomati accord, and we will say that we are glad for the cessation of hostilities\nanywhere in the world. But we will ask: Why is d\u00e9tente by the South African government only for export? Why\nis state aggression reserved for the black civilian population? The news today is that the army has cordoned\noff Sebokeng, a black township, near Sharpeville, and 400 or so persons have been arrested, including the\nimmediate ex moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Southern Africa and Father Geoff Moselane, \u00e0n\nAnglican priest.\n228 Chapter 9: Africa As blacks we often run the gauntlet of roadblocks on roads leading into our townships, and these have been\nmanned by the army in what are actually described as routine police operations When you use the army in this\nfashion, who is the enemy?\nThe authorities have not stopped stripping blacks of their South African citizenship Here I am, 53 years\nold, a bishop in the church, some would say reasonably responsible; I travel on a document that says of my\nnationality that it is \u201cundeterminable at present.\u201d The South African government is turning us into aliens in the\nland of our birth. It continues unabated with its vicious policy of forced population removals. It is threatening\nto remove the people of Kwa Ngema. It treats carelessly the women in the KTC squatter camp near Cape Town\nwhose flimsy plastic coverings are destroyed every day by the authorities; and the heinous crime of those\nwomen is that they want to be with their husbands, with the fathers of their children.\nWhite South Africans are not demons; they are ordinary human beings, scared human beings, many of them;\nwho would not be, if they were outnumbered five to one? Through this lofty body I wish to appeal to my white\nfellow South Africans to share in building a new society, for blacks are not intent on driving whites into the sea\nbut on claiming only their rightful place in the sun in the land of their birth.\nWe deplore all forms of violence, the violence of an oppressive and unjust society and the violence of those\nseeking to overthrow that society, for we believe that violence is not the answer to the crisis of our land.\nWe dream of a new society that will be truly non racial, truly democratic, in which people count because they\nare created in the image of God.\nWe are committed to work for justice, for peace, and for reconciliation. We ask you, please help us; urge\nthe South African authorities to go to the conference table with the . . . representatives of all sections of our\ncommunity. I appeal to this body to act. I appeal in the name of the ordinary, the little people of South Africa.\nI appeal in the name of the squatters in crossroads and in the KTC camp. I appeal on behalf of the father who\nhas to live in a single sex hostel as a migrant worker, separated from his family for 11 months of the year. I\nappeal on behalf of the students who have rejected this travesty of education made available only for blacks. I\nappeal on behalf of those who are banned arbitrarily, who are banished, who are detained without trial, those\nimprisoned because they have had a vision of this new South Africa. I appeal on behalf of those who have been\nexiled from their homes.\nI say we will be free, and we ask you: Help us, that this freedom comes for all of us in South Africa, black and\nwhite, but that it comes with the least possible violence, that it comes peacefully, that it comes soon.\nTutu, Desmond. \u201cThe Question of South Africa, 1984.\u201d Internet History Sourcebooks Project.

Of course, it\u2019s not\ntemples. Image from the au-\nthor\u2019s personal collection. necessary to compare Latin America with anything when examining its history,\nbut doing so allows us to clarify the factors which led to distinct Latin American\nhistories and cultures; it helps us understand why Latin America is what it is.\nIncidentally: where exactly is Latin America? In this chapter, we consider\nLatin America to be all the nations in the Americas which were colonized by Spain\nand Portugal. This includes Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic in the\nCaribbean. Countries in the Americas colonized by other European nations \u2013 for\nexample, Belize or French Guiana \u2013 are not considered Latin America.\nTo begin this chapter, we will examine several aspects of Latin American\nhistory and culture which form the basis of the region\u2019s historical trajectory.\n230 Chapter 10: Latin America Neocolonialism, Monoculture, and Export Economies\nNeocolonialism is the policy of using the underdeveloped world as a source of\nraw materials, and as a market for manufactured goods. While the motivations are the\nsame as in outright imperialism, the main difference is that the developed nation does not\ndirectly control the underdeveloped one, therefore making the process seem innocent at\nfirst glimpse. It appears that the underdeveloped nation is autonomous and maybe even\ndemocratic, but control can be imposed in different ways.\nThe United States carried out neocolonialism against Latin America for most of its\nhistory. Most Latin American colonies attained their independence from Spain and Portugal\nin the early 19th century (except, notably, the Caribbean islands). In 1823, the United States\ndeclared the Monroe Doctrine, in which it forbade European recolonization or domina-\ntion of Latin America. The US claimed that it wanted to protect the new Latin American\nnations from European predation. Not only was it very bold of the US to make this claim\n\u2013 in 1823, the US couldn\u2019t have prevented France or England from doing anything \u2013 but the\nreal reason for the doctrine was to reserve Latin America assets for the United States.\nUS citizens and corporations then proceeded to buy assets in Latin America, from\nfarmland to mineral wealth. Before the Mexican Revolution (1910 \u2013 1920), American in-\nterests owned no less than 25% of all Mexican land. The relative wealth of the US allowed\nits citizens to purchase all this at low prices, and the US, furthermore, had the technical\nexpertise and start-up cash to open mines. This was not good for the Latin Americans, since\nthey were reduced to low-wage workers on foreign-owned farms and mines. Most of the\nprofit went up to the US. And if those assets should come under threat \u2013 for example, in a\nrevolt, or from a politician who wanted locals to control these assets \u2013 the US could, and\ndid, send troops to overthrow the government or protect US assets. Prior to the Cold War,\nthe US invaded Latin American nations no fewer than 36 times in order to get its desired\npolitical or economic outcomes. Between control of assets and the ever-present threat of\ninvasion, it is no wonder the US has been called the \u201cHovering Giant,\u201d forever dominating\nLatin America. Or, as Mexican dictator Porfirio Dias put it, \u201cPoor Mexico, so far from God,\nso close to the United States.\u201d\nBut US dominance was not the only reason for weak Latin American economies.\nTwo more factors came into play: monocultures and export economies. Monoculture is\nwhen a nation specializes in only one main agricultural export, such as coffee (El Salvador\nand Brazil) or sugar (Cuba). Because the farmers are skilled in growing this crop, and the\nland suited to it, it is typically profitable to grow that single crop to maximize profit. The\nprice for the crop on the international market will inevitably change, and when it does,\nit can adversely affect the entire economy. This causes drastic swings in the nation\u2019s GNP.\nExport economies are dependent on exporting raw materials to the developed world. Such\nan economy seems to make sense, since the nation\u2019s own population is too poor to buy\nits own raw materials or lacks the factories which require them. But a country without its\nown manufacturing base must import manufactured goods from other nations. Since raw\nmaterials are less expensive than manufactured goods, it means that the nation is selling\ncheap goods to buy expensive ones \u2013 not a winning economic strategy. Also, exporting raw\nmaterials suffers from the same problem as monoculture in that prices and demand for\nthem can vary wildly, destabilizing the national economy.\nAll this explains why the Great Depression was so bad for Latin America. The US\nno longer needed the raw materials of Latin America, because US factories were closed.\nAnd the US also stopped buying the monocultures of the region (coffee, sugar, tobacco,\nbananas, etc.) because people no longer had the disposable income for such luxuries.\n231 Weak Political and Economic Legacies\nAnother important factor in Latin American history goes all the way back to the\nstart of European colonization of the Americas \u2013 and, in fact, even before that.\nWhen the British began colonizing North America, the colonists brought with them\ncertain cultural advantages. First, Great Britain was probably the freest, most democratic\ncountry in the world at the time. Although Great Britain was still a monarchy, the power\nof its kings and queens was circumscribed by Parliament, preventing the absolutism seen\nin France or Russia. Furthermore, the rights of British subjects had been guaranteed by the\nMagna Carta for centuries. The British brought this culture of relative democracy and free-\ndom to the New World (without extending those rights to the indigenous and slaves). The\nBritish had also adopted capitalism, a relatively new and very profitable economic system.\nWhen the colonists successfully rebelled in the American Revolution, the new nation inher-\nited both democracy (now without the king) and capitalism, the most effective systems of\npolitics and economics yet discovered. This is why the United States is sometimes called the\n\u201cfirst modern nation.\u201d\nBy contrast, Spain and Portugal had very backward economic and political systems,\nwhich they exported to the New World. Both nations were absolutist, with little democra-\ncy or civil rights for its citizens. Neither practiced capitalism, retaining instead a medieval\nsystem of feudalism and guilds. This meant that Latin American nations, after indepen-\ndence, inherited inferior political and economic models relative to the United States, giving\nthem a disadvantaged start. This is another reason why Latin America has developed, both\neconomically and in terms of human rights, more slowly than the United States. As the\nLatin American saying goes: \u201cIf only we had been colonized by the British.\u201d They under-\nstand the consequences of history.\nOne consequence of a weaker democratic tradition in Latin America is the role of\nthe military in political culture. The United States has never had a military coup; its military\nremains aloof from politics. Latin America, however, has seen a great many military coups.\nA coup might come when a president is passing policies counter to what the generals (or the\nUnited States government) want to see. Perhaps bad policies are leading to social chaos, like\nriots or revolts, and the generals want to stabilize the situation. It may be that the coup plot-\nters are simply ambitious and want to make themselves dictators (Somoza in Nicaragua was\na prime example of this). It may seem like a convenient solution at the time, but military\ncoups are extremely harmful of democracy in the long run. They don\u2019t allow democracy a\nchance to solve its problems, never let the institution seep into the culture and become part\nof the national identity. Military coups simply delay the full development of democracy.\nMost every Latin American nation has suffered at least one; many have suffered dozens.\nAnother relic of the backward politics from Portugal and Spain is a reliance on\nstrongmen in Latin American culture. This can manifest as giving one\u2019s loyalty to a wealthy\nlocal elite or to a national political candidate. For example, one could faithfully vote for a\npolitical candidate, and in return could receive benefits like jobs or protection from crook-\ned police. Such a system is called patronage, and is common in poor countries where the\naverage person does not have enough money or civil liberty to live comfortably or safely;\nthey must attach themselves to a stronger savior who will protect them in a patriarchal\nmanner. That patriarch demands loyalty in return, even including one\u2019s participation in a\ncoup if necessary. Again, this is bad for democracy, where one\u2019s freedom and safety should\nbe guaranteed by the state, not an individual who will demand payment for it. It allows the\npowerful to become dictators; and, coupled with the military coups launched by ambitious\nmen, it means that Latin America has seen a great many dictators and semi-democratic\nstrongmen. Juan Peron of Argentina ran such a patronage system in which the poor urban\n232 Chapter 10: Latin America workers received higher wages and other benefits, as long as they voted for him; the benefits\ndid not come from the workers\u2019 rights under the constitution, but from Peron himself. On\nthe other hand, Peron did not tolerate dissent, and suppressed opposition politicians and\njournalists. This is why patronage is patriarchal: the relationship is as children to a father,\nnot as citizens to elected leaders.\nIndigenous Populations\nOne of the most important factors in Latin American history, and a major differ-\nence between the US and Latin America, is the history of indigenous peoples. In the United\nStates, the indigenous people (known in the US as Indians) were removed from their lands,\nforcibly assimilated, or killed. The survivors were forced onto reservations, which are mar-\nginal, unproductive lands. Although indigenous culture in the United States survives to a\nsmall degree, its influence on modern US culture is negligible.\nThe situation in Latin American is much different. As the Spanish were busy de-\nstroying indigenous culture, the Catholic Church stepped in to prevent a complete geno-\nGirl from the Embera tribe in Panama.\ncide. The Church, which was in a long battle against the Spanish crown for power, forced the\nCompliments of Yves Picq via Wikipedia\nstate to allow the surviving indigenous to retain what land they still had, especially if those Commons.\npeople converted to Christianity. Since they had enough good land to practice farming, the\nindigenous\u2019 numbers rebounded. They retained their culture, despite pressure to assimilate\ninto the wider society, and kept their languages and religions (the Church was not pleased\nwith the last).\nThe result is that, today, a large percentage of Latin Americans identify as indige-\nnous. The number varies by country, and many people are part-indigenous, so determin-\ning who is indigenous is a notoriously difficult task. Guatemala is at least 45% indigenous,\nthough most nations are under 10%. Still, there at 45 million indigenous people in Latin\nAmerica, who have to some degree or another retained their original culture. In the US, the\nnumber is only about 6 million.\nThe upshot is that indigenous culture still has a profound effect on Latin America.\nThe indigenous retain at least some of their ancient, pre-capitalist lifestyles. This means that\nthey are not necessarily committed to the prevailing national culture of consumerism and\npaid labor. They may have their own land to work, their own clothes and other household\nitems; they do not need to work for someone else in an office, or buy someone else\u2019s com-\nmodities. This means that they do not necessarily provide cheap labor to companies, do not\nparticipate in the market, and do not provide much in taxation, all to the chagrin of political\nand corporate elites. Governments have often run programs to assimilate the indigenous\ninto the wider society, sometimes forcibly, so that they can contribute to the economy. This\nis no longer a problem for governments of the US, Canada, and Europe, since they essen-\ntially eliminated their indigenous populations long ago. But it is another reason why Latin\nAmerican economies struggle; a great many people do not want to fully participate in them.\nThe indigenous relate to capitalist culture in many ways. Some conservative indig-\nenous completely reject capitalist culture and do not even speak Spanish or Portuguese, but\nonly their original languages. Others abandon their indigenous identities and assimilate;\ngiven the racism they face as indigenous people, this is understandable. Many indigenous\nkeep one foot in either world. They might work part-time in the capitalist economy, usually\nfor low wages, then return to their own lands for a while and live their traditional lives. They\nhave the clothes and languages to switch worlds. These people live fascinating lives, at once\nancient and modern, although abiding by the norms of both can be challenging.\nThe Cold War\n233 The Cold War introduced a new and impactful element into US relations with Latin\nAmerica. Before the Cold War, the protection of US-owned assets and economic oppor-\ntunity was the primary driver of US policy in the region. With the start of the Cold War,\nthe primary driver shifted to preventing any sort of socialist presence in Latin America.\nThe United States perceived the region as its rightful sphere of influence and believed that\npreventing socialist gains there was necessary to its security. It was prepared to go to almost\nany length, legal or otherwise, to do so.\nOne important aspect of Cold War relations in Latin America was the fact that the\nUSSR was not very interested in supporting socialist movements in the region, and certain-\nly did not try to launch them. Soviet leadership, as mentioned in Chapter 2, was much more\ninterested in defense than aggression, and was most defensive along its borders. Spreading\ncommunism in Latin America was considered counterproductive to their goals, as it would\nmight provoke war with the US with little or nothing to gain from it. Helping the Latin\nAmericans free themselves from capitalism was not in their calculations.\nThe socialist movements of Latin America were homegrown, the results of dictator-\nship, poverty, and a lack of human rights in those countries. They were locally launched and\nsupported; at most, communist Cuba might support them, since Castro was more idealistic\nthan the Soviets. But the US always acted as if all socialism in Latin America emanated from\nMoscow. This did serve as an excuse to retain control over Latin American economies and\nprotect US assets, and provided the opportunity for US political leaders to appear as heroes\nfor \u201csaving\u201d Latin America. One problem for the US was that recognizing that the socialist\nmovements were homegrown would be an admission that these Latin American nations\nhad real political and economic problems, and that the socialists had legitimate complaints.\nThat was not a useful conclusion when the US objective was to maintain the status quo in\nthe region.\nThe first notable US interference in Latin America during the Cold War was a CIA\noperation called PBSUCCESS. In 1944, a popular uprising had overthrown military dic-\ntator Jorge Ubico and established the first democracy in Guatemala. Successive presidents\nimproved the minimum wage to aid the poor. This angered United Fruit Company (UFC),\nan American corporation holding vast areas of banana-growing land in Guatemala; it was,\nin fact, the single largest landowner in the country. Guatemalan president Jacobo \u00c1rbenz,\nelected in 1951, decided to seize, with compensation, all privately-owned agricultural lands\nthat were not actually being cultivated, in order to provide land to poor peasants for farm-\ning. This included UFC lands.\nIn retaliation, UFC spent half a million dollars on a lobbying campaign to convince\nUS congressmen, and President Eisenhower, that \u00c1rbenz was a communist, and was plan-\nning to allow the USSR to station troops in Guatemala. Eisenhower therefore approved a\nplan by which the CIA would train and equip a mercenary army, led by Guatemalan exile\nCastillo Armas. The coup was carried out in 1954, and though amateurish in execution,\nmanaged to succeed. \u00c1rbenz went into exile and Armas became dictator of Guatemala.\nUFC took back all its lands. The CIA then tried to find evidence that \u00c1rbenz was working\nfor the Soviets; they found none. Armas destroyed democracy in Guatemala, leading to the\nfour-decade Guatemalan Civil War, which killed upwards of two hundred thousand people\nbefore finally restoring democracy to Guatemala.\nThis operation set the standard for US intervention in Latin America during the\nCold War. Although US troops were sometimes deployed (Dominican Republic, Grenada,\nPanama), the usual method was to aid rightist governments with equipment, money, and\nadvisors, while also carrying out election interference and propaganda campaigns. The CIA\nalso executed direct action campaigns, especially in Cuba.\nThe most famous episode in Cold War Latin America, and the only one directly\n234 Chapter 10: Latin America involving the USSR, involved Cuba. In March 1952, Fulgencio Batista staged a coup with\nthe help of the military to install himself as dictator of the island nation. US citizens and\ncorporations (including United Fruit Company) owned the vast majority of sugar-growing\nland in Cuba. The US quickly recognized Batista\u2019s government, though it was clearly illegal,\nbecause he promised to take care of American assets. Not only did Batista allow the US to\noperate with low taxes, but also let US citizens buy evermore land until they owned about\nseventy percent of all arable land in Cuba and almost all its oil industry. Batista pocketed\nmost of the money from these sales. The population, however, was largely impoverished;\nthey were reduced to low-wage laborers, with 20% unemployment. Only about one-third of\nhomes had running water.\nAll attempts to change the situation \u2013 by protests or through the courts \u2013 were met\nwith a brutal response. Batista\u2019s police state tolerated no dissent, and murdered some 20,000\nCubans to retain power. The US continued to support Batista, selling him weapons which\nhe used against his own people. Furthermore, Batista allowed US organized crime to oper-\nate in Cuba with impunity, and permitted Cuba to become a drug transshipment point. The\nUS government continued to ignore all this.\nIn 1953, Fidel Castro, a young lawyer, launched an uprising against the govern-\nment by attacking the army barracks in Santiago with a small group of men. The attack\nfailed and Fidel, along with his brother Ra\u00fal, were captured and imprisoned. They were\nsentenced to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment, but served about two; in 1955, to deflect public\ncriticism of his regime, Batista released some political prisoners, including Castro. It would\nprove his worst error.\nCastro went to Mexico to prepare for his next attempt. In Mexico City, he met\nAlberto Bayo, a Cuban who had fought in the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s on the side of\nthe socialists. Castro asked Bayo to train rebels for him, and Bayo agreed. While in Mexico,\nCastro also recruited Argentine doctor Che Guevara into the insurgency. In December\n1956, when they had gathered enough money and weapons, Castro led 82 revolutionaries\ninto Cuba to begin the insurgency.\nBatista\u2019s cruelty meant that Castro had no problems finding recruits. His army\ngrew in the southern mountains of Cuba while Batista\u2019s army weakened; his cruelty and\nanti-democratic impulses finally became mainstream news in the US, and Congress decid-\ned to stop selling him weapons. After that, the rebels won nearly every encounter with the\narmy.\nFinally, the revolutionaries left the mountains and pushed towards Havana in\n1958. Batista collected his family and millions of dollars in cash and fled to the Dominican\nRepublic. Castro took Havana on January 9, 1959.\nCastro was shortly appointed Prime Minister of Cuba and established relations\nFidel Castro and fellow rebels in\nwith the US, whose leaders were anxious to see what Castro would do in Cuba. Castro\nthe mountains of Cuba.\nclaimed that he was not a communist, and whether he initially was is debated. But US lead-\ners were quickly disappointed. In May 1959, Castro\nnationalized US-owned lands, to redistribute to the\nCuban people, and seized US oil assets. As is usu-\nally the case, it was the seizure of US assets which\ncaused relations with the US to sour. The US broke\ndiplomatic ties with Cuba and initiated an embargo\nthe next year, hoping to bring Castro to heel. It was\na bad error, as it caused Castro to turn to the USSR\nfor aid. The Soviets agreed to buy Cuban sugar in\nexchange for oil, which Cuba needed.\nThe US then attempted to remove Castro\nby supporting an invasion of anti-Castro exiles in a\n235 redo of PBSUCCESS. The April 1961 invasion (the Bay of Pigs) failed, and only strength-\nened Castro\u2019s popularity in Cuba. Castro then declared Cuba a socialist state. His attempts\nto defend Cuba from another US attack led to the Cuban Missile Crisis (see Chapter 3).\nThe CIA then attempted to assassinate Castro in a program called Operation Mongoose,\nand failed many times to do so. Castro was, above all else, a survivor. He died of natural\ncauses in 2016.\nThe US failure in Cuba in no way discouraged the superpower in its policy of\ndominating Latin America. Starting in the mid-1970s, the CIA coordinated a plan across\nSouth America called Operation Condor. Ostensibly, the objective was to prevent socialist\nsubversion and Soviet influence; but such guerilla movements as existed were incapable of\noverthrowing their nations, and Soviet intervention was nonexistent. Instead, the operation\nhelped right-wing dictatorships in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and elsewhere to repress oppo-\nsition to their rule. The targets included union leaders, priests, nuns, and students \u2013 anyone\nwho spoke out against the dictators and called for democracy, including the guerillas. With\ntheir militaries and intelligence organizations cooperating, and trained in torture by the\nCIA, the dictatorships imprisoned at least 400,000 people and killed at least 50,000. It was in\nthe 1970s that a new technique for suppression appeared in Latin America \u2013 disappearanc-\nes. This technique was popular during the Dirty War in Argentina, when the dictatorship\nsuppressed all dissent during Condor. To hide the repression as much as possible, the gov-\nernment would arrest people, drug them, and then dump them into the sea. The advantage\nof this technique was that international human rights organizations could not prove that an\narrest and murder had taken place, giving the government some deniability. Tens of thou-\nsands of people simply vanished in the night, giving rise to a new term in Latin America:\ndesaparecidos, the disappeared.\nThe US also supported coups against left-wing leaders wherever they cropped up,\nunder the prejudice that any such leader would automatically help spread communism\nin Latin America. One such example was the government of Salvador Allende in Chile.\nElected in 1970, Allende was the first Marxist to win a democratic election. The United\nStates immediately castigated him as an enemy and planned a coup against him. In 1973,\nthe CIA assisted right-wing General Augusto Pinochet in staging a military coup against\nAllende, who was killed in the process. Pinochet ruled Chile as a dictator, repressing all\ndemocratic movements, until 1990.\nHistorians have noted that the primary trigger for US intervention in Latin America\nis nationalization \u2013 that is, if the Latin Americans seize US property to make the country\nless economically dependent on foreigners. This raises the question of whether US interven-\ntions were done to prevent socialist infiltration, or to protect the private property of US cit-\nizens and corporations. Was it done for politics or money? Although the debate continues,\nGuatemalan president Jacobo \u00c1rbenz believed that ideology and perceived security was the\nmain driver of US policy during the Cold War. As he famously stated after the coup which\ndeposed him: \u201cThey would have invaded us even if we had no bananas.\u201d\nCentral America in the 1980s\nThe dictatorships of Latin America, supported by the United States, caused tremen-\ndous misery to all but the most elite groups in Latin America. The dictatorships were gener-\nally good for the elites, who concentrated their wealth at everyone else\u2019s expense; wages were\nlow, with few if any worker protections. Consequently, poverty was widespread, particularly\nin the countryside. Reformers who sought to change the system \u2013 union leaders, religious\nleaders, journalists, and assorted leftists \u2013 were imprisoned, disappeared, or murdered. This\narrangement intensified until it created a deadly, radicalized environment in the 1980s, un-\nsurprisingly in the poorest region of the hemisphere: Central America.\n236 Chapter 10: Latin America Guatemala had been engaged in a civil war since the 1960s, pitting a series of US-\nbacked military dictators against the people. Probably the worst place in Central America,\nhowever, was El Salvador. A 1979 coup by the Revolutionary Government Junta, a col-\nlection of civil and military leaders, established a right-wing, anticommunist government,\nwhose goal was preventing wealthy Salvadorans from losing their positions and wealth\nto unions and pro-democracy activists. Claiming to save El Salvador from communists,\nthe government quickly gained US support. The junta then carried out a terror campaign\nagainst reformers, murdering thousands. In March 1980, when the Archbishop of San\nSalvador, \u00d3scar Romero, spoke out against the violence, he was murdered while saying\nmass by government soldiers.\nThe repression led to the birth of a unified, armed resistance, led by the Farabundo\nMart\u00ed National Liberation Front (FMLN), a collection of various leftist rebel groups.\nKnowing that the rebels had the support of a large segment of the society, particular-\nly among the poorest, the government essentially attacked its own people in a campaign\n\u00d3scar Romero\nof terror to discourage anyone from helping the rebels. The US aided the campaign with\nequipment, money, and advisors. The war continued with great suffering until a peace\nagreement was signed in 1992. As in Guatemala in 1996, the solution entailed allowing the\nrebels to become legal political parties and participate in elections. This essentially switched\nthe realm of conflict from the military to the political.\nNicaragua was another Central American hotspot, especially when the US became\ninvolved. Since 1934, the nation had been run as a private fiefdom by the Somoza family,\nhanding down the dictatorship from father to son. The third Somoza, Anastasio Somoza\nDebayle, was particularly notorious for corruption and brutality, at least the equal of Batista\nin his criminal tendencies. During the 1970s, his regime was challenged by several rebel\ngroups, but the foremost was the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), simply\nknown as the Sandinistas. They had named themselves after Augusto Sandino, a leftist rebel\nin 1920s Nicaragua who fought for the rights of the poor. In 1979, the Sandinistas launched\na rebellion against the hated Somoza regime, with support from various Latin American\ngovernments; Somoza was roundly disliked in the region. When the victorious Sandinistas\nclosed in on Managua, Somoza fled by plane to Asuncion, Paraguay, where he was assassi-\nnated by communist rebels the next year.\nThe Sandinistas, though influenced by Marxism, established a social democracy\nwith multiparty elections. Although US president Ronald Reagan castigated the Sandinistas\nas a communist threat, the leftist government never presented any threat to the US, and de-\nclared nonalignment in the Cold War. Nevertheless, the US formed the Contras, a rightist\nrebel group dedicated to overthrowing the Sandinista government. The Contras operated\nfrom bases in Honduras, crossing the border to attack Nicaragua. Word soon got back to\nthe US that the Contras were terrorists, murdering Nicaraguan civilians to convince them\nto vote the Sandinistas out of office. The US Congress then cut support to the Contras and\nforbade Americans from aiding them. This led certain elements in the US intelligence\ncommunity to fund the Contras illegally. The program consisted of secretly selling weapons\nto Iran \u2013 which was against US law \u2013 and then giving the proceeds to the Contras. The\nprogram was exposed in 1986 and came to be known as the Iran \u2013 Contra scandal. The\nSandinistas were voted out of office in 1990.\nThe end of the Cold War in 1991 removed the fear of Soviet aggression from the\nUnited States\u2019 calculations. Furthermore, various peace processes in the 1980s and 1990s\nended Latin American civil wars (except in Colombia, where leftist rebels had basically\nbecome drug-producing empires; they signed a peace deal in 2016).\nThe Cold War in Latin America was a combination of two major threads in regional\n237 history: US hegemony, and the dominance of dictators as a consequence of old, anti-dem-\nocratic feudal traditions. The US was most successful in its anticommunist policies in the\nregion when it could cooperate with local authoritarian leaders \u2013 the very ones who were\ncreating the conditions leading to left-wing revolts. With the fall of the USSR in 1991, how-\never, the US lost its biggest excuse for intervening in Latin America. The last US military\nintervention was the 1989 invasion of Panama.\nOne lingering consequence of US intervention is a vein of anti-US sentiment\nthroughout Latin America. While far from universal, this feeling is strong enough that cer-\ntain leaders have tapped into it and used it to support their policies; Castro in Cuba was\nobviously one such leader, and Manuel Noriega, strongman of Panama in the 1980s, was\nfamous for stirring up anti-US sentiments as well.\nThe 1990s \u2013 Neoliberal Failure\nThe end of the Cold War led to a new phase in the global community: globalization\n(see Chapter 14). The developed world now wanted to integrate Latin America more deeply\ninto the new globalized economy. This led to a push to remove tariffs and other protections\nfor local businesses, the privatization of nationalized industries, and removal of govern-\nment regulation. The economists of the developed world promised that greater integration\ninto the world market would enrich Latin America. Many Latin American nations accepted\nthis promise and adjusted their economies appropriately. Some took loans from the World\nBank and IMF under Structural Adjustment Programs (see Chapter 9), which forced such\nneoliberal policies on them in return for the money.\nIt didn\u2019t work out. Despite new levels of industrialization in Latin America, their\neconomies were still mainly export-oriented, based on raw materials. Before long, the gov-\nernments were running a deficit, as the commodity markets, now globalized and extremely\ncompetitive, fluctuated. Many Latin American governments ended up in debt to foreign\nbanks.\nTo cover the increasing debt, some countries took emergency loans from the World\nBank, the International Monetary Fund, or private banks. They came at a steep price: the\nlenders imposed austerity measures in exchange for the loans. The receiving countries had\nto restructure their economies to guarantee that they could repay the loans. The govern-\nments were forced to cut expensive social programs, such as food or housing assistance, as\nwell as education budgets. In other words, the poor had to foot the bill for the government\u2019s\nfailure. This led to a series of violent protests throughout Latin America in the 1990s, as\nwell as some soul-searching at the World Bank and IMF, whose leaders reconsidered the\nSubcomandante Marcos and Coman- wisdom of their loan policies.\ndante Tacho in La Realidad, Chiapas,\nThe same neoliberal policies manifest in Mexico in a particularly telling way. In 1994,\n1999. Photo by Cesar Bojorquez\nvia Wikipedia Commons (Creative Mexico signed onto the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The agree-\nCommons 2.0)\nment between the US, Canada, and Mexico (which is\nin North America) was meant to remove all barriers\nto trade between the three nations. At the time, the\nUS could not sell corn in Mexico, as Mexican farmers\ncould not compete with US producers, who could\nproduce corn much more cheaply. After NAFTA was\nsigned, cheap US corn flooded into Mexico, reducing\nthe price of the commodity by 66%, putting hun-\ndreds of thousands of Mexican farmers out of work.\nThis was one cause of the revolt by the Ej\u00e9rcito\nZapatista de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional (EZLN or, more\n238 Chapter 10: Latin America commonly, the Zapatistas) in the southern state of Chiapas. The Zapatistas were already angered\nby the reversal of communal land protections along the neoliberal model; when NAFTA was\nsigned, they launched an armed revolt in Chiapas to express their anger. They seized seven towns\nin Chiapas before retreating from the Mexican army. Their protests against neoliberalism and\ngovernment corruption continues to this day through nonviolent demonstrations.\nThe Pink Tide\nThe failure of neoliberalism in Latin America led to a resurgence of left-wing politics.\nWithout US intervention after the Cold War, left-wing parties could make political gains without\nfear of violence. In the late 1990s and the early years of the 21st century, a swell of left-wing gov-\nernments in Latin America came to be called the Pink Tide. These leftists were not Cuban-style\nMarxists; that path had largely fallen out of favor since the collapse of the USSR. Rather, most\nparties and politicians were progressives operating within the context of multiparty elections.\nThese parties leveraged the failure of right-wing neoliberal policies and offered an alternative.\nThe Pink Tide included leftist victories in Brazil (with the election of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva),\nVenezuela (Hugo Ch\u00e1vez), Bolivia (Evo Morales), and a dozen other Latin American states.\nThese leftist governments set up welfare programs to reduce poverty. The programs were\nvery expensive, and taxing the rich to pay for them would lead to a political backlash. Instead,\nthe governments leveraged the rising global commodities markets at the time, exporting raw\nmaterials while prices were high. For example, Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s generous programs in Venezuela were\npaid for with oil money.\nCommodity markets constantly rise and fall. When the commodity prices again fell,\nthe governments could not sustain the welfare programs, and had to cancel them. Furthermore,\nsome of these governments leaned towards authoritarianism, censoring the media and suppress-\ning dissent; Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela and Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua were known for such things.\nWith the collapse of the commodity markets, the Pink Tide waned and several govern-\nments shifted back to the right, as people were now disillusioned with the left. Far right-wing\npolitician Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s election in Brazil was the clearest indication of this.\nStarting around 2018, another pink tide began in several countries in Latin America,\nas a backlash against the right-wing backlash to the first pink tide (which itself was a backlash\nagainst the right wing). Mexico and Argentina, for example, re-elected left-wing parties. Lula da\nSilva again became president of Brazil in 2022. The same year saw Gustavo Petro become the first\nleft-wing president of Colombia.\nImmigration\nOne of the major issues concerning Latin America and the United States has been Latin\nAmerican immigration. Due to its relative freedom, strong economy, and especially geographi-\ncal proximity, the United States is a common destination for Latin American immigrants. While\nundocumented immigration is a hot topic in US politics, the effect on the United States has been\ncomplex and, in broad terms, a benefit to both the US and Latin Americans alike.\nDuring WWII, the US initiated the Bracero Program, designed to bring hundreds of\nthousands of Mexicans to the US for agricultural work; the WWII draft had deprived the agri-\ncultural sector of workers, and the US\u2019 pre-war immigration policy had almost completely shut\nout non-Europeans. The Bracero Program continued until 1964; during that time, it also led\nto a government crackdown on undocumented Mexican immigrants who were bypassing the\n239 program. By 1970, there were well over 7 million Latinos living in the US, three times as many as\nin 1940.\nThe Cold War brought waves of Latin American immigration to the US. For example,\nthe Cuban Revolution led to an exodus from Cuba to Florida. Because Castro\u2019s government was\nan enemy of the United States, Cuban refugees were almost always accepted into the United\nStates. Refugees from the USSR or Warsaw Pact countries were similarly granted asylum in the\nUS, as they made for good propaganda. The hundreds of thousands of Central Americans who\nfled in the 1980s received a chillier welcome, and most of them entered without visas (or even\npassports) and were usually fleeing countries whose governments were allied with the United\nStates. Talk of communist agents slipping in among refugees abounded. Central American gov-\nernments were not keen to accept them back, either, as remittances (money sent back to their\nfamilies in Central America) from immigrants was a large part of their countries\u2019 income; for\nexample, in 2003, about 19% of Honduras\u2019 GNP was remittances. Eventually, about one million\nCentral Americans were permitted to settle in the US in the 1990s. In 1990, there were about 21\nmillion Latinos in the US.\nAlthough the terrible bloodletting of the 1980s ended, the neoliberal policies of the\n1990s and beyond created more havoc in Latin America; although the programs generated some\nmanufacturing jobs, particularly in Mexico, they destroyed many low-paying jobs. The poverty\nand lack of opportunity in Latin America, coupled with the danger of gang-related violence in\nCentral America, continue to drive undocumented immigration, although at a much lower rate\nthan it once was.\nLatin American immigration presents problems for the US, mainly in the form of low-\nering wages for uneducated workers in the areas where migrants are concentrated (in the US\nSouthwest, for example). But immigration also provides inexpensive labor for these markets,\nwhich is particularly important in the US; with its ageing population and decreasing birthrate,\nthe US needs more young workers. Economically, Latin American immigration is a net benefit\nfor the United States, and the negative consequences could be managed with better economic\npolicies.\nConclusion\nThe most important development in Latin America since WWII has been the increasing\ncommitment to real democracy. Democracy was delayed in Latin America by US interventions\nduring the Cold War. The US\u2019 ham-fisted Latin American policies promoted anti-communist,\nanti-democratic dictators in an attempt to stop the USSR from infiltrating the hemisphere at\na time when no such threat existed. The irony of the policy was that the brutality of the dicta-\ntorships only inspired homegrown socialists, a fact the CIA noted during the Cold War. With\nthe end of the Cold War and the coming of globalization in Latin America, leftist revolts have\nwithered, as have US military interventions.\nOne of the biggest indicators of the increasing democratization of Latin America is the\nrise of a strong civil society. New human rights organizations in the region are growing power-\nful, pushing back against oppressive systems and lobbying for positive social change. People are\nbecoming more aware of their rights and how to fight for them. This includes the indigenous\npeoples of Latin America, who have been challenging unfair political and economic policies in\ncourt across the region.\nThere is still a dependence on strongmen in Latin America, even at the national level.\nThese strongmen, however, are not dictators; when they fail to deliver for the people, they are\nbeing removed via elections. If democracy is wedded with economic growth, dependence on\nstrongmen will weaken to the point where they no longer are deemed necessary.\n240 Chapter 10: Latin America At the moment, poverty and gang-related violence are the biggest challenges in Latin\nAmerica. These are huge problems, but considering the horrors of Latin America in the Cold\nWar, it is clear the region has come a long way. If truly democratic governments can take root in\nLatin America for enough time, the results would be responsive administrations willing to make\nreal progress towards alleviating poverty and the accompanying crimes. Democracy has been\nslow to come to Latin America, but democratic forces now seem to have the momentum.\nSuggested Further Reading\nShattered Hope by Piero Gleijeses (Princeton University Press, 1992)\nHovering Giant by Cole Blasier (University of Pittsburgh Press, 1986)\nMulticulturalism in Latin America by Rachel Sieder (Palgrave Macmillan, 2002)\nStruggles for Social Rights in Latin America by Susan Eckstein (Routledge, 2002)\nGuerillas and Revolution in Latin America by Timothy P.

Nor are we able to freely and\ndemocratically elect our political representatives, nor is there independence from foreigners, nor is there peace\nnor justice for ourselves and our children.\nBut today, we say ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.\nWe are the inheritors of the true builders of our nation. The dispossessed, we are millions and we thereby call\nupon our brothers and sisters to join this struggle as the only path, so that we will not die of hunger due to the\ninsatiable ambition of a 70 year dictatorship led by a clique of traitors that represent the most conservative\nand sell-out groups. They are the same ones that opposed Hidalgo and Morelos, the same ones that betrayed\nVicente Guerrero, the same ones that sold half our country to the foreign invader, the same ones that imported\na European prince to rule our country, the same ones that formed the \u201cscientific\u201d Porfirsta dictatorship, the\nsame ones that opposed the Petroleum Expropriation, the same ones that massacred the railroad workers in\n1958 and the students in 1968, the same ones the today take everything from us, absolutely everything.\n243 To prevent the continuation of the above and as our last hope, after having tried to utilize all legal means based\non our Constitution, we go to our Constitution, to apply Article 39 which says:\n\u201cNational Sovereignty essentially and originally resides in the people. All political power emanates from the\npeople and its purpose is to help the people. The people have, at all times, the inalienable right to alter or\nmodify their form of government.\u201d\nTherefore, according to our constitution, we declare the following to the Mexican federal army, the pillar of\nthe Mexican dictatorship that we suffer from, monopolized by a one-party system and led by Carlos Salinas de\nGortari, the maximum and illegitimate federal executive that today holds power.\nAccording to this Declaration of War, we ask that other powers of the nation advocate to restore the legitimacy\nand the stability of the nation by overthrowing the dictator.\nWe also ask that international organizations and the International Red Cross watch over and regulate our\nbattles, so that our efforts are carried out while still protecting our civilian population. We declare now and\nalways that we are subject to the Geneva Accord, forming the EZLN as our fighting arm of our liberation\nstruggle. We have the Mexican people on our side, we have the beloved tri-colored flag highly respected by our\ninsurgent fighters. We use black and red in our uniform as our symbol of our working people on strike. Our\nflag carries the following letters, \u201cEZLN,\u201d Zapatista National Liberation Army, and we always carry our flag into\ncombat.\nBeforehand, we refuse any effort to disgrace our just cause by accusing us of being drug traffickers, drug\nguerrillas, thieves, or other names that might by used by our enemies. Our struggle follows the constitution\nwhich is held high by its call for justice and equality.\nTherefore, according to this declaration of war, we give our military forces, the EZLN, the following orders:\nFirst: Advance to the capital of the country, overcoming the Mexican federal army, protecting in our advance\nthe civilian population and permitting the people in the liberated area the right to freely and democratically\nelect their own administrative authorities.\nSecond: Respect the lives of our prisoners and turn over all wounded to the International Red Cross.\nThird: Initiate summary judgments against all soldiers of the Mexican federal army and the political police that\nhave received training or have been paid by foreigners, accused of being traitors to our country, and against\nall those that have repressed and treated badly the civil population and robbed or stolen from or attempted\ncrimes against the good of the people.\nFourth: Form new troops with all those Mexicans that show their interest in joining our struggle, including\nthose that, being enemy soldiers, turn themselves in without having fought against us, and promise to take\norders from the General Command of the Zapatista National Liberation Army.\nFifth: We ask for the unconditional surrender of the enemy\u2019s headquarters before we begin any combat to avoid\nany loss of lives.\nSixth: Suspend the robbery of our natural resources in the areas controlled by the EZLN.\n244 Chapter 10: Latin America To the People of Mexico: We, the men and women, full and free, are conscious that the war that we have\ndeclared is our last resort, but also a just one. The dictators are applying an undeclared genocidal war against\nour people for many years. Therefore we ask for your participation, your decision to support this plan that\nstruggles for work, land, housing, food, health care, education, independence, freedom, democracy, justice\nand peace. We declare that we will not stop fighting until the basic demands of our people have been met by\nforming a government of our country that is free and democratic.\nJOIN THE INSURGENT FORCES OF THE ZAPATISTA NATIONAL LIBERATION ARMY.\nGeneral Command of the EZLN,\n1993\nEva Duarte de Per\u00f3n: History of Per\u00f3nism, excerpts, 1951\nThe working class forces have triumphed, thanks to the humble, good men and the workers who saw in Per\u00f3n\nnot only the social reformer, but also the patriot, the man who brought security to the nation, the man who\nwould fight so that when he retired the country would be bigger, happier, and more prosperous than when\nhe found it. These men made the triumph of Per\u00f3n possible. This is why we Argentines may enjoy our social\njustice, and our economic independence which grows greater every day, thanks to the patriotic effort and\nextraordinary vision of General Per\u00f3n. We Argentines are proud of our sovereignty, and, as I said on the Ist of\nMay: \u201cWhen our flag parades along the roads of humanity, the men of the world remember their hope, like a\nlost sweetheart dressed in white and blue to show them the way to happiness.\u201d\nThis is why we, the Per\u00f3nistas, may never forget the people; our heart must always be with the humble,\nthe comrades, the poor, the dispossessed, for this is how to carry out best the doctrine of General Per\u00f3n;\nand so that the poor, the humble, the working forces, and we ourselves, do not forget, we have pledged to be\nmissionaries of Per\u00f3n; to do this is to expand his doctrine, not only within our own country, but to offer it to\nthe world as well, as a hope of the rewards always wished for by the working classes. . . .\nGeneral Per\u00f3n has defeated both capitalism and communism. He has defeated capitalism by suppressing\noligarchy, by fighting the economic forces, the Bembergs and the trusts. La Prensa, that capitalistic cancer,\nwas not suppressed by Per\u00f3n, but by the paperboys and the working force. But could the paperboys, the most\nhumble workers of the country, have confronted the powerful paper, through a strike against a business that\nhad so much support, especially from the outside, if there had been no justice, no government which would\nlet them discuss freely and an an equal basis with their bosses. Before, the poor paperboys would have been\nmachine gunned, drowning their hopes forever.\nPer\u00f3n has also defeated internal capitalism, through social economy, putting capital at the service of the\neconomy, and not vice versa, which only gave the workers the right to die of hunger. The law of the funnel, as it\nis called, the wide part for the capitalists and the narrow part for the people\nPer\u00f3n suppressed imperialist action. Now we have economic independence. He knows well all the insults\nhe will receive for committing the \u201ccrime\u201d of defending the country. Some Argentines allied themselves\nwith foreigners in order to slander him, because General Per\u00f3n was the first to make foreign powers respect\nArgentina, and treat it as an equal.\nGeneral Per\u00f3n took communism away from the masses, for justice and greater well-being replacing it with\n245 syndicalism, about which I would like to say a few words.\nSyndicalism supports justice and Per\u00f3n, but this does not mean that syndicalism participates in political\naction. It is simply a doctrine of social justice, and its creator, Per\u00f3n, is now above all politics, because the\nArgentine syndicates (trade unions), by forming syndicalism, that is, by placing themselves within the doctrine\nof justice, are authentically representing their members; that which before was discussed with guns is no\nlonger discussed; conquests are defended, which is very different. Syndicalism and the Argentine syndicates,\nwithin the doctrine of social justice, support Per\u00f3n politically; they do not support parties or party candidates,\nbecause there will never be another Per\u00f3n, despite his imitators, whose works are always disastrous. The\nworking classes, by supporting Per\u00f3n, support the leader of the Argentine workers and not the leader of any\npolitical party. Per\u00f3n is the nation, Per\u00f3n is work, and Per\u00f3n is well-being\nDuarte de Per\u00f3n, Eva. \u201c History of Per\u00f3nism.\u201d Internet History Sourcebooks Project. July 1998.

It was\na revolution faciltated by the long Cuban revolutionary tradition. [There had been major disturbances in the Ten\nYears\u2019 War (18681 878), a failed attempt to break with Spain; during the war of independence that began in 1895\nbut which resulted only dependence on the U.S.; and the revolution of 1933, which tried to restore constitutional\norder and democracy.] In the 1933 events Fulgencio Batista, an army sergeant, emerged and he dominated Cuba\nfor decades. Cuban nationalists, with some reason, blamed U.S. foreign policy for Cuba\u2019s problems.\nThe revolution in 1959 was lead by Fidel Castro\u2019s. He apparently had the support of most Cubans in his broad\nbased \u201cprovisional government\u201d. Castro turned to Cuban Communist Party for support in internal struggles. By\n1962, after the US began to give \u201ccovert\u201d assistance to Cuban exiles oppoing the revolution, Castro had adopted\nMarxism Leninism as the ideology of the Cuban Revolution. This is can be seen in the Second Declaration of\nHavana, delivered on February 4, 1962.\nWhat is Cuba\u2019s history but that of Latin America? What is the history of Latin America but the history of Asia,\nAfrica, and Oceania? And what is the history of all these peoples but the history of the cruelest exploitation of\nthe world by imperialism?\nAt the end of the last century and the beginning of the present, a handful of economically developed nations\nhad divided the world among themselves subjecting two thirds of humanity to their economic and political\ndomination Humanity was forced to work for the dominating classes of the group of nations which had a\ndeveloped capitalist economy.\nThe historic circumstances which permitted certain European countries and the United States of North\nAmerica to attain a high industrial development level put them in a position which enabled them to subject and\nexploit the rest of the world.\nWhat motives lay behind this expansion of the industrial powers? Were they moral, \u201ccivilizing\u201d reasons, as they\nclaimed? No. Their motives were economic.\nThe discovery of America sent the European conquerors across the seas to occupy and to exploit the lands and\npeoples of other continents; the lust for riches was the basic motivation for their conduct. America\u2019s discovery\n246 Chapter 10: Latin America took place in the search for shorter ways to the Orient, whose products Europe valued highly.\nA new social class, the merchants and the producers of articles manufactured for commerce, arose from the\nfeudal society of lords and serfs in the latter part of the Middle Ages.\nThe lust for gold promoted the efforts of the new class. The lust for profit was the incentive of their behavior\nthroughout its history. As industry and trade developed, the social influence of the new class grew. The new\nproductive forces maturing in the midst of the feudal society increasingly clashed with feudalism and its\nserfdom, its laws, its institutions, its philosophy, its morals, its art, and its political ideology....\nSince the end of the Second World War, the Latin American nations are becoming pauperized constantly.\nThe value of their capita income falls. The dreadful percentages of child death rate do not decrease, the\nnumber of illiterates grows higher, the peoples lack employment, land, adequate housing, schools, hospitals,\ncommunication systems and the means of subsistence. On the other hand, North America investments exceed\nl0 billion dollars. Latin America, moreover, supplies cheap raw materials and pays high prices for manufactured\narticles. Like the first Spanish conquerors, who exchanged mirrors and trinkets with the Indians for silver\nand gold, so the United States trades with Latin America. To hold on to this torrent of wealth, to take greater\npossession of America\u2019s resources and to exploit its long suffering peoples: this is what is hidden behind the\nmilitary pacts, the military missions and Washington\u2019s diplomatic lobbying....\nWherever roads are closed to the peoples, where repression of workers and peasants is fierce, where the\ndomination of Yankee monopolies is strong est, the first and most important lesson is to understand that it is\nneither just nor correct to divert the peoples with the vain and fanciful illusion that the dominant classes can be\nuprooted by legal means which do not and will not exist. The ruling classes are entrenched in all positions of\nstate power. They monopolize the teaching field. They dominate all means of mass communication. They have\ninfinite financial resources. Theirs is a power which the monopolies and the ruling few will defend by blood\nand fire with the strength of their police and their armies.\nThe duty of every revolutionary is to make revolution. We know that in America and throughout the world\nthe revolution will be victorious. But revolutionaries cannot sit in the doorways of their homes to watch the\ncorpse of imperialism pass by. The role of Job does not behoove a revolutionary. Each year by which America\u2019s\nliberation may be hastened will mean millions of children rescued from death, millions of minds, freed for\nlearning, infinitudes of sorrow spared the peoples. Even though the Yankee imperialists are preparing a\nbloodbath for America they will not succeed in drowning the people\u2019s struggle. They will evoke universal\nhatred against themselves. This will be the last act of their rapacious and cavem an system....\nCastro, Fidel. \u201cSecond Declaration of Havana, 1962\u201d Internet History Sourcebooks Project.

Kennedy: The Lesson of Cuba\n[Speech Delivered by President Kennedy before the American Society of Newspaper Editors at\nWashington, D.C., April 20, 1961]\nThe President of a great democracy such as ours, and the editors of great newspapers such as yours, owe a\ncommon obligation to the people: an obligation to present the facts, to present them with candor, and to\npresent them in perspective. It is with that obligation in mind that I have decided in the last 24 hours to discuss\nbriefly at this time the recent events in Cuba.\nOn that unhappy island, as in so many other areas of the contest for freedom, the news has grown worse\ninstead of better. I have emphasized before that this was a struggle of Cuban patriots against a Cuban dictator.\nWhile we could not be expected to lend our sympathies, we made it repeatedly clear that the armed forces of\nthis country would not intervene in any way.\n...It is not the first time that Communist tanks have rolled over gallant men and women fighting to redeem\nthe independence of their homeland. Nor is it by any means the final episode in the eternal struggle of liberty\nagainst tyranny, anywhere on the face of the globe, including Cuba itself.\nMr. Castro has said that these were mercenaries. According to press reports, the final message to be relayed\nfrom the refugee forces on the beach came from the rebel commander when asked if he wished to be evacuated.\nHis answer was: \u201cI will never leave this country.\u201c That is not the reply of a mercenary.\n...The Cuban people have not yet spoken their final piece, and I have no doubt that they and their\nRevolutionary Council, led by Dr. M\u00edro Cardona and members of the families of the Revolutionary Council,\nI am informed by the Doctor yesterday, are involved themselves in the islands - will continue to speak up for a\nfree and independent Cuba.\n...Meanwhile we will not accept Mr. Castro\u2019s attempts to blame this Nation for the hatred with which his\nonetime supporters now regard his repression . But there are from this sobering episode useful lessons for all to\nlearn. Some may be still obscure and await further information. Some are clear today.\nFirst, it is clear that the forces of communism are not to be underestimated; in Cuba or anywhere else in the\nworld, The advantages of a police state - its use of mass terror and arrests to prevent the spread of free dissent -\ncannot be overlooked by those who expect the fall of every fanatic tyrant.\n...Secondly, it is clear that this Nation, in concert with all the free nations of this hemisphere, must take all even\ncloser and more realistic look- at the menace of external Communist intervention and domination in Cuba.\nThe American people arc not complacent about Iron Curtain tanks and planes less than 90 miles from our\nshores.\n....The evidence is clear-and the hour is late. We and our Latin friends will have to face the fact that we cannot\npostpone any longer the real issue of the survival of freedom in th Is hemisphere itself.\n...Third, and finally, it is clearer than ever that we face a relentless struggle in every corner of the globe that\ngoes far beyond the clash of armies or even nuclear armaments. The armies are there, and in large number. The\nnuclear armaments are there. But they serve primarily as the shield behind which subversion, infiltration, and a\nhost of other tactics steadily advance, picking off vulnerable areas one by one in situations which do not permit\nour own armed intervention.\n248 Chapter 10: Latin America Power is the hallmark of this offensive-power and discipline and deceit. The legitimate discontent of yearning\npeoples is exploited. The legitimate trappings of self-determination are employed. But once in power, all talk of\ndiscontent is repressed-all self-determination disappears-and the promise of a revolution of hope is betrayed, as\nin Cuba, into a reign of terror.\n...The message of Cuba, of Laos, of the rising din of Communist voices in Asia and Latin America - these\nmessages are all the same. The complacent, the self-indulgent, the soft societies are about to be swept away with\nthe debris of history. Only the strong, only the industrious, only the determined, only the courageous, only the\nvisionary who determine the real nature of our struggle can possibly survive.\nKennedy, John F. \u201c The Lesson of Cuba\u201d Internet History Sourcebooks Project.

Like\nA map of the Middle East. From\nAsia, this region hosted grand empires, strong economies, and exquisite arts while\nCIA World Factbook.\npost-Roman Europe languished. During the Age of Enlightenment, Europe began\nto outshine other regions in terms of power, at least, and Western industrialization\ncompleted Europe\u2019s ascension. In the 19th century, European empires conquered\nand colonized Northern Africa, Egypt in the Middle East, and the Horn of Africa\nnations. The fall of the Ottoman Empire after World War I allowed them to acquire\nand control Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq, and Jordan. Only Turkey, Saudi\nArabia, and Iran withstood direct colonization, although the European empires\ninfluenced them deeply with the threat of invasion in the background. Middle\nEastern nationalists have always resented this imposition on their proud cultures,\nand Islamists recall the glory days of the great Muslim Caliphates and hope for their\nreturn.\nEurope lost much of its grip on the region in the 1920s and 1930s; after that,\nfour major concerns occupied the region. The first was the founding of Israel and\nthe subsequent Arab-Israeli conflicts, involving both nation-states and nonstate\nactors. The second was Arab nationalism and Pan-Arabism. The third was Political\nIslam and Islamic militantism. The factors drawing the intervention of the West\nwere the need for cheap oil, the Cold War, and Western support of Israel.\nThis chapter will examine these concerns and how they influenced events in\nthe Middle East.\n250 Chapter 11: The Middle East Israel\nFor four hundred years, the Ottoman Empire controlled the east coast of the\nMediterranean, a region known as the Levant. The region which is now Israel was populat-\ned by both Muslims and Jews, although it was ruled by the Muslim Ottoman Turks.\nAt the end of the 19th century, the political philosophy of Zionism grew in pop-\nularity in Europe. The point of Zionism was to establish a Jewish nation in the area of the\nold Israelite kingdoms in the Levant, known in Hebrew as Zion. This was homeland of the\nJewish people and culture, from which they were scattered through Europe and the Middle\nEast after various empires conquered the area over the centuries. The Jews had no home-\nland nation since the fall of the second Israelite kingdom, and were foreigners wherever\nthey lived, often leading to persecution and segregation such as the pogroms of Europe. If\nthe Jewish homeland could be re-established, claimed the Zionists, then all Jewish people\ncould live there free from persecution. The Ottoman Empire, which ruled the area (known\nto the British as Palestine) did not agree with surrendering a province of its empire to the\nZionist project.\nDuring World War I, the British government, in hopes of gaining the support of the\nworldwide Jewish population for its war efforts, published the Balfour Declaration. This\nstatement attested that British leaders,\n\u201c\u2026view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people,\nand will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly\nunderstood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of\nexisting non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews\nin any other country.\u201d\nWhen this declaration was published, British forces were on the verge of seizing\nPalestine from the Ottomans, and so were able to turn this declaration into reality. They\nhoped that this would lead Zionists to look favorably on the UK, but the problem was that,\nas the declaration notes, there were hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs living in\nPalestine, and that the Jewish population there was an ethnic minority. Turning Palestine\ninto a Jewish nation had the potential to ignite a civil war along ethnic lines.\nAt war\u2019s end, the Ottoman Empire was disbanded into its constituent parts; but\nthese regions did not get their independence as they were promised. After the war, the\nBritish and French, with the backing of the League of Nations, took over parts of the former\nOttoman Empire \u2013 these new colonies were called mandates, as if they were orphaned chil-\ndren and the Europeans their new foster parents. The idea was for the Europeans to \u201craise\u201d\nthe new countries until they were ready to be independent; actually, this was barely-dis-\nguised imperialism, though it had an end date. The British had control of Palestine, the\nZionist homeland; it was their job to administer the region until May 1948.\nGiven that the Balfour Declaration favored the Zionist project, Zionists expected\nthat the British would now create the Jewish homeland in Palestine as they wished. Zionist\nsettlers emigrated to Palestine in ever-greater numbers, but immediately clashed with\nPalestinian Arabs. The Arabs resented Jewish participation in the Palestinian Mandate\u2019s gov-\nernment and land purchases, wanting instead to finally create an independent Palestinian\nstate now that the Ottoman empire was defunct. Riots broke out between Palestinians\nand Jews, as well as against the British occupiers; in the late 1930s, these developed into a\nPalestinian insurgency against the British.\nIn response to the violence, and to ingratiate themselves to Arab governments on\nthe eve of World War II (they wanted the Arab nations on the Allied side, not the fascist),\n251 the British accepted the recommendations of a 1939 \u201cWhite Paper\u201d and restricted Jewish\nimmigration to Palestine to only 75,000 people over the next five years. Zionists saw this as\na betrayal of the Balfour Declaration, but the British wanted to prevent further violence in\nPalestine.\nWorld War II intensified the Palestinian crisis. The Holocaust convinced many\nEuropean Jews that a Jewish homeland was the only way to live in safety. Illegal Zionist\nimmigration to Palestine skyrocketed, even as British authorities tried to prevent it, and vi-\nolence in the mandate increased. International pressure for the British to settle the situation\nintensified, with the US delaying financial aid to the UK.\nWith the expiration date for the Palestinian Mandate approaching, the Americans\napplying financial pressure, and the Zionists and Arabs unwilling to agree on a solution\nfor a unified state, the British government asked the United Nations to decide the fate of\nPalestine. In September, 1947, the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine\n(UNSCOP) recommended partitioning Palestine into two states: one Jewish (Israel) and\nthe other Arab (Palestine). The Zionist leadership, believing that the two-state solution was\nonly a temporary step on the way to controlling all of Palestine, accepted the agreement,\nbut Palestinian leaders did not. As a result, the two-state solution to the Palestinian crisis\nnever emerged.\nBritish leaders knew that creating only the Jewish state would anger Arab leader-\nship throughout the Middle East; unwilling to do so, the UK decided to ignore the UN\nrecommendation and simply leave Palestine when the mandate expired in May, 1948.\nEveryone knew that this would lead to a civil war between Zionists and Palestinians, but\nthe situation was even more complicated than that. In 1945, five Arab nations -- Egypt, Iraq,\nLebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Syria \u2013 had formed the Arab League, an international coalition\nof majority-Arab states for mutual support. In solidarity for their Palestinian Arab brothers,\nthe League threatened war with any future Jewish state in Palestine.\nAfter the British withdrawal announcement, fighting broke out between Zionists\nand Arabs in Palestine, and only intensified as British forces evacuated. On May 14, 1948,\nas the last British forces withdrew, Zionist leaders declared that the nation of Israel was\nDavid Ben-Gurion proclaims the established in Palestine. True to its promise, the Arab League attacked, beginning the 1948\nestablishment of the state of Israel. Arab-Israeli War. Although Israeli forces seemed outgunned, the new\nnation survived the ten-month war, not only retaining the area circum-\nscribed for it by the UN, but also seizing about 60 percent of the land that\nhad been designated for the Palestinian state. Egypt seized land along\nthe Mediterranean later known as the Gaza Strip, and Transjordan (now\nknown as the nation of Jordan) took East Jerusalem and the West Bank\nof the Jordan River. Israel had survived its first test.\nThe Israeli victory triggered a massive demographic upheaval sim-\nilar to what followed the partition of India. About 700,000 Palestinians fled\nIsrael, often forced out of their homes by the Israelis, and became refugees\nin other nations, mainly in the Middle East. Their situation was now ex-\nactly what the Jewish situation had been before the founding of Israel: they\nwere now diaspora, a nation without a state. Israel maintained martial law\nagainst Arab Israelis until 1966.\nIn 1950, the new Israeli government under Prime Minister David\nBen-Gurion established the Law of Return, granting citizenship to any\nJew, no matter their nationality, who came to Israel. Virtually the entire\nJewish population of the Middle East, about 850,000 people, now immi-\ngrated to Israel. Add to that immigration from Europe, and the population\nof Israel boomed from 800,000 in 1948 to about 2 million ten years later.\nFor the first thirty years, Israeli governments were largely social democrats;\n252 Chapter 11: The Middle East the new nation was poor and experiencing so much immigration that citizens believed that\nstrong government intervention in the economy was required to ride out the crisis.\nBut the economy would not be the only problem the new nation would face; sup-\nport for Palestinians was still strong throughout the Arab and Muslim worlds. In 1964,\nhundreds of Palestinian nationalists gathered in the West Bank and formed the Palestine\nLiberation Organization (PLO), a militant group dedicated to the establishment of an\nindependent Palestinian state in the former mandate. It operated with a mix of bombings,\nhijackings, armed assaults, and assassination to destabilize Israel. At the time, it was the\nforemost terrorist organization in the world, and operated out of the occupied territories\n(see the Six-Day War, below) as well as Lebanon.\nArab hostility towards Israel did not end with the 1949 ceasefire. In 1965, Egyptian\nPresident Gamal Nassar nationalized the Suez Canal (see section on Egypt below). In soli-\ndarity with Palestinians, he also closed the canal and the Straits of Tinian to Israeli shipping.\nIsrael participated in the international intervention against Egypt, fighting across the Sinai\nPeninsula; but the US and the UN halted the operation.\nHostilities flared again in 1967 when Egypt and Syria collaborated to invade Israel.\nIsraeli forces, aware of the threat and feeling pessimistic of the odds, decided on a bold plan\nto strike Egyptian air bases to ground the Egyptian air force before the war began. This\nwould give them a critical advantage in the war, though it would also break international\nnorms by striking first. They made the pre-emptive strike on June 5, 1967. The plan worked;\nin the subsequent ground war, Israel defeated Egypt and Syria in only six days (leading to\nthe war\u2019s moniker, the Six-Day War). Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria, the West\nBank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip from Egypt.\nIsrael returned the Sinai Peninsula but continues to occupy the other areas to this day; they\nare known as the Occupied Territories and are a source of contention in Israeli-Arab rela-\ntions. Israeli troops seizing the Golan\nHeights in the Six-Day War.\nThe final Arab-Israeli war came in 1973. Syria and Egypt simultaneously attacked\n253 Israel on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar. The Yom Kippur War was the\nmost serious military challenge Israel ever faced, though the young nation rallied and won\nthe contest. The war brought two major changes.\nOPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) is a consortium of\nmainly (but not exclusively) Arab nations which depend on oil exports for their income; the\npoint of the consortium is to collaborate on production targets to manipulate the price of\noil to their advantage. Since OPEC comprises mainly Arab nations, the consortium stood\nin solidarity with Syria and Egypt and embargoed eight nations supporting Israel. The em-\nbargo lasted five months and raised the cost of oil about 300 percent, triggering a global\nrecession. Only American diplomatic efforts ended the crisis.\nThe second change was a tenuous peace. Anwar Sadat, the President of\nEgypt, recognized that Arab nations would not be able to destroy Israel; the Israelis\nrealized that, unless it achieved a lasting peace with Arab nations, it would always\nbe in danger of attack. In 1979, Egypt formally recognized the state of Israel, mak-\ning any unprovoked future attack a violation of international law. Israel agreed to\nend its occupation of the Gaza Strip, Golan Heights, and West Bank, but this agree-\nment has never been carried out despite much negotiation and planning. Sadat paid\nfor this peace treaty with his life; he was assassinated in 1981 by Muslim fundamen-\ntalists who viewed him as a traitor.\nWhile the Arab-Israeli wars had ended, Arab nationalists and Muslim fundamen-\ntalists continued their campaign against Israel. In 1982, Israel invaded southern Lebanon\nto oust PLO militants operating there. In 1987, a series of demonstrations and riots by\nPalestinians in the still-occupied territories, known as the intifada, lasted four years.\nIn 1993, Israel and the PLO signed the Oslo Accords to defuse the Palestinian\nsituation. The accords established the Palestinian National Authority, administering the\nPalestinian autonomous regions of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The idea was that this\nauthority would one day develop into a Palestinian state in the model of the 1947 two-state\nsolution. Over the years, the peace process has stalled as extremists on both sides fight for\nmore advantageous terms. While the PLO has proclaimed the State of Palestine, the state\nlacks international recognition. And Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli Prime Minister involved\nin the Oslo process, was assassinated in 1995 by a Zionist for making peace with the\nPalestinians.\nSince the Oslo peace process has fallen apart, Israeli \u2013 Palestinian tensions have\ncontinued, with Israeli attacks on Lebanon to disrupt terrorist groups while Zionist settlers\ncontinue to build new housing in occupied territories in contravention of international law.\nEgypt and Arab Nationalism\nThe ancient land of Egypt played a major role in postwar Middle Eastern politics.\nJust as Panama had a special and not always amiable relationship with the US due to the\nPanama Canal, Egypt had a special relationship with both France and the UK due to the\nSuez Canal, completed in 1869 and operated by a joint French \u2013 British company. Egypt\nhad a been a British colony, and later a \u201cprotectorate\u201d with limited autonomy, as the British\nwere loath to remove their troops from the nation; they regarded the canal as necessary to\ntheir empire, and wanted to maintain a military presence. British control over Egypt ended\nin 1922 as a result of a 1919 anti-colonial revolution. Egypt became a constitutional monar-\nchy, but a very unsettled one, as different factions struggled for control, and the British also\nintervened, always mindful of maintaining control of the canal. It was still owned by the\nWesterners.\nAfter World War II, an old philosophy gained traction in the Arab world and\n254 Chapter 11: The Middle East particularly in Egypt: Arab nationalism. This was the concept that all ethnic Arabs share\ncultural commonalities and a proud shared history going back to the Caliphate; unsurpris-\ningly, it also calls for the removal of Western influence in the Arab world. Related to this\nis Pan-Arabism, which is similar to Pan-Africanism and was popular at about the same\ntime. It called for the political unification of all Arab states as a manifestation of Arab na-\ntionalism. Also, Arab nationalism tended to tilt towards an Arab strain of socialism, though\nit was a form that rejected Marx\u2019s atheism. The Arab League was a manifestation of Arab\nnationalism. Leaders influenced by Arab nationalism include Muammar Gaddafi of Libya\nand Yasser Arafat of the PLO. The Arab Socialist Ba\u2019ath Party, popular in Iraq and Syria,\nis deeply influenced by Arab nationalism. But Gamal Nassar of Egypt was to become the\nleader most associated with this philosophy.\nNassar was an Egyptian military officer and a fierce nationalist. He and other na-\ntionalists blamed King Farouk for the government\u2019s ineffectiveness and corruption and,\nin particular, for Egypt\u2019s humiliating loss in the 1948 war against Israel. Nassar and fellow\nofficer Mohamed Naguib founded a nationalist group within the army, the Free Officers\nGamal Nasser in 1962.\nMovement, and launched the 1952 Egyptian Revolution. This coup overthrew the king\nand created the Republic of Egypt with a secular constitution. Naguib served as the first\npresident, a role Nassar took over in 1956. The new government was based on Arab na-\ntionalism, was secular (angering Islamic conservatives, who wanted a constitution based on\nsharia), anti-Western, anti-imperialism, and neutral in the Cold War. It also tended towards\nsocialist economics in the hopes of guiding an industrialization program.\nOne of Nassar\u2019s first moves as president was to nationalize the Suez Canal, seiz-\ning it from the French \u2013 British owners. This infuriated the Europeans; France and Great\nBritain collaborated with Israel to retake the canal by force. While this coalition succeed-\ned militarily, the Egyptians had blocked the canal by sinking ships in it, and international\npressure against the invasion was swift and forceful. The USSR, supporting Nassar, even\nspoke of attacking British and French forces in Egypt, which President Eisenhower feared\nwould trigger World War III. Under pressure from both the US and the USSR, the invading\nnations withdrew, and Egypt kept the canal. Nassar became an anti-imperialist hero in the\nThird World.\nIn 1958, Nassar pursued one of the greatest objectives of Arab nationalism: politi-\ncal unity. With Arab nationalists ascendant in both countries, Egypt and Syria united into\na single country, the United Arab Republic. This political experiment was short lived; in\n1961, Syrian military commanders, disgruntled with their loss of power and influence in\nthe new state, launched a coup and removed Syria from the coalition nation, and both Syria\nand Egypt continued as independent countries.\nEgypt\u2019s failure in the 1967 Six-Day War was another blow to both Nassar and Arab\nnationalism. Nassar resigned following the defeat, but popular demonstrations supporting\nhim compelled him to return to power. He died in 1970, leaving his post to Anwar Sadat.\nWhile the influence of Arab nationalism declined after Nassar\u2019s death, his accomplishments\nremade Egyptian society. He vastly improved the economy with a strong industrialization\nprogram and expanded education. This lifted millions of people out of poverty and estab-\nlished a strong middle class in Egypt.\nPolitical Islam and Militant Islam\nIn the first decades after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, when Arab states fought\nfor their independence from Western control and dominance, the main philosophical basis\nfor Arab independence was Arab nationalism. However, the popularity of this movement\ndeclined sharply after the humiliating Arab defeat in the Six-Day War of 1967, as did\nArab socialism. Proponents of Political Islam stepped in to fill the philosophical vacuum.\n255 Rather than being based on shared Arab ethnicity or socialism, Political Islam is based on\nMuslim identity and religious law. Political Islam has many of the same objectives as Arab\nnationalism, such as resistance to Western dominance and support for Palestinians. But, as\na religious movement, Political Islam refutes secularism and replaces it with sharia, Muslim\nreligious law based on scriptures; this makes it antithetical to the Western conception of the\nsecular nation-state. Political Islam is also anti-corruption and fights secular authoritarian\ngovernments, making it a natural enemy to such dictators as Saddam Hussein (but not the\nAyatollahs of Iran). It is also anti-globalization, viewing it as a tool of Western dominance\n(see Chapter 14 for a discussion of globalization). Political Islam uses standard political\nstrategies, such as political parties, elections, and legislation to achieve its goals. When an\nIslamic group or movement abandons politics and instead uses violence in pursuit of its\ngoals, it is referred to as Militant Islam or Islamic terrorism.\nAn overarching theme in both Political and Militant Islam is a return to the glory\ndays of the Caliphate, the old Muslim / Arab empire of the Middle Ages. Adherents hope to\nrecreate a version of this empire, though their historical ideas are highly dubious. Groups\nsuch as al-Qaeda and Islamic State (known as ISIS in the US) are two groups dreaming of\nrecreating the old Caliphate.\nPolitical Islam has had a deep influence on Middle Eastern politics since the late\n1960s, but Militant Islam has been even more influential due to its dramatic successes. The\nIranian Revolution of 1979 is the foremost example of a militant Islamic victory, as the\nIranian militants successfully installed sharia government in their country. A second suc-\ncess was the defeat of the USSR in Afghanistan by Islamic forces, mainly the Mujahedeen\n(see section on Afghanistan, below). Defeating a superpower on the battlefield gave the\nadherents of Militant Islam increased clout in the Muslim world.\nAfghanistan and al-Qaeda\nAlthough Afghanistan is usually considered part of Western Asia, we include it in\nthis chapter because of its historical ties with Militant Islam.\nAfghanistan is perhaps the last place one would expect to find a socialist government\n\u2013 it is an agrarian country with a highly-factionalized society, and a very religious one as\nwell. It came to socialism by accident. In 1973, former Prime Minister Mohammed Daoud\nKhan overthrew his cousin, Mohammed Zahir Shah, the King of Afghanistan. In order to\ndo so, Khan needed the help of an illegal communist group, the People\u2019s Democratic Party\nof Afghanistan (PDPA), which assisted the nearly-bloodless coup. Once Khan was in\npower, he then cracked down on the PDPA, since he no longer needed them. But the PDPA\nhad strong links to the Afghani military, so were able to execute a coup against Khan in\n1978; this was known as the Saur Revolution, and had the unlikely consequence of turning\nthis devout Muslim nation into a socialist state, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.\nNur Muhammad Taraki of the PDPA was named prime minister.\nWhile this did not displease the Soviets, who always appreciated a socialist state on\ntheir borders, the Soviets warned the PDPA not to institute socialist reforms, so as not to\nantagonize the population. The PDPA na\u00efvely and arrogantly barreled ahead anyway; they\npromoted atheism, closed most of the mosques, made the men shave their beards in viola-\ntion of religious laws, allowed women to go to school, and so on. These changes immediate-\nly provoked an armed uprising against the PDPA government by groups calling themselves\nMujahideen (soldiers of God).\nAs the civil war took shape, members of the factionalized PDPA fought each other\nfor control of the party. The foreign minister, Hafizullah Amin, executed a coup against\nTaraki in September 1979, killing him. Amin could not suppress the Mujahideen; his forces\nkilled tens of thousands and persecuted anyone disloyal to the government, but the rebels\n256 Chapter 11: The Middle East soon numbered in the hundreds of thousands, far more than the Afghan army could handle.\nFurthermore, the Carter administration in the US sent arms and equipment to assist the\nmujahideen in their struggle against the socialists.\nAmin turned to the USSR for military assistance. When the revolt began, the Soviets\nbalked at intervening; but after the Iranian Revolution of 1979, they reconsidered, fearing\nthat the Iranians would export their revolution to Afghanistan and then send militants into\nthe bordering Muslim-majority republics of the USSR (Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and\nTajikistan). In December 1979, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan with the intention of not\nonly crushing the Mujahideen, but also replacing the Amin administration with a more\ncapable one. One hundred thousand Soviet troops stormed the country and killed Amin in\nhis palace.\nPresident Carter of the US believed that the invasion of Afghanistan represented\nthe start of a Soviet move to take Iran (it wasn\u2019t) and sent yet more aid to the mujahideen.\nThe Soviets, despite hard fighting which included war crimes, were unable to suppress the\nrebels. After Gorbachev took office (see Chapter 13), he decided to pull out of Afghanistan\nand leave a socialist government behind, which the USSR did in 1989.\nThe mujahideen took Afghanistan in 1992 from the socialists after the USSR evac-\nuated. The mujahideen were fragmented and unable to rule the country; they deteriorated\ninto bandits, robbing the population. Millions of Afghanis had left the country during the\nwar, most of them to refugee camps in Pakistan. The young Afghani students in the madiris\n(conservative religious schools) in Pakistan decided to retake their homeland from the mu-\njahideen and install an Islamic republic under sharia law. With the help of Pakistani forces,\nthe Taliban (from talib, or student, in Pashto) launched their invasion of Afghanistan and\ntook Kabul in September 1996.\nThe Taliban, at first popular, soon lost the peoples\u2019 support due to their harsh rule.\nThey abolished all women\u2019s rights and forbade dancing, singing, sports, alcohol, radio, and\nTV. They often publicly executed those who violated these rules. Their regime came to an\nend in 2001 after the US invasion of Afghanistan in order to capture Osama bin Laden and\ndismantle the al-Qaeda network in the country in the wake of the September 11 attacks.\nThere are two important things to remember about both political and militant\nIslamic groups. The first is that they are very fragmented, with widely-differing ideologies, President Ronald Reagan meeting\nwith mujahideen fighters at the\nand often fight each other. For example, the Taliban and Iranian regimes, while both Islamic\nWhite House in 1983. From the\nfundamentalists and based on sharia, had very different ideologies and nearly went to war Reagan Presidential Library.\nwith each other in the 1990s. Second, it must be remembered that very few Muslims in the\nMiddle East or elsewhere are of the extremist, militant bent of al-Qaeda or the Taliban. In\nfact, the most common target of militant Islamic groups are not Americans, Europeans, or\nIsraelis, but moderate Muslims who do\nnot agree with their fundamentalism.\nFor example, al-Qaeda and the Muslim\nBrotherhood tried to assassinate the\nPresident of Egypt, Hosni Mubarak,\nbecause he led and supported a sec-\nular state in the Middle East instead\nof one based on sharia. US President\nGeorge Bush Jr. tried to tie al-Qaeda\u2019s\nSeptember 11, 2001 attacks to Iraq, a\nvery dubious claim, since al-Qaeda\ndisapproved of Hussein\u2019s secular gov-\nernment. Nevertheless, the accusation\n257 was used as a pretense for the 2003 US invasion of Iraq which finally ended Hussein\u2019s rule\n\u2013 ironically, too, as collaborating with al-Qaeda was one of the few crimes that the dictator\nhad not committed.\nIran\nAnother example of militant Islam can be found in Iran, but one must examine\nIranian grievances with the West to understand its influence. The source of contention be-\ntween the West and Iran was originally the Abadan Oilfield in Iran, which was owned by\nthe Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. This British company was a partially-nationalized cor-\nporation established to extract oil from Iran after it was discovered by a British expedition\nin 1909. Since the UK lacks oil reserves, and oil is a critical strategic asset, the British were\nadamant about retaining the Iranian oilfield.\nThe Iranian people and government long resented this arrangement; the shah\n(king) of Iran (which was still referred to as Persia at the time), Mozzafar al-Din, was paid\na large lump sum and promised sixteen percent of company profits for the concession (per-\nmission to operate in Iran). The British treated its Iranian workers poorly and was known\nto be under-reporting its profits in order to cheat the Iranian people of even their sixteen\npercent, although they were making about one hundred million pounds a year from the\nAbadan fields. They also promised to build schools and hospitals in Iran to help the people,\nbut failed to do so.\nThe British, in conjunction with the USSR, also invaded Iran in August 1941. The\ngoal was to secure the Iranian oil fields \u2013 the shah at the time, Reza Shah Pahlavi, was\nthought to be pro-fascist \u2013 and to use Iran as a corridor to ship American Lend-Lease\nsupplies to the USSR. The British forced the Shah to abdicate in favor of his young son,\nMohammad Reza Pahlavi. The shah would continue to grant the British a monopoly on\nIranian oil.\nChange finally came in 1951. The new Iranian Prime Minister, nationalist\nMohammad Mosaddegh, was ordered by the Iranian parliament to nationalize the British\noilfields. The shah was in a difficult political situation. He was attempting to modernize and\n\u201cEuropeanize\u201d Iran to turn it into a regional power, and needed the oil money to continue\nhis modernization plan, but doubted the Iranians could run it profitably without British\ntechnicians. Mosaddegh and his nationalist comrades were growing very popular and pow-\nerful, and he feared a coup if he resisted them.\nHe was saved by the British and Americans. MI-6 (British foreign intelligence)\nand the CIA collaborated to orchestrate a coup against Mosaddegh in 1953. The British\nwanted their oil back, and the Americans were concerned that the leftist Mosaddegh would\nallow the Soviets to access Iranian oil. The coup arrested Mosaddegh and his nationalist\ncolleagues and the shah installed pro-Western General Fazlollah Zahedi as Prime Minister.\nZahedi approved a new concession to a British / US consortium, and the oil again flowed to\nthe West. Mosaddegh lived the rest of his life under house arrest and his political allies were\ntortured and executed.\nThe shah now intensified the modernization program, known as the White\nRevolution. Using Iran\u2019s vast oil wealth, he pursued industrialization and tried to improve\nthe lot of the rural poor with land redistribution. Furthermore, and more controversially,\nhis modernization plans included Western human rights, such as women\u2019s suffrage and\nsecular government. These changes angered the wealthy rural landlords, who lost land and\ninfluence in the redistribution, and the Islamic clergy, who viewed the social changes as\nantithetical to their conservative interpretation of Islam. Also, the shah did not mean for\n258 Chapter 11: The Middle East the White Revolution to include democracy. He suppressed critics of his regime, imprisoning\nor executing them, even traditional religious authorities. The shah exiled his greatest religious\ncritic, the Ayatollah [a high-ranking Shiite cleric] Ruhollah Khomeini, in 1964.\nThe conflicts developed into the Iranian Revolution in 1978, with demonstrations and\nriots against the shah. The shah went into exile for his safety, and Ayatollah Khomeini returned\nto Iran in February 1979. Guerillas and rebels overwhelmed loyal military units, causing other\nunits to declare themselves neutral and await the outcome of the fighting. In April, a national\nreferendum chose to create an Islamic republic with laws based on sharia and led by religious\nleaders. The Ayatollah Khomeini was appointed the Supreme Leader of the nation. The coun-\ntry retained a parliament and elected a president, but the Supreme Leader and his Council of\nGuardians (all religious figures) held all executive power, and could even choose who was al-\nlowed to run for political positions.\nVarious groups opposed to the revolution \u2013 including leftists, secularists, ethnic Kurds,\nand even some Islamic groups \u2013 fought back, but were all suppressed with considerable loss of\nlife. The new regime also alienated the Americans with an attack on the US embassy in Tehran.\nIn October, 1979, the shah was admitted into the United States for cancer treatment, angering\nIranian revolutionaries who thought that the US might also try to return the shah to power. To\nprevent another CIA coup in the vein of 1953, on November 4, a group of Iranian religious stu-\ndents occupied the US embassy and took the staff hostage in contravention of international law.\nAlthough the Ayatollah did not know the attack was planned, he decided to accept it as it proved\nto be very popular with the Iranian people, who viewed the US as a supporter of the shah. The\nAyatollah now began to denounce the US as the \u201cGreat Satan\u201d in speeches, and war seemed likely.\nAn American hostage rescue mission failed, with the aircraft crashing in the desert. Finally, after\n444 days, the Iranian government reached an agreement with the US and released the hostages,\nbut the animosity between the two nations continued to simmer.\nIn 1980, the dictator of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, decided to take advantage of the chaos\nin Iran and tried to seize Khuzestan, an oil-rich Iranian province bordering Iraq and hosting\na large Arab population. [Note that the Iranians are not Arabs; their ethnic group is Persian.\nThey speak Farsi, not Arabic.] While the invasion took the Iranians by surprise, they quickly\nrallied and repulsed the attack. They managed to push into Iraq itself, the Ayatollah dreaming of\nexporting his Islamic revolution into the Arab world. This worried both the US and the USSR;\nthey did not want Iran to control the Iraqi oil fields or be in a position to threaten Saudi Arabia.\nThe US had embargoed Iraq as a state supporter of anti-Israeli terrorism. Now the US lifted its\nembargo, allowing Hussein to buy the necessary equipment to produce chemical weapons. With\nhis new chemical arsenal, Hussein stopped the Iranian assault and held on until the two sides,\nexhausted by the war, signed a peace treaty in 1989. The war had cost the Iranians upwards of\na million lives; furthermore, a 1988 Iranian campaign to eliminate political opposition at home\nkilled another 30,000 people. Saddam Hussein remained in power and next invaded and an-\nnexed neighboring Kuwait in 1990, only to have his troops ejected from the country in 1991 by\nUS forces.\nIraq was not the only target of Iranian jihad, their crusade to export their fundamentalist\nrevolution. Iran also sponsored terrorist groups throughout the Middle East with the intention\nof overthrowing secular governments, converting them to theocracies allied with Iran, and also\nof destroying Israel. Hezbollah, a terrorist group dedicated to eliminating Israel, is one such\norganization. The US and several other countries consider Iran a supporter of terrorism.\nThe Ayatollah died in June 1989, and had ensured a transition of government. Ali\nKhamenei, the president of Iran, was made Supreme Leader, and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani,\na moderate conservative, became the new president. The pair, while sometimes at odds, worked\ntogether to repair the economic damage from the war, international embargoes, and Ayatollah\n259 Khomeini\u2019s neglect. They had some success in this respect. Also, they moderated the strict\nreligious rules which rankled the more educated urban citizens, particularly women and\nthe youth. The youth of Iran were too young to remember the hated shah; while the older\ngenerations still appreciated the Ayatollah Khomeini for the revolution and gave his gov-\nernment their loyalty, the younger generations simply resented the restrictions the govern-\nment placed on them. They translated their opposition into the 1997 election of reformist\nMohammad Khatami as the new president. Khatami\u2019s attempts at social reform met with\nstiff opposition from Iranian conservatives, who blocked his efforts and repressed dissent.\nA hardliner, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, became the next president in 2005. From 2001 to\n2006, human rights protests broke out sporadically through the country, only to be sup-\npressed by the government.\nIt was during Ahmadinejad\u2019s tenure that tensions grew regarding the Iranian nu-\nclear program. The Iranians had been developing nuclear power plants in the 1950s with\nthe help of the United States; as part of the program, the Iranians were not permitted to\nbuild nuclear weapons, and were required to submit to inspection by the International\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) at the United Nations to demonstrate compliance. After\nthe Iranian Revolution, the US ceased to assist Iran, and the program continued clandes-\ntinely. The chief problem for the West is that, if a nation can enrich uranium for use in\npower plants, it can also enrich it to levels pure enough create nuclear weapons.\nBy 2007, the US intelligence community was certain that Iran was running a nucle-\nar weapons development program in contravention of international treaties. Iran denied the\naccusations, claiming that the program was for peaceful uses only; the government stated\nthat creating nuclear weapons was contrary to Islamic law. The UN ordered Iran to halt the\nprogram, since it was not complying with inspections.\nIn 2009, the IAEA claimed that it had no evidence of any further Iranian nuclear\nweapons research. It reversed that finding in 2019, claiming that Iran was once again in\nviolation of the UN agreement. The United States has, at the time of this writing (2023)\nwithdrawn from the UN committee overseeing the Iranian program and unilaterally em-\nIranian students storm the US em- bargoed Iran. To this day, Iran has not tested or claimed to have a nuclear weapon but, given\nbassy in Tehran, November 1979. The\nits current nuclear technology, could probably create one very quickly if it wanted. And Iran\nsign at the right shows the Ayatollah\nKhomeini. has also developed missiles capable of delivering a nuclear warhead across the Middle East\nand perhaps as far as Europe.\nThe Arab Spring\nThe most important\nevent in recent Middle\nEastern history is the Arab\nSpring, a region-wide\nwave of pro-democracy\nand anti-authoritarian\nprotests. The Middle East\nis infamous for its corrupt,\nautocratic governments,\nwhich lead to weak eco-\nnomic systems where the\n260 Chapter 11: The Middle East elites are able to acquire great wealth and influence through bribery, embezzlement, and\nnepotism, leaving little for everyone else. The Arab Spring began in Tunisia in December\n2010, with the protest of a single person. Mohamed Bouazizi, a young street vendor, set\nhimself on fire in response to police abuse and died soon after. This public demonstration\nserved as the catalyst for nationwide protests, since anger at authoritarianism and corrup-\ntion already simmered. The government of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali attempted\nto suppress the protests with a combination of violent repression and economic reforms.\nThe demonstrators demanded nothing less than a democratic government and did not back\ndown. In January 2011, the president resigned and fled the country; in October, Tunisia\nestablished a democratic republic with a new constitution.\nThe pro-democracy wave swept next over Egypt, where protests erupted against\nthe government of President Hosni Mubarak. As in Tunisia, the government both offered\nconcessions and repressed protestors. The military then refused to attack protestors as the\npresident demanded, and instead demanded that Mubarak resign. This Mubarak did; but\nthe government which formed under new President Mohamed Morsi was unstable, with\nconstant fighting with the military and between political factions. In 2013, the military,\nfearing greater social instability, seized control of the government and executed several\nhundred Morsi supporters during a crackdown of opposition. It was in this environment\nthat Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a former military officer, became president in an election that\nwas boycotted by many opposition parties. Sisi\u2019s government is regarded as authoritarian,\nhaving re-written the constitution to strengthen the military\u2019s role in government and\nneutralize his political opponents. Despite his anti-democratic tendencies, his anti-Islamic\nmilitant stance makes him popular with some segments of Egyptian society.\nThe Arab Spring spread across other nations, such as Yemen and Bahrain; but only\nin Libya and Syria did it have serious consequences. In February 2011, protests broke out\nagainst the authoritarian regime of dictator Muammar Qaddafi. These demonstrations de-\nveloped into an all-out armed revolt. The government was on the brink of defeating the\nrebels when a coalition led by NATO intervened with airstrikes targeting Qaddafi\u2019s troops.\nThis quickly swung the war in favor of the rebels. Qaddafi fled the capitol, but was captured\nby rebels in October 2011 and executed. A new transitional government was formed, but it\nproved ineffective in holding the vastly-fragmented society together, and the country de-\nscended into civil war in 2014.\nA similar situation developed in Syria, where protests against the regime of\nPresident Bashar al-Assad erupted in March 2011. Unlike in Libya, the international com-\nmunity was divided over supporting Assad. The US and Western Europe opposed him, but\nRussia and China supported him and blocked all UN efforts to either pressure Assad or\nintervene militarily. As a result, weapons and advisors flowed into Syria from both sides,\nand the resulting civil war has been extremely bloody, with the Assad regime even resorting\nto using chemical weapons. The war has killed over half a million people and led to a steady\nstream of refugees, numbering over 6 million, fleeing the country.\nOnly in Tunisia, birthplace of the Arab Spring, did the movement fulfill its objec-\ntives of democracy and just government. Despite the failures, however, the Arab Spring did\nleave an indelible mark on the Middle East and inspired future movements. For example, in\n2019, protests toppled the autocratic regimes of Algeria and Sudan. Iraq and Lebanon saw\nsimilar protest movements; although these nations are nominally democratic, they suffer\nfrom extreme levels of social and political division which hamper effective government and\nthus triggered large-scale demonstrations.\n261 Conclusion\nAfter the departure of the Ottoman, French, and British empires, the nations of the\nMiddle East were influenced by several movements. That Arab nationalism should become\npopular is hardly surprising; that movement had its origins in the pre-war anti-colonial\nstruggles against occupying empires and was only intensified by the founding of Israel,\nwhich many Arabs resented as an occupation of Arab soil by foreigners. Arab nationalism\nhad much in common with African nationalism, another decolonization movement with\nan ethnic component and another symptom of the anti-Western sentiment common during\nthat period.\nIt is also unsurprising that Arab nationalism declined. First, the foreign empires\nvacated the Middle East, removing the primary irritant which birthed the movement in\nthe first place. Also, Arab failure in the Six-Day War demoralized Arab nationalists and\nprovoked much soul-searching. Finally, as we saw in the short-lived union of Egypt and\nSyria, Arab nationalism was no match for geographic nationalism and self-serving national\nelites, for whom extranational unity meant a loss of power. Notice that African nationalism\nsuffered a similar fate.\nThe philosophical vacuum left by Arab nationalism\u2019s decline was immediately filled,\nto some degree, by Islamic politics and Islamic militantism. The historical influence of Islam\nin the Middle East makes it a convenient basis for a political movement, able to generate\na great deal of credibility in the Arab world. The popularity of the movement waxes and\nwanes depending on circumstances, though it remains strong in Iran where it first gained\npower; it is also ascendant again in Afghanistan after a twenty-year hiatus of American oc-\ncupation.\nFinally, the Arab Spring demonstrated that the pro-democracy movement remains\nstrong in the Middle East, despite autocratic regimes, and can bring down major govern-\nments with public demonstrations. Still, the Middle East remains, in terms of Western\nconceptions of human rights, the least-free region of the world. The popularity of the Arab\nSpring and its effectiveness in toppling autocracies shows that autocratic governments need\nto keep their behaviors in check to some degree if they wish to remain credible. The dance\nbetween the pro-democracy movement, Islamic political parties and militant groups, and\nautocratic governments largely unconnected from any ideological commitment, is a ten-\nuous one. It is likely that the future of the Middle East will be chaotic, and that foreign\ninterest in the oil market will make intervention a compelling strategy once again.\n262 Chapter 11: The Middle East Suggested Further Reading\nWar and Peace in the Middle East: A Concise History, Revised and Updated by Avi Shlaim (Penguin Books,\n1995.

The Conference of Bandung was likewise\nconvened to stress to the peoples of Africa and Asia the great importance of solidarity and the great weight\nthey would have on the trend of world affairs when united. Today this people\u2019s Conference of ours meets,\npartly in honour of the spirit of Bandung and as a reminder of the principles and ideals it stands for, and\npartly to push it a step forward. Because our Conference is a Conference of peoples, it has been able to muster,\nnot only the countries recognized by International Law as independent units, but also those peoples whose\nstatus is a foregone conclusion, a historical fact, and a reality endorsed by the whole of mankind, in addition\nto peoples who are still trodden under the heel of imperialism in one form or another. But our Conference\n268 Chapter 11: The Middle East takes the interest of these very peoples to heart. They are the diseased organs in the body of Asia and Africa:\nconsequently they stand in dire need of the greatest of care and attention. A body cannot continue to exist with\nhalf of its structure safe and sound while the other half is diseased and decayed. . . .\nThe idea of Afro-Asian Solidarity did not emanate out of naught, so as to be born and see daylight at\nBandung all of a sudden. But before materializing as an historical event, it was an impression and an innate\nvolition instinctively developing in the mind of the colonized and the exploited-the human being whom\nimperialism had reduced to a typefied specimen of a subjugated specie and bondsman recognisable in every\ncolonized country. Indeed the idea of solidarity was deeply rooted in the hearts of those subjected peoples,\ncontinually aspiring through diverse national movements to smash the fetters of bondage and redeem their\nsalvation. In the course of time these national movements were destined to meet, to consolidate and to react\nwith one another, purposefully in some instances, but unconsciously and spontaneously in the majority of\ncases.\nIt is evident therefore, that the Bandung Conference was not a haphazard event, but rather a natural\npsychological factor which led to the awakening of the peoples of Africa and Asia and roused them from their\nslumber to solve the problem of their very existence and survival, and to resume the struggle for the recovery\nof their liberty and freedom. This awakening would have been devoid of any historical significance had it not\nmarked a point of departure towards a new progressive future, the fundamental broad lines of which have been\nlaid down by the Bandung Conference. It is up to the Peoples\u2019 Cairo Conference to reap from it, to the fullest\nextent, the benefits of the positive results which have blossomed in the political, economic, social and cultural\nfields alike. It is here that we shall necessarily be confronted by a number of difficult problems, but to find\nadequate solutions to these problems is not an impossible task, if we succeed in overcoming the first difficulty\nfrom the outset. It is a problem which comes within our own selves. It is the problem of sound and unbiased\njudgment. . . .\nNo doubt each country has its own particular problems for which she is more competent than any one else\nto gauge the nature of the difficulties they represent; but at the same time, there is not a shadow of a doubt also\nthat it is within the power of each of us to extend a helping band to his brother in time of need, in an endeavour\nto assist in solving his problems, be it only in the form of a genuine, friendly counsel or an expert advice. Thus\nit becomes evident that it is the duty of each of us to foster a double interest-an interest in his own problems,\nand an interest in the problems of others.\nIn addition, there arc problems which present a common interest to us all. They react on us, and reflect on\nall of us one and the same homogeneous picture. Consequently, our particular national problems, and the\nproblems common to us all, must of necessity go along, side by side. . . .\nThese are not the only responsibilities we have to shoulder in our Conference; for in addition to the host\nof responsibilities we have towards our diverse specific countries, there are others we have towards our two\nContinents, Africa and Asia. Besides, we have definite responsibilities towards the whole of mankind as an\nentire, indivisible unit.\nWe cannot live peacefully in a world threatened by the shadow of war. We can no longer enjoy the products\nof our hands and the fruits of our labour in a world where plunder prevails and flourishes. We can no longer\nbuild and reconstruct in a world which manufactures weapons for destruction and devastation. We can no\nlonger raise the standard of living of our peoples and stamp out diseases and epidemics in a world where\nnations vie with each other for the production of lethal weapons of massacre and annihilation. Gone for ever\nis the era where the future of war and peace was decided upon in a few European capitals, because today we\nhappen to be strong enough to make the decision ourselves in that respect.\n269 Our weight in the international balance has now become preponderant. only think of the colossal number\nof our people, our natural resources, the vastness of the area covered by our respective countries, and our\nstrategic positions. You will surely come to the conclusion that the outbreak of war is impossible so long as\nwe insist on peace, especially if we do not content ourselves with a mere negative attitude, but assume one of\npositiveness in favour of Peace. This transition from the negative to the positive is a fundamental basis worthy\nof our adoption.\nHere in Egypt we, for instance, believe in the principle of neutrality and non-alignment. Many of our\nfriends in Asia and Africa share this belief. We arc confident that by adopting this attitude, we eliminate the\nshadow of war and limit the area of conflict between the two belligerent blocks, thus creating a vast region for\nPeace, imposing its existence and its atmosphere day after day, until it prevails over the whole world. But this\nneutrality in which we believe, though it defines the principle of abstaining from entering into international\nblocks, yet it also means that we shall spare no positive effort in reconcilating these belligerent blocks. . . . It is\nthe very principle which has been stressed by the President Gamal Abdul Nasser in his speech at Port Said oil\nthe anniversary of its liberation, when be said:\nToday in Port Said we turn to the whole world demanding the corroboration of the fundamental principles of justice,\nwhich is the right to self-determination. We look from Port Said towards the whole world and demand that every colonized\nState should be granted its independence, and the right to govern itself.\n...In the name of Egypt, I address a message to the world at large, for the preservation of Peace, and the abolition of\nwar; for the removal of world tension, and the cessation of the cold war of nerves. We have seen war at Port Said. We have\nbeen hit by it, and faced its ravages and woes. But a World War, once it breaks out with its nuclear weapons and hydrogen\nbombs, will unquestionably annihilate mankind and destroy for ever our existing civilization. As a section of humanity, which\nhas been treacherously attacked by imperialistic States, we demand that atomic experiments should be abolished, and that\nmanufacture and use of nuclear weapons should be prohibited. We further press for disarmament in the interests of World\nPeace.\nThe People of Egypt who arc sparing no effort for the establishment of universal justice, equity, liberty and\npeace, welcome you as messengers of justice, equity, liberty and peace.\nEl Sadat, Anwar. \u201c Afro-Asian Solidarity and the World Mission of the Peoples of Africa and Asia.\u201d Internet\nHistory Sourcebooks Project.

He taught in the\nmajor Shi\u2019ite theological school at Qom, but was exiled for his opposition to the government of the Shah. Living\nin Paris after 1978 he orchestrated the Islamic Revolution of 1979 in Iran. He became the effective political and\nreligious leader of the country until his death in 1989.]\nThose who are ignorant must be guided to a correct understanding. We must say to them: \u201cYou who imagine\nthat something can be achieved in Iran by some means other than Islam, you who suppose that something\nother than Islam overthrew the Shah\u2019s regime, you who believe non-Islamic elements played a role--study the\nmatter carefully. Look at the tombstones of those who gave their lives in the movement of Khurdad 15. If you\ncan find a single tombstone belonging to one of the non-Islamic elements, it will mean they played a role. And\n270 Chapter 11: The Middle East if, among the tombstones of the Islamic elements, you can find a single tombstone belonging to someone from\nthe upper echelons of society, it will mean that they too played a role. But you will not find a single tombstone\nbelonging to either of those groups. All the tombstones belong to Muslims from the lower echelons of society:\npeasants, workers, tradesmen, committed religious scholars. Those who imagine that some force other than\nIslam could shatter the great barrier of tyranny are mistaken. As for those who oppose us because of their\nopposition to Islam, we must cure them by means of guidance, if it is at all possible; otherwise, we will destroy\nthese agents of foreign powers with the same fist that destroyed the Shah\u2019s regime.\nYour opponents, oppressed people, have never suffered. In the time of the taghut, they never suffered\nbecause either they were in agreement with the regime and loyal to it, or they kept silent. Now you have spread\nthe banquet of freedom in front of them and they have sat down to eat. Xenomaniacs, people infatuated with\nthe West, empty people, people with no content! Come to your senses; do not try to westernize everything you\nhave! Look at the West, and see who the people are in the West that present themselves as champions of human\nrights and what their aims are. Is it human rights they really care about, or the rights of the superpowers? What\nthey really want to secure are the rights of the superpowers. Our jurists should not follow or imitate them. You\nshould implement human rights as the working classes of our society understand them. Yes, they are the real\nSociety for the Defense of Human Rights. They are the ones who secure the well-being of humanity; they work\nwhile you talk; for they are Muslims and Islam cares about humanity. You who have chosen a course other than\nIslam--you do nothing for humanity. All you do is write and speak in an effort to divert our movement from its\ncourse.\nBut as for those who want to divert our movement from its course, who have in mind treachery against Islam\nand the nation, who consider Islam incapable of running the affairs of our country despite its record of 1400\nyears---they have nothing at all to do with our people, and this must be made clear. How much you talk about\nthe West, claiming that we must measure Islam in accordance with Western criteria! What an error! It was the\nmosques that created this Revolution, the mosques that brought this movement into being. The mihrab was\na place not only for preaching, but also for war--war against both the devil within and the tyrannical powers\nwithout. So preserve your mosques, O people. Intellectuals, do not be Western-style intellectuals, imported\nintellectuals; do your share to preserve the mosques!\nKhomeini, Ruhollah. \u201cThe Uprising of Khurdad 15, 1979.\u201d Internet History Sourcebooks Project.

The\nUnited Nations in New York\npurpose of national governments is (at best) to represent and protect the interests\nof its citizens. To do so, national governments need as much independence and\npower as possible. There is little use in taking foreign opinion into account (unless\na nation risks becoming a pariah state; see the South African example). Committing\nthe nation to obeying international treaties and laws binds a national government\nto concerns beyond its borders and limits its potential actions to those allowed by\nthose laws. That being the case, why would a nation give up any of its independence\nand power to obey international treaties, laws, and organizations?\nThe answer is that, given the right circumstances, the benefits of such\nrestrictions outweigh the disadvantages. Alliances bring security through strength,\nas long as all the parties in the alliance act rationally and in concert. For weaker\nnations, alliances may be worth the cost of binding the nation to a foreign partner.\nNATO is a fine example of this \u2013 Western European governments knew they\nhad to form an alliance if they hoped to defeat the USSR on the battlefield. This\nimposes obligations on them (such as having to defend their neighbors), but the\nnations agree that it is worth the price. International organizations like the World\nTrade Organization (WTO) can arbitrate international trade disputes by rule of\n272 Chapter 12: European Integration and the United Nations law, making the world more predictable and peaceful. Also, pledging to obey\ninternational law gives a nation credibility on the world stage, particularly when\nthey act like they really mean it; other nations are more willing to engage with a\ngovernment with a good reputation. Citizens of a nation want to believe that their\ncountry is just and good, and obeying international law is one way a government\ncan create credibility in the eyes of its own voters.\nGovernments carefully weigh and debate the costs and benefits of\njoining alliances and organizations and of signing treaties. The politics may be\ncomplicated, with different sectors of society viewing the situation differently.\nBusiness elites might want the benefits of trade laws while nationalists might\ndespise the idea of (in their view) subordinating the national interest to foreign\nlaws.\nThe end of World War II created a unique combination of factors making\ninternational organizations seem a sensible choice. The devastation of the war,\ncoupled with the potential for another one, drove nations back to the concept\nof international law rather than violence. The loss of wealth and power the\nimperial states suffered forced former enemies to ally with each other, or else\nface international irrelevance. This chapter will cover the development of two of\nthe largest international organizations born to the postwar world: the European\nUnion (EU) and the United Nations (UN).\nBefore covering those organizations, this chapter will first narrate the\nhistory of two unique European communist states which were not part of the\nWarsaw Pact at the time of that coalition\u2019s fall: Yugoslavia and Albania. Changes in\nYugoslavia were particularly consequential because Yugoslavia\u2019s breakup bucked\nthe European trend of greater unity. In those countries, division and conflict were\nthe rule, haunting Europe like the ghost of World War II.\n273 Albania\nAlbania, a small nation on the Adriatic Sea across from Italy, was occupied by both\nItaly and Nazi Germany during World War II. As in Yugoslavia, the fascist occupiers were\nconstantly harassed by communist rebels \u2013 in Albania\u2019s case, by the National Liberation\nMovement. The Germans collaborated with local right-wing groups to rule Albania until\nthe Red Army approached from the east; at that point, the National Liberation Movement\nejected the Germans and their allies and took control of the country. Notably, the Red Army\nnever entered Albania, so Albanian communism was a homegrown affair. The National\nLiberation Movement became a political party, the Democratic Front, and dominated\nnational politics by dint of its fame for having resisted the fascists. In the December 1945\nelections, the Democratic Front only allowed its own candidates to run for office, turning\nAlbania into a one-party state. The monarchy under King Zog was eliminated and a Stalinist\ncommunist state established under Chairman Enver Hoxha, a former rebel leader, who\nwould rule Albania until his death in 1985.\nUnder Hoxha, Albania became a particularly harsh communist state. It joined the\nWarsaw Pact, but was independent of Moscow. Hoxha railed against Khrushchev\u2019s criticism\nof Stalin and disapproved of his liberalization policies. Hoxha\u2019s Albania was fiercely anti-re-\nligious, autocratic, and isolated; it was sometimes called the \u201cNorth Korea of Europe.\u201d\nAlbanian \u2013 Soviet relations remained poor until they were shattered entirely\nby the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. A month later, Albania chose to leave\nthe Warsaw Pact. This was against Soviet policy and made Albania liable to invasion, like\nHungary or Czechoslovakia. But there was no land route between a Warsaw Pact nation\nand Albania, and, therefore, no way for the Warsaw Pact to invade the country, a fact which\nsurely inspired Hoxha\u2019s courage.\nHoxha died in 1985 and leadership fell to Ramiz Alia. While Alia was as commu-\nnist as Hoxha, he realized that the economy needed reforming, and so reached out to other\nnations, even Western ones, for support and trade deals. Alia accelerated reforms after the\nRomanian Revolution and the execution of dictator Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu -- he did not care to\nsuffer the same fate. The spring 1991 elections were the first free, multi-party elections held\nin decades. The communists under Alia, now called the Party of Labor, won that election,\nbut only held power for a year. In 1992, the Democratic Party (conservative) won the next\nelection, ending communism in Albania.\nThe Democratic Party next won the general elections of 1996, though the socialists\nclaimed that the elections were rigged. But it would not be politics which would instigate\nthe Albanian Civil War the next year. It was economics.\nSince the fall of communism in Albania, grifters and con men had launched\nvarious Ponzi schemes in Albania, and the country\u2019s rudimentary capitalist regulations\ncould not deal with them. Perhaps two-thirds of the Albanian people invested money in\nthese schemes, which promised from twenty-five to one hundred percent profits annually.\nPeople sold their homes to invest in these schemes and get rich overnight. Even after the\nInternational Monetary Fund issued a warning, the government refused to stop the prac-\ntice, as so many politicians owned shares in the rickety schemes.\nThe house of cards collapsed in January 1997, when the schemes could no longer\npay dividends and many of the con men fled the country with their money. The people\nrose in violent demonstration, demanding repayment from the government. The situation\ndegenerated to the point of anarchy. Military depots were looted and the country was flood-\ned with weapons. Criminals formed large gangs which fought for control of the cities and\nvigilantes fought back to protect their communities. The national treasury was partially\nlooted. As many as 2000 people were killed in the chaos. The United States, Italy, the UK,\n274 Chapter 12: European Integration and the United Nations and Germany conducted military operations to evacuate their citizens from the country.\nIn March 1997, the United Nations authorized an international peacekeeping force\nfrom European nations to enter Albania and restore the rule of law. In June and July, the\nconservatives lost the next elections and were replaced by socialists and other left-wing\ngroups. The situation had stabilized so that, by August, all UN forces left the country.\nYugoslavia\nThe bloodshed and chaos in Albania, bad as it was, paled in comparison to what\nhappened in Yugoslavia, which saw the worst violence in postwar Europe. Yugoslavia means\n\u201cLand of the Southern Slavs,\u201d an ethnic group living in the Balkans region of Southeastern\nEurope. Socially, the Balkans are quite distinctive, as the population includes many Muslims\nand most people are ethnically related to Russians. This gave Russia a sense of unity with\nthe Southern Slavs, which they repeatedly used to play \u201cbig brother\u201d to the people of the\nregion. This was one cause for WWI \u2013 when the Russian Empire mobilized in support of\nSerbia \u2013 and became an issue in the 1990s as well.\nAfter WWI and the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, three territories of the\nerstwhile empire \u2013 Bosnia, Croatia, and Slovenia \u2013 were united with the Kingdom of Serbia\nto form Yugoslavia. The new nation was conquered by Germany in WWII, but then liber-\nated in 1944 by communist partisans when German forces withdrew. The partisan leader,\nJosip Tito, established a socialist state. This communist nation was not allied with the\nUSSR, much to Joseph Stalin\u2019s chagrin. Despite the threat of Soviet invasion, Tito declared\nYugoslavia nonaligned in the Cold War. The government he created was more liberal and\nless centralized than the Soviet Union. The US and NATO were ambivalent towards the\ncountry during the Cold War, but did offer economic aid. Tito kept arguments between\nthe populations of the six regions (Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro,\nSerbia, and Macedonia) of his country suppressed; these disputes included various ethnic\nand nationalist sentiments as well as religious differences between Christians and Muslims.\nMap of the Former Yugoslavia\nWhen Tito died in 1980, Yugoslav leaders decentralized the country further,\ngranting more power to the provincial presidents.\nFurthermore, the fall of the Warsaw Pact in 1989\nremoved a major security threat for Yugoslavia,\nand people there were subsequently less interested\nin security through unity. This began a process of\nseparation that would lead to the fragmentation of\nthe country by 1992.\nThis process was not amiable; in particu-\nlar, Serbian nationalist leader Slobodan Milo\u0161evic\ntook advantage of the situation to attempt to create\na large nation built on Serbian ethnic identity.\nThis was problematic because many Serbs lived in\nother provinces; as in other nationalist projects,\nMilo\u0161evi\u0107 demanded that those areas become\npart of Serbia, just as Hitler had demanded parts\nof Europe be absorbed into the Third Reich to re-\nunite all ethnic Germans. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 leveraged his\npolitical position to gain control over the Yugoslav\nPeople\u2019s Army (JNA); since communism was\nfailing as a unifying philosophy in Yugoslavia,\nMilo\u0161evi\u0107 replaced it with Serb nationalism and\n275 made it the purpose of the army. Non-Serbs deserted the army, leaving it a mainly Serbian\ninstrument.\nMilo\u0161evi\u0107 and other Serb nationalists announced a new nation, the Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia, formed by a union of Serbia and Montenegro. They claimed that\nthis nation was the successor state to the old Yugoslavia, but it only served as another tool\nfor Serb nationalism, sending weapons and assistance to rebellious Serb communities in\nother provinces. The international community did not recognize the new state, but it sur-\nvived until 2006, when it fractured into its two constituent nations, Serbia and Montenegro.\nThe West, at first, did not respond to the potentially explosive situation of aggres-\nsive ethnic nationalism coupled with military force. The West was focused on the decay of\nthe Warsaw Pact and devoted too little attention to Yugoslavia. US leaders feared the frag-\nmentation of Yugoslavia would create countries too small to be economically viable, and\nthat the breakup would inspire separatists in other countries. Still, both Western Europe\nand the US waited and watched; no one wanted to commit to a unified Yugoslavia even as it\nwas collapsing.\nThe fragmentation of the country led to seven conflicts, known collectively as the\nYugoslav Wars, from 1991 to 2001. The province of Slovenia declared full independence\nfrom Yugoslavia in June 1991. This triggered a ten-day intervention by the Yugoslav People\u2019s\nArmy against the breakaway republic, but negotiations including other European powers\nquickly ended the conflict with fewer than one hundred people killed, and Slovenia retained\nits independence. Unfortunately for the rest of the former Yugoslavia, this was the shortest\nof the Yugoslav wars.\nCroatia suffered much worse. Serb nationalists there established a breakaway in-\ndependent state, supported by Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and the JNA. Croats living in the new Serb state\nwere driven out or killed. A UN-brokered ceasefire did not last long. By mid-1995, the\nCroats had rallied and recaptured most of their country, except for the area protected by\nUN peacekeepers; that area were re-integrated with Croatia in 1998, and Croatia remained\nan independent state.\nTwo other Yugoslav wars were notable. The first took place in the province of\nBosnia and Herzegovina, which declared its independence from Yugoslavia in early 1992.\nThe Bosnian War which followed was fought between Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims), who\nwanted to preserve the present state of an independent country, Bosnian Serbs who wanted\nto create a Serbian ethnic enclave in the new country, and Croats who sought more territory\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina. The war saw terrible abuses and ethnic massacre, mainly at the\nhands of Bosnian Serb nationalist Radovan Karad\u017eic, who sought to wipe out all Bosniaks\nand give their land to Serbs. NATO launched airstrikes against Serb forces to prevent\nethnic cleansing, bringing Western Europe into the Yugoslav fray. The war finally ended in\nDecember 1995 with the Dayton Agreement, which created an autonomous Serb territory\nwithin Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nThe second important Yugoslav war was in Kosovo, a province of Milo\u0161evi\u0107\u2019s\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia. In the early 1990s, Milo\u0161evi\u0107\u2019s Serb nationalist government\npersecuted the ethnic Albanians living in Kosovo, censoring Albanian-language media\nand firing Albanian public servants and teachers. This led to an insurgency by Albanian\nKosovars (the Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA) who killed Serb policemen and soldiers\nin the hope that NATO would intervene in the conflict and stop the persecution. NATO\ndid suggest a treaty which would allow its troops into Kosovo to act as peacekeepers, but\nMilo\u0161evi\u0107 rejected the plan. Unwilling to commit ground troops to the conflict, NATO, led\nby the US, bombed Serb targets in Kosovo and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to dis-\nsuade Milo\u0161evi\u0107 from continuing his persecution of ethnic Albanians. After two and a half\nmonths, the Serbs agreed to allow a UN peacekeeping force to enter Kosovo and administer\nthe country.\nBy their conclusion in 2001, the Yugoslav Wars had killed approximately 140,000\n276 Chapter 12: European Integration and the United Nations people. Two and a half million people were refugees (those who fled their country for\nsafety) and another two million internally displaced (fled to another part of their country).\nIt was the greatest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II and one of the greatest in\nhistory. The wars included not just dead and wounded by combat, but also rape, torture,\nand murder of civilians as tools of ethnic cleansing. CIA researchers concluded that ninety\npercent of the massacres and other atrocities were committed by Serbian nationalist forces.\nThe United Nations realized that allowing these war crimes to go unpunished\nwould only inspire other such events. In response, it established the International Criminal\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) to try those accused of war crimes in the\nYugoslav Wars. Several Bosniak, Croat, and Albanian Kosovars were convicted of crimes\nat the ICTY, but most of the defendants were Serb nationalists. Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 himself\nwas detained in 2002, and stood trial for sixty-six counts of crimes against humanity, war\ncrimes, and genocide in the Yugoslav wars. He died in custody in 2006 before the trial could\nbe concluded. Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107, the infamous Bosnian Serb leader, was convicted of geno-\ncide.\nThe European Union\nPostwar Europe was in desperate shape. Physically, mentally, and socially shattered,\nEurope badly needed rebuilding. The task was beyond any single European nation, but\nperhaps not all of them together. And the postwar drive to prevent yet another major war\nwould also require a stronger sense of community.\nWestern leaders feared that European poverty would lead to political success for\nsocialists, be they local parties or Soviet invaders. They did not want to leave their defense\nagainst the USSR entirely in the hands of the United States, as it would make the Americans\ntoo influential in Europe; the US might use its advantage to extort the Europeans.\nFurthermore, imperial powers now needed to adjust their economies to decolonization,\nas they could no longer depend on colonies for their wealth, and economic integration in\nEurope was a possible solution. In any case, Europeans realized that, if they did not join in\nsome kind of union, their continent would always be second-fiddle to the two remaining\nsuperpowers. Finally, the US pushed European integration as part of the Marshall Plan, the\nAmerican economic assistance program for Europe. Since it was intended to lift all Western\nEurope out of poverty, the Marshall Plan demanded that European nations collaborate on\neconomic integration if they wanted the money. Europe badly needed US assistance, so eco-\nnomic integration was, at least partially, forced on them.\nEuropeans were also tired of the national rivalries which had brought about the\nworld wars and sought ways to heal the wounds, lest they lead to yet another catastrophic\nwar. Although many clamored for punishing the German people, others realized that re-\nvenge would only precipitate another war. Other than economic integration, what would be\nthe guiding philosophy around which Europeans could rally, to overcome the divisions of\nethnocentrism and nationalism? The rising force in Europe, and the world, at the time was\nhuman rights. Human rights were, according to the Allies, the reason why World War II\nwas fought; it was consequently a cornerstone of the founding of the United Nations (see\nbelow). Modern concepts of human rights are (according to Europeans) a Western creation,\nwith their roots in Greek philosophy and the Age of Enlightenment. Since the Soviets did\nnot follow all the Western concepts of human rights, it was also a good way for Westerners\nto distinguish themselves from the communists and claim moral superiority.\nTherefore, the movement towards European integration had both economic and socio-po-\nlitical motivesGiven that integration would require negotiation and compromise among\nformer combatants, it was bound to be a slow, complicated, and often contentious project.\nThe first substantive step towards European integration was the Council of Europe,\n277 a multinational organization established in 1949 to protect human rights, democracy, and\nrule of law in Europe. Since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights had been estab-\nlished at the United Nations the previous year (see below), the Council already had an ac-\ncepted standard of human rights from which to work.\nThe first important economic integration was the founding of the European Coal\nand Steel Community (ECSC) in 1952. The purpose of the organization was to form a\ncommon market for coal and steel products among its member nations, which originally\nincluded France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, but\nexpanded as integration spread in Europe. The point of a common market is for countries\nto join forces, acting as a single producer, buyer, and seller for the advantages it brings. The\ncommon market eliminates internal barriers to trade while imposing tariffs on outsiders; it\nalso controls prices, production targets, and many other aspects of the industries involved.\nThe UK government did not believe that such a common market would benefit its nation,\nand, therefore, did not join at the time.\nThe next step in integration was EURATOM, a multinational effort to develop\natomic energy in Europe and thus split the costs and benefits of research. Even more con-\nsequential was the 1957 founding of the European Economic Community (EEC). This\nexpanded on the idea of a common market, but far beyond coal and steel; it would include\nall trade and labor markets, banking, transportation, and customs regulations. A major\nhurdle for integration, however, was French President Charles de Gaulle (1958 \u2013 1969), a\nconservative nationalist who wanted to use the EEC to further France\u2019s national aims, or at\nleast prevent it from hindering them. De Gaulle pushed for EEC policies benefiting France\nover other nations, and even boycotted EEC meetings for six months until the organization\npromised to compromise with him. Worse yet, de Gaulle prevented the UK from joining\nThe 27 nations of the European the common market. In 1963 and 1967, the UK finally applied to join the EEC, and France\nUnion, 2023. vetoed the request; de Gaulle wanted to remain the most powerful player in the EEC, and\nthus guide its policies in directions useful to France, but the entrance of the powerful UK\n278 Chapter 12: European Integration and the United Nations would diminish France\u2019s influence. It wasn\u2019t until de Gaulle left the presidency in 1969 that\nthe UK could join the EEC, which it did in 1973. The ECSC, EURATOM, and the EEC were\nmerged in 1967 to form the European Communities, bringing all their spheres under a\nsingle governing body.\nAlthough there were both benefits and disadvantages involved for countries of the\nEuropean Communities, the twelve members felt that it was worth the effort, because in\n1992 they expanded the common market to its current form, the European Union (EU).\nEstablished by the Maastricht Treaty, the EU absorbed the European Communities and\ntheir functions while adding new ones: common European citizenship, a single common\ncurrency (the euro), and shared foreign and security policies, among other things. The EU\npresently represents about 450 million people, pooling their economic resources and pro-\ntecting their civil liberties.\nThe biggest problem for the EU is decision-making. Each of the 27 member nations\nhas its own unique economy and society; how can these members decide on policies ac-\nceptable to all of them? The Maastricht Treaty established a complicated democratic system\nwith various organs. The four primary ones are the European Council (composed of heads\nof states of member countries), the Council of the EU (the main decision-making body,\ncomposed of a rotating membership of member state ministers), the European Parliament\n(composed of officials elected by EU voters), and the European Commission (composed\nof commissioners nominated by their heads of state and confirmed by the EU Parliament).\nThe purpose of this system is to combine direct democracy, as evidenced by voting for EU\nParliament members, with indirect democracy (representation by heads of state who were\nelected in their own countries). This gives a voice to both EU individuals and their member\ngovernments, but it is a complex and often unwieldy system.\nCountries must meet certain criteria for joining the European Union, to guarantee\nthat they can uphold their responsibilities to the union. Countries must be functioning de-\nmocracies with respect for human rights, must have a strong and stable market economy,\nand must be willing and able to abide by EU laws and treaties. Countries which want to join\nthe EU, but do not meet these criteria, must improve their situations before being allowed to\njoin.\nThe EU brings clear and measurable benefits to member states. Citizens of EU\ncountries are, for most purposes, citizens of all other EU countries. They can live, work,\nand own property in any EU country without having to be naturalized there. They also\nenjoy freedom of travel throughout the EU. EU countries maintain strong human rights\nlaws and safety standards. Most EU nations (those in the Eurozone) use a single common\ncurrency, the euro, which streamlines trade, as does the customs-free or borderless market.\nThe EU pools scientific and technological research, creating far more technological prog-\nress than individual countries could. It also provides financial and technical assistance to\npoorer member states for economic and infrastructure development. Most EU countries see\na twelve percent boost to their GDPs after joining the union.\nNothing as big and complex as the EU can be entirely beneficial; there are, of course,\ndownsides. One of them is questionable economic responsibility, most clearly revealed by\nthe Eurozone Crisis of 2007 \u2013 2013. Several EU countries suffered various financial crises\nsimultaneously, straining the union\u2019s economy. Ireland suffered a major banking crisis as a\nresult of a housing bubble; property owners and developers defaulted by the thousands and\ntheir lenders lost around 100 billion euros. Spain, Portugal, and Cyprus suffered similar\nbubbles and crashes.\nGreece precipitated an even worse crisis in 2009 when its government finally came\nclean about its economic state. It announced that it was running a thirteen percent budget\ndeficit, far more than permitted by the Maastricht Treaty. It had previously hidden its eco-\nnomic weakness behind shady, opaque accounting practices, but could hide it no longer.\n279 The EU and IMF responded to these crises with bailout loans to the tune of hun-\ndreds of billions of euros to cover the national budgets; but, like the IMF\u2019s structural ad-\njustment loans, these loans came at a price. They forced the receiving countries to cut their\nsocial welfare budgets, pensions, and public sector wages to trim their budgets. This caused\na wave of protests, especially in Greece where the austerity measures were worst. It also led\nto a resurgence of right-wing, nationalist, anti-EU political parties in those countries and\nacross Europe. Nationalists argued that countries which had practiced greater responsibil-\nity, like the UK or Germany, had not caused the crash, yet had to pay for the bailouts. They\nthus questioned whether the EU was a good arrangement for them, an attitude known as\nEuroscepticism.\nAnother major EU problem is refugees, especially since the start of the Syrian Civil\nWar in 2011. While most Syrian refugees settled in the Middle East, tens of thousands en-\ntered the EU illegally and applied for political asylum. This means that states on the borders\nof the EU, like Greece, have borne the brunt of the refugee crisis as immigrants arrive and\nstay there; border states demand that the EU financially support them for this reason. Also,\nnationalist groups in the EU, already angry with the EU over the austerity measures of the\nEurozone crisis, were now inflamed about having to follow EU policies and accept refugees.\nThe nationalists fear that large numbers of refugees would change the ethnic and religious\nmakeup of their countries and breed crime.\nThe greatest expression of Euroscepticism was Brexit (the British exit from the\nEU). EU laws do permit a nation to voluntarily leave the union, and pressure was growing\nin the UK to do just that. UK nationalists argued that, between the growing number of\nrefugees and the price of bailing out other EU members, membership was no longer worth\nthe price. Therefore, a national referendum was conducted in June 2016 to determine if the\nUK should leave. The vote was 52% for leaving and 48% against. True to its promise, the UK\nthen slowly prepared to leave the union, negotiating new treaties with the EU. Brexit finally\ntook place in January 2020, reducing the number of countries in the EU from 28 to 27.\nThe United Nations\nThe League of Nations, though well-intended and well-planned, failed to prevent\nWorld War II. One reason for this was the absence of the United States, which denied the\nLeague a strong partner; another reason is that collective security failed, as it required more\ncommitment than the democracies would ask from their citizens. After the war, Allied\nleaders decided to try again at international governance to prevent another world war,\nrather than abandon the idea altogether. The original idea for the United Nations (UN)\nwas President Roosevelt\u2019s. The term \u201cUnited Nations\u201d had already been used in the Atlantic\nCharter to describe the Allies during World War II, and now the same nations would estab-\nlish (and largely run) the new successor to the League of Nations.\nThe UN was officially founded on October 24, 1945. According to the UN Charter,\nthe purposes of the new organization are:\n1. To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective\ncollective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the sup-\npression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful\nmeans, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment\nor settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the\npeace;\n2. To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of\nequal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to\nstrengthen universal peace;\n280 Chapter 12: European Integration and the United Nations 3. To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an\neconomic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging\nrespect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to\nrace, sex, language, or religion; and\n4. To be a center for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of these\ncommon ends.\nTherefore, the purpose of the UN is to prevent war and other international aggression, pri-\nmarily by removing their causes.\nOrganizationally, the United Nations is divided into five primary organs. The first\nis the General Assembly, located at the UN Headquarters in New York City. This is the\nmain deliberative body of the United Nations, where any member state can bring up topics\nfor discussion. There are currently 193 member nations in the UN. The decisions of the\nGeneral Assembly are generally nonbinding on member states.\nThe most controversial part of the UN is the organ which can make binding deci-\nsions \u2013 that is, decisions about economic sanctions and war. This is the Security Council,\nauthorized to deploy military force on behalf of the UN, using troops from UN member\nstates. Military force and sanctions can only be authorized by the five permanent members\nof the Security Council \u2013 Russia (formerly the USSR), China, France, the UK, and the USA.\nNations with rotating observer status cannot vote on these issues. Notice that the perma-\nnent members (the P5) are the winners of World War II; this was done to solidify the world\norder after the war, so that the Allies would guide the world in the future. One important\npoint about the Security Council is that each of the P5 has veto power over the votes; there-\nfore, every decision at the Security Council must be unanimous to be enacted. The practical\nupshot of veto power is that most proposals at the Security Council are vetoed and never\ncarried out.\nTo understand the Security Council, one must understand the power dynamics\nof international politics. As mentioned, the purpose of every nation is to protect its own\nsafety and sovereignty, and each nation seeks the power to do so. Each nation makes a cost\n/ benefit analysis of whether to join the UN or other organizations, based on perceptions of\nwhether the organization would be a net gain for the them. For weak, poor nations, the UN\nis typically a net gain. The nation could use the economic assistance the UN provides and,\nbecause they are militarily weak, benefit from UN protection under international law and\npeacekeeping forces.\nA powerful nation like the US or USSR needs neither economic assistance nor mil-\nitary protection, but the P5 nations have privileged status at the Security Council. Without\nveto power to protect their interests, the P5 simply would not join the UN, as there would\nbe no motivation to do so. With veto power, the US can simply block any major endeavors\nat the UN which do not benefit it or its allies. The other P5 members can do the same.\nParticularly during the Cold War, this led to a situation where China and the USSR blocked\nactions proposed by the US, UK, and France, and vice-versa. Veto power is why so many\npeople think the UN is useless, unable to make decisions. But the P5 calculate that they\nwould be worse off, less influential, if they left the UN, particularly if their rivals stay in the\nSecurity Council. Therefore, they stay.\nMost people only consider the roles of the General Assembly and the Security\nCouncil. A third organ, the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), assists the General\nAssembly in promoting international economic and social cooperation and development.\nThis organ is probably the most successful in the UN, as it runs economic development and\naid programs. It is critical to establishing public health in the Third World. The structural\nadjustment programs of the IMF, as we have seen, are a more controversial matter.\nThe fourth organ is the International Court of Justice (ICJ), located in The Hague,\nNetherlands. It is the primary court of the United Nations. It adjudicates disputes among\n281 states as if they were individuals in a civil court. The court has also heard cases related to\nwar crimes, ethnic cleansing, and so on.\nFinally, the United Nations Secretariat serves as the administrative arm of the UN,\nassuring that the various organs have the support they require. It is led by the Secretary-\nGeneral of the UN.\nAside from the major organs, there are also another UN 17 institutions which carry\nout the programs set forth by the other organs. These include specialized programs like the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nMany criticisms have been leveled against the UN. Some claim the P5 is an example\nof powerful nations essentially dominating the global community by investing themselves\nwith most of the world\u2019s power, then using it to protect their own interests. For example, the\nUN supported the US war against Iraq for the purpose of protecting Saudi oil reserves, but\nthe P5 were not interested in a war to protect Rwandans during the 1994 genocide, since it\nwould not benefit their nations. Others note the membership of many autocratic nations in\nthe UN, which gives them a voice in UN decisions. The UN is also sometimes seen as an\nexpensive, ineffective organization with too little oversight.\nWhile the UN has a checkered history regarding security and peace, it has been\nmuch more successful in material assistance and public health. The UN\u2019s World Food\nProgram (WFP) provides food assistance to more than 80 million people around the\nglobe. Nearly one-half of all the children in the world receive their vaccinations from UN\nagencies. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) assists 70\nmillion people a year who have lost their homes due to war or human rights abuses. There\nis no other organization in the world equipped to handle such massive material needs. UN\npeacekeeping missions continue despite past failures; over 100,000 UN troops are deployed\nat any time to prevent conflict.\nIn the end, the UN is maintained simply because there is no alternative organiza-\ntion. The UN is the one forum in which the entire world can come together to address its\nproblems. Despite all its weaknesses, the world has decided to keep it.\nInternational security is the UN\u2019s main focus, but threat of military force is not the only tool\nthe UN has for preventing aggressive war. Of greater importance is the establishment of\nuniversal human rights, of which the UN is the primary global champion.\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights\nDuring World War II, US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt gave an inspiring\n\u201cfireside chat\u201d via radio to the American people, explaining the purpose of the war. He said\nthe Allies were fighting for \u201cfour freedoms\u201d \u2013 freedom of speech, freedom of religion, free-\ndom from fear, and freedom from want \u2013 \u201ceverywhere in the world.\u201d Thus, he transformed\nthe war from a mere amoral struggle between nations to a crusade for global human rights.\nAfter the war, the United Nations decided that a more specific definition of human\nrights was needed. The organization recognized the importance of human rights to main-\ntaining peace, stating: \u201c...it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as\na last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be\nprotected by the rule of law.\u201d If Germany, Japan, and Italy had never abandoned human\nrights and democracy for fascism, the thinking went, then World War II would never have\nhappened. If imperialism was relegated to the past, there would be no more anti-imperial\nrevolts. Without dictatorships, there could be no revolutions. Without racial discrimination,\nthere would be no genocide. Human rights, it was hoped, would guarantee peace where\nbalance of power and collective security had failed.\nIn 1946, the UN established the Commission on Human Rights to draft a\n282 Chapter 12: European Integration and the United Nations document which clarified and enumerated universal human rights so that it would apply, as\nFDR had said, \u201ceverywhere in the world.\u201d Given the differences between ethical norms and\nforms of government around the world, finding a standard acceptable to all was a daunting\ntask. The committee was chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt and included 17 legal scholars from\naround the world to include many different social voices. The primary author was John\nPeters Humphrey, a Canadian legal scholar. Humphrey wrote the initial draft, and the\nother scholars edited from there.\nAfter two years, the committee completed its work and the UN put the new\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) to a vote at the General Assembly. The\nvote was 48 in favor of acceptance and none against, with 8 abstentions (the Soviet republics\nand satellite states, plus South Africa and Saudi Arabia). The declaration is not a binding\ntreaty; it is a statement of rights, a foundation upon which binding treaties are created. From\nthe UDHR, the UN created the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and\nthe International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which are binding\nunder international law. The three documents together are known as the International Bill\nof Human Rights.\nAny statement of rights calling itself \u201cuniversal\u201d is going to draw protest. Just as\nmany Westerners are proud that the modern concept of human rights is based in Western\nthought, many non-Westerners dismiss them for the same reason. Some Asian and African\nleaders rejected the UDHR, or at least parts of it, as being inapplicable with their own cul-\ntures. Newly decolonized nations were unprepared to accept European laws and concepts\nafter they had just freed themselves from European imperial rule; they were instead inter-\nested in rediscovering and renewing their own cultures. This view of human rights is known\nas particularism, the assertion that one\u2019s own cultural norms trump any universalist con-\ncepts of rights. Of course, depending on one\u2019s role in society, traditional norms might not\nserve very well. Women who would benefit more from the rights in the UDHR than from\ntheir own cultural norms might prefer the Western model.\nSome governments of majority-Muslim nations had a similar complaint. Saudi\nArabia initially refused to vote on the UDHR on the grounds that it was not in line with\nsharia law. For example, common interpretations of sharia (and many interpretations are\npossible) forbid Muslims from leaving Islam, sometimes under penalty of death. Sharia\nblasphemy laws may be used to suppress legitimate discussions of Islam or Islamic govern-\nments. Iran rejects the UDHR as non-Muslim and therefore illegitimate. The governments\nof Pakistan and Turkey both accepted the UDHR as compatible with sharia.\nSocialist countries also refused to sign the UDHR, claiming that they were based on\n\u201cbourgeois\u201d values such as individualism and private profit that were contrary to Marxism.\nAlthough the USSR signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1973,\nit never maintained those rights in its country.\nSome nations of the global South established regional human rights doctrines to\nsubstitute for the UDHR. The Bangkok Declaration of 1993 placed greater emphasis on\neconomic, social, and cultural rights than did the individualist UDHR, because China,\nIndia, and other Asian nations considered economic development more important than\nindividual rights and did not want those rights to limit or restrict economic growth. Since\n1990, forty-five countries have accepted the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in\nIslam, an alternative document to the UDHR that claims people have \u201cfreedom and right to\na dignified life in accordance with the Islamic Shari\u2019ah.\u201d\nThis does not mean that Western governments, particularly the powerful ones,\nuncritically accept the UDHR. Human rights treaties constrict the activities of nations (if\nthey truly follow them). Sometimes, it is useful for a powerful nation like the US to praise\nand uphold the UDHR, because it may then claim moral superiority over enemy nations\nwhich do not. For example, the US government relentlessly criticizes China, Iran, North\n283 Korea, and Cuba on their human rights records, and its claims are certainly correct. It is just\nthat a powerful nation like the US will also ignore human rights conventions when it be-\ncomes inconvenient to follow them. The US has never ratified the 1976 Convention on the\nElimination of Discrimination against Women or the 1989 Convention on the Rights of\nthe Child, though most nations have. Conservatives in the US and elsewhere do not like the\nidea that their national laws are subservient to laws created by foreign entities, or that the\nUS is subservient to extranational bodies like the International Court of Justice. Since the\nP5 of the Security Council have veto power over any punishments, such as sanctions, there\nis no compelling reason for them to acquiesce. Such is power politics on the international\nstage.\nConclusion\nInternational governance is one of the most contentious issues in politics, and opin-\nions vary over whether it is worth sacrificing some national autonomy. As far as world peace\nis concerned, there is evidence that war is declining, and that international arbitration is\na major factor. There is much more evidence that international cooperation has increased\ntrade and improved public health. Since it is smaller than the UN, with a more limited man-\ndate, the EU is easier to evaluate. The fact that several countries are applying to join the EU,\nwhile only one nation has left it, seems to indicate a general enthusiasm for the institution,\neven if the enthusiasm is lukewarm.\nBut the same goes for the UN. It must be remembered that membership in the UN\nis voluntary; as we have seen more nations trying to join than leave, this again indicates that\nthe drive for unity is presently stronger than the urge for fragmentation in the international\ncommunity, despite the downsides. When it comes to problems of a global scale, the UN\nremains the only forum for discussing and confronting them.\n284 Chapter 12: European Integration and the United Nations Suggested Further Reading\nThe Parliament of Man: The Past, Present, and Future of the United Nations by Paul Kennedy (Vintage, 2007.\nISBN-13: 978-0375703416)\nEuropean Integration, 1950\u20132003: Superstate or New Market Economy? by John Gillingham (Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 2003.

The purposes of the Tribunal have been laid down in Security Council resolution 808 (1993) and, in even\nmore detailed form, in Security Council resolution 827 (1993). They are threefold: to do justice, to deter\nfurther crimes and to contribute to the restoration and maintenance of peace.\n12. The first objective is set out in the preamble to Security Council resolution 827 (1993), which states,\namong other things, that the Tribunal is \u201cto bring to justice the persons who are responsible\u201d for crimes\nperpetrated in the former Yugoslavia.\n13. The second objective is also laid down in the preamble to Security Council resolution 827 (1993),\nwhere it is stated that the establishment of the Tribunal \u201cwill contribute to ensuring that such violations\n[of international humanitarian law] are halted and effectively redressed\u201d. One of the main aims of the\nSecurity Council was to establish a judicial process capable of dissuading the parties to the conflict from\nperpetrating further crimes. It was hoped that, by bringing to justice those accused of massacres and similar\negregious violations of international humanitarian law, both belligerents and civilians would be discouraged\nfrom committing further atrocities. In short, the Tribunal is intended to act as a powerful deterrent to all\nparties against continued participation in inhuman acts.\n14. The third objective pursued by the Security Council in its resolution 827 (1993) and by the Secretary-\nGeneral was \u201cto contribute to the restoration and maintenance of peace\u201d. Being a measure taken under\nChapter VII of the Charter, in the face of a \u201cthreat to international peace and security\u201d, as determined\nin Security Council resolution 827 (1993), the Tribunal was conceived as one of the measures designed\ngradually to promote the end of armed hostilities and a return to normality.\n15. Some apprehensions were expressed lest the establishment of the Tribunal might jeopardize the peace\n294 Chapter 12: European Integration and the United Nations process. In fact, the Tribunal will contribute to the peace process by creating conditions rendering a return\nto normality less difficult. How could one hope to restore the rule of law and the development of stable,\nconstructive and healthy relations among ethnic groups, within or between independent States, if the\nculprits are allowed to go unpunished? Those who have suffered, directly or indirectly, from their crimes\nare unlikely to forgive or set aside their deep resentment. How could a woman who had been raped by\nservicemen from a different ethnic group or a civilian whose parents or children had been killed in cold\nblood quell their desire for vengeance if they knew that the authors of these crimes were left unpunished\nand allowed to move around freely, possibly in the same town where their appalling actions had been\nperpetrated? The only civilized alternative to this desire for revenge is to render justice: to conduct a fair\ntrial by a truly independent and impartial tribunal and to punish those found guilty. If no fair trial is held,\nfeelings of hatred and resentment seething below the surface will, sooner or later, erupt and lead to renewed\nviolence.\n16. The role of the Tribunal cannot be overemphasized. Far from being a vehicle for revenge, it is a tool for\npromoting reconciliation and restoring true peace. If responsibility for the appalling crimes perpetrated\nin the former Yugoslavia is not attributed to individuals, then whole ethnic and religious groups will be\nheld accountable for these crimes and branded as criminal. In other words, \u201ccollective responsibility\u201d - a\nprimitive and archaic concept - will gain the upper hand; eventually whole groups will be held guilty\nof massacres, torture, rape, ethnic cleansing, the wanton destruction of cities and villages. The history\nof the region clearly shows that clinging to feelings of \u201ccollective responsibility\u201d easily degenerates into\nresentment, hatred and frustration and inevitably leads to further violence and new crimes.\n17. Thus the establishment of the Tribunal should undoubtedly be regarded as a measure designed to promote\npeace by meting out justice in a manner conducive to the full establishment of healthy and cooperative\nrelations among the various national and ethnic groups in the former Yugoslavia.\n18. In sum, it would be wrong to assume that the Tribunal is based on the old maxim fiat justitia et pereat\nmundus (let justice be done, even if the world were to perish). The Tribunal is, rather, based on the maxim\npropounded by Hegel in 1821: fiat justitia ne pereat mundus (let justice be done lest the world should\nperish). Indeed, the judicial process aims at averting the exacerbation and aggravation of conflict and\ntension, thereby contributing, albeit gradually, to a lasting peace.\nImage Credits\n\u201cMap of the Former Yugoslavia\u201d is from the US Central Intelligence Agency.\n\u201cThe 27 nations of the European Union, 2023\u201d is from the European Union.\n\u201cEleanor Roosevelt, Chair of the Commission on Human Rights\u201d and \u201cThe General Assembly at the United\nNations in New York\u201d is from the United Nations.\n295 Chapter 13\nEnd of Cold War\nThe Fall of the Berlin Wall, As we noted in Chapter 3, the Cold War was a time of mutual obsession\nNovember 1989.\nbetween the United States and the USSR, with many other nations allied with one\nside or the other. Each side\u2019s national security strategy was based on countering\nthe other, and they spent many billions of dollars to do so. Massive propaganda\ncampaigns, global in scope, were waged to influence the world community to join\none side or the other. The superpowers\u2019 nuclear arsenals were poised for use on only\na 15-minute warning, perpetually risking global annihilation. This situation had\nsimmered tensely from about 1947, and by the mid-1980s there was still no end in\nsight.\nWhat no one expected was that this apparently intractable conflict would\ndisappear in a period of only two years. It is perhaps unsurprising that few saw it\ncoming; it would have been extremely difficult to envision such an earth-shaking\nchange at the time. This chapter is the story of why and how it happened.\n296 Chapter 13: End of Cold War Solidarity\nSome revolutions are led by military commanders (Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Minh)\nand others are led by lawyers (Gandhi, Mandela). But the nonviolent revolt which spelled\nthe end of communism in Europe was started by shipyard workers, led by an electrician.\nIt began in Poland, a Warsaw Pact nation, in 1980. As we saw in Chapter 2, the\neconomies of both the USSR and the Warsaw Pact nations were weaker than those of the\nWest. The socialist government of Poland ran all aspects of its Marxist economy \u2013 and the\nwages were poor, the rents and foodstuffs expensive. Independent labor unions were illegal\nin Poland, as they were all across the communist world (in a Marxist economy, the govern-\nment controls the means of production, but unions are meant to counterbalance the owners\nof the means of production. Since the government has complete power in a Marxist system,\nunions are therefore illegal). Poland did have a few government-run unions which were said\nto advocate for the workers, but these had no real power. Labor strikes in Poland in 1956,\n1970, and 1976 were ineffective in forcing the government to make lasting changes, mainly\nbecause they lacked centralized leadership, and instead left hundreds dead in clashes with\npolice. In July, 1980, Polish workers went on strike again to protest an increase in meat\nprices.\nThe next month, a forklift operator at the Gda\u0144sk Shipyard named Anna\nWalentynowicz was fired for distributing the underground newsletter of an illegal union.\nGda\u0144sk Shipyard workers struck to protest her firing, demanding both her reinstatement\nas well as a pay raise for all. But the protest quickly spread to nearby factories and facilities,\nwith thousands of workers now striking.\nOn August 17, the different groups of strikers sent representatives to Gda\u0144sk to\nestablish the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee (MKS in Polish). This committee was\ncreated to represent the workers of the various factories involved, which by that time was\nover one hundred and fifty and still growing. This gave the movement something it did not\nhave in the 1970s: centralized leadership, which could coordinate the group\u2019s actions and\nensure that the government could not try to appease some groups with concessions while\ncutting others out. The elected chairman of MKS was Lech Walesa, a former electrician at\nGda\u0144sk Shipyard who was fired for his role in the 1976 strikes.\nMKS distributed a list of twenty-one demands to be fulfilled in order to lift the\nstrike. Most of them concerned economic matters, such as lowering food prices and in-\ncreasing wages. But one of the demands was that the Polish people be permitted to establish\nlegal labor unions outside of government control, something unheard-of in the commu-\nnist world. Seeing the size of the strike and the damage it was doing to the already-weak\neconomy, the government decided to grant all twenty-one demands, which it did with the\nGda\u0144sk Agreement on August 31. At this point, MKS now represented about three million\nworkers.\nMKS leaders then pressed their advantage and, on September 17, transformed the\norganization from an action committee into Solidarity (Solidarno\u015b\u0107 in Polish), the first\nlegal independent labor union in the Soviet world. Lech Walesa was elected its first pres-\nident. Since it was the only legal union, and was open to all workers, it was tremendously\npopular, eventually surpassing ten million members, or about one-third of the entire Polish\npopulation.\nSolidarity leaders quickly realized that they could not achieve their economic goals\nwithout addressing politics; to that end, they began to change Solidarity from a labor union\ninto a social movement. As a Solidarity publication put it: \u201cHistory has taught us that there\nis no bread without freedom. What we had in mind was not only bread, butter, and sausages,\nbut also justice, democracy, truth, legality, human dignity, freedom of convictions, and the\n297 repair of the republic.\u201d Solidarity pursued not only workers\u2019 benefits via strikes, but also had\nseveral corrupt politicians removed from their posts. All the while, they remained carefully\ncommitted to nonviolence, to avoid giving the government a moral and legal excuse to use\nforce against them.\nThe government was not as careful about violence as Solidarity. On March 19,\n1981, Solidarity leaders attended negotiations with government officials when the meeting\nbecame heated. In response, government administrators summoned the local militia, who\nbrutally beat the Solidarity representatives and jailed them. In response, Lech Walesa called\nfor a general strike on just a four-hour warning. On March 27, between 12 and 14 million\nPoles went on strike, shutting down the entire country. Considering that Solidarity had no\naccess to the media, arranging such a strike in only four hours was an amazing organiza-\ntional feat. The government, realizing it had been outmaneuvered, quickly apologized for\nthe attacks and promised an investigation. Solidarity lifted the strike, having made a major\nshow of force.\nThe Polish communist party was at first uncertain about how to confront such a\npopular organization, and Solidarity continued its campaign. The economic situation in\nPoland continued to decline, resulting in further Solidarity strikes and protests. Finally, on\nDecember 13, 1981, First Secretary Wojciech Jaruzelski of the communist party decided he\nhad to eliminate Solidarity or face a civil war. He declared martial law, closing the coun-\ntry, shutting down the telephone systems, and putting troops into the streets. He forceful-\nly suppressed the resulting strikes, killing nine people. Security forces also arrested 5000\nSolidarity members, imprisoning them in a special facility. The next year, the communists\ndeclared Solidarity an illegal organization.\nDespite all this, Solidarity survived \u2013 by going underground. It continued as an il-\nlegal trade union, arranging strikes and other work actions, like slow-downs and call-outs.\nIt coordinated its reduced membership via hand-printed newsletters and a pirate radio sta-\ntion. Solidarity spent years in a cat-and-mouse game with the government, which arrested\nanyone suspected of belonging to the union.\nSolidarity received a great deal of support from the outside world. The Reagan ad-\nministration, the Vatican, and various unions worldwide supported Solidarity with money\nand other assistance. The West largely embargoed Poland, damaging its economy even\nLech Walesa, 1980\n298 Chapter 13: End of Cold War further. Walesa was released from prison in November 1982, but when he was awarded the\nNobel Peace Prize the next year, the Polish government refused to allow him to travel to\nreceive it.\nThe situation intensified through the mid-1980s, with the Polish economy in\nshambles due to external embargoes, Solidarity actions, and government ineptitude. Strikes\nwaxed and waned, and the government tried to placate the movement by releasing polit-\nical prisoners, only to arrest more immediately afterward. If the government could have\nimproved the economy, that probably would have reduced the social temperature; but it\nwas incapable of doing so. The USSR, suffering from a poor economy of its own, was in\nno position to give much help. On the other side, Solidarity\u2019s commitment to nonviolence\nprotected its image both in Poland and abroad, and helped win the support of the Vatican,\nwhich was important in Catholic Poland.\nFinally, the government understood that the situation was untenable. It 1989, it was\nagreed through a series of negotiations that Solidarity would be legalized again \u2013 but this\ntime, it would become a political party and stand candidates for office. Solidarity would\nbecome the only legal non-communist party in Eastern Europe, participating in the first\nmultiparty elections in Poland since World War II. The communist party may have agreed\nto this arrangement because it was confident it would win; if it did, it would have shown\nSolidarity that the labor union was not as popular as it thought.\nThe results of the June 1989 elections surprised even Solidarity; they had won a\nlandslide victory over the communist party, taking control of virtually the entire parlia-\nment. The Solidarity government made Tadeusz Mazowiecki Poland\u2019s first noncommunist\nprime minister in 44 years. The new government moved quickly to write a new, noncom-\nmunist constitution, and became a democratic republic in December 1989. The next year,\nLech Walesa was elected the new President of Poland.\nDespite all the changes and celebrations, a terrible specter haunted these events.\nThe Warsaw Pact had seen revolts against communist rule before, in Hungary in 1956 and\nCzechoslovakia in 1968. In both cases, the revolts were put down by the Soviet Red Army.\nThe Soviet Union had a policy of allowing no secession from the Warsaw Pact or the USSR\nitself. The Solidarity government had done just that by instituting a democratic constitution.\nThe world held its breath. Would the USSR now invade Poland?\nThe answer to that weighty question was no. Mikhail Gorbachev, elected in 1985,\nhad a different approach to Eastern Europe than his predecessors. Known as the Sinatra\nDoctrine (see Chapter 2), this 1988 policy allowed Warsaw Pact countries to chart their own\ndestiny without Soviet interference. It was one thing to make such a statement; when Poland\nbecame the first country to test the new doctrine in 1989, it turned out that Gorbachev was\ntelling the truth. He did not invade Poland, much to everyone\u2019s surprise. The consequences\nof the new policy were about to change the world.\nThe Reunification of Germany\nThe limits of this new tolerance were further tested in late summer 1989. Communist\nHungary announced that it would remove its border fence with Austria. Hungary was a\npopular vacation destination for East Germans, and suddenly became even more popular\ndue to its lax border with the West. That summer, thousands of East Germans traveled to\nHungary and, finding the Hungarian border guards quite lackadaisical, crossed over into\nAustria from where they could easily enter West German and receive political asylum. The\nEast Germans were at first reticent about acting; there was a longstanding tradition of keep-\ning the borders between Warsaw Pact countries open. But after 30,000 East Germans had\nescaped via Hungary, the GDR decided to close the border to that country. The incident did\n299 not bring a major response from the USSR.\nIn October 1989, longtime leader of East Germany, Erich Honecker, relinquished\nhis position due to illness, and was replaced by Egon Krenz. Krenz sought to release some\nof the social stress in his country, which was rising due to both a bad economy and the\ndemocratic example recently set by Poland. In November, he concocted a plan to allow East\nGerman citizens to enter West Germany under greatly relaxed requirements. However, the\nEast German government prematurely announced this program at a press conference on\nNovember 9 1989. With Western journalists present, a government spokesman told ev-\neryone that the program was effective immediately, although the plan had not yet filtered\nthrough the byzantine communist bureaucracy.\nThe program was announced on West German TV that evening; many East\nGermans watched Western news, although it was illegal to do so in the East. Seeing the\nreports, tens of thousands of East Berliners headed to the checkpoints in the Belin Wall\nto cross over into the West. The handful of East German guards at the gates had received\nno instructions regarding the new program and tried to turn people back. The increasing-\nly-agitated crowd only grew larger, and the police were unwilling to use violence to disperse\nthem. Finally, at 11 PM local time, the guards gave up and opened the gates, allowing ev-\neryone present to pass through without any control. Tens of thousands of East Berliners\nentered West Berlin, many for the first time. There were instant celebrations in the streets\nand bars of West Berlin, welcoming the visitors. People from both sides even danced atop\nthe dreaded Berlin Wall and no one tried to stop them. That euphoric night, November 9,\nis remembered as the night the Berlin Wall fell. People took turns chipping away at it with\nsledgehammers for weeks to come.\nThe German situation now accelerated with amazing speed. West German\nChancellor Helmut Kohl announced that the two Germanies would cooperate closely in a\nprogram of reunification. In February 1990, Gorbachev again asserted that the future of the\ntwo Germanies was up to the Germans and that the USSR would not intervene, again to the\ndisbelief of the West.\nInterestingly, not everyone in Western Europe was thrilled with these events.\nMargaret Thatcher, Prime Minister of the UK, and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, President of France,\nboth resisted the reunification of Germany on the grounds that a new, resurgent Germany\nmight present a security threat to Europe. Some Western European conservatives, recalling\nthe two world wars, agreed with them, fearing a return of the Nazis. Thatcher even asked\nGorbachev to intervene in East Germany to prevent a reunification \u2013 an embarrassing sit-\nuation for the United States, since Ronald Reagan had, just two years earlier, insisted that\nGorbachev \u201ctear down\u201d the Berlin Wall. In any event, President Bush of the United States\nfully supported German reunification, and France and the UK had no way of preventing it.\nNow confident that the USSR would not invade, East Germany held its first multi-\nparty elections in March 1990. The communists were soundly defeated, and the Christian\nDemocratic Union (the East German branch of Helmut Kohl\u2019s political party) won most of\nthe seats. The new government immediately initiated a program of reunification. The first\nstep of this process was financial assistance from West Germany; with the departure of the\ncommunists, the economy had to transition to free-market capitalism, a difficult transfor-\nmation which required a lot of help from the West.\nThat left only the final political transition. Rather than form a new country, East\nGermany was to become a part of West Germany, and the reunified nation would be known\nby the same name West Germany had, the Federal Republic of Germany, and with the same\nconstitution. This final act formally occurred at midnight on October 3, 1990, only 339 days\nafter the fall of the Berlin Wall. German reunification ended one of the greatest Cold War\ndramas and was, for Germany, the true end of World War II.\nThat left only five Warsaw Pact countries: Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,\n300 Chapter 13: End of Cold War Romania, and the USSR. (Albania was originally a Warsaw Pact member. Although so-\ncialist, it was fiercely independent in the vein of Tito\u2019s Yugoslavia, and withdrew from the\nalliance in 1968. Since no Warsaw Pact nation shared a border with Albania, the USSR\ncould not invade it to bring it back under control.) Each of these remaining countries went\nthrough a local drama regarding continued socialist rule, demonstrating the universal drive\ntowards democracy in Europe.\nHungary\nOf all the Warsaw Pact countries, Hungary had the smoothest transition to democ-\nracy. This is ironic, since the largest rebellion against communist rule in Eastern Europe was\nthe failed Hungarian Revolution of 1956, which left thousands of people dead. But the rev-\nolution was followed by a period of liberalization, allowing for more freedom of speech, as\nwell as access to Western goods and travel, than anywhere else in the Soviet Bloc. Known as\n\u201cgoulash communism,\u201d this system kept the Hungarians relatively happy with their country,\nthough not entirely without dissent.\nWith Solidarity\u2019s victories in Poland, and Gorbachev\u2019s refusal to intervene, the\nruling Hungarian Socialist Workers\u2019 Party (Magyar Szocialista Munk\u00e1sp\u00e1rt, MSZMP)\ndecided that opposing the march of democracy was useless; the communists would be\nbetter off going along with it, and forming a new political party to retain some of their\npower. Janos K\u00e1d\u00e1r, longtime leader of the MSZMP, was replaced by the reform-mind-\ned Imre Pozsgay in late 1988. Some traditional communists in the Parliament wanted to\nadjust the communist model in Hungary to allow for new freedoms, but Pozsgay and his\ngroup of reformers planned a full transition to democracy. As a result, the MSZMP gave up\nits Marxist monopoly on power in February 1989, paving the way for a multiparty system.\nIn late 1989, the MSZMP dissolved, then recreated itself, as the Hungarian\nSocialist Party (Magyar Szocialista P\u00e1rt, MSZP), a social democratic party. Traditional\ncommunists \u2013 one could hardly call them hardliners at this point \u2013 formed another com-\nmunist party, the Hungarian Workers\u2019 Party. It would have to compete with other parties\nnow in elections. The same month, the parliament adopted over 100 amendments to the\n1949 Hungarian Constitution, espousing democracy and establishing civil rights. On\nOctober 23, not coincidentally the anniversary of the 1956 Revolution, M\u00e1ty\u00e1s Sz\u0171r\u00f6s was\nnamed the provisional president, pending the planned 1990 elections. Sz\u0171r\u00f6s then officially\nproclaimed that the Republic of Hungary was established.\nBulgaria\nBulgaria had a unique relationship with the USSR among Warsaw Pact countries. It\nwas so closely tied to the Soviet Union that, at one point, its leadership considered becom-\ning a republic of the USSR. Since WWII, it had quickly industrialized, and now produced\nabout 70% of all Soviet electronics, with virtually no economic relations with any other Todor Zhivkov\nnation. But its close association with the USSR meant that, when the USSR began to falter\nand dissolve, Bulgaria was sure to suffer the same fate.\nBulgaria was ruled by the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP) and its long-serv-\ning autocrat, Todor Zhivkov. Having worked for decades to pacify the country, Zhivkov\nsuffered very little resistance from the people. His problems began with the victory of\nthe Solidarity government of Poland and the non-response of the USSR. With the rest of\nEastern Europe in transition to democracy, BCP ruling elites predicted the end of European\ncommunism. The question was how it would happen in Bulgaria. Would it come peacefully,\nas in Czechoslovakia, or violently, as in Romania? And, of course, the elites were most con-\ncerned with what would happen to them when the end did come.\n301 The trigger for the Bulgarian transformation was a poor policy decision by Zhivkov.\nCommunist Bulgaria bordered Turkey, a NATO country. Turkey had been worrying\nBulgarian leaders, since it had demonstrated some aggression with the 1974 invasion of\nCyprus; in 1980, a coup brought to power a militant, anticommunist government in Ankara.\nFearing that the Turks would threaten his nation, Zhivkov decided to crack down on the\nethnic Turkish minority living in Bulgaria, hoping to remove anyone who would be loyal\nto the Turkish regime. In March 1989, he forced the Bulgarian Turks to adopt Bulgarian\nnames and made it illegal to speak Turkish. The ethnic Turks took this as an attack on their\nidentity, and some launched small-scale violent resistance campaigns. Zhivkov then offered\nto allow anyone who wanted to live in Turkey to leave. This led to over 350,000 ethnic Turks\nexiting the country, a loss of about 1 out of every 25 citizens nationally; many claimed that\nthey did not leave voluntarily, but were forced out by police. Not only did this obviously\ndamage the economy and social fabric, but also brought condemnation from the interna-\ntional community, Bulgaria\u2019s National Assembly, and even Gorbachev himself.\nAt this point, BCP leaders decided that Bulgaria under Zhivkov would descend into\nviolence, as Romania had, and therefore planned to remove him from power. They formulat-\ned the plot while Zhivkov was visiting China. When Zhivkov returned on November 9 (the\nsame day the Berlin Wall would fall, but before the evening drama), his old comrade, Petar\nMladenov, informed him that he must resign his position, or be executed for his crimes\nagainst the ethnic Turks. Finding that the National Assembly backed Mladenov, Zhivkov\nresigned the next day. He and his supporters were expelled from the BCP, removing them\nfrom the equation permanently. Mladenov was made leader of the BCP and therefore head\nof state. He quickly denounced the anti-Turkish campaign and ended it, allowing refugees\nto return. He also permitted independent labor unions to organize. The BCF renamed itself\nthe Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSF), making it clear that it had softened its policies.\nIn January 1990, the ruling BSF and various noncommunist parties (now legal)\nbegan discussions on a transition to democracy; they also agreed to renounce violence, to\navoid a debacle such as Romania had suffered. The elections were held in June 1990. The\nBSF won most of the seats, with the anti-communist Union of Democratic Forces (UDF) a\nclose second. The new government then established a new constitution for Bulgaria, signed\non May 15, 1990, finally replacing the old postwar communist constitution and cementing\nthe new democracy.\nThus, it is clear that, unlike in Poland or East Germany, the fall of Bulgarian com-\nmunism was not due to popular pressures such as Solidarity; it was due to communist elites\nwho understood that European communism could not survive much longer. Rather than go\ndown the violent Romanian route, they wisely decided to transition to democracy willingly,\ngiving them the chance to continue participating in Bulgarian politics. The fact that the BSF\ndid so well in the first elections, in contrast to the communists in Poland, indicates that the\nBulgarian people approved of this transition strategy.\nCzechoslovakia\nCzechoslovakia had been a communist country since a 1948 coup brought the\nCommunist Party to power with assistance from the USSR, and subsequently eliminated\nall other parties. The coup, and Czechoslovakia\u2019s accession to the Warsaw Pact, were major\nfactors in the decision to implement the Marshall Plan and establish NATO. Under com-\nmunist rule, it was subdivided into the Czech Socialist Republic in the west, and the Slovak\nSocialist Republic in the east. These areas represented separate ethnic enclaves, each with its\nown dominant language.\nThe Czechoslovaks, however, demonstrated a penchant for revolt. In January 1968,\nAlexander Dub\u010dek was elected First Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia\n302 Chapter 13: End of Cold War (KS\u010c). Dub\u010dek was a reformer whose plans presaged Gorbachev\u2019s perestroika and glasnost,\nbut 20 years too early. Dub\u010dek proposed decentralizing the economy and allowing for great-\ner democratic freedoms, such as more rights for the media and freedom of travel. Dub\u010dek\nreferred to these policies as \u201cSocialism with a Human Face,\u201d and the following eight months\nof relative freedom were known as the Prague Spring.\nThe USSR was not prepared to accept such changes in a Warsaw Pact neighbor,\nand in August 1968, a collection of Warsaw Pact armies invaded Czechoslovakia with a\nhuge military force. While the Czechoslovak military stood down, the citizens resisted for\nmonths before the invasion force finally regained control. Dub\u010dek\u2019s reforms were reversed\nand he was removed from power. Anger at the USSR simmered beneath the surface (includ-\ning anti-Soviet riots when the Czech national hockey team beat the Soviets in the 1969 Ice\nHockey World Championships), but the government kept a tight lid on dissent.\nThe next major movement came in 1976. A Czech rock band named Plastic People\nof the Universe (in tribute to a Frank Zappa song) was arrested for disturbing the peace.\nTheir crimes were quoting a banned Czech poet, Egon Bondy, in their songs, as well as\nhaving long hair. Although sentenced to between three months and three years in prison,\nthe band continued to play illegal concerts on the underground circuit, becoming leaders in\nthe anti-communist movement.\nIn response to the oppression of the band, a group of dissidents formed a new or-\nVaclav Havel\nganization called Charter 77 (for the year of its founding). The most important member\nwas V\u00e1clav Havel, a poet and playwright who had seen his works banned in Czechoslovakia\nfor his participation in the Prague Spring. This group wrote a charter protesting the arrest\nof the band, as well as other suppressions of freedom, on the grounds that they violated\ninternational treaties to which Czechoslovakia was signatory (such as the Helsinki Accords\nand certain UN charters), as well as the constitution of the country.\nThe government responded harshly. The charter was declared illegal and the group\u2019s\nleaders declared \u201ctraitors.\u201d Their punishments ranged from arrest and imprisonment, to\nlosing their jobs and exile from the country. The treatment of the Charter 77 members led\nto the launch of a new organization in April 1978, the Committee for the Defense of the\nUnjustly Prosecuted (VONS in Czech), which sought to publicize their plight. Since the\ngovernment controlled the media, few Czech citizens understood the actual nature of the\ncase. The government then arrested the leaders of the new group, including Havel, who\nwas sentenced to five years in prison. Both Charter 77 and VONS survived underground,\nthough, and continued to distribute illegal publications criticizing the government\u2019s human\nrights record. Plastic People continued to play underground shows.\nBy 1988, the situation in Eastern Europe had changed sufficiently that Roman\nCatholic dissident groups decided to launch a mass protest in Bratislava, capital of the Slovak\nSocialist Republic. Although they were denied a permit, over ten thousand people turned\nout for the Candle Demonstration to demand more freedom of religion in Czechoslovakia.\nSince they could not legally organize, the plan had to be disseminated through Western\nmedia, such as Radio Free Europe. The nonviolent protest was dispersed by police with\nwater cannons and batons.\nBy November 1989, the winds of change had swept through Eastern Europe; the\nBerlin Wall had fallen on November 9. In Czechoslovakia, International Students Day\n(Nov. 17), commemorating the 1939 storming of Czechoslovak universities by the Nazis,\nprovided the opportunity for student protests. Thousands of high school and college stu-\ndents, many of them socialists, protested government policies. Radio Free Europe reported\nthat one of the students, named Martin \u0160m\u00edd, had been killed by security forces. The news\nspread quickly through the country, galvanizing support for the movement. Never mind\n303 that it wasn\u2019t true; despite the rumor, no one had been killed during the protest. But the\nstory was enough to generate public anger.\nOver the coming days, the protests grew and developed into a general strike. In the\nSlovak Socialist Republic, a group called Public Against Violence formed to coordinate\nthe protests; in Prague, Havel formed another group called Civic Forum, coordinating ac-\ntions in the Czech Socialist Republic. The nation\u2019s prime minister, Ladislav Adamec, was\nsympathetic towards the protesters\u2019 aims, but was prevented by the communist party from\nmaking political concessions. He did, however, promise to avoid using violence against the\ndemonstrators, who by November 25 had grown to about one million people.\nThe Catholic Church backed the demonstrators. The news media went on strike and\nbroke with the government, allowing independent reports of the protests and giving voice to\nthe demonstrators. Finally, on November 28, the Federal Assembly declared Czechoslovakia\na multiparty state, breaking the Communist Party\u2019s stranglehold on power; this represented\nthe victory of the movement, which became known at the Velvet Revolution for its relative\nnonviolence. On December 29, Havel was appointed President of Czechoslovakia, heading\nan interim government. The first free elections were held in June 1990, with Civic Forum\nand Public Against Violence winning most of the votes. The communist party won some\nvotes in the assembly, but their power was broken.\nThe new democracy had an immediate, secondary problem: trying to hold the two\nhalves of Czechoslovakia together. Ethnic differences strained relations between the urban-\nized Czechs, who traditionally held most of the nation\u2019s power, and the mainly rural Slovaks.\nAlthough a contentious issue, the decision was made to separate the country into the Czech\nand Slovak republics. This was accomplished, without violence, in December 1992.\nRomania\nLorem Romania\u2019s transition to democracy was probably the most violent in all the\nWarsaw Pact. The main reason for this was the egomaniacal nature of the nation\u2019s General\nSecretary, Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu. Ceau\u0219escu had ruled the nation with an iron fist since 1965.\nHe valued Romanian nationalism over socialist unity, and often opposed Soviet policy (like\nthe invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968), but he hated Soviet hegemony mostly because\nit interfered with his own hegemony. Ceau\u0219escu built up a cult of personality resembling\nStalin\u2019s, filling the government with his supporters and family regardless of their qualifica-\ntions. He built a massive palace for himself and his wife, Elena, and the streets were adorned\nwith pictures of him. To protect himself, he created a vast security system in which secret\npolice tapped phones, read mail, and arrested anyone opposing the government. Between\nthe military and the secret police, Ceau\u0219escu had a near-Stalinist level of control over\nRomania. He was not going to relinquish it easily.\nRomania\u2019s economy foundered in the late 1980s, largely because Ceau\u0219escu in-\ntroduced harsh austerity measures; his plan was to use the money to pay off international\nloans, and in that he was successful. But the economic hardships suffered by the people\nin order to do so provoked revolt, especially when everyone could see Ceau\u0219escu\u2019s lavish\nlifestyle. In November 1987, factory workers at a truck manufacturer in Bra\u0219ov rebelled\nagainst the harsh economic policies, leading security forces to imprison hundreds of people.\nWhen the collapse of European communism began in 1989, Romania\u2019s government tried\nto prevent the news from spreading, but was unable to do so. Inspired by other democratic\nmovements, a group of students protested in Bucharest on November 9, but were quickly\napprehended.\nBy December 1989, it seemed that Romania might be the last bastion of communism\n304 Chapter 13: End of Cold War in Eastern Europe. But on December 16, a group of local people surrounded the home of the\npopular dissident pastor, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u0151k\u00e9s; the government had ordered him evicted from his\nhouse in Timi\u0219oara, and the people turned out to protect him. Soon, this effort developed into\na massive protest, with crowds fighting security forces in the streets. The next day, rioters ran-\nsacked the local offices of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) and demanded Ceau\u0219escu\u2019s\nresignation. The street battles became so intense that security forces and police were unable to\ncontain them, and the army was called out to disperse the demonstrators with armored vehicles.\nCeau\u0219escu then decided to stage a counter-revolutionary demonstration in Palace Square in\nBucharest on December 21, and what happened that day became the trigger for revolution.\nThe PCR bussed in one hundred thousand people to witness Ceau\u0219escu\u2019s speech, pro-\nvided them with flags, banners, and photographs of the dictator, and told them to cheer the\nspeech \u2013 or else they would be shot. Ceau\u0219escu gave a speech in which he blamed outside in-\nfluences and \u201cfascists\u201d for the troubles. The dictator, however, had lost touch with his people.\nThey began to boo and jeer him, chanting, \u201cTimi\u0219oara! Timi\u0219oara!\u201d Stunned, Ceau\u0219escu tried\nto silence the crowd, then tried to placate them with offers of wage increases. Then came the\nsounds of gunfire from the edge of the crowd. Rumors quickly circulated through the massive\ncrowd that security forces were shooting at them, and that a revolution was now underway.\nNational television, which had been covering the event, cut away to patriotic programming, but\nall of Romania had seen the unruly crowd and knew that something important was happening\nin Bucharest. Security forces quickly hustled Ceau\u0219escu to safety. The crowd that the dictator\nhad assembled now developed into a street demonstration, demanding his resignation. By the\nnext day, hundreds of thousands more flooded into Bucharest to join them.\nThe critical event in the revolution occurred the next morning, December 22. Ceau\u0219escu\nannounced that he had fired the Minister of Defense, Vasile Milea, for treason, and that Milea\nhad committed suicide as a result. He then appointed Victor St\u0103nculescu as the new Minister Revolution in Bucharest, Roma-\nof Defense. What Ceau\u0219escu didn\u2019t realize was that rumors quickly spread through the ranks of nia, December 1989.\nthe military that Ceau\u0219escu had ordered Milea\u2019s murder. Ceau\u0219escu was displeased with Milea\u2019s\nhesitation to use force against demonstrators, so it is possible he ordered his killing; the truth\nwill likely never be known.\nThe result of the rumor, however, is\nthat almost the entire military now abandoned\nCeau\u0219escu; St\u0103nculescu ordered the troops to return\nto barracks, and apparently few of them argued.\nSt\u0103nculescu later said that he also saw the writing\non the wall; anyone who still supported the dictator\nwould soon find himself executed by the next gov-\nernment, so it seemed wise enough to switch sides.\nThe police and security forces followed suit, and\nCeau\u0219escu no longer had any allies in Romania.\nThat afternoon, demonstrators burst into the\nCommunist Party headquarters where Ceau\u0219escu\nand his wife were hiding; the military did not at-\ntempt to stop them. The Ceau\u0219escus barely escaped\nwith their lives when they were picked up from the\nterrace by helicopter. Before they could get out of the\ncountry, however, the military ordered them to land\nor face being shot down. They landed in a field, and\nsubsequently given a hiding place by a local man.\nUnbeknownst to the Ceau\u0219escus, the man called the\n305 police, and the dictator and his wife were arrested.\nBucharest was suffering chaotic violence; street battles continued between soldiers\nand police still loyal to Ceau\u0219escu and the demonstrators who knew that victory was near.\nIn the meantime, a new revolutionary party, the National Salvation Front (FSN), collab-\norated with the military to assemble an immediate, ad-hoc court martial and charge the\nCeau\u0219escus with genocide. The pair were quickly found guilty of ordering the killings of\ncivilian demonstrators in Timi\u0219oara, and were then shot dead by a firing squad. It took\nanother two days for the chaos in Bucharest to calm, followed by raucous celebrations at the\nfall of the dictator. The cost of the revolution is difficult to ascertain; it is generally thought\nthat between 1000 and 7000 people were killed, with many thousands more wounded.\nThe transition to democracy was not as smooth as elsewhere in Eastern Europe,\neven after Ceau\u0219escu\u2019s death. The weeks before the May 1990 post-communist elections\nwere marred by protests and violence between the different parties, but the communist PCR\nwas banned. The FSN (composed largely of former PCR members) won most of the seats in\nthe elections, and FSN leader Ion Iliescu became the new president.\nThe only other communist nations in Eastern Europe were Yugoslavia and Albania,\nthough neither were members of the Warsaw Pact. Yugoslavia fragmented between 1990\nand 1992, and Albanian communism fell in December 1990 (both covered in Chapter 12).\nAs we saw in Chapter 2, the collapse of the Warsaw Pact was quickly followed by the disso-\nlution of the Soviet Union into its 15 constituent republics, ending communism in Europe.\nThis was considered the end of the Cold War. Note that the Cold War ended exactly as\nGeorge Kennan predicted in his 1946 Long Telegram (see Chapter 3), an event he lived long\nenough to witness.\nWho Won the Cold War?\nIn psychology, a Rorschach, or inkblot, test is used to help determine a patient\u2019s\npersonality and emotional state. The patient looks at a random ink blot and is asked what\nhe sees. Of course, the ink blot has no meaning at all, but the patient\u2019s response tells the\npsychologist something about his perception.\nA famous question in recent history is, \u201cWho won the Cold War?\u201d The question\ncan serve as a sort of political Rorschach test, with liberals and conservatives giving dif-\nferent answers according to their political bent. Conservative commentators (John Lewis\nGaddis, Francis Fukayama, etc.) claim that the US won the Cold War. After all, the Soviets\nand the Warsaw Pact are gone, and the US and NATO still exist. Also, some conservatives\ncredit Ronald Reagan with destroying the USSR; he embargoed the Soviet Union, built up\nAmerican defenses, and challenged Gorbachev to \u201ctear down\u201d the Berlin Wall \u2013 and the\nBerlin Wall came down the next year.\nMost historians do not accept this simplistic view, knowing the situation was far\nmore complex. First, the Cold War was not actually a war, and its end did not bring a great\nvictory parade for the Americans. One side simply gave up its way of life. In a sense, it\nproved the superiority of capitalism and democracy to European communism (but not\nChinese communism, which continues). Also, most historians do not credit Reagan with a\nvictory. It is true that Reagan\u2019s massive military buildup pressured the USSR into spending\nmore money than it could afford on defense, but it wasn\u2019t enough to destroy the USSR or\nthe Warsaw Pact. It must be remembered that the people of the USSR remained unified\nthrough the apocalyptic destruction and suffering of World War II. The pressure Reagan\nplaced on them was hardly the worst they\u2019d suffered. Most historians credit Gorbachev and\nhis Sinatra Doctrine, which gave Eastern Europe the political space it needed to make a free\nchoice between democracy and communism. Had Gorbachev not done so, it is difficult to\n306 Chapter 13: End of Cold War imagine such a rapid collapse of communism in Europe. One could certainly argue that the\nreal winners of the Cold War were the people of Eastern Europe and the USSR, who gained\ntheir political freedom as a result. Their lives changed far more than Americans\u2019 lives after\nthe Wall fell.\nIt is also worth asking the question: why didn\u2019t China also espouse democracy?\nThe democratic drive was certainly clear at Tiananmen Square in 1989, the same year as\nthe revolutions in the Warsaw Pact. The reason is that Deng Xiaoping was no Gorbachev.\nDeng wanted to revitalize China by combining capitalist elements with socialism to create a\nmixed economy. Gorbachev wanted the same thing, but also brought in elements of democ-\nracy, like multiparty elections. Deng did not do this; he regarded the primacy of the CCP\nas non-negotiable. As a result, while he was ready for some capitalism, he was not ready\nfor democracy, and crushed the nascent pro-democracy movement. The CCP continues to\nwield undisputed power in China.\nAnd what about the rest of the world? How would someone from India, Indonesia,\nor Argentina answer the question? A likely answer would be that humanity won the Cold\nWar. A full-scale nuclear war between the superpowers would have caused sufficient en-\nvironmental damage to the planet to endanger the continued survival of mankind. That is\nenough for the world\u2019s people to breathe a sigh of relief.\nConclusion\nWhat were the consequences of the end of the Cold War?\nFirst, the US and Russia (which inherited the Soviet Union\u2019s nuclear weapons) re-\nduced their nuclear stockpiles and stopped targeting each other, reducing the risk of nuclear\nwar (at least for now). The US also celebrated a \u201cpeace dividend,\u201d which freed up money\nfrom the massive defense budget. This extra money did not last long; after September 11,\n2001, the War on Terror began, and the US military budget skyrocketed to Cold War levels\nonce again.\nThe greatest effect was the coming of democracy to Eastern Europe and the former\nUSSR. Democracy\u2019s fortunes have varied wildly there and are certainly not yet up to Western\nEurope\u2019s standards, particularly in Russia (see Chapter 12). Still, democracy takes a long\ntime to develop properly, and Eastern Europe has only just begun its democratic journey.\nThe remaining communist countries of the world had to adapt to this new climate.\nChina regarded the USSR as a rival and potential foe, so was not deeply impacted by its fall.\nNorth Korea was largely isolated and dependent on China anyway. Vietnam and Laos shift-\ned to stronger relationships with the capitalist West and suffered no major negative conse-\nquences. Cuba suffered worst of all; since it is embargoed by the US, it has few options for\ninternational trade without the USSR. The country\u2019s economy has suffered badly without\nthe Soviet Union.\nThe end of the Cold War has had an interesting effect on the policies of the sole\nremaining superpower, the USA. One would think that the USA could now ride roughshod\nover other nations with its unopposed power, but that is not entirely true. When the Soviet\nUnion collapsed, it freed the US from having to consider Soviet responses to interventions\nand invasions. For example, the US did not intervene in the Hungarian Revolt of 1956, nor\nthe Prague Spring of 1968, for fear of war with the Soviets. It could not invade Iran after the\n1979 Islamic Revolution, because Iran bordered the USSR, and an invasion might trigger\nwar with the communists. Over and over, American responses were limited by the prospect\nof war.\nAfter the fall of the USSR, that was no longer true. The US could fight wars in\nKuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Balkans, and elsewhere without invoking the danger of\n307 nuclear war, and it certainly did so. But the US could no longer intervene in Latin America\nthe way it once did. The excuse for such interventions was always anti-communism, spe-\ncifically the fear that the USSR would use Latin America as a base from which to attack\nthe US. With the fall of the USSR, that reason (or excuse) evaporated. US wars since 1991\nhave never been anti-communist, but have typically been anti-terrorist. Since Islamic terror\ndoes not come from Latin America, the US has never invaded the region after the fall of the\nUSSR, although it still practices dollar diplomacy there.\nFinally, the end of the Cold War ushered in a new phase in international relations:\nglobalization, covered in Chapter 14. While global trade is hardly a new phenomenon, it\nwas greatly bolstered by the collapse of European communism, because Eastern Europe\nand the former Soviet states were no longer cut off from trade with the capitalist world.\nWhen coupled with new technologies like the internet, the expanded scope of globalization\nbrought most of the world into this new social and economic paradigm. The revolutions of\n1989 heralded a new era of opportunity and uncertainty.\nSuggested Further Reading\nThe Fall: A Comparative Study of the End of Communism in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary\nand Poland by Steven Saxonberg (Routledge, 2004.

The policy became known as \u201cBrezhnev Doctrine\u201d.\nDubcek\u2019s movement, known as the \u201cPrague Spring,\u201d was suppressed in an invasion. It was in November 1968,\nspeaking before Polish workers, that Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev gave the following justification.\nIn connection with the events in Czechoslovakia the question of the correlation and interdependence of the\nnational interests of the socialist countries and their international duties acquire particular topical and acute\nimportance. The measures taken by the Soviet Union, jointly with other socialist countries, in defending the\nsocialist gains of the Czechoslovak people are of great significance for strengthening the socialist community,\nwhich is the main achievement of the international working class.\nWe cannot ignore the assertions, held in some places, that the actions of the five socialist countries run\ncounter to the Marxist-Leninist principle of sovereignty and the rights of nations to self-determination. The\ngroundlessness of such reasoning consists primarily in that it is based on an abstract, non-class approach to the\nquestion of sovereignty and the rights of nations to self-determination.\nThe peoples of the socialist countries and Communist parties certainly do have and should have freedom for\ndetermining the ways of advance of their respective countries.\nHowever, none of their decisions should damage either socialism in their country or the fundamental interests\nof other socialist countries, and the whole working class movement, which is working for socialism.\nThis means that each Communist party is responsible not only to its own people, but also to all the socialist\ncountries, to the entire Communist movement. Whoever forgets this, in stressing only the independence of the\nCommunist party, becomes one-sided. He deviates from his international duty.\nMarxist dialectics are opposed to one-sidedness. They demand that each phenomenon be examined concretely,\nin general connection with other phenomena, with other processes.\nJust as, in Lenin\u2019s words, a man living in a society cannot be free from the society, one or another socialist\nstate, staying in a system of other states composing the socialist community, cannot be free from the common\ninterests of that community.\n311 The sovereignty of each socialist country cannot be opposed to the interests of the world of socialism, of the\nworld revolutionary movement. Lenin demanded that all Communists fight against small-nation narrow-\nmindedness, seclusion and isolation, consider the whole and the general, subordinate the particular to the\ngeneral interest.\nThe socialist states respect the democratic norms of international law. They have proved this more than\nonce in practice, by coming out resolutely against the attempts of imperialism to violate the sovereignty and\nindependence of nations.\nIt is from these same positions that they reject the leftist, adventurist conception of \u201cexporting revolution,\u201d of\n\u201cbringing happiness\u201d to other peoples.\nHowever, from a Marxist point of view, the norms of law, including the norms of mutual relations of the\nsocialist countries, cannot be interpreted narrowly, formally, and in isolation from the general context of class\nstruggle in the modern world. The socialist countries resolutely come out against the exporting and importing\nof counterrevolution.\nEach Communist party is free to apply the basic principles of Marxism Leninism and of socialism in its\ncountry, but it cannot depart from these principles (assuming, naturally, that it remains a Communist party).\nConcretely, this means, first of all, that, in its activity, each Communist party cannot but take into account\nsuch a decisive fact of our time as the struggle between two opposing social systems-capitalism and socialism.\nThis is an objective struggle, a fact not depending on the will of the people, and stipulated by the world\u2019s being\nsplit into two opposite social systems. Lenin said: \u201cEach man must choose between joining our side or the\nother side. Any attempt to avoid taking sides in this issue must end in fiasco.\u201d\nIt has got to be emphasized that when a socialist country seems to adopt a \u201cnon-affiliated\u201d stand, it retains its\nnational independence, in effect, precisely because of the might of the socialist community, and above all the\nSoviet Union as a central force, which also includes the might of its armed forces. The weakening of any of the\nlinks in the world system of socialism directly affects all the socialist countries, which cannot look indifferently\nupon this.\nThe antisocialist elements in Czechoslovakia actually covered up the demand for so-called neutrality and\nCzechoslovakia\u2019s withdrawal from the socialist community with talking about the right of nations to self-\ndetermination.\nHowever, the implementation of such \u201cself-determination,\u201d in other words, Czechoslovakia\u2019s detachment\nfrom the socialist community, would have come into conflict with its own vital interests and would have been\ndetrimental to the other socialist states.\nSuch \u201cself-determination,\u201d as a result of which NATO troops would have been able to come up to the Soviet\nborder, while the community of European socialist countries would have been split, in effect encroaches upon\nthe vital interests of the peoples of these countries and conflicts, as the very root of it, with the right of these\npeople to socialist self-determination.\nDischarging their internationalist duty toward the fraternal peoples of Czechoslovakia and defending their\nown socialist gains, the U.S.S.R. and the other socialist states had to act decisively and they did act against the\nantisocialist forces in Czechoslovakia.\n312 Chapter 13: End of Cold War Brezhnev, Leonid. \" The Brezhnev Doctrine.\u201d Internet History Sourcebooks Project.

One is to understand why the\nsustainable, energy production.\nworld is the way it is; the present is a result of past decisions, so history has many\nExpect to see more of these\nin the future. Image from the of the answers. Another reason is empowerment. In understanding how and why\nLawrence Livermore National\nthe present world came about, we may understand how to build a better one in\nLaboratory.\nthe future, or at least avoid past mistakes. Take, for example, the European Union\nand the United Nations. Both institutions were established to avoid past errors and\nbuild a safer future. You have seen many examples of such thinking in this book.\nTherefore, one reason for studying the past is, ironically, concern for the future.\nAn upshot is that historians are tempted to predict the future based on\npresent circumstances and trends. They are often inaccurate; few could have\npredicted the end of the Cold War, though George Kennan managed it. But if\nhistorians can foresee national or global problems, governments may be able\nto avoid those problems if they act accordingly. Governments and corporations\nboth dedicate significant resources to researching the past to extrapolate future\ndevelopments.\nThis chapter will address four major trends which will determine what sort\nof world our children and grandchildren will inherit. It will examine at the sources\nof these trends and why they are so critical to the future. The four trends are global\nwarming, globalization, emerging technologies, and the new international polarity.\n315 Global Warming\nThe twin hearts of modern economics are capitalism and industrialization, re-\nferred to together as industrial capitalism. Industrialization refers to using machines to\nmake commodities, as opposed to making them by hand. Because it is so much faster than\nhandcrafting, industrialization makes inexpensive products, allowing more people to afford\nthem, expanding sales and thus growing the economy. Industrialization began in the UK,\nwhere the first viable steam engines were invented and improved, then put to work in the\ntextiles industry.\nIndustrial machinery requires immense energy. In the UK, the first industrial\nenergy source was coal, which is readily available in the British Isles. Coal is the mineralized\nremains of ancient plant life which spent tens of millions of years underground, subjected to\nintense heat and pressure. This chemically changed the organic materials until they became\ncoal. Coal is the remains of ancient life, and so is called a fossil fuel.\nOver time, coal was used to power more than manufacturing equipment; it was\nused to fire the steam engines of trains, ships, and electrical power plants when the first\nwas built in 1882. Coal remained the undisputed king of energy until 1860, when \u00c9tienne\nLenoir invented the internal combustion engine. Automobiles soon followed. The internal\ncombustion engine was much smaller and far more efficient than steam engines, but didn\u2019t\nrun on coal \u2013 it required derivatives of oil, another fossil fuel. Oil is the concentrated re-\nmains of algae and zooplankton which lived on the surface of the ocean from 90 to 150 mil-\nlion years ago, then subducted underground and compressed in the same manner as coal.\nOne gallon of crude (as oil is called when first pumped out of the ground) contains 98 tons\nof this compressed ancient life. The crude is filtered and chemically refined into the various\nderivative fuels (gasoline, diesel, kerosene, etc.) as well as lubricating oil and plastics.\nOil quickly surpassed coal as the world\u2019s primary fuel and nations strove to acquire\nit by one means or another -- see the example of the British in Iran. It is the most cost-effi-\ncient fuel humans have ever discovered, allowing modern man to do 70 to 100 times more\nphysical work than preindustrial civilizations. (Nuclear power plants are very efficient at\ngenerating electricity, but are expensive to build and have certain dangers associated with\nthem; see Chapter 2. Also, they are impractical for powering land vehicles.) Oil is the main\nreason why modern economies are so much more efficient than earlier ones, since it makes\ntransportation and manufacturing so inexpensive. Naturally, as economies expand, so does\nfossil fuel consumption.\nAlthough burning fossil fuels produces a toxic byproduct (carbon monoxide) as\nwell as particulate matter, scientists in the late 19th century recognized a potential problem\nwith a nontoxic byproduct: carbon dioxide.\nGreenhouses stay warm in winter by allowing sunlight to pass through their glass\nceilings. The sun\u2019s energy, in the form of visible light, enters the greenhouse through the\nglass and strikes objects in the building. The objects warm and radiate the energy back in\nthe form of infrared energy, better known as heat. However, most of the infrared energy\ncannot pass back out through the glass ceiling because its wavelength is longer than visible\nlight. Therefore, the sun\u2019s energy enters the greenhouse, converts to heat, and remains in the\ngreenhouse.\nScientists have long known that carbon dioxide has a similar effect in that most\ninfrared radiation will not pass through it. Burning fossil fuels creates carbon dioxide,\nreleasing it into the atmosphere. Historically, the earth\u2019s temperature was relatively stable\nover short geologic periods between ice ages. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the\natmosphere was such that much of the sun\u2019s reflected infrared could radiate back out into\nspace and maintain heat equilibrium. But centuries of fossil fuel burning have increased the\n316 Chapter 14: Brave New World carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from its natural 280 parts per million to 420 parts per\nmillion today.\nThe result of this increased carbon dioxide level is called the greenhouse effect.\nTrapping more infrared energy on earth instead of radiating it out to space increases the\nplanet\u2019s surface temperature. Indeed, weather records show that Earth\u2019s temperature has in-\ncreased two degrees Fahrenheit since industrialization. While it does not sound like much,\nit is enough to cause unnatural variations in the climate, such as stronger storms, droughts,\nand rising sea levels. Although the climate is naturally variable, 98 percent of climatolo-\ngists agree that climate change is \u201cvery likely\u201d caused mainly by human activity. Mankind\ncontinues to use about fifty thousand gallons of oil every second, constantly increasing the\ncarbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. What are the expected consequences of\nlong-term climate change?\nIf carbon emissions are not drastically reduced, scientists expect that the most dra-\nmatic changes will be evident by the year 2100, if not before. The warmer world will be dryer\nin many places as the heat evaporates surface water. Droughts will become more common,\ndisrupting food production, especially in already-dry climates such as the US Southwest.\nScientists expect to see a drop in production for every major cereal crop worldwide, putting\nmillions of people in danger of famine. Fresh water will become an ever-larger problem\n(some speculate that drinking water will become a very valuable commodity in the future).\nFor example, many glaciers around the world have already disappeared due to warming\ntemperatures. Himalayan glaciers provide drinking water to about a quarter of the Chinese\npopulation when their spring melt swells the rivers; when those glaciers melt entirely, it will\nbecome an immediate problem for China and other countries. The American Southwest is\nalready suffering a lack of drinking water due to climate change.\nAnother major result of climate change is sea level rise, which is already being\nrecorded in several regions, including the Southeastern US. Melting ice caps in Iceland,\nAntarctica, and the North Pole add water to the oceans; also, as the seas heat up due to\nglobal warming, the water expands, raising sea levels even more. Sea level change will vary\naround the world, but in the coastal United States, levels are expected to rise by twelve\ninches by 2050 and 62 inches by 2100. Other nations will experience considerable sea level\nrise as well.\nThe damage from this, already felt in such places as Florida, will be catastrophic.\nChart showing the increase of carbon\nNearly half of all people globally live within 65 miles of the sea; sea level rise would result\ndioxide in the atmosphere from 1750\nto 2020. From the National Oceanic in devastating floods, especially with a combination of storms and high tide. Furthermore,\nand Atmospheric Administration. sea water can infiltrate fresh water aquifers farther inland, rendering them undrinkable and\nreducing fresh water supplies.\nClimate change will have many other consequences which do not bode well for\nmankind or other species. Storms,\nhurricanes, and tornados become\nmore frequent, and stronger, in hot\nweather. Pests and diseases which are\npresently limited to the tropics could\nmigrate north and south as the earth\nbecomes warmer, since temperatures\ncould now support them. While those\nspecies would thrive, other species\nsensitive to changes in climate would\nnot be able to adapt fast enough. A\ngreat many would go extinct.\nAll these factors, especially\nfamine, will breed crime, civil war,\n317 and anarchy. Wars are likely to erupt to seize or protect the remaining resources, particularly\nfresh water. Refugees from famine, flooding, and war are likely to number in the hundreds\nof millions, dwarfing every refugee crisis of the past. That only leaves the question: what can\nbe done to prevent climate change, or to mitigate the effects?\nMany nations are taking at least some steps to reduce their greenhouse gas emis-\nsions, by switching to solar and wind energy for power generation or subsidizing electric\nvehicle purchases. It is hotly debated whether these adjustments will be enough. Remember\nthat oil is the most cost-efficient fuel known to man, and other sources are unlikely to make\nup the difference in energy if fossil fuels are abandoned. Electric vehicles have far less range\nwith current technology that internal combustion engine cars. Any drop in the overall\nenergy available to mankind will damage our economic system. Politicians who harm the\neconomy with a quick shift away from fossil fuels are unlikely to be re-elected, and they\nknow it. Since climatologists say that mankind needs a rapid transition to renewable energy,\nour politics will clearly be an obstacle to change. But doing nothing, or too little, is a clear\npath to climate disaster.\nThe most likely outcome is that a certain degree of climate change will be permitted\nto occur due to the political difficulties in changing the system. At that point, the public will\nbe more likely to accept change, once it understands the consequences of inaction. Some\nanalysts believe that, at that point, change would come too late. Carbon dioxide remains in\nthe atmosphere for between 30 and 100 years; by the time significant changes are made, it\nmay be too late to avoid the worst effects of climate change. But it is obvious that climate\nchange will become an increasingly-important topic of political debate at the global level for\nthe foreseeable future.\nGlobalization\nHistorians tend to apply labels to periods of history in order to classify them and\nmake sense of the passage of time. The Cold War and decolonization were both \u201ceras\u201d in\nglobal history. The present era since the end of the Cold War may be referred to as the Era of\nGlobalization, as globalization is presently the dominant global paradigm.\nGlobalization is the integration of the global community, particularly in economic\nterms. It refers to the unrestricted, global movement of money, commodities, people, and\nideas. One of the drives of capitalism is unlimited growth \u2013 to reinvest profits and grow a\ncompany, theoretically, without limits. While international trade has a long history, there\nhave always been many limits to it. Often, governments would not let foreigners sell goods\nin their country, or else heavily tax their profits, in order to protect their own manufac-\nturers from competition; this is known as protectionism. Sometimes the restrictions are\ndue to political or religious differences manifesting as embargoes. Also, technical problems\nlimited trade. Manufacturing and farming were inefficient and transportation was slow.\nCommunication and business administration were primitive. All these reasons kept compa-\nnies, and thus national economies, from growing past a certain point.\nMore recently, the Cold War divided much of the world between the capitalist and\ncommunist camps, and trade between them was restricted, limiting growth. The global\neconomy has changed drastically since the end of the Cold War, however, and many politi-\ncal, legal, and technical restrictions on international trade have been removed. That is why,\nalthough international trade is very old, modern globalization is considered a new phase in\neconomic history.\nModern globalization began at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944. While\nWorld War II still raged, delegates from 44 Allied nations laid the groundwork for the post-\nwar economy. Their intention was to assure that the world would have a financial system\n318 Chapter 14: Brave New World capable of rebuilding the world as well as preventing another Great Depression, which was\nviewed as a cause of the war. Their plan, later called the Bretton Woods system, called for\ninternational standards of currency exchange, the creation of the IMF and World Bank to\nprovide money to recovering or developing countries, and other common economic stan-\ndards. This was the first time in history that nations had gathered to create an international\nstandard for global trade. Later agreements included the General Agreement on Tariffs\nand Trade (GATT) in 1947, which eliminated further barriers to trade, such as tariffs and\ntrade quotas. Nevertheless, Bretton Woods would not be global, as the Cold War cut off\nthe communist countries from the system; those nations did not participate in it. This lim-\nited globalization until the opening of China and the end of the Cold War. Also, while the\nBretton Woods concept of globalization espouses eliminating tariffs, domestic pressure for\nprotectionism has forced politicians to keep and even expand tariffs over the years.\nThe Bretton Woods agreement broke down in 1971, when the US ended the\nconvertibility of the dollar to gold, as Bretton Woods promised. Still, other agreements\nremained in force, and the World Trade Organization (WTO) was established in 1995\nto facilitate world trade and settle international trade disputes. Laws regarding intellectu-\nal property (i.e., copyrights and patents) have been internationalized, so that owners can\npursue and prosecute violators in other countries, thus protecting their profits.\nLaws and treaties are one facet of globalization. Another is the tremendous im-\nprovement of transportation technologies and systems. If international trade is to be\nprofitable, transportation of manufactured products must be cheap and efficient; the same\ngoes for global tourism, which is an eleven trillion-dollar industry. Jet aircraft have vastly\nimproved the efficiency of air travel, which is also much safer than it once was.\nSince the 1980s, the proliferation of computer technology has greatly improved business\nefficiency and profitability. The rise of the internet in the mid-1990s not only allowed freer\nexchange of information, but also introduced online business transactions (e-commerce),\nwhich is presently worth about three trillion dollars a year. This was quickly followed by\nmobile (cell) phone technology, which allows both communication and data access, greatly\nThe increase in world trade\nexpanding interconnectivity.\nsince 1950; this is essentially the\nimpact of globalization. Chart These changes in international trade laws, politics, and technology have increased\ncompliments of the World the value of international trade from $61 billion in 1950 to $22.3 trillion in 2021. This is\nTrade Organization\nbecause globalization has removed many barriers to trade since World War II, often with\ntechnology the participants of the Bretton Woods conference could not have imagined in\n1944. Globalization is the realization of their dream, a world without economic limits. But\nsince globalization is the most\ncomplicated of all current histori-\ncal trends, there are both pros and\ncons to it.\nThe benefits of global-\nization are clear. It benefits busi-\nnesses by making all the world\u2019s\nmarkets, resources, and labor\npools available. The markets are\nparticularly important, because\nindustrial capitalism has a habit\nof saturating domestic markets\n(that is, companies can only\nsell so much of their products\nbecause no one wants, or can\nafford, any more). Therefore, the\nability to sell to the entire world\n319 is an important asset. Globalization also allows access to the necessary natural resources\nfor manufacturing, since companies can buy them from any source in the world. Access to\nthe world\u2019s labor markets allows corporations to open factories in nations with abundant,\ninexpensive labor, reducing productions costs.\nGlobalization also benefits smaller countries by opening global markets to special-\nized goods they excel at producing (for example, sugar and coffee in South America). If\nthese countries can sell enough of their specialized product, they can theoretically afford to\nbuy the manufactured products they cannot produce cheaply themselves.\nSocially and politically, globalization is believed to increase cooperation between\nnations, reducing ethnocentricity through exchange of information and allowing travelers\nto visit foreign cultures. Music, fashion, and movies now enjoy global audiences. The inter-\nnet has made all aspects of human culture available to anyone with a cell phone.\nThere are also many disadvantages to globalization, depending on one\u2019s position\nin the system. Increased competition is a major problem for small, local companies. For\nexample, global restaurant chains such as McDonald\u2019s or Domino sell cheap products and\nthus beat local restaurants, which are eventually forced to close. While the inexpensive food\nmay benefit the local people, it hurts the local restaurants, who simply cannot compete with\nthe globalized corporate behemoths. Amazon and Walmart have similar effects.\nAnother upshot is that globalization can create homogenization; that the same\nglobalized food chains, music, internet, movies, cars, etc. will erase all the local producers\nand convert all the world\u2019s cultures into a single culture created by the corporations. Since\nmost of the global corporations and products are American, homogenization is sometimes\nalso referred to as \u201cAmericanization.\u201d Understandably, many people do not want their home\nculture to turn into a foreign one.\nMore serious than homogenization is the exploitation of workers. Globalization\ntreaties allow corporations to open factories in foreign countries where labor is cheaper, not\njust in terms of salary but also with a lack of labor laws, environmental and safety regula-\ntions, and so on. There is disagreement even among foreign workers whether this represents\nabuse. On one hand, the corporations employ these workers only because they are inexpen-\nAn anti-globalization protest\nsive. On the other hand, the global corporation\u2019s jobs may be the only ones available. Is this\nin the US. Seattle Municipal\nhelpful, or exploitative? Archives, November 29 1999. CC\nAnother disadvantage to globalization in this respect is known as the \u201cRace to the BY-2.0.\nbottom.\u201d Since governments want global corporations to provide jobs in their countries,\nand know that corporations want an inexpensive labor market, they sometimes take steps\n320 Chapter 14: Brave New World to reduce the costs for corporations. This might include providing tax breaks for the corpo-\nrations, but also things which harm the workers. For example, the government may remove\nor ignore workers\u2019 rights in a country, such as a minimum wage or safety standards, to\nmake it more attractive to global corporations. While this may bring jobs to the country, the\nworkers must accept those jobs with few benefits. Again, is this beneficial, or exploitative?\nAnd when all the developing nations compete to attract corporations by removing workers\u2019\nrights, this is known as the \u201crace to the bottom.\u201d\nFinally, just as capitalism considers the environment to be an \u201cexternal\u201d (i.e., apart\nfrom economic considerations), globalization also ignores environmental destruction in\npursuit of natural resources and manufacturing. Governments often ignore environmental\nconcerns in order to grow their economies, allowing the corporations to do what they need\nfor the sake of increasing profits. This grows the economy and provides jobs, which are\nimportant for re-election. While this may benefit them in the short-term, it has negative\nlong-term consequences for the country and even the entire world (via global warming).\nWhile globalization provides both cheap products and jobs, it can also result in workers\nlosing their jobs. One reason why the manufacturing base in the United States lost so much\nof its dominance is that US corporations have their factories in countries with cheaper labor\n(or else buy needed parts from those countries because they are cheaper). Corporations\nthen close unneeded factories in the US, and American workers lose their jobs. This hap-\npens in other developed counties as well.\nLike capitalism in general, those who are better-placed in the system benefit the\nmost from globalization \u2013 skilled workers or wealthy investors. So, while globalization\nproduces wealth for all, it does not do so evenly. The richest one percent of the world\u2019s pop-\nulation owns nearly half of the world\u2019s wealth, while the poorest fifty percent own only one\npercent. One of the most important determinants between wealth and poverty in the future\nwill be whether individuals and nations are equipped to compete in the globalized environ-\nment.\nEmerging Technologies\nSince the Industrial Revolution, technology has completely remade human culture.\nIndustrial agriculture reduced the need for farmers, and the workers went to the newly-built\nfactories for jobs; the farmers became city folk and factory workers, living entirely different\nlives. Medicine and public health improved and extended human lifespans. On the other\nhand, military technology is now sufficiently advanced to wipe out its makers \u2013 and history\nshows that mankind is increasingly afraid of its own creations. But where is technological\ndevelopment taking us from here? This section will examine three developing technologies\nwhich will likely profoundly influence human life in the near future.\nThe first is genetic engineering. Mankind has practiced genetic engineering for\nhundreds of years via selective breeding of plants and animals to produce offspring with\ndesirable traits. Although useful, selective breeding is a slow process, requiring many gener-\nations to complete, and may also create undesirable traits as well.\nModern genetic engineering is much more direct. It delivers genetic material from\none organism and inserts it into another; it does not require several generations to see re-\nsults and avoids also transmitting negative qualities in the process. Although the concept of\nDNA was known as early as the mid-19th century, the ability to edit the genetic makeup of\ncells in a lab only became possible in the late 1970s and 1980s.\nAgriculture has thus far been the field most affected by new technology. Genetic\nengineering has created crop plants (known as GMO, or genetically-modified organisms)\nwhich produce larger yields and are resistant to insects and drought. These modifications in-\ncrease the amount of food available and thus lower the price. Other organisms are modified\n321 so that they produce drugs for human use; for example, GMO bacteria are used to produce\ninsulin.\nBut the most controversial use of genetic engineering relates to its use on human\nbeings. Recent advances have made it possible to \u201cedit\u201d human beings before their birth.\nThese changes theoretically include immunity to certain diseases or the elimination of in-\nherited disabilities. Furthermore, it may be possible, with an increasing understanding of\ngenetics, to produce humans with desirable aesthetic traits, or with increased intelligence. It\nmay be possible to eliminate \u201cundesirable\u201d character traits such as greed or aggression; but,\nat that point, is the person a human being anymore? Genetic engineering presents the most\ncomplex ethical dilemmas of any new technology, and arguments over its acceptable uses\nare ongoing. Famed scientist Stephen Hawking predicted that, someday, wealthy people\nwith access to genetic engineering would produce a race of superhumans. As to the unmod-\nified people, Hawking predicted, \u201cpresumably, they will die out, or become unimportant.\nInstead, there will be a race of self-designing beings who are improving at an ever-increas-\ning rate.\u201d Little wonder that genetic engineering is so fraught with ethical issues.\nNanotechnology is a new science addressing the manipulation of matter at ex-\ntremely small scales \u2013 as small as one nanometer (one billionth of a meter). For scale, a\nhuman hair is about 100,000 nanometers in diameter. This might include building materials\nfrom individual molecules or even atoms; the first manipulation of an individual atom for\nthis purpose was in 1989.\nSince them, scientists have envisioned a myriad of uses for this technology. Matter\nhas different properties on this tiny scale and nanotechnology leverages them to create\nchanges in materials on the macro scale. Materials engineered at the molecular level\nprovide such benefits as greater tensile strength, heat resistance, lower weight, and water\nresistance. Nano-manufactured materials such as concrete would greatly benefit building\nconstruction. Aircraft made from carbon fiber nanotubes will be lightweight, yet stronger\nthan steel. Nontechnology is already used in cancer treatment and vaccination. One envi-\nsioned use is for drug delivery; such tiny creations can pass between cells and deliver drugs\nto exactly the correct target so that drugs are not wasted. Computers will also benefit from\nnanotechnology. The smaller the microchip, the more information it can contain, and the\nfaster it works. Manufacturing chips at the molecular level would create a whole new gener-\nation of computers, vastly more powerful than current technology while using less energy.\nThe same technology applies to robots. Scientists envision tiny machines able to enter the\nbloodstream and eliminate cancer cells or other problems. These are just a few of the bene-\nfits of this newly-emerging technology.\nThis technology can also be used for more nefarious purposes. The same undetect-\nable, microscopic robots which can heal the body could also be used to destroy it from\nwithin. When coupled with nanotech computers and AI (see below), such mass-produced\nrobots would be virtually unstoppable killers. There is also the danger of unintended pol-\nlution from nanomanufacturing, as the man-made particles escape into the air and water.\nThis is already happening, as nano-manufactured clothing and other items are thrown away\nand degrade; studies indicate that such pollutants could be as dangerous as asbestos if in-\ngested or inhaled. But, given the benefits that nanotechnology provides, it is certain that an\nincreasing number of products will be made with nanotechnology.\nFinally, there is the famed development of AI (artificial intelligence). AI is the\nability of a digital computer to carry out processes typically associated with the human\nmind \u2013 reasoning, generalization, and learning. Alan Turing, the British mathematician, de-\nveloped the earliest theories of AI starting in the late 1930s, long before computers capable\nof AI were invented. The first tentative steps towards AI were computers capable of playing\n322 Chapter 14: Brave New World checkers and chess, developed in the early 1950s. From there, both computer hardware and\nAI software programs have advanced exponentially.\nAt the moment, computers cannot think the way humans do, although AI chat pro-\ngrams appear to do so (in fact, they are only mimicking linguistic patterns, like a parrot).\nIntelligence includes the ability to adapt to new circumstances according to general princi-\nples, which AI cannot yet do. It is difficult to exactly define intelligence in humans, making\nit almost impossible to judge whether a machine has human intelligence. Many analysts\nclaim that, despite their speed, AI programs are no more intelligent than insects. Still, spe-\ncialized AI programs are very good at specific tasks, like playing chess or running a robotic\nassembly machine. Generalized AI \u2013 that is, a computer that can derive theories about the\nworld from its own experience and use them to make decisions in novel situations \u2013 appears\nto be a long way off. We do not even understand how humans do it.\nBut, given that humans are putting a great deal of effort into creating generalized\nAI, some experts call for regulation. Some fear that generalized AI robots could replace\nhumans at work, causing massive unemployment. Others say that AI could develop cogni-\ntive biases. For example, an AI using human history as a guide might perceive the racism\ninherent in past decisions and incorporate it into new decisions \u2013 devasting if the AI is\nbeing used to determine government policy.\nThe greatest of all AI fears is AI-guided weapons, like automated aerial drones.\nThese autonomous machines could surpass human capabilities in combat, fighting with nei-\nther fear nor sympathy, making them formidable opponents. This brings up the possibility\nthat they would not obey the laws of war, such as avoiding civilian casualties. In February\n2023, 60 nations, including the US and China, published a statement urging the develop-\nment of military AI that would honor \u201cinternational legal obligations and in a way that does\nnot undermine international security, stability and accountability.\u201d\nSuch is the danger of specialized AI in warfare. But what about a generalized AI\nwith military capabilities that decided that mankind is a threat to its existence? This is a\ncommon trope in science fiction and serves as the basis, for example, of the \u201cTerminator\u201d\nmovie series. The truth is that generalized AI is presumably far in the future. But since\nprotections against such an event would need to be in place before the first AI became sen-\ntient, some AI experts recommend safety protocols be developed now, in the form of a \u201ckill\nswitch\u201d that could be used to instantly deactivate a rogue AI.\nOf all ethical arguments surrounding new technologies, the danger of AI is proba-\nbly the most hotly debated, with experts on both sides of the issue. Given the considerable\nadvantages AI could bring to economic planning, manufacturing, the military, and other\nfields, it is certain that AI and the associated computer hardware will continue to develop,\nand the results could be momentous.\nAll of these developing technologies are essentially multipliers of human power,\ngranting us greater efficiency in economics, medicine, and elsewhere. The ethical questions\nemerge when we consider just how mankind will utilize this new power (or, in the case of AI,\nhow AI will utilize it). 20th century history has shown that mankind can use its increased\ncapabilities for medicine, economic expansion, and protecting human rights, and also for\nwarfare and environmental destruction. French philosopher Jean Rostand wrote, \u201cScience\nhas made us gods even before we are worthy of being men.\u201d This summarizes the fears that\nnew technologies arouse: that mankind is like a child playing with matches, unprepared\nfor the consequences. Still, mankind has successfully navigated the danger of nuclear war\nfor seventy years. It remains to be seen if we can do the same with emerging technological\ndangers.\n323 International Polarity\nA major question when contemplating mankind\u2019s future is the power configuration of\nthe international community of states. The division of the world during the Cold War had a\nprofound effect on international relations, even among nonaligned states. It deeply influenced\ninternational trade (and was not very good for it) and circumscribed what nations could do\nand still avoid a war or other negative outcome. Now that the Cold War is long gone, how to we\ndescribe the current power configuration in the international community, and how does it affect\nnational decisions?\nInternational relations specialists use the term polarity to describe the world\u2019s power\nconfiguration. There are three basic types of polarity. The first is unipolarity, which is when a\nsingle nation (or empire) has so much power that it doesn\u2019t fear any potential rival, even if that\npower is not great enough to coerce the other nations into obedience. The second is bipolarity,\nwhen two great nations share most of the power. The third is multipolarity, when the power is\ndivided up among three or more nations.\nBy way of example: during World War II, the world was in a multipolar state as var-\nious countries and alliances struggled for victory. After the war, the world quickly developed\ninto bipolarity between the US and the USSR; this was called the Cold War. After the fall of the\nUSSR, the world entered a unipolar state, in which the United States enjoyed a preponderance\nof power; still, the US did not become the world\u2019s hegemon, because the other nuclear powers\nstill had enough firepower to limit its dominance. But American unipolarity allowed it to carry\nout military actions in the Middle East and Asia as part of the War on Terror without serious\nresistance from other countries. This would not have been possible during the Cold War, when\nthe US had to be very careful not to threaten Soviet interests and risk war.\nWhat is the current world polarity? As one might expect, experts debate this point. Some\nclaim that the United States still stands head and shoulders above the rest of the world in terms\nof economics and military might (the two main determinants of polarity). Others claim that the\nrising power of India, China, and the EU mean that the world has returned to a multipolar state.\nBut the rise of China, more than any other nation, indicates that we are likely entering a bipolar\nstate between China and the United States in a \u201cNew Cold War.\u201d And if we have not yet entered\nbipolarity between these two countries, we are likely to do so soon.\nWhat is the United States\u2019 grand strategy? What does it want in the world, and how\ndoes it go about getting it? This is a complicated question because it can vary, sometimes a great\ndeal, from one US presidential administration to another. Like all nations, the US is primarily\nconcerned with its own safety. Apart from terrorist attacks, which are not an existential threat,\nthe US has little to fear in terms of war. The only nations which could threaten conventional war\nwith the US are Russia and China, and neither are very interested in that. The US nuclear arsenal\nalso serves as a major deterrent. Since the US is at the top of the global pyramid, it would like\nto see the world system remain stable; major changes might upset the US position at the top.\nThree things tend to concern US foreign policy makers: failed states (like Somalia, which could\nbecome a breeding ground for terrorists), rogue states (which act like criminals, like North\nKorea), and autocratic peer states (China and Russia). The last of these have always been consid-\nered the most dangerous to US interests, even during the War on Terror, which targeted mainly\nrogue states.\nWhat about America\u2019s main peer and adversary, China? Xi Jinping has made it clear that\nhe wants to return China to its old imperial great-power status, perhaps the greatest in the world.\nTherefore, China wants to change the current world system and balance, while the US wants to\nmaintain it. Because China is a one-party state under the Chinese Communist Party, and Xi has\nbeen the General Secretary of the Party since 2012, he has effectively been ruling China for over\n324 Chapter 14: Brave New World ten years; this means that he can carry out long-term strategies which would vary from one\npresident to the next in the United States.\nXi has three strategies to attain his goals. The first is the permanent dominance of\nthe Chinese Communist Party in his country. Not only are other parties prohibited, but\nXi has also taken steps to concentrate power into himself, rather than the party apparatus.\nThis gives him an unopposed power unseen since the days of Mao. With so much power,\nXi can single-handedly guide Chinese policy, aiming directly at great-power status. Note\nthat Xi and the CCP are not on some sort of communist crusade ala Marx; the party is\nmuch more interested in nationalism than pure socialism. The autocracy of socialist poli-\ntics merely serves as a convenient tool for maintaining power. This resonates well with the\nChinese people, who seem sympathetic to Xi\u2019s nationalism. Propaganda is at least partially\nresponsible for this.\nSecond, and related to the dominance of the CCP, is the Chinese economy. Xi has\npromised to increase not just China\u2019s GNP, but also its per capita income. While China is the\nsecond-richest nation in the world (after the United States), China\u2019s large population (over\nfour times larger than the United States) means that the wealth is divided among many\nmore people, so Chinese individuals command less than one-quarter the wealth of their\nAmerican counterparts. Per-capita wealth is the kind that affects peoples\u2019 daily lives. This\nis important to the continued dominance of the CCP, which needs to prove its worth to the\nChinese people to command their respect and avoid dissent. This is particularly true since\nthe CCP has largely replaced socialist economics with guided capitalism; the people want to\nknow why they have a one-party socialist state if they are not practicing socialist economics.\nThe CCP needs to deliver if it is to retain legitimacy in the peoples\u2019 eyes. And, of course, a\nnation cannot become a great power, with a large military and international influence, if it\nhas a small GDP. Power costs money.\nThis leads us to the last part of Xi\u2019s plan: the Chinese military. A great state requires\na powerful military, not just to defend itself and its interests, but also to intimidate adver-\nsaries so that a war never occurs. Modern militaries are exceedingly expensive, which is one\nreason why the CCP focuses on economic development.\nThe Chinese military, despite a recent modernization program, is still a distant\nsecond to the United States\u2019. This is not necessarily a disadvantage, because neither nation\nwants to settle their differences through war. Each side is armed with nuclear weapons; since\na conventional war may lead to a nuclear war, neither side wants to risk a confrontation, a\ncomforting thought to the people of the world who would have to suffer the consequences.\nThe main point of contention between the US and China, in terms of a possible war, is\nTaiwan. The CCP wants the island returned to China and has stated it is willing to use force\nto do so. The US has pledged to defend Taiwan against invasion, and the situation simmers\ntensely.\nXi\u2019s plan seems to be to increase China\u2019s power and influence through economics\nrather than military force. China also needs to build alliances around the world to help\nspread its influence. Presently, the US is much better at this. This competition for power and\ninfluence, while threatening, but not using, military force, recalls the days of the Cold War.\nBut, unlike the US and the USSR, the US and China are deeply connected economically;\neach needs the other to maintain its economy. This combination of mutual reliance and\nmutual distrust produces a tense, yet stable relationship that might best be termed a \u201cCold\nPeace.\u201d\n325 Conclusion\nBearing all this in mind \u2013 as well as the fact that prophesy is a risky business \u2013 what\nkind of world can our children expect to live in?\nThe peace and stability of the next hundred years of human experience is debatable.\nHumanity has suffered far fewer wars since World War II and certainly since the end of\nthe tumultuous wars of decolonization and the immediate aftermath. A combination of the\nUnited Nations and nuclear weapons prevents war between large nations. Most conflicts in\nthe modern era are internal insurgencies rather than international conflicts.\nOn the other hand, climate change is likely to upset this peaceful picture. The social\nupheaval from drought, sea level rise, and famine will cause both unprecedented migrations\nand widespread insurgency. These may also become interstate wars if the situation declines\ntoo much. Whether or not international organizations and the threat of nuclear war will be\nenough to prevent them is anyone\u2019s guess, as the situation of human-caused global climate\nchange is unprecedented. Climate change will likely be the main determinant of what the\nfuture holds. If mankind can prevent or mitigate the worst effects, the future might well be\nbright.\nSeveral other trends stand out. The late 20th century brought the rise of powerful\nnonstate actors to the international arena. Large corporations, empowered by globalization,\ncan now deeply affect nation-states. For example, \u201cWalmart, Apple and Shell all accrued\nmore wealth than even fairly rich countries like Russia, Belgium, and Sweden,\u201d according\nto Global Justice Now. Of the richest 200 global entities, 157 of them are corporations, not\nnations. Yet corporations are not democratic; rather than represent and serve people, their\nonly loyalty is to profit. This new corporate power represents a shift from democratic in-\nstitutions to profit-driven ones. This would not necessarily be a problem if corporations\nwere made to follow international standards on workers\u2019 rights and pollution; but as we saw\nin the section regarding globalization, this is often not the case. If corporations continue\nto accrue power and wealth in this fashion, it may lead to a reckoning with the power of\nnation-states. Other powerful nonstate actors include non-governmental organizations\n(NGOs, nonprofits which can influence public opinion), global terrorist organizations, and\nincreasingly-numerous billionaires (who are empowered by wealth to do things once re-\nstricted to nations, like launch space programs or run massive humanitarian campaigns).\nFinally, technological advancement will continue at an ever-increasing rate. Mobile\nphone technology and the internet have already changed society and economies in only a\nfew decades. Even greater changes are likely coming in the forms of genetic engineering and\nAI; and then, of course, there are technologies we cannot even guess at this time.\nCertain things are unlikely to change. For most people of the world, respect for\nhuman rights (however they are locally interpreted) will remain the basis for legitimate gov-\nernment, and all governments will try to appear to be human rights champions, however\nhypocritical that makes them. Nationalism has been a powerful force since the 19th century\nand isn\u2019t going anywhere. Although sometimes in conflict, human rights and nationalism\nare apparently permanent features of modern life, as is industrial capitalism.\nThe two main drivers of change will be climate change and new technologies. As always,\ntheir outcomes will be determined by a combination of human adaptability and concern for\nthe future. Whether the near future is promising or hellish will depend on how mankind\nnavigates these two challenges.\n326 Chapter 14: Brave New World Suggested Further Reading\nGlobalization and Its Discontents (W.

We also know that impacts will continue\nto increase if drastic cuts in greenhouse gas emissions are further delayed \u2013 affecting the lives of today\u2019s\nchildren tomorrow and those of their children much more than ours. But science is also clear: with immediate\naction now, drastic impacts can still be prevented.\nThe scientific assessment in the WGII [Working Group II] Report addresses the near-term (up to 2040), mid-\nterm (2041-2060) and the long-term (2081-2100). Today, the latter two milestones may seem far away, but\nchildren who were born in 2020 will be 20 years old in 2040 and 80 years old in 2100. The end of the century is\nless than a lifetime away. Actions taken now to reduce emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases drastically\nand adapt to a changing climate will have a profound effect on the quality of their lives and their children\u2019s\nlives, as well as their health, well-being, and security. We also have to take into account that by 2050 almost\n70% of the world\u2019s growing population will live in urban areas, many in unplanned or informal settlements. As\na result, today\u2019s children and future generations are more likely to be exposed and vulnerable to climate change\nand related risks such as flooding, heat stress, water scarcity, poverty, and hunger. Children are amongst those\nsuffering the most, as we see today.\nBut what is our children\u2019s future going to look like, if we do not limit global warming to well below 2\u00b0C,\npreferably to 1.5\u00b0C, compared to pre-industrial temperature? Based on the Working Group II assessment, we\nknow that global warming is already changing much of the world as we know it. Its impacts will intensify in the\ncoming decades with profound implications for all aspects of human life around the world. Our food and water\nsupplies, our cities, infrastructure and economies as well as our health and well-being will be affected.\nFor example: children aged ten or younger in the year 2020 are projected to experience a nearly four-fold\nincrease in extreme events under 1.5\u00b0C of global warming by 2100, and a five-fold increase under 3\u00b0C warming.\nSuch increases in exposure would not be experienced by a person aged 55 in the year 2020 in their remaining\nlifetime under any warming scenario.\nGlobally, the percentage of the population exposed to deadly heat stress is projected to increase from today\u2019s\n30% to 48-76% by the end of the century, depending on future warming levels and location. If the world warms\nmore than 4\u00b0C by 2100, the number of days with climatically stressful conditions for outdoor workers will\nincrease by up to 250 workdays per year by century\u2019s end in some parts of South Asia, tropical sub-Saharan\nAfrica and parts of Central and South America. This would cause negative consequences such as reduced food\nproduction and higher food prices. In Europe, the number of people at risk of heat stress will increase two- to\nthree-fold at 3\u00b0C global warming compared to warming levels of 1.5\u00b0C.\nWith ongoing global warming, today\u2019s children in South and Southeast Asia will witness increased losses in\ncoastal settlements and infrastructure due to flooding caused by unavoidable sea level rise, with very high\nlosses in East Asian cities. By mid-century, more than a billion people living in low-lying coastal cities and\nsettlements globally are projected to be at risk from coastal-specific climate hazards. Many of those will be\nforced to move to higher ground, which will increase competition for land and the probability of conflict and\nforced relocation.\n329 Climate change will impact water quality and availability for hygiene, food production and ecosystems due to\nfloods and droughts. Globally, 800 million to 3 billion people are projected to experience chronic water scarcity\ndue to droughts at 2\u00b0C warming, and up to approximately 4 billion at 4\u00b0C warming, considering the effects\nof climate change alone, with present-day population. Children growing up in South America will face an\nincreasing number of days with water scarcity and restricted water access, especially those living in cities and\nin rural areas depending on water from glaciers. As the Andean glaciers and snowcaps continue to melt, the\namount of available water decreases as the glaciers shrink or disappear entirely. Countries in Central America\nwill experience more frequent and stronger storms or hurricanes and heavy rainfall, causing river flooding.\nToday\u2019s young people and future generations will also witness stronger negative effects of climate change on\nfood production and availability. The warmer it gets, the more difficult it will become to grow or produce,\ntransport, distribute, buy, and store food \u2013 a trend that is projected to hit poor populations the hardest.\nDepending on future policies and climate and adaptation actions taken, the number of people suffering from\nhunger in 2050 will range from 8 million to up to 80 million people, with most severely affected populations\nconcentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Central America. Under a high vulnerability-high\nwarming scenario, up to 183 million additional people are projected to become undernourished in low-income\ncountries due to climate change by 2050.\nAfrica is the continent with the world\u2019s youngest population (40% of the population are under 15 years old).\nHere, climate change will significantly increase the number of children with severe stunting (impaired growth\nand development which often leads to limited physical and cognitive potential), by approximately 1.4 million\nby 2050 under 2.1\u00b0C of warming due to malnutrition. The lack of food and under-nutrition are strongly linked\nwith hot climates in the sub-Saharan area and less rainfall in West and Central Africa. Climate change can\nundermine children\u2019s educational attainment, thus reducing their chances for well-paid jobs or higher incomes\nlater in life.\nThe concerning news is: all these projected impacts will not only reduce the prospects of sustainable\ndevelopment, but our Working Group II Report also projects an increase in poverty and inequality as well as\nincreased involuntary migration of people due to climate change. These responses follow expected climate-\ndriven increases in the frequency and strength of regional wildfires, increased floods and droughts, and an\nincrease in temperature-related incidences of vector-borne, water-borne and food-borne diseases such as\ndengue, malaria, cholera and Rift Valley Fever.\nIn addition, we now know that multiple climate hazards will occur simultaneously more often in the future.\nThey may reinforce each other and result in increased impacts and risks to nature and people that are more\ncomplex and more difficult to manage. For example, reductions in crop yields due to heat and drought, made\nworse by reduced productivity because of heat stress among farmworkers, will increase food prices, reduce\nhousehold incomes and lead to health risks from malnutrition, as well as climate-related deaths, especially in\ntropical regions.\nBut there is also positive news: all these risks can be reduced substantially by taking urgent action to limit\nglobal warming and by strengthening our adaptation efforts \u2013 for example by protecting and conserving\nnature, and by improving planning and management of our cities (for details see TS FAQ 5). The youth\nmovement, together with many non-governmental organizations, has led to a rising wave of public global\nawareness of climate change and its life-threatening impacts. To successfully secure our own future and the\nfuture of the coming generations, climate risks must be factored into each decision and planning. We have the\nknowledge and the tools. Now it is our choice to make.\n330 Chapter 14: Brave New World From the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs\nNew globalization report: Three mega-trends expected to impact our future\n19 October 2017\nGlobalization has impacted people and communities across the globe and has significantly influenced\nsustainable development. Fueled by fast-paced changes in technology and the increased mobility of goods,\nservices, capital and labour, over the past decades globalization has greatly changed economies, societies and\nthe natural environment and has made our world more interconnected than ever before.\nThese trends have presented a wealth of opportunities. Globalization and increased economic interdependence\nhave accompanied \u2014 and facilitated \u2014 rapid economic growth in many countries and regions, helping\nworld GDP grow from around 50 trillion USD in 2000 to 75 trillion USD in 2016. Yet, globalization has also\npresented significant challenges, including an uneven distribution of its benefits and costs.\n\u201cTo ensure that globalization can be leveraged to support inclusive economic growth and sustainable\ndevelopment, it is essential to analyze the current system as well as emerging trends to devise policy solutions\naddressing them,\u201d said Liu Zhenmin, UN DESA\u2019s Under-Secretary-General, as he introduced the Secretary-\nGeneral\u2019s new report \u201cFulfilling the promise of globalization: advancing sustainable development in an\ninterconnected world.\u201d\nSpeaking before the UN General Assembly\u2019s Second Committee on 13 October 2017, Mr. Liu highlighted three\nmega-trends related to globalization: \u201cShifts in production and labor markets; rapid advances in technology;\nand climate change.\u201d These trends are expected to shape and influence our future.\nThe first mega-trend refers to the impact that production changes have had on labour markets, including\nthrough outsourcing and mechanization, which have spurred job losses, particularly in manufacturing sectors.\nThese trends in labour markets are associated with higher rates of income inequality, which has increased in a\nmajority of countries across the globe.\nThe second mega-trend is closely connected to the first, as it relates to the fast-moving development and\nadvancement of new technologies, including in information and communications and artificial intelligence,\nthat have also affected the world of work. While these innovations can act as catalysts for sustainable\ndevelopment, countries that do not have access to them are at risk of being left behind.\nGlobalization and its effect on climate change is the third emerging mega-trend. The report highlights that\nmany trends closely linked to globalization, including economic activity, lifestyle changes and urbanization, all\nhave an impact on our environment and may contribute to climate change.\n\u201cThe report of the Secretary-General emphasizes that globalization can be a powerful driver of economic\ngrowth, but to achieve sustainable development, globalization must work for all,\u201d Mr. Liu said, stressing also\nthat \u201cglobal agreements can play a key role in strengthening the benefits of globalization.\u201d\nSuch global agreements are already in place with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Addis\nAbaba Action Agenda on Financing for Development and the Paris Agreement on climate change. Mr. Liu\ndescribed them as \u201ca normative action plan to address many of the challenges associated with globalization.\u201d\nMr. Liu underlined the need to localize global agreements to better respond to the challenges that globalization\nposes in different contexts and stressed the role of the UN in these efforts.\n331 \u201cIt is suggested that the United Nations should continue to support Member States in devising country-specific\npolicy approaches to manage globalization in the pursuit of the 2030 Agenda,\u201d Mr. Liu said.\nImage Credits\n\u201cAn anti-globalization protest in the US. \u201c is from Seattle Municipal Archives Digital Collections.\n\u201cThe increase in world trade since 1950\u201d is from the World Trade Organization.\n\u201cChart showing the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from 1750 to 2020\u201d is from NOAA.\n\u201cA wind turbine farm for clean, sustainable, energy production\u201d is from Lawrence Livermore National\nLaboratory.\nThe author wishes to thank the staffs of\n1st Cup Coffee in Atlantic Highlands, NJ\nand\nBooskerdoo Coffee & Baking in Fair Haven, NJ,\nwhere most of this textbook was written.\n332 Chapter 14: Brave New World"
