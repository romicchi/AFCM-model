Which Future for the Capability Approach? 211\nReferences 217\nIndex 251  To Roland, Aaron and Ischa  Acknowledgements\nIn 1998, when I started to work on my PhD dissertation at Cambridge\nUniversity on the capability approach and gender inequality, there were\nvery few scholars working on the capability approach. I recall searching\non the internet for publications on the topic, not receiving more than a\nfew hundred hits (rather than the, roughly, 440,000 hits one gets today).\nI had studied economics and additional courses in social and political\nsciences and gender studies, and I had a strong intuition that, for the\nstudy of gender inequalities, the capability approach was a much more\nsuitable framework than the prevailing ways in which economists as\nwell as political theorists analysed unjustified gender inequalities. I was\nextremely lucky that Amartya Sen had agreed to supervise my doctoral\nstudies. He not only opened a world that was new for me (being the first\nin my family to study for a PhD and the first to study abroad), but also\ntaught me not to be afraid of developing myself as an interdisciplinary\nscholar. And, importantly, he very patiently helped me to grasp the\ncapability approach in all its details. The privilege of having Amartya\nSen as my PhD supervisor meant that I had the best possible access to\nthe scholar who had developed the capability approach as it emerged\nat the end of the twentieth century. When I graduated from Cambridge\nUniversity, I asked Amartya whether he was planning to write another\nbook on the capability approach, such as his classic Commodities and\nCapabilities. He smiled, shook his head and responded: \u201cNo, it has grown\nover my head\u201d. His judgement was probably very accurate \u2014 in essence\nthe problem of a literature becoming unwieldy \u2014 and that challenge\nonly became much worse over the next two decades. One way to read\nthis book is to see it as an attempt to tame the proliferation of scholarship\nabout the capability approach since the turn of the last century. 4 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nOver the last fifteen years, I have published quite a number of articles,\nbook chapters and online pieces on the capability approach, including\nmany that had as their main aim to clarify or explain certain aspects of\nit. But I kept receiving many emails from students who had questions\nabout the capability approach. Their emails, as well as conversations\nwith scholars sceptical of the importance of this approach, made it\nclear that a general introduction was necessary to answer as many of\nthese questions as possible. I decided to write an introductory overview\nof the capability approach, in which the aim was not to develop my\nown, novel version of a capability theory, but rather to try to present\na general helicopter view of the approach. In addition, I felt that too\nmany claims about or critiques of the capability approach that were\ncirculating were based either on some scholar\u2019s own interest in seeing\nthe approach develop exclusively in a certain direction, or else were\nbased on misunderstandings, often due to miscommunication between\ndifferent disciplines.\nThe result lies in front of you. Unfortunately, it took me much\nlonger to write this than I had originally planned; almost twelve\nyears lie between the initial idea and its completion. Yet in hindsight,\ndespite that at many points the ambition of writing this book felt like\na heavy psychological burden, I have no regrets that I\u2019m only now\ncompleting it. Only in the last year, after the publication of an article\nin the Journal of Human Development and Capabilities in which I offered\na general definition of the capability approach (Robeyns 2016b), did it\nbecame clear to me exactly what the general anatomy of the approach\nlooked like. Thanks to discussions with students and other scholars,\nthe generalisation of the capability approach that emerged from that\njournal article was further crystallised and polished. That generalisation\nis the heart of this book, and it is presented in chapter 2. In addition, I\nalso provide what one could see as an F.A.Q. guide to the capability\nliterature \u2014 the most frequently voiced questions and criticisms will be\nclarified and discussed in chapters 3 and 4.\nOver the many years of developing my own understanding of the\ncapability approach, I have learnt a lot from other scholars as well as\nfrom those whom I taught. Intellectually, my biggest debt is no doubt\nto Amartya Sen, who had the single most important influence on my\nintellectual development. I also learnt a lot from conversations on Acknowledgements 5\nthe capability approach with people working in different disciplines\nand in different corners of the world. I cannot possibly list everyone\nwho contributed to my understanding and thinking, yet I would like\nto express my gratitude to Bina Agarwal, Sabina Alkire, Constanze\nBinder, Harry Brighouse, Morten Fibieger Byskov, Enrica Chiappero-\nMartinetti, Rutger Claassen, Ina Conradie, Andrew Crabtree, David\nCrocker, S\u00e9verine Deneulin, Avner De-Shalit, Jay Drydryk, Des Gasper,\nPablo Gilabert, Reiko Gotoh, Govert den Hartogh, Martin van Hees,\nJane Humphries, Sakiko Fukuda-Parr, Matthias Kramm, Sem de Maagt,\nMartha Nussbaum, Ilse Oosterlaken, Antonella Picchio, Roland Pierik,\nMozaffar Qizilbash, Erik Schokkaert, Elaine Unterhalter, Robert van\nder Veen, Sridhar Venkatapuram, Polly Vizzard, Melanie Walker,\nKrushil Watene, Tom Wells, Jonathan Wolff, as well as my late friend\nand co-author Wiebke Kuklys. I also benefited a lot from teaching the\ncapability approach to hundreds of students, but in particular during a\nweek-long course at the University of the Western Cape, Cape Town, in\n2011; during a workshop at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo in March\n2016; during a Masterclass at the London School of Economics in which\nI worked on a draft of this book manuscript in February 2017; and\nduring a Research Master\u2019s tutorial in practical philosophy at Utrecht\nUniversity during the academic year 2016\u20132017.\nI benefited from the comments I received at two book manuscript\nworkshops that were held over the last year, one at the Erasmus\nUniversity Rotterdam organised by Constanze Binder and Sem de\nMaagt, and the other as a session at the 2017 Human Devolpment &\nCapability Association (HDCA) conference in Cape Town, organised\nby Morten Fibieger Byskov and Rebecca Gutwald. I benefited from the\ncomments I received at those occasions from Morten Fibieger Byskov,\nWillem van der Deijl, Monique Deveaux, Akshath Jitendranath, Caroline\nSuransky and Miriam Teschl in Rotterdam, and from Solava Ibrahim,\nSerene Khader and Henry Richardson in Cape Town. In addition, I\nalso received comments on parts of the draft manuscript from Conrad\nHeilmann, Chris Lyon, Bart Mijland, Raphael Ng, Petra van der Kooij,\nRoland Pierik and Polly Vizard. I owe special thanks to Constanze\nBinder, S\u00e9verine Deneulin, Morten Fibieger Byskov, Matthias Kramm,\nSem de Maagt and Henry Richardson, whose comments led to multiple\nsubstantive changes. Thanks also to the two anonymous reviewers who 6 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nreviewed the book proposal in 2011 and especially to Tania Burchardt,\nwho reviewed the final manuscript and provided very valuable\nsuggestions for final revisions.\nMy thanks are also due to Robert van der Veen, for his permission\nto draw on our joint work in section 3.8. I would furthermore like\nto acknowledge generous research funding from the Netherlands\nOrganisation for Scientific Research (NWO), who awarded me three\ngrants over the last 15 years that allowed me to further develop my\nresearch on the capability approach: a four-year postdoctoral scholarship\n(2002\u20132006) to work on the capability approach and theories of justice;\na VIDI grant (2006\u20132011) to work on demographic changes and social\njustice using the capability approach as one of the normative tools;\nand finally the Horizon grant (2011\u20132016) awarded to a consortium\nof scholars from three universities and led by Marcus D\u00fcwell, for an\ninterdisciplinary analysis of practical self-understanding. Thanks also\nto the team at Open Book Publishers \u2014 in particular Lucy Barnes,\nBianca Gualandi, Alice Meyer, and Alessandra Tosi \u2014 who have been a\nreal pleasure to work with.\nThis book is dedicated to my family \u2014 to my husband Roland Pierik\nand our children Aaron and Ischa. This book contains not only almost\nhalf a million characters typed and retyped by me, but also visible and\nless visible contributions from my three (little) men. Obviously, as a\nfellow political philosopher with interdisciplinary leanings, there are\ninsights from Roland in various places in this book, including some\ndirect citations. Moreover, Roland helped me not to let the best be the\nenemy of the good, and kept encouraging me to finish this book. If I\nwaited until I was happy with each sentence and paragraph, this book\nprobably would never see the light of day. Ischa\u2019s contribution may be\nthe least visible, yet it is there. It is his unconventional view of human\naffairs that keeps prompting me not to accept norms or practices that\nare unjust or make no sense. Aaron provided the artwork for the cover.\nThe woven piece very well represents the multi-dimensional nature\nof the capability approach, as well as the fact that life is made up by\none\u2019s own choice of functionings, which follows a dynamic and always\nunfinished pattern. If one has enough bright and colourful functionings,\nthey can be woven together to become something bigger than the mere\nfunctionings taken separately \u2014 a flourishing life worth living. 1. Introduction\n1.1 Why the capability approach?\nMany people who encounter the capability approach for the first time\nfind the ideas embedded within it intuitively attractive. The basic claim\nof the capability approach is that, when asking normative questions,\nwe should ask what people are able to do and what lives they are able\nto lead. That claim resonates with widespread ideas among citizens,\nacademics, and politicians about how to make policies, views about\nwhat social justice requires, or bottom-up views about development and\nsocial progress. Perhaps the most important contribution the capability\napproach makes is to prompt us to ask alternative questions, and to\nfocus on different dimensions when we make observations or when we\ngather the relevant data for making evaluations or judgements.\nWhat is the capability approach? This book will answer that question\nin detail. But let us start with a first, preliminary description, taken from\na quote by Amartya Sen, who introduced the theoretical idea of the\ncapability approach in his 1979 Tanner Lecture (Sen 1980a) and soon\nafter in empirical work (Sen and Sengupta 1983; Sen 1985a). According\nto Sen, the capability approach \u201cis an intellectual discipline that gives a\ncentral role to the evaluation of a person\u2019s achievements and freedoms\nin terms of his or her actual ability to do the different things a person\nhas reason to value doing or being\u201d (Sen 2009a, 16). As we will see later\nin this book, I will propose a definition and an account of the capability\napproach that does not exactly equal Sen\u2019s but rather can be interpreted\n\u00a9 2017 Ingrid Robeyns, CC BY 4.0 https://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0130.01 8 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nas a generalisation of Sen\u2019s definition.1 Yet Sen\u2019s definition is a good way\nto start, since it highlights that the capability approach is concerned\nwith aspects of people\u2019s lives such as their health, the education they\ncan enjoy and the support they enjoy from their social networks; it is\nalso concerned with what people can do, such as being able to work,\nraise a family, travel, or be politically active. The capability approach\ncares about people\u2019s real freedoms to do these things, and the level of\nwellbeing that they will reach when choosing from the options open to\nthem. It is a rich, multidimensional approach.\nHere\u2019s an example illustrating the difference the capability approach\nmakes. Everyone agrees that poverty needs to be combatted \u2014 but\nwho are the people that suffer from poverty? Which conceptual and\nnormative framework do we use when we identify the poor? Which\ndefinition of poverty do we use when we analyse the incidence of\npoverty in a country? As empirical research has shown, it does matter\nwhether one uses the widespread income-based metric, or whether\none takes a capability perspective and focuses on a set of thresholds of\nbasic functionings, the lack of which indicates a dimension of poverty.\nCaterina Ruggeri Laderchi (1997) used data from a Chilean household\nsurvey to investigate the extent to which an income-based measure is\nable to capture some basic functionings that could arguably be seen as\ncentral to poverty analysis: basic education, health and nutrition. She\nfound that the income variable in itself is insignificant as a determinant\nof the shortfall in health, schooling and child nutrition and that the role\nthat income plays is highly non-linear and depends on a number of\nother personal, household and regional characteristics. In other words,\nlooking at the income level in a household to determine whether the\nmembers of that household are poor may be an unreliable indicator for\nthe prevalence of poverty. The difference between, on the one hand,\nthe income-based measurements and, on the other hand, measurements\nbased on a selection of basic indicators that reflect how people are\ndoing has also been confirmed by a large number of other studies in\nthe last twenty-five years.2 It is for that income-based approach that the\n1 The exact definition and description of the capability approach that I will develop\nin this book is broader than Sen\u2019s own. The reason, as will become clear in due\ncourse, is that the \u201chaving reason to value\u201d clause in Sen\u2019s definition is, in my view,\na special case of the general definition of the capability approach.\n2 See, among others, Klasen 2000; Laderchi, Saith and Stewart 2003; Qizilbash 2002;\nReddy, Visaria and Asali 2009; Alkire et al. 2015. 1. Introduction 9\ncapability approach offers an alternative \u2014 but, as will be explained in\nthis book, it is also an alternative to many other approaches and theories,\nsuch as the happiness approach or resources-based theories of justice.\nWhile the capability approach has been used to identify the poor,\nit has also been used for many other purposes. Over the last twenty-\nfive years, the range of fields in which the capability approach has been\napplied and developed has expanded dramatically, and now includes\nglobal public health, development ethics, environmental protection\nand ecological sustainability, education, technological design, welfare\nstate policies and many, many more.3 Nor has the use of the capability\napproach been restricted to empirical research only. Some of its purposes\nhave been theoretical, such as the construction of theories of justice\n(Anderson 1999; Nussbaum 2000; Nussbaum 2006b; Claassen 2016), or\nthe development of a riches-line, which allows us to identify the rich\n(Robeyns 2017b). Other uses of the capability approach have combined\ntheoretical and empirical research, such as Jonathan Wolff and Avner\nDe-Shalit\u2019s (2007) study of disadvantage.\nFor all these endeavours, the capability approach asks: What are\npeople really able to do and what kind of person are they able to be? It asks\nwhat people can do and be (their capabilities) and what they are\nactually achieving in terms of beings and doings (their functionings).\nDo the envisioned institutions, practices and policies focus on people\u2019s\ncapabilities, that is, their opportunities to do what they value and be the\nkind of person they want to be? Do people have the same capabilities in\nlife?4 Or do global economic structures, domestic policies or brute bad\nluck make people\u2019s capabilities unequal, and if so, is that unfair and\nshould we do something about that? Do development projects focus on\n3 See section 1.4 for a more detailed discussion of the scope of the capability approach,\nand some references to the various fields in which it is now applied and developed.\n4 Some capability scholars, in particular Martha Nussbaum, have extended the\ncapability approach to include the functionings of non-human animals. In this\nbook, I restrict the discussion to human functionings and human capabilities. This\nis not to deny that the functionings of non-human animals are important, nor\nthat for some ethical questions we need to consider both humans and non-human\nanimals. There is a literature that analyses whether the capability approach can\nplausibly be extended to include non-human animals, which will not be discussed\nhere, given the focus on humans (e.g. Nussbaum 2006b; Schinkel 2008; Cripps 2010;\nWissenburg 2011; Holland and Linch 2016). Note that there is also a large literature\non \u2018the capabilities of firms\u2019, which is not related to how the term \u2018capabilities\u2019 is\nused in the capability approach. In this book, the term \u2018capabilities\u2019 refers only to\nthe capabilities of members of the human species. 10 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nexpanding people\u2019s capabilities, or do they have another public policy\ngoal (such as economic growth), or are they merely serving the interests\nof a dominant group? The capability approach thus offers a different\nperspective than alternative approaches that focus on the accumulation\nof material resources, or the mental states of people, such as their overall\nsatisfaction with their lives.\n1.2 The worries of the sceptics\nAlthough the capability approach appeals to many readers, others have\nwondered whether this theory is really any different from other more\nestablished theories, or whether the capability approach is promising as\na theory with sufficient bite. For example John Rawls (1999, 13), while\nacknowledging that the idea of basic capabilities is important, calls it \u201can\nunworkable idea\u201d for a liberal conception of justice. John Roemer (1996,\n191\u201393) has criticized the capability approach for being insufficiently\nspecified \u2014 a complaint that is also echoed in the critique made by\nPratab Bhanu Mehta (2009). Others have questioned the practical\nsignificance of the capability approach for policy making and empirical\nassessment. For instance, Robert Sugden (1993, 1953) has questioned\nthe usefulness of the capability approach for welfare economics \u2014 a\ncritique to which we will return in section 4.10. In addition, at seminars\nand other scholarly gatherings, an often-heard criticism is that the\ncapability approach is old wine in new bottles \u2014 it aims to do what the\nnon-economic social sciences have been doing all along. If that is the\ncase, then why should we bother?5\nThere are two types of answer to the sceptics. The first is conceptual\nor theoretical and that answer will be given in the remainder of this\nbook. In a nutshell, the reason the capability approach is worth our time\nand attention is that it gives us a new way of evaluating the lives of\nindividuals and the societies in which these people live their lives. The\nattention is shifted to public values currently not always considered most\nimportant \u2014 such as wellbeing, freedom and justice. It is an alternative\ndiscourse or paradigm, perhaps even a \u2018counter-theory\u2019 to a range\nof more mainstream discourses on society, poverty and prosperity.\n5 S everal more specific critiques on the capability approach will be discussed in\nchapter 4. 1. Introduction 11\nMoreover, it brings insights from several disciplines together, and gives\nscholars a common interdisciplinary language. Nevertheless, it doesn\u2019t\nfollow that the capability approach will always offer a framework that\nis to be preferred over other frameworks: as this book will show, the\ncapability approach can contribute something, but we should be careful\nnot to overplay our hand and believe that it can do a better job for all\nethical questions.\nThe second answer to the sceptic is empirical \u2014 to show the sceptic\nwhat difference the capability approach makes. The earlier mentioned\nstudy by Ruggeri Laderchi (1997) and dozens of similar studies do\nexactly that. In 2006, I provided a survey of the studies in which the\ncapability approach had been put into practice (Robeyns 2006b) \u2014 a task\nthat I think is no longer feasible today in a single paper or chapter, given\nthat the empirical literature of applications of the capability approach\nhas grown dramatically. But in order to illustrate in somewhat greater\ndepth this kind of answer to the sceptic, let us focus on one type of\nempirical application of the capability approach: namely how we\nperceive and evaluate our lives at a macro level, and how we evaluate\nthe social arrangements in which we live those lives.\n1.3 A yardstick for the evaluation of prosperity\nand progress\nFor many decades, the dominant way to measure prosperity and social\nprogress has been to focus on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or Gross\nNational Product (GNP) per capita. The more we produce, the more\ndeveloped our country has been taken to be. Yet a large literature has\nemerged showing that GDP per capita is limited and often flawed as a\nmeasure of social and economic progress (Fleurbaey 2009; Stiglitz, Sen\nand Fitoussi 2010; Fleurbaey and Blanchet 2013; Coyle 2015).\nIn one of the very first empirical applications of the capability\napproach, Amartya Sen (1985a) used some very simple statistics to\nillustrate how deceiving GDP per capita can be as a measure of prosperity\nand progress.6 Sen showed that, in the early 1980s, the (roughly\n6 An even earlier empirical study, in which the capability approach is referred to\nas the right evaluative framework, was done by Amartya Sen and Sunil Sengupta\n(1983). 12 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nequivalent) GNP per capita of Brazil and Mexico was more than seven\ntimes the (roughly equivalent) GNP per capita of India, China and Sri\nLanka \u2014 yet performances in life expectancy, infant mortality and child\ndeath rates were best in Sri Lanka, better in China compared to India\nand better in Mexico compared to Brazil. Important social indicators\nrelated to life, premature death and health, can thus not be read from\nthe average national income statistic. Another finding was that India\nperforms badly regarding basic education but has considerably higher\ntertiary education rates than China and Sri Lanka. Thus, Sen concluded\nthat the public policy of China and especially Sri Lanka towards\ndistributing food, public health measures, medical services and school\neducation have led to their remarkable achievements in the capabilities\nof survival and education. What can this application teach us about\nthe capability approach? First, the ranking of countries based on GNP\nper capita can be quite different from a ranking based on the selected\nfunctionings. Second, growth in GNP per capita should not be equated\nwith growth in living standards.\nSen has often made use of the power of comparing the differences\nin the ranking of countries based on GDP per capita with indicators\nof some essential functionings. Recently Jean Dr\u00e8ze and Amartya Sen\n(2013, 46\u201350) used the capability approach to develop an analysis of\nIndia\u2019s development policies. For example, as table 1.1 shows, they\ncompared India with the fifteen other poorest countries outside sub-\nSaharan Africa in terms of development indicators.7\nOf those sixteen countries, India ranks on top in terms of GDP\nper capita, but ranks very low for a range of functionings, such as life\nexpectancy at birth, infant mortality, undernourishment, schooling\nand literacy. Other countries, with fewer financial means, were able to\nachieve better outcomes in terms of those functionings. Once again, the\npoint is made that focussing on income-based metrics such as disposable\nincome at the household level, or GDP per capita at the national level,\ngives limited information on the lives people can lead.\n7 T hose other countries are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Burma, Cambodia, Haiti,\nKyrgyzstan, Laos, Moldova, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Tajikistan,\nUzbekistan, Vietnam and Yemen. 1.

For example, the\ncapability approach has recently also been taken up by the \u2018Better Life\nInitiative\u2019 of the OECD, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation\nand Development. The aim of this initiative is to track wellbeing, both\nin the present day and historically, by looking at ten dimensions of\nwellbeing: per capita GDP, real wages, educational attainment, life\nexpectancy, height, personal security, the quality of political institutions,\nenvironmental quality, income inequality and gender inequality.\nSeveral of these dimensions can be conceptualized through a capability\nlens and others (such as per capita GDP or real wages) are needed for\na comparison between capability dimensions and income dimensions,\nor can be seen as core capability determinants or capability inputs. In a\nrecent report, which reconstructed the outcomes on those dimensions\nbetween 1820 and 2000, it was found that some dimensions, such as\neducation and health outcomes, are strongly correlated with per capita\nGDP, but others are not \u2014 such as the quality of political institutions,\nhomicide rates and exposure to conflicts (Van Zanden et al. 2014).\nAnother example that illustrates the difference the capability\napproach can make is the analysis of gender inequality, for which it\nis clear that we are missing out the most important dimensions if we\nonly focus on how income is distributed. There are two main problems\nwith an income-based approach to gender inequalities. The first is that\nit is often assumed that income within households will be shared. Yet\nthat assumption makes most of the economic inequalities between\nwomen and men invisible (Woolley and Marshall 1994; Phipps and\nBurton 1995; Robeyns 2006a). Moreover, gender scholars across the\ndisciplines have argued that one of the most important dimensions\nof gender inequality is the distribution of burdens between men\nand women (paid work, household work and care work); the fact\nthat women are expected to do the lion\u2019s share of unpaid household\nwork and care work makes them financially vulnerable and restricts\ntheir options. Any account of gender inequality that wants to focus\non what really matters should talk about the gender division of paid\nand unpaid work, and the capability approach allows us to do that,\nsince both paid and unpaid work can be conceptualized as important 1. Introduction 15\ncapabilities of human beings (e.g. Lewis and Giullari 2005; Robeyns\n2003, 2010; Addabbo, Lanzi and Picchio 2010).\nMoreover, for millions of girls and women worldwide, the most\nimportant capability that is denied to them is extremely basic \u2014 the\ncapability to live in the first place. As Sen showed in an early study and\nas has been repeatedly confirmed since, millions of women are \u2018missing\u2019\nfrom the surface of the Earth (and from the population statistics), since\nnewborn girls have been killed or fatally neglected, or female foetuses\nhave been aborted, because they were females in a society in which\ndaughters are more likely to be seen as a burden, especially when\ncompared to sons (Sen 1990b, 2003b, 1992b; Klasen 1994; Klasen and\nWink 2003). In sum, tracking the gap between women\u2019s achievements\nin income and wealth or labour market outcomes will not reveal\nsome crucial dimensions of gender inequality, whereas the capability\napproach draws attention to these non-income-based dimensions.\nUsing the capability approach when thinking about prosperity\nand social progress has another advantage: it will impede policy\nmakers from using mistaken assumptions about human beings in\ntheir policies, including how we live together and interact in society\nand communities, what is valuable in our lives and what kind of\ngovernmental and societal support is needed in order for people (and\nin particular the disadvantaged) to flourish. For example, in their study\nof disadvantage in affluent societies, in particular the UK and Israel,\nJonathan Wolff and Avner De-Shalit discuss the effects of a government\npolicy of clearing a slum by moving the inhabitants to newly built tower\nblocks. While there may be clear material advantages to this policy \u2014 in\nparticular, improving the hygiene conditions in which people live \u2014 a\ncapabilitarian analysis will point out that this policy damages the social\naspects of people\u2019s wellbeing, since social networks and communities are\nbroken up and cannot simply be assumed to be rebuilt in the new tower\nblocks (Wolff and De-Shalit 2007, 168, 178\u201379). Since social relationships\namong people are key to their wellbeing, this may well have additional\nderivative effects on other dimensions of people\u2019s lives, such as their\nmental health. Understanding people as beings whose nature consists\nof a plurality of dimensions can help governments to think carefully\nthrough all the relevant effects of their policies. 16 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\n1.4 Scope and development\nof the capability approach\nThe previous section provides one type of answer to those who are\nsceptical about the capability approach, namely by showing what\ndifference it makes in practice. The other strand in answering the\nsceptic who asks \u201cWhy bother?\u201d is to explain in detail how one should\nunderstand the capability approach as a conceptual and theoretical\nframe and how it differs from other theoretical frameworks. After all, a\nproper understanding of what the capability approach precisely is (and\nis not) should also help in making clear what difference it can make.\nWhile this book is not framed as a reply to the sceptic, implicitly such\nan argument is made in the chapters to come.\nNevertheless, we should not simply assume that the added value\nof the capability approach is equal across cases, fields and disciplines.\nIn some areas, the difference between the capability approach and the\ndominant ways of thinking and evaluating are so significant that we can\nrightly speak of a \u2018counter-theory\u2019. In other debates and discussions, the\ndifference that the capability approach makes to the prevailing modes\nof analysis has been more limited. Moreover, the development of the\ncapability approach itself is uneven within different disciplines.\nIn some debates, the capability approach has been so much\nstudied, developed or applied that we should no longer speak of \u201cthe\npotential of the capability approach\u201d or \u201cthe promises of the capability\napproach\u201d, since the work that has been done has made quite clear what\ndifference the capability approach actually makes. The prime example\nis the literature and debate on the very idea of what development is.\nThe capability approach has made a crucial foundational contribution\nto the growth of the human development paradigm which is now well-\nknown, especially through the work of the Human Development Reports,\nwhich are annually published by the United Nations Development\nProgramme (UNDP). In addition, the most well-known of Sen\u2019s\nbooks among the wider public is Development as Freedom, which uses\nthe capability approach as a key element of his alternative vision on\ndevelopment (Sen 1999a). In economics, Sabina Alkire, James Foster and 1. Introduction 17\ntheir collaborators have made major contributions to the development\nof poverty measures based on the capability approach, with the\ndevelopment of the Multidimensional Poverty Index (Alkire and\nFoster 2011; Alkire et al. 2015). In the area of development studies, the\ncapability approach is no longer a new and emerging alternative (as it\nwas twenty to thirty years ago), but rather one of the major established\nframeworks.8\nAnother area is philosophical thinking about the metric of distributive\njustice (that is: what we ought to compare between individuals when\nwe make statements about whether certain inequalities between people\nare unjust). In this literature too, the capability approach has by now\nestablished itself as an important alternative.9 And while work on\ndevelopment and on justice perhaps stands out, there are now significant\nbodies of literature on the capability approach in many fields, such\nas health economics and public health,10 technology,11 sustainability\nanalysis and environmental policy studies,12 disability studies,13 and\n8 For some examples from the huge body of literature in development economics,\ndevelopment studies and development ethics that builds on the capability\napproach, see Alkire (2002); Clark (2002, 2005); Conradie (2013); Crocker (2008);\nDeneulin (2006a, 2006b, 2014); Drydyk (2011, 2013); Gasper (2004); Ibrahim (2011);\nKlasen (2000); Qizilbash (1996) and Qizilbash and Clark (2005).\n9 See e.g. Anderson (1999, 2010); Nussbaum (1988); Nussbaum (2000; 2006b);\nRichardson (2000); Kaufman (2007); Wolff and De-Shalit (2007); Brighouse and\nRobeyns (2010); Arneson (2010, 2013); Claassen (2014, 2016); Nielsen and Axelsen\n(2017).

For\nexample, in ethical theories within the systematic/analytical strand of\nphilosophy, the capability approach hasn\u2019t yet been much developed.\nSimilarly, one can doubt whether the capability approach has\ncontributed to a significant change in mainstream economic thinking.\nThe development of the capability approach within different academic\ndisciplines and discussions thus differs significantly, and the effect the\ncapability approach has had on developing new policies also differs\ndrastically between different policy fields.\nIn the debates where the capability approach is now well-established,\nthe development of that literature has often raised new questions. For\nexample, in philosophical theories of justice there are now enough\nconvincing arguments that the capability approach makes a difference,\nbut the very possibility of a capability theory of justice has also allowed\nus to be much more explicit about which questions remain unaddressed\nin case one wants to make a substantive theory of (distributive) justice\n(Freeman 2006; Robeyns 2016d). This is a \u2018normal\u2019 way in which a\nparadigm develops. It therefore shouldn\u2019t be surprising that we have\njust as many questions about the capability approach as we had a few\nyears ago. We may even have more, but they are different to those that\nwere raised a decade or two ago.\nWhatever the unevenness in its uptake and development between\ndisciplines, and independently of the new questions that the capability\napproach has raised, the current state of the literature which I will present\nin this book confirms that the capability approach is here to stay. It makes\na difference in many debates. It is one of those rare theories that strongly\nconnects disciplines and offers a truly interdisciplinary language. And it\nleads to recommendations on how to organise society and choose policies\nthat are often genuine alternatives for prevailing views.\n14 E.g. Terzi (2008); Walker and Unterhalter (2007); Lozano et al. (2012); Boni and\nWalker (2013); Apsan Frediani, Boni and Gasper (2014); Unterhalter (2003a, b, 2009,\n2013); Hart (2009, 2012); Peppin Vaughan (2011, 2016); Peppin Vaughan and Walker\n(2012); Saito (2003); Nussbaum (2002b, 2006a); Walker (2003, 2005, 2008, 2010,\n2012a, 2012b), Loots and Walker (2015, 2016); Mutanga and Walker (2015); Wilson-\nStrydom and Walker (2015). 1. Introduction 19\n1.5 A guide for the reader\nThis book has an extremely simple structure. There are five chapters \u2014 an\nintroduction (this chapter), a short concluding chapter (chapter 5) and\nthree very long chapters in the middle. In chapter 2 we start with a\nrather simple explanation of the capability approach, and then present\na more detailed account of capability theories, focusing in particular on\ntheir structure and properties. I will present the capability approach\nby describing it as having a modular structure \u2014 whereby each specific\ncapability theory combines the core elements of the non-optional module\nwith a range of non-core modules. This way of looking at the capability\napproach helps those who want to apply the capability approach to a\nparticular question or problem to see clearly which elements are needed\nfor such an application; it also makes it very clear that the capability\napproach can be specified in diverse ways. One could see chapter 2 as\ntrying to provide the anatomy of the capability approach \u2014 to try to see\nbehind its skin, to detect what its various organs are, how they interact\nand which ones are essential, whereas others may be more tangential.\nIn chapter 3 we discuss further details and try to clear up some\nmisunderstandings. The capability approach is a field that is notoriously\nprone to misunderstandings, in part because of its interdisciplinary\nnature, but also because the terminology differs somewhat between\ndifferent authors. Chapter 3 tries to present the literature as neutrally as\npossible and describes how it has been evolving.\nChapter 4 then zooms in on a range of critiques that have been\nmade of the capability approach, such as the argument that it is too\nindividualistic, or that it cannot properly account for power. In this\nchapter, my own voice will be more prominent, as I will engage with\nthese claims, agreeing with some of them (and, as philosophers do,\ngiving reasons why I agree), but also arguing against some other critiques.\nHere, it will become clear what the value is of the distinction between the\ngeneral capability approach and more specific capability theories, which\nI introduced elsewhere (Robeyns 2016b) and explain again in section\n2.3. As it turns out, some of the critiques are valid against particular\ncapability theories, but make no sense against the capability approach in\ngeneral. I hope that the adoption of this distinction between capability\ntheories or applications on the one hand, and capability approach on 20 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nthe other, will clear the capability literature of many confusing and\nunnecessary criticisms, so that we can devote our energy to those that\nare powerful and with which we need to engage. Moreover, let us not\nforget that the capability approach is a tool and not an end in itself; we\nshould master it as well as we can, perhaps also as efficiently as we can,\nand then move on to use it in the work that really matters. 2. Core Ideas and the Framework\n2.1 Introduction\nThe previous chapter listed a range of fields in which the capability\napproach has been taken up, and in chapters 3 and 4 we focus in more\ndetail on how the capability approach can (or cannot) make a difference\nfor thinking about wellbeing, social and distributive justice, human\nrights, welfare economics and other topics. This broad uptake of the\ncapability approach across disciplines and across different types of\nknowledge production (from theoretical and abstract to applied or\npolicy oriented) is testimony to its success. But how is the capability\napproach understood in these different fields, and is it possible to\ngive a coherent and clarifying account of how we can understand the\ncapability approach across those fields?1 In other words, how should we\nunderstand the capability approach as an overarching framework, that\nunites its more specific uses in different fields and disciplines?\n1 In developing the account of the capability approach as presented in this book, I\nhave started in an inductive way by trying to generalize from how the capability\napproach has been used in the literature. However, that literature has been critically\nscrutinized, and in some cases I have come to the conclusion that some ideas in\nthis broad \u2018capabilities literature\u2019 do not survive careful analysis, and should be\nrejected. Put differently, my methodology has been to be as inclusive as possible,\nbut not at the cost of endorsing (what I believe to be) confusions or errors.\n\u00a9 2017 Ingrid Robeyns, CC BY 4.0 https://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0130.02 22 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nThis chapter gives an account of that general framework. It provides\nexplanations and insights into what the capability approach is, what its\ncore claims are, and what additional claims we should pay attention to.\nThis chapter will also answer the question: what do we mean exactly\nwhen we say that the capability approach is a framework or an approach?\nIn other words, in this chapter, I will give an account (or a\ndescription) of the capability approach at the most general level. I will\nbracket additional details and questions about which disagreement or\nconfusion exists; chapter 3 will offer more detailed clarifications and\nchapter 4 will discuss issues of debate and dispute. Taken together, these\nthree chapters provide my understanding of the capability approach.\nChapter 2 is structured as follows. In the next section, we look at a\npreliminary definition of the capability approach. Section 2.3 proposes\nto make a distinction between \u2018the capability approach\u2019 and \u2018a capability\ntheory\u2019. This distinction is crucial \u2014 it will help us to clarify various\nissues that we will look at in this book, and it also provides some answers\nto the sceptics of the capability approach whom we encountered in the\nprevious chapter. Section 2.4 describes, from a bottom-up perspective,\nthe many ways in which the capability approach has been developed\nwithin particular theories, and argues why it is important to acknowledge\nthe great diversity within capabilitarian scholarship. Sections 2.5 to 2.11\npresent an analytic account of the capability approach, and show what is\nneeded to develop a particular capability theory, application or analysis.\nIn 2.5, I propose the modular view of the capability approach, which\nallows us to distinguish between three different types of modules that\nmake up a capability theory. The first, the A-module, consists of those\nproperties that each capability theory must have (section 2.6). This is the\nnon-optional core of each capability theory. The B-modules are a set of\nmodules in which the module itself is non-optional, but there are different\npossible choices regarding the content of the module (section 2.7). For\nexample, we cannot have a capability theory or application without\nhaving chosen a purpose for that theory or application \u2014 yet there are\nmany different purposes among which we can choose. The third group\nof modules, the C-modules, are either non-optional but dependent on\na choice made in the B-modules, or else are completely optional. For\nexample, if the purpose you choose is to measure poverty, then you\nneed to decide on some empirical methods in the C-modules; but if your 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 23\naim is to make a theory of justice, you don\u2019t need to choose empirical\nmethods and hence the C-module for empirical methods (module C3)\nis not relevant for your capability application (section 2.8).2 In the next\nsection, 2.9, I discuss the possibility of hybrid theories \u2014 theories that\ngive a central role to functionings and capabilities yet violate some\nother core proposition(s). Section 2.11 rounds up the discussion of the\nmodular view by discussing the relevance and advantages of seeing the\ncapability approach from this perspective.\nSection 2.12 summarises the conceptual aspects that have been\nexplained by presenting a visualisation of the conceptual framework of\nthe capability approach. Section 2.13 uses the modular view to illuminate\nthe observation, which has been made by several capability scholars,\nthat the capability approach has been used in a narrow and in a broad\nsense, and explains what difference lies behind this distinction. In the\nbroader use of the capability approach, supporting or complementary\ntheories or additional normative principles are added to the core of the\napproach \u2014 yet none of them is itself essential to the capability approach.\nThese are choices made in B-modules or the C-modules. The modular\nview of the capability approach that will be central to this chapter can\nthus help to formulate in a sharper manner some observations that have\nalready been made in the capability literature. The chapter closes by\nlooking ahead to the next chapter.\n2.2 A preliminary definition\nof the capability approach\nThe capability approach has in recent decades emerged as a new\ntheoretical framework about wellbeing, freedom to achieve wellbeing,\nand all the public values in which either of these can play a role, such\nas development and social justice. Although there is some scholarly\ndisagreement on the best description of the capability approach (which\nwill be addressed in this chapter), it is generally understood as a\n2 To the reader who finds this ultra-brief summary of the modular account of the\ncapability approach here unclear: please bear with me until we have reached the\nend of this chapter, when the different modules will have been unpacked and\nexplained in detail. 24 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nconceptual framework for a range of evaluative exercises, including\nmost prominently the following: (1) the assessment of individual levels\nof achieved wellbeing and wellbeing freedom; (2) the evaluation and\nassessment of social arrangements or institutions;3 and (3) the design of\npolicies and other forms of social change in society.\nWe can trace some aspects of the capability approach back to,\namong others, Aristotle, Adam Smith, Karl Marx and John Stuart Mill,4\nyet it is Sen who pioneered the approach and a growing number of\nother scholars across the humanities and the social sciences who have\nsignificantly developed it \u2014 most significantly Martha Nussbaum, who\nhas developed the capability approach into a partial theory of social\njustice.5 Nussbaum also understands her own capabilities account as a\nversion of a theory of human rights.6 The capability approach purports\nthat freedom to achieve wellbeing is a matter of what people are able to\ndo and to be, and thus the kind of life they are effectively able to lead. The\ncapability approach is generally conceived as a flexible and multipurpose\nframework, rather than a precise theory (Sen 1992a, 48; Alkire 2005;\nRobeyns 2005b, 2016b; Qizilbash 2012; Hick and Burchardt 2016, 78).\nThe open-ended and underspecified nature of the capability approach is\ncrucial, but it has not made it easier for its students to understand what\nkind of theoretical endeavour the capability approach exactly is. How\nshould we understand it? Isn\u2019t there a better account possible than the\n3 Amartya Sen often uses the term \u201csocial arrangement\u201d, which is widely used in the\nsocial choice literature and in some other parts of the literature on the capability\napproach. Yet this term is not very widely used in other disciplines, and many\nhave wondered what \u201csocial arrangement\u201d exactly means (e.g. B\u00e9teille 1993). Other\nscholars tend to use the term \u201cinstitutions\u201d, using a broad definition \u2014 understood\nas the formal and informal rules in society that structure, facilitate and delineate\nactions and interactions. \u201cInstitutions\u201d are thus not merely laws and formal rules\nsuch as those related to the system of property rights or the social security system,\nbut also informal rules and social norms, such as social norms that expect women\nto be responsible for raising the children and caring for the ill and elderly, or forbid\nmembers of different castes to work together or interact on an equal footing.\n4 S ee Nussbaum (1988, 1992), Sen (1993a, 1999a, 14, 24); Walsh (2000); Qizilbash\n(2016); Basu and L\u00f3pez-Calva (2011, 156\u201359).\n5 A partial theory of justice is a theory that gives us an account of some aspects\nof what justice requires, but does not comment on what justice requires in other\ninstances or areas.\n6 O n the relationship between capabilities and human rights, see section 3.14. 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 25\nsomewhat limited description of the capability approach as \u2018an open,\nflexible and multi-purpose framework\u2019? Answering these questions will\nbe the task of this chapter.7\nThe open and underspecified nature of the capability approach also\nexplains why the term \u2018capability approach\u2019 was adopted and is now\nwidely used rather than \u2018capability theory\u2019. Yet as I will argue in section\n2.3, we could use the terms \u2018capability theory\u2019 and \u2018capability approach\u2019\nin a more illuminating way to signify a more substantive difference,\nwhich will help us to get a better grip on the capability literature.\nIt may be helpful to introduce the term \u2018advantage\u2019 here, which is a\ntechnical term used in academic debates about interpersonal comparisons\nand in debates about distributive justice.8 A person\u2019s advantage is\nthose aspects of that person\u2019s interests that matter (generally, or in a\nspecific context). Hence \u2018advantage\u2019 could refer to a person\u2019s achieved\nwellbeing, or it could refer to her opportunity to achieve wellbeing, or\nit could refer to her negative freedoms, or to her positive freedoms, or\nto some other aspect of her interests. By using the very general term\n\u2018advantage\u2019, we allow ourselves to remain agnostic between the more\nparticular specifications of that term;9 our analysis will apply to all\nthe different ways in which \u2018advantage\u2019 could be used. This technical\nterm \u2018advantage\u2019 thus allows us to move the arguments to a higher\nlevel of generality or abstraction, since we can focus, for example, on\nwhich conditions interpersonal comparisons of advantage need to meet,\nwithout having to decide on the exact content of \u2018advantage\u2019.\n7 For earlier attempts to describe the capability approach, see amongst others\nDeneulin (2014); Gasper (2007, 1997); Alkire, Qizilbash and Comim (2008); Qizilbash\n(2012); Robeyns (2005b, 2016b).\n8 A \u2018technical term\u2019 is a term which is used in a specialist debate, and has a meaning\nthat is defined within that debate. In many cases, the term refers to something other\nthan its referent in common-sense language (that is, a layperson\u2019s use of language).\n9 To \u2018remain agnostic\u2019 means that, for the purpose of that analysis, one does not\nmake a choice between different options, and hence proceeds with an analysis that\nshould be valid for all those options. This does not mean that one cannot make a\nchoice, or really believes that all available options are equally good, but rather that\none wants to present an analysis that is applicable to as wide a range of choices as\npossible. 26 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nWithin the capability approach, there are two different specifications\nof \u2018advantage\u2019: achieved wellbeing, and the freedom to achieve\nwellbeing. The notions of \u2018functionings\u2019 and \u2018capabilities\u2019 \u2014 which will\nbe explained in detail in section 2.6.1 \u2014 are used to flesh out the account\nof achieved wellbeing and the freedom to achieve wellbeing.10 Whether\nthe capability approach is used to analyse distributive injustice, or\nmeasure poverty, or develop curriculum design \u2014 in all these projects\nthe capability approach prioritises certain people\u2019s beings and doings\nand their opportunities to realize those beings and doings (such as their\ngenuine opportunities to be educated, their ability to move around or\nto enjoy supportive social relationships). This stands in contrast to other\naccounts of advantage, which focus exclusively on mental categories\n(such as happiness) or on the material means to wellbeing (such as\nresources like income or wealth).11\nThus, the capability approach is a conceptual framework, which is\nin most cases used as a normative framework for the evaluation and\nassessment of individual wellbeing and that of institutions, in addition\nto its much more infrequent use for non-normative purposes.12 It can\nbe used to evaluate a range of values that draw on an assessment of\npeople\u2019s wellbeing, such as inequality, poverty, changes in the wellbeing\nof persons or the average wellbeing of the members of a group. It can\nalso be used as an evaluative tool providing an alternative for social\ncost-benefit analysis, or as a framework within which to design and\n10 Following Amartya Sen (1985c), some would say there are four different ideas\nof advantage in the capability approach: achieved wellbeing, freedom to achieve\nwellbeing, achieved agency, and freedom to achieve agency. Yet whether the\ncapability approach should always and for all purposes consider agency freedom\nto be an end in itself is disputed, and depends in large measure on what one wants\nto use the capability approach for.\n11 Of course, it doesn\u2019t follow that mental categories or the material means play\nno role at all; but the normative priority lies with functionings and capabilities,\nand hence happiness or material resources play a more limited role (and, in the\ncase of resources, a purely instrumental role). The relations between functionings/\ncapabilities and resources will be elaborated in 3.12; the relationship between\nfunctionings/capabilities and happiness will be elaborated in more detail in\nsection 3.8.\n12 On whether the capability approach can be used for explanatory purposes, see\nsection 3.10. 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 27\nevaluate policies and institutions, such as welfare state design in\naffluent societies, or poverty reduction strategies by governments and\nnon-governmental organisations in developing countries.\nWhat does it mean, exactly, if we say that something is a normative\nanalysis? Unfortunately, social scientists and philosophers use these\nterms slightly differently. My estimate is that, given their numerical\ndominance, the terminology that social scientists use is dominant\nwithin the capability literature. Yet the terminology of philosophers is\nmore refined and hence I will start by explaining the philosophers\u2019 use\nof those terms, and then lay out how social scientists use them.\nWhat might a rough typology of research in this area look like?\nBy drawing on some discussions on methods in ethics and political\nphilosophy (O. O\u2019Neill 2009; List and Valentini 2016), I would like\nto propose the following typology for use within the capability\nliterature. There are (at least) five types of research that are relevant\nfor the capability approach. The first type of scholarship is conceptual\nresearch, which conducts conceptual analysis \u2014 the investigation of\nhow we should use and understand certain concepts such as \u2018freedom\u2019,\n\u2018democracy\u2019, \u2018wellbeing\u2019, and so forth. An example of such conceptual\nanalysis is provided in section 3.3, where I offer a (relatively simple)\nconceptual analysis of the question of what kind of freedoms (if any)\ncapabilities could be. The second strand of research is descriptive. Here,\nresearch and analyses provide us with an empirical understanding\nof a phenomenon by describing it. This could be done with different\nmethods, from the thick descriptions provided by ethnographic methods\nto the quantitative methods that are widely used in mainstream social\nsciences. The third type of research is explanatory analysis. This research\nprovides an explanation of a phenomenon \u2014 what the mechanisms are\nthat cause a phenomenon, or what the determinants of a phenomenon\nare. For example, the social determinants of health: the parameters\nor factors that determine the distribution of health outcomes over\nthe population. A fourth type of research is evaluative, and consists of\nanalyses in which values are used to evaluate a state of affairs. A claim is\nevaluative if it relies on evaluative terms, such as good or bad, better or\nworse, or desirable or undesirable. Finally, an analysis is normative if it is 28 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nprescriptive \u2014 it entails a moral norm that tells us what we ought to do.13\nEvaluative analyses and prescriptive analyses are closely intertwined,\nand often we first conduct an evaluative analysis, which is followed by\na prescriptive analysis, e.g. by policy recommendations, as is done, for\nexample, in the evaluative analysis of India\u2019s development conducted\nby Jean Dr\u00e8ze and Amartya Sen (2013). However, one could also make\nan evaluative analysis while leaving the prescriptive analysis for\nsomeone else to make, perhaps leaving it to the agents who need to\nmake the change themselves. For example, one can use the capability\napproach to make an evaluation or assessment of inequalities between\nmen and women, without drawing prescriptive conclusions (Robeyns\n2003, 2006a). Or one can make a prescriptive analysis that is not based\non an evaluation, because it is based on universal moral rules. Examples\nare the capability theories of justice by Nussbaum (2000; 2006b) and\nClaassen (2016).\nThe difference with the dominant terminology used by economists\n(and other social scientists) is that they only distinguish between two\ntypes of analysis: \u2018positive\u2019 versus \u2018normative\u2019 economics, whereby\n\u2018positive\u2019 economics is seen as relying only on \u2018facts\u2019, whereas \u2018normative\neconomics\u2019 also relies on values (e.g. Reiss 2013, 3). Hence economists\ndo not distinguish between what philosophers call \u2018evaluative analysis\u2019\nand \u2018normative analysis\u2019 but rather lump them both together under\nthe heading \u2018normative analysis\u2019. The main take-home message is that\nthe capability approach is used predominantly in the field of ethical\nanalysis (philosophers\u2019 terminology) or normative analysis (economists\u2019\nterminology), somewhat less often in the fields of descriptive analysis\nand conceptual analysis, and least in the field of explanatory analysis.\nWe will revisit this in section 3.10, where we address whether the\ncapability approach can be an explanatory theory.\n13 Alkire (2008) calls these normative applications \u201cprospective analysis\u201d, and argues\nthat we need to distinguish the evaluative applications of the capability approach\nfrom the \u201cprospective applications\u201d of the capability approach. I agree, but since we\nshould avoid introducing new terms when the terms needed are already available,\nit would be better to use the term \u2018prescriptive applications\u2019 or, as philosophers do,\n\u2018normative analysis\u2019, rather than introducing \u2018prospective applications\u2019 as a new\nterm. 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 29\n2.3 The capability approach\nversus capability theories\nThe above preliminary definition highlights that the capability\napproach is an open-ended and underspecified framework, which\ncan be used for multiple purposes. It is open-ended because the general\ncapability approach can be developed in a range of different directions,\nwith different purposes, and it is underspecified because additional\nspecifications are needed before the capability approach can become\neffective for a particular purpose \u2014 especially if we want it to be\nnormative (whether evaluative or prescriptive). As a consequence, \u2018the\ncapability approach\u2019 itself is an open, general idea, but there are many\ndifferent ways to \u2018close\u2019 or \u2018specify\u2019 this notion. What is needed for this\nspecifying or closing of the capability approach will depend on the\naim of using the approach, e.g. whether we want to develop it into a\n(partial) theory of justice, or use it to assess inequality, or conceptualise\ndevelopment, or use it for some other purpose.\nThis distinction between the general, open, underspecified capability\napproach, and its particular use for specific purposes is absolutely\ncrucial if we want to understand it properly. In order to highlight that\ndistinction, but also to make it easier for us to be clear when we are\ntalking about the general, open, underspecified capability approach,\nand when we are talking about a particular use for specific purposes,\nI propose that we use two different terms (Robeyns 2016b, 398). Let us\nuse the term \u2018the capability approach\u2019 for the general, open, underspecified\napproach, and let us employ the term \u2018a capability theory\u2019 or \u2018a capability\nanalysis, capability account or capability application\u2019 for a specific use of\nthe capability approach, that is, for a use that has a specific goal, such\nas measuring poverty and deriving some policy prescriptions, or\ndeveloping a capabilitarian cost-benefit analysis, or theorising about\nhuman rights, or developing a theory of social justice. In order to\nimprove readability, I will speak in what follows of \u2018a capability theory\u2019\nas a short-hand for \u2018a capability account, or capability application, or\ncapability theory\u2019.14\n14 I kindly request readers who are primarily interested in the capability approach\nfor policy design and (empirical) applications to read \u2018capability application\u2019 every\ntime the term \u2018capability theory\u2019 is used. 30 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nOne reason why this distinction between \u2018capability approach\u2019 and\n\u2018capability theory\u2019 is so important, is that many theories with which the\ncapability approach has been compared over time are specific theories,\nnot general open frameworks. For example, John Rawls\u2019s famous\ntheory of justice is not a general approach but rather a specific theory\nof institutional justice (Rawls 2009), and this has made the comparison\nwith the capability approach at best difficult (Robeyns 2008b). The\nappropriate comparison would be Rawls\u2019s theory of justice with a\nproperly developed capability theory of justice, such as Nussbaum\u2019s\nFrontiers of Justice (Nussbaum 2006b), but not Rawls\u2019s theory of justice\nwith the (general) capability approach.\nAnother reason why the distinction between \u2018capability approach\u2019\nand \u2018capability theory\u2019 is important, is that it can help provide an\nanswer to the \u201cnumber of authors [who] \u2018complain\u2019 that the capability\napproach does not address questions they put to it\u201d (Alkire 2005, 123).\nThat complaint is misguided, since the capability approach cannot, by\nits very nature, answer all the questions that should instead be put to\nparticular capability theories. For example, it is a mistake to criticise\nAmartya Sen because he has not drawn up a specific list of relevant\nfunctionings in his capability approach; that critique would only have\nbite if Sen were to develop a particular capability theory or capability\napplication where the selection of functionings is a requirement.15\nIn short, there is one capability approach and there are many\ncapability theories, and keeping that distinction sharply in mind should\nclear up many misunderstandings in the literature.\nHowever, if we accept the distinction between capability theories\nand the capability approach, it raises the question of what these\ndifferent capability theories have in common. Before addressing that\nissue, I first want to present a bottom-up description of the many\nmodes in which capability analyses have been conducted. This will\ngive us a better sense of what the capability approach has been used\nfor, and what it can do for us.\n15 Yet even for capability theories, it is unlikely that Sen would agree that he has to\ndraw up a list of capabilities, since he is a proponent of a procedural method for\nselecting capabilities. At the beginning of this century, there was a fierce discussion\nin the capability literature about whether it was a valid critique of Sen\u2019s work that\nit lacked a specific list (Nussbaum 2003a; Robeyns 2003; Sen 2004a; Qizilbash 2005).\nLuckily that debate seems to be settled now. For an overview of the different ways\nin which dimensions can be selected in the capability approach, see section 2.7.2. 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 31\n2.4 The many modes of capability analysis\nIf the capability approach is an open framework, then what are the ways\nin which it has been closed to form more specific and powerful analyses?\nScholars use the capability approach for different types of analysis,\nwith different goals, relying on different methodologies, with different\ncorresponding roles for functionings and capabilities. Not all of these\nare capability theories; some are capability applications, both empirical\nas well as theoretical. We can observe that there is a rich diversity of\nways in which the capability approach has been used. Table 2.1 gives\nan overview of these different usages, by listing the different types of\ncapability analyses.\nNormative theorising within the capability approach is often done\nby moral and political philosophers. The capability approach is then\nused as one element of a normative theory, such as a theory of justice\nor a theory of disadvantage. For example, Elizabeth Anderson (1999)\nhas proposed the outlines of a theory of social justice (which she calls\n\u201cdemocratic equality\u201d) in which certain basic levels of capabilities that\nare needed to function as equal citizens should be guaranteed to all.\nMartha Nussbaum (2006b) has developed a minimal theory of social\njustice in which she defends a list of basic capabilities that everyone\nshould be entitled to, as a matter of human dignity.\nWhile most normative theorising within the capability approach\nhas related to justice, other values have also been developed and\nanalysed using the capability approach. Some theorists of freedom\nhave developed accounts of freedom or rights using the capability\napproach (van Hees 2013). Another important value that has been\nstudied from the perspective of the capability approach is ecological\nsustainability (e.g. Anand and Sen 1994, 2000; Robeyns and Van der\nVeen 2007; Lessmann and Rauschmayer 2013; Crabtree 2013; Sen\n2013). Efficiency is a value about which very limited conceptual\nwork is done, but which nevertheless is inescapably normative, and\nit can be theorised in many different ways (Le Grand 1990; Heath\n2006). If we ask what efficiency is, we could answer by referring to\nPareto optimality or x-efficiency, but we could also develop a notion\nof efficiency from a capability perspective (Sen 1993b). Such a notion\nwould answer the question \u2018efficiency of what?\u2019 with \u2018efficiency in the\nspace of capabilities (or functionings, or a mixture)\u2019. 32 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\n;4991 nnamsseL snyeboR .7002 treakkohcS dna ;5102 yelgiW-ulnuyokkA /elbaliava\nneS ;7991 muabssuN tilahS-eD ;3002 miharbI eriklA .0002 eidarnoC ;c6002\nneS\nselpmaxE dna ;3102 ,2991 snyeboR ;3891 .la te ittenitraM-oreppaihC .3102 eb\ndnanA ;3102 reyamhcsuaR muabssuN ;0002 dna dna ;4102 ;5002 eriklA ;b3002 snyeboR yam\n,2102 siareL dnalloH neS sylkuK seeH seiduts\n;b3991 muabssuN ffloW ;2002 dna ;1102 retlahretnU ;b3991 dna ].dedeen\nnav\neertbarC\n;c6102 ;b6002 eriklA ,yonaC hcnyK ;a5891 retsoF yelgiW rehtO[\n;0102 .7102 .3102 ;6002\nneS dna neS era\nsisylana dna eht fo snosirapmoc deliatne eht .sisylana aedi\nsgninoitcnuf gnieb fo .evitarran eht .detadpu\nseitilibapac ni laudividni trap\nycnerruc/cirtem fo\nytilibapac era si si evitamron .srotacidni eht noitasilautpecnoc\ntaht taht taht fo dna\nlanosrepretni a ]?selor\ntrap\neulav fo fo dednapxe\nfo egatnavda .desylana cirtem egatnavda stnemelE .noiton\nfo eloR eht deilppa laicoS sa desU rehtO[\nsedom ehT\nni A ro\n,)a5002(\nlacitilop ni sdnarts .secneics sdnarts\nniam enilpicsid/ygolodohteM lacidem cimonoce sdnarts\nscihte seitinamuh\nralucitrap snyeboR\nlaciripme\nehT evitamron .g.e( tnempoleved evitamron .secneics laicos laciripme .secneics .sisylana\n,scihte-oib ]?sdohtem\n1.2 :ecruoS\nni scihte suoirav suoirav\nelbaT ,yhposolihP .yhposolihp evitatitnauQ evitatilauQ lautpecnoC\ndna laicos laicos\ndeilppA dna\nscihte ,scihte ,scihte nihtiw nihtiw rehtO[\n).cte eht dna\nseiroeht\nevitpircsed/noitpircsed seulav\n,sisylana\n,ytilibaniatsus erutan ,secitcarp .)seiroeht\n,sthgir .ngised\nlaog fo( .g.e efil eht\nseiroeht deilppa eht naht\ncimetsipE ,)seulav fo\nnamuh ycilop ytilauq/erafleW gnidnatsrednU ,saedi evitamron\n.cte .tnemerusaem rehto( ]?slaog\nevitamroN ralucitrap ,ecitsuj ,gniebllew ,ycneiciffe evitamroN gnidulcni .sisylana niatrec\nsnoiton\nrehtO[\nkcihT eht\nfo fo ni 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 33\nQuantitative social scientists, especially economists, are mostly\ninterested in measurement. This quantitative work could serve\ndifferent purposes, e.g. the measurement of multidimensional\npoverty analysis (Alkire and Foster 2011; Alkire et al. 2015), or the\nmeasurement of the disadvantages faced by disabled people (Kuklys\n2005; Zaidi and Burchardt 2005). Moreover, some quantitative social\nscientists, mathematicians, and econometricians have been working\non investigating the methods that could be used for quantitative\ncapability analyses (Kuklys 2005; Di Tommaso 2007; Krishnakumar\n2007; Krishnakumar and Ballon 2008; Krishnakumar and Nagar 2008).\nThick description or descriptive analysis is another mode of\ncapability analysis. For example, it can be used to describe the realities\nof schoolgirls in countries that may have formal access to school for both\ngirls and boys, but where other hurdles (such as high risk of rape on the\nway to school, or the lack of sanitary provisions at school) mean that this\nformal right is not enough to guarantee these girls the corresponding\ncapability (Unterhalter 2003b).\nFinally, the capability approach can be used for conceptual work\nbeyond the conceptualisation of values, as is done within normative\nphilosophy. Sometimes the capability approach lends itself well to\nproviding a better understanding of a certain phenomenon. For example,\nwe could understand education as a legal right or as an investment in\nhuman capital, but we could also conceptualise it as the expansion of a\ncapability, or develop an account of education that draws on both the\ncapability approach and human rights theory. This would not only help\nus to look differently at what education is; a different conceptualisation\nwould also have normative implications, for example related to the\ncurriculum design, or to answer the question of what is needed to\nensure that capability, or of how much education should be guaranteed\nto children with low potential market-related human capital (McCowan\n2011; Nussbaum 2012; Robeyns 2006c; Walker 2012a; Walker and\nUnterhalter 2007; Wigley and Akkoyunlu-Wigley 2006).\nOf course, texts and research projects often have multiple goals, and\ntherefore particular studies often mix these different goals and methods.\nJean Dr\u00e8ze and Amartya Sen\u2019s (1996, 2002, 2013) comprehensive\nanalyses of India\u2019s human development achievements are in part an\nevaluative analysis based on various social indicators, but also in part 34 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\na prescriptive analysis. Similarly, Nussbaum\u2019s (2000) book Women and\nHuman Development is primarily normative and philosophical, but\nalso includes thick descriptions of how institutions enable or hamper\npeople\u2019s capabilities, by focussing on the lives of particular women.\nWhat is the value of distinguishing between different uses of\nthe capability approach? It is important because functionings and\ncapabilities \u2014 the core concepts in the capability approach \u2014 play\ndifferent roles in each type of analysis. In quality of life measurement,\nthe functionings and capabilities are the social indicators that reflect a\nperson\u2019s quality of life. In thick descriptions and descriptive analysis, the\nfunctionings and capabilities form part of the narrative. This narrative\ncan aim to reflect the quality of life, but it can also aim to understand\nsome other aspect of people\u2019s lives, such as by explaining behaviour\nthat might appear irrational according to traditional economic analysis,\nor revealing layers of complexities that a quantitative analysis can rarely\ncapture. In philosophical reasoning, the functionings and capabilities\nplay yet another role, as they are often part of the foundations of a\nutopian account of a just society or of the goals that morally sound\npolicies should pursue.\nThe flexibility of functionings and capabilities, which can be applied\nin different ways within different types of capability analysis, means that\nthere are no hard and fast rules that govern how to select the relevant\ncapabilities. Each type of analysis, with its particular goals, will require\nits own answer to this question. The different roles that functionings\nand capabilities can play in different types of capability analyses have\nimportant implications for the question of how to select the relevant\ncapabilities: each type of analysis, with its particular goals, will require\nits own answer to this question. The selection of capabilities as social\nindicators of the quality of life is a very different undertaking from\nthe selection of capabilities for a utopian theory of justice: the quality\nstandards for research and scholarship are different, the epistemic\nconstraints of the research are different, the best available practices in\nthe field are different. Moral philosophers, quantitative social scientists,\nand qualitative social scientists have each signed up to a different set\nof meta-theoretical assumptions, and find different academic practices 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 35\nacceptable and unacceptable. For example, many ethnographers tend to\nreject normative theorising and also often object to what they consider\nthe reductionist nature of quantitative empirical analysis, whereas many\neconomists tend to discard the thick descriptions by ethnographers,\nclaiming they are merely anecdotal and hence not scientific.\nTwo remarks before closing this section. First, providing a typology\nof the work on the capability approach, as this section attempts to do,\nremains work in progress. In 2004, I could only discern three main\nmodes of capability analysis: quality of life analysis; thick description/\ndescriptive analysis; and normative theories \u2014 though I left open the\npossibility that the capability approach could be used for other goals\ntoo (Robeyns 2005a). In her book Creating Capabilities, Nussbaum\n(2011) writes that the capability approach comes in only two modes:\ncomparative qualify of life assessment, and as a theory of justice. I don\u2019t\nthink that is correct: not all modes of capability analysis can be reduced\nto these two modes, as I have argued elsewhere in detail (Robeyns 2011,\n2016b). The different modes of capability analysis described in table 2.1\nprovide a more comprehensive overview, but we should not assume\nthat this overview is complete. It is quite likely that table 2.1 will, in\ndue course, have to be updated to reflect new types of work that uses\nthe capability approach. Moreover, one may also prefer another way\nto categorise the different types of work done within the capability\nliterature, and hence other typologies are possible and may be more\nilluminating.\nSecond, it is important that we fully acknowledge the diversity of\ndisciplines, the diversity of goals we have for the creation of knowledge,\nand the diversity of methods used within the capability approach. At\nthe same time, we need not forget that some aspects of its development\nmight need to be discipline-specific, or specific for one\u2019s goals. As a\nresult, the capability approach is at the same time multidisciplinary,\ninterdisciplinary, but also forms part of developments within disciplines\nand methods. These different \u2018faces\u2019 of the capability approach all need\nto be fully acknowledged if we want to understand it in a nuanced and\ncomplete way. 36 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\n2.5 The modular view of the capability approach\nIt is time to take stock. What do we already know about the capability\napproach, and what questions are raised by the analysis so far?\nThe capability approach is an open approach, and depending on\nits purpose can be developed into a range of capability theories or\ncapabilitarian applications. It is focused on what people can do and\nbe (their capabilities) and on what they are actually achieving in terms\nof beings and doings (their functionings). However, this still does\nnot answer the question of what kind of framework the capability\napproach is. Can we give an account of a capability theory that is more\nenlightening regarding what exactly makes a theory a capabilitarian\ntheory, and what doesn\u2019t?\nIn this book, I present an account of the capability approach that,\non the one hand, makes clear what all capability theories share, yet on\nthe other hand allows us to better understand the many forms that a\ncapability theory or capability account can take \u2014 hence to appreciate\nthe diversity within the capability approach more fully. The modular\nview that I present here is a modified (and, I hope, improved) version\nof the cartwheel model that I have developed elsewhere (Robeyns\n2016b). The modular view shifts the focus a little bit from the question\nof how to understand the capability approach in general, to the\nquestion of how the various capability accounts, applications and\ntheories should be understood and how they should be constructed.\nAfter all, students, scholars, policy makers and activists are often not\nconcerned with the capability approach in general, but rather want to\nknow whether it would be a smart idea to use the capability approach\nto construct a particular capability theory, application or account for\nthe problem or question they are trying to analyse. In order to answer\nthe question of whether, for their purposes, the capability approach is\na helpful framework to consider, they need to know what is needed\nfor a capability theory, application or account. The modular view that\nwill follow will give those who want to develop a capability theory,\napplication or analysis a list of properties their theory has to meet,\na list of choices that need to be made but in which several options\nregarding content are possible, and a list of modules that they could\ntake into account, but which will not always be necessary. 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 37\nRecall that in order to improve readability, I use the term \u2018a capability\ntheory\u2019 as a short-hand for \u2018a capability account, or capability analysis,\nor capability application, or capability theory\u2019. A capability theory is\nconstructed based on three different types of module, which (in order\nto facilitate discussion) will be called the A-module, B-modules and\nC-modules. The A-module is a single module which is compulsory\nfor all capability theories. The A-module consists of a number of\npropositions (definitions and claims) which a capability theory should\nnot violate. This is the core of the capability approach, and hence entails\nthose properties that all capability theories share. The B-modules consist\nof a range of non-optional modules with optional content. That is, if\nwe construct a capability theory, we have to consider the issue that the\nmodule addresses, but there are several different options to choose from\nin considering that particular issue. For example, module B1 concerns the\n\u2018purpose\u2019 of the theory: do we want to make a theory of justice, or a more\ncomprehensive evaluative framework for societal institutions, or do we\nwant to measure poverty or inequality, or design a curriculum, or do we\nwant to use the capability approach to conceptualise \u2018social progress\u2019\nor \u2018efficiency\u2019 or to rethink the role of universities in the twenty-first\ncentury? All these purposes are possible within the capability approach.\nThe point of seeing these as B-modules is that one has to be clear about\none\u2019s purpose, but there are many different purposes possible. The\nC-modules are either contingent on a particular choice made in a\nB-module, or they can be fully optional. For example, one can offer a\ncomprehensive evaluation of a country\u2019s development path, and decide\nthat as part of this evaluation, one wants to include particular accounts\nof the history and culture of that country, since this may make more\ncomprehensible the reasons why that country has taken this particular\ndevelopment path rather than another. The particular historical account\nthat would be part of one\u2019s capability theory would then be optional.16\n16 To say that the insertion of those theories is fully optional is not the same as saying\nthat capability theories that will be developed with different types of additional\ncomplementary theories will all be equally good. For example, historians are very\nlikely to think that most theories, even normative theories, have to be historically\ninformed, and hence the relevant historical knowledge will need to be added to\na capability theory. But these are matters of dispute that have to be debated, and\ncannot be settled by narrowing down the definition of a capability theory. 38 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nGiven this three-fold structure of the modular view of capability\ntheories, let us now investigate what the content of the compulsory\nmodule A is, as well as what the options are within the B-modules and\nC-modules.\n2.6 The A-module: the non-optional core\nof all capability theories\nWhat, then, is the content of the A-module, which all capability theories\nshould share? Table 2.2 presents the keywords for the eight elements of\nthe A-module.\nTable 2.2 The content of the compulsory module A\nA1: Functionings and capabilities as core concepts\nA2: Functionings and capabilities are value-neutral categories\nA3: Conversion factors\nA4: The distinction between means and ends\nA5: Functionings and/or capabilities form the evaluative space\nA6: Other dimensions of ultimate value\nA7: Value pluralism\nA8: Valuing each person as an end\n2.6.1 A1: Functionings and capabilities\nFunctionings and capabilities are the core concepts in the capability\napproach. They are also the dimensions in which interpersonal\ncomparisons of \u2018advantage\u2019 are made (this is what property A5\nentails).17 They are the most important distinctive features of all\ncapabilitarian theories. There are some differences in the usage of these\nnotions between different capability theorists,18 but these differences\ndo not affect the essence of these notions: capabilities are what people\nare able to be and to do, and functionings point to the corresponding\nachievements.\n17 See section 2.2 for an explanation of the technical term \u2018advantage\u2019.\n18 For some core differences in the way Martha Nussbaum and Amartya Sen use the\nterms \u2018functionings\u2019 and \u2018capabilities\u2019, see section 3.2. 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 39\nCapabilities are real freedoms or real opportunities, which do\nnot refer to access to resources or opportunities for certain levels of\nsatisfaction. Examples of \u2018beings\u2019 are being well-nourished, being\nundernourished, being sheltered and housed in a decent house, being\neducated, being illiterate, being part of a supportive social network;\nthese also include very different beings such as being part of a criminal\nnetwork and being depressed. Examples of the \u2018doings\u2019 are travelling,\ncaring for a child, voting in an election, taking part in a debate, taking\ndrugs, killing animals, eating animals, consuming great amounts of fuel\nin order to heat one\u2019s house, and donating money to charity.\nCapabilities are a person\u2019s real freedoms or opportunities to achieve\nfunctionings.19 Thus, while travelling is a functioning, the real\nopportunity to travel is the corresponding capability. A person who\ndoes not travel may or may not be free and able to travel; the notion\nof capability seeks to capture precisely the fact of whether the person\ncould travel if she wanted to. The distinction between functionings\nand capabilities is between the realized and the effectively possible, in\nother words, between achievements, on the one hand, and freedoms or\nopportunities from which one can choose, on the other.\nFunctionings are constitutive of human life. At least, this is a\nwidespread view, certainly in the social sciences, policy studies, and\nin a significant part of philosophy \u2014 and I think it is a view that is\nhelpful for the interdisciplinary, practical orientation that the vast\nmajority of capability research has.20 That means one cannot be a human\nbeing without having at least a range of functionings; they make the\nlives of human beings both lives (as opposed to the existence of innate\nobjects) and human (in contrast to the lives of trees or animals). Human\nfunctionings are those beings and doings that constitute human life and\nthat are central to our understandings of ourselves as human beings.\nIt is hard to think of any phenomenological account of the lives of\n19 See also section 3.3 which discusses in more depth the kind of freedoms or\nopportunities that capabilities are.\n20 The exceptions are those philosophers who want to develop normative theories\nwhile steering away from any metaphysical claims (that is, claims about how things\nare when we try to uncover their essential nature). I agree that the description of\n\u2018functionings\u2019 and \u2018capabilities\u2019 in this section makes metaphysical claims, but I\nthink they are very \u2018minimal\u2019 (in the sense that they are not wildly implausible, and\nstill leave open a wide variety of theories to be developed) and hence we should not\nbe troubled by these metaphysical assumptions. 40 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nhumans \u2014 either an account given by a human being herself, or an\naccount from a third-person perspective \u2014 which does not include a\ndescription of a range of human functionings. Yet, not all beings and\ndoings are functionings; for example, flying like a bird or living for two\nhundred years like an oak tree are not human functionings.\nIn addition, some human beings or doings may not be constitutive\nbut rather contingent upon our social institutions; these, arguably,\nshould not qualify as \u2018universal functionings\u2019 \u2014 that is, functionings\nno matter the social circumstances in which one lives \u2014 but are rather\n\u2018context-dependent functionings\u2019, functionings that are to a significant\nextent dependent on the existing social structures. For example, \u2018owning\na house\u2019 is not a universal functioning, yet \u2018being sheltered in a safe way\nand protected from the elements\u2019 is a universal functioning. One can also\ninclude the capability of being sheltered in government-funded housing\nor by a rental market for family houses, which is regulated in such a\nway that it does not endanger important aspects of that capability.\nNote that many features of a person could be described either as a\nbeing or as a doing: we can say that a person is housed in a pleasantly\nwarm dwelling, or that this person does consume lots of energy to keep her\nhouse warm. Yet other functionings are much more straightforwardly\ndescribed as either a being or a doing, for example \u2018being healthy\u2019 (a\nbeing) or \u2018killing animals\u2019 (a doing).\nA final remark. Acknowledging that functionings and capabilities\nare the core concepts of the capability approach generates some further\nconceptual questions, which have not all been sufficiently addressed in\nthe literature. An important question is whether additional structural\nrequirements that apply to the relations between various capabilities\nshould be imposed on the capability approach in general (not merely\nas a particular choice for a specific capability theory). Relatively little\nwork has been done on the question of the conceptual properties\nof capabilities understood as freedoms or opportunities and on the\nquestion of the minimum requirements of the opportunity set that\nmake up these various capabilities. But it is clear that more needs to\nbe said about which properties we want functionings, capabilities, and\ncapability sets to meet. One important property has been pointed out\nby Kaushik Basu (1987), who argued that the moral relevance lies not in\nthe various capabilities each taken by themselves and only considering 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 41\nthe choices made by one person. Rather, the moral relevance lies in\nwhether capabilities are truly available to us given the choices made by\nothers, since that is the real freedom to live our lives in various ways,\nas it is truly open to us. For example, if a teenager lives in a family in\nwhich there are only enough resources for one of the children to pursue\nhigher education, then he only truly has the capability to pursue higher\neducation if none of his older siblings has made that choice before him.21\n2.6.2 A2: Functionings and capabilities\nare value-neutral categories\nFunctionings and capabilities are defined in a value-neutral way. Many\nfunctionings are valuable, but not all functionings necessarily have a\npositive value. Instead, some functionings have no value or even have\na negative value, e.g. the functioning of being affected by a painful,\ndebilitating and ultimately incurable illness, suffering from excessive\nlevels of stress, or engaging in acts of unjustifiable violence. In those\nlatter cases, we are better off without that functionings outcome,\nand the functionings outcome has a negative value. Functionings are\nconstitutive elements of human life, which consist of both wellbeing\nand ill-being. The notion of functionings should, therefore, be value-\nneutral in the sense that we should conceptually allow for the idea of\n\u2018bad functionings\u2019 or functionings with a negative value (Deneulin and\nStewart 2002, 67; Nussbaum 2003a, 45; Stewart 2005, 190; Carter 2014,\n79\u201381).\nThere are many beings and doings that have negative value, but they\nare still \u2018a being\u2019 or \u2018a doing\u2019 and, hence, a functioning. Nussbaum made\nthat point forcefully when she argued that the capability to rape should\nnot be a capability that we have reason to protect (Nussbaum 2003:\n44\u201345). A country could effectively enable people to rape, for example,\neither when rape is not illegal (as it is not between husband and wife in\nmany countries), or when rape is illegal, but de facto never leads to any\n21 Arguably, some of that work is being done by social choice theorists and others\nworking with axiomatic methods, but unfortunately almost none of the insights\nof that work have spread among the disciplines within the capability literature\nwhere axiomatic and other formal methods are not used (and, presumably, not well\nunderstood). See, for example, Pattanaik (2006); Xu (2002); Gotoh, Suzumura and\nYoshihara (2005); Gaertner and Xu (2006, 2008). 42 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\npunishment of the aggressor. If there is a set of social norms justifying\nrape, and would-be rapists help each other to be able to rape, then\nwould-be rapists in that country effectively enjoy the capability to rape.\nBut clearly, rape is a moral bad, and a huge harm to its victims; it is thus\nnot a capability that a country should want to protect. This example\nillustrates that functionings as well as capabilities can be harmful or\nhave a negative value, as well as be positive or valuable. At an abstract\nand general level, \u2018functionings\u2019 and \u2018capabilities\u2019 are thus in themselves\nneutral concepts, and hence we cannot escape the imperative to decide\nwhich ones we want to support and enable, and which ones we want to\nfight or eliminate. Frances Stewart and S\u00e9verine Deneulin (2002, 67) put\nit as follows:\n[\u2026] some capabilities have negative values (e.g. committing murder),\nwhile others may be trivial (riding a one-wheeled bicycle). Hence there is\na need to differentiate between \u2018valuable\u2019 and non-valuable capabilities,\nand indeed, within the latter, between those that are positive but of lesser\nimportance and those that actually have negative value.\nThe above examples show that some functionings can be unequivocally\ngood (e.g. being in good health) or unequivocally bad (e.g. being\nraped or being murdered). In those cases, there will be unanimity on\nwhether the functionings outcome is bad or good. But now we need to\nadd a layer of complexity. Sometimes, it will be a matter of doubt, or of\ndispute, whether a functioning will be good or bad \u2014 or the goodness\nor badness may depend on the context and/or the normative theory we\nendorse. An interesting example is giving care, or \u2018care work\u2019.22 Clearly\nbeing able to care for someone could be considered a valuable capability.\nFor example, in the case of child care, there is much joy to be gained, and\nmany parents would like to work less so as to spend more time with\ntheir children. But care work has a very ambiguous character if we try\nto answer whether it should be considered to be a valuable functioning\nfrom the perspective of the person who does the care. Lots of care is\nperformed primarily because there is familial or social pressure put on\nsomeone (generally women) to do so, or because no-one else is doing it\n22 On the complex nature of \u2018care\u2019, and what the need to care and be cared for requires\nfrom a just society, see e.g. Tronto (1987); Kittay (1999); Nussbaum (2006b); Folbre\n(1994); Folbre and Bittman (2004); Engster (2007); Gheaus (2011); Gheaus and\nRobeyns (2011). 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 43\n(Lewis and Giullari 2005). There is also the hypothesis that care work\ncan be a positive functioning if done for a limited amount of time, but\nbecomes a negative functioning if it is done for many hours. Hence, from\nthe functionings outcome in itself, we cannot conclude whether this is\na positive element of that person\u2019s quality of life, or rather a negative\nelement; in fact, sometimes it will be an ambiguous situation, which\ncannot easily be judged (Robeyns 2003).\nOne could wonder, though, whether this ambiguity cannot simply\nbe resolved by reformulating the corresponding capability slightly\ndifferently. In theory, this may be true. If there are no empirical\nconstraints related to the observations we can make, then one could in\nmany cases rephrase such functionings that are ambiguously valued into\nanother capability where its valuation is clearly positive. For example,\none could say that the functioning of providing care in itself can be\nambiguous (since some people do too much, thereby harming their own\nlonger-term wellbeing, or do it because no-one else is providing the care\nand social norms require them to do it). Yet there is a closely related\ncapability that is clearly valuable: the capability to provide hands-on\ncare, which takes into account that one has a robust choice not to care if\none does not want to, and that one does not find oneself in a situation in\nwhich the care is of insufficient quantity and/or quality if one does not\ndeliver the care oneself. If such a robust capability to care is available, it\nwould be genuinely valuable, since one would have a real option not\nto choose the functioning without paying an unacceptable price (e.g.\nthat the person in need of care is not properly cared for). However,\nthe problem with this solution, of reformulating functionings that are\nambiguously valuable into capabilities that are unequivocally valuable,\nis the constraints it places on empirical information. We may be able to\nuse these layers of filters and conditions in first-person analyses, or in\nethnographic analyses, but in most cases not in large-scale empirical\nanalyses.\nMany specific capability theories make the mistake of defining\nfunctionings as those beings and doings that one has reason to value.\nBut the problem with this value-laden definition is that it collapses two\naspects of the development of a capability theory into one: the definition\nof the relevant space (e.g. income, or happiness, or functionings) and,\nonce we have chosen our functionings and capabilities, the normative 44 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\ndecision regarding which of those capabilities will be the focus of our\ntheory. We may agree on the first issue and not on the second and still\nboth rightly believe that we endorse a capability theory \u2014 yet this is\nonly possible if we analytically separate the normative choice for\nfunctionings and capabilities from the additional normative decision\nof which functionings we will regard as valuable and which we will\nnot regard as valuable. Collapsing these two normative moments into\none is not a good idea; instead, we need to acknowledge that there\nare two normative moves being made when we use functionings and\ncapabilities as our evaluative space, and we need to justify each of those\ntwo normative moves separately.\nNote that the value-laden definition of functionings and capabilities,\nwhich defines them as always good and valuable, may be less\nproblematic when one develops a capability theory of severe poverty or\ndestitution. We all agree that poor health, poor housing, poor sanitation,\npoor nutrition and social exclusion are dimensions of destitution. So, for\nexample, the dimensions chosen for the Multidimensional Poverty Index\ndeveloped by Sabina Alkire and her colleagues \u2014 health, education and\nliving standard \u2014 may not elicit much disagreement.23 But for many\nother capability theories, it is disputed whether a particular functionings\noutcome is valuable or not. The entire field of applied ethics is filled with\nquestions and cases in which these disputes are debated. Is sex work\nbad for adult sex workers, or should it be seen as a valuable capability?\nIs the capability of parents not to vaccinate their children against polio\nor measles a valuable freedom? If employees in highly competitive\norganisations are not allowed to read their emails after working hours,\nis that then a valuable capability that is taken away from them, or are we\nprotecting them from becoming workaholics and protecting them from\nthe pressure to work all the time, including at evenings and weekends?\nAs these examples show, we need to allow for the conceptual possibility\nthat there are functionings that are always valuable, never valuable,\nvaluable or non-valuable in some contexts but not in others, or where\n23 The Multidimensional Poverty Index is developed by the Oxford Poverty and\nHuman Development Initiative (OPHI), under the leadership of Sabina Alkire. See\nhttp://www.ophi.org.uk/multidimensional-poverty-index/ for a clear introduction\nof the Multidimensional Poverty Index. For scholarly papers on the Index, as well\nas other work done by the scholars in OPHI, see http://www.ophi.org.uk/resources/\nophi-working-papers/ 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 45\nwe simply are not sure. This requires that functionings and capabilities\nare conceptualised in a value-neutral way, and hence this should be a\ncore requirement of the capability approach.\n2.6.3 A3: Conversion factors\nA third core idea of the capability approach is that persons have different\nabilities to convert resources into functionings. These are called conversion\nfactors: the factors which determine the degree to which a person can\ntransform a resource into a functioning. This has been an important\nidea in Amartya Sen\u2019s version of the capability approach (Sen 1992a,\n19\u201321, 26\u201330, 37\u201338) and for those scholars influenced by his writings.\nResources, such as marketable goods and services, but also goods and\nservices emerging from the non-market economy (including household\nproduction) have certain characteristics that make them of interest to\npeople. In Sen\u2019s work in welfare economics, the notion of \u2018resources\u2019 was\nlimited to material and/or measurable resources (in particular: money\nor consumer goods) but one could also apply the notion of conversion\nfactors to a broader understanding of resources, including, for example,\nthe educational degrees that one has.\nThe example of a bike is often used to illustrate the idea of conversion\nfactors. We are interested in a bike not primarily because it is an object\nmade from certain materials with a specific shape and colour, but\nbecause it can take us to places where we want to go, and in a faster way\nthan if we were walking. These characteristics of a good or commodity\nenable or contribute to a functioning. A bike enables the functioning\nof mobility, to be able to move oneself freely and more rapidly than\nwalking. But a person might be able to turn that resource into a valuable\nfunctioning to a different degree than other persons, depending on the\nrelevant conversion factors. For example, an able-bodied person who\nwas taught to ride a bicycle when he was a child has a high conversion\nfactor enabling him to turn the bicycle into the ability to move around\nefficiently, whereas a person with a physical impairment or someone\nwho never learnt to ride a bike has a very low conversion factor. The\nconversion factors thus represent how much functioning one can get\nout of a resource; in our example, how much mobility the person can\nget out of a bicycle. 46 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nThere are several different types of conversion factors, and the\nconversion factors discussed are often categorized into three groups\n(Robeyns 2005b, 99; Crocker and Robeyns 2009, 68). All conversion\nfactors influence how a person can be or is free to convert the\ncharacteristics of the resources into a functioning, yet the sources of\nthese factors may differ. Personal conversion factors are internal to the\nperson, such as metabolism, physical condition, sex, reading skills, or\nintelligence. If a person is disabled, or if she is in a bad physical condition,\nor has never learned to cycle, then the bike will be of limited help in\nenabling the functioning of mobility. Social conversion factors are factors\nstemming from the society in which one lives, such as public policies,\nsocial norms, practices that unfairly discriminate, societal hierarchies,\nor power relations related to class, gender, race, or caste. Environmental\nconversion factors emerge from the physical or built environment in\nwhich a person lives. Among aspects of one\u2019s geographical location are\nclimate, pollution, the likelihood of earthquakes, and the presence or\nabsence of seas and oceans. Among aspects of the built environment\nare the stability of buildings, roads, and bridges, and the means of\ntransportation and communication. Take again the example of the\nbicycle. How much a bicycle contributes to a person\u2019s mobility depends\non that person\u2019s physical condition (a personal conversion factor), the\nsocial mores including whether women are generally allowed to ride a\nbicycle (a social conversion factor), and the availability of decent roads\nor bike paths (an environmental conversion factor). Once we start to be\naware of the existence of conversion factors, it becomes clear that they\nare a very pervasive phenomenon. For example, a pregnant or lactating\nwoman needs more of the same food than another woman in order to\nbe well-nourished. Or people living in delta regions need protection\nfrom flooding if they want to enjoy the same capability of being safely\nsheltered as people living in the mountains. There are an infinite number\nof other examples illustrating the importance of conversion factors. The\nthree types of conversion factor all push us to acknowledge that it is\nnot sufficient to know the resources a person owns or can use in order\nto be able to assess the wellbeing that he or she has achieved or could\nachieve; rather, we need to know much more about the person and the\ncircumstances in which he or she is living. Differences in conversion\nfactors are one important source of human diversity, which is a central 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 47\nconcern in the capability approach, and will be discussed in more detail\nin section 3.5.\nNote that many conversion factors are not fixed or given, but can\nbe altered by policies and choices that we make. And the effects of a\nparticular conversion factor can also depend on the social and personal\nresources that a person has, as well as on the other conversion factors.\nFor example, having a physical impairment that doesn\u2019t allow one to\nwalk severely restricts one\u2019s capability to be mobile if one finds oneself\nin a situation in which one doesn\u2019t have access to a wheelchair, and in\nwhich the state of the roads is bad and vehicles used for public transport\nare not wheelchair-accessible. But suppose now the built environment\nis different: all walking-impaired people have a right to a wheelchair,\nroads are wheelchair-friendly, public transport is wheelchair-accessible\nand society is characterised by a set of social norms whereby people\nconsider it nothing but self-evident to provide help to fellow travellers\nwho can\u2019t walk. In such an alternative social state, with a different\nset of resources and social and environmental conversion factors, the\nsame personal conversion factor (not being able to walk) plays out very\ndifferently. In sum, in order to know what people are able to do and be,\nwe need to analyse the full picture of their resources, and the various\nconversion factors, or else analyse the functionings and capabilities\ndirectly. The advantage of having a clear picture of the resources needed,\nand the particular conversion factors needed, is that it also gives those\naiming to expand capability sets information on where interventions\ncan be made.\n2.6.4 A4: The means-ends distinction\nThe fourth core characteristic of the capability approach is the means-\nends distinction. The approach stresses that we should always be clear,\nwhen valuing something, whether we value it as an end in itself, or as a\nmeans to a valuable end. For the capability approach, when considering\ninterpersonal comparisons of advantage, the ultimate ends are people\u2019s\nvaluable capabilities (there could be other ends as well; see 2.6.6). This\nimplies that the capability approach requires us to evaluate policies and\nother changes according to their impact on people\u2019s capabilities as well\nas their actual functionings; yet at the same time we need to ask whether 48 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nthe preconditions \u2014 the means and the enabling circumstances \u2014 for\nthose capabilities are in place. We must ask whether people are able\nto be healthy, and whether the means or resources necessary for this\ncapability, such as clean water, adequate sanitation, access to doctors,\nprotection from infections and diseases and basic knowledge on health\nissues are present. We must ask whether people are well-nourished, and\nwhether the means or conditions for the realization of this capability,\nsuch as having sufficient food supplies and food entitlements, are\nbeing met. We must ask whether people have access to a high-quality\neducation system, to real political participation, and to community\nactivities that support them, that enable them to cope with struggles in\ndaily life, and that foster caring friendships. Hence we do need to take\nthe means into account, but we can only do so if we first know what the\nends are.\nMany of the arguments that capability theorists have advanced\nagainst alternative normative frameworks can be traced back to the\nobjection that alternative approaches focus on particular means to\nwellbeing rather than the ends.24 There are two important reasons why\nthe capability approach dictates that we have to start our analysis from\nthe ends rather than the means. Firstly, people differ in their ability to\nconvert means into valuable opportunities (capabilities) or outcomes\n(functionings) (Sen 1992a, 26\u201328, 36\u201338). Since ends are what ultimately\nmatter when thinking about wellbeing and the quality of life, means can\nonly work as fully reliable proxies of people\u2019s opportunities to achieve\nthose ends if all people have the same capacities or powers to convert\nthose means into equal capability sets. This is an assumption that goes\nagainst a core characteristic of the capability approach, namely claim\nA3 \u2014 the inter-individual differences in the conversion of resources\ninto functionings and capabilities. Capability scholars believe that these\ninter-individual differences are far-reaching and significant, and hence\nthis also explains why the idea of conversion factors is a compulsory\noption in the capability approach (see 2.6.3). Theories that focus on\n24 This is a critique that the capability approach shares with the happiness approach,\nwhich also focusses on what it considers to be an end in itself \u2014 happiness. Still,\ncapability scholars have reasons why they do not endorse the singular focus on\nhappiness, as the happiness approach proposes. See section 3.8. 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 49\nmeans run the risk of downplaying the normative relevance of not only\nthese conversion factors, but also the differences in structural constraints\nthat people face (see 2.7.5).\nThe second reason why the capability approach requires us to start\nfrom ends rather than means is that there are some vitally important\nends that do not depend very much on material means, and hence\nwould not be picked up in our analysis if we were to focus on means\nonly. For example, self-respect, supportive relationships in school or in\nthe workplace, or friendship are all very important ends that people\nmay want; yet there are no crucial means to those ends that one could\nuse as a readily measurable proxy. We need to focus on ends directly if\nwe want to capture what is important.\nOne could argue, however, that the capability approach does not\nfocus entirely on ends, but rather on the question of whether a person is\nbeing put in the conditions in which she can pursue her ultimate ends.\nFor example, being able to read could be seen as a means rather than an\nend in itself, since people\u2019s ultimate ends will be more specific, such as\nreading street signs, the newspaper, or the Bible or Koran. It is therefore\nsomewhat more precise to say that the capability approach focuses on\npeople\u2019s ends in terms of beings and doings expressed in general terms:\nbeing literate, being mobile, being able to hold a decent job. Whether a\nparticular person then decides to translate these general capabilities into\nthe more specific capabilities A, B or C (e.g. reading street signs, reading\nthe newspaper or reading the Bible) is up to them. Whether that person\ndecides to stay put, travel to the US or rather to China, is in principle\nnot important for a capability analysis: the question is rather whether\na person has these capabilities in more general terms.25 Another way\nof framing this is to say that the end of policy making and institutional\ndesign is to provide people with general capabilities, whereas the ends\nof persons are more specific capabilities.26\nOf course, the normative focus on ends does not imply that the\ncapability approach does not at all value means such as material or\n25 However, while a focus on available options rather than realised choices is\nthe default normative focus of capability theories, there are some capability\napplications where, for good reasons, the focus is on achieved functionings rather\nthan capabilities. This will be elaborated in the next section.\n26 On the distinction between general capabilities and specific capabilities, see 3.2.4. 50 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nfinancial resources. Instead, a capability analysis will typically focus\non resources and other means. For example, in their evaluation of\ndevelopment in India, Jean Dr\u00e8ze and Amartya Sen (2002, 3) have\nstressed that working within the capability approach in no way\nexcludes the integration of an analysis of resources such as food. In\nsum, all the means of wellbeing, like the availability of commodities,\nlegal entitlements to them, other social institutions, and so forth, are\nimportant, but the capability approach presses the point that they are\nnot the ends of wellbeing, only their means. Food may be abundant in\nthe village, but a starving person may have nothing to exchange for it,\nno legal claim on it, or no way of preventing intestinal parasites from\nconsuming it before he or she does. In all these cases, at least some\nresources will be available, but that person will remain hungry and,\nafter a while, undernourished.27\nNevertheless, one could wonder: wouldn\u2019t it be better to focus\non means only, rather than making the normative analysis more\ncomplicated and more informationally demanding by also focusing on\nfunctionings and capabilities? Capability scholars would respond that\nstarting a normative analysis from the ends rather than means has at\nleast two advantages, in addition to the fundamental reason mentioned\nearlier that a focus on ends is needed to appropriately capture inter-\nindividual differences.\nFirst, if we start from being explicit about our ends, the valuation\nof means will retain the status of an instrumental valuation rather than\nrisk taking on the nature of a valuation of ends. For example, money or\neconomic growth will not be valued for their own sake, but only in so far\nas they contribute to an expansion of people\u2019s capabilities. For those who\nhave been working within the capability framework, this has become a\ndeeply ingrained practice \u2014 but one only needs to read the newspapers\nfor a few days to see how often policies are justified or discussed without\na clear distinction being made between means and ends.\nSecond, by starting from ends, we do not a priori assume that\nthere is only one overriding important means to those ends (such as\n27 The relationship between means and capabilities is analysed in more depth in\nsection 3.12. 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 51\nincome), but rather explicitly ask the question: which types of means are\nimportant for the fostering and nurturing of a particular capability, or\nset of capabilities? For some capabilities, the most important means will\nindeed be financial resources and economic production, but for others it\nmay be a change in political practices and institutions, such as effective\nguarantees and protections of freedom of thought, political participation,\nsocial or cultural practices, social structures, social institutions, public\ngoods, social norms, and traditions and habits. As a consequence, an\neffective capability-enhancing policy may not be increasing disposable\nincome, but rather fighting a homophobic, ethnophobic, racist or sexist\nsocial climate.\n2.6.5 A5: Functionings and capabilities\nas the evaluative space\nIf a capability theory is a normative theory (as is often the case), then\nfunctionings and capabilities form the entire evaluative space, or are\npart of the evaluative space.28 A normative theory is a theory that entails\na value judgement: something is better than or worse than something\nelse. This value judgement can be used to compare the position of\ndifferent persons or states of affairs (as in inequality analysis) or it can\nbe used to judge one course of action as \u2018better\u2019 than another course of\naction (as in policy design). For all these types of normative theories, we\nneed normative claims, since concepts alone cannot ground normativity.\nThe first normative claim which each capability theory should\nrespect is thus that functionings and capabilities form the \u2018evaluative\nspace\u2019. According to the capability approach, the ends of wellbeing\nfreedom, justice, and development should be conceptualized in terms\nof people\u2019s functionings and/or capabilities. This claim is not contested\n28 I am using the term \u2018normative\u2019 here in the way it is used by social scientists, hence\nencompassing what philosophers call both \u2018normative\u2019 and \u2018evaluative\u2019. For these\ndifferent uses of terminology, see section 2.2. It is also possible to use the notions\nof \u2018functionings\u2019 and \u2018capabilities\u2019 for non-normative purposes (see section 3.10). In\nthat case, the basic notions from the core are all that one takes from the capability\napproach; one does not need this normative part of the core. I will suggest in the\nconcluding chapter 5 that explanatory applications of the capability approach are\npart of how it could be fruitfully developed in the future. 52 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\namong scholars of the capability approach; for example, Sabina Alkire\n(2005, 122) described the capability approach as the proposition \u201cthat\nsocial arrangements should be evaluated according to the extent of\nfreedom people have to promote or achieve functionings they value\u201d.\nHowever, if we fully take into account that functionings can be positive\nbut also negative (see 2.6.2), we should also acknowledge that our lives\nare better if they contain fewer of the functionings that are negative,\nsuch as physical violence or stress. Alkire\u2019s proposition should therefore\nminimally be extended by adding \u201cand to promote the weakening of\nthose functionings that have a negative value\u201d.29\nHowever, what is relevant is not only which opportunities are\nopen to us individually, hence in a piecemeal way, but rather which\ncombinations or sets of potential functionings are open to us. For example,\nsuppose you are a low-skilled poor single parent who lives in a society\nwithout decent social provisions. Take the following functionings: (1)\nto hold a job, which will require you to spend many hours on working\nand commuting, but will generate the income needed to properly feed\nyourself and your family; (2) to care for your children at home and give\nthem all the attention, care and supervision they need. In a piecemeal\nanalysis, both (1) and (2) are opportunities open to that parent, but\nthey are not both together open to her. The point about the capability\napproach is precisely that it is comprehensive; we must ask which sets\nof capabilities are open to us, that is: can you simultaneously provide\nfor your family and properly care for and supervise your children? Or\nare you rather forced to make some hard, perhaps even tragic choices\nbetween two functionings which are both central and valuable?\nNote that while most types of capability analysis require\ninterpersonal comparisons, one could also use the capability approach\nto evaluate the wellbeing or wellbeing freedom of one person at one\npoint in time (e.g. evaluate her situation against a capability yardstick)\nor to evaluate the changes in her wellbeing or wellbeing freedom over\n29 Moreover, further extensions of this proposition may be needed. One issue is that\nwe should not only focus on capabilities that people value, but also on capabilities\nthat they do not, but should, value (see section 2.7.2). Another issue is that the\nevaluative space should not necessarily be restricted to capabilities only, but could\nalso be functionings, or a combination of functionings and capabilities (see section\n2.6.5). 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 53\ntime. The capability approach could thus also be used by a single person\nin her deliberate decision-making or evaluation processes, but these\nuses of the capability approach are much less prevalent in the scholarly\nliterature. Yet all these normative exercises share the property that they\nuse functionings and capabilities as the evaluative space \u2014 the space\nin which personal evaluations or interpersonal comparisons are made.\n2.6.6 A6: Other dimensions of ultimate value\nHowever, this brings us straight to another core property of module\nA, namely that functionings and/or capabilities are not necessarily the\nonly elements of ultimate value. Capabilitarian theories might endorse\nfunctionings and/or capabilities as their account of ultimate value but\nmay add other elements of ultimate value, such as procedural fairness.\nOther factors may also matter normatively, and in most capability\ntheories these other principles or objects of evaluation will play a role.\nThis implies that the capability approach is, in itself, incomplete as an\naccount of the good since it may have to be supplemented with other\nvalues or principles.30 Sen has been a strong defender of this claim,\nfor example, in his argument that capabilities capture the opportunity\naspect of freedom but not the process aspect of freedom, which is also\nimportant (e.g. Sen 2002a, 583\u2013622).31\nAt this point, it may be useful to reflect on a suggestion made by\nHenry Richardson (2015) to drop the use of the word \u2018intrinsic\u2019 when\ndescribing the value of functionings and capabilities \u2014 as is often\ndone in the capability literature. For non-philosophers, saying that\nsomething has \u2018intrinsic value\u2019 is a way to say that something is much\nmore important than something else, or it is used to say that we don\u2019t\nneed to investigate what the effects of this object are on another object.\nIf we think that something doesn\u2019t have intrinsic value, we would hold\nthat it is desirable if it expands functionings and capabilities; economic\n30 For example, if Henry Richardson (2007) is right in arguing that the idea of\ncapabilities cannot capture basic liberties, then one need not reject the capability\napproach, but instead could add an insistence on basic liberties to one\u2019s capability\ntheory, as Richardson (2007, 394) rightly points out.\n31 This distinction, and its relevance, will be discussed in more detail in section 3.3. 54 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\ngrowth is a prominent example in both the capability literature and in\nthe human development literature. Yet in philosophy, there is a long-\nstanding debate about what it means to say of something that it has\nintrinsic value, and it has increasingly been contested that it is helpful to\nspeak of \u2018intrinsic values\u2019 given what philosophers generally would like\nto say when they use that word (Kagan 1998; Rabinowicz and R\u00f8nnow-\nRasmussen 2000).\nIn philosophy, the term \u2018intrinsic\u2019 refers to a metaphysical claim;\nsomething we claim to be intrinsically valuable only derives its value\nfrom some internal properties. Yet in the capability approach, this is not\nreally what we want to say about functionings (or capabilities). Rather,\nas Richardson rightly argues, we should be thinking about what we\ntake to be worth seeking for its own sake. Richardson prefers to call\nthis \u2018thinking in terms of final ends\u2019; in addition, one could also use the\nterminology \u2018that which has ultimate value\u2019 (see also Rabinowicz and\nR\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen 2000, 48).32 This has the advantage that we do not\nneed to drop the widely used, and in my view very useful, distinction\nbetween instrumental value and ultimate value. Those things that have\nultimate value are the things we seek because they are an end (of policy\nmaking, decision making, evaluations); those things that do not have\nultimate value, hence that are not ends, will be valued to the extent that\nthey have instrumental value for those ends.\nOf course, non-philosophers may object and argue they are using\n\u2018intrinsic value\u2019 and \u2018ultimate value\u2019 as synonyms. But if we want to\ndevelop the capability approach in a way that draws on the insights\nfrom all disciplines, we should try to accommodate this insight from\nphilosophy into the interdisciplinary language of the capability\napproach, especially if there is a very easy-to-use alternative available\nto us. We can either, as Richardson proposes, speak of the selected\nfunctionings and capabilities as final ends, or we can say that the selected\nfunctionings and capabilities have ultimate value \u2014 that is, they have\nvalue as ends in themselves and not because they are useful for some\n32 \u201c[\u2026] the relevant values can be said to be \u2018end-point values\u2019, insofar as they are\nnot simply conducive to or necessary for something else that is of value. They are\n\u2018final\u2019, then, in this sense of being \u2018ultimate\u2019\u201d (Rabinowicz and R\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen\n2000, 48). 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 55\nfurther end. It is of course possible for a capability to have ultimate value\nand for the corresponding functioning to have instrumental value. For\nexample, being knowledgeable and educated can very plausibly be seen\nas of ultimate value, but is also of instrumental value for various other\ncapabilities, such as the capability of being healthy, being able to pursue\nprojects, being able to hold a job, and so forth.\nHowever, the question is whether it is possible to change the use of\na term that is so widespread in some disciplines yet regarded as wrong\nfrom the point of view of another discipline. It may be that the best\nwe can hope for is to become aware of the different usages of the term\n\u2018intrinsic value\u2019, which in the social sciences is used in a much looser\nway than in philosophy, and doesn\u2019t have the metaphysical implications\nthat philosophers attribute to it.\n2.6.7 A7: Value pluralism\nThere are at least two types of value pluralism within the capability\napproach. One type is the other objects of ultimate value, which was\nbriefly addressed in the previous section. This is what Sen called in\nhis Dewey lectures principle pluralism (Sen 1985c, 176). Expanding\ncapabilities and functionings is not all that matters; there are other\nmoral principles and goals with ultimate value that are also important\nwhen evaluating social states, or when deciding what we ought to do\n(whether as individuals or policy makers). Examples are deontic norms\nand principles that apply to the processes that lead to the expansion\nof capability sets. This value pluralism plays a very important role\nin understanding the need to have the C-module C4, which will be\ndiscussed in section 2.8.4.\nIt is interesting to note that at some stage in Sen\u2019s development of\nthe capability approach, his readers lost this principle-pluralism and\nthought that the capability approach could stand on its own. But a\nreading of Sen\u2019s earlier work on the capability approach shows that all\nalong, Sen felt that capabilities can and need to be supplemented with\nother principles and values. For example, in his 1982 article \u2018Rights and\nAgency\u2019, Sen argues that \u201cgoal rights, including capability rights, and\nother goals, can be combined with deontological values [\u2026], along with 56 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nother agent-relative considerations, in an integrated system\u201d (Sen 1982,\n4). Luckily, the more recent publications in the secondary literature\non the capability approach increasingly acknowledge this principle\npluralism; the modules A7 and C4 of the modular view presented in\nthis book suggest that it is no longer possible not to acknowledge this\npossibility.\nThe second type of value-pluralism relates to what is often called\nthe multidimensional nature of the capability approach. Functionings\nand capabilities are not \u2018values\u2019 in the sense of \u2018public values\u2019 (justice,\nefficiency, solidarity, ecological sustainability, etc.) but they are objects\nof ultimate value \u2014 things that we value as ends in themselves. Given\nsome very minimal assumptions about human nature, it is obvious that\nthese dimensions are multiple: human beings value the opportunity to\nbe in good health, to engage in social interactions, to have meaningful\nactivities, to be sheltered and safe, not be subjected to excessive levels of\nstress, and so forth. Of course, it is logically conceivable to say that for a\nparticular normative exercise, we only look at one dimension. But while\nit may be consistent and logical, it nevertheless makes no sense \u2014 for at\nleast two reasons.\nFirst, the very reason why the capability approach has been offered\nas an alternative to other normative approaches is to add informational\nriches \u2014 to show which dimensions have been left out of the other types of\nanalysis, and why adding them matters. It also makes many evaluations\nmuch more nuanced, allowing them to reflect the complexities of life\nas it is. For example, an African-American lawyer may be successful in\nher professional life in terms of her professional achievements and the\nmaterial rewards she receives for her work, but she may also encounter\ndisrespect and humiliation in a society that is sexist and racist. Being\nmaterially well-off doesn\u2019t mean that one is living a life with all the\ncapabilities to which one should be entitled in a just society. Only multi-\ndimensional metrics of evaluation can capture those ambiguities and\ninformational riches.\nSecond, without value pluralism, it would follow that the happiness\napproach is a special case of the capability approach \u2014 namely a\ncapability theory in which only one functioning matters, namely being\nhappy. Again, while this is strictly speaking a consistent and logical 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 57\npossibility, it makes no sense given that the capability approach was\nconceived to form an alternative to both the income metric and other\nresourcist approaches on the one hand, and the happiness approach\nand other mental metric approaches on the other. Thus, in order to make\nthe capability approach a genuine alternative to other approaches, we\nneed to acknowledge several functionings and capabilities, rather than\njust one.\n2.6.8 A8: The principle of each person as an end\nA final core property of each capability theory or application is that\neach person counts as a moral equal. Martha Nussbaum calls this\nprinciple \u201cthe principle of each person as an end\u201d. Throughout her\nwork she has offered strong arguments in defence of this principle\n(Nussbaum 2000, 56):\nThe account we strive for [i.e. the capability approach] should preserve\nliberties and opportunities for each and every person, taken one by one,\nrespecting each of them as an end, rather than simply as the agent or\nsupporter of the ends of others. [\u2026] We need only notice that there is a\ntype of focus on the individual person as such that requires no particular\nmetaphysical position, and no bias against love or care. It arises naturally\nfrom the recognition that each person has just one life to live, not more\nthan one. [\u2026] If we combine this observation with the thought [\u2026]\nthat each person is valuable and worthy of respect as an end, we must\nconclude that we should look not just to the total or the average, but to\nthe functioning of each and every person.\nNussbaum\u2019s principle of each person as an end is the same as what is also\nknown as ethical or normative individualism in debates in philosophy\nof science. Ethical individualism, or normative individualism, makes a\nclaim about who or what should count in our evaluative exercises and\ndecisions. It postulates that individual persons, and only individual\npersons are the units of ultimate moral concern. In other words, when\nevaluating different social arrangements, we are only interested in the\n(direct and indirect) effects of those arrangements on individuals.\nAs will be explained in more detail in section 4.6, the idea of ethical\nindividualism is often conflated with other notions of individualism, 58 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nsuch as the ontological idea that human beings are individuals who can\nlive and flourish independently of others. However, there is no such\nclaim in the principle of ethical individualism. The claim is rather one\nabout whose interests should count. And ethical individualism claims\nthat only the interests of persons should count. Ultimately, we care about\neach individual person. Ethical individualism forces us to make sure we\nask questions about how the interests of each and every person are served or\nprotected, rather than assuming that because, for example, all the other\nfamily members are doing fine, the daughter-in-law will be doing fine\ntoo. If, as all defensible moral theories do, we argue that every human\nbeing has equal moral worth, then we must attach value to the interests\nof each and every one of the affected persons. Thus, my first conclusion\nis that ethical individualism is a desirable property, since it is necessary\nto treat people as moral equals.\nBut ethical individualism is not only a desirable property, it is also an\nunavoidable property. By its very nature the evaluation of functionings\nand capabilities is an evaluation of the wellbeing and freedom to achieve\nwellbeing of individual persons. Functionings are \u2018beings\u2019 and \u2018doings\u2019:\nthese are dimensions of a human being, which is an embodied being,\nnot merely a mind or a soul. And with the exception of the conjoined\ntwins, and the case of the unborn child and the pregnant mother, bodies\nare physically separated from each other.33 We are born as a human\nbeing with a body and future of her own, and we will die as a human\nbeing with a body and a past life narrative that is unique. This human\nbeing, that lives her life in an embodied way, thus has functionings that\nare related to her person, which is embodied. It is with the functionings\nand capabilities of these persons that the capability approach is\nconcerned with.34 However, as I will explain in detail in section 4.6,\nfrom this it does not follow that the capability approach conceptualises\npeople in an atomistic fashion, and thus that the capability approach is\n\u2018individualistic\u2019 \u2014 meant in a negative, pejorative way. And it also does\nnot imply that a capabilitarian evaluation could not also evaluate the\n33 As Richardson (2016, 5) puts it, \u201call capabilities [\u2026] are dependent on the body.\nWithout relying on one\u2019s body there is nothing one can do or be\u201d.\n34 Some have argued in favour of what they call \u2018collective capabilities\u2019, which I will\ndiscuss in section 3.6. 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 59\nmeans (including social institutions, structures, and norms) as well as\nconversion factors, as well as non-capabilitarian elements of value \u2014 as\nlong as we are clear what the role or status of each of those elements is.35\nNote that the use of the term \u2018normative individualism\u2019 is deeply\ndisputed. Some scholars see no problem at all in using that term,\nsince they use it in a technical sense that they believe should not be\nconflated with any pejorative use of the term \u2018individualism\u2019 in daily\nlife. Other scholars resist the term \u2018ethical individualism\u2019, since they\ncannot separate it from (a) the notions of ontological and explanatory\nindividualism, and/or (b) from the pejorative meaning that the term\n\u2018individualism\u2019 has in daily life, which is probably close to a term such\nas \u2018egoism\u2019. While the first group is, in my view, right, the second group\nconveys important information about how the capability approach will\nbe perceived in a broader setting, including outside academia. It may\ntherefore be recommendable to replace the term \u2018ethical or normative\nindividualism\u2019 with the term \u2018the principle of each person as an end\u2019\nwhenever possible.\n2.7 The B-modules: non-optional modules with\noptional content\nI believe that the best way to understand the capability approach is\nby taking the content of the A-module as non-optional. All capability\ntheories need to endorse the content of the A-module (ideally in an\nexplicit way) or at a very minimum should not have properties that\nviolate the content of the A-module. But there are also properties of a\ncapability theory where the module is non-optional, yet there is choice\ninvolved in the content of the module. This doesn\u2019t mean that \u2018anything\ngoes\u2019 in terms of the choice of the content, but it does mean that within\neach module, there is a range of options to choose from. These are\nthe B-modules, each of which contains a range of possible content,\n35 However, the question remains whether the capability approach is fully compatible\nwith indigenous world views and normative frameworks, as well as thick forms\nof communitarianism. This is a question that doesn\u2019t allow for a straightforward\nanswer, and requires more analysis. For some first explorations of the compatibility\nof indigenous world views with the capability approach, see Binder and Binder\n(2016); Bockstael and Watene (2016); Watene (2016). 60 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nfrom which the capability theorist can decide what content to adopt.\nHowever, the range of content of the B-modules must not contradict the\nA-module. The following table lists the non-optional B-modules with\noptional content.\nTable 2.3 The B-modules: non-optional modules\nwith optional content\nB1: The purpose of the capability theory\nB2: The selection of dimensions\nB3: An account of human diversity\nB4: An account of agency\nB5: An account of structural constraints\nB6: The choice between functionings, capabilities, or both\nB7: Meta-theoretical commitments\n2.7.1 B1: The purpose of the capability theory\nThe first module, which is itself non-optional, but where the content\ncan be chosen, is the purpose of the theory. For example, one could\nuse the capability approach to construct a theory of justice, to develop\nan international empirical comparison, to reform an educational\ncurriculum, to develop alternative welfare economics, or to evaluate the\neffects of laws on people\u2019s capabilities. Questions of scope and reach\nalso need to be addressed in this module. For example, is a theory of\njustice a political or a comprehensive theory? Is such a theory domestic\nor global? Other questions that need to be addressed involve the\nintended audience. Is one constructing an academic theory where great\nattention is given to detail and even the smallest distinctions are taken\nas relevant, or is one addressing policy makers or societal organisations\nfor whom every detail does not matter and the time to think and read\nmay be much more constrained, while the accessibility of the ideas is\nmuch more important?\nOf course, one could argue that B1 is not specific to capability theories,\nand also holds for, say, deontological theories, or utilitarian theories,\nor theories that use care ethics as their basic normative foundation. 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 61\nWhile that is true, there are two reasons to highlight B1, the purpose of\nthe capability theory, in the account that I am developing. The first is\nthat it will help us to be explicit about the purpose. There are plenty of\npieces published in the capability literature in which the purpose of the\napplication or theory is not made explicit, and as a consequence it leads\nto people based in different disciplines or fields talking alongside each\nother. Second, it seems that the need to be explicit about the purpose\n(including the audience) of one\u2019s capability theory or application is\nstronger in the capability literature than in other approaches, because\nin comparison to those other approaches it has a much more radically\nmultidisciplinary uptake.\n2.7.2 B2: The selection of dimensions\nThe second B-module is the selection of capabilities and/or functionings.\nWe need to specify which capabilities matter for our particular capability\ntheory. This is a deeply normative question, and touches the core of\nthe difference that the capability approach can make. After all, the\ndimensions that one selects to analyse will determine what we will\nobserve \u2014 and also, equally importantly, what we will not observe\nsince the dimensions are not selected.\nThere is, by now, a large body of literature discussing the various\nways in which one can make that selection, including some overview\narticles that survey the different methods for particular purposes (e.g.\nAlkire 2002; Robeyns 2005a; Byskov forthcoming). These methods\nexplicitly include various participatory, deliberative and/or democratic\napproaches, which are widely used in capability applications.\nThere are two crucial factors determining which selection procedure\nis suitable. The first is the purpose of the capability theory (hence the\nchoice made in B1). If we develop an account of wellbeing for thinking\nabout how our lives are going, we are not constrained by questions such\nas the legitimate scope of government intervention, whereas a theory of\npolitical justice would need to take that element into account. Another\nexample is if we would like to use the capability approach to think about\nwhat is universally demanded by moral principles, hence to develop\nthe capability approach into a theory of morality: there the selection 62 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nmay be constrained by a method of moral justification for categorically\nbinding principles, which is much more demanding than a method\nthat justifies principles we offer to each other as rationally defensible\nproposals in the public realm. At the empirical and policy level, similar\nquestions arise. For example, one could take the international human\nrights treaties as reflecting a given political consensus, and use those to\nselect capabilities (Vizard 2007). Or, one\u2019s main goal may be to analyse\nwhat difference the capability approach makes for poverty or inequality\nanalysis in comparison with income metrics, in which case one may opt\nfor a method that makes the normativity explicit but nevertheless stays\nclose to existing practices in the social sciences, assuming the epistemic\nvalidity of those practices (Robeyns 2003).\nThe second factor determining which selection procedure is suitable\nis the set of constraints one takes as given in the normative analysis one is\nmaking. In an ideal world, there would always be cooperation between\nscholars with different disciplinary expertise, who would understand\neach other well, and who would be able to speak the language of the\nother disciplines involved in developing the capability theory. In an\nideal world, there would also be no time constraints on the amount of\ntime one has to develop a capability theory, and no financial constraints\non the data gathering, or social, psychological or political constraints\non the types of question one can ask when conducting a survey. One\nwould be able always to conduct one\u2019s own fieldwork if one wanted,\none would have access to all the empirical knowledge one needed, and\none would not be constrained in gathering the information one wanted\nto gather. Clearly, the methods for such an ideal world would be very\ndifferent from the methods that are used in practice \u2014 where database-\ndriven selection may be the best one can do.\nStill, whichever method one uses, what always remains important,\nand very much in the spirit of the capability approach, is not to act in a\nmechanical way, or to see the question of the selection of dimensions as\na technocratic exercise. Even if one cannot, for example, collect certain\ndata, one could nevertheless still mention the dimensions that one would\nhave wanted to include if it had been possible, and perhaps provide\nsome reasonable informed guess of what difference the inclusion of that\ndimension would have made. 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 63\n2.7.3 B3: Human diversity\nWithin the capability approach human diversity is a core characteristic,\nand indeed a core motivation for developing the capability approach\nin the first place. Yet the account of human diversity that one endorses\ncan differ. For example, scholars with a background in structuralist\nsociology or Marxism often believe that the social class to which one\nbelongs is a very important factor in human diversity, which has great\ninfluence on which options lie open to a person, but also on how a\nperson\u2019s character and aspirations are formed. For those scholars, class\ninteracts with, and in some cases even outweighs, all other identity\naspects. For others, such as libertarians, these differences are not so\nimportant.36 They would not attach much (normative or explanatory)\nimportance to one\u2019s gender, ethnicity, race, social class, and so forth:\neveryone is, first and foremost, an individual whose personal ambitions\nand projects matter. Yet, whether one is a Marxist or a libertarian or one\nof the many other positions one can take, one always, either implicitly\nor explicitly, endorses a view on human nature and on human diversity.\nThat choice should be made in capability theories, since the capability\napproach rejects the use of an implicit, unacknowledged account of\nhuman diversity. Hence such an account belongs to the B-modules: one\nhas to have an account of human diversity, but, as long as one is willing\nto defend one\u2019s account and it survives critical analysis, there are several\naccounts that one can opt for.\nNote that if one puts all the modules A, B and C together, a picture\nwill emerge about the great importance attached to human diversity in\nthe capability approach; this will be analysed in more detail in section 3.5.\n2.7.4 B4: Agency\nAnother B-module is the acknowledgement of agency. As a working\ndefinition, we can use Sen\u2019s definition of an agent as \u201csomeone who\nacts and brings about change, and whose achievements can be judged in\n36 For an introduction to libertarianism, see Vallentyne and Van der Vossen (2014). 64 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nterms of her own values and objectives, whether or not we assess them\nin terms of some external criteria as well\u201d (Sen 1999a, 19).\nApplications of the capability approach should endorse some account\nof agency, except if there are good reasons why agency should be taken\nto be absent, or why in a particular capability application agency is\nsimply not relevant (for example, when one wants to investigate the\ncorrelation between an income metric and some achieved functionings).\nBut clearly, as with other key ethical concepts such as \u2018wellbeing\u2019 or\n\u2018freedom\u2019, the concept of \u2018agency\u2019 can be fleshed out in many different\nways. The capability approach is not committed to one particular account\nof agency. Similar to the acknowledgement of structural constraints,\nthere is no agreed-upon or standard claim about how much agency, or\nwhat particular type, should be assumed; the claim is minimalistic in\nthe sense that, as with the structural constraints which will be discussed\nin the next section, agency cannot simply be ignored and must be\naccounted for. One can give agency a key role in a capability theory (e.g.\nCrocker 2008; Claassen 2016) or a more restricted role, perhaps also using\ndifferent terminology. One can also develop the account of agency by\nspelling out some of its preconditions, which may include capabilities.\nFor example, Tom de Herdt (2008) analysed the capability of not\nhaving to be subjected to public shame as a precondition of agency, and\nshowed how this may be relevant for social policymaking by illustrating\nits importance in a food relief programme in Kinshasa. For empirical\nscholars and policy scholars, an empirically sound account of agency\nwill be crucial; for moral philosophers, a more theoretical account of\nwhat conceptualisation of agency is morally relevant will be needed.\nThus, the precise content of this B-module will differ significantly\nbetween different capability theories and applications \u2014 but, in all\ncases, some acknowledgement of agency will be needed.37\n37 Martha Nussbaum explicitly refrains from integrating the notion of \u2018agency\u2019 in her\ncapability theory (Nussbaum 2000, 14). However, this does not mean that there isn\u2019t\nan account of agency in her theory, since the inclusion of the capability of practical\nreason on her list of central human capabilities can be understood as corresponding\nto one particular conceptualisation of agency. 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 65\n2.7.5 B5: Structural constraints\nThe fifth B-module is the account of structural constraints: the institutions,\npolicies, laws, social norms and so forth, that people in different social\npositions face. Those differences in the structural constraints that people\nface can have a great influence on their conversion factors, and hence\non their capability sets. For example, if relationships between people\nof the same sex are criminalised, then gay people may have all the\nmeans and resources they would wish, but they will still not be able to\nenjoy a happy family life. Or if people of colour face explicit or implicit\ndiscrimination on the labour market, then they will not be able to use\nthe same labour-market resources (their degrees, training, experience)\nto generate the same levels of capabilities in the professional sphere of\nlife, compared with groups that face no (or less) discrimination.\nIn addition, structural constraints also play a role in the shaping\nof people\u2019s capabilities that are not heavily dependent on material\nresources. If one group of people is, for cultural, historical or religious\nreasons, stigmatized as outcasts, then they will be treated with\ndisrespect by other groups in society. The same holds for all groups\nthat suffer from stigma, such as, for example, people with psychiatric\ndisorders or other mental health issues. These structural constraints will\nalso affect the capabilities that do not rely on resources directly, such as\nopportunities for friendships or for a healthy sense of self-confidence.\nWhich of those structural constraints will be important for a\nparticular capability analysis will depend on the context. For example,\nin her study of the living standards of waste pickers, scavengers, and\nplastic recycling and scrap trading entrepreneurs in Delhi, Kaveri Gill\n(2010) showed that caste plays a very important role in the capability\nsets of different castes. For example, those at the very bottom of the\nhierarchical ladder of waste workers \u2014 the waste pickers \u2014 have no\nopportunities for upward mobility due to social norms and societal\ndiscrimination related to their caste. In this study, social norms related\nto caste are key as a structural constraint; in other studies, it may be the\nanatomy of twenty-first century capitalism, or gender norms in gender-\nstratified societies, or some other set of structural constraints. 66 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nIn sum, structural constraints can have a very important role in\nshaping people\u2019s capability sets, and therefore have to be part of\ncapability theories. Structural constraints vary depending on one\u2019s\ncaste, class, ethnicity, age, gender, sexual orientation, (dis)abilities, and\nthe economic system in which one lives. These structural constraints\nare very likely to have an influence on a person\u2019s capability set (and in\nmost cases also do have that influence). Having an account of structural\nconstraints is therefore non-optional: every capability theory has one,\nalthough sometimes this account will be very implicit. For example, I\nwill argue in section 4.10 that part of the critique of mainstream welfare\neconomics is that it has a very weak or minimal account of structural\nconstraints. Heterodox welfare economists who are embracing the\ncapability approach are not only doing so because they think the\nendorsement of the capability account of wellbeing is better than the\npreferences-based accounts that are dominant in mainstream economics,\nbut often also because they hope that the minimal account of structural\nconstraints in welfare economics can be replaced by a richer account\nthat is better informed by insights from the other social sciences and\nfrom the humanities.\n2.7.6 B6: The choice between functionings,\ncapabilities, or both\nIn developing a capability theory, we need to decide whether we think\nthat what matters are capabilities, functionings, or a combination of\nboth. The core proposition that functionings and capabilities form\nthe evaluative space (A5), was not decisive regarding the question of\nwhether it is only functionings, or only capabilities, or a mixture of both,\nthat form this space.\nThere are various arguments given in the literature defending a\nrange of views that only capabilities matter; or that primarily secured\nfunctionings matter; or that for particular capability theories it is\nimpossible only to focus on capabilities; or that we sometimes have good\nreasons to focus on functionings. These various claims and arguments\nwill be reviewed in section 3.4; as will be argued in that section, there\nare good reasons why people could reasonably disagree on whether the\ncapability analysis they are conducting should focus on functionings or 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 67\ncapabilities or a mixture. It follows that a choice must be made, but that\nthere are various options to choose from.\n2.7.7 B7: Meta-theoretical commitments\nFinally, each capability theory will embrace some meta-theoretical\ncommitments. Yet often, these meta-theoretical commitments are\nshared commitments within one\u2019s discipline or one\u2019s school within\nthat discipline, and as a graduate student one has become socialised\nin accepting these meta-theoretical commitments as given. As a\nconsequence, it often happens that scholars are not even aware that\nthere are such things as meta-theoretical commitments. For example,\nif one wants to conduct a measurement exercise (a choice made in the\nmodule B1) then one may be committed to the methodological principle\nof parsimony (to build a model with as few assumptions and as elegantly\nas possible) or, instead, to providing a measurement that is embedded\ninto a rich narrative description aimed at a better understanding. Or,\nif one wants to construct a theory of justice (again, a choice made in\nthe module B1), then one may aim for an ideal or non-ideal theory\nof justice, or for a partial or a comprehensive account of justice. Or\none may espouse certain views about the status of theories of justice\nor meta-ethical claims related to, for example, the role that intuitions\nare permitted to play as a source of normativity. Some debates within\nthe capability approach, but also between capability scholars and\nthose working in other paradigms, would be truly enlightened if we\nmade the meta-theoretical commitments of our theories, accounts and\napplications more explicit.\n2.8 The C-modules: contingent modules\nIn addition to the compulsory content of the core A-module, and the\noptional content of the non-optional B-modules, a capability theory\ncould also add a third type of module, which I will call the contingent\nmodules. These are either modules that need to be taken on board due\nto some choices that have been made in a B-module, or else they are\nentirely optional, independent of what one has chosen in the B-modules.\nThe following table gives an overview of the contingent modules. 68 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nTable 2.4 The C-modules: contingent modules\nC1: Additional ontological and explanatory theories\nC2: Weighing dimensions\nC3: Methods for empirical analysis\nC4: Additional normative principles and concerns\n2.8.1 C1: Additional ontological and explanatory theories\nTwo capabilitarian thinkers could each aspire to make a theory of justice,\nyet embrace very different views on human nature and on the degree to\nwhich certain outcomes can be explained solely by people\u2019s choices or\nare also affected by structural constraints. This can matter a lot for the\nparticular capability theories that one develops.\nFor example, in earlier work, I showed that the capability approach\u2019s\nanswer to whether there is anything wrong with the traditional gender\ndivision of labour depends a lot on the social ontological claims related to\ngender that are (implicitly) endorsed as well as the explanatory views of\nhow that division of labour came about (Robeyns 2008c). If one believes\nthat the fact that women end up doing most of the unpaid and care\nwork, while men end up doing most of the paid labour market work, is\na result of differences in talents, dispositions and preferences, then one\nwould judge that the different functionings outcomes that result for men\nand women within households provide them with maximal levels of\nwellbeing given the formal institutional background that they face. But\nif one endorses a feminist explanation of this division of labour between\nmen and women within households, then one is likely to stress power\ndifferences, the role of societal expectations and social norms in decision\nmaking, and so forth (e.g. Okin 1989; Folbre 1994). The same observed\nfunctionings outcomes in households with a traditional gender division\nof labour would then be evaluated differently.\nSimilarly, Miriam Teschl and Laurent Derobert argue that a range of\ndifferent accounts of social and personal identity are possible, and this\nmay also impact on how we interpret a person forfeiting a capability that\nwe would all deem valuable (Teschl and Derobert 2008). If we believe that 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 69\nour religious identities are a matter of rational deliberation and decision-\nmaking, then we will judge the choice to physically self-harm because of\none\u2019s religion differently than if we have an account of identity where\nthere is much less scope for choice and rational deliberation regarding\nour religious affiliation or other group memberships.\nIn short, different ontological and explanatory options are available\nin module C1, and they may have effects on various other elements or\ndimensions of the capability theory that are being constructed. However,\nwe should be careful and not mistakenly conclude that \u2018anything goes\u2019\nwhen we add additional ontological theories, since there should not be\nany conflicts with the propositions of the A-module \u2014 and, in addition,\nsome ontological and explanatory accounts are much better supported\nby critical analysis and empirical knowledge.\n2.8.2 C2: Weighing dimensions\nFor some capability theories, the prioritising, weighing or aggregating\nof dimensions (functionings and capabilities) may not be needed. For\nexample, one may simply want to describe how a country has developed\nover time in terms of a number of important functionings, as a way of\ngiving information about the evolution of the quality of life that may\ngive different insights than the evolution of GDP (e.g. Van Zanden\net al. 2014). Weighing dimensions is therefore not required for each\ncapability theory or capability application, in contrast to the selection of\ndimensions, which is inevitable.\nHowever, for some other choices that one can make in B1, the\ncapabilitarian scholar or practitioner needs to make choices related to\nthe weighing of the different dimensions. If that is the case, then there are\ndifferent methods for how one could weigh. When considering which\nweighing method to use, the same factors are relevant as in the case of\nselecting the dimensions: the purposes of one\u2019s capability theory, and\nthe constraints one has to take into account when choosing a method.\nIn contrast to the overview works that have been written on how to\nselect dimensions (e.g. Alkire 2002; Robeyns 2005a; Byskov forthcoming),\ncapability scholars have written much less about which methods one\ncould use to decide on the weights given to each dimension, specifically 70 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nfocussing on functionings or capabilities as the dimensions. What\nlessons and insights can we learn from what has so far been argued in\nthis literature on the weighing of dimensions? (Alkire 2016; Alkire et al.\n2015, chapter 6; Robeyns 2006b, 356\u201358)\nFirst, the selection of weights for the capability approach is structurally\nsimilar to other multidimensional metrics (in the case of evaluations)\nor decision-making procedures (in case one needs to decide to which\ncapabilities to give priority in policies or collective decision making).\nHence one should consult existing discussions in other debates where\nmultidimensionality plays an important role. Let us first look at the\ngroup of applications in which the capability approach is used to make\ndecisions about what we, collectively, ought to do. That may be in an\norganisation; or at the level of a community that needs to decide whether\nto spend tax revenues on investing more in public green spaces, or in\nsocial services for particular groups, or in taking measures to prevent\ncrime, or in anything else that can likely be understood as leading to\npositive effects on our capabilities. In those cases, we can learn from\nsocial choice theory, and from theories of democratic decision making,\nhow we could proceed.38 Decisions could be made by voting, or by\ndeliberation, or by deliberation and/or voting among those who are the\nrepresentatives of the relevant population.\nSecond, the applications of the capability approach that involve a\nmultidimensional metric of wellbeing or wellbeing freedom could\nuse (most of) the weighing methods that have been discussed for\nmultidimensional metrics in general. Koen Decancq and Mar\u00eda Ana\nLugo (2013) have reviewed eight different approaches to set weights\nfor multidimensional metrics, which they categorize in three classes:\ndata-driven weights in which the weights are a function of the\ndistribution of the various dimensions in the population surveyed;\nnormative approaches in which either experts decide on the weights,\nor the weights are equal or arbitrary; and hybrid weights that are in\n38 In the case of democratic theory, the discussion is often about which laws to\nimplement, but the same insights apply to policy making. Both the literature on\ndemocratic theory (e.g. Dryzek 2000; Gutmann and Thompson 2004) and social\nchoice theory (e.g. Arrow, Sen and Suzumura 2002, 2010; Sen 1999c, 2017; Gaertner\n2009) are vast and will not be further discussed here. 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 71\npart data-driven but in addition depend on some normative decision.\nNote that in the data-driven and hybrid approaches, the selection of\ndimensions and the weights tends to be done through a process in\nwhich the selection of dimensions and the determination of the weights\ngo hand in hand. One example is the proposal by Erik Schokkaert\n(2007) of using happiness as the master-value by which we weigh the\nvarious capabilities that together form the multidimensional account of\nwellbeing. In this proposal, if the functionings do not contribute to one\u2019s\nhappiness, they are given a zero weight and hence no longer count in\nthe wellbeing index. In methods such as this one, there are two rounds\nof the selections of the dimensions: the first before one collects the data,\nand the second when one uses econometric techniques to determine\nthe contribution that the various functionings make to the master-value\n(here: life-satisfaction) and uses those as weights; those functionings\nthat will make no contribution will receive a weight of zero, which is\nthe same as being deleted as a dimension in the wellbeing index.\nThird, for non-empirical applications, we can categorize methods\nto determine weights in the same way as we could categorise methods\nfor the selection of dimensions. Morten Fibieger Byskov (forthcoming)\ndistinguishes between ad-hoc methods (such as the data-driven methods\ndiscussed by Decancq and Lugo), procedural methods, or foundational\nmethods. A theoretical capability application could include answers to\nall B-modules (including the selection of dimensions) yet decide that\nthe weighing of those dimensions should be done in a procedural way,\ne.g. via a democratic decision-making process. Alternatively, one could\nintroduce one master-value that will determine which capabilities are\nrelevant, and also what weights they should be given. One example is\nthe empirical work done by Erik Schokkaert (2007), which was discussed\nabove. Another example, which is theoretical, is Rutger Claassen\u2019s\ncapabilitarian theory of justice, in which the selection and weighing\nof capabilities is done based on their contribution to that person\u2019s\n\u201cnavigational agency\u201d (Claassen 2016).\nNote that in the case in which one has essentially a monistic theory\nin which there is a master-value, one may doubt whether this doesn\u2019t\nviolate property A7 from the A-module. At first value, it seems that it\ndoes. But proponents of a monistic theory may respond that all theories 72 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nor measures ultimately must choose one principle or value that tells\nus something about the relative weight of the different dimensions. In\nNussbaum\u2019s work, they argue, there is also an implicit master-value,\nnamely human dignity. It seems to me that this issue is not sufficiently\nanalysed and the dispute not settled. One question one could raise\nis whether all master-values have the same function. It seems to be\ndifferent whether the capabilities constitute the dimensions of a good life\n(as in the case of flourishing), or whether they contribute to the master-\nvalue. For the time being, we should in any case flag this as an issue to\nwhich more attention should be paid in the further development of our\nunderstanding of the capability approach.\n2.8.3 C3: Methods for empirical analysis.\nIf in B1 one chooses an empirical study, one needs to know which\nmethods to use. This is the task of the module C3. For example, the study\ncould contain choices about which multivariate analysis tools to use or\nwhether certain existing data sets are capturing functionings, capabilities,\nor merely rough indicators. In C3, we also make methodological choices\nrelated to empirical analysis: does a particular capability issue require\nquantitative analysis, qualitative analysis, or a combination? In part, the\ncontours of the empirical analysis will be influenced by one\u2019s ambitions\nand goals: is one trying to measure functionings and/or capabilities\ndirectly, or is one measuring resources and conversion factors in order\nto infer the capability set?\nFor empirical capability applications, these are of course huge\nmethodological questions that need to be answered. These empirical\nmethods questions may be particularly challenging for the capability\napproach for two reasons. First, because it is a radically multidimensional\napproach, and multidimensional analysis is by its very nature more\ncomplicated than a one-dimensional analysis. Second, in many cases, the\nrelevant dimensions will include dimensions on which the collection of\ndata is difficult, or on which no data are available \u2014 such as the quality\nof our social networks, the degree to which we do not suffer from\nexcessive levels of stress, or our mental health. Nevertheless, as Alkire 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 73\n(2005, 129) rightly points out in her discussion on what is needed for\nthe empirical operationalisation of the capability approach, one has to\nadopt the best existing empirical research (and its methods) that exists,\nand either master those new techniques that have been developed in\nother fields, or else engage in collaborations. Hick and Burchardt (2016,\n88) raise the related point that there is a need for capability scholars\nto reach out and engage with related fields where similar themes and\nproblems are faced. Only after that route has been travelled can we\nknow the limits of empirical analyses of the capability approach.\n2.8.4 C4: Additional normative principles and concerns\nFinally, module C4 provides room for additional normative concerns or\nmoral principles that capability scholars aim to add to their capability\ntheory. For example, in a particular capability theory, a principle of\nnon-discrimination may play a role or, alternatively, one may want to\nwork out a capabilitarian theory that subscribes to the non-domination\nprinciple as it has been defended by Republican political theory (Pettit\n2001, 2009). Or, if one ascribes to a rich account of empowerment that\nstresses the relevance of \u2018power\u2019 and hence strongly incorporates\nrelational aspects (e.g. Drydyk 2013; Koggel 2013), then one may add\na principle related to enhancing people\u2019s empowerment, or prioritising\nthe empowerment of the worst-off, as an additional normative principle\nto be added in module C4. Again, there are several elements belonging\nto module C4 that could be added to a capability theory.\n2.9 The modular view of the\ncapability account: a summary\nIn the previous sections, we have looked at the different elements of\nthe modular account of the capability approach, consisting of the core\nA-module, the compulsory B-modules with optional content, and the\ncontingent C-modules. For an easily accessible overview, the different\nelements of the modular view of the capability approach are summarised\nin table 2.5. 74 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nTable 2.5 The modular view of the capability approach\nThe A-module: the non-optional core\nA1: Functionings and capabilities as core concepts\nA2: Functionings and capabilities are value-neutral categories\nA3: Conversion factors\nA4: The distinction between means and ends\nA5: Functionings and/or capabilities form the evaluative space\nA6: Other dimensions of ultimate value\nA7: Value pluralism\nA8: Valuing each person as an end\nThe B-modules: non-optional modules with optional content\nB1: The purpose of the capability theory\nB2: The selection of dimensions\nB3: An account of human diversity\nB4: An account of agency\nB5: An account of structural constraints\nB6: The choice between functionings, capabilities, or both\nB7: Meta-theoretical commitments\nThe C-modules: contingent modules\nC1: Additional ontological and explanatory theories\nC2: Weighing dimensions\nC3: Methods for empirical analysis\nC4: Additional normative principles and concerns\nWhat, exactly, is the status of this characterisation of the capability\napproach? Is this list of modules and the core properties exhaustive,\nand is this a proposal to change the current definitions on offer in the\nliterature?\nThe answers have been given throughout the sections so far, but\nnow that we have gone through the different modules and know their\ncontent, it is worthwhile to repeat and summarize this in a very explicit\nmanner. The modular view is an attempt at understanding the plurality\nof capability theories on offer in the literature, doing justice to this\nplurality, yet at the same time avoiding the idea that \u2018anything goes\u2019.\nBy distinguishing between three types of modules \u2014 the A-module, 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 75\nthe content of which one must adopt, the B-modules, which are non-\noptional but have optional content, and the C-modules, which are\ncontingent \u2014 we can get a better grasp of the peculiar nature of the\ncapability approach: not exactly a precise theory, but also not something\nthat can be anything one likes it to be. I hope that this way of looking at\nthe anatomy of the capability approach will help us to understand what\nthe approach is, but also provide more guidance to those who want to\nuse the general capability approach as a guiding theoretical framework\nto work on particular theoretical or empirical issues and problems.\nThe content of the A-module, the B-modules and C-modules is,\nas with everything in scholarship, a proposal that can be modified\nto accommodate new insights. If someone has convincing arguments\nwhy one element or module should be deleted, modified, or added,\nthen that should be done. Given what we know from the history of\nscholarship, it is rather unlikely that no further modifications will be\nproposed in the future.\n2.10 Hybrid theories\nIn the previous sections, we have seen which modules are core in a\ncapability theory, which ones need to be addressed but have optional\ncontent, and which ones may or may not be necessary to add to a\nparticular capability theory. One question that this modular view raises is\nwhat we should think of a theory or an application that uses the addition\nof normative principles that are in contradiction with a property of the\nA-module. For example, suppose one would want to add the normative\nprinciple that institutions and personal behaviour should honour the\ntraditions of one\u2019s local community. There may be aspects of those\ntraditions that are in tension with the principle of treating each person\nas an end, for example, because women are not given the same moral\nstatus in those traditions as men. What should we then say? Would such\na theory no longer be a capability theory, even if the bulk of the theory is\ntrying to think about the quality of life and desirable institutions in terms\nof the enhancement of functionings and capabilities?\nI propose that we introduce the notion of a hybrid theory \u2014 theories\nor applications that use the notions of \u2018functionings\u2019 and \u2018capabilities\u2019 76 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nyet do not endorse all propositions in the A-module. Let me stress that\ncategorizing these theories as \u2018hybrid\u2019 entails no value judgement,\nwhether positive or negative; rather, it is only a matter of clarifying the\npossibilities of having capability theories but in addition also hybrid\ntheories which use part of the A-module yet also insert elements from\nother ethical frameworks that go against some propositions in the\nA-module. Thus, appreciating the possibility of hybrid views enlarges\nthe diversity of theories that are possible.\nCan we give an example of such a hybrid theory? Perhaps surprisingly,\nan example may be Amartya Sen\u2019s theorising about justice. According to\nthe interpretation by Antoinette Baujard and Muriel Gilardone (2017),\nSen\u2019s (2006, 2009c) recent work on justice does not endorse functionings\nand/or capabilities as the metric of justice, but should rather be seen\nas a procedural or democratic account of justice, in which the idea of\nhaving functionings and capabilities as the evaluative space is merely\na suggestion, which should be put to the public who eventually, in a\nprocess of public reasoning, have to decide what justice is about. If that\ninterpretation is correct, then Sen is unwilling to commit to proposition\nA5 (\u2018functionings and capabilities form the evaluative space\u2019) when\ntheorising about justice, since that is something to be decided by a\nprocess of public reasoning.39 Clearly, when Sen theorises about justice,\nhe has certain meta-theoretical commitments (module B7) that make\nit inconsistent for him to endorse A5, namely the meta-theoretical\ncommitment that the nature of justice will be decided by a democratic\nprocess. Whether that is a plausible meta-theoretical position, has been\nsubject of debate in the capability literature (e.g. Claassen 2011; Byskov\n2017) but need not concern us here. The point that is relevant for us is\nthat Sen\u2019s theorizing about justice could be seen as a public reasoning-\ncapability theory of justice.\n39 Note that for other capability applications or capability theories, such as making quality\nof life assessment studies, Sen has no problem endorsing proposition A5. Moreover,\none could also ask whether regarding his earlier publications on justice it would be\nimplausible to interpret Sen\u2019s writings as an endorsement of A5. In my view (and\npace Baujard and Gilardone\u2019s interpretation), Sen has made several statements in\nearlier work that could be seen as an endorsement of all propositions of module A\nfor the case of theorizing about justice (e.g. Sen 1980, 1990a, 2000). 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 77\nOther potential candidates for hybrid theories are the theories that\nwe discussed in section 2.8.2, in which functionings and capabilities\nplay an important role, yet in the theory or measurement construction\nthose functionings and capabilities turn out not to be of ultimate value,\nbut rather to be instrumental for some further end that is normatively\nprior to the functionings and capabilities themselves. There is, in\nthose cases, a master-value that determines how important (if at all)\nthose capabilities are: capabilities that we could value, but which do\nnot contribute to the master-value, will then not be given any ultimate\nvalue. As we discussed there, it is unclear whether those theories that\nendorse a master-value violate module A7 (value pluralism) or not. If\nwe conclude they do, then the best way to understand these views is to\nregard them as hybrid theories too.\n2.11 The relevance and implications of the\nmodular view\nUnderstanding the capability approach as having a modular structure\nleads to a number of insights. Let me highlight three important ones:\ncountering the risk of inflation, whereby we have no criteria for deciding\nwhen a theory is or is not a capability theory; appreciating the diversity\nof capability theories that are possible; and getting a better sense of how\nSen\u2019s and Nussbaum\u2019s writings relate to each other.\nFirst, the modular view can help us to contain the risk of inflation: too\nmany things being labelled as belonging to the \u2018capability approach\u2019,\nwhereas they do not meet the essential characteristics of the A-module.\nThe modular view of the capability approach which I presented gives us\na description that includes all the work in the capability approach that\nshould legitimately be included. There are, of course, other descriptions\nof the capability approach available in the literature. Yet to my mind\nmost of these descriptions (including my own previous attempts at\ndescribing the approach) were insufficiently detailed and illuminating.\nIf a description is too vague, we run the risk of inflation.\nFor example, one could aim to work on multi-dimensional poverty\nanalysis and highlight the fact that we should be interested in the 78 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\ncombination of achievements that people are able to have. This would\npoint at two important insights in the capability approach \u2014 namely\nits multidimensional character, as well as focussing on opportunity\nsets rather than on outcomes. But if the opportunities one focusses on\nare not capabilities, but rather opportunities to access certain bundles\nof commodities, then it would be an unjustified inflation to call this a\ncapability application; rather, it would be another type of opportunity-\nbased multidimensional inequality measure.\nSecond, to understand that capability theories have a modular\nstructure is crucial in understanding the diversity of capability theories\nthat are possible. Let me try to illustrate this. Module C4 states that\nadditional normative principles may be part of a capability theory, and\nproperty A6 that functionings and capabilities are not necessarily all\nthat matters in a capability theory. From this it does not follow that all\ncapability scholars have to endorse each and every capability theory.\nSurely there will be capability theorists who will take issue with the\nnormative principles that are added in module C4 by other capability\ntheorists when they design their theory. That is perfectly fine, as long\nas both theorists recognise that (a) the capability approach entails the\npossibility to add such additional normative principles in module C4,\nand (b) the normative principles they have added in module C4 are not\nthereby required for each and every other capability theory.40\nTake the following example. One may defend a political theory of\ndisadvantage which states that no-one should live in poverty, no matter\nwhether people are partly causally responsible for having ended up in\nthat situation. Such a theory would endorse a principle (in module C4)\nthat there should be, at the level of outcomes (and hence not at the level of\nopportunities) institutionally enforced solidarity via redistribution. Let\nus call those who endorse this principle the S-theorists (S for solidarity).\nThis is a strong normative claim: many other normative political theories\n40 I believe that Martha Nussbaum makes a mistake when she argues that a\ncommitment to the normative principle of political liberalism is essential to the\ncapability approach, hence to each and every capability theory. For my arguments\nwhy this is a mistake, see Robeyns (2016b). Political liberalism is an additional\nnormative commitment that is not a property of the A-module, but rather a choice\nin module C4. 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 79\nrather defend that everyone should have a genuine opportunity to\nlive a decent life, but still attribute some responsibility to all persons\nfor realising that life. Let us call these theorists the O-theorists (O for\nopportunity). Both the S-theorists and the O-theorists can agree that\nwe should understand people\u2019s wellbeing in terms of functionings and\ncapabilities. The S-theorists and the O-theorists are both capabilitarians.\nThey have to acknowledge that the other group\u2019s theory is a capability\ntheory, without having to endorse the other theory. In other words, a\ncapability theorist can agree that the normative position or theory that\nsomeone else is defending is a capability theory, without having to\nendorse that specific theory. There is absolutely no inconsistency in this\nsituation.\nThirdly, the modular view of the capability approach endorses\nthe view that Martha Nussbaum\u2019s work on the capability approach\nshould be understood as a capability theory, that is, a theory in\nwhich specific choices are made regarding the modules. It is not, as\nNussbaum (2011) suggests in her Creating Capabilities, a version of\nthe capability approach structurally on a par with Sen\u2019s more general\ncapability approach. What Sen has tried to do in his work on the\ncapability approach, is to carve out the general capability approach, as\nwell as to give some more specific capability applications. Admittedly,\nSen\u2019s work on the capability approach (rather than his work on a\nvariety of capability applications) would have benefited from a more\nsystematic description of how he saw the anatomy of the capability\napproach. To my mind, that has been missing from his work, and that\nis what I have tried to develop here and in an earlier paper (Robeyns\n2016b). Yet everything put together, I agree with the understanding\nof Mozaffar Qizilbash, who concludes an analysis of the difference\nbetween Nussbaum\u2019s and Sen\u2019s work on the capability approach by\nsaying that \u201cOn this reading [\u2026] Nussbaum\u2019s capabilities approach\nemerges as one particular application or development of Sen\u2019s original\nformulation of the approach\u201d (Qizilbash 2013, 38).\nIt is a mistake to understand the capability literature as a field\nwith two major thinkers who have each proposed one version\nof the capability approach, which have then inspired the work by\nmany other scholars. Rather, there is only one capability approach 80 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nwhich is a generalisation of the work by Sen together with further\ndevelopments by many others. In addition, there are many dozens\ncapability theories \u2014 about justice, human rights, social choice theory,\nwelfare economics, poverty measurement, relational egalitarianism,\ncurriculum design, development project assessment, technological\ndesign, and so forth. Clearly, Nussbaum has been one of the most\nprolific and important contributors; she has pushed the boundaries of\ncapabilitarian theories and has rightly advanced the agenda to achieve\nmore clarity on the essential characteristics that any capability theory\nshould meet. However, she has offered us a more specific capability\ntheory, rather than another version of the approach, even if it is the\ncapability theory that is by far the most influential capability theory\namong philosophers. Establishing the anatomy of the capability\napproach and its relation to particular capability theories is very\nimportant, because it vastly expands the scope of the capability\napproach, and increases the potential types of capability applications\nand capabilitarian theories.\nIn sum, there is much pluralism within the capability approach.\nSomeone who considers herself a capabilitarian or capability thinker\ndoes not need to endorse all capability theories. In fact, it is impossible\nto endorse all capability theories, since different choices made in\nmodule C1 (ontological and explanatory theories that are endorsed)\nand module C4 (additional normative principles) can be in conflict with\neach other. It is presumably coherent to be a Marxist capabilitarian, and\nit is presumably also coherent to be a libertarian capabilitarian, but it is\nnot coherent to endorse the views taken by those two positions, since\nthey are incompatible.\n2.12 A visualisation of the core\nconceptual elements\nWe have now covered enough ground in understanding the core\nconcepts of the capability approach to construct a visualisation of\nthese concepts. Figure 2.1 below gives a graphical representation of the\ndifferent elements of the capability approach, and how they relate. Note 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 81\nthat the arrows do not indicate normative importance but rather indicate\nwhich parts of this conceptual system are determinants of, or have an\ninfluence on, other parts.\nLet us start our description where economists generally start (and\noften also end): with resources. In the capability approach, the term\n\u2018resources\u2019 is interpreted in a broader sense than the understanding\nof that term elsewhere in the social sciences. Economics and the\nquantitative empirical social sciences have traditionally focussed\non material resources only: either income and wealth, or else on\nthe consumption that these financial means (or unpaid production)\ngenerated. One important lesson learnt from feminist economics is that\nabout half of economic production happens outside the market and the\nformal economy, which is the reason why the box at the far left in Figure\n2.1 also includes resources created by non-market production (Folbre\n2008; Folbre and Bittman 2004).\nBoth the resources and the consumption could be conceptualised as\ncapability inputs: they are the means to the opportunities to be the person\none wants to be, and do what one has reason to value doing. The means\ndo not all have the same power to generate capabilities; this depends on\na person\u2019s conversion factors, as well as the structural constraints that\nshe faces. Those structural constraints can have a great influence on the\nconversion factors as well as on the capability sets directly.\nFrom this visualisation, we can also see the difference between the\nsocial conversion factors and the structural constraints. The structural\nconstraints affect a person\u2019s set of conversion factors, including the social\nconversion factors she faces. But recall that those conversion factors tell\nus something about the degree to which people can turn resources into\ncapabilities. Conversion factors are thus, conceptually and empirically,\nclosely related to the capability inputs \u2014 that is, the resources that are\nneeded to generate capabilities. Structural constraints affect conversion\nfactors, but can also affect a person\u2019s capability set without impacting on\nthe conversion of resources in capabilities. For example, if a certain set\nof social norms characterizes a group in society as not having the same\nmoral status as others, then this affects the capabilities of the members\nof that group directly, not merely in terms of what they can get out of 82 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\ntheir resources. A good example is gay people, a significant percentage\nof whom are not worse off in financial terms than straight people, but\nthey often cannot express their sexual orientation in public, at the risk of\nhumiliation, aggression, or even risking their jobs or their lives.\nAnother part of the visualisation to pay attention to is the choice\nthat people make given the capability set they have. These choices are\nalways constrained in some sense, and the question is which types of\nconstraints a particular capability theory will take into account. Also, the\nterm \u2018choice\u2019 is used here in a very thin (or, as philosophers say, \u2018weak\u2019)\nsense: it is not assumed that elaborate thinking and weighing is done\nbefore we decide which capabilities to use and realise into functionings.\nIn fact, we have ample evidence from psychology that there are many\nother factors that influence the decisions we make, including how\nhungry or tired we are, the people in our company, or the amount of\ntime we have to make a decision (Ariely 2010; Kahneman 2011). Most\ncapability theories will have an (implicit) theory of choice: they will\nhave views on the extent to which people\u2019s past history (which includes\nthe structural constraints they faced in their personal past) as well as\nsocietal processes, such as preference formation mechanisms, influence\nthe choices that we make from the opportunities that are available to us.\nThe last element of the visualisation is the level of satisfaction\nor dissatisfaction with one\u2019s functionings and capability levels each\nperson will have. Of course, this does not mean that we need to attribute\nethical significance to those levels of satisfaction; rather, the point in the\nvisualisation is that satisfaction with one\u2019s functionings and capability\nlevels is not the same thing as those capability sets and combination of\nfunctionings achievements themselves. For now, we will concentrate on\ndeepening our understanding of the capability approach itself, but in\nsection 3.8, we will engage in more depth with the question whether we\nshould look at functionings and capabilities, rather than satisfaction, or\nsome other mental metrics, such as happiness.\nTwo remarks are important. First, this is a stylized visualisation, and\nalso a simplification. It is meant to help us see the different elements\nof the capability approach and how they relate; it is not a fine-grained\nand exhaustive picture of all the elements that determine a person\u2019s\ncapability set. One important limitation is that this is not a dynamic\nvisualisation and that many arrows, indicating relationships between 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 83\nseiroeht\nytilibapac\n.dednapxe\nfo\nstpecnoc dna\ndetadpu\neroc\n,)b5002(\neht\nfo\nsnyeboR\nnoitasilausiv\nno\ndesaB\ndesilyts\n:ecruoS\nA\n1.2\nerugiF 84 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nvarious parts, are not present.41 In addition, the choices we make\nfrom our capability set at one point in time, will be determinants of\nour resources and our capability set in the future. Another important\nlimitation of this visualisation is that it gives us only the resources,\ncapabilities, functionings and satisfaction of one person, but, as was\nmentioned before, capability sets are interdependent; hence choices\nmade from one person\u2019s capability set will lead to changes in another\nperson\u2019s capability set.\n2.13 The narrow and broad uses\nof the capability approach\nWe have now reached the end of the discussion of the modular view\nof the capability approach. Yet before closing this chapter, let us pause\nto use this modular view to clarify something that has been noted by\nseveral capability scholars, namely that the capability approach has\nbeen used and can be used in narrower or more limited ways on the one\nhand, and broader or richer ways on the other (e.g. Alkire, Qizilbash\nand Comim 2008, 4\u20135; Crocker and Robeyns 2009; Qizilbash 2012).42 The\ndistinction has been slightly differently presented by different authors,\nbut the general gist of their analyses has been that the capability\napproach can either be seen as offering something limited, or else much\nmore ambitious and wide-reaching:\n[\u2026] several interpretations of the scope of the capability approach are\nused in the wider literature [\u2026]. These can be charted between two\npoles: one narrow and broad, with the broad subsuming the narrow.\n[\u2026] The narrow interpretation sees the approach primarily as identifying\n41 In reality, almost everything is related to almost everything else in one way or\nanother, but putting all those arrows on a visualisation would make it completely\nuninformative. After all, the task of scholarship is to abstract away from distracting\ndetails to see more clearly.\n42 Readers who have never come across that distinction between the narrow and\nbroad use of the capability approach may simply ignore this section and move on,\nsince the anatomy of the capability approach that has been presented in this book\ncovers the same terrain. In essence, this section is written for those who came across\nthis terminology in the literature, and wonder how it relates to what has been said\nso far in this book. 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 85\ncapability and functionings as the primary informational space for\ncertain exercises. The broad interpretation views the capability approach\nas providing a more extensive and demanding evaluative framework,\nfor example by introducing human rights or plural principles beyond\nthe expansion of capabilities \u2014 principles which embody other values\nof concerns such as equity, sustainability or responsibility. (Alkire,\nQizilbash and Comim 2008, 4\u20135)\nIn the narrow way, the capability approach tells us what information we\nshould look at if we are to judge how well someone\u2019s life is going or has\ngone; this kind of information is needed in any account of wellbeing or\nhuman development, or for any kind of interpersonal comparisons. Since\nthe capability approach contends that the relevant kind of information\nconcerns human functionings and capabilities, the approach provides\npart of what is needed for interpersonal comparisons of advantage.\nThe modular view presented in this chapter can help to make sense\nof this observation that there is both a narrower and a wider use of the\ncapability approach. In the narrow use of the capability approach, the\nfocus is often strictly on the evaluation of individual functioning levels\nor on both functionings and capabilities. If we look at the narrow use of\nthe capability approach through the lens of the modular understanding\nof the approach, we can see that the narrow view chooses interpersonal\ncomparisons as the purpose of the capability theory (module B1); and\nthat it will have to make a selection of dimensions (module B2) and make\na choice between functionings or capabilities (module B6); its choice for\nhuman diversity (module B3) will be reflected in the choices it makes in\nB2, but also in which groups (if any) it will compare. Its meta-theoretical\ncommitments (B7) are likely related to limiting research to those things\nthat can be measured. The narrow use of the capability approach will\nmost likely not have much to say about agency (B4) and structural\nconstraints (B5) but adopt the implicit theories of agency and structural\nconstraints that are used in the empirical literatures on interpersonal\ncomparisons. Finally, the narrower view must decide on how to weigh\nthe dimensions (module C2) and which methods for empirical analysis\n(module C3) to make.\nIn its broad uses, the capability approach not only evaluates the\nlives of individuals (as in the narrow use), but also includes other 86 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nconsiderations in its evaluations, which are \u2018borrowed\u2019 from other\napproaches or theories. For example, the broader use of the capability\napproach often pays attention to other normative considerations\nand other values than only wellbeing, such as efficiency, agency, or\nprocedural fairness.\nThe broad view would, in most cases, have a more ambitious purpose\nfor its use of the capability approach, such as societal evaluation or policy\ndesign. It would also have (either implicit or explicit) richer theories\nof human diversity, agency and structural constraints, and \u2014 most\nimportantly \u2014 add several additional ontological and explanatory\ntheories (module C1) and additional normative principles (module C4).\nThe narrow view does not include modules C1 and C4, and this can\nmake a huge difference to the kind of capability theory that emerges.\nAn example of the broad view is David Crocker\u2019s (2008) book on\ndevelopment ethics, in which he has extended the capability approach\nwith accounts of agency, democratic deliberation and participation\ninto a more detailed account of development ethics. Yet Crocker\nacknowledges that not all versions of the capability approach embrace\nagency so explicitly. The capability approach proper need not endorse\na strong account of agency, but there are several scholars who have\ndeveloped particular capability theories and applications in which\nagency plays a central role (e.g. Claassen and D\u00fcwell 2013; Claassen\n2016; Trommlerov\u00e1, Klasen and Le\u00dfmann 2015).\nWhy is this difference between the narrow and the broad uses of\nthe capability approach relevant and important? There are several\nimportant reasons. First, to assess a critique of the capability approach,\nwe need to know whether the critique addresses the capability approach\nin its narrow use, or rather a specific version of its broad use. Second, we\nneed to be clear that many of the additional normative commitments in\nthe broad use of the capability approach are not essential to the capability\napproach: rather, they are optional choices made in modules B and,\nespecially, module C1 (additional ontological and explanatory theories)\nand module C4 (additional normative principles and concerns). This\ninsight will also be important when we address the question, in section\n4.9, of whether we can simply talk about \u2018the capability approach\u2019 and\n\u2018the human development paradigm\u2019 as the same thing. 2. Core Ideas and the Framework 87\n2.14 Conclusion\nThe purpose of this chapter has been to give a comprehensive\nexplanation of the capability approach: what is it trying to do, what\nare the many ways in which it has been used, what are the properties\nthat all capability theories share, and what is the structure that we can\ndetect in the construction of capability theories and applications? In\norder to get a helicopter view, I have deliberately put aside a number\nof additional distinctions and details. They will be the focus of the next\nchapter, whereas critiques and areas of contestation and debate will be\ndiscussed in chapter 4.  3. Clarifications\n3.1 Introduction\nThis chapter aims to deepen our understanding of the capability\napproach, by analysing and clarifying a range of questions that a\nstudent of the capability approach may have. My aim has been to\ninclude the most frequently asked questions raised by students of\nthe capability approach, as well as a few cases which, in my view,\ncurrently lead to confusion in the literature. The questions and issues\nwhich are much more a matter of debate or contestation have been\ncollected in chapter 4. Admittedly, the distinction between questions\nthat require clarification on the one hand, and issues of debate on the\nother, is not a neat one. But that should not bother us: nothing much\nhangs on whether a topic is included in chapter 3 or rather in chapter\n4; what matters is that students of the capability approach are able to\nfind answers to the questions they have.\nIn this chapter, the following topics are clarified and analysed:\nHow do the terminologies used by Sen and Nussbaum differ, and\nwhich additional terminological refinements have been proposed in\nthe literature? (Section 3.2) Can \u2018capabilities\u2019 properly be described\nas freedom, and if so, which types of freedom are capabilities? And\nis it always a good idea to speak of capabilities in terms of freedom?\n(Section 3.3) Which considerations should play a role in making the\nrelevant choices in module B6 \u2014 the choice between functionings or\ncapabilities (or both) \u2014 for one\u2019s capability theory? (Section 3.4) How\nexactly does the capability approach account for human diversity, and\n\u00a9 2017 Ingrid Robeyns, CC BY 4.0 https://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0130.03 90 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nwhy is human diversity given so much importance in the capability\nliterature? (Section 3.5) What does the notion \u2018collective capability\u2019 refer\nto? (Section 3.6) Which notion of wellbeing does the capability approach\ngive us? (Section 3.7) How does the capability approach differ from the\nhappiness approach, and what are the reasons that capability scholars do\nnot adopt the happiness approach? (Section 3.8) To what extent \u2014 and\nhow \u2014 can the capability approach deal with adaptive preferences?\n(Section 3.9) Can a capability theory also be an explanatory theory, or is\nthat not possible? (Section 3.10) Can the capability approach be used to\nstudy all normative questions, or is it not a suitable framework for some\nnormative questions? (Section 3.11) The capability approach is often\npositioned as an alternative for resourcist theories \u2014 but what exactly\nis the role of resources in the capability approach? (Section 3.12) Finally,\nwe consider how the capability approach relates to two established\nliteratures: theories of justice and theories of human rights. Which\nchoices in module B and module C are needed in order to construct a\ncapability theory of justice? (Section 3.13) And how do capabilities and\nhuman rights relate to each other? (Section 3.14)\n3.2 Refining the notions of \u2018capability\u2019\nand \u2018functioning\u2019\nWhile at a very introductory level, the terms \u2018functionings\u2019 and\n\u2018capability\u2019 seem to be easy and straightforward, the terminology\nused in the literature is, alas, not always clear. There has been quite\nconsiderable confusion in the use of the terminology, although \u2014 if one\ntakes a meta-disciplinary helicopter view \u2014 it is possible to discern that\nparticular uses of certain terms are more dominant than others. The\nconfusion has several sources. First, Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum\nhave used the same terminology somewhat differently to each other,\nand since most capability scholars are more influenced either by Sen\nor by Nussbaum, its use in the wider literature is not standardised.\nMoreover, both Sen and Nussbaum have changed their use over time,\nwithout always making this explicit. Thirdly, there are differences in\nterminological choices that can be traced back to established differences\nin different disciplines, which are having their effect on the different\ndisciplinary streams in the capability literature. 3. Clarifications 91\nThere are at least four terminological issues that need to be noted:\n(1) \u2018capability\u2019 understood as a single opportunity versus \u2018capability\u2019\nunderstood as an opportunity set; (2) Nussbaum\u2019s more complex\nterminology; (3) the quite different meanings given in the literature\nto the term \u2018basic capabilities\u2019; and (4) additional refinements \u2014 both\nsome that have been proposed in the literature, as well as a proposal\nthat I will put on the table, namely to take the robustness of a capability\ninto account. Let\u2019s look at these four issues in turn.\n3.2.1 Capability as an opportunity versus\ncapability as an opportunity set\nLet us first look at Sen\u2019s original terminology. The major constituents\nof the capability approach are functionings and capabilities. Functionings\nare the \u2018beings and doings\u2019 of a person, whereas a person\u2019s capability\nis \u201cthe various combinations of functionings that a person can achieve.\nCapability is thus a set of combinations of functionings, reflecting the\nperson\u2019s freedom to lead one type of life or another\u201d (Sen 1992a, 40).\nAccording to Sen, a person has only one capability (or capability set),\nwhich consists of a combination of possible, reachable functionings.\nA person\u2019s functionings and her capability are closely related but\ndistinct, as the following quote illustrates:\nA functioning is an achievement, whereas a capability is the ability\nto achieve. Functionings are, in a sense, more directly related to\nliving conditions, since they are different aspects of living conditions.\nCapabilities, in contrast, are notions of freedom, in the positive sense:\nwhat real opportunities you have regarding the life you may lead. (Sen\n1987, 36)\nSen thus used the term \u2018a capability\u2019 for what we could also call \u2018a\ncapability set\u2019. The advantage of each person corresponds to one\ncapability (hence \u2018a person\u2019s overall freedom to do the things they want\nto do and be the person they want to be\u2019). In the original terminology,\neach person had one capability, and the use of the word \u2018capabilities\u2019\ntherefore had to refer to the capabilities of various persons.\nIn Sen\u2019s original terminology, a person\u2019s capability consisted of a\nrange of potential functionings, out of which a particular combination\nof functionings could be chosen. Functionings could therefore be either 92 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\npotential or achieved. This kind of language is most familiar to social\nchoice scholars and scholars in formal welfare economics, where the\nfocus of much of the analysis is on the opportunity set.\nHowever, many other scholars working on the capability paradigm,\nincluding Martha Nussbaum, have labelled these potential functionings\n\u2018capabilities\u2019, and only use the term \u2018functioning\u2019 for an outcome. In\nthat terminology, the capability set consists of a number of capabilities,\nin the same way as a person\u2019s overall freedom is made up of a number\nof more specific freedoms. One does not find this usage of \u2018capabilities\u2019\n(meaning the separate elements of one person\u2019s capability set) in Sen\u2019s\nearlier writings, and in his later writings he (perhaps reluctantly) uses\nthe word \u2018capability\u2019 in both senses interchangeably.\nWhat, then, is the terminology that is now predominantly used? As\nwas explained in chapter 2, a functioning is a state of one\u2019s being (such\nas being healthy or ill), or something one is doing (such as going on\na trip or raising children). The real opportunity to accomplish such a\nfunctioning, is the corresponding capability. Hence if my sister goes on\na trip and invites me along, but I decide to stay at home because I want\nto do something else, then I have the capability to go on a trip, but I\nchose not to have the corresponding outcome \u2014 the functioning. Each\nfunctioning corresponds exactly to one capability.\nThis plural use of capabilities is widespread in the contemporary\nliterature on the capability approach \u2014 with the exception of those\nworking in social choice theory, formal welfare economics and related\nfields. The terminology as used by the broader group of scholars\nworking on the capability approach seems to be more straightforward\nand less technical, but when reading Sen\u2019s (earlier) work it is important\nto know that the term \u2018capability\u2019 started with a different definition.1\n3.2.2 Nussbaum\u2019s terminology\nIn Women and Human Development, her first book-length work on her\ncapabilities theory, Martha Nussbaum used the following terminology,\nwhich she still uses in her recent book on the capability approach\n(Nussbaum 2011, 20\u201325). Human capabilities are \u201cwhat people are\n1 For a seminal analysis of the differences between Nussbaum\u2019s and Sen\u2019s conceptual\nand terminological apparatus, see the twin papers by David A. Crocker (1992, 1995). 3. Clarifications 93\nactually able to do and to be\u201d (Nussbaum 2000, 5). From those human\ncapabilities, Nussbaum identifies a list of ten \u201ccentral capabilities\u201d which\nhave the status of rights: they \u201cmay not be infringed upon to pursue\nother types of social advantage\u201d (Nussbaum 2000, 14). According to\nNussbaum\u2019s minimal account of social justice, these central capabilities\nhave to be protected up to a certain threshold level.\nNussbaum helpfully distinguishes between three further notions to\nunpack the concept of \u2018human capabilities\u2019: basic capabilities, internal\ncapabilities, and combined capabilities (Nussbaum 2000, 84\u201385). The\nterm basic capabilities refers to \u201cthe innate equipment of individuals that\nis necessary for developing the more advanced capabilities\u201d, such as\nthe capability of speech and language, which is present in a new-born\nbut needs to be fostered before it can develop into a true capability.\nInternal capabilities are \u201cthe matured conditions of readiness\u201d \u2014 the\ninternal aspect of the capability. If I have the skill and meet the physical\npreconditions of walking, then I may or may not be able to go for a\nwalk \u2014 depending, for example, on whether as a woman I am legally\nallowed to leave the house without a male relative, or whether there\nis not currently a hurricane posing a real danger if I were to leave my\nhouse. If those suitable external conditions are in place, we can speak of\ncombined capabilities.\nFinally, a functioning is an \u201cactive realisation of one or more\ncapabilities. [\u2026] Functionings are beings and doings that are the\noutgrowths or realizations of capabilities\u201d (Nussbaum 2011, 25). Hence,\nin Nussbaum\u2019s terminology, a functioning stands in relation to a\ncapability as an outcome stands in relation to an opportunity.\nWhile the substantive distinctions to which Nussbaum\u2019s terminology\nrefers are very helpful, the specific words chosen may be not ideal.\nThere are two problems. First, for many capability scholars, the\nreference to the term \u2018capability\u2019 refers to the real opportunity to do\nsomething or be the person one wants to be; \u2018internal capabilities\u2019 do\nnot fit that category. They are, starting from that perspective, simply\nnot a capability, but rather necessary elements of a capability, or a\nprecondition for a capability. It would have been better to call \u2018internal\ncapabilities\u2019 simply \u2018internal characteristics\u2019 or else \u2018skills, talents,\ncharacter traits and abilities\u2019. Such terminology would also make the\nlink with various other behavioural and social disciplines much easier. 94 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nWhat Nussbaum calls \u2018combined capabilities\u2019 could then simply be\ncalled \u2018human capabilities\u2019, which consist of the presence of those skills,\ntalents, character traits and abilities, together with suitable external\nconditions and circumstances. Second, Nussbaum uses the term \u2018basic\ncapability\u2019 after it had already been used in two other different ways,\nas the next section will show. Why not simply call these \u2018innate human\ncharacteristics\u2019?\n3.2.3 What are \u2018basic capabilities\u2019?\nThe way readers from different disciplines use terminology in particular\nways is clearly exemplified by the various interpretations of the term\n\u2018basic capabilities\u2019.\nOne interpretation is Nussbaum\u2019s. As was mentioned before,\nNussbaum (2000, 84) uses the term \u2018basic capabilities\u2019 to refer to \u201cthe\ninnate equipment of individuals that is necessary for developing the\nmore advanced capabilities\u201d, such as the capability of speech and\nlanguage, which is present in a new-born but needs to be fostered. Yet\nof the four ways in which the term \u2018basic capabilities\u2019 is used in the\nliterature, this one may be the least prevalent.\nSen (1980) mentioned the term \u2018basic capability\u2019 as his first rough\nattempt to answer the \u2018equality of what?\u2019 question, but changed his\nterminology in subsequent work (what he called \u2018basic capability\u2019\nwould later become \u2018capability\u2019).2 In his later writings, Sen reserved\nthe term \u2018basic capabilities\u2019 to refer to a threshold level for the relevant\ncapabilities. A basic capability is \u201cthe ability to satisfy certain elementary\nand crucially important functionings up to certain levels\u201d (Sen 1992a, 45\nfn 19). Basic capabilities refer to the freedom to do some basic things\nconsidered necessary for survival and to avoid or escape poverty or\nother serious deprivations. The relevance of basic capabilities is \u201cnot so\nmuch in ranking living standards, but in deciding on a cut-off point for\nthe purpose of assessing poverty and deprivation\u201d (Sen 1987, 109).\n2 The \u2018equality of what?\u2019 debate was prompted by Sen\u2019s Tanner lecture with the same\ntitle (Sen 1980a), in which he argued that almost any theory of distributive justice is\negalitarian, in the sense that they all advocate equality of something. The question\nto pose to a theory of distributive justice is therefore not whether it is egalitarian or\nnot, but what is its answer to the \u2018equality of what?\u2019 question. 3. Clarifications 95\nA third way in which the term \u2018basic capabilities\u2019 can be used is,\nas in analytical political philosophy, to refer to essential (moral and/\nor political) entitlements that signify a higher level of moral urgency,\naccording to the philosopher\u2019s own normative commitments. For\nexample, Rutger Claassen, who has been developing an agency-based\ncapability theory of justice, has been using the term \u2018basic\u2019 in that sense\n(Claassen 2016).\nA fourth way to use the term \u2018basic capability\u2019 has been proposed\nby Bernard Williams. Yet this has, to the best of my knowledge, not\nbeen taken up by anyone. Williams has argued that it is important to\ndistinguish between the capability to choose yet another new brand\nof washing powder from, say, Adam Smith\u2019s often-cited capability to\nappear in public without shame. Williams rightly notes that \u201cwhat you\nneed, in order to appear without shame in public, differs depending on\nwhere you are, but there is an invariant capability here, namely that of\nappearing in public without shame. This underlying capability is more\nbasic\u201d (Williams 1987, 101). I agree with the need for the distinction that\nWilliams makes, but I would rather call these underlying capabilities\nthe general capabilities, so as to avoid confusion with Sen\u2019s use of basic\ncapabilities. I will turn to the discussion of general versus specific\ncapabilities in section 3.2.4, but first I want to ask the question: how\nshould we interpret the term \u2018basic capability\u2019?\nMy reading is that, within the capability literature, the most\nwidespread (and hence dominant) use of \u2018basic capabilities\u2019 is Sen\u2019s\nuse, referring to poverty or deprivation. Hence, while the notion\nof capabilities refers to a very broad range of opportunities, \u2018basic\ncapabilities\u2019 refers to the real opportunity to avoid poverty or to meet\nor exceed a threshold of wellbeing. By focusing on \u2018basic\u2019 capabilities,\nwe are limiting the set of all capabilities in two ways: first, by having a\nselection of capabilities (i.e. those that are key to capturing wellbeing,\nand those that are centrally important), and second, by imposing a\nthreshold at which those capabilities will be evaluated (i.e. at a low or\npoverty-like level).\nBasic capabilities are thus crucial for poverty analysis and in general\nfor studying the wellbeing of large sections of the population in poor\ncountries, or for theories of justice that endorse sufficiency as their\ndistributive rule. In affluent countries, by contrast, wellbeing analysis 96 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\noften focuses on capabilities that are less necessary both for survival\nand the avoidance of poverty. It is important to acknowledge that\nthe capability approach is not restricted to poverty and deprivation\nanalysis but can also serve as a framework for, say, project or policy\nevaluations or inequality measurement in non-poor communities. Sen\u2019s\nand Nussbaum\u2019s extensive writings on the capability approach in the\ncontext of poverty alleviation and development questions have misled\nsome of their readers into thinking that the capability approach is about\npoverty and development issues only. Yet as has been absolutely clear\nfrom the description and account of the capability approach presented\nin chapters 1 and 2, there is conceptually or normatively no reason to\nrestrict its scope in this way. The term \u2018basic capabilities\u2019 is helpful since\nit can signal to the reader when the capability approach is specifically\nused in this context.\n3.2.4 Conceptual and terminological refinements\nOver the years, several proposals have been made to refine the notions\nof \u2018functioning\u2019 and \u2018capability\u2019, or to add additional qualifications\nwhich may be helpful in capability analyses.\nThe first refinement \u2014 which is straightforward but still very\nhelpful \u2014 is the distinction between general and specific functionings and\ncapabilities (Alkire 2002, 31). Suppose we are concerned with questions\nabout what is needed for people not to be socially excluded. Sen has\nrepeatedly referred to Adam Smith\u2019s example that, in order to be able to\nappear in public without shame, one needed (in the time and place Smith\nlived) a linen shirt. Yet in other countries one would need a sari, or a suit,\nor something else. We all know that in every specific time and place,\nthere are certain types of clothes one shouldn\u2019t wear if one doesn\u2019t want\nto be frowned upon or be seen as inappropriately dressed. We could\nsay that, for women in place A, being able to wear a sari is important,\nand for men in another place, being able to wear a suit is important, in\norder not to be excluded. \u2018Being able to wear a sari\u2019 and \u2018being able to\nwear a suit\u2019 are specific capabilities; \u2018being able to wear the clothes that\nare considered appropriate\u2019 is the more general capability. Thus, if we\nformulate the relevant capabilities at a higher level of generality, it will\nbe easier to reach agreement on what those are, than if we focus on more 3. Clarifications 97\nspecific capabilities (Sen 1992a, 108\u201309). General capabilities are thus\nthe more generic and more abstract capabilities. The idea of general\nversus more specific functionings and capabilities is also entailed by\nNussbaum\u2019s idea of the multiple realisability of capabilities that are under\nscrutiny: the selected capabilities \u201ccan be more concretely specified in\naccordance with local beliefs and circumstances\u201d (Nussbaum 2000, 77).\nA second conceptual refinement to consider is the concept of \u2018refined\nfunctioning\u2019. Sen (1987, 36\u201337) has proposed the concept of \u2018refined\nfunctioning\u2019 to designate functioning that takes note of the available\nalternatives. Sen (1992a, 52) notes: \u201c\u2018fasting\u2019 as a functioning is not just\nstarving; it is choosing to starve when one does have other options\u201d. The aim\nof this proposal is to try to bridge the choice between functionings and\ncapabilities by a conceptual move. That is, one could focus on achieved\nfunctionings levels but \u2014 where appropriate \u2014 include the exercise of\nchoice as one of the relevant functionings (Fleurbaey 2002). This allows\nus to stay within the realm of (observable) achievements, but because\nthe act of choosing is included, one can derive from that functioning\nrelevant information about whether one had options or not.\nA third conceptual refinement \u2014 this time a qualification or property\nthat we can attribute to a functioning or a capability \u2014 has been proposed\nby Avner De-Shalit and Jonathan Wolff. They have argued that what is\nrelevant for the most disadvantaged persons is not so much whether\nthey have any functionings, but rather whether those functionings are\nsecure (Wolff and De-Shalit 2007, 2013). The idea here is that we are\nnot only interested in the functionings that people can achieve, but also\nin the prospects that a person has to sustain that level \u2014 that is, the\nrisk and vulnerability of losing that functionings achievement should\nbe taken into account, even if the risk never materialises. The objective\nfact of risk and vulnerability itself should be seen as having an influence\non how we normatively judge a functionings achievement (Wolff and\nDe-Shalit 2007, 63\u201373).\nAnother qualification that we could add to capabilities is their\nrobustness \u2014 referring to the probability of a capability being realisable.\nThe standard definition of a capability is that it is a genuine option: if we\nhave the capability and we choose this opportunity, then we should also\nenjoy the outcome \u2014 the functioning. But this presents us with a very\ndichotomous view of our options: either we have an option with a 100% 98 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nprobability, or else, if the probability is significantly less, it is implied\nthat we do not have the capability. That is, arguably, a rather unhelpful\nway of thinking about real life processes. For example, the problem\nwith women\u2019s opportunities in advanced economies is definitely not\nthat women have no capabilities to achieve professional success; rather,\nthe problem is that, given a variety of mechanisms that are biased\nagainst female professionals, the robustness of the capabilities they are\ngiven is weaker. If an equally talented man and woman both want to\nsucceed professionally, they may, in a liberal society, both have that\ncapability \u2014 but the probability that the man will be able to succeed will\nbe higher than the woman\u2019s. She does have some opportunity, but that\nopportunity is less robust. Probabilities of success if one were to want\nto exercise that capability would be a way to express this. In the above\ngender case, the source of the different probabilities lies in the social and\nenvironmental conversion factors. But the source of the difference in\nrobustness could also lie in internal factors. For example, a person with\na psychiatric condition may have some opportunities for finding a job,\nbut those opportunities may be much more precarious then they would\nbe if she didn\u2019t have those psychiatric challenges.\n3.3 Are capabilities freedoms,\nand if so, which ones?\nAmartya Sen (1990c, 460) has described capabilities as\nthe freedom[s] to achieve valuable human functionings, which can vary\nfrom such elementary things as being well-nourished and avoiding\nescapable morbidity and mortality, to such complex achievements\nas having self-respect, being well-integrated in society, and so on.\nCapabilities thus reflect the actual freedoms that people respectively\nenjoy in being able to lead the kind of lives they have reason to value.\nBut several philosophers and social scientists have questioned the\nunderstanding (or, for philosophers: \u2018conceptualisation\u2019) of capabilities\nin terms of freedoms, asking whether capabilities could plausibly be\nunderstood as freedoms, whether Sen was not overextending the use\nof freedom, whether freedom is all there is to the capability approach,\nand whether it is wise to use the terminology of freedom for the goals 3. Clarifications 99\nof the capability approach (e.g. Cohen 1993; Gasper and Van Staveren\n2003; Hill 2003; Okin 2003, 291\u201392). Let us therefore clarify and analyse\nthe conceptualisation of capabilities as freedom by answering three\nquestions. First, capabilities have been described as positive freedoms,\nbut how should we understand that notion, and is that the best way to\ndescribe what kind of freedoms capabilities are? (Section 3.3.1) Secondly,\nis there a better conceptualisation of freedom that captures what\ncapabilities are? (Section 3.3.2) Thirdly, if it is the case that capabilities\ncan coherently be conceptualised as freedoms, are capabilities then\nbest understood as freedoms, or is it better to avoid that terminology?\n(Section 3.3.3).\n3.3.1 Capabilities as positive freedoms?\nSen has often used the distinction between positive and negative\nfreedoms, thereby describing capabilities as positive freedoms. For\nexample, Sen (1984b, 315) has stated that he is trying \u201cto outline a\ncharacterization of positive freedoms in the form of capabilities of\npersons\u201d.3 In some discourses, especially in the social sciences, the term\n\u2018positive freedoms\u2019 is used to refer to access to certain valuable goods,\nsuch as the freedom to affordable high quality health care or education.\nPositive freedoms are contrasted with negative freedoms, which refer\nto the absence of interference by others, such as the freedom to own a\ngun.4 Yet these are by no means standard understandings of positive\nand negative freedom.\nIn making the claim that capabilities are positive freedoms, Sen\noften approvingly refers to Isaiah Berlin\u2019s canonical distinction between\npositive and negative freedom, but unfortunately doesn\u2019t explain in\ndetail how we should read Berlin. This is potentially confusing, since\nBerlin\u2019s use of the term \u2018positive freedom\u2019 is far from crystal clear.\n3 Other statements equating capabilities with positive freedoms can be found in\nSen (1982, 6, 38\u201339; 1984c, 78, 86; 1985c, 201; 2008, 18 among other places). In his\n1979 Tanner lecture in which Sen coined the term \u2018capability\u2019, he did not refer to\nfreedoms, but did use other terms such as \u2018ability\u2019 and \u2018power\u2019.\n4 According to Sen (2009c, 282) this is the understanding of positive and negative\nfreedom in welfare economics. 100 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nLet us start from the clearest concept in Berlin \u2014 his notion of\nnegative freedom \u2014 which Berlin (1969, 122) defines as follows: \u201cI am\nnormally said to be free to the degree to which no man or body of men\ninterferes with my activity\u201d. The opposite of having negative freedom is\nbeing coerced \u2014 the deliberate interference of other persons in an area\nof my life in which I could, without the interference, act freely. Negative\nfreedom thus corresponds to freedom as non-interference, and Berlin\nspeaks approvingly of this kind of freedom: \u201c[\u2026] non-interference,\nwhich is the opposite of coercion, is good as such, although it is not\nthe only good. This is the \u2018negative\u2019 conception of liberty in its classical\nform\u201d (1969, 128).\nOn positive freedom, there is much less clarity in Berlin\u2019s work.\nBerlin first introduces positive freedom as the freedom to be one\u2019s own\nmaster:\nI wish to be the instrument of my own, not of other men\u2019s, acts of will. I\nwish to be a subject, not an object; to be moved by reasons, by conscious\npurposes, which are my own, not by causes which affect me, as it were,\nfrom outside. I wish to be a somebody, not nobody, a doer \u2014 deciding,\nnot being decided for; self-directed and not acted upon by external nature\nor by other men as if I were a thing, or an animal, or a slave incapable of\nplaying a human role, that is, conceiving goals and policies of my own\nand realizing them. (Berlin 1969, 131)\nBerlin argues that the metaphor of self-mastery historically developed\ninto the idea that a person has two selves, a dominant self which is\nidentified with reason and a \u2018higher nature\u2019, and a \u2018heteronomous self\u2019\nwhich follows desires and passions and needs to be disciplined. Berlin\ncontinues that the first self, the \u2018real self\u2019, may become seen as wider\nthan the individual,\nas a social whole of which the individual is an element or aspect: a tribe, a\nrace, a church, a state, the great society of the living and the dead and the\nyet unborn. This entity is then identified as being the \u2018true\u2019 self which,\nby imposing its collective, or \u2018organic\u2019 single will upon its recalcitrant\n\u2018members\u2019 achieves its own, and therefore their \u2018higher freedom\u2019. (Berlin\n1969, 132)\nPut differently, men are \u201ccoerced in the name of some goal (let us\nsay, justice or public health) which they would if they were more\nenlightened, themselves pursue, but do not, because they are blind or 3. Clarifications 101\nignorant or corrupt\u201d (132\u2013133). Berlin acknowledges that one could, in\nprinciple, develop the same justification of tyranny starting from the\ndefinition of negative freedom, but continues to argue that this is easier\nwith the positive conception of freedom. The reason is that the idea of\npositive freedom as self-mastery entails a distinction between my \u2018true\u2019\nself and an \u2018untrue self\u2019. It is therefore possible that someone else other\nthan you knows better what your true self is, which opens up a space\nfor another person to coerce you in the name of your \u2018true self\u2019. Berlin\nbelieves that this has historically been the case with tyrannical regimes\nthat propagated an ideology entailing a notion of positive freedom as\nself-mastery, whereby everything can be justified in the name of some\ntrue or higher self that needs to master other impulses and desires.\nIt is not difficult to see that positive freedom in Berlin\u2019s sense is not\nthe kind of freedom that capabilities represent, especially not when\nunderstood against the historically tyrannical shape that this ideal\n(according to Berlin) took. Capabilities are not about people\u2019s internal\nattitudes towards what they should do with their lives. At the political\nlevel, the capability approach would advocate that we should organise\nour political life in such a way as to expand people\u2019s capabilities,\nwhereby the capability approach will judge that two persons had the\nsame initial equal freedom if both of them had the same initial set of\nvaluable options from which to choose. The capability approach,\ntherefore, is not strongly perfectionist and teleological, as is the positive\nfreedom doctrine in Berlin\u2019s sense. In sum, capabilities are very different\nfrom Berlin\u2019s notion of positive freedom, and Berlin\u2019s understanding of\npositive freedom is not the best way to capture the kinds of freedom that\ncapabilities are.\nIn later work, Sen acknowledged the potential for confusion that\nhis equation of capabilities with positive freedom and his references to\nBerlin\u2019s work had made, and provided a clearer description of his own\nunderstanding of positive freedom. In his Arrow lectures, Sen (2002a,\n586) wrote:\npositive freedom has also been variously defined, varying on one side\nfrom the general freedom to achieve in general, to the particular aspect,\non the other side, of freedom to achieve insofar as it relates to influences\nworking within oneself (a use that is close to Berlin\u2019s conceptualization of\npositive freedom). In my own attempts in this field, I have found it more\nuseful to see \u2018positive freedom\u2019 as the person\u2019s ability to do the things 102 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nin question taking everything into account (including external restraints as\nwell as internal limitations). In this interpretation, a violation of negative\nfreedom must also be \u2014 unless compensated by some other factor \u2014 a\nviolation of positive freedom, but not vice versa. This way of seeing\npositive freedom is not the one preferred by Isaiah Berlin.\nThis quote also draws attention to another drawback of defining\ncapabilities in terms of positive freedom. Violations of negative freedoms\nwill, according to Sen, always lead to violations of positive freedoms; yet\nfor Berlin this need not be the case. In a totalitarian state which espouses\na doctrine of positive freedom, in which the state will help the citizens\nto \u2018liberate their true selves\u2019, a violation of a range of negative freedoms,\nsuch as the freedom of expression or of the freedom to hold property,\nwill not violate positive freedom; on the contrary, within the parameters\nof that doctrine, violations of such negative freedoms may even enhance\nthe state-aspired positive freedom.\nSo where does all this terminological exegesis lead us? It has often\nbeen remarked that there are many available definitions of negative\nand positive freedom. Berlin\u2019s conceptualisations are canonical, but his\ndefinition of positive freedom is very different from Sen\u2019s. Moreover, as\nCharles Taylor (1979, 175) rightly pointed out, the debate on negative and\npositive freedoms has been prone to polemical attacks that caricature\nthe views of both sides. One therefore wonders what is to be gained by\ndescribing capabilities in terms of positive freedoms \u2014 at least, if one\nis aware of the philosophical background to this term. Perhaps it may\nbe wiser to look further for an alternative conceptualisation that is less\nprone to creating misunderstandings?\n3.3.2 Capabilities as opportunity or option freedoms?\nLuckily, in other parts of Amartya Sen\u2019s writings we can find the\nanswer to the question of what kind of freedoms capabilities are (if any\nat all). Although Sen\u2019s first descriptions of capabilities were couched\nexclusively in terms of positive freedoms, he soon offered an alternative\ndescription in terms of opportunities.5 In his 1984 Dewey Lectures, Sen\n5 In fact, even this is not entirely correct, since in his earlier work and especially in\nhis work written for economists, Sen did not speak of \u2018capabilities\u2019, but rather of\n\u2018capability sets\u2019 and thus also of \u2018opportunity sets\u2019 (see section 3.2.1). 3. Clarifications 103\n(1985c, 201) defended a conceptualisation of wellbeing freedom in terms\nof capabilities, and defined wellbeing freedom as:\nwhether one person did have the opportunity of achieving the functioning\nvector that another actually achieved. This involves comparisons of\nactual opportunities that different persons have.\nSimilarly, in Inequality Reexamined, Sen (1992a, 31) writes:\nA person\u2019s position in a social arrangement can be judged in two different\nperspectives, viz. (1) the actual achievement, and (2) the freedom to\nachieve. Achievement is concerned with what we manage to accomplish,\nand freedom with the real opportunity that we have to accomplish what\nwe value.\nGiven Sen\u2019s descriptions of the freedoms that the capability approach is\nconcerned with in terms of opportunities, it seems a natural suggestion\nto investigate whether the concept of \u2018opportunity freedom\u2019 better\ncaptures the nature of capabilities.\nCharles Taylor, in his discussion of Berlin\u2019s distinction between\nnegative and positive freedom, has argued that beneath the distinction\nbetween positive and negative freedom lies another set of distinctions,\nnamely between an exercise concept of freedom and an opportunity\nconcept of freedom. The exercise concept of freedom refers to an agent\nbeing free \u201conly to the extent that one has effectively determined\noneself and the shape of one\u2019s life\u201d, whereas according to the opportunity\nconcept of freedom \u201cbeing free is a matter of what we can do, of what\nis open to us to do, whether or not we do anything to exercise these\noptions\u201d (Taylor 1979, 177). According to Taylor, theories of negative\nfreedom can be grounded on either an exercise or an opportunity\nconcept, but theories of positive freedom can never be grounded\nmerely on an opportunity concept. Taylor\u2019s goal is arguing in favour\nof the exercise concept of freedom, and shows that the crude view of\nnegative freedom (which, he argues, Berlin is defending) is untenable.\nTaylor (1979, 177) describes the opportunity concept of freedom thus:\n\u201cbeing free is a matter of what we can do, of what it is open to us to do,\nwhether or not we do anything to exercise these options. [\u2026] Freedom\nconsists just in there being no obstacle. It is a sufficient condition of\none\u2019s being free that nothing stand in the way\u201d. 104 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nIs Taylor\u2019s opportunity concept of freedom the kind of freedom we\nare searching for in our attempt to understand the nature of capabilities?\nHis concept comes close, but it is narrower than the conception of\nfreedom contained in the idea of capabilities. For Taylor, only external\nobstacles count in the definition of negative freedom (Taylor 1979,\n176, 193; Kukathas 2007, 688). He holds that the acknowledgement of\ninternal obstacles to action, including the action to choose between\ndifferent opportunities, merges an element of the exercise concept of\nfreedom into the opportunity concept. The notion of opportunity in\nTaylor\u2019s concept of opportunity freedom thus resembles a formal notion\nof opportunity more closely than a substantive notion.\nHere\u2019s an example to illustrate the difference between Taylor\u2019s\nopportunity concept of freedom and the notion of \u2018capabilities\u2019. If, in\na patriarchal community, men have all the power, and in a verbally\naggressive manner they teach girls and remind women that their place\nis inside the house, then surely these women do not have the same\nopportunity freedom to find employment in the nearest city where\nwomen from more liberal communities are holding jobs. In formal\nterms, the women from both communities may be able to work outside\nthe home since there are jobs available to women in the city, they are\nable-bodied and are able to commute to the city. Yet the women from the\npatriarchal community would face much bigger costs and would need\nto gather much more courage, and resist the subtle working of social\nnorms, before they could effectively access this formal opportunity. Put\nin capability terms, we would say that the first group of women has\na much smaller capability to work outside the home than the women\nliving in less patriarchal communities. If the costs and burdens borne\nby the women from strongly patriarchal communities are excessive, we\ncould even conclude that the capability to work in the city is virtually\nnonexistent.\nLuckily, more recent debates in political philosophy have further\ndeveloped this discussion, in a way that is helpful in answering the\nquestion of how capabilities should be understood. Philip Pettit (2003)\nhas argued that the philosophical debate on social freedom could\nbenefit from being clear on the distinction between option-freedom\nand agency-freedom. While option-freedom is a property of options, 3. Clarifications 105\nagency-freedom is a property of agents. Agency-freedom relates to the\nlong tradition in philosophy of seeing the slave as the prime example of\nsomeone who is not free: he is subjugated to the will of others. Agency-\nfreedom focusses on the question of how a person relates to their fellows,\nand is a matter of social standing or status, not of the options that they\nenjoy (Pettit 2003, 394\u201395).\nOptions are the alternatives that an agent is in a position to realize.\nPettit argues that option freedom is a function of two aspects: the\ncharacter of access to options, and the character of options themselves.\nFirst, option freedom is a function of the character of the agent\u2019s access to\nthe options. Some philosophers would hold that the physical possibility\nof carrying out an option is sufficient for access, and thus would conclude\nthat the agent has option freedom. Alternatively, one could defend the\nposition that access to an option does not only depend on the physical\npossibility of carrying out the option, but that non-physical barriers\nare relevant too. Pettit distinguishes two possibilities: either an agent is\nobjectively more burdened than another agent when trying to access an\noption, whether by difficulty or by penalty, or an agent is subjectively\nburdened in the sense that he believes that access to an option is not\npossible. The second aspect of option freedom is the character of the\noptions. Here a wide range of views exist, such as the number of options\nthat are accessible, their diversity, and whether they are objectively\nsignificant or subjectively significant (Pettit 2003, 389\u201392).\nCapabilities are precisely this kind of option freedom. What counts\nin the capability approach is indeed the access that a person has to a\nwide range of valuable alternative options. In sum, capabilities can be\nunderstood as opportunity or option freedoms, but are broader than\nTaylor\u2019s rather narrow opportunity concept of freedom. We can therefore\nconclude that it is conceptually sound to understand capabilities as\nfreedoms of this sort.6\n6 It doesn\u2019t follow, of course, that capability theories would not be able to pay attention\nto agency freedom. They do \u2014 for example by including relational capabilities in\nthe selection of relevant dimensions, or by having some ideal of agency freedom as\nan additional moral principle included in module C4. 106 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\n3.3.3 Are capabilities best understood as freedoms?\nThe detailed analysis in the previous section doesn\u2019t settle all questions,\nthough. It may well be the case that it is coherent to see capabilities as\nfreedoms, but that there is another notion, such as human rights, basic\nneeds, or something similar, that much better captures what capabilities\nare.\nThe answer to that question has to be contextual in the following\nsense. The capability approach is a deeply interdisciplinary approach,\nyet scholars from different disciplines will have different associations\nwith certain terms. Philosophers may well have very different\nassociations with the word \u2018freedom\u2019 than, say, anthropologists or\ndevelopment sociologists. Similar remarks can be made when the\ncapability approach is being applied for policy and political purposes,\nsince the term \u2018freedom\u2019 has in some countries a particular historical\nconnotation, or is being claimed by extreme right or extreme left political\nparties, in the sense that if they were to come to power, they would\nuse that power to drastically curtail the capabilities of (some sections\nof) the population. However, one should also not forget that the word\n\u2018capabilities\u2019 is non-existent in many languages, and may itself also lead\nto mistaken connotations, for example with skills or capacities in its\nFrench translation (capacit\u00e9).\nWhen developing a particular capability theory or capability\napplication, should we frame the capability approach in terms of\nfreedoms? My suggestion would be to answer this question in a\npragmatic fashion. If the context in which the capability approach is\napplied makes it likely that the use of the term freedom will lead to the\napplication being misunderstood, then I would suggest that one defines,\ndescribes and illustrates the word \u2018capabilities\u2019 and introduces that\nterm. Yet for moral philosophers and political theorists who are eager to\nfurther develop the capability approach into a coherent political theory,\na clear understanding of capabilities as option freedoms may pave the\nway for work that lies ahead. Pettit\u2019s analysis of option freedoms, and\nthe established literature to which he is referring in his analysis, give\nthe capability scholar a neat overview of the choices that need to be\nmade if one wants to turn the underspecified capability approach into\na well-specified moral or political capability theory. For the political 3. Clarifications 107\nphilosopher, there is therefore less reason to be worried about being\nmisunderstood when referring to capabilities as option freedoms, or as\nopportunity freedoms.\n3.4 Functionings or capabilities?\nWe now move to examine the issue that is central to module B6: should\nwe, when developing a capability analysis or capability theory, focus on\nfunctionings, capabilities, or a mixture of both? After all, this question\nis not settled. It is one of the core features of the capability approach\nthat it uses \u2018functionings\u2019 and \u2018capabilities\u2019 as core notions (property\nA1, as discussed in 2.6.1) and that every capability analysis endorses\nthe claim that functionings and/or capabilities form the evaluative space\n(property A5, as discussed in 2.6.5). But this still leaves the question\nunanswered whether we should focus on functionings, or on capabilities\nor on a combination of functionings and capabilities. Perhaps we have\ngood reasons sometimes to focus on functionings, and sometimes\non capabilities, for example for different types of applications, or for\ndifferent groups of people?\nLuckily, this question is not new to the capability literature, and\nthere is by now a lively debate with many different types of arguments\nabout whether the appropriate wellbeing metric should be capabilities\nor functionings, hence opportunities or achievements. What reasons or\nconsiderations have been argued to be relevant for this choice?7\nThe first consideration concerns anti-paternalism. It is a normative\nconsideration: by focusing on capabilities rather than functionings, we\ndo not force people into a particular account of good lives but instead\naim at a range of possible ways of life from which each person can\nchoose. Thus, it is the liberal nature of the capability approach, or an\nanti-paternalist commitment, that motivates a principled choice of\ncapabilities rather than functionings. Obviously, the strength of this\nargument depends on how bad one takes paternalism to be. There may\nbe good reasons to believe that some paternalism is unavoidable, or\neven desired (Nussbaum 2000, 51\u201356; Robeyns 2016b). Moreover, some\n7 General discussions surveying different reasons to choose for functionings,\ncapabilities or both, can also be found in Robeyns and Van der Veen (2007, 45\u201399,\n76\u201378), Hick and Burchardt (2016, 79\u201382) and Robeyns (2016b). 108 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nscholars have argued that some element of paternalism in the capability\napproach may well be unavoidable. One reason is that the protection\nof the capacity to choose from one\u2019s capability set requires certain\nfunctionings, such as mental health and education, to be promoted as\nachievements, rather than merely as freedoms (Gandjour 2008). Another\nreason is that the protection of certain specific capabilities requires\neither previously certain functionings-levels, or else requires certain\nlevels of achievement of other capabilities, or requires that enough other\npeople have functionings achievements within those capabilities (e.g.\nRobeyns and Van der Veen 2007; Claassen 2014; Robeyns 2016b). Rutger\nClaassen has identified five different types of mechanisms in which\ncapability protection leads to the promotion of functionings, and has\nconcluded that \u201cany capability theory will have to confront the issue of\npaternalism\u201d (Claassen 2014, 72).\nAs this literature shows, there are many reasons why one can\nreasonably decide sometimes to promote functionings, rather than\ncapabilities. Here, I will only give one example, namely limits to our\ncapacities to make informed choices in a voluntary, autonomous\nway. Let us start with an uncontested case: infants and the severely\ncognitively disabled. The concept of functioning has particular relevance\nfor our relations to those human beings who are not yet able to choose\n(infants), who will never be able to make complex choices (severely\nmentally disabled individuals), or who have lost this ability through\nadvanced dementia or serious brain damage. Whether or not these\npersons can decide to be well nourished and healthy, it is generally\nheld that we (through families, governments, or other institutions)\nhave the moral obligation to promote or protect their nutritional and\nhealthy functioning. All capability theorists agree that in these cases,\nwe should focus on functionings rather than capabilities. The implicit\nunderlying assumption in the claim that capabilities have normative\npriority over functionings is that we assume the presence of a sufficient\nlevel of agency in the individuals who will be given the power to make\ntheir own choices from their capability sets. If we have strong reason\nto believe that such agency cannot be attributed to a person, we should\nnot let the person herself decide on which options to choose; however,\nwe should find ways of compensating for that lack of agency \u2014 either\nby having a steward make the choices for her or by guiding her in the 3. Clarifications 109\nchoice-making process. Thus, we will shift our normative concern from\ncapabilities to functionings for those who are incapable of deciding for\nthemselves. In empirical research, this implies, for example, that it is\nfine to study the quality of life of small children by focussing on a range\nof functionings (e.g. Phipps 2002).\nBut the paternalism claim is not limited to the case of infants and the\nseverely cognitively disabled: one could also apply this argument \u2014 at\nleast to some extent and in some areas \u2014 to all adults. Adults, too, often\nmake systematically irrational or mistaken choices. We are often not\nable to choose what is best for us simply because of our psychological\nmakeup; many of our choices are the result of the impulsive, unreflective,\nhabit-driven part of our brain rather than the deliberative and reflective\npart. There is mounting empirical evidence of our systematic failures in\nchoice-making, that we are influenced by a large number of arbitrary\nfactors in making choices and that we often harm our own interests in\nnon-deliberate and non-intentional ways (e.g. Ariely 2010; Kahneman\n2011). It is entirely consistent for a capability theory to argue that we\nhave strong reasons to protect people against their own systematic\nirrationalities, just as it is consistent for the capability approach to argue\nthat there are stronger reasons why we should allow people to make\nthe errors that follow from their own systematic irrationalities: both\npositions follow from choices made in the B-modules.\nSumming up, we have here a first normative consideration that can\nhelp us to decide whether some (limited or fuller) focus on functionings\nrather than capabilities is acceptable, namely the question of whether\nthere are mechanisms that justify paternalism.\nA second normative consideration in the choice between capabilities\nand functionings stems from the importance given to personal\nresponsibility in contemporary political philosophy. If one believes that\nthe moral aim should be to establish equality of opportunity, then it\nfollows that one should, at least as an ideal, favour equality of capability\nover equality of functionings. If equality of capability becomes the ideal,\nthen each person should have the same real opportunity (capability),\nbut once that is in place, each individual should be held responsible\nfor his or her own choices. It is important to stress, however, that\nphilosophers and social scientists working on issues of social justice\ndo not at all agree on whether equality of opportunity (capabilities) 110 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nshould be the goal, rather than equality of outcome (functionings). On\nthe one hand, the responsibility-sensitivity principle is widely endorsed\nnot only in political philosophy but also in the mathematical models\nbeing developed in normative welfare economics. If one wants to\nendorse and implement this principle of responsibility-sensitivity, then\nspecifications and applications of the capability approach should focus\non capabilities, rather than functionings. On the other hand, scholars\nhave objected to the weight given to personal responsibility, both within\nthe highly abstract theorising about ideals and when considering more\napplied and practical issues. At a highly abstract theoretical level,\nphilosophers disagree on whether we should endorse responsibility-\nsensitivity in developing the capability approach (Fleurbaey 2002;\nVallentyne 2005; Wolff and De-Shalit 2007). Moreover, for applied\nwork, serious epistemological hurdles may ultimately lead us to drop\nthe responsibility-sensitivity principle for practical reasoning about\nthe actual world: in practice, it is often impossible to know what the\ncausal factors were that led someone to make decisions that lowered\nher achieved wellbeing, and hence it is difficult or even impossible to\nknow whether the causal factors are those for which one could be held\nmorally responsible or not.\nThirdly, there may be institutional considerations that have an influence\non whether we choose functionings, capabilities, or a mixture (Robeyns\n2016b). Take the example of a government that has, with the broad\nsupport of the population, set up a welfare state arrangement, which\nincludes certain welfare rights. Then this government may demand\nfrom citizens who want to be part of this societal arrangement that they\nproactively aim to master, secure, or maintain certain functionings,\nsuch as being able to read and write, or to speak a language that does\nnot exclude one from holding a job. A welfare state arrangement that\noffers citizens relatively generous welfare rights can legitimately induce\nor perhaps even force citizens and legal residents to choose certain\nfunctionings that are needed in order to justly participate in that welfare\nstate arrangement. But here, again, one has to pay attention to detail and\nbe careful, since we would want to distinguish between those who didn\u2019t\nexercise a functioning but had the capability versus those who didn\u2019t\nexercise a functioning but due to inability didn\u2019t have the capability in\nthe first place. For example, if the political community believes that it is 3. Clarifications 111\na fair requirement in order to enjoy the benefits of the welfare state that\none learns the major dominant local language, then we have to make a\ndistinction between those who do, those who don\u2019t but could, and those\nwho don\u2019t but are unable. In practice, that distinction may sometimes\nbe very hard to make. Nevertheless, the general point to take home is\nthat an outcome-oriented theory of justice needs to be bolstered with an\naccount of what justice requires from the institutional design for a state\nor coalition of states. Reasons of reciprocity, feasibility, and stability\nmay justify a focus on functionings rather than merely on capabilities.\nFourthly, there are pervasive cases of interdependence between\npeople\u2019s capabilities that may prompt us to look beyond the capability of\na single person. One important type of case is that in which a capability\nis available to a person but only if other people do not also want to realize\nthat capability (Basu 1987, 74). For example, two spouses may each have\nthe capability of holding demanding jobs which are each incompatible\nwith large caring responsibilities. However, if these spouses also have\ninfants or relatives with extensive care needs, then at best only one of\nthem may effectively realize that capability. Another type of case is that\nin which the capability of one person is only possible if enough other\npeople have chosen to realise the corresponding functioning (Claassen\n2014, 67\u201368). Take the example of being protected against dangerous\ninfectious diseases such as polio or measles by way of a vaccine. In order\ngenuinely to have that capability, one does not only need access to a\nvaccination, but enough other people need to choose to be vaccinated,\nsince protection requires that a certain minimal number of people are\nvaccinated. In other words, my child\u2019s capability to be protected from\nthe debilitating effects of polio or the measles depends on your choice to\nexercise that capability and opt for the functioning \u2014 that is, to vaccinate\nyour children.\nSince capability sets may thus include freedoms that are conditional\n(because they depend on the choices of other people), it might be better\nto focus both on the individual\u2019s capability set and also on what people\nhave been able to realize from their own capability sets, that is, their\nfunctionings or wellbeing achievements. The question of who decides\nor should decide this sort of question highlights the importance of\nagency and procedural fairness, which are often additional normative\ncommitments included in the capability theory that is developed. 112 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nFinally, note that in many empirical applications, an analysis of\nfunctionings is used as a proxy for an analysis of the capability set. In the\ncase of comparison of inequalities between groups, it has been argued\nthat group-inequalities in functionings should be taken to reflect group-\ninequalities in capabilities, except if a plausible reason can be offered\nfor why the members of those groups would systematically choose\ndifferently (Robeyns 2003; Kuklys and Robeyns 2005). Tania Burchardt\nand Rod Hicks have stressed that if inferences about capabilities based\non information about functionings are made, one should be explicit\nabout the underlying assumptions, and that three different situations\ncould occur, namely:\n(1) situations in which all difference in outcomes might reasonably\nbe attributed to differences in capabilities (such as where a person is\nassaulted); (2) situations where differences in preferences may result in\ndifferences in outcomes, but where for the purposes of public policy it\nmay be possible to assume that any differences are a result of differing\nlevels of capabilities; and (3) situations in which additional evidence\nmay be needed in order to determine whether differences in outcomes\nare genuinely a result of differences in capability. (Hick and Burchardt\n2016, 80)\nWhat is the upshot of all these considerations? In my view, there are\nsound reasons why one would limit oneself to capabilities, there are\nsound reasons why one would rather focus only on functionings, and\nthere are sound reasons why one would prefer a mixture. The choice\ndepends on the purpose of the capability theory, but also on the\nadditional ontological choices one endorses (e.g. one\u2019s idea of human\nnature \u2014 are we fully rational or not, and what, if anything, should be\nthe consequences for policy making and institutional design), on the\nnormative principles one adds to the core of the capability approach\nwhen developing a capability theory (e.g. endorsement of neutrality or\nnot), and on practical constraints one is facing. We cannot say in general\nthat the capability approach should focus exclusively on capabilities,\nor exclusively on functionings. It all depends on additional theoretical\nchoices and normative commitments, which can be made in modules B\nand C, when developing a capability analysis.8\n8 I therefore think that Nussbaum\u2019s (2011c) claim that it is a core property of the\ncapability approach that it focusses on capabilities rather than functionings is\nmistaken (Robeyns 2011, 2016b; see also Claassen 2014). 3. Clarifications 113\n3.5 Human diversity in the capability approach\nIn the previous chapter, it was already highlighted that diversity among\nhuman beings is a key motivation as well as a conceptual characteristic\nof the capability approach (module B3). Given how central human\ndiversity is to the approach, it is worth saying a few more words on this\ntopic. There are two important points to make: first, the mechanisms that\nthe capability approach has at its disposal to account for diversity, and\nsecond, the attention given to diversity within the existing capability\nliterature.\nThe capability approach takes account of human diversity in at\nleast two ways. First, by its focus on the plurality of functionings and\ncapabilities as important evaluative spaces. By including a wide range\nof dimensions in the conceptualization of wellbeing and wellbeing\noutcomes, the approach broadens the so-called \u2018informational basis\u2019\nof assessments, and thereby includes some dimensions that may\nbe particularly important for some groups but less so for others. For\nexample, in standard outcome assessments, women as a group virtually\nalways end up being worse off than men. But if the selection of outcome\ndimensions is shifted to also include the quality and quantity of social\nrelations and support, and being able to engage in hands-on care, then\nthe normative assessment of gender inequality becomes less univocal\nand requires much further argument and normative analysis, including\nbeing explicit about how to aggregate different dimensions (Robeyns\n2003, 2006a).\nSecondly, human diversity is stressed in the capability approach by\nthe explicit focus on personal and socio-environmental conversion factors\nthat make possible the conversion of commodities and other resources\ninto functionings, and on the social, institutional, and environmental\ncontexts that affect the conversion factors and the capability set directly.\nEach individual has a unique profile of conversion factors, some of\nwhich are body-related, while others are shared with all people from her\ncommunity, and still others are shared with people with the same social\ncharacteristics (e.g. same gender, class, caste, age, or race characteristics).\nIn the account of the capability approach presented in chapter 2, this\nis made very explicit by having module A3 focus on the conversion\nfactors, which is an important source of interpersonal variations (the\nother source is how structural constraints affect people differently). As 114 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nSen (1992a, xi) has argued, interpersonal variations should be of central\nimportance to inequality analysis:\nInvestigations of equality \u2014 theoretical as well as practical \u2014 that\nproceed with the assumption of antecedent uniformity (including the\npresumption that \u2018all men are created equal\u2019) thus miss out on a major\naspect of the problem. Human diversity is no secondary complication (to\nbe ignored, or to be introduced \u2018later on\u2019); it is a fundamental aspect of\nour interest in equality.\nIndeed, if human beings were not diverse, then inequality in one space,\nsay income, would more or less be identical with inequality in another\nspace, like capabilities. The entire question of what the appropriate\nevaluative space should be would become obsolete if there weren\u2019t\nany interpersonal difference in the mapping of outcomes in one space\nonto another. If people were all the same and had the same needs and\nabilities, then the capability approach would lose much of its force\nand significance, since resources would be excellent proxies for our\nwellbeing and wellbeing freedom. But as it happens, human beings are\nvery diverse.\nHowever, we also need to acknowledge that there is significant\nscholarly dispute about the question of which dimensions and\nparameters of human diversity are salient, and which are not. Scholars\nembrace very different accounts of human diversity, which is why\nwe have module B3 in the capability approach. One\u2019s account of\nhuman diversity can often be traced back to the ontological accounts\none accepts of diversity-related factors, as well as the role of groups\nin explanatory accounts. An example of the former is the account of\ngender and race that one embraces. If one holds a theory of gender and\nrace that regards these as rather superficial phenomena that do not\nhave an important impact on people\u2019s behaviour and opportunities in\nlife, then the attention given to diversity in a capability application or\ncapability theory will be rather minimal. This is logically consistent with\nthe structure of capability theories (as laid out in chapter 2), but it is also\na view that has not been widely embraced in the capability literature.\nInstead, the capability approach attracts scholars who endorse accounts\nof dimensions of gender, race, and other dimensions of human diversity\nthat are much richer. Presumably, these scholars recognise the ways in\nwhich the capability approach can account for human diversity, hence 3. Clarifications 115\nthis may explain why most capability scholars endorse rich accounts of\nsuch diversity.\nA strong acknowledgement of human diversity has therefore become\na hallmark of the capability approach as that literature has developed.\nIts criticism of other normative approaches is often fuelled by, and based\non, the claim that human diversity is insufficiently acknowledged in\nmany normative frameworks and theories. This also explains why the\ncapability approach is often favourably regarded by feminist scholars,\nand by academics concerned with global justice, race or class relations, or\ncare and disability issues. One of the main complaints of these scholars\nabout mainstream philosophy and economics has been precisely this\nissue: the relative invisibility of the fate of those people whose lives do\nnot correspond to that of an able-bodied, non-dependent, caregiving-\nfree individual who belongs to the dominant ethnic, racial and religious\ngroups.\n3.6 Collective capabilities\nSeveral scholars have proposed the introduction of a category of\n\u2018collective capabilities\u2019 or \u2018community capabilities\u2019 (Evans 2002; Ibrahim\n2006, 2009, 2017; Schlosberg and Carruthers 2010; Murphy 2014). The\nidea of \u2018collective capabilities\u2019 is used in different ways in the literature,\nand not always spelled out very carefully. I will try to reconstruct what\n\u2018collective capabilities\u2019 could mean, and then discuss to what extent\nthese are different from human capabilities tout court.\nIt is instructive, first, to see in which contexts different authors\nintroduce the idea of \u2018collective capability\u2019. Here are a few typical\nexamples from the literature. Solava Ibrahim (2006, 2009, 2017) argues\nfor the importance of collective capabilities from the perspective of the\nwork done by self-help groups of poor people fighting to overcome\ntheir poverty, which is an issue also discussed by Stewart (2005).9 David\nSchlosberg and David Carruthers (2010) argue for the importance of the\nidea of collective capabilities to understand the struggles of indigenous\npeoples for ecological justice. And Michael Murphy (2014) argues\n9 Self-help groups are \u201cany informal income-generating or social activity initiated\nby a poor community to achieve permanent improvements in their individual and\ncommunal wellbeings\u201d (Ibrahim 2006, 398\u2013399). 116 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nthat political self-determination (of an indigenous group) should be\nconsidered to be a collective capability which should be a central aim\nfor development.\nWhat is shared in those cases, and what makes the idea of \u2018collective\ncapability\u2019 plausible, is that a group or collective is needed to engage in\ncollective action in order to reach the capability that the members of that\ngroup find valuable.\nSen (2002b) points out that we should be careful not to confuse\nthis with a capability that he calls \u201csocially dependent individual\ncapability\u201d \u2014 a person\u2019s capability, which that person enjoys, but\nfor which the person is dependent on others to have that capability\nrealised. Perhaps we should not use the term \u2018individual capability\u2019\nbut rather \u2018personal capability\u2019, since for many defenders of \u2018collective\ncapabilities\u2019 the word \u2018individual\u2019 evokes pejorative images of persons\nliving by themselves on an island. There are no such human creatures;\nwe all live interdependently, and none of us could grow up without\nprolonged care from others, or, as adults, have a decent chance of\nsurviving and living a minimally adequate life. Human beings are, just\nas other mammals, animals who live in groups. Although philosophers\nare used to working with terms outside their everyday use, and most\nphilosophers (especially those with an analytical background) will not\nhave these pejorative connotations when they hear the term \u2018individual\ncapabilities\u2019, I will proceed with the term \u2018personal capabilities\u2019 in order\nto facilitate the discussion in this section.\nNow, if we are very strict in our terminological distinctions, then\ncollective capabilities are also personal capabilities, since it is individual\npersons who enjoy the capabilities that are thus secured. Still, there are\ntwo justifications to proceed with the term \u2018collective capability\u2019 \u2014 one\nfundamental one, and one additional one which is especially weighty\nfrom a practical point of view.\nThe fundamental reason to keep and use the term \u2018collective\ncapability\u2019 is that we may want to make a distinction between capabilities\nthat are only realisable with the help of others, versus capabilities that\nrequire a group or collective to act in order to secure a capability for the\nmembers of that group. An example of the former would be learning a\nforeign language. It is impossible to do that without the help of others;\none needs a teacher, or at the very least books and audio-tapes or\ninternet lessons that help one with self-study. Still, that doesn\u2019t suffice 3. Clarifications 117\nto say that learning a language is a collective capability. There is no\ngroup involved, and no collective action of that group is necessary in\norder to achieve the functioning. A different case is acquiring the\ncapability to vote in elections for groups that are not yet given suffrage.\nFighting for that capability is not possible on one\u2019s own. One needs\ncollective action \u2014 e.g. the first wave women\u2019s movement, or the civil\nrights movement in the US, or the anti-apartheid movement in South\nAfrica \u2014 to act collectively so that the group is granted the capability,\nand all persons who belong to that group can enjoy the newly won\nfreedom.\nThe second reason to accept the notion of \u2018collective capability\u2019 is\nbecause it is already present in the practice of certain justice movements,\nwhose demands fit very well with the capability approach, for example\nbecause they embody claims of diversity or because they fight for a\nnotion of the good life or of justice that goes beyond a narrow materialist\nor economistic view of what is valuable. Examples include the disability\nmovement, the women\u2019s movement and indigenous struggles.\nSo the idea of a collective capability can be understood and can be\njustified. Nevertheless, two warnings are in order, which may be needed\nto avoid conceptual confusion as well as an overuse or inflation of the\nnotion. The first comment is that all that has been said so far does not\npermit one to conclude that one has personal (individual) capabilities\nand collective capabilities as two mutually exclusive categories. Rather,\ncollective capabilities are a subset of personal capabilities, namely\nthose personal capabilities that require for their realisation action by a\ngroup or a collectivity. Secondly, we should be very careful to be clear\nto keep our concepts distinct and correct when developing a capability\ntheory. The modular account of the capability approach has ample\nconceptual and theoretical space to account for collective processes,\nthe social embedding of persons, the influence of social structures on\nour choices and opportunities, a proper acknowledgement of social\nprocesses of preference formation as well as the crucial role of social\ninstitutions and norms in shaping a person\u2019s capability set. But if we\nwant to account for a social process, we shouldn\u2019t just jump to the claim\nthat we have now found a collective capability. Rather, we should use\nthe quite complex and multi-layered framework that was presented in\nfigure 2.1, and be clear when something is a social structure that is shaping\nour capabilities, rather than a capability itself. Means to ends (capabilities) 118 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nand the \u2018capability determinants\u2019 (the social structures, social norms,\ninstitutions, etc.) can all be part of our evaluation \u2014 we just need to\nkeep in mind which parts of what we evaluate are the means, which\nare the ends and why we evaluate a certain dimension. In the case of\nthe evaluation of the means, one important reason could be to see how\nthose means have changed over time, as well as whether there is any\nscope to improve the contribution that those particular means can make\nto the increase of capability sets.\n3.7 Which notion of wellbeing is used in the\ncapability approach?\nThe capability approach is closely related to notions of wellbeing and\nthe quality of life. Sometimes it is assumed that the capability approach\nis a theory of wellbeing, which cannot be quite right since the capability\napproach can be used for many purposes, such as the construction of\na theory of justice, poverty measurement or policy evaluation. Yet on\nthe other hand, with its proposition that interpersonal comparisons\nbe made in terms of functionings and/or capabilities, the capability\napproach is clearly also involved in offering us an account of wellbeing\n(Sen 1984c, 1985c, 2009a; Alkire 2016; Qizilbash 2013). But what, exactly,\nis the nature of the account of wellbeing in the capability approach?\nI will argue in this chapter that the more precise formulation is that\nthe capability approach entails several slightly different accounts\nof wellbeing, which can be used for different purposes. Different\ncapability theories have different purposes (module B1) and different\nmeta-theoretical commitments (module B7), and the choices made in\nthose modules will require different accounts of wellbeing for such\ncapability theories.\nWhen one looks at the accounts of wellbeing in the various disciplines\nin which the notion of \u2018wellbeing\u2019 plays a central role, one quickly\nnotices that there are a range of quite different accounts proposed\nin different paradigms or disciplines, and that there is very limited\ndiscussion between those fields (Gasper 2010). In particular, there is\nsurprisingly little interaction between the very large philosophical\nliterature on wellbeing (Crisp 2013; Fletcher 2015) and the (theoretical\nand empirical) literature in psychology and economics, or the uses of\nthe term wellbeing in particular fields, such as development studies 3. Clarifications 119\nor medical care. There are a few scholars who have tried to grasp this\ndiscrepancy, as well as explain why the philosophical and theoretical\nliteratures, as well as the debates in different disciplines, are so little\nconnected (e.g. Alexandrova 2013; Rodogno 2015b, 2015a). This is the\nbackground against which we must try to understand the place of the\ncapability approach in thinking about wellbeing, and try to understand\nthe accounts of wellbeing used in capability theories. I therefore believe\nthat it is helpful first to try to grasp that scholarly context in somewhat\nmore detail (section 3.7.1). Then we will briefly look at the standard\ntypology of wellbeing theories (section 3.7.2), before analysing the\nquestion of which account (or rather, accounts) of wellbeing are entailed\nin the capability approach (section 3.7.3).\nBefore we start, one further clarification may be helpful. Recall\nthat the capability approach includes a notion of achieved wellbeing\n(focussing on functionings) as well as a notion of wellbeing freedom,\nrepresented by one\u2019s capability set (Sen 1985c, 1993a). The distinction\nbetween achieved wellbeing and wellbeing freedom is virtually absent\nfrom the wellbeing literature. In contemporary philosophy, most\nphilosophical accounts focus on how well life is going for a person,\nhence on achieved wellbeing. But clearly, for policy purposes, we will\noften focus on wellbeing freedom, since other values, such as respect\nfor personal autonomy or even human dignity, may prevent us from\nhaving a specific wellbeing outcome as a legitimate policy goal. When\nin the capability approach the term \u2018wellbeing freedom\u2019 is used, it\nrefers to what philosophers elsewhere would call \u2018opportunities for\nwellbeing\u2019. This notion is especially relevant in moral theories where\nwe try to balance a concern for wellbeing with a concern for individual\nfreedom to choose: the term \u2018wellbeing freedom\u2019 tries to bring together\nand integrate those two values.\n3.7.1 The aim and context of accounts of wellbeing\nPhilosophical discussions of wellbeing typically start out from a rather\ngeneral definition of wellbeing, stating that wellbeing is about how well\nthe life of a person is going for that person. The addition \u2018for that person\u2019\nis important, since it means that in the philosophical literature wellbeing\nis generally conceived as what we could call a personal value, or a first-\nperson value, rather than an institutional value \u2014 a value that we have to 120 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nconsider when we think about how to organise our collective life. While\nthis demarcates \u2018wellbeing\u2019 from other public values such as \u2018justice\u2019 or\n\u2018efficiency\u2019, this is still a very general notion that can be elaborated in\nmany different ways. Moreover, as was already mentioned, if we look\nat the debates in contemporary philosophy of wellbeing, we notice that\nthey hardly relate at all to the empirical discussions in policy studies\nand the social sciences (with the exception of the relatively recent boom\nin subjective wellbeing analysis, which will be discussed in section 3.8).\nAnna Alexandrova (2013) argues that the diversity in scholarship on\nwellbeing can be explained by the fact that the meaning of the use of the\nterm \u2018wellbeing\u2019 differs depending on the context in which it is used. If\nthe word \u2018wellbeing\u2019 is used by a medical doctor, or a policy maker, or a\nsociologist, or an adolescent reflecting on her options for her future life,\nthey all use the term \u2018wellbeing\u2019 for different purposes and in a different\ncontext. I would like to add that, in particular, the aim or the purpose of\nour use of the term \u2018wellbeing\u2019 is crucial. That is, the term \u2018wellbeing\u2019\nis never used in a vacuum; each use of that term plays a role in either\nexplanatory or else normative projects. Normative projects always have\na purpose, that is, something to judge, evaluate or recommend, which is\nprecisely the choice that has to be made in module B1 in the account of\nthe capability approach presented in chapter 2. Depending on whether\nwe use the term \u2018wellbeing\u2019 for policy making, or for purely descriptive\nwork, or for deciding what we owe to each other as fellow citizens, the\nterm wellbeing will play a different function.\nMost work on wellbeing in contemporary analytical philosophy is\nconcerned with answering the question \u201cWhat would be the best for\nsomeone, or would be most in this person\u2019s interests, or would make\nthis person\u2019s life go, for him, as well as possible?\u201d (Parfit 1984, 493). This\nis especially the case for the literature since the publication of Derek\nParfit\u2019s typology of theories of wellbeing. While Parfit\u2019s typology is\narguably crude, it has been very influential, and still serves an important\nfunction as an influential attempt that a philosopher has made to classify\naccounts of wellbeing.\nIn the next section, we will consider how (if at all) the capability\napproach fits into Parfit\u2019s typology. But it is important to note that\nthis highly abstract, very detailed and analytical strand in philosophy\nis only to a very limited degree concerned with (a) empirical 3. Clarifications 121\napplicability and measurement or (b) practical consequences, in the\nsense of action-guidance such as the establishment of normatively\nsound policy making or the question of which social arrangements we\nshould want. The dominant contemporary philosophical literature on\nwellbeing is concerned with philosophical investigation in the sense\nof finding truths, and typically focussed on the entire lives of people\nfrom their own, first-person, perspective. That literature is much less\nconcerned with wellbeing as an institutional value, with asking which\naccount of wellbeing would be best when deciding what institutions\nwe should implement \u2014 a question that can only be answered after\ntaking feasibility considerations into account, or considering what\nwould be best from the point of view of ethically sound policy making.\nHowever, as Alexandrova (2013, 311) rightly points out, \u201cthe context\nof an all-things-considered evaluation of life as a whole privileged by\nphilosophers is just that: one of the many contexts in which wellbeing is\nin question\u201d. Since most uses of the term \u2018wellbeing\u2019 in other debates,\ne.g. in applied philosophy or other disciplines, are concerned with\noverall evaluations of states of affairs and/or policy making, it shouldn\u2019t\nsurprise us that there is very little cross-fertilisation between those\nphilosophical debates and the policy oriented and empirical literatures\nin other disciplines. This will have an influence on how we will, in the\nnext section, answer the question how the capability approach fits into\nthe standard typology of theories of wellbeing used in philosophy.\n3.7.2 The standard taxonomy of\nphilosophical wellbeing accounts\nIn Appendix I of his influential book Reasons and Persons, Parfit (1984,\n493) suggests that we should make a distinction between three types of\nphilosophical wellbeing theories.\nOn Hedonistic Theories, what would be best for someone is what would\nmake his life happiest. On Desire-Fulfilment Theories, what would be best\nfor someone is what, throughout this life, would best fulfil his desires.\nOn Objective List Theories, certain things are good or bad for us, whether\nor not we want to have the good things, or to avoid the bad things.\nIn interdisciplinary conversations, hedonistic theories are today\nbetter known under the label \u2018happiness theories\u2019. Interpreted from 122 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nthe perspective of the capability approach, hedonistic theories (or the\nhappiness approach) entail that the only functioning that matters is\nhappiness. The capability approach stresses what people can do and be\n(module A1) and \u2018happiness\u2019 or one\u2019s hedonic state at best refers to one\naspect of one\u2019s being, not the various aspects of what we can do. The\ncapability approach and the happiness approach do share some common\ncharacteristics, such as the fact that both focus on what they take to be of\nultimate value. Yet the two approaches have very different ideas of what\nthat \u2018ultimate value\u2019 should be, with the happiness approach defending\nan exclusive choice for a mental state versus the capability approach\ndefending the focus on a plurality of aspects of our lives. It is therefore\nnot plausible to see the happiness approach, or hedonism, as a specific\ncase of the capability approach. However, more can be said about the\nprecise relation between the capability approach and hedonistic or\nhappiness approaches, which will be done in section 3.8.\nHow about the desire-fulfilment theories, or the objective list\ntheories? Can the notion of wellbeing embedded in the capability\napproach plausibly be understood as either of those? Let us first\nvery briefly describe the two types of theories, and then ask how the\ncapability approach fits in.\nDesire-fulfilment theories of wellbeing claim, essentially, that wellbeing\nis the extent to which our desires are satisfied. These desires could\nbe our current, unquestioned desires. In philosophy, that is a view\nthat cannot count on many defenders, since it is very easy to think of\nexamples of current desires that will harm us in the near future, or else\ndesires for something that is, arguably, not good for us, such as a desire\nfor excessive amounts of food or alcohol. Philosophers have therefore\nproposed more sophisticated views of desires, called \u2018informed desires\u2019\n(e.g. Sumner 1996). Those are desires that meet additional conditions,\nand different proposals have been made for what those conditions\nshould be. Examples of such additional constraints include not\nbeing ignorant of facts, but also not being deceived, or not suffering\nfrom mental adaptation \u2014 which ranges from having adapted one\u2019s\naspirations to one\u2019s dire circumstances, to having adapted one\u2019s desires\nto one\u2019s extremely affluent circumstances, to a more general \u2018preference\nadaptation\u2019 which applies to all of us in societies with social norms and\nthe widespread use of advertisements. 3. Clarifications 123\nFor a philosophical theory of wellbeing, which merely asks the\nmetaphysical question what is wellbeing for the person who is living that life,\nand which has no consequences for the choice of social arrangements\nor policy making, the informed desire theory has a very important\nattraction: it gives the authority to decide what would make life better\nto the person whose wellbeing we are investigating. We also see this\naccount of wellbeing being helpfully put to work in various other\ncontexts. For example, if the daughter of a family-owned business\nhas no interest at all in continuing that business, and argues that her\nstrongest desire in life is to become a medical doctor, then her parents\nmay, regretfully, decide that it is indeed better for her to study medicine,\nsince that is what she really wants. They may perhaps urge her to talk\nto a friend who is a medical doctor to get a better understanding of\nwhat that profession entails (that is, to \u2018test\u2019 whether her preferences are\nproperly informed). Yet in such a context, the desire-fulfilment theory of\nwellbeing seems apt and appropriate.\nThe problems with the informed desire-fulfilment theory of\nwellbeing are especially relevant in other contexts where an account\nof wellbeing is needed for policy making or social change. The most\nsignificant is that our desires are moulded, not fully informed, and\nsubject to social norms and other forms of societal pressures and\nexpectations. For example, critics of capitalism argue that advertisement\nby profit-seeking companies form our preferences, and make us want\nthings we would be better off without. There are many subtle forms of\nmanipulation possible. Students of marketing learn that the products\nput at eye-height are more often taken by customers shopping in a\nsupermarket. At the macro-level, the culture of late-modern capitalism\ntells us to find happiness in material success and in trying to achieve\nhigher status in the dominant social order. We are socialised into these\npatterns, often not even aware of their existence. But why would those\ndesires give us the highest level of wellbeing? Another interesting case\nis the standards of beauty that women are expected to meet, which will\nmake them more attractive and ultimately happier. Dominant norms of\nbeauty put a huge pressure on women (and increasingly also on men),\nleading to anxieties, low self-esteem, and even unhealthy conditions\nand illnesses such as anorexia (Lavaque-Manty 2001). What if we could 124 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\n\u2018reset\u2019 our cultural and social norms, which would lead to less pressure,\nstress and fewer anxieties? Some alternative views of living, such as\nthose advanced by deep ecology thinkers (e.g. Naess 1973, 1984), are\nbased on the view that with a different set of desires, and a different\nappreciation of certain experiences and values, we would be able to\nlive not only in an ecologically sustainable way, but also have higher\nlevels of wellbeing. In sum, the desire-fulfilment theory is interesting\nand arguably plausible at the individual level, and also at the general\nlevel as a theoretical approach to wellbeing, which can make ample use\nof counterfactual and hypothetical thinking and conditions. But it is\nmuch trickier to think about wellbeing from a macro or third-person\nperspective in the world as it is, in which we don\u2019t have information on\nhow each person\u2019s preferences have been formed and influenced.\nHow does the objective list theory fare? Objective list theories\nare accounts of wellbeing that list items that make our lives better,\nindependent of our own view on this. The claim of objective list theories\nis that there is an irreducible plurality of issues that make up wellbeing;\nwellbeing is plural and cannot be reduced to a single thing. Secondly,\nthose items are objectively good for us, whether or not we attach any value\nto (or desire) those items. Hence items such as being healthy, or having\nfriends, or feeling well, are all good for us, whether we personally value\nthem or not.\nWhat are some of the main strengths and weaknesses of the objective\nlist theories? Objective list theories are generally criticised for not\nrespecting people\u2019s views about their own lives, and hence taking away\nthe authority to decide the quality of those lives from the agents leading\nthem: in other words, for being paternalistic. Who is to decide that,\nsay, social relationships are good for us? Now, this seems a very valid\ncritique if we use an objective list theory for purely descriptive and first-\nperson truth-seeking purposes, as the vast literature in philosophy does.\nBut if one uses accounts of wellbeing for policy or political purposes,\nthe public nature of the dimensions of wellbeing is rather important.\nThis relates to what political philosophers have called \u2018the publicity\ncriterion\u2019: if wellbeing is used for purposes of institutional design or\npolicy making, those principles used need to be capable of being known\nby all to be satisfied in society (Rawls 2009; Anderson 2010, 85). 3. Clarifications 125\nIndeed, this directly relates to an advantage of objective list theories:\nmany of the items that have been proposed by such theories have been\ntranslated into specific indicators such as health or social policy, or\nelse overall assessments have been made that can be used for an entire\npopulation. The long-standing literature on social indicators can be\nsituated in this tradition (Boelhouwer and Stoop 1999; Boelhouwer\n2002; Hagerty et al. 2001).\n3.7.3 The accounts of wellbeing\nin the capability approach\nSo how does the capability approach fit in this standard taxonomy?\nThe capability approach is often categorised as being an objective list\ntheory, since functionings and capabilities are plural and the selection\nof dimensions gives us a list of items which are judged to be valuable for\npersons. However, in my view there is not merely one wellbeing account\nin the capability approach, but several wellbeing accounts.\nSo why is there not one, but several accounts of wellbeing in the\ncapability literature? As was mentioned in the introduction to this\nsection, the reason is that there are a variety of capability theories in the\ngeneral capability literature, and those theories need different accounts\nof wellbeing. If a capability theory is used for a first-person perspective,\nfor example by an adolescent contemplating what to do with her life, she\nmay ask herself what she really wants: to study hard and work hard and\nbecome a medical doctor? Or does she have a stronger desire to build a\nfamily and search for a job that makes it possible to spend enough time\nwith her children? Does she want to devote her life to fighting for a\ngood cause? In this personal deliberation, the account of wellbeing she\nthen uses can be seen as a desire-fulfilment account in which the desires\nall refer to functionings.\nIn the design of institutions, there is also often implicitly a desire-\nfulfilment account, by trying to create valuable options (capabilities) for\ncitizens, but by not forcing them into those outcomes (functionings). But\npolicy making can\u2019t be done by trying to enlarge a non-specific general\naccount of freedom to realise one\u2019s desires: what would that look like?\nIn policy making, we often assume that what we owe to each other 126 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nare specific freedoms, not a general vague notion of overall freedom\n(Anderson 2000b). Therefore, at the policy level we can often see that the\nimplicit account of wellbeing is desire-fulfilment, whereby it is assumed\nthat the desires refer to particular functionings (such as being able to\nenjoy higher education or leisure activities in green spaces in cities), or,\nalternatively, policies provide the resources (money, and sometimes\ntime) that are inputs for a wide range of desires that people may have.\nIf a capability theory is made for macro-level poverty analysis, then\nthe researchers will select a number of functionings that they have\nreason to believe are good for people, such as their health, educational\noutcomes, and the kind of shelter in which they can live. The notion of\nachieved wellbeing entailed in this normative exercise is an objectively\ngood account, although one could also argue that one has reason\nto assume that these are dimensions of the quality of life that people\nwould want for themselves (hence their desires) and that, given that one\nis working with very large numbers, it is a safe assumption to proceed\nthis way.\nThere are at least two interesting things to notice. First, for policy\nmaking we often have to choose either an approach that uses resources\nas a proxy for wellbeing (although this cannot account for differences\nin conversion factors between people) or else policy makers will try\nto provide a range of options to us, where ideally the policy maker\nassumes that these options are things that many people want. Second,\nthe often-heard view that the account of wellbeing given by the\ncapability approach is an objective list theory doesn\u2019t seem to be true.\nRather, depending on the kind of capability theory one is pursuing (in\nparticular, the choice in B1) it is more accurate to see this as a desire-\nfulfilment or an objective list account.\n3.8 Happiness and the capability approach\nIn section 3.7.2, we encountered hedonist theories of wellbeing as\nan important subgroup of theories of wellbeing. The debates about\nhedonism and the happiness approach are closely related. Hedonism\nis the philosophical view that wellbeing can be captured by the balance\nof pleasures over pains. The core aspect is the exclusive focus on\nmental states, and on a person\u2019s subjective assessments of their own 3. Clarifications 127\nmental state. In recent decades, this approach has been revitalised in\n\u2018the happiness approach\u2019, although empirical scholars prefer the term\n\u2018subjective wellbeing\u2019 (SWB). The happiness and SWB literatures have\nin recent years gone through a revival.\nOn the empirical front, significant progress has been made in the\nlast few decades by an international network of economists and\npsychologists, such as Andrew Clark, Ed Diener, Ada Ferrer-i-Carbonell,\nBruno Frey, Richard Layard, Andrew Oswald, David Schkade, Bernard\nvan Praag and Ruut Veenhoven.10 Many of these scholars have\nconcluded that sufficient scientific progress has been made for public\npolicies to focus on subjective wellbeing. The measures of subjective\nwellbeing have been tested and refined, and much is supposedly known\nabout the determinants of happiness that the government can influence.\nThe happiness and SWB approaches are strongly focussed on empirical\nanalysis and policy design, and this is also, therefore, the main lens that\nwill be used in the comparison with the capability approach, although\nwe will very briefly discuss the comparison between the theoretical\nhappiness approach and the capability approach.\nFrom the perspective of the capability approach, the happiness\napproach raises three questions: First, what is the happiness approach,\nexactly? Second, what are its strengths and weaknesses? Third, what\nrole can happiness play in the capability approach?11\n3.8.1 What is the happiness approach?\nThe happiness approach is based on the assumption that wellbeing (or\nquality of life) is constituted by the subjective experiences of a person,\nexpressed in terms of utility, happiness, or satisfaction. Satisfaction\ncan be expressed in terms of overall satisfaction with life, or satisfaction\nwithin particular domains, such as income, health, family relationships,\nlabour, and so forth.\n10 See, for example, Veenhoven (1996); Kahneman et al. (2006); Schkade and\nKahneman (1998); Diener and Seligman (2004); Van Praag and Ferrer-i-Carbonell\n(2004); Ferrer-i-Carbonell (2005); Ferrer-i-Carbonell and Gowdy (2007); Frey and\nStutzer (2002).\n11 This section draws on, yet also modifies and expands, the analysis presented in\nRobeyns and Van der Veen (2007, 33\u201342). 128 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nIn the happiness approach, life satisfaction is understood as a concept\nthat combines two components: how we normally feel in everyday\nlife \u2014 the affective or \u2018hedonistic\u2019 component \u2014 and how we judge\nthe degree to which our preferences and aspirations in life have been\nrealised \u2014 the cognitive component. In order to find out how \u2018happy\u2019\na person is, respondents are asked, for example, to rate how satisfied\nthey are with their life on a scale from 1 to 10 (to measure the cognitive\ncomponent) and to report their mood at particular moments of the day,\nsometimes even with the aid of a buzzer set to go off at random times (to\nmeasure the affective component). In another method, the respondents\nare asked to imagine the worst possible life and to give that life a value\nof 0, to imagine the best possible life and give that a value of 10, and then\nto rate their own life on a scale from 0 to 10.\nThe view in the happiness literature is that overall life satisfaction\nshould be adopted as the official \u2018policy guide\u2019, and the task of the\ngovernment is to aim for the highest possible average level of life\nsatisfaction (Hagerty et al. 2001; Layard 2011). For comparisons in the\nlong term, Ruut Veenhoven also proposes to measure the quality of\nlife based on \u2018happy life expectancy\u2019. This is an index obtained from\nmultiplying life expectancy in a country with average overall life\nsatisfaction (Veenhoven 1996).\nIs the happiness approach, or the SWB approach, the best basis for\nthinking about wellbeing and the quality of life, especially against the\nbackground of policy design? The happiness approach certainly has a\nnumber of attractive features. Firstly, it puts the human being centre stage,\nrather than focusing on the means that human beings use to improve\ntheir quality of life. Hence the approach satisfies the core criterion from\nmodule A that means and ends should not be conceptually confused.\nSecondly, in considering the means to happiness, the subjective approach\nis not limited to material means, which is the major shortcoming of the\ndominant economic empirical methods. Income has only a limited (but\nnot unimportant) role to play in generating happiness.\nIn conclusion, the happiness approach does have some significant\nstrengths, but it also gives rise to some concerns. We will briefly discuss\nthe main theoretical problem, and then look in more detail at the worries\nraised for empirical research and policy making. 3. Clarifications 129\n3.8.2 The ontological objection\nThe theoretical worry is an ontological worry, that is, it asks what\nwellbeing is, and questions whether this can be captured by mental states\nonly. This objection was forcefully made by Robert Nozick (1974, 42\u201345)\nwhen he introduced the \u2018experience machine\u2019 thought experiment.\nNozick ask us to imagine that we are invited to be plugged into a\nmachine, which would stimulate our brain and make us feel as if we\nwere having a range of experiences that we could choose beforehand; all\nthe time, we would be floating in a tank with electrodes attached to our\nbrain. Would we choose such a life? Nozick claims we would not, and\ninterestingly enough the arguments he gives to justify this claim refer\nto our functionings and capabilities.12 According to Nozick, three things\nmatter to us in addition to our experiences. First, we do not only want\nto have the experience of doing certain things (which we could have by\nsitting and taking drugs) but we also want to do certain things. Second,\n\u201cwe want to be a certain way, to be a certain sort of person\u201d (Nozick\n1974, 43). Third, we don\u2019t want to limit our experiences to a man-made\nreality (the experience machine) but also to have the opportunity to be\nin contact with deeper significance. The insight from Nozick\u2019s thought\nexperiment is thus that a good life cannot be reduced to mental states, but\nmust also contain some genuine activities and states of being. According\nto Nozick (1974, 43), \u201csomeone floating in a tank is an indeterminate\nblob\u201d, not a human being to whom we can describe human wellbeing.\nThere is thus more to human wellbeing then merely feeling happy. If\ndecent labour, knowledge, appreciating art and culture, and intimate\nrelationships are to be valued only, or even primarily, because of their\ncontribution to overall or specific life satisfaction, then we could say this\nis a misrecognition of the contribution they make to how well our lives\nprogress. Phenomenologically speaking, this is an implausible account\nof wellbeing.\n12 Obviously, Nozick didn\u2019t use the terminology of the capability approach, but his\naccount of what is valuable in life could nevertheless be seen as capabilitarian. 130 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\n3.8.3 Mental adaptation and social comparisons\nHow about the worries related to empirical research and policy\nmaking? The first worry at this level is raised by processes of mental\nadaptation and social comparisons. Our satisfaction is to some extent\ninfluenced by mental adaptation issues that emerge from comparisons\nwith the situations of others. This can have problematic implications for\npublic policies aiming at the highest happiness for the greatest number.\nTake the mental adaptation processes first. How do these emerge? First\nof all, there can be shocks in our lives that have a major effect on our\nwellbeing, such as immobility after an accident. People confronted with\na major setback in health and mobility through such an impairment\nwill first experience a strong deterioration of their subjective wellbeing,\nbut after a while this effect will weaken. Obviously, this adaptation to\ncircumstances is good, since a disabled person will not remain deeply\nunhappy for the rest of her life due to her limited abilities to move around\nwithout pain. However, the question is what this implies for policy. A\nutilitarian will say that the government has to limit itself to creating\nprovisions such that a disabled person can return to an acceptable\nlevel of life satisfaction, taking into account the corresponding welfare\ncosts for others.13 A utilitarian would even say that there is no reason\nto invest in prevention if this is more expensive than rehabilitation. But\none could also argue that a cost-sensitive policy has to try to reach an\nacceptable level of functioning for a disabled person, even if this makes\nlittle difference to her subjective judgement about her wellbeing after\nadapting to the accident. Subjective indicators focus automatically on\nthe first goal, but this may imply that the quality aspects that relate to\nthe things a person still can do after the accident remain out of sight.\nSecondly, people can adapt to an objective disadvantage that is not\ncaused by an external shock, but that shows a more stable pattern. This is\nthe problem of \u2018adaptive preferences\u2019, which is particularly relevant for\n13 A more fine-grained analysis than that presented in this section would need to\nmake the distinction between act-utilitarianism and rule-utilitarianism, and ask\nwhether both are vulnerable to these critiques to the same extent. I am assuming\nhere that the critiques apply to both types of utilitarianism to such a degree that it\nleads to worrying consequences. 3. Clarifications 131\nthe happiness approach.14 Amartya Sen has pointed out repeatedly that\npeople living at the very bottom of the social ladder (such as \u2018exploited\nlabourers\u2019 or \u2018oppressed housewives\u2019) adapt to their situation and come\nto suffer less intensely. Another example is the effect of racism. If a\nsociety becomes gradually less tolerant towards cultural minorities and\nincreasingly accepts racist practices, then cultural minorities might get\nused to a racist social climate. Perhaps they will change their behaviour,\nin order to avoid contact with openly racist people. By changing their\nbehaviour and mentally preparing for racist practices, it is possible\nthat after a while the negative wellbeing effect of racism on minority\ngroups will be partially wiped out. However, a policy that anticipates\nsuch adaptation processes is morally and politically problematic: racism\nshould not be tolerated in society, even if it were not to have a significant\nimpact on the subjective wellbeing of its victims. In order to judge that\nracism is not morally permissible and hence that policies should try\nto minimize racism, we don\u2019t first need to investigate whether racism\nmakes its victims less happy: that\u2019s simply beside the point. Even if\nthe victims of racism acted stoically and didn\u2019t let racism affect their\nhappiness levels, that wouldn\u2019t make racism any less undesirable.\nAnother form of mental adaptation which is relevant for the\ngovernment is the adjustment response to income changes. Subjective\nwellbeing judgements about income have been shown to adapt\nasymmetrically to income changes. Income increases go together with\nhigher aspirations for the future, with only one third of the increase\nbeing reflected by improvements of subjective wellbeing (Frey and\nStutzer 2002). Panel-analysis over a period of ten years shows that we\nadapt strongly to an increase in income, but much less so to a drop\nin income (Burchardt 2005). Thus, if people change positions in an\nincome distribution which itself remains unchanged, then aggregate\nsatisfaction of the population will decrease. The people who move up\nthe ladder will be more satisfied for a short time, but quickly adapt to\nthe new situation, whereas people who move downwards experience a\nlarger drop in satisfaction \u2014 and this effect lasts longer as well. Tania\nBurchardt (2006) argues that due to similar phenomena of adaptation,\npeople\u2019s positions in the distribution of income, health and marital\n14 Yet the phenomenon of \u2018adaptive preferences\u2019 can also potentially create problems\nfor some capability theories, as we will analyse in section 3.9. 132 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nstatus should preferably remain immobile, according to utilitarianism.\nClearly this is a policy conclusion that goes against the principle that\npeople should receive equal opportunities, even if the effect of one\nperson\u2019s upward social mobility is not compensated by the effect of\nanother person\u2019s downward social mobility.\nHow serious are these problems of mental adaptation for the\nsubjective approach? In part, the response to this question depends on\nour normative judgements about the counter-intuitive and sometimes\nperverse implications of a policy that single-mindedly aims to promote\nmaximal average utility. It also depends, however, on the empirical\nquestion of how strong these mental adaptation processes are in reality.\nAccording to Veenhoven, overall life satisfaction is primarily determined\nby the affective component, and therefore it is much less vulnerable to\nthe effects of mental adaptation than satisfaction in particular domains,\nwhich he judges to be much more vulnerable to adaptation. However,\nthe work of Kahneman and Krueger (2006, 17\u201318) shows that mental\nadaptation processes are clearly present even when predominantly\naffective measures of overall happiness experiences are adopted.\nThere are additional concerns related to the subjective wellbeing\nfindings in particular domains, such as income or education. Recall\nthe literature reporting on the findings that subjective wellbeing is\nalso strongly influenced by social comparisons with reference groups.\nIn particular, the wellbeing effect of income, but also of education, is\naffected by the levels reached by members of the reference groups to\nwhich individuals compare their own situation. As a consequence,\nincreases in income, or additional educational credentials, contribute\nless to satisfaction in these domains, the more income or educational\nprogress is achieved within the reference groups. Apparently, these\nresources have a stronger positional component than other resources\ndo, in particular leisure time, where the comparison effect appears to\nhave a much weaker impact on wellbeing obtained from an additional\nunit of free time.\nIn conclusion, there seems to be little consensus in the subjective\nwellbeing literature on the question of whether, and to what extent,\nphenomena of mental adaptation and reference groups cause problems\nfor the measurement of overall life satisfaction. However, all researchers\ndo acknowledge that satisfaction in some domains is susceptible to 3. Clarifications 133\nthese phenomena, and this may result in the counter-intuitive policy\nimplications we mentioned earlier.\n3.8.4 Comparing groups\nThe second worry about the happiness or SWB approach concerns\nthe effect of group differences, which will be a problem if we need an\naccount of wellbeing to compare wellbeing levels between groups. The\nsubjective wellbeing approach focuses on the affective and cognitive\nresponses of people to their lives overall, or in particular domains. If\ngroups differ on average in their responses to a situation, then this\nmay cause problems for policies, if those differences correlate with the\nobjective circumstances that one would intuitively judge as important.\nThere are two symmetric possibilities: (1) groups who are in the same\nobjective situation have different levels of life satisfaction, or (2) groups\nwith the same level of life satisfaction are in different situations, whereby\nit is clear that one situation is worse than the other independently of\nsubjective wellbeing.\nResearch has indeed shown that the average level of life satisfaction\nbetween demographic groups differs systematically. In other words, if\nwe control for the relevant factors, then some groups are significantly\nless satisfied with their lives than others. For example, recent Australian\nresearch (Cummins et al. 2003) shows that women report a higher\nlevel of overall life satisfaction than men, after taking a number of\ncontrol-variables into account.15 The researchers cannot pinpoint the\nexact causes of this finding, but they do not exclude the possibility that\nwomen are \u2018constitutionally\u2019 more satisfied than men. This may have a\nbiological explanation, but it may also be the consequence of processes\nof adaptation that men and women experience differently over their\nlifetimes.\nIf the aim of the account of wellbeing is to inform public policy, then\nthe question is how government should deal with these findings. From\na utilitarian perspective, it would be efficient to develop a policy that\nis advantageous to men. For example, if due to unemployment men\nexperience a larger drop in happiness than women, as reported by Frey\n15 A similar strong and significant gender effect has been found by Eriksson, Rice and\nGoodin (2007). 134 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nand Stutzer (2002, 419), then a policy that gives men priority on the\nlabour market will minimise the average wellbeing damage in terms of\nhappiness. But the fact that one demographic group (women, the worst\noff, the elderly, and so forth) are made less unhappy due to a certain\nevent than other groups can cause perverse policy implications if life\nsatisfaction is declared to be the guideline for policies. Fundamental\npolitical principles such as non-discrimination and equality of\nopportunities for all citizens are thereby put into jeopardy. This would\nalso be true in the symmetric case where the average level of life\nsatisfaction of discriminated or marginalised groups does not differ\nsignificantly from the average level of a group that is not faced with\nthese disadvantages. I do not want to claim here that the subjective\nwellbeing approach will always lead to such injustices. But I do think\nthat a central focus on subjective wellbeing will make policies less\nsensitive to signalling and combating these injustices. Hence Burchardt\n(2005, 94) is right in pointing out that \u201csatisfaction \u2014 the best proxy\nwe have for the concept of utility \u2014 is unsuitable for assessing current\nwellbeing, justice or equality\u201d.\n3.8.5 Macro analysis\nA third worry concerns the applicability of the subjective wellbeing\napproach at the national or regional levels of policy making. One may\nagree that the happiness approach can be very helpful when it can offer\npersons with low affect (negative moods and feelings) concrete strategies\nto change that, such as engaging in mindfulness training and practice.\nYet what about policy making? Are the happiness indicators sufficiently\nrefined and sensitive for policy at lower levels of aggregation than the\nlevel of a country? In their discussion of the criteria that an index of the\nquality of life should meet, Hagerty and his co-authors (2001, 2) include\nthe criterion that the index must help policy makers to develop and\nevaluate policies at all levels of aggregation. Thus, the index should not\nonly be useful for the national government, but also for governments in\ncities, communities, and regions. As Robert van der Veen and I argued\nin earlier work, overall life satisfaction does not satisfactorily meet this\ncriterion (Robeyns and Van der Veen 2007); it is too crude for these\npurposes. It is even less suitable for the evaluation of specific policy 3. Clarifications 135\ninterventions (Cummins et al. 2003). The effect of one policy measure\nsuch as improved child care facilities will be reflected hardly or not at all\nin reported overall life satisfaction, even if such policies have significant\neffects on the real opportunities of parents to organise their lives as they\nthink best \u2014 hence on their capabilities. Overall \u2018happy life expectancy\u2019\nis, by contrast, well-suited for comparing the effects of fundamental\npolitical and economic institutions on subjective wellbeing. This\nemerges clearly from the work of Veenhoven (1996), which concentrates\non studies whereby the unit of analysis is the country. In other words,\nVeenhoven mainly uses happy life expectancy as an indicator for macro-\nanalysis. The variables that emerge as the determinants of happy life\nexpectancy are therefore typically system variables such as the degree\nof political freedom, or the presence of rule of law. But the quality\nof life in a micro-situation (say, living in a particular community or\nneighbourhood) is also influenced by many other variables.\n3.8.6 The place of happiness in the capability approach\nThe previous sections argued that happiness can\u2019t be taken to represent\na person\u2019s wellbeing for many purposes, including policy purposes. Yet\nit would also be deeply counter-intuitive to say that happiness doesn\u2019t\nmatter at all. It may be the right concept of wellbeing for other aims.\nHow, then, can happiness be given a proper place within the capability\napproach?\nThe first possibility is to see happiness, or some more specific\ncapabilities that are closely related to the affective component of\nsubjective wellbeing, as one important dimension to be selected. In fact,\nAmartya Sen has for many years argued that we could take \u2018feeling\nhappy\u2019 as one of the functionings to be selected. For example, Sen (2008,\n26) wrote:\nhappiness, however, is extremely important, since being happy is a\nmomentous achievement in itself. Happiness cannot be the only thing\nthat we have reason to value, nor the only metric for measuring other\nthings that we value, but on its own, happiness is an important human\nfunctioning. The capability to be happy is, similarly, a major aspect of\nthe freedom that we have good reason to treasure. The perspective of\nhappiness illuminates one critically important element of human living. 136 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nIndicators of happiness are already included, for example, by\nincorporating dimensions of mental health into capability applications.\nCertain specific functionings, which make up an overall \u2018mental health\u2019\nfunctioning, already contain such affective items: whether, over the\nlast week, the respondent has felt down or worthless, for example, or\nwhether one is free from worry.\nSecond, we can try to capture the cognitive aspect of happiness,\nthat is, a person\u2019s satisfaction with her capability set, or with particular\noptions from that set. We can then compare that person\u2019s level of\nsatisfaction with her capabilities, which should allow us to compare the\nobjective situation with a person\u2019s satisfaction with that situation. For\nexample, the absence of criminality is a valuable functioning.16 But there\nis a long-standing finding in criminology that there are discrepancies\nbetween the objective incidence of being safe versus the subjective\nfeeling of being in danger of becoming a victim of crime. For example,\neven if the incidence and impact of criminality goes down, it can still be\nthe case that the population is more worried about crime than before\nand feels less safe. The discrepancy between objective outcomes and\nsubjective perception is instructive here; it may imply, for example, that\nthe government should communicate more effectively about its success\nin reducing crime, so as to make the subjective perception more in line\nwith the objective reality, or it should work directly on factors that\nimpact on the subjective experience of safety feelings.\nThird, capability scholars would, of course, hope that an enlarging of\npeople\u2019s functionings and capabilities would, as a further effect, increase\ntheir feelings of happiness and satisfaction, and serve as a (sometimes\nrough) indicator of people\u2019s satisfaction with their functionings and\ncapabilities (Sen 2008, 26\u201327). Not all functionings will lead to people\nbecoming happier, yet their lives may still be better: more flourishing, or\nmore meaningful, or with a higher quality of life, or with a greater degree\nof freedom that could be realised. An interesting example is the case of\nwriting a PhD dissertation. Very few PhD students would say that this\nis what makes them happy in the sense outlined above. So why, then,\ndo so many graduates want to earn a doctoral degree, and give some of\nthe best years of their lives to what often becomes a stressful time? It is\nhard to understand this, if one doesn\u2019t take into account the meaning it\n16 Perhaps criminals would disagree. 3. Clarifications 137\nbrings to their lives. The capability approach can capture this \u2014 taking\non a difficult and challenging project such as writing a PhD dissertation\ncan plausibly be conceptualised as a general functioning (consisting of\na set of more specific functionings) that we may want to include in our\ncapability analyses, including in our capabilitarian theories of wellbeing\nfor public policies.\nI would thus defend the position that various roles for happiness are\npotentially possible within capability theories, and that it depends on\nthe exact purpose and scope of the capability theory or application, as\nwell as the aim that wellbeing plays in that capability theory, what the\nbest role (if any) for both the affective and cognitive aspects of happiness\nwould be.\n3.9 The capability approach and adaptive\npreferences\nAs we saw in the previous section, a widely-voiced reason offered\nfor rejecting the happiness approach as an account of wellbeing is the\nphenomenon of adaptive preferences, which has been widely discussed\nin the literature (e.g. Elster 1983; Sen 1985c, 3, 1992a; Nussbaum 2000;\nTeschl and Comim 2005; Burchardt 2009; Khader 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013;\nConradie and Robeyns 2013). Phenomena of mental adaption are a\nproblem if we take happiness or desire-satisfaction to be our account\nof wellbeing. Yet we also concluded in section 3.7.3 that the capability\napproach sometimes boils down to a desire-fulfilment account of\nwellbeing. Hence we need to ask: how do processes of adaptation affect\nthe desire-fulfilment view of wellbeing, and what are the implications\nfor the capability approach?\nIn the most general terms, preferences formation or adaptation is\nthe phenomenon whereby the subjective assessment of one\u2019s wellbeing\nis out of line with the objective situation. Two persons who find\nthemselves in the same objective situation will have a very different\nsubjective assessment, because one is happy with small amounts of\n\u2018objective goods\u2019, whereas the other is much more demanding. In the\ncapability literature, the general concern is with deprived persons\nwho, over time, adapt to their objectively poor circumstances, and\nreport a level of subjective wellbeing which is higher than the objective\ncircumstances warrant. 138 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nThe idea of adaptation can take different forms. Jon Elster (1983)\nreferred to one particular type of adaptation, in which being unable\nto fulfil a preference or realise an aspiration leads one to reject that\npreference or aspiration. This phenomenon is known as \u2018sour grapes\u2019:\nthe fox who cannot pick the grapes, because they are hanging too\nhigh for him, starts telling himself that they are sour anyway, and no\nlonger desires to eat them. On Elster\u2019s account, adaptation occurs at\na non-conscious level, as a reaction to the painful process of cognitive\ndissonance that a person who can\u2019t fulfil her unreachable desires or\naspirations feels. Elster\u2019s notion of adaptive preferences only refers to\na process, and makes no reference to an objective notion of wellbeing.\nThese psychological aspects of adaptation are echoed in Sen\u2019s reference\nto this phenomenon, when he writes that \u201cconsiderations of \u2018feasibility\u2019\nand of \u2018practical possibility\u2019 enter into what we dare to desire and what\nwe are pained not to get\u201d (Sen 1985a, 15). Adaptive preferences are\na reason for Sen to reject a focus on mental metrics, such as utility or\nhappiness, as the metric of wellbeing. After all, someone who is in an\nobjectively dire situation may have adapted to that situation and learnt\nto be pleased with little. As Sen (1985c, 21) puts it, \u201cA person who is\nill-fed, undernourished, unsheltered and ill can still be high up in the\nscale of happiness or desire-fulfilment if he or she has learned to have\n\u2018realistic\u2019 desires and to take pleasure in small mercies\u201d.\nSerene Khader (2011) has argued that not all cases that we tend to\nconsider as cases of adaptive preferences fit Elster\u2019s conceptualisation.\nKhader believes that an account of adaptive preferences must make\nreference to an objective notion of flourishing, even if that notion\nremains vague and only focusses on basic flourishing (since there is\nmore intercultural agreement on what basic flourishing entails). She\ndevelops the following definition:\nAn adaptive preference is a preference that (1) is inconsistent with a\nperson\u2019s basic flourishing, (2) was formed under conditions nonconducive\nto her basic flourishing, and (3) that we do not think a person would\nhave formed under conditions conductive to basic flourishing. (Khader\n2011, 51)\nA similarly perfectionist, but much less systematically developed\naccount of adaptive preferences can be found in Martha Nussbaum\u2019s 3. Clarifications 139\nwork. She understands adaptive preferences as the preferences of\npeople who do not want to have items of her list of capabilities, whereby\nthese preferences are deformed due to injustices, oppression, ignorance\nand unreflective habit (Nussbaum 2000, 114).\nWhat questions do adaptive preferences raise for the capability\napproach? At the very minimum, they raise the following questions:\nfirst, why would adaptive preferences pose a problem for capability\ntheories? Second, do we have any evidence about the prevalence of\nadaptive preferences? And third, how can capability scholars deal with\nadaptive preferences in their capability theories and applications?\nLet us start with the first of these questions: why would adaptive\npreferences pose a problem for capability theories? There are at least\ntwo reasons. The first lies in module B2, the selection of dimensions. If\nthat selection is done in a participatory or democratic way, then it may\nbe vulnerable to adaptive preferences. A group that is systematically\nsocialised to have low aspirations and ambitions will perhaps not put\ncertain capabilities on its list, thereby telling themselves that they are\nunachievable, whereas objectively speaking they are achievable, albeit\nperhaps only after some social changes have taken place. The second\nreason is that a person with adaptive preferences may objectively have\naccess to a certain capability, but may believe that either this capability\nis not available to her, or else that she should not choose it, and hence\nshe may pick from her capabilities set a suboptimal combination of\nfunctionings. If we then assume that this person (or group) has non-\nadaptive preferences, then we will wrongly interpret the choice not\nto exercise certain capabilities as a matter of personal agency, which a\ncapability theory that focusses on capabilities rather than functionings,\nshould respect. The capability approach by default regards adults as\nagents rather than patients, but this may be problematic in the case of\nadaptive preferences.\nSo we can conclude that adaptive preferences can pose a problem for\ncapability theories in which the choice of dimensions is made democratic,\nor in which we focus on capabilities rather than functionings. But a critic\nmay raise the question: do we have any evidence about the prevalence\nof adaptive preferences? Is this not a theoretical problem invented by\nphilosophers who like complex puzzles, or by western scholars who\npity the lives of poor people in the Global South? 140 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nThere are at least two answers to be given to this question. The\nfirst is that there are indeed good reasons to be very careful with the\nconclusions we draw when studying adaptive preferences, especially\nin a context with which one is not familiar. Serene Khader (2011,\n55\u201360) provides a nuanced and convincing discussion of the various\nmistakes that can be made when we try to identify whether a person\nor group of persons living under unjust conditions expresses adaptive\npreferences. There are at least three \u2018occupational hazards\u2019 that those\ntrying to identify adaptive preferences may make: we run the risk of\npsychologizing structural constraints, of misidentifying possible trade-\noffs between various dimensions of wellbeing that a person makes, or\nwe may be unable to recognise forms of flourishing in very different\nculture or class settings. All this shows that thinking about adaptive\npreferences needs to be done with great attention to contextual details\nand in a very careful manner; it is not an analysis that can easily be\ndone by applying a rigid formula. Scholars should therefore be very\ncautious before concluding that someone or a group shows adaptive\npreferences, and carefully investigate alternative interpretations of\nwhat they observe, since otherwise they run the risk of seeing adaptive\npreferences where there are none.\nHaving said this, it is clear from the literature that adaptive preferences\nare a genuine phenomenon. For example, Serene Khader (2011)\ndiscusses real cases of groups of women who had adaptive preferences.\nTania Burchardt analysed the 1970 British Cohort Study and found that\n\u201camong those able to formulate agency goals, the aspirations expressed\nare conditioned by their socio-economic background and experience\u201d\n(Burchardt 2009, 13). She also found evidence that adaptation may play\na role in the selection of functionings from one\u2019s capability set, since\namong the sixteen-year-olds who have the capability to continue full-\ntime education, the choice whether or not to do so is highly influenced\nby past deprivation and experiences of inequality. Burchardt rightly\nconcludes that if the influence on people\u2019s choices is so systematically\nrelated to previous experiences of disadvantage, that this is a case of\ninjustice. Hence the need, for capability theorists and not just for those\nendorsing the happiness approach or the desire-fulfilment theory\nof wellbeing, to take processes of adapted preferences and adapted\naspirations seriously. On the other hand, as David Clark (2009, 32)\nargued in the context of development studies, adaptive preferences may 3. Clarifications 141\nnot be as widespread as some capability theorists make it out to be: \u201cthe\navailable evidence only provides limited support for the adaptation\nargument and is not always easy to interpret\u201d. Given the \u201coccupational\nhazards\u201d that those trying to identify adaptive preferences face (Khader\n2011, 55\u201360), it is important not to \u2018see\u2019 adaptive preferences where\nthere are none. In conclusion, the capability scholar will have to balance\nthe tricky tasks of neither ignoring processes of adaption, nor making\nthe adaptation problem bigger than it really is.\nThis brings us to the last question: can the capability approach deal\nwith these issues? Given that capability theories and applications can\nbe very diverse, we will need different methods to handle the issue of\nadaptive preferences for different capability theories and applications.\nIn the context of action-research, small-scale projects and grassroots\nstrategies, what is required above all is deliberation and interaction with\npeople of whom one may be worried that their preferences may show\nsigns of adaption, as exemplified by Ina Conradie in her project with\nwomen in a South African township (Conradie 2013; Conradie and\nRobeyns 2013). Khader (2011) has developed \u2018a deliberative perfectionist\napproach to adaptive preference intervention\u2019, in which a practitioner\nwho suspects that a group of people has adaptive preferences will first\nattempt to understand how the suspected preferences affect their basic\nflourishing. This must be done via deliberative processes \u2014 a strategy\nthat we also see in Conradie\u2019s research. If the practitioner has good\nreasons to suspect that some of the preferences are adapted, she can\ninvolve those with the alleged adaptive preference in a discussion and\ntogether search for a strategy for change. Note that there is an interesting\nparallel here with the grassroots-based development model that has\nbeen proposed by Solava Ibrahim (2017), in which \u2018a conscientization\nprocess\u2019 is an integral part of the development process. In this process,\na person reflects critically on her life, develops aspirations for better\nliving conditions, and makes a plan of action to bring about the\ndesired change (Ibrahim 2017, 206). While, as Ibrahim rightly notes,\nadaptive preferences and aspirations may provide a challenge for this\nconscientization process, they are also very likely to be challenged and\nhence changed via such a process.\nWhat about capability applications that involve the empirical analysis\nof large-scale datasets? How can adaptation be dealt with in those\napplications? Here, the capability approach needs to use insights from 142 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nthe disciplines that have built most expertise in large-scale adaptation\nprocesses, such as sociology and social policy studies. Based on the\ninsights from those disciplines, we know the likely candidates to be\ndimensions of adaptation \u2014 such as social class, caste or gender. We can\nthen use indicators of those dimensions to study whether preferences\nand aspirations systematically differ, as in the earlier mentioned study\nby Tania Burchardt (2009). But it is clear that this can only help us to\nidentify adapted preferences or adapted aspirations; it will not always\ntell us whether for each application it is possible to \u2018launder\u2019 the data so\nas to clean them from processes of unjust adaptations.\n3.10 Can the capability approach be an\nexplanatory theory?\nIn almost all capability applications and theories, the capability\napproach is developed for conceptual and normative purposes, rather\nthan for explanations. If it is used for conceptual work, then capability\ntheories do not explain poverty, inequality, or wellbeing, but rather\nhelp us to conceptualize these notions. If capability analyses are used\nfor normative work, then they help to evaluate states of affairs and\nprescribe recommendations for intervention and change.\nNevertheless, the notions of functionings and capabilities in\nthemselves can be employed as elements in explanations of social\nphenomena, or one can use these notions in descriptions of poverty,\ninequality, quality of life and social change. In those cases, the\nproperties A1 to A4 from module A would still hold, but characteristics\nA5 (functionings and capabilities as the evaluative space), A6 (other\ndimensions of intrinsic values can be important for normative analyses)\nand A7 (normative individualism) are not applicable.\nTo the best of my knowledge, few scholars use the capability\napproach in this way. Probably this should not be surprising, since the\ncapability approach may not make a significant difference to this type of\nwork. Still, there are parallels with existing studies. For example, there\nis a large literature on the social determinants of health (e.g. Marmot\n2005; Wilkinson and Marmot 2003; Marmot et al. 2008). The goal here\nis to establish a set of functionings related to the general functioning\nof being healthy, and the determinants are investigated so that social 3. Clarifications 143\ninterventions are possible. The same is done for other functionings \u2014 not\nsurprisingly, since explaining the determinants of valuable social states\nis one of the main aims of social scientists.\nThis raises the question of whether the capability approach should\naspire to do this kind of explanatory capabilitarian analysis. The answer\ndepends on a further question: whether the capability approach would\nhave any added value in conducting explanatory capability analyses. If\nnot, then it is unclear why this should be part of the capability approach,\nsince there seems to be very little value in doing what others are already\ndoing successfully.\nBut this pessimistic dismissal of the potential of explanatory\ncapability analyses may be too quick. Perhaps the capability approach\nhas a role to play in synthesising and connecting these field-specific\nlines of explanatory research; since it is a strongly interdisciplinary\napproach, it may perhaps also have a role to play in bringing different\ndisciplines within the social and behavioural sciences together. Another\nvery important task of the capability approach is to reach out to those\ndisciplines in order to make bridges between the normative and\nthe explanatory analyses \u2014 one valuable element of the truly post-\ndisciplinary agenda to which the capability approach aims to contribute.\n3.11 A suitable theory for all normative questions?\nThe capability approach is primarily a normative theory, but are there\nalso restrictions on which normative questions it can help to address?\nOr is it suitable for all normative questions?\nIn order to answer this, it is helpful to remind us of the key distinction\nin philosophical ethics between the right and the good. Questions about\nthe good focus on what makes life valuable and include discussions\nabout wellbeing, autonomy, freedom, and love. Questions about the\nright focus on how we should act in order for that action to be morally\nsound, as well as discussions about how institutions and policies should\nbe designed so as not to violate universal moral rules. Here, the central\nissues concern fairness, respect and the avoidance of harm. Different\nmoral theories give different answers to the question of how the good\nand the right relate to each other. 144 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nIn philosophical ethics, if we say that an issue is a moral issue, this\nimplies that we have duties to comply with the moral norm, no matter\nhow we feel about it. These are very stringent and universal duties.\nAn example is: do not kill an innocent person; or: respect the human\ndignity of all persons. Normative questions are much broader, and can\nalso entail other values, such as prudential value (wellbeing). Questions\nabout the right are questions about morality, whereas for most ethical\nframeworks questions about the good are questions about other areas of\nnormativity, but not morality straight.17\nThe modular view that has been presented in chapter 2 has in the\ncore module A only normative properties related to the good. Properties\nA1 and A2 define functionings and capabilities, and property A5 claims\nthat a person\u2019s advantage should focus on functionings and capabilities:\nthis gives the capability approach the core of its theory of the good. The\ncomplete theory of the good may be extended by additional choices\nmade in module C4.\nWhat does the core of the capability approach (module A) have to\nsay about the right? The only property related to the right is normative\nindividualism. There are no additional claims related to the right\nincluded in module A. Hence, the only conclusion we can draw is that\nthe capability approach would claim that, if and whenever rightness\ninvolves a notion of the good, one should use the theory of the good as\nentailed by the core characteristics of the capability approach. Hence,\nif we believe that the right thing to do is to prioritise the lives of the\nworst-off, then a capabilitarian version of this claim would say that we\nshould prioritise the functionings and/or capabilities of the worst-off\nrather than their happiness or their command over resources.\nYet many claims concerning the right make no reference to an\naccount of the good. The core of the capabilities approach is, thus,\northogonal to other aspects of the theory of the right, except for ethical\nindividualism, which is only a very small part of a theory of the right.\nThe fact that the capability approach has, at its very core, more to offer\nin terms of the theory of the good than in terms of the theory of the\nright has an important implication, namely that the capability approach is\n17 An influential exception are utilitarians and other consequentialists, who define the\nmorally right as that which maximizes the (non-moral) good (Driver 2014; Sinnott-\nArmstrong 2015). 3. Clarifications 145\nnot very suitable for ethical issues that only concern questions about the right.\nFor example, the capability approach is not a very helpful theory when\nanalysing the morality of abortion since so much of that ethical debate\nis about issues of the right rather than about issues of the good. That is,\nmost of the philosophical debates on the ethics of abortion concern the\nmoral status of the foetus, notions of personhood, or questions about\nthe autonomy and self-ownership of the pregnant woman \u2014 issues\non which the capability approach remains mute.18 It is therefore not\nsurprising that the capability approach is more useful and more widely\nused as a theory analysing socio-economic policies where there is a\nconsensus on those aspects that are questions about the right or where\nthe questions about the right are much less weighty than those about the\ngood. Examples include debates about poverty alleviation, distributive\njustice, environmental ethics and disability ethics. In sum, the capability\napproach is not a very helpful (or the most illuminating) framework for\nnormative analyses in which elements regarding deontological duties\nand rights, which are not conceptually closely related to notions of\nwellbeing, play the most important role \u2014 that is, where aspects of the\nright are crucial in addressing the normative questions.\n3.12 The role of resources\nin the capability approach\nIn section 2.6.4 we discussed property A4, which stresses the importance\nof the difference between means and ends in the capabilities approach.\nIn section 2.6.5, we discussed property A5, which claims that in the\ncapability approach functionings and capabilities form the evaluative\nspace. From these two core properties from module A, some may draw\nthe conclusion that resources are no longer important in the capability\napproach. This is a mistake. Resources are important, although in an\ninstrumental manner.\nFirstly, a focus on functionings and capabilities does not necessarily\nimply that a capability analysis would not pay any attention to resources,\n18 Philosophical arguments on the moral permissibility of abortion come to widely\ndivergent conclusions (e.g. Thomson 1971; Tooley 1972; English 1975; Marquis\n1989). 146 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nor to the evaluation of social institutions, economic growth, technical\nadvancement, and so forth. While functionings and capabilities are of\nultimate concern, other dimensions can be important as well, but in\nan instrumental way, or as indicators for what ultimately matters. For\nexample, in their evaluation of development in India, Dr\u00e8ze and Sen\nhave stressed that working within the capability approach in no way\nexcludes the integration of an analysis of resources:\nIt should be clear that we have tended to judge development by the\nexpansion of substantive human freedoms \u2014 not just by economic\ngrowth (for example, of the gross national product), or technical progress,\nor social modernization. This is not to deny, in any way, that advances in\nthe latter fields can be very important, depending on circumstances, as\n\u2018instruments\u2019 for the enhancement of human freedom. But they have to\nbe appraised precisely in that light \u2014 in terms of their actual effectiveness\nin enriching the lives and liberties of people \u2014 rather than taking them\nto be valuable in themselves. (Dr\u00e8ze and Sen 2002, 3)\nSecond, once we have decided which capabilities are relevant, we need\nto investigate the determinants of those capabilities \u2014 the factors which\naffect their emergence, size and robustness. As figure 2.1 illustrates,\nthese determinants include resources, a person\u2019s set of conversion\nfactors and structural constraints. Hence if we want to expand the\ncapabilities of a person or a group, these are the levels at which we\ncould intervene. Resources are not the only things that matter, and for\nsome capabilities that we try to expand or try to equalise, resources\nmay not be the most effective factor of intervention. At the same time,\nit is also clear that resources are very important for most capabilities\nand there are hardly any capabilities where resources play no role at\nall. Being able to buy presents enhances the capability of affiliation and\nsocial interaction; being able to get the best medical care enhances the\ncapability of health; and being able to afford time off and time to travel\nenhances the capability to enjoy nature. Hence even those capabilities\nthat could be seen as non-material dimensions of advantage are\nnevertheless also aided by the availability of resources, albeit probably\nnot in a linear way, and perhaps only up to a certain threshold level. If\na capability analysis is aimed at making an intervention, then the exact\nrelationship between resources and functionings needs to be studied\nfor each capability analysis, rather than being assumed to have a\ncertain shape. 3. Clarifications 147\nThird, in empirical research there are often data constraints that force\nscholars to work with resources as proxies for valuable functionings.\nThere is nothing inconsistent in taking that path, as long as one is\ncareful in the conclusions that one draws from an analysis of resources.\nMoreover, if one uses multiple resources, such as a combination of\nincome, time, and human and social capital (e.g. Burchardt 2010), then\nthe informational riches of the analysis increases, compared to a one-\ndimensional monetary analysis.\n3.13 The capability approach\nand theories of justice\nDiscussions about inequality and justice are very important within\nthe capability literature. In fact, they are so important that many\nphilosophers studying the capability approach have made the mistake\nof believing that it is a theory of equality, or a theory of justice. But as\nthe descriptions of the capability approach in chapter 2 have shown,\nthat is not the case. Here, too, we need to make use of the distinction\nbetween the general capability approach and more specific capability\ntheories: theorizing justice is only one among many different purposes\nthat capability theories can have, that is, one of the possible choices we\ncan make in module B1.19 Still, given that the capability approach offers\na distinct view on interpersonal comparisons of advantage, it should\nnot surprise us that the capability approach has been widely used in\nthinking about inequality and justice.\nThe literature that develops the relevance of the capability approach\nin theories of justice falls primarily within the domain of normative\npolitical philosophy, but there is some overlap with the work done by\nwelfare economists and other scholars. In order to get a grip on what\nthe capability approach does in the literature on distributive justice, or,\nvice versa, what thinking goes on about theories of distributive justice\nwithin the capability literature, let us start with a brief primer on the\ntheoretical literature on justice in the next section. Then, in section\n3.13.2, I pose the question of what is required for the construction of a\ncomplete capability theory of justice. The final section, 3.13.3, explores\nthe implications of a capability-based approach to justice in practice.\n19 In particular, see the overview of different types of capability study in section 2.4. 148 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\n3.13.1 A brief description of the literature\non theories of justice\nJustice is an essentially contested concept: there is no generally accepted\ndefinition of justice, and thus no consensus on what the appropriate\nsubject matter of theories of justice is or should be. Of course, it does not\nfollow that nothing at all can be said about the notion of justice. David\nMiller\u2019s description of social justice is a good starting point. He claims\nthat when arguing about justice, we are discussing:\nhow the good and bad things in life should be distributed among the\nmembers of a human society. When, more concretely, we attack some\npolicy or some state of affairs as socially unjust, we are claiming that a\nperson, or more usually a category of persons, enjoys fewer advantages\nthan that person or group of persons ought to enjoy (or bears more of\nthe burdens than they ought to bear), given how other members of the\nsociety in question are faring. (Miller 1999, 1)\nTheories of justice do not cover the entire spectrum of moral issues.\nSocial justice theorists generally agree that parts of morality fall outside\nthe scope of justice. Charity is such a case: you may not have a duty\nof justice to help a frail, elderly neighbour, but you may nevertheless\ndecide to help that person as an act of charity and compassion. Another\nexample is morally laudable behaviour, such as being a volunteer for\nsocial activities in your neighbourhood. Such behaviour may be morally\npraiseworthy, but it may at the same time not be required as a matter of\njustice. Hence, justice is not all that matters, if we consider how to make\nthe world morally better.\nCan we describe justice, and theories of justice, by their properties, as\nphilosophers often do? First, justice is a property that has been ascribed\nto both individuals and institutions: justice is a virtue of individuals\nin their interactions with others, and justice is also a virtue of social\ninstitutions (Barry and Matravers 2011). Thus, we can say that a certain\nsociety is more or less just, or we can say that the behaviour of some\npersons is just or unjust. Theorists of justice tend primarily to discuss\nthe justice of social arrangements, that is, of social institutions broadly\ndefined; justice as an individual virtue is sometimes regarded as a\nmatter of ethics rather than of political philosophy (although not every\npolitical philosopher would agree with this way of demarcating justice 3. Clarifications 149\nfrom ethics). Moreover, an increasing number of theorists define social\ninstitutions more broadly so as to include societal structures related to\nclass or caste, as well as social norms; under such broad definitions,\nconceptualising justice as a virtue of institutions touches upon many of\nthe same aspects we would discuss if we were to see justice as a virtue of\npersons. For example, if a society has widely shared racist social norms,\nsuch as the disapproval of interracial love relationships, then a person\nwho shows her disapproval of an interracial love relationship is acting\nupon an unjust social norm, but also showing non-virtuous behaviour.\nSecond, while sometimes the terms \u2018social justice\u2019 and \u2018distributive\njustice\u2019 are used as synonyms, it makes sense to understand \u2018social\njustice\u2019 as somewhat broader than \u2018distributive justice\u2019. Distributive\njustice always deals with an analysis of who gets what, whereas social\njustice may also relate to questions of respect or recognition, or the\nattitudes that a certain institution expresses. The capability approach\nis mainly discussed in theories of distributive justice, although it is to\nsome extent able to integrate the concerns of theorists of recognition\nabout what they conceive to be the narrow or mistaken focus of theories\nof distributive justice.20\nA third point to note about the literature on justice is that there\nare several different schools within social justice theories. According\nto Brian Barry and Matt Matravers, it is helpful to classify theories\nof social justice according to four types: conventionalism, teleology,\njustice as mutual advantage and egalitarian justice. Conventionalism is\nthe view that issues of justice can be resolved by examining how local\nconventions, institutions, traditions and systems of law determine the\ndivisions of burdens and benefits. Barry and Matravers rightly point out\nthat this approach, which has been defended by Michael Walzer (1983),\ncan lead to the acceptance of grossly unjust practices because they are\ngenerally endorsed by certain communities, even if they may be seen as\nunjust if judged on the basis of values and ideas not currently present (or\ndominant) in that society. Teleology is the view that social arrangements\nshould be justified by referring to some good they are aiming for. Some\nexamples are utilitarianism, natural law theory or Aquinas\u2019 Christian\n20 It doesn\u2019t follow that all concerns of theorists of recognition are best expressed by\nusing the capability approach. I doubt that this is the case, but will not pursue this\nissue here further. 150 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nphilosophy. For teleological theories, what justice is follows from an\naccount of the good, and thus the account of justice depends on the\naccount of the social good itself. A criticism of teleological theories is that\nthey necessarily rely on an external source (to specify what \u2018the good\u2019 is),\nsuch as utility, the natural law or God\u2019s authority. Teleological accounts\nof justice therefore necessarily depend on notions of the ultimate good.\nHowever, in pluralistic societies characterised by a variety of religious\nand non-religious worldviews, it is hard to see how justice can be\nderived from notions of the good that are not endorsed by all. Many\ncontemporary political philosophers therefore argue that teleological\ntheories cannot be defended since people have competing ideas of the\ngood, and we cannot call upon a generally-accepted external source that\nwill tell us which idea of the good should be imposed on all.\nThe third and fourth schools of social justice, in comparison, share a\ncommitment to some form of liberalism that recognizes the diversity of\nviews of the good life, which a just society should respect. These schools\nexperienced a major revival after the publication of John Rawls\u2019s A\nTheory of Justice in 1971, which is generally regarded as the single most\nimportant work on social justice written in the last century.21 Rawls\nturned to the social contract tradition, in which justice is understood as\nthe fair distribution of benefits of social cooperation. The core idea is\nthat rules of justice are ultimately more beneficial to everyone than if\neach were to pursue their own advantage by themselves. Some of these\ntheories (though not Rawls\u2019s!) take the relative power or bargaining\nstrength of every individual in society as given, and one may therefore\nquestion whether in situations of unequal bargaining power, justice\nwill be done (Nussbaum 2006b). The other liberal school of justice is\negalitarian justice, which is premised on the idea that people should be\ntreated with equal respect and concern (Dworkin 2000). The most basic\nclaim of those theories is that people are morally equal: each person\nshould be treated as a being of equal moral worth. However, that\n21 There is a large literature on the differences and complementarities between the\ncapability approach to justice (that is, capabilitarian theories of justice) and Rawls\u2019s\ntheory of justice (see e.g. Sen 1980, 195\u2013200; Rawls 1988; Sen 1992a, 82\u201383; Pogge\n2002; Nussbaum 2006b; Robeyns 2008b, 2009; and the contributions to Brighouse\nand Robeyns 2010). 3. Clarifications 151\ngeneral and abstract claim can be further developed in many different\nways, and it is in specifying these further details that philosophers\ndisagree. Distributive justice requires equality of something, but not\nnecessarily equality of outcome in material terms (in fact, plain equality\nof resources is a claim very few theorists of justice would be willing\nto defend, since people have different needs, are confronted with\ndifferent circumstances and, if given the same opportunities, are likely\nto make different use of them). Hence, Rawls\u2019s theory of justice can be\nseen as an egalitarian theory of justice, but so are theories that come to\nvery different substantive conclusions, such as Robert Nozick\u2019s (1974)\nentitlement theory. Other major contemporary theorists of justice who\ncan be labelled \u2018liberal egalitarian\u2019 are Brian Barry (1995), Philippe Van\nParijs (1995), and Ronald Dworkin (2000), among many others.\nOf those four schools, it is primarily liberal egalitarian theories that are\ndiscussed in relation to the capability approach. While there is internal\ndiversity within this group of liberal egalitarian theories, these theories\nshare the commitment to the principle that there should be considerable\n(although by no means absolute) scope for individuals to determine\ntheir own life plan and notion of the good, as well as a commitment\nto a notion of equal moral consideration, which is another way to put\nthe principle of each person as an end, or normative individualism (see\nsection 2.6.8).\nOf the four schools of social justice, only the last two regard justice\nand equality as being closely related values. Under conventionalism,\njustice is guided by existing traditions, conventions and institutions,\neven if those existing practices do not treat people as equals in a\nplausible sense. Teleological theories also do not understand justice\nas entailing some notion of equality; instead, the idea of the good is\nmore important, even if it implies that people are not treated as moral\nequals. In some theories of conventionalism and teleology, social justice\ncould be consistent with a notion of equality, but this is not necessarily\nthe case for all these theories. The social contract tradition and liberal\negalitarianism, in contrast, derive their principles of social justice from\na fundamental idea of people as moral equals. However, the notion of\nequal moral worth does not necessarily lead to the notion of equality of\nresources or another type of equality of outcome, as will be explained 152 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nin what follows. Social justice and equality are related in these theories,\nbut not always at the level of material inequality, but rather at a more\nfundamental level of treating people as moral equals or with equal\nrespect and concern.\nFor a proper understanding of mainstream philosophical literature\non theories of justice, it is helpful to know that the literature itself is\nhighly abstract, and often rather detached from questions about policy\ndesign or political feasibility. Sen (2006, 2009c) has recently criticised\nsuch theories, and in particular Rawls\u2019s work, for being overly\n\u201ctranscendental\u201d. Such ideal theories give an account of the perfectly\njust society, but do not tell us what needs to be done to get closer to\nthat very ideal, how we can make the world less unjust and which of\ntwo situations might be more unjust than the other. Another critique of\ncontemporary theories of justice is that they are often based on so-called\nidealisations or strong assumptions, which may introduce significant\nbiases or exclude certain groups of people from the theory. For example,\nDworkin (2000) sets his egalitarian theory against a set of background\nassumptions that rule out racist and sexist attitudes and behaviours,\nas well as the adaptation of preferences to unfair circumstances (Pierik\nand Robeyns 2007). Certain assumptions and meta-theoretical as well\nas methodological choices also put philosophical theories of justice at\nrisk of being too far removed from practical applicability. When we\ntry to apply contemporary theories of justice to the actual reality of\nour chaotic and often messy world, there are all sorts of complications\nthat need to be taken into account, such as trade-offs between different\nvalues, power imbalances between different social groups, unintended\nconsequences of justice-enhancing interventions and policies, or interests\nof individuals and groups that may conflict with concerns for justice\n(e.g. a desire for re-election on the part of government administrations).\nDebates about the practical relevance of contemporary philosophical\ntheories of justice have gained momentum in the last decade. It remains\nunclear whether the outcome will change the way theories of justice are\nconstructed in the future. It may well be that we will see a turn towards\nmore non-ideal, empirically-informed, \u2018directly useful\u2019 theories that are\neasier to translate into practice. In any case, it is fair to say that most\ncapability theorists working on justice are among those who strongly\nadvocate this turn to make theories of justice more relevant to practice. 3. Clarifications 153\n3.13.2 What do we need for a capability theory of justice?\nIn the previous section I gave a very brief account of the philosophical\nliterature on theories of justice. What contribution can the capability\napproach make to this field? The first thing to note is that Martha\nNussbaum has written at great length developing a capabilities theory\nof justice (e.g. Nussbaum 1988, 1992, Nussbaum 2000, 2002a; Nussbaum\n2006b). Her capabilities theory is the most detailed capability theory of\njustice that has been developed up till now. Her theory is comprehensive,\nin the sense that it is not limited to an account of political justice, or to\nliberal democracies. Her account holds for all human beings on earth,\nindependently of whether they are living in a liberal democratic regime,\nor of whether they are severely disabled. However, Nussbaum\u2019s theory\nof social justice doesn\u2019t amount to a full theory of social justice. The\nmain demarcation of Nussbaum\u2019s account is that it provides only \u201ca\npartial and minimal account of social justice\u201d (Nussbaum 2006b, 71)\nby specifying thresholds of a list of capabilities that governments in all\nnations should guarantee to their citizens. Nussbaum\u2019s theory focuses\non thresholds, but this does not imply that reaching these thresholds is\nall that matters for social justice; rather, her theory is partial and simply\ndoesn\u2019t discuss the question of what social justice requires once those\nthresholds are met. Not discussing certain things is not necessarily a\nflaw of a theory: this may be theoretical work that Nussbaum will do\nin the future, or it may be work that will be done by other scholars.\nMoreover, it is quite possible that Nussbaum\u2019s account of partial justice\nis consistent with several accounts of what justice requires above the\nthresholds.\nYet, while Nussbaum\u2019s theory of justice has been worked out in\ngreat detail and has received a lot of attention, it would be a grave\nmistake to think that there can be only one capability theory of justice.\nOn the contrary, the open nature of the capability framework allows\nfor the development of a family of capability theories of justice. This\nthen prompts the question: what is needed if we want to create such a\ncapability theory of justice?22\n22 I have presented this overview of steps that need to be taken in earlier publications\n(e.g. Robeyns 2016d). 154 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nFirst, a theory of justice needs to explain on what basis it justifies\nits principles or claims of justice. For example, Rawls uses the method\nof reflective equilibrium, including the thought experiment of the\noriginal position.23 Dworkin\u2019s egalitarian justice theory starts from the\nmeta-principle of equal respect and concern, which he then develops in\nthe principles that the distribution of burdens and benefits should be\nsensitive to the ambitions that people have but should not reflect the\nunequal natural endowments with which individuals are born (Dworkin\n1981, 2000). One could also develop a capability theory of justice arguing\nthat the ultimate driving force is a concern with agency (Claassen and\nD\u00fcwell 2013; Claassen 2016) or with human dignity (Nussbaum 2000;\nNussbaum 2006b). If capability scholars want to develop a full theory\nof justice, they will also need to explain on what bases they justify their\nprinciples or claims. As mentioned earlier, Nussbaum starts from a\nnotion of human dignity, whereas the Senian strand in the capability\napproach stresses the importance of what people have reason to value,\nhence an account of public reasoning. However, little work has been\ndone so far to flesh out this embryonic idea of \u2018having reason to value\u2019,\nand it therefore remains unclear whether the capability approach has\na solid unified rationale on the basis of which a full account of justice\ncould be developed.\nSecond, as indicated above, in developing a capability theory of\njustice we must decide whether we want it to be an outcome or an\nopportunity theory; that is, whether we think that we should assess\ninjustices in terms of functionings, or rather in terms of capabilities,\nor a mixture. At the level of theory and principles, most theorists of\njustice endorse the view that justice is done if all have equal genuine\nopportunities, or if all reach a minimal threshold of capability levels.\nTranslated to the capability language, this would imply that at the level\nof theory and principles, capabilities are the relevant metric of justice,\nand not functionings. However, among theorists of justice, not everyone\nsubscribes to this view. Anne Phillips (2004) has been a prominent\nvoice arguing for equality of outcome, rather than opportunities. In\nthe capability literature, Marc Fleurbaey (2002) has argued against an\napproach that takes only capabilities into account and has defended a\n23 An accessible explanation of the method of reflective equilibrium can be found in\nKnight (2017). 3. Clarifications 155\nfocus on \u2018refined functionings\u2019 (being the combination of functionings\nand capabilities).\nA third issue which needs to be solved if one hopes to develop a\ncapability theory of justice is to decide and justify which capabilities\nmatter the most. There are at least two ways of answering this question:\neither through procedural approaches, such as using criteria from\nwhich the relevant capabilities are derived, or by defending a specific\nlist of capabilities. This selection of relevant capabilities for the purpose\nof justice can be done at the level of ideal theory (without taking issues\nof practical feasibility and implementation into account), at the level of\nabstract principles (Anderson 1999; Nussbaum 2006b; Claassen 2016) or\nat an applied theoretical level, which is useful for practical assessments\nof unjust inequalities (e.g. Robeyns 2003; Wolff and De-Shalit 2007).\nFourth, a capability theory of justice may need to engage in a\ncomparison with other \u2018metrics of justice\u2019. In the literature on social\njustice there are several terms used to indicate what precisely we are\nassessing or measuring: the metric of advantage, the currency of justice,\nor the informational basis for the interpersonal comparisons for the\npurpose of justice. Within theories of justice, the main arguments are with\nRawlsian resourcists24 and with defenders of Dworkinian resourcism.25\nOther possible metrics are basic needs or the many different types of\nsubjective welfare or preference satisfaction. A full capability theory of\njustice would need to show why it serves better as a metric of justice\nthan these other metrics.\nFifth, a capability theory of justice needs to take a position on the\n\u201cdistributive rule\u201d (Anderson 2010, 81) that it will endorse: will it argue\nfor plain equality, or for sufficiency, or for prioritarianism, or for some\nother (mixed) distributive rule? Both Martha Nussbaum\u2019s and Elizabeth\nAnderson\u2019s theories are sufficiency accounts, but from this it does not\nfollow, as one sometimes reads in the secondary literature, that the\ncapability approach entails a sufficiency rule. Sen may have given the\n(wrong) impression of defending straight equality as a distributive rule,\n24 An analysis of this comparison between social primary goods and capabilities was\nmade by the various contributions to the volume edited by Brighouse and Robeyns\n(2010).\n25 For comparisons of the capability view with Dworkin\u2019s egalitarian theory, see Sen\n(1984b, 321\u201323, 2009c, 264\u201368); Dworkin (2000, 299\u2013303); Williams (2002); Browne\nand Stears (2005); Kaufman (2006); Pierik and Robeyns (2007). 156 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nby asking the question \u201cEquality of what?\u201d (Sen 1980), though a careful\nreading shows that he was merely asking the question \u201cIf we want to\nbe defending equality of something, then what would that be?\u201d In fact,\nSen has remained uncommitted to one single distributive rule, which\nprobably can be explained by the fact that he is averse to building a well-\ndefined theory of justice but rather prefers to investigate how real-life\nunjust situations can be turned into more just situations, even if perfect\njustice is unattainable (Sen 2006, 2009c). The capability approach clearly\nplays a role in Sen\u2019s work on justice, since when assessing a situation,\nhe will investigate inequalities in people\u2019s capabilities and analyse the\nprocesses that led to those inequalities. Yet Sen has an eclectic approach\nto theorizing, and hence other notions and theories (such as human rights\nor more formal discussions on freedoms from social choice theory) also\nplay a role in his work on justice. The presence and importance of the\ncapability approach in Sen\u2019s work is thus undeniable, but should not be\nseen as the only defining feature.\nSixth, a capability theory of justice needs to specify where the line\nbetween individual and collective responsibility is drawn, or how this\nwill be decided, and by whom. There is a remarkable absence of any\ndiscussion about issues of responsibility in the capability literature, in\nsharp contrast to political philosophy and welfare economics where\nthis is one of the most important lines of debate, certainly since the\npublication of Dworkin\u2019s (1981, 2000) work on justice and equality\nwhich led to what Anderson (1999) has called \u201cluck-egalitarianism\u201d.\nNevertheless, whether one wants to discuss it explicitly or not, any\nconcrete capability policy proposal can be analysed in terms of the\ndivision between personal and collective responsibility, but this\nterminology is largely absent from the capability literature. In part, this\nmight be explained by the fact that much of the work on capabilities\ndeals with global poverty, where issues of individual responsibility\nseem to be less relevant since it would seem outrageous to suggest that\nthe world\u2019s most destitute people are personally responsible for the\nsituation they are in. That doesn\u2019t mean that the responsibility question\nis not important: it is indeed of utmost importance to ask who is\nresponsible for global poverty reduction or the fulfilling of international\ndevelopment targets, such as the Sustainable Development Goals on\nwhich political philosophers have written a great deal (Singer 2004, 3. Clarifications 157\n2010; Pogge 2008). The point is rather that philosophical puzzles, such\nas the issue of expensive tastes (for expensive wine, caviar, fast cars, or\nyou name it), are simply beyond the radar of the child labourer or the\npoor peasant. However, while this may perhaps justify the absence of\nany discussion about personal responsibility among capability scholars\nconcerned with poverty, it does not absolve theorists of justice who deal\nwith justice in affluent societies (or affluent sections of poor societies)\nfrom discussing the just division between personal and collective\nresponsibility (Pierik and Robeyns 2007, 148\u201349).\nThis brings us to a related issue: a theory of justice generally specifies\nrights, but also duties. However, capability theorists have remained\nlargely silent on the question of whose duty it is to expand the selected\ncapabilities. Nussbaum passionately advocates that all people all over\nthe world should be entitled, as a matter of justice, to threshold levels\nof all the capabilities on her list, but apart from mentioning that it is the\ngovernments\u2019 duty to guarantee these entitlements (Nussbaum 2006b,\n70), she remains silent on the question of who precisely should bear\nthe burdens and responsibilities for realizing these capabilities. Yet as\nOnora O\u2019Neill (1996, 122\u201353) has argued, questions of obligations and\nresponsibilities should be central to any account of justice.\nThis section makes clear that a capability theory of justice is\ntheoretically much more demanding than the basic presupposition of\nthe capability approach that \u2018functionings\u2019 and \u2018capabilities\u2019 are the\nbest metric for most kinds of interpersonal evaluations. While much has\nbeen written on the capability approach in recent years by an increasing\nnumber of scholars, including philosophers, much of the philosophical\nwork needed for turning the open-ended capability approach into a\nspecific theory of justice remains to be done.\nNote, however, that not all capability theorists working on issues\nof justice believe that such a fully worked-out theory is required. Sen\n(2009c) himself has argued at length that we don\u2019t need a theory that\ndescribes a utopian ideal, but rather we need theorising to help us with\nmaking comparisons of injustice, and to guide us towards a less unjust\nsociety. Similarly, Jay Drydyk (2012) has argued that the capability\napproach to justice should focus on reducing capability shortfalls, for\nwhich a utopian account of perfect justice is not needed. Some capability\ntheorists may want to work out a full theory of justice by addressing the 158 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nvarious specifications outlined above, while others may want to change\nthe very nature of theorising about justice, moving it more to applied,\nnon-ideal or grounded theories (Watene and Drydyk 2016).\n3.13.3 From theories of justice to\njust practices and policies\nBefore closing this section on capabilitarian theorizing about justice,\nlet us briefly shift from theory to practice. Since theories of justice are\nmainly developed at a highly abstract level, often entailing ideals of\nperfect justice, we may wonder whether the capability approach to social\njustice and equality is of any use in telling us what justice-enhancing\nstrategies and policies to develop. Indeed, this has sometimes been\nphrased as a serious concern, namely, that theories of justice are too\nabstract and do not help us with social justice struggles on the ground.\nOne may well argue that we roughly know what is going wrong and\nwe need political action rather than more and more detailed theorising.\nMoreover, some think that in the real world the subtleties of theories\nof justice are easily abused in order to justify gross inequalities, as\nmay have been the case with philosophical discussions on individual\nresponsibility. For example, Brian Barry\u2019s (2005) later work exemplified\nthis concern with the direct application of theories of justice to political\nchange and the reform of the welfare state, rather than with further\nphilosophical refinements of theories of justice. Related charges have\nbeen aimed at the capability approach as well. For instance, it has\nbeen argued that not enough attention has been paid to issues of social\npower in the capability writings on justice, and Feldman and Gellert\n(2006) have underscored the importance of recognising the struggles\nand negotiations by dominated and disadvantaged groups if social\njustice is ever to be realised. Such questions of power politics, effective\nsocial criticism, successful collective action, historical and cultural\nsensitivities, and the negotiation of competing interests are indeed\nlargely absent from the philosophical literature on theories of justice.\nThese ideal theories develop standards of a just society, but often do not\ntell us what institutions or policies are necessary if just societies are to be\nconstructed, nor do they tell us what social and political processes will\nhelp advocates implement these social changes in concrete ways. 3. Clarifications 159\nBut the capability approach can be linked to more concrete justice-\nenhancing policy proposals that have been developed. For one thing,\nthe Millennium Development Goals could be understood as being a\npractical (albeit specific and also limited) translation of the capability\napproach in practice, and their successors, the Sustainable Development\nGoals, can also be seen as influenced by the capability approach.26 In\nfact, at the level of severe global poverty, any concrete poverty-reduction\nstrategy which conceptualises poverty in a capability sense is, for most\naccounts of justice, a concrete justice-enhancing strategy, since these\ntheories would include the absence of severe poverty as a principle of\njustice.\nIf we move from the area of poverty-reduction strategies to the\nquestion of just social policies in countries or regions with higher levels\nof affluence, we observe that there are much fewer actual examples\nof justice-enhancing policies that have been explicitly grounded in, or\nassociated with, the capability approach. Yet many concrete policies\nand interventions could be interpreted as such, or are consistent with\nthe capability perspective itself. One example relates to a policy of\nproviding, regulating and/or subsidising child-care facilities. This can\narguably be justified as a prerequisite for gender justice in capabilities\nsince, due to gender norms, women will in effect not be able to develop\nthemselves professionally if they are not supported in their need for\ndecent quality-regulated (and possibly subsidised) child-care facilities.\nMothers at home may be materially well-off if their husbands earn a\ngood income but, if they do not have the genuine opportunity to hold\njobs, then their capability sets are severely constrained and gender justice\nin capabilities cannot be achieved. An income metric which assumes\nequal sharing in the household may not detect any moral problem, but\na capability metric will claim that women have more limited freedoms\nthan men, since the provisions are not there to ensure that both parents\ncan hold jobs, and gender norms and other gendered social mechanisms\nmake it highly unlikely that men will volunteer to stay at home with\ntheir children. At the same time, men are also losing out since they have\na very limited capability to spend time with their newborn babies.\n26 See http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/ 160 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nA slightly different example concerns a justice-enhancing\nintervention that can be found in the form of adult volunteers who visit\ndisadvantaged families to read to the children in order to enhance their\nlanguage skills.27 It is well-known that many children of immigrants are\ndisadvantaged at school since they are very likely to enter school with\nweaker knowledge of the language of instruction than non-immigrant\nchildren. For this reason, in several cities there are networks of volunteers\nto read books to small immigrant children in their own homes. In this\nway, they effectively reduce the gap in educational opportunity between\nimmigrant children and non-immigrant children. This example also\nillustrates that justice-enhancing strategies are not confined to public\npolicy, but can also be initiated by persons and groups at the grassroots.\nThe government is not the only agent of justice; we can all do our part.\n3.14 Capabilities and human rights\nSeveral capability theories are closely related to accounts of human\nrights. Within the capability literature, some scholars have developed\ncapability theories that they regard as a human rights theory. In the\nhuman rights literature, scholars have examined to what extent the\ncapability approach can help to develop stronger theories of human\nrights. The same topics (e.g. provision of or right to basic health or basic\neducation) are defended based on both approaches, or are defended\nappealing both to human rights and capabilities (e.g. Osmani 2000).\nAmartya Sen has in several of his publications analysed the relationship\nbetween human rights and capabilities (e.g. Sen 2004b, 2005). In\naddition, Martha Nussbaum has claimed that her capabilities theory is a\nversion of human rights theory, which has drawn much attention to the\nquestion about the relationship between capabilities and human rights.\nIt should not be surprising that there are so many scholars and\npractitioners interested in both the human rights framework and the\ncapability approach, since they share some important aspects. First,\nthey are both widely endorsed ethical frameworks. Second, they seem\nto share an underlying motivation, namely to protect and enhance\n27 In the Netherlands, this volunteer organisation is called De Voorleesexpress (https://\nvoorleesexpress.nl) but similar initiatives must exist around the world. 3. Clarifications 161\npeople\u2019s freedoms. Third, they are both used for global as well as\ndomestic questions. Fourth, both frameworks want to build strong links\nbetween theory and practice: they are studied and used by scholars but\nalso used by practitioners (political parties, activists, policy makers,\netc.). Finally, both discourses are strongly interdisciplinary in nature.\nAll this raises some questions. What is the relationship between\nhuman rights and capabilities? Can we say that capabilities are the\nobjects of human rights? If so, do human rights theories and analyses\nhave something to gain by developing capabilities-based human rights\ntheories? Can the capability approach deliver all that is important in\nhuman rights theories? And what should we make of the alleged\ndisadvantages of using the capability approach in thinking about\nhuman rights?\n3.14.1 What are human rights?\nHuman rights are rights each human being is entitled to in order to\nprotect her from severe harms that could be inflicted by others \u2014 either\nby deliberate actions, or else by the failure to protect human rights\ncaused by institutional design. They are norms aimed at protecting\npeople from severe social, political and legal abuse (Nickel 2014, 1).\nExamples of human rights are the right to life, the right to food, the\nright to freedom of assembly, the right to freedom of religion, the right\nto a fair trial when charged with a crime, the right not to be tortured,\nand the right to privacy.\nHuman rights are not all the rights that people have. As Sen\n(2004b, 329) writes, \u201cthere have to be some \u2018threshold conditions\u2019 of (i)\nimportance and (ii) social influenceability for a freedom to figure within\nthe interpersonal and interactive spectrum of human rights\u201d. Take the\n\u2018importance threshold\u2019 first. Here is an example of a right that is not\na human right, because it does not meet the threshold condition of\nimportance: the right to parental leave. In many European countries,\nparents who are employed have a right to paid parental leave upon\nthe birth of their child or when they adopt a child. While many have\nargued that such a right would help meet our duties towards children\nand parents as well as advance gender justice (e.g. Gheaus and Robeyns\n2011), it is not at all plausible to argue that this should be seen as a 162 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nhuman right. It has a much weaker moral urgency than the right to a fair\ntrial, let alone the right to life. Human rights thus correspond to a subset\nof the domain of justice, and focus on those questions that are of utter\nimportance, the protection of which should have a greater urgency than\nthe support of other normative claims. The second threshold \u2014 social\ninfluenceability \u2014 implies that even if something valuable is hugely\nimportant, as long as there is no or very limited social influenceability,\nits protection cannot be a human right. For example, it makes no sense\nto speak of a human right to be protected from volcano eruptions, or\na human right to be protected from cancer. However, one can say that\nthere is a human right to be warned about volcano eruptions if the\ngovernment has the relevant information. To the extent that there is\nmore social influenceability, the scope to speak coherently of human\nrights increases.\nHuman rights have corresponding duties. But on whom do those\nduties fall and what kind of duties are they? A broad, inclusive account\nof duties is given by Pablo Gilabert (2009, 673) who writes:\n[Human rights impose] a duty of the highest priority for individuals\nand governments to identify ways to protect certain important interests\nthrough (a) specific rights and entitlements, but also, when these\nare insufficient or not presently feasible, through (b) urgent goals of\ninstitution-building.\nNote that this definition does not limit the duty to protect human rights\nto governments only, and that it does include institution-building as an\nimportant path towards protecting human rights.28\n3.14.2 The interdisciplinary scholarship on human rights\nThe human rights literature is, just like the capability approach, deeply\nmultidisciplinary and interdisciplinary. The philosophy of human rights\n\u201caddresses questions about the existence, content, nature, universality,\njustification, and legal status of human rights\u201d (Nickel 2014, 1). How\ncan human rights exist in the first place? What should be the content of\n28 This relates to a complex discussion in legal and political philosophy on whether\nhuman rights can be protected by so-called \u2018imperfect duties\u2019 or \u2018imperfect\nobligations\u2019 which is beyond the scope of this book. See, amongst others, Polly\nVizard (2006, 84\u201391) and Frances Kamm (2011) for further discussion. 3. Clarifications 163\nhuman rights, that is, what kinds of harms or abuses should they protect\nus from? What kind of rights are human rights \u2014 are they moral claims,\nor legal claims, or political claims, or something else? The question\nof justification asks: on what grounds can we say that people have\nhuman rights? Is it because humans have rational capacities or agency?\nIf so, does that mean that newborn babies do not have human rights?\nAll these questions are studied in the vast philosophical literature on\nhuman rights.\nNote that while the relationship between normative political\nphilosophy, justice and human rights is not entirely disputed, the\ndominant view in the contemporary literature is that the domain of\nhuman rights is a subset of the domain of justice, which in turn is a\nsubset of the domain of morality. The reason is that \u201c[n]ot everything\nthat is desirable to be realized in politics is a matter of human rights,\nand not everything that is a matter of justice is a matter of human rights.\nHuman rights constitute the most urgent demand of basic global justice\u201d\n(Gilabert 2009, 676).\nLegal scholars are interested in questions related to the treaties and\nconstitutions in which human rights are codified. The idea of human\nrights gained momentum with the 1948 adoption of the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which over time received a\ncanonical status in legal and political debates. The UDHR subsequently\nserved as a template for human rights instruments that are legally\nbinding, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,\nthe International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,\nthe European Convention on Human Rights, the American Convention\non Human Rights and the African Charter of Human and People\u2019s\nRights. One question this raises is to what extent national constitutions\nare consistent with those legally binding treaties, or with the UDHR.\nAnother question frequently asked by legal scholars is to what extent\nnational jurisprudence can be in tension with \u2014 and violate \u2014 a human\nright that is part of an international treaty to which that particular\nnation signed up. For example, in the famous \u2018Lautsi case\u2019, the question\nemerged whether the Italian state\u2019s policy to have a compulsory crucifix\nin the classroom of public schools was in violation of the human right\nto the freedom of religion as codified in the European Convention on\nHuman Rights (Weiler 2010; Pierik 2012; Pierik and van der Burg 2011). 164 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nIn the social sciences and international relations, questions are asked\nabout what role human rights play in politics. How do countries differ\nin the degree in which they protect human rights? What are the effective\ninstruments that support human rights in countries in which they are\nnot violated? Is it effective to condemn human rights violations in other\ncountries, or is silent support for grassroots human rights activists a\nmore effective strategy?\nOf course, human rights are hugely important for human right\nactivists, who are working on actual human rights protections. Other\nactivists, such as those focusing on the empowerment of disadvantaged\ngroups, often take a more instrumental attitude towards human rights,\nand ask whether such rights are effective instruments to reach their\ngoals of inclusion, development and combatting forms of injustice and\noppression.\n3.14.3 Why a capability-based account of human rights?\nAfter this brief sketch of the huge literature on human rights, we can\nnow explore the relation between human rights and capabilities. The\nfirst question that needs to be asked is: why would we be at all interested\nin a capabilities-based theory of human rights? What could be gained by\ntheorizing human rights, or trying to protect human rights, by referring\nto capabilities?\nThe first reason is philosophical, and concerns the justification\nof human rights. Human rights are norms or instruments to protect\ncertain valuable things (which are called \u2018the objects of human rights\u2019).\nBut every time we claim an object is so important its protection must\nbe enshrined as a human right, we must argue why that object has this\nspecial importance. Part of the philosophical literature on capabilities\ndoes precisely that \u2014 to justify why we need to protect certain valuable\npersonal states. Both Sen (2004b, 2005) and Nussbaum (1997, 2011a)\nhave argued that human rights can be seen as entitlements to certain\ncapabilities. However, Sen\u2019s views are more qualified, since he has\nargued that the object of some but not necessarily all human rights\ncan be viewed as capabilities. There are plausibly also other objects of\nhuman rights, such as process freedoms and liberties.\nThe second reason builds on the first. If some human rights\ncan be understood in terms of capabilities, and poverty can also be 3. Clarifications 165\nconceptualized in terms of the denial of capabilities, then poverty can\nbe conceptualized as a human rights violation (Osmani 2005). This is\nimportant for various reasons, including the strong rhetorical force that\na human rights violation has in comparison with other claims, and also\nbecause socio-economic human rights have sometimes been regarded\nas more in need of conceptual foundations, in comparison with the civic\nand political human rights whose status as human rights has been less\ncontested.\nThis relates to the third reason why it can be helpful to conceptualise\nhuman rights in terms of capabilities, which is the often-stated worry\nthat the protection of human rights, especially social and economic\nrights, is infeasible (Gilabert 2009). To counter that pessimism, we need\ngreater clarity on the chain of steps that are involved in socio-economic\nhuman rights protection. Capabilities are the objects of our rights, and\nwe know, from our understanding of how capabilities relate to resources\nand social structures, which parameters can influence the capabilities\nthat people enjoy (see the figure in section 2.12). Hence, if we want to\nprotect human rights, in particular socio-economic rights, which sceptics\nbelieve cannot effectively be protected, the capability approach helps\nus see that \u201cpromoting socioeconomic rights may require attention\nto specific parameters that affect the capabilities of people\u201d (Gilabert\n2009, 666). In sum, the language of the capability approach helps us to\nrespond and address the feasibility worry of socio-economic rights.\nFourthly, we are unsure whether some things we want to protect\nmeet the threshold condition of importance that human rights should\nmeet. If one is unsure about whether a certain freedom should be a right,\nlet alone a human right, one could already start to protect or enhance it if\none sees it as a capability. One does not need to wait until the discussion\nabout the threshold is settled before one starts to protect something that\neveryone agrees is in any case important.\nA final reason is more practical or political. In some countries, the\nterminology of \u2018human rights\u2019 is regarded with suspicion, as it is seen as\nstemming from a colonial era, and, as a consequence, is regarded as an\ninstrument of western domination. This makes it hard for both local and\nglobal advocates of human rights to advance their cause. By using the\nterminology of capabilities, which is not linked to a particular colonial\nera or western power, instead of the language of human rights, these\nsame valuable rights can be argued for. 166 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\n3.14.4 Are capabilities sufficient to construct\na theory of human rights?\nThere is quite a lot of interest among capability scholars and those\nworking in the human development paradigm to try to bring the best\nof the capability approach and the human rights approach together (e.g.\nVizard 2006, 2007; Vizard, Fukuda-Parr and Elson 2011; Fukuda-Parr\n2011; Gilabert 2009, 2013). One important question, though, is how much\nthe capability approach can offer if one is interested in constructing a\npowerful human rights theory. Is the notion of capabilities sufficient for\nsuch a theory?\nThe answer clearly must be negative. A theory of human rights needs\nother elements, such as a discussion of the scope of, and, importantly,\nthe justification for, human rights. Yet, by making use of the distinction\nbetween the capability approach and capability theories that was\nintroduced in section 2.3, we can see that it is not at all an embarrassment\nfor the capability approach that, by itself, it cannot deliver a theory of\nhuman rights. Instead, that should be the task of a specific capability\ntheory, for which, in the various modules, additional elements that are\nneeded for a human rights theory can be added.\nThis raises the next question: what would have to be added, then?\nOne important thing that may need to be added (in A6 \u2014 other\ndimensions of ultimate value) are process freedoms. Sen (2004b) argues\nthat we should make a distinction between freedoms as substantive\nopportunities and the process aspect of freedom (procedural aspects).\nBoth are, in his view, relevant when thinking about human rights, but\nonly the opportunity aspect of freedom is captured by the notion of\n\u2018capabilities\u2019. Linda Barclay (2016) makes a similar point, by saying that\nrights that concern equitable processes are very important for human rights,\nand cannot be captured by the notion of capabilities. Clearly, procedural\ncharacteristics, for example those that guarantee a free trial, may not\nnecessarily best be understood as capabilities, but perhaps rather more\nas elements of institutional design. Yet as proposition A6 emphasizes,\nnot everything that is of crucial importance is a capability. Recall that\nproposition A6 allows us to include other elements of ultimate value,\nand this could incorporate what Sen calls process freedoms.29 In short, by\n29 The example that Barclay gives is the right not to be discriminated against. Barclay\nbelieves that \u201cto be protected from discrimination\u201d is a very important human 3. Clarifications 167\nseeing a capability-based human rights theory as a capability theory, for\nwhich various theoretical additions and choices are possible, it becomes\nclear that more is needed than the mere reference to \u2018capabilities\u2019.\nNote also that we can, of course, ask the question the other way\naround \u2014 what is needed to make a capability theory? \u2014 and use the\nhuman rights framework as the theory of value that is used to make the\nselection of capabilities. This route has been developed by Polly Vizard,\nand has led to the \u201chuman rights based capability set\u201d (Vizard 2006,\n2007).\n3.14.5 The disadvantages\nFinally, we need to ask whether there are any disadvantages in using the\ncapability approach to further our thinking, policy making and activism\non human rights, and \u2014 ultimately \u2014 in letting a capabilities-based\nhuman rights theory compete with the existing human rights accounts.\nThe first thing to note is that there is a long-standing human rights\ndiscourse that is used by activists all over the world, and often very\neffectively so. Clearly there are costs involved for these activists to\nbecome familiarized with the capability language. If the human rights\ndiscourse delivers to them what they need, why would we change it?\nSecond, there is a worry about legitimacy. The current human rights\ndeclarations and treaties have been the result of actual political processes,\nand the treaties were drafted by a large number of people, drawn from\nall over the world. For the capability approach, this is different. Given\nthe prominence of Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum, and also the\nmany publications that (wrongly) reduce the capability approach to\nthe work by, primarily, Sen and Nussbaum,30 the capability approach\nis much more associated with specific individuals. A capability-based\nhuman rights theory that is the work of one thinker can never have the\npolitical leverage that the existing human rights framework has. For the\nright, but cannot plausibly be conceptualized as a capability, since one does not\nhave a choice to be discriminated against or not. However, not being discriminated\nagainst is a functioning, and it is a mistake to think that the capability approach\nholds that we should only focus on capabilities and never on functionings, as was\nargued in section 3.4.\n30 Unfortunately, Nussbaum\u2019s (2011c) account of the capability approach only adds to\nthat reductive and misleading portrayal of the capability literature (Robeyns 2011,\n2016b; Unterhalter 2013). 168 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nvarious practices in which human rights are used (creating laws, making\npolicy and activism) a capability-based human rights framework can\ntherefore never replace the existing human rights framework.\nHowever, there is, of course, a more fruitful relationship possible,\nand that is to see the two frameworks as complementary rather than\ncompetitive (Nussbaum 2011a). Note, however, that any merging of\nthe two frameworks has to be between a particular capability theory\nand human rights thinking, rather than between the general capability\napproach and human rights thinking.31 A good example of such\npractical work is the UK\u2019s Equality and Human Rights Framework.\nTania Burchardt and Polly Vizard (2011) used insights from both the\ncapability approach and the existing work on human rights to create a\nframework that is used for the monitoring undertaken by the Equality\nand Human Rights Commission in order to meet its legal mandate.32\n3.15 Conclusion\nThe aim of this chapter has been to deepen our understanding of the\ncapability approach, by analysing some questions of clarification\nthat are often posed, and by reconstructing and synthesizing some\ndevelopments that have taken place in the capability literature over\ntime.\nThe next chapter will focus on a range of critiques that have been\nput to the capability approach. Of course, it is not always entirely clear\nwhether a certain question or debate is purely a matter of clarification,\nor rather a matter of debate and dispute; put differently, there is no neat\ndemarcation between the main focus of this chapter and that of the next.\nStill, in this chapter I have tried to be as neutral and even-handed as\npossible in describing the literature, whereas in the next chapter I will\ntake a more active role in arguing for or against certain views or claims.\n31 Hence, when Nussbaum (2011a, 24) writes \u201cthe CA is a type of human rights\napproach\u201d, we should read this as \u201cMartha Nussbaum\u2019s capability theory is a\ntype of human rights approach\u201d. Many other capability theories are, evidently, not\nhuman rights approaches, and hence the capability approach, as the overarching\nframework, cannot be either.\n32 See https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en 4. Critiques and Debates\n4.1 Introduction\nIn chapter 2 I gave an account of the capability approach that gave us\na better sense of its necessary core and its scope, as well as describing\nthe structure of a capability theory or capability analysis. While that\naccount has aimed to be precise and comprehensive, it nevertheless\nraises some further issues.\nHence, this chapter is focussed on investigating those further\nquestions and debates. We will look into the following issues. Section\n4.2 asks whether everything that has been called a capability in the\nliterature is genuinely so. Section 4.3 addresses a dispute that has kept\ncapability theorists busy for quite a while over the last two decades,\nnamely whether a capability theorist should endorse a specific list\nof capabilities. For many years, this was debated under the banner\n\u2018the question of the list\u2019 and was seen as the major criticism that\nMartha Nussbaum had of Amartya Sen\u2019s work on the capability\napproach. Section 4.4 investigates the relationship between the basic\nneeds approach and philosophical theories of needs, and argues that\nthe capability scholars may be able to engage more fruitfully with\ntheories of needs. Section 4.5 asks whether, as Nussbaum suggests,\nwe should understand the capability approach as a theory that\naddresses the government; I will argue that we should reject that\nsuggestion and also take other \u2018agents of change\u2019 into account. Section\n4.6 analyses a debate that has generated much controversy, namely\nwhether the capability approach can be said to be too individualistic.\nThe next section, 4.7, focuses on a closely related issue: the scope\n\u00a9 2017 Ingrid Robeyns, CC BY 4.0 https://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0130.04 170 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nfor the inclusion of \u2018power\u2019 into the capability approach. Should the\ncapability approach pay much more attention to political economy?\nSection 4.8 asks whether the capability approach is a liberal theory,\nand whether it can be anything other than a liberal theory. Section 4.9\nargues that, despite the many references to \u2018the human development\nand capability approaches\u2019, these are not the same thing. Finally,\nsection 4.10 discusses the potential and problems of a capabilitarian\nwelfare economics.\n4.2 Is everything that\u2019s called a capability\ngenuinely a capability?\nSince this chapter is the place to collect critiques and debates, let me\nstart with a very basic point of criticism: not everything that is called\n\u2018a capability\u2019 in the capability literature is, upon closer examination,\ngenuinely a capability. The main criticism that I want to offer in this\nbrief section is that we should be very careful in our choices of terms\nand concepts: not everything that is important is a capability, and it\nis conceptually confusing (and hence wrong) to call everything that is\nimportant a capability. As an interdisciplinary language used in many\ndifferent disciplines, the capability approach already suffers from\nsloppy use of terms because of interdisciplinary differences in their\nusage, and we should avoid contributing to this conceptual confusion.\nLet me give one example to illustrate the critique.\nIn her book Allocating the Earth as well as in earlier work, Breena\nHolland (2008, 2014) argues that the role of the environment in making\ncapabilities possible is so important and central that we should\nconceptualize environmental ecological functioning (that is, the\necosystem services that the environment offers to human beings) as\na meta-capability that underlies all other capabilities. As Holland puts\nit, \u201cthe environment\u2019s ecological functioning is a meta-capability in\nthe sense that it is a precondition of all the capabilities that Nussbaum\ndefines as necessary for living a good human life\u201d (2014, 112). By\nusing this terminology, Holland wants to stress that protecting\nthe ecosystem is not just one way among many equally good ways\nto contribute to human wellbeing \u2014 rather, it is a crucial and non-\nsubstitutable precondition for living. Yet one could question whether\nconceptualizing it as a \u201cmeta-capability\u201d is correct. As I have argued 4. Critiques and Debates 171\nelsewhere (Robeyns 2016a), the environment is not a capability,\nsince capabilities are real opportunities for beings and doings. The\nenvironment and the services that its ecosystems give to human beings\nare absolutely necessary for human life to be possible in the first place,\nbut that doesn\u2019t warrant giving it the conceptual status of a \u2018capability\u2019.\nIt would have been better, in my view, to introduce a term showing that\nthere are substitutable and non-substitutable preconditions for each\ncapability, and that there are absolutely necessary (or crucial) versus\nless central preconditions. An environment that is able to deliver a\nminimal level of ecosystem services to life on our planet is both a\nnon-substitutable as well as an absolutely necessary precondition for\nhuman wellbeing understood in terms of capabilities. There are many\nother preconditions for human wellbeing, but a minimum level of\nsustainable ecosystem services is one of the very few \u2014 perhaps even\nthe only one \u2014 that is both non-substitutable and absolutely necessary.\nThat makes it hugely important \u2014 perhaps even more important than\nsome capabilities (which could be accommodated by including it in\nproposition A6), but the absolute priority it should receive does not\nwarrant us to call it a capability.\n4.3 Should we commit to a\nspecific list of capabilities?\nAt an earlier stage of the development of the capability approach, a\nrather heated debate took place on whether or not it was necessary\nfor Sen to list the capabilities he felt were relevant for the issue under\nconsideration. This \u2018question of the list\u2019 debate wasn\u2019t always very\nhelpful, since participants were not making the distinction between\ncapability theories and the capability approach, which, as I will show\nin this section, is crucial to answer this question. Several scholars have\ncriticized Sen for not having specified which capabilities matter or for\nnot giving us some guidelines on how the selection of capabilities could\nbe conducted (e.g. Sugden 1993; Roemer 1996; Nussbaum 2003a). As is\nwell known, Sen has explicitly refrained from committing himself to\none particular list of capabilities. But should Sen (or anyone else) do so?\nIn order to answer that question, it is important to keep the distinction\nin mind between the general capability approach, and particular\ncapability theories. As Mozaffar Qizilbash (2012) rightly points out, Sen 172 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nhas written on the capability approach in general and he has developed\nparticular capability applications, critiques, and theories. When asking\nwhether Sen (or anyone else) should commit to a particular list of\ncapabilities, we have to keep that distinction firmly in mind \u2014 since it\nis relevant to our answer.\nIt is obvious that there cannot be one list that applies to all the different\npurposes for which the capability approach can be used \u2014 that is, one\nlist that applies to more specific capability theories and applications.\nHence insofar as it is argued that Sen (or any other capability scholar)\nshould endorse a particular list of capabilities when discussing the\ncapability approach, rather than more specific capability theories, this\ncritique misfires. This is part of the answer that Sen has given to his\ncritics. Each application or theory based on the capability approach will\nalways require a selection of valuable functionings that fits the purpose\nof the theory or application. Hence the capability approach as such is\ndeliberately too underspecified to endorse just one single list that could\nbe used for all capability analyses (Sen 1993, 2004). It is quite likely that\nthose who have criticised Sen, or the capability approach in general,\nfor not entailing a specific list of capabilities, have not sufficiently\nappreciated the distinction between the capability approach in general\nand more specific capability theories.\nBut what then about specific capability theories, applications and\nanalyses? Should these always commit to a particular list of capabilities?\nIt is possible to distinguish between two types of critique addressing\ncapability theories, which I labelled the weak and strong critiques\n(Robeyns 2005a). The strong critique entails that there must be a clear\nlist of capabilities that we can use for all capability theories and their\napplication.\nThe strong critique is most clearly voiced by Nussbaum, who has\nproposed a list of ten \u201ccentral human capabilities\u201d that specify the\npolitical principles that every person should be entitled to as a matter\nof justice.1 Nussbaum\u2019s capabilities theory differs in a number of ways\nfrom Sen\u2019s version. Nussbaum (1988, 2003) not only argues that these\nten capabilities are the relevant ones, but in addition claims that if\n1 These ten capabilities are: Life; Bodily health; Bodily integrity; Senses, imagination\nand thought; Emotions; Practical reason; Affiliation; Other species; Play; and\nControl over one\u2019s environment. For more details, see Nussbaum (2006b, 76\u201378). 4. Critiques and Debates 173\nSen wants his version of the capability approach to have any bite for\naddressing issues of social justice, he has to endorse one specific and\nwell-defined list of capabilities.\nSen does not accept the stronger critique as it applies to particular\ncapability theories. The reason is the importance he attaches to agency,\nthe process of choice, and the freedom to reason with respect to the\nselection of relevant capabilities. He argues that theory on its own is not\ncapable of making such a final list of capabilities (Sen 2004). Instead, Sen\nargues that we must leave it to democratic processes and social choice\nprocedures to define the distributive policies. In other words, when\nthe capability approach is used for policy work, it is the people who\nwill be affected by the policies who should decide on what will count\nas valuable capabilities for the policy in question. This immediately\nmakes clear that in order to be operational for (small-scale) policy\nimplementation, the capability approach needs to engage with theories\nof deliberative democracy and public deliberation and participation.\nSen\u2019s response to the strong critique can be better understood by\nhighlighting his meta-theoretical views on the construction of theories,\nand theories of justice in particular. One should not forget that Sen is\npredominantly a prominent scholar in social choice theory, which is\nthe discipline that studies how individual preferences and interests\ncan be combined to reach collective decisions, and how these processes\naffect the distribution and levels of welfare and freedom. Sen published\nground-breaking work in social choice theory before he started working\non the capability approach, and he has never ceased to be interested in\nand to contribute to social choice theory.2 Sen\u2019s passion for social choice\ntheory is also a very likely explanation for his critique of the dominant\nforms of contemporary theories of justice, which, he argues, focus on\ndescribing a utopian situation of perfect justice, rather than giving us\ntools to detect injustices and decide how to move forward to a less\nunjust society (Sen 2006, 2009c).\nAccording to my reading of Sen\u2019s work on capability theories and\napplications, he is not against the selection of dimensions in general, but\nrather (a) against one list that would apply to all capability theories and\n2 Sen was also awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize for his contributions to social\nchoice theory and welfare economics. For some of his work on social choice theory,\nsee Sen (1970a, 1970b, 1976, 1977b, 1979, 1983, 1986, 1992c, 1999c, 2017). 174 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\napplications, and (b) as far as those capability theories and applications\nare concerned, in favour of seriously considering procedural methods\nto decide which capabilities matter.\nHowever, even if we all accept that view, it doesn\u2019t settle all disputes.\nEven if we agree that a selection of capabilities for, say, a poverty\nevaluation should differ from the selection of capabilities for a theory\nof justice, this still allows for different views on how that selection\nshould be made. Some scholars have argued that it should be based on\nnormative grounds, in other words based on philosophical reasoning\nand argumentation (Nussbaum 2000; 2006b; Claassen 2016). Others\nhave argued for a selection based on a procedural method (Byskov\n2017). For empirical applications, it has been argued that the selection\nof dimensions should be made in a way that minimises biases in the\nselection (Robeyns 2003). For policy-relevant applications, it has been\nargued that the freedoms listed in the Universal Declaration of Human\nRights could provide a good starting point, and should plausibly be\nplaying a larger role in the selection of capabilities (Vizard 2007; Burchardt\nand Vizard 2011). There are by now various overviews published on\nhow to select functionings and capabilities but, interestingly, they\nalmost always are limited to a certain type of capability theory, such\nas wellbeing for policy making (Hick and Burchardt 2016; Alkire 2016),\nmultidimensional poverty measurement (Alkire 2016; Alkire et al.\n2015), human development projects and policies (Alkire 2002; Byskov\nforthcoming) and theories of justice (Robeyns 2016d). Thus, there are\na range of arguments pointing out that the selection of capabilities for\nparticular capability theories needs to be sensitive to the purpose of the\ntheory in question, hence selection is a matter to be decided at the level\nof the individual capability theories, rather than at the more general and\nabstract level of the capability approach (see also Sen 2004a).\n4.4 Why not use the notion of needs?\nBy introducing the concepts of \u2018functionings\u2019 and \u2018capabilities\u2019, the\ncapability approach offers some specific notions of \u2018advantage\u2019 and\nprovides an ethical framework to guide our actions and institutional\ndesign. It is also a theoretical framework with clear commitments\nto practice and policy making in the world as it is, not just in some\nhypothetical world or in a stylized model. However, the same can be 4. Critiques and Debates 175\nsaid of the (basic) needs approach, which was introduced and developed\nmuch earlier in the landscape of ethical approaches related to wellbeing\nand poverty. Hence, the obvious question to ask is: why not use the\nnotion of needs for our theoretical work, and the basic needs approach\nfor work on development?\nTo answer that question, it makes sense to make a distinction\nbetween the basic needs approach as it has been used by development\nscholars and policy makers, and the philosophical theories of basic\nneeds. Let us look at the basic needs approach first. This is a practice\nand policy oriented approach \u201cthat gives priority to meeting people\u2019s\nbasic needs \u2014 to ensuring that there are sufficiently, appropriately\ndistributed basic need goods and services to sustain all human lives at\na minimally decent level\u201d (Stewart 2006, 14). The basic needs approach\nwas a reaction to the development policies that many countries in the\nGlobal South pursued after independence from colonial rule, and that\nled to a dualistic pattern of development, with a small modern sector\nthat allowed some people to flourish while at the same time leaving\nmany other people in poverty and unemployment. The fundamental\nclaim of the basic needs approach was that the poor not only need a\nmonetary income but also some very basic goods and services such as\nclean water, enough food, health services, and education. Given the\nurgency of these needs, the hope was that the requirement to supply\nthem would be more readily accepted by governments in both the\nGlobal South and North than theoretical arguments about inequality\n(Stewart 2006, 15).\nIn the 1980s, the basic needs approach lost support because\ndevelopment donors shifted their attention to the goals of stability\nand adjustment, but when they again started to pay attention to the\npoor, adopting the capability approach, and especially the more policy\noriented human development paradigm, seemed more attractive.\nHowever, according to Frances Stewart (2006, 18), when applied to\nthe concern of reducing poverty in the Global South, the capability\napproach and the basic needs approach are very similar in terms of the\nactions they recommend.\nWhy, then, would anyone consider the capability approach over the\nbasic needs approach? The first reason is that the capability approach\nseems to have a more elegant philosophical foundation (Stewart 2006,\n18). However, while its seeming elegance might have been perceived 176 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nby the basic needs practitioners as a reason for its adoption, the\nquestion is whether this is true, given that there have always been the\nphilosophical theories of needs, to which we turn below. Perhaps the\nanswer is pragmatic and points to an advantage of the interdisciplinary\nnature of the capability approach: Sen did not only lay out its theoretical\nfoundations, but also, via his empirical work and his contributions to the\nHuman Development Reports, translated those philosophical ideas into\npractice. Perhaps it is the case that a philosophical theory needs some\ncharismatic thinker who translates it into practice, since otherwise it is\nnot picked up by policy makers. In the case of the capability approach,\nSen did both the philosophical work and the policy translation.\nAnother reason mentioned by Stewart is that the capability\napproach focuses more on the situation of individuals than the basic\nneeds approach (Stewart 2006, 18). The capability approach doesn\u2019t\nrecommend the delivery of the same basic goods to everyone, but rather\nthat we take human diversity as much as possible into account. The basic\nneeds approach was more broad-brush than the capability approach,\nwhich stresses the additional resources needed by some people, such\nas the disabled. A third reason is that the capability approach applies\nto all human beings, hence also to the rich, whereas the basic needs\napproach has generally been perceived as focused on poor people\nin poor countries (Streeten 1995, ix). The more inclusive scope of the\ncapability approach, which applies to all human beings, resonates with\nan increasing acknowledgement that countries in the Global North\nalso include people with low levels of wellbeing, and that ideas of\ndevelopment, social progress and prosperity apply to all countries. This\nis very well captured in the case of the Sustainable Development Goals,\nwhich are goals applicable to all countries.\nMany of the earlier key advocates of the basic need approach\nare pursuing their goals now under the umbrella of the human\ndevelopment paradigm. Hence the pragmatic and policy oriented basic\nneeds approach has joined the human development paradigm, which\nhas become much stronger politically. For policy making, the influence\nof frameworks at a particular point in time is one of the relevant\nconsiderations whether one should adopt one framework rather than\nanother, and hence there is a good reason why, given their pragmatic\ngoals, the basic needs advocates have contributed to a joint endeavour\nwith capability scholars to set up the human development paradigm. 4. Critiques and Debates 177\nBut what about the philosophical theories of basic needs? Are there\nreasons why we should favour them rather than the capability approach?\nThe arguments that were given for the pragmatic basic needs approach\napply also to some extent to the questions of the complementarities\nand differences between the theories. There are, theoretically, close\nsimilarities between theories of needs and capabilities, and Soran Reader\n(2006) has argued that many of the objections that capability scholars\nhave to theories of needs are unwarranted and based on implausibly\nreductionist readings of theories of needs. According to Reader, theories\nof needs and capability theories have much more in common than\ncapability scholars have been willing to see.\nStill, Sen has been notorious in arguing that the capability approach\nis superior to the basic needs approach, a critique he has reaffirmed\nin his latest book (Sen 2017, 25). In his paper \u2018Goods and people\u2019,\nSen (1984a, 513\u201315) criticised the basic needs approach for being too\nfocussed on commodities, and seeing human beings as passive and\nneedy. Those criticisms were rebutted by Alkire (2002, 166\u201374), who\nbelieved they were based on misinterpretations. However, Alkire did\nargue that the other two claims by Sen were correct. First, that the basic\nneeds approach confines our attention to the most desperate situations,\nand is therefore only useful to developing countries. Alkire, however,\nsees this as potentially a strength of the basic needs approach; one\ncould argue that it helps us to focus our attention on the worst off. Sen\u2019s\nfinal criticism was, according to Alkire, the one with most theoretical\nbite: that the basic needs approach does not have solid philosophical\nfoundations.\nHowever, the question is whether that is true. A set of recent\npapers by basic needs scholars (Brock and Reader 2002; Reader and\nBrock 2004; Reader 2006) make clear that the philosophical theory of\nbasic needs is sophisticated; moreover, several philosophically highly\nsophisticated theories of needs have been proposed in the past, both\nin the Aristotelian tradition but also more recently by contemporary\nphilosophers (e.g. Doyal and Gough 1991; Wiggins 1998). Instead, a\nmore plausible explanation for the basic needs approach losing ground\nin comparison to the capability approach seems to me that in the case of\nthe basic needs approach, there was less interaction between empirical\nscholars and policy makers on the one hand, and philosophers on\nthe other. It is hard to find evidence of a clear synergy between basic 178 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nneeds philosophers and basic needs development scholars and policy\nadvisors \u2014 an interaction that is very present in the capability literature.\nThis may explain why the basic needs approach has been seen as lacking\nsolid conceptual foundations.\nYet despite these hypotheses, which may help us understand why\nthe capability approach to a large extent replaced the focus on needs in\nthe practical field and in empirical research, some genuine differences\nremain. The first difference requires the capability approach to adopt\nsome basic distinctions that are fundamental to philosophical needs\ntheory, and for which the capability approach in itself does not have\nthe resources: the distinction between non-contingent needs on the one\nhand, and contingent needs, desires, wants, etc. on the other hand. Non-\ncontingent needs are cases in which \u201cthe needing being simply cannot\ngo on unless its need is met\u201d (Reader and Brock 2004, 252). This relates\nto a more common-sense distinction between \u2018needs\u2019 and \u2018wants\u2019, that\nhas an important relevance to our everyday ethical life and to policy\nmaking, but that has no equivalent in the capability approach. For\nsome applications of the capability approach, such as those related to\nprioritising in conditions of extreme scarcity of resources (whether these\nresources are money, food, water, the right to emit greenhouse gasses,\netc.) theories of needs can provide tools to guide our moral priorities that\nare lacking in the capability approach. Right now, preferences dominate\nin public decision making, but the concept of preferences cannot make\na distinction between a preference for minimal amounts of water, food,\nsafety, and social interaction, versus a preference for wine and a jacuzzi.\nThe preferences-based approach, which has become very dominant in\nethical theory as well as policy analysis by economists, doesn\u2019t have the\ntheoretical resources to make such a distinction, whereas it is central to\nsome of our intuitions of how to prioritise our actions in cases of scarcity\n(e.g. J. O\u2019Neill 2011; Robeyns 2017a).\nThe second difference follows from the first. The distinction\nin theories of needs between the morally required (meeting non-\ncontingent or basic needs) and the morally laudable but not required\n(the other needs, wants, desires, etc.) implies that the needs approach\nmay have a smaller scope than the capability approach. The modular\nview of the capability approach presented in chapter 2 makes clear that\nthe capability approach can be used for a wide variety of capabilitarian\ntheories and applications. The basic needs approach is more focussed 4. Critiques and Debates 179\non situations in which we need to prioritise \u2014 but the domain of ethical\nquestions is broader than that.\nIn conclusion, the basic needs approach in practice is, for pragmatic\nand political reasons, now part of the human development paradigm.\nAt the theoretical level, though, capability scholars neglect to take the\nphilosophy of needs seriously or to draw on the theoretical resources\nof those theories to strengthen particular capabilitarian theories and\napplications.\n4.5 Does the capability approach\nonly address the government?\nSome capability scholars believe that the capability approach is a theory\nabout public policy or state action. For example, Nussbaum (2011, 19)\nwrites that it is an essential element of the (general) capability approach\nthat it ascribes an urgent task to government and public policy. In her\nown capabilities theory of justice, Nussbaum makes very clear that she\nsees the government as the actor of change. But is it right to see the\ngovernment as the only agent of change or of justice in the capability\napproach? I think the literature offers ample evidence that this is not\nthe case.\nThe first thing to note is that, while the dominant view is that\nthe capability approach is related to public policy and assumes the\ngovernment as the main or only agent of change, and while Nussbaum\nhighlights the government as the actor of change in her account of the\ncapability approach in Creating Capabilities, not all capability scholars\nendorse this focus on the government. For example, as Frances Stewart\n(2005, 189) writes:\nGiven that improvements in the position of the poor rarely happen solely\nthrough the benevolence of governments, and are more likely to occur\nbecause of political and economic pressures, organisation of groups\namong the poor is important \u2014 even essential \u2014 to achieve significant\nimprovements.\nThe view that the capability approach is government-focussed may thus\nbe reinforced by the fact that Nussbaum makes this claim, but other\ncapability scholars are developing theories or applications that address\nother agents of change. A prominent example is the work of Solava 180 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nIbrahim (2006, 2009) who has shown how self-help initiatives can play a\ncrucial role in promoting the capabilities of the poor, by enhancing their\nownership of development projects, and \u201covercoming their helplessness\nby changing their perceptions of their own capabilities\u201d (Ibrahim 2009,\n236). Similar research has been conducted in more informal settings\nin Khayelitsha, a South African township, by Ina Conradie (2013).\nThese are just two studies that have been published in widely read\nscholarly journals \u2014 but there is a broad range of capability theories\nand capability applications that do not, or do not primarily, address\nthe government. In conclusion, the first observation is that some of the\ncapability literature does not address the government. But can we in\naddition also find reasons for not restricting the agents of change in the\ncapability approach to the government?\nThe first reason relates to the distinction between the capability\napproach and capability theories and applications, which was introduced\nin section 2.3. As far as we are looking at the capability approach, rather\nthan particular capability theories or applications, an exclusive focus on\nthe government is clearly unwarranted. There is nothing in module A\nthat forces us to see the government as the addressee of our capability\ntheory, and module B1 (the purpose of the capability theory) gives us\nthe choice between any addressee we would like to pick. One could also\nuse the capability approach to analyse what neighbours, in a particular\nstreet or neighbourhood in a well-functioning democratic state, could\ndo for each other and in their common interests, in order to improve\nthe quality of life in their neighbourhood. The neighbours may prefer to\nkeep the initiative for themselves, and not ask the government to solve\ntheir local problems.\nAnother example of a capability application in which the government\nis not involved at all is the case of parents deciding to which school\nto send their child (assuming they have options to choose from, which\nglobally is not the case for many parents). Suppose that parents have\nthe choice between two schools. The first school focusses more on\nmaking pupils ready to excel in their future professional life, endorsing\na human capital understanding of education. In the other school, there\nis more attention paid to creative expression, learning the virtues of\ncooperating, taking responsibility for oneself, for others and for the\nenvironment, and a concern with the flourishing of the child as he or 4. Critiques and Debates 181\nshe is now, not just as a future adult. Clearly there is a different ideal of\neducation in these two school. The parents may sit down and write two\nlists of the pros and cons of the different schools \u2014 and many items on\nthat list will be functionings or capabilities. Parents choosing between\nthese two schools will choose different future capability sets for their\nchildren. Although the terminology may not be used, capabilities are at\nwork in this decision; yet very few people would argue that it is a task\nfor the government to decide whether children should be sent to schools\nfocussing on human capital training, or rather on human flourishing.\nThe scholarship focussing on curriculum design using the capability\napproach, or on making us understand the difference between human\ncapital and human capabilities is doing precisely all of this (Brighouse\n2006; Robeyns 2006c; Wigley and Akkoyunlu-Wigley 2006; Walker 2008,\n2010, 2012b).\nOf course, one could respond to these examples by saying that there\nmay be capability applications or theories that belong to the private\nsphere and that therefore the government is not the (only) agent of\nchange \u2014 yet that capabilitarian political theories, such as theories of\njustice, should address the government.\nBut this response will not do either. As several political theorists\nhave argued, the question of who should be the agents of justice is\none that needs to be properly discussed and analysed, and it is not\nat all obvious that the primary or only agents of justice should be the\ngovernment (O. O\u2019Neill 2001; Weinberg 2009; Deveaux 2015). There are\nat least three reasons one could give for not giving the government the\nmain role as agent of change, or indeed any role at all. The first reason\nis one\u2019s general ideological commitment as regards political systems.\nAnarchism and (right-)libertarian political theories would either give\nthe government no agency at all, or else only insofar as property rights\nneed to be protected (Nozick 1974). There is nothing in the structure of\nanarchist or libertarian political theories that rules out their adoption\nof functionings and capabilities as (part of) the metric of quality of life\nthat should guide the social and economic institutions that we choose\nfor our societies. People have very different views on the question of\nwhat can realistically be expected from a government. Just as we need to\ntake people as they are, we should not work with an unrealistic utopian\naccount of government. It may be that the capabilitarian ideal society is 182 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nbetter reached by a coordinated commitment to individual action or by\nrelying on market mechanisms. Adherents of public choice theory would\nstress that giving the government the power to deliver those goods\nwill have many unintended but foreseeable negative consequences,\nwhich are much more important than the positive contributions the\ngovernment could make.3\nA second reason why capabilitarian political theories may not\nsee the government as the only, or primary, agent of justice, relates\nto the distinction between ideal theories of justice (which describe\nthose normative principles that would be met in a just world, and the\ninstitutions that would meet those principles) versus non-ideal theory\n(which describes what is needed to reduce injustices in the world in\nwhich we live).4 In several areas of the world, governmental agents\nare involved in the creation of (severe) economic and social injustice,\neither internationally or against some of its own minorities, or \u2014 in\nhighly repressive states \u2014 against the vast majority of the population\n(e.g. Hochschild 1999; Roy 2014). The government is then more part of\nthe problem than part of the solution, and some would argue that it\nis very naive to construct capabilitarian political theories that simply\nassume that the government will be a force for the good (Menon 2002).\nSimilarly, some political philosophers have argued that in cases of\ninjustice in which the government doesn\u2019t take sufficient action, as in\nthe case of harms done by climate change, duties fall on others who are\nin a position to \u2018take up the slack\u2019 or make a difference (Karnein 2014;\nCaney 2016).\nThe third reason why capabilitarian political theories may not see\nthe government as the only, or primary, agent of justice, relates to the\nquestion of how we decide to allocate the responsibility for being the\nagent of change.5 As Monique Devaux points out, we can attribute\nmoral and political agency derived from our responsibility in creating\nthe injustice (a position advocated by Thomas Pogge (2008) in his work\non global poverty) or because of the greater capacities and powers that\n3 F or an introduction to the public choice literature, see Mueller (2003).\n4 On the distinction between ideal and non-ideal theories of justice, see e.g. Swift\n(2008); Stemplowska (2008); Robeyns (2008a); Valentini (2012).\n5 The second and third reasons may sometimes both be at work in an argument to\nattribute agency to a particular group or institutions. 4. Critiques and Debates 183\nagents have, as Onora O\u2019Neill (2001) has advocated. Devaux (2015,\n127\u201328) argues that in the case of justice related to global poverty,\nthe moral agency of the poor stems from their experience of living in\npoverty. This may not only make them more effective as political agents\nin some contexts, but it might also lead to the poor endorsing a different\npolitical agenda, often focussing on empowerment, rather than merely\nreducing poverty understood in material terms. This is in tune with the\nearlier-mentioned research by Ibrahim (2006, 2009) and Conradie (2013)\non self-organisation by the poor.\nIt has not been my aim in this section to defend a particular way to\nanswer the question of who should be the agent(s) of justice. Rather,\nmy goal has been much more limited \u2014 namely, to show that it is not\nat all self-evident that a capabilitarian political theory, let alone another\ntype of capabilitarian theory or application, would always posit the\ngovernment as the only agent of change, or the primary agent of change.\nPace what Nussbaum (2011) claims on this issue, there is no reason\nwhy this should be the case, and there are many good reasons why we\nshould regard our answer to this question as one that requires careful\nreasoning and consideration \u2014 and ultimately a choice that is made in\nmodule B and module C, rather than a fixed given in module A.\n4.6 Is the capability approach too individualistic?\nAt the beginning of this century, an often-heard critique at academic\nmeetings on the capability approach was that \u201cthe capability approach\nis too individualistic\u201d. This critique has been especially widespread\namong those who endorse communitarian philosophies, or social\nscientists who argue that neoclassical economics is too individualistic,\nand believe that the same applies to the capability approach (e.g. Gore\n1997; Evans 2002; Deneulin and Stewart 2002; Stewart 2005). The main\nclaim would be that any theory should regard individuals as part of\ntheir social environment, and hence agents should be recognised\nas socially embedded and connected to others, and not as atomised\nindividuals. Very few scholars have directly argued that the capability\napproach is too individualistic, but a few have stated it explicitly.\nS\u00e9verine Deneulin and Frances Stewart (2002, 66) write that \u201cthe\n[capability] approach is an example of methodological individualism\u201d 184 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nand also add \u201cthe individualism of the [capability] approach leads us\n[\u2026] to a belief that there are autonomous individuals whose choices\nare somehow independent of the society in which they live\u201d. But is this\ncritique correct? What are we to make of the argument that the capability\napproach is \u201ctoo individualistic\u201d?6\n4.6.1 Different forms of individualism\nTo scrutinise the allegedly individualistic character of the capability\napproach, we should distinguish between ethical or normative\nindividualism on the one hand and methodological and ontological\nindividualism on the other. As we already saw in section 2.6.8, ethical\nindividualism, or normative individualism, makes a claim about who or\nwhat should count in our evaluative exercises and decisions. It postulates\nthat individuals, and only individuals, are the units of ultimate moral\nconcern. In other words, when evaluating different states of affairs, we\nare only interested in the (direct and indirect) effects of those states on\nindividuals. Methodological and ontological individualism are somewhat\nmore difficult to describe, as the debate on methodological individualism\nhas suffered from confusion and much obscurity. Nevertheless, at\nits core is the claim that \u201call social phenomena are to be explained\nwholly and exclusively in terms of individuals and their properties\u201d\n(Bhargava 1992, 19). It is a doctrine that includes semantic, ontological\nand explanatory individualism. The last is probably the most important\nof these doctrines, and this can also explain why many people reduce\nmethodological individualism to explanatory individualism. Ontological\nindividualism states that only individuals and their properties exist, and\nthat all social entities and properties can be identified by reducing them\nto individuals and their properties. Ontological individualism hence\nmakes a claim about the nature of human beings, about the way they\n6 Amartya Sen has responded to their critique by stating that \u201cI fear I do not\nsee at all the basis of their diagnosis\u201d (Sen 2002b, 80). As my arguments in this\nsection will show, I think Sen is right, because Deneulin\u2019s and Stewart\u2019s critique\nfails to distinguish properly between different types of individualism, including\nmethodological individualism (which the capability approach is not) and normative\nindividualism (which the capability approach meets, and, as I have argued in\nsection 2.6.8, should meet). 4. Critiques and Debates 185\nlive their lives and about their relation to society. In this view, society is\nbuilt up from individuals only, and hence is nothing more than the sum\nof individuals and their properties. Similarly, explanatory individualism\nis the doctrine that all social phenomena can in principle be explained\nin terms of individuals and their properties.\nThe crucial issue here is that a commitment to normative\nindividualism is not incompatible with an ontology that recognises\nthe connections between people, their social relations, and their social\nembedment. Similarly, a social policy focussing on and targeting certain\ngroups or communities can be perfectly compatible with normative\nindividualism.\nAs I argued in section 2.6.8, the capability approach embraces\nnormative individualism \u2014 and this is, for reasons given there, a\ndesirable property. However, it also follows from the discussion on the\nimportance of structural constraints (section 2.7.5) that the capability\napproach does not rely on ontological individualism.\nClearly, scholars have divergent (implicit) social theories, and\nhence some attach more importance to social structures than others do.\nNevertheless, I fail to see how the capability approach can be understood\nto be methodologically or ontologically individualistic, especially since\nSen himself has analysed some processes that are profoundly collective,\nsuch as his analysis of households as sites of cooperative conflict (1990a).\nIn later work too, he acknowledged persons as socially embedded, as\nthe following quote from his joint work illustrates:\nThe [capability] approach used in this study is much concerned with the\nopportunities that people have to improve the quality of their lives. It\nis essentially a \u2018people-centered\u2019 approach, which puts human agency\n(rather than organizations such as markets or governments) at the\ncentre of the stage. The crucial role of social opportunities is to expand\nthe realm of human agency and freedom, both as an end in itself and\nas a means of further expansion of freedom. The word \u2018social\u2019 in the\nexpression \u2018social opportunity\u2019 [\u2026] is a useful reminder not to view\nindividuals and their opportunities in isolated terms. The options that a\nperson has depend greatly on relations with others and on what the state\nand other institutions do. We shall be particularly concerned with those\nopportunities that are strongly influenced by social circumstances and\npublic policy [\u2026]. (Dr\u00e8ze and Sen 2002: 6) 186 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nOf course, the critique is not only (and also not primarily) about Sen\u2019s\nwork, but about the capability approach in general, or about capability\ntheories. But the work done by other scholars similarly doesn\u2019t meet\nthe criteria for being plausibly considered to be methodologically or\nontologically individualistic. In general, we can say that the capability\napproach acknowledges some non-individual structures, and for the\nvarious more specific capability theories, the degree to which they move\naway from methodological or ontological individualism depends on the\nchoices made in modules B and C. But whatever those choices are, there\nare already some features in module A that prevent capability theories\nfrom being methodologically or ontologically individualistic.\n4.6.2 Does the capability approach\npay sufficient attention to groups?\nThe critique that the capability approach should focus more on groups\nis often related to the critique that the focus of the capability approach\nis too individualistic, but it is nevertheless a distinct critique. A clear\nexample can be found in the work of Frances Stewart (2005), who argues\nthat in order to understand processes that affect the lives of people, such\nas violent conflict, one has to look at group capabilities \u2014 which she\ndefines as the average of the individual capabilities of all the individuals\nin the selected group. The reason we need to focus on these \u2018group\ncapabilities\u2019 is because they are a central source of group conflict. They\nare thus crucial to understand processes such as violent conflict.\nWe will return to Stewart\u2019s specific complaint below, but first\nunpack the general critique that the capability approach doesn\u2019t pay\nenough attention to groups. To properly judge the critique that the\ncapability approach does not pay sufficient attention to groups, we need\nto distinguish between a weaker and a stronger version of that claim.\nA stronger version of that claim would be that the capability approach\ncannot pay sufficient attention to groups \u2014 that there is something\nin the conceptual apparatus of the capability approach that makes it\nimpossible for the capability approach to pay attention to groups. But\nthat claim is obviously false, because there exists a large literature of\nresearch analysing the average capabilities of one group compared to 4. Critiques and Debates 187\nanother, e.g. women and men (Kynch and Sen 1983; Nussbaum 2000;\nRobeyns 2003, 2006a) or the disabled versus those without disabilities\n(Kuklys 2005; Zaidi and Burchardt 2005). Capability theorists have\nalso written on the importance of groups for people\u2019s wellbeing, like\nNussbaum\u2019s discussion of women\u2019s collectives in India. Several lists of\ncapabilities that have been proposed in the literature include capabilities\nrelated to community membership: Nussbaum stresses affiliation as\nan architectonic capability, Alkire (2002) discusses relationships and\nparticipation, and in earlier work I have included social relationships\n(Robeyns 2003). The UNDP (1995, 2004) has produced Human\nDevelopment Reports on both gender and culture, thus policy reports\nbased on the capability approach focus on groups.\nThe weaker claim states that the present state of the literature on the\ncapability approach does not pay sufficient attention to groups. I agree\nthat contemporary mainstream economics is very badly equipped to\naccount for group membership on people\u2019s wellbeing. But is this also\nthe case for the capability approach? While some capability theorists\nhave a great faith in people\u2019s abilities to be rational and to resist social\nand moral pressure stemming from groups (e.g. Sen 1999b, 2009b),\nother writers on the capability approach pay much more attention to\nthe influence of social norms and other group-based processes on our\nchoices and, ultimately, on our wellbeing (e.g. Alkire 2002; Nussbaum\n2000; Iversen 2003; Robeyns 2003a). There is thus no reason why the\ncapability approach would not be able to take the normative and\nconstitutive importance of groups fully into account. Admittedly,\nhowever, this is a theoretical choice that needs to be made when making\nscholarly decisions in modules B3, B5 and C1, hence we may not agree\nwith the assumptions about groups in each and every capability theory.\nIf we return to the reasons Stewart gave for a focus on group\ncapabilities, we notice that the main reason stated is that analysis\nof group capabilities is needed to understand outcomes. Yet that is\nprecisely what the just mentioned capability applications do (since\nthey do not only measure group inequalities in capabilities but also try\nto understand them). Those applications also investigate how group\nidentities constrain groups to different degrees, or which privileges\nthey ensure for certain groups. In my reading of the literature, many 188 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\ncapability scholars do precisely this kind of work, and to the extent\nthat they do not do so, one important reason is that they are engaging\nin documenting and measuring inequalities, rather than in explaining\nthem. The complaint should then be that capability analysis should\nbe less concerned with documenting and measuring inequalities, and\nshould spend more time on understanding how inequalities emerge,\nare sustained, and can be decreased \u2014 but that is another complaint.\nStill, I do think that a consideration of the role of groups in the capability\napproach gives us a warning. To fully understand the importance of\ngroups, capability theories should engage more intensively in a dialogue\nwith disciplines such as sociology, anthropology, history, and gender\nand cultural studies. This will make the choices of the account of human\ndiversity (module B3), the account of structural constraints (module B5),\nand of ontological and explanatory theories (module C1) more accurate.\nDisciplinary boundaries and structures make these kinds of dialogues\ndifficult, but there is no inherent reason why this could not be done.\n4.6.3 Social structures, norms and institutions\nin the capability approach\nThe critique that the capability approach is too individualistic is\nsometimes also put in another way, namely that the capability approach\nshould pay more attention to collective features, such as social structures,\nsocial norms, and institutions. How can the capability approach account\nfor such collective aspects of human living?\nAt the theoretical level, the capability approach does account\nfor social relations and the constraints and opportunities of societal\nstructures and institutions on individuals in two ways. First, by\nrecognising the social and environmental factors which influence the\nconversions of commodities into functionings. For example, suppose\nthat Jaap and Joseph both have the same individual conversion factors\nand possess the same commodities. But Jaap is living in a town with\ncycle lanes and low criminality rates, whereas Joseph is living in a city\nwith poor infrastructure for cyclists, and with high levels of criminality\nand theft. Whereas Jaap can use his bike to cycle anywhere he wants, at\nany moment of the day, Joseph will be faced with a much higher chance\nthat his bike will be stolen. Hence, the same commodity (a bike) leads 4. Critiques and Debates 189\nto different levels of the functioning \u2018to transport oneself safely\u2019, due to\ncharacteristics of the society in which one lives (its public infrastructure,\ncrime levels etc).\nThe second way in which the capability approach accounts for\nsocietal structures and constraints is by theoretically distinguishing\nfunctionings from capabilities. More precisely, moving from capabilities\nto achieved functionings requires an act of choice. Now, it is perfectly\npossible to take into account the influence of societal structures and\nconstraints on those choices, by choosing a nuanced and rich account\nof agency (module B4 \u2014 account of agency) and of societal structures\n(module B5 \u2014 account of structural constraints). For example, suppose\nSarah and Sigal both have the same intellectual capacities and human\ncapital at the age of six, and live in a country where education is free\nand children from poorer families receive scholarships. Sarah was born\nin a class in which little attention was paid to intellectual achievement\nand studying, whereas Sigal\u2019s parents are both graduates pursuing\nintellectual careers. The social environment in which Sarah and Sigal\nlive will greatly influence and shape their preferences for studying. In\nother words, while initially Sarah and Sigal have the same capability\nset, the social structures and constraints that influence and shape\ntheir preferences will influence the choice they will make to pick one\nbundle of functionings. The capability approach allows us to take those\nstructures and constraints on choices into account, but whether a\nparticular capability theory will take that into account depends on the\nchoices made in the various modules, especially modules B4 and B5. Yet\nit is clear that the choices made in modules B and C will have ultimately\nfar reaching consequences for our capabilitarian evaluations.\nSumming up, one could, plausibly, complain that a certain capability\ntheory doesn\u2019t pay sufficient attention to social structures or collective\nfeatures of human life. This may well be a very valid critique of a\nparticular capability theory in which the additional theories of human\ndiversity, social structures, and other social theories more generally, are\nvery minimal (that is, the explanatory and ontological theories added\nin C1 do not properly account for many collective features of life). But I\nhave argued that it is not a valid critique against the capability approach\nin general. 190 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\n4.7 What about power and political economy?\nIn section 4.6, I analysed the critique that the capability approach\nis too individualistic, and argued that this charge is based on a\nmisunderstanding of different distinct types of individualism, as well\nas a flawed (and unduly limited) understanding of the potential for\ncapability theories to include social structures as factors that explain\nvarying levels of advantage between different people. However, there\nare two closely related critiques that must be addressed briefly: first, that\nthe capability approach downplays power and social structures, and\nsecond, that capability theories divert our attention from the political\neconomy of poverty and inequality, which is much more important\nthan the measurement and evaluation of poverty and inequality. Let us\nanalyse these two critiques in turn.\n4.7.1 Which account of power and choice?\nThe first worry is that the capability approach is insufficiently critical of\nsocial constraints on people\u2019s actions, and does not pay due attention to\n\u201cglobal forces of power and local systems of oppression\u201d (Koggel 2003).\nPut differently, the worry is that the capability approach does not pay\nsufficient attention to inequalities in power (Hill 2003). Similarly, there is\nalso a worry that the capability approach could be used in combination\nwith a stripped-down version of human choice. For example, despite\nSen\u2019s repeated criticism of choice as revealed preference, one could in\nprinciple make interpersonal comparisons of functionings that assume\nrevealed preference theory: a person will choose from their option\nset what is best for them. But this ignores the fact that our choices are\nheavily influenced by patterns of expectations and social norms,7 as\nwell as commitments we have to certain interests that do not necessarily\naffect our own advantage.8 Depending on the choice theory one adopts,\nthe capability approach could lead to widely divergent normative\nconclusions (Robeyns 2000; 2001). Standard economics pays very little\nattention to the social and cultural constraints that impinge on people\u2019s\n7 O n the importance of social norms in explaining a person\u2019s choice and behaviour,\nsee e.g. Elster (1989); Anderson (2000a).\n8 O n commitment, see e.g. Sen (1977a, 1985b); Cudd (2014). 4. Critiques and Debates 191\nchoices, in contrast to sociology, gender studies and cultural studies,\namong other disciplines. In political philosophy, one sees a similar split\nbetween the core of Anglo-American political philosophy, in which the\nconcept of the self that is endorsed is that of a rational, autonomous\nagent whose own plans take precedence over things he finds as \u2018given\u2019\nin his life, versus other traditions in philosophy that pay more attention\nto relations and the social embedding of individuals, including unjust\nstructures in which one finds oneself, as well as mechanisms that\nreproduce power differences. The consequence is that it is possible to\nuse functionings and capabilities as the evaluative space in combination\nwith many different normative accounts of choice, with a widely\ndivergent critical content.\nTake as an example the choices made by men versus women between\npaid (labour market) or unpaid (care and household) work. In all societies\nwomen do much more household and care work, whereas men do much\nmore paid work. Both kinds of work can generate a number of different\nfunctionings so that the largest capability set might perhaps be reached\nonly by giving everyone the opportunity to combine both types of work.\nHowever, I would argue that in the world today, in which hardly any\nsociety allows people to combine market work and non-market work\nwithout having to make significant compromises when it comes to the\nquality of at least one of them, the labour market enables more (and more\nimportant) functionings than care work. These include psychological\nfunctionings like increased self-esteem; social functionings like having a\nsocial network; material functionings like being financially independent\nand securing one\u2019s financial needs for one\u2019s old age or in the event of\ndivorce.9 Many schools in political philosophy and normative welfare\neconomics have typically seen the gender division of labour as ethically\nunproblematic, in the sense that this division is seen as the result of\nmen\u2019s and women\u2019s voluntary choices, which reflect their preferences.\nHowever, this is an inadequate way of explaining and evaluating this\ndivision, because gender-related structures and constraints convert\nthis choice from an individual choice under perfect information into a\ncollective decision under socially constructed constraints with imperfect\ninformation and asymmetrical risks. Moreover, evaluating the gender\n9 As is also suggested by the empirical findings of Enrica Chiappero-Martinetti\n(2000) who measured achieved functioning levels for Italy. 192 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\ndivision of labour can only be done if we scrutinise the constraints on\nchoice, and these may turn out to be very different for men and women.10\nWhat is crucial for the discussion here is that both positive theories\nof the gender division of labour (which are choices made in modules\nB3, B4, and B5) bear different normative implications. If a housewife\nis held fully responsible for the fact that she works at home then the\nlogical consequence would be that she had the capability to work in the\nlabour market. However, if we embrace a theory of choice that focuses\non gender specific constraints, then we will not hold the housewife\nfully responsible for her choice but acknowledge that her capability set\nwas smaller and did not contain the possibility for a genuine choice to\nwork in the labour market. It seems, thus, that it is perfectly possible to\napply the capability approach in combination with different accounts of\ngender-specific constraints on choices.\nBy giving choice such a central position and making its place in\nwellbeing and social justice evaluations more explicit, the capability\napproach opens up a space for discussions of how certain choices are\nconstrained by gender-related societal mechanisms and expectations.\nBut again, the capability approach provides no guarantee for this:\nit depends on the choices made in modules B and C. For example,\nconservatives will want to integrate a conservative theory of gender\nrelations within the capability approach, whereas for critical scholars it\nwill be crucial to integrate a feminist account of gender relations, which\nincludes an account of power. No doubt the two exercises will reach\nvery different normative conclusions. In short, for scholars who defend\na theory of human agency and social reality that challenges the status\nquo, one of the important tasks will be to negotiate which additional\ntheories will be integrated in further specifications of the capability\napproach, especially the choices made in module C1.\nThe conclusion is that the core characteristics of the capability\napproach (as listed in module A) do not necessarily have significant\nimplications for the role of power in capability theories and applications,\nwhich can include widely divergent views on social realities and\ninterpersonal relations. Indeed, the fact that the capability approach\n10 The seminal work in this area is Susan Okin\u2019s book Justice, Gender and the Family\n(Okin 1989). On the gendered nature of the constraints on choice, see also Nancy\nFolbre (1994). 4. Critiques and Debates 193\ninterests both scholars who work in the libertarian tradition, as well as\nscholars who work in more critical traditions, illustrate this conclusion.\nMy own personal conviction is that there is ample reason why we\nshould not adopt a stripped-down view of the roles of social categories\nand social structures, and hence include a rich account of power that\nis supported by research in anthropology, sociology and other social\nsciences. But for everyone advancing a capability theory or application,\nit holds that they should defend their implicit social theories, and be\nwilling to scrutinize them critically.\n4.7.2 Should we prioritise analysing\nthe political economy?\nCapability scholars have been criticised for having the wrong priorities:\nby focusing so much on the metric of justice and on human diversity\nin the conversion of resources into capabilities, their approach\ndraws attention away from huge inequalities in terms of resources\n(income, wealth) and therefore helps to preserve the (unjust) status\nquo. Thomas Pogge (2002) has specifically argued that the capability\napproach \u2014 Sen\u2019s work in particular \u2014 overemphasises the role of\nnational and local governments, thereby neglecting the huge injustices\ncreated by the global economic system and its institutional structures,\nsuch as global trade rules. Similarly, Alison Jaggar (2002, 2006) has\nargued that western philosophers, and Martha Nussbaum\u2019s work on\nthe capability approach in particular, should not prioritise the analysis\nof cultural factors constraining poor women\u2019s lives, or listing what an\nideal account of flourishing and justice would look like, but rather focus\non the global economic order and other processes by which the rich\ncountries are responsible for global poverty.\nPogge and Jaggar may have a point in their charge that capability\ntheorists have paid insufficient attention to these issues, which have\nbeen discussed at length in the philosophical literature on global justice.\nBut one might also argue that this is orthogonal to the issues about which\nthe capability approach to social justice is most concerned, namely, how\nto make interpersonal comparisons of advantage for the purposes of\nsocial justice. One could, quite plausibly, hold the view that, since most\ncapability theorists are concerned with human wellbeing, they should 194 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\ninvest their energies in addressing the most urgent cases of injustice,\ninvestigate their underlying causal processes and mechanisms, and\nconcentrate on the development of solutions. Using the modular view\nof the capability approach, this critique boils down to the view that\nwe should concentrate on modules outside the core, namely those that\nexplain certain unjust structures.\nThis is not, however, a valid critique of the capability approach as a\ngeneral framework, nor does it recognise the role that capability theories\ncan play in substantive debates about global justice and inequality.\nRather, the critique should be reformulated to say that the most urgent\nissues of justice do not require theories of justice, but rather a political\nand economic analysis of unjust structures. But then we are no longer\nfacing a critique of the capability approach, but rather a critique of our\nresearch priorities, which goes beyond the scope of this book.11 It is clear\nthat the capability approach will not solve all the world\u2019s problems,\nand that we should regard it as a tool to help us in analysing cases that\nneed our attention, rather than an intellectual project that has become\nan end in itself for academics. However, it doesn\u2019t follow therefore that\nall scholars developing the capability approach should become political\neconomists \u2014 or malaria researchers, for that matter.\n4.8 Is the capability approach a liberal theory?\nStudents of the capability approach often ask whether it is a liberal\ntheory \u2014 something those who ask that question seem to think is a bad\nthing. Given the various audiences and disciplines that engage with\nthe capability approach, there is a very high risk of misunderstandings\nof discipline-specific terms, such as \u2018liberal\u2019. Hence, let us answer the\nquestion: is the capability approach a liberal theory, and if so, in what\nsense?\nIn many capability theories and applications, including the work by\nAmartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum, there is a great stress on capabilities\nrather than functionings, as well as on agency and the power of people to\n11 Serene Khader (2011, 24\u201330) faces similar critiques in her study of adaptive\npreferences (rather than the global economic order), and provides a sensible\nresponse to those worries. 4. Critiques and Debates 195\nshape their own destinies.12 What is ultimately important is that people\nhave the freedoms (capabilities) to lead the kind of lives they want to\nlead, to do what they want to do and be the person they want to be.\nOnce they have these freedoms, they can choose to act on them in line\nwith their own ideas of the kind of life they want to live. For example,\nevery person should have the opportunity to be part of a community\nand to practice a religion, but if someone prefers to be a hermit or an\natheist, they should also have this option. Now, it is certainly true that\nindividual freedoms and agency are a hallmark of liberalism. But is this\nenough to conclude that the capability approach, in contrast to specific\ncapability theories, is a liberal framework?13\nFirst, given the interdisciplinary context in which the capability\napproach is operating, it is very important that the word \u2018liberal\u2019 is\nnot confused with the word \u2018liberal\u2019 in daily life. In ordinary language,\n\u2018liberal\u2019 has different political meanings in different countries, and\ncan cover both the political right or left. In addition it is often used to\nrefer to (neo)liberal economic policies that prioritise free markets and\nthe privatization of public companies such as water suppliers or the\nrailways. In contrast, philosophical liberalism is neither necessarily left\nor right, nor does it a priori advocate any social or economic policies.\nThe first misunderstanding to get out the way is that capabilities as\nfreedoms refer exclusively to the \u2018free market\u2019 and thus that the capability\napproach would always lead to an endorsement of (unfettered) markets\nas the institutions that are capabilities-enhancing. Sen does argue that\npeople have reason to value the freedom or liberty to produce, buy, and\nsell in markets. This point, however, is part of his more general work on\ndevelopment, and it is very different to the highly disputed question in\neconomics and politics regarding the benefits and limits of the market\nas a system of economic production and distribution. Functionings\nand capabilities are conceptualizations of wellbeing achievements and\nwellbeing freedoms, and the question of which economic institutions\nare the best institutional means to foster functionings and capabilities\n12 Sen\u2019s work on identity testifies to the great faith he puts in people\u2019s power to choose\nwhether or not to adopt certain group memberships and identities. See e.g. Sen\n(2009b).\n13 In earlier work, I argued that on those grounds we could conclude that the capability\napproach is a liberal theory. I now think this conclusion was premature. 196 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nis both analytically and politically a question that can only be settled\nafter we first agree what economic outcomes we should be aiming for: a\nquestion to which the capability approach gives a (partial) answer.\nThe question of what are the appropriate institutions to lead to\ncapability expansions is a separate one, which cannot be answered by\nthe capability approach in itself; it must be coupled with a political\neconomy analysis. However, there is nothing in the (limited) literature\nthat has undertaken this task so far to suggest that a capability analysis\nwould recommend unfettered markets \u2014 quite the contrary, as the\nwork by Rutger Claassen (2009, 2015) shows: capabilities theories give\nreasons for regulating markets, and for constraining property rights.\nIn sum, if the word \u2018liberal\u2019 is used to refer to \u2018neoliberalism\u2019 or to\n\u2018economic liberalization policies\u2019, then neither the capability approach\nin general, nor Sen and Nussbaum\u2019s more specific theories, are liberal\nin that sense.\nYet I believe it is correct to say that Sen and Nussbaum\u2019s writings\non the capability approach are liberal in the philosophical sense, which\nrefers to a philosophical tradition that values individual autonomy\nand freedom.14 However, even philosophical liberalism is a very broad\nchurch, and Sen and Nussbaum\u2019s theories arguably participate in a\ncritical strand within it, since the explanatory theories that they use in\ntheir capability theories (that is, the choices they make in module C1),\nare in various ways aware of social structures.\nThird, while the particular capability theories advocated by Sen\nand Nussbaum aspire to be liberal, it is possible to construct capability\ntheories that are much less so. Take a capability theory that opts in\nmodule C1 for (1) a highly structuralist account of social conditions,\nand (2) theories of bounded rationality, that place great emphasis on\npeople\u2019s structural irrationalities in decision-making. In module C4, the\ntheory accepts some degree of paternalism due to the acknowledgement\nof bounded rationality in decision-making. Similarly, one could have a\ncapability theory of social justice that argues that the guiding principle\nin institutional design should be the protection of the vulnerable, rather\n14 Nussbaum (2011b, 2014) has written explicitly on the type of liberalism that her\ncapabilities approach endorses: political liberalism. For arguments that Nussbaum\u2019s\ncapability approach is, upon closer scrutiny, not politically liberal but rather\nperfectionist liberal, see Barclay (2003), and Nussbaum (2003b) for a response. 4. Critiques and Debates 197\nthan the maximal accommodation of the development of people\u2019s\nagency. Such theories would already be much less liberal.\nIs it possible for capability theories to be non-liberal? This would\nprobably depend on where exactly one draws the line between a liberal\nand a non-liberal theory, or, formulated differently, which properties\nwe take to be necessary properties of a theory in order for that theory\nto qualify as \u2018liberal\u2019. The capability approach draws a clear line at\nthe principle of each person as an end, that is, in the endorsement of\nnormative individualism. The principle of normative individualism is\nclearly a core principle of liberal theories. Yet it is also a core principle\nof some non-liberal theories that do not give higher priority to agency\nor autonomy (e.g. capability theories that merge insights from care\nethics, and which give moral priority to protecting the vulnerable\nover enhancing and protecting agency). However, if a theory endorses\nfunctionings and/or capabilities as the relevant normative metric, yet\nviolates the principle of each person as an end, it would not only not\nqualify as a liberal theory, but it would also not qualify as a capability\ntheory. At best, it would qualify as e.g. a hybrid capabilitarian-\ncommunitarian theory.\n4.9 Why \u2018human development\u2019 is\nnot the same idea\nSome believe that the terms \u2018human development approach\u2019 and \u2018the\ncapability approach\u2019 are synonymous, or else scholars talk about the\n\u2018capability and human development approach\u2019. Although I will argue\nthat this usage is misleading, the equation of \u2018human development\u2019\nwith \u2018capability approach\u2019 is often made. Why is this the case? And is\nthat equation a good thing?\nFirst, the Human Development Reports and their best-known\nindex, the Human Development Index, have been vastly influential in\nmaking the case for the capability approach, and in spreading the idea\nof \u2018functionings\u2019 and \u2018capabilities\u2019 both inside and outside academia\n(UNDP 1990). In other words, one of the main series of publications\nwithin the human development approach, and the corresponding\nanalyses and indexes, is arguably one of the most politically successful\napplications of the capability approach. However, it doesn\u2019t follow from\nthis that they are the same thing. 198 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nA second possible explanation for this misleading equation is that\nboth the international association and the current name of the main\njournal in the field have merged both terms: the Human Development\nand Capability Association (HDCA) and the Journal of Human Development\nand Capabilities. This seems to suggest that \u2018human development\u2019 and\n\u2018capabilities\u2019 necessarily go together. But this need not be the case: the\nuse of a particular title doesn\u2019t make the two things the same (and in a\nmoment, I will give a few examples in which this isn\u2019t the case).\nThirdly and most importantly, the equation of \u2018human development\napproach\u2019 and \u2018capability approach\u2019 shouldn\u2019t be surprising because\nhuman development aims to shift the focus of our evaluation of the\nquality of life and the desirability of social arrangements, from material\nresources or mental states to people\u2019s functionings and capabilities. The\ncapability approach is thus a central and indispensable element of the\nhuman development paradigm.\nFinally, one may believe that the two terms are equivalent given that\nsome influential authors in the capability literature equate the two terms,\nor merge them into one idea (Alkire and Deneulin 2009a, 2009b; Fukuda-\nParr 2009; Nussbaum 2011). Let me highlight two examples. Sabina Alkire\nand S\u00e9verine Deneulin (2009a, 2009b) do not distinguish between the\nreach of the capability approach and the human development approach;\ninstead, they merge them into one term, \u201cthe human development and\ncapability approach\u201d. More recently, Martha Nussbaum (2011) has\nwritten on the distinction in her Creating Capabilities. Nussbaum has\nsuggested that \u2018human development approach\u2019 is mainly associated,\nhistorically, with the Human Development Reports, and that the term\n\u2018capability approach\u2019 is more commonly used in academia. Nussbaum\nprefers the term \u2018capabilities approach\u2019 since she also likes to include\nnon-human animals in her account. However, for those of us, like\nme, who are using the capability approach to analyse and evaluate\nthe quality of life as well as the living arrangements of human beings,\nthis is not a valid reason to make the distinction between \u2018the human\ndevelopment approach\u2019, and \u2018the capability approach\u2019.\nSo, should we use \u2018human development approach\u2019 and \u2018capability\napproach\u2019 as synonyms, and merge them together into \u2018the human\ndevelopment and capability approach\u2019? I believe we shouldn\u2019t. I think 4. Critiques and Debates 199\nthere are at least four valid reasons why we should make a distinction\nbetween the two ideas.\nThe first reason is historical: while the capability approach has\nbeen very important in the development of the human development\nparadigm, the human development paradigm has derived insights\nand concepts from several other theories and frameworks. Human\ndevelopment has been defined as \u201can expansion of human capabilities,\na widening of choices, an enhancement of freedoms and a fulfilment\nof human rights\u201d (Fukuda-Parr and Kumar 2003, xxi). There are\nimportant historical ideas in the human development paradigm that\nare to a significant extent based on Sen\u2019s capability approach. And Sen\nwas closely involved in the development of the Human Development\nReports that have been key in the maturing of the human development\nparadigm. Yet as some key contributors to this paradigm have rightly\npointed out, it had other intellectual roots too, such as the basic needs\napproach (Streeten 1995; Fukuda-Parr 2003; Sen 2003a).\nThe second reason is intellectual. The capability approach is used for\na very wide range of purposes, as the account I presented in chapter 2\nmakes amply clear. These include purposes that are only tangentially, or\nvery indirectly, related to human development concerns. For example,\nthe philosopher Martin van Hees (2013) is interested in the structural\nproperties of capabilities, especially how the formal analysis of rights\nfits into the capability concept. This research allows us to see how\ncapabilities, as a concept, would fit in, and relate to, the existing literature\non the structure of rights. But it would be a big stretch to say that this is\nalso a contribution to the human development literature; in fact, I would\nfind such a statement an implausible inflation of what we understand\nby \u2018human development\u2019. Rather, it is much more plausible to say that\nthe study by Van Hees is a contribution to the capability literature, but\nnot to the human development literature. If we were wrongly to equate\nthe capability approach with the human development paradigm, this\nwould create problems for understanding such a study as part of the\ncapability approach.\nThe third reason is practical. Those who have written about the\nhuman development paradigm stress that \u2018development\u2019 is about all\npeople and all countries, and not only about countries which are often 200 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\ncalled \u2018developing countries\u2019, that is, countries with a much higher\nincidence of absolute poverty, and often with a less developed economic\ninfrastructure. For example, Paul Streeten (1995, viii) writes:\nWe defined human development as widening the range of people\u2019s\nchoices. Human development is a concern not only for poor countries and\npoor people, but everywhere. In the high-income countries, indicators of\nshortfalls in human development should be looked for in homelessness,\ndrug addiction, crime, unemployment, urban squalor; environmental\ndegradation, personal insecurity and social disintegration.\nThe inclusion of all human beings within the scope of \u2018human\ndevelopment thinking\u2019 is widely endorsed within human development\nscholarship and policy reports. However, it is also a matter of fact that\nmost people, including policy makers, associate the term \u2018development\u2019\nnot with improvements to the lives of people living in high-income\ncountries. This is unfortunate, but it is a fact one needs to reckon with. In\nhigh-income countries, some of the terms often used for what could also\nbe called \u2018human development interventions\u2019 are \u2018policies\u2019, \u2018institutional\ndesign\u2019, or \u2018social transformations\u2019. While it is laudable to deconstruct\nthe term \u2018development\u2019, at the same time we should be careful about\nusing words that would lead to scholars and policy makers in high-\nincome countries to neglect the capability approach if they (mistakenly)\nbelieve that it is a framework only suitable for \u2018developing countries\u2019 (as\nthey would use the term).\nThe final reason is political. There are many capability scholars\nwho would like to develop an alternative to neoliberalism, or, more\nspecifically when it concerns development policies, to the \u2018Washington\nconsensus\u2019. While more sophisticated analyses of both doctrines have\nbeen put forward, both doctrines focus on private property rights; the\nprimacy of markets as an allocation mechanism; the focus in macro-\neconomic policies on controlling inflation and reducing fiscal deficits;\neconomic liberalisation with regard to free trade and capital flows;\nand, overall, restricted and reduced involvement of governments in\nthe domestic economy, such as markets in labour, land and capital (the\nso-called \u2018factor markets\u2019) (Gore 2000; Fukuda-Parr 2003; McCleery and\nDe Paolis 2008). The \u2018Washington consensus\u2019 refers to the development 4. Critiques and Debates 201\npolicy views propagated by the World Bank and the International\nMonetary Fund (two international institutions based in Washington,\nD.C., hence its name). The ideas of the Washington consensus spread in\nthe 1980s and were endorsed as the consensus view by the IMF and the\nWorld Bank by 1990, and they dominated for at least two decades. Over\nthe last decade, neoliberalism and the Washington consensus have been\nheavily criticised from many different corners, and there is a renewed\nrecognition of the importance of considering the historical, cultural\nand institutional specificity of countries when deciding what good\ndevelopment policies look like; but it seems too early to conclude that\nany of those alternative views is now more influential then neoliberalism\nand the Washington consensus. Many citizens, scholars, policy makers\nand politicians are searching for alternatives, and some hope that the\ncapability approach can offer such an alternative.\nMy suggestion would be that if one\u2019s goal is to develop a powerful\nalternative to neoliberalism and the Washington consensus, one has to\nlook at the human development paradigm, rather than the capability\napproach. The human development paradigm includes many specific\nexplanatory theories that stress the importance of historical paths and\nlocal cultural and social norms in understanding development outcomes\nand options in a particular country. The human development paradigm\nis, therefore, much more powerful than the capability approach for this\nspecific purpose.\nRecall the modular view of the capability approach that I presented\nin chapter 2. The human development paradigm is a capabilitarian\ntheory or capability application, because it endorses all the elements\nfrom module A. In addition, it has made particular choices in modules\nB, such as a strong notion of agency (B3) as well as an elaborate account\nof social structures (B4), and, importantly, it has chosen anti-neoliberal\nontological accounts of human nature and explanatory theories about\nhow the economy and societies work (C1), as well as the endorsement\nof additional normative principle and social ideals (C4) such as human\nrights and ecological sustainability. Hence the human development\nparadigm is much more powerful as a policy paradigm than the\ncapability approach, since it is much more comprehensive (taking\nmany more aspects into account then merely people\u2019s functionings and 202 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\ncapabilities) and it is much more powerful in policy or political terms\n(being informed about what works and what doesn\u2019t).\nIn sum, I think it is not correct to equate the capability approach\nand the human development approach. The two are theoretically and\nhistorically related, but they are not exactly the same. For those who work\nwithin development studies and are endorsing a critical assessment of\nthe development policies that have been pursued as part of the so-called\n\u2018Washington consensus\u2019, it is understandable that the two may seem to\nbe the same, or at least so close that they can be merged. But that is only\nif one looks at the two notions from a specific perspective. Merging the\ntwo would do injustice to the work of other thinkers using the capability\napproach, and it would also ultimately hamper the development of the\ncapability approach over its full scope.\n4.10 Can the capability approach\nchange welfare economics?\nOf all the (sub)disciplines where the capability approach is relevant,\nwelfare economics may well be the one where it is most difficult\nto describe its impact. The reason is that the capability approach\ncould be seen in two very different lights, depending on one\u2019s own\nposition towards the current state of economics: either as an improved\nmodification of mainstream welfare economics, or else as a path that\ncould lead us to a very different type of welfare economics, which would\nradically break with some mainstream assumptions and practices.\nOne could say that the welfare economists interested in the capability\napproach have two very different agendas: the first group only wants\nsome changes in the normative focus, and possibly in some of the\nontological and behavioural assumptions in the theory development,\nbut no methodological or meta-theoretical changes, whereas the second\ngroup wants a paradigm change or a scientific revolution, in which there\nwould be meta-theoretical and methodological pluralism (module B7)\nand much richer or thicker accounts of human agency (module B3) and\nstructural constraints (module B5). In addition, it makes a difference\nwhether we analyse the possibilities for a capabilitarian theoretical\nwelfare economics or for a capabilitarian empirical welfare economics. 4. Critiques and Debates 203\n4.10.1 Welfare economics and the economics discipline\nBefore analysing the reach and limit of the capability approach in\nthese various endeavours, a few general comments are in order\nabout economics in general, and welfare economics in particular.\nLet us first ask: what is welfare economics? As Sen (1996, 50) writes,\n\u201cWelfare economics deals with the basis of normative judgements,\nthe foundations of evaluative measurement, and the conceptual\nunderpinnings of policy-making in economics\u201d. While, in practice,\nmuch of the economics discipline is concerned with policy advice,\nwelfare economics is nevertheless a small subfield of economics, and\nis by some prominent welfare economists seen as unduly neglected\nor marginalised by mainstream economics (Atkinson 2001). One\nimportant reason is that welfare economics makes explicit the inevitable\nnormative dimensions of economic policy analysis and evaluations,\nand most economists have been socialised to believe that \u2018modern\neconomics\u2019 is value-free, and that anything to do with normativity can\nbe outsourced to ethics or to a democratic vote. In reality, however, the\nimaginary science-value split that mainstream economists would wish\nfor is, for many economic questions, impossible (Reiss 2013; Hausman,\nMcPherson and Satz 2016). It would therefore be much better to face\nthis inevitability upfront, and understand economics as a moral science\n(Boulding 1969; Atkinson 2009; Shiller and Shiller 2011) rather than as\napplied mathematics or a form of value-free modelling. But in economics,\nas in any other discipline, there are complicated sociological processes\nconveying views about authority and status, as well as unexamined\nbeliefs about what \u2018good science\u2019 is and which type of objectivity is most\ndesirable: one is not born an economist, but becomes one through one\u2019s\ntraining, which is in part also a socialisation process (Colander and\nKlamer 1987; McCloskey 1998; Nelson 2002). Unfortunately, there is\nempirical evidence that many economists are unwilling to engage with\nthese fundamental questions and hold on to the belief that economics\nis superior to other social sciences and has little to learn from other\ndisciplines (Fourcade, Ollion and Algan 2015). Many economists who\nare interested in economic questions but are not endorsing the myth\nof value-free social science, or who crave more methodological and\nmeta-theoretical freedom, have left for another discipline that offers 204 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nthem those liberties.15 After all, economists do not have a monopoly on\neconomic topics, and there are many questions about such topics that\nare analysed by economic sociologists, economic historians, political\neconomists, economic geographers, and economic philosophers. In my\nview, one cannot analyse the reach and limits of the capability approach\nin welfare economics if one does not acknowledge the high levels of\ndiscontent and methodological conservatism within economics, which\ncannot be found in any other discipline that engages with the capability\napproach.\nWith this background in mind, we can now proceed to ask whether\nthe capability approach can make a difference to welfare economics.\nFirst, in section 4.10.2, we will look at the main theoretical contribution\nof the capability approach to welfare economics: its contribution to the\ndevelopment of non-welfarist welfare economics. In section 4.10.3 we\nwill analyse what kind of empirical analyses a capabilitarian welfare\neconomics could make, and what its challenges and possibilities are.\nFinally, in section 4.10.4, we analyse what challenges the development\nof a heterodox capabilitarian welfare economics would face.\n4.10.2 Non-welfarism\nThe main theoretical contribution of the capability approach is that\nit contributes to the development of post-welfarism or non-welfarism in\nwelfare economics. Welfarism is the position that social welfare depends\nexclusively on individual utilities, which are either understood in a\nhedonic or in a desire-satisfaction sense, and this has been the dominant\nposition in economics for a long time. Post-welfarism broadens the\ninformational basis of interpersonal comparison with non-utility\ninformation, such as deontic rights, or objective information such as\npeople\u2019s functionings and capabilities. In a series of publications, Sen\nhas offered strong theoretical arguments to move from welfarism to\nnon-welfarism (sometimes also called \u2018post-welfarism\u2019) and has inspired\nother welfare economists to work on a post-welfarist welfare economics\n15 There are plenty of academic economists who have moved to history, development\nstudies or philosophy in order to enjoy the greater methodological and paradigmatic\nfreedoms in those disciplines. 4. Critiques and Debates 205\n(e.g. Gaertner and Xu 2006, 2008; Gotoh and Yoshihara 2003; Gotoh,\nSuzumura and Yoshihara 2005; Pattanaik 2006; Pattanaik and Xu 1990;\nSuzumura 2016; Xu 2002). Some reasons for this move are the same as the\narguments against desire-satisfaction theories or the happiness approach\nthat we reviewed earlier in sections 3.7 and 3.8. Another argument is\nthat relevant information is left out of the informational basis. If two social\nstates have exactly the same utility levels, but social state A has also\na set of legal and social norms that discriminate against one group of\npeople, whereas in social state B, the principles of moral equality and\nnon-discrimination are protected, then surely, we should prefer social\nstate B over social state A. But welfarism, because of its exclusive focus\non utilities, is unable to take any type of non-utility information into\naccount, whether it is the violation of deontic principles, information on\nrights, liberties and justice, or information on inefficient or unsustainable\nuse of common resources. Many of the welfare economists who have\nembarked on the development of a post-welfarist welfare economics\nhave focussed on the importance of freedom as an important part of the\nwidening of the informational basis.\nNon-welfarist welfare economics requires some changes to our\napproach to welfare economics. As Sen (1996, 58) noted in his discussion\nof the contribution of the capability approach to non-welfarist welfare\neconomics, if we move to an informational basis with multiple\ndimensions of different types (as in the capability approach) then this\nrequires explicit evaluations of the different weights to be given to the\ncontributions of the different functionings and capabilities to overall\n(aggregate) social welfare. For Sen, the way to proceed is by public\nreasoning about those weights. This should probably not be seen as the\nonly and exclusive way to determine them, since not all work in welfare\neconomics is suited for public discussion \u2014 for example, it often entails\ndesk-studies of inequalities or the analysis of the welfare effects of certain\npolicy measures, and it is practically impossible to organise an exercise\nof public reasoning for every desk study that welfare economists make.\nLuckily, as the survey by Decancq and Lugo (2013) shows, there are\nvarious weighting systems possible that can give us the weights that are\nneeded if one wants to aggregate the changes in different functionings\nand capabilities. For example, Erik Schokkaert (2007) has suggested that\nwe derive the weights of the functionings from the contribution they 206 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nmake to the life-satisfaction of people, after those weights are cleaned of\nethically suspicious information.\nHowever, as we saw in section 4.10.1, many (possibly most)\neconomists are unwilling to engage in explicit evaluations, since they\nbelieve in the science/value split and believe that economics can be\nvalue-free. This makes it harder for welfare economics to engage in such\nnormative work, since they run the risk that their peers will no longer\naccept their approach as \u2018economics research\u2019. But it is inconsistent to\nreject all explicit evaluative exercises. Economists are happy working\nwith GNP per capita and real income metrics as proxies of welfare,\nwhich uses market prices as the weights. But this is equally normative:\nit is assumed that the welfare-value of a certain good for a person is\nreflected by the price that the good commands on the market. This is\nproblematic, for reasons that have been explained repeatedly in the\nliterature. For one thing, market prices reflect demand and supply\n(and thus relative scarcity of a good) \u2014 diamonds are expensive and\nwater (in non-drought-affected places) is cheap \u2014 but this doesn\u2019t say\nanything about their importance for our wellbeing. Moreover, market\nprices do not take into account negative or positive welfare effects on\nthird parties, the so-called externalities, despite their omnipresence\n(Hausman 1992).\nOf course, it may be that, upon reflection of the various weights\navailable, some capability theorists will conclude that the set of\nmarket prices, possibly combined with shadow prices for non-market\ngoods, is the best way to proceed. That is quite possible, and would\nnot be inconsistent with the general claim in the capability approach\nthat weights need to be chosen. The point is rather that the choice of\nweights needs to be done in a reflective way, rather than simply using the\nweighing scheme that is dominant or customary. I take it that this is the\npoint Sen is trying to make when he argues that \u201cWelfare economics is\na major branch of \u2018practical reason\u2019\u201d (Sen 1996, 61).16\n16 Note also that for welfare economists, an important concern in examining and\ndeveloping a capabilitarian welfare economics will be the question of how it can be\nformalized. On formalizations of the capability approach, see Sen (1985a); Kuklys\nand Robeyns (2005); Basu and L\u00f3pez-Calva (2011); Bleichrodt and Quiggin (2013). 4. Critiques and Debates 207\n4.10.3 Empirical possibilities and challenges\nWhen Amartya Sen introduced the capability approach in economics,\nthere was some scepticism about its potential for empirical research. For\nexample, Robert Sugden (1993, 1953) famously wrote:\nGiven the rich array of functionings that Sen takes to be relevant, given\nthe extent of disagreement among reasonable people about the nature\nof the good life, and given the unresolved problem of how to value\nsets, it is natural to ask how far Sen\u2019s framework is operational. Is it\na realistic alternative to the methods on which economists typically\nrely \u2014 measurement of real income, and the kind of practical cost-benefit\nanalysis which is grounded in Marshallian consumer theory?\nWhat Sugden and other early welfare economic critics of the capability\napproach, such as John Roemer (1996, 191\u201393) were looking for, is\na theory that is fully formalised and provides a neat algorithm to\naddress questions of evaluation and/or (re-)distribution, resulting in\na complete ranking of options. That requires two things: first, to be\nable to put the capability approach in a fully formalized model which\ncan be econometrically estimated. This requires us to move beyond\nthe welfare economic models as we know them, and may also require\nthe collection of new data (Kuklys 2005). In addition, it requires us to\naccept that the different dimensions (functionings and/or capabilities)\nare commensurable, that is, have a common currency that allows us to\nexpress the value of one unit of one dimension in relation to the value\nof one unit of another dimension. One-dimensional or aggregated\nevaluative spaces are, ultimately, a necessary condition for conducting\nempirical work in contemporary mainstream welfare economics. Yet\nthere may well be a trade-off between the number of dimensions and the\ninformational richness of the evaluative space on the one hand, and the\ndegree to which the theory can be formalised and can provide complete\norderings of interpersonal comparisons on the other hand. Some\nwelfare economists are working on the question of how to aggregate\nthe many dimensions such that one has, in the end, one composite\ndimension to work with, but it should be obvious that this is not the\nonly way to develop capabilitarian welfare economics. The alternative\nis to stick to the view that wellbeing is inherently multidimensional, 208 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nwhich requires other methods and techniques that allow for fuzziness,\nvagueness and complexity (Chiappero-Martinetti 2008, 2000, 1994, 2006;\nClark and Qizilbash 2005; Qizilbash and Clark 2005). One could also\nadvance work on dominance rankings or incomplete rankings, which\nSen has been defending in his social choice work for several decades\n(e.g. Sen 2017). As a consequence, there are several ways to develop a\ncapabilitarian welfare economics, and to make the capability approach\n\u201coperational\u201d (Atkinson 1999, 185).\nSugden\u2019s objection can be best answered by looking at the applications\nthat have already been developed, and which have been listed in\nseveral overviews of the empirical literature (e.g. Kuklys and Robeyns\n2005; Robeyns 2006b; Chiappero-Martinetti and Roche 2009; Lessmann\n2012).17 However, whether the applications discussed in those surveys\nsatisfy the critics depends on what one expects from empirical work in\ncapabilitarian welfare economics. As was already shown in chapter 1,\nempirical applications of the capability approach do make a substantive\ndifference to research using other normative frameworks, such as\nincome-based metrics. But from that it doesn\u2019t follow that capabilitarian\nwelfare economics will be able to deliver alternatives for each and every\nexisting welfarist study in economics. It may well be that sometimes the\ninformational riches of the capability approach clash with requirements\nregarding measurability that certain empirical applications put upon\nthe scholar.\n4.10.4 Towards a heterodox capabilitarian\nwelfare economics?\nIn the last two sections, we discussed how the capability approach can\nmake a difference to contemporary welfare economics both theoretically\nand empirically. Those debates by and large stay within the mainstream\nof contemporary welfare economics, even though as Amartya Sen (1996,\n61) notes, they require us \u201cto go more and more in these pluralist and\n17 In addition to the first, rather rough empirical application in the Appendix of Sen\u2019s\n(1985a) Commodities and Capabilities, the literature on empirical applications in\nwelfare economics that used individual-level data started off with the paper by\nSchokkaert and Van Ootegem (1990), in which they showed that unemployment\nbenefits may restore an unemployed person\u2019s income level, but do not restore all of\nher functionings to the level they were at before she become unemployed. 4. Critiques and Debates 209\nheterodox directions, taking note of a variety of information in making\nthe wide-ranging judgements that have to be made\u201d. The reference\nto \u2018heterodoxy\u2019 that Sen makes here is limited to the informational\nbasis of evaluations, yet in other work he has challenged some of the\nbehavioural assumptions underlying mainstream welfare economics\n(e.g. Sen 1977a, 1985b). However, other economists believe that we need\na much more radical heterodox and pluralist turn in economics, which\nwould also affect meta-theoretical views, the range of methods that can\nbe used (e.g. including qualitative methods), giving up on the belief that\neconomics can be value-free, and engaging much more \u2014 and much\nmore respectfully \u2014 with the other social sciences, and indeed also with\nthe humanities. What can these heterodox economists expect from the\ncapability approach?\nThe answer to that question flows from the description of the\nstate of economics that was given in section 4.10.1. The unwillingness\nof mainstream welfare economics to genuinely engage with other\ndisciplines (Fourcade, Ollion and Algan 2015; Nussbaum 2016) clashes\nwith the deeply interdisciplinary nature of the capability approach. The\nmodular view of the capability approach that was presented in chapter 2\nmakes it possible to see that a heterodox capabilitarian welfare economics\nis certainly possible. It could not only, as all non-welfarist welfare\neconomics does, include functionings and/or capabilities as ends in the\nevaluations (A1) and possibly include other aspects of ultimate value\ntoo (A6), but it could also include a rich account of human diversity\n(B3), a richly informed account of agency and structural constraints\n(B4 and B5) and it could widen its meta-theoretical commitments\n(B7) to become a discipline that is broader and more open to genuine\ninterdisciplinary learning. Yet the modular account also makes it very\nclear that mainstream welfare economists can make a range of choices\nin those modules that are more in line with the status quo in current\nwelfare economics, which would result in a very different type of\ncapabilitarian welfare economics.\nIn short, while both types of capabilitarian welfare economics will\ndepart in some sense from welfarist welfare economics, we are seeing\nthe emergence of both mainstream capabilitarian welfare economics and\nheterodox capabilitarian welfare economics. The problem for the first\nis that it will have few means of communication with other capability 210 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\ntheories, since it does not adopt many of the interdisciplinary choices\nthat most other capability theories make. The problem for the latter is\nthat it will not be taken seriously by mainstream economics, since it\ndoes not meet the narrow requirements of what counts as economics\naccording to the vast majority of mainstream economists. Taking\neverything together, a capabilitarian welfare economics is possible,\nbut (a) it will be harder to develop the capability approach in welfare\neconomics than in some other disciplines because of the methodological\nand meta-theoretical clashes and restrictions, and (b) the difficult\nposition that welfare economics occupies within mainstream economics\nwill become even more challenging, since moving in the direction of the\ncapability approach conflicts with the criteria that the gatekeepers in\nmainstream economists impose on anyone who wants to do something\nconsidered \u2018economics\u2019. This may also explain why there is much less\nwork done in welfare economics on the capability approach, compared\nto some other disciplines or fields in which the capability approach has\nmade a much bigger impact.\n4.11 Taking stock\nIn this chapter, we have engaged with a range of critiques that have\nbeen voiced about the capability approach, or debates that have\ndeveloped in the capability literature. While I hope that I have been\nfair in representing all viewpoints, I have in many cases argued for a\nparticular way of looking at the problem, and in a significant number of\ncases argued that critiques must be reformulated in order to be sound,\nor did not sufficiently appreciate the modular structure of the general\ncapability approach or the distinction between the capability approach\nand capability theories. Several of the critiques presented in this chapter\nhad bite as a critique of a particular type of capability theory, but not of\nthe capability approach in general.\nThe next and final (and very short!) chapter will not provide a\nsummary of the previous chapters, but rather offer some thoughts and\nspeculations on what the future of the capability approach could look\nlike, which issues will need to be addressed to unlock its full potential,\nand which limitations will always need to be reckoned with. 5. Which Future for the\nCapability Approach?\nIn the last two decades, much time and intellectual energy has been spent\non trying to answer some basic questions about the capability approach.\nWhat difference does it make to existing normative frameworks? Can\nit really make a difference to welfare economics as we know it? How\nshould we select capabilities, and how should these dimensions be\naggregated? Is the capability approach not too individualistic? Can\nit properly account for power? And can it properly account for the\nimportance of groups and the collective nature of many processes that\nare crucial for people\u2019s capabilities?\nI believe that many of the debates that kept capability scholars busy\nin the last two decades have been settled, and we can move to another\nphase in developing the capability approach and using it to study\nthe problems that need addressing. As many capability scholars have\nacknowledged (sometimes implicitly) for a very long time, and as this\nbook has illustrated in detail, there are a variety of capability theories\npossible. As a consequence, one capability theory does not need to be\na direct rival of another capability theory: we do not necessarily need\nto choose between them, and it will often be a mistake to see them\nas rivals. Many different capability theories can coexist. This theory-\npluralism should be embraced, rather than attacked by trying to put the\ncapability approach into a straightjacket. There is, of course, the real risk\nthat any theory that is somehow \u2018broadening\u2019 the informational basis\nof evaluations and comparisons is seen as a capability theory \u2014 hence\na real risk of inflation. However, the modular understanding of the\n\u00a9 2017 Ingrid Robeyns, CC BY 4.0 https://doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0130.05 212 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\ncapability approach clearly lays out the properties that every capability\ntheory, application or analysis should meet, and thereby provides a\npowerful response to the risk of the inflation of the term \u2018capability\ntheory\u2019.\nHaving sorted all of this out, we are free to put the capability approach\nto good use. It is impossible for one person to know all the interesting\npaths that the capability approach should take (even if that one person\nbenefited from comments and many helpful discussions with others).\nBut as a start, let me just mention some lines of further thinking, research\nand interventions that would be interesting to explore.\nFirst, within the disciplines in which the capability has been discussed\nand developed, there are plenty of opportunities to see what difference\nit can make if pushed all the way to its limits. In some fields, such as\neducational studies, the capability approach is well-developed and\nwidely applied. But there are others in which the capability approach\nhas so far merely been introduced, rather than being used to develop\nmature and complete theories. One question, which remains unanswered\nafter our discussion in section 4.10, is whether the capability approach\ncan provide an equally powerful alternative to utility-based welfare\neconomics. In the literature on theories of justice, which we discussed\nin section 3.13, the capability approach is widely debated, but there\nare hardly any fully developed capabilitarian theories of justice, apart\nfrom Nussbaum\u2019s (2006b) and the theory of disadvantage by Wolff\nand De-Shalit (2007). We need book-length accounts of capabilitarian\ntheories of justice, capabilitarian theories of institutional evaluation,\ncapabilitarian theories of welfare economics, and so forth.\nSecond, the capability approach is, so far, almost exclusively used\nfor evaluative and normative purposes \u2014 such as studies evaluating\nwhether certain people are better off than others, studies trying to\npropose a certain policy or institution (for the effect it has on people\u2019s\nfunctionings and capabilities) rather than others, or studies arguing\nfor justice in terms of people\u2019s capabilities. But one could also use\nthe capability approach for explanatory studies, e.g. to examine which\ninstitutions or policies foster certain capabilities, or using the notions of\nfunctionings and capabilities in the analysis of people\u2019s behaviour and\ndecision making. For example, labour economists model the decision\nabout a person\u2019s labour supply \u2014 how many hours she would be 5. Which Future for the Capability Approach? 213\nwilling to work \u2014 by looking at the costs and benefits of working more\nor fewer hours, but wouldn\u2019t it make much more sense to also ask how\nthe capabilities of different options compare? For example, many adults\nare happy to work an equal number of hours for less pay if the work is\nmore intrinsically rewarding or if it contributes to the creation of a public\ngood. Another example is how we explain a parent\u2019s decision not to use\nformal child care, or to use it only for a very limited number of hours.\nIf we explain this exclusively in terms of financial costs and benefits (as\nsome policy analysts do) we don\u2019t capture the fact that the capabilities\nof affiliation and social relations are very different in the two scenarios.\nA general model of people\u2019s behaviour and decision-making should\ntherefore not only look at the pecuniary costs and benefits of different\noptions, but also at the different levels of valuable functionings, and the\nabsence of functionings with a negative value, that the different options\noffer. The challenge of this approach is, of course, that capabilities are\noften merely qualitative variables, and this hampers the explanatory\nmodels that many social scientists use. But if our decision-making and\nbehaviour is largely influenced by the capabilities that characterize\ndifferent options, then surely, we should prefer (i) a more muddy and\nvaguer explanatory model that takes all important aspects into account\nabove (ii) a more elegant and neat model that gives us a distorted\npicture of how persons act and live.1 Some of this is already done, of\ncourse, since there is a large literature about certain functionings taken\nindividually, e.g. in explanatory research on people\u2019s health. The\nsuggestion I\u2019m making here is to look at those functionings in a more\nsystematic way, and to integrate functionings and capabilities as general\ncategories in theories of behaviour and decision making, next to other\ncategories such as resources and preference-satisfaction.\nThird, the capability approach may well have a very important role\nto play in the current quest for a truly interdisciplinary conceptual\nframework for the social sciences and humanities. Despite the fact\nthat universities are still to a large extent organized along disciplinary\nlines, there is an increasing recognition that many important questions\ncannot be studied properly without a unified framework or conceptual\nlanguage in which all the social sciences and humanities can find their\n1 This is a methodological point that Amartya Sen has been pressing for a very long\ntime. 214 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nplace. The capability approach may well form the nexus connecting\nexisting disciplinary frameworks, precisely because its concepts bring\ntogether people\u2019s wellbeing and the material resources they have, the\nlegal rules and social norms that constrain their capability sets, and so\nforth. The approach thereby offers important conceptual and theoretical\nbridges between disciplines. And it could also link evaluative and\nnormative frameworks to descriptive and explanatory frameworks,\nrather than leaving the normative frameworks implicit, as is now too\noften done in the social sciences.\nFourth, the capability approach should be more extensively used in\ndesigning new policy tools. Citizens who endorse a broad understanding\nof the quality of life that gives non-material aspects a central place have\nbeen annoyed for many years by the constant assessment of economic\ngrowth as an end in itself, rather than as a means to human flourishing\nand the meeting of human needs. They have been saying, rightly in my\nview, that whether economic growth is a good thing depends, among\nother things, on how it affects the overall quality of life of people, as\nwell as how other public values fare, such as ecological sustainability,\nand that we have very good reasons to take seriously the limits to\neconomic growth (Jackson 2016). But those who want to put the ends of\npolicies at the centre of the debate, and focus policy discussions more\non these ultimate ends rather than on means, need to move from mere\ncritique to developing tools that can fashion constructive proposals.\nThe alternatives to GDP, which I briefly discussed in chapter 1, are one\nelement that can help, but other tools are also needed.\nFifth, we have to investigate which capability theories are logically\npossible, but empirically implausible. The argument in this book has\nbeen that the capability approach can be developed in a wide range of\ncapability theories and applications, and is not committed to a particular\nset of political or ideological commitments. But that is as far as its logical\nstructures go, and it doesn\u2019t take a stance on empirical soundness. We\nneed to investigate which capability theories may be logically possible,\nbut nevertheless should be ruled out, given what we know about\nthe plausibility of our empirical assumptions regarding conversion\nfactors, human diversity, and structural constraints. It is highly likely\nthat there are capability theories that are logically conceivable, yet\ninconsistent with some \u2018basic facts\u2019 about human nature and societies. 5. Which Future for the Capability Approach? 215\nThis is especially important since we want to avoid the hijacking of the\ncapability approach by powerful societal actors or organisations who\nwill start to propagate a very uncritical and reductionist version of\nthe approach, and push that as the only right interpretation of it. The\ngeneral account of the capability approach that I have defended in this\nbook tries to be as politically and ideologically neutral as possible; but\nthat doesn\u2019t mean that I personally, as a scholar who has written a lot\non questions of injustice, believe that all possible capability theories are\nequally plausible. In fact, my own substantive work in which I have\nused the capability approach confirms that I do not, and that I think that\na critical account of social structures and power is needed (e.g. Robeyns\n2003, 2010, 2017b, 2017a). But I think we should then argue directly about\nthe unjust nature of social structures, economic institutions, or social\nnorms. I hope that the modular view presented in this book makes clear\nthat many of the intellectual and ideological battles actually take place\nin arguing about the B-modules and the C-modules.\nSixth and finally, the capability approach should be used in guiding\nexisting practices on the ground, in many different segments of society,\nand in many different societies of the world. This is not easy, since there\nare quite significant challenges for theorists to bridge the gap between\ntheir work and practices on the ground, as several theorists who\nengaged in such theory-practice collaborations have pointed out (e.g.\nKoggel 2008; Wolff 2011). Yet if the capability approach aspires to make\na difference in practice \u2014 which many capability scholars do \u2014 then\nthinking carefully about how to move to practice without diluting the\nessence of the framework is crucial. Luckily, there are signs that more\nof these \u2018on-the-ground applications\u2019 are being developed, and that the\ncapability approach is not only of interest to scholars and policy makers,\nbut also for practitioners and citizens. One example is Solava Ibrahim\u2019s\n(2017) recent model for grassroots-led development, which is primarily\na conceptual and theoretical framework, yet is also based on ten years\nof fieldwork. Another example is the practical field of social work in\nthe Netherlands, where social work professionals have recently argued\nthat the field is in need of a new moral compass, in order to counter the\ntechnocratic developments that, it is argued, have dominated changes in\nsocial work in recent decades. Some social workers argue that the human\nrights framework could provide a useful theory (Hartman, Knevel and 216 Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice\nReynaert 2016), while others believe that capabilities could be helpful in\nrestoring ethical and political dimensions to the practice of social work\n(Braber 2013). As the discussion in section 3.14 has shown, there need\nnot be a conflict between those two frameworks. Yet it remains to be\nseen in the years to come if and how the capability approach is able to\nguide the effective change of the entire sector of social work in countries\nwhere the traditional welfare state is under pressure.\nHowever, with all these future extensions of the capability approach,\nit remains important to explicitly acknowledge its limitations. This\nbook has shown what the capability approach has to offer, but also\nwhat needs to be added before the vague and underspecified capability\nframework can be developed into a more powerful capability theory or\ncapability application. Especially the choices made in the B-modules,\nbut also the additions made in the C-modules C1 (additional\nexplanatory and ontological theories) and C4 (additional normative\nclaims and principles) will be crucial for many capabilitarian theories\nand applications to become powerful.\nThere is no point in pretending that the capability approach can do\nmore than it is able to do, since this would blind us to the necessary\ncollaborations with other theories and insights that are needed. It is\nin those collaborations with complementary powerful theories and\nframeworks that the success of the future of the capability approach lies.

achievement: it reaches across philosophy and the social sciences,\nacross research, policy and practi ce in the global North and South, and across many decades\nof debate and discussion within and outside the capability approach. It does so in a way which\nis readable and clear, and it manages to avoid on the one hand being too polemical, and on\nthe other hand being too superfi cial. Ingrid Robeyns is uniquely well-placed to write such a\nbook, being herself a well-established inter-disciplinary scholar whose work has contributed\nenormously to the development of the capability approach over the years. It has been a\nfrustrati on for many of us that no comprehensive textbook on the capability approach yet\nexists, and this will fi ll that gap admirably.\n\u2014Prof Tania Burchardt, Director of the Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion (CASE) and Associate\nProfessor in the Department of Social Policy at the London School of Economics\nHow do we evaluate ambiguous concepts such as wellbeing, freedom, and social jus\ufffd ce?\nHow do we develop policies that off er everyone the best chance to achieve what they want\nfrom life? The capability approach, a theore\ufffd cal framework pioneered by the philosopher\nand economist Amartya Sen in the 1980s, has become an increasingly infl uen\ufffd al way to think\nabout these issues.\nWellbeing, Freedom and Social Justi ce is both an introduc\ufffd on to the capability approach and\na thorough evalua\ufffd on of the challenges and disputes that have engrossed the scholars who\nhave developed it. Ingrid Robeyns off ers her own illumina\ufffd ng and rigorously interdisciplinary\ninterpreta\ufffd on, arguing that by apprecia\ufffd ng the dis\ufffd nc\ufffd on between the general capability\napproach and more specifi c capability theories or applica\ufffd ons we can create a powerful and\nfl exible tool for use in a variety of academic disciplines and fi elds of policymaking.\nThis book provides an original and comprehensive account that will appeal to scholars of\nthe capability approach, new readers looking for an interdisciplinary introduc\ufffd on, and those\ninterested in theories of jus\ufffd ce, human rights, basic needs, and the human development\napproach.\nAs with all Open Book publica\ufffd ons, this en\ufffd re book is available to read for free on the\npublisher\u2019s website.
