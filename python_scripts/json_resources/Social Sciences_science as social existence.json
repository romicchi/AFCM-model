Because I had hoped to write a successful book, I\nstarted out by making a number of choices which I thought would\nmake at least a few people unhappy. First, I chose to write a book\npromoting Martin Heidegger\u2019s existential conception of science. Second,\nI chose to write a book promoting the sociology of scientific knowledge\n(SSK). Third, I chose to argue that the accounts of science presented\nby SSK and Heidegger are, in fact, largely compatible, even mutually\nreinforcing. Hence, my choice of title: Science as Social Existence. In this\nbook, I combine Heidegger\u2019s early view of science as a form of existence\nwith SSK\u2019s view of science as a social activity. Through this combination,\nboth accounts turn out to be more vital and interesting than they may\nhave been when left to themselves. The book thus presents a tale of\nintellectual friendship between two perhaps unlikely companions. Of\ncourse, no friendship, no matter how promising, will please everyone.\nBut this one happens to please me, and I hope that it will please you too.\nSSK emerged in the 1970s, predominantly in the Science Studies Unit\nat the University of Edinburgh. The \u2018Edinburgh School\u2019 introduced what\nthey called the \u2018strong programme\u2019 in SSK. This signalled a dramatic\nstep beyond what was now, retrospectively, identified as the \u2018weak\nprogramme\u2019 in the sociology of science. The weak programme focussed\nmainly on institutional studies of the scientific community: how scientists\nwere organised into groups; and the social relationships which existed\nbetween them. The actual products of scientific activity \u2014 theories\nand facts \u2014 and the means by which they are produced \u2014 techniques\nand methods \u2014 were excluded from sociological analysis. These were\n\u00a9 Jeff Kochan, CC BY 4.0 http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0129.08 2 Science as Social Existence\nthought to form the hard centre of science, the rational core, which\nsociology was not meant to touch.\nIn the 1970s, SSK practitioners began to touch this core. This disturbed\nsome people. In the view of critics, SSK was undermining the rationality\nof science by addressing its conceptual and methodological core in\nsociological terms. Effectively, this meant that scientific rationality\nwas being treated, through and through, as a social phenomenon, a\nphenomenon necessarily dependent for its legitimacy on local social\nand historical circumstances. Critics of SSK urged that this was wrong-\nheaded, and they educed diverse intellectual arguments to support\ntheir view. Perhaps more importantly, however, these critics felt it was\nwrong: their distaste was not just intellectual, it was also moral \u2014 it\ncame from the gut. For SSK practitioners, none of this appears to have\nbeen surprising. They saw their critics as harbouring a quasi-religious\ndesire to preserve the alleged \u2018sacredness\u2019 of scientific rationality\nagainst the secularising impulses of a self-consciously naturalistic\nand methodologically empiricist social science. As social scientists\nwho set out to study science itself, SSK practitioners were determined\nto treat scientific rationality in wholly secular terms, as a completely\nnatural phenomenon, produced by instinctively gregarious, historically\nembedded, and fundamentally biological creatures.\nA proper disciplinary history of these events has yet to be written.\nMy own suspicion is that SSK practitioners have tended to overplay\nthe secularisation angle, no doubt because this bolsters their own self-\npresentation as hard-boiled scientific naturalists. Accusing your critics\nof theological tendencies is, at least in the current Euro-American\nacademic context, a good way to score a few rhetorical points. In\nmy view, however, questions about the sacred or secular nature of\nknowledge are, at base, questions about what it means to be a human\nbeing. To claim that scientific knowledge draws its authority from a\nsource which transcends local social and historical circumstances is to\nmake a substantive claim about human beings as the producers and\ncarriers of that knowledge. Likewise for the contrasting claim, that the\nauthority of scientific knowledge cannot be extricated from the social\nand historical circumstances in which that knowledge is produced and\nsustained. In the first case, some aspect of the human being \u2014 an aspect Introduction 3\ntied to knowledge \u2014 is thought to transcend its local circumstances. In\nthe second case, such transcendence is deemed impossible.\nFor the critics, SSK\u2019s claim that there is nothing transcendent\nabout scientific knowledge seems to make no sense. In their view, this\namounts to a rejection of the objectivity of science. If the authority of\nknowledge is necessarily tied to local circumstances, then how does one\nexplain the universal validity of, for example, simple rules of logic like\nthose for deduction? From the critics\u2019 perspective, SSK practitioners\nappear to be rejecting the objectivity of logic and other unquestionably\nreliable techniques of knowledge production. Here, it may be useful\nto distinguish between descriptions and explanations of objectivity. If\nwe consider our experience of objective knowledge production \u2014 for\nexample, deducing from \u2018All humans are mortal\u2019 and \u2018Socrates is\nhuman\u2019 the conclusion \u2018Socrates is mortal\u2019 \u2014 then we seem to be faced\nwith a procedure which cannot but be objective, regardless of local\ncircumstances. The objective validity of deduction feels universal, as if\nit, necessarily, holds everywhere and at all times. In other words, it has\nnormative force. This is a description of our experience \u2014 or, one may say,\nthe phenomenology \u2014 of deductive inference. SSK does not dismiss this\nphenomenological description as false, but seeks to explain it without\nrecourse to the notion that human knowers, when they engage in\ndeductive reasoning, transcend their local circumstances. Hence, it is at\nthe level of explanation, not description, that the dispute fundamentally\noperates. Whereas the critics seek to explain the normative force of\ndeduction in terms of a transcendent feature of human cognition, SSK\npractitioners seek to explain it in wholly local and naturalistic terms.\nIn the former case, our compulsive feeling that deduction must be\nobjectively valid is the result of its transcendent nature. In the latter\ncase, this feeling of compulsion, of logical necessity, is instead viewed\nas the result, in necessary part, of one\u2019s embeddedness in a particular\nsocial context, a context in which one learns and is afterward under\nrecurring pressure to experience deduction, without deliberation, as an\nobjectively valid technique of knowledge production. Normative force\nis thus social force rather than transcendental force.\nBased on their radically different conceptions of what it means to\nbe a human knower, these competing positions seem to lack sufficient 4 Science as Social Existence\ncommon ground for their differences to be resolved through rational\ndiscussion. At least, the often acrimonious and mostly unproductive\ndebates which have erupted with varying intensity over the last four\ndecades would seem to suggest as much. I will have little more to\nsay about this conflict in what follows. My own view is that, as more\nrigorously naturalistic models of human knowing continue to gain\ncredibility across the disciplines, the original intellectual and moral\nmotivations driving SSK will be largely vindicated. There is, however,\nanother conflict, more central to my interests, which this first conflict\nhelps to illuminate. This is a conflict between SSK practitioners and\nthose in the slightly younger interdisciplinary field of science studies\nwho argue that SSK did not go far enough in its rejection of past\ntranscendental models of the scientific knower. Indeed, according to\nthis line of criticism, the conception of the scientific knower promoted\nby SSK is still a transcendental conception. The only difference is that\nthis knower is no longer viewed as an individual person, but has instead\nbeen replaced by society as a whole. On this reading, it is not, ultimately,\nthe individual but society which develops and sustains knowledge of\nthe natural world.\nCentral to this line of criticism is the claim that SSK trucks in a strong\ntheoretical dichotomy between society, on the one hand, and nature,\non the other. By allegedly taking this dichotomy for granted, SSK\npractitioners are said to gather all the activity relevant to knowledge\nproduction on the society side, leaving the nature side thoroughly\ninert or passive and, as a consequence, completely unnecessary for\nexplanations of scientific knowledge production. But, so the science\nstudies critics continue, it seems patently absurd to claim that nature\nplays no role in our knowledge of it. Such a claim amounts to a form of\nsociological idealism, where knowledge is explained solely in terms of\nthe realm of ideas created and sustained by society, with the concrete\nreality of the natural world being left entirely out of the picture.\nInterestingly, this criticism has much in common with the earlier\ncriticism. In the earlier case, the worry was that SSK, by insisting that all\nknowledge must be explained in terms of local circumstances, fails to\ncapture the universality of some well-established scientific knowledge\nclaims. In other words, on this model, all that scientific knowledge ends\nup ultimately pointing to are the local social and historical situations Introduction 5\nwhich gave rise to and continue to sustain it. It does not, and cannot,\npoint to the objective reality which exists independently of those\nsituations. This too, then, is an accusation of a kind of idealism, where\nhistorical and sociological circumstances are placed front and centre,\nwhile the actual natural reality which science is purportedly meant to\nstudy is left to languish by the wayside. In the view of the first critics,\nthe solution to this idealism is transcendence. Only by reference to an\naspect of human cognition which transcends local circumstances can we\nexplain how science succeeds in producing objective accounts of nature.\nThe more recent science studies critics employ a different strategy\nin response to SSK\u2019s alleged idealism. Like SSK, they too reject\ntranscendence. From their perspective, to invoke transcendence is\nto offer an implausible solution to a pseudo-problem created by the\ndichotomous separation of society and nature. Rather than trying to\nresolve this supposed problem, they argue, we should simply reject\nthe society-nature distinction which gave rise to it. No dichotomy, no\nproblem. These critics propose that society and nature not be treated\nas fundamental resources in explanations of knowledge, but instead\nas topics which are themselves in need of explanation. As we will see\nlater, their preferred alternative method is to explain society and nature\nin terms of the allegedly more fundamental concept of \u2018practice.\u2019 The\nidea is that stabilised phenomena like society and nature arise from the\ndynamic heterogeneity of ongoing practical activities which constitute\nthe very fabric of existence. To remain stuck at the level of the society-\nnature distinction is to ignore practice as providing a more fundamental\nlevel on which to base explanations of scientific knowledge production.\nMy brief here is not to give a detailed account of, much less an\nextended critical commentary on, this alternative to SSK, although I will\ngive it some further attention in Chapters Two and Three. For the time\nbeing, I would like to emphasise that this rejection of the society-nature\ndistinction is intimately related to a more general critique of modernity\nwhich has been characteristic of this theoretical wing of science studies.\nIn this context, the term \u2018modernity\u2019 is meant to pick out that aspect\nof our cultural condition which has given rise, above all, to ecological\ndisasters. The connection between concrete ecological catastrophe and\nthe abstract theoretical separation of society and nature seems to be that\nthis abstract concept, in consequential part, enables human beings to 6 Science as Social Existence\nview nature as a passive medium, devoid of intrinsic value and so freely\navailable for manipulation in accordance with human imagination\nand intentions. By rejecting this distinction, these theorists hope to\ncontribute to a reformulation of humanity\u2019s relationship with the rest\nof the natural world, a reformulation in which the threat of ecological\ncatastrophe will be dramatically diminished.\nAs critics of modernity, these science studies theorists follow an\nintellectual path which had been cleared by scholars working earlier in\nthe twentieth century, one of the most prominent of whom was Martin\nHeidegger. Yet, as we will see, an influential stream in practice-based\naccounts of science, while acknowledging a debt to Heidegger\u2019s earlier\ncritique of modernity, also criticises Heidegger for not having gone far\nenough. In this respect, Heidegger is admonished for much the same\nreason that science studies scholars also admonish SSK. In both cases,\nan innovative step forward is acknowledged, but then immediately\nrebuked for nevertheless still falling firmly within the circle of an\nuntenable modernist ideology.\nOne of my main objectives in this book is to demonstrate that these\ncriticisms of SSK and Heidegger, despite their influence, are in fact\nlargely mistaken. Indeed, both SSK and Heidegger have much more\nto offer a practice-based approach to science than has been allowed\nfor by their critics. A key issue in this dispute is the methodological\nquestion of how best to address the conceptual problems generated by\nthe modern theoretical separation of society and nature. This was, in\nfact, a question which, in a somewhat more abstract form, preoccupied\nHeidegger for much of his life. However, he responded to it in a\ndramatically different way than have many prominent science studies\nscholars. While the latter have counselled the rejection of the society-\nnature distinction, Heidegger instead advised its deconstruction. To\nthis end, he spent much energy attempting to trace the history of this\ndistinction back to its earliest conceptual manifestations. One principle\nguiding this methodology was Heidegger\u2019s conviction that human\nbeings are fundamentally historical creatures. Hence, our present\nactions, including our conceptual acts, are inextricably bound together\nwith the history of thinking and doing which informs the community\nto which we belong. For this reason, Heidegger was preoccupied\nwith an intellectual excavation of the European intellectual tradition. Introduction 7\nScience studies scholars who counsel the rejection of the society-nature\ndistinction seem, in contrast, less convinced of the historical dependency\nof our thinking, believing instead that such traditional structures as\nthe society-nature distinction may simply be sidelined in favour of\nradically new, historically unprecedented, intellectual tools. Once again,\nwe see that an intractable theoretical dispute about knowledge may be\nrephrased as a fundamental disagreement about what it means to be a\nhuman being. The science studies scholars in question seem to believe\nthat human beings can, at least in some aspect, liberate themselves from\nhistory. For Heidegger, in contrast, human existence is, before anything\nelse, historical. From Heidegger\u2019s perspective, it follows that science,\nas a form of human existence, must also be a fundamentally historical\nphenomenon. As a result, Heidegger\u2019s largely philosophical account of\nscience turns out to be highly compatible with the methods and goals\nof many historians of science. This compatibility with the history of\nscience is yet another characteristic which Heidegger\u2019s conception of\nscience shares with SSK.\nOne consequence of deconstructing the society-nature distinction is a\nrecognition that it is but one special instance of a more general distinction\nbetween mind and body, or, in more theoretical terms, subject and\nobject. It is towards this general distinction that both Heidegger, mainly\nin work preceding the Second World War, and more recent science\nstudies scholars have directed most of their critical energy. In historical\nterms, the main lineage of the subject-object distinction emerges from\nthe work of the seventeenth-century philosopher, Ren\u00e9 Descartes, as\nwell as its subsequent formal elaboration in the eighteenth-century\nwritings of Immanuel Kant. As we will see, Heidegger\u2019s deconstruction\nof this distinction involves a substantial critique of both Descartes\nand Kant. This deconstruction furthermore pushes Heidegger into a\ndetailed engagement with the ancient Greek philosophers Plato and\nAristotle. In Heidegger\u2019s view, the seventeenth-century subject-object\ndistinction did not spring from nothing, but instead grew out of a\nspecific set of intellectual possibilities introduced by ancient Greek\nthinkers. Heidegger\u2019s goal was to trace the roots of the distinction back\nthrough the history of philosophy, with the intention of disclosing\nnew \u2014 potentially liberating \u2014 possibilities which were left latent in the\nwork of earlier practitioners. His method is thus a deeply historical one, 8 Science as Social Existence\none which acknowledges the inescapably historical nature of our forms\nof understanding, and one which also views history as a dynamic and\nheterogeneous means by which to overcome the potentially threatening\nlimitations of the more orthodox, familiar, and often taken-for-granted\nthreads of the European intellectual tradition.\nSSK practitioners share Heidegger\u2019s desire for an alternative to the\nintellectual orthodoxy, an alternative which more accurately depicts\nthe conditions of lived experience. Hence, they too adopt a critical\nstance towards the orthodox subject-object distinction, challenging,\nin particular, the individualism presupposed in its model of human\nsubjectivity. As I will argue, however, SSK\u2019s challenge to individualistic\nmodels of the subject nevertheless leaves crucial aspects of the modern\nsubject-object distinction intact. As a consequence, SSK practitioners\nhave remained vulnerable to attacks from their allegedly more radical\ncompetitors in science studies, who exploit SSK practitioners\u2019 residual\nadherence to the subject-object distinction in promoting their own,\nquite different, accounts of scientific practice. I wish to demonstrate that\nSSK may be defended against these attacks through its combination\nwith Heidegger\u2019s deconstruction of the subject-object distinction, as\nwell as with his phenomenological analysis of the basic structures of\nhuman subjectivity. In turn, I wish to also demonstrate that Heidegger\u2019s\ntheoretical position may be rendered more concrete, interesting, and\nuseful through combination with empirical studies and theoretical\ninsights already extant in the SSK literature. This will give grounds for\nmy claim that SSK and Heidegger\u2019s early existential phenomenology\npresent not just complementary but also mutually reinforcing models\nof the way scientists get things done.\nBefore moving into a summary of the chapters which follow, I should\nemphasise one last time that the goal of this book is a constructive\ncombination of Heidegger\u2019s early existential conception of science\nwith the sociology of scientific knowledge. In order to stay focussed on\nthis goal, I have chosen, with some significant exceptions, to minimise\ncritical engagement with the large secondary literature which has arisen\nin response to the works of both SSK practitioners and, more especially,\nHeidegger. This restriction has allowed me the freedom to develop my\nargument in a more straightforward and streamlined fashion, with the\nresult being, I trust, of greater benefit to a majority of the book\u2019s readers. Introduction 9\nYet, I should also note that, particularly in the case of Heidegger, by\nsticking almost exclusively to primary texts, I have ended up with\nan interpretation which is sometimes at odds with the established\nscholarship. This is not what I had expected, but the outcome has, I\nmust admit, been cause for some excitement. I hope that readers, in\nretracing my path through these texts, will also experience some of that\nsame excitement.\nChapter One begins with a nod to the so-called \u2018science wars,\u2019 a\nheated intellectual dispute which took place in the 1990s. One battle\nin this multifaceted dispute was over the purported idealism of SSK\npractitioners. This charge of idealism was motivated by SSK\u2019s alleged\nphilosophical scepticism about the existence of the external world.\nThe assumption underlying this criticism was that science entails the\nexistence of the external world, and so scepticism on that count amounts\nto an assault on the legitimacy of science. However, as I demonstrate,\nSSK practitioners have almost never denied the existence of the external\nworld. On the contrary, they have often educed arguments against\nexternal-world scepticism, and they have usually insisted that a belief in\nthe existence of the external world is central to SSK\u2019s method of social-\nscientific explanation. Nevertheless, I argue that SSK practitioners\u2019\nattempts to deflect external-world scepticism are less successful than\nthey could be, and hence that their method continues to be vulnerable\nto sceptical attack. The goal is not, however, to develop a more robust\nsolution to the problem of the external world, but instead to question\nthe very intelligibility of that problem. I suggest that external-world\nscepticism presupposes a specific model of human subjectivity, one\nin which the subject is separated from the world, a world external to\nit, and so it must then build a bridge to this external world in order\nto grasp it as an object of knowledge. In other words, external-world\nscepticism presupposes the fundamentality of the modern subject-object\ndistinction. Although SSK practitioners have sought, in various ways,\nto shake off the more troublesome aspects of this distinction, I argue\nthat they nevertheless have remained committed to it at a basic, tacit\nlevel. This commitment is evinced by their acceptance of external-world\nscepticism as a legitimate problem of knowledge. I attempt to help SSK\nout of this bind by combining it with Heidegger\u2019s phenomenology of the\nsubject as \u2018being-in-the-world.\u2019 I suggest that by adopting Heidegger\u2019s 10 Science as Social Existence\nalternative account of subjectivity, SSK practitioners will no longer be\nvulnerable to the threat of external-world scepticism, since they will no\nlonger be wedded to the model of subjectivity which fuels that threat.\nIn Chapter Two, I address the question of \u2018realism\u2019 which emerges\nfrom the preceding discussion. Heidegger\u2019s diagnostic response to\nexternal-world scepticism is accompanied by an explicit rejection of\nboth realism and idealism as legitimate theoretical positions. However,\nI argue that a \u2018minimal realism\u2019 may still be drawn from Heidegger\u2019s\nconsiderations. Heidegger affirms that things are, that they exist,\nindependently of subjects, but rejects any attempt to determine what\nthey are independently of subjects. This distinction between that-\nbeing and what-being gives grounds for minimal realism. It allows us\nto accept the core realist doctrine of independent existence (thatness),\nwithout also committing to the doctrine of independent essence\n(whatness). I then demonstrate that Heidegger\u2019s minimal realism is\nremarkably compatible with SSK\u2019s \u2018residual realism,\u2019 which affirms\nthe independent existence of an external world, but rejects the claim\nthat scientific truths are determined by that world. This compatibility\ncan be further strengthened through the work already done in Chapter\nOne: relieving SSK of its vestigial commitment to the orthodox\nmodel of subjectivity, and equipping it instead with Heidegger\u2019s\nalternative. With this combination in place, I go on to consider Joseph\nRouse\u2019s criticisms of SSK and Heidegger. Rouse argues that both are\ncommitted to a theory-dominated account of science, and he instead\npromotes a practice-based account of science. I argue that Rouse has\nmisunderstood Heidegger\u2019s account of science, not least because he\noverlooks Heidegger\u2019s distinction between that-being and what-being,\nexistence and essence. Furthermore, although Rouse\u2019s criticisms of\nSSK do have some merit, I demonstrate that they are also marred by\nmisinterpretation. Finally, Rouse\u2019s meritorious criticisms of SSK can\nalso be deflected once SSK has been combined with Heidegger. Indeed,\nI conclude that this combination \u2014 along with the minimal realism\naccompanying it \u2014 offers a more coherent and serviceable basis for a\npractice-based account of science than does Rouse\u2019s alternative.\nChapter Three continues to develop the implications of minimal\nrealism, largely through a discussion of the high-profile debate between\nthe pioneering SSK practitioner, David Bloor, and the influential Introduction 11\nscience studies scholar, Bruno Latour. At the centre of their dispute\nis the Kantian concept of the thing-in-itself, a thing to which we can\nattribute independent existence, but about whose independent qualities,\nor essence, we can know nothing. This concept is presupposed by\nminimal realism, and also by SSK. Latour attacks it as incoherent, and\nconsequently rejects SSK as an unfit method for science studies. I begin\nby first reviewing Rae Langton\u2019s commentary on Kant\u2019s thing-in-itself.\nLangton argues that this concept follows from an acknowledgement\nof the finitude of human knowledge. To recognise the existence of\nthings-in-themselves is to admit our inevitable ignorance in the face of\nnature. This recognition manifests itself in the humility we feel in our\nencounters with the natural world. I then turn to the Bloor-Latour debate.\nIn Latour\u2019s view, Bloor\u2019s endorsement of the thing-in-itself fits hand\nin glove with his allegedly uncritical adoption of the Kantian subject-\nobject distinction. Latour rejects this distinction, and the concept of the\nthing-in-itself along with it. Nature, on Latour\u2019s alternative account,\ndoes not outstrip our power to know it, but is itself a wholly constructed\nphenomenon, one constituted in a field of continuously circulating\npractices. As in the case of Rouse, Latour exploits weaknesses in SSK\u2019s\ntreatment of the orthodox subject-object distinction. And, as in the\ncase of Rouse, I argue that SSK, once combined with Heidegger, can\nsuccessfully counter Latour\u2019s criticism. Indeed, Heidegger deconstructs\nthe Kantian subject-object distinction, reformulating the thing-in-itself\nin a way commensurate with his own model of the subject. Crucially, the\nthing-in-itself correlates with the \u2018affectivity\u2019 of the subject. We know the\nthing exists because it affects us, because we experience that it is, even\nif we may fail to grasp what it is. Heidegger argues that this peculiar\nexperience is marked by a feeling \u2014 an affective state \u2014 of anxiety.\nHis reformulation of Kant preserves human finitude and humility, but\nrejects the Kantian notion of transcendence. It also preserves minimal\nrealism. I conclude with a brief survey of clinical studies of anxiety\nwhich seem to provide empirical support for a belief in the thing-in-\nitself, as reformulated in the context of minimal realism.\nChapter Four begins a transition to themes more typical of the history\nof science. I start with a review of Heidegger\u2019s phenomenological\nhistory of logic, wherein logic is construed as the science of thinking.\nIn Heidegger\u2019s view, this history is inextricably entwined with the 12 Science as Social Existence\nhistory of the modern subject-object distinction, in particular, and the\nhistory of scientific subjectivity, more generally. He reads the history of\nlogic as growing out of earlier attempts to understand the fundamental\nrelation between thinking and things. This was viewed, above all, as an\nintentional relation, a relation manifest in the subject\u2019s experience of its\nbeing directed towards things. This relation then came to be construed\nin the modern era as one between a propositionally structured mental\nsubstance, on the one hand, and a property-bearing physical substance,\non the other. Heidegger locates the original impulse of logic in Plato\u2019s\nclaim that \u2018the good\u2019 guides thinking in its directedness towards\nthings. Aristotle then formalised this idea by modelling thinking on\nthe proposition, with the good now being denoted by the copula (\u2018is\u2019),\nwhich combines subject and predicate in an intelligible sentence. This\nmove marks the beginning of logic as the formalising study of thinking.\nHeidegger argues that Descartes later shifted the organising principle\nof intelligibility from the \u2018is\u2019 to the subject position of the proposition,\nabove all, to the first-person singular subject, \u2018I.\u2019 Kant then submits the\nCartesian \u2018I\u2019 to a phenomenological critique, disclosing its content in\nterms of rules of reason. These rules guide thinking in its directedness\ntowards things, ensuring that the relation is a \u2018good\u2019 one, productive\nof intelligibility and understanding. According to Heidegger, this\nhistory traces the way in which the informal and implicit rules guiding\nthinking were first identified, and then formalised as a set of explicit\nrules governing the structure of thought. He calls this formalisation\nprocess \u2018thematisation.\u2019 Heidegger then offers his own contribution to\nthis history, arguing that the soil from which logic grows is thoroughly\nhistorical, that the rules directing thinking are rooted in a shared\ntradition, in the subject\u2019s inescapable \u2018being-with-others.\u2019 This move,\nI argue, allows for a powerful point of contact between Heidegger\u2019s\nphenomenology of logic and the sociology of logic. Indeed, SSK\npractitioners also emphasise the rootedness of formal logic in the\ninformal rules of a shared tradition. Moreover, they have developed this\ninsight to a far greater extent than did Heidegger. Here, the combination\nof SSK with Heidegger allows us to strengthen and expand on \u2014 to\nmore thoroughly thematise and articulate \u2014 Heidegger\u2019s somewhat\nrudimentary considerations. At the same time, I argue that Heidegger\nprovides grounds for a non-propositional, naturalistic account of Introduction 13\nintentionality which can help assuage the worry of SSK practitioners\nthat intentionality, as a philosophical concept, conflicts with the\nnaturalism of their own research methodology.\nChapter Five shifts focus from the history of formal science to the\nhistory of natural science, including medicine. In doing so, it builds\non the argument from the previous chapter that science is a process\nof thematisation in which informal and indeterminate knowledge\nis thematised and articulated in a more formal and determinate way.\nThis raises a concern, however, because it suggests that scientists only\ndiscover what they already know. Both SSK and Heidegger attribute\na circularity to scientific reasoning. Yet, I argue, this circularity is not\nvicious. Indeed, it was already recognised by the second-century Greek\nphysician, Galen of Pergamon, and became a topic of concentrated\ninterest for physicians at the University of Padua during the Renaissance.\nThese physicians argued that a determinate knowledge of the informal\nrules governing their medical practice could be articulated through\nan incremental process of working with things. The movement from\ninformal to formal knowledge is thus an importantly empirical one.\nAccording to Heidegger, this process was carried over into the early-\nmodern period, but not without radical transformation. He argues\nthat, in this period, the rules guiding empirical thinking and doing\nwere \u2018mathematicised,\u2019 that is, consolidated as a coherent set of basic\nprinciples, which Heidegger described as a \u2018basic blueprint\u2019 governing\nscientists\u2019 understanding of the thingness (whatness) of things. This\nprocess of mathematicisation grew from a \u2018reciprocal relation\u2019 between\nempirical work with things, on the one hand, and the metaphysical\nprojection of the thingness of things, on the other. I thus argue that\nHeidegger offers an account of early-modern science which combines\nboth mathematical and empirical elements, comparing his account to\nthe respective metaphysical and empiricist accounts of the historians of\nscience Alexandre Koyr\u00e9 and Peter Dear. For Heidegger, the emergence\nof early-modern science was neither an exclusively metaphysical nor an\nexclusively empirical event, but instead a radical transformation in the\nreciprocal relation between metaphysics and experience. I argue that\nthis was, above all, a transformation in the role played by Aristotelian\n\u2018final causes\u2019 in early-modern natural philosophy. This challenges the\nhistoriographic commonplace that final causes were abolished from 14 Science as Social Existence\nthe new natural philosophy, a claim often supported by pointing\nto the alleged breakdown of the Aristotelian art-nature distinction.\nExtrapolating from Heidegger\u2019s work, I argue that there was no such\nbreakdown, and that the art-nature distinction, as well as final causes,\ndespite seventeenth-century rhetoric to the contrary, remained central\nto early-modern scientific practice. Indeed, both concepts figure as key\nresources in Heidegger\u2019s mathematical explanation for the emergence\nof early-modern science.\nIn Chapter Six, I undertake a discussion of the emergence of early-\nmodern experimental philosophy, especially as exemplified in the work\nof Robert Boyle. I challenge SSK practitioner Steven Shapin\u2019s attempt to\ninsulate Boyle from mathematical culture, arguing instead that Boyle\nwas a mathematical philosopher in Heidegger\u2019s sense. First, however,\nI review Heidegger\u2019s claim that Newton\u2019s First Law is a formalisation\nof Galileo\u2019s mathematical conception of the thing as being \u2018left entirely\nto itself.\u2019 This conception provided the metaphysical blueprint for\nwhat I dub the Galilean First Thing, and I argue that, for Heidegger,\nthe First Thing provided a condition of possibility for the early-modern\nexperiment. This metaphysical blueprint emerged through its reciprocal\nrelation with empirical experience. Drawing on recent work in the history\nof science, I develop this point through a discussion of late Renaissance\nand early-modern artisanal culture, with an emphasis on the uniform\nmanufacture of pure metals. These metallurgical manipulations, I\nsuggest, may have encouraged experimenters\u2019 metaphysical conception\nof the thing as a uniform and autonomous First Thing. On this basis,\nI propose that the fundamental aim of the early-modern experiment\nwas to release things from environmental interference in order to let\nthem be what they, essentially, are \u2014 that is, instances of the First\nThing. This essential image thus operates as the final cause towards\nwhich physical things are naturally disposed, and towards which\nexperimental manipulations seek to artfully direct them. I find support\nfor these claims in Shapin and Simon Schaffer\u2019s classic SSK study of\nBoyle, focussing on Boyle\u2019s dispute with Francis Line. I demonstrate that\nBoyle\u2019s response to Line can be explained by attributing to Boyle a tacit\ncommitment to the First Thing, as the blueprint or final cause guiding\nhis experimental practice. I furthermore locate the difference between\nBoyle and Line in the fact that Boyle was committed to such a blueprint Introduction 15\nwhile Line was not, that Boyle experienced nature in terms of a uniform\nmodel while Line experienced it in a less unified, more heterogeneous\nway. This conclusion lends support to Heidegger\u2019s claim that the early-\nmodern period saw experience as increasingly consolidated under a\nsingle \u2018world picture.\u2019 I conclude by comparing this claim with Bloor\u2019s\nobservation that scientific knowledge is governed by \u2018social imagery,\u2019\nthat is, by images of society construed as a whole. On the one hand,\nBloor\u2019s work suggests ways in which Heidegger\u2019s concepts of \u2018world\npicture\u2019 and \u2018basic blueprint\u2019 might be rephrased and further developed\nin a more sociological idiom. On the other hand, Heidegger\u2019s claim that\nthese concepts apply only to the early-modern period and later suggests\nthat Bloor\u2019s concept of \u2018social imagery\u2019 may prove useful only within a\nlimited historical range.\nChapter Seven does double duty, first, as an unsystematic review\nof key themes from the preceding chapters, and, second, as a roughly\nsketched roadmap for future work. Here, I will discuss only the latter.\nUp to this point, my discussion of Heidegger will have been largely\nrestricted to his work from the 1920s and 1930s. During this period, in\nmy view, he is centrally concerned with the phenomenology of scientific\nsubjectivity. Later, in the late 1940s and the 1950s, his attention shifts to\nmore critical meditations on the dangers posed by scientific thinking to\nsociety in general. Indeed, he argued in the 1950s that modern science\nprepares the way for a comprehensive technologisation of society. I\nbegin by reviewing Heidegger\u2019s friendship, from the mid-1930s until\nhis death in 1976, with Carl von Weizs\u00e4cker, a noted physicist who had\nstudied under Werner Heisenberg and Niels Bohr. Von Weizs\u00e4cker was\nconvinced that Heidegger\u2019s analysis of subjectivity could help him to\naddress conceptual problems resulting from the rejection, by the new\nphysics, of the orthodox subject-object distinction. However, he also\nbelieved that Heidegger\u2019s own search for a solution was handicapped by\nHeidegger\u2019s superficial understanding of the new physics. Heidegger\nattributed the technologisation of society to what he called \u2018enframing,\u2019 a\nphenomenon which Heidegger felt limited the existential possibilities of\nthe subject. Von Weizs\u00e4cker affirmed Heidegger\u2019s concept of enframing\nas an outgrowth of modern science, but insisted instead that it offered\nnew, potentially liberating possibilities for humankind, especially\nin the form of systems theory, or cybernetics. While von Weizs\u00e4cker 16 Science as Social Existence\nadvocated for deeper engagement with cybernetics, Heidegger\nattempted to reconceptualise the thing in a way which radically\ndeparted from its conceptualisation by modern science. I argue that\nHeidegger\u2019s considerations may be usefully translated into the terms\nof an interactionist social theory, as commended by SSK pioneer, Barry\nBarnes. Enframing is thus viewed as a social phenomenon, constituted\nin the historically contingent interactions of naturally gregarious\nsubjects. On von Weizs\u00e4cker\u2019s reading, in contrast, enframing is a system\nwhich organises autonomous subjects into a social whole. While the\ninteractionist emphasises the subject over the system, the cyberneticist\nemphasises the system over the subject. I naturally opt for the former\nmethod, and conclude the chapter, and the book, by arguing for a\nstrong compatibility between Heidegger\u2019s attention to the affectivity of\nthe subject, on the one hand, and Barnes\u2019s interactionist attention to the\ninternal emotional dynamics of \u2018status groups,\u2019 on the other. From this\nperspective, von Weizs\u00e4cker\u2019s commitment to enframing evinces his\nmembership in a status group whose interpersonal dynamics enforce\nthat commitment at an emotional level. A concentrated research focus\non the emotional dynamics governing scientific status groups flows\nnaturally from the arguments advanced throughout this book. The book\nthus sketches a road forward for those intrepid science studies scholars\nkeen to produce innovative and exciting new work. Chapter One\nThe Sociology of Scientific Knowledge,\nPhenomenology, and the Problem of\nthe External World\n1. Introduction\nA leading contributor to the sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK),\nHarry Collins, invites us to consider the following parable.\nA scientist, a philosopher, a sociologist of scientific knowledge and\na science warrior are aloft in a balloon. The balloon begins to deflate.\nThe scientist says: \u2018A micro-meteorite might have punctured the\nenvelope \u2014 do we have any sticky tape?\u2019 The philosopher says: \u2018My\ninductive propensities convince me that if the balloon deflates we will\nfall to earth \u2014 I must work out the rational basis for this belief.\u2019 The\nsociologist says: \u2018I wonder how they\u2019ll reach a consensus about the cause\nof our deaths.\u2019 The science warrior says: \u2018Told you so \u2014 there is an\nexternal reality!\u20191\nNo prize for guessing the odd person out here. The science warrior\u2019s\nnon sequitur seems itself to be strangely disconnected from reality.\nFor who among the other passengers challenged the existence of an\n1 Harry M. Collins (1999), \u2018The Science Police,\u2019 Social Studies of Science 29(2), 287\u201394\n(p. 287).\n\u00a9 Jeff Kochan, CC BY 4.0 http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0129.01 18 Science as Social Existence\nexternal world? The answer is: no one. If, however, we instead ask\nwho the science warrior believes to have challenged the existence of an\nexternal world, then we get a different answer. In this case, the culprit is\nthe sociologist of scientific knowledge. And yet, the real peculiarity of\nthe so-called \u2018science wars,\u2019 which erupted in the 1990s, is not so much\nthat science warriors accused sociologists of denying the existence of\nan external world. We know, after all, that the first casualty in war\nis truth. The real peculiarity is just how many otherwise reasonable\nscholars imbibed this falsehood and hence felt compelled to also pick\nup the cudgel.\nIt has been common for philosophers, in particular, to think of SSK\npractitioners as radical sceptics who dismiss the very idea that nature\nhas a role to play in the formation of scientific knowledge. The heat of the\nscience wars only heightened their passion, and some of them became\nfull-fledged warriors themselves. Philip Kitcher, for example, charged\nsociologists of science with a \u2018global skepticism,\u2019 because they \u2018inscribe\non their hearts\u2019 the dogma that \u2018no system of belief is constrained by\nreason or reality.\u2019 Christopher Norris alleged that members of the\n\u2018Edinburgh school\u2019 in SSK \u2018routinely deny [\u2026] the existence of a real-\nworld (mind- and belief-independent) physical domain.\u2019 John Norton\nclaimed that SSK endorses a \u2018complete scepticism\u2019 which rejects any\nrole for evidence in scientific research.2\nStrikingly, the natural scientists among the science warriors were\nmore circumspect in their criticism. Indeed, the physicists Alan Sokal\nand Jean Bricmont, who distinguished themselves by their enthusiasm\nto serve repeatedly on the front line, only characterised SSK as\n\u2018ambiguous in its intent.\u2019 On the one hand, SSK practitioners appear\nto endorse a \u2018general\u2019 or \u2018radical\u2019 scepticism. On the other hand, they\nclaim to be pursuing a genuinely scientific research programme.3 Sokal\nand Bricmont argue that these two positions cannot be held together,\n2 Philip Kitcher (1998), \u2018A Plea for Science Studies,\u2019 in A House Built on Sand: Exposing\nthe Myths about Science, ed. by Noretta Koertge (Oxford: Oxford University Press),\npp. 32\u201356 (pp. 46, 44); Christopher Norris (1997), Against Relativism: Philosophy of\nScience, Deconstruction and Critical Theory (Oxford: Blackwell), p. 314; John D. Norton\n(2000), \u2018How We Know about Electrons,\u2019 in After Popper, Kuhn and Feyerabend, ed. by\nRobert Nola and Howard Sankey (Dordecht: Kluwer), pp. 67\u201397 (p. 72).\n3 A lan Sokal and Jean Bricmont (1998), Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals\u2019\nAbuse of Science (New York: Picador), pp. 92, 89. 1. SSK, Phenomenology, and the Problem of the External World 19\nbecause a general scepticism about the existence of an external world\nis unscientific: \u2018if one wants to contribute to science, be it natural or\nsocial, one must abandon radical doubts concerning the viability of\nlogic or the possibility of knowing the world through observation\nand/or experiment.\u20194 If SSK practitioners claim only that sociological\nprinciples must play a role in any causal explanation of scientific beliefs,\nregardless of whether we evaluate those beliefs as true or false, rational\nor irrational, then Sokal and Bricmont write that they would have \u2018no\nparticular objection.\u20195 However, if they furthermore insist that only social\ncauses may enter into such an explanation, then Sokal and Bricmont say\nthey would strenuously disagree.\nFortunately, SSK practitioners have never made anything more than\nthe first claim, so the apparent ambiguity in their intent dissolves, and\nSokal and Bricmont may thus rest content that SSK defends a theory of\nscience to which they would, by their own admission, have no particular\nobjection. Indeed, Barry Barnes, a co-founder of SSK\u2019s Edinburgh\nSchool, has more recently written that SSK, \u2018[c]ontrary to what at one\npoint was widely claimed by commentators and critics indifferent to\nwhat we had set down in print, [\u2026] nowhere denies the existence of an\nexternal world.\u20196\nSokal and Bricmont draw a helpful distinction between \u2018specific\nscepticism\u2019 and \u2018radical scepticism.\u20197 One may have, they say, legitimate\ndoubts about a specific theory, but one should not use general sceptical\narguments to support those specific doubts. For example, one may\nlegitimately doubt a theory of evidence which explains evidential\nforce by reference to a mind- and belief-independent world, but one\nshould not try to support such doubt with a global scepticism about\nthe very existence of that world. This distinction is helpful because it\nexposes the source of difference in the respective reactions to SSK of the\nscientists, Sokal and Bricmont, on the one hand, and the philosophers,\non the other. SSK casts doubt not on the idea of evidence, as such, but\ninstead on specific philosophical theories of evidence which insist that\n4 S okal and Bricmont (1998), Fashionable Nonsense, p. 189.\n5 S okal and Bricmont (1998), Fashionable Nonsense, p. 90.\n6 B arry Barnes (2011), \u2018Relativism as a Completion of the Scientific Project,\u2019 in The\nProblem of Relativism in the Sociology of (Scientific) Knowledge, ed. by Richard Schantz\nand Markus Seidel (Frankfurt: Ontos Verlag), pp. 23\u201339 (p. 26 n. 3).\n7 S okal and Bricmont (1998), Fashionable Nonsense, p. 189. 20 Science as Social Existence\nevidential force must be explained in exclusively non-naturalistic and/\nor non-social terms. Since Sokal and Bricmont, as natural scientists,\nhave no vested interest in these particular philosophical theories,\nthey can treat naturalistic and sociological explanations of evidence\nas unobjectionable. The philosopher warriors, in contrast, were\nlargely trained and continue to work in a tradition deeply invested in\nindividualistic and/or transcendental theories of evidence, and so their\nreaction to SSK has understandably been less relaxed. Furthermore,\nthese philosophers have apparently had a hard time recognising the\ndifference between their own specific theories of evidence and a general\nbelief in the existence of an external world. Hence, they have tended\nto mistake a specific scepticism targeted at the former for a global\nscepticism also encompassing the latter.\nReturning to Collins\u2019s parable, we see that philosophers are often\nin the business of working out the rational basis for the acceptance of\nbelief. Sociologists, in contrast, seek to explain consensus concerning\nthe acceptability of belief. These two approaches are closely related, and\ntheir proximity explains the friction between them. Both philosophers\nand sociologists investigate the reasons for accepting a belief.8 For the\nsociologist, this entails describing the social negotiations through\nwhich reasons come to be agreed on. For the philosopher, in contrast,\nthe focus is on the rational rules determining such agreement. Where\nthe sociologist speaks of social negotiations, the philosopher speaks of\nrational rules. It is precisely on the question of how social negotiation\nand rational rules relate to one another that the two sides part company,\nfor the sociologist insists that the validity of rules is a matter of social\n8 This point has not always been appreciated. Jim Brown, for example, alleges that\nSSK practitioners refuse to admit reasons into their causal accounts of knowledge,\nwriting that, for prominent SSK practitioner David Bloor, \u2018reasons simply aren\u2019t\ncauses\u2019 (James Robert Brown (2001), Who Rules in Science? An Opinionated Guide\nto the Science Wars (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press), p. 151). However,\nBrown also admits that \u2018Bloor does not say this in so many words, but it is clearly\nimplicit in all that he does\u2019 (p. 150). In fact, Bloor has explicitly affirmed the\nimportance of reasons, and called for their sociological analysis (David Bloor (1984),\n\u2018The Sociology of Reasons: Or Why \u201cEpistemic Factors\u201d Are Really \u201cSocial Factors,\u201d\u2019\nin Scientific Rationality: The Sociological Turn, ed. by James Robert Brown (Dordecht:\nReidel), pp. 295\u2013324.). Barry Barnes has also written that \u2018there is no necessary\nincompatibility between reasons and causes as explanations\u2019 (Barry Barnes (1974),\nScientific Knowledge and Sociological Theory (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul), p.\n70). The real bone of contention between Brown and SSK is not whether reasons\ncan be causes but whether reasons can be analysed in naturalistic and sociological\nterms. 1. SSK, Phenomenology, and the Problem of the External World 21\nnegotiation, while the philosopher typically insists that it is not. In other\nwords, the sociologist endorses, and the philosopher rejects, the view\nthat rationality is a necessarily social phenomenon.\nIn the natural sciences, the reasons grounding a belief include the\nevidence educed in its favour. Empirical data, produced and selected\nusing rational methods, may count as evidence in support of that belief.\nThe job of the philosopher is to work out the rational basis for a scientific\nbelief by demonstrating the rationality of the methods by which the\nevidence for it was educed. Only if those methods are deemed rational\ncan one feel confident that the data successfully represents the world\nas it really is. Hence, from the philosopher\u2019s perspective, according\nto which the rational and the social must be strictly separated, the\nsociologist\u2019s attempt to model rational method in sociological terms is\nviewed as an attack on the ability of science to produce authoritative\nrepresentations of the natural world. If scientific methods are stripped\nof their authority, then scientific beliefs will lose their purchase on the\nworld. The result will be a global scepticism about the existence of an\nexternal world \u2014 that is, a world existing external to, or independently\nof, the system of beliefs and methods partly constitutive of the scientific\nenterprise. But SSK practitioners are not global sceptics. They do not\nreject science\u2019s authority to successfully represent an external world.\nThey instead reinterpret that authority in sociological and naturalistic\nterms. For those philosophers whose confidence in science is heavily\ninvested in a non-sociological and/or non-naturalistic conception\nof its methods and results, this reinterpretation is both objectionable\nand antiscientific. Hence, they mistake SSK practitioners\u2019 rejection\nof their specific philosophical conception of scientific authority for\na more sweeping, global rejection of the authority of science, as such.\nTaking scientific method to be an instrument of theory, David Bloor,\nanother co-founder of SSK\u2019s Edinburgh School, writes that \u2018[i]t is not\ntheories but theorists who generate the evidential force of experimental\nresults.\u20199 Bloor does not reject evidence; he rather advises its sociological\nreinterpretation.\n9 David Bloor (2003), \u2018Skepticism and the Social Construction of Science and\nTechnology: The Case of the Boundary Layer,\u2019 in The Skeptics: Contemporary Essays,\ned. by Steven Luper (Aldershot: Ashgate), pp. 249\u201365 (p. 262). Together with David\nEdge, Bloor has also argued that something can count as evidence only within an\nagreed on theoretical framework. An account of the social processes through which\nsuch agreement is reached is thus a necessary, though not a sufficient, condition for 22 Science as Social Existence\nIt is not clear that philosophers\u2019 worries about the allegedly\nantiscientific and objectionable nature of SSK also reflect the worries of\nscientists. Returning to our physicist warriors, Sokal and Bricmont, we\nfind that they do not share the philosophers\u2019 need to rationally ground\nthe belief in an external world. Indeed, Sokal and Bricmont even declare\nglobal scepticism \u2018irrefutable,\u2019 which implies that the philosophers are,\nfrom a scientific point of view, wasting their time in attempting such\na refutation.10 These physicists have no particular interest in justifying\nthe authority of science by working out its rational basis, much less in\nensuring that that rational basis is strictly protected from sociological\nstudy. They simply take it for granted that science rationally represents\nthe world, and they get on with their research. Hence, there is, from their\npoint of view, nothing particularly antiscientific, nor, as we saw above,\notherwise objectionable, about SSK\u2019s move to introduce sociological\ncategories into naturalistic explanations of scientific rationality.\nAs we will see in this chapter, SSK practitioners find themselves\nstuck somewhere between scientists and philosophers on these issues.\nAs social scientists, they too are inclined to simply ignore the threat\nof global scepticism, taking for granted that their methods rationally\nrepresent the world, and so just getting on with their research. On the\nother hand, as social epistemologists, they also show signs of wanting\nto construct a global account of scientific knowledge which reveals\nits ineliminably social elements. The tension between these two goals\nhas sometimes created confusion and conflict in SSK\u2019s ranks over the\nquestion of its relationship to scepticism.\nI will not seek in this chapter to further defend SSK against the science\nwarriors\u2019 erroneous accusations of global scepticism. I will instead\ntake up the more interesting challenge of strengthening SSK\u2019s genuine\nbut underdeveloped anti-sceptical orientation. First, I will outline the\nconfusions and conflicts among SSK practitioners regarding scepticism;\nI will then identify the root cause of those confusions and conflicts;\nfinally, I will suggest a resolution to these difficulties by drawing from\nthe existential phenomenology of Martin Heidegger.\nany adequate theory of evidence (David Bloor and David Edge (2000), \u2018Knowing\nReality through Society,\u2019 Social Studies of Science 30(1), 158\u201360 (p. 159)).\n10 Sokal and Bricmont (1998), Fashionable Nonsense, p. 189. 1. SSK, Phenomenology, and the Problem of the External World 23\nAlthough SSK practitioners have often represented their research\nas being committed to some form of scepticism, there is no consensus\namong them on what precisely underpins this commitment. Indeed,\nin some cases there is outright disagreement. This is most evident in\ntheir divergent attitudes towards the challenge presented by external-\nworld scepticism. One camp defends an explicitly realist position\nregarding the existence of an external world, while the other camp\nshows no interest at all in defending such realism. I will argue that\nthis disagreement is largely superficial. My argument turns on the\nidea, taken from Heidegger, that external-world scepticism is an\nepistemological problem which leaves unexamined a number of\nimportant metaphysical presuppositions. The most important of these\npresuppositions is that our experience of things is best interpreted in\nterms of a fundamental ontological distinction between a \u2018subject\u2019 and\nan \u2018object.\u2019 On this interpretation, the subject experiences itself as a\ndiscrete, cognising agent seeking access to the world experienced as\nan external object. The question of how such access may be achieved\nis often referred to as the \u2018problem of knowledge,\u2019 a core concern\nof orthodox epistemology. Crucially, the legitimacy of this problem\npresupposes the validity of the subject-object distinction. As we will\nsee, a commitment to this distinction, and hence to the intelligibility of\nthe question of access, is the engine driving external-world scepticism.\nIn treating external-world scepticism as a legitimate threat, to which\na response must be made, SSK practitioners of all stripes demonstrate\ntheir shared ontological commitment to the subject-object distinction.\nAs a consequence, they are at perpetual risk of attack by the external-\nworld sceptic. Their internal dispute over how to properly respond to\nthe sceptic is a symptom of their residual adherence to an orthodox\nmodel of subjectivity, a model which asserts the fundamental\nseparation of subject and object, mind and world.\nAfter thus diagnosing the shared conceptual ailment of SSK\npractitioners, I will turn to the work of Martin Heidegger for a suitable\ntreatment. In response to external-world scepticism, Heidegger launched\na phenomenological inquiry into the basic ways in which a cognising\nsubject experiences its relation to the world. He conceptualised this\nexperience in existential terms as an experience of \u2018being-in-the-world.\u2019\nOn Heidegger\u2019s account, the most basic form of being-in-the-world 24 Science as Social Existence\nis an experience of immersed involvement in a world of work.11 The\nepistemological problem of how the subject gains access to an external\nworld is neutralised once one recognises that subject and world were\nnever separated in the first place. The chapter will conclude with the\nsuggestion that, by adopting Heidegger\u2019s existential phenomenology,\nSSK practitioners can overcome the conflicts and confusions which\nhave, until now, rendered their position vulnerable to sceptical attack.\n2. Scepticism and SSK\nCentral figures in SSK have clearly emphasised the importance of\nscepticism for their work. Reflecting on the issue in his 1974 book,\nScientific Knowledge and Sociological Theory, Barry Barnes writes that \u2018the\nepistemological message of the work [\u2026] is sceptical.\u2019 Harry Collins\nhas likewise applied \u2018philosophical scepticism\u2019 explicitly in his own\nresearch, and Steven Shapin has declared pointedly that \u2018SSK is [\u2026]\na form of scepticism.\u201912 Yet, although Barnes, Collins, and Shapin have\nmade striking use of sceptical techniques in their work, they have\nnot offered any substantial reflections on scepticism as a method of\nsociological analysis. David Bloor has proven more forthcoming. His\npioneering work in the methodology of SSK explicitly discusses and\nextensively builds on sceptical techniques. Given these credentials, it\nis noteworthy that Bloor offers a somewhat more guarded assessment\n11 The word \u2018involvement\u2019 is a standard, if imperfect, translation for Heidegger\u2019s word\nBewandtnis. In fact, one may argue that no single English word adequately translates\nBewandtnis. Nevertheless, for present purposes, \u2018involvement\u2019 sufficiently captures\nthe relevant meaning. Note, however, that Bewandtnis also carries a connotation\nof \u2018directedness,\u2019 which will prove central in later discussions. In Chapter Four,\nfor example, I will translate Bewandtnis as \u2018assignedness.\u2019 In Chapter Five, I will\nintroduce a highly specific, philosophically charged translation of Bewandtnis as\n\u2018end-directedness.\u2019\n12 Barnes (1974), Scientific Knowledge, p. 154; Harry M. Collins (1992), Changing Order:\nReplication and Induction in Scientific Practice (Chicago: University of Chicago Press),\np. 3; Shapin (1995), \u2018Here and Everywhere: Sociology of Scientific Knowledge,\u2019\nAnnual Review of Sociology 21, 289\u2013321 (p. 314). Beno\u00eet Godin and Yves Gingras reveal\nthe striking parallels between Collins\u2019s position and the scepticism of Montaigne\nand Sextus Empiricus, a comparison which Collins describes as \u2018delicious\u2019 (Beno\u00eet\nGodin and Yves Gingras (2002), \u2018The Experimenter\u2019s Regress: From Skepticism to\nArgumentation,\u2019 Studies in History and Philosophy of Science 33(1), 133\u201348; Harry M.\nCollins (2002), \u2018The Experimenter\u2019s Regress as Philosophical Sociology,\u2019 Studies in\nHistory and Philosophy of Science 33(1), 153\u201360 (p. 153)). 1. SSK, Phenomenology, and the Problem of the External World 25\nof SSK\u2019s relation to scepticism than do Barnes, Collins, and Shapin.\nRather than identifying SSK as a form of scepticism, Bloor draws a clear\nline between the two while at the same time stressing their productive\ninteraction.\nScepticism will always find the sociology of knowledge useful and\nvice versa. But there are profound differences between the two\nattitudes. Sceptics will try to use the explanation of a belief to establish\nits falsehood. [\u2026] The conclusion will be a self-defeating nihilism or\ninconsistent special pleading. It is only an epistemological complacency,\nwhich allows us to feel that we can explain without destroying, that can\nprovide a secure basis for the sociology of knowledge.13\nBloor rejects an identification of SSK with scepticism because SSK\nseeks to explain scientific knowledge whereas scepticism is, in his view,\ncorrosive of all such explanatory attempts. According to Bloor, if SSK\nwere itself a form of scepticism, then it would end up undermining its\nown explanatory project.\nThere appears, then, to be a significant disagreement between Barnes,\nCollins, and Shapin, on the one hand, and Bloor, on the other, over\nSSK\u2019s relation to scepticism. However, this apparent disagreement may\nbe resolved by introducing a distinction between \u2018radical scepticism,\u2019\non the one hand, and \u2018mitigated scepticism,\u2019 on the other.14 Radical\nscepticism is as Bloor describes it: a persistent acid of relentless doubt\nwhich dissolves any and all claims to knowledge. It endeavours to push\nus into a state of complete disbelief, leaving us without any signposts\nby which to take our bearings in the world. Mitigated scepticism, on\nthe other hand, attempts to absorb the full impact of sceptical doubt\nwithout having to thereby relinquish all claims to knowledge. It relies\non a distinction between knowledge in an absolutist and a relativist\nsense. Mitigated sceptics agree with radical sceptics that knowledge\nin the first sense is impossible, but they also argue that knowledge\nin the second sense is both possible and defensible. Hence, mitigated\nscepticism is not corrosive of belief in general; rather, it isolates and\nrejects the specific belief that knowledge, as such, must necessarily rest\n13 David Bloor (1991 [1976]), Knowledge and Social Imagery, 2nd edn (Chicago:\nUniversity of Chicago Press), p. 82.\n14 I have taken the term \u2018mitigated scepticism\u2019 from Richard H. Popkin (1979), The\nHistory of Scepticism from Erasmus to Spinoza (Berkley: University of California Press). 26 Science as Social Existence\non an absolute foundation, that is, a foundation which transcends any\nand every contingent social and historical circumstance.\nThus, when Bloor proposes that we exercise \u2018epistemological\ncomplacency\u2019 in the face of the sceptic\u2019s challenge, he is specifically\nconcerned with radical scepticism. What Bloor proposes is not so\nmuch a direct defence against the sceptic as it is a strategy whereby the\nsceptic is simply ignored. He appears to hold that certain of our beliefs\nmust be taken for granted, regardless of whether or not we can ground\nthose beliefs in a way which satisfies the sceptic. Here Bloor seems to\nagree with Ludwig Wittgenstein, who observed that, when it comes to\nfollowing the rules which guide thinking, just because a rule may lack a\nrational ground, this does not necessarily mean that we have no right to\nfollow it.15 In such cases, writes Wittgenstein, we follow the rule blindly.\nThe philosopher Paul Boghossian describes this as a \u2018blind entitlement\u2019\nto follow a rule or to assert a belief.16 For example, as we shall see in the\nnext section, Bloor claims that we are blindly entitled to assert a belief\nin the existence of the external world, and so scepticism regarding this\nbelief should be met with a deliberate complacency.\nWhen Barnes, Collins, and Shapin, on the other hand, urge that SSK\nbe understood as a form of scepticism, they are specifically concerned\nwith mitigated scepticism. According to them, SSK is sceptical because\nit rejects an understanding of knowledge in terms of absolute truth.\nThis does not mean that knowledge becomes impossible, but only that it\ncan never be rendered certain in an absolutist sense. For Barnes, Collins,\nand Shapin, SSK can be sceptical and yet still affirm the possibility of\nknowledge by accepting a more modest, or mitigated, conception of\ntruth and validity.\nThe apparent disagreement between Barnes, Collins, and Shapin,\non the one hand, and Bloor, on the other, thus turns out to be largely\nsuperficial. In their respective assessments of the relationship between\nSSK and scepticism, each side has a different brand of scepticism in\n15 Ludwig Wittgenstein (1958), Philosophical Investigations, 3rd edn, trans. by G. E. M.\nAnscombe (Oxford: Basil Blackwell), \u00a7219.\n16 Paul A. Boghossian (2006), Fear of Knowledge: Against Relativism and Constructivism\n(Oxford: Clarendon Press), p. 99. Bloor has deflected Boghossian\u2019s attempt to\nuse blind entitlement against the sociology of knowledge (David Bloor (2007),\n\u2018Epistemic Grace: Antirelativism as Theology in Disguise,\u2019 Common Knowledge\n13(2\u20133), 250\u201380 (pp. 259\u201361)). 1. SSK, Phenomenology, and the Problem of the External World 27\nmind. In fact, both sides endorse a mitigated scepticism which stands\nopposed to an attitude characteristic of those whom Bloor calls \u2018believers.\u2019\nBelievers, he writes, \u2018conflate the common currency of talk about the\ntrue and the good with specific theories of the real and ultimate nature\nof the True and the Good.\u201917 In other words, believers reach beyond the\nrealm of everyday experience in order to make absolutist claims about\nthe nature of knowledge and reality. For this reason, they might also be\ndescribed as fundamentalists, or dogmatists.18 The benefit of scepticism\nfor SSK has been its role in revealing the dogmatism at the heart of\nepistemic absolutism. SSK accepts the general sceptical claim that\nabsolute knowledge is impossible, but rejects the radical sceptic\u2019s more\nthoroughgoing conclusion that knowledge, as such, is impossible. As\nBloor remarks in the passage cited earlier, the radical sceptic\u2019s conclusion\namounts to a self-defeating nihilism or an inconsistent special pleading.\nIndeed, it would seem that the radical sceptic helps herself to the very\nabsolutism she is bent on destroying. It turns out, then, that to reject\nepistemic absolutism is also to reject a fundamental premise motivating\nthe radical sceptic\u2019s own position. This is precisely what SSK does. The\nresult is a mitigated sceptical position which endorses a non-absolutist\ntheory of knowledge.\n3. SSK and External-World Realism\nSSK\u2019s rejection of radical scepticism is perhaps most evident in SSK\npractitioners\u2019 affirmation of the existence of an external world. In fact,\nthey appear almost unified in asserting that a belief in the existence\nof an external world is a necessary condition for social life.19 Shapin\nwrites that such a presumption is \u2018common sense,\u2019 and \u2018a precondition\nfor communication.\u2019 Barnes, Bloor, and John Henry claim that \u2018people\neverywhere\u2019 make reference to an external world, and that their\nmastery of \u2018the realist mode of speaking\u2019 serves them with \u2018marvellous\n17 David Bloor (1998), \u2018A Civil Scepticism,\u2019 Social Studies of Science 28(4), 655\u201365 (p.\n657).\n18 Cf. Barry Barnes and David Bloor (1982), \u2018Relativism, Rationalism and the Sociology\nof Knowledge,\u2019 in Rationality and Relativism, ed. by Martin Hollis and Steve Lukes\n(Oxford: Blackwell), pp. 21\u201347 (p. 46).\n19 As we shall see, Harry Collins is an exception warranting the qualified phrase\n\u2018almost unified.\u2019 28 Science as Social Existence\nefficiency.\u2019 They recommend that such realism be accepted as the\nstandard for the sociology of knowledge. Bloor, for his part, asserts\nthat \u2018we are all instinctive realists,\u2019 and that socialisation would be\nimpossible in the absence of an external world. Barnes claims that \u2018we\nare obliged to presuppose an external world in order to act and interact.\u201920\nIt seems clear, then, that SSK is strongly committed to the minimal\nrealist doctrine that an external world exists independently of our\ninterpretations and practices. This is made all the more evident in SSK\npractitioners\u2019 consistent efforts to defend themselves against charges of\nidealism. Indeed, Barnes, Bloor, and Henry even reserve the final lines\nof their book-length introduction to SSK for a repudiation of the claim\nthat theirs is \u2018an idealist sociological account which denies the existence\nof an external world,\u2019 and they spend considerable time elsewhere in\nthe book divorcing themselves from the \u2018methodological idealism\u2019 of\nthe allegedly renegade SSK practitioner, Harry Collins. In addition,\nBloor has offered his own lengthy defence of SSK against the charge of\nidealism.21\nThe locus classicus for SSK\u2019s position on realism is Barnes\u2019s 1992 paper,\n\u2018Realism, Relativism and Finitism.\u2019 Here, Barnes too is motivated by the\nneed to secure SSK\u2019s realist credentials against charges of idealism. He\nbegins by arguing that sociological relativists have been typically, but\nunjustifiably, lumped together with idealists because orthodox realists\ncommonly exaggerate the minimum criteria which one must meet in\norder to be counted a legitimate realist. Not only do orthodox realists\nrequire that an external world exist independently of our interpretations\nand practices, they also claim that we can know specific features of that\nworld independently of those interpretations and practices.22 Barnes\n20 Steven Shapin (1994), A Social History of Truth: Civility and Science in Seventeenth-\nCentury England (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), pp. 29, 30; Barry Barnes,\nDavid Bloor and John Henry (1996), Scientific Knowledge: A Sociological Analysis\n(London: Athlone), pp. 88, 205 n. 3; David Bloor (1996), \u2018Idealism and the Sociology\nof Knowledge,\u2019 Social Studies of Science 26(4), 839\u201356 (p. 845); Barry Barnes\n(1992a), \u2018Relativism, Realism and Finitism,\u2019 in Cognitive Realism and Social Science,\ned. by Diederick Raven, Lietke van Vucht and Jan de Wolf (New Brunswick, NJ:\nTransaction), pp. 131\u201347 (p. 139).\n21 Barnes, Bloor and Henry (1996), Scientific Knowledge, pp. 202, 13\u201315, 75\u201376; Bloor\n(1996), \u2018Idealism and the Sociology of Knowledge,\u2019 passim.\n22 Stathis Psillos argues that this second claim is \u2018a basic philosophical presupposition\nof scientific realism\u2019 (Stathis Psillos (1999), Scientific Realism: How Science Tracks\nthe Truth (London: Routledge), p. xix). Ian Hacking disparages this claim with the 1. SSK, Phenomenology, and the Problem of the External World 29\nargues that this ambitious claim, quite apart from its plausibility, is\nsimply unnecessary if all one wishes to do is affirm the existence, as\nsuch, of the external world. And this is all Barnes\u2019s relativistic realist\nwishes to do. The result is a minimal form of realism which recognises\nthe independent existence of the external world while also declining\nto attribute any independent, or inherent, properties to that world.23\nAlthough it is less ambitious than the more robust position of many\nscientific realists, Barnes\u2019s modest, or, as he calls it, \u2018residual,\u2019 realism\nappears nonetheless sufficient to deflect the charge of idealism.\nProblems arise, however, when Barnes attempts to justify this\nposition. Under the heading \u2018Justifications for a Residual Realism,\u2019 he\nwrites that \u2018[t]here is nothing empty in the assertion that an external\nindependent reality exists, underlying appearances. It is an assertion\nwhich does real work in a variety of contexts both in science and in\nphilosophy.\u201924 Note Barnes\u2019s endorsement, in this passage, of the ancient\ndistinction between appearance and reality, a distinction which has\nplayed a central role in historical debates between idealists and realists.\nThe idealist typically claims that appearances are the only things we\ncan know exist, while the realist claims that we can also know that an\nexternal world exists and that it underlies appearances. Yet, note too\nthat Barnes does not actually argue for the existence of the external\nworld, but only for the utility of the assertion that such a world exists:\nasserting the existence of an external world has proven an effective\nstrategy in diverse scientific and philosophical contexts. This agrees\nwith Barnes, Bloor, and Henry\u2019s statement, cited above, that people\neverywhere use the realist mode of speaking with marvellous efficiency.\nBarnes makes this point forcefully with respect to explanations for\nchanges in knowledge, arguing that \u2018primitive causal inputs from an\nexternal reality may operate on us so that we change our knowledge.\u2019\ndeliberately unpleasant name \u2018inherent-structurism\u2019 (Ian Hacking (1999), The Social\nConstruction of What? (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press), p. 83).\n23 For this reason, Shapin would seem wrong to ascribe a \u2018robust realism\u2019 to SSK\nin general (Steven Shapin (1995), \u2018Here and Everywhere: Sociology of Scientific\nKnowledge,\u2019 Annual Review of Sociology 21, 289\u2013321 (p. 315)). He furthermore\nappears to endorse the second, stronger, claim of the orthodox realist when he\nwrites that \u2018the external world [\u2026] has a determinate structure\u2019 (Steven Shapin\n(1994), A Social History of Truth: Civility and Science in Seventeenth-Century England\n(Chicago: University of Chicago Press), p. 4).\n24 Barnes (1992a), \u2018Relativism, Realism, and Finitism,\u2019 p. 137. 30 Science as Social Existence\nThe external world is the source of primitive, \u2018unverbalized\u2019 causes for\n\u2018dissatisfaction\u2019 with existing knowledge, and hence provides \u2018incentives\u2019\nfor changing that knowledge. Barnes favourably contrasts this position\nwith idealism, which he argues cannot plausibly explain changes in\nknowledge. Specifically, he claims that idealists, because they eschew\nthe concept of the external world, are unable to rationalise a \u2018sense of\nfailure.\u201925 The point seems to be that idealists have no way of explaining\nhow one becomes dissatisfied with the state of one\u2019s knowledge and\nhence no way of explaining how one becomes motivated to change that\nknowledge. Leaving aside the question of whether or not Barnes has\noffered a fair description of the idealist\u2019s position, it should be clear\nthat this is not an argument for the existence of the external world, but\nonly for the efficaciousness of realist talk about the external world\nas compared with idealist strategies allegedly forbidding such talk.\nHence, it is commensurate with Barnes\u2019s position that the distinctions\nbetween realism and idealism, and between reality and appearance,\nare distinctions made within the realm of discourse, and that, as such,\nthey can tell us nothing about the discourse-independent existence\nof the external world. Barnes thus fails to provide a justification for\nexternal-world realism which accords with the realist\u2019s own minimal\nontological commitments. In fact, he even concludes his discussion\nwith an admission of this failure, thus leaving the issue unresolved.26\nAs a result, Barnes leaves the door open for a sceptical construal of his\nposition as a form of linguistic idealism.\nYet perhaps this need not trouble the SSK practitioner. Although\nBarnes has not successfully answered the sceptic\u2019s challenge to\n25 Barnes (1992a), \u2018Relativism, Realism, and Finitism,\u2019 pp. 137\u201338.\n26 Barnes (1992a), \u2018Relativism, Realism, and Finitism, p. 139. Note that, some years\nearlier, Barnes had written: \u2018I am not a realist, but an instrumentalist and a relativist\u2019\n(Barry Barnes (1981), \u2018On the \u201cHows\u201d and \u201cWhys\u201d of Cultural Change (Response\nto Woolgar),\u2019 Social Studies of Science 11(4), 481\u201398 (p. 493)). Yet, even back then, he\nenthusiastically endorsed \u2018a realist mode of speech\u2019 as \u2018a marvellous instrument\u2019\n(Barnes (1981), \u2018On the \u201cHows\u201d and \u201cWhys,\u201d\u2019 p. 493). In these earlier passages,\nBarnes seems to want to distance himself from the robust realism characteristic of\nscientific realists. Only later did he develop a more nuanced perspective, introducing\nthe relativistic, or \u2018residual,\u2019 form of realism which is my primary interest here, and\nwhich I will discuss more thoroughly in Chapter Two. More on the topic of SSK and\nrealism can be found in Jeff Kochan (2008), \u2018Realism, Reliabilism, and the \u201cStrong\nProgramme\u201d in the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge,\u2019 International Studies in the\nPhilosophy of Science 22(1), 21\u201338. 1. SSK, Phenomenology, and the Problem of the External World 31\nexternal-world realism, it may be that the failure lies not so much with\nhis attempted justification as with the fact that he had even attempted\nto provide one. A more effective response to the sceptic may be found in\nBloor\u2019s epistemological complacency. As cited above, Bloor holds that\n\u2018we are all instinctive realists,\u2019 Barnes that \u2018we are obliged to presuppose\nan external world in order to act and interact,\u2019 and Shapin that external-\nworld realism is \u2018a precondition for communication.\u2019 If it were true that\nexternal-world realism is a matter of instinct or obligation, a necessary\ncondition for social existence, then one might well wonder if radical\nscepticism about the external world is really worth the candle. Barnes,\nBloor, and Henry make clear that their external-world realism is of a\n\u2018naive\u2019 sort, that it is, above all, a \u2018common-sense\u2019 kind of realism.27 If\nthis were indeed the case, then deliberate complacency with respect to\nthe sceptic\u2019s challenge would surely be the most reasonable strategy.\nThis is, however, far from the case.\nExternal-world realism is neither as naive, nor as commonsensical,\nas it may at first seem. Not only does it take for granted the ancient\ndistinction between appearance and reality, it also presupposes a\nparticular model of the subject. Consider the sentence with which the\nphilosopher Thomas Nagel begins his discussion of external-world\nscepticism: \u2018If you think about it, the inside of your mind is the only thing\nyou can be sure of.\u201928 As Nagel goes on to show, from this starting point\nthe problem of justifying the existence of an external world naturally\nflows. For if the only thing that self-evidently exists is the inside of one\u2019s\nown mind, then it must follow, not only that there is likely to be an\noutside with respect to one\u2019s mind, but that the existence of this outside\nis not itself self-evident but in need of proof. The question of whether\nor not such a proof can be given forms the nucleus of external-world\nscepticism. These distinctions between mind and world, between an\ninside and an outside to one\u2019s own consciousness, between appearance\nand reality, between subject and object, together form a bundle of closely\nrelated and mutually supportive conceptual demarcations which are\ndeeply rooted in the modern intellectual tradition. We thus seem to\nhave at hand an explanation for the strange and apparently widespread\n27 Barnes, Bloor and Henry (1996), Scientific Knowledge, pp. 88, 205 n. 3.\n28 Thomas Nagel (1987), What Does It All Mean? A Very Short Introduction to Philosophy\n(New York: Oxford University Press), p. 8. 32 Science as Social Existence\ntendency, at least among academically trained scholars, to conceive of\nthe physical world as a specifically external world. This tendency seems\nto be motivated, in significant part, by the prior, tacit interpretation of\nour own subjectivity as constituting an internal world, a world of the\nmind. The notion of an external world, a world out there, and the notion\nof an inside to our mind, a world in here, are thus as inextricably bound\ntogether as, say, the inside and outside of a glass bulb. On this model,\nthe mind \u2014 as the seat of our experience \u2014 is like the interior of a sealed\nbulb, an autonomous substance existing in isolation from the bulb\u2019s\nexterior. The external-world sceptic accepts and exploits the glass-bulb\nmodel, challenging the credibility of modern epistemologies which\nclaim that the interior of the bulb can access the exterior, that the mind,\nwhether individual or collective, can penetrate the barrier separating it\nfrom the external world so as to achieve knowledge of that world. If this\ndiagnostic model is correct, then it would seem that the struggle to meet\nthe challenge of the external-world sceptic was lost even before it began.\nFor if all one can be certain of is the \u2018inside\u2019 of one\u2019s own mind, and if\nthe world is construed as being both external to and independent of that\nmind, then one will never succeed in proving beyond doubt that such\na world exists. Indeed, Barnes has also endorsed what he calls \u2018external\nrealism,\u2019 the position that our knowledge is of \u2018something out there,\u2019 but\nhe also admits that this position \u2018cannot be justified.\u201929\nYet, following Bloor\u2019s strategy of epistemological complacency,\nif the intellectual conventions represented by the glass-bulb model\nwere found to be wholly commonsensical, if not entirely naive, then\nthe external-world realist may still claim a blind entitlement to these\nconventions even in the absence of rational justification. In other words,\nif we felt obliged to accept the glass-bulb model, if we felt ourselves\nunder a powerful compulsion to adopt this model as a precondition for\ncommunication, if such acceptance were a matter of primitive instinct\nrather than of conscious deliberation, then we may well be justified\nin responding to the sceptic\u2019s challenge with nothing more than a\ncomplacent wave of the hand.\n29 Barry Barnes (2004), \u2018On Social Constructivist Accounts of the Natural Sciences,\u2019 in\nKnowledge and the World: Challenges beyond the Science Wars, ed. by Martin Carrier,\nJohannes Roggenhofer, G\u00fcnter K\u00fcppers and Philippe Blanchard (Berlin: Springer),\npp. 105\u201336 (pp. 111, 119; emphasis added). 1. SSK, Phenomenology, and the Problem of the External World 33\nHowever, the glass-bulb model represents just one, albeit\npowerful, thread in the modern intellectual tradition. Well-established\nand increasingly influential alternatives to this model exist in the\ncomparatively recent movements of American pragmatism and\nEuropean phenomenology. What is more, these alternatives have\nalready begun to earn a respected place within the broader field of\nscience studies. As a consequence, science studies scholars can no\nlonger take external-world realism for granted as a self-evidently valid\nposition, nor can they reasonably respond to the sceptical challenge\nto this position with complacency. As a consequence, SSK is neither\nrationally justified in nor blindly entitled to maintain its commitment\nto external-world realism.\n4. Phenomenology and the \u2018Natural Attitude\u2019\nIn the remainder of this chapter, and, indeed, in all subsequent chapters,\nI will explore the benefits of combining SSK with the existential\nphenomenology of Martin Heidegger. My aim in this chapter is to\ndemonstrate that Heidegger\u2019s early analysis of subjectivity can provide\nSSK with an effective response to the challenge posed by the external-\nworld sceptic.\nSSK is certainly no stranger to the methods of phenomenology.\nIndeed, several SSK practitioners have made significant use of the\nphenomenological concept of \u2018natural attitude,\u2019 that is, the idea that\nour conscious beliefs always presuppose a more fundamental, tacitly\nheld attitude which must already be in place before we can even\nbegin to make sense of our experiences, much less communicate those\nexperiences to others. So, for example, within the context of scientific\npractice, Barnes, Bloor, and Henry describe the claim that an experiment\nproved a theory because the theory is true as \u2018a very natural attitude to\nadopt. [\u2026] Indeed, it is the natural attitude.\u201930 Yet, as they point out, the\nreasoning behind such an attitude is clearly invalid. The truth of the\ntheory is explained by the success of the experiment, and the success\nof the experiment is explained by the truth of the theory. This kind of\nreasoning is most common with very well-established scientific theories,\n30 B arnes, Bloor and Henry (1996), Scientific Knowledge, p. 30. 34 Science as Social Existence\nfor example, electron theory. Barnes, Bloor, and Henry emphasise that\nit is wholly natural to explain the success of Robert Millikan\u2019s famous\noil-drop experiment, which first measured the electron charge in the\nearly 1910s, by reference to the truth of electron theory. Yet, Millikan\u2019s\nexperiment is also accepted as an important confirmation of that theory.\nIt turns out, then, that the natural attitude with respect to electron theory\nis not logically valid. However, this observation is not meant to discredit\nour belief in the truth of electron theory. On the contrary, it is consistent\nwith this attitude that we are, under ordinary circumstances, blindly\nentitled to such a belief even if we cannot logically justify it. In other\nwords, under such circumstances we have a right to be epistemically\ncomplacent about the truth of electron theory.\nHowever, Barnes, Bloor, and Henry argue that the sociologist of\nknowledge is not working under ordinary circumstances, and hence\nshe should not take the natural attitude for granted. As opposed\nto the physicist, who immerses herself in the practice of science, the\nsociologist\u2019s goal is to stand back from such practice in order to analyse\nhow and why it works. Rather than adopting a natural complacency\nwith respect to the truth of well-established theories, the SSK practitioner\nwill instead thematise this complacency in an attempt to illuminate the\nimportant role it plays in the smooth operation of physical science. In\nthe terminology of the phenomenologist, Barnes, Bloor, and Henry\nare recommending that the sociologist \u2018bracket\u2019 the scientist\u2019s natural\nattitude, that is, deliberately disengage from it, in order to more\neffectively analyse its structure. They suggest that it be turned from a\nresource into a topic for analysis.\nSSK practitioners have also employed the phenomenological notion\nof natural attitude in the context of knowledge about the external world.\nShapin, for example, declares that external-world realism is a direct\nconsequence of the natural attitude.31 However, rather than bracketing\nthis attitude in order to illuminate its structure and the role it plays\nin social life, he simply takes it for granted, treating it as if it were a\nuniversal and inescapable fact of human experience. As a result, Shapin\nleaves unaddressed the sceptical threat to SSK\u2019s affirmation of external-\nworld realism, as well as the ontological distinction between subject\nand object which gives rise to that threat. Collins likewise characterises\n31 Shapin (1994), A Social History of Truth, pp. 28\u201331. 1. SSK, Phenomenology, and the Problem of the External World 35\nthe natural attitude as an attitude \u2018taken to the external world in the\nnormal way of things.\u2019 However, he rejects this attitude, using instead\na \u2018philosophical scepticism\u2019 designed to initiate the methodological\n\u2018derailment of the mind from the tracks of common sense.\u201932 In other\nwords, unlike Shapin, Collins adopts a form of external-world scepticism.\nYet, as a consequence, he nevertheless joins Shapin in tacitly reaffirming\nthe bundle of distinctions which are represented and reinforced by the\nglass-bulb model. This has led to some confusion on the part of both\nCollins and his critics. Most importantly, Collins fails to distinguish\nsufficiently between external-world realism and realism as such. Thus, in\nrecommending the suspension of belief in the external world, he in fact\nends up going much further, arguing that \u2018all description-type language\nshould be treated at the outset as though it did not describe anything\nreal.\u2019 What Collins means, of course, is that language should not be taken\nto describe anything outside the social world. Indeed, he also writes that\n\u2018[i]t is in the social world that the social scientist [\u2026] should find reality\npersuasively located.\u201933 He calls this the natural attitude of the social\nscientist, and contrasts it with the natural attitude of the physical scientist,\nwherein the existence of a reality external to the social world is affirmed.\nCollins thus applies the term \u2018reality\u2019 in two quite distinct ways without\nalways signalling this difference to his readers. In the context of the social\nsciences, the term refers to the interior of the intersubjective, social world.\nIn the context of the natural sciences, the term refers beyond the social\nworld to an external natural world. These applications of the term are\nconsistent with idealism and realism respectively, and in both cases the\nglass-bulb model of subjectivity is taken for granted.\nWe are now in a position to shed further light on the long-standing\ndispute between Collins, on the one hand, and Barnes, Bloor, and Henry,\non the other. As mentioned in the previous section, Barnes, Bloor, and\nHenry take Collins to task for eschewing external-world realism and\nespousing a form of idealism instead. Yet, as we have now seen, both\nsides are equally wedded to the glass-bulb model. This model is taken\nfor granted by both, and it silently informs their respective arguments.\nIt thus figures as a central background assumption, a key element in\nthe natural attitude governing their respective positions. By failing\n32 H arry M. Collins (1982), \u2018Special Relativism \u2014 The Natural Attitude,\u2019 Social Studies\nof Science 12(1), 139\u201343 (p. 140); Collins (1992), Changing Order, p. 1.\n33 Collins (1992), Changing Order, p. 174; Collins (1982), \u2018Special Relativism,\u2019 p. 141. 36 Science as Social Existence\nto recognise that they hold this attitude in common, each side has\nmisunderstood the nature and depth of its disagreement with the other.\nThis is evident in the fact that Barnes\u2019s justification for external-world\nrealism is largely consistent with the natural attitude Collins endorses\non behalf of the social scientist. Collins argues that, for the social scientist,\nthe term \u2018reality\u2019 takes its meaning from the social world. Similarly,\nBarnes justifies the social scientist\u2019s use of realist talk on the basis of\nthe manifest utility of such talk in various scientific and philosophical\ncontexts. There is, it seems, no substantial difference between these\ntwo positions. On the other hand, there does appear to be an important\ndisagreement between the two sides with respect to the question of how\nseriously one should take external-world scepticism. Collins does take\nit seriously, and is thus willing to give up the idea of a world existing\nindependently of our interpretations and practices. Barnes, Bloor, and\nHenry, in contrast, choose not to treat external-world scepticism as a\nserious threat, and Bloor advises that it be met with complacency. I have\nsuggested that complacency does not provide an effective response to the\nexternal-world sceptic. Indeed, as Collins\u2019s own work shows, a clearly\narticulated commitment to external-world realism appears incidental to\nthe production of successful SSK research. Nevertheless, Barnes, Bloor,\nand Henry strongly insist on rejecting the sociological idealism implied\nby Collins\u2019s method. In their desire to distance themselves from the taint\nof idealism, Barnes, Bloor, and Henry reaffirm external-world realism\neven in the absence of appropriate justification, relying instead on an\nultimately unconvincing strategy of epistemological complacency.\nBoth sides of this dispute see no alternative between external-world\nrealism, on the one hand, and sociological idealism, on the other. The\nnarrowness of their vision is conditioned by their tacit adherence to a\ncontingent bundle of conceptual distinctions represented by the glass-\nbulb model. This model is itself a central element in the natural attitude\ncharacteristic of these SSK practitioners, and, as such, the cause of\nsome of their more persistent conceptual difficulties. I suggest that\nthese difficulties may be solved by bracketing the glass-bulb model,\nby declining to take it for granted, and thus disengaging from it in\norder to better understand its role in modern theoretical practice. With\nthis goal in mind, I now turn to the early phenomenological work of\nMartin Heidegger. 1. SSK, Phenomenology, and the Problem of the External World 37\n5. The Phenomenology of Subjectivity in\nHeidegger\u2019s Being and Time\nSo far, this chapter has largely focussed on a specific problem of\nknowledge, namely, the problem of how one can know that the external\nworld exists. The concern has thus been an epistemological one. Yet,\nas we have also seen, in asking this epistemological question, certain\nontological assumptions are also implicated. In particular, in asking\n\u2018How is knowledge of an external world possible?\u2019 the existence of\na knower is being tacitly asserted. Furthermore, as long as the focus\nof enquiry lies solely on the epistemological question, ontological\nquestions about the nature or \u2018being\u2019 of this knower \u2014 about the\nfundamental subjectivity of the subject \u2014 remain unasked. Under such\ncircumstances, the enquiry both relies on and persistently reaffirms a\nprior, tacit understanding of the ontological structure of the subject. I\nhave introduced the glass-bulb model in order to make this structure\nmore explicit.\nIn his 1927 book, Being and Time, Martin Heidegger holds the\northodox model of the subject up to scrutiny, and seeks to explain it\nin terms of a more fundamental phenomenological model. The chief\nobstacle for such an alternative model is the self-evident character\nof the received view. Heidegger argues that, as long as the orthodox\nmodel is taken for granted, the fundamental \u2018phenomenal content\u2019\n[ph\u00e4nomenale Bestand] of the subject \u2014 our basic experience of our own\nsubjectivity \u2014 remains hidden. In this section, we will review some\nkey aspects of Heidegger\u2019s account of this phenomenal content, and in\nthe next section we will consider the ways in which he brings these to\nbear on the challenge posed by external-world scepticism.34\nHeidegger attempts to loosen up intuitions about the self-evidence\nof the orthodox model of the subject by tracing its early-modern\n34 M artin Heidegger (1962a [1927]), Being and Time, trans. by John Macquarrie and\nEdward Robinson (Oxford: Blackwell), p. 72 [46]. (Following scholarly convention,\npage numbers in square brackets refer to the original 1927 German edition of\nBeing and Time.) The German word Bestand is a nominalisation of the verb bestehen,\nwhich can mean \u2018to exist,\u2019 \u2018to persist,\u2019 or \u2018to consist in.\u2019 It lacks the connotation of\n\u2018being contained within something\u2019 characteristic of the English word \u2018content.\u2019 In\nHeidegger\u2019s view, the subject is not a receptacle containing cognitive content; it is a\nself-aware, cognitively structured form of existence. 38 Science as Social Existence\ninstantiation back to early sources in ancient philosophy and late\nRenaissance Christian theology.35 In the former case, ancient Greek\nphilosophers, most notably Aristotle, defined the subject as z\u014don logon\nechon, later interpreted to mean \u2018animal rationale,\u2019 that is, a living thing\ncapable of reason. The first difficulty Heidegger notes is that the subject\nis here construed as a thing, a substance of some kind. The second is\nthat this substance-subject is then endowed with a power of reason the\nnature of which is left no less obscure than the ontological structure of the\ncompound entity taken as a whole. In the case of Renaissance theology,\nthe ancient Greek definition becomes entangled with the Old Testament\ndoctrine that human beings were created in the image of God, and the\nlater Christian doctrine that human beings possess exceptional powers\nenabling them to transcend the physical realm. Here, Heidegger quotes\ntwo sixteenth-century claims: Johannes Calvin\u2019s claim that, in virtue of\nsuch faculties as reason, the human may \u2018ascend beyond [earthly life],\neven unto God and eternal felicity,\u2019 and Huldrych Zwingli\u2019s assertion\nthat the human being is \u2018born somewhat closer to God, is something\nmore after his stamp.\u201936 Heidegger argues that these historical influences\nprovide the departure point for early-modern interpretations of\nsubjectivity. Although the modern notion of transcendence seems to\nhave now lost its theological connotations, the assumption that humans\nmay somehow reach beyond their finite incarnation as earthly things\nremains an enduring, if often implicit, theme up to the present day.\nHeidegger thus locates in the prevailing attitude towards knowledge\na self-evident description of the subject as a created thing, or creature.\nThis creature possesses a superior power of reason which distinguishes\nit from other created things and allows it to transcend the finite\nconditions of its material existence. Heidegger argues that the dominant\nfocus has been on the structure of this creature\u2019s essential relation to\nreason, as well as with the transcendent nature of this relation, while\n35 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, pp. 74\u201375 [48\u201349].\n36 Q uoted in Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 74\u201375 [49]. The sources are\nJohannes Calvin\u2019s Institutio I, XV, Section 8, first printed in 1536, and Huldrych\nZwingli\u2019s Von der Klarheit des Wortes Gottes (Deutsche Schriften I, 56), first printed\nin 1522. Heidegger\u2019s biblical reference is to Genesis 1:26. The English translations\nappear in the corresponding endnotes, Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 490,\nnotes vii and ix. 1. SSK, Phenomenology, and the Problem of the External World 39\nthe creature\u2019s existential status as a thing has been taken for granted.37\nHis phenomenological move is to bracket this existential status and so\nsubmit the phenomenal content of the subject to systematic investigation.\nUnderpinning Heidegger\u2019s analysis is a distinction between\nexistence and essence. He argues that the essence of the subject lies in its\nexistence, that existence takes priority over essence.38 He furthermore\nreserves the term \u2018existence\u2019 specifically for subjects, and introduces\nthe term \u2018presence-at-hand\u2019 (Vorhandenheit) to designate the existence\nof everything else. This latter distinction is grounded, in significant\npart, in two naturally occurring grammatical distinctions: first, subjects\nare referred to as \u2018who,\u2019 while everything else is referred to as \u2018what\u2019;\nsecond, only in addressing these subjects does one use a personal\npronoun (\u2018I am,\u2019 \u2018you are,\u2019 \u2018we are,\u2019 etc.).39 The subject is thus a person,\nwhile all other entities are things. Heidegger uses the commonplace\nGerman term \u2018Dasein\u2019 as a general label for the person-subject. He\nemphasises that Dasein is not a thing, substance, or object; it is an\naccumulation of end-directed, or intentional, actions: \u2018The person is no\nThinglike and substantial Being. [\u2026] Essentially the person exists only\nin the performance of intentional acts, and is therefore essentially not an\nobject.\u201940 In undertaking a phenomenological analysis of the existential\nstructure of the subject, Heidegger aims to unsettle the historically\nentrenched tendency to conceptualise it by analogy to things, with the\nunevenness of the analogy being smoothed over by the introduction of\nan incorporeal faculty of reason.\nHeidegger begins his analysis of the subject by exposing one of its\nfundamental existential structures, namely, \u2018being-in-the-world.\u2019 This\nterm refers to a unitary phenomenon which can be analysed in terms\nof three constitutive elements, the most important of which are, for\n37 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 75 [49].\n38 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, pp. 67 [42], 68 [43]. With this, Heidegger inverts\nthe relation between existence and essence introduced by medieval Christian\nmetaphysicians on the basis of the Biblical doctrine of creation. For them, God adds\nexistence to those things whose essence God has determined in advance.\n39 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, pp. 67 [42], 71 [45], 68 [42].\n40 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 73 [47\u201348]. Note also Heidegger\u2019s qualified\nremark that a person becomes present-at-hand only following her death (Heidegger\n(1962a), Being and Time, p. 281 [238]). 40 Science as Social Existence\nthe present discussion, \u2018being-in\u2019 and \u2018world.\u201941 \u2018Being-in\u2019 describes a\nfundamental relation between subject and world. Heidegger urges that\nthis relationship should not be misunderstood as a case of one thing\u2019s\nbeing in another, like, for example, water in a glass. To do so would\nbe to conceive of both subject and world in corporeal terms, as things\nwhich are present-at-hand. Yet, such a misunderstanding is natural,\nwrites Heidegger, especially in such cases where the being-in relation\nis conceived in terms of the subject\u2019s knowledge of the world. Here, the\nsubject is construed as an autonomous, isolated substance, the world\nas an external object, and knowledge thus as a relation between two\nthings, a subject-thing and an object-thing. As a consequence, the\nfundamental relation between subject and world is obscured, because\nsubject and world are not things. It must be emphasised, however, that\nHeidegger does not dismiss the orthodox subject-object distinction as\na false account of the subject\u2019s relation to the world; rather, he points\nout that this account, whatever its merits, is a derivative picture\nresulting from an insufficiently critical analysis of subjectivity. It is, in\nother words, a \u2018founded mode\u2019 of being-in, that is, a mode of being-in\nwhich subsists only through its dependence on a more fundamental\nlevel of being-in-the-world. By obscuring the phenomenal basis of the\nsubject\u2019s relation to the world, the substance ontology underpinning\nthe orthodox subject-object schema recapitulates the very model of\nknowledge which Heidegger aims to bracket and then submit to\nrigorous phenomenological analysis.42\nHeidegger writes that being-in-the-world may be experienced\nin a variety of different ways, for example, as \u2018having to do with\nsomething, producing something, attending to something and looking\nafter it, making use of something, giving something up and letting it\ngo, undertaking, accomplishing, evincing, interrogating, considering,\ndiscussing, determining\u2026\u2019 All of these are experiences of being-in, and\nthey all have, as their basis, \u2018concern,\u2019 a term Heidegger uses to denote\nthe subject\u2019s active involvement with entities in the world, whether those\nentities are persons or things. In contrast to such involvement, Heidegger\nalso considers ways in which the subject\u2019s being-in can manifest a\n41 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 78\u201379 [53]. The third element is Dasein\u2019s\n\u2018average everydayness.\u2019\n42 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, pp. 87 [60], 86 [59]. 1. SSK, Phenomenology, and the Problem of the External World 41\ndeficiency of concern: \u2018[l]eaving undone, neglecting, renouncing, taking\na rest.\u201943 He argues that such deficient modes of concern are constitutive\nof the kind of knowledge which emerges, step-wise, through the\npassive observation of things. First, the subject \u2018holds back\u2019 from its\nactive involvement with entities, and, as a result, is able to encounter\nthem solely in the way that they look. Only through a deficiency of\ninvolvement can the subject just look at something, and nothing more.\nSecond, pure looking then becomes \u2018thematising\u2019; an entity is addressed\nand considered, thereby becoming an object of perception. Third,\nperceiving is a form of interpretation, and hence becomes a \u2018making\ndeterminate.\u2019 Fourth, what has been perceived and made determinate\nmay now be expressed in propositional terms, that is, it may become the\nfixed subject matter for a knowledge claim.44 Heidegger stresses that this\nstep-wise process is a continuous one in which the subject\u2019s experience\nof being-in-the-world goes through successive modifications, from\na basic concernful involvement with entities to a derivative \u2018at arm\u2019s\nlength\u2019 observation and interpretation of entities as the determinate\nsubject matter of propositional statements. Hence, the process should\nnot be misunderstood as one whereby a subject produces internal\nrepresentations which are then somehow brought into agreement\nwith externally present entities. Such a misunderstanding ignores the\nphenomenal content exposed in the existential analytic of the subject,\nand reasserts the orthodox subject-object distinction as ontologically\nfoundational. Indeed, even in those cases where the subject does no\nmore than represent or think about entities, that is, even when it fails to\nphysically engage with them, it is still in the world with those entities,\nit still has being-in as its basic structure. As Heidegger remarks, \u2018the\nperceiving of what is known is not a process of returning with one\u2019s\nbooty to the \u201ccabinet\u201d of consciousness after one has gone out and\ngrasped it.\u201945 There is no \u2018returning\u2019 because there was never a \u2018going\nout\u2019 in the first place.\n43 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 83 [56\u201357].\n44 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, pp. 88\u201389 [61\u201362]. I read step two in conjunction\nwith Heidegger\u2019s later statement that \u2018Thematizing Objectifies\u2019 (Heidegger (1962a),\nBeing and Time, p. 414 [363]).\n45 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 89 [62]. 42 Science as Social Existence\nThe modifications leading from immersed involvement to\npropositionally structured thinking are expressed phenomenologically\nin what Heidegger calls a \u2018change-over\u2019 in the subject\u2019s understanding\nof the world. Because the change-over from involvement to\npropositional thinking is specifically a change in the subject\u2019s mode\nof understanding, it follows that this change presupposes the prior\nexistence of understanding in general. Moreover, Heidegger argues\nthat the new mode of understanding ushered in by such a change-over\nhas the potential to develop itself autonomously, and thereby to take\nover as the dominant attitude governing the subject\u2019s existence.46 Thus,\nfor example, as immersed involvement gives way to propositional\nthinking, the understanding implicit in such thinking, of the world\nas an external object and the subject as a discrete set of internally\norganised representations, may come to dominate the subject\u2019s\nway of understanding both itself and its relation to the world. As a\nconsequence, the subject may mistake this new mode of understanding\nfor a foundational one, thereby accepting that all investigations into\nthe structure of subjectivity will finally be intelligible only against the\nbackdrop of the prevailing subject-object distinction. In this case, the\nsubject\u2019s basic state of being-in-the-world, its involved immersion in\nthat world, falls into obscurity behind the suddenly pressing problem\nof what epistemic properties a substance-subject must possess in order\nto gain access to, and hence knowledge of, a world from which it would\nbe otherwise separated. The irony, of course, is that this critical problem\ntakes for granted a model of the subject which itself derives from a\nmore fundamental mode of subjectivity. Propositional knowledge\nof the world cannot figure into a causal explanation of our immersed\ninvolvement in the world, because propositional knowledge depends\nfor its very possibility on the fact of such involvement.47\n46 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, pp. 200 [158], 161 [123], 90 [62].\n47 N ote that the historians of science Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison deliberately\nadopt the derivative model of subjectivity in their 2010 book, Objectivity: \u2018Because the\nword \u201csubjectivity\u201d is currently used to refer to conscious experience and its forms\nacross cultures and epochs (\u201cRenaissance subjectivity,\u201d \u201cmodern subjectivity\u201d),\nwe should make clear that we use the term historically: it refers to a specific kind\nof self that can first be widely conceptualized and, perhaps, realized within the\nframework of the Kantian and post-Kantian opposition between the objective and\nthe subjective\u2019 (Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison (2010), Objectivity (New York:\nZone Books), p. 199). Given this qualification, there would seem to be no prima facie 1. SSK, Phenomenology, and the Problem of the External World 43\n6. Heidegger\u2019s Response to External-World\nScepticism\nSo far, I have argued that the dispute between external-world realists\nand sociological idealists unfolds against the backdrop of their shared\nacceptance of a bundle of distinctions represented by the glass-bulb\nmodel. These conceptual distinctions lie at the root of an apparently\nintractable philosophical problem, namely, the problem of \u2018epistemic\naccess.\u2019 This problem is variously couched in terms of how the mind\nachieves access to the world, how an epistemic agent breaks through\nappearances and grasps onto reality, and, perhaps most familiarly, how\na subject gains epistemic access to an object. All of these variants take\nfor granted a disjuncture between an inside and an outside, and thus\naddress the question of how this disjuncture might be overcome and\nknowledge thereby achieved. The external-world sceptic may therefore\nbe interpreted as challenging the claim that a subject can gain access to\na world from which it is separated and which exists independently of\nthat subject. As we saw in the last section, Heidegger provides grounds\nfor arguing that the glass-bulb model, implicitly deployed by external-\nworld realists, idealists, and sceptics alike, takes for granted a specific\nmodel of the subject, a model which fails to capture the phenomenal\ncontent of the subject\u2019s basic experience of its own subjectivity. In other\nwords, the model incorporates an unanalysed presupposition that\npropositional thinking is a basic existential state of the subject (Dasein).\nHeidegger responds by arguing that such thinking is a founded mode of\nthe subject\u2019s being-in-the-world, that it is the result of a post hoc change-\nover from the subject\u2019s phenomenologically more original existential\nstate of immersed involvement.\nWhen Heidegger turns specifically to the challenge posed by\nexternal-world scepticism, he applies this same analysis. His argument\nis brief: \u2018[t]he question of whether there is a world at all and whether\nits Being can be proved, makes no sense if it is raised by Dasein as\nconflict between their analysis and the one offered by Heidegger. Hence, I now\nwithdraw my previous criticism of their analysis (see Jeff Kochan (2015b), \u2018Putting\na Spin on Circulating Reference, or How to Rediscover the Scientific Subject,\u2019\nStudies in History and Philosophy of Science 49, 103\u201307 (p. 105 n. 3)). 44 Science as Social Existence\nBeing-in-the-world; and who else would raise it?\u201948 Heidegger observes\nthat the question of epistemic access, of whether or not one can know\nthat the external world exists, can only make sense if one has already\naccepted the conceptual distinctions at play in what I call the glass-bulb\nmodel. His aim here is not to challenge the truth or falsity of assertions\nmade about the existence of the external world; it is, rather, to point out\nthat such judgements can only be made about assertions which have\nalready been recognised as intelligible. Heidegger argues that the realm\nof intelligibility in which the concept of the external world makes sense\nis a derivative one resulting from a change-over in the way the subject\nunderstands itself and its world. That this mode of understanding may\nappear self-evident, that it may have become the prevailing attitude\ngoverning our modern self-understanding, is a consequence of our\nhaving mistaken the glass-bulb model for a fundamental representation\nof our basic existential state. Heidegger does not so much refute the\nexternal-world sceptic as point out the derivative, superficial nature of\nher purportedly fundamental challenge.\nJust as he had earlier argued that propositional thinking is a founded\nmode of the subject\u2019s being-in, Heidegger now argues that such\nthinking is also \u2018a founded mode of access to the Real,\u2019 and, furthermore,\nthat it is only through this derivative mode of understanding that an\nanalysis of reality becomes possible. The idea seems to be that only once\nour understanding has changed over to a propositionally structured\nthinking does it become possible for us to interpret the world as \u2018Reality,\u2019\nwhich for Heidegger also means \u2018substantiality.\u2019 Two steps are involved\nin this process. First, with the change-over in its mode of understanding,\nthe subject begins to encounter the real in a new way, that is, in terms of\n\u2018beholding\u2019 (das anschauende Erkennen, \u2018visual cognition\u2019).49 Second, as\nthis beholding, this pure looking which holds back from involvement,\ncomes to dominate the subject\u2019s way of relating to entities in the world,\nit begins to take over as the subject\u2019s prevailing mode of understanding\nthat world. It is under these circumstances, argues Heidegger, that we\nbegin to interpret the world, as a whole, in terms of substantiality, as\nreality. We see here the emergence, once again, of those derivative\nphenomena represented in the glass-bulb model. The subject\u2019s holding\n48 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, pp. 246\u201347 [202].\n49 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, pp. 245\u201346 [201\u201302]. 1. SSK, Phenomenology, and the Problem of the External World 45\nback from immersed involvement in the world, so as to then step back\nand visually examine its surroundings, leads to a perceived separation\nbetween subject and world. Mistaking this separation for a fundamental\nstructure in its basic relation to the world, the subject then faces the\nvexing question of how it may overcome this separation, of how we\nmay, in general, achieve access to a world which we now understand to\nlie beyond our reach. Heidegger therefore takes the problem of reality,\nprecisely because it is the problem of whether or not an external world\nexists, to rise out of our failure to recognise being-in-the-world as a\ncentral aspect of our fundamental existential state. He writes:\nThe \u2018problem of Reality\u2019 in the sense of the question whether an external\nworld is present-at-hand and whether such a world can be proved,\nturns out to be an impossible one, not because its consequences lead to\ninextricable impasses, but because the very entity which serves as its\ntheme, is one which, as it were, repudiates any such formulation of the\nquestion.50\nThe subject\u2019s failure to understand its fundamental relation to the world\nas one of being-in means that it also fails to understand the basic structure\nof the world itself. As it is led astray by the conceptual distinctions\nrepresented by the glass-bulb model, the subject begins to see the world\nas a thing standing outside of itself, and this world-thing subsequently\ngets buried in an epistemological problematic which first puts the\nworld\u2019s existence into question and then demands that its existence\nbe proved. Heidegger reckons that this epistemological problematic,\nthe \u2018problem of Reality,\u2019 lies at the heart of the protracted dispute\nbetween realists and idealists, and he criticises both sides for having\nmistaken their derivative understanding of world for an ontologically\nfoundational one. Both sides fall short, Heidegger claims, because\nneither has brought sufficiently to light the basic phenomenal content\nof the subject. Both have, in other words, given too much attention to\nepistemology and not enough to phenomenological ontology.\nHeidegger provides clear grounds for distinguishing his own position\nfrom both realism and idealism, as he understands them.51 With respect\nto realism, he fully agrees with the realist\u2019s claim that there is a world in\n50 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 250 [206].\n51 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, pp. 250\u201352 [206\u201308]. 46 Science as Social Existence\nwhich things exist, in the sense of being present-at-hand. However, he\nargues that realism goes too far when it interprets the world itself as a\npresent-at-hand thing, that is, in terms of a reality existing independently\nof the subject. On the basis of this misinterpretation, Heidegger\nfurthermore argues, the realist makes the additional problematic claim\nthat a proof of the existence of the world is both necessary and possible.\nHeidegger does not follow the realist down this road because for him\nthe world is not a present-at-hand thing separate from the subject. As\nregards idealism, Heidegger is in full agreement with the idealist\u2019s\nclaim that reality cannot be understood on the model of the present-at-\nhand thing, noting that, with this insight, idealism has an advantage in\nprinciple over realism. Where idealism goes astray, Heidegger claims,\nis when it makes the psychologistic supposition that reality must reside\n\u2018in the consciousness\u2019 of a subject. Heidegger observes that, so long as\nthis claim leaves unexamined the phenomenal content of consciousness\nitself, it will fail to advance a properly articulated concept of reality.\nPlaced against the backdrop of the orthodox subject-object distinction,\nHeidegger\u2019s analysis of the errors of realism and idealism would seem\nto be as follows. The realist errs in construing the world as an object\ndistinct from a subject, and then also in employing the term \u2018reality\u2019 to\ndenote the \u2018objecthood\u2019 of a subjectless world. In contrast, the idealist\nerrs in ignoring the phenomenal content of the subject, satisfying herself\nwith the largely privative claim that the subject is not an object. She\nthen assimilates reality to this ill-defined subjectivity, and, in the worst\ncase, declares it a manifestation of the interior structures of a worldless\nsubject. According to Heidegger, then, realism and idealism both come\nup short because neither has recognised being-in-the-world as one of\nthe subject\u2019s fundamental ontological structures.\nIn this chapter, one of my chief aims has been to elucidate\nHeidegger\u2019s response to the external-world sceptic. However, it also\nseems appropriate, in the present context, to very briefly highlight\nanother crucial aspect of Heidegger\u2019s proposed alternative to the bundle\nof concepts employed by the external-world realist and idealist alike,\nand so also exploited by the sceptic. A more extended discussion will\nfollow in Chapter Two. The crucial aspect in question is Heidegger\u2019s\ndistinction between reality and the real. Recall Heidegger\u2019s claim that\npropositional thinking is a founded mode of access to the real, and that\nit is only through this derivative mode of understanding that the reality 1. SSK, Phenomenology, and the Problem of the External World 47\nof the real may be grasped as an object of analysis. This suggests that the\nreal may be encountered in a more fundamental way, one which does\nnot entail an accompanying concept of reality. Heidegger\u2019s idea seems to\nbe that, when the real is interpreted in terms of reality, it is encountered\nas an object, with reality signifying its objecthood. The reality of the\nreal is thus the objecthood of the object. Yet, as we have seen, for\nHeidegger entities are encountered as objects only following a change-\nover in the subject\u2019s being-in-the-world from immersed involvement\nto the detached thematisation and determination characteristic of\npropositional thinking. Heidegger argues that the being of entities, what\nthey are, depends on the way in which they are understood by the subject,\nbut that the existence of those entities, the brute fact that they are, is not\ndependent on the subject\u2019s understanding. He furthermore asserts the\nmore specific proposition that, while reality depends on the subject\u2019s\nunderstanding of being, the real does not.52 In this way, Heidegger\nprepares the conceptual ground on which to assert that the real exists\nindependently of the subject\u2019s understanding. Indeed, for Heidegger,\nthe term \u2018the real\u2019 appears to signify independently existing entities. In\nChapter Two, I will suggest that this feature of Heidegger\u2019s analysis\nprovides the basis for a minimal form of realism which both escapes\nHeidegger\u2019s critique of external-world realism, as explicated above,\nand proves amenable to SSK\u2019s own minimal realist commitments. In\nthe meantime, let us consider how Heidegger\u2019s response to the external-\nworld sceptic might bear on the responses made to the sceptic by the\nSSK practitioners surveyed earlier in this chapter.\n7. A Heideggerian Critique of SSK\u2019s Response to\nExternal-World Scepticism\nThe principal response of SSK to the external-world sceptic is to eschew\nthe requirement that a belief in the existence of the external world must\nbe absolutely justified. SSK practitioners accept the sceptical argument\nthat absolute knowledge is impossible, but reject the more radical\nconclusion that knowledge, as such, is impossible. Instead, they endorse\na mitigated form of scepticism which allows room for a non-absolutist,\nor relativistic, conception of knowledge.\n52 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 255 [212]. 48 Science as Social Existence\nIt should be clear that, from the standpoint of Heidegger\u2019s own\nresponse to the external-world sceptic, the distinction SSK practitioners\ndraw between absolute and relative knowledge is somewhat beside\nthe point. Both absolutist and relativist approaches remain firmly\nrooted in an epistemological problematic which takes for granted the\nintelligibility of the sceptical challenge; they differ only in the strategies\nthey deploy when addressing that challenge. Heidegger argues that the\nintelligibility of external-world scepticism entails the prior acceptance\nof a set of conceptual distinctions which I have represented with the\nglass-bulb model. As argued earlier, SSK practitioners take this model\nfor granted even while they reject an absolutist notion of knowledge. As\na consequence, they accept as foundational what is, in fact, a derivative\nconceptualisation of the subject\u2019s relation to the world, one which does\nnot sufficiently recognise that one of the subject\u2019s basic existential states\nis being-in-the-world. Only following a change-over in understanding,\nin which the subject retreats from its original immersed involvement in\nthe world, does it begin to view its access to the things around it as an\nepistemological problem, that is, a problem of whether or not, as well as\nhow, one may come to know such things in their reality.\nThe dispute between Barnes, Bloor, and Henry, who assert the\nexistence of the external world, and Collins, who rejects the existence\nof such a world, can be re-examined in this light. Because they each\neither affirm or deny the possibility of knowledge of the external\nworld, both sides reveal their shared acceptance of the intelligibility\nof such a possibility, and thus their tacit reliance on the glass-bulb\nmodel. The ensuing debate, though it has produced insights of genuine\nepistemological interest, remains ontologically adrift insofar as both\nsides have failed to expose and clarify the basic phenomenological\nexperience of the subject as such. Collins\u2019s idealism may have an\nadvantage over the realism of Barnes, Bloor, and Henry, since it\nacknowledges that there is no sense in speaking of the world as a\nthing existing independently of the subject\u2019s understanding. However,\nbecause Collins leaves the ontological structure of this understanding\nunexamined, he is unable to articulate a sufficiently clear account of the\nrelation between subject and world. As a consequence, he has chosen\ninstead to develop a method in which the world, as well as the things\nin it, are simply left out of the picture. In contrast, Barnes, Bloor, and 1. SSK, Phenomenology, and the Problem of the External World 49\nHenry preserve the important insight that things exist independently\nof the subject\u2019s way of understanding them, but they then abrogate this\ninsight by interpreting the world itself as an object, a present-at-hand\nthing, which exists independently of the subject. They must then face\nthe intractable problem of how to justify the claim that the subject can,\nin fact, know that this world, as well as the things within it, actually\nexists.\nI have already argued that the justifications they have offered are\ninsufficient. They assert that a belief in the existence of the external\nworld is a presupposition which must necessarily precede any action\ntaken within that world. Yet such arguments only serve to underwrite\na realist mode of discourse rather than to establish the existence of the\nexternal world. Moreover, as Heidegger points out, when one asserts\nthe need for such a presupposition, one tacitly affirms the derivative\nnotion of the subject as worldless. After all, if one had already recognised\nbeing-in-the-world as belonging the subject\u2019s basic existential state,\nthen one would not feel obliged to presuppose the existence of the\nexternal world.53 The same goes for Bloor\u2019s strategy of epistemological\ncomplacency. This strategy takes for granted the epistemological\nproblematic and responds to it by recommending complacency.\nSuch a strategy makes sense only if one has already agreed with the\nexternal-world sceptic that subject and world are separated, and that\nthe subject can only achieve knowledge of, or gain epistemic access to,\nthis world by overcoming that separation. Bloor expresses his belief\nthat such knowledge is possible, but responds with complacency to\nthe sceptic\u2019s demand for a justification of that belief. Heidegger argues\nthat such a strategy, because it fails to render transparent the subject\u2019s\nbasic ontological structure, treats the subject as a wordless thing which\nmust first assure itself, somehow, of a world. As such, the strategy\nis itself an expression of a founded mode of understanding, a mode\nin which the glass-bulb model is taken for granted, and hence one in\nwhich a derivative mode of understanding is mistaken for one in which\nthe fundamental ontological relation between subject and world is\noriginally revealed.54\n53 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 249 [205\u201306].\n54 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 250 [206]. 50 Science as Social Existence\n8. Conclusion\nThis chapter has been concerned with the threat posed to SSK by external-\nworld scepticism. Although SSK practitioners have made effective use\nof sceptical techniques in their analyses of scientific knowledge, their\nmethods are best seen, not as sceptical, but as advocating a mitigated\nresponse to the radical sceptical claim that knowledge of the external\nworld is impossible. With the exception of Collins, SSK practitioners\nhave attempted to advance a minimal realist position which asserts the\nexistence of an external world without also feeling obliged to meet the\nsceptic\u2019s demand that such an assertion be absolutely justified. I have\nargued that they have not been successful. The key obstacle preventing\nSSK practitioners from developing a defensible realist position is their\npreoccupation with epistemological, at the expense of ontological,\nissues. Indeed, despite the long dispute between the realist and idealist\nwings of SSK, both sides have failed to adequately address the way\nin which their taken-for-granted ontological commitments inform the\ncontent of their epistemological arguments. I have used Heidegger\u2019s\nphenomenological analysis of the subjectivity of the subject to expose\nthe nature of those commitments.\nA phenomenological analysis of the subject\u2019s basic state of being-in-\nthe-world reveals that external-world scepticism makes no sense as a\nfundamental challenge to the subject-world relation. External-world\nscepticism depends for its dialectical force on a derivative understanding\nof that relation, a conceptualisation of it in terms of a distinction between\nsubject and object. The weakness at the heart of SSK\u2019s responses to the\nexternal-world sceptic is its tacit adherence to the metaphysical image of\nthe subject which underpins the orthodox subject-object schema.55 It is\nonly within the epistemological problematic generated by this schema\nthat external-world scepticism becomes intelligible and so comes to\nthreaten the realist ambitions of SSK. If SSK practitioners wish to avoid\nthe debilitating challenge posed to their work by the external-world\nsceptic, then I recommend that they divest themselves of their residual\ncommitment to orthodox ontology and adopt the position advanced\n55 I n Chapter Three, I will give detailed attention to the way Bloor attempts to\ntransform, without wholly rejecting, the Kantian version of the orthodox subject-\nobject distinction. 1. SSK, Phenomenology, and the Problem of the External World 51\nby Heidegger. Yet, this recommendation comes with a worry. If SSK\nwere to adopt a Heideggerian ontology, which is openly critical of both\nrealism and idealism, would it not lose the grounds for its realism?\nIn this chapter, I have already suggested that Heidegger, despite his\nabnegation of realism, nevertheless provides the basis for a minimal\nrealist doctrine which both escapes his own criticism and is compatible\nwith the main tenets of SSK\u2019s realist commitments. It lies with Chapter\nTwo to make good this claim.  Chapter Two\nA Minimal Realism for\nScience Studies\n1. Introduction\nOne of the most ridiculed concepts in Heidegger\u2019s work is his \u2018question\nof being.\u2019 An unlikely collection of critics, ranging from the philosopher\nSimon Blackburn to the science studies scholar Bruno Latour have\nexercised considerable rhetorical flair in roundly repudiating the\nsignificance of this question. Blackburn pokes fun at those who \u2018flutter\naround the flame of Being.\u2019 Latour lampoons Heidegger\u2019s \u2018epigones\n[who] do not expect to find Being except along the Black Forest\nHolzwege,\u2019 and he burlesques their alleged claim that \u2018[w]e are keeping\nthe little flame of Being safe from everything, and you, who have all\nthe rest, have nothing.\u20191 For the incorrigibly counter-suggestive, like me,\nsuch enthusiastic denunciations from on high encourage the thought\nthat Heidegger\u2019s question of being may warrant close attention after all.\nIndeed, as I hope to demonstrate in this chapter, Heidegger\u2019s question\nyields resources for a minimal realism compatible with the social\nconstructivism of science studies.\n1 Simon Blackburn (2004), \u2018Lights! Camera! Being!\u2019 New Republic (February 23); Bruno\nLatour (1993), We Have Never Been Modern (Harvard: Harvard University Press),\npp. 65, 66. I discuss Latour\u2019s criticism in Jeff Kochan (2010b), \u2018Latour\u2019s Heidegger,\u2019\nSocial Studies of Science 40(4), 579\u201398 (pp. 587\u201388).\n\u00a9 Jeff Kochan, CC BY 4.0 http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0129.02 54 Science as Social Existence\nHeidegger\u2019s question of being can be more fully described as the\nquestion of the meaning of being. The words \u2018meaning\u2019 and \u2018being\u2019\nmay raise expectations that the question will lead us into deep and\nmysterious philosophical waters, but, in fact, we may profitably\naddress it on the most superficial and mundane of levels. The word\n\u2018being\u2019 translates the German infinitive sein, which can be more strictly\nrendered as \u2018to be.\u2019 Hence the German sentence \u2018Alle wollen gl\u00fccklich\nsein\u2019 means \u2018Everybody wants to be happy.\u2019 Note that, unlike the other\nterms in this sentence, the verb \u2018to be\u2019 does not refer to anything. Its role\nis rather to bind together and give an overall meaning to the sentence.\nThe word \u2018being\u2019 should, therefore, not be mistaken for the name of an\nentity, or thing. As Heidegger writes, \u2018[t]he Being of entities \u201cis\u201d not\nitself an entity.\u20192 If \u2018being\u2019 names anything at all, then it names the way\nin which things gather together and so acquire meaning. According to\nHeidegger, this is an ontological event with a temporal structure. The\nquestion of the meaning of being thus motivates an enquiry into the\nway meaning takes place as this temporal event. Heidegger\u2019s question\nis not \u2018What meaning does \u201cbeing\u201d have?\u2019 Meaning is not a thing being\npossesses. The question is rather \u2018How does \u201cbeing\u201d mean?\u2019 Meaning\nis an event, something being does. Grammatically, the phrase \u2018the\nmeaning of being\u2019 is similar in structure to the phrase \u2018the thrill of a\nlifetime.\u2019 The thrill is not the property of a lifetime, because a lifetime\nis not a thing with properties. A lifetime is a historical-existential space\nwherein thrills can happen. Likewise, being is a historical-existential\nspace wherein meaning can happen.\nHeidegger observes that, because the word \u2018being\u2019 and its cognates\nplay such a ubiquitous role in our language, we tend simply to take\nthem for granted, without giving them a second thought. Yet, he\nargues, useful insights may be won by turning \u2018being\u2019 from a taken-for-\ngranted resource into a topic for investigation. One such insight will be\nespecially crucial for this chapter: the polysemy of \u2018being.\u2019 The word\n\u2018being\u2019 carries connotations of both existence and essence. By attaching\nthe name of a thing to the verb \u2018to be,\u2019 one may then say of the thing that\nit is, or what it is, or both. As will be discussed later, Heidegger marks\n2 Martin Heidegger (1962a [1927]), Being and Time, trans. by John Macquarrie and\nEdward Robinson (Oxford: Blackwell), p. 26 [6]. (Following scholarly convention,\npage numbers in square brackets refer to the original 1927 German edition of Being\nand Time.) 2. A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 55\nthis as a distinction between the \u2018that-being\u2019 and the \u2018what-being\u2019 of\na thing, a move which furthermore distinguishes between the thing\u2019s\nexistence and its essence. We have already encountered this lattermost\ndistinction in Chapter One.\nThe distinction between existence and essence, between the that-\nbeing and the what-being of a thing, is an ancient one, and it also\nfeatures prominently in several of Heidegger\u2019s works. Nevertheless,\nthe distinction has been largely overlooked by those writers concerned\nwith explicating Heidegger\u2019s views on science and realism. One such\nwriter, Joseph Rouse, stands out as being both a highly regarded\nexpositor of Heidegger\u2019s philosophy of science, on the one hand, and\na key contributor to theoretical debates in science studies, on the other.\nThe latter half of this chapter will give focussed attention to his work\non both counts. Two other writers, while not having bridged between\nHeidegger and science studies to the same degree as Rouse, also bear\nmentioning: Trish Glazebrook and Dimitri Ginev.3 Like Rouse, neither\nGlazebrook nor Ginev have recognised the important role played by\nHeidegger\u2019s distinction between existence and essence. Glazebrook\nhas come the closest, correctly observing that Heidegger was vexed\nby the problem of how a worldly thing may be acknowledged to\nexist independently of the subject when its intelligibility nevertheless\ndepends on that subject. As we will see, Heidegger uses the distinction\nbetween existence and essence to solve this problem, recognising the\nindependent existence of a thing while maintaining the necessary\ndependence of its essence, construed broadly to include its core meaning\nor basic intelligibility, on the subjectivity of the subject. Glazebrook, in\ncontrast, argues that Heidegger solves this problem by differentiating\nbetween a thing and its being, what is conventionally called the\n\u2018ontological difference.\u20194 But this cuts the knot in the wrong place. The\ndistinction between independent existence and dependent essence is a\n3 T here is an extensive literature more generally addressing the topic of Heidegger\non realism and science. However, a discussion of it would carry us too far beyond\nthe narrow scope, and specific goals, of the present chapter. Curious readers may\nconsult the Appendix at the end of this chapter (p. 106).\n4 T rish Glazebrook (2012b), \u2018Why Read Heidegger on Science?,\u2019 in Heidegger on Science,\ned. by Trish Glazebrook (Albany: SUNY Press), pp. 13\u201326 (p. 20); Trish Glazebrook\n(2001a), \u2018Heidegger and Scientific Realism,\u2019 Continental Philosophy Review 34(4), 361-\n401 (p. 368). The ontological difference is the difference, mentioned earlier, between\nbeing and entities. 56 Science as Social Existence\ndistinction in the being of a thing, not between a thing and its being:\n\u2018it is precisely the two of them that make up the structure of being.\u20195\nAs will be explained below, this distinction stems from the difference\nbetween a thing\u2019s existing but meaning nothing, and its existing and\nmeaning something. By picking up the wrong distinction, Glazebrook\nis forced to grapple with a range of deep paradoxes, and it is not clear to\nme that she succeeds in resolving them. For example, on the one hand,\nshe argues that \u2018for Heidegger, it is an incoherent demand to make of\nrealists that they hold the independence thesis.\u2019 On the other, she also\nargues that Heidegger was a \u2018robust scientific realist.\u20196 As I will argue,\nthe independence thesis is the basic doctrine of realism, including\nscientific realism, and Heidegger was a realist just because he accepted\nthis doctrine. He was, however, not a scientific realist; he was what I call\na \u2018minimal realist.\u2019 Glazebrook\u2019s account of Heidegger\u2019s realism is an\nundoubtedly complex and difficult one. I commend my own account as\na simpler, more modest, and more useful alternative.\nThis chapter begins with an explication of Heidegger\u2019s early existential\nconception of science. Heidegger introduced this conception as an\nalternative to the dominant logical conception, which views science as a\nconceptual system. He thus draws attention to the concrete, existential\nstructures of scientific practice which are necessary for more abstract,\ntheoretical reflection. Theory needs method, and method is concretely\nenacted in the world. Although Glazebrook is aware of this aspect of\nHeidegger\u2019s account of science, she nevertheless repeatedly attributes\nto him the view that science is a \u2018conceptual scheme.\u20197 She shares this\ntendency with both Rouse and Ginev, but whereas Glazebrook attributes\nthe position without criticism, the other two treat it as evidence for\nHeidegger\u2019s failure to have fully embraced scientific practice, and hence\nto have entirely freed himself from the orthodox trappings of a theory-\ndominant view of science.8 Ginev credits Rouse with this criticism,\n5 M artin Heidegger (1982a [1975]), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, trans. by Albert\nHofstadter (Bloomington: Indiana University Press), p. 78.\n6 G lazebrook (2001a), \u2018Heidegger and Scientific Realism,\u2019 pp. 386, 361.\n7 G lazebrook (2012b), \u2018Why Read Heidegger on Science?,\u2019 pp. 20, 21; Glazebrook\n(2001a) \u2018Heidegger and Scientific Realism,\u2019 pp. 377, 381, 382, 389.\n8 Dimitri Ginev (2005), \u2018Against the Politics of Postmodern Philosophy of Science,\u2019\nInternational Studies in the Philosophy of Science 19(2), 191\u2013208 (p. 199); Dimitri Ginev\n(2011), The Tenets of Cognitive Existentialism (Athens OH: Ohio University Press) pp. 2. A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 57\nwhich is based on the claim that the \u2018mathematical projection of nature,\u2019\nwhich Heidegger located at the heart of modern science, is an inherently\ntheoretical phenomenon. I will argue, to the contrary, that Heidegger\nintroduced the mathematical projection as an existential phenomenon\nwhich serves as a condition of possibility for both theory and practice\nin the sciences.9 Once again, Glazebrook comes the closest to my own\nview when she writes that Heidegger\u2019s strategy \u2018is not to establish a\nsecure bridge between praxical involvement and theoretical analysis,\nbut rather to trace both back to being-in-the-world.\u2019 This strikes me as\nlargely correct.10 Although scientific theory is necessarily enabled by\npractice, Heidegger resisted the urge to explain it reductively in terms\nexclusively of practice. This challenges the widespread view in science\nstudies that theory can be unproblematically reduced to practice. By\nsimply collapsing one side of the theory-practice divide into the other,\nthe basic motivations which originally gave rise to and justified that\ndivide are left hopelessly obscure. I will not, in this chapter, make\nany satisfying attempt to clear up this obscurity. Such an attempt will\ncome later in Chapter Five, when we consider the relation between\nmathematical and empirical modes of scientific existence. Meanwhile,\nin this chapter, by at least drawing attention to this obscurity, I hope to\nbegin undermining the unreflective business-as-usual attitude of many\ncontemporary practice theorists towards the theory-practice divide.\nUnder the flag of a \u2018practical hermeneutics of science,\u2019 Rouse has\nbeen most enthusiastic about clearing the deck of theory and raising\nin its place an account of science based solely on the notion of practice.\nIn the process, he has not only criticised the early Heidegger for\nallegedly retreating back into a theory-dominant account of science,\nbut proponents of the sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK) as\nwell. In the former case, Rouse\u2019s misconstrual of Heidegger\u2019s concept\n5, 103; Joseph Rouse (1987a), Knowledge and Power: Toward a Political Philosophy of\nScience (Ithaca: Cornell University Press), p. 103.\n9 I also makes this argument, with slightly more detail, in Jeff Kochan (2015a),\n\u2018Scientific Practice and Modes of Epistemic Existence,\u2019 in Debating Cognitive\nExistentialism, ed. by Dimitri Ginev (Leiden: Brill Rodopi), pp. 95\u2013106.\n10 Glazebrook (2001a), \u2018Heidegger and Scientific Realism,\u2019 p. 386. Unfortunately,\nGlazebrook seems to immediately lose grip on this insight when, on the same page,\nshe concludes that \u2018the difference between theory and practice [is] the difference\nbetween two kinds of practice.\u2019 She credits Rouse, in part, for having influenced her\non this point. 58 Science as Social Existence\nof mathematical projection, as referring to a theoretical rather than\nan existential phenomenon, leads him to exaggerate the extent to\nwhich Heidegger asserted the independence of theory from practice.\nTransfixed as he is by the theory-practice divide, Rouse fails to realise\nthat a refusal to collapse theory into practice does not necessarily evince\na counter-desire to collapse practice into theory. In the latter case, Rouse\nalso exaggerates the commitment of SSK to a theory-dominant account\nof science, but he makes a good point that SSK remains debilitated\nby a vestigial commitment to a problematic theory of knowledge. I\nexamined this vestigial commitment in Chapter One, suggesting there\nthat SSK could overcome this epistemological problematic by adopting\nkey aspects of Heidegger\u2019s existential phenomenology. In this chapter,\nI apply a similar strategy in order to defend SSK against Rouse\u2019s\ncriticisms. On this basis, I conclude that Rouse\u2019s attempt to undermine\nSSK is not successful.\nThe gist of my argument is that Rouse\u2019s practice-based account of\nscience poses no threat to the minimal realism which I draw out of\nHeidegger\u2019s work and recommend for science studies. Indeed, Rouse\u2019s\nattempts to close the door on realism appear unsuccessful even in the\ncase of his own practical hermeneutics of science. As I will demonstrate,\ndespite his theoretical attempts to keep the realist\u2019s basic independence\nthesis at bay, a close look at the way Rouse concretely articulates\nthat theory reveals his own informal and unreflective commitment\nto that very thesis. The incoherent relationship between Rouse\u2019s\ntheory and practice springs from his failure to recognize Heidegger\u2019s\ndistinction between existence and essence. I suggest, then, that the\npractical hermeneutics commended by Rouse is best replaced with an\nexistential phenomenology of science, because the latter is better able to\naccommodate the basic realist doctrine of independent existence.\nMinimal realism is thus not a repudiation of practice and a flight\nback into theory. It is instead a recognition that theory and practice\nare phenomenologically distinct ways of actualising the range of\npossibilities opened up by the form of existence Heidegger dubbed the\n\u2018mathematical projection of nature.\u2019 Ginev criticises Rouse for not paying\nadequate attention to the existential basis, and especially the existential\nspecificity, of science, and he deplores Rouse\u2019s consequent tendency 2. A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 59\nto uncritically assimilate science into the broader cultural sphere in\nwhich it is embedded. According to Ginev, one can abandon a theory-\ndominant account of science while still viewing science as a unique and\nspecifiable form of existence, one distinct from other forms of cultural\nexistence.11 As far as the minimal realist is concerned, this suggests\nthat science may get at the real, at independently existing things, in\nways characteristically distinct from the other forms of existence also\nenabled by our history and culture. This is an important point, which\nultimately leads to political questions about the relationship between\nscience and the broader social sphere. I will briefly comment on this\nin the concluding section of this chapter, and again in Chapter Seven\nof this book. For the time being, let us focus on the issue of realism\nand science, beginning with a discussion of Heidegger\u2019s existential\nconception of science, then exploring the significance of this conception\nfor SSK, and finally defending the resultant account of minimal realism\nfrom the challenge posed to it by Rouse\u2019s practical hermeneutics of\nscientific practice.\n2. Heidegger\u2019s Existential Conception of Science\nIn his 1927 book, Being and Time, Heidegger distinguishes between a\n\u2018logical\u2019 and an \u2018existential\u2019 conception of science.12 The logical account\nunderstands science according to the representation of nature it produces,\nand the validity of this representation is itself defined as having been\nestablished on the basis of a coherent body of interconnected true\npropositions. On this account, then, science is taken to be a conceptual\nscheme. On the existential account, in contrast, science is understood\nto be a mode of existence, a way of being-in-the-world, which brings to\nlight things for theoretical understanding. It is important to emphasise\nthat these two conceptions of science are not opposed to one another.\nHeidegger commits himself to an existential conception of science, but\nhe does not, in doing so, reject the logical conception as wrong or absurd.\nOn the contrary, the existential account is meant to explain how the\n11 Ginev (2005), \u2018Against the Politics of Postmodern Philosophy of Science,\u2019 p. 103.\n12 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 408 [357]. 60 Science as Social Existence\nlogical account is possible; it seeks to reveal the existential conditions\nnecessary for the emergence of the theoretical attitude presupposed in\nthe logical account. By undertaking a phenomenological investigation\ninto the mode of existence which makes science possible, Heidegger\nshifts attention from science construed as a body of concepts and formal\nlogical rules to science construed as an ongoing, goal-oriented human\nactivity. In other words, he focuses on what scientists do, and also on\nthe way they must experience and understand their relation to the\nworld in order to do what they do.\nBy emphasising the actions of scientists, Heidegger would seem to\nadopt an approach similar to the one generally prevailing in science\nstudies. Bloor, Barnes, and Henry, for example, write that \u2018[f]or the\nscientist the world is the object of study; for the sociologist it is the scientist-\nstudying-the-world that is the object.\u201913 Yet Heidegger also stresses that\nhe is primarily concerned neither with the historical development of\nscience, nor with the particular goal-directed activities of scientists\nworking in specific contexts. Hence, Heidegger\u2019s existential conception\nof science cannot be straightforwardly assimilated to the view of science\nfavoured by SSK practitioners. Indeed, one crucial difference is that\nHeidegger, unlike Barnes, Bloor, and Henry, does not conceptualise\nthe scientist-studying-the-world as an object. The reasons for this have\nalready been covered in Chapter One. Rejecting a view dating back as\nfar as Aristotle, Heidegger argues that the subject (Dasein), including\nthe scientific subject, should not be conceptualised in fundamental\nterms as a thing, substance, or object. The subject is, rather, existence.\nBy undertaking a phenomenological analysis of the basic existential\nstructures of the subjectivity of the subject, Heidegger attempts to\ncounteract the traditional metaphysical tendency to construe persons\nas special instances of a more general ontological category of \u2018thing.\u2019 In\nreserving the term \u2018existence\u2019 exclusively for the subject, and in order\nto guard against the subject\u2019s being conflated with a thing, Heidegger\nrefers to the existence of things as \u2018presence-at-hand\u2019 (Vorhandenheit).\nHis existential conception of science thus focuses on the activities of\nscientists, rather than on bodies of scientific knowledge, because such\nactivities provide a necessary basis for scientific subjectivity, for the\n13 Barry Barnes, David Bloor and John Henry (1996), Scientific Knowledge: A Sociological\nAnalysis (London: Athlone), p. 30. 2. A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 61\nparticular mode of existence within which scientific knowledge is\nproduced and sustained.\nHeidegger calls the ground state of the subject\u2019s elemental being-in-\nthe-world \u2018circumspective concern.\u2019 This is what, in Chapter One, was\nreferred to as immersed involvement. Determining the conditions of\npossibility for the theoretical attitude involves analysing the existential\nconditions under which theoretical thinking emerges from a basic\neveryday state of immersed involvement in a world. As discussed in\nChapter One, Heidegger analyses this emergence in terms of four steps,\nwhich lead from immersed involvement to propositionally structured\nthinking. First, one holds back from immersed involvement so as to\nmerely look at things, and no more. Second, pure looking becomes a\nthematising in which things are encountered as objects of perception.\nThird, perception interprets things so as to determine their properties.\nFourth, determinate objects become the subject matter for propositional\nknowledge claims. Heidegger calls this transformation in the way\nthings in the world are experienced a \u2018change-over\u2019 in the subject\u2019s\nmode of understanding. The phenomenological analysis of this change-\nover plays a central role in Heidegger\u2019s existential conception of science,\nand thus merits detailed examination.\nHeidegger presents the change-over as a transition from an\nexperience of things as \u2018ready-to-hand\u2019 to an experience of them as\n\u2018present-at-hand.\u2019 Things that are, in this context, present-at-hand are\nthose encountered once one holds back from involvement with a thing\nand begins to interpret it as an object with determinable properties.\nIn this context, then, a present-at-hand thing is called an \u2018object.\u2019 In\ncontrast, things which are ready-to-hand are called \u2018equipment,\u2019 that is,\nthings encountered in a basic existential state of immersed involvement\nin a world. On this account, the world in which one is always already\nimmersed and involved is a world of equipment, what Heidegger also\ncalls a \u2018work-world.\u201914 He observes that, when we are absorbed in this\nwork-world, our attention is not focussed on the equipment we use;\nrather, it is focussed primarily on the work.15 For example, when one\nsigns one\u2019s name, one does not focus on the pen in one\u2019s hand or the\npaper on which one signs, but on the act of signing. Similarly, when\n14 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 101 [71].\n15 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 99 [69]. 62 Science as Social Existence\na cyclist rides along a busy street, her attention is focussed not on her\nbicycle but on the task of cycling. Both pen and bicycle are, in these cases,\nexperienced as things ready-to-hand, as equipment the significance of\nwhich lies in the task towards which it is, at that moment, being put.\nPieces of equipment are put to use in an activity, but the activity is not\nabout them. They are not the theme of the activity, much less its object.\nThey are not, in other words, the topic of the activity, but a resource\nenabling that activity.\nIn clarifying how the change-over in understanding gets going,\nHeidegger must explain how a basic state of everyday immersed\ninvolvement could come to be disturbed or interrupted. He must, in\nother words, give some account of how one comes to leave behind this\nbasic state, how one comes to hold back from involvement and begins\nto instead experience a thing as the theme of one\u2019s activity, and so as\nits object. This problem can be usefully contrasted with the problem\nof the external world, discussed in Chapter One. There the difficulty\nwas to explain how a subject may gain access to a world from which\nit remains fundamentally separated. The solution demands an account\nof how the subject breaks free from the finite limits of its own internal\nstate by building an epistemic bridge over to the external world which,\nin turn, exists in fundamental ontological separation from that subject.\nTraditionally, it is said to do this through the exercise of a transcendent\nreason. In the case of Heidegger\u2019s existential phenomenology, in\ncontrast, the question of how the subject gains access to the external\nworld never arises, because subject and world were never separated\nin the first place. In the former case, the problem is to explain how a\nbasic deficiency in the subject\u2019s relation to the world may be overcome\nthrough the transcendent power of reason. In the latter case, the problem\nis to explain how one\u2019s basic existential absorption in a work-world may\nsuddenly become deficient, how one might abruptly withdraw from\nthe everyday work-world in which one is normally immersed. Only\nthrough this sudden deficiency in one\u2019s workaday relation to things can\nthe change-over get going.\nHeidegger addresses this problem by considering what happens\nwhen a \u2018breakdown\u2019 occurs in the smooth functioning of the subject\u2019s\nworkaday world, when the circumspective concern characteristic of\none\u2019s most immediate involvement with equipment becomes disturbed 2. A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 63\nor interrupted. As a result of such an equipmental breakdown,\n\u2018[t]he presence-at-hand of entities is thrust to the fore.\u201916 One situation\nin which a breakdown may occur is when, in the course of everyday\nactivity, something vital is suddenly found missing. In an obvious\nsense, the missing thing is not ready-to-hand; indeed, it is not \u2018to hand\u2019\nat all. However, insofar as the readiness-to-hand of some other thing\nmay depend on the missing thing, this other thing now loses its familiar\nreadiness-to-hand and begins to obtrude as something present-at-hand.\nFor example, my office door is ready-to-hand when there is a key to open\nit. If, however, I have forgotten my key, the door suddenly loses much of\nits equipmental significance, or meaning. If it is Sunday morning, when\nthe administration is normally absent, then the readiness-to-hand of the\ndoor recedes still further. I encounter the door as ever more useless, a\nmere obstacle confounding the smooth running of the workaday context\nin which I normally find myself. If, furthermore, I have a flight leaving\nthat morning, and my flight tickets and passport are locked in my office,\nthen the door may lose entirely its significance as something ready-to-\nhand. I now encounter it in its brute existence, as a useless thing which\njust stands there confounding my travel plans. As Heidegger writes:\nThe more urgently [Je dringlicher] we need what is missing, and the\nmore authentically it is encountered in its un-readiness-to-hand, all\nthe more obtrusive [um so aufdringlicher] does that which is ready-to-\nhand become \u2014 so much so, indeed, that it seems to lose its character of\nreadiness-to-hand. It reveals itself as something present-at-hand and no\nmore, which cannot be budged without the thing that is missing. The\nhelpless way in which we stand before it is a deficient mode of concern,\nand as such it uncovers the Being-just-present-at-hand-and-no-more of\nsomething ready-to-hand.17\nThe sudden breakdown in the equipmental context of a work-world,\nwhich follows from the discovery that something vital to our operations\nin that world has gone missing, jars our attention from absorption in the\ntask at hand, suddenly bringing forward the presence-at-hand of what\nis normally experienced as ready-to-hand.\nHeidegger\u2019s phenomenological analysis of breakdowns in\ncircumspective concern demonstrates how a deficiency can suddenly\n16 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 107 [76].\n17 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 103 [73]. 64 Science as Social Existence\nappear in the subject\u2019s basic relation to a work-world, and hence also\nhow its understanding of things as ready-to-hand may begin to change\nover to an understanding of things as present-at-hand within the world.\nIn this first step, I encounter things as \u2018being-just-present-at-hand-and-\nno-more.\u2019 In some cases, the change-over may go no further than this:\nthe overworked department head may suddenly appear in the hallway\nwith a master key, allowing me to carry on with my travel plans. Yet,\nin other cases, one\u2019s understanding, rather than reverting back to a\nbasic existential state of circumspective concern, may change over to a\nnew mode of understanding through a process which Heidegger calls\n\u2018thematising.\u2019 This process is central to his existential conception of\nscience.\nWe have already encountered Heidegger\u2019s concept of thematising in\nsummarising the four-stage change-over from immersed involvement\nto the theoretical attitude. After immersed involvement switches to\na state of pure looking (stage one), a thing becomes thematised as\nan object of perception (stage two). Indeed, Heidegger emphasises\nthat: \u2018Thematizing Objectifies.\u201918 The change-over marks a shift from\nunderstanding a thing in the world as ready-to-hand to understanding it\nas present-at-hand, as an object. This is a shift in the existential structure of\nunderstanding, a structure Heidegger calls \u2018projection.\u201919 He argues that\nonly on the basis of a projection do we encounter a thing as meaningful:\n\u2018The primary projection of the understanding of Being \u201cgives\u201d the\nmeaning.\u201920 The projection may thus be understood as providing the\nbackground of intelligibility against which things come to be perceived\nas objects with determinate properties (stage three), and thence as\nthe subject matter for propositional knowledge claims (stage four). It\nshould be noted, however, that the projection, as the basic structure of\nunderstanding, is present even when no change-over occurs; it resides\njust as much in the undisturbed practical understanding characteristic\nof immersed involvement in a work-world. Whether one understands a\nthing as ready-to-hand or as present-at-hand within-the-world, such an\nunderstanding will always have the structure of a projection.21\n18 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 414 [363].\n19 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, pp. 185 [145].\n20 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 372 [324\u201325].\n21 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 371 [324]. 2. A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 65\nHeidegger argues that scientific understanding is structured on\nthe existential level by a particular kind of projection. The existentially\ndecisive feature of science is, in his view, neither empirical observation\nnor mathematical modelling, but rather \u2018the way in which Nature herself\nis mathematically projected.\u201922 This mathematical projection determines\nthe range of possible ways in which nature may be intelligibly\nexperienced, and so understood, both at the practical and the theoretical\nlevel. It furthermore serves as the existential source from which the\nlogical conception of science draws its own currency. In the context\nof scientific activity, the change-over from immersed involvement to\na theoretical conception of nature is a shift in the existential structure\nof the mathematical projection. According to Heidegger, within the\nscope of intelligibility opened up by this projection, pure looking shifts\nspecifically towards a perception of things as objects which can be\nquantitatively determined in terms of such general categories as motion,\nforce, location, and time. Only on the basis of this kind of projection\ncan the scientist discover something like a \u2018fact\u2019 which may then be\nset up as part of an experimental investigation.23 Heidegger suggests\nthat this mathematical grounding of factual science was possible only\nbecause researchers recognised that there are, in principle, no bare facts.\nScience projects the factuality of things in terms of categories amenable\nto quantitative analysis. Furthermore, it does this in such a way that the\nmeasurability of those things is disclosed as an a priori feature of their\nbeing. Heidegger thus argues that the existential conditions of possibility\nfor the empirico-mathematical sciences are manifest in the projection\nof nature as being essentially measurable in a fixed, quantitative sense.\nAfter these conditions have been fulfilled, the horizon within which\nthe subject is able to intelligibly encounter things limits the possible\nways in which things may be discovered within the world. Heidegger\nwrites that the aim of thematising is \u2018to free the entities we encounter\nwithin-the-world, and to free them in such a way that they can \u201cthrow\nthemselves against\u201d a pure discovering \u2014 that is, in such a way that\nthey can become \u201cObjects.\u201d\u201924\n22 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, pp. 413\u201314 [362].\n23 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 414 [362].\n24 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 414 [363]. 66 Science as Social Existence\nOnce there has been a disturbance in our immersed involvement with\nthings as ready-to-hand, it becomes possible for that non-deliberative\ninvolvement to change over into thematising, and hence for us to begin\nexperiencing things as objects rather than as equipment. Heidegger\nemphasises that the change-over in our understanding, from non-\ndeliberative use of a thing in the course of everyday activity, at the one\nextreme, to thematising and then making propositional assertions about\nthat thing, at the other, is marked by a number of intermediate steps.\nAs thematising begins to objectify a thing, that thing acquires a more\ndeterminate meaning; it comes to be experienced as an object whose\nproperties are an increasingly well-defined and stable subject matter\nfor assertions, and thus better fitted to the propositional structure of\ntheoretical and logical modes of understanding. Heidegger also calls\nthis a process of articulation: \u2018thematizing modifies and Articulates\nthe understanding of Being.\u201925 By articulating the meaning of a thing in\npropositional terms, thematising may also affect the way we understand,\nand hence practically engage with, that thing. Heidegger furthermore\nwarns that the intermediate stages of the thematising process cannot\nbe understood in terms of the theoretical statements which emerge\nonly at the conclusion of the process without dramatically perverting\nthe meaning of those stages. Both these intermediate stages, as well as\nthe theoretical assertions they finally constitute, have their \u2018source\u2019 in\na circumspective, or practical, form of interpretation.26 For this reason,\nHeidegger argues that logic is rooted in existence.27 The more general\nconclusion to be drawn from this is that the logical conception of science,\nwhich views science as a coherent body of true propositions, has its\nown original source in a specific existential mode of understanding\nstructured by the mathematical projection of nature.\nThe final implication of Heidegger\u2019s existential conception of\nscience is that to construe science in purely theoretical terms, as a body\nof logically organised true propositions, as a conceptual scheme, is to\nultimately misunderstand its significance as a human enterprise. He\nemphasises that scientific concepts cannot be understood independently\n25 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 415 [364].\n26 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 201 [158].\n27 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 203 [160]. This claim will be given more\ndetailed attention in Chapter Four. 2. A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 67\nof scientific method, and that \u2018theoretical research is not without a\npraxis of its own.\u201928 Unsurprisingly, then, his account of science gives a\ncentral and consequential place to scientists\u2019 practical manipulation of\nequipment:\nReading off the measurements which result from an experiment often\nrequires a complicated \u2018technical\u2019 set-up for the experimental design.\nObservation with a microscope is dependent upon the production\nof \u2018preparations.\u2019 Archaeological excavation, which precedes any\nInterpretation of the \u2018findings,\u2019 demands manipulations of the grossest\nkind. But even in the \u2018most abstract\u2019 way of working out problems\nand establishing what has been obtained, one manipulates equipment\nfor writing, for example. However \u2018uninteresting\u2019 and \u2018obvious\u2019 such\ncomponents of scientific research may be, they are by no means a matter\nof indifference ontologically.29\nIndeed, equipmental manipulations play an integral role in the\nthematising process which gives rise to theoretical knowledge. It is not\njust linguistic practices but also concrete material practices which serve to\nmore precisely articulate the meaning of the things taken up as a subject\nmatter for science. To say that the instruments and material practices of\na science are, in part, constitutive of its theoretical and logical content is\nto make a strong ontological claim about the interdependence of theory\nand practice. Yet interdependence is not identity. While theory cannot\nbe understood independently of the linguistic and material practices\nwhich constitute it, it is clear that, for Heidegger, theory and practice\nremain different modes of scientific understanding. He views them as\ndistinct but related existential modalities within which the intelligibility\nof things becomes possible.\nHeidegger thus appears to suggest that the emergence of a new\ntheoretical form of understanding, especially as exemplified historically\nin the development of mathematical physics, marks the emergence of\na new ontological condition, a new form to human existence wherein\nthe subject understands itself as a mental substance and the things\nsurrounding it as objects with quantifiably determinable properties.\nIn this process, the subject\u2019s own subjectivity likewise becomes\nincreasingly modelled in accordance with the proposition: scientific\n28 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 409 [358].\n29 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 409 [358]. 68 Science as Social Existence\nknowledge is propositionally structured knowledge. Heidegger\u2019s\nexistential conception of science thus challenges the priority of the\nlogical conception of science as propositionally structured theory, and\nseeks to reverse that priority by emphasising the concrete existential\nconditions on which theoretical knowledge ultimately depends. But\nthis is not a reduction of theory to practice; it is the recognition that,\nalthough practical and theoretical behaviour are ontologically distinct,\nand although the latter emerges in a change-over from the former, each\nrepresents a distinct mode of the same existential projection of nature.\nTheory is distinct from, but not ontologically independent of, practice.\nWhere the line between the two should be drawn, however, is a question\nHeidegger does not, and perhaps could not, answer. Indeed, he openly\nlamented that \u2018it is by no means patent where the ontological boundary\nbetween \u201ctheoretical\u201d and \u201cnon-theoretical\u201d behaviour really runs!\u201930\nThat there is indeed a boundary running between them is, however,\nsomething he did not doubt.\n3. Getting at the Real\nIn Chapter One, we briefly considered the way in which Heidegger\ndifferentiates his existential analytic of the subject from both realism\nand idealism. With the above discussion of Heidegger\u2019s existential\nconception of science now also behind us, it will be worthwhile to\nreturn to his comments on realism and idealism and considering them\nin greater depth.\nHeidegger superficially agrees with the realist that things within-\nthe-world are present-at-hand, in the sense that they exist. However, he\ncriticises the realist for conceptualising the presence-at-hand of things\nin strictly epistemological terms, as the \u2018objecthood\u2019 of independently\nexisting objects of knowledge. This conceptualisation takes it for\ngranted that propositional thinking is itself a fundamental mode of the\nsubject\u2019s existence, that the subject\u2019s relation to a thing within-the-world\nis fundamentally that of a substance-subject examining an independent\nobject. Hence, Heidegger describes realism as the belief that \u2018the way\nto grasp the Real is by that kind of knowing which is characterized\n30 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 409 [358]. 2. A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 69\nby beholding [das anschauende Erkennen].\u201931 Yet, as we saw in the\nprevious section, such knowing (or cognising) emerges from a change-\nover in the subject\u2019s understanding of things from things ready-to-hand\nto things present-at-hand, and so, for this reason, Heidegger goes on\nto question whether our \u2018primary access\u2019 to the real, that is, to existing\nthings, can be suitably captured by the traditional epistemological\nconception of knowledge as rooted in the observational powers of a\nsubstance-subject positioned vis-\u00e0-vis an object.32 Indeed, he argues\ninstead that perceptual examination presupposes thematisation. The\ncentral failing of realism, according to Heidegger, is that it asserts the\nindependent reality of objects while simultaneously projecting that\nreality as part of an objectifying thematisation which depends for its\npossibility on the subject\u2019s existence. In this regard, Heidegger views\nidealism as the more successful position, since it affirms the ontological\ndependency of objects on our understanding of them. In other words,\nidealism rejects the realist claim that our knowledge of objects within-\nthe-world provides evidence for the independent existence of the real as\nsuch. However, Heidegger dismisses the conclusion which the idealist\nthen draws from this insight: that the real must therefore exist only in\nconsciousness, that it must be constituted solely by the subject.33 On\nHeidegger\u2019s account, neither realism nor idealism offers a defensible\nposition because they both remain entangled in the epistemological\nproblematic, and hence they both fail to recognise the ontological basis\nfor that problematic in the subject\u2019s own existence. As he puts it, realism\nand idealism \u2018can exist only on the basis of a neglect: they presuppose a\nconcept of \u201csubject\u201d and \u201cobject\u201d without clarifying these basic concepts\nwith respect to the basic composition of Dasein itself.\u201934\nAlthough Heidegger offers his existential analytic of the subject as\nan alternative to both realism and idealism, in this section I will argue\nthat Heidegger\u2019s position is nevertheless compatible with a \u2018minimal\u2019\nform of realism. I contrast this minimal realism with the \u2018robust\u2019 realism\ntypically espoused by scientific realists. The difference between these\n31 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 246 [202].\n32 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 246 [202].\n33 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 251 [207].\n34 M artin Heidegger (1985), History of the Concept of Time, trans. by Theodore Kisiel\n(Bloomington: Indiana University Press), pp. 222\u201323. 70 Science as Social Existence\ntwo doctrines becomes clear once we recognise that robust realism is\ncomprised of two distinct theses. The first thesis declares that things can\nexist independently of our own existence, that they are not the products\nof our interpretations, theories, or practices. The second thesis makes\nthe more complex assertion that the determinate properties of these\nthings, including their relational or structural properties, can also exist\nindependently of our own existence. Robust realism affirms both the\nfirst and the second thesis, while minimal realism affirms only the first\nthesis. I will call this first thesis the \u2018basic independence thesis.\u2019 As we\nwill see in the next section, this twofold account of realism has striking\nsimilarities with SSK practitioner Barry Barnes\u2019s account of \u2018double-\nbarrelled\u2019 realism.\nThat Heidegger\u2019s existential conception of science is compatible with\nthe basic independence thesis can be seen in his careful discrimination\nbetween reality, on the one hand, and the real, on the other. He writes,\nfor example, that \u2018Being (not entities) is dependent on the understanding\nof Dasein; that is to say, Reality (not the Real) is dependent on care,\u2019\nwith care being a fundamental existential structure in the subjectivity\nof the subject. He furthermore emphasises the dependency of reality on\nthe subject when he says of reality that \u2018ontologically it has a definite\nconnection in its foundations with Dasein, the world, and readiness-to-\nhand.\u2019 Finally, he argues that, when entities are conceived as a \u2018context\nof Things (res),\u2019 by which he means a context of \u2018substances,\u2019 the being\nof those entities acquires the meaning of \u2018Reality,\u2019 or \u2018substantiality.\u201935\nAgain, the idea is that things can be held distinct from the way in which\nthey are experienced and conceptualised by the subject, including\ntheir conceptualisation as property-bearing substances. In short, one\nmay interpret Heidegger as arguing that reality depends on the\nsubject\u2019s understanding. In the absence of such understanding, there\ncan be no reality. However, the real, in contrast, is independent of\nthe subject\u2019s understanding, and hence may exist in the absence of\nsuch understanding. Note, furthermore, that Heidegger is careful to\ndistinguish the independent existence of the real from the assertion of its\nindependent existence.\n35 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, pp. 255 [212], 245 [201]. 2. A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 71\nOf course only as long as Dasein is (that is, only as long as an understanding\nof Being is [\u2026] possible), \u2018is there\u2019 [gibt es] Being. When Dasein does not\nexist, \u2018independence\u2019 \u2018is\u2019 not either, nor \u2018is\u2019 the \u2018in-itself.\u2019 In such a case\nthis sort of thing can be neither understood nor not understood. In such\na case even entities within-the-world can neither be discovered nor lie\nhidden. In such a case it cannot be said that entities are, nor can it be said\nthat they are not. But now, as long as there is an understanding of Being\nand therefore an understanding of presence-at-hand, it can indeed be\nsaid that in this case entities will still continue to be.36\nThe point here is that, in the absence of the subject, there would be\nnobody around to assert the independent existence of the real. The\nreal could thus not be understood to exist independently of the subject\nbecause, in such a case, understanding itself would be absent. However,\nin the context of the current discussion, where there is understanding, it\nbecomes possible to assert that the real does indeed exist independently\nof our understanding, and furthermore that it will continue to so exist\neven once we, and hence our understanding, are gone. The assertion that\nthe real exists independently of the subject, and even the fact that it so\nexists, entails the existence of the subject, but the independent existence\nof the real does not.\nThis issue may be further illuminated by introducing a distinction\nbetween a thing\u2019s existence and its intelligibility. There is, according\nto Heidegger, an internal relation between the subject\u2019s being-in-the-\nworld, on the one hand, and the intelligibility of the real, on the other.\nOnly things disclosed within the context of the subject-world relation\nmay be encountered as intelligible. In other words, intelligibility can\nbe a feature only of things within-the-world; a thing without-the-world\ncannot be understood by the subject, and, for this reason, it cannot be\nintelligible.\nIn Being and Time, Heidegger explores two phenomenologically\ndistinct ways in which we may encounter the real as intelligible: either\nin terms of \u2018readiness-to-hand\u2019 (Zuhandenheit, or \u2018equipmentality\u2019),\nor in terms of \u2018presence-at-hand\u2019 (Vorhandenheit). In the former case,\nequipment is that with which we are involved in our workaday dealings\nin the world. In the course of our ongoing immersed involvement\nwith equipmental things, we understand the world as a work-world,\n36 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 255 [212]. 72 Science as Social Existence\na totality of interrelated equipment available for our use. In the latter\ncase, substances, or objects, are those things about which we concern\nourselves when we take up a spectator\u2019s position in the world. Through\nour encounters with things as objects of observation, we may thus\ndevelop an understanding of the world as an object-world, a totality\nof substance with thematically determinable properties. According to\nHeidegger, the world encountered in this second way is what realists\nrefer to as \u2018reality.\u2019 Realists thus violate the basic independence thesis\ninsofar as they identify the real, as such, with the way it is encountered\n\u2018in reality,\u2019 that is, in the world constituted by a particular mode of the\nsubject\u2019s projective understanding.\nFrom this it should be clear that to distinguish the existence of the\nreal from its intelligibility is to assert that the real may exist without the\nworld, which is just to say, without the subject. This assertion forms the\nbasis for the minimal realism which I suggest is present in Heidegger\u2019s\nearly work. The assertion is most powerfully evinced in Being and Time,\nin the different ways in which Heidegger uses the term \u2018present-at-\nhand,\u2019 and in The Basic Problems of Phenomenology, with the distinction\nhe draws between the existence and essence of a thing. Let us now\nconsider the evidence from these two texts.\nThat Heidegger uses the term \u2018present-at-hand\u2019 in different ways has\noften been overlooked by commentators, and this has led to significant\nconfusion over his intentions in Being and Time. One influential example\nof such confusion, present in the work of Joseph Rouse, will be\naddressed later in this chapter. In the meantime, it should be noted that\nHeidegger himself did not articulate these different uses as explicitly as\nhe might have, and so responsibility for the subsequent confusion must\nlie, in some considerable part, at his own feet. Possibly the best study\nseeking to clarify these tricky exegetical matters comes from Joseph Fell,\nwho detects at least four distinct senses for the term \u2018present-at-hand\u2019 in\nHeidegger\u2019s early work. Only two of these need worry us here.37 In the\nfirst case, a thing is encountered as present-at-hand following a local\n37 J oseph P. Fell (1989), \u2018The Familiar and the Strange: On the Limits of Praxis in the\nEarly Heidegger,\u2019 in Heidegger and Praxis, ed. by Thomas J. Nenon (The Southern\nJournal of Philosophy 28, Spindel Conference Supplement), pp. 23\u201341. Of the two\nother senses, the first is an \u2018improper\u2019 sense in which all entities, including the\nsubject, are referred to as present-at-hand things. Obviously, this is not a use to\nwhich Heidegger puts the word. The second is a sense in which all referentiality 2. A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 73\nbreakdown in the subject\u2019s workaday world. In the second case, the\nterm denotes those things which have been thematised as objects. In\nthe first case, one encounters the real as something which exists but\nwhich cannot be understood, something which lacks intelligibility. In\nthe second case, one encounters the real as something which both exists\nand is intelligible. We have already met both of these modes of being\npresent-at-hand in the previous section. According to Heidegger\u2019s\nphenomenological description of equipmental breakdowns, when I\nstand desperate and discombobulated in front of my locked office\ndoor, I experience the door deficiently as a thing \u2018just-present-at-hand-\nand-no-more.\u2019 In contrast, when I encounter a thing thematically, as\nan object of perception, and hence also as the potential subject matter\nfor a propositional assertion, I experience it as possessing \u2018a definite\ncharacter in its being-present-at-hand-in-such-and-such-a-manner.\u201938\nThese two ways in which the real can be present-at-hand \u2014 as either\npresent-at-hand-in-such-and-such-a-manner or present-at-hand-and-\nno-more \u2014 correspond, respectively, to things present-at-hand within-\nthe-world and things present-at-hand without-the-world. The second\nis phenomenologically available only when there is a deficiency in our\nunderstanding, a breakdown in the subject-world relation. Under these\ncircumstances, we can still say that the thing exists, but we cannot say\nwhat it is. When such a deficiency occurs, the real can still be experienced\nas something which exists, but it lacks any determinate character by\nwhich we could make sense of it.\nThis crucial distinction is a central outcome of Heidegger\u2019s enquiry\ninto the \u2018question of being,\u2019 that is, into the meaning of the infinitive\nverb \u2018to be\u2019 and its cognates. In Being and Time, Heidegger lists a number\nof \u2018prejudices and presuppositions which are constantly reimplanting\nand fostering the belief that an inquiry into Being is unnecessary.\u201939 One\nsuch prejudice is the assumption that the meaning of \u2018being\u2019 is self-\nevident. He notes that \u2018[w]henever one cognizes anything or makes\nan assertion, whenever one comports oneself towards things, even\ntowards oneself, some use is made of \u201cBeing\u201d; and this expression\nfails and the world as a whole becomes unintelligible. Attention will be given to\nthis underappreciated use of \u2018present-at-hand\u2019 in the latter part of Chapter Three.\n38 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 200 [158].\n39 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 22 [2\u20133]. 74 Science as Social Existence\nis held to be intelligible \u201cwithout further ado,\u201d just as everyone\nunderstands \u201cThe sky is blue,\u201d \u201cI am merry,\u201d and the like.\u201940 Heidegger\nresists the impulse to treat the meaning of \u2018being\u2019 as self-evident. One\nimportant observation he makes is that the word \u2018being\u2019 is polysemic.\nIn The Basic Problems of Phenomenology, a set of lectures he delivered in\n1927, the same year in which Being and Time was published, Heidegger\nidentifies at least two basic meanings for the term \u2018being\u2019 \u2014 existence\nand essence \u2014 and he argues that both belong to the being of a thing.\nFurthermore, the existence of a thing answers to the question of whether\nit is, and its essence answers to the question of what it is.41 Two years later,\nin a 1929\u20131930 lecture course, Heidegger would restate the whether and\nwhat of a thing in terms of a thing\u2019s \u2018that-being\u2019 and \u2018what-being.\u201942 In\nmost cases, these two meanings will combine in a single proposition:\n\u2018The sky is blue\u2019 tells us both that there is a sky, that it exists, and that it\nhas the property, the whatness or quidditas, of being blue.\nThe distinction between existence and essence is an ancient one.\nIndeed, Heidegger points out that its roots can be traced back to the\nbiblical notion of a divine Creator: \u2018The ancient distinction runs thus:\nSince every entity that is actual comes from God, the understanding of\nthe being of entities must ultimately be traced back to God.\u201943 This ancient\ndoctrine was transformed by medieval Christian metaphysicians into the\nidea that entities exist only as the creatures of God, that is, as produced.\nHence, essence \u2014 as pure potentiality in the \u2018mind\u2019 of God \u2014 takes\npriority over existence \u2014 as God\u2019s idea made actual. Echoing Plato,\nthe philosopher Charles Kahn has offered an apt description of this\ndoctrine: \u2018existence now tends to be thought of as the final push into\nactual being provided by the Demiurge, as He sends things forth from\nHis pre-cosmic workshop of logical possibilities.\u201944\nAs we saw in Chapter One, Heidegger reversed this ontological\norder in his existential analysis of the subject. For him, \u2018[t]he essence\n40 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 23 [4].\n41 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, pp. 78, 88.\n42 M artin Heidegger (1995a [1983]), The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics: World,\nFinitude, Solitude, trans. by William McNeill and Nicholas Walker (Bloomington:\nIndiana University Press), p. 331.\n43 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 81; translation modified.\n44 C harles H.

A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 75\nof Dasein lies in its existence.\u201945 We can now see that Heidegger made\na similar move with respect to present-at-hand things, that is, things\nwhich exist but are not subjects, insofar as he took their existence to also\nbe phenomenologically prior to their essence. However, such things\nare unlike the subject in that their essence does not lie in their own\nexistence; it lies rather in the world as constituted by the existence of\nthe subject. Hence, the essence of such things depends on our existence,\nbut their existence does not. It is important to note that Heidegger does\nnot so much reject the ancient productionist metaphysics as challenge\nits Christian interpretation. As the source of essence and meaning,\nhuman beings now assume the role of creator. Yet, notwithstanding\nsuch fictional things as Don Quixote or Daffy Duck, neither of which\nis present-at-hand, human beings do not produce things ex nihilo.\nIndeed, drawing from a pre-Christian productionist metaphysics, the\nearly Heidegger argues that when something is produced it is always\nproduced from something else; the notion of production thus always\npresupposes the prior existence of some material: \u2018If we bring to mind\nproductive comportment in the scope of its full structure we see that\nit always makes use of what we call material, for instance, material\nfor building a house. On its part this material is in the end not in turn\nproduced but is already there.\u201946 From this observation, Heidegger draws\nthe more general conclusion that, when considering any productive\nactivity, \u2018matter\u2019 necessarily arises as a basic phenomenological\nconcept.47 The subject discovers this indeterminate material in use as\nequipment ready-to-hand, or the subject may step back and observe it\nas an object present-at-hand. In either case, the material is experienced\nas something within-the-world, as \u2018intraworldly.\u2019 Yet Heidegger also\nmakes it clear that this material, which he also calls \u2018nature,\u2019 does not\ndepend on the subject for its existence:\n[I]ntraworldliness does not belong to nature\u2019s being. Rather, in commerce\nwith this entity, nature in the broadest sense, we understand that this\nentity is as something extant, as an entity that we come up against, to\nwhich we are delivered over, which on its own part already is. It is, even\nif we do not uncover it, without our encountering it within our world.\n45 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 67 [42].\n46 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 115.\n47 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 116. 76 Science as Social Existence\nBeing within the world devolves upon this entity, nature, solely when it is\nuncovered as an entity.48\nSo as to leave no doubt that this indeterminate thing, nature, can\nexist independently of subjectivity and world, Heidegger repeats the\npoint several more times: \u2018[n]ature can also be when no Dasein exists\u2019;\n\u2018[n]ature can also be without there being a world, without a Dasein\nexisting.\u201949 My argument in this section has been that Heidegger\u2019s\nconcepts of pure extantness or existence, of presence-at-hand without-\nthe-world, of indeterminate matter, and of independent nature can all\nbe read as various attempts to get at \u2018the real,\u2019 that is, at that which\nexists independently of our theoretical and practical activity. Together,\nthey provide a richly articulated argument in defence of the basic\nindependence thesis, and hence for the position I call \u2018minimal realism.\u2019\nIn the next section, we will return to a discussion of the sociology\nof scientific knowledge. Specifically, I aim to show that SSK\u2019s oft-\noverlooked endorsement of realism is importantly similar to the\nminimal realism I have now drawn out of Heidegger\u2019s early texts. By\nexploiting these similarities, it becomes possible to free SSK\u2019s realism\nfrom the difficulties arising from its lingering adherence to the ontology\nimplicit in the orthodox subject-object distinction. In the next but one\nsection, I will then demonstrate the virtues of minimal realism in critical\ncomparison with an influential, alternative interpretation of early\nHeidegger\u2019s philosophy of science, that of Joseph Rouse.\n4. A Phenomenological Reformulation\nof SSK\u2019s Residual Realism\nAs discussed in Chapter One, SSK practitioners are often criticised\nby their opponents for allegedly subscribing to sociological idealism.\nThe underlying premise driving such criticism seems to be that social\nconstructivism is incompatible with realism. There is a puzzle here,\nhowever, as leading SSK practitioners have consistently insisted on\ntheir credentials both as social constructivists and as realists. For them,\nthe two positions are not mutually exclusive. Nevertheless, there can be\n48 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 169; translation modified.\n49 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 170, 175. 2. A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 77\nno doubt that social constructivists do reject something that scientific\nrealists hold dear. So, what is it? Barry Barnes provides an answer. He\nsuggests that realism, as it is usually defined in the literature, is actually\na \u2018double-barrelled\u2019 realism, that is, a combination of two distinct\nclaims: (1) that an external reality exists independently of our beliefs\nand theories; and (2) that the truth of specific beliefs and theories is\ndetermined by that reality.50 Barnes claims that most realists in the\nphilosophy of science take both of these claims for granted, but that the\nfirst alone provides sufficient grounds for claiming the credentials of a\nrealist. It is this first claim which many SSK practitioners accept, making\nthem adherents to a position which Barnes dubs \u2018residual realism.\u2019 He\nargues that residual realism is compatible with social constructivism.\nBarnes\u2019s distinction immediately recalls the distinction I drew in\nthe previous section between two theses: the independent existence of\nnature; and the independent existence of the determinate properties or\nstructures of nature. I called the first of these the \u2018basic independence\nthesis\u2019 and defined minimal realism as a position which affirms this first\nthesis while rejecting the second. Barnes\u2019s first claim appears almost\nidentical with the basic independence thesis, and thus his residual\nrealism would seem very close to my minimal realism. Indeed, at\none point in his discussion, Barnes even describes residual realism as\n\u2018minimal realism.\u201951 Yet, there is an important difference between the\ntwo. Barnes\u2019s residual realism asserts the independence of an \u2018external\nreality.\u2019 Minimal realism, in contrast, asserts the independence of an\nindeterminate and undifferentiated nature. As we have seen, there is an\nimportant conceptual difference between the notion of an indeterminate\nnature and the notion of an external reality: the latter implies a theoretical\ncommitment not found in the former. This is a commitment to what, in\nChapter One, I called the glass-bulb model. Because he takes the glass-\nbulb model for granted, Barnes\u2019s residual realism has more in common\nwith standard forms of realism than does minimal realism.\nHeidegger argues that the orthodox realist asserts the independence of\nreality while unwittingly projecting that reality as part of an objectifying\n50 B arnes (1992a), \u2018Relativism, Realism and Finitism,\u2019 in Cognitive Realism and Social\nScience, ed. by Diederick Raven, Lietke van Vucht and Jan de Wolf (New Brunswick,\nNJ: Transaction), pp. 131\u201347 (p. 132).\n51 B arnes (1992a), \u2018Relativism, Realism and Finitism,\u2019 p. 133. 78 Science as Social Existence\nthematisation which itself depends on the subject\u2019s being-in-the-world.\n\u2018Reality\u2019 is thus a concept whose meaning derives from our picture of the\nworld as a totality of objects standing in ontological separation from a\ncognising subject. On this basis, the traditional realist must now explain\nhow the ontological divide between subject and object may be crossed,\nhow one may transit from the inside to the outside of the glass bulb, how,\nin short, knowledge of the external world is possible. The prevailing\ntendency of orthodox realists is to root knowledge of the external world\nin the observational powers of the subject. Underlying this tendency is the\nassumption that the subject is itself a special sort of object, a substance with\nan added perceptual power which gives it access to the objects populating\na world beyond itself. Heidegger, of course, rejects the primacy of this\nepistemological model, analysing it in existential-phenomenological\nterms as depending on a more basic subject-world relation in light of\nwhich the epistemological problematic no longer carries force. In this way,\nas we saw in Chapter One, Heidegger is able to short-circuit sceptical\ndoubts about the existence of an external world by deconstructing the\npremises uncritically adopted by the sceptic and traditional realist alike.\nAs we also saw in Chapter One, many SSK practitioners, Barnes included,\njoin traditional realists in uncritically adopting those premises, and so\nthey are perpetually vulnerable to sceptical attack.\nMy argument in this section is that SSK need only defend the basic\nindependence thesis in order to achieve its goals. This thesis is what\nremains once one has stripped Barnes\u2019s first claim \u2014 that an external\nreality exists independently of our beliefs and theories \u2014 of the additional\ntheoretical premises to which it also needlessly commits itself. Because\nSSK practitioners have failed to sufficiently recognise the contingency\nof those premises, thus tacitly accepting the fundamentality of the glass-\nbulb model, they end up defending an unnecessarily robust position\nwhich renders their approach ineluctably vulnerable to sceptical attack.\nIt must be emphasised, however, that, in recommending that SSK\npractitioners trade their theoretically-loaded residual realism for a more\nphenomenologically modest minimal realism, I am not suggesting that\nthe orthodox subject-object distinction should simply be abandoned\nas a useless bit of conceptual confusion. Indeed, one can easily agree\nthat the style of thought which takes this distinction as its foundation\nhas produced valuable results. The point is that this style of thought, 2. A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 79\ndespite its success in specific areas, has proved incapable of defending\nitself against sceptical doubt. Indeed, it may well be that the inescapable\npossibility of such doubt is an inherent feature of that very style. If\nthe orthodox distinction were accepted as the conceptual bedrock for\nour way of understanding ourselves and the world in which we live,\nthen we would need to simply accept sceptical doubt as an inevitable\nfeature of our very existence. But neither this distinction nor the\nontological presuppositions underlying it form the conceptual bedrock\nof our understanding, and hence they need not ground our conviction\nthat nature exists independently of our theories, interpretations, and\npractices. If we wish only to defend the indubitability of the basic\nindependence thesis, then there is no reason why we should also\nsaddle ourselves with the more onerous, and probably fruitless, task\nof defending the indubitability of an allegedly fundamental distinction\nbetween subject and object.\nYet this is just what David Bloor has attempted to do. He argues that\nthe received subject-object distinction, once freed from individualism,\nis a foundational concept, and he does this on the basis of a theory of\nreference. In his view, \u2018[r]eference is an intentional state demanding\nintentional, conceptual and propositional content, that is, things which\nrequire an explanation of their normativity and objectivity.\u201952 Bloor\nnaturally favours a sociological explanation of the normativity and\nobjectivity of such content. For him, reference is a collective achievement\nmade possible by social interaction. This sociological theory of the\nnormativity and objectivity of conceptual content is a central pillar\nof SSK. Bloor furthermore claims that reference is an intentional state\ndemanding intentional, conceptual, and propositional content. For the\npurposes of the present analysis, whether that content is best explained\nin collectivist or individualist terms is beside the point. In the remainder\nof this section, the meaning of the term \u2018subject\u2019 should thus be treated\nas neutral between the terms \u2018group\u2019 and \u2018individual.\u2019\nThe principal problem with Bloor\u2019s theory of reference is that he\ntakes it to apply, not just to objects within the world, but to the world as\nsuch. He writes of \u2018genuine reference to an external reality.\u201953 In addition,\n52 D avid Bloor (2001), \u2018What Is a Social Construct?,\u2019 Facta Philosophica 3, 141\u201356 (p.\n148).\n53 B loor (2001), \u2018What Is a Social Construct?,\u2019 p. 149. 80 Science as Social Existence\nhe seems to think that knowledge of an external reality is a necessary\ncondition for reference to particular objects. Yet, from the perspective\nof existential phenomenology, Bloor has got things backwards. In fact,\nknowledge of particular objects is a necessary condition for referring\nto the world, as such, as an external reality. Only once we have\nexperienced things within-the-world as objects, and hence as distinct\nfrom a subject, can we then conceptualise the world itself as a reality\nwhich stands externally to a subject; only under these conditions does\nreference to an external reality become possible. Furthermore, reference\nto an object depends on a specific existential mode of being-in-the-\nworld. We can refer to objects only because we are already in the world;\nthe subject-world relation is ontologically prior to an encounter with\nthings within-the-world as objects. Thus Bloor is right that acceptance\nof the subject-object distinction is entailed by the claim that an external\nreality exists, but he is wrong that this claim must be endorsed out\nof necessity. That he believes we cannot help but accept this claim is\nimplied in his assertion that \u2018we are all instinctive realists.\u201954 But the\nbelief in an external reality is not hardwired into our brains; it is the\nresult of a change-over in the subject\u2019s mode of understanding, a change\nfrom immersed involvement with things to a thematising projection of\nthings, and then of the world itself, as objects of knowledge standing\nin separation from an autonomous subject. Belief in an external reality\nthus presupposes the diagnostic model of the glass bulb.\nThe key point here is that the subject-object distinction is a modification\nof the more fundamental subject-world relation. Moreover, this second\nrelation is internal; there can be no world which exists independently of\nthe subject. The implication is that the subject-object relation is thus also\nan internal relation; there can be no object which exists independently\nof the subject. However, this is not to say that nothing at all exists\nindependently of the subject. As Heidegger writes, \u2018[n]ature can also be\nwithout there being a world, without a Dasein existing.\u201955 Hence, nature\nshould not be confused with the world, including the world projected\nthematically as an external reality. Yet this is what Bloor does. He writes\nthat \u2018nature, in our ordinary way of thinking, is the object of knowledge,\nthe thing that is known, while science is the knowledge we have of it, our\n54 D avid Bloor (1996), \u2018Idealism and the Sociology of Knowledge,\u2019 Social Studies of\nScience 26(4), 839\u201356 (p. 845).\n55 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 175. 2. A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 81\ntheories about it and our description of it.\u201956 Bloor appeals to our \u2018ordinary\u2019\nway of thinking in order to maintain a strict distinction between nature\nand its scientific description, between an object of cognition and its\nconceptualisation by a cognising subject. Yet it is not clear why we should\naccept Bloor\u2019s implicit assumption that ordinary thinking demands\nacceptance of the subject-object distinction, that is, the theory-laden view\nthat nature itself is an object of observation. It seems more \u2018ordinary\u2019 to\nsay that nature is just that which exists independently of our descriptions\nand theories. This is precisely what is claimed in the basic independence\nthesis of minimal realism, and it has the advantage of avoiding the sorts\nof sceptical problems inevitably attracted by a foundational commitment\nto the subject-object distinction. As long as Bloor insists on calling nature\nan object, on conceiving of it in terms of one side of the subject-object\nschema, as long as he takes the glass-bulb model for granted, he cannot\ncomfortably maintain the independence thesis that is basic to any genuine\nrealist position. However, as soon as he gives up conceptualising nature\nas an object, he can no longer include nature, as such, under the umbrella\nof his theory of reference, because under that theory reference is always\nreference to an object, to a thing present-at-hand within-the-world.\nThere are some signs that Bloor has recognised this lattermost problem.\nIn remarkable coincidence with Heidegger\u2019s comments on production,\nBloor observes that the idea of construction has connotations of \u2018building\nand making\u2019: \u2018What is built, must be built from something: construction\nneeds materials. Despite the claims of critics, the very term precludes the\nidea that \u201ceverything is constructed.\u201d\u201957 Moreover, in discussing Kuhn\u2019s\naccount of scientific discovery, Bloor writes: \u2018The scientist must come to\nrealise that something is the case, and what is the case. There must be\nsome generalised awareness of novelty and also a conceptualisation\nof the novelty.\u201958 At first, the scientist only encounters nature as pure\nextantness, as an indeterminately existing thing, and hence as something\nwhich escapes conceptualisation.

The scientist\u2019s encounter thus cannot be characterised as an\nepistemic one, as an act of knowing or believing, but only as a \u2018generalised\nawareness\u2019 of the thing\u2019s brute existence. Only by thematising the thing,\nonly by interpreting its brute existence in the context of a world of pre-\nstructured anticipations, can the scientist make sense of that thing, and\nonly then can she begin to form concepts about the thing\u2019s essence, about\nwhat it is. Here, then, Bloor seems poised to limit the application of his\ntheory of reference, and hence also his commitment to the subject-object\ndistinction, so as to accommodate the phenomenological observation that\nwe are able to experience nature in its brute state of indeterminate and\nundifferentiated existence. In other words, Bloor seems ready to accept\nthe basic independence thesis of minimal realism.\nYet, Bloor then appears to lose his nerve. He writes that \u2018[t]he pure\n\u201cempiricist\u201d encounter with the world corresponds roughly to the that.\u201959\nBy modelling experience of nature in orthodox empiricist terms, Bloor\nappears to slip back into the problematic embrace of the subject-object\ndistinction. As a consequence, he conflates a generalised awareness of\nnature in its brute existence for a conceptualisation of it in terms of an\nexternal world. He suggests that\n[t]he typical empiricist interrogation of a knowledge claim (to find out\nexactly what the claimants saw, heard, smelled, tasted, and touched) can\nbe thought of as providing the raw materials out of which concepts are\nconstructed. Notice that what is at issue here are sensory processes, that\nis, psychological and physiological causes of belief. [\u2026] The causal story\nbegins with observations not observation reports.60\nBloor assimilates the \u2018raw materials\u2019 of experience to objects of\nobservation because he takes for granted the idea that the human being\nis a substance-subject which gains epistemic access to an external reality\nthrough \u2018sensory processes.\u2019 On this model, the subject is treated as an\nobject distinguishable from other objects by its possession of a special\npower of perception. Observation, then, is meant to pierce the glass bulb\nseparating the subject from the external world. The sceptic, of course,\ncould not be happier with this particular arrangement.\n59 B loor (2001), \u2018What Is a Social Construct?,\u2019 p. 150.\n60 B loor (2001), \u2018What Is a Social Construct?,\u2019 p. 153. 2. A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 83\nThe obstacle blocking SSK practitioners\u2019 unambiguous endorsement\nof the basic independence thesis is their tacit adherence to the glass-bulb\nmodel. Their reason for securing this schema at the centre of their social\ntheory of knowledge is an admirable one: they wish to reconcile social\nconstructivism with realism by holding fast the distinction between\nnature, on the one hand, and descriptions of nature, on the other.\nUnfortunately, they believe that this task entails a commitment to the\nfundamentality of the subject-object distinction. But such a commitment\nis unnecessary for, and indeed contrary to, their ultimate goal. As I\nhope to have shown thus far, once a distinction has been made between\nnature and world, the subject-object distinction can be set aside while\nstill preserving the distinction between nature and its description. In\nother words, the basic independence thesis can be maintained without\nrecourse to the orthodox subject-object schema. By accepting this thesis,\nand by thus trading in their residual realism for a minimal realism\nrooted in existential phenomenology, SSK practitioners would preserve\ntheir coveted distinction between nature and its description, and hence\nalso be able to more effectively assert their credentials as both realists\nand social constructivists.\nOne implication of the present argument is that Heidegger\u2019s own\nearly philosophy is compatible with the social constructivism favoured\nby SSK practitioners. This is a suggestion I am happy to accept. However,\nas we will see in the next section, the philosopher Joseph Rouse has\npresented a different interpretation of Heidegger, to the effect that\nthe latter\u2019s early philosophy instead motivates a social constructivism\nin which no place at all can be found for a realist position, not even a\nminimal one. This presents a powerful challenge to the interpretation\nbeing elaborated here, and so we must give it careful consideration.\n5. Rouse on Heidegger and Realism\nJoseph Rouse is arguably the most prominent figure in science studies\nto have made positive use of Heidegger\u2019s early philosophy of science.\nIn his 1987 book, Knowledge and Power, where he laid out the basic\narchitecture of his reading of Heidegger, Rouse combines Heidegger\u2019s\nhermeneutics \u2014 the study of thinking as interpretation \u2014 with his\nphenomenology of practice in order to craft what Rouse calls a \u2018practical 84 Science as Social Existence\nhermeneutics of science.\u201961 This practical hermeneutics treats science as\na collection of interrelated interpretative practices, rather than as an\nabstract system of concepts and theories. These interpretative practices\nare exemplified by material activities in the scientific laboratory. Rouse\nthus accepts Heidegger\u2019s existential conception of science, and attempts\nto further elaborate it by exploring the constitutive role played by\nmaterial practice in relation to concrete modes of scientific existence.\nRouse argues that Heidegger\u2019s hermeneutics was motivated by the\nquestion of \u2018how it is that anything shows up at all.\u2019 According to him,\nHeidegger answered this question with the argument that the subjects\nfor whom things \u2018show up\u2019 must have certain characteristics, the\nforemost among them being their membership in a \u2018self-adjudicating\ncommunity.\u201962 Members of a self-adjudicating community recognise\none another on the basis of their shared ways of responding to a\ncommon environment. Rouse thus argues that Heidegger\u2019s word\nfor the subject, Dasein, denotes the communal state of being \u2018socially\nand behaviorally self-adjudicating interpreters.\u201963 In other words, the\nsubjectivity of the subject is enmeshed in the intersubjective realm of\na community of subjects. Heidegger calls this the subject\u2019s \u2018being-with,\u2019\nand he argues that, like being-in-the-world, it is a fundamental aspect\nof the subjectivity of the subject.64 On this construal of Heidegger, Rouse\nconcludes that, if anything is to \u2018show up at all,\u2019 then it must show up for\na self-adjudicating interpretive community. Furthermore, because this\ncommunity is defined in terms of practical, as opposed to theoretical,\nacts of interpretation, it is on the basis of practical rather than theoretical\ninterpretive acts that things \u2018show up.\u2019 Rouse locates these practical acts\nin the material practices of the sciences, with particular emphasis on\n61 T he present discussion draws, in part, from Jeff Kochan (2011a), \u2018Getting Real with\nRouse and Heidegger,\u2019 Perspectives on Science 19(1), 81\u2013115, which offers a more\ndetailed critique of Rouse\u2019s practical hermeneutics of science in the context of his\ninterpretation of Heidegger. Anna de Bruyckere and Maarten Van Dyck have tried\nto defend Rouse against this critique (Anna de Bruyckere and Maarten Van Dyck\n(2013), \u2018Being in or Getting at the Real: Kochan on Rouse, Heidegger and Minimal\nRealism,\u2019 Perspectives of Science 21(4), 453\u201362). However, their argument crucially\ndepends on the false claim that I treat existence as the \u2018property\u2019 of a thing. My\nview is that a thing must exist in order to have a property. Properties constitute the\nessence (whatness), not the existence (thatness), of things.\n62 Rouse (1987a), Knowledge and Power, p. 73.\n63 Rouse (1987a), Knowledge and Power, p. 73.\n64 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 149 [114]. 2. A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 85\nlaboratory practices. For him, the laboratory is the principal site where\nthings \u2018show up\u2019 in the sciences.\nThere is, however, a tension in Rouse\u2019s reading of Heidegger, a\ntension which does not exist in Heidegger\u2019s own work. On the one hand,\nRouse is concerned with the conditions which make it possible for a thing\nto \u2018show up at all.\u2019 On the other hand, he describes those conditions as\ninterpretive conditions, that is, as the social and behavioural conditions\nwhich enable a community to successfully interpret a thing. The tension\nis this. The conditions enabling something to \u2018show up at all\u2019 would\nseem to be existence conditions, that is, the conditions which enable a\nthing to exist at all. This is indeed how Rouse often presents them. Yet,\nconditions of existence are not the same as conditions of interpretation,\nfor it seems clear that a thing must exist before it can be interpreted.\nInterpretation thus presupposes existence. Hence, to run existence\nand interpretation together, as Rouse does, is to court conceptual\nincoherence.\nRouse attempts to resolve this conflict, and so to escape the threat of\nincoherence, by assimilating existence to meaning. He writes that \u2018there\nis no fact of the matter about whether things that cannot intelligibly\nbe encountered within a meaningful world exist or do not exist.\u201965 And\nhe endorses the \u2018invocation of meaning as the arbiter of [\u2026] existence\nconditions for things.\u201966 On this view, existence presupposes meaning.\nHence, Rouse reverses the apparently common-sense claim that\ninterpretation presupposes existence. For him, interpretation does not\npresuppose existence, it presupposes meaning. And meaning is, in his\nview, the condition of possibility for existence.\nThis position may allow Rouse to dodge the charge of incoherence,\nbut at what cost? The claim that meaning precedes existence would seem\nto contradict common sense. Moreover, by making existence dependent\non interpretation, Rouse effectively abandons the core realist doctrine\nof independent existence. Existence now means existence relative to\nan interpretive community. It must also be noted that Rouse\u2019s position\nfails to reflect Heidegger\u2019s own view of these matters. Indeed, as this\nchapter has already demonstrated, Heidegger offers a different way\nof resolving the conflict. Contrary to what Rouse claims, Heidegger\u2019s\n65 Rouse (1987a), Knowledge and Power, p. 160.\n66 Rouse (1987a), Knowledge and Power, p. 162. 86 Science as Social Existence\nhermeneutics of the subject is not driven by the question of how things\nshow up at all, but rather by the question of how things show up as what\nthey are. A key aspect of Heidegger\u2019s position, overlooked by Rouse, is\nhis distinction between the that-being and what-being of a thing, that\nis, between its existence and its essence. Rouse is partly right that,\nfor Heidegger, the being of a thing depends on its being meaningful,\nbecause Heidegger does argue that the what-being, or essence, of a thing\ndepends on its being either practically or theoretically interpreted by a\nself-adjudicating community. But the that-being of the thing does not\ndepend on its being so interpreted. A thing may exist without meaning\nanything at all, without being intelligible for a community.\nAlthough Rouse shows no awareness of Heidegger\u2019s distinction\nbetween existence and essence, he does recognise that Heidegger\u2019s\nwork includes elements which resist the use to which Rouse would like\nto put it. Principal among these is Heidegger\u2019s concept of \u2018change-over,\u2019\nwhich, as discussed earlier in this chapter, describes the transformation\nin understanding of a thing from its being ready-to-hand to its being\npresent-at-hand within-the-world. According to Rouse, the concept\nof change-over marks Heidegger\u2019s vestigial attachment to a theory-\ndominant account of the scientific enterprise. He thus rejects it as a\nretrograde move betraying Heidegger\u2019s otherwise laudable commitment\nto a practical hermeneutics of science which gives pride of place to\nmaterial practice.67 Indeed, according to Rouse, \u2018the theory-dominant\nperspective that Heidegger still retains [\u2026] reduces experiment to\na merely incidental practice in science.\u201968 Even though Heidegger, as\nwe saw above, offers some examples of the material practice of science,\nRouse dismisses these as \u2018research practices that are only associated\nwith theoretical cognition\u2019 rather than being constitutive of it.69 He thus\nconcludes that, on Heidegger\u2019s allegedly retrograde account, material\n67 Rouse (1987a), Knowledge and Power, p. 74.\n68 Rouse (1987a), Knowledge and Power, p. 79.\n69 Rouse (1987a), Knowledge and Power, p. 76. I criticises this statement in more detail in\nKochan (2011a), \u2018Getting Real with Rouse and Heidegger,\u2019 p. 105. Denis McManus\nalso challenges the veracity of Rouse\u2019s statement (Denis McManus (2012), Heidegger\nand the Measure of Truth: Themes from his Early Philosophy (Oxford: Oxford University\nPress), p. 66 n. 60). Elsewhere, McManus has also carefully examined the complex\nrelationship between the \u2018theoretical\u2019 and the \u2018practical\u2019 in Heidegger\u2019s early work\n(Denis McManus (2007), \u2018Heidegger, Measurement and the \u201cIntelligibility\u201d of\nScience,\u2019 European Journal of Philosophy 15(1), 82\u2013105). 2. A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 87\npractice \u2018neither has \u201ca life of its own\u201d apart from theory nor makes a\ndistinctive cognitive contribution.\u201970\nRouse views this alleged circumstance not only as an affront\nto his practical hermeneutics of science, he also asserts that the\nphenomenological concept of the change-over, which is meant to\nprovide existential grounds for Heidegger\u2019s account of scientific theory,\nis unpersuasive. He has repeated this assertion several times over many\nyears: \u2018Heidegger never does indicate what makes for this sudden leap\nto a new way of looking at things\u2019; \u2018Heidegger is disturbingly vague\nabout how this changeover can occur\u2019; \u2018Heidegger does not describe how\nthe practical tasks of science (experiment, instrumental manipulation,\ntheoretical problem solving and calculation) are connected to the\ndisclosure of things as present-at-hand\u2019; \u2018Heidegger merely asserted\nsuch a changeover without an adequate phenomenological description\nof how it occurred\u2019; \u2018Heidegger merely asserted such a changeover\nwithout adequately describing it.\u201971 The problem with this repeated\nassertion is that Rouse has never developed it into a proper argument\nexplaining why Heidegger\u2019s in fact not insignificant description of\nthe change-over fails to meet Rouse\u2019s own standards of adequacy.72 In\nfact, it turns out that Rouse\u2019s standards are ill-suited for measuring\n70 Rouse (1987a), Knowledge and Power, p. 98.\n71 J oseph Rouse (1985), \u2018Science and the Theoretical \u201cDiscovery\u201d of the Present-at-\nHand,\u2019 in Descriptions, ed. by Don Ihde and Hugh J.

But once this happens, the ordinary functional contextuality of\nthings gets replaced by the \u201cmathematical projection of Nature.\u201d\u201973 The\nstandard of adequacy which Heidegger fails to meet thus demands an\nexplanation of how a breakdown in our immersed involvement with a\nready-to-hand nature can change over to a mathematical projection of a\npresent-at-hand nature, a \u2018decontextualised theorising\u2019 which allegedly\neliminates the ontological significance of material practice in the\nsciences. According to Rouse, Heidegger identifies the mathematical\nprojection of nature with a decontextualised theorising and claims that\n\u2018[w]hen we understand theorizing, we have understood what is essential\nabout science.\u201974 Rouse\u2019s Heidegger thus defines science as a theory-\ndriven mathematical projection of nature in which thing show up as\nfully decontextualised and present-at-hand.\nIn his reading of Heidegger, Rouse appears to take for granted a\nfundamental distinction between theory and practice, an assumption he\nshares with more orthodox philosophers of science. However, whereas\nthese philosophers usually seek to reduce the epistemic significance\nof practice to that of theory, Rouse argues for the reverse: he wants to\nreduce theory to practice. Furthermore, because he detects a resistance\nto his preferred direction of reduction in Heidegger\u2019s work, Rouse\nassumes that Heidegger must then belong to the orthodox camp, that he\nmust be intent on reducing practice to theory. But there is an alternative\npossibility: namely, that Heidegger does not accept the distinction\nbetween theory and practice as a fundamental one. That Rouse has\nfoisted a foreign distinction onto Heidegger is evinced by his elision\nof Heidegger\u2019s concept of the mathematical projection of nature with a\ntheoretical stance towards nature. Because Heidegger seeks to explain\nscience in terms of the mathematical projection, Rouse concludes that\nhe must also be seeking to explain science reductively in terms of theory.\n73 Rouse (1987a), Knowledge and Power, p. 75.\n74 Rouse (1987a), Knowledge and Power, p. 96. 2. A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 89\nBut Heidegger does not hold the distinction between theory\nand practice to be a fundamental one, and he does not identify the\nmathematical projection of nature with theory. In fact, as already\ndiscussed, Heidegger argues that the mathematical projection\nprovides the existential condition of possibility for both scientific\ntheory and practice. The distinction between the two is therefore not\nfundamental, but instead derives from their shared existential basis in\nthe mathematical projection of nature. They are, so to speak, two sides\nof the same existential coin.75\nRouse\u2019s misunderstanding on this point appears to have arisen from\nhis failure to recognise Heidegger\u2019s distinction between the existence\nand essence of a thing, and, more specifically, between a thing present-\nat-hand without-the-world and a thing present-at-hand within-the-\nworld. This is the distinction between a thing which exists, but is not\nintelligible, and a thing which exists and is also intelligible. Hence,\nwhen Heidegger writes that, in the mathematical projection, \u2018something\nconstantly present-at-hand (matter) is uncovered beforehand,\u2019 he\nmeans something present-at-hand in the first sense. When brute\nmatter is uncovered in this projection, our basic understanding is\ndirected towards \u2018those constitutive items in it which are quantitatively\ndeterminable (motion, force, location, and time).\u2019 The mathematical\nprojection thus serves as a basic template which directs us to experience\nan independently existing nature as something essentially amenable\nto quantitative analysis. Heidegger writes that \u2018[o]nly \u201cin the light\u201d of\na Nature which has been projected in this fashion can anything like a\n\u201cfact\u201d be found and set up for an experiment regulated and delimited\nin terms of this projection.\u201976 Hence, the mathematical projection is\na condition of possibility for the scientific experiment as such. The\nreadiness-to-hand of things in experimental practice presupposes\nthe essential measurability of physical phenomena. Moreover, when\nthere is a change-over in understanding, and those same ready-to-\nhand things become thematised as present-at-hand objects within an\n75 Robert Crease also notes Rouse\u2019s failure to understand Heidegger on this point: \u2018In\neffect, what Rouse has done is taken the traditional priority of theory over praxis\nand stood it on its head, when what is needed is a rethinking of that relation\u2019 (Robert\nP. Crease (1993), The Play of Nature: Experimentation as Performance (Bloomington:\nIndiana University Press), p. 193 n. 43).\n76 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 414 [362]. 90 Science as Social Existence\nexperimental work-world, their essential determination as measurable\ndoes not change, but rather becomes articulated as the subject matter\nfor theoretical representation. Hence, the mathematical projection is\nlikewise a condition of possibility for theory as such.\nThe change-over thus marks a shift in experience within the range\nof possible understandings of nature opened up by the mathematical\nprojection. The thing with which we were working now becomes a thing\nabout which we concern ourselves. It shifts from being a resource for\nour activity to being the topic of our activity. This is, as we have seen,\na process of objectification. Heidegger writes that the \u2018Being which\nObjectifies and which is alongside the present-at-hand within-the-\nworld, is characterized by a distinctive kind of making-present.\u201977 With this,\nHeidegger makes it clear that, whereas the mathematical projection\ncorrelates with independently existing nature \u2014 present-at-hand\nwithout-the-world \u2014 the objectifying, or thematising, process enabled\nby that projection, and which itself enables theory, correlates with things\npresent-at-hand within-the-world. It is this crucial distinction which\nRouse has failed to recognise. He mistakenly identifies the mathematical\nprojection of nature with the scientific theorising which it enables,\nbecause he has not spotted the distinction Heidegger draws between a\nthing present-at-hand without-the-world and a thing present-at-hand\nwithin-the-world. He thus identifies the former with the latter, and\nthereby eliminates the conceptual space Heidegger had deliberately left\nopen in his existential account of science for an independently existing\nnature.\nAs we have seen, Rouse assimilates existence to meaning in order\nto avoid the threat of incoherence facing his practical hermeneutics of\nscience. He argues that interpretation is constitutive of existence, and\nthus rejects the common-sense belief that interpretation presupposes the\nexistence of the thing interpreted. Giving up this common-sense belief\nis the price Rouse pays to protect his hermeneutics of scientific practice.\nYet, as we have also seen, Heidegger allows for an alternative to Rouse\u2019s\npractical hermeneutics which does not sacrifice this belief, and which\nthus preserves the core realist doctrine of independent existence. But\nthere is also a further reason to prefer Heidegger\u2019s account. It seems that\n77 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 414 [363]. 2. A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 91\nRouse\u2019s commitment to an abstract theory of universal hermeneutics\nhas led him to ignore the concrete evidence which plays against that\nsame theory. Indeed, this evidence can be found even in Rouse\u2019s own\npractice. His theoretical commitments conflict with the basic norms\nof intelligibility governing the very language he uses to articulate\nhis theory. Avoided in theory, the threat of incoherence nevertheless\nre-emerges in practice.\nRouse\u2019s theoretical conviction that existence presupposes\ninterpretation is clearly expressed in the following statement: \u2018what\nexists depends on the field of meaningful interaction and interpretation\nwithin which things can be encountered.\u201978 Here, Rouse argues that\ninterpretation is the condition of possibility for existence. A thing can\nonly exist \u2014 can only \u2018show up at all\u2019 \u2014 within a field of meaning and\ninterpretive practice. The relation of a thing to an interpretative practice\nis thus one of existential dependency. Yet Rouse immediately betrays\nthis theoretical conviction in another statement, which only makes\ninterpretation the condition of a thing\u2019s being present in a particular\nway: \u2018the possible ways a thing can be depends on the configuration of\npractices within which they become manifest.\u201979 Now the configuration\nof practices, which are for Rouse constitutive of meaning, is no longer\nthe condition of possibility for a thing\u2019s existence, as such, but instead\nfor the range of possible ways in which it may show up as what it is.\nRouse\u2019s emphasis has subtly shifted from identifying meaning with the\nthat-being of a thing to identifying it with the what-being of that thing.\nThe question being answered is no longer one of how things show up at\nall, but instead of how things show up as the bearers of the properties\nwhich manifest their essence, their way of being. This question is the\nsame one as asked by Heidegger, and it can be answered without\nassimilating existence to meaning, and hence without threatening the\ndoctrine of independent existence. This, I would suggest, is a more\ncommon-sense way of speaking about the relation between meaning\nand existence. Indeed, it is a way of speaking about that relation which\nnatural language powerfully compels us to adopt, and so it is not\nsurprising that Rouse quietly slides back into it.\n78 Rouse (1987a), Knowledge and Power, p. 160.\n79 Rouse (1987a), Knowledge and Power, p. 160\u201361. 92 Science as Social Existence\nRouse nevertheless insists on tacking close to his theoretical\ncommitments with the further claim that\n[b]elonging to the realm of possible determinations open within our\npractices is constitutive of a thing\u2019s being a thing at all. But this claim\nis just to say that having determinate properties, and interacting with\nother things in ways we must take account of, is a necessary condition\nfor a thing to be.80\nRouse admits that \u2018[t]his point is difficult to recognise,\u2019 but suggests\nthat it can be made clear with an example of a case where \u2018thinghood\u2019\nis in question.81 He offers an example from the history of laboratory\npractice in biochemistry.\nThe case involves what biochemists eventually came to recognise as\nthyrotropin releasing hormone, or TRH.82 Rouse writes that the name\n\u2018TRH\u2019 was originally used to designate \u2018whatever was physiologically\nactive [\u2026] in certain chromatographically isolated fractions of the\nhypothalami of sheep or pigs.\u2019 He notes that, at that early stage,\nbiochemists did not know if TRH denoted \u2018a thing rather than an unstable\nartifact.\u2019 According to Rouse, the difference between an unstable\nartefact and a thing is that a chemical structure can be attributed to the\nlatter. Once biochemists succeeded in attributing a chemical structure to\nwhat Rouse also refers to as \u2018the stuff in the fractions,\u2019 that stuff was no\nlonger an unstable artefact but manifest itself as a genuine \u2018substance.\u2019\nHence, Rouse distinguishes between an \u2018unstable artifact\u2019 and \u2018stuff,\u2019 on\nthe one hand, and a \u2018thing\u2019 and a \u2018substance\u2019 on the other, arguing that\nonly the latter can be properly recognised as candidates for existence.\nWhat he refers to as \u2018the complex of practices that had developed over\na hundred years of biochemistry\u2019 comprises the existence conditions\nfor the thing called TRH. For Rouse, the \u2018crucial point\u2019 is this: \u2018not to\nshow up in the ways that allow something to count as an x (in this\ncase, as a chemical substance) is not to be a thing at all.\u2019 Yet it then\nbecomes something of a puzzle what the terms \u2018unstable artifact\u2019 and\n\u2018stuff\u2019 are meant to refer to if not to something which exists. It would\nseem more coherent to say that the terms refer to a thing about which\nwe can say that it is but not what it is, because what it is has not yet\n80 Rouse (1987a), Knowledge and Power, p. 163.\n81 Rouse (1987a), Knowledge and Power, p. 163\n82 Rouse (1987a), Knowledge and Power, p. 163f. 2. A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 93\nbeen determined by the biochemists treating it as the subject matter for\ntheir investigation. It is thus not the existence of the thing which is in\nquestion, but its determinate properties. Contrary to what Rouse claims,\nthe determination of those properties is not constitutive of that thing\u2019s\nbeing a thing at all, but rather of its being an object, a property-bearing\nsubstance, a thing present-at-hand within-the-world.\nIn this case, then, Heidegger\u2019s distinction between existence and\nessence provides a better resource for explaining what transpired than\ndoes Rouse\u2019s theoretical commitment to unfolding configurations\nof interpretive practice. On top of that, Heidegger\u2019s more moderate\nposition also allows us to comfortably accommodate the core realist\ndoctrine of independent existence. The threat posed to minimal realism\nby Rouse\u2019s practical hermeneutics of science has thus been defused.\nA practical hermeneutics of science will reveal its full worth only\nwithin the constraints of a phenomenology of scientific practice which\nrecognises the independent existence of nature.\n6. Minimal Realism and Scientific Practice\nRouse\u2019s critique of Heidegger\u2019s existential account of science attempts to\nseparate the social constructivist elements in Heidegger\u2019s hermeneutics\nof subjectivity from the phenomenological elements supporting\nhis minimal realism. Rouse adopted Heidegger\u2019s description of\nthe subject in terms of \u2018socially and behaviorally self-adjudicating\ninterpreters\u2019 \u2014 what Heidegger called the subject\u2019s elemental being-\nwith-others \u2014 but failed to follow him in also accepting the doctrine\nof independent existence. This position was based on the reading of\nHeidegger which Rouse presented in his 1987 book, Knowledge and\nPower. Since the appearance of that book, however, Rouse has distanced\nhimself not only from realism, but also from social constructivism, and\nespecially from SSK. Indeed, he has more recently argued that \u2018[s]ocial\nconstructivism and realism are [\u2026] vampires, the philosophical undead\nthat still haunt our concepts and interpretations of nature, culture,\nand science.\u201983 This chapter has already detected minimal life-signs in\nrealism, enough to still count it among the living. In what follows, I will\n83 Joseph Rouse (2002a), \u2018Vampires: Social Constructivism, Realism, and Other\nPhilosophical Undead,\u2019 History and Theory 41, 60\u201378 (p. 63). 94 Science as Social Existence\nlikewise argue that Rouse\u2019s report of the death of SSK is also greatly\nexaggerated.\nRouse\u2019s criticism of the social constructivist view of science is\nstrikingly similar to his criticism of Heidegger\u2019s existential account of\nscience. As he did with Heidegger, Rouse also charges SSK practitioners\nwith espousing a theory-dominated view of science. From Rouse\u2019s\nperspective, then, SSK poses a threat to his practice-based philosophy\nof science. As we will see, SSK does indeed pose such a threat, not\nbecause it is theory-dominated (it need not be), but because it insists\nthat scientific practices can be usefully studied in sociological terms.\nA key entry point for Rouse in his critique of SSK is Richard Rorty\u2019s\nclaim that \u2018[n]atural science [is not] a natural kind.\u201984 According to Rouse,\nnatural science is not a natural kind because the products and norms of\nscientific investigation are historically variant, and also vary both across\nand within scientific disciplines. In other words, Rouse rejects the claim\nthat there is \u2018an essence of science or a single essential aim to which\nall genuinely scientific work must aspire.\u201985 The specific problem with\nSSK, he writes, is its insensitivity to the heterogeneity of the sciences.\nSSK practitioners act on the \u2018mistaken assumption [\u2026] that scientific\nknowledge belongs to a single kind similar or distinguishable in kind in\nany interesting way from other kinds.\u201986\nRorty\u2019s argument that natural science is not a natural kind was meant\nto undercut essentialist solutions to the demarcation problem, that is,\nthe problem of distinguishing genuine science from pseudoscience,\nastronomy from astrology, for example. The argument thus carries no\nweight against SSK, which holds that knowledge, as such, is a social\nand historical phenomenon and so any criterion demarcating scientific\nfrom other kinds of knowledge must itself be socially and historically\ncontingent rather than essential. Indeed, Barnes, Bloor, and Henry write\nthat \u2018demarcation criteria must be regarded as conventional, and their\napplication in all cases as situated human action,\u2019 and they explicitly\n84 Joseph Rouse (1996a), Engaging Science: How to Understand Its Practices Philosophically\n(Ithaca: Cornell University Press), p. 243; brackets original. Cf. Richard Rorty (1991),\n\u2018Is Natural Science a Natural Kind?,\u2019 in Objectivity, Relativism, and Truth (Philosophical\nPapers, vol. 1), by Richard Rorty (Cambridge: University of Cambridge Press), pp.\n46\u201362.\n85 Rouse (1996a), Engaging Science, p. 242.\n86 Rouse (1996a), Engaging Science, p. 243. 2. A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 95\ntreat the pseudoscientific status of astrology from this non-essentialist\nperspective.87 Rouse\u2019s complaint seems to lie with the fact, not that SSK\npractitioners treat science as an essentially unique epistemic kind, but\nthat they treat it as a kind at all. What Rouse disapproves of is SSK\u2019s\nclaim that science is an epistemic kind which, like all other epistemic\nkinds, is amenable to sociological explanation: \u2018the vocabulary of\nsocial interaction (interests, negotiations, and so on) is supposed to\nhold the key to an adequate understanding of scientific work.\u201988 Rouse\nthus joins other critics in attributing to SSK the doctrine that sociology\n\u2018can (potentially) account fully for the epistemic outcomes of scientific\npractices.\u201989 And, along with those other critics, Rouse\u2019s attribution turns\nout, in crucial cases, to be a misattribution. For example, Rouse has David\nBloor claiming, first, that the same kinds of causal explanation should\nbe applied symmetrically to both true and false beliefs, and, second, that\n\u2018only sociological explanations could plausibly satisfy this demand.\u201990\nThe first attribution is correct, and the second incorrect. The \u2018kinds\u2019 of\ncausal explanation to be symmetrically applied may include sociological,\npsychological, biological, ecological, or any other naturalistic sort. As\nBloor states in the locus classicus of his position, \u2018[n]aturally there will\nbe other types of causes apart from social ones which will cooperate\nin bringing about belief.\u201991 The importance of sociological explanations\nattaches specifically to the normative conditions concerning belief\nformation, an issue central for understanding knowledge but certainly\nnot the only such issue. Contrary to what Rouse alleges, then, social\nconstructivists do not all claim that sociological explanation can account\n\u2018fully\u2019 for the epistemic outcomes of scientific practice. Some, like Bloor,\nargue only that a complete explanatory account of science must include\nsociological elements. Such elements are necessary, but not sufficient,\nfor an explanation of science.\nAn initially more plausible criticism is Rouse\u2019s claim that SSK\npractitioners treat science as a \u2018theoretically coherent domain,\u2019 and\n\u2018mistakenly take the unity and theoretical integrity of \u201cscientific\n87 Barnes, Bloor and Henry (1996), Scientific Knowledge, pp. 142, 141.\n88 Rouse (1996a), Engaging Science, p. 244.\n89 Rouse (1996a), Engaging Science, p. 244; emphasis added.\n90 Rouse (1996a), Engaging Science, p. 9.\n91 David Bloor (1991), Knowledge and Social Imagery, 2nd edn (Chicago: University of\nChicago Press), p. 7. 96 Science as Social Existence\nknowledge\u201d for granted.\u201992 This is the charge, mentioned above, that SSK\npractitioners deploy a theory-dominant view of science. It may well be\nthat this criticism applies to some social constructivists. As before, I will\nhere concentrate on crucial exceptions among proponents of SSK.\nBarry Barnes has written that a \u2018theory is a cluster of accepted\nconcrete applications.\u201993 This looks like a definition of theory in terms\nof practice. The concrete applications Barnes refers to are \u2018problem\nsolutions\u2019: \u2018particular concrete scientific achievement[s].\u201994 Barnes,\nappropriating Kuhn, also calls them \u2018paradigms,\u2019 and writes that the\n\u2018most satisfactory way of describing scientific knowledge is simply\nas a repertoire of paradigms.\u2019 He furthermore argues that \u2018[t]o speak\ninstead of an abstract pattern of concepts and beliefs, or statements, can\nbe seriously misleading.\u201995 Nevertheless, Barnes goes on to do just that,\nalbeit with clear qualification. He writes:\nIt is always possible to reify the verbal component of a culture as a\nconceptual fabric, a structure made up of generalisations which connect\nconcepts into a single integrated whole. It is true that something is lost\nby reducing linguistic activity to an abstract verbal pattern in this way.\nBut the reification is irresistibly convenient, and harmless enough if its\nlimitations are constantly borne in mind.96\nIt would be tedious to trawl through the works of Barnes and his SSK\ncolleagues with the goal of judging whether they have \u2018constantly\nborne in mind\u2019 the limitations of this methodologically motivated\nreification. Suffice it to say here that Barnes\u2019s comments cast serious\ndoubt on Rouse\u2019s blanket allegation that SSK practitioners uncritically\nview scientific knowledge as an integrated theoretical whole. Yet, those\ncomments also suggest an explanation for how critics may come to\nthink otherwise. Just because a writer has constantly borne in mind\nthe limitations of their method, it need not follow that their readers are\n92 Joseph Rouse (2002b), How Scientific Practices Matter: Reclaiming Philosophical\nNaturalism (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), p. 144 n. 7; Joseph Rouse (1999),\n\u2018Understanding Scientific Practices: Cultural Studies of Science as a Philosophical\nProgram,\u2019 in The Science Studies Reader, ed. by Mario Biagioli (London: Routledge),\npp. 442\u201356 (p. 451).\n93 Barry Barnes (1982), T.

Kuhn and Social Science, p. 71. 2. A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 97\nalso constantly aware of, and hence manage to avoid, the incumbent\ndangers associated with the writer\u2019s own use of that method.\nThe problem is particularly acute in the case of Rouse\u2019s interpretation\nof Harry Collins, who, as we saw in Chapter One, rejects a role for\nexternal-world realism in SSK. Using a passage from Collins and Steven\nYearley, Rouse tries to undermine the credibility of social constructivists\nby arguing that they reify, not just the practices of the natural sciences,\nbut also the very sociological concepts they themselves use to explain\nthe natural sciences. The passage in question reads: \u2018We provide\na prescription: stand on social things \u2014 be social realists \u2014 in order\nto explain natural things. The world is an agonistic field (to borrow\na phrase from Latour); others will be standing on natural things to\nexplain social things.\u201997 For Rouse, by distinguishing between \u2018social\nthings\u2019 and \u2018natural things,\u2019 and then setting the two in opposition,\nCollins and Yearley erroneously \u2018presume the unity of each\u2019 when those\nunities, as well as their opposition, should better have been the subject\nof critical deconstruction.98 He furthermore characterises the passage as\n\u2018presum[ing] that the social \u201cworld\u201d and the natural \u201cworld\u201d constitute\nrelatively autonomous domains whose articulated descriptions then\nneed to be brought into an appropriate relation to one another.\u201999 As\na consequence of this interpretation, we are now suddenly confronted\nwith a version of the traditional epistemological problem, encountered\nin Chapter One, of how the world of the knower or knowers \u2014 the world\nof the subject \u2014 makes contact with the world of the knowable \u2014 the\nworld of the object. Indeed, Rouse suggests that SSK practitioners\nharbour a \u2018vestigial commitment to epistemology.\u2019100\nRouse is making two good points here, but if they are to be properly\nappreciated they must be separated from the misleading aspects of\nhis argument. To that end, it is important to understand the broader\ncontext from out of which Rouse has plucked the above passage from\n97 Rouse (1996a), Engaging Science, pp. 244\u201345. Cf. Harry M. Collins and Steven\nYearley (1992), \u2018Journey into Space,\u2019 in Science as Practice and Culture, ed. by Andrew\nPickering (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), pp. 369\u201389 (pp. 382\u201383).\n98 Rouse (1996a), Engaging Science, p. 245.\n99 Rouse (2002b), How Scientific Practices Matter, p. 136. A version of this criticism of SSK\nis repeated in Joseph Rouse (2015), Articulating the World: Conceptual Understanding\nand the Scientific Image (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), p. 323.\n100 Rouse (2002b), How Scientific Practices Matter, p. 134. 98 Science as Social Existence\nCollins and Yearley. The two sentences immediately preceding it state:\n\u2018Our world is populated, we admit it, by philosophically insecure\nobjects, such as states of society and participant\u2019s comprehension. But\nall worlds are built on shifting sands.\u2019 The third sentence following the\npassage states: \u2018We see the attractiveness of the idea of a comprehensive\ntheory, but in its absence, life, although imperfect, is interesting.\u2019101 On\nthis basis, Collins and Yearley can hardly be charged with an uncritical\nreification of the world into distinct and autonomous social and\nnatural domains. Their appeal to the concept of \u2018social reality\u2019 is, as\nthey clearly state in the passage quoted by Rouse, a \u2018prescription,\u2019 and\nthey furthermore emphasise that this is an \u2018insecure\u2019 methodological\nrecommendation made in full consciousness of the \u2018shifting sands\u2019 on\nwhich it rests. In further contrast to Rouse\u2019s claims about SSK, Collins\nand Yearley also clearly disavow the idea of a comprehensive theory,\nchoosing instead to proceed imperfectly over shifting sands in a world\nwhich they nevertheless take to be of unceasing interest. This choice\nresonates with Barnes\u2019s own admission that the reification of concrete\npractices as an abstract conceptual fabric is irresistibly convenient from\na methodological perspective, and harmless enough if its limitations are\nconstantly borne in mind. Collins and Yearley explicitly acknowledge\nthose limitations, and Rouse is wrong to suggest otherwise.102\nOn the other hand, Rouse is right to find some reason for worry here.\nWith this we come to the first of his two good points. Rouse worries that\nSSK practitioners, by using particular social categories as resources in\ntheir explanations of science, will forego the opportunity to topicalise\nthe contingencies of those resources. Within those contingencies, he\nfears, there may lie unresolved political tensions. There is no doubt that\nthis is a genuine worry, and that the potential problems it responds to\ncan be very great. There is, however, also no doubt that Barnes can be\neasily read as expressing this worry when he warns us of the limitations\nwhich accompany reification. There is also no doubt that the same\nworry may be fairly read into Collins and Yearley\u2019s observation that\nstates of society and participant\u2019s comprehension are philosophically\n101 Collins and Yearley (1992), \u2018Journey into Space,\u2019 p. 382.\n102 Carol Steiner describes this passage from Collins and Yearley as an \u2018echo\u2019 of\nHeidegger\u2019s existential conception of science (Steiner (1999), \u2018Constructive Science\nand Technology Studies,\u2019 p. 602). 2. A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 99\ninsecure. There thus appears to be little genuine disagreement between\nRouse and SSK on this point. Accordingly, SSK practitioners should\nnot object to having their explanatory resources topicalised and the\nsocial and historical contingencies of those resources exposed. They\nmay sometimes find themselves surprised or even embarrassed in the\nprocess, but they will recognise such outcomes as consistent with their\nown methodology and so should accept them as contributions to the\ngreater good. However, SSK practitioners may well object to being told\nby critics that they must perform this act directly on themselves if they\nwish to maintain the credibility of their field. For they will rightly suspect\nthat this demand, when pushed too far, surreptitiously threatens the\nvery possibility of their practice. As Bloor has observed: \u2018Nobody can\nturn every resource into a topic without finishing up with topics which\nthey have no resources for tackling.\u2019103 If all the explanatory resources\nof SSK must be turned into topics before the critic will be satisfied, then\nclearly the critic\u2019s satisfaction depends on sociological explanation\nfinally becoming impossible. It is hard to believe that Rouse would\nseriously want to place such a strong demand on SSK practitioners, not\nleast because the same demand could easily be turned against his own\nattempt to explain science in terms of \u2018practice,\u2019 \u2018meaning,\u2019 and \u2018being,\u2019\ncategories the legitimacy of which he apparently takes for granted. For\nexample, as we saw in the last section, Rouse neglects the distinction\nbetween essence and existence, which was prompted by Heidegger\u2019s\n\u2018question of being,\u2019 and so he mistakenly takes the assimilation of\nessence to meaning to also encompass existence. The point is thus a\nperfectly general one, applying to any explanatory enterprise, including\nRouse\u2019s own practical hermeneutics.104\nLet us turn now to Rouse\u2019s second good point. He argues that SSK\npractitioners still harbour a vestigial commitment to epistemology,\nand especially to an underlying presupposition that the problem of\nknowledge is one of explaining how a subject may acquire knowledge of\n103 David Bloor (1999a), \u2018Anti-Latour,\u2019 Studies in History and Philosophy of Science 30(1),\n81\u2013112 (p. 92).\n104 Rouse has more recently defended himself against this very kind of criticism,\narguing that his method \u2018must proceed from \u201cin the thick of the human situation.\u201d\u2019\nHence: \u2018It is one thing to look at particular social practices [\u2026] with \u201cthe cold eye\nof a stranger\u201d; [\u2026] It is another thing altogether to try doing so for social practices\n[\u2026] generally\u2019 (Rouse (2015), Articulating the World, p. 168). 100 Science as Social Existence\nan independently existing external object. I naturally recognise this point\nas a good one, since I introduced it myself in Chapter One. I represented\nthe problem with the glass-bulb model. Unlike Rouse, however, I view\nthis problem as an opportunity, not to banish SSK practitioners into\nthe wasteland of the philosophical undead, but to invite them into the\nverdant valley of existential phenomenology.\nI have argued that the intelligibility of external-world scepticism\ndepends on a prior, often tacit, acceptance of the glass-bulb model.\nTo recognise external-world scepticism as a genuine epistemological\nproblem, in need of some kind of solution, is to have already adopted an\nontological image of the subject as a discrete and worldless substance-\nsubject. I furthermore argued that SSK practitioners, despite their\nsometimes vigorous disagreements over how best to address this\nproblem, are agreed with respect to the existence and intelligibility\nof the problem. This is because they all subscribe, to some significant\ndegree or other, to the glass-bulb model which fuels that problem. I\nproposed not a solution, but a dissolution of this problem through\nthe replacement of the glass-bulb model with Heidegger\u2019s existential\nconcept of the subjectivity of the subject as being-in-the-world. Because\nbeing-in-the-world belongs to the basic existential structure of the\nsubject, we never need to face the problem of how it gains epistemic\naccess to that world. In my view, adopting Heidegger\u2019s concept adds\nphilosophical strength to SSK, without significantly compromising its\nmethodology or its goals. Indeed, as I have now argued in this chapter,\nthe proposed combination is even compatible with the minimalist\nrealism of many SSK practitioners because Heidegger, too, accepted\nthe core realist doctrine of independent existence. This combination\ncan succeed, in good part, because these social constructivists are able\nto accept, with dignity, Heidegger\u2019s claim that human existence is\nphenomenologically grounded in our immersed involvement with and\nalongside other entities in the world. Rouse is blind to the possibility of\nthis combination, because he misattributes a theory-dominated account\nof science to both Heidegger and SSK. In this and the previous section, I\nhave traced the errors in Rouse\u2019s interpretations, and hence shown that\nhis criticisms against both parties do not succeed. The road thus remains\nclear for my proposed combination of SSK and Heidegger\u2019s existential\nconception of science. Furthermore, I have argued that this proposal, 2. A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 101\nin contrast to Rouse\u2019s practical hermeneutics of science, can readily\naccommodate the core realist doctrine of independent existence. The\nproposed account provides the basis, in other words, for a minimally\nrealist social constructivism about science.\n7. Conclusion\nI ended the introductory section of this chapter by noting Ginev\u2019s criticism\nof Rouse for not having paid adequate attention to the existential basis,\nand especially the cognitive specificity, of science. Ginev\u2019s criticism was\ninspired by Heidegger\u2019s existential conception of science. We have now\nseen that the core of this conception is the mathematical projection of\nnature, a term Heidegger used to denote the existential conditions which\nmake science possible in both its practical and theoretical modalities. As\na consequence of this projection, an independently existing nature comes\nto be understood a priori as something receptive to quantitative analysis.\nGiven that the mathematical projection lies at the core of Heidegger\u2019s\nexistential conception of science, it is ironic that Ginev follows Rouse in\ntreating it as evidence for Heidegger\u2019s alleged dependency on a theory-\ndominant view of science. Indeed, Ginev even charges Heidegger with\n\u2018mathematical essentialism,\u2019 having apparently missed the point that\nHeidegger displaces the phenomenological priority of mathematical\nessence by explaining it in terms of the existential conditions which\nmake it possible.105 Heidegger\u2019s position might thus be better described\nas one of \u2018mathematical existentialism.\u2019\nAs we have seen, Rouse, too, criticises essentialist accounts of science,\ndrawing on Rorty\u2019s claim that \u2018natural science is not a natural kind\u2019\n105 Ginev (2011), Tenets of Cognitive Existentialism, p. 5. A more detailed criticism of\nGinev, and Rouse, on this point may be found in Kochan (2015a), \u2018Scientific\nPractice and Modes of Epistemic Existence.\u2019 In a response to this criticism, Ginev\nhas asserted that Heidegger never used existential conditions as an explanatory\nresource, and that his alleged mathematical essentialism was meant to be sui generis,\n\u2018untranslatable,\u2019 arising from \u2018something like a \u201cmysterious act\u201d\u2019 (Dimitri Ginev\n(2015), \u2018The Battle for Mathematical Existentialism and the War of the Heideggerian\nSuccession: Rejoinder to Kochan,\u2019 in Debating Cognitive Existentialism, ed. by Dimitri\nGinev (Leiden and Boston: Brill Rodopi), pp. 168\u201393 (p. 187). I disagree with Ginev,\nbut, if he were right, then I would readily admit to demystifying Heidegger\u2019s\nexistential conception of science so as to make it a more interesting and useful\nexplanatory resource for science studies scholars. 102 Science as Social Existence\nto do so. Rorty\u2019s concern was to block attempts to demarcate science\nfrom pseudoscience \u2014 astronomy from astrology, for example \u2014 by\nattributing to science an absolute and unique essence. I have argued that\nthis criticism fails when set against SSK practitioners, because they too\nreject the idea that science has an absolute essence. That is why they call\nthemselves social constructivists. Rouse tries, however, to further press\nthe case by criticising SSK for treating science as a \u2018kind\u2019 fully amenable\nto sociological explanation. I have shown that this argument is also not\nsuccessful. SSK practitioners only argue that sociological categories\nare necessary, not that they are sufficient, for a complete explanatory\naccount of science. In order to be sufficient, such an account may also\nhave to include psychological, biological, and physical categories, and\nit should also include a place for an independently existing nature. SSK\npractitioners are thus realists in this minimal sense.\nRouse\u2019s argument is also unsuccessful against Heidegger. He\nalleges that Heidegger propounded an essentialist account of science in\nterms of theory: the genesis of scientific objects can be fully explained\nby reference to a mathematically structured conceptual scheme. This\nargument fails, first, because Heidegger did not view science primarily\nas a conceptual scheme but instead as a form of existence, and, second,\nbecause Heidegger did not claim to fully explain the genesis of scientific\nobjects by reference to scientific modes of existence. Similar to SSK\npractitioners, Heidegger argued that these modes are responsible only\nfor the essence of objects, not for their existence. Hence, Heidegger is\nalso a realist in this minimal sense. Rouse misses this crucial moment\nin Heidegger\u2019s account of science, because he neglects Heidegger\u2019s\ndistinction between the what-being and that-being, the essence and\nexistence, of a thing.\nAs already mentioned, Ginev also criticises Rouse\u2019s effacement of\nthe cognitive specificity of science, that is, his tendency to uncritically\nassimilate science to the broader sphere of cultural life in which it is\nnecessarily embedded. This is the flip-side of the demarcation problem.\nGinev\u2019s worry is not that non-scientific practices will penetrate the\ncognitive boundaries of scientific culture, thereby corrupting that\nculture. His worry is rather that science will permeate out into the\nbroader culture, with the result that social life in general will become 2. A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 103\n\u2018totally instrumentalized.\u2019106 According to Ginev, this threat follows\nfrom Rouse\u2019s mistaken assumption that anti-essentialism about\nscience entails the rejection of its cognitive specificity. Yet, as Ginev\npoints out, one may distinguish between scientific and non-scientific\ncultures, without recourse to essentialism, by recognising the existential\nspecificity of scientific practice. The two spheres of culture are thus to\nbe distinguished in existentialist rather than essentialist terms.107 This\nmove mirrors Heidegger\u2019s own displacement of an essentialist account\nwith an existentialist account of science. It also mirrors Heidegger\u2019s\nidentification, in some of his later work, of modern science with\ninstrumental rationality. It is not clear, however, that this is an entirely\napt characterisation of modern scientific practice. In any case, it remains,\nfor present purposes, to consider how an account of the existential\nspecificity of science may play against the distinction Rouse attempts to\ndraw between SSK, on the one hand, and what he calls \u2018cultural studies\nof scientific knowledge,\u2019 on the other.108\nRouse includes feminist science studies within the realm of cultural\nstudies of scientific knowledge, and this will be our focus here. In\ncomparing feminist science studies with SSK, Rouse notes many\nimportant similarities between them, as well as some differences of both\na technical and a fundamental nature. The main technical difference is\nthat SSK practitioners have largely neglected issues of gender in their\nempirical and methodological work. This is true, and unfortunate. Yet,\nas Rouse argues, this neglect may only reflect an incomplete application\nof SSK\u2019s methods. In principle, that method may \u2018leave ample room for\na full appreciation of the significance of gender relations as a social\nexplanans for the content of scientific knowledge.\u2019109 Hence, Rouse\n106 Ginev (2005), \u2018Against the Politics of Postmodern Philosophy of Science,\u2019 p. 198;\nGinev (2011), The Tenets of Cognitive Existentialism, p. 102.\n107 Ginev (2005), \u2018Against the Politics of Postmodern Philosophy of Science,\u2019 p. 202;\nGinev (2011), The Tenets of Cognitive Existentialism, p. 108.\n108 Rouse (1993), \u2018What Are Cultural Studies of Scientific Knowledge?,\u2019 Configurations\n1(1), 57\u201394 (passim).\n109 Joseph Rouse (1996b), \u2018Feminism and the Social Construction of Scientific\nKnowledge,\u2019 in Feminism, Science, and the Philosophy of Science, ed. by L. H. Nelson\nand J. Nelson (Dordecht: Kluwer), pp. 195\u2013215 (p. 196). 104 Science as Social Existence\nmoves to bracket this difference, turning his attention instead to what\nhe considers the key fundamental difference between the two fields.\nThat difference hinges on Rouse\u2019s claim that SSK practitioners\npropound an \u2018epistemological\u2019 account of scientific knowledge. To view\nscience in this way means to treat it as a definite \u2018kind,\u2019 or object of study,\nwhich may be surveyed as a \u2018totality,\u2019 for example, as a coherent and\ndeterminate system of representations, a conceptual scheme.110 Hence,\nin distinguishing feminist science studies from SSK, Rouse writes that\n\u2018feminist scholars conceive of \u201cknowing\u201d as concretely situated, and\nas more interactive than representational. Knowledge is not merely\na propositional attitude (belief or acceptance) toward some ideal or\nabstracted propositional content, but a relationship between knower and\nknown.\u2019111 The nub of Rouse\u2019s argument, then, is his accusation that SSK\ntrades on a reified picture of science which abstracts it from the concrete\nlevel of situated interaction favoured by feminist science studies. As I\nhave argued in this chapter, this accusation flies wide of the mark. SSK\npractitioners may deliberately reify scientific practice in the interests of\nconvenience, but their core methodological commitment is to a picture\nof science as a heterogeneous and shifting field of interaction which is\nnevertheless amenable to sociological analysis. Rouse\u2019s attempt to drive\na substantive methodological wedge between feminist science studies\nand SSK is thus not successful. This is not to say that there do not remain\nimportant differences of orientation between these two fields, but these\ndifferences are of a technical rather than a fundamental nature. There\nis no reason, in principle, why the two fields cannot enter into greater\ncooperation with one another.\nIndeed, Rouse\u2019s analysis even suggests, perhaps unwittingly, that\nfeminist science studies, like SSK, is methodologically predisposed\ntowards the minimal realist position I have commended in this chapter.\nHe writes that \u2018[f]eminist science studies have [\u2026] often been explicitly\nconcerned with different ways in which knowers might interact with\nobjects of knowledge.\u2019112 Although Rouse means to distinguish feminist\n110 Joseph Rouse (1996b), \u2018Feminism and the Social Construction of Scientific\nKnowledge,\u2019 pp. 198, 199.\n111 Joseph Rouse (1996b), \u2018Feminism and the Social Construction of Scientific\nKnowledge,\u2019 p. 203.\n112 Joseph Rouse (1996b), \u2018Feminism and the Social Construction of Scientific\nKnowledge,\u2019 p. 204. 2. A Minimal Realism for Science Studies 105\nscience studies from SSK with this observation, he could, in fact, have\njust as well made it of SSK. As we will see in Chapter Three, it is with\nexplaining the difference between distinct ways of understanding\na commonly encountered nature that SSK practitioners have often\nconcerned themselves. Moreover, in a passage cited earlier in this\nchapter, Bloor writes that \u2018nature, in our ordinary way of thinking, is\nthe object of knowledge, the thing that is known, while science is the\nknowledge we have of it, our theories about it and our description of\nit.\u2019113 I have already critiqued Bloor\u2019s phrase \u2018object of knowledge,\u2019 and\nthose remarks could also be applied to the phrase \u2018objects of knowledge\u2019\nin the passage from Rouse. More to the point is that, in both passages,\nscience is presented as an activity distinct from, but directed towards, an\nindependently existing nature. When epistemic groups disagree in their\ntheoretical and practical attitudes towards nature, when they interact\nwith nature in different ways, we can make sense of this disagreement,\nin part, by looking to the existential differences present between their\ndistinct orientations towards nature. Such existential differences may\nbe located within the cultures of science, but they may also mark a\ndistinction between scientific and non-scientific cultural orientations\ntowards nature. As Ginev reminds us, all science may be cultural, but\nnot all culture is scientific. There would, of course, also be other ways\nof understanding such differences, ways which seek to prohibit all\nreference to an independently existing nature. As Rouse\u2019s own example\nillustrates, however, this kind of prohibition, while possible in theory, is\ndifficult to maintain in practice. It is really much easier to simply accept\nminimal realism as the norm for science studies, and then to get on with\none\u2019s research.\n113 Bloor (2004a), \u2018Sociology of Scientific Knowledge,\u2019 p. 942. 106 Science as Social Existence\nAppendix\nThis Appendix supplements footnote 3 (p. 55) in this chapter.\nIn addition to works by Joseph Rouse, Trish Glazebrook, and Dimitri\nGinev, discussed in this chapter, there are a significant number of other\nworks also addressing the topic of Heidegger and realism.

Chapter Three\nFinitude, Humility, and the\nBloor-Latour Debate\n1. Introduction\nCommenting on the minimal realism outlined in Chapter Two, some\npeople have said that they find it very \u2018Kantian,\u2019 and expressed worry\nthat it may be vulnerable to the dreaded Kantian \u2018two-world problem.\u2019\nMinimal realism can indeed be justifiably described as \u2018Kantian,\u2019 but\nonly in a highly qualified sense. In this chapter, I will present a detailed\naccount of those qualifications. I will also defend minimal realism\nagainst the charge that it is vulnerable to the two-world problem. This\ndefence will unfold as an intervention into the spirited 1999 debate\nbetween David Bloor and Bruno Latour, a debate which may well be\none of the most dramatic dust-ups in the short history of science studies.\nThe two-world problem was, I will argue, a central point around which\nthis debate turned.\nThe two-world problem rests on the idea that there is, on the one\nhand, a world of appearance, and, on the other hand, a real world\nwhich underlies that appearance. The problem is enlivened by the\nfurther idea, attributed to Kant, that all we can know are appearances,\nthat the real world underlying those appearances is something about\n\u00a9 Jeff Kochan, CC BY 4.0 http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0129.03 112 Science as Social Existence\nwhich we can know nothing. The problem is: if we have no knowledge\nof the real world, then how can we know that it exists? The two-world\nproblem is thus a version of the sceptical problem about the existence\nof the external world, to which we gave detailed attention in Chapter\nOne. The Kantian version of this problem is usually articulated in\nterms of two distinct kinds of object, \u2018phenomena\u2019 and \u2018noumena.\u2019\nThe phenomena are the appearances, the things we can know. The\nnoumena are the real things which underlie those appearances, the\nthings we cannot know. Kant called a noumenon, the real thing about\nwhich we can know nothing, the \u2018thing-in-itself.\u2019 The problem thus\nbecomes: if we cannot know anything about the thing-in-itself, then\nhow can we know that it exists?\nIn Chapter One, I argued that external-world scepticism relies on a\ntacit acceptance of the glass-bulb model. The subject is trapped inside\na glass bulb, and must find a way to burst through the barrier, thereby\ngaining access to the external world. We can now see that the glass-\nbulb model similarly grounds the two-world problem. Phenomena lie\ninside the bulb; things-in-themselves lie outside of it. How do we break\nout of the bulb, pushing past phenomenal appearances and grabbing\nhold of the thing-in-itself? How, indeed, when we have already been\ntold that the thing-in-itself is something of which we can never grab\nhold, something which we can never know? One begins to wonder\nwhat the point ever was of positing the existence of the thing-in-itself. It\nseems like an idle wheel, spinning uselessly in imaginary space, never\nconnecting with anything important or real.\nBut this is the wrong way to think about the thing-in-itself. The\nthing-in-itself is not a figment of philosophical imagination. It is real,\nand it does indeed connect with other things. In her commentary on\nKant, Rae Langton has argued this point with clarity and force. The next\nsection will summarise the most important parts of her argument. In a\nnutshell, there are not two worlds in Kant, but only one; so there are not\ntwo distinct kinds of object, but only one. As Langton reads Kant, this\nsingle object can be known in two different ways: either imperfectly,\nby humans, or absolutely, by God. The thing-in-itself is the object as\nit can be known only by God. It marks the limits of human epistemic\npower. For Langton, then, the thing-in-itself signifies the fact of our own\ninherent finitude vis-\u00e0-vis an infinitely powerful God. She suggests that, 3. Finitude, Humility, and the Bloor-Latour Debate 113\nfor Kant, the appropriate response to this fact of human finitude was to\nadopt an attitude of epistemic humility.\nLangton\u2019s commentary provides a nice entry point into the Bloor-\nLatour debate. Latour first paints practitioners of the sociology of\nscientific knowledge (SSK) as beholden to a Kantian concept of the\nthing-in-itself, then sets this image up in terms of the two-world\nproblem, and finally submits SSK to what are, at root, standard sceptical\ncriticisms. Bloor attempts to deflect Latour\u2019s criticisms by arguing that\nacceptance of the concept of the thing-in-itself need not entail a further\ncommitment to the two-world thesis. In making this argument, Bloor\nmoves his account of the thing-in-itself closer to the one-world thesis,\ntransforming Kant\u2019s transcendental and individualistic account into a\nnaturalistic and sociological one. This naturalistic strategy leads to a\npotential problem, however, as Langton\u2019s commentary necessarily ties\nthe concept of the thing-in-itself to the existence of a transcendent God,\na supernatural and omniscient knower. Here Heidegger can come to\nBloor\u2019s aid. In fact, Heidegger had much to say about the Kantian thing-\nin-itself, and he also firmly rejected the two-world thesis. However, in\ncontrast to Langton, he conceptualised human finitude, not against the\nimage of an omniscient God, but against the notion of a nature which\nnecessarily slips free from our attempts to know it once and for all. As\nwe will see, this move is compatible with Bloor\u2019s own account, and\neven provides further resources for strengthening his defence of SSK\nagainst Latour\u2019s challenge. The argument of this chapter thus reinforces\nand extends the combination of SSK and existential phenomenology\npursued in Chapters One and Two. Furthermore, by recognising a\nrole for an independently existing nature, Heidegger\u2019s account is also\ncompatible with minimal realism. In the penultimate section of this\nchapter, I suggest an account of Heideggerian, in contrast to Kantian,\nhumility: that is, an attitude of humility which arises, not in response\nto our finitude vis-\u00e0-vis an infinitely powerful God, but in response to\nthe inevitable finitude of our epistemic powers when confronted with\nthe insuperability of an independently existing nature. I commend this\nas a suitable attitude for a minimally realist approach in science studies.\nBefore moving into the argument of the chapter, it may be worth\naddressing a potential confusion on one point. It is important to\ncarefully distinguish between the epistemic finitude to be discussed 114 Science as Social Existence\nhere and the doctrine of \u2018finitism\u2019 common in the SSK literature. They\nare not the same, though they are closely related. Bloor writes that\n\u2018finitism is probably the most important single idea in the sociological\nvision of knowledge.\u20191 In my view, if SSK practitioners wish to protect\ntheir realist credentials, then finitude should also be counted among\ntheir most important ideas.\nFinitism is the view that the correctness of an act of concept\napplication is not determined by absolute standards. As Barry Barnes\nwrites, every such act is \u2018open-ended and revisable\u2019: \u2018[n]othing in the\nnature of things, or the nature of language, or the nature of past usage,\ndetermines how we employ, or correctly employ, our terms.\u20192 What\ndetermines correct usage is, rather, the community of language users.\nHaving been taught to which birds I should apply the word \u2018duck,\u2019 I\nmay err by going on to apply it to a goose. I will then be corrected. The\nstandard according to which I am corrected is a community standard; it\nis a social convention belonging to a tradition of language users. Hence,\nthe standard is not absolute but historically contingent. It may change\nover time as the community changes. Other communities, in turn, may\nhave different standards for making sense of the same thing. In short,\nour power to successfully create meaning is finite in scope, because it\nis bounded by the range of possibilities made available to us by the\nhistorical tradition in which we necessarily find ourselves.\nIt will be useful to place these considerations against the backdrop\nof Langton\u2019s argument that the Kantian thing-in-itself can be known\nin two distinct ways: one human and imperfect; the other divine and\nabsolute. Here, the finitude of human thinking is defined by contrast\nto the infinite power of an omniscient God. In his naturalistic and\nsociological appropriation of Kant\u2019s thing-in-itself, Bloor replaces God\nwith society. He argues, following \u00c9mile Durkheim, that \u2018God [is] really\nthe social collectivity.\u20193 Hence, the final arbiter of right and wrong in\nacts of thinking and naming is not God, but us.\n1 David Bloor (1991 [1976]), Knowledge and Social Imagery, 2nd edn (Chicago:\nUniversity of Chicago Press), p. 165.\n2 Barry Barnes (1982), T.

Finitude, Humility, and the Bloor-Latour Debate 115\nSo much, I think, agrees with Heidegger\u2019s own account of the thing-\nin-itself. But now we come to an ambiguity in SSK\u2019s presentation of\nfinitism, one which Heidegger\u2019s notion of finitude can help us to clear\nup. Recall, from Chapter Two, Heidegger\u2019s distinction between the\nexistence and the essence of a thing. Heidegger traced the roots of this\ndistinction back to the Biblical view that all things owe their existence to\na divine Creator. Medieval Christian metaphysicians transformed this\ndoctrine into the claim that God first establishes the essence of a thing,\nand then actualises that essence by bringing the thing into existence. On\nthis model, there is, strictly speaking, no independently existing thing,\nbecause the thing depends on God for its existence. However, because\nGod does not depend on us, neither does the thing. We are thus justified\nin being realists about the thing. Now turn back to the Kantian thing-in-\nitself. The ambiguity in the finitist account is this: if God is the source\nof both the essence and the existence of the thing, and if God is really\nthe social collectivity, then does it not follow that society is the source\nof both the essence and the existence of the thing? If this is so, then the\nfinitist account would seem incompatible with the core realist doctrine\nof independent existence. The finitism of SSK thus seems to conflict\nwith its realism. As we will see, Latour forcefully exploits this apparent\nconflict in his dispute with Bloor.\nHeidegger\u2019s notion of finitude may be used to resolve this conflict\nby bringing into sharper focus the metaphysical presuppositions\nwhich have been left largely unexamined by the proponents of\nfinitism. In doing so, we can fully complete the naturalisation of\nKant\u2019s transcendental account of the thing-in-itself. On this fully\nnaturalised account, the social collectivity does not construct the thing\nex nihilo; it only constructs the categories by which its members may\nmake sense of that thing. The thing is thus a thing-in-itself. As such,\nit marks the extreme limit of our constructive power. It is against the\nindependent existence of this thing that we come to recognise our\nbasic condition as finite beings. Residual supernatural notions of an\ninfinitely constructive power have no place in this recognition. With\nthese considerations in mind, let us now proceed into the chapter. 116 Science as Social Existence\n2. Kantian Humility and the Thing-in-Itself\nTwo distinct theses figure prominently in Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure\nReason: an epistemological thesis; and a metaphysical thesis. The\nepistemological thesis endorses an empiricist theory of knowledge,\nwhich states that our physical senses provide the only means by which\nto gain knowledge of the world. Furthermore, Kant specifies that our\nsenses are causally affected by things, and describes this in terms of\nour \u2018receptivity\u2019 towards those things. The metaphysical thesis, in\nturn, asserts the existence of what Kant variously calls a \u2018substance\u2019 or\n\u2018absolute substance,\u2019 a \u2018transcendental object,\u2019 a \u2018noumenon,\u2019 or a \u2018thing-\nin-itself.\u2019 Notoriously, Kant argued that, although things-in-themselves\nexist, we cannot know them. We can only know what affects our senses,\nand things-in-themselves can do no such thing. As we saw above,\nKant has thus been widely interpreted as positing the existence of two\ndistinct and separate worlds, one which touches our senses, a world\nof appearances, and the other comprised of things-in-themselves. This\ntwo-worlds view has received a considerable amount of criticism since\nit was first attributed to Kant.\nIn her 1998 book, Kantian Humility: Our Ignorance of Things in\nThemselves, Rae Langton rejects this two-world interpretation, and offers\nan alternative interpretation of Kant\u2019s position. She argues that, for Kant,\nthere was only one world: the world of things. These things, however,\nfeature two distinct, non-overlapping sets of properties: relational\nand intrinsic.4 Relational properties causally affect our senses, while\nintrinsic properties do not. Hence, employing Kant\u2019s epistemological,\nor empirical, thesis, we can conclude that we do indeed know the\nthings themselves, but only through their relational properties. Kant\u2019s\nterm \u2018thing-in-itself\u2019 refers to the thing as it is on its own, independently\nof any causal relation to a subject. The thing-in-itself is the thing as it\nexists in itself in contrast to as it exists in relation to us. In a lucid turn\nof phrase, Langton thus describes the autonomous thing-in-itself as\n\u2018lonely.\u20195 The term \u2018thing-in-itself\u2019 refers not to one kind of thing rather\nthan another \u2014 to a noumenal rather than a phenomenal thing, a\n4 R ae Langton (1998), Kantian Humility: Our Ignorance of Things in Themselves (Oxford:\nClarendon Press), p. 12.\n5 Langton (1998), Kantian Humility, p. 19. 3. Finitude, Humility, and the Bloor-Latour Debate 117\ntranscendental rather than an empirical object \u2014 but to two distinct\nways in which one single thing may exist: either in itself or in relation\nto a knower. According to Langton, it is precisely the thing as it exists\nin itself, in isolation from us, which Kant says we cannot know. When\nKant says that we cannot know the thing-in-itself, he means specifically\nthat we cannot know it because it is autonomous and lonely, because it\nhas no relation to anything beyond itself. Existing in this way, the thing\nhas only intrinsic properties, properties which extend only to itself, and\nthus cannot affect our senses. Hence, although we can know that the\nthing-in-itself exists, because it is identical with the thing as it relates\nto our senses, we can never know what it is in respect of its intrinsic\nproperties. As Langton writes, \u2018[w]e can know that there are things\nthat have intrinsic properties without knowing what those properties\nare.\u20196 Of course, this sounds a lot like the minimal realism I drew from\nboth Heidegger and SSK in Chapter Two. However, as we shall see in\nthis chapter, both Heidegger and SSK depart from Kant in a number of\nimportant and interesting ways. For the moment, let us focus on what\nthey all have in common.\nThere are three things shared by Kant, Heidegger, and SSK relevant\nto the present discussion. First, all are committed to receptivity, that\nis, to the view that knowledge necessarily depends on the way things\ncausally affect our senses. They all thus endorse, in one way or another,\nthe empirical basis of all knowledge. Second, they are all committed to\nepistemic finitude. In other words, they accept that we are finite beings,\nand hence that there is a necessary limit to what we can know. For\nexample, they all agree that we cannot gain knowledge about things-\nin-themselves. Third, all three are committed, one way or another, to\nan attitude described by Langton as \u2018humility.\u2019 This is a direct result\nof their acceptance of epistemic finitude. In the case of Kant, according\nto Langton, the move from finitude to humility is mediated by Kant\u2019s\ndistinction between sensible intuition, on the one hand, and \u2018intellectual\nintuition,\u2019 on the other. Sensible intuition is a characteristic of finite\nhumans, and it allows them to perceive the relational properties of\nthings. Intellectual intuition, by contrast, belongs only to God, and it\nallows God to pick out the intrinsic properties of things, among which\n6 Langton (1998), Kantian Humility, p. 13. 118 Science as Social Existence\nKant includes things-in-themselves.7 Kantian humility must thus be\nunderstood as humility in the face of the absolute knowledge of a divine\nbeing. In the case of both Heidegger and SSK, so I argue, the move from\nfinitude to humility is mediated by a rejection of absolute knowledge,\nas such, and the endorsement instead of an account of knowledge as an\ninherently contextual phenomenon, the scope of which is determined,\nin significant part, by the social and historical conditions under which\nthe subject necessarily finds itself. We thus express humility, not before\nthe omnipotence and omniscience of an absolute God, but before a\nnatural world which constantly outstrips our best efforts to know it.\nA crucial claim in the argument of this chapter is that the concept\nof an \u2018intrinsic property\u2019 is only accidentally related to the concept of a\n\u2018thing-in-itself.\u2019 In other words, we can relieve the thing-in-itself of its\nintrinsic properties without threatening our belief in its independent\nexistence. In my view, this claim is implicit in the positions taken up\nby both SSK practitioners and Heidegger, and it lies at the core of their\nconsequential departure from Kant\u2019s own position.\nLangton attributes two fundamental claims to Kant: first, that the\nthing-in-itself must have an independent existence, that it must exist and\nbe lonely; second, and most crucial for Kant, that the thing-in-itself must\npossess intrinsic properties. Langton argues that the possession by the\nthing-in-itself of intrinsic properties is consistent with its autonomous\nexistence and its being lonely. Let us allow that this was Kant\u2019s view.\nNotice, however, that the fact that these two claims are consistent with\none another does not entail that their connection is also a necessary one.\nWhile the independent existence of the thing-in-itself may be consistent\nwith its possessing intrinsic properties, it is also consistent with its not\npossessing any such properties. This possibility is, in my view, the one\nbest suited to understanding the respective positions of Heidegger and\nSSK practitioners when it comes to the thing-in-itself.\nAs it turns out, Langton also entertains this as a possible view held\nby Kant, one in which the thing-in-itself is a \u2018bare substratum\u2019 without\nintrinsic properties.8 The idea is that if we cannot know the intrinsic\nproperties of the thing-in-itself, then we cannot assert that those\nproperties exist. Indeed, we may just as well assert that they do not exist.\n7 Langton (1998), Kantian Humility, p. 45.\n8 Langton (1998), Kantian Humility, p. 29. 3. Finitude, Humility, and the Bloor-Latour Debate 119\nThe fact that such properties do not exist can then be used to explain\nwhy we cannot know, indeed why not even a divine agent could know,\nthat they exist. Langton thinks that if Kant had held such a view, then\n\u2018[h]e would be guilty of no contradiction.\u20199 However, she then goes on\nto argue that, although this position has \u2018some prima facie plausibility,\u2019\nthere is strong evidence that Kant rejected it.10 On her reading, Kant was\nfully committed to the views that, first, \u2018[i]f a substance can exist on its\nown, it must have properties that are compatible with its existing on\nits own,\u2019 and, second, that we cannot know the intrinsic properties of\nthis independently existing substance, or thing-in-itself.11 Langton cites\nthe following passage from Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason in order to\nsupport her reading: \u2018Substances in general must have some intrinsic\nnature, which is therefore free from all external relations.\u201912\nAccording to Langton, in this passage Kant is not saying that the\nintrinsic properties of the thing-in-itself cannot be known at all. He is,\nrather, saying that we cannot know them given our current cognitive\nendowment. Indeed, she goes on to cite another passage, wherein Kant\nrefers to the thing-in-itself as something \u2018of which we know, and with the\npresent constitution of our understanding can know, nothing whatsoever.\u201913\nLangton thus concludes that, for Kant, the thing-in-itself does possess\nintrinsic, knowable, properties, but that the limited nature of our current\ncognitive abilities prevents us from gaining any knowledge of those\nproperties. It would seem, then, that Kant\u2019s commitment to the thesis\nthat things-in-themselves possess intrinsic properties, unknowable by\nhumans, implies a further commitment to the corresponding thesis that\nthere exists a superhuman agent who is able to know such properties.\nIt is difficult to imagine what else might have motivated Kant\u2019s\ncommitment to the first thesis if not his commitment to the second. It\nthus looks like Kant\u2019s doctrine that the thing-in-itself possesses intrinsic\nproperties may, at base, have been motivated by a theological doctrine\n9 Langton (1998), Kantian Humility, p. 31.\n10 Langton (1998), Kantian Humility, p. 32.\n11 Langton (1998), Kantian Humility, p. 19.\n12 Langton (1998), Kantian Humility, p. 32; cf.

For the time being,\nwe should bear in mind the interrelatedness of Kant\u2019s respective beliefs\nin the existence of intrinsic properties and the possibility of absolute\nknowledge, as this will prove crucial for our understanding of what is at\nstake in the debate between Bloor and Latour. Let us turn, then, to this\nimportant disagreement in the science studies literature.\n3. Latour\u2019s Attack on Social Constructivism\nLatour\u2019s condemnation of the alleged Kantianism of SSK practitioners\nis of a piece with his allegedly radical appropriation and revision of\nBloor\u2019s symmetry principle.14 This principle famously stipulates that the\nsociology of knowledge should be symmetrical in its style of explanation,\nthat the same types of cause should be used to explain both true and\nfalse, rational and irrational, or successful and unsuccessful beliefs.15\nLatour argues that Bloor\u2019s symmetry principle is, in fact, profoundly\nasymmetrical. At the root of this purported asymmetry is Bloor\u2019s\nallegedly uncritical adoption of the Kantian subject-object distinction,\nwhere the \u2018subject pole\u2019 is occupied by the transcendental Ego and the\n\u2018object pole\u2019 is occupied by the thing-in-itself. According to Latour, Kant\ngathered all explanatory resources around the transcendental subject,\nthereby reducing the thing-in-itself to absolute passivity.16 The result\nof this is a striking asymmetry in the way Kant treated the subject and\nobject poles. In Latour\u2019s view, by reducing the thing-in-itself to absolute\npassivity, Kant robbed it of any role in explanations of the genesis of\nscientific knowledge. All the epistemic action takes place around the\nsubject pole. Latour claims that, in the field of science studies, Bloor\u2019s\n14 Bruno Latour (1992), \u2018One More Turn after the Social Turn\u2026,\u2019 in The Social\nDimensions of Science, ed. by Ernan McMullin (Notre Dame: University of Notre\nDame Press), pp. 272\u201394.\n15 Bloor (1991), Knowledge and Social Imagery, p. 7.\n16 Latour (1992), \u2018One More Turn after the Social Turn\u2026,\u2019 p. 278. 3. Finitude, Humility, and the Bloor-Latour Debate 121\n1976 book, Knowledge and Social Imagery, stands as the \u2018high-tide mark\u2019\nof Kantian asymmetry.17 According to Latour, Bloor has simply replaced\nthe transcendental Ego at Kant\u2019s subject pole with Durkheim\u2019s \u2018macro-\nSociety.\u201918 In this sociological version of Kant, all explanatory resources\nare now gathered around society while the thing-in-itself, or \u2018Nature,\u2019\nremains absolutely passive.\nLatour describes Bloor\u2019s Durkheimian appropriation of Kant as\nthe \u2018social turn\u2019 in science studies, and he calls for its rejection and\nreplacement through \u2018one more turn after the social turn.\u2019 This further\nturn is meant to finally result in the symmetry Bloor had sought after\nbut failed to achieve. In formulating this new, allegedly more radical,\nsymmetry principle, Latour takes the explanatory resources away, not\njust from the object pole, but also from the subject pole. Like nature,\nsociety too will no longer serve as a resource in explanations of the\ngenesis of scientific knowledge, but will instead stand, like nature, as\na topic in need of explanation. Latour claims that it would be more in\nkeeping with the empirical findings of science studies if both nature\nand society were to be viewed as constructed, and thus as explicable\nin terms of their constructedness. For Latour, then, the thing-in-itself\nis not an independently existing thing which necessarily rebuffs all of\nour attempts to know it. Instead, it is a wholly constructed thing, and\nwe may thus come to know it by studying the processes by which it\nhas come into existence. It is thus not really something existing in itself\nat all, but something which exists only in relation to us. Note that, in\nhis critique of SSK, Latour has shifted the focus of analysis from the\nconstruction of knowledge about nature to the construction of nature as\nsuch. The distinction between knowledge and its object has been erased\nalong with Kant\u2019s distinction between subject and object. As we will\nsee later in this chapter, this shift in emphasis marks the weak point in\nLatour\u2019s criticism of SSK.19\nLatour\u2019s new symmetry seems to be accompanied by an implicit\nepistemological assumption, namely, that we know only what we\n17 Latour (1992), \u2018One More Turn after the Social Turn\u2026,\u2019 p. 278.\n18 Latour (1992), \u2018One More Turn after the Social Turn\u2026,\u2019 p. 277.\n19 Olga Amsterdamska had early on identified and criticised Latour\u2019s tendency to\nelide descriptions of nature with the nature being described (Olga Amsterdamska\n(1990), \u2018Surely You Are Joking, Monsieur Latour!\u2019 Science, Technology, and Human\nValues 15(4), 495\u2013504). 122 Science as Social Existence\nmake. He holds that we can know the thing-in-itself because we have\nparticipated in its production. For Latour, then, the Kantian thing-in-\nitself is not really an independently existing thing. It needs us in order\nto exist, and thus is neither lonely nor autonomous. As a result, Latour\u2019s\nnew symmetry principle would appear to jettison the Kantian doctrine\nof humility, since there appears to be nothing to whose existence we\nhave not contributed, nothing which lies outside the scope of our\nconstructive influence, and hence nothing about which we cannot gain\nknowledge. Since the notion of the thing-in-itself just is, by definition,\na name for what lies beyond our epistemic reach, the unrestrained\nconstructivity of Latour\u2019s proposal leads him to reject this notion, along\nwith the finitude and humility it implies.\n4. Bloor\u2019s Defence of Social Constructivism\nSeven years after Latour\u2019s attack appeared in print, Bloor responded\nwith a strongly worded defence, in which he rejects Latour\u2019s claim\nthat SSK practitioners are little more than \u2018unreconstructed Kantians.\u201920\nIndeed, he argues that Durkheim\u2019s reworking of Kantian themes allows\nfor a viable naturalistic and sociological reading of Kant\u2019s subject-object\ndistinction. For Bloor, a naturalistic reading of that schema must be\ndistinguished from an individualistic and transcendental reading. He\nargues that the rejection of this latter reading of the distinction does\nnot necessitate rejecting it in all cases. The subject-object distinction\nmay still prove useful for anti-individualistic and naturalistic analyses\nof scientific knowledge production. Understood naturalistically, the\nsubject-object distinction is, according to Bloor, a \u2018biological given.\u201921 As\nwe will see, Bloor\u2019s proposed naturalisation of the distinction marks a\nsubstantial departure from Kant\u2019s original position, including Kant\u2019s\nnotion of the thing-in-itself.\nWhile acknowledging that the thing-in-itself may refer to the\nnoumenal basis of Kant\u2019s subject-object distinction, Bloor suggests\nthat it can also be employed in reference to \u2018more common-sense ideas\nabout the independence of the objects of nature from our ideas about\n20 David Bloor (1999a), \u2018Anti-Latour,\u2019 Studies in History and Philosophy of Science 30(1),\n81\u2013112 (p. 106).\n21 Bloor (1999a), \u2018Anti-Latour,\u2019 p. 107. 3. Finitude, Humility, and the Bloor-Latour Debate 123\nthem.\u201922 Introducing a simplified, individualistic model, he briefly\ndescribes a naturalistic setting in which an organism learns about its\nenvironment by causally interacting with it. This process, he suggests,\ninvolves varying degrees of active engagement and disengagement\nwith the environment. These are causal and biological processes which\ndo not derive from culture, but are instead presupposed by it.23 Hence,\naccording to Bloor, a naturalised subject-object distinction can be\nused as a conceptual tool for explaining the way in which one part of\nnature (the organism, or subject) interacts with another part of nature\n(the organism\u2019s environment, or object).24 Unfortunately, Bloor does\nnot develop his naturalistic description beyond the individual level.\nHowever, if we were to extend this simplified, individualistic model to\nthe more complex social level, his general idea would seem to be that\norganisms depend on one another as they engage with, disengage with,\nand otherwise learn about their environment. On Bloor\u2019s account, then,\nthere is a biologically given level of fundamental sociality which will be\npresupposed in any naturalistic account of the emergence of culture, in\ngeneral, and science in particular.25\nBloor thus charges Latour with having failed to sufficiently\ndistinguish between the historically contingent ways of formally\narticulating the subject-object distinction, on the one hand, and the\nbiological and causal phenomenon which constitute the natural\nground for that distinction, on the other. Bloor argues that Kant\u2019s\nindividualistic and transcendental presentation of the distinction may\nbe both socialised and naturalised in a way which brings it more firmly\nin line with its original biological and causal foundation. On this basis,\nBloor furthermore rejects Latour\u2019s claim that SSK reduces the object\npole of the distinction, that is, nature, to absolute passivity. According\nto the naturalistic construal of the subject-object distinction, the object\npole, the thing-in-itself, is conceived as active because it exercises causal\n22 Bloor (1999a), \u2018Anti-Latour,\u2019 p. 86.\n23 Bloor (1999a), \u2018Anti-Latour,\u2019 p. 86.\n24 Bloor (1999a), \u2018Anti-Latour,\u2019 p. 106\u201307.\n25 For recent work on this topic, see: Michael Tomasello (2014), A Natural History of\nHuman Thinking (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press), especially chpt. 4,\n\u2018Collective Intentionality\u2019; and Kim Sterelny (2012), \u2018Language, Gesture, Skill: The\nCo-Evolutionary Foundations of Language,\u2019 in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal\nSociety B 367, 2141\u201351. My thanks to Andrew Buskell for bringing this literature to\nmy attention. 124 Science as Social Existence\nagency.26 That nature is causally active is entailed by Kant\u2019s claim\nthat we can only know a thing if it can affect us. As Langton argues,\nknowledge entails receptivity. The basic idea is that we form beliefs\nabout nature on the basis of our causal interaction with it. However,\nalthough nature plays a necessary causal role in the formation of our\nbeliefs about it, it is not a sufficient cause for those beliefs. On Bloor\u2019s\naccount, the claim that a necessary but insufficient causal role must be\nplayed by nature is methodologically crucial, for without it we could\nnot make sense of the fact that two scientists may form contradictory\nbeliefs about the same natural phenomenon. This claim is, of course,\nalso consistent with minimal realism.\nBloor elaborates on the necessary but insufficient causal role\nplayed by the thing-in-itself in the formation of scientific knowledge\nby discussing the contradictory interpretations of Robert Millikan and\nFelix Ehrenhaft in respect of the natural effects of what we now know as\nelectrons.27 On the basis of the experimental data, Millikan believed that\nhe had secured evidence confirming Rutherford\u2019s electron theory. In\ncontrast, Ehrenhaft, also on the basis of the experimental data, believed\nthat he had secured evidence falsifying Rutherford\u2019s theory. Bloor\nargues that, because both interpretations were based on data produced\nby natural causes, that data alone cannot explain their divergence.\nIf we believe, as most of us do believe, that Millikan got it basically right,\nit will follow that we also believe that electrons, as part of the world\nMillikan described, did play a causal role in making him believe in,\nand talk about electrons. But then we have to remember that (on such\na scenario) electrons will also have played their part in making sure that\nMillikan\u2019s contemporary and opponent, Felix Ehrenhaft, didn\u2019t believe in\nelectrons. Once we realise this, then there is a sense in which the electron\n\u2018itself\u2019 drops out of the story because it is a common factor behind two\ndifferent responses, and it is the cause of the difference that interests us.28\nIn the cases of both Millikan and Ehrenhaft, a complete causal explanation\nfor their respective interpretations must refer to something beyond the\nthing-in-itself, the independently existing natural thing, to which they\nwere equally exposed.

Only by citing both natural and social causes can\nthe sociologist uncover the necessary and sufficient conditions for the\nformation of the beliefs in question. Because Millikan and Ehrenhaft\nwere similarly affected by nature, the difference in their respective\ninterpretations must therefore be explained by a divergence in the social\nconditions influencing the formation of their respective interpretations\nof the data. This line of argument follows from what is commonly called\nthe \u2018underdetermination thesis.\u2019 This thesis states that the data resulting\nfrom natural causes underdetermines the interpretations which arise\nin response to that data. This is just another way of saying that such\ndata is necessary but not sufficient for explaining the way in which it\nis interpreted. The underdetermination thesis plays a fundamental role\nin the methodology of SSK, in particular, and of social constructivism,\nin general. Let us now turn to Latour\u2019s response to Bloor\u2019s defence of\nsocial constructivism.\n5. Where the Dust Settles in the Debate\nIn responding to Bloor\u2019s defence, Latour no longer argues that SSK\ntreats the thing-in-itself, the object pole of the subject-object distinction,\nas absolutely passive. Instead, he argues that SSK\u2019s underdetermination\nthesis is premised on an unacceptably impoverished view of the role\nplayed by objects. He criticizes Bloor for allegedly making the claim that,\nin the disagreement between Millikan and Ehrenhaft over the existence\nof electrons, the electron \u2018itself\u2019 makes \u2018no difference\u2019: \u2018Now, I want\nsomeone to explain to me what it is for an object to play a role if it makes\nno difference.\u201929 Latour then goes on to argue that, for SSK, \u2018electrons\n\u201cthemselves\u201d are not allowed to cause our interpretations of them, no\nmatter how much scientists engage in making them have a bearing, a\ncausality, on what they (the scientists) say about them (the electrons).\u201930\nI will comment on Latour\u2019s complaint in the next but one section. Note\nfor now, however, that, as will be clear from the long passage from\nBloor quoted at the end of the last section, Bloor does not claim that the\nelectron \u2018makes no difference\u2019 to what Millikan and Ehrenhaft believe\n29 Bruno Latour (1999a), \u2018For David Bloor \u2026 and Beyond: A Reply to David Bloor\u2019s\n\u201cAnti-Latour,\u201d\u2019 Studies in History and Philosophy of Science 30(1), 113\u201329 (p. 117).\n30 L atour (1999a), \u2018For David Bloor \u2026 and Beyond,\u2019 p. 119. 126 Science as Social Existence\nabout it. His claim is, rather, that its causal effects cannot explain the\ndifference between the scientists\u2019 respective beliefs. As Bloor observes,\nLatour has \u2018confused different \u201cdifferences.\u201d\u201931\nIn any case, on the basis of his interpretation of this passage, Latour\nconcludes that the underdetermination thesis is an \u2018absurd position\u2019 not\nworth defending even when it is being attacked by \u2018even more stupid\nenemies.\u201932 Latour then proceeds to rephrase Bloor\u2019s term \u2018electron\n\u201citself\u201d\u2019 as \u2018electron in itself,\u2019 allowing him to more easily identify it with\nthe Kantian thing-in-itself.33 On this basis, he argues that for the SSK\npractitioner, just as for Kant, the thing-in-itself plays no other role than\nto allow one to distinguish between competing philosophical schools.\nMore specifically, he claims that the thing-in-itself serves only to protect\nSSK against charges of idealism. This, in Latour\u2019s view, is the only real\ndifference it makes.\nYet, as Langton\u2019s reading of Kant suggests, the notion of the thing-in-\nitself was motivated not by Kant\u2019s desire to deflect charges of idealism,\nbut rather by his recognition that our ability to acquire knowledge of\nnature is inescapably finite. Latour thus seems to have misunderstood\nthe motivation behind Kant\u2019s position. Indeed, Latour characterises the\nthing-in-itself, not as the mark of an independently existing nature, not\nas a sign of human finitude and a reason for humility, but rather as a\nsymptom of an unseemly absolutism and hubris: \u2018It is through nature\nthat the whole history of absolutism has been developed.\u201934 He thus\nproposes that the concept of nature be topicalised and deconstructed.\nInsofar as the term \u2018nature\u2019 here stands for the Kantian transcendental\n31 D avid Bloor (1999b), \u2018Reply to Bruno Latour,\u2019 Studies in History and Philosophy of\nScience 30(1), 131\u201336, p. 134.\n32 L atour (1999a), \u2018For David Bloor \u2026 and Beyond,\u2019 p. 117.\n33 L atour (1999a), \u2018For David Bloor \u2026 and Beyond,\u2019 p. 118. Bloor\u2019s electron passage\nhas also attracted strong criticism from the philosophers of science Tim Lewens\nand Nick Tosh, though for different reasons (Tim Lewens (2005), \u2018Realism and\nthe Strong Program,\u2019 British Journal for the Philosophy of Science 56(3), 559\u201377; Nick\nTosh (2007), \u2018Science, Truth and History, Part II. Metaphysical Bolt-holes for the\nSociology of Scientific Knowledge?,\u2019 Studies in History and Philosophy of Science 38(1),\n185\u2013209). I elsewhere defend Bloor against these particular criticisms (Jeff Kochan\n(2010a), \u2018Contrastive Explanation and the \u201cStrong Programme\u201d in the Sociology of\nScientific Knowledge,\u2019 Social Studies of Science 40(1), 127\u201344). Martin Kusch offers\na critical, if not always accurate, overview of this dispute (Martin Kusch (2018),\n\u2018Scientific Realism and Social Epistemology,\u2019 in Routledge Handbook of Scientific\nRealism, ed. by Juha Saatsi (London: Routledge), pp. 261\u2013275).\n34 L atour (1999a), \u2018For David Bloor \u2026 and Beyond,\u2019 p. 127. 3. Finitude, Humility, and the Bloor-Latour Debate 127\nobject, a thing-in-itself possessing intrinsic but unknowable properties,\nthis may well be good advice. However, this is not what Bloor means\nby the term \u2018nature\u2019 and, as we will see in the next section, Heidegger\nprovided just the sort of topicalisation and deconstruction called for by\nLatour. I will argue that Heidegger\u2019s conclusions tend to support Bloor\nrather than Latour.\nAs we have seen, Bloor maintains that the thing-in-itself, which he\ntakes to be an independently existing \u2018natural object,\u2019 does not on its own\nprovide sufficient grounds for explaining the interpretive disagreements\nwhich may arise between scientists regarding the experimental data\nrelated to that object. Central to Bloor\u2019s position is his conviction that\nthe resulting interpretations are underdetermined by that data. This\nconviction traces its conceptual roots, in significant part, back to Kant.\nHowever, in his response to Latour\u2019s rejection of the Kantian thing-in-\nitself, Bloor furthermore argues that the underdetermination thesis does\nnot depend on, nor does it push us towards, viewing natural objects in\nthe way Kant did.35 Bloor appears to both move towards and pull away\nfrom Kant.\nThe apparent conflict in Bloor\u2019s attitude may be resolved once we\nrecognise that he does not reject the basic common-sense impulse\nbehind Kant\u2019s notion of the thing-in-itself \u2014 belief in an independently\nexisting nature \u2014 but instead follows Durkheim in formally developing\nthat impulse differently than did Kant. Where Kant viewed the thing-in-\nitself as a transcendental object standing opposite an individual subject,\nBloor views it a natural object standing opposite a society of subjects.\nBloor then argues that both nature and society make a necessary\ncontribution to the development of scientific knowledge. Latour\nmisreads Bloor as denying a significant causal role to nature, and, on\nthat basis, he concludes that the underdetermination thesis is absurd.\nBut, for Bloor, the underdetermination thesis is not absurd, because the\ncausal efficacy of an independently existing nature is beyond doubt.\nAgainst Latour\u2019s misplaced criticism, Bloor reasserts that \u2018the richness\nof the natural world, and the complexity of the scientist\u2019s engagement\nwith it, is central to the thesis of underdetermination when properly\nunderstood, and hence to the Strong Program\u2019 in SSK.36\n35 B loor (1999b), \u2018Reply to Bruno Latour,\u2019 p. 134.\n36 B loor (1999b), \u2018Reply to Bruno Latour,\u2019 p. 134. 128 Science as Social Existence\nThis is where the dust settles in the exchange between Bloor and\nLatour. I have argued that SSK\u2019s endorsement of a modified version\nof Kant\u2019s notion of the thing-in-itself fits hand in glove with its realist\ncommitment to the independent existence of nature. Latour\u2019s attack\non this modified notion of the thing-in-itself may thus be viewed as a\nsimultaneous attack on SSK\u2019s realism. In Chapter Two, I promoted a\nminimal realist reading of Heidegger\u2019s work, and suggested that this\nminimal realism bears much in common with SSK\u2019s residual realism.\nIn fact, it turns out that the realism on both sides is based, in significant\npart, on a critical appropriation of Kant\u2019s notion of the thing-in-itself.\nIndeed, Heidegger had much to say about the Kantian thing-in-itself. I\nwant to now show that attention to Heidegger on this point will help us\nto more fully illuminate some of the key points in the dispute between\nBloor and Latour, as well as to more fully understand the ways in which\nBloor\u2019s notion of the thing-in-itself departs from that of Kant.\n6. Heidegger and the Thing-in-Itself\nIn Being and Time and other writings from the late 1920s, Heidegger\noffers numerous critical comments on Kant\u2019s thing-in-itself, in particular,\nand his subject-object distinction, more generally. Heidegger is not so\nmuch concerned with the distinction between subject and object as he is\nwith the presuppositions Kant relies on in schematising that distinction\nas a formal structure. In Heidegger\u2019s view, Kant grounds the distinction\nuncritically in an ontology which construes both subject and object in\nterms of substance. Heidegger\u2019s criticism focuses especially on Kant\u2019s\nassumption that the subject is to be understood, first and foremost, as a\nthinking substance.37 As we saw in Chapter One, Heidegger\u2019s existential\nanalysis of the subject is meant to dig beneath the orthodox notion of the\n37 H eidegger argues that Kant uncritically adopted his ontology of the subject from\nDescartes. Hence, Kant \u2018failed to provide an ontology with Dasein as its theme or\n(to put this in Kantian language) to give a preliminary ontological analytic of the\nsubjectivity of the subject\u2019 (Martin Heidegger (1962a [1927]), Being and Time, trans.\nby John Macquarrie and Edward Robinson (Oxford: Blackwell), p. 45 [24]; following\nscholarly convention, page numbers in square brackets refer to the original 1927\nGerman edition of Being and Time). In the same period, Heidegger also comments\nthat \u2018Kant is still working with a very crude psychology\u2019 (Martin Heidegger (1982a\n[1975]), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, trans. by Albert Hofstadter (Bloomington:\nIndiana University Press), p. 50). 3. Finitude, Humility, and the Bloor-Latour Debate 129\nsubject as a thinking substance which seeks access to the world, bringing\nout instead the more fundamental existential state of the subject as\nalready existing in the world alongside and along with other entities.\nHence, Heidegger does not reject the subject-object distinction as such;\nhe instead challenges its Kantian formulation which presupposes a\ntheory-laden conceptualisation of the subject in terms of substance.\nWe can draw on Heidegger\u2019s critique of Kant in order to challenge\nLangton\u2019s Kantian claim that the thing-in-itself is necessarily an object\nwith intrinsic properties. Note that this critical move does not force us\nto also reject epistemic humility, or the finitude which motivates that\nhumility. Heidegger argues that the problem presented by Kant\u2019s thing-\nin-itself is not an epistemological but a metaphysical one. In Kant, the\nnotion of the thing-in-itself correlates with the existence of an absolute\nknower, and so a rejection of Kant\u2019s notion entails the corresponding\nrejection of an absolute knower.38 The move here is to repudiate the\nthing-in-itself just insofar as it correlates with an absolute thinking\nsubstance-subject, but not to repudiate the concept as such. The problem\nHeidegger locates in Kant is not based on the epistemic question of\nwhether one could gain knowledge of the intrinsic properties of things-\nin-themselves, but on the metaphysical question of whether a knower\nwith the requisite absolute epistemic powers could at all exist. For Kant,\nthe answer to this metaphysical question was yes, but the absolute\nknower is God not the finite human. The finite human should thus\nexpress humility in the face of God\u2019s infinite epistemic power.\nAccording to Heidegger, Kant makes a distinction between the thing-\nin-itself as an object grasped by absolute understanding, on the one hand,\nand the thing-in-itself as an object grasped by finite understanding, on\nthe other. The former grasps the thing-in-itself absolutely, in terms\nof the thing\u2019s own intrinsic properties, while the latter only grasps it\nas an \u2018appearance\u2019 and remains ignorant of those intrinsic properties.\nHeidegger thus reads Kant in a similar way to Langton. Both scholars\nreject the \u2018two-world\u2019 thesis. For Heidegger, as for Langton, there are\nnot two different kinds of thing in Kant, the phenomenal and noumenal,\nbut rather one kind of thing understood in two different ways, either\n38 M artin Heidegger (1984a [1978]), The Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, trans. by\nMichael Heim (Bloomington: Indiana University Press), p. 164. 130 Science as Social Existence\nfinitely or infinitely.39 In his commentary on Kant, Heidegger wrote that\n\u2018the entity \u201cin appearance\u201d is the same entity as the entity in itself, and\nthis alone. As an entity, it alone can become an object, although only for\na finite [act] of knowledge.\u2019 Later he emphasised, in a marginal note\nalongside this passage, that this is \u2018not the sameness of the What, but\nrather the That of the X!\u201940 The X is the thing-in-itself, an entity about\nwhich we can say that it exists, but not what it is. Heidegger\u2019s conception\nof the thing-in-itself thus draws on his distinction between existence\nand essence, that-being and what-being, which was discussed at length\nin Chapter Two.\nHeidegger furthermore argues that, because Kant took the\nfundamentality of substance ontology for granted, he uncritically\nconceptualised the subject-object distinction as one between a discrete\nsubstance-subject, on the one hand, and a discrete substance-object, on\nthe other. As a consequence, Kant was forced to address the problem\nof how the subject-substance crosses over, or transcends, the barrier\nseparating it from the world conceived as object-substance, a world\ncontaining independently existing things. This is the problem of\nthe glass-bulb model, introduced in Chapter One. For Kant, only an\nabsolute or infinite subject is capable of this kind of transcendence, that\nis, of grasping independently existing things as they are in themselves.\nBecause human beings are finite creatures without absolute epistemic\npowers, this kind of transcendence is closed off to us. Kant thus\nconcludes that we grasp things only as they appear to us, not as they\nare in themselves.\nHeidegger challenges Kant\u2019s treatment of the subject-object\ndistinction by re-interpreting Kant\u2019s notion of transcendence. As\nwe saw in Chapter One, Heidegger argues that the subject is not a\nsubstance condemned to an inner realm from which it must win its\nfreedom in order to achieve knowledge of an external world. On the\ncontrary, the subject already exists alongside and along with other\n39 M artin Heidegger, Martin (1997 [1929]), Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, 5th\nedn, enlarged, trans. by Richard Taft (Bloomington: Indiana University Press), p.\n22; Heidegger (1984a), The Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, p. 164.\n40 Heidegger (1997), Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, p. 22; translation modified,\nbrackets original. For the marginal note, see Heidegger (1997), Kant and the Problem\nof Metaphysics, p. 22 n. 1. 3. Finitude, Humility, and the Bloor-Latour Debate 131\nentities in the world. Hence, argues Heidegger, the subject is not in\nsearch of transcendence; it is transcendence itself. The subject does\nnot transcend its own finite limits in order to achieve contact with an\nindependently existing thing-in-itself. Rather, as being-in-the-world, the\nsubject already exists alongside independently existing things. Hence,\nits transcendence carries it, not towards those things, but away from\nthem, towards a recognition of the projected world which provides the\nexistential conditions structuring its possibilities for understanding and\nengaging with those independent things.\n[W]hat Dasein surpasses in its transcendence is not a gap or barrier\n\u2018between\u2019 itself and objects. But entities, among which Dasein also\nfactically is, get surpassed by Dasein. Objects are surpassed in advance;\nmore exactly, entities are surpassed and can subsequently become\nobjects. [\u2026] [A]s transcending, Dasein is beyond nature, although, as\nfactical, it remains environed by nature. [\u2026] That towards which the\nsubject transcends is what we call world. [\u2026] [W]e characterize the\nbasic phenomenon of Dasein\u2019s transcendence with the expression\nbeing-in-the-world.41\nAgainst Kant\u2019s notion of the subject as a substance, Heidegger offers an\naccount of the subject in terms of being-in-the-world. In this way, he\ndissolves the epistemological problem which so exercised Kant, namely,\nthe problem of how an internal thinking substance may cross over to, so\nas to then grasp, an external object. This external object is Kant\u2019s thing-\nin-itself, which, according to Langton, Kant construed as a substance\npossessed of intrinsic properties.\nIn abandoning the Kantian construal of the thing-in-itself, Heidegger\nalso abandons the corresponding notion of absolute understanding. He\ndescribes his rejection of this latter notion as \u2018ontic atheism,\u2019 that is, the\nrepudiation of the idea that God is a substance with an infinite power\nto absolutely grasp the objects of the world in their intrinsic features.42\nBy abandoning the notion of an infinitely powerful subject-substance,\nagainst which Kant measured the finitude of the human being, Heidegger\nsuggests a reconceptualisation of the meaning of human finitude. He\nstill understands finitude in terms of receptivity, but receptivity is no\n41 Heidegger (1984a), The Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, p. 166; translation modified.\n42 Heidegger (1984a), The Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, p. 165 n. 9. 132 Science as Social Existence\nlonger a sign of our lamentable inability to achieve absolute knowledge.\nIt is no longer a deprived state in which we find ourselves permanently\ncondemned to being affected by objects whose intrinsic properties\nwe can never know. In contrast to Kant, Heidegger argues that the\nsubject\u2019s finitude is not an \u2018ontic\u2019 condition, that is, not a consequence\nof its being a finite substance. It is, rather, an ontological condition, that\nis, a consequence of the finite range of possibilities available to the\nsubject as a form of existence. This finite range of possibilities opens\nup a horizon in which the subject may encounter things as what they\nare. Their whatness, their essence, is circumscribed by the horizon of\nexistential possibilities within which the subject is able to make sense\nof them. However, to make sense of a thing entails that that thing exists\nas something of which sense may be made. Furthermore, if we are to\nmake sense of a thing, it must first affect us. We must, in other words, be\nreceptive to its influence. Receptivity is thus our capacity to be affected\nby the things-in-themselves alongside which we exist in the world.\nUnlike Kant, Heidegger argues that the things towards which we\nare receptive, the things which affect us, are not objects with intrinsic\nproperties which lie forever beyond our ken. Indeed, for Heidegger\nobjecthood is a projection rather than an affect. The objecthood of the\nobject, its fundamental essence as object, is something we construct\nrather than receive. This is why, in the long quote two paragraphs\nabove, Heidegger writes that only in transcending things do we come\nto perceive them as objects. A thing affects us, but our understanding\nof that thing as an object with determinate properties, our making\nsense of its whatness in terms of objecthood, is something we project\nonto the thing rather than something we receive from it. One may say\nthat the whatness of a thing is underdetermined by the way in which\nit affects our senses. Heidegger\u2019s attention to the projective element in\nour understanding highlights an aspect of Kant\u2019s philosophy which\ncarries us beyond the exposition of Langton with which this chapter\nbegan. Langton\u2019s commentary focuses almost exclusively on Kant\u2019s\nnotion of receptivity, but we must now broaden the scope of our\nattention to include Kant\u2019s notion of spontaneity. Heidegger called\nthis projective spontaneity \u2018construction,\u2019 writing that \u2018the explicit\nexecution of the projecting, and even what is grasped in the ontological, 3. Finitude, Humility, and the Bloor-Latour Debate 133\nmust necessarily be construction.\u201943 For Heidegger, then, objecthood\nlies on the constructive side of Kant\u2019s distinction between receptivity\nand constructivity. In critical response to Kant and neo-Kantianism,\nHeidegger writes that \u2018[an] entity is without a subject, but objects exist\nonly for a subject that does the objectifying.\u201944 In other words, a thing\nbecomes an object for us only when we constructively thematise it\nas such. Heidegger is making the general point that what affects our\nsenses is a thing about which we may know that it is but not what it\nis. What affects us, in other words, is the thing described in Chapter\nTwo, a thing which exists but lacks determinate properties: the thing-\nin-itself as Heidegger now construes it. On this reading of Heidegger,\nwe cannot know what the thing-in-itself is, we cannot grasp its intrinsic\nproperties, not because we are finite, but because the thing-in-itself has\nno such properties. The issue here is thus not, as Langton says it was\nfor Kant, the finitude of our receptivity, for even an infinitely receptive\nknower will fail to be affected by what was never there in the first place.\nThe issue here is instead the finitude of our constructivity. Unlike an\ninfinitely constructive knower, we do not construct the thing-in-itself\nin an act of knowing; we instead only construct the categories through\nwhich we are able to know it. Whereas Kantian humility is prompted by\nthe finitude of our receptivity, Heideggerian humility is prompted by\nthe finitude of our constructivity.\nTo sum up this section, the categories which enable understanding\nare projected through our constructive power. The finite number of\ncategories available to us determines the limited number of ways\nin which we may make sense of things-in-themselves. This finite\nconstructive project provides the basis for metaphysics, that is, the\nstudy of the basic ontological categories by which we come to know\nwhat things are. Heidegger wrote that metaphysics is grounded in\n\u2018the humanness of reason, i.e., its finitude.\u2019 Metaphysical knowledge\nis, according to Heidegger, a direct consequence of our finitude, our\ninescapable mortality, rather than of our presumed ability to transcend\nthat finitude, to reach, infinitely, for heaven. Because the finitude of our\n43 Heidegger (1997), Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, p. 163.\n44 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 157; translation modified. 134 Science as Social Existence\nconstructive power makes impossible a transcendent grasp of the thing-\nin-itself \u2014 leaving us to be only affected by it in its brute, independent\nexistence \u2014 our attention is instead pushed away from the thing-in-\nitself and towards the constructive categories we must employ in\norder to make sense of it as a thing present-at-hand within-the-world.\nFor Heidegger, metaphysics is nothing other than the study of these\ncategories and their relations to one another. Orthodox metaphysics,\nin contrast, treats these existential categories as ontic, that is, as extant\nmental things referring to the intrinsic properties of the things we seek\nto know, rather than as ontological, that is, as the existential structures\nof being-in-the-world which enable us to know those things.\nFor Kant the problem of finitude springs from our failure to grasp\nthings in terms of their own autonomous categories. These categories,\nthe intrinsic properties of things, lie beyond the reach of our finite\npowers of construction. Not so for Kant\u2019s absolute thinker. This divine\nsubject possesses infinite powers of construction, and hence there is\nnothing which can exist beyond its reach, nothing which is autonomous\nand lonely. The absolute subject has no need for receptivity, because it\nabsolutely affects things rather than being affected by them. It requires\nnothing to exist beyond itself, because when it creates, it does so like\nGod, ex nihilo. On this reading, then, orthodox metaphysics lacks\nhumility because it effaces the problem of finitude by seeking to grasp\nthings absolutely. On such a view, the thing-in-itself is an affront to\nthe infinite constructivity of an absolute subject. There is thus no room\nin orthodox metaphysics for the thing-in-itself. Heidegger argues that\nif this orthodoxy were to abandon its \u2018presumption,\u2019 by giving up its\n\u2018pride\u2019 and accepting the basic existential fact of its own finitude, indeed,\nif it were to recognise ontology as springing from the very essence of\nfinitude, then metaphysics will have finally found its true meaning.45\nAccording to him, \u2018the struggle against the \u201cthing in itself,\u201d\u2019 the origins\nof which he locates in German Idealism, springs from a failure to\nunderstand the way in which the \u2018humanness of reason,\u2019 that is, reason\u2019s\nfinitude, forms the essential core of Kant\u2019s problematic.46\n45 Heidegger (1997), Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, p. 88.\n46 Heidegger (1997), Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, pp. 171, 15. 3. Finitude, Humility, and the Bloor-Latour Debate 135\n7. Putting the Bloor-Latour Debate to Rest\nWe saw earlier that Bloor attempts to preserve the common-sense\nimpulse behind Kant\u2019s version of the subject-object distinction, but he\ndeparts dramatically from Kant by naturalizing and socialising that\ndistinction. Bloor\u2019s reformulation of the distinction is compatible not\nonly with the view that things exist independently of our knowledge\nof them, but also with the view that such things possess intrinsic\nproperties existing independently of our knowledge of them. However,\nBloor rejects the metaphysical claim that our descriptions of things,\nthat is, our specification of their properties by applying concepts or\ncategories to them, strictly correspond to the independent nature of\nthose things. Indeed, Bloor has not endorsed the view that the thing-in-\nitself possesses intrinsic properties. His position is thus also compatible\nwith the view that the thing-in-itself possesses no intrinsic properties\nat all. This view, like that of Heidegger, departs significantly from the\nKantian position as described by Langton.\nBloor\u2019s departure from Kant is, however, left somewhat unclear\nby the fact that he continues to refer to things as \u2018objects\u2019 without\nspelling out in sufficient detail how his use of this term differs from\nKant\u2019s original usage. Latour seizes on Bloor\u2019s terminology and\nsubmits it to strong criticism. He dismisses Bloor\u2019s use of the term\n\u2018object,\u2019 apparently without attempting to properly understand what\nBloor means by that term. Indeed, he reads Bloor as having meant\na Kantian substance possessed of intrinsic properties. Latour seems\nto reason that, if we are receptive to objects, then, since objects have\nintrinsic properties, we must also be receptive to those properties.\nHence, making reference to the Millikan-Ehrenhaft controversy over\nthe existence of the electron, Latour criticises Bloor for allegedly\nclaiming that \u2018electrons \u201cthemselves\u201d are not allowed to cause our\ninterpretations of them.\u201947 Now, as we saw earlier, Latour knows that\nBloor grants electrons a necessary but insufficient causal role in the\nformation of our beliefs about them. Latour complains, however, that\nin this capacity \u2018they don\u2019t do very much.\u201948 Latour wants an account\nwhere electrons do more. Indeed, he appears to want an account where\n47 L atour (1999a), \u2018For David Bloor \u2026 and Beyond,\u2019 p. 119.\n48 L atour (1999a), \u2018For David Bloor \u2026 and Beyond,\u2019 p. 117. 136 Science as Social Existence\nelectrons possess intrinsic properties, and where those properties\nboth necessarily and sufficiently determine our interpretations of\nthem, an account, in short, where electrons make us know them as\nwhat they are. Only such an account could effectively short-circuit the\nunderdetermination thesis central to the methodology of SSK.\nBy suggesting that electrons not only necessarily but also sufficiently\ndetermine our interpretations of them, Latour rolls back the symmetry\nprinciple introduced by Bloor, reintroducing an old and familiar\nasymmetry into explanations of the truth and falsity of scientific beliefs\nand descriptions. Scientific descriptions are true when they correspond\nto the independently existing properties of the things they describe.\nFalse scientific descriptions, in contrast, are false because they do not\ncorrespond to the independent properties of the things they describe.\nAs is common with Latour\u2019s rhetorical style, he obscures this regressive\nmove behind the claim that he is extending the symmetry principle in\na radically new way, by claiming to introduce \u2018one more turn after the\nsocial turn.\u201949 But it seems that Latour has made not so much a critical\nadvance on Bloor\u2019s symmetry principle as he has an obfuscating retreat\ninto a more orthodox position, albeit one wrapped up in unorthodox\nterminology. It is for this reason that Bloor, in step with Harry Collins\nand Steven Yearley, has argued that \u2018something remarkably like direct\nor naive realism turns up in Latour\u2019s methodology.\u201950 Yet, as I will argue\nshortly, this cannot be the full story.\nIn the meantime, it must be acknowledged that Latour\u2019s criticism is\nmotivated by a genuine, if misplaced, worry. In Latour\u2019s view, Bloor\nappears to place the object on the side of receptivity and its intrinsic\nproperties on the side of constructivity, and, on this basis, he rightly\nwonders how an object could be separated from its intrinsic properties\nin this way. Indeed, such a position may well not even be coherent.\nBut this is not Bloor\u2019s position, because he does not require what he\n49 E lsewhere, I characterise Latour\u2019s rhetorical strategy as one of dissimulation (Jeff\nKochan (2010b), \u2018Latour\u2019s Heidegger,\u2019 Social Studies of Science 40(4), 579\u201398). In still\nanother place, I call (tongue in cheek) for yet one more turn after the Latourian turn,\na turn which delivers us to the position being outlined here (Jeff Kochan (2015b),\n\u2018Putting a Spin on Circulating Reference, or How to Rediscover the Scientific\nSubject,\u2019 Studies in History and Philosophy of Science 49, 103\u201307).\n50 B loor (1999a), \u2018Anti-Latour,\u2019 p. 94. Cf. similar criticisms of Latour in Harry M. Collins\nand Steven Yearley (1992), \u2018Journey into Space,\u2019 in Science as Practice and Culture, ed.\nby Andrew Pickering (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), pp. 369\u201389. 3. Finitude, Humility, and the Bloor-Latour Debate 137\ncalls \u2018objects\u2019 to have intrinsic properties. His is, admittedly, a rather\nunconventional use of the term \u2018object,\u2019 and so it is perhaps not\nsurprising that Latour failed to properly understand it. According to\nBloor\u2019s usage, \u2018object\u2019 denotes an indeterminate material thing, one\nwhich exists independently of our beliefs about it, or involvements\nwith it. It is the thing-in-itself, and our knowledge of its existence is\na consequence of our receptive rather than our constructive relation\nto it. Hence, Bloor\u2019s position does not require that objects possess\nintrinsic properties, and it is compatible with the claim that they do\nnot. Indeed, as Latour\u2019s criticism nicely brings out, Bloor\u2019s position is\nbest understood as requiring that the thing-in-itself does not possess\nany intrinsic properties at all. On this interpretation, Bloor is closer\nto Heidegger than to Kant. When Heidegger argues that we project\nobjecthood in our understanding of things as objects, he means that our\nrelation to objects is a constructive one. However, in contrast to Bloor,\nby \u2018object\u2019 Heidegger means a substance with intrinsic properties. This\nis the same meaning employed by Latour, and attributed to Kant by\nboth Langton and Heidegger.\nHeidegger\u2019s criticism of Kant may help to throw further light on\nLatour\u2019s own position. Indeed, despite being charged with naive realism,\nthere is evidence suggesting that for Latour, too, our relation to objects\nis a constructive, or projective, one. This evidence is, however, obscured\nby the fact that Latour also espouses the view that our relation to objects\nis receptive rather than constructive. The root of the problem here may\nlie in Latour\u2019s failure to properly distinguish between the that-being and\nthe what-being of a thing, between a thing\u2019s existence and its essence.\nAn elision of these two aspects of the being of a thing may explain his\ndisinclination, noted earlier, to distinguish between our constructive\nknowledge of nature and the nature we constructively know, or, put\notherwise, between our interpretations of nature and the nature we\ninterpret. This puts Latour into a similar camp to Joseph Rouse, whose\npractical hermeneutics was discussed in Chapter Two. If this diagnosis\nof the problem is correct, then it may help to resolve an apparent\ncontradiction in Latour\u2019s work. He has, for example, asserted that things,\nincluding those he calls \u2018nonhumans,\u2019 determine our interpretations\nof them, that our epistemic relation to them is a receptive one. Latour\nthus laments Bloor\u2019s failure to allow the electron-nonhuman to play a 138 Science as Social Existence\nsufficient role in determining the difference between Millikan\u2019s and\nEhrenhaft\u2019s respective interpretations of their data. This looks like a\nstrong stance in favour of a robust realism. And yet, Latour also argues\nthat his \u2018new active nonhumans are utterly different from the boring\ninactive things-in-themselves of the realist\u2019s plot.\u201951 So he appears to\nalso reject realism. We need to pull the various tangled threads apart in\norder to understand what is going on here.\nOn the basis of a number of Latour\u2019s statements, it would be natural\nto interpret him as affirming the view that the things we call electrons\ncausally determine the categories by which we now know them. This\nsuggests that the electron is an independently existing substance with\ndeterminate properties, that we are receptive to those properties, and\nthat those properties cause our knowledge of them. We encountered\nthis interpretation in Chapter One, labelling it the \u2018natural attitude\u2019\nwhich both SSK and existential phenomenology treat as a topic for\ninvestigation. Latour appears to adopt the natural attitude as a resource\nwhen he asserts that electrons cause our interpretations of them. This\nwas the basis for his rejection of the underdetermination thesis. Yet\nconsider, more fully now, what Latour writes in his characterisation of\nBloor\u2019s position: \u2018electrons \u201cthemselves\u201d are not allowed to cause our\ninterpretations of them, no matter how much scientists engage in making\nthem have a bearing, a causality, on what they (the scientists) say about\nthem (the electrons).\u201952 This cannot be a straightforward description of\nscientists\u2019 receptivity towards electrons. Although he argues, on the one\nhand, that electrons cause our interpretations of them, he also argues,\non the other, that scientists make them exercise that causation. Electrons\nmake us know them as what they are, because we make them make us\nknow them thus. It looks, then, like Latour\u2019s \u2018new active nonhumans\u2019 owe\nmuch of their activity to humans. Electrons do not, after all, sufficiently\ndetermine our interpretations of them. Our epistemic relation to them\nis not sufficiently determined by our receptivity towards them, but\nonly by a combination of both receptivity and constructivity. Because\nLatour\u2019s account does not eliminate constructivity, it does not threaten\nthe underdetermination thesis.\n51 L atour (1992), \u2018One More Turn after the Social Turn\u2026,\u2019 p. 284.\n52 L atour (1992), \u2018One More Turn after the Social Turn\u2026,\u2019 p. 119. 3. Finitude, Humility, and the Bloor-Latour Debate 139\nOn Latour\u2019s account, we receive what we construct. Our\ninterpretations are based on our reception of physical effects whose\ncausal conditions we have played a necessary role in constructing.\nThere appears to be no room here for an independently existing\nnature. In abandoning the \u2018boring inactive things-in-themselves of the\nrealist\u2019s plot,\u2019 Latour appears to have given up on realism entirely. As\nI argued in Chapter Two, this is the price paid for failing to recognise\nthe distinction between the existence and essence of a thing. Like\nRouse, Latour elides the construction of the essence of a thing with the\nconstruction of its existence. One may thus describe Latour\u2019s position\nas a kind of \u2018pragmatic idealism.\u2019 Here the governing idea is that no\nthing can exist independently of our practical activities, both linguistic\nand otherwise. The independently existing thing-in-itself disappears in\nan endless cycle of interpretation, or what Latour has elsewhere called\n\u2018circulating reference.\u201953 Latour\u2019s rejection of independent existence thus\nseems to undermine Bloor, Collins, and Yearley\u2019s suggestion that Latour\nis a naive realist. It would be more accurate to say that naive realism is\nexpressed in Latour\u2019s rhetoric, but that his methodology pushes him\nmore towards idealism. The crucial point, for the present argument,\nis that Latour\u2019s abandonment of realism pulls the rug out from under\nhis argument against underdetermination. For once one allows that no\nthing can exist independently of our relations to it, one can no longer\nintelligibly assert that an independently existing thing can sufficiently\ndetermine our interpretations of it. Notwithstanding agile rhetorical\nperformances to the contrary, one cannot have one\u2019s cake and eat it too.54\n53 B runo Latour (1999b), Pandora\u2019s Hope: Essays on the Reality of Science Studies\n(Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press), p. 24. For a critique of Latour on\n\u2018circulating reference,\u2019 which also addresses his rejection of Kantian epistemology,\nsee Kochan (2015b), \u2018Putting a Spin on Circulating Reference.\u2019\n54 O ne can, however, have one\u2019s cake at one moment, and then eat it at another. In 1987,\nLatour described science as \u2018two-faced\u2019: on the one side, \u2018science in the making,\u2019 on\nthe other, \u2018made science.\u2019 In a controversy, scientists speak a constructivist language,\nbut, once the controversy has been settled, they speak a realist language. There\nis no contradiction, because the respective contexts of the languages are different\n(Bruno Latour (1987), Science in Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers through\nSociety (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press), p. 4). Fifteen years later,\nLatour claimed to be justified in speaking both languages, but he also seemed to\nelide the contextual difference between them (Bruno Latour (2002), \u2018The Science\nWars: A Dialogue,\u2019 Common Knowledge 8(1), 71\u201379 (p. 77)). The Millikan-Ehrenhaft\ncontroversy is a case of science in the making, and so one would expect Latour to\nuse a constructivist language when referring to it. Indeed, although he may have 140 Science as Social Existence\nOne final point deserves mention before we finally lay the Bloor-\nLatour debate to rest. The fact that Latour treats electrons as thoroughly\nconstructed things would seem to support my earlier observation that\nhis position offends against the Kantian doctrine of humility. For Latour,\nthere exists nothing about which we cannot have knowledge, because\nwe know only what we make, and all existent things depend on our\nconstructive power. Here, Latour may respond that we only partially\nconstruct things, and so we know them only partially. But this will not\ndeflect the criticism. The core realist doctrine is that of independent\nexistence. Even if the thing-in-itself is only partially the result of our\nconstructive power, then it does not exist independently of that power,\nand hence it cannot provide the grounds for a genuinely realist position.\nThere are no \u2018lonely\u2019 things in Latour\u2019s ontology, nothing to mark the\nfinite limits of our constructive power. Latour\u2019s argument against social\nconstructivism nicely demonstrates how, when minimal realism is\nrejected, then so too is epistemic humility. I have recommended minimal\nrealism as a suitable position for science studies. It follows from this\nthat a minimally realist science studies should also adopt an attitude of\nepistemic humility.\n8. The Humility of Science Studies\nIf finitude is best met with an attitude of humility, then social\nconstructivism should adopt an attitude of humility. Indeed, insofar\nas minimal realism presupposes the finitude of our indigenous\nconstructive powers, this realism suggests a methodological\ncommitment to humility. Resisting the temptation to believe that we can\nleap beyond the natural limits of our understanding is no small matter.\nAs we saw in the case of Latour, metaphysically fuelled ambition may\noverride humility and derail realism. But, as we also saw in Chapter\nOne, even the more restrained SSK practitioners sometimes overstep\nthe boundaries of their methodological commitments and thus threaten\ntheir realist credentials. David Bloor, for example, observes that the\nfound it rhetorically expedient to also use realist language in debating this case\nwith Bloor, the inertia of his own established methodology, and the logical weight\nof his own earlier distinction between the two contexts, ultimately returns him to a\nconstructivist language. 3. Finitude, Humility, and the Bloor-Latour Debate 141\nways in which we conceptualise our experience will always involve\na simplification of that experience, and infers from this that nature is\nenormously complex.55 This inference seems to presuppose that the\nenormous diversity of possible ways in which human beings come to\nunderstand their experience of nature must somehow correspond to the\nenormous complexity of nature itself. But this attribution of a specific,\nintrinsic property to nature \u2014 complexity \u2014 seems to contradict Bloor\u2019s\nclaim that our categories of understanding do not map onto nature itself\nin this way. The trouble here is that any claim to know nature in itself\nseems to violate epistemic finitude. We are finite knowers because we\nmust be affected by nature in order to gain knowledge of it. But the\nconcepts we apply in making sense of our experience are constructions\nprojected onto nature rather than affections received from it. This goes\ntoo for the concept of complexity. It seems that the only attribution\nwe may make with respect to nature itself is a purely privative one.\nNature provides no ready-made categories by which we could know\nit, because it has no determinate properties of its own. Hence, it would\nseem more accurate to describe nature as incomprehensible rather than\nas enormously complex. The tremendously diverse ways in which we\ncome to understand nature is not indicative of the inherent complexity\nof nature itself, but rather of the immense richness of our nevertheless\nfinite constructive power. This point would appear to agree with Bloor\u2019s\ncomment that \u2018[t]here is much that has been achieved with our finite\nand contingent resources.\u201956\nHeidegger argues that autonomous things, things left to themselves,\n\u2018lonely\u2019 things, as Langton puts it, are \u2018essentially devoid of any meaning\nat all.\u201957 From a phenomenological perspective, in an unconstructed\nexperience of things we encounter those things as incomprehensible.\nWe fail to make sense of them within the constructive field of finite\ninterpretative possibilities available to us. What is more, Heidegger also\nsuggests that things may directly assault and disrupt this constructive\nfield of possibilities. In such cases, things are not just without meaning,\nbut they also act against meaning, that is to say, against our ability to\n55 B loor (1999a), \u2018Anti-Latour,\u2019 p. 90.\n56 D avid Bloor (2007), \u2018Epistemic Grace: Antirelativism as Theology in Disguise,\u2019\nCommon Knowledge 13(2\u20133), 250\u201380 (p. 250).\n57 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 193 [152]. 142 Science as Social Existence\ncomprehend them. He writes, for example, that \u2018natural events [\u2026] can\nbreak in upon us and destroy us.\u201958 This observation suggests that the\nthings of nature may startle or shock us in a way which disrupts, or\nperhaps even destroys, our constructive power of understanding. In\nsuch moments, we are reduced to pure receptivity. Nature affects us we\nknow not how.\nHeidegger uses the German word Befindlichkeit to name our\nreceptivity, our ability to be affected by an independently existing\nnature. Hence, Kant\u2019s distinction between receptivity and constructivity\nmay be viewed as resurfacing in Heidegger as a distinction between\naffectivity and constructivity. Befindlichkeit denotes the situation or state\nin which one finds oneself, as in \u2018I found myself increasingly worried\nabout the future\u2019 or \u2018I found myself suddenly cheered by the passing\nfestivities.\u2019 In Heidegger scholarship, the standard translation for\nBefindlichkeit is \u2018state of mind,\u2019 but Hubert Dreyfus has also translated\nit as \u2018affectedness.\u2019 I prefer to translate it as \u2018affectivity.\u201959 Befindlichkeit\nderives from the reflexive verb sich befinden, which means \u2018to be here\u2019\nor \u2018to be located here.\u2019 It thus has a tight connection with Heidegger\u2019s\nword for the subject, Dasein, or \u2018being here.\u2019 Recall from Chapter One\nthat, according to Heidegger, the subject always finds itself in the world;\none of its fundamental existential features is being-in-the-world. As we\nalso noted, in Chapter Two, Heidegger gives an equally fundamental\nrole to being-with-others in his account of the subject. To already be in\nthe world means to also already be together with other persons in that\nworld. Being-in-the-world is, in other words, a fundamentally social\nphenomenon. In constructively understanding the entities \u2014 persons\nand things \u2014 with whom and alongside which it exists, the subject also\nalready finds itself receptively oriented towards those entities. Hence,\nthe affectivity of the subject is, for Heidegger, another fundamental\naspect of its existence. Indeed, altogether Heidegger notes at least four\nbasic existential elements of subjectivity: being-in-the-world; being-\nwith-others; affectivity; and constructivity (or projective understanding).\n58 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 193 [152].\n59 H ubert L. Dreyfus (1991b), Being-in-the-World: A Commentary on Heidegger\u2019s Being\nand Time, Division I (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press), chpt. 10. \u2018Affectivity\u2019 better\ncaptures the connotation of activity in Befindlichkeit. 3. Finitude, Humility, and the Bloor-Latour Debate 143\nLet us now consider the way in which worldly things may disrupt\nthe subject\u2019s constructive attempts to make sense of them. Following\nHeidegger on this point will help us to also better understand how his\nviews relate to the notion of epistemic humility. One particular shape\ntaken by affectivity, one specific state of mind, to which Heidegger\ngives considerable attention, is anxiety. Heidegger writes that \u2018[t]hat\nin the face of which one is anxious is completely indefinite.\u201960 It is not,\nhowever, the indefiniteness of things themselves which causes our\nanxiety, but the indefiniteness of our existence as being-in-the-world.\nHeidegger suggests that it is in the face of our own indefinite existence\nthat we feel anxious. Normally, we make sense of our own existence\nthrough our dealings with the things and persons with which and\nwith whom we share our world. According to Heidegger, when those\ndealings break down, things \u2018slip away\u2019: \u2018We can get no hold on things.\nIn the slipping away of beings only this \u201cno hold on things\u201d comes over\nus and remains.\u201961 The idea seems to be that, in such situations, which\nHeidegger notes happen \u2018rarely enough and only for a moment,\u2019 our\nconstructive power fails to get a hold on things and determine their\nmeaning, which is to say, their essence or whatness.62 As a consequence,\nwe lose our ability to give meaning to the world and to our place in\nit. In situations like these, our constructive power is deflected back\nfrom things, and our relation to those things thus becomes entirely\ndetermined by our receptivity towards them.63 Heidegger observes\nthat, in this forcing back of our understanding, things suddenly reveal\nthemselves as strange and \u2018radically other.\u201964\nThis returns us to the claim made by Joseph Fell, discussed in Chapter\nTwo, that Heidegger uses the term \u2018present-at-hand\u2019 in a handful of\ndistinct ways. In particular, we saw that Heidegger uses \u2018present-at-\nhand\u2019 not just to denote a thing which has been thematised as an object,\nbut also a thing which has suddenly become \u2018unhandy\u2019 through a local\nbreakdown in a global context of practical involvements which have\n60 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 231 [186].\n61 M artin Heidegger (1993a [1978]), \u2018What Is Metaphysics?,\u2019 trans. by David Farrell\nKrell, in Basic Writings, revised and expanded edn, by Martin Heidegger, ed. by\nDavid Farrell Krell (New York: HarperCollins), pp. 93\u2013110 (p. 100).\n62 H eidegger (1993a), \u2018What Is Metaphysics?,\u2019 p. 100.\n63 C f.

As Fell writes, \u2018this is the experience\nof a presentness at hand that was already there but which in my practical\npreoccupation I was simply not attending to.\u201965 Yet Fell also argues that\nthe term \u2018present-at-hand\u2019 may refer to things in cases where there is a\nglobal breakdown of the significance relations which give meaning to\nthings in the world.66 In such cases, the subject finds itself in a state\nof anxiety before the unintelligibility of that world, an anxiety which\nreveals the brute contingency of the categories it normally takes for\ngranted when making sense of both things and other people. These\nthings now lose their taken-for-granted meaning, becoming strange. I\nwould like to suggest that this strange and alien thing is the thing-in-\nitself as construed by Heidegger. As such, it marks the epistemic limit of\nour constructive power, and hence of our ability to make sense of, much\nless to know, nature. The thing-in-itself thus marks the boundaries of\nour finitude, and hence moves us towards humility. A breakdown\nin intelligibility, especially at the global level, thus reveals the sheer\ncontingency of our categories of understanding. They no longer fix\nthemselves onto things, but are instead driven back from them, an event\nwhich disrupts our ability to make sense of nature, which unsettles our\ntaken-for-granted assumptions about what nature in itself is, and which\nmay be experienced as a state of anxiety. In the last but one section,\nwe saw that Heidegger describes transcendence as the surpassing of\nan independently existing nature. We can now add that, for Heidegger,\nour recognition of this transcendence, for example, our recognition that\nthe objecthood of a thing is not intrinsic to it but something we project\nonto it, may be accompanied by a feeling of anxiety. The anxiety which\nmay follow on our realisation of the contingency of the categories by\nwhich we make sense of the world is an affective recognition of our\nepistemic finitude, and hence a reason for humility.\nThe main point to draw out of this is that the notion of the thing-in-\nitself is not, for Heidegger, a merely theoretical one. It is also the notion\nof a thing alongside which we live in the world, a thing which we may,\nif only rarely and momentarily, experience in its bare existence when\n65 J oseph P. Fell (1989), \u2018The Familiar and the Strange: On the Limits of Praxis in the\nEarly Heidegger,\u2019 in Heidegger and Praxis, ed. by Thomas J.

Finitude, Humility, and the Bloor-Latour Debate 145\nour customary patterns of sense-making are momentarily disturbed, or,\nmore dramatically, when we find ourselves in a state of global existential\ndisturbance. If Heidegger\u2019s phenomenological analysis of anxiety is\ncorrect, then it would seem to lend some empirical weight to the notion\nof the thing-in-itself as lacking intrinsic properties of its own, and hence\nalso to the more general notion of a nature which exists independently\nof the categories we normally use to understand it.\nIn fact, there is clinical evidence suggesting that Heidegger\u2019s analysis\nof anxiety offers a credible description of a genuine human experience\nwhich may, in some rare cases, become pathological. Russell Nieli, for\nexample, argues that Heidegger is describing a radical kind of alienation\nexperience, falling under the psychiatric labels of \u2018derealization\u2019 and\n\u2018depersonalization,\u2019 which attracted the attention of psychiatrists and\npsychologist around the turn of the last century.67 As illustrations of\nthis kind of experience, he cites representative patients\u2019 statements from\nWilliam James\u2019s 1890 book, The Principles of Psychology \u2014 \u2018I looked about\nme with terror and astonishment: the world was escaping from me\u2019 \u2014 and\nKarl Jaspers\u2019s 1913 study, General Psychopathology \u2014 \u2018All objects appear\nso new and startling, I say their names over to myself and touch them\nseveral times to convince myself they are real.\u201968\nFor Heidegger, such unsettling experiences of the world or of objects\nare experiences of our own existence, because the meaning of things\nis a product of our constructive power, and the world, as we saw in\nChapter One, is internally related to our existence as being-in-the-\nworld. Hence, Heidegger wrote that, with the alienation experienced\nin anxiety, \u2018[b]eing-in enters into the existential \u201cmode\u201d of the \u201cnot-\nat-home [das Un-zuhause],\u201d\u2019 and, more to the point, that \u2018[i]n anxiety\none feels \u201cuncanny\u201d [unheimlich].\u201969 This recalls Sigmund Freud\u2019s\n1919 essay, \u2018The \u201cUncanny,\u201d\u2019 where he wrote that \u2018[t]he German\nword \u201cunheimlich\u201d is obviously the opposite of \u201cheimlich\u201d [\u201chomely\u201d],\n\u201cheimisch\u201d [\u201cnative\u201d] \u2014 the opposite of what is familiar [\u2026].

By marking the limit of our constructive power, anxiety brings us\nface-to-face with our own inherent finitude.\nMore recently, the American Psychiatric Association, while tacitly\ninvoking an ontology rejected by Heidegger, has described derealisation\nas \u2018the sense that the external world is strange or unreal,\u2019 and they\ndesignate it as a common symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder\n(PTSD).71 The Heidegger-influenced psychiatrist Patrick Bracken, in\nturn, argues that traumatic experiences may lead to \u2018ruptured meanings\u2019\nwhich signal the disintegration of one\u2019s world: \u2018The experience of\nvery frightening events can have the effect of shattering any sense of\nliving in an orderly world that has inherent structures of meaning and\norder.\u201972 Global manifestations of this phenomenon have been noted\nespecially among combat veterans. Russian psychologist Madrudin\nMagomed-Eminov writes that veterans of the Soviet war in Afghanistan\nsuffered a \u2018loss of meaning to life\u2019 precipitating a general \u2018existential\ncrisis.\u201973 Bracken, for his part, cites part of the following passage from\nUS Vietnam War veteran Tim O\u2019Brien\u2019s 1990 short story collection The\nThings They Carried.74 O\u2019Brien writes that \u2018war has the feel \u2014 the spiritual\ntexture \u2014 of a great ghostly fog, thick and permanent.\u2019 He continues:\nThere is no clarity. Everything swirls. The old rules are no longer binding;\nthe old truths are no longer true. Right spills into wrong.

Finitude, Humility, and the Bloor-Latour Debate 147\nSimilar experiences were common among soldiers during the First\nWorld War (1914\u20131918). According to the German Army Medical Service,\n613,047 German soldiers were treated during the war for \u2018diseases of\nthe nervous system.\u201976 In the decade following the war, the continued\nsuffering of traumatised veterans became an issue dominating national\ndebate. The affected veterans were overwhelmingly from the lower\neconomic strata, and they saw themselves increasingly medicalised\nand blamed for their condition.77 Pressured from the right, the\ngovernment\u2019s labour ministry gradually cut pensions and health care\nto psychologically disabled veterans, causing widespread resentment.78\nIt would be extraordinary if Heidegger had been unaffected by these\nevents, during which period he was developing his existential account of\nanxiety. I do not mean to suggest that he deliberately shaped his account\nin response to these events, but that these events may have provided\nthe social conditions in which anxiety could emerge as a compelling\nresource in the development of his phenomenology of human existence\nand his views on the independent existence of nature. I know of no\nevidence that Heidegger, who was himself exempted from combat duty\non medical grounds, sympathised with the plight of the traumatised\nveterans, and, as Michael Zimmerman has shown, there are reasons to\nthink that he emphatically did not.79 Nevertheless, in Heidegger\u2019s hands,\nanxiety was stripped of its psychiatric meaning and reconceptualised as\n76 D oris Kaufman (1999), \u2018Science as Cultural Practice: Psychiatry in the First World\nWar and Weimar Germany,\u2019 Journal of Contemporary History 34(1), 125\u201344 (p. 125).\n77 G eorge L.

Even J\u00fcnger\u2019s\ncelebrated steely nerves had their limits, however. Recounting one battlefield\nexperience, he writes: \u2018after a moment\u2019s blank horror I took to my heels like the\nrest and ran aimlessly into the night.\u2019 Later, \u2018I threw myself on the ground and\nbroke into convulsive sobs\u2019 (Ernst J\u00fcnger (1929), The Storm of Steel, trans. by Basil\nCreighton (London: Chatto & Windus), pp. 245, 246). Those whose front-line\ncombat experience is merely vicarious have the privilege of celebrating the heroics\nand ignoring the horrors. 148 Science as Social Existence\nan existential relation to an independent nature which slips free from\nthe categories by which we attempt to make sense of it.\nThe social psychologist, James Averill, describes emotions in general\nas social constructions, and he suggests that they are thus a legitimate\ntopic for the sociology of knowledge. Specifically, Averill argues that\nmost standard emotions are \u2018institutionalized patterns of response,\u2019\nwhich presuppose \u2018highly structured cognitive systems.\u201980 He contrasts\nthese standardised emotional responses to the responses symptomatic\nof anxiety, of which a cardinal feature is \u2018cognitive disintegration.\u2019\nFrom the viewpoint of SSK, however, Averill has the relation between\ncognitive order and institutional order backwards. As Bracken rightly\nargues, it would, in fact, be better to say that highly structured cognitive\nsystems presuppose institutionalised patterns of emotional response.\nHence, when there is a significant disturbance in these institutionalised\npatterns, the result may be the kind of cognitive disintegration marked\nby a feeling of anxiety. A broken mind does not result in a broken world.\nThe causal relation runs the other way around.\nHeidegger viewed anxiety as a characteristic emotional response to\ndisruptions in the coherence relations which normally obtain between\nourselves and the things and persons with which and with whom we\ninhabit and share a world. This disturbance correlates with a breakdown\nin the constructive power by which we make sense of that world. When\nthat failure is catastrophic, this power loses its grip on things in general\nand is thrown back onto itself. The result is a global breakdown in\nmeaning, an experience wherein we encounter things-in-themselves\nin what Heidegger called their \u2018empty mercilessness.\u201981 I have argued\nthat Heidegger\u2019s phenomenological description of such failures of\nmeaning, his description of anxiety, offers a potential account of the\nway in which we may experience nature as existing independently of\nthe categories by which we normally come to know and productively\ninteract with it. On this account, anxiety emerges as a direct consequence\n80 James R.

Finitude, Humility, and the Bloor-Latour Debate 149\nof our epistemic finitude; it is the unsettling realisation that the basic\ncategories structuring our understanding of nature do not pick out\nanything intrinsic to nature itself. Anxiety is the state in which we find\nourselves when confronted with the existential fact of our finitude. The\nappropriate response to this inescapable existential fact is to adopt an\nattitude of epistemic humility.\n9. Conclusion\nIn this chapter, I have argued that the minimal realism proposed in\nChapter Two presupposes the finitude of human reason. That an\nindependent nature always exists beyond the reach of our constructive\npower, that nature itself must always slip free from all attempts to\ndetermine its intrinsic properties, is a basic presupposition motivating\nthe core realist doctrine that things exist independently of any practical\nand theoretical interactions we may have with them. I have furthermore\nsuggested that recognition of our own inherent limitations vis-\u00e0-vis\nknowledge of nature is best met with an attitude of epistemic humility.\nThis argument was played out in the context of the well-known\ndebate between David Bloor and Bruno Latour. I have presented the\ndisagreement between Bloor and Latour as a debate over the appropriate\nattitude science studies should take towards the Kantian thing-in-itself.\nThe thing-in-itself stands for the independent existence of nature. Latour\ndismisses the thing-in-itself as irrelevant to explanations of scientific\nknowledge. Bloor, by contrast, consequentially modifies Kant\u2019s\noriginal concept, replacing Kant\u2019s transcendental and individualistic\nformulation with a naturalistic and sociological one. As a consequence,\nLatour\u2019s attempt to dismiss Bloor\u2019s social constructivism as being in\nhock to the Kantian notion of the thing-in-itself, with all of its incumbent\ndifficulties, largely fails. Bloor\u2019s treatment of the thing-in-itself is\nnaturalistic and causal, and, as such, it is compatible with minimal\nrealism. I have furthermore argued that Latour, for all his rhetorical\naffirmations of realism, is most coherently read as methodologically\ncommitted to a position of pragmatic idealism: things are constructed\nand only exist within fields of practice. On Latour\u2019s account, minimal\nrealism evaporates along with the independently existing thing-in-itself\nentailed by such realism. 150 Science as Social Existence\nAccording to Rae Langton, Kant introduced the notion of the thing-\nin-itself in recognition of the finitude of human knowledge. Because\nour knowledge is finite, nature will always exist independently of our\nattempts to know it. Langton suggests that this finitude provides good\ngrounds for adopting an attitude of epistemic humility. I have developed\nan account of epistemic humility through a discussion of Heidegger\u2019s\nown appropriation of Kant\u2019s notion of the thing-in-itself. Heidegger\nreconstrues the thing-in-itself in terms of an independently existing\nand indeterminate nature which may, on occasion, deflect our attempts\nto determine what it is according to our own indigenous constructive\npowers. Heidegger\u2019s treatment of Kant, I have suggested, is compatible\nwith that of Bloor. This treatment also reveals the way in which Latour\u2019s\nrejection of the thing-in-itself fits together with his enthusiasm for an\nunrestrained constructivism which oversteps finitude, and so undercuts\nhumility, in its denial of an independently existing nature. This failure\nof humility is, perhaps, most strongly exemplified in Latour\u2019s conviction\nthat he has successfully abandoned the subject-object distinction and\n\u2018headed off in a different direction.\u201982 But this distinction is not like a\nsuitcase to be dropped off at the hotel before one dashes out to see\nthe sights of a new and exciting city. Neither is it just a few words to\nbe summarily excised from language. It is a structure in our thinking\nwhich has developed over centuries and with which we must live as a\npart of our cultural inheritance. This is our condition as finite, historical,\nand social beings. The only way to gain a free relation to the subject-\nobject distinction, and the broader existential and conceptual structures\nwhich sustain it, is to trace the historical threads which weave it into the\ntaken-for-granted patterns of our thinking. As we will see in Chapter\nFour, this was a task towards which Heidegger put much effort.\n82 Latour (1999b), Pandora\u2019s Hope, p. 295. Chapter Four\nThings, Thinking, and the Social\nFoundations of Logic\n1. Introduction\nIn Chapter Three, I argued that the doctrine of the independent existence\nof things, as the basis for a minimal realism, is inextricably bound up\nwith the fact that human knowledge is inherently limited. The idea that\nthings possess an independent existence follows from the recognition\nthat our epistemic capabilities are irremediably finite. Chapter Three\nwas primarily concerned with the independent existence of things.\nThis chapter will be oriented more towards epistemic finitude, or more\nspecifically, the finitude of what I will call \u2018thinking.\u2019 Thinking was a\nfundamental concept for Heidegger, and he meant it in the broadest\npossible sense to include not just mental activity, conventionally\nconstrued, but all practical acts expressing the possession of knowledge.\nThinking is thus present not only in deliberative, propositionally\nstructured actions, but also in actions which are non-deliberative\nand non-propositional in nature. On this account, \u2018thinking\u2019 means\n\u2018cognitive activity,\u2019 that is, the activity of knowing. When we say that\nsomeone knows how to ride a bicycle in traffic, we need not claim that\nshe possesses propositionally structured knowledge of bike riding,\nknowledge which she may deliberatively apply in the performance\nitself. Heidegger\u2019s concept of thinking thus also encompasses skill. In\n\u00a9 Jeff Kochan, CC BY 4.0 http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0129.04 152 Science as Social Existence\nhis view, skilled performance entails a mode of thinking which need\nnot be articulable in propositional form. His concept of thinking thus\nappears similar to philosopher of science Ian Hacking\u2019s concept of\nreasoning. Hacking also attempts to stretch the term \u2018reasoning\u2019 beyond\nits conventional usage, so as to also include the embodied aspects of\npractical action, and he explicitly acknowledges the tension which arises\nwith such stretching: \u2018Even my word \u201creasoning\u201d has too much to do\nwith mind and mouth and keyboard; it does not, I regret, sufficiently\ninvoke the manipulative hand and attentive eye.\u20191 Hacking has more\nrecently rebranded his concept of reasoning as one of \u2018thinking and\ndoing\u2019 in an attempt to relieve some of this tension.2 According to\nHeidegger, thinking is always dependent on doing of some kind, and\ndoing, if it manifests the possession of knowledge, must also always\ninvolve thinking. Theory and practice thus go hand in hand, together\nwith mind and body.\nThis view sits at the core of Heidegger\u2019s phenomenological project\nof explaining the logical structure of scientific thinking in terms of its\nexistential foundations. As we saw in Chapter Two, Heidegger argued\nthat science, as a coherent body of logically interconnected propositions,\nderives from a specific mode of existence, namely, the specific ways in\nwhich scientists involve themselves with things and one another, and\nthe specific ways in which they come to understand their collective\ninvolvement with those things. In fact, Heidegger conceived of human\nexistence as being fundamentally structured by the relationship between\nthings and thinking, with scientific existence exemplifying a special\nmode of that relation. As we saw in Chapter One, this move provided\nhim with the means by which to deflect scepticism about the existence of\nan external world. Such scepticism presupposes an image of the subject\nas contained within a glass bulb, and asserts that thinking will never\npenetrate the wall of that bulb and thus never achieve epistemic access\nto the things from which it is separated. Heidegger, argued, in response,\nthat thinking is always already in relation to things, because being-in-\nthe-world is a fundamental structure of human existence. As we will see\n1 Ian Hacking (1992), \u2018\u201cStyle\u201d for Historians and Philosophers,\u2019 Studies in History and\nPhilosophy of Science 23, 1\u201320 (p. 3).\n2 Ian Hacking (2012), \u2018\u201cLanguage, Truth and Reason\u201d 30 Years Later,\u2019 Studies in\nHistory and Philosophy of Science 43(4), 599\u2013609 (p. 601). 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 153\nin this chapter, Heidegger furthermore argued that this fundamental\nrelation between things and thinking is always marked by a directedness\nof thinking towards things. This just means that thinking is a necessarily\nintentional phenomenon, that it is always a thinking about.\nHeidegger\u2019s attempt to elucidate the existential genesis of science\nas a body of logically interrelated propositions was an attempt to\ndelineate the way in which the relational phenomenon of intentionality\ncame to be specified as a relation between thinking, construed as\nthe propositionally structured act of a mental substance, and a\nthing, construed as a property-bearing substance. Heidegger thus\ndescribed the existential genesis of science as a historical process by\nwhich intentionality became increasingly specified according to the\nmodel of the proposition.3 According to Heidegger, this was to have\na profound influence on the way both things and thinking came to be\nunderstood in the philosophical tradition. In particular, thinking itself\ncame to be identified with logic, and all legitimate forms of thinking,\nincluding scientific thinking, were then viewed as ultimately grounded\nin logic. Heidegger noted that this conclusion leads to the circular\nargument that science, as a logically structured body of knowledge, is\nitself grounded in logic. Logic grounds logic. Heidegger\u2019s alternative\nargument that science, and hence also logic, is grounded in the informal,\npre-propositional structures of existence was his attempt to soften this\ncircularity.\nIn this chapter, we will first consider Heidegger\u2019s account of the\nhistorical process by which scientific thinking came to be viewed as\nultimately governed by self-validating rules of logic, and then link this\naccount to more recent work in the sociology of scientific knowledge\n(SSK). By historicising the prevailing logical picture of scientific thinking,\nHeidegger sought to loosen up intuitions about its apparent necessity,\nand thus to prepare readers for his own phenomenological alternative.\nIt must be emphasised that, in doing so, Heidegger was not promoting\nan irrationalist or anti-logical theory of science. Indeed, Heidegger was\n3 In an interpretation otherwise quite different from my own, Hans-J\u00f6rg Rheinberger\nalso emphasises the deeply historical nature of Heidegger\u2019s account of science,\nwith particular attention to Heidegger\u2019s preoccupation with the material aspect of\nmodern science (Hans-J\u00f6rg Rheinberger (2010b), On Historicizing Epistemology: An\nEssay (Stanford: Stanford University Press)). This material aspect will take centre\nstage in Chapter Six. 154 Science as Social Existence\ninstead motivated by a sense of distress at the failure of the orthodox\naccount to provide a foundation for science as a cultural enterprise.\nIn this, he was of one mind with many of his Central European\ncontemporaries during the interwar period. Describing the situation in\nWeimar Germany, Paul Forman has written that such feelings of distress\nwere \u2018widespread among the educated middle classes, but especially\noppressive in academia.\u2019 These were unsettling feelings of \u2018moral and\nintellectual crisis, a crisis of culture, a crisis of science and scholarship.\u20194\nForman argues that Weimar intellectuals felt compelled to address the\nperceived crisis in order to maintain their own credibility, and this often\nled them to \u2018repudiate the traditional methods and doctrines of [their]\ndiscipline.\u20195\nA striking example of this circumstance was Heidegger\u2019s mentor\nEdmund Husserl. Husserl sought to address what he too called \u2018the crisis\nof science\u2019 through the methods of transcendental phenomenology.6\nFor him, phenomenology provided the methodological means by\nwhich to finally establish philosophy as a \u2018rigorous science.\u20197 This\nrigorously scientific philosophy was meant to ground all the other\nsciences, including the scientific philosophy of the mathematical\nlogicians, whose own attempts to ground science in a self-sufficient\nlogic Husserl dismissed as \u2018nothing but na\u00efvet\u00e9.\u20198 Contrasting his own\ndeclaredly more radical phenomenological science to the scientific\nproject of mathematical logicians, Husserl contended that \u2018[o]nly when\nthis radical, fundamental science exists can such a logic itself become a\nscience.\u20199 Science was thus not to be grounded in a self-sufficient logic,\nbut rather in the pre-logical phenomena which Husserl sought to expose\nthrough the methods of his transcendental phenomenology.10\n4 Paul Forman (1971), \u2018Weimar Culture, Causality, and Quantum Theory, 1918\u20131927:\nAdaptation by German Physicists and Mathematicians to a Hostile Intellectual\nEnvironment,\u2019 Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences 3, 1\u2013115 (p. 26).\n5 Forman (1971), \u2018Weimar Culture, Causality, and Quantum Theory,\u2019 p. 28.\n6 Edmund Husserl (1970), The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental\nPhenomenology, trans. by David Carr (Evanston: Northwestern University Press), p. 3.\n7 Edmund Husserl (1965), \u2018Philosophy as Rigorous Science,\u2019 trans. by Quentin Lauer,\nin Phenomenology and the Crisis of Philosophy, by Edmund Husserl (New York:\nHarperCollins), pp. 71\u2013147.\n8 Husserl (1970), Crisis of European Sciences, p. 141.\n9 Husserl (1970), Crisis of European Sciences, p. 141.\n10 For discussions of Husserl\u2019s philosophy of science see: Patrick Heelan (1987),\n\u2018Husserl\u2019s Later Philosophy of Natural Science,\u2019 Philosophy of Science 54 (3), 368\u201390; 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 155\nIt is clear that Heidegger\u2019s ambitions closely tracked those of his\nformer mentor. Indeed, Heidegger too argued that phenomenological\nresearch represents \u2018nothing less than the more explicit and more radical\nunderstanding of the idea of scientific philosophy.\u201911 Furthermore,\nHeidegger also described his phenomenological method as a\n\u2018transcendental science.\u201912 Yet Heidegger\u2019s concept of the transcendental\ndiffered profoundly from that of Husserl. As discussed in Chapter\nThree, Heidegger rejected the Kantian notion of the transcendental\nsubject, replacing it instead with the finitude of human existence as\nbeing-in-the-world. Because the subject is already in the world, it does\nnot need to transcend its indigenous condition in order to make contact\nwith that world. Indeed, on Heidegger\u2019s account, transcendence is not\ntranscendence towards things in the world, but instead away from them\nand towards the existential possibilities which inevitably structure\nour everyday projective understanding of the things as we typically\nencounter them. For Heidegger, then, phenomenology as transcendental\nscience meant a scientific investigation of the structures of possibility\ngiving shape to actual acts of thinking. As we will see in this chapter,\nHeidegger located the conditions of possibility for thinking, including\nlogical thinking, in the finite, historical existence of human beings.\nHusserl, in contrast, urged a conception of transcendental subjectivity\nwhich saw the human being escaping the finite conditions of worldly\nexistence on the basis of an \u2018immortal\u2019 human spirit.13 Not only did\nDavid Hyder and Hans-J\u00f6rg Rheinberger, eds.

In Heidegger\u2019s view, overcoming both the philosophical\ndoctrine of immortal, or infinite, reason, as well as the propositional\nmodel of thinking on which it is partly based, entails a deconstruction\nof the philosophical orthodoxy back to its origins in Plato. This chapter\nrecounts some of the key moments in Heidegger\u2019s deconstruction of that\northodoxy, framing it as an attempt to ground logic, and thus science\nin general, in the pre-propositional and ineluctably finite structures of\nhuman existence.\nHeidegger was careful not to commit the self-defeating error of\nclaiming a transcendental (in the orthodox sense) viewpoint from which\nto declare the historical contingency of thinking as such. In fact, he\nopenly admitted that the \u2018investigation which we are now conducting\nis determined by its historical situation [\u2026] and by the preceding\nphilosophical tradition.\u201914 However, his reaction to this predicament\nwas not a studied complacency regarding the historical origins of\nhis own basic concepts. Rather, he sought to articulate a historical\naccount of the contingency of those concepts by deconstructing them\n\u2018down to the sources from which they were drawn.\u201915 By analysing\nthe conventionalised concepts of modern philosophy as the historical\nactualisation of a tradition construed in terms of possibilities, Heidegger\naimed not only to demonstrate the contingency of the basic concepts of\nmodern formalised logic, but also the legitimacy of his own existential\nphenomenology both as an expression of possibilities latent in the\nphilosophical tradition and as being better equipped than formal logic\nto provide a defensible foundation for the sciences.\nThe explicit reflexivity of Heidegger\u2019s method, his recognition that\nthe legitimacy of his own concepts was also historically contingent,\nstrongly resonates with SSK\u2019s reflexivity tenet. This tenet states that\nSSK\u2019s \u2018patterns of explanation would have to be applicable to sociology\nitself [\u2026] otherwise sociology would be a standing refutation of\n14 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 22.\n15 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 23. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 157\nitself.\u201916 However, as we already well know from earlier chapters, the\nsimilarity between the two methods does not end there. Indeed, like\nHeidegger, SSK practitioners have applied their method extensively in\nan investigation of the foundations of logic. In the latter part of this\nchapter, the methods of each will be compared. Both parties embrace a\ndoctrine of finitude, and hence reject the contrary notions of an immortal\nspirit, an unbounded reason, an infinite faculty of thinking, and the like.\nBoth also grant priority to informal over formalised modes of thinking.\nThe benefits of this comparison run in both directions. On the one hand,\nHeidegger had little to offer by way of detailed empirical illustrations\nof the contingency and informal basis of logical thinking. SSK can thus\nhelp to fill out Heidegger\u2019s theoretical account with empirical studies.\nOn the other hand, Heidegger\u2019s work can help to untangle some\nconceptual knots in the sociology of logic. In particular, Heidegger\u2019s\nphenomenological description of different modes of intentionality\ncan put into SSK practitioners\u2019 hands a non-propositional account of\nintentionality which is compatible with their own naturalistic and causal\naccount of knowledge. This promises to save SSK practitioners from\nthe difficulties which threaten to follow from their outright rejection\nof intentionality as a legitimate explanatory resource. Before plunging\ninto this comparative work, however, let us first take an extended tour\nthrough Heidegger\u2019s phenomenological history of logic.\n2. Heidegger on the Unity of Things and Thinking\nHeidegger argues that our concept of the thing as a property-bearing\nsubstance is necessarily related to our concept of thinking as possessing\na propositional structure. The property-bearing substance, on the one\nside, and proposition-based thinking, on the other, are \u2018mirror images\u2019\nof one another, and they share a \u2018deeper lying root.\u201917\nAs discussed in earlier chapters, for Heidegger the concepts of a\nproperty-bearing substance and a proposition-based thinking are not\nfoundational concepts, but derive from the more fundamental existential\n16 David Bloor (1991), Knowledge and Social Imagery, 2nd edn (Chicago: University of\nChicago Press), p. 7.\n17 Martin Heidegger (1967 [1962]), What Is a Thing?, trans. by William B. Barton, Jr.,\nand Vera Deutsch (Chicago: Henry Regnery), p. 47. 158 Science as Social Existence\nstructures of our subjectivity. In Chapter Two, we reviewed Heidegger\u2019s\nphenomenological analysis of propositional thinking as arising from\nan interruption or breakdown in the smooth, unreflective mode of\nthinking characteristic of our normal, everyday dealings in the world.\nAs we saw, this change-over of thinking from unreflective immersion to\npropositional reflection was accompanied by a corresponding transition\nin our experience of things within the world from things ready-to-hand\nto things present-at-hand, that is, to property-bearing substances, or\nobjects. In Chapter Three, we discussed Heidegger\u2019s interpretation of\nthe way Kant articulated this dialectical relationship between things and\nthinking. In particular, Heidegger credits Kant with the fundamental\ninsight that human thinking, as a finite faculty, entails the independent\nexistence of the things to which that thinking is directed. Kant called\nthis aspect of thinking, which follows from the fact of human finitude,\n\u2018receptivity.\u2019 Heidegger rephrased this as Befindlichkeit, which I translate\nas \u2018affectivity.\u2019 The receptivity of thinking means that thinking is always\na response, in one way or another, to things. In Heidegger\u2019s terminology,\nthinking is a basic feature of Dasein\u2019s existence, and that existence\nnecessarily takes place in a world of things. There can, in short, be no\nthinking, much less any knowledge, in the absence of experience. On the\nother hand, as was argued in Chapter Two, although we are, as thinking\nbeings, necessarily related to things, things do not in turn depend on\nus for their own existence. Things outstrip our ability to understand\nthem, and so demonstrate our finitude. This insight provides the basis\nfor minimal realism.\nHeidegger analyses the relation between things and thinking in terms\nof four components, with two on each side. The two components on the\nside of the thing are its existence and its essence, and the two components\non the side of thinking are its receptivity and its constructivity. In the\ncase of the first component of each, the relation runs from the thing, as\nexistent, to thinking, as receptive. In the case of the second component\nof each, the relation runs in the opposite direction, from thinking as\nconstructive, to the thing as possessed of determinate properties, as\nhaving an essence. As we have seen, Heidegger describes this second\nrelation as one of \u2018projection.\u2019 The idea is that, while the thing itself\ncan exist independently of thinking, its essence, articulated in terms\nof its properties, cannot. The thing has no properties in the absence of\nprojective thinking. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 159\nWe are now in a better position to understand what Heidegger\nmeans when he says that our concept of the thing as a property-bearing\nsubstance is necessarily related to our concept of thinking as possessing\na propositional structure. His argument is that the constructive\ncomponent of thinking must first be brought into a propositional form\nbefore we can begin to speak intelligibly about things as substances\nwith properties. In Chapter Two, we examined the stages Heidegger\nidentified in his phenomenological analysis of how thinking takes on\npropositional form in the act of thematising a ready-to-hand thing as a\npresent-at-hand object. The two crucial points we may draw from this\nanalysis, for present purposes, are that thinking is not fundamentally\npropositional in form, and that logic, as the science of thinking,\nprovides us with an only derivative account of what thinking is. In\nother words, the formal, propositional structure of thinking is not a\nfundamental structure discovered through logical enquiry. It is rather\na derivative structure which we construct in the course of thematising\nthinking as an object of investigation. One important implication of\nthis is that truth \u2014 as correspondence between a proposition and the\nindependently existing property of a substance \u2014 is a derivative form\nof truth. Truth, as correspondence, depends on a thematising project\nwhich simultaneously constructs thinking as a propositional act, on\nthe one hand, and the thing, towards which that act is directed, as a\nproperty-bearing substance, on the other.\nHeidegger argues that the orthodox attitude in philosophy, which\ntakes formal logic as the foundation of thinking and substance ontology\nas revealing the fundamental structure of things, is not absolutely valid,\nbut instead based on historically contingent presuppositions. We will\ngive more detailed attention to Heidegger\u2019s historical argument in the\nfollowing sections. Note for the time being, however, that Heidegger\ncalls the basic constructive relation of thinking to things, the inherent\ndirectedness of the former to the latter, \u2018intentionality.\u201918 Hence, the\nphenomenological study of constructivity may be viewed more\ngenerally as the study of intentionality. The basic phenomenological\nfeature of intentionality is its directedness towards something. An\nintentional act is a directed act. Heidegger often describes intentionality\nas the way in which the subject \u2018comports\u2019 itself towards things. In his\n18 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 58. 160 Science as Social Existence\nview, the orthodox attitude in philosophy takes for granted, and relies\non, a historically specific mode of intentionality. In Kant\u2019s philosophy,\nthis historical mode was conceptualised in terms of constructivity.\nHeidegger also refers to it as \u2018productive comportment.\u201919\nMuch of Heidegger\u2019s philosophy may be viewed as an exploration\nof the limits and the latent possibilities in the subject\u2019s productive\ncomportment towards things, or, put another way, an exploration of the\nlimits and possibilities of a philosophical tradition which understands\nintentionality by analogy to production. He argues that productive\ncomportment, as a fundamental but often unacknowledged concept\nin the philosophical tradition, is the source of the distinction between\nexistence and essence.20 The concept of production entails the prior\nexistence of material: \u2018If we bring to mind productive comportment in\nthe scope of its full structure we see that it always makes use of what we\ncall material, for instance, material for building a house.\u201921 Furthermore,\ngiven the intimate relation between the existence and essence of things,\non the one hand, and the receptivity and constructivity of thinking, on\nthe other, we can conclude that productive comportment also provides\na conceptual root for the relatedness of receptivity and constructivity,\nand thus for the relation between things and thinking in general. This,\nthen, provides the background for Heidegger\u2019s more narrow argument\nthat the property-bearing substance and proposition-based thinking\nare mirror images, sharing with one another an underlying root.\nIntentionality provides that underlying root. It serves to unify things\nand thinking, and has been traditionally construed by philosophers on\nthe model of production.\nThe key point here is that intentionality, as productive comportment,\nplays a unifying role in Heidegger\u2019s explanation of the relation between\nthings and thinking. Another point is that the analogy to production\nspecifies the meaning of intentionality as more than mere directedness.\nOn this construal, intentionality is directedness guided by a pre-existing\nstandard. As Heidegger writes, \u2018[a]ll forming of shaped products\nis effected by using an image, in the sense of a model, as guide and\n19 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 105.\n20 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 105.\n21 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 115. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 161\nstandard.\u201922 Putting these two points together, Heidegger\u2019s overall\nclaim is that the philosophical tradition interprets the phenomenon\nof intentionality as the experience of being guided by a pre-existing\nstandard, or image, such that one\u2019s thinking will come into proper\nrelationship with the things. As we will see in the next four sections,\nHeidegger traces the historical course of this model of intentionality\nfrom Plato\u2019s doctrine of the good, through Aristotle\u2019s categorial analysis\nof the proposition and Descartes\u2019s emphasis on the propositionally\nstructured subject \u2018I,\u2019 to Kant\u2019s phenomenological investigation of the\nimagination. This history of the concept of intentionality will, in turn,\nprepare the way for a detailed consideration, in Chapters Five and Six, of\nthe emergence of early-modern mathematical and experimental science.\nBut for now, let us take a look at Heidegger\u2019s phenomenological history\nof thinking as logic.23\n3. Heidegger\u2019s Phenomenological\nHistory of Logic: Plato\nHeidegger addresses the question of the historical relation between\nthings and thinking in the context of the development of logic as\nthe scientific study of thinking. By taking this approach, he aims to\nchallenge the orthodox view of logic as a free-floating and ultimate\nform of thinking, one which provides the grounds for all of the other\nsciences. For Heidegger, then, the attempt to unearth the foundations of\n22 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 106.\n23 For work addressing Heidegger\u2019s views on logic in the context of late-nineteenth\nand early-twentieth century developments, see: Albert Borgmann (1978),\n\u2018Heidegger and Symbolic Logic,\u2019 in Heidegger and Modern Philosophy, ed. by Michael\nMurray (New Haven: Yale University Press), pp. 3\u201322; Steven Galt Crowell\n(1992), \u2018Lask, Heidegger, and the Homelessness of Logic,\u2019 Journal of the British\nSociety for Phenomenology 23(3), 222\u201339; Steven Galt Crowell (1994), \u2018Making Logic\nPhilosophical Again (1912\u20131916),\u2019 in Reading Heidegger from the Start: Essays in his\nEarly Thought, ed. by Theodore Kisiel and John van Buren (Albany: SUNY Press),\npp. 55\u201372; Thomas A.

He argues that the essence of thinking,\nof \u2018judgement,\u2019 has been determined by logic, and more specifically by\nthe proposition, since ancient times.24 By excavating logic down to its\nfoundations, Heidegger seeks to challenge the perceived self-evidence\nof this determination, to expose to the light of critical reflection what\nancient philosophers had themselves found continually disturbing and\nobscure.25\nHeidegger\u2019s historical analysis is scattered across a number of works.\nHere, I will only gather together the highlights, which should suffice to\ncapture the overall trajectory of his considerations. Heidegger organises\nhis history of thinking into three chapters: first, the recognition of a\nmutual relation between the thing and the propositionally structured\nthought, the latter guiding the categorial determinations of the former;\nsecond, the mathematical interpretation of the proposition, which\nin turn provided the basic principles of pure thinking; and third, the\nemergence of a critique of pure thinking, which follows from things\nhaving been determined on the basis of a propositionally structured\nthinking.26 Heidegger elaborates these three chapters of history through\ndiscussions of the philosophies of Aristotle, Descartes, and Kant,\nrespectively. The prologue to this history, however, belongs to Plato.\nRecall that Heidegger focuses his attention on the way in which\nintentionality unifies things and thinking. It does this, he says, in\naccordance with a pre-existing standard of some kind. Heidegger\u2019s\nhistorical analysis traces the ways in which this pre-existing, unifying\nstandard, as an implicit and inherent feature of subjectivity, has\nbeen recognised and articulated over the course of the philosophical\ntradition, beginning with Plato. With Plato, argues Heidegger, this\nstandard was conceptualised as an image or model, the \u2018look\u2019 a thing\nhas in the imagination of its producer before it is produced. This look\nunderpins the philosophical meaning of Plato\u2019s concept of the idea: \u2018It\n24 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 149.\n25 Martin Heidegger (1962a [1927]), Being and Time, trans. by John Macquarrie and\nEdward Robinson (Oxford: Blackwell), p. 21 [2]. (Following scholarly convention,\npage numbers in square brackets refer to the original 1927 German edition of Being\nand Time.)\n26 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 108. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 163\nis this anticipated look of the thing, sighted beforehand, that the Greeks\nmean ontologically by eidos, idea.\u201927\nThis ancient analogy between looking and thinking carries with\nit a connotation of illumination, for looking entails the presence of\nlight \u2014 above all, the sun. Plato thus drew a comparison between visible\nthings and thinkable things, arguing that sunlight is to vision what the\nidea of the good is to scientific thinking.28 According to Heidegger, Plato\nbelieved that the good provides an illumination by which to distinguish\nbetween \u2018a shadow\u2019 and \u2018the real.\u201929 The idea of the good thus provides\nthe guidance we need in order to bring our thinking into proper contact\nwith the real. It is what prevents us from wandering aimlessly among\nthe shadows, without hope of ever discovering truth. The key point is\nthat achieving such knowledge is not simply a matter of observing an\nenormous number of things, as a naive empiricism might suggest. One\nmust also be able to distinguish the epistemically good things from the\nepistemically bad ones, that is, the things which contribute to knowledge\nfrom those which do not.30 The good provides the standard by which\nsuch distinctions are made. Plato\u2019s idea of the good thus represents the\ncondition of possibility for scientific thinking. It is the a priori element in\ncognition which makes scientific knowledge, as such, possible.\nOn Heidegger\u2019s reading, Plato\u2019s account of the good, as a unifying\nstandard combining things and thinking in the experience of knowing,\nis modelled on an account of production. Clearly, then, the idea of the\ngood is not just one idea among many, but rather the first, or primary,\nidea. It serves to organise all the secondary ideas, the categories or\nconcepts which give specific content to our understanding, into a\nunified whole. The idea of the good, writes Heidegger, lies beyond all\nother ideas, giving them the \u2018form of wholeness,\u2019 or \u2018communality.\u201931\nHe suggests that, because it plays this fundamental organising role, of\nproductively forming all other ideas into a unified whole, the idea of the\ngood \u2018is nothing but the demiourgos, the producer pure and simple.\u201932\n27 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 106.\n28 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 283.\n29 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 285.\n30 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 285.\n31 Martin Heidegger (1984a [1978]), The Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, trans. by\nMichael Heim (Bloomington: Indiana University Press), p. 184.\n32 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 286. 164 Science as Social Existence\nThis suggests that Plato\u2019s account of knowledge should be read as a\ncausal one. Just as the craftsperson forms matter and ideas into artefacts,\nso the idea of the good forms things and thinking into knowledge.\nAccording to Heidegger, Plato\u2019s importance lies in the fact that\nhis conceptualisation of thinking on the model of production has\nprovided the basis for all subsequent philosophical enquiry. However,\nthe philosophical nature of this analogy remains obscure in his work.\nHeidegger describes Plato\u2019s account as having a \u2018mythic\u2019 quality in\nwhich the philosophical point fails to fully present itself.33 The claim that\ngenuine philosophical, or more generally scientific, insight may arise\nfrom mythical imagery would seem to challenge the orthodox view\nthat science and mythology are diametrically opposed to one another.\nIndeed, Heidegger insists that mythology, like science, \u2018has its basis in\nspecific experiences and is anything but pure fiction or invention.\u201934 The\nimportant point here is that Heidegger viewed Plato\u2019s mythical account\nof the foundations of knowledge as a proto-scientific account from out\nof which a more precisely determined philosophical theory could then\nbe developed. According to Heidegger, it was Aristotle who would take\nthe first significant step along this path.\n4. Heidegger\u2019s Phenomenological\nHistory of Logic: Aristotle\nOn more than one occasion, Heidegger calls Aristotle \u2018the father of\nlogic.\u201935 However, the fact that Aristotle has gained a pre-eminently\nauthoritative place in the philosophical canon did not, writes Heidegger,\nhappen as a matter of course but \u2018only after arduous struggles and\ncontroversies\u2019 which finally concluded in the thirteenth century.36\nRemarkably, medieval Christian theology and ancient Greek ontology\n33 Heidegger (1984a), The Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, p. 184.\n34 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 234.\n35 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 179; Heidegger (1962a),\nBeing and Time, p. 257 [214]; cf. Martin Heidegger (2009 [1998]), Logic as the Question\nConcerning the Essence of Language, trans. by Wanda Torres Gregory and Yvonne\nUnna (Albany: SUNY Press), p. 5.\n36 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 118. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 165\nshared a common interpretation of creation in terms of production,\nbut the former understood creation as production from out of nothing,\nwhile the latter understood it as production from \u2018out of a material that\nis already found on hand.\u201937 Whereas for medieval theologians both\nthe that-being and the what-being of a thing are produced, for ancient\nphilosophers only the what-being is produced. For the Greeks, in\nother words, existence itself was not subject to creation. Consequently,\nwith its assimilation into medieval theology, ancient ontology became\nreformulated in a way which obscured its original problematic, a\ncircumstance which began to find correction only in the eighteenth\ncentury.38\nAccording to Heidegger, Aristotle\u2019s signal achievement was the\nintroduction of a more precise formulation of the whatness of the\nthing.39 In developing this doctrine, Aristotle used as his guideline the\nGreek concept of logos.40 Heidegger writes that logos has been variously\ninterpreted to mean \u2018reason,\u2019 \u2018judgement,\u2019 \u2018concept,\u2019 \u2018definition,\u2019\n\u2018ground,\u2019 and \u2018relationship.\u201941 He notes, however, that the word logos is\nderived from the same root as legein, which means \u2018to talk\u2019 or \u2018to hold\ndiscourse.\u201942 He thus suggests as a basic signification of logos the German\nword Rede, which may be translated as \u2018speech.\u201943 The connection\nto thinking is clear. Speech is one central way in which thoughts are\nexpressed or communicated. Heidegger argues that legein, discourse, or\nRede \u2018is the clue for arriving at those structures of Being which belong\nto the entities we encounter in addressing ourselves to anything or\nspeaking about it.\u201944\nOne important connotation of logos, as speech, is that it functions to\n\u2018let something be seen,\u2019 which means that it points something out to the\n37 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 118\n38 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 118\n39 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 85.\n40 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 106.\n41 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 55 [32].\n42 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 47 [25]; see translator\u2019s note 3, p. 47.\n43 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 55 [32]; cf. Heidegger (1984a), The Metaphysical\nFoundations of Logic, p. 1.\n44 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 47 [25]. 166 Science as Social Existence\nlistener.45 Another important connotation of logos is that of \u2018relation\u2019 or\n\u2018relationship.\u201946 Plato\u2019s mythological image of the good as demiurge, or\nproducer, is thus an example of logos in that it points out the createdness\nof the thing, as well as the relation of unity between things and thinking.\nIn contrast to Plato, however, Aristotle focussed on logos as \u2018statement\u2019\nor \u2018proposition.\u2019 The crucial move here is from a conception of thinking\nas a collection of images to a conception of thinking as a collection of\npropositions, as speech. Heidegger describes this move as \u2018decisive\u2019:\n\u2018Thinking is here conceived in the sense of talking and speaking.\u201947\nMoreover, speaking is further specified in terms of propositions:\n\u2018Aristotle is the first to give the clearer metaphysical interpretation of the\nlogos in the sense of the propositional statement.\u201948 In his attempt to treat\nthe thing by analogy to the proposition, Aristotle thus takes a dramatic\nstep beyond Plato. Nevertheless, it should be emphasised that Aristotle\nstill adopts, without question, Plato\u2019s image of the thing on the model\nof the product, or artefact. The proposition provided Aristotle with a\nuseful model by which to more precisely determine and formalise the\nontological structure of the thing conceived in this way.\nIt is because Aristotle undertook a systematic analysis of the\nproposition that Heidegger names him the father of logic. Logic, in\nthis sense, is the \u2018science of logos,\u2019 the formal analysis of speech, reason,\nor thinking made possible through the instrument of the proposition.49\nLogos, as proposition, does not just point something out \u2014 as in \u2018Look,\na bird!\u2019 \u2014 it points something out about something \u2014 as in \u2018The bird\nflies.\u2019 Logos as proposition is, in other words, a composite; it combines\ntwo or more things. Heidegger argues that the proposition, as a\ndetermination of something as something, is an expression of thinking.\nHence, logic, as the science of logos, is also the science of thinking.50\nFurthermore, a proposition combines things in a particular way: \u2018Flies\nbird the\u2019 is not a proposition, not logos. Logic thus originates in the\n45 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 56 [32].\n46 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 58 [34].\n47 Heidegger (2009), Logic as the Question Concerning the Essence of Language, p. 17.\n48 Martin Heidegger (2000 [1953]), Introduction to Metaphysics, trans. by Gregory Fried\nand Richard Polt (New Haven: Yale University Press), p. 61.\n49 Heidegger (1984a), Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, p. 22.\n50 Heidegger (1984a), Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, p. 1. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 167\nattempt to make explicit whatever it is that governs the intelligibility of\ncombinations of terms within a proposition. According to Heidegger,\nAristotle recognised that the implicit organiser in the proposition\nwas being, which is rendered explicit in the term \u2018to be\u2019 as well as\nits cognate \u2018is.\u201951 In order to be properly analysed, then, the implicit\npresence of being in the proposition \u2018The bird flies\u2019 must be made\nexplicit, by reformulating the proposition as \u2018The bird is flying.\u2019 The\ngeneral form of the proposition thus becomes \u2018S is P,\u2019 where the\n\u2018is\u2019 combines two distinct terms. However, Heidegger writes that\nAristotle furthermore observed that the \u2018is\u2019 separates as well combines.\nWe cannot understand the combination of S and P unless we have\nfirst understood them as each signifying ontologically distinct, but\npotentially combinable, things.52 The proposition \u2018The bird is flying\u2019\npoints out that two distinct things, one material and the other motive,\nare combined in a single intelligible event.\nThe term \u2018is\u2019 does not signify a distinct thing in the way that the terms\n\u2018bird\u2019 and \u2018flying\u2019 do. Heidegger interprets Aristotle as arguing that the\n\u2018is\u2019 signifies nothing, that is, no distinct thing. Rather, it consignifies a\nrelation between things, \u2018a certain combining, which cannot be thought\nunless what is already combined or combinable has been or is being\nthought.\u201953 The \u2018is\u2019 does not point to a thing existing among other things,\nbut instead to an aspect of thinking: \u2018the being-combined of what is\nthought in thinking.\u201954 If we think of the \u2018is\u2019 as pointing out a relation,\nthen we immediately see that it presupposes the existence of two or\nmore relata, or things related. On the account Heidegger attributes\nto Aristotle, these relata are not mutually distinct and separate things\nexisting beyond thinking, but rather the significations in thinking of\nthose things. The \u2018is\u2019 in the proposition \u2018The bird is flying\u2019 does not\ncombine the bird and the motion of flying. It combines the concept \u2018bird\u2019\nand the concept \u2018flying.\u2019 Hence, Heidegger writes that in Aristotle \u2018logos\nis conceived as a connecting of notions, as a conjoining of meanings, as a\n51 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 180.\n52 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 182.\n53 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 181: cf. Aristotle (1941a), De\nInterpretatione, trans. by E. M. Edghill, in The Basic Works of Aristotle, ed. by Richard\nKcKeon (New York: Random House), pp. 38\u201361 (p. 41 [lines 16b19\u201325]).\n54 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 182. 168 Science as Social Existence\nbinding together of concepts.\u201955 From this, he concludes that the starting\npoint of Aristotle\u2019s science of logos is a clarification of the precise\nconcepts from out of which composite logoi of the form \u2018S is P\u2019 come\nto be organised. The starting point, in other words, is the definition of\nconcepts. Aristotle\u2019s doctrine of the concept, including its definition,\nmust therefore precede his doctrine of logos as proposition.56\nAristotle thus sets about differentiating and defining types of\nconcepts in order to prepare the ground for a study of the ways in\nwhich those concepts may be combined in a proposition. In order to\ngive a precise account of the proposition, he recognised that one must\nfirst give a precise specification of the concepts it includes. Recall that\nfor the ancient Greeks thinking is grounded in experience. Hence, for\nAristotle the definition of a concept was closely linked to a clarification\nof the nature of the experienced thing which that concept is meant to\nsignify. A more precise determination of the concept thus went hand\nin hand with a more precise determination of the whatness of the thing.\nOntology proceeds from grammar. The science of logos provides an\nentry point for a science of being.\nAristotle\u2019s key philosophical contribution was to narrow the focus of\nenquiry down to one particular kind of logos, the proposition. As a result,\nthe subsequent course taken by ontology was powerfully conditioned\nby the range of possibilities made available by the composite linguistic\nform \u2018S is P.\u2019 Consider one consequence of this. In the Categories, Aristotle\nobserves that one particular kind of concept could be represented\nonly in the subject position of the proposition, never in the predicate\nposition. This is the kind of concept signifying concrete individuals.\nAristotle called such individuals \u2018primary substances.\u201957 By further\nstudying the constraints imposed by the proposition, Aristotle then\nidentified another kind of concept which could, unlike the concept of\nprimary substance, also be represented in the predicate position of the\nproposition. One example of a proposition in which these two kinds\nof concept are represented is \u2018The shirt is white.\u2019 Aristotle wrote that\n55 Heidegger (1984a), Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, p. 23.\n56 Heidegger (1984a), Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, p. 23\n57 Aristotle (1941b), Categoriae, trans. by E. M. Edghill, in The Basic Works of Aristotle,\ned. by Richard KcKeon (New York: Random House), pp. 3\u201337 (p. 9 [lines 2a11\u201313]). 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 169\nthe predicate \u2018white\u2019 represents the category of \u2018quality,\u2019 in this case,\nthe shirt\u2019s quality of being white.58 In saying of the shirt that it is white,\nthe proposition signifies the fact that a particular whiteness is present\nin the shirt, or, more generally, that a particular quality is present in a\nparticular substance. Aristotle emphasised that by \u2018present in\u2019 he does\nnot mean that the whiteness is in the shirt as a part is in a whole. He\nmeans rather that this particular whiteness could not exist independently\nof this particular shirt.59 More generally, although a particular quality is\nontologically distinct from the concrete substance in which it is present,\nit would not exist if it were not present in that substance.\nTo us, Aristotle\u2019s point may seem rather trivial. He is simply telling\nus that the thing is a substance with qualities, or, put more broadly, with\nproperties. The point Heidegger wants to make, however, is that our\nself-evident understanding of the thing as a property-bearing substance\nwas the outcome of considerable intellectual effort and philosophical\ningenuity. It is not obvious that the thing is best understood by analogy\nto the proposition. When we see a white shirt we do not see a shirt, on\nthe one hand, and its being white, on the other. We see a white shirt.\nSeparating the shirt into substance and property may strike one, after\nall, as a rather odd thing to do.\nBy analysing the thing through the composite logos of the proposition,\nAristotle determined that the thing too is composite in its structure, and,\nmore specifically, that it is a substance with distinct properties. Just as\nthe \u2018is\u2019 of the proposition separates, so as to then intelligibly combine,\nconcepts in accordance with specific grammatical principles, so too\nare the thing and its properties distinguished and then combined in\naccordance with specific ontological principles. In his systematic\nanalysis of logos as proposition, Aristotle not only laid the foundations\nfor the subsequent field of logic, he also rendered a more precise\nformulation of Plato\u2019s obscure and largely informal notion of a unifying\nstandard which serves to organise things and thinking into knowledge.\nThe mythical image of the demiurge was thus replaced by the more\nsystematically tractable logic of the proposition.\n58 Aristotle (1941b), Categoriae, p. 9 (line 1b29).\n59 Aristotle (1941b), Categoriae, p. 7 (lines 1a23\u201324). 170 Science as Social Existence\n5. Heidegger\u2019s Phenomenological\nHistory of Logic: Descartes\nThe second chapter in Heidegger\u2019s history of things and thinking begins\nwith the emergence of modern natural science.60 With the arrival of the\nearly-modern period, Aristotle\u2019s narrow focus on logos as proposition\nnot only continues to guide formal enquiry into the nature of the\nthing, the philosophical consequences of this orientation are further\nstrengthened and become radicalised in a profound way. Heidegger\nargues that the fundamental foundation distinguishing modern science\nfrom its predecessors can be located in that which \u2018rules and determines\u2019\nthe basic activities of science.61 This foundation is twofold. First comes\nwhat he describes as the \u2018work experiences\u2019 of modern science. This\ndesignates, above all, the modern scientist\u2019s distinctive \u2018direction\nand mode of mastering and using what is,\u2019 or, put more prosaically,\nthe scientist\u2019s \u2018manner of working with the things.\u201962 It is important\nto emphasise that Heidegger is here offering a phenomenological\ndescription. He seeks to pick out the distinctive and fundamental\nfeatures of the way the modern natural scientist experiences her work\nwith things. The second aspect of the foundation of modern science is\nthe range of possibilities within which the scientist may meaningfully\nunderstand her experience of working with things. As was discussed\nin Chapter Three, the study of these possibilities in distinction from\ntheir concrete actualisation as the whatness of things is what Heidegger\nmeans by the term \u2018metaphysics.\u2019 When we transcend the things\nwhich normally preoccupy us, and reflect instead on the existential\nconditions determining the whatness of those things, then we are doing\nmetaphysics in Heidegger\u2019s sense. Hence, Heidegger calls this second\naspect the \u2018metaphysical projection of the thingness of things.\u201963 The\nidea is that, with this projection, the scientist\u2019s experience of her work\nwith things is guided by a metaphysical thinking which determines the\nthingness of those things, that is, the specific kind of whatness rendering\nthem amenable to scientific understanding.\n60 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 65.\n61 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 68.\n62 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, pp. 66, 68.\n63 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 68. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 171\nIn the last section, we considered the way in which Aristotle\u2019s focus\non the proposition facilitated a specific metaphysical projection of the\nthingness of things as property-bearing substances. This was the first\nchapter in Heidegger\u2019s phenomenological history of logical thinking.\nThe second chapter addresses how, with the rise of modern natural\nscience, the proposition becomes mathematically interpreted in a way\nwhich then establishes the basic principles of pure thinking, or pure\nreason. For Heidegger, a key early-modern figure exemplifying this\nnext stage is Ren\u00e9 Descartes. Descartes uncritically accepted Aristotle\u2019s\narticulation of the thing as substance, but then proceeded to radicalise it.\nHe took Aristotle\u2019s claim that substance exists independently of all else,\nthat it is autonomous, and argued that God is the only substance which\ntruly meets this criterion. Indeed, drawing from the medieval Christian\nnotion of God as an uncreated creator who produces the cosmos from\nnothing, Descartes argued in Principles of Philosophy that God is the basis\nfor all other entities: \u2018We perceive that all other things can exist only by\nthe help of the concourse of God.\u201964 Hence, the notion of production\nlying behind Aristotle\u2019s ontological treatment of the proposition is\ntransformed in Descartes from creation out of material already on hand\nto creation from out of nothing. The guiding principle which unifies\nthings and thinking, represented by Plato with the mythic image of the\ndemiurge, and by Aristotle in the \u2018is\u2019 of the proposition, is transplanted\nby Descartes into the subject position of the proposition, where it comes\nto signify the most perfect substance and ultimate ground of all other\nthings. With this move, argues Heidegger, the conditions determining\nthe thingness of the thing, and, more immediately, the substantiality\nof the substance, get buried beneath the dogmatic assumption that\nsubstance provides the only and ultimate basis for any knowledge\nof things.65 The nature of substance can thus no longer be clarified in\nterms of its substantiality, because questions of substantiality are now\nimmediately referred back to substance. An ontology of substance, an\nenquiry into the conditions determining substance in its fundamental\n64 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 125 [92]; Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1969a), The Principles\nof Philosophy, trans. by Elizabeth S. Haldane and G. R. T.

As a consequence,\nthe nature of a substance can, for Descartes, become known only\nindirectly through the study of its most enduring properties: \u2018there is\nalways one principal property of substance which constitutes its nature\nand essence, and on which all the others depend.\u201966 On the other hand,\nbecause substance can still provide an absolute basis for knowledge, it\nsupplies Descartes with a secure means by which to build up an account\nof knowledge in terms of certainty.\nIn a parenthetical comment, Heidegger suggests that the priority\ngiven by Descartes to certainty had its historical roots in the Christian\ndoctrine of salvation, especially as regards the security of the individual.67\nAccording to this doctrine, among created things humans are distinctive\nbecause their \u2018eternal salvation is in question.\u201968 However, Heidegger\nis more concerned with the ascendency of mathematics immediately\nbefore and during Descartes\u2019s lifetime. He argues that mathematics\npresented an ideal tool for those hoping to fulfill a growing cultural\ndesire for certain, or absolute, knowledge.69 In particular, mathematics\nprovided a template for philosophers seeking to ground knowledge\nin indubitable first principles and axioms. For example, in Rules for the\nDirection of the Mind, likely his first philosophical work, Descartes wrote\nthat \u2018in our search for the direct road towards truth we should busy\nourselves with no object about which we cannot attain a certitude equal\nto that of the demonstrations of Arithmetic and Geometry.\u201970\nDrawing from the philosophical tradition, Descartes set out to\ndiscover axiomatic certainty, of the kind exemplified in mathematics,\nthrough an analysis of the proposition. His goal was to construct\nunimpeachable axioms on the secure bedrock of absolute substance.\nFor Descartes, God, being neither created nor sustained by anything\nbeyond itself, was the first, \u2018absolutely perfect,\u2019 substance.71 However,\nhe furthermore contended that there exist two kinds of created\n66 Descartes (1969a), Principles of Philosophy, p. 240 (Principle LIII).\n67 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 99.\n68 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 109.\n69 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 100.\n70 Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1969b), Rules for the Direction of the Mind, trans. by Elizabeth\nS. Haldane and G. R. T. Ross, in Philosophical Works of Descartes, vol. 1, by Ren\u00e9\nDescartes (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), pp. 1\u201377 (p. 5 [Rule II]).\n71 Descartes (1969a), Principles of Philosophy, p. 241 (Principle LIV). 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 173\nsubstance, which each exist independently of any other kind of\ncreated substance, and which may themselves provide a solid basis for\nindubitable, axiomatic knowledge of God\u2019s creation.72 Descartes called\nthese two kinds of substance res extensa and res cogitans, the \u2018extended\nthing\u2019 and the \u2018thinking thing,\u2019 or what are more commonly known as\n\u2018body\u2019 and \u2018mind.\u2019 These two attributes, \u2018extendedness\u2019 and \u2018thinking,\u2019\nare, according to Descartes, the principal properties constituting the\nnature of body and mind, respectively, and on which all other possible\nattributes of body and mind are themselves dependent. There was, for\nDescartes, an especially close relationship between the human mind and\nGod, because both, in his view, are examples of a thinking substance.73\nHe was, however, careful to maintain a strict qualitative difference\nbetween the two.74\nTaking thinking substance as the foundational principle in his\narchitectonic of certainty, Descartes determined that the fundamental\naxiom of a secure system of knowledge was the proposition \u2018I think.\u2019\nAs is well known, Descartes claimed that the indubitable truth of the\nproposition \u2018I think\u2019 entails the truth of the further proposition \u2018I am.\u2019\nHe argued that the proposition \u2018I am\u2019 is already present, implicitly,\nin the assertion \u2018I think.\u2019 According to Heidegger, an absolute\nmathematical principle must exclude anything which may have been\ngiven beforehand; it cannot have anything in front of it.75 Taking\nmathematics as his model, Descartes thus sought a proposition which\nrefers only to itself, excluding all possible traces of prior experience.\nThis absolute proposition turned out to be the proposition in general, as\nsuch, the pure positing of a thinking which asserts.76 Just as the perfectly\ngeneral proposition posits only itself, so thinking in general, construed\nas absolutely mathematical, takes note only of what it already has. What\nDescartes discovered, argues Heidegger, is that pure thinking of this\nkind is always an \u2018I think,\u2019 ego cogito. Wherever pure thinking posits\nonly itself, it must encounter the ego, the \u2018I.\u2019 Thus, in Heidegger\u2019s words,\nDescartes concludes that \u2018[i]n \u201cI posit\u201d the \u201cI\u201d as the positer is co- and\n72 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, pp. 125\u201326 [92].\n73 Descartes (1969a), Principles of Philosophy, p. 241 (Principle LIV).\n74 Descartes (1969a), Principles of Philosophy, p. 239\u201340 (Principle LI).\n75 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 104.\n76 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 104. 174 Science as Social Existence\npre-posited as that which is already present, as what is. The being of\nwhat is determined out of the \u201cI am\u201d as the certainty of the positing.\u201977\nThe subject of the most fundamental proposition \u2014 the \u2018I\u2019 of the \u2018I\nthink\u2019 \u2014 thus becomes the absolute substance which must \u2018stand under\u2019\neverything else. With Descartes, argues Heidegger, the individual \u2018I\u2019\nbecomes the foundational subject, \u2018that with regard to which all the\nremaining things first determine themselves as such.\u201978 These things,\nwhich stand in relation to and are determined by the individual subject,\nbecome \u2018objects.\u2019 Through Descartes\u2019s intervention, the grammatical and\nlogical distinction between subject and object thus becomes interpreted\nas a metaphysical distinction between mind and body. This is, argues\nHeidegger, a radical change in the way thinking, and subjectivity more\ngenerally, is understood to relate to things. The whatness of things now\nbecomes illuminated on the basis of a mathematical impulse towards\nabsolute first principles, which have themselves been grounded in the\nthinking subject construed as the foundational and individual \u2018I.\u2019\nWith Descartes, the \u2018I\u2019 principle thus becomes the fundamental\naxiom of all knowledge.79 Although he adopted without criticism\nAristotle\u2019s focus on the proposition, as well as his account of the thing\nas a property-bearing substance, Descartes displaced the organising\nprinciple in the proposition from the \u2018is\u2019 to the subject position. The\nontological guideline distinguishing and combining the categories in\ngeneral thus gets buried in the ultimate category of substance, where\nit no longer presents itself for investigation. Hence, with Descartes, the\nconditions determining the substantiality of substance, the thingness\nof the thing, get concealed behind a dogmatic appeal to the ultimacy\nof substance. As the absolute ground of all enquiry, the \u2018I\u2019 resists any\nfurther explication. It becomes self-grounding. However, Heidegger\nargues that the \u2018I\u2019 principle, while fundamental, is not the only\nfundamental axiom of knowledge which emerges from Descartes\u2019s\nintervention. Indeed, because every propositional assertion necessarily\nimplicates the \u2018I\u2019 principle, such assertions must always posit only\nwhat lies in the \u2018I\u2019 as the original subject. Hence, what is posited in\n77 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 104.\n78 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 105.\n79 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 107. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 175\nthe predicate must not speak against the subject. From this, Heidegger\nconcludes that every proposition co-posits, along with the \u2018I\u2019 principle,\nan equally fundamental principle of non-contradiction.80 The idea is\nthat the content of the \u2018I\u2019 as the foundational subject must be perfectly\nconsistent with itself. As a consequence, reason in Descartes becomes\nformulated in terms of purity. The \u2018I think\u2019 provides the basis for\nreason, and non-contradiction ensures the purity, in the sense of logical\nconsistency, of that reason. The fundamental mathematical axioms of\nthe \u2018I\u2019 principle and the principle of non-contradiction thus combine to\ndetermine thinking as pure reason. This, in turn, provides the standard\ngoverning all determinations of the thingness of things: \u2018The question\nabout the thing is now anchored in pure reason, i.e., in the mathematical\nunfolding of its principles.\u201981 The Cartesian notion of \u2018pure reason\u2019 thus\ntraces its roots back to Aristotle\u2019s narrow construal of logos in terms of the\nproposition. However, the purity in the notion results more immediately\nfrom Descartes\u2019s appropriation of mathematical techniques in order to\nestablish the indubitable certainty of knowledge.\nDescartes conceptualised thinking by analogy to mathematical\npractice, so as to then initiate a radically new formulation of the thingness,\nor whatness, of the thing as determined by the \u2018I\u2019 principle and the\nprinciple of non-contradiction. This move exemplifies what Heidegger\nidentifies as the twofold foundation of modern science, namely, the\nexperience of working with the things, and the generalisation on\nthe basis of those experiences of an all-encompassing metaphysical\nprojection of the thingness of things. Heidegger\u2019s historical attention\nweighs more on the second aspect, but he does briefly consider ways\nin which Descartes\u2019 philosophical initiatives related to the scientific\nwork of his period. These considerations touch on the work of Galileo\nand Newton, as well as on the nature of the early-modern experiment,\nand they will be discussed further in Chapter Six. For present purposes,\nthe next step in Heidegger\u2019s history focusses on Kant\u2019s response to\nDescartes\u2019s introduction of pure reason as the basis for thinking and\nknowledge.\n80 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 107.\n81 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 108. 176 Science as Social Existence\n6. Heidegger\u2019s Phenomenological\nHistory of Logic: Kant\nIn the evolving historical dialectic between thinking and things,\nDescartes represents for Heidegger a key moment in the early-\nmodern determination of the whatness of the thing on the basis of a\nmathematically construed, pure reason. The next stage in Heidegger\u2019s\nhistory, then, comes with Immanuel Kant\u2019s critique of pure reason. The\ncounter-concept arising from this critique is Kant\u2019s notion of the thing-\nin-itself, to which we gave detailed attention in Chapter Three. As we\nsaw there, Kant conceived of the thing-in-itself as a property-bearing\nsubstance. This marks a strong continuity between Descartes and Kant,\ndespite the latter\u2019s criticism of the former. Indeed, Heidegger argues\nthat, on the basis of this shared commitment to substance ontology,\nKant likewise reproduced the Cartesian position that thinking is an\nattribute of substance.82 According to Heidegger, then, Kant\u2019s critique\nof pure reason, while departing from Descartes in important ways,\nnevertheless left unquestioned Aristotle\u2019s original introduction of the\nproposition as a model by which to formalise accounts of thinking\nand things, an introduction from out of which the ontological concept\nof substance first grew. Furthermore, Heidegger alleges that Kant\nuncritically adopted from Descartes a concept of the \u2018I\u2019 as an isolated,\nindividual subject.83 Although he submitted the \u2018thinking\u2019 of the \u2018I think\u2019\nto ontological critique, he left the ontology of the \u2018I\u2019 largely unexamined.\nThe point where Kant radically departed from Descartes was with his\nmove to submit the \u2018I\u2019 to phenomenological investigation. He begins\nto unpack the phenomenal content of the \u2018I think,\u2019 of the reasoning or\njudging individual, in a way which Descartes did not. The consequences\nof this move were, in Heidegger\u2019s view, of far-reaching philosophical\nimportance.\nRecall that, according to Heidegger, one crucial influence in the\ntransformation of the notions of thing and thinking from the ancient\nto the early-modern period was the rise of Christianity. In particular,\nproductive subjectivity was reconceptualised as the creation of things\n82 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, pp. 366 [318\u201319].\n83 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, pp. 367 [320]. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 177\nfrom out of nothing rather than from out of pre-existing material. This\nshift is powerfully represented in Descartes\u2019s philosophy. Heidegger\nargues that, as a result, a distinctly hierarchical order was introduced\ninto the way things are conceived.84 Among all that is, the highest and\nmost real is the creative source of everything else. This is God, the\nuncreated creator, the ens increatum. Every other being is created, an\nens creatum. Among created beings, the individual human being is\nmost distinctive because its eternal salvation is in question. This is\nDescartes\u2019s res cogitans. What remains of created beings constitutes the\nworld, Descartes\u2019s res extensa. The hierarchical ordering, in descending\norder of reality and perfection, is thus God, human beings, and world.\nIt is important to recognise what Heidegger is not arguing. He is not\narguing that Cartesian philosophy is simply a transposition of Christian\ndoctrine into a philosophical idiom. Indeed, Heidegger emphasises that\nthe relation of early-modern philosophy to Church dogma can be \u2018very\nloose, even broken.\u201985 His point is, rather, that the profound intellectual\ntransformations of the early-modern period, to which Descartes made\na key contribution, took place within a cultural context deeply suffused\nwith orthodox Christian belief. We should thus not find it surprising that\nDescartes\u2019s philosophical views were consequentially influenced by the\nspecificities of the social and material environment in which he worked.\nThe underlying assumption of Heidegger\u2019s analysis is that philosophers\nare not individual and autonomous agents, whose singular ideas spring\nfree from the social and historical soil in which they germinated but\nfrom which they no longer need to draw nourishment. This assumption\nis strongly at odds with the Cartesian view, and one may view its\npersuasiveness as bound together, in part, with the subsequent decline\nin influence of Christian notions of personal salvation on the intellectual\nmilieu in which philosophers necessarily articulate and seek credibility\nfor their work.\nAs we have seen, Heidegger argues that Descartes\u2019s position was\ninfluenced not just by Christianity, but also by the growing importance\nof mathematics in his period. On the one hand, the predominance of the\nChristian doctrine of personal salvation helps to explain why Descartes\nrelocated the guiding principle, which unifies things and thinking,\n84 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 109.\n85 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 109. 178 Science as Social Existence\nfrom the \u2018is\u2019 of the proposition to the \u2018I,\u2019 the foundational subject, of the\nproposition. On the other hand, the growing authority of mathematical\ntechniques helps to explain why Descartes then formulated the epistemic\nsecurity of the \u2018I\u2019 by analogy to the axiomatic certainty of mathematics.\nThe doctrine of salvation suggests that the individual, by overcoming\nthe burden of sin, may slip free from the finitude and impurity of mortal\nexistence and find eternal existence in God. Axiomatic knowledge,\nby comparison, provides the individual with a means by which to\novercome the threat of error and falsehood, and hence to achieve an\nabsolute certainty uncorrupted by the contingent constraints of finite\nphysical existence. The pure reason of the res cogitans, the \u2018soul\u2019 or\n\u2018mind,\u2019 provided Descartes with an ultimate ground for knowledge,\na ground which could be internally validated, independently of the\nworldly, and thus imperfect, influence of the res extensa, the \u2018external\nworld.\u2019 The \u2018I\u2019 principle places the ground of reason in the individual\nthinking substance. The principle of non-contradiction ensures the\ninternal purity of that individual substance.\nOn Heidegger\u2019s reading, Kant\u2019s critique of pure reason questions\nthe alleged internal purity of the individual knower by challenging the\nidea that an individual can know anything at all in isolation from the\n\u2018external world.\u2019 Implicit in this challenge is a rejection of the idea that\nan individual may escape the finite constraints of physical existence and\nsecure knowledge of a potentially infinite scope. In Chapter Three, we\nreviewed Kant\u2019s notion of finitude, and the doctrine of humility which\nit grounds. We can now see how finitude and humility arose for Kant\nin his response to the problem introduced by Descartes\u2019s location of the\nconditions determining the thingness of things in the pure reason of\nthe thinking \u2018I.\u2019 By placing the \u2018I think\u2019 at the foundation of knowledge,\nDescartes gives urgency to the question \u2018What am I?\u2019 or, more generally,\n\u2018What is the human being?\u2019 The \u2018I\u2019 is not just one domain among others,\nbut precisely that domain to which knowledge of all other domains\nmust be traced back.86 The question \u2018What is the thing?\u2019 thus leads back\ninevitably to the question \u2018What is the human being?\u2019 Because Kant\naccepts Descartes\u2019s account of the human being as a thinking substance,\nthe question about the human being becomes for him a question\n86 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 110. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 179\nabout thinking. According to Heidegger, Kant\u2019s primary question is\nthus the question of what an individual human being must be like in\norder to think. Descartes had already provided one clue: namely, that\nthe individual, as a thinking substance, is bound by the law of non-\ncontradiction. According to Heidegger, Kant picks up on this clue and\ndevelops it into an investigation of what the \u2018I\u2019 must be like in order to\nbe bound by laws. In other words, Kant\u2019s critique of pure reason seeks\nafter the conditions of possibility for law- or rule-governed thinking\nas such. Heidegger calls the articulation of these conditions \u2018a basic\nproblem for logic.\u201987 The search for a solution to this problem is a search\nfor a \u2018philosophical logic, or better, the metaphysical foundations of logic.\u201988\nOn Heidegger\u2019s reading, then, Kant\u2019s enquiry into the law-\ngovernedness of thinking was a metaphysical enquiry into the ontological\nconditions which make scientific knowledge as such possible. He claims\nthat this enquiry is prior to, and more fundamental than, the investigations\ntypical of psychology, anthropology, ethics, or sociology.89 Whereas\nthese latter domains of enquiry, in Heidegger\u2019s view, take for granted\nthe specific projection of the thingness of things which determines their\nparticular subject matter, a more general ontological enquiry must address\nthe conditions which make such determinations possible. Furthermore,\nHeidegger argues that \u2018[o]nly as phenomenology is ontology possible.\u201990\nHence, an enquiry into the existential conditions determining the\npossibility of logic is, for Heidegger, a phenomenological enquiry into\nthe foundations of science. For him, logic is a particular kind of science,\nthe \u2018science of the rules of thought.\u201991 Accordingly, he argues that one\nsignal achievement of Kant\u2019s critique of pure reason was to open up the\n\u2018thinking\u2019 of Descartes\u2019s \u2018I think\u2019 to phenomenological investigation. In\nparticular, Heidegger reads Kant as exploring the ontological basis for\na subject\u2019s ability to follow the laws structuring scientific thinking, chief\namong them being the law of non-contradiction. With this move, the law\nof non-contradiction, which had been treated by Descartes as the highest\nprinciple of all knowledge, is \u2018removed from its position of dominance.\u201992\n87 Heidegger (1984a), Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, p. 20.\n88 Heidegger (1984a), Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, p. 21.\n89 Heidegger (1984a), Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, p. 17.\n90 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 60 [35].\n91 Heidegger (1984a), Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, p. 104.\n92 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 184\u201385. 180 Science as Social Existence\nWhat now dominates are those objective features of subjectivity which\nallow the \u2018I\u2019 to submit itself to the rules governing thinking.\nBy opening thinking up to phenomenological investigation, Kant\nreopens a question that was explicitly addressed by Plato and Aristotle\nbut then closed off by Descartes: namely, the question of logos as that\nwhich functions to meaningfully combine concepts. As we saw earlier,\nPlato locates this phenomenon in the idea of the good, conceptualised\nby analogy to the demiurge, the producer pure and simple. Aristotle,\nin contrast, conceptualised it by analogy to the \u2018is\u2019 of the proposition,\nthereby characterising it not as a thing but rather as that according to\nwhich things are combined. Descartes, by relocating the phenomenon\nof ontological combination from the \u2018is\u2019 to the subject of the proposition,\nthen came to treat it as a thing the nature of which resists further\nanalysis. Kant, by investigating this phenomenon as an active, non-\nthinglike feature of the subjectivity of the thinking subject, began to\nshed phenomenological light on what Descartes had formerly cloaked\nin darkness.\nAccording to Heidegger, Kant located the phenomenon of ontological\ncombination in the individual subject\u2019s power of imagination\n[Einbildungskraft].93 For Kant, imagination is a \u2018faculty of forming.\u201994\nThis harkens back to Plato\u2019s conceptualisation of the relation between\nthings and thinking by analogy to production. Just as a craftsperson,\nor demiurge, forms disparate materials into a complete and unified\nwhole, so too does the imagination of the subject form the jumble of\nbrute sensation into an ordered and intelligible experience. Imagination\nthus makes intelligible experience possible. In the Critique of Pure Reason,\nKant argued that \u2018[t]he conditions of the possibility of experience in\ngeneral are at the same time conditions of the possibility of the objects of\nexperience.\u201995 Heidegger argues that this passage reflects a \u2018fundamental\nposture\u2019 in human history, one which it is impossible for us to avoid.96\nBoth an intelligible experience and the things which meaningfully\npresent themselves in that experience \u2014 that is, both thinking and the\n93 Martin Heidegger (1997 [1929]), Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, 5th edn,\nenlarged, trans. by Richard Taft (Bloomington: Indiana University Press), p. 90.\n94 Heidegger (1997), Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, p. 91.\n95 Immanuel Kant (1998), Critique of Pure Reason, ed. and trans. by Paul Guyer and\nAllen W.

Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 181\nthings thought \u2014 are dependent on the faculty of imagination. We saw\nin Chapter Three that, for Kant, an intelligible experience involves the\nstructured unity of two distinct faculties: spontaneity and receptivity, or\nwhat we have also discussed as constructivity and affectivity. According\nto Heidegger, Kant\u2019s notion of imagination describes the common root\nfrom out of which the distinct stems of spontaneity and receptivity both\ngrow.97 The power of imagination is, he writes, the \u2018original unity\u2019 of\nthe two.98 Chapter Three focussed on receptivity, especially as it relates\nto the issues of human finitude and epistemic humility. In this chapter,\nour concern lies more with the constructive faculty which lends order\nand intelligibility to experience, thereby allowing us to make sense of\nthe things around us.\nKant described the constructive aspect of imagination in terms of\na \u2018faculty of rules.\u201999 Furthermore, he argued that rules, insofar as they\nare objective, may also be called \u2018laws.\u2019100 The power of imagination,\nthen, and especially its constructive aspect, provides the conditions of\npossibility for following, among the other fundamental rules of logic, the\nlaw of non-contradiction. Logic thus finds its phenomenological, which\nis to say its ontological, origins in the imagination of the individual\nsubject. However, Heidegger emphasises that, for Kant, the subjectivity\nof the individual subject is not constitutive of the law. Rather, the law\nis that towards which the subject directs herself, and it is through such\ndirectedness that the individual first realises the possibilities for action\n97 Heidegger (1997), Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, p. 97.\n98 Heidegger (1997), Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, p. 107. This reading of Kant\nhas been strongly criticised. Michael Friedman, for example, argues that Heidegger,\nin this passage, is \u2018turning Kant\u2019s original problematic entirely on its head\u2019 (Michael\nFriedman (2000), A Parting of the Ways: Carnap, Cassirer, and Heidegger (Chicago:\nOpen Court), p. 61). In his preface to the second edition, Heidegger notes that\n\u2018[r]eaders have taken constant offense at the violence of my interpretations\u2019\n(Heidegger (1997), Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, p. xx). On the other hand, the\nbook\u2019s translator, Richard Taft, comments that \u2018[o]ver the years, Kant and the Problem\nof Metaphysics has emerged as the cornerstone of an important and original (if\ncontroversial) direction in Kant interpretation that continues to assert an influence\ntoday\u2019 (in Heidegger (1997), Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, p. xii). Whatever\nthe case, I am here less concerned with the \u2018accuracy\u2019 of Heidegger\u2019s interpretation\nof Kant, than with the role played by that interpretation in the development of\nHeidegger\u2019s own account of logic.\n99 Kant (1998), Critique of Pure Reason, p. 242 (line A126); cf. Heidegger (1997), Kant and\nthe Problem of Metaphysics, p. 105.\n100 Kant (1998), Critique of Pure Reason, p. 242 (line A126). 182 Science as Social Existence\nopen to her as a unique person.101 Strictly speaking, then, the law is not\na purely spontaneous construction of the individual subject. But neither,\nstrictly speaking, is it purely an object of the sensibility, or receptivity,\nof the individual. The law, writes Heidegger, is nothing empirical.102 It\nis not a thing awaiting discovery in the world. It is, rather, a structure\nfound in reason. In this sense, then, the individual subject discovers the\nlaw within herself as something she is ultimately free to either follow\nor disregard, but which she nevertheless encounters as an obligation.\nHeidegger thus interprets Kant as arguing that reason is a \u2018receptive\nspontaneity\u2019 wherein the rules governing it are not freely constructed\nby the individual subject but rather encountered by her as the necessary\nconstraints making reason, as such, possible. To accept these constraints,\nthen, means to submit oneself to a \u2018self-given necessity.\u2019103 Heidegger\nwrites that, for Kant, in submitting to the law, \u2018I submit to myself.\u2019104\nWe thus experience the rules of reason as self-validating. We come to\nrecognise them through the obligation we feel towards them, and we\nlikewise experience them as the source of that obligation. According to\nHeidegger, it is because the subject\u2019s relation to rules is marked by both\nconstructivity and receptivity that Kant located rules in the power of\nimagination, a power which provides a common root for both.\nIt is a matter of logical necessity that a thing cannot be, for example,\nboth a bird and not a bird. If S is P, then S cannot at the same time\nbe not-P. This would be a logical impossibility, a contradiction. If we\nwant to reason logically, then we must follow the principle, or law, of\nnon-contradiction. This law sits at the foundation of logic. It puts an\na priori constraint on thinking as Aristotle construed it on the model\nof the proposition. The necessity of the law is thus conjoined with the\nnecessity of thinking in strictly propositional terms. We are obliged to\nfollow the law of non-contradiction only so long as we also feel obliged\nto express ourselves in a logically sound manner. A poet, for example,\nmay describe a thing in a way which is ambiguous between its being\nand not being a bird. Poetic thinking need not be logical thinking. We\nare thus free to ignore the law of non-contradiction to the extent that we\n101 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, pp. 135, 138; Heidegger (1997),\nKant and the Problem of Metaphysics, p. 111.\n102 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 135.\n103 Heidegger (1997), Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, p. 109.\n104 Heidegger (1997), Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, p. 111. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 183\nfeel free to think in ways not determined by the logic of the proposition.\nLogical rules may compel us to think in certain strictly determined\nways, but the compulsion itself is not a determination. We may, after all,\nchoose to act otherwise, whatever the cost may be.\nHeidegger draws this insight from Kant\u2019s discussion of the role of rules\nin theoretical reasoning, finding there the idea that \u2018[f]reedom already\nlies in the essence of pure understanding, i.e., of pure theoretical reason,\ninsofar as this means placing oneself under a self-given necessity.\u2019105\nFurthermore, because freedom is a question of action, theoretical reason\nis importantly tied to practical reason. Hence, Kant writes in the Critique\nof Pure Reason: \u2018Everything is practical that is possible through freedom.\u2019106\nHeidegger thus reads Kant as undertaking to explain theory in terms of\naction by giving priority to practical over theoretical reason. In his view,\nhowever, this undertaking remained ambiguous, as Kant presupposed\nan either/or of receptivity and spontaneity, of passivity and activity,\nthus failing in the end to fully realise the task of tracing both back to\na common source in the power of imagination.107 Heidegger writes that\nKant, in unveiling the receptive spontaneity of our relation to rules, \u2018saw\nthe unknown,\u2019 and \u2018had to shrink back.\u2019108 Kant\u2019s retreat is evinced in his\nshift of focus between the A and B editions of the Critique of Pure Reason.\nIn the first edition, rule-governed thinking springs from the unified and\nirreducible receptive spontaneity of the imagination. In the second edition,\nKant moved away from this unified stance, and instead assimilated rule-\ngovernedness, and imagination in general, to pure spontaneity.109 With\nthis, Kant backed away from his original insight that logic stems from\nthe synthetic unity of our non-empirical constructive power, on the one\nhand, and our existence as finite creatures necessarily affected by things\nand persons, on the other. Heidegger argues that, subsequent to Kant\u2019s\nimportant insight in the first edition of the Critique of Pure Reason, \u2018pure\nreason as reason drew him increasingly under its spell\u2019: \u2018Kant awoke to\nthe problem of now searching for finitude precisely in the pure, rational\n105 Heidegger (1997), Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, p. 109.\n106 Kant (1998), Critique of Pure Reason, 674 (A800/B828); cf. Heidegger (1997), Kant and\nthe Problem of Metaphysics, p. 109.\n107 Heidegger (1984a), Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, p. 184.\n108 Heidegger (1997), Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, p. 118.\n109 Heidegger (1997), Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, p. 114. 184 Science as Social Existence\ncreature itself, and not first in the fact that it is determined through\n\u201csensibility.\u201d\u2019110\nKant thus managed to momentarily lift the ontological principle\nunifying things and thinking from out of the substance-subject where\nDescartes had buried it. In doing so, he exposed the phenomenological\ncharacter of this unifying source as the receptive spontaneity of\nimagination, but he then allowed this insight to collapse back into the\nCartesian subject. Consequently, imagination, as the ground for logical\nreason, gets reentrenched as the purified property of an individual and\nautonomous thinking substance. This means that the world towards\nwhich thinking, as pure reason, directs itself is likewise conceptualised\nin terms of pure substance, as an independent property-bearing object\nstanding opposite a thinking subject. Sceptical doubts about the\nexistence of a world construed in this way, which we considered in\nChapter One, then emerge to make no end of philosophical mischief.\nThus, although Kant failed to grasp the implications of his insight\ninto the phenomenology of rule-following, he broke new ground\nand provided the hints on which Heidegger was then able to build.\nHeidegger located one important such hint in Kant\u2019s remarks on the\nphenomenology of \u2018respect\u2019 [Achtung].111 Kant approached respect\nas the \u2018feeling of my existence\u2019 or as a \u2018moral feeling\u2019 which one\nexperiences in response to the laws governing moral action.112 In my\nown terms, respect is an instance of the affectivity of the subject, and\nthus has an elementally emotional structure. Through this existential\nfeeling of respect for the law one comes not only to recognise the law\nas law, one also comes to understand oneself as a person who can be\nguided by such laws. To be guided by a law or rule is to be affected by\nit. Guidability thus entails affectivity. The feeling that one\u2019s existence\nis rule-governed is thus a sign of one\u2019s finitude. I do not freely create\nthe conditions governing my judgements or actions. On the contrary,\n110 Heidegger (1997), Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, p. 118. In a lecture one year\nlater, Heidegger would add that \u2018Kant himself, as the second edition of the Critique\nof Pure Reason reveals, helped to prepare the turn away from an uncomprehending\nfinitude toward a comforting infinitude\u2019 (Martin Heidegger (1995a [1983]), The\nFundamental Concepts of Metaphysics: World, Finitude, Solitude, trans. by William\nMcNeill and Nicholas Walker (Bloomington: Indiana University Press), pp. 208\u201309).\n111 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 133.\n112 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 133. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 185\nin judging or acting I am constantly affected by existential pressures\nwhich are not solely of my own autonomous creation. On Heidegger\u2019s\nreading, Kant argues that the law offers one a resource by which to repel\nthose impulses or inclinations which threaten to disrupt moral action.\nHence, the law may play a negative role, for example, by disabling\nthe immediate sensible feelings of pleasure or pain which threaten to\ninterfere with sound judgement. However, Heidegger points out that,\nfor Kant, the disabling force exercised by the law against immediate,\nsensible feelings is itself also a feeling, an emotion. Indeed, he identifies\nthis view, which he also ascribes to Spinoza, with the claim that \u2018an\nemotion can be overcome only by an emotion.\u2019113 In phenomenological\nterms, the repulsion of sensible feelings in the pursuit of rule-governed,\nor principled, action is itself motivated by a feeling. For Kant, this\nfeeling is one of respect for the law, and it differs from sensible feelings\nlike pleasure and pain in that it has an intellectual rather than somatic\nground. Heidegger interprets Kant as arguing that respect for the law\nis produced by reason alone, that we possess it independently of, and\nprior to, sensible experience: \u2018Reason, as free, gives this law to itself.\u2019114\nFurthermore, Heidegger emphasises Kant\u2019s claim that respect for the\nlaw, as a non-empirical feeling, is not directed towards things but rather\ntowards persons. He quotes Kant\u2019s statement in the Critique of Practical\nReason that \u2018[r]espect always goes to persons alone, never to things.\u2019115\n113 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 134. Cf. Heidegger\u2019s\nstatement in Being and Time: \u2018when we master a mood, we do so by way of a\ncounter-mood; we are never free of moods\u2019 (Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p.\n175 [136]). Note, too, this statement by scientist-philosopher Ludwik Fleck, written\nin the early 1930s: \u2018The concept of absolutely emotionless thinking is meaningless.\nThere is no emotionless state as such nor pure rationality as such. [\u2026] There is\nonly agreement or difference between feelings, and the uniform agreement in\nthe emotions of society is, in its context, called freedom from emotions\u2019 (Ludwik\nFleck (1979), Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact, trans. by Fred Bradley\nand Thaddeus J. Trenn, ed. by Thaddeus J. Trenn and Robert K. Merton (Chicago:\nUniversity of Chicago Press), p. 49). Note, furthermore, this more recent statement\nfrom feminist epistemologist Alison Jagger: \u2018emotional attitudes are involved on\na deep level [\u2026] in the intersubjectively verified and so supposedly dispassionate\nobservations of science\u2019 (Alison M. Jagger (1989), \u2018Love and Knowledge: Emotion in\nFeminist Epistemology,\u2019 in Women, Knowledge, and Reality: Explorations in Feminist\nEpistemology, ed. by Ann Garry & Marilyn Pearsall (Boston: Unwin Hyman), pp.\n129\u201355 (p. 138)).\n114 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 135.\n115 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 135. 186 Science as Social Existence\nHeidegger paraphrases this statement as: \u2018Respect as respect for the law\nrelates also, in its specific revelation, to the person.\u2019116 More specifically,\nhe interprets Kant as arguing that the person to whom respect for the\nlaw relates is \u2018myself.\u2019 Respect for the law is, on this reading, a \u2018self-\nsubjection\u2019: \u2018In subjecting myself to the law, I subject myself to myself\nas pure reason.\u2019117\nThere is, however, an interpretive anomaly here. Kant writes that\nrespect for the law is a feeling directed toward persons. Heidegger\nparaphrases this as the claim that respect for the law is a feeling\ndirected toward the person, namely, oneself. Where Kant used the plural,\nHeidegger transposes the singular. On the basis of this misinterpretation,\nHeidegger then accuses Kant of failing to overcome Descartes\u2019s burial\nof the rules binding things and thinking in the individual \u2018I.\u2019 Yet,\nimmediately following the passage Heidegger cites from the Critique\nof Practical Reason, Kant writes that the example of a virtuous person\n\u2018holds a law before me,\u2019 that this person \u2018provides me with a standard.\u2019118\nOn Kant\u2019s account, it is towards another person, a virtuous person, that\nrespect is felt. The behaviour of that person, in exemplifying the law,\ncommands my respect for the law. Respect for the law is thus really\nrespect for a person whose actions are seen to exemplify the law. Put\nin a nutshell, there is a distinctly intersubjective element in Kant\u2019s\nphenomenological account of respect. Only by considering the way\nin which we are affected by the behaviour of others can we begin to\nunderstand the compulsive respect for the rules which motivate and\nguide our own behaviour.\nA more felicitous reading of Kant\u2019s critique of Descartes\u2019s pure reason\nshould thus attribute to him two important insights. First, as Heidegger\nobserves, Kant opened up the Cartesian \u2018I\u2019 to phenomenological enquiry,\nrevealing the receptivity at the core of thinking. For Kant, this receptivity\nwas especially manifest in a feeling of respect towards rules or the law.\nSecond, Kant furthermore challenged the autonomy of the Cartesian \u2018I\u2019\nby recognising that respect for the law is constituted by respect towards\n116 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 135.\n117 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 135.\n118 Immanuel Kant (1956), Critique of Practical Reason, trans. by Lewis White Beck (New\nYork: Macmillan), pp. 79\u201380. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 187\nother persons. Heidegger obscures this second insight by interpreting\nKant\u2019s respect for persons as a respect for oneself, thereby foisting\nonto Kant a Cartesian construal of the \u2018I\u2019 as an isolated, self-referring\nindividual. On this basis, Heidegger then argues that the \u2018I\u2019 should not\nbe understood in terms of isolation, but rather in terms of community,\nor being-with-others, a point which will be considered in more detail\nlater in this chapter. In making this argument, however, Heidegger is\ndeveloping a point already present, if only in germinal form, in Kant\u2019s\nown account. Where Heidegger more clearly departs from Kant is in\nhis rejection of the substance ontology which the latter took over from\nDescartes. Whereas Kant conceived of the \u2018I\u2019 as a substance, or thing,\nHeidegger describes it in terms of existence. For Heidegger, thinking is\nnot the attribute of a substance-subject, but rather of a form of existence,\nan intentional act which is necessarily directed towards things and other\npersons, and which can therefore never be understood independently\nof those things and other persons.\nThis brings us to the end of Heidegger\u2019s history of the thematisation\nof thinking and its formalisation as logic. To recap, Plato and Aristotle\nhad conceived of intentionality as the unifying principle which binds\ntogether things and thinking. For Plato it was the mythical demiurge,\nwhile for Aristotle it was the \u2018is\u2019 of the logos, construed narrowly as\nthe proposition. Descartes shifted attention from the \u2018is\u2019 to the subject\nposition of the proposition, thereby closing intentionality up in the pure\nreason of an isolated \u2018I\u2019 and thus supressing the essential link between\nthinking and things. Kant opened the \u2018I\u2019 back up, arguing that the rules\nwhich govern thinking entail the receptivity of the thinking \u2018I\u2019 towards\nother persons. Heidegger, for his part, builds on Kant\u2019s insights. As\nwe saw in Chapter Three, he more fully opens up the affectivity of the\n\u2018I\u2019 to include things as well as persons. Later in this chapter, we will\nsee how Heidegger also elaborated on the affective receptivity of the\nindividual \u2018I\u2019 towards other persons through the methods of existential\nphenomenology. We will also consider some of the limitations of that\nmethod and examine the ways in which SSK can help to overcome\nthem. In particular, SSK can help lead Heidegger towards a more fully\ndeveloped account of the social foundations of logic. For the time being,\nlet us directly address Heidegger\u2019s phenomenological account of the\nexistential foundations of logic. 188 Science as Social Existence\n7. \u2018The Argument Lives and Feeds on Something\u2019\nAccording to Heidegger, Kant\u2019s critique of pure reason focussed on the\nquestion \u2018What is the human being?\u2019 and sought to answer this question\nby uncovering the conditions of possibility for rule-governed thinking\nas such. The articulation of these conditions is, for Heidegger, a basic\nproblem for philosophical logic, a problem which can be solved only\nthrough metaphysical enquiry. As a metaphysical task, this enquiry\nrefuses to take for granted the ancient Aristotelian projection of thinking\nas structured by the proposition. Heidegger thus understands logic as\ngrounded in metaphysics, a position which puts him at odds with the\nprevailing view concerning the grounds of logic, a view he describes\nas self-evident, as \u2018immediately intelligible on the level of common\nsense.\u2019119\nThis prevailing, common-sense argument views logic as a \u2018free-\nfloating\u2019 and \u2018ultimate\u2019 form of thinking, one which holds primacy over\nall the sciences, broadly construed.120 By classifying metaphysics as a\nscience, proponents of this argument claim that logic also holds primacy\nover metaphysics. All knowledge, including metaphysical knowledge,\nis necessarily grounded in logic. Metaphysical thinking presupposes\nlogic, because without logic it could never be justified or carried\nout.121 Yet, Heidegger observes that, for the sake of consistency, this\nargument must also be applied to logic itself, as the science of thinking,\nthus yielding the discomforting conclusion that logic too presupposes\nlogic.122 It thus becomes difficult to see how logic could be justified\nwithout falling into a vicious circle. Heidegger seeks to soften this circle\nwith the counter-argument that logic is grounded in metaphysics, and\nthat metaphysics holds primacy over logic. He thus attempts to turn the\nprevailing view that metaphysics presupposes logic on its head. Indeed,\nat one point he even makes the provocative suggestion that logic is\nonly contingently related to philosophy: \u2018Logic originated in the ambit\nof the administration of the Platonic-Aristotelian schools. Logic is an\ninvention of schoolteachers, not of philosophers.\u2019123\n119 Heidegger (1984a), Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, p. 103.\n120 Heidegger (1984a), Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, p. 103.\n121 Heidegger (1984a), Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, p. 104.\n122 Heidegger (1984a), Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, p. 104.\n123 Heidegger (2000), Introduction to Metaphysics, p. 128. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 189\nHeidegger\u2019s response to the common-sense argument for the\nultimacy of logic is a diagnostic one. Indeed, he cautions against attempts\nto directly attack the argument by means of a formal refutation.124 The\nproblem with such attempts is that they implicitly presuppose that\nthinking is, at its base, necessarily governed by the formal rules of logic.\nHence, in their very method, these attempts surrender to the prevailing\naccount the very ground they had hoped to contest. Yet, although\nHeidegger refuses to cede this ground, he does accept as inevitable the\ncircularity of any argument which seeks to probe the foundations of\nthinking as such.125 This inescapable circle is not, however, a formal circle,\nnot a circle of logic, but a hermeneutic circle, a circle of interpretation.\nIt is, moreover, an inherent feature of thinking. Heidegger argues that\nattempts to overcome the hermeneutic circle fail \u2018from the ground up\u2019\nto grasp the way in which thinking actually works.126\nHeidegger\u2019s considerations are driven by the insight that all\nacts of thinking are acts of interpretation. This is just another way of\nrecognising that thinking is necessarily constructive. To make sense of\nan experienced thing means to determine its whatness. An act of sense-\nmaking is an interpretive act which implicates certain presuppositions\nabout the thingness of the thing experienced. As we saw above,\nHeidegger describes the presuppositions guiding interpretation in terms\nof the metaphysical projection of the thingness of things. Metaphysics\nconcerns the range of possibilities available for intelligibly determining\nthe whatness of things experienced. Those possibilities may be viewed\nas the range of presuppositions on the basis of which one can make sense\nof one\u2019s experience in the world. The hermeneutic circle springs from the\nfact that interpretation necessitates the prior existence of understanding.\nIn order to achieve a determinate understanding of something through\nan act of interpretation, one must already possess some understanding\nrelevant to that thing. For example, in order to achieve a determinate\nunderstanding of a word in a sentence, one must already possess\nsome understanding of the overall meaning of the sentence. It thus\nappears that understanding presupposes understanding, that thinking\npresupposes thinking.\n124 Heidegger (1984a), Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, p. 106.\n125 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 27 [7].\n126 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, pp. 194 [153], 363 [315]. 190 Science as Social Existence\nIf we then introduce into this circle the further claim that thinking\nis necessarily governed by formal logic, we end up with the assertion\nthat logic presupposes logic, that logic grounds logic, which is just to\nsay that logic needs only itself in order to be what it is. Here, then, we\nhave the nub of the common-sense argument that logic is \u2018free-floating\u2019\nand \u2018ultimate.\u2019 Logic is both the ground for all other forms of thinking,\nas well as the ground for itself. The primacy of logic is, in this way, self-\nevident. Heidegger\u2019s diagnostic response to this argument is to deny\nthe claim that thinking is necessarily grounded in logic. This leaves in\nplace the interpretive circle essential to thinking, but resists its further\ndetermination as a circle of logic. Indeed, Heidegger argues that the\nthinking presupposed in an act of interpretation \u2018has nothing to do\nwith laying down an axiom from which a sequence of propositions\nis deductively derived.\u2019127 Thinking is not, at its base, structured by\naxioms, and thus interpretation cannot, at its base, be an act of inference\nfrom axioms, or first principles. Interpretation is not, in other words,\ninferential, but constructive or projective. Heidegger argues that when\nthinking turns to the interpretation of itself, when it thematises itself as\nan object of attention, it \u2018put[s] itself into words for the very first time,\nso that it may decide of its own accord whether, as the thing which it is,\nit has that state of Being for which it has been disclosed in the projection\nwith regard to its formal aspects.\u2019128 What Heidegger is describing here\nis a process of self-interpretation by which thinking comes to exploit\nthe possibility for articulating itself in formal or axiomatic terms, that\nis, in terms of logic. To treat thinking as fundamentally structured\nby axioms is to overlook this process of interpretation, and hence to\nconfuse the end product of the interpretation \u2014 logic, as the science\nof thinking \u2014 for the thing being interpreted \u2014 thinking itself. In fact,\naccording to Heidegger, logic is but one possible way in which thinking\nmay come to understand itself. Only when the contingency of this\nparticular self-articulation is acknowledged can thinking \u2018decide of its\nown accord\u2019 whether this articulation is an adequate representation of\nitself. Concealing this contingency, by erasing the interpretive processes\nwhich underlie it, risks forcing on thinking a representation of itself\nwhich it lacks the resources to question. Under such circumstances, it\n127 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 28 [8].\n128 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 362 [315]. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 191\nbecomes a matter of common sense to view thinking in terms of logic,\nand logic as something free-floating and ultimate.\nHeidegger\u2019s proposed diagnostic refutation to the common-sense\nargument for the ultimacy of logic is meant to demonstrate two points:\nfirst, why the argument is necessary under certain presuppositions;\nsecond, why the argument is at all possible.129 On the first point, we can\nnow see that the argument becomes necessary once one presupposes both\nthat thinking is necessarily grounded in fundamental axioms, as well as\nthat the articulation of the formal propositional structure of thinking\nis not a constructive act of interpretation, but rather one of deductive\nderivation from those fundamental axioms. On the second point, the\nargument becomes possible only once these two presuppositions have\nbeen formally articulated and rendered credible. Heidegger\u2019s history\nof the evolving relationship between things and thinking, recounted\nabove, is meant to describe this process of articulation. It was Aristotle\u2019s\nnarrow interpretation of logos in terms of the proposition which founded\nlogic as the formal study of propositionally structured speech acts.\nDescartes uncritically adopted this foundation, and was furthermore\nguided by mathematics, and perhaps also by the Christian doctrine\nof salvation, to shift the unifying locus of the proposition from the \u2018is\u2019\nto the subject position, which, on the basis of the presumed axiomatic\ntruth of the statement \u2018I think,\u2019 he narrowly construed in terms of the\nego, the \u2018I.\u2019 This history is meant to suggest that the two presuppositions\nunderpinning the common-sense argument did not, as it were, jump\nfully formed from the brow of Zeus, but instead emerged through a\ncomplex, protracted and controversy-laden historical process.\nHeidegger claims that his diagnostic argument offers a \u2018refutation\u2019\nof the common-sense argument, but this is not true.130 It is, after all, not\nimpossible for the existence of a presupposition to be a matter of historical\ncontingency while its justifiedness remains a matter of necessity.\nHowever, although Heidegger has not conclusively proven that the\npresuppositions of the common-sense argument are only contingently\njustified, he has, I think, succeeded in loosening up intuitions about\ntheir presumed necessity. In light of Heidegger\u2019s historical analysis,\nconcerns about the vicious circularity of the common-sense argument\n129 Heidegger (1984a), Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, p. 106.\n130 Heidegger (1984a), Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, p. 106. 192 Science as Social Existence\nare thus less likely to be assuaged by pointing to the conviction that\nthe argument must, in any case, be accepted because there is no\nother alternative. Indeed, Heidegger\u2019s analysis opens the field for a\nconsideration of his own hermeneutic approach, which seeks to soften\nthe circle by grounding logic in metaphysics. He writes that the common-\nsense argument for the ultimacy of a free-floating logic \u2018lives and feeds\non something, something which the argument itself not only cannot\nproduce but which it even believes it must deny.\u2019131 This \u2018something\u2019\nis, in his view, the existential foundation of logic, a foundation which\nhe seeks to disclose through phenomenological analysis. The common-\nsense argument cannot produce these extra-logical foundations\nbecause its mode of thinking is restricted to the domain of logic. And\nit furthermore denies the existence of such foundations because it\ncontends that all other modes of thinking must ultimately reduce to\nlogic. Heidegger\u2019s existential-phenomenological account of thinking\ndisputes this lattermost claim.\nThese considerations, focussing on logic as the science of thinking,\nfind their place within Heidegger\u2019s broader existential conception\nof science. This broader conception was given detailed attention in\nChapter Two. Recall from there that Heidegger draws a distinction\nbetween logical and existential conceptions of science. The logical\nconception views science, in ideal terms, as a coherent body of true\npropositions, a conceptual scheme. It is important to emphasise,\nonce again, that Heidegger does not reject the logical conception of\nscience, but instead seeks to elucidate how it could have become at all\npossible, that is, to illuminate the grounds for its existence. He does\nthis through a phenomenological enquiry into the existential conditions\nwhich enable the emergence of the propositional stance presupposed\nby the logical conception. Heidegger described this process in terms\nof a change-over from immersed involvement in a work-world, where\nthings are taken up non-deliberatively as ready-to-hand, to a theoretical\nknowing which disengages from and objectifies things as present-at-\nhand within-the-world, thus determining them as a subject matter for\npropositional knowledge claims. In this chapter, we have seen how the\nchange-over in the way one understands the thingness of things also\n131 Heidegger (1984a), Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, p. 106. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 193\nprofoundly relates to the way thinking itself is understood. As things\ncome to be understood as property-bearing substances, or objects,\nthinking correspondingly comes to understand itself as a specific kind\nof object, one structured by propositions and formal rules. Logic, as the\nscience of thinking, thus comes to understand itself logically, as being\nnecessarily grounded in logic. In so doing, it loses sight of the historical\nchange-over from which it emerged, thus closing itself off from an\nunderstanding of its own existential grounds. As a consequence, the\nscience of thinking comes to misunderstand itself as a necessary and\nexclusive interpretation of thinking rather than as but one possible and\ncontingent way in which thinking may be thematised.\nHeidegger accepts Kant\u2019s claim that thinking must be fundamentally\nunderstood in terms of a faculty of rules, arguing that rule-following is\nan inevitable part of the thinking process.132 On this basis, he defines\nlogic, as the science of thinking, more narrowly as the \u2018science of the rules\nof thought,\u2019 and observes that one may follow rules without having a\nscientific understanding of them: \u2018the inescapability of rule usage does\nnot in itself immediately imply the inescapability of logic.\u2019133 Heidegger\nthus draws a clear line between rules, on the one hand, and logic, on\nthe other. The latter arises through the scientific study of the former,\nbut a science is neither presupposed nor entailed by the existence of\nits object of study. Indeed, Heidegger argues that rules, in the act of\nthinking, \u2018are not grasped as something at hand \u201cin consciousness.\u201d\u2019134\nWhile one is immersed in the act of thinking, the rules guiding that\nact are understood unreflectively in their readiness-to-hand; they are\nnot thematised as objects of deliberative attention. Because thinking,\nas rule-following, may proceed in the absence of logic, thinking does\nnot necessarily presuppose logic. Thus the vicious circularity of the\ncommon-sense argument \u2014 that logic presupposes logic \u2014 is softened\nwith the phenomenological argument that logic presupposes rules,\nbut rules do not entail logic. It follows, therefore, that logic is not\nultimate, and hence that metaphysics, as a form of thinking, need not\npresuppose logic. Indeed, Heidegger claims that his phenomenological\ninvestigation into the existential grounds of possibility for logic reveals\n132 Heidegger (1984a), Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, p. 104.\n133 Heidegger (1984a), Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, p. 104.\n134 Heidegger (1997), Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, p. 108. 194 Science as Social Existence\nthe metaphysical foundations of logic. It is logic which depends on\nmetaphysics, not the other way around.\nThe common-sense argument thus \u2018lives and feeds\u2019 on the prior\nexistence of unthematised and inescapable rules for thinking. Attention\nto these unthematised rules, however, provides only a description\nof what thinking fundamentally is, but not an explanation of how it\ncould at all be possible. Such rules, on their own, encompass neither\nthe metaphysical foundations of logic, in particular, nor of thinking, in\ngeneral. As we saw in the previous section, according to Heidegger, one\nof Kant\u2019s principal achievements was that he pointed the way forward\nfor such an explanation. Kant sought the conditions of possibility for\nthinking as such, consequentially locating them in the affectivity of\nthe subject, that is, in the phenomenon of respect before the law. The\nphenomenology of respect is meant to explain the normative force\nattributable to the laws governing thinking. Let us now consider\nHeidegger\u2019s attempts to build on Kant\u2019s insight.\n8. Time and Tradition at the\nExistential Root of Logic\nHeidegger\u2019s historical account of the relation between things and\nthinking began with his remarks on Plato\u2019s mythical image of the\ndemiurge. According to Heidegger, Plato\u2019s demiurge represents the idea\nof the good, that is, the fundamental standard which guides thinking into\nproper contact with things. The good allows us to distinguish between\nthe epistemically good and bad, between things which contribute to\nknowledge and those which do not. In this way, the good stands as\nthe indispensable a priori element in thinking, one making scientific\nknowledge, as such, possible. The condition of possibility for scientific\nknowledge is thus the grasp of the a priori element which binds thinking\ntogether with things in the production of knowledge. On this basis,\nHeidegger declares Plato \u2018the discoverer of the a priori.\u2019135 However,\nas discussed earlier, he furthermore observes that Plato\u2019s conception\nof the a priori, expressed with the image of the demiurge, possesses a\n\u2018mythical quality\u2019 through which the philosophical significance of the\n135 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 326. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 195\na priori fails to properly present itself. Heidegger\u2019s own account of the\nmetaphysical foundations of logic may thus be viewed as an attempt to\nmore fully articulate the philosophical significance of the a priori against\nthe historical backdrop of its original presentation in the ancient myth\nof the cosmic demiurge.\nAs noted earlier, Plato expresses the normative contribution made\nby the good to acts of cognitive discernment by drawing an analogy\nwith the light contributed by the sun to acts of visual discernment.\nOnly in the light of day can we reliably distinguish the real from mere\nshadows. Likewise, only in the \u2018illumination\u2019 of the good can we\nreliably distinguish epistemically valuable phenomena from irrelevant\nor deceptive ones. Successful acts of discrimination require the prior\nexistence of illumination, whether of a sensory or intellectual kind:\n\u2018What sunlight is for sensuous vision the idea tou agathon, the idea of\nthe good, is for scientific thinking, and in particular for philosophical\nknowledge.\u2019136 In Plato\u2019s work, then, the a priori was introduced as that\nwhich provides the illumination, or enlightenment, necessary for proper\nacts of epistemic discernment, and hence for knowledge in general.\nThe productive acts of the demiurge are not random acts of creation,\nbut display an order and coherence \u2014 an inherent and compelling\nintelligibility \u2014 a logos \u2014 which directly expresses the fundamental\ncontours of the good. As logos, the mythical image of the demiurge\npoints out, and so lets us see, the relations of significance, or meaning,\nwhich bring unity and purpose to acts of production. It manifests the\nhighest guiding principle of such action. The demiurge thus stands for\nthe a priori principle without which productive action, including the\nproduction of scientific knowledge, would not be possible.\nWhen Aristotle replaced the demiurge with the proposition, he\nnarrowed down and rendered more conceptually precise the content of\nthis guiding principle, and hence initiated a historical process in which\nthe a priori was progressively demythologised. According to Heidegger,\nthis was the foundational moment of logic as the science of thinking.\nLater in his life, Heidegger would remark that science demythologises\nmyth in much the same way one might drain a marshland, leaving only\n136 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 283. 196 Science as Social Existence\n\u2018dry\u2019 ground behind.137 In the earlier works from which the present\ndiscussion draws, however, Heidegger\u2019s mood is less glum. The\nyoung(ish) Heidegger sees himself as carrying forward a torch which\nhad passed through the hands of, among others, Aristotle, Descartes,\nand Kant, thus bringing the sharp light of scientific philosophy into\never remoter corners of Plato\u2019s inexhaustibly polysemous image of the\na priori as cosmic demiurge.\nHeidegger\u2019s intervention was enabled by Kant\u2019s critique of\nDescartes\u2019s doctrine of pure reason, including the a priori rules\ngoverning such reason. Kant sought to disclose the conditions making\nit possible for the subject to follow rules, locating those conditions in\nthe spontaneous receptivity of the subject\u2019s imagination. We saw earlier\nhow Heidegger criticised Kant\u2019s dependency on the Cartesian concept\nof the subject, arguing that the imagination is not the extant property\nof a thinking substance, but instead a basic structure of the subject\nconstrued as existence. In this section, we will focus on another aspect\nof Heidegger\u2019s critique of Kant\u2019s concept of imagination: the aspect of\ntime. By attending to the temporality of the imagination, Heidegger\nsought to further explicate the normativity of rule-following as first\nbroached by Kant in his phenomenology of respect.\nAccording to Heidegger, Kant argued that the spontaneity (or\nconstructivity) and receptivity (or affectivity) which are unified in\nthinking share a common root in the subject\u2019s imagination. Heidegger\ntakes this argument one step further, urging that this common root\nis itself rooted in the existential soil of \u2018original time.\u2019138 Original time\nmakes imagination, and hence thinking, possible. It is the existential\ncondition of possibility for imagination, conceived as the faculty of\nrules, and for thinking, conceived as rule-following. On Heidegger\u2019s\naccount, we are able to follow rules only because we exist in original\ntime. Original time thus replaces Plato\u2019s demiurge as the normative\nstandard providing a necessary guide for thinking.\nHeidegger\u2019s conceptualisation of thinking in terms of temporality\nis a natural consequence of his move from treating science as a body\nof concepts and formalised rules to treating it as a form of existence.\n137 Martin Heidegger (1996 [1984]), H\u00f6lderlin\u2019s Hymn \u2018The Ister,\u2019 trans. by William\nMcNeill and Julia Davis (Bloomington: Indiana University Press), p. 111.\n138 Heidegger (1997), Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, p. 137. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 197\nScience is not a static framework, but a dynamic activity of thinking\nand doing, a way of productively comporting oneself towards nature.\nOnce scientific thinking has been construed dynamically, as something\ncharacterised by motion or change, it is a small and natural step to view\nthinking as also involving a temporal aspect. Indeed, Heidegger points\nout that the a priori, by its very name, demonstrates the temporality of\nthinking. The a priori is what \u2018comes before\u2019 sensory experience in the\nthinking process. It helps us to bring coherence and meaning to that\nexperience by allowing us to discriminate between information which\nis salient and information which is not salient to the task at hand. The\ntemporality of scientific practice is evinced by the necessary relation\nbetween a priori rules and sensory information, both of which combine\nin the production of natural knowledge. Thinking thus presupposes\ntime. Heidegger writes that \u2018[t]ime is the way in which the mind lets\nitself be given anything at all.\u2019139 His urge to understand the conditions of\npossibility for scientific thinking, as such, therefore pushes him towards\na phenomenological investigation of the way time is experienced in the\nexistential act of thinking. This is an experience of what Heidegger calls\n\u2018original time.\u2019\nBefore turning to an explication of Heidegger\u2019s concept of original\ntime, it will be helpful to first examine the common understanding of\ntime to which he contrasts it. According to Heidegger, this common\nunderstanding was expressed in the first instance by Aristotle in his\nremarks, first, that \u2018time is not movement, but only movement in so far\nas it admits of enumeration,\u2019 second, that \u2018we discriminate [\u2026] more\nor less movement by time,\u2019 and, third, that time is therefore \u2018a kind\nof number\u2019 or something \u2018countable.\u2019 Aristotle furthermore observed\nthat time, insofar as it involves the \u2018before and after,\u2019 is measured in\nterms of the \u2018now.\u2019 Conceived of as motion enumerated in terms of the\n\u2018now,\u2019 time thus comes to be understood as a \u2018perpetual succession\u2019 of\nnows.140 During a 1927 lecture, Heidegger demonstrated the plausibility\nof Aristotle\u2019s definition by pulling his watch out of his vest pocket. \u2018I\n139 Martin Heidegger (2010a [1976]), Logic: The Question of Truth, trans. by Thomas\nSheehan (Bloomington: Indiana University Press), p. 280.\n140 Aristotle (1941c), Physica, trans. by R. P. Hardie and R. K. Gaye, in The Basic Works\nof Aristotle, ed. by Richard KcKeon (New York: Random House), pp. 213\u2013394 (p. 291\n[lines 219a3\u201312]); cf. Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, pp. 238\u201339. 198 Science as Social Existence\ntake my watch out of my pocket and follow the change of place of the\nsecond hand, and I read off one, two, three, four seconds or minutes.\nThis little rod, hurrying on, shows me the time, points to time for me,\nfor which reason we call it a pointer, a hand. I read off time from the\nmotion of the rod.\u2019141 Yet, Heidegger also observes that this common\nunderstanding of time does not tell us what time is, but only how\nwe may point to it, or read it off. Aristotle\u2019s definition is, he says, an\n\u2018access definition\u2019 or \u2018access characterisation\u2019; it tells us only how time\nmay become accessible.142 Indeed, returning his watch into his pocket,\nHeidegger asks: \u2018Where then is this time? Somewhere inside the works,\nperhaps, so that if I put the watch into my pocket again I have time in\nmy vest pocket? Naturally not.\u2019 He will raise the same puzzle again in a\n1935 lecture: \u2018This clock is set according to the German Observatory in\nHamburg. If we were to travel there and ask the people where they have\nthe time, we would be just as wise as before our journey.\u2019143 The use of\na watch, clock, or observatory only provides us with a means by which\nto precisely measure time in terms of the now. An understanding of\ntime as a perpetual succession of nows is already presupposed in these\nacts of measurement. Moreover, Aristotle defines the unit of measure\nby which time becomes accessible \u2014 the now \u2014 in terms of the \u2018before\nand after.\u2019 Responding to this, Heidegger observes that \u2018the experience\nof the before and after intrinsically presupposes, in a certain way, the\nexperience of time, the earlier and the later.\u2019144 Hence, the common\nunderstanding of time presupposes time. Aristotle\u2019s definition thus\nappears circular: \u2018[t]ime is time.\u2019145\nThis circularity is roughly homologous with the circularity of the\nargument addressed in the previous section, that logic presupposes\nlogic. There we saw how Heidegger softened the circle by differentiating\nbetween logic, as the science of rules, and the rules themselves. A\nscience of rules entails the prior existence of rules. A thematic, formal\nunderstanding of rules presupposes a non-thematic, existential\nunderstanding of rules. The difference is between rules present-at-hand,\n141 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 240.\n142 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, pp. 256\u201357.\n143 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 22.\n144 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 247.\n145 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 241. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 199\ntaken up as objects of study, and rules ready-to-hand, taken up\nas \u2018equipment\u2019 in the act of thinking. In similar fashion, Heidegger\ndistinguishes the common time expressed in clock usage from the\noriginal time presupposed by such usage. Common time is original time\nthematised and rendered countable in terms of the now. The common\nunderstanding of time as a perpetual succession of nows thus \u2018lives\nand feeds\u2019 on a prior existential understanding of original time. Just as\nAristotle narrowed thinking down to what can be explicitly expressed\nin the proposition, so too did he narrow time experience down to what\ncan be explicitly expressed as part of a succession of countable nows.\nThese remarks on rules and time merge in the case of an a priori rule.\nIn its very name, as what \u2018comes before,\u2019 an a priori rule would seem to\npossess an inherently temporal aspect. Yet, when the temporality of the\na priori is understood in terms of common time, difficulties arise. Under\nthis common understanding, we seem forced to posit the a priori as the\nfirst, or earliest, now in a perpetual succession of extant nows. But the\na priori is not properly characterised by its being the first in a series of\nsuch events, but rather by its being the condition of possibility for such\nevents. The a priori is not a countable now, but something which must\ncome before all countable nows. Indeed, the extant events of common\ntime presuppose the original temporality of the a priori. Hence, when\ntime experience is narrowed down to what can only be expressed\nexplicitly in terms of a succession of countable nows, the a priori must\nbe viewed as somehow existing beyond this perpetual string of extant\ntemporal moments. Seen from the perspective of common time, then, the\na priori must exist beyond time \u2014 it must be timeless. Hence, Heidegger\nwrites that, when orienting ourselves towards the common concept of\ntime, it becomes \u2018consistent to deny dogmatically that the a priori has\nanything to do with time.\u2019146 Furthermore, seen from the perspective of\ncommon time, thinking, insofar as it is grounded in a priori rules, must\nitself also be viewed as a consequentially timeless phenomenon. On\nsuch an account, it also becomes consistent to dogmatically deny that\nthinking, at its innermost, rule-governed core, has anything to do with\ntime. This would appear to give grounds for asserting that scientific\n146 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 325. 200 Science as Social Existence\nthinking draws its ultimate justification from a realm of rules which\nsomehow exists beyond time.\nThe momentum behind such dogmatism loses its strength, however,\nonce one recognises a role for original time in addition to, and as distinct\nfrom, common time. This recognition comes with the awareness that,\njust as there is a non-thematic way of experiencing rules, so too is there\na non-thematic way of experiencing time. Experienced non-thematically,\na priori rules need not appear to be uprooted from the soil of time. We\ndiscover the original temporality of a priori rules in our use of them as\n\u2018equipment\u2019 in the task of thinking, rather than in our thematisation, or\nforegrounding, of them as distinct and determinate objects of thinking.\nViewed phenomenologically, original time is experienced in the\ncourse of our immersed involvement in a work-world. As we saw in\nChapter Two, a work-world is structured by the equipmental relations\nin which the significance, or meaning, of a particular task is manifest.\nWhen we are immersed in a task, our attention is focussed not on\nthe equipment we are manipulating or otherwise using, but on the\nwork towards which we employ the equipment. In the midst of our\nundisturbed immersion in an equipmental context, we understand the\nthings we use as ready-to-hand rather than present-at-hand within-\nthe-world. Heidegger observes that \u2018[a]t the basis of this undisturbed\nimperturbability of our commerce with things, there lies a peculiar\ntemporality which makes it possible to take a handy equipmental\ncontexture in such a way that we lose ourselves in it.\u2019147 With this, he\ndraws our attention to the familiar experience of losing track of time\nwhile being immersed in a task. His point is that time does not disappear\nwhen we lose track of it. Our actions do not, in other words, suddenly\nbecome timeless. Rather, time is still there in the way we experience\nour actions, but we do not experience it numerically as a countable\nsuccession of nows, or as any kind of present-at-hand thing which is\n\u2018passing by,\u2019 but instead in a \u2018peculiar\u2019 way, as the temporality of what is\nready-to-hand in our productive acts of thinking and doing. Heidegger\nthus argues that temporality is the \u2018condition of the possibility of\nall understanding.\u2019148 Hence, we do not experience original time as\nan aspect or feature of the equipment we use in the course of work.\n147 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 309.\n148 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 274. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 201\nOriginal time is, rather, that which makes our equipmental dealings, our\nbasic understanding of things ready-to-hand, possible as a basic mode\nof existence. Heidegger characterises the way in which original time\nbecomes intelligible to us in the course of such equipmental dealings\nin terms of two kinds of relation: the \u2018in-order-to\u2019 (Um-zu) and the \u2018for-\nthe-sake-of-which\u2019 (Worumwillen).149 Each relation picks out a central\naspect of a ready-to-hand thing, for example, a pen. The \u2018in-order-to\u2019\nof the pen is its purpose: the task of writing. Yet the pen is not the sole\npiece of equipment which contributes to this task. Heidegger writes that\n\u2018[e]quipment is in terms of [aus] its belonging to other equipment: ink-\nstand, pen, ink, paper, blotting pad, table, lamp, furniture, windows,\ndoors, rooms.\u2019150 Before an individual piece of equipment can \u2018show\nitself\u2019 in this arrangement, \u2018a totality of equipment has already been\ndiscovered.\u2019151 The work-world in which the task of writing becomes\npractically intelligible is thus a relational manifold of ready-to-hand\nthings the totality of which facilitates the task of writing. Heidegger\nargues that the \u2018whatness\u2019 of a ready-to-hand thing is constituted by\nthe multiple relations in which the thing is able to show its use, its\nhandiness. The whatness of a piece of equipment is constituted by its\n\u2018assignedness\u2019 [Bewandtnis] within an overall equipmental context.152\nThe in-order-to relation, however, only describes the assignedness\nof equipment; it does not explain whence that assignedness comes.\nThis is where the \u2018for-the-sake-of-which\u2019 relation comes into play.\nHeidegger writes that \u2018[o]nly so far as the for-the-sake-of a can-be\nis understood can something like an in-order-to (a relation of\n149 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 271.\n150 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 97 [68].\n151 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 98 [69].\n152 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, pp. 292\u201393. In this context, I\nhave chosen to translate Bewandtnis as \u2018assignedness,\u2019 in preference to Hofstadter\u2019s\ntranslation, \u2018functionality.\u2019 \u2018Assignedness\u2019 better captures the connotation of\n\u2018directedness\u2019 present in Bewandtnis, emphasised in Heidegger\u2019s close comparison\nof Bewandtnis with Verweisen, \u2018assignment\u2019 or \u2018reference\u2019 (Martin Heidegger (1927),\nSein und Zeit (T\u00fcbingen: Max Niemeyer Verlag), pp. 83\u201384; cf. Heidegger (1962a),\nBeing and Time, p. 115 [84], where Bewandtnis is translated as \u2018involvement\u2019).\n\u2018Assignedness\u2019 also blocks unhelpful connotations of functionalism, which may be\nsuggested by Hofstadter\u2019s choice. I further address this delicate translation issue\nin Chapter Five, where I introduce and defend a context-specific translation of\nBewandtnis as \u2018end-directedness.\u2019 202 Science as Social Existence\nassignedness) be unveiled.\u2019153 The assignedness relation of the pen\ncan show itself only if one has already understood the for-the-sake-\nof-which relation which makes possible the practical intelligibility\nof the pen as equipment for writing. Only after one has understood\nthis relation can one be in a position to \u2018let\u2019 the pen be used as a pen.\nHeidegger writes that \u2018[l]etting-be-assigned [Bewendenlassen], as\nunderstanding of assignedness, is that projection which first of all\ngives to the Dasein the light in whose luminosity things of the nature\nof equipment are encountered.\u2019154\nHeidegger\u2019s use of the metaphor of illumination in this passage\nwas surely deliberate. The whatness, or what-being, of equipment is\nprojected as an illumination in which things may be \u2018seen\u2019 in their\nassignedness. Seeing, in this context, does not mean observing, but\nusing. For Heidegger, the using and manipulating of equipment \u2018has\nits own kind of sight, by which our manipulation is guided.\u2019155 He calls\nthis sight \u2018circumspection,\u2019 and argues that circumspection \u2018dwells\u2019\nin the multiple relations of an equipmental totality.156 Furthermore,\nHeidegger identifies the for-the-sake-of-which with the source of light\nwhich lets equipment be seen in its assignedness. He thus intended the\nfor-the-sake-of-which to be a critical reinterpretation of Plato\u2019s idea of\nthe good, which Plato had introduced by drawing an analogy to the sun.\nHeidegger writes that \u2018the idea tou agathon [i.e., the idea of the good]\nis the for-the-sake-of-which,\u2019 and that \u2018the for-the-sake-of-which excels\nthe ideas, but, in excelling them, it determines and gives them the form\nof wholeness, koinonia, communality.\u2019157 Like Plato\u2019s idea of the good,\nHeidegger\u2019s notion of the for-the-sake-of-which refers to a unifying\nprinciple, one which grants coherence to our experience by guiding\nus in discriminating cognitively valuable from irrelevant or deceptive\nphenomena. Just as the productive acts of Plato\u2019s demiurge display an\norder and coherence \u2014 an inherent and compelling intelligibility \u2014 so\ntoo do constructive acts of thinking, guided by the for-the-sake-of-which,\n153 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 295; translation modified.\n154 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 293; translation modified.\n155 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 98 [69].\n156 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, pp. 98 [69], 122 [88].\n157 Heidegger (1984a), Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, pp. 184\u201385. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 203\nexpress an order and coherence, whether of a practical or theoretical\nkind. Like Plato\u2019s mythical image of the demiurge, the for-the-sake-\nof-which stands for the a priori element binding together things and\nthinking in the production of knowledge.\nThrough this critical reinterpretation of the demiurge, Heidegger\nattempts to further spell out, in phenomenological terms, the\nphilosophical significance of Plato\u2019s mythical image. Unfortunately, he\nseems not to have got very far in realising this attempt, certainly not as\nfar as he may have thought he had. Recall from earlier that Heidegger\ncredits Kant with taking an important step forward on this path by\nlocating the conditions of possibility for rule-following, as such, in the\nfeeling of respect. We are able to follow rules because we are capable\nof being compelled by those rules, of being affected by them. In this\nway, the rules of thinking help us to make sense of our experience,\nincluding our experience of ourselves. According to Heidegger, Kant\nargued that respect is specifically a feeling of respect for oneself, that is,\nfor the self as Cartesian \u2018I.\u2019 However, as we saw, Kant actually claimed\nthat respect is a feeling felt towards another person, a virtuous person\nwhose actions exemplify the law or rule in question. Heidegger\u2019s own\nemphasis on the intersubjective nature of our faculty of rules is thus\nnot an innovative step beyond Kant, but rather a further elaboration\nof Kant\u2019s own original insight. On this account, then, the aprioricity of\nrules for thinking depends on the ontological priority of social relations\nover relations that \u2018I\u2019 have with myself. One can understand oneself as\nan \u2018I,\u2019 as an individual thinking substance, only because one is already\nimmersed in interpersonal relations which enable one to thematise and\narticulate one\u2019s subjectivity in this way. Heidegger writes that \u2018Being\nwith Others belongs to the Being of Dasein [\u2026] [A]s Being-with, Dasein\n\u201cis\u201d essentially for the sake of Others. This must be understood as an\nexistential statement as to its essence.\u2019158\nThe for-the-sake-of-which, as the a priori phenomenon binding\ntogether things and thinking in knowledge production, is thus a\nfundamentally social phenomenon. Its temporality is expressed non-\nthematically as the original time we experience in the course of our\n158 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 160 [123]. 204 Science as Social Existence\nnon-deliberative immersion in a work-world. This fundamental mode\nof existence is the a priori social and historical condition for any and\nall possible acts of knowing, both practical and theoretical. Heidegger\nholds that we experience these conditions as \u2018tradition\u2019 [\u00dcberlieferung].\nTradition, he writes, is the \u2018innermost character of our historicity,\u2019\nand we come to know it as the manifest \u2018lore\u2019 [Kunde] of the historical\nworld in which we find and understand ourselves.159 The lore in which\ntradition is manifest \u2018carries and leads the historical being of the era\u2019\nin which we live.160 Thus, on Heidegger\u2019s account, it is tradition which\nturns out to provide the a priori unifying phenomenon which bind\ntogether things and thinking, thus providing the basic conditions of\npossibility for the production of knowledge in its broadest possible\nsense. The soil in which Plato\u2019s demiurge, Kant\u2019s imagination, and\nHeidegger\u2019s for-the-sake-of-which are finally rooted, that soil from\nwhich the existential rules governing thinking draw their sustenance, is\nthe soil of tradition. Hence logic, through its reliance on existential rules,\nturns out to itself be ultimately grounded in tradition. According to\nHeidegger, then, tradition provides the existential foundation for logic.\nAs a consequence, the origins and essence of scientific thinking must lie\nnot in an abstract and timeless realm of a priori logical rules, but in the\nrich social and historical fabric of our shared and largely unthematised\nco-existence as finite human beings. \u2018[O]ur spiritual history,\u2019 writes\nHeidegger \u2014 using an adjective (geistig) which might just as well be\ntranslated as \u2018intellectual\u2019 or \u2018mental\u2019 \u2014 \u2018is bound 2000 years back.\u2019161\n159 Heidegger (2009), Logic as the Question Concerning the Essence of Language, p. 98.\n160 Heidegger (2009), Logic as the Question Concerning the Essence of Language, p. 78. For\nthis reason, James McGuire and Barbara Tuchanska err in writing that \u2018Heidegger\ndoes not squarely consider history as a succession of generations, a process within\nwhich the handing down and inheriting of cultural heritage from predecessors\noccurs\u2019 (James E. McGuire and Barbara Tuchanska (2000), Science Unfettered: A\nPhilosophical Study in Sociohistorical Ontology (Athens OH: Ohio University Press), p.\n74). \u2018Handing down\u2019 is just what \u00dcberlieferung means. They also fail to appreciate\nHeidegger\u2019s claim that being-with-others is elemental for the subject: \u2018If the\nonly ontological ground for cognition lies in the existential structures of Dasein,\ncognition remains an individual activity\u2019 (p. 80). Hence, they falsely conclude that,\nfor Heidegger, \u2018science is a way of being of Dasein, not of communities\u2019 (p. 81),\nmissing the fact that Heidegger\u2019s subject is an essentially social entity, \u2018essentially\nfor the sake of Others.\u2019\n161 Heidegger (2009), Logic as the Question Concerning the Essence of Language, p. 7. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 205\nPlato\u2019s discovery of the a priori was a discovery of the way in which\ntradition guides and gives shape to thinking, hence making possible\nits intelligible combination with the things of experience. The a priori\nprovides the light in which thinking lets things be experienced as\nwhat they are. It is, furthermore, the source of the semantic, syntactic,\nand practical rules which make language use possible as a form of\nintelligible behaviour.162 Or, to take a non-linguistic artefact, the a priori\nis the basis in tradition through which a pen may become what it is as\nan instrument for writing.\nHaving employed the methods of phenomenological history to trace\nthe ontological origins of science back to tradition, Heidegger seems to\nhave slowly lost any further interest in this project. Perhaps this reveals\nthe limitations of his existential-phenomenological method, with its\nfocus on an archaeological investigation into the subject\u2019s interior layers\nof historically sedimented understanding. Such a method would seem\nnot especially well-suited for a more detailed exploration of the social\nand historical dimensions of science conceived as tradition. Once he\nhad excavated the scientific subject down to its existential base in the\nbedrock of tradition, Heidegger\u2019s interests shifted increasingly towards\nthose possibilities latent in the tradition but excluded by Aristotle\u2019s\nnarrowing of the logos down to what can only be expressed within the\nformal structure of the proposition. He thus turned his attention more\nand more to non-scientific modes of subjectivity. Rather than further\nattending to the language of science, as determined by the proposition,\nHeidegger would instead declare in 1934 that the \u2018original language is\nthe language of poetry.\u2019163 Many of his subsequent reflections on science\nwould focus more negatively on scientific thinking as a historically\ncontingent constraint imposed on the original scope and power of\npoetry as an essential expression of human experience. Hence, for the\nremainder of this chapter, we will trade the methods of phenomenology\nfor those of sociology in order to more fully elaborate some of the\npositive implications of Heidegger\u2019s conclusion that logic is rooted in\nthe social soil of tradition.\n162 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 120 [87].\n163 Heidegger (2009), Logic as the Question Concerning the Essence of Language, p. 141. 206 Science as Social Existence\n9. From the Phenomenology of Thinking to the\nSociology of Knowledge\nIn a 1928 lecture, Heidegger argued that a fundamental philosophical\nstudy of subjectivity \u2018remains prior to every psychology, anthropology,\nand characterology, but also prior to all ethics and sociology.\u2019164 He\nseems to have held that the human and social sciences would remain\nunclear or in error until the object of their study \u2014 human being, whether\ntaken individually or collectively \u2014 had been properly clarified in its\nfundamental structure. This clarification was the task Heidegger took\nup in Being and Time, which had appeared in 1927. Indeed, not only was\nthe bulk of that book concerned with a phenomenological description\nof human subjectivity, the fourth chapter specifically addressed \u2018being-\nwith\u2019 (Mitsein), that is, the essential relation between the subject\u2019s\nbeing-in-the-world with its equally fundamental existential state of\nbeing-with-others.\nSection 27 of that chapter focussed on the \u2018they,\u2019 which badly\ntranslates the German neologism das Man. The concept of the \u2018they\u2019\nis meant to pick out the way in which one uncritically blends in\nwith one\u2019s fellows in the course of everyday life: \u2018In utilizing public\nmeans of transport and in making use of information services such as\nthe newspaper, every Other is like the next.\u2019165 The point seems a bit\noverstated, but the idea is sound: those who live together in a common\nsociety are continuously, and often imperceptibly, pushed into the same\nsettled and uniform patterns of behaviour. Furthermore, these social\nconditions directly affect, and thus serve to organise, our intellectual\nand emotional lives: \u2018We take pleasure and enjoy ourselves as they [man]\ntake pleasure; we read, see, and judge about literature and art as they see\nand judge; likewise we shrink back from the \u201cgreat mass\u201d as they shrink\nback; we find \u201cshocking\u201d what they find shocking.\u2019166 Heidegger goes on\nto observe that a person, by critically reflecting on her embeddedness\nin the \u2018they,\u2019 may discover less everyday possibilities for thinking\nand acting in the world, possibilities which may then enable her to\nexpress her personhood in a more unique or individualised manner.\n164 Heidegger (1984a), Metaphysical Foundations of Logic, p. 17.\n165 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 164 [126].\n166 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 164 [126\u201327]. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 207\nThe distinguishing features of a unique individual are thus not to be\ntaken as a sign of her separateness from the group, but of her success\nat exploiting the less well-trodden possibilities made available by her\nparticipation in a shared tradition. Heidegger\u2019s discussion is sometimes\nread as suggesting that the achievement of such individuality is a rare\nfeat, performed only by an elite few, but this is neither here nor there.\nThe interesting theoretical observation is that individuality derives\nfrom sociality, that individualism is enabled and maintained by and in\nan irreducibly social existence.\nIn a 1947 essay, Heidegger reflected back on his earlier discussion of\nthe \u2018they\u2019 (das Man), writing that \u2018[w]hat has been said in Sein und Zeit\n[Being and Time], \u00a7\u00a727 and 35, about the word \u201cman\u201d (the impersonal\none) is not simply meant to furnish, in passing, a contribution to\nsociology [soll keineswegs nur einen beil\u00e4ufigen Beitrag zur Soziologie\nliefern].\u2019167 Section 35 is a narrower application of the argument from\n\u00a727 to the specific case of everyday versus unconventional forms of\nspeech, and need not delay us here. Heidegger\u2019s 1947 comment affirms\nthat \u00a727 of Being and Time was meant to make a fundamental, rather\nthan an incidental, contribution to sociology.168 There is thus no clear\nevidence that Heidegger harboured an animosity toward sociology.\nIndeed, in a 1934 lecture, when addressing the definition of das Volk,\nor \u2018the people,\u2019 he suggested that \u2018[w]e could for this purpose follow\na new science, sociology, that is, the doctrine of the forms of society\nand community.\u2019169 He declines to go this route, however, alleging that\nsociology\u2019s search for definitions presupposes that das Volk is a present-\nat-hand thing, a substance with fixed and timeless properties, a thing\nwithout a history. In sum, Heidegger does not reject sociology, but\n167 Martin Heidegger (1962b [1949]), \u2018Letter on Humanism,\u2019 trans. by Edgar Lohner,\nin Philosophy in the Twentieth Century, vol. 3, ed. by William Barrett and Henry D.\nAiken (New York: Random House), pp. 271\u2013302 (p. 273); my brackets, taken from\nMartin Heidegger (1949), \u00dcber den Humanismus (Frankfurt: Vittorio Klostermann),\npp. 9\u201310.\n168 This point gets somewhat lost in the more widely available translation, by Frank\nA. Capuzzi and J. Glenn Gray, of the 1947 passage: \u2018What is said in Being and\nTime (1927), sections 27 and 35, about the \u201cthey\u201d in no way means to furnish an\nincidental contribution to sociology\u2019 (Martin Heidegger (1993b [1947]), \u2018Letter\non Humanism,\u2019 trans. by Frank A. Capuzzi and J. Glenn Gray, in Basic Writings,\nrevised and expanded edn, ed. by David Farrell Krell (New York: HarperCollins),\npp. 217\u201365 (p. 221)).\n169 Heidegger (2009), Logic as the Question Concerning the Essence of Language, p. 59. 208 Science as Social Existence\nrather criticises it for allegedly failing to recognise that the existential\nconditions governing social relations, including the relations governing\nknowledge production, are historically contingent conditions, that is,\nconditions rooted in a tradition.\nHeidegger thus meant for his existential phenomenology to, among\nother things, provide sociology with a more defensible account of the\nexistential conditions of possibility governing its core subject matter.\nWe will set aside the question of whether Heidegger\u2019s criticism offers\na fair portrayal of the sociology of his time. What seems clear, however,\nis that it does not find much traction against the more recent sociology\nof knowledge \u2014 SSK in particular \u2014 which recognises the historical\nand social contingency of the conditions determining its own scientific\nmethod. Here, then, Heidegger\u2019s scientific philosophy does resonate\nwith the more recent scientific sociology. Both methods regard science\nas a finite, social and historical practice, and both methods attempt to\nreflexively style themselves in accordance with this model of science.\nThe underlying assumption in both cases is that science provides\nthe most reliable and authoritative basis for knowledge. David Bloor\nhas been especially clear on this point: \u2018I am more than happy to see\nsociology resting on the same foundations and assumptions as other\nsciences. [\u2026] For that foundation is our culture. Science is our form of\nknowledge.\u2019170 Furthermore, both Barry Barnes and Harry Collins have\nnoted the important influence of phenomenological methods on the\nway sociology of knowledge has developed since Heidegger\u2019s time.171\nThere is, then, a methodological thread running consequentially from\nHeidegger\u2019s phenomenology of thinking to the more recent sociology\nof knowledge.\nAs was mentioned at the end of the last section, Heidegger would\neventually lose his enthusiasm for scientific philosophy, and begin\nfollowing other fundamental threads in the tradition of thinking.\nNevertheless, his phenomenological study of logic, construed as the\nscience of thinking, constitutes his own reflexive attempt to lay hold\n170 Bloor (1991), Knowledge and Social Imagery, pp. 160\u201361.\n171 Barry Barnes (1974), Scientific Knowledge and Sociological Theory (London: Routledge\n& Kegan Paul), pp. vii, 43; Harry M.

Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 209\nof the conditions of possibility governing his own particular form of\nscientific philosophy. This affords us a conceptual bridge over which\nto now cross from the phenomenology of logic to the sociology of logic.\n10. The Social Foundations of Logic\nThe sociology of logic challenges the view that the basic principles\nof logical thinking are resistant to sociological explanation. The key\nassumption which must be cast into doubt is that such principles enjoy\nan absolute ground impervious to the vagaries of historical and social\nlife. This chapter has attempted to reconstruct Heidegger\u2019s account of\nhow this assumption came into being, and how it has subsequently\nfallen into doubt.\nIn the first instance, Descartes applied a mathematical interpretation\nto the proposition, which may have been motivated in part by the\nChristian doctrine of salvation, in order to establish thinking on a\npure and absolute ground. He furthermore argued that the pure and\nabsolute core of thinking, the individual \u2018I,\u2019 must act in accordance with\nan unrestricted law of non-contradiction. In the second instance, Kant\naddressed the question of what the \u2018I\u2019 must be like in order to be bound\nby rules like the law of non-contradiction. This question, observed\nHeidegger, is the basic problem of logic. By asking it, Kant effectively\nremoved the law of non-contradiction from its position of dominance,\ninstead explaining laws in terms of the faculty of imagination. Heidegger\nsubsequently rooted the imagination in the soil of tradition, which is\nmanifest, and hence made available for deliberate transmission, as an\naccumulated body of lore. It is through our participation in a historical\ntradition that the world becomes intelligible for us, and tradition does\nthis by enabling us to properly follow the rules which give structure\nto thinking. Tradition allows us to make sense of things, to let things\nbe what they are, by supplying us with the informal existential\nrules we need to bring our thinking into proper contact with things.\nThese existential rules are historically manifest as lore, and may be\nsubsequently formalised as logic.\nThere are striking similarities between Heidegger\u2019s account of\nlogic and the one afforded by SSK practitioners. Indeed, Barnes and\nBloor have characterised logic as a \u2018body of conventions and esoteric 210 Science as Social Existence\ntraditions,\u2019 as well as a \u2018learned body of scholarly lore.\u2019172 Barnes has\nalso written, more generally, that the teacher of science is concerned\nprimarily with \u2018transmitting lore.\u2019173 Furthermore, like Heidegger, Barnes\nand Bloor distinguish between the \u2018varied systems of logic as they are\ndeveloped by logicians,\u2019 on the one hand, and the \u2018informal intuitions\nupon which they all depend for their operation,\u2019 on the other.174 Bloor\nhas elaborated an account of this distinction as one holding between\nformal and informal kinds of knowledge, and emphasised \u2018the priority\nof the informal over the formal.\u2019175 This appears similar to Heidegger\u2019s\ndistinction between thematised and unthematised forms of thinking, as\nwell the existential priority he gives to the latter over the former.\nBloor\u2019s central claims are that the formal rules of reasoning are\nalways the instruments of informal reasoning, and hence that any\nparticular application of a formal rule is always a potential subject for\ninformal social negotiation.176 In some cases, the application of a formal\nrule is not actually subject to negotiation because it is embedded in a\nhighly standardised but informal context of shared practice. As Barnes\nand Bloor observe, in such cases everyone, or nearly everyone, just\naccepts the application of the rule without question. The application\nappears self-evidently appropriate, and thus requires no reasoned\njustification.177 As one example of a rule which enjoys this kind of status,\nBloor identifies the law of non-contradiction.\nBloor begins his discussion of the law of non-contradiction by\nturning to Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard\u2019s classic study of witchcraft\namong the Azande of Central Africa. According to Evans-Pritchard,\nthe Azande treat witchcraft as an inherited physical trait, passed on\nfrom fathers to sons or from mothers to daughters.178 He comments\n172 Barry Barnes and David Bloor (1982), \u2018Relativism, Rationalism and the Sociology\nof Knowledge,\u2019 in Rationality and Relativism, ed. by Martin Hollis and Steve Lukes\n(Oxford: Blackwell), pp. 21\u201347 (p. 45).\n173 Barnes (1974), Scientific Knowledge and Sociological Theory, p. 64.\n174 Barnes and Bloor (1982), \u2018Relativism, Rationalism and the Sociology of Knowledge,\u2019\np. 44.\n175 Bloor (1991), Knowledge and Social Imagery, p. 133.\n176 Bloor (1991), Knowledge and Social Imagery, p. 133.\n177 Barnes and Bloor (1982), \u2018Relativism, Rationalism and the Sociology of Knowledge,\u2019\np. 46.\n178 Edward E. Evans-Pritchard (1937), Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic among the Azande\n(Oxford: Clarendon), p. 23. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 211\nthat \u2018[t]o our minds it appears evident that if a man is proven a witch\nthe whole of his clan are ipso facto witches, since the Zande clan is a\ngroup of persons related biologically to one another through the male\nline.\u2019179 Yet, the Azande do not see things this way. They recognised\nthe theoretical sense of Evans-Pritchard\u2019s argument, but in practice\nthey only consider the close paternal kinsmen of a known witch to be\nwitches. Their practice would thus seem to contradict the theoretical\nimplications of their beliefs about the inter-generational transmission of\nwitchcraft substance. Evans-Pritchard concludes from this that practical\nnegotiations of belief \u2018free Azande from having to admit what appear\nto us to be the logical consequences of belief in biological transmission\nof witchcraft.\u2019180 For example, the Azande reason that even if a man is\nthe son of a witch, and so has inherited witch-substance, that substance\nmay remain \u2018cool\u2019 throughout his life. If his witchcraft is never activated,\nthen he can hardly be considered a witch.181 Hence, Evans-Pritchard\nobserves that \u2018Azande do not perceive the contradiction as we perceive\nit because they have no theoretical interest in the subject, and those\nsituations in which they express their beliefs in witchcraft do not force\nthe problem on them.\u2019182\nBloor\u2019s response to this has a positive and a negative side. On the\nnegative side, he argues that Evans-Pritchard\u2019s analysis involves two\ncentral ideas: first, that there really is a contradiction in Zande views\nwhether the Azande see it or not; and second, that if the Azande were\nto recognise the contradiction, one of their major social institutions\nwould be untenable. The first idea has to do with the uniqueness of\nlogic, and the second with the authority of logic.183 Bloor rejects both\nideas. In the first instance, he argues that there is no contradiction in\nZande beliefs about witchcraft because the Azande may be seen to use\na different logic. Hence, Evans-Pritchard\u2019s premise of uniqueness must\nbe rejected.184 There is a standard Zande logic and a standard Western\nlogic. In the second instance, Bloor argues that both logics exercise little\n179 Evans-Pritchard (1937), Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic, p. 24.\n180 Evans-Pritchard (1937), Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic, p. 24.\n181 Evans-Pritchard (1937), Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic, p. 25.\n182 Evans-Pritchard (1937), Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic, p. 25.\n183 Bloor (1991), Knowledge and Social Imagery, p. 139.\n184 Bloor (1991), Knowledge and Social Imagery, p. 139. 212 Science as Social Existence\nauthority over the practical negotiations of those who invoke them.185\nWith the Azande, logic does not threaten their institution of witchcraft\nbecause one piece of logic can always be used against another, and even\nthis is only necessary when logic is used by someone to pose a threat.\nBut then it is the person, not the logic, who threatens.186 In such cases,\ninformal reasoning, or practical negotiation, takes priority over formal\nreasoning. Hence, Bloor alleges that Evans-Pritchard was also wrong\nto think that logical contradictions, where they exist, must necessarily\nthreaten social stability if they are allowed explicit articulation.\nAs observations about the nature of logic and its relationship to\ninformal reasoning, both of these points seem convincing. However,\nthey do not work as a negative assessment of Evans-Pritchard\u2019s own\nviews. As can be seen from the passages just quoted, Evans-Pritchard\nemphasised that the Zande doctrine of witchcraft contains \u2018what\nappears to us\u2019 to be a logical contradiction; he writes that \u2018to our minds\u2019\nthere is a contradiction in Zande beliefs. Elsewhere, he has argued\nthat \u2018[w]hat appear to be hopeless contradictions when translated into\nEnglish may not appear so in the native language.\u2019187 Furthermore, in\nan appreciation of Lucien L\u00e9vy-Bruhl, Evans-Pritchard writes that\n\u2018primitive mystical thought is organized into a coherent system with\na logic of its own.\u2019188 This is no assertion of uniqueness. As Mary\nDouglas has observed, Evans-Pritchard in fact strongly opposed the\nidea that those peoples who fail to employ standard Western logic\nare \u2018illogical,\u2019 or \u2018non-logical,\u2019 or \u2018pre-logical.\u2019189 Furthermore, Douglas\nargues that Evans-Pritchard also rejected the idea that formal logic\nshould be granted authority over informal practical negotiation. She\nwrites that \u2018[w]ell before phenomenology\u2019s claim that sociological\nunderstanding must start from the negotiating activities of conscious,\nintelligent agents, Evans-Pritchard had seized the problem, developed\na method and shown what progress can be made.\u2019190 Thus there is, in\n185 Bloor (1991), Knowledge and Social Imagery, p. 140.\n186 Bloor (1991), Knowledge and Social Imagery, p. 141.\n187 Edward E.

Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 213\nfact, a strong doctrinal continuity between Bloor and Evans-Pritchard.\nThey are friends, not foes.191 It must be noted, however, that Douglas\u2019s\nattempt to grant Evans-Pritchard precedence over phenomenology fails\nto acknowledge that Heidegger\u2019s argument in Being and Time for the\nexistential priority of practice over theory, as well his description of the\n\u2018they\u2019 as the existential condition of possibility for social negotiation as\nsuch, pre-date Evans-Pritchard\u2019s earliest publications by several years.\nBut there is no evidence that Evans-Pritchard had read Heidegger, nor\nis there any attempt in Being and Time to elaborate a sociological notion\nof negotiation. It would be better here to speak of synchronicity, rather\nthan of priority.\nLet us move on, then, to the positive side of Bloor\u2019s analysis. Like\nEvans-Pritchard, Bloor blocks the parochial and paternalistic charge\nthat the Azande are guilty of ignoring a contradiction in their reasoning.\nThe problem arises because we are insensitive to the specific existential\nconditions which give shape to Zande social life: \u2018The fact that we\ncan imagine extending the witchcraft accusation to the whole of the\nclan is simply because we do not really feel the pressure against this\nconclusion.\u2019192 Furthermore, if we did feel the absurdity of the conclusion,\nwe could easily give reasons to reject it, if this were deemed necessary.\nThe Azande, for example, drew from their well-established notion of\n\u2018cool\u2019 witches in response to Evans-Pritchard\u2019s theoretical queries. And,\nBloor argues, we make precisely the same kinds of moves in our own\nWestern scientific culture: \u2018the Azande think very much as we do.\u2019193\nBloor argues that the process of intellectual elaboration, where\nreasons are introduced to deflect unwanted conclusions, is a pervasive\nfeature of our science. He gives two historical examples.194 The first\n191 In fact, both also share a legacy stretching back to the experimental psychologist\nFrederick Bartlett. On the one hand, Bloor recognises Bartlett as \u2018a prototype\nsociologist of scientific knowledge\u2019 (David Bloor (2000), \u2018Whatever Happened\nto \u201cSocial Constructiveness\u201d?,\u2019 in Bartlett, Culture & Cognition, ed. by Akiko Saito\n(London: Psychology Press), pp. 194\u2013215 (p. 196); see also David Bloor (1997a),\n\u2018Remember the Strong Program?,\u2019 Science, Technology, & Human Values 22(3), 373\u201385).\nOn the other hand, as Douglas observes, Evans-Pritchard adopted heavily from\nBartlett, his own work thus displaying a \u2018continuous relationship\u2019 with Bartlett\u2019s\nearlier studies of conventionalisation in perception (Douglas (1980), Evans-Pritchard,\np. 26).\n192 Bloor (1991), Knowledge and Social Imagery, p. 142.\n193 Bloor (1991), Knowledge and Social Imagery, p. 145.\n194 Bloor (1991), Knowledge and Social Imagery, pp. 143\u201345. 214 Science as Social Existence\nconcerns the phlogiston theory of combustion, a chemical theory which\ndominated in the eighteenth century and which has since been rejected.\nProponents of this theory held that a metal is comprised of phlogiston\nand calx, or what we now call oxide. It was thought that when a metal\nis burned, the phlogiston is removed from it, leaving only calx behind.\nIt was, however, discovered that the calx was heavier than the original\nmetal, which raised the question of how the weight of a substance could\nbe increased by taking something away from it. Some historians have\nargued that these circumstances logically imply that phlogiston must\nhave a negative weight, an absurd conclusion which therefore doomed\nthe theory. Yet, Bloor writes, most of those who adhered to phlogiston\ntheory did not draw this conclusion. They instead reasoned that when\nphlogiston leaves the metal another, heavier, substance must take its\nplace. The best candidate for this replacement was thought to be water.\nHence, the conclusion that phlogiston must have a negative weight\nwas deflected. It now only became necessary to hold that phlogiston\nwas much lighter than water. The logic of subtraction \u2014 the removal\nof phlogiston from the metal through combustion \u2014 was thus traded\nfor a logic of replacement \u2014 water substitutes for phlogiston during\nthe combustion of the metal. Advocates of phlogiston theory were not\ncontradicting a tacitly held logic of subtraction; they were using another\nsort of logic altogether.\nThe second of Bloor\u2019s examples comes from the atomic theory of\nchemistry. At the turn of the nineteenth century, Joseph Louis Gay-\nLussac discovered a regularity in the way gases combine. One volume\nof gas always combines with some small whole number of volumes\nof another gas, where volume measurements are controlled for\ntemperature and pressure. Thus, two volumes of hydrogen combine\nwith one volume of oxygen to produce one volume of gaseous water.\nBecause John Dalton\u2019s atomic theory explained chemical combinations\nby the direct combination of atoms, Gay-Lussac\u2019s results suggested that\ntwo hydrogen atoms must combine with one atom of oxygen to produce\none compound atom of water. Each volume of gas therefore contains the\nsame number of atoms. The trouble with this hypothesis, however, was\nthat one volume of nitrogen could combine with one volume of oxygen\nto produce two volumes of nitric oxide. This suggested that one volume\nof nitric oxide contained only half the number of atoms of the original 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 215\nvolumes of nitrogen and oxygen. The idea that volumes contained the\nsame number of atoms could now only be maintained if one assumed\nthat atoms could be split in half. But Dalton resisted this conclusion, as\nhe was not prepared to give up the doctrine of the indivisibility of the\natom. There was a contradiction between this doctrine and the alleged\nregularity discovered by Gay-Lussac. Perhaps Gay-Lussac was wrong?\nAs Bloor observes, the conclusion that atoms are divisible is easily\navoided without rejecting Gay-Lussac\u2019s results. One need only assume\nthat each atom of gas is really a particle composed of two atoms. When\nnitrogen and oxygen combine, they swap atoms. The combination is\nnot the result of addition, as when hydrogen and oxygen combine to\nform water, but rather of substitution. We now know this solution as\nAvagadro\u2019s hypothesis. This was a simple elaboration which supplanted\nthe earlier logic of addition with a logic of substitution, thus allowing\nfor a negotiation around a potential contradiction without giving up\neither Gay-Lussac\u2019s useful empirical results or the doctrine of atomic\nindivisibility.\nBloor argues that this negotiation is of a piece with both eighteenth-\ncentury negotiations around alleged contradictions in phlogiston theory\nand twentieth-century negotiations around alleged contradictions in\nZande beliefs about witchcraft. He emphasises that the Azande and\nWestern scientists think in the same general way, writing that \u2018they\nhave the same psychology [\u2026] but radically different institutions.\u2019195 An\ninstitution is, on Bloor\u2019s definition, \u2018a collective pattern of self-referring\nactivity.\u2019196 A rule, or a group of rules, a logic, is an institution in this\nsense. To say that a logic is self-referring is to recognise that its validity is\ninternal to the collective patterns of activity in which the logic becomes\nmanifest. So, when we accuse the Azande of contradiction, our statement\nin fact refers, not to Zande logic, but to our own. We treat the Azande\nas if they were a part of our own community. Because the accusation\ncarries force only within our own community, it is not surprising that\nit left the Azande unmoved. By the same token, the accusation that\nGay-Lussac\u2019s discovery contradicts the doctrine of atomic indivisibility\npresupposes a kind of chemical thinking in which gas particles are\ncomposed of only one atom. But this way of thinking was renegotiated\n195 Bloor (1991), Knowledge and Social Imagery, p. 145.\n196 Bloor (1997b), Wittgenstein, Rules and Institutions (London: Routledge), p. 33. 216 Science as Social Existence\nwith the introduction of Avagadro\u2019s hypothesis. Hence the accusation\ncarries force only in reference to a kind of chemical thinking which,\nthrough a process of negotiation, has now become obsolete.\nThe circular validity of self-referring logical domains is captured\nin Heidegger\u2019s observation that logic, when treated as the ultimate\nground for all thinking, must also ground itself. As discussed earlier,\nHeidegger characterised this as the argument that logic is \u2018free-floating\u2019\nand \u2018ultimate,\u2019 that it grounds all other forms of thinking without\nrequiring a further ground of its own. Heidegger challenged this\nargument by differentiating logic, as a system of formal rules, from\ninformal, existential rules. The former is grounded in the latter. He\nfurthermore conceptualises existential rules in terms of original time,\nwhich is manifest in two types of relation: in-order-to relations and for-\nthe-sake-of-which relations. This distinction between relations plays\na role similar to the distinction Bloor makes between a self-referring\npractice and what \u2018primes\u2019 that practice. It is, he writes, a characteristic\nof self-referring practices that a separate account must be given of their\norigin, of how they get going, and this account must be presented in\nterms lying outside the domain of the practice itself.197 In other words,\nthe priming element must exist prior to the practice; it is the a priori\nelement which makes the practice possible.\nBloor\u2019s self-referring practices, his institutions, recall Heidegger\u2019s\ndescription of the multiple relations of the in-order-to. The assignedness\nof a work-world is manifest in the in-order-to relations making up that\nworld. These relations represent the significance, or meaning, of a work-\nworld. The for-the-sake-of-which relation, on the other hand, provides\nthe origins of that assignedness. In-order-to relations thus depend for\ntheir own existence on the prior existence of the for-the-sake-of-which.\nThe latter provides the conditions of possibility for being assigned,\nfor significance, as such. This looks a lot like Bloor\u2019s priming element,\nwhich works to get the self-referring practice going. As discussed earlier,\nHeidegger\u2019s notion of the for-the-sake-of-which is a phenomenological\nreinterpretation of Plato\u2019s idea of the good. It serves as the fundamental\nfeature of thinking enabling us to discriminate between epistemically\n197 Bloor (1997b), Wittgenstein, Rules and Institutions, p. 32. Bloor adopts this notion of\npriming from Barry Barnes (1983), \u2018Social Life as Bootstrapped Induction,\u2019 Sociology\n17(4), 524\u201345 (p. 529). 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 217\nrelevant and irrelevant phenomena, and hence to connect thinking with\nthings in a coherent and meaningful way. The for-the-sake-of-which\nserves, in other words, as the normative principle guiding thinking.\nBloor writes that \u2018the mystery of logical compulsion is [\u2026] the\nmystery of normativity.\u2019198 Normativity emerges as individuals fall into\nregularised patterns of self-referential activity. Only as participants\nembedded in such patterns of regularised activity will individuals feel\ncompelled to follow those patterns. The Azande interviewed by Evans-\nPritchard in the 1930s, for example, were not embedded in the patterned\nactivities constitutive of Western logic, and so they did not feel the force\nof the contradiction alleged by Evans-Pritchard to exist within their\ndoctrine of witchcraft. They could see the sense of it, but it did not move\nthem, did not affect them. Normativity thus provides a necessary basis\nfor logic as an institution, but the specific norms governing a particular\nlogic will carry force only within the finite bounds of the specific\nsocial and historical setting in which that logic is sustained as a form\nof thinking. According to Heidegger, Kant cracked open the problem\nof normativity by asking what the human being must be like in order\nto be compelled by a rule. He suggested that human beings must be\nsuch that they are affected by the law, that they feel respect before the\nlaw as it is manifest in the actions of others. This claim resonates with\nBloor\u2019s own statement that \u2018[w]e are compelled by rules in so far as\nwe, collectively, compel one another.\u2019199 Bloor furthermore specifies that\n\u2018the compelling character of rules resides merely in the habit or tradition\nthat some models be used rather than others.\u2019200 This invites comparison\nwith Heidegger\u2019s claim that the for-the-sake-of-which, as the normative\nelement in thinking, is itself rooted in the soil of tradition. Both Bloor\nand Heidegger seek to dispel the mystery of normativity by tracing\nits origin back to tradition. For both, what primes an informal domain\nof logic, what compels its users into regularised patterns of common\nactivity, is the tradition into which those users have been socialised.\nAs mentioned earlier, Heidegger\u2019s analysis of logic comes to an end\nat this point. He identified the source of normativity in logic, but did\nnot ply deeper into its structure. Bloor has, on the other hand, done\n198 Bloor (1997b), Wittgenstein, Rules and Institutions, p. 2.\n199 Bloor (1997b), Wittgenstein, Rules and Institutions, p. 22.\n200 Bloor (1991), Knowledge and Social Imagery, p. 138. 218 Science as Social Existence\njust that. He emphasises that the socialisation process, because it is the\nsource of normativity, cannot itself be described in normative terms.201\nThe logic student is not guided by her own dispositions when learning\nto draw the correct inference, she is guided by her teacher. Indeed, only\nthrough such training does the student acquire the specific dispositions\nnecessary for carrying on alone in proper logical fashion. By becoming\nhabituated to a particular tradition of thinking, the student learns to act\ninstinctively in response to certain kinds of stimuli. She will feel repelled\nby actions violating the rules to which she has become habituated,\nand attracted by actions which accord with them. She will feel herself\ncompelled to act in accordance with those rules, and will have thus now\nalso acquired the competence to socialise others into her tradition by\ntransmitting to them the practical and theoretical lore she has made her\nown.202\nSo much agrees with, and also serves to extend, Heidegger\u2019s account.\nHowever, Bloor\u2019s sociological explanation of logical compulsion\nalso includes a move which appears to conflict with Heidegger\u2019s\naccount. Bloor argues that we need to explain how \u2018non-intentional,\nnon-normative responses\u2019 can give rise to the regularised pattern of\nan informal self-referring practice.203 The conflict arises because, for\nHeidegger, there can be no non-intentional responses. At the root of\nthe conflict lie differing conceptions of intentionality. Bloor seems to\nunderstand intentionality as being inextricably tied up with semantic\ncontent. Hence, because \u2018we always encounter the dependence of\nsemantic content on a more basic, non-semantic level,\u2019 Bloor concludes\nthat the more basic non-semantic level must be free from \u2018intentional\nelements.\u2019204 We must, he cautions, resist the temptation to assume that\nour automatic responses are already endowed with \u2018propositional and\nlogical content.\u2019205 Bloor thus seems to view intentionality as propositional\ncontent belonging to a substance-subject. To be sure, Bloor has noted\nthat groups, rather than individuals, may be the bearers of intentions.\n201 David Bloor (2004b), \u2018Institutions and Rule-Scepticism: A Reply to Martin Kusch,\u2019\nSocial Studies of Science 34(4), 593\u2013601 (p. 595).\n202 The emotional dynamics which help keep epistemic groups together will receive\nslightly more systematic attention in Chapter Seven.\n203 Bloor (1997b), Wittgenstein, Rules and Institutions, p. 135.\n204 Bloor (2004b), \u2018Institutions and Rule-Scepticism,\u2019 p. 597.\n205 Bloor (2004b), \u2018Institutions and Rule-Scepticism,\u2019 p. 598. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 219\nHe has written that \u2018[o]n the institutional theory intentionality, plural\nand singular, is not in the head.\u2019206 Combined with the conviction that\nintentions must include propositional content, this would seem to push\nBloor into viewing the group likewise as a substance-subject bearing\npropositional content, content which is not \u2018in the head\u2019 but, strange as\nit may seem, somewhere else. All the difficulties faced at the individual\nlevel thus threaten to reappear at the group level. Bloor is, of course, not\ninsensitive to these difficulties, and thus he attempts to resolve them by\nfurthermore arguing that intentions must be explained reductively in\nnon-intentional terms.\nHeidegger, in contrast, viewed intentionality in terms of our\nexistential relation to things and persons in the world. Because one basis\nof human existence is being-in-the-world, we necessarily find ourselves\nalways already among the other entities also inhabiting the world. As\nnoted earlier, Heidegger viewed intentionality as the \u2018directedness\u2019 of\nour relation to these other entities. It is thus not a propositional content\nbelonging to a substance-subject, whether individual or group, but a\ndirectional relation belonging to our existence as being-in-the-world.\nOn this view, a basic feature of our existence is that \u2018there is always an\nentity and an interconnection with an entity already somehow unveiled,\nwithout its being expressly made into an object.\u2019207 The key points here\nare that, for Heidegger, our being in the world entails intentionality, and\nintentionality need not have an object. This departs from more standard\ntheories of intentionality, but we have already discussed the conceptual\nbackground which drives this move. In Heidegger\u2019s view, perceiving a\nthing as an object is a derivative, theoretical way of understanding the\nwhatness of that thing. A more fundamental mode of understanding\nis one in which the thing is encountered non-thematically as a piece\nof equipment taken up in the course of a practical task performed in a\nwork-world. In this latter case, we are directed towards the equipment,\nbecause we use it, but the intentionality of the relation includes no\npropositional content. Only when the intentional relation also takes on\nthe character of a thematising do we then come to perceive that thing as\nan object, that is, as a property-bearing substance. This is not a transition\n206 David Bloor (1996), \u2018Idealism and the Sociology of Knowledge,\u2019 Social Studies of\nScience 26(4), 839\u201356 (p. 850).\n207 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 157; translation modified. 220 Science as Social Existence\nfrom a non-intentional to an intentional state, but from one mode of\nintentionality to another.\nIt is difficult to see that Bloor would lose anything crucial by adopting\nHeidegger\u2019s account of intentionality.208 On the other hand, the benefits\nare clear. Bloor writes: \u2018I certainly want to see the links between the\nintentional level and its non-intentional basis made stronger.\u2019209 An\nexplanation of this link may be strengthened in two ways. First, Bloor\ncould shift his definition of intentionality in the way just mentioned.\nSecond, he could adopt Heidegger\u2019s phenomenological analysis of the\nchange-over in the way we experience and understand things. This is a\nchange-over in intentionality. Recall that the transformation is from the\nway things are practically experienced during immersed involvement in\na work-world to the way things are theoretically experienced as objects,\nand as the subject matter for propositional statements. A detailed\naccount of the change-over was given in Chapter Two. As a rough recap,\nHeidegger analyses the change-over in terms of four stages. First, after\nan interruption in our immersed involvement with things, we step back\nand just look at them. This pure looking then becomes a thematising\nin which things now become experienced as the distinct objects of a\ndisengaged form of perception. Third, we then begin to deliberate over\nthese distinct objects so as to determine their properties. Finally, these\ndeterminate objects then become the subject matter for propositional\nassertions, that is, for the statements of theory and logic.\nThis stepwise description provides a more nuanced analytical tool\nthan does Bloor\u2019s bipartite distinction between informal and formal\nknowledge. It thus allows us to better understand how non-deliberative,\nnon-propositional thinking shifts into deliberative, propositionally\nstructured thinking. This shift can take place quickly and on an individual\nlevel, as was discussed in Chapter Two. However, as the present chapter\nhas argued, a shift on the individual level is itself enabled by a collective\nhistory of the way the relation between things and thinking has come\n208 Bloor might worry that Heidegger\u2019s account of intentionality threatens his own\ncommitment to causal explanation. But Barnes has nicely demonstrated how the\nsociologist can incorporate intentional phenomena into a counterfactual account\nof causation (Barnes (1974), Scientific Knowledge and Sociological Theory, pp. 71\u201378).\nOf course, such accounts are far from uncontroversial, but I make no claim that the\nproposed negotiation will be easy to achieve in pragmatic terms.\n209 Bloor (2004b), \u2018Institutions and Rule-Scepticism,\u2019 p. 600. 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 221\nto be thematised, and so theoretically understood, over the course of\ncenturies. The way an individual makes sense of her relation to things\ncan be explained by reference to the tradition which structures the way\nshe thinks about those things, and, more concretely, to the processes by\nwhich she becomes socialised into that tradition. The explanation thus\nhas both historical and social components.\nBloor argues that explaining the links between intentional\nphenomena and their non-intentional base is a difficult and complex\ntask, and he compares it with attempts to explain the links between the\nphenomenal qualities of water and their molecular base in hydrogen\nand oxygen.210 His point is that chemists are not normally criticised\nfor attempting such an explanation. He thus suggests that sociologists,\nin turn, \u2018may reasonably ask that what is granted to the chemists be\ngranted to them as well.\u2019211\nMaintaining the analogy to chemistry, it will be useful to compare\nBloor\u2019s hypothesis to the hypothesis of Gay-Lussac, discussed earlier\nin this section. On the basis of experimental findings, Gay-Lussac\nproposed that every fixed volume of gas included the same number of\natoms. As we saw, this hypothesis directly contradicted the established\ndoctrine of the indivisibility of the atom. Was Gay-Lussac\u2019s hypothesis\nthus rejected in order to protect this doctrine? No. As Bloor argued, a\nnegotiation occurred which swapped a logic of addition for a logic of\nsubstitution.\nMove now to Bloor\u2019s hypothesis that intentional phenomena\nmay be explained in terms of non-intentional phenomena, the latter\nof which may also include \u2018ordinary human interactions.\u2019212 This\nhypothesis directly contradicts, and so threatens, the doctrine that\nhuman action must include an irreducibly intentional element. Should\nthis doctrine be rejected in order to preserve Bloor\u2019s hypothesis? Bloor\nevidently thinks so. But Heidegger\u2019s account of intentionality allows\nfor a simple negotiation which would preserve both this doctrine and\nBloor\u2019s hypothesis. Consider that Bloor\u2019s hypothesis employs a logic of\naddition. Non-intentional phenomena combine to produce intentional\nphenomena much as hydrogen and oxygen combine to produce water.\n210 Bloor (2004b), \u2018Institutions and Rule-Scepticism,\u2019 p. 600.\n211 Bloor (2004b), \u2018Institutions and Rule-Scepticism,\u2019 p. 600 n. 3.\n212 Bloor (1997b), Wittgenstein, Rules and Institutions, p. 133. 222 Science as Social Existence\nOne assumption of this logic is the identification of intentionality with\npropositional content. As just argued, we can replace this assumption\nwith Heidegger\u2019s claim that intentionality may either include or not\ninclude propositional content. By doing so, we trade Bloor\u2019s logic of\naddition for a logic of substitution \u2014 whereby one mode of intentionality\nis substituted for another \u2014 thus preserving both his hypothesis as well\nas the doctrine that human actions are irreducibly intentional.213 The key\nmove in this negotiation is the redefinition of intentionality from being\na property of a mental substance to its being a structure of existence.\nSeen against the backdrop of the history sketched out in this chapter,\nthis frees the concept of intentionality from the glass-bulb model of\nan internally organised mental substance, where it had been shielded\nfrom philosophical scrutiny by Descartes in the seventeenth century.\nIntentional acts are not necessarily mental acts, sealed up in a purified\npropositional space, and trying desperately to somehow break out and\nconnect with the elusive things of an external world. They are existential\nacts which necessarily take place in a world shared with other persons\nand populated by all manner of things ceaselessly stimulating us into\never recurrent and reconfigurable patterns of thought.\n11. Conclusion\nThe cumulative effect of this and the preceding chapters should have\nbeen to convince readers of the benefits of comparing and combining\nthe tools and insights of SSK with those of Heidegger\u2019s existential\nphenomenology. As we have seen, there are many striking similarities\nbetween Heidegger\u2019s earlier concerns and the more recent concerns\nof SSK practitioners, as well as many ways in which their respective\nmethods may be fruitfully combined. We have now explored a few of\nthese. Absent from our considerations thus far, however, has been an\nexplicit focus on issues relevant to the history of the natural sciences.\n213 The proposed negotiation is consistent with Martin Kusch\u2019s observation that \u2018Bloor\nonly succeeds in reducing one intentional phenomenon to another\u2019 (Martin Kusch\n(2004a), \u2018Reply to My Critics,\u2019 Social Studies of Science 34(4), 615\u201320 (p. 618)). However,\nKusch appears to also identify intentionality exclusively with propositional content:\n\u2018an intentional fact involves concepts like beliefs and desire\u2019 (Martin Kusch (2004b),\n\u2018Rule-Scepticism and the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge: The Bloor-Lynch\nDebate Revisited,\u2019 Social Studies of Science 34(4), 571\u201391 (pp. 579\u201380)). 4. Things, Thinking, and the Social Foundations of Logic 223\nThis wrinkle will be smoothed out in Chapters Five and Six. As will have\nalready become clear in the present chapter, Heidegger was himself\ndeeply engaged in historical research. The phenomenological history\nof logical thinking presented in this chapter represents just one thread\nrunning through the tapestry of Heidegger\u2019s life-long engagement with\nthe history of philosophy. Furthermore, as is evident from the preceding\ndiscussion, this engagement was no mere antiquarian interest in the\npast, but was instead driven by Heidegger\u2019s desire to resolve perceived\nconfusions in the present by excavating and developing the unrealised\npossibilities of the past. His longing after a new method by which to\nbuild a more stable foundation for the sciences, bounded as it was by\na commitment to the irremediable finitude of human being, pushed\nHeidegger into ever deeper historical reflection. For him, the reservoir\nfrom which to draw insight lay not in a timeless and immaterial realm\nof distinct ideas or formalised propositional structures, but rather in the\nuntapped possibilities latent in his own rich and variegated historical\ntradition.214\nA key moment in Heidegger\u2019s phenomenological history of logic\nwas the early-modern mathematical interpretation of Aristotle\u2019s\nconstrual of thinking in terms of the proposition. Heidegger broadly\nlocated this moment in the early seventeenth century, taking Descartes\nas his exemplar. In his view, the mathematicisation of the science of\nthinking, that is, of logic, coincided with the emergence of modern\nnatural science. Indeed, as mentioned earlier, Heidegger discussed\nDescartes\u2019s innovations together with the equally decisive work of\nGalileo and Newton. Heidegger\u2019s remarks about Galileo and Newton\nwill be considered in Chapter Six. In that chapter, as well as the one\nimmediately ahead of us, we will pick up the second part of Heidegger\u2019s\ntwo-part description of the existential foundations of modern science,\na part left largely unaddressed in this chapter. Recall that Heidegger\ndistinguished modern science from its predecessors by pointing to\nwhat \u2018rules and determines\u2019 the basic activities of the former in contrast\nto the latter. The first part of this determination was the distinctive\n214 As Reinhard May has demonstrated, Heidegger\u2019s European tradition also included\na long-standing, transcultural engagement with East Asian thought (Reinhard\nMay (1996), Heidegger\u2019s Hidden Sources: East Asian Influence on His Work, trans. by\nGraham Parkes (London: Routledge)). 224 Science as Social Existence\nway in which early-modern scientists came to experience their work\nwith things. The second part was what Heidegger described as early-\nmodern scientists\u2019 metaphysical projection of the thingness of things.\nThis description concerned the ways in which scientists\u2019 productive\ncomportment towards things served to determine, a priori, the whatness\nof those things. As we will see, these two parts feed into one another: the\nway a scientist experiences her work with things is shaped by her a priori\nprojection of the thingness of those things, and her a priori projection of\nthe thingness of things is likewise influenced by her past experience of\nworking with those things. This interplay is possible because, as was\nargued in this chapter, the a priori does not derive its authority from a\nrarefied realm lying outside the everyday work-world, but is instead\nfirmly rooted in the tradition which both enables and is sustained by\nthat work-world.\nIn this chapter, the focus has been on the second part of Heidegger\u2019s\ntwo-part description of the foundations of modern science. Indeed, this\nis where Heidegger placed almost all of his own attention. He thus\nnever managed to give a full account of the interplay which he himself\nhad identified and placed at the centre of his phenomenological account\nof science. Missing in Heidegger\u2019s work is a more thoroughgoing\nexploration of the way in which the everyday work-world becomes\nthoroughly implicated in the metaphysical deliberations of scientists.\nThis is another place where the empirical work definitive of SSK can\nhelp to fill out and strengthen Heidegger\u2019s abstract reflections with\ndetailed historical studies of concrete scientific work. We will see, in\nturn, that attention to Heidegger\u2019s broader theoretical reflections can\nhelp protect historians of science from the methodologically induced\nparochialism which may threaten any specialised intellectual practice\noccupying itself so much with the trees that it comes to neglect certain\nimportant features of the forest. Chapter Five\nMath\u0113sis and the Emergence\nof Early-Modern Science\n1. Introduction\nPlace a grain of wheat on the ground in front of you. Does this amount\nto a heap of grain? No, of course not. So, add a second grain. Is it a heap\nnow? No. A third grain? No. A fourth grain? No. A fifth grain? No. And\nso it goes also after a sixth grain, a seventh grain, an eight grain, and a\nninth grain. When a tenth grain is added, we still do not have a heap.\nBut we do have a pattern. The pattern is this: if some grains do not\nmake a heap, then adding one more grain will not turn them into a heap.\nOn the basis of this pattern, we can now make more specific predictions.\nWe can predict that adding an eleventh grain will not make a heap, nor\nwill adding a twelfth grain, a thirteenth grain, or a fourteenth grain. The\npattern, then, has the character of a general prediction: when you add\none grain to a non-heap, the result will be a non-heap. A single grain\ncannot determine the difference between a non-heap and a heap.\nThe second-century Greek physician, Galen of Pergamon, exploited\nthe predictive power of this pattern when he wrote:\nI know of nothing worse and more absurd than that the being and not-\nbeing of a heap is determined by a grain of corn. And to prevent this\nabsurdity from adhering to you, you will not cease from denying, and\n\u00a9 Jeff Kochan, CC BY 4.0 http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0129.05 226 Science as Social Existence\nwill never admit at any time that the sum of this is a heap, even if the\nnumber of grains of wheat reaches infinity by the constant and gradual\naddition of more. And by reason of this denial the heap is proved to be\nnon-existent, because of this pretty sophism. And so it follows from this\nsophism that the mountain also does not exist.1\nThe \u2018you\u2019 to whom Galen addressed his comment was the \u2018dogmatic\u2019\nphysician. Galen argues that the dogmatist cannot reject the implication\nof the pattern without appearing silly. However, the dogmatist will\nthen be forced to reject the existence of heaps, which is also silly. The\ndogmatist is thus faced with a paradox for which no solution is obvious.\nThis is a case of turnabout being fair play, because the dogmatist had\nalready laid out the same kind of argument against Galen and other\nempirical physicians. In the above passage, Galen is demonstrating\nthat the paradox cuts both ways, causing potential problems for the\ndogmatist as well.\nGalen tells us that the dogmatist has challenged the empiricist\nphysician\u2019s claim that a belief will be credible if it is supported by\nevidence which has been seen \u2018very many times.\u2019 To this, the dogmatist\nasks: How many times? Ten? The empiricist says no, ten times is not\nenough. The dogmatist then asks: Eleven times? No, says the empiricist,\neleven times is also not enough. The pattern has now appeared, and the\ndogmatist leads the empiricist into the paradox. If the empiricist insists\non the method of \u2018seeing very many times,\u2019 she will be forced to admit\nthe impossibility of empirical knowledge.\nFor if something that was seen forty-nine times and yet in all these times\nwas not accepted nor considered to be true, now by the addition of this\none single time comes to be considered acceptable and true, it is obvious\nthat only by being seen a single time has it become acceptable and true.\nThe inevitable conclusion is that seeing a thing once \u2014 although at the\noutset this was not accepted and considered true \u2014 has on this occasion\nsuch force that when added to something which was not acceptable and\nnot considered true as to make it acceptable, and vice versa.2\nThe dogmatist argues that one observation is enough to produce\nknowledge. The \u2018force\u2019 of this single observation derives from the\n1 Galen of Pergamon (1944), On Medical Experience, 1st edn of the Arabic version, with\nEnglish trans. by Richard Walzer (Oxford: Oxford University Press), p. 116.\n2 Galen (1944), On Medical Experience, p. 97. 5. Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 227\nphysician\u2019s \u2018know[ing] from the very beginning what things have to\nbe eliminated and disregarded as being superfluous and unnecessary,\nand what things have to be examined and to be judged carefully as\nto their usefulness and their necessity.\u20193 What the dogmatic physician\nis insisting on here is the need for an a priori standard by which\nto differentiate between epistemically desirable and epistemically\nundesirable phenomena. Moreover, the force of this standard in\nuse will be immediate, manifesting itself on the basis of a single act\nof observation. At best, the empiricist\u2019s little-by-little method fails to\nreflect the immediacy and constructivity of reason. Today, this kind of\ndogmatism is more commonly called \u2018rationalism.\u2019\nThe paradoxes generated by this pattern of argument pose a threat\nto empiricists and rationalists alike. More generally, they threaten\nconfidence in both inductive and deductive forms of inferential\nreasoning. Scepticism about induction is well known, and has often been\ndiscussed in terms of the underdetermination of theory by data, a topic\nwhich we earlier addressed in Chapter Three. No matter how many\ntimes the empiricist observes the phenomena, no knowledge will arise\nwithout the mediation of some additional, unobserved element. For the\nrationalist, this additional element is the a priori. For the sociologist of\nknowledge, it is grounded in social convention. As we saw in Chapter\nFour, Heidegger grounds the a priori in a historical tradition, a stance\nwhich is compatible with that of SSK. By posing the socio-historical\ncontingency of the a priori, the latter two positions reject the absolutism\nof the rationalist. For them, scientific knowledge is objective, but not\nabsolutely so.4\n3 Galen (1944), On Medical Experience, p. 93.\n4 David Bloor uses the paradox of the heap to challenge a rationalistic belief in\nthe absolute (i.e., exceptionless) validity of deduction (David Bloor (1991 [1976]),\nKnowledge and Social Imagery, 2nd edn (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), pp.\n182\u201383). The paradox seems to offer an exception, because the repeated application\nof deduction to apparently true premises (\u2018adding one grain to a non-heap results\nin a non-heap\u2019 and \u2018one grain is added to this non-heap\u2019) seems to result in a false\nconclusion (\u2018this is a non-heap\u2019). Defensive reactions to the paradox can make\nexplicit the social labour required to maintain belief in the absolute validity of\ndeduction. An example can be found in a paper by Colin Howson, wherein he\nseeks to suppress the paradox as I present it in my own work (Colin Howson (2009),\n\u2018Sorites Is No Threat to Modus Ponens: A Reply to Kochan,\u2019 International Studies in\nthe Philosophy of Science 23(2), 209\u201312; Jeff Kochan (2008), \u2018Realism, Reliabilism, and\nthe \u201cStrong Programme\u201d in the Sociology of Scientific Knowledge,\u2019 International 228 Science as Social Existence\nGalen\u2019s second-century response to the dogmatic physician is similar\nto these responses. He rebuffs the dogmatist\u2019s charge that the empiricist\ncannot produce \u2018technical\u2019 \u2014 that is, objective \u2014 knowledge: \u2018you\nwould be acting both unjustly and wrongly in pestering us to specify,\nof a thing which when seen once only is not \u201ctechnical\u201d according to\nyour argument, how many times it must be seen in order to become\n\u201ctechnical.\u201d\u20195 The injustice lies in ridiculing the empiricist \u2018because we\ncannot state with exactitude the precise number [\u2026], but are only able\nto give a general notion.\u20196 Based on this argument, the dogmatist will\ninsist that a definition of \u2018heap,\u2019 in order to be objective, must be precise\nrather than general; it must exactly specify how many grains make a\nheap. Yet, as Galen has already shown, the dogmatist cannot do this\nwithout appearing silly. Indeed, by specifying the precise number of\ngrains with which a non-heap becomes a heap, the dogmatist reveals\nhis purportedly \u2018technical\u2019 knowledge of heaps is, in fact, lamentably\nsubjective.\nGalen then expands this critique to encompass the dogmatist\u2019s\nmedical knowledge in general. He points out that the dogmatist\u2019s a priori\nstandard \u2018is not uniform, universal, comprising all of you, because you\nhave different views and each one of you holds an opinion completely\ncontradictory to the opinion of the others.\u20197 The implication is that\nobjective knowledge is marked, to some substantial degree, by social\nagreement. The paradox of the heap relies on this idea, since, because\nmost people agree that heaps exist, the dogmatist will appear silly if he\nclaims that they do not.\nIf you wish, speak, it will not cause me to be angry with you; if, however,\nyou should say of something which people continually see under the\nsame conditions throughout their lives, that it is non-existent, it will not\nhelp you at all. [\u2026] I for my part adhere to and follow that which is\nknown to men, and accept what is obvious without inquiring into the\ncause of each individual thing. Therefore I say of what has been seen\nStudies in the Philosophy of Science 22(1), 21\u201338). I respond to Howson in Jeff Kochan\n(2009a), \u2018The Exception Makes the Rule: Reply to Howson,\u2019 International Studies in\nthe Philosophy of Science 23(2), 213\u201316.\n5 Galen (1944), On Medical Experience, p. 118.\n6 Galen (1944), On Medical Experience, p. 119.\n7 Galen (1944), On Medical Experience, p. 104. 5. Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 229\nbut once, that it is not \u2018technical,\u2019 just as a single grain of wheat is not a\nperfect heap; if, however, it is a thing that is seen many times in the same\nway, then I call it \u2018technical.\u20198\nFor Galen, objective knowledge has a social aspect \u2014 it is \u2018that which\nis known to men\u2019 \u2014 and a historical aspect \u2014 it is based on that which\nis \u2018seen many times in the same way.\u2019 However, he also notes that\nsuch knowledge is \u2018obvious without inquiring into the cause of each\nindividual thing.\u2019 When it comes to heaps, this may be true. But what\nabout disease? At least in the case of unfamiliar diseases, it would seem\nthat close attention to causes may help in the development of an effective\ntreatment. This was a point made by Galen\u2019s dogmatic opponent.\nBut just because the number of concomitants of diseases is so great and\nthere is such variety in what causes evacuation and what is vomited up\nand what is introduced into the organism, while those things that affect\nit from the outside are still more numerous, the Empiricist is still less\nable to judge which of them are beneficial and which harmful.9\nHere the dogmatist reinforces the claim that the physician requires a\nstandard by which to reliably distinguish between causes which are,\nand those which are not, necessary for the understanding and effective\ntreatment of disease. Galen accepts the need for such a standard, but\ndismisses the idea that it be subjected to systematic enquiry.\n[I]t has been found that what has been seen many times becomes\n\u2018technical.\u2019 With regard to the cause, however, which makes it completely\n\u2018technical\u2019 and when it begins to be completely \u2018technical,\u2019 I am of opinion\nthat it is idle to demand this. For I find that not a particle of harm befalls\narts and men in their modes of life and activities for being ignorant of\nsuch things.10\nObjective medical knowledge is produced through serial, disciplined\nobservation, but the question of what norms guide those observations is\nof little interest to Galen. For him, it is enough to know those norms in\na vague and general way, much as we do the norms used to distinguish\n8 Galen (1944), On Medical Experience, p. 119.\n9 Galen (1944), On Medical Experience, p. 93.\n10 Galen (1944), On Medical Experience, p. 121. 230 Science as Social Existence\nbetween a heap and a non-heap. There is, he thinks, no great need\nto specify them in a systematic or precise way. In Heidegger\u2019s term,\nGalen has no interest in thematising the norms which guide successful\nmedical thinking. In SSK\u2019s terms, he is happy to rely on those norms\nas a resource, but resists turning them into a topic. Galen\u2019s attitude\nmay thus strike one as distinctly unscientific. Moreover, it seems to be\nan attitude hostile to epistemology, in general, and, insofar as Galen\nattributes a social aspect to medical knowledge, to SSK, in particular.\nIn fact, as we will see in this chapter, later physicians became\nincreasingly interested in understanding the methods by which reliable\nmedical knowledge is produced. More than a millennium after Galen,\nRenaissance empirical physicians began to topicalise and systematically\ninvestigate the informal logic which they thought must underpin their\ntechniques of medical discovery. As historians have long recognised,\nthese physicians were innovators in the rationalisation of scientific\nmethod, and hence key contributors to the rise of early-modern\nempirical science.\nThe Renaissance empiricists examined in this chapter accepted the\ndogmatist\u2019s view that physicians must know something in advance,\nfrom the very beginning, in order to successfully diagnose and treat\ndisease. Moreover, they agreed with the dogmatists that this a priori\nknowledge was a knowledge of causes. However, they resisted the\ndogmatist\u2019s claim that, on the basis of this knowledge, only one\nobservation is needed to properly diagnose a disease. Indeed, the\nempiricists continued to defend their doctrine of serial observation, of\nmedical knowledge gained little by little through a practice of \u2018seeing\nmany times in the same way.\u2019\nThe epistemology of these empirical physicians thus appears to have\nbeen circular: they claimed both that they already possessed knowledge\nof health and disease at the very beginning of their enquiry, and that\ntheir knowledge of health and disease was the consequence of their\nmethod of serial observation. They argued, however, that this epistemic\ncircle was not a vicious one. Like Galen over one thousand years earlier,\nthese Renaissance physicians argued that their a priori knowledge was\nof only a general, imprecise sort. Their empirical method, then, was\nmeant to transform this general and imprecise knowledge into specific 5. Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 231\nand precise knowledge. Hence, their account of knowledge was not\nviciously circular, because it involved two different sorts of knowledge,\none linked to the other by an empirical method of investigation.\nAs already noted, this method of investigation bears striking\nsimilarities to what Heidegger called a thematising articulation, a\ntopic to which we gave detailed attention in Chapter Four. One key\naspect of this process of articulation is the transformation of informal,\noften tacitly held knowledge into explicit, formalised knowledge.\nThe efforts of Renaissance physicians to understand this process, as\na central feature of their own medical practice, provides further\nhistorical support for Heidegger\u2019s existential conception of science.\nMoreover, this historical case also allows us to more fully explore one\nparticular facet of Heidegger\u2019s existential conception, namely, the\nmathematicisation of natural knowledge. With this, we expand on a\ntopic first addressed in Chapter Two under the label of \u2018the mathematical\nprojection of nature.\u2019 The role of mathematics in the emergence of early-\nmodern science has been a key point of debate among contemporary\nhistorians of science, a debate which, in many ways, reiterates the\nlong-standing feud between empiricists and rationalists alluded to\nabove. Heidegger\u2019s concept of math\u0113sis, or \u2018the mathematical,\u2019 as\nwell as its relation to what is commonly referred to as the \u2018Scientific\nRevolution,\u2019 adds a further perspective to this debate, one which seeks\nto combine the best insights from both camps. In addition, as we will\nsee near the end of this chapter, Heidegger\u2019s account of modern science\nas math\u0113sis also challenges the historiographic commonplace that the\nScientific Revolution coincided with the expungement of Aristotelian\n\u2018final causes\u2019 from scientific practice in the seventeenth century. On\nHeidegger\u2019s account, final causes were not abandoned, but instead\nradically transformed \u2014 to wit, mathematicised. This claim will lay the\nground for a more detailed discussion in Chapter Six about the rise of\nseventeenth-century experimental philosophy. For now, let us start\nwith a review of Heidegger\u2019s account of math\u0113sis, and then move on to\nconsider the deliberations of empirically minded physicians during the\nthree centuries prior to the emergence of early-modern science. These\ntopics will lead us into the heart of key historiographic debates over the\nexistence and nature of the Scientific Revolution. 232 Science as Social Existence\n2. Modern Science as Math\u0113sis\nAs discussed in previous chapters, the thing has been typically defined\nas a property-bearing substance. Heidegger writes that this definition\nseems \u2018natural,\u2019 in the sense of \u2018what is understood without further ado\nand is \u201cself-evident\u201d in the realm of everyday understanding.\u201911 Yet he\nchallenges this construal of the \u2018natural\u2019 as being self-evident, and thus\nnot amenable to further analysis, arguing instead that \u2018[t]he \u201cnatural\u201d is\nalways historical.\u201912 The prevailing definition of the thing did not \u2018just\nfall absolutely from heaven, but would have itself been based on very\ndefinite presuppositions.\u201913 Indeed, as was argued in Chapter Four, one\nkey presupposition determining the prevailing definition of the thing\nwas the Aristotelian claim that the structure of the thing may be usefully\nmodelled on the structure of the proposition. According to Heidegger,\nthis proposition-based account of the thing has played a central role in\nthe development of the modern scientific understanding of the thing as\nan object of investigation.\nOne consequence of this definition is the treatment of a thing in\nabstraction from its concrete circumstances and other unique features.\nA definition of the thingness, or whatness, of the thing, as such, is a\ngeneralised definition which deliberately overlooks all the peculiarities\ndistinctive of any one particular thing. Thus Heidegger writes:\n[A] botanist, when he examines the labiate flower, will never be concerned\nabout the single flower as a single one: it always remains an exemplar\nonly. That is also true of the animals, for example, the countless frogs\nand salamanders which are killed in a laboratory. The \u2018this one\u2019 (je dieses)\nwhich distinguishes every thing, will be skipped over [\u00fcbersprungen]\nby science.14\nIn this section, we will consider in detail Heidegger\u2019s account of modern\nscience as a form of understanding which \u2018skips over\u2019 the individual\nspecificities of the things it investigates. Heidegger elaborates this\naccount by characterising modern science in terms of the ancient\n11 Martin Heidegger (1967 [1962]), What Is a Thing?, trans. by William B. Barton, Jr.,\nand Vera Deutsch (Chicago: Henry Regnery), p. 39.\n12 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 39.\n13 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 40.\n14 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 15; translation modified. 5. Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 233\nGreek concept of math\u0113sis, or what he also calls \u2018the mathematical\u2019\n(das Mathematische). These considerations, arising out of a 1935\u20131936\nlecture course, present a further development of his earlier account of\nthe mathematical projection of nature. What he had earlier treated as a\ncentral element of science, in general, now becomes a defining feature\nof modern science, in particular.\nFor Heidegger, math\u0113sis refers to that fundamental characteristic of\nmodern science which distinguishes it from both ancient and medieval\nscience. He addresses, and rejects in turn, attempts to distinguish\nmodern science on the grounds that it begins with facts about things\nrather than with speculative propositions and concepts, that it uses\nexperiments to get information about the behaviour of things, and that\nit relies on calculation and measurement in its investigations of things.\nOn all three counts, Heidegger argues, there is no substantive difference\nbetween ancient and medieval science, on the one hand, and modern\nscience, on the other. First, ancient and medieval science also observed\nthe facts, and modern scientists also rely on speculative propositions\nand concepts. Second, the use of experiments, in the broad sense of\ncontrolled tests to gain information about things, was already familiar\nin the ancient and medieval periods. Heidegger comments that \u2018[t]his\nkind of experience lies at the basis of all technological contact with\nthings in the crafts and the use of tools.\u201915 Third, ancient science also\nmade use of measurement and number.\nHeidegger argues that it is not reliance on facts, as such, which\nis decisive for modern science, but \u2018the way the facts are conceived.\u2019\nLikewise, it is not the experiment, as such, that matters, but \u2018the manner\nof setting up the test and the intent with which it is undertaken and in\nwhich it is grounded.\u2019 And so too with calculation and measurement:\n\u2018it is a question of how and in what sense calculating and measuring\nwere applied and carried out, and what importance they have for the\ndetermination of the objects themselves.\u201916 Hence, it is not that facts,\nexperiments, calculation and measurement are deployed, but how and\nto what end they are deployed, which distinguishes modern science.\nThis points us towards the historically specific existential conditions of\npossibility governing what \u2018essentially and decisively rules the basic\n15 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 67.\n16 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, pp. 66\u201368. 234 Science as Social Existence\nmovement\u2019 of modern science.17 It points us, in other words, towards the\nphenomenon of math\u0113sis. Heidegger suggests that math\u0113sis is something\nwhich governs modern science at a basic level. It thus includes a strongly\nnormative component.\nHeidegger defines math\u0113sis as \u2018the teaching\u2019 (die Lehre), in the sense of\n\u2018the doctrine\u2019 or \u2018the apprenticeship,\u2019 which in turn has a double sense:\n\u2018teaching\u2019 as entering into an apprenticeship (in die Lehre gehen) and then\nlearning or studying; and \u2018teaching\u2019 as what is taught. Heidegger means\nhere teaching and learning \u2018in a broad and at the same time essential\nsense, not in the more recent, narrow, hackneyed sense of \u201cschools\u201d\nand \u201cscholars.\u201d\u201918 He furthermore distinguishes two fundamental\nfeatures of modern science as math\u0113sis: (1) \u2018work experiences,\u2019 or \u2018the\ndirection and way of controlling and using [or manipulating] what is\u2019;\nand (2) \u2018metaphysics,\u2019 or \u2018the projection of the fundamental knowledge\nof being, upon which what is establishes itself as knowable.\u201919 These\ntwo fundamental features are \u2018reciprocally related,\u2019 and always occur\ntogether in the activities of scientifically engaged human beings.20\nWe have already encountered this twofold structure in Chapter Four,\nwhere our attention was primarily on the metaphysical projection of\nthe thingness of things, as a constructive aspect of thinking, rather than\non scientists\u2019 work experiences in respect of those things. Nevertheless,\nalready there we encountered the historical interplay between things,\nexperienced as property-bearing substances, and thinking, construed\nas propositionally structured rule-following. In this chapter, and in\nChapter Six, we will treat the experience of things more directly as\nwork experience, that is, as experiences which arise from the direct\nengagement with and manipulation of material things. Our focus in\n17 \u2018[\u2026] was die Grundbewegung der Wissenschaft [\u2026] gleichurspr\u00fcnglich ma\u00dfgebend\ndurchherrscht\u2019 (Martin Heidegger (1984b [1962]), Die Frage nach dem Ding: zu Kants\nLehre von den transzendentalen Grunds\u00e4tzen (Gesamtausgabe, vol. 41) (Frankfurt:\nVittorio Klostermann), p. 68).

Thus, Heidegger\u2019s usage of math\u0113sis differs from that of Michel Foucault,\nwho defines it as \u2018the science of calculable order\u2019 (Michel Foucault (1970), The Order\nof Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences (New York: Pantheon Books), p. 73). 5. Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 235\nthis chapter and the next will, in other words, be directed more towards\nthe existential conditions enabling physical experimentation in modern\nscience. As we will see, the experimental manipulation of things\nis, indeed, reciprocally related to the metaphysical projection of the\nthingness of things. The experimental set-up is a material instantiation\nof, as well as the material basis for, the metaphysical projection. Hence,\nHeidegger\u2019s account of modern science in term of math\u0113sis recognises a\ncentral place for the material practices of experimental science without\nrejecting a role for metaphysics. His account can thus be assimilated to\nneither of the conventional empiricist and rationalist interpretations of\nthe Scientific Revolution. It must be immediately emphasised, however,\nthat Heidegger did not develop this strand of his existential conception\nof science in any great detail. Additional material from the history\nof science will allow us to develop and refine Heidegger\u2019s account\nof modern science in a way which he did not, and which is, I think,\nconsistent with his intentions.\nAccording to Heidegger, the word math\u0113sis stems from the Greek\nword math\u0113mata, the name for a specific kind of thing. These are things\ninsofar as they are learnable, or amenable to study.21 However, as he\nalso points out, we do not, strictly speaking, learn a thing. We learn\ninstead how to relate to a thing, for example, how to observe it, how to\nuse it, or how to produce it. Hence, when we learn a thing, we are really\nlearning something about our relation to it. Heidegger illustrates this\npoint with the example of a rifle. We do not learn a rifle, he writes, but\nits usage. The acquisition of the usage happens through the usage itself,\nthat is, through \u2018exercise\u2019 or \u2018practice\u2019 (\u00dcbung).22 In our practice with\nthe rifle, we learn to load it, to control its trigger, and to aim it.\nHowever, Heidegger argues that \u2018practising\u2019 (\u00dcben) is only one kind\nof learning. There is another, more fundamental, kind of learning which\nactually makes it possible for us to learn through practice. This more\nbasic learning allows us to perceive what a weapon is, what a use-item\nis, and, most generally, what a thing is. Heidegger argues that we do\nnot learn the \u2018what\u2019 of a weapon only once we have learned the \u2018how\u2019\n21 Heidegger (1984b), Die Frage nach dem Ding, p. 71; cf. Heidegger (1967), What Is a\nThing?, p. 71.\n22 Heidegger (1984b), Die Frage nach dem Ding, p. 71; cf. Heidegger (1967), What Is a\nThing?, p. 71. 236 Science as Social Existence\nof its usage. On the contrary, \u2018[w]e already know [what a weapon is]\nbeforehand, and must know it; otherwise we could not even recognise\nthe rifle as such,\u2019 we could not, that is, tell the difference between a rifle\nand a non-rifle.23\nYet, although we must first know what a rifle is if we want to learn\nits usage, this prior knowledge is something we need only have in a\n\u2018general\u2019 and \u2018indefinite\u2019 way. In other words, when it comes to learning\nthe usage of a thing, prior knowledge of the whatness of the thing is\ncertainly necessary, but we need only possess it in a tacit way, as a kind\nof general and indeterminate background knowledge. When, in contrast,\nit comes to learning in the sense of math\u0113sis, we must deliberately \u2018take\nnote\u2019 of (zur Kenntnis nehmen) what the thing is, doing so \u2018specifically\nand in a determinate way.\u2019 Such deliberate \u2018taking note\u2019 is the very\nground of learning as math\u0113sis.24 This is a kind of learning in which \u2014 by\ntaking note of what we already know \u2014 we begin to transform our\npre-existing knowledge of what a thing is from a general and indefinite\nstate into a specific and determinate state. Such is the case, Heidegger\nclaims, when a specific rifle model is brought into existence: \u2018[w]hen it\nbecomes essential, in a general sense, to make available a thing like the\none whose usage we are practising, that is, when it becomes necessary\nto produce it.\u2019 This requires \u2018a becoming-acquainted [Kennenlernen]\nwith what fundamentally belongs to a firearm and with what a weapon\nis.\u2019 Compared to the knowledge gained of a rifle\u2019s usage, this is \u2018a more\nbasic acquaintance, one which must be learned beforehand, so that such\na rifle type and its corresponding tokens may come to exist at all.\u201925\nSo what is it about the rifle which both the sharpshooter and the\ngunsmith must know in advance, but of which only the gunsmith need\ntake note in order to fulfill her task? More generally, of what does one\nneed to take note in order to learn in the sense of math\u0113sis? The answer,\nHeidegger tells us, is that \u2018the producer must know beforehand what\n23 Heidegger (1984b), Die Frage nach dem Ding, p. 73; cf. Heidegger (1967), What Is a\nThing?, p. 72.\n24 Heidegger (1984b), Die Frage nach dem Ding, p. 73; cf.

Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 237\nBewandtnis fundamentally accompanies the thing.\u201926 The German word\nBewandtnis is a tricky one to translate. In this passage, Heidegger uses\nit without pausing to explain its meaning. However, if we turn to an\nearlier discussion, in \u00a718 of Being and Time, we can get a better sense of\nwhat the term means in the context of Heidegger\u2019s existential account of\nscience. Crucially, Heidegger treats the noun Bewandtnis together with\nthe closely related verb bewenden. Below is my translation of the key\npassage in Being and Time in which the term Bewandtnis first appears.27\nAs will be immediately evident, Heidegger is introducing the term in\nthe context of his discussion of readiness-to-hand, a concept we have\nalready encountered numerous times in previous chapters.\nThat the being of the ready-to-hand has the structure of a reference\nor assignment [Verweisung] \u2014 means: it has in itself the character of\ndirectedness [Verwiesenheit]. What-is is thereby discovered as that which\nis directed towards something. With what-is, at this something, there\nis an end [es hat\u2026 sein Bewenden]. The being-character of the ready-to-\nhand is end-directedness [Bewandtnis]. In end-directedness, there is a\nletting-be [bewenden lassen] with and at something. The relation of \u2018with\u2026\nat\u2026\u2019 [\u00bbmit\u2026 bei\u2026\u00ab] will be denoted by the term \u2018assignment.\u201928\nIn respect of Heidegger\u2019s phenomenological account of scientific practice,\nthe meaning of Bewandtnis is best understood as \u2018end-directedness.\u2019 I\ndo not recommend this translation for general application throughout\nHeidegger\u2019s work, but only as the best translation when it comes to\nhis reflections on science as math\u0113sis. This is a philosophical translation\nwith a particular, narrow aim.29\n26 \u2018[\u2026] welche Bewandtnis es \u00fcberhaupt mit dem Ding hat\u2019 (Heidegger (1984b), Die\nFrage nach dem Ding, p. 72); cf. Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 72.\n27 Ernst Tugendhat comments that there is probably no word in any other language\nwhich includes the same constellation of meanings as Bewandtnis. Thus, he\nconcludes, Heidegger\u2019s argument in \u00a718 of Being and Time must resist intelligible\ntranslation (Ernst Tugendhat (1967), Der Wahrheitsbegriff bei Husserl und Heidegger\n(Berlin: de Gruyter), p. 290 n. 6).

Martin Heidegger (1962a [1927]), Being and Time, trans. by John Macquarrie and\nEdward Robinson (Oxford: Blackwell), p. 115 [83\u201384].\n29 Other philosophical translations for Bewandtnis, as used by Heidegger, include:\n\u2018involvement\u2019 by John Macquarrie and Edward Robinson (in Heidegger (1962a),\nBeing and Time), and by Hubert Dreyfus (in Hubert L. Dreyfus (1991b), Being-in-\nthe-World: A Commentary on Heidegger\u2019s Being and Time, Division I (Cambridge, 238 Science as Social Existence\nBeing and Time provides the following concrete example for what\nHeidegger means by end-directedness, as well as the \u2018with\u2026 at\u2026\u2019\nrelation of assignment: \u2018with the ready-to-hand thing we call \u201chammer,\u201d\nthere is the end-directedness of being at work, hammering; with\nhammering, the end-directedness of being at fortifying; with fortifying,\nthe end-directedness of being at sheltering against bad weather.\u201930\nTransposed to our example of the rifle, we can say that with the rifle\nthere is the end-directedness of being at work, shooting; with shooting,\nthe end-directedness of being at impacting at a distance; and with\nimpacting at a distance, the end-directedness of being at subjugating\nothers. Put otherwise, the task at which the sharpshooter works with the\nrifle is shooting. With the rifle, at this task, there is an end: proximally,\nimpacting at a distance; more distally, subjugating others. The being of\nthe rifle, its readiness-to-hand, is a directedness towards this end, it is\nthat towards which the rifle is, essentially, directed. Heidegger writes that\nthe \u2018at-which\u2019 [Wobei] of an end-directedness is also a \u2018towards-which\u2019\n[Wozu], and that with this towards-which there can be yet another\nend-directedness.31 Hence, shooting is the end towards which the rifle\nis directed. With the towards-which of the rifle, proximally directed\ntowards shooting, there is a further, more distal, end: impacting at a\ndistance. The end-directedness of the rifle points towards shooting, and\nshooting, in turn, points towards impacting at a distance, and impacting\nat a distance points towards subjugating others.\nHowever, this iteration of assignment finally comes to an end\nin a \u2018primary\u2019 towards-which.

Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 239\n\u201ctowards-which\u201d is a \u201cfor-the-sake-of-which\u201d [Worum-willen].\u201932 For\nexample, in the case of the hammer, the iteration bottoms out in\n\u2018protection.\u2019 The hammer points towards hammering, which points\ntowards fortifying, which points towards sheltering, which points,\nfinally, towards protection. That for the sake of which one hammers,\nfortifies, shelters, is the subject\u2019s protection, which Heidegger describes\nas a \u2018possibility\u2019 of the subject\u2019s existence.33 Returning, once more, to\nour rifle example, we may take the primary towards-which of the\nrifle \u2014 that for the sake of which the rifle, ultimately, exists \u2014 to be\nsovereignty. With the rifle, one shoots, impacts, subjugates, for the sake\nof the subject\u2019s sovereignty, an ontological possibility of its existence.\nUltimately, at work, with the rifle, there is a directedness towards\nsovereignty as end. According to Heidegger, in order to work with\nthe rifle in a way which lets it be what it is, one must already have a\nknowledge of its end-directedness, and, hence, the final end towards\nwhich it points. This is an antecedent knowledge which the sharpshooter\nand the gunsmith both possess in a general and indefinite way, and of\nwhich only the latter need deliberately take note, developing it, through\nmath\u0113sis, into a more specific and determinate knowledge.\nNow consider the example of a plant collector. A plant collector\nis more like a sharpshooter. In order to pick a plant and put it in her\ncollection, she must already know what a plant is. If she did not know\nthis, then she would not even be able to identify a plant, to tell the\ndifference, for example, between a plant and a platypus. But this prior\nknowledge need only be of a general and indeterminate sort. On its\nbasis, the plant collector can take a particular plant for her collection,\nwithout deliberately taking note of that plant\u2019s general plantness, or\nwhatness. In contrast, the botanist will deliberately take note of the\ngeneral plantness of the plant. In the course of her work, she \u2018skips over\u2019\nthe individual specimens, taking them only as tokens of a general type.\nNevertheless, it is with these individual specimens, by being concretely\nat work with them, that the botanist learns \u2014 develops a specific and\ndeterminate knowledge of \u2014 the type. This learning is math\u0113sis, and,\naccording to Heidegger, it marks the difference between ancient and\nmedieval science, on the one hand, and modern science, on the other.\n32 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 116 [84].\n33 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 116 [84]. 240 Science as Social Existence\nIt should be emphasised that, in the examples of both the plant\ncollector and the botanist, the particular, concrete plant is being treated\nas something ready-to-hand in a work-world. In other words, we are\nconsidering it as it is experienced by the one who is at work with it.\nFrom this perspective, then, there is no basic ontological difference\nbetween the plant and the rifle. Both are things ready-to-hand within a\nwork-world. On Heidegger\u2019s account, then, in being at work with either\nthe particular plant or the particular rifle, there is an end-directedness.\nFurthermore, in both cases this end-directedness ultimately bottoms\nout in that for the sake of which the ready-to-hand thing is what it is.\nThis for-the-sake-of-which is an existential possibility of the subject.\nIn the case of the hammer, this existential possibility is the subject\u2019s\nprotection. In the case of the rifle, it is the subject\u2019s sovereignty. What\nabout the plant? Here the answer is less obvious. On first blush, there\ndoes not seem to be anything for the sake of which the plant is what it is.\nThis doubt is tied to our intuition that the plant is, in the first instance,\nnot something ready-to-hand, but something present-at-hand. Yet\nthis intuition was challenged in Chapters One and Two. According to\nHeidegger, a thing within the world is experienced, most immediately,\nas ready-to-hand. Only on this basis can it be subsequently experienced\nas present-at-hand within in the world. Hence, the what-being of a\nscientific thing should be understood fundamentally in terms of its\nreadiness-to-hand, which is to say, in terms of its end-directedness.\nFrom this it follows that the scientific thing \u2014 that which in scientific\nwork is let be what it is \u2014 is for the sake of an existential possibility\nof the subject. Heidegger argues that we already know this possibility,\nand must know it, when we intelligibly experience the scientific thing,\nas such, not to say when we start working with it. This possibility is\nthe ultimate end towards which the what-it-is of the scientific thing\nis directed. The hammerness of the hammer points, finally, towards\nprotection, and the rifleness of the rifle, finally, towards sovereignty. To\nwhat, then, does the plantness of the plant, finally, point?\nHeidegger does not answer this question. Instead, he concentrates on\nthe more general question of to what existential possibility the thingness\nof the scientific thing itself finally points. We will consider the specific\ncontent of Heidegger\u2019s answer to this question in Chapter Six. In the\nmeantime, in order to properly appreciate the grounds for that answer, 5. Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 241\nwe must first gain a firmer grip on the more formal characteristics of\nHeidegger\u2019s answer: namely, that the scientific thing \u2014 as something\nwith which scientists are at work \u2014 possesses an end-directedness\npointing towards a final end. We must know this end-directedness\nbeforehand if we are to successfully identify and work with the thing. In\nscientific work, we deliberately take note of this end-directedness, bring\nit into the foreground, and thereby seek to articulate our prior general\nand indeterminate knowledge of it into a more specific and determinate\nknowledge. This is how we study math\u0113mata, things insofar as they can\nbe learned. This is a process of math\u0113sis, whereby we learn what we\nalready know.\nFormally, then, Heidegger views the scientific thing in terms of its\nend-directedness, a feature which we deliberatively experience only\ninsofar as we relate to the thing through math\u0113sis, that is, only insofar\nas we study or learn it. A further formal feature of the scientific thing is,\ntherefore, epistemic circularity: we can only know it because we already\nknow it. This may raise the worry that Heidegger\u2019s account of math\u0113sis\nattributes to science a fallacious form of reasoning. On this account,\nso the worry goes, the conclusion of a scientific inference is already\namong its initial premises; hence, science gives us no reason to accept\nits conclusions as valid.\nBut we are already familiar, from Chapter Four, with Heidegger\u2019s\nresponse to this worry in respect of logic, construed as the science of\nthe rules of reason. The worry there was that, since science is grounded\nin rules of reasoning, and since logic is identical with those rules, then\nlogic grounds logic.\nIn response, Heidegger rejected the premise which equates logic\nand rules. Logic may presuppose rules, but rules do not entail logic.\nIndeed, only when the rules of reason have been rendered in a specific\nand determinate way do they count as rules of logic. The job of logic, as\nthe science of thinking, is to deliberatively take note of the general and\nindeterminate rules which implicitly govern informal reasoning, and\nthen to study them in a way which specifies and determines them, in\nother words, clearly explicates them in a formal system. Hence, it is not\nthe case that the conclusions of the science of logic are already among\nits premises, because the relation between premises and conclusion is\ninterpretative rather than inferential. The science of logic is a practice 242 Science as Social Existence\nin which informal thinking becomes formalised, in which general and\nindeterminate rules of reason are rendered specific and determinate. If\nthere is a circularity here, then it is not vicious.\nWe can now see that logic is a particular case of the more general\nscientific practice of math\u0113sis. Our past discussion of this case, in turn,\nshows why we need not worry about the circularity of math\u0113sis: this\ncircularity is interpretative rather than inferential, hermeneutical rather\nthan logical, and so virtuous rather than vicious. It is a fundamental\nfeature of science conceptualised as an ultimately informal existential\npractice, rather than as a logically determinate system of precisely\ndefined concepts. Furthermore, science, as a form of reasoning, is\nguided by rules. Logic may seek to thematise and define those rules,\nbut the natural sciences will be less concerned with explicating and\ndetermining the dynamics of their own thinking, and more interested\nin reliably explicating and determining the whatness of the material\nthings they take to be the object of that thinking. According to Heidegger,\nthese sciences ultimately attend to the end-directedness of natural\nthings. The rules of reason governing this attention help scientists to\nreliably distinguish relevant from irrelevant phenomena vis-\u00e0-vis their\nunderstanding of what the thing is. In other words, these rules play a\nnormative role in scientific research.\nAs a scientific practice, then, math\u0113sis is ruled by norms. As we also\nsaw in Chapter Four, Heidegger traces philosophical descriptions\nof the norm governing the relationship between thinking and things\nback to Plato\u2019s mythic and polysemous image of the cosmic demiurge.\nAccording to Heidegger, this image \u2014 as well as its cognates, the sun\nand the idea of the good \u2014 mark Plato\u2019s discovery of the a priori element\nin our understanding of things. The image of the demiurge, in particular,\nreflects the impulse of some early Greek thinkers to construe thinking\nand things in terms of craft production. As Heidegger observes in\nthis context, \u2018[a]ll forming of shaped products is effected by using an\nimage, in the sense of a model, as guide and standard.\u201934 Hence, the\nnormative aspect of math\u0113sis, as a productive practice, stands as an a\npriori image in the experience of working with things, as a projective\nimage guiding the pursuit of a specific and determinate knowledge of\nthose things. Heidegger describes this image as a Grundriss, a \u2018ground\n34 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 106. 5. Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 243\nrendering\u2019 or \u2018basic blueprint.\u2019 For present purposes, we should note\nthe dual nature of the blueprint representing the normative element\nin scientific practice. On the one hand, a blueprint helps guide the act\nof production. On the other hand, it represents, schematically, the end\nresult of production. A blueprint is thus both a set of directions, and\nan image of that towards which those directions point. As a model of\nscientific practice, it captures, consequentially, both the how and the\nwhat of that practice. To experience the scientific thing in terms of its\nend-directedness thus means to experience it in light of an image of\nboth its direction and its end. This image enables, is the condition of\npossibility for, that experience.\nThat math\u0113sis is guided by a basic blueprint lies at the core of\nHeidegger\u2019s account of modern science. Heidegger views this blueprint\nin terms of a \u2018measure.\u2019 He writes that \u2018[t]his basic plan (Grundriss) [\u2026]\nprovides the measure [Ma\u00dfstab] for laying out of the realm, which, in\nthe future, will encompass all things of that sort.\u201935 Hence, the ground\nplan regulates scientific practice by imposing a general measure, a\nmeasure meant to apply to all things falling within the plan. Note that,\nalthough Heidegger introduces the concept of \u2018measure\u2019 in the context\nof his discussion of the mathematical, we are not meant to view this\nmeasure in quantitative terms. One can, for example, take the measure\nof a thing without judging it according to some quantitative unit. For\nexample, the common phrase \u2018taking the measure of a man\u2019 need not\nimply quantification. On the other hand, one cannot judge a thing\nquantitatively without also taking its measure. In Heidegger\u2019s account,\nthe mathematical and the quantitative are connected, but the former\nis a broader category than the latter: \u2018[i]n no way [\u2026] is the essence of\nthe mathematical defined by numberness.\u201936 Hence, while the practice\n35 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 92.\n36 M artin Heidegger (1977a [1952]), \u2018The Age of the World Picture,\u2019 in The Question\nConcerning Technology, by Martin Heidegger, trans. by William Lovitt (New York:\nHarper & Row), pp. 115\u201354 (p. 119); cf.

The OED defines\n\u2018measure,\u2019 in one substantive sense, as a \u2018standard or rule of judgement; a criterion,\ntest; also, a standard by which something is determined or regulated.\u2019 244 Science as Social Existence\nof math\u0113sis may include numerical calculation, it cannot be reduced to\nsuch calculation. To render a general and indeterminate knowledge\nmore specific and determinate does not necessarily mean to render it\nmore numerically precise.\nIn addition to circularity and normativity, there is a third parallel\nbetween the present discussion and our earlier discussion of Heidegger\u2019s\nphenomenological history of logical practice. This has to do with the\nsource of normativity, of the measure regulating modern scientific\npractice. Recall from Chapter Four that Heidegger describes the\ntemporal aspect of scientific work experience in terms of \u2018original time,\u2019\nthat is, time as experienced in the course of our immersion in a work-\nworld. Original time becomes intelligible to us in terms of two types of\nrelation: in-order-to relations; and for-the-sake-of-which relations. The\nmanifold of in-order-to relations is an existential space within which a\nparticular piece of equipment is let be what it is in its readiness-to-hand.\nThis manifold, in turn, is revealed only in light of the for-the-sake-of-\nwhich relation. Only on the basis of the for-the-sake-of-which do we\nexperience the intelligibility of things within a work-world. As we saw\nin Chapter Four, Heidegger also viewed the for-the-sake-of-which as a\nsocial phenomenon, rooted in, and continually nourished by, tradition.\nHence, according to him, the source of normativity, of the measure\nregulating scientific practice, is tradition.\nThe multiplicity of in-order-to relations serves the same role as\nthe iteration of assignment, or what Heidegger also calls the \u2018totality\nof end-directness\u2019 (Bewandtnisganzheit), in which a particular thing is\nlet be what it is in its end-directedness.37 And just as the multiplicity\nis revealed only in light of the for-the-sake-of-which, so too does this\ntotality of end-directedness bottom out in the for-the-sake-of-which. In\nbeing at work with the thing in a way which lets it be what it is, we must\nalready possess an at least general and indefinite knowledge of the\nthing\u2019s final end. Heidegger describes this ultimate end as an existential\npossibility of the subject. We may now more decisively identify it as a\npossibility afforded by the historical tradition in which the subject finds\nitself. According to Heidegger, the final end of modern scientific practice,\nthat towards which it is ultimately directed, is rooted in an existential\n37 Heidegger (1927), Sein und Zeit, p. 84; cf. Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 116\n[84]. 5. Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 245\npossibility of the subject\u2019s own socio-cultural history. Furthermore, this\nend has the formal structure of a ground plan, a basic blueprint laying\nout the measure against which all things falling within its domain \u2014 all\npotentially scientific things \u2014 will be judged.\nIn one last link to the discussion in Chapter Four, the socio-historical\nprovenance of the ground plan of modern scientific practice suggests\na solution to the sociological problem of \u2018priming.\u2019 Recall Bloor\u2019s\ndistinction between a self-referring practice, in which things acquire\ntheir meaning, and the priming element which gets that practice\ngoing. I argued that the for-the-sake-of-which, as the a priori element\nwhich grounds the multiplicity of in-order-to relations, serves as such\na priming element. It is just a small step to now apply that argument\nto Heidegger\u2019s description of the for-the-sake-of-which as an a priori\nground plan which both directs, and serves as the final end for, the\nmodern scientific practice of math\u0113sis.\nAs we will see in what follows, this move has consequential\nimplications for the historiography of early-modern science. Specifically,\nit offers an at least partial answer to the question of how the Scientific\nRevolution got going. Here, the Scientific Revolution is understood as\nthe emergence of a new cognitive and material domain in which to make\nsense of the things of nature. On Heidegger\u2019s account of math\u0113sis, this\nnew domain traces its origin back to a socio-historically conditioned\npossibility within the everyday work-world of early-modern subjectivity.\nFurthermore, because Heidegger argues that this socially contingent\npossibility is manifest in experience, whether informally or formally, as\nan image \u2014 a ground rendering or basic blueprint \u2014 we may treat it\nas a social image. As we will see later in Chapter Six, this allows us to\nconnect Heidegger\u2019s existential conception of science in yet another way\nto SSK, specifically, to David Bloor\u2019s linkage between knowledge and\nsocial imagery.\nLet us now return to Heidegger\u2019s argument that the decisive\ndifference between ancient and medieval science, on the one hand,\nand modern science, on the other, cannot be explained by the claim\nthat modern science uniquely emphasises facts, measurement, and\nexperiment as the grounds for natural knowledge. For Heidegger, it is\nrather the difference in the way the facts are conceived, the way the\nmeasurement or experiment is done, which is decisive. The question is 246 Science as Social Existence\nnot whether facts, measurement, and experiment are employed \u2014 they\nare employed in all three periods \u2014 but to what end they are employed.\nAccording to Heidegger, it is the kind of end-directedness possessed by\nmodern scientific things which distinguishes them from their ancient\nand medieval predecessors, namely, their directedness towards a basic\nblueprint, a single regulative ground plan, in respect of which they are\nlet be what they are. In establishing facts about things, in measuring\nand experimenting on those things, math\u0113sis skips over their token\nspecificities, instead taking note of the regulative ground plan according\nto which the scientific thing, in general, becomes intelligible as what it is.\nThe similarities and differences between ancient science, at least\nas exemplified in the earlier example of Galen, and math\u0113sis seem\nstraightforward enough. Despite their specific disagreements, Galen\u2019s\nempiricist and rationalist physicians agree, in general, that medical\nknowledge should be \u2018technical\u2019 or objective, that is, grounded in fact.\nThey also agree on the necessity of an a priori standard according to\nwhich physicians take the measure of, and are thus able to discriminate\nbetween, epistemically relevant and irrelevant phenomena. In a broad\nsense, then, ancient science is concerned with both facts and measures.\nHowever, Galen\u2019s empiricist and rationalist appear to disagree on the\nneed for experiment. Recall the rationalist physician\u2019s argument that\nreliable judgements can be made on the basis of a single observation,\nthereby dismissing the necessity of working with things over time. For\nthe empiricist, in contrast, one must proceed \u2018little by little,\u2019 slowly\nacquiring knowledge over time through a method of disciplined serial\nobservation of the things.\nThis disagreement between the ancient rationalist and empiricist\nover the need for a method of enquiry seems conjoined with their\nfurther disagreement over the necessary degree of determinateness of\nthe physician\u2019s a priori knowledge of the measure of medical knowledge.\nThe rationalist requires such knowledge to be fully determinate, a\ncondition which then enables immediate judgement on the basis of\none observation. Galen\u2019s empiricist, on the other hand, is content to\nleave such knowledge indeterminate, or obscure, arguing that \u2018not a\nparticle of harm befalls arts and men [\u2026] for being ignorant of such\nthings.\u2019 In contrast to math\u0113sis, then, Galen\u2019s empirical method does not\nseek to turn a general and indeterminate knowledge of the thingness 5. Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 247\nof things into a particular and determinate knowledge. To his credit,\nGalen may thus avoid charges of circularity. However, as already\nmentioned, it is hard to see the scientific merit of his position. Indeed,\nhow should reliable discrimination be achieved in the absence of an\nincreasingly determinate knowledge of the standard which guides such\ndiscrimination?\nAs we will see in the next section, this question also troubled\nRenaissance physicians. They answered with the argument that a\ndeterminate knowledge of the norms guiding their medical practice was\nboth necessary and to be gained little by little through an incremental\nmethod for working with the things. As a consequence, these\nRenaissance physicians faced the same worry about circularity which\narises in Heidegger\u2019s account of modern scientific practice as math\u0113sis.\nAnd their practical response to this worry turns out to have been not so\nvery different from Heidegger\u2019s own. This suggests that the decisive\ndifference between math\u0113sis and medieval scientific practice was,\nperhaps, not quite so straightforward as Heidegger had imagined. Yet,\nwithout this difference, math\u0113sis can no longer provide an explanation\nfor the rise of a definitively modern science, in short, for the Scientific\nRevolution. So, let us now consider this Renaissance method in some\ndetail, before then comparing it with Heidegger\u2019s account of early-\nmodern math\u0113sis.\n3. Renaissance Regressus and the\nLogic of Discovery\nAccording to John Randall, Renaissance scholars at the University of\nPadua, in Northern Italy, developed an account of scientific enquiry\nwhich they described as a \u2018double process.\u201938 According to this account,\na proper scientific method will begin with some observed effect, seek\nthe cause of that effect, and then use that cause to explain the effect.\nThis amounts to a recommendation that the effect be explained in\nterms of a cause which can itself be known only through that effect.\nThe explanation of the effect thus seems to presuppose knowledge of\n38 J ohn Herman Randall, Jr (1940), \u2018The Development of the Scientific Method in the\nSchool of Padua,\u2019 Journal of the History of Ideas 1(2), 177\u2013206 (p. 190). 248 Science as Social Existence\nthat very same effect. Hence, scientists appear to explain only what they\nalready know. As a consequence, there would seem to be no need for\na method by which scientists acquire knowledge because they already\npossess the knowledge in question.\nAccording to Randall, this double process had already been described\nin 1334 by Urban the Averroist.39 A more concretely developed account\ncan be found later in the writings of Jacopo da Forl\u00ec (ca. 1364\u20131413/14),\nwho taught medicine and natural philosophy at Padua. Forl\u00ec wrote:\n[I]f when you have a fever you first grasp the concept of fever, you\nunderstand the fever in general and confusedly. You then resolve the\nfever into its causes, since any fever comes either from the heating of the\nhumor or of the spirits or of the members; and again the heating of the\nhumor is either of the blood or of the phlegm, etc.; until you arrive at the\nspecific and distinct cause and knowledge of that fever.40\nFrom this description, it is clear that Forl\u00ec did not consider the\ncircularity of the espoused method to be irremediably vicious. Indeed,\nas he describes, the knowledge of the effect \u2014 the fever \u2014 undergoes\na transformation in the course of the method. It is not, strictly speaking,\nthe same knowledge in the end that it was at the beginning. Forl\u00ec\nemphasised the need for a procedure by which a general and confused\nknowledge of the effect is \u2018resolved\u2019 into a specific and distinct\nknowledge of that same effect. Randall describes this as \u2018a clear case of\nthe method of medical diagnosis.\u201941\n39 R andall (1940), \u2018The Development of the Scientific Method,\u2019 p. 190. Alistair Crombie\nsuggests that the Paduan \u2018double process\u2019 was imported from Oxford around\n1400 (Alistair C. Crombie (1962), Robert Grosseteste and the Origins of Experimental\nScience (1100\u20131700) (Oxford: Clarendon Press), p. 297). However, Randall\u2019s dating\nindicates that its earliest known appearance in Padua was prior to 1400.\n40 C ited in Randall (1940), \u2018The Development of the Scientific Method,\u2019 p. 189;\noriginally from Jacobi de Forlivio super Tegni Galeni, Padua, 1475, comm.

As I have\nshown elsewhere, something like the Paduan double procedure \u2014 and, indeed,\nHeideggerian math\u0113sis \u2014 can also been found in Ludwik Fleck\u2019s historical account\nof the medical diagnosis of syphilis (Jeff Kochan (2015c), \u2018Circles of Scientific\nPractice: Regressus, Math\u0113sis, Denkstil,\u2019 in Critical Science Studies after Ludwik Fleck,\ned. by Dimitri Ginev (Sophia: St. Kliment Ohridski University Press), pp. 83\u201399;\nreprinted as Jeff Kochan (2016), \u2018Circles of Scientific Practice: Regressus, Math\u0113sis,\nDenkstil,\u2019 in Fleck and the Hermeneutics of Science (Collegium Helveticum Heft 14), ed.\nby Erich Otto Graf, Martin Schmid and Johannes Fehr (Z\u00fcrich, 2016), pp. 85\u201393).\nSee Ludwik Fleck (1979 [1935]), Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact, trans.\nby Fred Bradley and Thaddeus J. Trenn, ed. by Thaddeus J. Trenn and Robert K.\nMerton (Chicago: University of Chicago Press). 5. Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 249\nDuring the fifteenth century, there was an increasing focus on this\ndouble process, which came to be called regressus in order to emphasise\nits exclusion from the charge of being a circulus vitiosus, a vicious circle.\nPaul of Venice (ca. 1369\u20131429) launched an early defence of the regressus\nagainst this charge, arguing that:\nScientific knowledge of the cause depends on a knowledge of the effect,\njust as scientific knowledge of the effect depends on a knowledge\nof the cause, since we know the cause through the effect before we\nknow the effect through the cause. This is the principal rule in all\ninvestigation, that a scientific knowledge of natural effects demands a\nprior knowledge of their causes and principles. \u2014 This is not a circle,\nhowever. [\u2026] [T]he knowledge of why (propter quid) the effect is, is not\nthe knowledge that (quia) it is an effect. Therefore the knowledge of the\neffect does not depend on itself, but upon something else.42\nThis \u2018something else,\u2019 which distinguishes the regressus from a vicious\ncircle, was addressed by Agostino Nifo (ca. 1473\u20131538/45), a student\nand later a teacher of medicine and philosophy at Padua. He called it\nnegotiatio, and included it as the third of the four kinds of knowledge\nwhich comprise the scientific method:\nThe first kind is of the effect through the senses, or observation; the second\nis the discovery (inventio) of the cause through the effect [\u2026]; the third is\nknowledge of the same cause through an examination (negotiatio) by the\nintellect, from which there first comes such an increased knowledge of\nthe cause [\u2026]; the fourth is a knowledge of the same effect propter quid,\nthrough that cause known so certainly [\u2026].\u201d43\nNifo further specified negotiatio as an intellectual act of \u2018composition\nand division\u2019: \u2018negotiatio is directed toward the cause as a [\u2026] definition.\nBut since a definition is discovered only through composition and\ndivision, it is through them that the cause is discovered in the form\n[\u2026] from which we can then proceed to the effect.\u2019 What Forl\u00ec earlier\nidentified as the process by which a general and confused knowledge of\na thing is \u2018resolved\u2019 into a specific and distinct knowledge of that same\n42 C ited in Randal (1940), \u2018The Development of the Scientific Method,\u2019 p. 191;\noriginally from Summa philosophiae naturalis magistri Pauli Venti, Venice, 1503, I, cap.\nix.\n43 C ited in Randall (1940), \u2018The Development of the Scientific Method,\u2019 p. 192;\noriginally from Augustino Niphi philosophi suessani exposition\u2026 de Physico auditu,\nVenice, 1552, I, com. Text 4. 250 Science as Social Existence\nthing is now identified by Nifo as an intellectual process of negotiatio,\nor definition. Through negotiatio, an originally confused and general\nknowledge of a cause is rendered more definite.\nNifo\u2019s concept of negotiatio was further developed by Jacopo Zabarella\n(1533\u20131589), who also taught philosophy at Padua, but, unlike those of\nhis predecessors mentioned above, did not have a degree in medicine.44\nAbout the role of negotiatio in the regressus, Zabarella wrote:\nWhen the first stage of the procedure has been completed, which is\nfrom effect to cause, before we return from the latter to the effect, there\nmust intervene a third intermediate process (labor) by which we may be\nled to a distinct knowledge of that cause which so far has been known\nonly confusedly. Some men knowing this to be necessary have called\nit a negotiatio of the intellect. We can call it a \u2018mental examination.\u2019 [\u2026]\n[S]till they have not shown how it leads us to a distinct knowledge of\nthe cause, and what is the precise force of this negotiatio\u2026. There are, I\njudge, two things that help us to know the cause distinctly. One is the\nknowledge that it is, which prepares us to discover what it is. [\u2026] The\nother help, without which this first would not suffice, is the comparison\nof the cause discovered with the effect through which it was discovered,\nnot indeed with the full knowledge that this is the cause and that the\neffect, but just comparing this with that. Thus it comes about that we are\nled gradually to the knowledge of the conditions of that thing; and when\none of the conditions has been discovered we are helped to the discovery\nof another, until we finally know this to be the cause of that effect.45\nAccording to Zabarella, in order to gain knowledge of what a cause is,\nwe must first know that it is. This knowledge-that enables a knowledge-\nwhat of the cause, a knowledge which is not immediately grasped, but\nwhich only becomes clear and distinct through a fragile method of\nmental comparison. By this method, we are \u2018led\u2019 to a distinct knowledge\nof the \u2018conditions\u2019 of the thing under investigation. For Zabarella, these\nconditions can also be understood as the \u2018principles\u2019 from which the\nrelation between cause and effect may be securely determined. As our\nknowledge of these conditions or principles improves, we acquire an\n44 E ckhard Kessler (1988), \u2018The Intellective Soul,\u2019 in The Cambridge History of\nRenaissance Philosophy, ed. by Charles B. Schmitt, Quentin Skinner, Eckhard Kessler\nand Jill Kraye (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), pp. 485\u2013534 (p. 836).\n45 C ited in Randall (1940), \u2018The Development of the Scientific Method,\u2019 p. 200\u201301;\noriginally from Jacopo Zabarella, De Regressu, chpt. 5. 5. Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 251\nincreasingly determinate knowledge of the whatness of the cause, and\nhence also of its necessary relation to the effect.\nRandall suggests that Zabarella represents the climax of a long\nhistorical development in which scientific knowledge was increasingly\nrecognised to rely on a form of experience which distinctly differs from\n\u2018ordinary observation,\u2019 in the sense of the \u2018accidental or planless collection\nof particular cases.\u201946 Scientific experience is disciplined by method.\nForl\u00ec called this method \u2018resolution.\u2019 Nifo called it negotiatio. Zabarella\ncalled it \u2018mental examination.\u2019 The necessity of this method undermines\nthe claim that reasoning from effect to cause and then from cause back\nto effect must be viciously circular. Indeed, the method appears to be\nnecessary just because the circle is not vicious. The knowledge of the\ncause at the beginning is not identical with the knowledge of the cause\nat the conclusion. The required method mediates between these two\ndistinct ways of knowing the cause, joining them in a manner which\nthen also transforms our original knowledge of the effect.\nThis method, then, is a method of discovery. Randall argues that the\nPaduan philosophers worked out \u2018a logic of investigation and inquiry\u2019\nto accompany the existing Aristotelian theory of proof.47 Zabarella, in\nparticular, paid an \u2018ever closer attention to the way of discovery, to\nthe careful and painstaking analysis of experience, to the method of\nresolution.\u201948 Strikingly, Zabarella justified the need for a method of\ndiscovery by pointing to the finitude of human cognitive abilities:\nSince because of the weakness of our mind and powers the principles\nfrom which demonstration [i.e., proof] is to be made are unknown to\nus, and since we cannot set out from the unknown, we are of necessity\nforced to resort to a kind of secondary procedure, which is the resolutive\nmethod that leads to the discovery of principles, so that once they are\nfound we can demonstrate the natural effects from them. [\u2026] It is certain\nthat if in coming to any science we were already in possession of a\nknowledge of all its principles, resolution would there be superfluous.49\n46 R andall (1940), \u2018The Development of the Scientific Method,\u2019 p. 199.\n47 R andall (1940), \u2018The Development of the Scientific Method,\u2019 p. 201.\n48 R andall (1940), \u2018The Development of the Scientific Method,\u2019 p. 204.\n49 C ited in Randall (1940), \u2018The Development of the Scientific Method,\u2019 p. 197\u201398;\noriginally from Jacopo Zabarella, De Methodis, III, xviii. 252 Science as Social Existence\nThis may be read as a critical response to Galen\u2019s dogmatic physician,\nwhom we met at the start of this chapter. Zabarella argues that because we\nlack the innate ability to immediately grasp, with clarity and confidence,\nthe principles governing natural phenomena, we must rely on a method\nwhich enables us to articulate those principles on the basis of our finite\nsensory experience. Furthermore, Randall attributes to Zabarella the\nadditional claim that, because this method serves to discipline and\ndirect our experience of phenomena, it must be distinguished from the\ncomparatively free and unstructured sensory experience indicative of\nmore familiar, everyday modes of perception.\nYet, Randall seems to have been too optimistic in his assertion\nthat Zabarella successfully worked out a logic or method of scientific\ndiscovery, as opposed to having just demonstrated the need for such a\nmethod. Indeed, when Zabarella turns to a discussion of different modes\nof discovery, his account is remarkably thin on detail. As we saw above,\nafter first characterising \u2018mental examination\u2019 as the method by which\na confused and indeterminate knowledge of the cause gets transformed\ninto a clear and determinate knowledge, Zabarella then describes this\ntransformation in terms of \u2018just comparing\u2019 the cause with the effect\nsuch that \u2018it comes about\u2019 that we are \u2018led gradually\u2019 to the conditions\nof the cause. But what rules structure this comparing, and so guide\nus to the correct causal conditions? Zabarella does not say. However,\nit appears that, if he had entertained the existence of such rules, then\nhe would likely have considered them to be rules of reason. Consider\nhis discussion of induction as a method of discovery. In his view, a\nuniversal stands to a particular as cause stands to effect. The relevant\nnotion of cause is, in this context, an Aristotelian notion of formal cause.\nFurthermore, knowledge of the universal is gained inductively through\nexperience of the relevant particulars. In other words, the formal cause\nis known through its effects. Thus, Zabarella writes: \u2018One says that\n\u201chuman\u201d is something truly sensible, not because the senses recognise\nhumans as something universal, but because particular individual\nhumans are sensible.\u201950 Zabarella\u2019s thus roots knowledge of universals\nin sensory experience:\n50 J acobi Zabarella (1985), De Methodis; De Regressus, ed. by Cesare Vasoli (Bologna:\nCooperativa Libraria Universitaria Editrice), p. 99.

Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 253\n[A]ll our knowledge takes its origin from sense, nor can we know\nanything with our minds unless we have known it first by sense.\nHence all principles of this kind are made known to us by induction\n[\u2026]. [I]nduction does not prove a thing through something else; in a\ncertain sense it reveals that thing through itself. For the universal is not\ndistinguished from the particular in the thing itself, but only by reason\n[ratio].51\nIt turns out, then, that a crucial ingredient in the regressus, which serves\nto enable scientific knowledge, is our capacity for reason. But what\nrole does reason play in transforming a confused knowledge that the\ncause is into a determinate knowledge of what it is? Zabarella writes\nthat induction \u2018does not take all the particulars into account, since after\ncertain of them have been examined our mind straightaway notices the\nessential connection, and then disregarding the remaining particulars\nproceeds at once to bring together the universal.\u201952 Reason thus allows\nus to apply a measure of salience to the data of our sense experience,\nto distinguish epistemically relevant particulars from epistemically\nirrelevant ones. It equips us with a standard by which to discriminate\nthe essential from the accidental, the good data from the bad data, in\nour search for the clear and determinate cause or causes of a particular\nsensible effect. Reason, in other words, provides the norms enabling\nproper scientific judgement. A successful method is one which, among\nother things, embodies these rational norms. Zabarella seems to have\nnever addressed the discriminative power of reason explicitly in such\nterms. He did not, in other words, thematise this intellectual power\nin such formal terms as \u2018measure,\u2019 \u2018rule,\u2019 or \u2018norm.\u2019 Nevertheless, his\ninquiry does explicitly uncover a normative element in thinking which,\nas we saw in Chapter Four, will later be formally articulated by Kant as\na \u2018faculty of rules.\u2019\nThe question now arises of where Zabarella thought this\ndiscriminative power, these rational norms, to come from.

As\nHarold Skulsky has argued, \u2018[t]he inductive process to which a writer\nlike Zabarella pays tribute [\u2026] depends ultimately, not on reason, but\non the generosity, or more properly the grace, of an alien will.\u201953 Eckhard\nKessler similarly observes that, for Zabarella, because our irremediably\nfinite epistemic power is capable of \u2018containing the universal structure\nonly in a confused and unintelligible way, it had to be illuminated by the\nagent intellect [intellectus agens], so that the universal in the individual\nwas rendered distinct and intelligible.\u2019 Zabarella furthermore held\nthat the intellectus agens could be identified \u2018with God himself as the\nprinciple of intelligibility.\u201954 Nicholas Jardine views this as evidence for\nthe reliance of Zabarella\u2019s scientific method on \u2018divine revelation,\u2019 and\nhe equates Zabarella\u2019s notion of intellectus agens with the Holy Spirit.55\nHowever, Jardine appears to carry this argument too far, concluding\nalso that Zabarella took clear and determinate knowledge of the cause\nto be \u2018formed in the imagination through a merely passive observation\nof the world.\u201956 It would seem that the point is, instead, that finite\nhuman beings may well actively observe natural phenomena, but, in\nthe absence of normative guidelines for structuring that observation,\nthey will not achieve proper scientific knowledge of those phenomena.57\nThis has been argued by Charles Schmitt, who provides evidence that\n\u2018Zabarella did take it upon himself to go out and look at nature; and, what\nis more important, he observed carefully what he saw and applied it to\nthe crucial philosophical questions in which he was interested.\u201958 What\n53 H arold Skulsky (1968), \u2018Paduan Epistemology and the Doctrine of the One Mind,\u2019\nJournal of the History of Philosophy 6(4), 341\u201361 (p. 341).\n54 E ckhard Kessler (1988), \u2018The Intellective Soul,\u2019 in The Cambridge History of\nRenaissance Philosophy, ed. by Charles B.

As argued above, such effort is called for\njust because the regressus is not viciously circular.\n58 C harles B.

Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 255\nZabarella does not do, however, \u2018is consciously, and with forethought,\nattempt to test a particular theory or hypothesis by devising a specific\nexperiment or observational situation by which to resolve the question.\u201959\nSchmitt thus concludes that \u2018Zabarella can be called an empiricist with\nsome justification, but he is clearly not an experimentalist,\u2019 at least not\nin the early-modern sense of that term.60\nWe saw earlier that Randall believed Zabarella to have drawn a clear\ndistinction between scientific experience, on the one hand, and ordinary\nobservation, in the sense of \u2018accidental or planless collection of particular\ncases,\u2019 on the other. On this basis, Randall attempts to turn Zabarella\ninto a proto-experimentalist, thereby establishing a clear continuity\nbetween the method of regressus and the Galilean experimental\nmethod which would emerge in the years shortly afterwards. We\nmay now conclude that the distinction was more subtle than that, too\nsubtle, in fact, to justify naming Zabarella a precursor to the Galilean\nexperimental method. While his approach to observation was careful\nand goal-oriented rather than accidental and planless, he did not seek\nto discipline or control, much less to create, the act of observation in the\nmanner distinctive of subsequent early-modern experimentalists. There\nwas something missing in Zabarella\u2019s conception of scientific method,\nsomething which prevented him from making the final step towards a\nmodern scientific way of working with and thinking about nature. In\nfact, Randall recognised that absence, but he apparently minimises its\nsignificance:\nThere was but one element lacking in Zabarella\u2019s formulation of method:\nhe did not insist that the principles of natural science be mathematical.\n[\u2026] With this mathematical emphasis added to the logical methodology\nof Zabarella, there stands completed the \u2018new method\u2019 for which men\nhad been so eagerly seeking.61\nFrom the perspective of Heidegger\u2019s existential conception of\nscience, this missing mathematical element appears to be the key\nfeature separating Renaissance regressus from early-modern math\u0113sis.\nFurthermore, Heidegger argued that the emergence of early-modern\n59 S chmitt (1969), \u2018Experience and Experiment,\u2019 p. 105.\n60 S chmitt (1969), \u2018Experience and Experiment,\u2019 p. 106.\n61 R andall (1940), \u2018The Development of the Scientific Method,\u2019 pp. 204\u201305. 256 Science as Social Existence\nexperimental science was possible only because natural science had\nitself become mathematical, in the sense of adopting math\u0113sis as its core\nmethod of discovery. On this account, it seems to follow that Zabarella\ncould not be a precursor to early-modern experimentalism because he\ndid not experience the things of nature mathematically, as math\u0113mata.\nBut before we can properly delineate the dependency of early-modern\nexperimental science on the mathematical projection of nature, we must\nfirst more carefully consider the similarities and differences between\nRenaissance regressus and early-modern math\u0113sis.\n4. From Renaissance Regressus\nto Early-Modern Math\u0113sis\nThere are three broad features in respect of which regressus and\nmath\u0113sis may be usefully compared. These are: circularity, finitude,\nand method. Not only do these features figure prominently in both\nregressus and math\u0113sis, the relation of each to the others is also similar\nin both cases. To begin with, regressus and math\u0113sis are both manifestly\ncircular accounts of scientific reasoning. In both cases, too, the account\ncan be defended against charges of vicious circularity. As we saw in\nthe previous section, Zabarella argued that the \u2018weakness of our mind\nand powers\u2019 renders us incapable of immediately possessing, with\nclarity and confidence, the scientific principles determining the causes\nof observed natural phenomena. Indeed, according to Zabarella, if\nwe falsely believe ourselves capable of spontaneously grasping such\nprinciples, then we might claim to possess scientific knowledge of\na phenomenon simply because we have observed it. Reasoning in a\ntight circle, we would be attempting to justify our knowledge of the\nphenomenon by citing our knowledge of it. This circle of reasoning is\nvicious. Zabarella argues that we cannot justify such claims to clear\nand immediate scientific knowledge, because our cognitive powers are\nweak rather than powerful, because they are finite rather than infinite.\nHis argument that the circle of scientific reasoning is virtuous rather\nthan vicious depends on his acknowledgement that our cognitive\npowers are ineluctably finite in scope.\nAlthough cognitive finitude is, as we saw in Chapter Three, a central\nelement in Heidegger\u2019s existential conception of science, he did not 5. Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 257\nexplicitly draw a connection between this and his account of modern\nscience as math\u0113sis. The necessary connection between regressus and\nfinitude made by Zabarella may now help us to explicate a similar\nconnection between math\u0113sis and finitude in the case of Heidegger.\nThe circularity of math\u0113sis lies in its being a kind of learning, or\ndiscovering, in which we learn or discover something which we already\nknow. We do not get this knowledge out of the things themselves, by\nsimply observing or otherwise dealing with them, but, as Heidegger\nwrites, \u2018in a certain sense\u2019 we bring it already with us. When we deal\nwith a thing, we bring with us a \u2018fore-conception\u2019 of the thingness of the\nthing.62 More specifically, in dealing with a plant, we bring with us prior\nknowledge of the plant-like of the plant. In other words, the whatness of\na thing is not something we get out of the things themselves, but is instead\na projection which enables us to make sense of those things in terms of\nwhat they are. Heidegger argued that this projection, or fore-conception\nin our understanding, plays a central role in all acts of understanding.\nHe thus defines understanding as an act of interpretation which\ndepends on a perhaps only vaguely specified fore-conception, or prior\nunderstanding, of its subject matter. Understanding is thus a circular\nphenomenon: \u2018Any interpretation which is to contribute understanding,\nmust already have understood what is to be interpreted.\u201963 Because\nthis circle in understanding is ineliminably present in all cognitive acts,\nin general, it must also be ineliminably present in all acts of scientific\ncognition, in particular. Heidegger recognised that this renders scientific\ndemonstration circular, but rather than viewing this as a catastrophe, he\ntook it to be an inevitable aspect of finite human existence. This circle\nof understanding, he writes, \u2018is the expression of the existential fore-\nstructure of Dasein itself.\u201964 It is, in other words, a basic structural feature\nof the subject\u2019s projective understanding. This existential structure is\nexpressed in modern scientific cognition, in math\u0113sis, as a metaphysical\nprojection of the thingness of things in terms of a basic ground plan or\nblueprint. As we saw in Chapter Three, Heidegger radically reinterprets\nthe meaning of metaphysics, arguing that the basis for metaphysical\n62 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 191 [150].\n63 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 194 [152].\n64 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 195 [153]. 258 Science as Social Existence\nknowledge, as such, is \u2018the humanness of reason, i.e., its finitude.\u201965 The\nhierarchy of explanation in Heidegger\u2019s account of modern science\nthus breaks down like this: the circularity of scientific practice is to be\nexplained in terms of the ineliminably projective element in math\u0113sis;\nand this ineliminably projective element is to be explained in terms\nof human finitude. In a nutshell, scientific demonstration is circular\nbecause scientific cognition is finite.\nThis is not precisely the same as the connection made by Zabarella\nbetween circularity and finitude. For him, finitude explains why the\ncircle is virtuous rather than vicious. For Heidegger, it explains why\nthere is any circle at all. The reason for this difference can be uncovered\nby addressing the third broad feature shared by both regressus and\nmath\u0113sis: method. For both Zabarella and Heidegger, because we cannot\nimmediately grasp, with clarity, the principles governing observed\nnatural phenomena, we need to find a method which will help us to\nget clear on those principles. Method is thus meant, by both, to steer\nus towards scientific knowledge in spite of our cognitive finitude. But\nhow it does this differs profoundly between the two. For Zabarella,\nmethod is meant to overcome the limitations of finitude. He seems to\nhave believed that, through careful, goal-oriented acts of observation,\nwe can prepare our minds to receive epistemic inspiration from God,\nthe intellectus agens. Thus human cognitive finitude must, on Zabarella\u2019s\naccount, be understood in contradistinction to the infinite cognitive\npower of God, for whom the issue of circularity never arises because\nomniscience makes inferential or interpretative reasoning unnecessary.\nAs we saw in Chapter Three, Heidegger had a profoundly different\naccount of finitude, an account he developed specifically in contrast\nto the one proffered by Kant. Both Heidegger and Kant viewed\ncognitive experience as being comprised of two distinct faculties: the\nfirst, receptivity; the second, constructivity (or projectivity). However,\nwhereas Kant took finitude to be a constraint on receptivity, Heidegger\ntook it to be a constraint on projectivity. For Kant, as Heidegger reads\nhim, finitude is a state of deprivation which prevents us from gaining\ncognitive access to the intrinsic, independently existing properties \u2014 the\nessence, or whatness \u2014 of a thing. For Heidegger, on the other hand,\n65 M artin Heidegger (1997 [1929]), Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, 5th edn,\nenlarged, trans. by Richard Taft (Bloomington: Indiana University Press), p. 15. 5. Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 259\nfinitude is more directly connected to projectivity. The essence of a\nthing is not something we receive from it, but something it possesses\nas a result of the socio-historically conditioned metaphysical projection\nwithin which it is let be what it is. On Heidegger\u2019s account, not even\nan infinitely powerful intellect could grasp the intrinsic, independently\nexisting essence of a thing, because no such essence exists. Hence, the\nfinitude of our receptivity is not the issue; the issue is, instead, the\nfinitude of our projectivity. The range of possible conceptualisations of a\nthing is conditioned by the historical tradition of the subject attempting\nto make sense of that thing. Only within the finite scope of possibilities\nenabled by the subject\u2019s tradition can it experience a thing as intelligible,\nnot to mention develop a clearly defined understanding of what it is.\nThis process of articulation is advanced, for both Heidegger and\nZabarella, by method. Both view method as a means of sharpening up\nthe intelligibility of observed phenomena by clearly defining the causal\nconditions of those phenomena. Indeed, both even understand this\nprocess against the background of the distinction, addressed in Chapter\nTwo, between that-being and what-being, between knowing of a thing\nthat it is and knowing of it what it is. Recall Zabarella\u2019s argument that\nknowledge that a cause is enables us to discover what it is. This discovery\nprocess involves a comparison of cause and effect, through which\nwe are gradually led to scientific knowledge of the causal principles\nunderlying the observed effect. The method of regressus, by which our\nunderstanding of the observed phenomenon is rendered increasingly\ndeterminate, thus presupposes a distinction between the that-being and\nthe what-being of the phenomenon. It presupposes, in other words, a\nversion of the minimal realist doctrine introduced in Chapter Two.\nTo conclude this section, it remains only to emphasise that Zabarella\u2019s\nreflections on method seem to have been motivated by an account of\nfinitude similar to the one which Heidegger attributed to Kant, namely,\none developed in contrast to the notion of an infinitely powerful\nintellectus agens. For Zabarella, method helps us to painstakingly\ntranscend our finite human condition and achieve scientific knowledge\nthrough communion with a divine intelligence. For Heidegger, method\nhelps us, not to transcend the finitude of our existence, but to articulate\nthe historically engendered epistemic possibilities within that existence.\nIn this case, the self-evidence of ordinary understanding is transcended 260 Science as Social Existence\nin pursuit of a more robust, conceptually clear, and critically well-\ngrounded knowledge of nature. Hence, for both Zabarella and\nHeidegger, method is tied to the metaphysics of transcendence. But,\nunlike Zabarella, Heidegger does not treat transcendence as a solution\nto finitude, construed as a problem for knowledge. He views it instead\nas the critical exploration of the finite range of the sometimes only\nvaguely understood epistemic possibilities which a scientist inherits\nthrough her participation in a shared historical tradition. It was for this\nreason that Heidegger reinterpreted metaphysics as being grounded in\nfinitude, rather than as being, as Zabarella ostensibly thought, a means\nby which to overcome such finitude.\nThese respective conceptions of method, including the relation\nbetween method and finitude, imply dramatically different accounts\nof the norms which govern that method. In the case of Zabarella,\nbecause method transcends finitude, the norms which govern it must\nbe similarly transcendent. In the case of Heidegger, because method\ndiscloses the latent possibilities within a historical tradition, the norms\ngoverning it must be embedded within that tradition. This points to\ntwo different understandings of the source of the a priori norms which\ngovern scientific practice. In one case, the ultimate source of normativity\nis timeless. In the other case, it is historical.66 As we will see in the next\nsection, these two perspectives motivate two different historiographic\nstrategies for explaining the transition from late Renaissance to early-\nmodern science. Insofar as that transition is construed as a process\nof mathematicisation, these two strategies also enroll divergent\nconceptions of the mathematical impulse giving rise to early-modern\nscience. In the first case, the mathematicisation of science is an act which\nallows practitioners to slip free from the historical constraints of their\nepistemic tradition. In the other case, it is an act of critical interpretation,\nin which practitioners discover and exploit a possibility latent in their\nhistorical tradition, employing it as a new measure in the production of\nreliable natural knowledge.67\n66 R ecall from Chapter Four, that these two different construals of the a priori are not\nincommensurable. Indeed, Heidegger argues that the timeless construal rests on an\nexperience of time in terms of a present-at-hand succession of \u2018nows.\u2019 This he then\nexplains in terms of a more basic experience of \u2018original time,\u2019 which is enabled and\nsustained by a historical tradition.\n67 T hese contrasting accounts of how the basic measure was set for modern science\nbring to mind contrasting accounts of poetic creation. On the one hand, poetry is 5. Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 261\n5. Mathematics and Metaphysics at the Cusp of\nthe Early-Modern Period\nRandall\u2019s argument for a strong continuity between the Renaissance\nmethod of regressus and the method distinctive of early-modern natural\nphilosophy was quickly and influentially challenged by the historian of\nscience Alexandre Koyr\u00e9. As we have seen, Randall argued that \u2018[t]here\nwas but one element lacking in Zabarella\u2019s formulation of method: he\ndid not insist that the principles of natural science be mathematical.\u201968\nKoyr\u00e9 seizes on this statement, insisting that the missing mathematical\nelement was not as trivial as Randall implies, but instead \u2018forms [\u2026]\nthe content of the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century.\u201969 For\nKoyr\u00e9, the mathematicisation of regressus marks a radical historical\ndiscontinuity in knowledge-making practices, and, more specifically,\na sudden and profound usurpation of Aristotelian natural philosophy\nby a resurgent Platonism. This was, in Koyr\u00e9\u2019s view, the usurpation of\nempirical experience by rational theory: \u2018Experience is useless because\nbefore any experience we are already in possession of the knowledge\nwe are seeking for.\u201970 Koyr\u00e9 thus demonstrates his allegiance to a\nPlatonic doctrine of innate ideas, that is, ideas which we somehow\npossess independently of, and prior to, empirical experience. He also\ndemonstrates his allegiance to the same doctrine as Galen\u2019s rationalist\ncritic of empiricism. This move has its merits if one believes that the\ncircularity of the Paduan method is vicious, and that it must be broken\ndivine inspiration; on the other, it is an evocation of possibilities latent in natural\nlanguage. The idea of poetry as existential measure-setting became crucial for\nHeidegger in the 1950s. According to Charles Bambach, for the later Heidegger,\n\u2018[p]oetry measures the limits of what is appropriate for human beings, shaping the\ncontours of our mortal fate\u2019 (Charles Bambach (2013), Thinking the Poetic Measure of\nJustice: H\u00f6lderlin-Heidegger-Celan (Albany: SUNY Press), p. 174). Indeed, Heidegger\nwould write that poetry sets \u2018[a] strange measure for [\u2026] scientific ideas.\u2019 In so\ndoing, poetry \u2018speaks in \u201cimages\u201d [Bildern]\u2019 (Heidegger (1971a), \u2018\u201c\u2026 Poetically\nMan Dwells\u2026,\u201d\u2019 pp. 223, 226). This recalls, from Chapter Four, Heidegger\u2019s rooting\nof the origins of logic\u2014 the science of thinking \u2014 in Plato\u2019s mythic image of the\ncosmic demiurge. In Chapter Six, I argue that Heidegger placed the origins of the\nearly-modern experiment in a cognate image of the scientific thing.\n68 R andall (1940), \u2018The Development of the Scientific Method,\u2019 p. 204.\n69 A lexandre Koyr\u00e9 (1943a), \u2018Galileo and Plato,\u2019 Journal of the History of Ideas 4(4),\n400\u201328 (p. 406 n. 17).\n70 A lexandre Koyr\u00e9 (1943b), \u2018Galileo and the Scientific Revolution of the Seventeenth\nCentury,\u2019 Philosophical Review 52(4), 333\u201348 (p. 347). 262 Science as Social Existence\nthrough escape into a non-experiential realm of pure thought, an\northodoxly understood metaphysical realm lying beyond the worldly\nrealm of physical sensation.\nThere is some modest reason to think that Koyr\u00e9\u2019s interpretation\nof the history of science may have been influenced by his reading of\nHeidegger, that his emphasis on the mathematicisation of method\ntracked Heidegger\u2019s own description of the historical shift to math\u0113sis.\nIndeed, a 1931 French translation of Heidegger\u2019s 1929 inaugural\nlecture \u2018What is Metaphysics?\u2019 included an introduction by Koyr\u00e9,\nin which he describes Heidegger as \u2018one of those great metaphysical\ngeniuses whose influence marks an entire period.\u201971 The period in\nquestion was, of course, Koyr\u00e9\u2019s own. Yet, it seems that Koyr\u00e9 failed\nto properly understand both Heidegger\u2019s stance towards metaphysics,\nand, more specifically, towards Platonism, as well as his view of the\nrole played by mathematics in early-modern natural philosophy. With\nrespect to Heidegger\u2019s stance towards Platonism, recall that Heidegger\nreinterprets Plato\u2019s fundamental and unifying idea of the good in terms\nof what Heidegger dubbed the \u2018for-the-sake-of-which\u2019 (Worumwillen).\nThe for-the-sake-of-which lends a compelling intelligibility and\ncoherence to experience by guiding us in our discrimination between\ncognitively valuable and cognitively irrelevant or deceptive phenomena.\nLike Plato\u2019s idea of the good, captured also in the mythical image of the\ncosmic demiurge, the for-the-sake-of-which denotes the a priori rules\nof reason which bring together things and thinking in the production\nof natural knowledge. The phenomenological importance of Plato\u2019s\ntheory of ideas, then, lies in the emphasis it puts on our compulsive\nfeeling \u2014 our affectivity\u2014 towards the basic rules of reasoning, rules\nwhich help us to distinguish between epistemically good and bad\nphenomena. However, whereas Plato sought to explain this feeling of\ncompulsion in terms of receptivity towards a supernatural realm of\nideas, Heidegger attempted to instead explain it in naturalistic terms, as\nreceptivity towards the manifold intersubjective history of a prevailing\ncultural tradition. In both cases, the phenomenology of this feeling of\ncompulsion \u2014 this experience of objective necessity \u2014 is recognised\n71 \u2018 [\u2026] un de ces grands g\u00e9nies m\u00e9taphysiques qui marquent de leur influence une\np\u00e9riode tout enti\u00e8re\u2019 (Alexandre Koyr\u00e9 (1931), \u2018L\u2019introduction du \u201cQu\u2019est-ce que la\nm\u00e9taphysique?\u201d\u2019 Bifur 8, 5\u20138 (p. 5)). 5. Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 263\nand described, but the respective causal explanations given for that\nexperience are dramatically different. In the first case, the cause is\nsupernatural; in the second case, it is natural. Indeed, for Heidegger,\nour affective experience of the a priori signals our deep epistemic\ndependency on a shared historical tradition, rather than our ability to\ntranscend tradition in an act of pure reason. This manifold tradition\nprovides the range of possibilities available to us for making sense of\nnature, for rendering it intelligible, and metaphysics, on Heidegger\u2019s\naccount, is a study of the conditions of historical possibility generated\nby and sustained within this tradition.\nDespite his enthusiasm for Heidegger\u2019s alleged metaphysical\n\u2018genius,\u2019 Koyr\u00e9 seems to have missed the fact that Heidegger\u2019s ambition\nwas to deconstruct, rather than to champion, Platonic rationalism. For\nKoyr\u00e9, the early-modern mathematisation of natural philosophy was\ninitiated by \u2018some of the greatest geniuses of mankind, a Galileo, a\nDescartes.\u201972 He argues that it was an act of \u2018pure unadulterated thought,\nand not experience or sense-perception [\u2026] that gives the basis for the\n\u201cnew science\u201d of Galileo.\u201973 Koyr\u00e9 thus identifies mathematics with\nmetaphysics, construed as Platonism, and hence describes Galileo\nunequivocally as a Platonist.74\nDuring the late Renaissance and early-modern periods, however,\nthere also existed a distinctly Aristotelian culture of mathematics.\nIndeed, when Randall writes that mathematics was the missing element\nin Zabarella\u2019s method, he had Aristotelian mathematics in mind.\n[W]ith rare exceptions the Italian mathematicians down through\nGalileo, when they possessed a philosophical interest at all, were not\nPlatonists but Aristotelians in their view of mathematics, of its relations\nto physics, and of the proper method of natural knowledge. [\u2026] What\nthey constructed as \u2018new sciences\u2019 it remained for Descartes to interpret\nin the light of the tradition of Augustinian Platonism.75\n72 K oyr\u00e9 (1943a), \u2018Galileo and Plato,\u2019 p. 405.\n73 K oyr\u00e9 (1943b), \u2018Galileo and the Scientific Revolution,\u2019 p. 346.\n74 K oyr\u00e9 (1943a), \u2018Galileo and Plato,\u2019 p. 425. In a comparison of Heidegger and Ernst\nCassirer, Michael Friedman notes that Cassirer influenced Koyr\u00e9\u2019s Platonic account\nof the Scientific Revolution (Michael Friedman (2000), A Parting of the Ways: Carnap,\nCassirer, and Heidegger (Chicago: Open Court), p. 88).\n75 R andall (1940), \u2018The Development of the Scientific Method,\u2019 p. 205. 264 Science as Social Existence\nIn Chapter Four, I recounted Heidegger\u2019s interpretation of Descartes\nas first modelling his conception of the subject on Aristotle\u2019s narrow\nconstrual of logos as proposition, but then decisively mathematicising that\nconstrual in order to establish the indubitable certainty of pure reason.\nWe may now more precisely specify Descartes\u2019s mathematicisation\nof the rules of reason as having been predominantly Platonist in its\nmotivation. By understanding those rules as being valid independently\nof experience, Descartes hoped to secure them as the absolute basis\nfor incontrovertible, universal knowledge. A Platonic interpretation\nof mathematical experience thus underwrote Descartes\u2019s rationalistic\nclaim to epistemic absolutism.\nThat Galileo was, in fact, more motivated by an Aristotelian\ninterpretation of mathematical experience is a point which has\nbeen recently pressed by Peter Dear: \u2018Galileo aimed at developing\nscientific knowledge [\u2026] according to the Aristotelian (Archimedean)\ndeductive formal structure of the mixed mathematical sciences.\u201976 These\nmathematical sciences were \u2018mixed,\u2019 rather than \u2018pure,\u2019 because they\nwere principally concerned with questions about the physical world\nrather than with abstract mathematical objects. The chief sixteenth-\ncentury examples of mixed mathematical science were astronomy and\noptics, the former calculating the positions and movements of celestial\nobjects and the later studying the behaviour of light rays construed in\ngeometrical terms. As Dear notes, sixteenth-century astronomical and\noptical practice also differed from the pure mathematical sciences of\ngeometry and arithmetic in that they made wide use of specialised\ninstruments, such as quadrants and astrolabes, in order to produce\nprecise empirical observations.77 Thus, according to Dear, they represent\nthe emergence of \u2018something resembling \u201cexperimental science.\u201d\u201978\nMixed mathematics was, furthermore, different from natural\nphilosophy in that the former sought to determine the quantitative\nproperties of things through acts of uniform measurement, while the\nlatter sought to determine what kinds of things they were, and hence\n76 P eter Dear (1995), Discipline & Experience: The Mathematical Way in the Scientific\nRevolution (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), pp. 125\u201326.\n77 P eter Dear (2006a), \u2018The Meanings of Experience,\u2019 in The Cambridge History of Science,\nvol. 3: Early Modern Science, ed. by Katharine Park and Lorraine Daston (Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press), pp. 106\u201331 (p. 119).\n78 D ear (2006a), \u2018The Meanings of Experience,\u2019 p. 119. 5. Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 265\nwhat their natural place was in a hierarchically ordered cosmos. To\ndetermine the natural kind of a thing is to determine the universal form\nwhich it instantiates. In Aristotelian terms, a thing\u2019s natural kind is thus\nalso its \u2018formal cause,\u2019 its \u2018what-it-is.\u2019 So, for example, the formal cause\nof a particular oak tree is the universal oak tree, what an oak tree is\nby nature, and by definition. Moreover, by subsisting in its nature, by\nbeing what it is, or the kind of thing it is, an oak tree assumes its proper\nplace within the cosmos. There is, then, a tight association between\nthe formal cause of a thing, on the one hand, and its natural place in a\nheterogeneous and hierarchically ordered cosmos, on the other. Natural\nphilosophers, by attending to formal causes, viewed themselves as the\nrightful surveyors of natural phenomena within this qualitatively and\nhence differentially ordered cosmos.\nDear observes that the main charge laid by Aristotelian natural\nphilosophers against mathematicians was that the latter did not provide\ncausal explanations of natural phenomena.79 Indeed, he describes\nthe explanations of mixed mathematicians as \u2018operational,\u2019 and he\ncontrasts these with the explanations proffered by Aristotelian natural\nphilosophers.80 Yet, as we can know see, this contrast should be more\nstrictly specified as one between operational explanations, on the one\nhand, and explanations in terms of formal causes, on the other. Indeed\noperational explanations are also, in a broad sense, causal explanations,\nand hence they were neither unknown nor unappreciated by\nAristotelian natural philosophers. Recall, for example, the fourteenth-\ncentury Paduan natural philosopher and physician Jacopo da Forl\u00ec\u2019s\ndescription of regressus in terms of the resolution of a general and\nconfused knowledge of fever into a specific and distinct knowledge\nof its causes, which will in turn lead back to a specific and distinct\nknowledge of the fever itself. Forl\u00ec\u2019s goal was to explain fever as being\ncaused by such physical operations as the heating of the humor, spirits,\nor members of the patient\u2019s body. The type of cause at play here is not\na formal cause but rather what Aristotle called an efficient cause, which\n79 D ear (2006a), \u2018The Meanings of Experience,\u2019 p. 120; Peter Dear (1995), Discipline &\nExperience: The Mathematical Way in the Scientific Revolution (Chicago: University of\nChicago Press), p. 36.\n80 Peter Dear (2006b), The Intelligibility of Nature: How Science Makes Sense of the World\n(Chicago: University of Chicago Press), p. 2. 266 Science as Social Existence\nis \u2018the primary source of change or rest.\u201981 Because Aristotle viewed\nchange as movement, the efficient cause is also sometimes called the\n\u2018moving cause.\u2019 Resolving the fever into its precise causes involved\ndiscriminating between probable and improbable efficient causes, for\nexample, between the heating of the spirits and the heating of the\nhumors as the most likely reason for the fever. As we saw, Agostino\nNifo later more precisely articulated Forl\u00ec\u2019s concept of resolution in his\nconcept of negotiatio, which Zabarella then called mental examination.\nThe regressus could thus involve negotiatio in the empirical determination\nof the efficient causes which produce change in natural bodies.\nDear seems to overlook this when he describes negotiatio as a\n\u2018mysterious process,\u2019 a \u2018form of contemplation\u2019 which presumes \u2018the\nmind\u2019s innate ability to grasp universals.\u201982 These universals were\napparently the essences, or formal causes, of the phenomena under\nstudy. According to Dear, regressus was a \u2018logical technique [\u2026]\ndesigned to generate true scientific knowledge, which for an Aristotelian\nhad to be certain knowledge.\u201983 The Paduan regressus theorists allegedly\nbelieved that negotiatio was a strictly logical practice which allowed the\ncontemplative mind to \u2018intuitively\u2019 grasp, as necessary, abstract and\nuniversal things, formal causes, which in turn were meant to correspond\nto something \u2018metaphysically real.\u201984 In short, according to Dear, the\nPaduan theorists were committed to a form of rationalism.\nAlthough this description may stick, in some degree, to Zabarella (who\nwas not a physician), it seems mistaken as a general characterisation of\nthe Paduan physicians. For them, regressus involved an empirical search\nfor the physical causes of illness. The heating of the humors of the body\nwas not understood to be an abstract, metaphysical phenomenon: it\nwas understood to be a physical operation which could be studied and,\nhopefully, physically manipulated so as to restore the patient to health.\nIn fact, the study of the efficient causes of disease appears to have been\n81 Aristotle (1941c), Physica, trans. by R.

Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 267\na common endeavour in late Renaissance medical practice. At the very\nleast, it managed to cross north over the Alps. Indeed, as Dear himself\nnotes, an operational emphasis on efficient causes also characterised the\nwork of the sixteenth-century Swiss physician Paracelsus and his many\nfollowers.85\nMoreover, as Randall makes clear, the Paduan method was not\ngenerally meant to produce rational certainty, least of all through\nacts of pure intellectual contemplation: \u2018at no time do the Paduan\nmedical Aristotelians attribute any such perceptive power to intellect.\u201986\nZabarella was not a medical Aristotelian, and so his case may have been\ndifferent. But consider Nifo\u2019s identification of regressus with \u2018physical\ndemonstrations,\u2019 and his claim that the empirical \u2018science of nature is\nnot a science simpliciter, like [pure] mathematics. Yet it is a science propter\nquid [i.e., demonstrative].\u201987 Nifo furthermore notes that Aristotle, in the\nMeteors, \u2018grants that he is not setting forth the true causes of natural\neffects, but only in so far as was possible for him, and in conjectural or\nhypothetical fashion.\u201988 Since even Aristotle himself admitted that the\nempirical study of nature may not yield certain knowledge, it is not\nsurprising that the medical Aristotelians of Padua demanded no more\nof their own method.\nDear seems to have exaggerated the epistemic difference between\nPaduan medical Aristotelians, on the one hand, and sixteenth-century\nAristotelian mixed mathematicians, on the other. In fact, both groups\nappear to have been involved in empirical studies of natural phenomena,\nand neither side made strong claims to the sort of epistemic certainty\ntypically attributed to the rationalistic demonstrations of logicians\nand pure mathematicians. Koyr\u00e9, in turn, appears to have more\nclearly recognised the empirical and conjectural nature of the Paduan\nregressus method, but he viewed this as an ailment in need of remedy\nthrough the metaphysical salve of Platonism.

Their interpretations thus move in opposite directions:\nKoyr\u00e9\u2019s away from empirical experience and deeper into metaphysics;\nDear\u2019s away from metaphysics and deeper into empirical experience.\nIn contrast to both of these interpretations, I want to suggest that the\nmovement in question was never a movement to or from experience.\nThe key point of contention here is the definition of metaphysics. Both\nKoyr\u00e9 and Dear understand metaphysics in the orthodox sense, as\nbeing opposed to empirical experience. On a Heideggerian reading,\nin contrast, metaphysics is bound together in a reciprocal relationship\nwith experience. The mathematical projection of nature \u2014 within which\nthings are experienced in terms of a single, basic measure \u2014 operates in\ncontinuous concert with the particular, concrete ways in which scientists\nwork with \u2014 and, above all, seek to take the measure of \u2014 those things.\nThe greater the number of natural phenomena which have been\nsuccessfully drawn into the realm of intelligibility circumscribed by\nthis basic measure, the more compelling the mathematical projection\nbecomes as the existential basis for knowing nature. In this way,\nby expanding the effective reach of a particular way of working\nwith nature, scientists progressively entrench in social practice the\nmetaphysical measure which guides and gives meaning to that work.\nThrough this work, the projected measure increasingly becomes that for\nthe sake of which scientific work is done. In other words, through this\nprocess, the things with which one works are progressively experienced\nin terms of their directedness towards this final measure. The things\nthus lend themselves more and more easily to an explanation in terms\nunderpinned by that measure, the final end in light of which scientific\npractice lets things be what we already know them to be, if only in a\ngeneral and indeterminate way.\nThis self-reinforcing reciprocal relation between metaphysical\nprojection and work experience would seem to confound the more\ncommon historiographic claim that the emergence of early-modern\nscience was the consequence of a historical swing either towards\nor away from either rationalism or empiricism. On a Heideggerian\naccount, early-modern science received its impulse not from one or the\nother, but instead from a transformation in the existential relationship\nbetween metaphysics and experience, between abstract understanding\nand concrete action, between theory and experimental practice. As we 5. Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 269\nwill see below, this transformation was, above all, a transformation\nin the role played by the notion of \u2018final cause\u2019 in the early-modern\npursuit of natural knowledge. The remainder of this chapter will thus\nconsider the relationship between the concrete practices characteristic\nof, but not limited to, the mixed mathematical arts, on the one hand,\nand the metaphysical notion of \u2018final cause,\u2019 on the other. A better\nunderstanding of this relationship will put solid ground under our feet\nwhen, in Chapter Six, we go on to develop a more detailed and concrete\nhistorical analysis of the transition from late Renaissance regressus to\nearly-modern math\u0113sis.\n6. Nature, Art, and Final Causes in\nEarly-Modern Natural Philosophy\nIt has become a historiographic commonplace that the emergence of\nearly-modern science was accompanied by the collapse of the so-called\nart-nature distinction. This distinction was allegedly a barrier to the free\napplication of the experiment in the investigation of nature. According\nto this widely received view, the key pillar upholding the art-nature\ndistinction was the Aristotelian concept of final cause. Hence, the\nbreakdown of this distinction entailed a rejection of final causes.\nIn this section, I will challenge this historiographic commonplace.\nIn doing so, I will begin to apply Heidegger\u2019s notion of math\u0113sis more\ndirectly to contemporary debates in the history of early-modern science,\nan application which will extend into Chapter Six. My main claim here\nwill be that no consequential breakdown in the art-nature distinction\nwas necessary for the emergence of early-modern science, because the\ndistinction, while important, was never as strict or inflexible as has\noften been suggested. As a consequence, there was no corresponding\nneed to eliminate final causes from explanations of experimentally\nproduced natural phenomena. Indeed, despite early-modern rhetoric\nto the contrary, the coherence and intelligibility of experimental\nmanipulations of nature required that a central role be given to final\ncauses. Without allowing room for final causes in explanations of the\nartful manipulation of nature, we will achieve an only partial, and\nperhaps not entirely coherent, understanding of early-modern scientific\npractice. As we will see, the claim that early-modern experimental 270 Science as Social Existence\noperations cannot be properly explained without reference to final\ncauses is a specific example of Heidegger\u2019s more general claim that\nearly-modern math\u0113sis was a matter, not just of working with the\nthings, but also of the metaphysical projection of the thingness of those\nthings. According to Heidegger, the ultimate end towards which the\nend-directedness of scientific things points, their final end, is a basic\nblueprint. This blueprint is, in Aristotelian terms, the final cause of\nthose things.\nIn the last section, I addressed Dear\u2019s distinction between operational\nand causal explanations, arguing that operational explanations, by\nmaking reference to how things happen, appeal to efficient causes, and\nthus are also causal explanations. But they are not causal explanations\nof the type most valued by sixteenth-century Aristotelian natural\nphilosophers: they are not explanations in terms of formal cause. These\nexplanations address a thing in terms of what it is, rather than of how it\nhappens. In other words, they explain it in terms of the kind of thing it\nis, in terms of the specific thingness manifested in the thing. For example,\na sixteenth-century explanation of fever in terms of the heating of the\nhumors specifies that the heating causes the fever, that this is how fever\nhappens. Yet, notice that it also says something about what fever is:\nnamely, that it is the kind of thing which occurs when the humors are\nheated. There is, then, an important connection between efficient and\nformal causes, because operational explanations in terms of the former\nimplicate a role for the latter.\nOnce fever has been defined in terms of the processes by which it\noccurs, it becomes possible, at least in principle, to treat it by intervening\nin those processes. On the medieval definition, one could mitigate\na fever by artificially cooling the patient\u2019s humors: for example, by\nimmersing her in a basin of cool water. Such an intervention may help\nto return the patient to a natural state of health. This is an important\npoint. Recall that, for Aristotle, change is a kind of movement. Medical\ninterventions, as the efficient causes of health, may also be called the\nmoving causes of health, because to restore a patient\u2019s health means to\nmove her back into a natural state. Aristotle wrote that \u2018the movement\nof each body to its own place is motion towards its form.\u201989 We saw in\n89 Aristotle (1941d), On the Heavens, trans. by J. L. Stocks, in The Basic Works of Aristotle,\ned. by Richard KcKeon (New York: Random House), pp. 398\u2013466 (p. 459 [lines\n310a34\u201335]). 5. Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 271\nthe last section that a thing, by being what it is, instantiates its form. In\nso doing, it takes its proper place in the cosmos. We can now add that a\nthing, by becoming what it is, moves towards its form, and, in so doing,\nalso moves to its proper place \u2014 or what we may be more inclined to\ncall its proper state \u2014 in the cosmos. The physician directly intervenes\nin the operations of the patient\u2019s body \u2014 operates on her \u2014 in order\nto bring her back into proper form, good shape, a natural state of\nhealth. Health is thus that for the sake of which the physician performs\nthe operations, and those operations are likewise performed in order to\nrestore the patient\u2019s health.\nIn their respective accounts of the Scientific Revolution, both Dear\nand SSK practitioner Steven Shapin observe that \u2018that for-the-sake-of-\nwhich\u2019 an operation occurs was known to Aristotelians as the \u2018final\ncause.\u201990 Dear furthermore recognises a distinction between the formal\ncause of a thing, the kind of thing it is, on the one hand, and its final\ncause, on the other. The motivation for this distinction, he writes, \u2018was\nto understand in the most fundamental way what things were and why\nthey behaved as they did.\u201991 Yet, while Aristotle did distinguish in this\nway between formal and final causes, he also argued that the two are\noften identical, and, furthermore, that they coincide with the efficient,\nor moving, cause: \u2018the \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201cthat for the sake of which\u201d are one,\nwhile the primary source of motion is the same in species as these.\u201992\nFor example, the process of growth initiated in an acorn can\nbe explained only in light of the end, or final cause, of that process:\nnamely, a mature oak tree. The final cause explains why an acorn grows\ninto an oak tree rather than into an artichoke. Similarly, according to\nAristotle, it explains why \u2018the healable, when moved and changed qua\nhealable, attains health and not whiteness.\u201993 A movement towards\nform has a directedness, a regularity, which distinguishes it from\nchance occurrence, and this regularity of movement is what a reference\nto final causes is meant to explain. Final causes explain why something\nbecomes what it is: why an acorn becomes an oak tree. They thus serve\n90 Steven Shapin (1996), The Scientific Revolution (Chicago: University of Chicago\nPress), p. 139; Dear (2001), Revolutionizing the Sciences, p. 13.\n91 Dear (2001), Revolutionizing the Sciences, p. 14.\n92 Aristotle (1941c), Physica, trans. by R.

Formal\ncauses, in contrast, explain what something is. Their focus is on being,\nrather than on becoming. What an oak tree is can be explained without\nreference to the generative movements which brought the oak tree into\nbeing. Final and formal causes can thus be viewed as different modes of\nexplanation with respect to the same thing. This is a difference between\na directed process and its natural outcome, between a thing\u2019s regulated\nactualisation and its resultant actuality. In the case of the oak tree, the\noperation is internal: oak trees reproduce themselves through acorns.\nHere, the formal and final causes are similarly located in the oak tree.\nThey are equally situated in the very thing about which they are meant\nto provide an explanation.\nAccordingly, Andrea Falcon has argued that, for the Aristotelian\nstudent of nature, formal and final causes were often not distinguishable\nin practice.94 Indeed, Aristotle reiterates this point in On the Generation\nof Animals: \u2018first, the final cause, that for the sake of which a thing exists;\nsecondly, the formal cause, the definition of its essence (and these two\nwe may regard pretty much as one and the same).\u201995 Aristotelian natural\nphilosophers could thus be justified in speaking not of two distinct\ncauses but of only one single \u2018formal/final\u2019 cause.\nCrucially, the same cannot be said of Aristotelian students of art. For\nthem, formal and final causes are separated because, in art, the source\nof movement lies outside the moving body, the emergent work of art.\nAs Aristotle wrote: \u2018[A]rt is a principle of movement in something other\nthan the thing moved, nature is a principle in the thing itself.\u201996 Hence,\nwhen the physician immerses a feverish patient in a basin of cool water,\nthe source of the movement meant to restore the patient to health lies,\nat least in significant part, outside the patient, in the physician, or, more\naccurately, in the medical art of the physician. Furthermore, as noted\n94 Andrea Falcon (2015), \u2018Aristotle on Causality,\u2019 in The Stanford Encyclopedia of\nPhilosophy, ed. by Edward N. Zalta (Spring 2015 Edition), \u00a73.\n95 Aristotle (1941e), On the Generation of Animals, trans. by Arthur Platt, in The Basic\nWorks of Aristotle, ed. by Richard KcKeon (New York: Random House), pp. 665\u201380\n(p. 665 [lines 715a4\u20137]).\n96 Aristotle (1941f), Metaphysics, trans. by W. D. Ross, in The Basic Works of Aristotle,\ned. by Richard KcKeon (New York: Random House), pp. 689\u2013926 (p. 874 [lines\n1070a7\u201310]). 5. Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 273\nabove, medical art is not a random activity, but an activity directed\ntoward a specific end, namely, health. The physician is the site of\nboth the activity (efficient cause) and the principle (final cause) which\norganises and gives an overall meaning to that activity. The patient, on\nthe other hand, is both the object of treatment (material cause) and the\nsite of health (formal cause) to which the physician endeavours to return\nthat body. In contrast to generation in nature, the formal cause \u2014 the\n\u2018what\u2019 \u2014 and the final cause \u2014 \u2018that for the sake of which\u2019 \u2014 are not\nunited in art, because they each exist in a different location. Yet, in\nthe medical arts, there are exceptions to this general rule, and such\ncases serve to weaken the distinction between nature and art. Hence,\nAristotle writes that \u2018a doctor doctoring himself: nature is like that.\u201997\nOr, to take another example, one walks about \u2018in order to be healthy.\u201998\nJust as with the oak tree, in this case the respective locations of the final\nand formal causes are now the same, and so the two causes become\nindistinguishable in practical terms. In addition, the efficient cause is\nnow located, as with the oak tree, in the body being moved: the patient\nis also the agent, a self-mover.\nOne may object that, even when there is no necessary difference\nbetween nature and art with respect to location of causes, an important\ndistinction may still be made by pointing to the deliberative character\nof artful movement in contrast to natural movement. According to this\nargument, the doctor deliberately sets out to doctor herself, while the\noak tree reproduces itself automatically, that is, without deliberation.\nBut Aristotle challenged this distinction as well. He observes that\n\u2018art does not deliberate.\u2019 Hence, \u2018[i]f the ship-building art were in the\nwood, it would produce the same results by nature.\u201999 Self-awareness\nthus seems to play no necessary role in Aristotle\u2019s conception of art. For\nhim, the regulative movements of art can be just as non-deliberative as\nthose of nature. This recalls Heidegger\u2019s own observations, discussed\nin Chapter Four, about the non-deliberative character of our actions\nwhen we are immersed in a work-world. The master fiddler does not\n97 Aristotle (1941c), Physica, p. 874 (line 199b30).\n98 Aristotle, Physica, lines 194b34; trans. by R.

She\njust fiddles. Hence, if the art of fiddling were instead located in the\nfiddle, the fiddle would play itself, in just the same way an oak tree\nreproduces itself through an acorn: namely, non-deliberatively, without\nself-awareness, but nevertheless with a directedness which serves to\norganise the corresponding operations. In fact, Heidegger recognises in\nAristotle a distinction between the \u2018end\u2019 (telos) towards which a thing is\ndirected, on the one hand, and the \u2018goal\u2019 or \u2018purpose\u2019 of that thing, on\nthe other. On this basis, Heidegger concludes that for Aristotle: \u2018telos is\nnot \u201cgoal\u201d or \u201cpurpose,\u201d but \u201cend.\u201d\u2019 One may attribute to a thing the\ncause of its own activity without also attributing to it self-awareness or\nconsciousness.100 For both Heidegger and Aristotle, the end-directedness\nof both natural and artful movement may be explained without recourse\nto the intellectualist concepts of \u2018goal\u2019 and \u2018purpose.\u2019\nIn addition to their shared interest in non-deliberative practice,\nthere is another important parallel between Heidegger\u2019s work and\nAristotelian natural philosophy. Readers will have already noticed\nthat Heidegger, like Aristotle, uses a concept of the \u2018for-the-sake-of-\nwhich.\u2019 Indeed, Aristotle\u2019s observation that health is that for the sake of\nwhich one walks about, and that one walks about in order to maintain\none\u2019s health, recalls Heidegger\u2019s own close association between the\nconcepts \u2018for-the-sake-of-which\u2019 and \u2018in-order-to.\u2019 As we saw above,\nand more fully in Chapter Four, Heidegger links these two concepts\nin his discussion of equipment, or ready-to-hand things, that is, things\nas we experience them in use. We use a pen, for example, in order to\nmake marks on a page, so as to communicate. The use of the pen is an\nin-order-to of graphic communication. Yet such communication is more\nthan just mark-making. The marks on the page must be shaped and\norganised such that they convey a meaning. Only then will they count\nas communication. Graphic communication is thus that for the sake\nof which one uses the pen.

Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 275\nsuch communication can we use the pen in order to convey a meaning.\nHence, Heidegger writes that \u2018[o]nly so far as the for-the-sake-of a\ncan-be is understood can something like an in-order-to (a relation of\nassignedness) be unveiled.\u2019101 This understanding of the for-the-sake-\nof-which \u2014 of the final cause \u2014 allows for a \u2018projection [\u2026] in whose\nluminosity things of the nature of equipment are encountered.\u2019102 In\npartly more Aristotelian terms, an understanding of the final cause of a\nthing opens up (\u2018projects\u2019) a space of intelligibility in which the formal\ncause, or whatness, of the thing may be realised through the efficient\ncause, or operations, by which that thing comes to be experienced as\nwhat it is. So, the understanding, or the art, of graphic communication\ninforms one about what kinds of marks will contribute to meaning,\nand hence also about how the pen is to be used in order to produce\nthose kinds of marks. As a consequence, an understanding of the final\ncause, whether deliberative or non-deliberative, marks the difference\nbetween random, meaningless behaviour and results, on the one\nhand, and organised, meaningful practices and products, on the other.\nHeidegger\u2019s concept of understanding thus plays much the same role as\nAristotle\u2019s concept of art with respect to production: both are directed\ntowards the for-the-sake-of-which, towards the final cause or end.\nSuch understanding brings with it rules for regulating our behaviour\nin a sensible way, for successfully choosing between cognitively good\nand cognitively bad courses of action in order to produce meaningful\nresults. It explains, for example, why a carpenter qua carpenter produces\ncabinets rather than crockery.\nIt is worth reiterating that the rules or instructions originating in the\nfor-the-sake-of-which need not be articulated, much less formalised, in\norder to perform their regulative function: they can be non-deliberative,\nunreflective, or tacit. They do not entail the self-awareness of the\nmoving, or efficient, cause. On this point, Aristotle and Heidegger agree,\nbut Aristotle goes further by applying the idea, not just to art, but also\nto self-generation in nature. This returns us to the issue of intentionality\nand naturalised epistemology, addressed at the end of Chapter Four.\nWe saw there that Bloor\u2019s call for a naturalised account of scientific\nreasoning need not entail the naturalistic reduction of intentional states to\n101 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 295; translation modified.\n102 Heidegger (1982a), Basic Problems of Phenomenology, p. 293. 276 Science as Social Existence\nnon-intentional states. For such a reduction presupposes that intentional\nstates necessarily include propositional content. Yet Heidegger\nrejects this presupposition, arguing that intentional actions \u2014 actions\nexhibiting a directedness \u2014 can also be non-propositional in character.\nThis underpins the present claim that intentional states may be non-\ndeliberative. Intentional acts are not necessarily conscious phenomena,\nand so intentional activity may be ascribed to something without\nsupposing that thing to possess a consciousness. When Aristotle argues\nthat nature displays intention through the directedness of its activities,\nbut that it does not deliberate, he would appear to espouse an account\nof natural intention which does not presuppose a sentient nature. In\nAristotle, natural things move themselves to their proper place in an\nordered cosmos, but, like the master fiddler, they do not have to think\nabout doing so \u2014 they just do it. Aristotle appears to have imagined\nnature as a master artist, unreflectively performing itself.\nIt is this \u2018performance\u2019 which Aristotelian natural philosophers\ntook as their object of study. By cataloguing the final/formal causes\nwhich govern the self-movement of nature, they hoped to achieve\na dense and precise understanding of the ordered cosmos. If each\nthing moves naturally to form, to its own proper place in the cosmos,\nthen a catalogue of these various forms would also provide a kind\nof conceptual map of the heterogeneous and hierarchically ordered\nplaces which constitute the qualitatively complex structure of the\nworld. In the most abstract of terms, this conceptual map was meant\nto articulate in clear and explicit terms the implicit role played by final\ncausation in regulating natural operations in the world. It may thus be\nviewed as a kind of cosmic operations manual, with the proviso that\nthe original operator, just like the master artist, has no need for such a\nmanual. Indeed, the master artist is likely to find a manual purporting\nto explicate her practice as, at best, an over-simplification of what\nshe actually does. On the other hand, she may also find it difficult\nto articulate, in clear and determinate propositional terms, what she\nfinds evident in her art but lacking in the manual.\nThese considerations should now make us wary about the oft-\nmade claim that early-modern practitioners can be distinguished by\ntheir rejection of the Aristotelian distinction between art and nature.\nHistoriographically, this distinction has often been viewed as an 5. Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 277\nobstacle to the rise of the mechanical philosophy on which the new\nexperimental practice is thought to have been based. Shapin writes that\n\u2018the precondition for the intelligibility and the practical possibility of\na mechanical philosophy of nature was setting aside that Aristotelian\ndistinction.\u2019103 Dear, who, as we have seen, emphasises the importance\nof mixed mathematics in the development of experimental practice,\nargues that \u2018[t]he art-nature distinction impinged on the use of\nartificial contrivance in the making of natural knowledge \u2014 that is, it\ncompromised the legitimacy of using in natural philosophy the sorts\nof procedures used by mathematicians.\u2019104 Like Shapin, Dear suggests\nthat \u2018[t]he widespread adoption of various forms of \u201cmechanical\nphilosophy\u201d went along with a drastic weakening of the art-nature\ndistinction in philosophical thought,\u2019 and he then adds that this\n\u2018provided ontological vindication of the primacy of the mathematical\nsciences.\u2019105 It is a historiographic commonplace that early-modern\nexperimental philosophy was enabled by the rising fortunes of the\nmechanical philosophy. However, Shapin and Dear also maintain that\nthe Aristotelian distinction between art and nature was a central barrier\nto the rise of the new experimentalism. I think that we should not accept\nthis claim. Let me explain my disagreement by addressing Dear\u2019s more\ndetailed argument.\nOn closer inspection, it appears that the true barrier to experimental\npractice was, according to Dear, Aristotelian final causes: \u2018[t]o the extent\nthat Aristotle\u2019s natural philosophy sought the final causes of things, and\nthereby to determine their natures, experimental science was therefore\ndisallowed.\u2019106 At the root of the rejection of the art-nature distinction\nwas, therefore, the rejection of final causes. This would seem to make\nsense since, as we have seen, Aristotle distinguished art and nature\nby the location of their respective final and efficient causes. For the\nthings of nature, the principle of their movement is internal, while for\nthe things of art, the principle of their movement is external. However,\n103 Shapin (1996), The Scientific Revolution, p. 31.\n104 Dear (1995), Discipline & Experience, p. 153.\n105 Dear (1995), Discipline & Experience, p. 151.\n106 Dear (2006a), \u2018The Meanings of Experience,\u2019 in The Cambridge History of Science, vol.\n3: Early Modern Science, ed. by Katharine Park and Lorraine Daston (Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press), pp. 106\u201331 (p. 110). 278 Science as Social Existence\nfor Aristotle this distinction was not, as Dear suggests, an \u2018absolute\nseparation.\u2019107 Indeed, recall Aristotle\u2019s argument that nature is like\na doctor doctoring herself. Hence, in some special cases, art moves\nits object internally, and these special cases provided Aristotle with\nan analogical model for his account of natural generation. There was,\nfor him, no absolute distinction to be drawn between art and nature,\nbecause he understood natural processes, in general, by analogy to\nspecial cases of artistic process.\nYet, Dear argues that natural and artificial causes were considered\ndistinct because the regularity of natural processes could be \u2018subverted\u2019\nby artificial causes.108 For example, \u2018[a]n aqueduct [\u2026] is not a natural\nwatercourse; it reveals the intention of its human producer, which\nthwarts that of nature.\u2019109 But this example can also speak for an affinity\nbetween art and nature. From an Aristotelian perspective, the natural\ntendency of liquid water is to move as close as possible to the centre of\nthe earth. The aqueduct does not thwart or subvert this tendency, but\nis entirely dependent on it for the successful delivery of water. The\nfinal cause which gives sense to the operations of the aqueduct is thus\ncompatible with the final cause which gives sense to the operations\nof the natural watercourse: both facilitate the movement of liquid\nwater to its proper place in the cosmos. This is not to say that artifice\ncannot be used to subvert the natural tendencies of things, but only\nthat this possibility does not warrant an absolute separation of art and\nnature. Indeed, Aristotle wrote that \u2018if things made by nature were\nmade also by art, they would come to be in the same way as by nature.\n[\u2026] [G]enerally art partly completes what nature cannot bring to a\nfinish, and partly imitates her.\u2019110 In general, then, Aristotle viewed the\nrespective operations of art and nature as complementary rather than\nas contradictory.\nThis point is emphasised in Dear\u2019s description of the early-modern\nexperiment as \u2018mimetic, not semiotic.\u2019111 The artifice of experiment\n107 Dear (1995), Discipline & Experience, p. 155.\n108 Dear (1995), Discipline & Experience, p. 155.\n109 Dear (1995), Discipline & Experience, p. 155. Elsewhere, Dear assimilates \u2018contrived\nsituations\u2019 to \u2018interference\u2019 with natural processes in the natural philosophical\ncontext (Peter Dear (1990), \u2018Miracles, Experiments, and the Ordinary Course of\nNature,\u2019 Isis 81(4), 663\u201383 (p. 681)).\n110 Aristotle (1941c), Physica, p. 250 (lines 199a14\u201317).\n111 Dear (1995), Discipline & Experience, p. 159. 5. Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 279\nimitates nature, rather than signifying it. According to Dear, mimesis\nis a primary characteristic of experimental manipulation.112 The\nexperimental philosopher reproduces, or mimics, natural processes\nusing artificial means, with the goal of generating new knowledge of\nnature, \u2018especially knowledge of an operational kind.\u2019113 Historically,\nthis move involved what Dear describes as \u2018[a] subtle redefinition of\nnatural knowledge \u2014 and thus of nature itself.\u2019114 He refers to the 1647\nbook, Discours du vuide, by the French physician and college teacher\nPierre Guiffart, as evidence for this subtle redefinition. Dear cites\nGuiffart as stating:\nThere is a very notable difference between art and nature: art cannot\nproduce anything without nature; it not only needs nature to furnish the\nmaterial, but it also needs nature\u2019s natural inclinations to go along with\nit, so that thereby it supplements nature\u2019s rules and produces its own\nwork.115\nThe subtle redefinition alleged to appear in this passage is that\n\u2018[k]nowledge of nature, rather than being about identifying purposes\n[i.e., final causes], is now, insensibly, becoming about characterising\n\u201crules\u201d [\u2026] of nature.\u2019116 On the basis of this perceived distinction\nbetween final causes, on the one hand, and rules, on the other, Dear\ndraws a further distinction between the \u2018teleological\u2019 explanations of\nAristotelian natural philosophers and the \u2018operational\u2019 explanations of\nmixed mathematicians and the experimental philosophers inspired by\nthem.117\nThis recalls Dear\u2019s distinction between the operational explanations\nof mixed mathematicians, on the one hand, and explanations based on\nformal causes, as proffered by Aristotelian natural philosophers, on the\nother. In response to this, I argued, first, that operational explanations\nare also causal explanations because they refer both to efficient causes\nand, at least tacitly, to final causes, and, second, that final causes and\nformal causes are, in the realm of Aristotelian natural philosophy,\neffectively identical. It follows from this that Dear\u2019s distinction between\n112 Dear (1995), Discipline & Experience, p. 159.\n113 Dear (1995), Discipline & Experience, p. 159.\n114 Dear (1995), Discipline & Experience, p. 157.\n115 Dear (1995), Discipline & Experience, p. 157.\n116 Dear (1995), Discipline & Experience, p. 157.\n117 Dear (1995), Discipline & Experience, p. 158. 280 Science as Social Existence\noperational and teleological explanations should be regarded with\nsome scepticism. As we have seen, explanations in terms of final causes\ncan be viewed as explanations in terms of the rules which give meaning\nand direction to natural processes: they explain, for example, why an\nacorn grows into an oak tree rather than into an artichoke. The same\npoint is implied in the passage from Guiffart. He argues that art relies\non the support of natural inclinations so that it may act to supplement\nnature\u2019s rule-governed activity. Yet natural inclinations seem just\nto be the natural tendencies definitive of final causes. Following\nits natural tendency, an acorn develops into an oak tree. Hence, as\nGuiffart suggests, because it relies on the natural tendencies of natural\nmaterials, art ends up supplementing, rather than violating, nature\u2019s\nrules. Natural inclinations are here conceptualised as inclinations to\nfollow the rules governing natural movement. The crucial point to\nbe emphasised, then, is that a focus on the rules governing natural\nprocesses is simultaneously a focus not just on material causes, but also\non final causes, and so it cannot be read as a rejection of the art-nature\ndistinction. Hence Guiffart\u2019s ability to faultlessly refer to nature\u2019s rules\nwhile still asserting a notable difference between art and nature. For Dear,\nGuiffart\u2019s affirmation of the art-nature distinction must be dismissed as\n\u2018lip service,\u2019 because Dear has put himself in an interpretative position\nwhere rule-based operational explanations of nature are incompatible\nwith the Aristotelian doctrine of final cause allegedly underpinning a\ndistinction between artificial and natural processes.118\nDear emphasises \u2018manipulation\u2019 as a key element in his explanation\nfor the transition from late Renaissance natural philosophy to early-\nmodern experimental philosophy, or what I have called the transition\nfrom regressus to math\u0113sis. The notion of artful manipulation was, he\nargues, a \u2018Trojan horse\u2019 by which the art-nature distinction could be\ncircumvented, thereby allowing the applied techniques of mixed\nmathematicians to flood into early-modern natural philosophy.119\nIn response to Dear\u2019s hypothesis, I have sought, in this section, to\ndemonstrate two things. First, I have argued that the claim that early-\nmodern experimental philosophy subverted the art-nature distinction\nshould be treated with some scepticism. I have suggested that this\n118 Dear (1995), Discipline & Experience, p. 161.\n119 Dear (1995), Discipline & Experience, p. 161. 5. Math\u0113sis and the Emergence of Early-Modern Science 281\ndistinction was not, per se, an obstacle for experimental practice, because\nartful manipulation had always been viewed as potentially compatible\nwith natural processes. Second, I have argued that manipulation alone\ndoes not sufficiently explain the early-modern mathematisation of\nnatural knowledge. Indeed, attention to manipulation alone explains\nvery little. One must also attend to the governing principles which lend\norder and meaning to those manipulations, which explain to what end\nthose manipulations are directed and for what end they are performed.\nPut otherwise, efficient causes must be married to final causes if we are to\nshed adequate explanatory light on the rule-governed dynamics which\nwe observe in the worlds of both nature and art. Coherent operational\nexplanations presuppose that for the sake of which those operations\noccur, because, without this presupposition, those operations would\nnot be intelligible as anything more than random activity.\n7. Conclusion\nTongue planted firmly in cheek, Shapin begins his 1996 book, The\nScientific Revolution, with the following declaration: \u2018There was no such\nthing as the Scientific Revolution, and this is a book about it.\u2019120 Indeed,\nalthough historians of science have, in recent years, become increasingly\ncircumspect about the notion of a Scientific Revolution, few have been\nwilling to abandon it entirely. In particular, the idea that early-modern\nscience was inaugurated by a sudden, radical, and complete \u2014 in\nshort, a revolutionary \u2014 epistemic break with the past has been largely\nabandoned by historians, with the historiographic emphasis shifting to\nmore nuanced considerations of both the continuities and discontinuities\nwhich exist between early-modern science and its predecessors.\nThe Heideggerian account of the Scientific Revolution which I have\nbegun to outline in this chapter shares this circumspective stance.\nRecall that my explication of Heidegger\u2019s account of modern science\nas math\u0113sis began with Heidegger\u2019s insistence that facts, measurement,\nand experiment, broadly construed, figure as continuous threads\nrunning from modern science all the way back through medieval\nto ancient science. Moreover, according to Heidegger, the Scientific\nRevolution was sparked not by the rejection of tradition, but instead by\n120 Shapin (1996), The Scientific Revolution, p. 1. 282 Science as Social Existence\nthe consolidation of an existential possibility which had, until that time,\nlain relatively dormant within that tradition. In this way, Heidegger\u2019s\nuse of the term \u2018revolution\u2019 [Umw\u00e4lzung] harkens back to an older\nmeaning of that term: not a sudden and radical break with the past, but\ninstead a transformative, as opposed to an atavistic, return to it.\nThe extent to which Heidegger viewed the Scientific Revolution\nas powerfully tied to the past is clearly evinced by his claim that the\nAristotelian concept of final cause was not, after all, abandoned by early-\nmodern scientific practitioners. In this, as we have seen, Heidegger\nargues for greater historical continuity than do both Dear and Shapin.\nYet, this concept was retained only to then undergo transformation\nin a way which profoundly altered the extant practices of fact-stating,\nmeasuring, and experimenting. Heidegger identified this transformation\nwith the mathematisation of scientific knowledge. At its root, this\nmathematisation had to do, not with numerical practice, but with the\ndevelopment of a uniform measure, a basic blueprint, circumscribing\nthe thingness of scientific things. It was the mathematisation of final\ncauses, rather than their rejection, which allowed physical apparatus\nto flood into the knowledge-making practices of early-modern natural\nphilosophy. It was how these apparatuses were used, and the end to\nwhich they were put, which mark a decisive transformation in the\nmeaning of those practices. Furthermore, it was the concentration of\nscientific experience under a uniform measure which allowed numerical\npractice to likewise flood into, and give new form to, the early-modern\nnatural philosophical experience of nature. Hence, Heidegger\u2019s account\nof science as math\u0113sis may be read as charting a neutral course between\ntwo competing historiographic schools, each of which favours an\nexplanation of the Scientific Revolution in terms of either the rise of\nexperimental or mathematico-numerical practice. His account is meant\nto illuminate the common soil in which these two aspects of modern\nscience are rooted, and from which they both sprang. It thus allows us\nan opportunity to reconnect recent historical studies of early-modern\nexperimental philosophy with the theory-oriented studies which have\ntypically been the brief of historians more concerned with early-modern\nmathematical practice. Chapter Six will give concrete, micro-historical\nattention to the ways in which the mathematicisation of final causes\ntransformed the fortunes of early-modern experimental practice. Chapter Six\nMathematics, Experiment, and the\nEnds of Scientific Practice\n1. Introduction\nIn Chapter Five, we familiarised ourselves with Heidegger\u2019s concept\nof math\u0113sis. This concept lies at the heart of his attempt to understand\nthe emergence of early-modern science in terms of mathematisation.\nIn particular, math\u0113sis \u2014 as a kind of learning or studying wherein we\nlearn what we, in a general and indeterminate way, already know \u2014 is\nmeant to capture the mathematisation of the pre-modern Aristotelian\nnotion of final cause. As we saw, Heidegger grounds his analysis in\nour experience of the thing as ready-to-hand within a work-world, that\nis, as something with which we are at work. According to Heidegger,\nsuch a thing has an end-directedness. When we work with (rather than\nagainst) it, we let it be what it is in its directedness towards some end;\nwe let it, so far as is possible, fulfill that end.\nI suggested that this end is the final cause of the thing, that for the\nsake of which we let the thing, in the course of working with it, be what\nit is. Heidegger argues that, in the case of early-modern scientific work,\nthe end of the thing is a ground plan, a basic blueprint. As the final\ncause of the thing, this basic blueprint provides the measure against\nwhich our work with the thing makes sense. It guides our judgement\n\u00a9 Jeff Kochan, CC BY 4.0 http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0129.06 284 Science as Social Existence\nabout what is, and what is not, relevant as we work with the thing, and\nthus also our basic understanding of the thingness of the thing.\nAccording to Heidegger, the measure given by the ground plan\napplies to the scientific thing as such. All potential scientific things will\nbe circumscribed within the experiential realm laid out according to\nthis measure. This circumscription forms the basis of mathematisation.\nThe totality of end-directednesses within this realm \u2014 and thus also the\nends of the corresponding scientific practices \u2014 becomes consolidated\nunder one uniform measure \u2014 a single, final end. Hence, the scientific\nthing is what it is insofar as it conforms to this measure. This conformity\nis not, however, a strict determination. Recall that those things which the\nground plan renders knowable are initially known in an only general\nand indeterminate way. Through math\u0113sis, this knowledge may then\nbe developed into something more specific and determinate, and this\ndetermination may take a number of different shapes. All of these shapes\nwill, however, still share the same general form. For example, individual\nplants and animals may refer to two different categories \u2014 the plant-\nlike and the animal-like \u2014 but those two categories, in turn, refer to a\nsingle, more general category \u2014 the thing-like. Similarly, we may refer\nto things either in quantitative or operational terms, but we must first be\nable to refer to them as things. Hence, even though all scientific things\nconform to the same general measure, they are nevertheless amenable\nto specification and determination in a variety of different ways.\nAs a consequence, math\u0113sis, as the mathematical projection of the\nthingness of things, as a basic projective structure in the subjectivity of the\nsubject, served to facilitate the influx of both numerical and instrumental\npractices into early-modern natural philosophy. By allowing for the\nconsolidation of all potentially scientific things under one general\nmeasure, math\u0113sis expanded the range of application for concrete\nmathematical techniques. If a thing could be drawn within the scope of\nscientific experience, then one could also quantify it. Math\u0113sis likewise\nenabled and expanded the range of application for concrete instrumental\ntechniques. Hence, scientific things came to be increasingly viewed as\na legitimate subject matter for artful manipulation. Quantification and\nmanipulation are thus two different possibilities for specifying the\nuniform thingness of the scientific thing. Thus, as was claimed at the\nclose of Chapter Five, Heidegger\u2019s introduction of math\u0113sis, as a central 6. Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 285\nand collective existential impulse behind the rise of early-modern\nscience, charts a middle course between the historiographic Scylla and\nCharybdis of mathematics and experiment.\nThis is not so much a rejection as it is a resolution of the historical\ndifference between what Thomas Kuhn identified as mathematical\nand experimental traditions in the physical sciences.1 Each tradition\nrepresents a different way of specifying and determining the same\ngeneral and indeterminate knowledge of things. Kuhn\u2019s traditions may\nthus be better described as sub-traditions within a broader tradition in\nwhich scientific thinking is guided by a uniform measure against which\nscientific things are experienced as intelligible. The shared root of these\ntwo traditions in mathematical projection furthermore helps to explain\nwhy these two traditions could eventually come together, especially, as\nKuhn observes, in the case of nineteenth-century physics.2 Like the hills\non either side of a valley, a bridge can be built to join them. However,\nHeidegger\u2019s account reminds us that, despite the distance between\nthem, each hill nevertheless forms one side of the same valley.\nPeter Dear also challenges Kuhn\u2019s distinction between mathematical\nand experimental practices, arguing for an \u2018intimate relationship\u2019\nbetween the two, manifested most spectacularly in the late-seventeenth-\ncentury mathematico-experimental work of Isaac Newton.3 Yet, as we\nsaw in Chapter Five, Dear locates the heart of experimental practice\nnot, as Kuhn did, in the tradition represented by Robert Boyle\u2019s mid-\nseventeenth-century experimental philosophy and the Royal Society\nof London (of which Boyle and then Newton served as President), but\ninstead in the physical apparatuses and artful manipulations of the\nAristotelian tradition of mixed mathematics. Indeed, Dear argues that\n\u2018Boylean experimental philosophy was not the high road to modern\nexperimentation; it was a detour.\u20194 Since Kuhn\u2019s experimental tradition\nwas precisely the Boylean one, it would seem that Dear has not really,\n1 Thomas Kuhn (1977), \u2018Mathematical versus Experimental Traditions in the\nDevelopment of Physical Science,\u2019 in The Essential Tension: Selected Studies in\nScientific Tradition and Change, by Thomas Kuhn (Chicago: University of Chicago\nPress), pp. 31\u201365.\n2 Kuhn (1977), \u2018Mathematical versus Experimental Traditions,\u2019 p. 63.\n3 P eter Dear (1995), Discipline & Experience: The Mathematical Way in the Scientific\nRevolution (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), p. 246.\n4 Dear (1995), Discipline & Experience, p. 2. 286 Science as Social Existence\nafter all, discovered an intimate relationship between the two sides of\nKuhn\u2019s distinction.\nSteven Shapin, in contrast, preserves Kuhn\u2019s distinction, and\nemphasises the importance of Boyle\u2019s experimental philosophy\nas a forebear of the Newtonian programme.5 In fact, Shapin even\nstrengthens Kuhn\u2019s distinction by carefully outlining Boyle\u2019s resolve in\ninsulating experimental philosophy from techniques of mathematical\ndemonstration. According to Shapin, Newton would later both adopt\nBoylean experimental practice and marry it to those same mathematical\ntechniques.6 Yet, as we will see later in this chapter, although Boyle\neschewed mathematical forms of persuasion, his experimental\nphilosophy was not incompatible with math\u0113sis. Indeed, I will argue\nthat Boylean experimental philosophy was, in the Heideggerian sense,\nstrongly mathematical. Although Boyle rejected the concrete techniques\nof specification typical of mathematical practice, his understanding of\nthe thingness of scientific things was nevertheless guided by a uniform\nmeasure. This uniform measure influenced, in turn, the way Boyle\nworked with, or manipulated, those things.\nShapin notes that Boyle\u2019s suspicion of mathematics included the\nrejection of an \u2018ontology\u2019 contending that \u2018physical qualities were\nuniform.\u20197 Instead, Boyle allowed that \u2018substances like air and water\nvaried in their physical properties from one locale to another and from\none time to another.\u20198 In other words, Boyle rejected an ontology which\ninsisted that the properties of token instances of the same type always be\nspecified in the same way. But Boyle\u2019s tolerance of context-dependency\nin the specification of physical properties is compatible with my claim\nthat he was a mathematical philosopher in the Heideggerian sense.\n5 S teven Shapin (1988), \u2018Robert Boyle and Mathematics: Reality, Representation,\nand Experimental Practice,\u2019 Science in Context 2(1), 23\u201358; Steven Shapin (1994), A\nSocial History of Truth: Civility and Science in Seventeenth-Century England (Chicago:\nUniversity of Chicago Press), pp. 310\u201354.\n6 S teven Shapin (1996), The Scientific Revolution (Chicago: University of Chicago Press),\np. 116. Note that, while Kuhn made the tentative psychologistic suggestion that the\nexperimental/mathematical distinction may be \u2018rooted in the nature of the human\nmind,\u2019 Shapin\u2019s account is more sociological, attributing to Boyle the conviction\nthat \u2018mathematical means of persuasion were embedded within an improper,\neven immoral, social order\u2019 (Kuhn (1977), \u2018Mathematical versus Experimental\nTraditions,\u2019 p. 64; Shapin (1988), \u2018Robert Boyle and Mathematics,\u2019 p. 33).\n7 S hapin (1988), \u2018Robert Boyle and Mathematics,\u2019 p. 47.\n8 Shapin (1988), \u2018Robert Boyle and Mathematics,\u2019 p. 48. 6. Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 287\nBoyle could have both understood the thingness of things according to\na single uniform measure, and allowed that this thingness be specified\nand determined in different context-sensitive ways. What appears to\nhave been important to him was the existence of a common ontological\nmeasure against which these localised differences could then be\nmeaningfully judged.\nIn fact, Boyle\u2019s belief that the \u2018extension of experimental culture\u2019 could\nbe achieved through the imposition of \u2018universal metrological standards\u2019\nmay be viewed as a concrete manifestation of his tacit, or unconscious,\ncommitment to a uniform metaphysical standard according to which\nexperimental experience, in general, was to be organised.9 I use the term\n\u2018unconscious\u2019 in acknowledgement of Kuhn\u2019s observation that, because\nseventeenth-century experimental philosophers like Boyle typically\ndecried metaphysics and celebrated experiment, the interaction which\ndid occur between the two was \u2018usually unconscious.\u201910 Consequently,\nas an explicit concept by which to make sense of Boyle\u2019s experimental\npractice, math\u0113sis figures into the present account as an analyst\u2019s\ncategory rather than an actor\u2019s category.\nMy method is thus not historicist in the currently prevailing sense,\ndefined by Shapin as a \u2018practice devoted to interpreting historical action\nin historical actors\u2019 terms.\u201911 Nor is it presentist, in the sense of using\npresent-day terms to understand the past. Math\u0113sis is not an established\npresent-day term. It is a term originating in ancient Greek discourse, as\nwell as the etymological source of the present-day words \u2018mathematical\u2019\nand \u2018mathematics.\u2019 Heidegger returns to the ancient term in order\nto re-introduce a meaning which no longer forms an explicit part of\npresent-day usage. Indeed, this ancient meaning also appears not to\nhave figured in Boyle\u2019s use of the term \u2018Mathematicks.\u2019 According to\nShapin, especially in the context of the experimental philosophy, Boyle\nunderstood mathematics largely as a set of techniques for producing\n9 Shapin (1988), \u2018Robert Boyle and Mathematics,\u2019 pp. 30, 29.\n10 Kuhn (1977), \u2018Mathematical versus Experimental Traditions,\u2019 p. 44.\n11 Shapin (1994), A Social History of Truth, p. xvi n. 1. Shapin offers no programmatic\ndefence of historicism, adding: \u2018nor do I believe that historicism is without its\nproblems and proper limitation\u2019 (Shapin (1994), A Social History of Truth, p. 328).\nSee also Steven Shapin (1992), \u2018Discipline and Bounding: The History and Sociology\nof Science as Seen through the Externalism-Internalism Debate,\u2019 History of Science\n30(4), 333\u201369 (pp. 353\u201359). 288 Science as Social Existence\ndeductive certainty and numerical precision. By addressing the\netymology of the word, Heidegger sought to recover a meaning which\nhad become sedimented in subsequent culture, thus continuing to\ninfluence participants without figuring into their active vocabulary.\nHence, math\u0113sis might be viewed as a tacit actor\u2019s category, with its\ninfluence on Boylean experimental culture being inferred through its\nexplicit effects on the linguistic and non-linguistic practices of that\nculture.\nIn what follows, I will argue that Boyle was, in the Heideggerian\nsense of math\u0113sis, a mathematical philosopher. My focus will be on\nBoyle\u2019s dispute with the natural philosopher and mathematician Francis\nLine. A key point in this controversy was the legitimacy of Aristotelian\nfinal causes in experimental discourse. Boyle decried final causes as\nmetaphysical, and condemned Line\u2019s use of them. He commented, \u2018I\nam not very forward to allow acting for ends to bodies inanimate, and\nconsequently devoid of knowledge.\u201912 This implies an understanding\nof final causes which links them to sentience and knowledge. Yet, as\nwe saw in Chapter Five, neither Aristotle\u2019s nor Heidegger\u2019s concept\nof final cause necessarily ascribes sentience or knowledge to the thing\nwhose movements it was meant to help explain. Hence, I will argue,\nthe term \u2018final cause\u2019 included a sedimented meaning, one which Boyle\nneglected in his dispute with Line. Furthermore, the dynamics of Boyle\u2019s\nargument against Line reveal his own tacit, or unconscious, reliance on\nfinal causes in this sedimented and neglected sense.\nThis notion of final causes ties directly into math\u0113sis. Indeed, the\nfinal cause is the mathematical measure which allows us to make\nsense of the operations of both nature and art. Heidegger\u2019s account of\nseventeenth-century science especially focuses on the mathematisation\nof Aristotelian final causes, that is, their consolidation under a single\nuniform measure. This account gives particular attention to the roles of\nGalileo and Newton. I will first review Heidegger\u2019s brief discussion of\nthese two figures, before teasing out the implications of his comments\n12 Robert Boyle (1662 [1966]), A Defence of the Doctrine Touching the Spring and Weight of\nthe Air, Proposed by Mr. R. Boyle, in his New Physico-Mechanical Experiments; Against\nthe Objections of Franciscus Linus.

Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 289\nfor our understanding of the early-modern experiment. Then I will\nmove on to Boyle\u2019s dispute with Line, showing that the historical line\nHeidegger traces from Galileo to Newton runs directly through Boyle.\nIn the penultimate section, I will bring Heidegger\u2019s concept of the\nmathematical into dialogue with David Bloor\u2019s concept of social imagery,\nand briefly explore some general implications of this combination for\nthe historiographic method of the sociology of scientific knowledge\n(SSK).\nBefore we leap into the main current of the chapter, it bears\nemphasising that what follows is not an exercise in intellectual history.\nRecall, once more, that Heidegger defined math\u0113sis in terms of a twofold\nreciprocal relation between a mathematical projection of nature, on the\none hand, and work experiences, on the other. Hence, in explicating and\nexpanding on Heidegger\u2019s argument, I will give significant attention to\nthe materiality of early-modern scientific and technological experience,\nin general, and Boyle\u2019s experimental manipulations of nature, in\nparticular. My goal is to capture, if only roughly, the way in which\nmaterial practice and metaphysical project came to mutually reinforce\none another, each giving strength to the other, until a powerful new way\nof understanding and intervening in natural processes emerged, a novel\nintellectual and material culture, a new way of being in the world.\n2. The Galilean First Thing\nand the Aims of Experiment\nIn her 2004 book, The Body of the Artisan: Art and Experience in the\nScientific Revolution, Pamela Smith argues that \u2018the methods, goals,\nand episteme of art\u2019 are \u2018central to an understanding of the Scientific\nRevolution.\u201913 In particular, she emphasises the crucial contribution of\nan \u2018artisanal epistemology\u2019 to the emergence of early-modern science.\nThis epistemology was widely manifest in the artistic activity of the\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and it provides evidence for a\n\u2018form of cognition\u2019 unique to the craft operations of the period.14 In step\n13 Pamela H. Smith (2004), The Body of the Artisan: Art and Experience in the Scientific\nRevolution (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), p. 19.\n14 Smith (2004), The Body of the Artisan, p. 21. 290 Science as Social Existence\nwith Dear\u2019s emphasis on the seventeenth-century preoccupation with\noperational explanations, discussed in Chapter Five, Smith argues that\nthese artisans were more concerned with understanding the processes\nof nature than with creating representations of nature. To this end, they\ndeveloped a deep and sophisticated expertise about the way matter\nbehaves under a diverse range of conditions, with a particular interest\nin cases involving the generation and transformation of matter.15 This\nexpert knowledge was not abstract and theoretical, but embodied\nand practical: \u2018in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the pursuit\nof natural knowledge became active and began to involve the body;\nthat is, one had to observe, record, and engage bodily with nature.\u201916\nEchoing the earlier \u2018craftsman thesis\u2019 of Edgar Zilsel, Smith argues\nthat communication by these expert artisans with physicians, scholars,\nprinces, and city governors created a social dynamic from which\n\u2018new attitudes toward nature and a new discourse about it emerged.\u201917\nFurthermore, like Zilsel, who claimed that these social developments\nprovided only \u2018necessary conditions,\u2019 not sufficient conditions, for the\nrise of early-modern science, Smith also cautions that her account of\nartisanal practice offers an only \u2018partial answer\u2019 to the question of what\nbrought about the Scientific Revolution.18 Although she places more\nstress on the contribution of artisans, Smith nevertheless emphasises\nthat this period was marked by a \u2018mutual influence\u2019 between artisans\nand humanists, between practitioners and theorists, an influence which\nwas \u2018reciprocal and dialectical,\u2019 an influence which \u2018runs both ways.\u201919\nHer book, then, is not a reductionist account of science in terms of the\nskilled manipulation of matter by elite artisans, but instead a powerful\nreminder of the necessary and profound role played by those artisans in a\nlarger social transformation. In so arguing, she reinforces a point against\nintellectualist accounts of the Scientific Revolution represented by,\namong others, Alexandre Koyr\u00e9\u2019s reductionist emphasis on theoretical\nimagination as both necessary and sufficient for the emergence of\n15 Smith (2004), The Body of the Artisan, pp. 7, 14.\n16 Smith (2004), The Body of the Artisan, p. 18.\n17 Edgar Zilsel (1942), \u2018The Sociological Roots of Science,\u2019 American Journal of Sociology\n47(4), 544\u201362; Smith (2004), The Body of the Artisan, p. 151.\n18 Zilsel (1942), \u2018The Sociological Roots of Science,\u2019 p. 547; Smith (2004), The Body of the\nArtisan, p. 19.\n19 Smith (2004), The Body of the Artisan, p. 22. 6. Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 291\nearly-modern science. Indeed, Koyr\u00e9 explicitly rejected Zilsel\u2019s claim\nfor an artisanal influence on Galileo\u2019s work.20 John Randall was likewise\ndismissive of Zilsel\u2019s craftsman thesis, which he viewed, incorrectly, as\nnecessarily rooted in a Platonic metaphysics.21\nIt is important to recognise that Heidegger\u2019s account of the Scientific\nRevolution in terms of math\u0113sis predates the mid-twentieth-century\nswing towards theory-dominant explanations of early-modern science.\nAs noted in Chapter Two, Heidegger was a reductionist champion of\nneither theory nor practice, but was instead concerned with gaining a\nbetter understanding of the complex relationship between the two. Recall\nhis exclamation that \u2018it is by no means patent where the ontological\nboundary between \u201ctheoretical\u201d and \u201cnon-theoretical\u201d behaviour really\nruns!\u201922 However, when it comes to historical analysis, Heidegger, like\nSmith, puts his emphasis on one side of this dynamic: in his case, giving\nmore attention to intellectual rather than to pragmatic factors. Yet, just\nas Smith urges us, despite the one-sidedness of her account, to keep the\nreciprocal nature of the dynamic in mind, so too should we approach\nHeidegger\u2019s own historical comments in the same fashion. Heidegger\ngives scarcely any attention to the material practices of early-modern\nscience, but his account does not preclude such attention. In fact, as we\nhave already seen in the last chapter, he explicitly styles math\u0113sis as a\nreciprocal relation between ways of working with things, on the one hand,\nand the metaphysical projection of the thingness of things, on the other.\nIn this section, I will first gloss Heidegger\u2019s brief historical comments\non the emergence of early-modern science, and then suggest how these\ncomments may relate to the more practice-based accounts proffered by\nhistorians like Smith. This will further strengthen the point, made in\nChapter Five, that an analysis of manipulation alone cannot properly\nexplain the profound historical changes we are hoping to understand.\nIn order to make sense of early-modern accounts of nature, we must\n20 Alexandre Koyr\u00e9 (1943a), \u2018Galileo and Plato,\u2019 Journal of the History of Ideas 4(4),\n400\u201328 (p. 401 n. 6).\n21 John Herman Randall, Jr (1961), The School of Padua and the Emergence of Modern\nScience (Padova: Editrice Antenore), p. 130.\n22 Martin Heidegger (1962a [1927]), Being and Time, trans. by John Macquarrie and\nEdward Robinson (Oxford: Blackwell), p. 409 [358]. (Following scholarly convention,\npage numbers in square brackets refer to the original 1927 German edition of Being\nand Time.) 292 Science as Social Existence\ngive attention to both efficient and final causes, to both operations and\nends. In order to understand what early-modern natural philosophers\nwere up to, we should focus not just on the fact that they manipulated\nnature using experimental equipment, but also on the way they\nselectively ordered those manipulations with the intention of producing\nreliable natural knowledge. I have proposed that Heidegger\u2019s account\nof the Scientific Revolution be interpreted as a story of change in the\nprevailing conception of final causation in respect of natural processes.\nI consider this interpretation compatible with Zilsel\u2019s and Smith\u2019s\nrespective macro- and micro-historical attention to the transformation\nin relations between humanists and artisans, practitioners and theorists,\nduring the same period. This is a proposed interpretation, rather than a\nstraightforward gloss, of Heidegger\u2019s account, because this is not how\nhe explicitly described matters. I believe, however, that what follows is\nconsistent with his overall approach in the 1920s and 1930s, though I\nwill also note some consequential points of critical departure from a few\nof his more specific claims.\nRecall from Chapter Five that, for the Aristotelian natural\nphilosopher of the late Renaissance, the natural movement of a thing\nwas understood as movement to proper place, or, to form. This natural\nmovement was regulated by the thing\u2019s final cause. From this it follows\nthat a fundamental change in natural philosophical conceptions of\nmotion should also involve a fundamental change in corresponding\nconceptions of final cause. As the understanding of natural motion\nfundamentally changes, so too does the understanding of the rules or\nguidelines which give order and meaning to that motion. Although\nHeidegger did not have much to say about changes in early-modern\nconceptions of final causation, he does give brief but crucial attention\nto the corresponding changes in early-modern conceptions of natural\nmotion. A review of Heidegger\u2019s observations on this point will help us\nto render more explicit the implied corresponding changes in prevailing\nconceptions of final causation during that same period.\nHeidegger\u2019s discussion focuses on Newton\u2019s First Law of Motion, his\nprinciple of inertia, which reads: \u2018Every body [corpus omne] continues in\nits state of rest, or uniform motion in a straight line, unless it is compelled\nto change that state by a force impressed upon it.\u201923 Heidegger points\n23 Martin Heidegger (1967 [1962]), What Is a Thing?, trans. by William B. Barton, Jr.,\nand Vera Deutsch (Chicago: Henry Regnery), p. 78. 6. Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 293\nout that the phrase corpus omne, or \u2018every body,\u2019 indicates Newton\u2019s\nrejection of the fundamental Aristotelian distinction between terrestrial\nand celestial bodies.24 Indeed, under this law, the thingness of things\nis no longer subject to any kind of qualitative division: Newton\u2019s First\nLaw treats all things as being basically the same, as being circumscribed\nby the same basic blueprint. Furthermore, according to Heidegger,\nNewton\u2019s law is a formal articulation of an understanding of thingness\nwhich had already been expressed in Galileo\u2019s earlier account of free fall.\nFor Heidegger, Galileo\u2019s key innovation was to explain the difference\nin the time it takes for distinct bodies to fall to earth \u2018not from the\ndifferent inner natures of the bodies or from their own corresponding\nrelation to their particular place,\u2019 but from the external forces acting on\nthem, for example, the resistance of the air.25 With this, Galileo rejects\nthe Aristotelian attempt to contrastively explain a difference in natural\nmotion between two bodies by reference to a difference in their inner\norientations towards distinct places within a qualitatively differentiated\ncosmos. This latter kind of explanation is no longer valid because all\nthings are now conceived of as belonging to qualitatively identical\nplaces in the cosmos. Heidegger writes that with Galileo the cosmos is\nnow understood to be \u2018the realm of the uniform space-time context of\nmotion.\u201926 In qualitative terms, the heterogeneity of places within the\ncosmos has now become a homogeneity of positions within a uniform\nspatial realm.\nThere is a clear affinity between Heidegger\u2019s account of Galilean\nmotion and his earlier discussion of place in the context of the change-\nover from practical immersion in a work-world to a theoretical\nunderstanding of things as objects. In Being and Time, Heidegger writes\nthat:\nIn the \u2018physical\u2019 assertion \u2018The hammer is heavy\u2019 we overlook not only\nthe tool-character of the entity we encounter, but also something that\nbelongs to any ready-to-hand equipment: its place. Its place becomes a\nmatter of indifference. This does not mean that what is present-at-hand\nloses its \u2018location\u2019 altogether. But its place becomes a spatio-temporal\nposition, a \u2018world-point,\u2019 which is in no way distinguished from any\nother.27\n24 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 86.\n25 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 90.\n26 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 92.\n27 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 413 [361\u201362]. 294 Science as Social Existence\nHere, Heidegger is describing the nascent experience according to\nwhich early-modern mathematical physicists began to make sense\nof nature. In his later discussion of Galileo\u2019s free-fall experiments, he\nemphasises the sharp contrast between this way of experiencing nature\nas intelligible and the way distinctive of orthodox Aristotelians of the\nsame period.\nBoth Galileo and his opponents saw the same \u2018fact.\u2019 But they interpreted\nthe same fact differently and made the same happening visible to\nthemselves in different ways. [\u2026] Both thought something along with\nthe same appearance but they thought something different, not only\nabout the single case, but fundamentally, regarding the essence of a\nbody and the nature of its motion.28\nIn contrast to his more orthodox contemporaries, Galileo\u2019s work\nexperiences were shaped by a projection of nature in which the\nqualitative differences between things, so central to the prevailing\nAristotelian image of the cosmos, had now become a matter of\nindifference. He presupposed uniformity vis-\u00e0-vis the thingness\nof things. At a basic phenomenological level, he experienced all\nthings as the same. Methodologically, by drawing attention to the\nphenomenology of this basic Galilean experience, Heidegger seeks to\nuncover the ontological core of Galilean natural philosophy. Indeed, as\nHeidegger argued, \u2018[o]nly as phenomenology, is ontology possible.\u201929\nFor Heidegger, an ontological commitment to the qualitative\nuniformity of things is clearly evident in Galileo\u2019s final book, the 1638\nDiscourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences,\nfrom which he paraphrases Galileo as stating \u2018Mobile mente concipio\nomni secluso impedimento\u2019: \u2018I think in my mind of something moveable\nthat is left entirely to itself.\u201930 This generic moveable body will become\nthe corpus omne of Newton\u2019s First Law. Free from external influence,\nit exists in an autonomous state of uniform and perpetual motion (or\nrest). The social field of intelligibility in which the existence of such\na thing can make sense is what Heidegger dubbed the mathematical\nprojection of nature. He now identifies this shared projection with the\n28 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 90.\n29 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 60 [35].\n30 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 91. 6. Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 295\nmente concipio of Galileo: \u2018There is a prior grasping together in this mente\nconcipere of what should be uniformly determinative of each body as\nsuch, i.e., for being bodily. All bodies are alike. No motion is special.\nEvery place is like every other, each moment like any other.\u201931 This is,\nfor Heidegger, the missing mathematical element which marks the\nemergence of early-modern science: \u2018[t]he mathematical is the \u201cmente\nconcipere\u201d of Galileo.\u201932 Thus the key feature of early-modern math\u0113sis,\nwhat crucially distinguishes it from Renaissance regressus, discussed in\nChapter Five, is the uniformity or univocality in its projection of the\nthingness of the things. As Heidegger argues, \u2018[a]ll determinations of\nbodies have one basic blueprint (Grundriss).\u201933 In other words, as we\nsaw in Chapter Five, all bodies \u2014 and, more broadly, the thingness of\nall things \u2014 are experienced and understood according to one basic and\nuniform measure. Against this measure, \u2018the structure of every thing\nand its relation to every other thing is sketched in advance.\u201934 Where the\ncommunity of orthodox Aristotelian natural philosophers experienced\na qualitatively differentiated, hierarchically ordered cosmos, Galilean\nphilosophers now see a uniformly ordered world in which every place,\nand every thing, is qualitatively like every other.\nOn the basis of his conception of the mathematical projection in\nterms of a basic blueprint, Heidegger concludes that \u2018[n]ow nature is no\nlonger an inner capacity of a body, determining its form of motion and\nplace.\u201935 He seems here to have in mind a definition of nature in terms\nof final cause, that is, in terms of a principle regulating a thing\u2019s natural\nmovement and place in the cosmos. If, as Heidegger argues, this final\ncause can no longer be viewed as something internal to the thing, then\nit must be viewed as external to that thing. However, this does not seem\nto be Heidegger\u2019s conclusion. Instead, he argues that \u2018[n]ature is now\nthe realm of the uniform space-time context.\u201936 But this seems like a non\nsequitur. It is difficult to see how this space-time \u2018realm\u2019 is supposed to\ndetermine the form of motion and the place of a thing. It would seem,\nrather, to be the arena in which such a determination may occur. Hence,\n31 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 91.\n32 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 116.\n33 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 91.\n34 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 92.\n35 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 92.\n36 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 92. 296 Science as Social Existence\na definition of nature in terms of this realm does not replace the inner\ncapacity of a thing to move towards its proper place in the cosmos.\nInstead, one may say that the thing retains an inner capacity to follow\nspecific rules of motion, rules which guide it to its natural place. But\nthis place is not unique to the thing\u2019s kind, or category; it is rather a\ngeneric place, qualitatively identical to every other place, in the uniform\nspace-time realm. It would thus be more consistent with Heidegger\u2019s\noverall account to describe the mathematical, not as replacing the inner\ncapacities of things, but rather as rendering those capacities uniform in\na way which mirrors the uniformity of the post-Aristotelian cosmos. In\na uniform world, a differential, or pluralistic, account of final causes\nbecomes unnecessary. Because this world admits of no differences,\nthere is no need to reckon difference in the fundamental rules governing\nthe natural movements of things. Indeed, now only one basic set of\nrules is needed in order to understand these movements at their most\nprimitive level. In this way, the mathematical projection opens up an\nexperiential space in which the concept of a universal physical law\nfirst becomes intelligible, and then realises its formal articulation in\nNewton\u2019s First Law: every body continues in its state of rest, or uniform\nmotion in a straight line, unless it is compelled to change that state by\na force impressed upon it. In the Newtonian universe, it is an implicit\nassumption that every physical thing possesses a capacity to consistently\nfollow this basic and universal law. This law now serves as the final\ncause of a thing\u2019s most primitive form of motion: it is what regulates\nthat motion; it is that for the sake of which the thing moves, elementally,\nthrough a uniform space-time realm.37 In achieving pure conformity to\nthis universal law \u2014 and so escaping the contingent effects of external,\nlocalised causal forces \u2014 the thing assumes its proper place, or state,\n37 Trish Glazebrook calls this the early-modern \u2018homogenization\u2019 of natural place. She\ncorrectly observes that now \u2018[n]o distinction is made between things on the basis\nof motion toward an end.\u2019 However, from this she then incorrectly concludes that\n\u2018things are apprehended not in terms of [internal] essence or telos [i.e., end],\u2019 \u2018but on\nthe basis of external force\u2019 (Trish Glazebrook (2000b), \u2018From \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 to Nature, \u03c4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7\nto Technology: Heidegger on Aristotle, Galileo, and Newton,\u2019 The Southern Journal of\nPhilosophy 38, 95\u2013118 (pp. 109, 110; my brackets); see also, Trish Glazebrook (2001b),\n\u2018The Role of the Beitr\u00e4ge in Heidegger\u2019s Critique of Science,\u2019 Philosophy Today 45(1):\n24\u201332 (p. 25)). But, if this were true, then the First Law would be unintelligible.\nExplanations in terms of external force entail a conception of internal essence, even\nwhen that essence is homogenous across entities. 6. Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 297\nin the post-Aristotelian cosmos, that is, a place where it is left entirely\nto itself, to be at rest, or to move uniformly in a straight line, without\ninterference from without.\nYet, Heidegger argues that Newton\u2019s First Law \u2018speaks of a thing\nthat does not exist. It demands a fundamental representation of things\nwhich contradicts the ordinary.\u201938 The problem is that, although every\nthing may be capable of following this law, there is no basis in ordinary\nexperience to accept this because we do not ordinarily encounter things\nas being unaffected by external forces. Put in Galileo\u2019s terms, we do\nnot ordinarily experience a thing \u2018left entirely to itself.\u2019 What is more,\nHeidegger argues that \u2018[t]here is also no experiment which could ever\nbring such a body to direct perception.\u201939 Hence, the new mathematical\nprojection of nature puts at its centre an elemental understanding of\nthe thing which is closed off not just from ordinary experience, but\nfrom experimental experience as well. We can encounter it neither in\nordinary life nor in the laboratory.\nHeidegger argues that this mathematical understanding of the thing,\nwhich places it beyond the scope of experimental observation, also makes\npossible the experiment as \u2018a necessary and prime component of [scientific]\nknowledge.\u201940 Because the mathematically projected thing is a necessary\ncondition for the possibility of experimental knowledge, it cannot also\nbe something discoverable by experimental means. Heidegger writes\nthat \u2018[i]t is precisely the projecting-open of nature in the mathematical\nsense that is the presupposition for the necessity and possibility of\n\u201cexperiment.\u201d\u201941 The idea seems to be that the art of experiment, as a\nset of operations for investigating nature, is necessarily guided by\na mathematical \u2014 more precisely, an axiomatic \u2014 understanding of\nthings as primitively autonomous, as left purely to themselves in a\nqualitatively uniform world. One may picture the cosmic demiurge,\nforging the \u2018First Thing\u2019 into existence, and then sending it out, alone,\ninto the empty expanse of space, where it sails unobstructed under the\nrule-governed constancy of its own internal inertia.\n38 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 89.\n39 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 89.\n40 M artin Heidegger (1999 [1989]), Contributions to Philosophy (From Enowning), trans.\nby Pravis Emad and Kenneth Maly (Bloomington: Indiana University Press), p. 113;\nmy brackets.\n41 H eidegger (1999 [1989]), Contributions to Philosophy, p. 113. 298 Science as Social Existence\nBut the experimental practitioner will never discover this First Thing,\nbecause she works in a world populated by an untold number of things,\neach impinging on the autonomy of the others. What the axiomatic\nimage of the First Thing gives the experimentalist is an understanding of\nthings which permits her to meaningfully distinguish their fundamental\nthingness, their whatness or essence, from the effects wrought on them\nby the external contingencies of their local environment. Hence, a\nthing falls to the earth, not because it is composed essentially of earth,\nbut because the earth exerts an external influence on it, accelerating\nit downward. The earth thus interferes with the autonomy of the\nthing, accelerating it out of its indigenous state of uniform rectilinear\nmotion (or rest). In doing so, it allows the thing to become an object\nof experimental observation. More specifically, the experimentalist can\nnow empirically investigate the acceleration of the thing as caused by\nthe earth. Furthermore, because the thing\u2019s relationship to the earth is\nnot unique, one can predict that the earth will affect other things in\nthe same way. Hence, a heavier or lighter body should also accelerate\ntowards the earth at the same rate: the effect should be universal, as\ndetermined by the mathematically projected basic blueprint of nature.\nAs Heidegger observes in respect of Galileo\u2019s free-fall experiment,\nthis prediction was not confirmed, because two simultaneously released\nbodies, of differential weight, hit the earth\u2019s surface at different times.\nYet Galileo was able to reason that this was not evidence of a difference\nin the respective relations of the two bodies to the earth, but rather of the\ndifferential effect of a further external influence, air resistance, on the\nbodies. Again, the axiomatic image of the First Thing allows this further\neffect to be explained away as irrelevant to the phenomenon under test.\nIn a vacuum, or near vacuum, this effect should not be present, as was\nfamously confirmed by David Scott when he let a hammer and a feather\nfall freely from an equal height during the 1971 Apollo 15 moonwalk.\nThe point is that the thing, as mathematically projected, allows the\nexperimentalist to identify certain causal influences as irrelevant to\nthe effect under study, in the interests of isolating just those causes\nresponsible for that effect. Because the project establishes the a priori\nuniformity of all bodies, including their uniform receptivity to fixed\nrules of motion, an observed difference in the behaviour of two bodies\nmust indicate, not an essential difference in the bodies themselves, but 6. Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 299\nrather a difference in the external causal nexuses which act on those\nbodies. To artificially achieve the same observed effect in the behaviour\nof the two bodies is to have successfully eliminated the difference in\ntheir respective causal nexuses \u2014 as Scott dramatically demonstrated\non the moon\u2019s surface. In this way, the experimental practitioner isolates\nthe cause of a particular behaviour, or effect, and then demonstrates the\nregularity of this causal relation.\nThis artificially facilitated isolation of causes, and the accompanying\ndetermination of the relevant causal relation, is a process of discrimination\nwhich presupposes a stable standard of judgement. According to\nHeidegger, this standard is provided by the mathematical projection\nof the thingness of things, which stipulates that no observable effect on\nthe thing is essential to the nature of that thing, and so all such effects\ncan, in principle, be eliminated without compromising the indigenous\nnature of the thing. The thingness of the thing is thus defined in terms of\nthe purity of its conformity, in the absence of external influence, to what\nNewton formalised as the First Law of Motion. The experimentalist\ncannot empirically demonstrate the existence of this pure state, but she\ncan employ it as a norm by which to justify the elimination of noise\nfrom an experimental system, that is, the externally generated effects\ninterfering with the specific causal relations which the experiment is\nmeant to isolate and test. In principle, all observable effects might be\neliminated from an experimental system, thus leaving the thing entirely\nto itself, in a purified state of mathematically projected thingness. But\nthis marks the limit of possibility for experimental practice, because\nit makes scientific knowledge of things impossible. In practice, the\nexperimentalist is rather more concerned with isolating and stabilising\nspecific causes, so as to reliably demonstrate, or explain, specific effects.\nThis artificially facilitated act is a demonstration of the kind which\nPaduan medical Aristotelians called propter quid, that is, a demonstration\nof why an effect is. Recall, from Chapter Five, Agostino Nifo\u2019s four\nstages of scientific method. First, one observes an effect. Second, one\ndiscovers the cause of that effect. Third, one gains precise knowledge\nof the cause through negotiatio, or definition. Fourth, on the basis of\nthis precise knowledge, one now knows the effect propter quid, that\nis, in a well-reasoned, or well-grounded, manner. Nifo argued that\nthis well-grounded knowledge of an effect carries the certainty of 300 Science as Social Existence\ndemonstrative knowledge, but only in an empirical, not a mathematical,\nsense. Negotiatio is not a purely rational, or intellectual, operation, but\nalso includes a material element. The isolation and definition of a\nrelevant cause requires the physical manipulation of the causal system\nunder investigation. As argued in Chapter Five, these manipulations\nrequire a principle to guide them, to give them order and meaning,\notherwise they would amount only to random behaviour. In the case\nof early-modern science, this principle was the missing mathematical\nelement enabling the transition from medieval regressus to early-\nmodern math\u0113sis. In Aristotelian terms, this element supplies the final\ncause guiding experimental manipulations, the organising principle, or\nsource of intelligibility, for the new experimental philosophy. Crucially,\nthis element includes an a priori conception of the thingness of the thing,\na conception which is not discovered inductively through observation\nof the thing under investigation \u2014 as Jacopo Zabarella had argued in\nthe case of regressus \u2014 but which is instead already known before the\ninvestigation has even begun. It serves as a basic axiom upon which\nthat investigation becomes possible. According to Heidegger, this is\na uniform conception of the thing as law-abiding and autonomous, a\nthing which, when left to itself, conforms absolutely to an inherent and\nuniversal principle of inertia, a principle which would become formally\narticulated in Newton\u2019s First Law. This uniform conception \u2014 the\nGalilean First Thing \u2014 provides a basic blueprint for the metaphysical\nprojection of the thingness of things in general, a projection which\nHeidegger uses to explain the emergence of early-modern science.\nMore narrowly, this mathematical conception renders intelligible\nthe technical stabilisation of the thing in an artificial set-up where\nmost of the causal forces acting on it are systematically eliminated, or\nrendered irrelevant, in the interests of isolating specific, observable,\nand contingent causal effects, effects the artificially induced repetition\nof which evince a regularity in the thing\u2019s relation to its artificially\ncontrolled environment. In this way, the art of experiment may be\nviewed, not as a violation of natural processes, but instead as an attempt\nto complement or complete them. Viewed from within the mathematical\nproject, the new experimental philosophy does not seek to impose a final\ncause on the thing from without, so as to override its natural tendencies,\nbut instead to organise and employ artificial operations in accordance 6. Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 301\nwith an image of the thing as it is when left to its own indigenous,\nrule-governed nature.42 The aims of experimental practice are thus\ntwofold. First, and more familiarly, the experiment aims to disclose\nspecific regularities in an artificially controlled experimental system, a\nsystem comprised of two or more interacting things: for example, the\nuniform acceleration of a body vis-\u00e0-vis the earth. Second, and more\nprovocatively, the experiment employs artificial means to move, or\nmanipulate, the thing in a way which brings it closer to being what it\nis, to achieving its proper place in the uniform space-time realm as an\ninternally disciplined and wholly autonomous thing. It seeks, in other\nwords, to treat things in accordance with the one basic blueprint of the\nmathematical projection. The second aim provides the phenomenological\nbackground against which the first aim can be intelligibly pursued. The\nregularity of a relation between two things presupposes the constancy\nand rule-conformity of each thing on its own, and this presupposition is\nprovided by the mathematical projection of the Galilean First Thing. As\na consequence of this projection, the practitioner understands the goal\nof her artificial manipulations to be in conformity with nature\u2019s own\nindigenous dispositions. Experimental art thus not only imitates nature,\nbut also, to repeat a passage from Aristotle first cited in Chapter Five,\n\u2018art partly completes what nature cannot bring to a finish.\u201943 As we will\nsee in the next section, within this mathematically structured experience,\nexperimental manipulations acquire an aura of transparency, they are\nexperienced as granting neutral access to an independently existing and\nstable natural order. They are experienced, in other words, as disclosing\nobjective matters of natural fact.\n42 O n this point, my interpretation differs from that of Glazebrook, who has\nHeidegger arguing that \u2018[t]he experiment [\u2026] is violent in that it sets beings up to\nbehave in ways they would not when left to themselves\u2019 (Trish Glazebrook (2000a),\nHeidegger\u2019s Philosophy of Science (New York: Fordham University Press), p. 104; see\nalso Trish Glazebrook (1998), \u2018Heidegger on the Experiment,\u2019 Philosophy Today 42(3),\n250\u201361). She supposes that, for Heidegger, the final end towards which a thing is\nnaturally directed is necessarily violated by the modern experiment. This may have\nbeen the view of orthodox Aristotelian natural philosophers, but it was not, on my\nreading, Heidegger\u2019s view.\n43 Aristotle (1941c), Physica, trans. by R. P. Hardie and R. K. Gaye, in The Basic Works\nof Aristotle, ed. by Richard KcKeon (New York: Random House), pp. 213\u2013394 (p. 250\n[lines 199a14\u201317]). 302 Science as Social Existence\n3. Releasing Experimental Things\nHistorian of science Robert Kohler has argued that the scientific\nlaboratory is governed by a \u2018logic of placelessness\u2019: \u2018Laboratory workers\neliminate the elements of place from their experiments.\u201944 This claim is\nstronger than Heidegger\u2019s claim that the mathematical projection of\nnature \u2018overlooks\u2019 place, rendering it a matter of \u2018indifference.\u201945 Yet\nthe difference between elimination and indifference has been lost on\nsome critics of Heidegger\u2019s existential account of science. Karin Knorr-\nCetina, for example, writes that Heidegger\u2019s account of science \u2018is\nfounded on nothing more than the decontextualization from which it\nwas derived.\u201946 William Blattner likewise argues that, for Heidegger,\nnatural science \u2018releases\u2019 things from situatedness, \u2018decontextualizes\nthem.\u2019 Dimitri Ginev follows in step, presenting Heidegger as asserting\nthe \u2018disappearance of any situatedness (or place) in what becomes\nmathematically projected.\u2019 However, although Heidegger does argue\nthat the thing is \u2018released\u2019 in the mathematical projection, this means\nneither that it becomes decontextualised, nor that its place is eliminated.\nIt means, instead, that the thing comes to be experienced differently. Its\nsituatedness in an everyday environment becomes unimportant for the\nsubject\u2019s understanding of what it is. Its context has not been eliminated,\nbut instead replaced by the artificially constructed and controlled\nenvironment of the laboratory. Laboratory practitioners still experience\nthe thing as situated, but its situation has changed dramatically. The\nthing is now encountered in a different context, an artificial context\ndesigned to move the thing closer to its natural place, as determined by\nthe mathematical projection, the place to which it is now understood to\nproperly belong.47\n44 R obert E. Kohler (2002), Landscapes and Labscapes: Exploring the Lab-Field Border in\nBiology (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), pp. 9, 6.\n45 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 413 [361].\n46 K arin D.

Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 303\nThe claim that the experiment helps move the thing to its proper\nplace in a mathematically projected world challenges the more common\nview that the experiment serves to control the thing. On the present\naccount, the experiment does not control the thing, but rather the causal\nnexus in which the thing is situated, and it does this in the interest\nof letting the thing be what it is. This is the meaning of Heidegger\u2019s\nstatement that the thing is \u2018released\u2019 [entschr\u00e4nkt] by natural science\nfrom the confines of its everyday situation.48 In German, the noun\nSchrank can mean \u2018bound,\u2019 in the mathematical sense of the upper or\nlower bounds of a finite number set. But it also carries the more general\nmeaning of a limit, fence, or barrier. Hence, the phrase etwas in Schranken\nhalten means to restrain something, to hold it back, to rein it in. When a\nthing becomes entschr\u00e4nkt, it is \u2018dis-bounded,\u2019 released from the bounds,\nbonds, or barriers which had restrained it \u2014 it is set free. Recall, from\nthe last section, the mythical image of the cosmic demiurge, forging the\nFirst Thing in her workshop, sending it off to sail, alone and unhindered,\nacross the empty expanse of space, ruled only by the constancy of its\nown internal inertia. Now imagine that thing suddenly plunging into\nthe blooming and buzzing causal nexus of the world as we ordinarily\nexperience it. It is from this latter situation that the experimentalist\nseeks to release the thing, stripping away the causal interference which\nprevents it from being what it is, and thus turning it back towards the\npurity of its own mythical beginnings.49\n[1985]). Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics \u0398 1\u20133: On the Essence and Actuality of Force, trans.\nWalter Brogan & Peter Warnek (Bloomington: Indiana University Press), p. 67).\nIndeed, Heidegger sought to understand the radical transformation of this kind of\nexplanation in the early-modern period, rather than to affirm its rejection.\n48 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 413 [362].\n49 H eidegger\u2019s account of the experiment appears to share some characteristics with\nNancy Cartwright\u2019s more recent account. She writes that the experiment provides\n\u2018the circumstances where the feature under study operates, as Galileo taught,\nwithout hindrance or impediment, so that its nature is revealed in its behaviour\u2019\n(Nancy Cartwright (1999), The Dappled World: A Study of the Boundaries of Science\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), p. 84). Furthermore, she argues that we\nmust already know, in some general sense, what this nature is in order to design\nan experiment which will successfully reveal it: \u2018[w]ithout the concept of natures,\nor something very like it, we have no way of knowing what it is we are testing\u2019\n(p. 90). For Cartwright, these are \u2018Aristotelian-style natures\u2019 (p. 81). Hence, she\nconcludes: \u2018The empiricists of the scientific revolution wanted to oust Aristotle\nentirely from the new learning. I have argued that they did no such thing\u2019 (p. 103).\nA detailed comparison of the respective accounts of Heidegger and Cartwright 304 Science as Social Existence\nThe question now is: how did late Renaissance practitioners come\nto understand the thing in this way? What caused this profound shift\nin the phenomenology of their scientific experience of things? The\nshort answer is: the emergence of the mathematical as an increasingly\npowerful influence on scientific cognition. Yet Heidegger argues that\n\u2018this mathematical must [\u2026] be grasped from causes that lie even\ndeeper.\u201950 With this, he points us towards the conditions of possibility\nfor the early-modern mathematical experience of things.\nHeidegger\u2019s own attempt to shed light on these conditions is not\nespecially helpful, but he does hint at the direction in which a further\nexplanation may be pursued. Sticking close to his own philosophical\npreferences, Heidegger looks for the \u2018deep\u2019 causes of the mathematical\nin the work of Descartes. In particular, he focuses on what was\nprobably Descartes\u2019s first philosophical work, Rules for the Direction\nof the Mind, an unfinished manuscript which he may have written in\n1628, and which was already mentioned in Chapter Four. In this work,\ndeclares Heidegger, \u2018the modern concept of science is coined.\u201951 The\nRules provide substantial evidence for the formal articulation of the\nmathematical, particularly in respect of its tendency to \u2018explicate itself\nas the standard of all thought and to establish the rules which thereby\narise.\u201952 Accordingly, as we saw in Chapter Four, Descartes develops a\nconcept of thinking in terms of the res cogitans, the thinking thing, which\nhe defined in the first-person singular. The thinking thing thus becomes\nan individual \u2018I\u2019; thinking is always an \u2018I think.\u2019 As a consequence,\nthrough Descartes\u2019s efforts, the mathematical becomes grounded\nin the \u2018I,\u2019 which itself becomes the basis for all thought, all the rules\nwhich govern reason. Recall, furthermore, Descartes\u2019s claim that all\nknowledge statements, in addition to positing the \u2018I\u2019 principle as their\nnecessary ground, also always posit an equally fundamental principle\nof non-contradiction. This second principle secures the purity of the \u2018I,\u2019\nand so also the purity of reason. The individual \u2018I\u2019 is the condition of\nmight be worthwhile, but this is not the place for it. Suffice here only to note\nthat, on Heidegger\u2019s account, Cartwright\u2019s natures will ultimately refer back to a\npossibility in the subject\u2019s shared historical existence, and will thus be amenable to\nsociological investigation.\n50 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 95.\n51 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 101.\n52 Heidegger (1967), What Is a Thing?, p. 100. 6. Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 305\npossibility for thinking, as such, and the principle of non-contradiction\nis the condition of possibility for the purity of that thinking.\nThere is a striking similarity between this early-modern\nunderstanding of the thinking thing, on the one hand, and the early-\nmodern understanding of the physical thing, on the other. The res\ncogitans shares an important homology with the res extensa, the extended,\nor corporeal, thing. Just like the Galilean First Thing, introduced above,\nthe Cartesian \u2018I\u2019 is individual and autonomous, governed only by the\nconstancy, the purity, of its own inner principle. This similarity should\nnot come as a surprise. As we saw in Chapter Four, Heidegger insisted\non the unity of things and thinking. Because the concept of each is\ndialectically bound to the other, the historical development of one will\nreflect that of the other. According to Heidegger, this dialectical relation\nwas located by Aristotle in the \u2018is\u2019 of the proposition, but subsequently\nobscured when Descartes buried it in the \u2018I\u2019 of the subject. Kant then\nre-discovered it in the individual subject\u2019s feeling of \u2018respect\u2019 [Achtung]\nfor the law, its phenomenological understanding of itself as a law-\nabiding being, as a being capable of being affected by the law. Heidegger\nthen construes Kant\u2019s notion of respect as self-respect, and argues\nthat, for Kant, the individual subject is bound by rules which it gives\nto itself. In opposition to this, Heidegger argues that rule-following is\nnot individualistic, but presupposes one\u2019s participation in a tradition,\nan awareness of one\u2019s historical being-with-others. Recapping the\nargument of Chapter Four, the principle of unity which binds together\nthings and thinking in the coherent production of scientific knowledge is,\nfor Heidegger, rooted in tradition, a historical and social phenomenon,\nwhich has been subject to a string of philosophical articulations over\nthe generations, tracing back through Descartes\u2019s \u2018I\u2019 to Aristotle\u2019s \u2018is,\u2019\nand then to its beginnings in Plato\u2019s mythical image of the demiurge.\nHeidegger identifies this principle of unity with the for-the-sake-of-\nwhich, his version of the Aristotelian final cause. Hence, he outlines a\nphilosophical history of the notion of final cause from Plato\u2019s demiurge,\nthrough Aristotle, Descartes and Kant, to his own concept of the subject,\nDasein. For Heidegger, \u2018Dasein\u2019s very Being [i]s the sole authentic \u201cfor-\nthe-sake-of-which.\u201d\u201953 In other words, the source of the principles which\n53 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 116 [84]. 306 Science as Social Existence\ngive order and meaning to our experience of things is our own social\nand historical existence.\nThis is a radical reinterpretation, but not a complete rejection, of the\nancient Greek craft analogy. The mythical world of the demiurge is\nnow reformulated as the social world. The art which unifies things and\nthinking, which organises and thus renders intelligible our experience\nof things, the art which helps things by letting them become what they\nare, is a finite and social human art. More specifically, the rules which\nguide that art are finite, social rules. Hence, Heidegger argues that the\nintelligibility of Newton\u2019s First Law, as universally applicable to all\ncorporeal things, is possible only on the basis of a particular historical\nprojection, namely, a mathematical projection of the uniform thingness\nof things. This projection must, furthermore, be understood as a finite\nand historical feature of human social existence. Heidegger locates\nits distal cause in the ancient image of the cosmic demiurge, but his\naccount of this mythical image in historical and social terms provides an\nopportunity to also locate its causes in more proximal socio-historical\nhuman actions, including the actions of the late Renaissance artisanal\nclass.\nThe influence of this artisanal class on Galileo\u2019s natural philosophy\nwas a key feature of Zilsel\u2019s craftsman thesis, which placed at its centre\nthe macro-sociological transition from feudal to capitalist patterns\nof social organisation in that period. But more micro-sociological\nexplanations are also possible. Smith, for example, points to recent\nresearch suggesting that late Renaissance craft methods were the result\nof a carefully thought-out technology, one which depended crucially\non the maintenance of a strict consistency in the physical materials\nto which those methods were applied.54 Such practical concerns with\nuniformity in craftwork would seem to manifest themselves also in\nthe experimental practitioners\u2019 desire to maintain the stability and\nuniformity of experimental things in order to reliably reckon the\nregularities in their causal relations with one another. As argued above,\nthis uniformity finds its ultimate expression in Galileo\u2019s principle of\ninertia, where a thing left to itself is just like every other thing, moving\nor resting with a constancy determined by a single, universal rule. The\n54 Smith (2004), The Body of the Artisan, p. 7. 6. Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 307\ndifferences between things are thus to be judged by differences in the\nexternal causes which play on them in their bumpy passage through the\nheavy traffic of the cosmos. Likewise, the differences between artisanal\nproducts, when each is wrought from the same uniform material, are\nto be judged by differences in the operations to which they have been\nsubjected in the intensive manufactory of the terrestrial workshop.\nBased on the present interpretation of Heidegger, I suggest that\nthe proximal sensibility of the artisanal workshop may have provided\nearly-modern experimental practitioners with a powerful analogy by\nwhich to conceptualise the thing in terms of material uniformity and\nreliable responsiveness to standardised methods of manipulation. The\npoint is that artisans provided natural philosophers with more than just\nan example of embodied knowledge-making, that is, knowledge won\nthrough the manipulation of natural materials; they also demonstrated\nan attitude towards embodied knowledge-making which prized the\nuniformity of both methods and materials. They put much effort into\ndeveloping a sophisticated material diagnostics according to which\nthe response of a particular material to standardised techniques of\nmanipulation and manufacture could be reliably predicted. For example,\nSmith notes Paracelsus\u2019s sixteenth-century observation that \u2018carpenters\nof his day knew how to choose, cut, and prepare wood panels, so that\neven after centuries very little warping and twisting takes place.\u201955\nLikewise, the use by Renaissance sculptors of \u2018consistent alloys [\u2026]\nindicates that they knew their materials and went to some trouble to\nprocure what they needed.\u201956 Late Renaissance artisans were thus\ncompelled by principles of control and prediction in their work with\nmaterials. These materials were controlled for consistency, so that their\nbehavioural responses to standardised forms of manipulation could be\nanticipated with confidence. Establishing the uniformity of material\ndispositions was thus a key value of artisanal practice.\nUrsula Klein and Emma Spary argue that early-modern laboratories\nemerged as sites where this intense interest in the stabilised connection\nbetween manual techniques and material responsiveness flourished:\n\u2018[l]aboratories [\u2026] represented a strand of early-modern expertise\ndeveloping around the manufacture of materials, as well as chemical\n55 Smith (2004), The Body of the Artisan, p. 86.\n56 Smith (2004), The Body of the Artisan, p. 86. 308 Science as Social Existence\ntechniques such a distilling, smelting, or dissolving.\u201957 Indeed, the\nmetallurgical practice of smelting is especially suggestive in this\nregard. As Christoph Bartels has argued, the \u2018beginnings of both\nearly-modern science and technology are closely linked to mining\nand metal production.\u201958 The efficient manufacture of base metals was\nboth a physically and an intellectually demanding undertaking, one\nwhich required \u2018hands-on knowledge and skill as well as text-based\nand mathematical knowledge.\u201959 Base metals like copper, mercury, tin,\nand lead do not ordinarily occur in their elemental forms, but must\nbe extracted from natural ores through a complex process known as\nsmelting. This process frees the base metal from the ore, using intense\nheat in a controlled environment to induce a chemical transformation in\nwhich unwanted substances are driven off in the form of gases and slag.\nIt bears emphasising that the smelting process does not simply melt the\nbase metals out of the ores in which they are present. Instead, smelting\nis a transformative process in which base metals are \u2018released\u2019 from\nthe chemical bonds which bind them together with sulfur, oxygen, or\nsilicon in their ordinarily occurring ore state. According to Bartels, the\ndepletion of metal-rich ores in Europe\u2019s leading mining districts in the\nsecond half of the sixteenth century, which increased the difficulty of\nmetal production, led to a sudden rationalisation of smelting techniques,\nmarked by innovations in \u2018precision measurement, data collection, the\nuse of mathematics, attempts at standardization, the writing of technical\ninstructions, [and] the writing of technical books to be published.\u201960\nThere is thus a striking operational homology between smelting, on\nthe one hand, and experimental practice as described by Heidegger, on\nthe other. Just as Heidegger argued that the experimentalist seeks to\nrelease the thing from the ordinary causal constraints which prevent\n57 U rsula Klein and Emma C.

Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 309\nit from being what it is, so too does the metallurgist seek to release the\nmetal from the ordinary causal constraints which prevent it from being\nwhat it is. Moreover, there was a rapid increase in the rationalisation and\npublication of smelting techniques during the period just prior to the\nemergence of the modern experiment in the early seventeenth century.\nIn the case of both smelting and experiment, the object of pursuit is a\nproduct of art, and, in both cases, the artful production of this object\nseeks to return it to its pure, indigenous state. In neither case, however,\ncan one speak of an opposition between art and nature. Instead, the\noperational dynamic is one in which art comes to the aid of nature by\nprogressively stripping away the external causal constraints which\nprevent the thing from being what it is, thereby allowing it to more\nfully realise its proper place in the cosmic order. Because these artful\nmanipulations are experienced, within the mathematical projection,\nas facilitating natural processes, they carry with them an aura of\ntransparency; they are understood to provide practitioners with neutral\naccess to an independently existing natural order, that is, to objective\nmatters of fact.\nHeidegger\u2019s account of the early-modern experiment thus lends\nconceptual support to recent historiographic attempts to explain the\nemergence of early-modern science, in part, by reference to the skilled\nartisanal manipulation of materials. In particular, Heidegger\u2019s account\nthrows light on that for the sake of which these manipulations were\noften performed: a cultural image of the First Thing. These historical\nstudies, in turn, lend support to Heidegger\u2019s philosophical account,\nmost strikingly the studies of late Renaissance and early-modern\nmetallurgy. If, as historians like Bartels, Klein, Smith, and Spary argue,\nthe emergence of early-modern science was consequentially linked to\nmining and metal production, then it is possible that the mythical image\nof the First Thing found concrete, existential support in the artisanal\nexperience of manufacturing pure metals. The pursuit of pure metals\nthrough increasingly sophisticated and rationalised metallurgical\npractices offers a powerful analogy for the natural philosophical\npursuit of the Galilean First Thing through the practices of experiment.\nIn this way, early-modern work experiences, on the one hand, and the\nmathematical projection of nature, on the other, may be viewed as\nreciprocally related, as serving to mutually reinforce one another. 310 Science as Social Existence\nHeidegger writes that \u2018[t]he more exactly the ground plan of nature\nis projected, the more exact becomes the possibility of experiment.\u201961 In\nother words, the more precise the projected ground plan becomes, the\nmore legitimate and unequivocally compelling experiment becomes\nas a method by which to render nature intelligible. The mathematical\nprojection is the condition of possibility for the experiment, and so the\nmore secure it becomes, the more powerfully it comes to shape our\nexperience of nature, the more apt we will be to regard the experiment\nas a preferred means of investigation. Yet, it is also the case that, the\nmore effectively the experiment verifies a mathematical conception\nof nature, the more secure the mathematical projection becomes as\nthe existential basis for that conception. An effective experiment not\nonly verifies a theory, it also reinforces the authority of the projection\nin which both experiment and theory become possible as a means by\nwhich to make sense of nature. According to Heidegger, the modern\nphysical experiment does this by producing an ever more exact\naccount of the thing, through ever more precise acts of numerical\nmeasurement.62 These rigorous acts of measurement serve to increase\nthe precision of our understanding, and hence to reduce vagueness, or\nequivocation, in our descriptions of nature. In rigorously disciplining\nthings by experimental means, we facilitate increased rigour in our\nthinking and theories about those things. Numerical measurement\nthus offers an effective and efficient means by which to underwrite an\nunambiguous, determinate, and logically consistent account of natural\norder. Numerical measurement furthermore becomes compelling as an\ninvestigative technique to the extent that the thingness of things is itself\nprojected as inherently unambiguous, as pure and naturally amenable\nto precise determination.\nThis emphasis on exactitude allows for a further specification of the\nargument, made in the previous section, that the aims of experimental\npractice are twofold. First, the experiment discloses specific regularities\nin the relation of one thing to another. For Heidegger, this disclosure, as\nwe can now see, is one which tends towards precision in its specification\n61 M artin Heidegger (1977a [1952]), \u2018The Age of the World Picture,\u2019 in The Question\nConcerning Technology, by Martin Heidegger, trans. by William Lovitt (New York:\nHarper & Row), pp. 115\u201354 (p. 122).\n62 H eidegger (1977a), \u2018The Age of the World Picture,\u2019 p. 122. 6. Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 311\nof the thing\u2019s behavioural regularities. Second, the experiment moves\nthe thing closer to what it is, to being an internally disciplined and\nautonomous thing. This movement, as we can also now see, involves the\nmaterial simplification and control of the thing\u2019s causal environment,\nthus disambiguating the thing\u2019s behavioural responses, allowing them\nto be unequivocally individualised, such that their regularities may\nthen be exactly specified. As noted earlier, the second aim provides\nthe phenomenological background against which the first aim may be\nintelligibly pursued. The material reduction of causal ambiguity in an\nexperimental system allows the experimental practitioner to specify\nnatural processes as precisely defined regularities, or even as exact\nlaws. Heidegger argues that only through the specification of such\nregularities, \u2018only within the purview of rule and law[, do] facts become\nclear as the facts that they are.\u201963 This is so because the physical matter\nto which a statement of natural fact refers has itself been isolated from\nthe multifarious and competing causes of its ordinary environment,\nthereby allowing the regularities of its specific environmental relations\nto be clearly individuated and precisely measured. In the course of this\nprocess, the matter in question thus becomes a matter of fact, a discrete\nthing to which an unambiguous propositional statement of fact may then\nbe applied. In the next section, we will apply Heidegger\u2019s account of\nthe early-modern experiment in a concrete, micro-historical case study\nof one dramatic dispute between two seventeenth-century natural\nphilosophers: Robert Boyle and Francis Line.\n4. Boyle versus Line: A Study\nin Experimental Fact-Making\nIn their 1985 book, Leviathan and the Air-Pump, a classic of the SSK\nliterature, Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer argue that seventeenth-\ncentury experimental practice depended crucially on the emergence of\na clearly defined community of experimental philosophers. Admission\ninto this community required one to accept the view that artificially\nproduced matters of fact could provide a legitimate basis for reliable\n63 H eidegger (1977a), \u2018The Age of the World Picture,\u2019 p. 120. 312 Science as Social Existence\nknowledge of nature.64 This social restriction helped to define the\nboundaries of the experimental community, determining those who\nwere, and those who were not, to be counted among its members.\nAccording to Shapin and Schaffer, the establishment of the epistemic\nrule that reliable natural knowledge must rest on experimental\nmatters of fact depended, in important part, on the prior definition\nof an experimental community through social rules of inclusion and\nexclusion. Hence, as they see it, the epistemic problem of how best to\nacquire knowledge of nature was contingent on the social problem of\nhow best to define the community of natural philosophers: \u2018the effective\nsolution to the problem of knowledge was predicated on a solution to\nthe problem of social order.\u201965\nThis insight from SSK can help us to expand on Heidegger\u2019s claim,\ncited at the end of the last section, that scientific facts become clear as the\nfacts they are only within the purview of rule and law, that is, only within\na domain of practice in which causal regularities are disambiguated\nand thus more precisely specified. Shapin and Schaffer\u2019s argument\nthat solutions to problems of knowledge are based on solutions to\nproblems of social order suggests that effective epistemic techniques\nfor the causal disambiguation of matters of fact are (necessarily but\nnot sufficiently) contingent on the deployment of effective social\ntechniques for the specification of membership in the relevant epistemic\ncommunity. By demanding commitment to the epistemic primacy of\nexperimentally produced matters of fact, early-modern experimental\nphilosophers effectively eliminated, as irrelevant, explanations based\non causes which could not be experimentally produced. On first blush,\nthis may suggest that only efficient, or operational causes, were meant\nto play a role in the new experimentalists\u2019 explanations of natural\nphenomena. However, as we have already seen, explanations in terms\nof operational causes, if they are to explain causal regularities, must\nmake at least tacit use of final causes. Hence, the social dynamics of\nexclusion which specified the early-modern experimental community\ncould not have rejected final causes, as such, without threatening the\nintelligibility of the experimental enterprise. It should follow, then,\n64 S teven Shapin and Simon Schaffer (1985), Leviathan and the Air-Pump: Hobbes, Boyle,\nand the Experimental Life (Princeton: Princeton University Press), p. 24.\n65 S hapin and Schaffer (1985), Leviathan and the Air-Pump, p. 282. 6. Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 313\nthat these dynamics functioned instead to disambiguate between\nthe legitimate and illegitimate uses of final causes in explanations of\nexperimentally produced phenomena. The burden of this section will\nbe to demonstrate that the social logic of early-modern experimental\nsubjectivity served to disambiguate final causes by relying, if only\ntacitly, on the mythical image of the First Thing. This image functioned\nas the uniform measure by which to differentiate between proper\nand improper causal explanations of experimental phenomena. This\ndifferentiation was, at base, a social one: the image of the First Thing\nalso enabled a discrimination between authentic and inauthentic\nmembers of the experimental community. In other words, it also guided\njudgements about the proper social organisation of seventeenth-century\nexperimental philosophy.\nI wish to support these claims by examining a case of controversy in\nseventeenth-century experimental philosophy over the correct causal\nexplanation of the \u2018Torricellian effect,\u2019 named for mathematician and\nphysicist Evangelista Torricelli, who first produced it in 1644. Shapin\nand Schaffer observe that, in the decade following its production, this\nexperimental effect \u2018was associated with [\u2026] questions of immense\ncosmological importance.\u201966 Given the diverse and dramatically\ncontradictory causes which were proposed to explain the Torricellian\neffect, Shapin and Schaffer name it as \u2018a key example of scandal in\nnatural philosophy.\u201967\nTo perform a reasonable approximation of the Torricellian\nexperiment, do the following. Take a thin glass tube, about one metre\nlong, and hold it vertically with the lower opening of the tube blocked\nwith one of your fingers. Then have the tube filled right to the top with\nmercury (wear gloves!), being careful to eliminate any air bubbles. Seal\nthe upper opening of the tube with a finger of your other hand, making\nsure that there is no air trapped between your finger and the mercury.\nNow immerse the lower end of the tube into a beaker half-filled with\nmercury, and remove your finger from this lower opening while keeping\nthe upper opening of the tube firmly covered. What happens? One\nmight expect the mercury to drop out of the tube, pulled down by the\nearth\u2019s gravity, since your finger is no longer holding it up by blocking\n66 S hapin and Schaffer (1985), Leviathan and the Air-Pump, p. 41.\n67 S hapin and Schaffer (1985), Leviathan and the Air-Pump, p. 41. 314 Science as Social Existence\nthe bottom opening of the tube. In fact, the height of the mercury in the\ntube does drop as some of the mercury runs out of the tube and into\nthe beaker. However, the mercury level in the tube does not drop all\nthe way down to the level of mercury in the beaker. Indeed, most of the\nmercury remains in the tube, suspended at a height of about seventy-\nfive centimetres above the level of mercury in the beaker (assuming\nthe experiment is being performed near sea level). Even in the absence\nof your finger sealing the bottom of the tube, something still seems to\nbe holding the mercury up, thus interfering with the effects of gravity.\nThis suspension of the column of mercury in the tube, significantly\nabove the mercury level in the beaker below, is the main experimental\neffect produced in the Torricellian experiment. In what follows, I will\nrefer to this suspended column of mercury as the \u2018Torricellian effect.\u2019\nSeventeenth-century natural philosophers disputed with one another\nover the cause of the Torricellian effect, that is, over the legitimate\nanswer to the question of what holds the column of mercury suspended\nat a height of about seventy-five centimetres.\nThere are two secondary features of the Torricellian experiment\nalso worth noting. First, because the mercury level in the metre-long\ntube has dropped, a space of about twenty-five centimetres has now\nopened up in the upper portion of the tube, between the surface of the\nsuspended column of mercury and the finger sealing the upper end of\nthe tube. This space is known as the \u2018Torricellian space.\u2019 Second, the\nappearance of this space in the tube is accompanied by a feeling, in the\nflesh of the finger sealing the upper end of the tube, that it is now being\nforced down into the tube. This experience is a secondary effect of the\nTorricellian experiment, and this effect is normally called \u2018suction.\u2019 As\nwe will see, however, the term \u2018suction\u2019 is problematic, as it presupposes\nthat the flesh of the finger is being pulled rather than pushed into the\ntube. In other words, it presupposes that the relevant physical cause\nof this effect is located inside the tube rather than outside of it. In early-\nmodern debates over the meaning of the Torricellian experiment, much\ndepended on the position one took in respect of this fine distinction.\nI will focus on one specific seventeenth-century dispute over the\nnatural philosophical meaning of the Torricellian experiment, one\nwhich occurred between Robert Boyle, on the one side, and Francis\nLine, who published under the Latin name Franciscus Linus, on the 6. Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 315\nother. This dispute was occasioned by the publication in 1660 of Boyle\u2019s\nbook New Experiments Physico-Mechanical, Touching on the Spring of the\nAir, and its Effects; Made, for the Most Part, in an New Pneumatical Engine.\nTwo aspects of the title of Boyle\u2019s book deserve emphasis. First, the title\nindicates that Boyle has undertaken an investigation of the cause of\ncertain effects, the cause in question here stipulated as the \u2018spring of the\nair.\u2019 Second, this investigation was conducted, for the most part, using a\nnew experimental instrument which Boyle called a \u2018pneumatic engine,\u2019\nbut which is usually referred to by historians of science, including\nShapin and Schaffer, as an \u2018air-pump.\u2019 Stated simply, the air-pump\nwas a sealed glass vessel from which air was evacuated by means of an\nattached pump.\nBoyle performed several experiments within this glass vessel,\ninvestigating the results produced on an observed phenomenon when\nair was removed, consequentially if not entirely, from the causal\nnexus within which that phenomenon was embedded. For example,\nin Experiment Seventeen of his book, Boyle lowered the Torricellian\nexperiment through an opening in the top of the glass vessel of his air-\npump, such that the open beaker of mercury was completely inside the\nvessel but the vertical Torricellian tube still protruded up through the\nvessel opening.68 (The tube used in this case had a closed upper end, so\nit was unnecessary to seal it with a finger.) Boyle then sealed the vessel\nopening though which the tube protruded, so as to render the vessel as\nair-tight as possible. With everything in place, he then used the pump to\nevacuate as much air as possible from the glass vessel.\nBy removing air from the space surrounding the lower portion of\nthe Torricellian apparatus, particularly from around the open beaker of\nmercury, Boyle introduced dramatic changes to the Torricellian effect.\nSpecifically, in the absence, or near absence, of air in the glass vessel,\nthe suspended column of mercury in the tube dropped to almost the\nsame height as the mercury in the beaker (which itself rose slightly). In\nother words, the Torricellian effect had been almost entirely eliminated.\nOn the basis of this result, Boyle argued that it must have been the\n68 R obert Boyle (1660 [1966]), New Experiments Physico-Mechanical, Touching on the\nSpring of the Air, and its Effects; Made, for the Most Part, in an New Pneumatical Engine,\nin The Works of Robert Boyle, vol. 1, ed. by Thomas Birch (Hildesheim: Georg Olms),\npp. 1\u2013117 (pp. 33\u201339). 316 Science as Social Existence\npresence of ambient air, pushing down on the surface of the mercury in\nthe beaker, which counteracted the effects of gravity, thus causing the\nmercury in the tube to be suspended at a height of about seventy-five\ncentimetres. Boyle\u2019s experiment purportedly served to reduce ambiguity\nand increase rigour in the natural philosophical understanding of the\nTorricellian effect by more definitely specifying the cause of that effect,\nnarrowing it down to the pressure of the ambient air on the surface of\nthe mercury in the beaker.\nHowever, Boyle was not content to simply argue that ambient air\nwas the principal cause of the Torricellian effect. He also claimed to\nknow what about the air produced this effect. He identified this \u2018what\u2019\nas the \u2018spring\u2019 of the air. In Experiment One of New Experiments, Boyle\nwrote that he finds it \u2018not superfluous nor unreasonable\u2019 to \u2018insinuate\u2019\nthe air\u2019s spring as a \u2018likely\u2019 cause for the experimental effects produced\nin the glass vessel of his air-pump.69 However, Boyle\u2019s initial diffidence\nregarding the epistemic status of the air\u2019s spring quickly disappeared.\nAs Shapin and Schaffer observe, by the early 1660s, Boyle viewed\nthe spring of the air as an established matter of fact rather than as a\nhypothesis. However, Boyle did not spell out the reasons for his\ngrowing confidence. As Shapin and Schaffer write, \u2018[v]iewed naively,\nor as a stranger might view it, it is unclear why the spring of the air,\nas the professed cause of the observed results, should be treated as a\nmatter of fact rather than as a speculative hypothesis.\u201970 In response to\nthis puzzle, they make the sociological argument that \u2018Boyle\u2019s criteria\nand rules for making his preferred distinctions between matters of\nfact and [hypothetical] causes have the status of conventions.\u201971 These\nconventions, in turn, drew their legitimacy from the \u2018total pattern of\nactivities\u2019 constitutive of the experimental culture which Boyle and his\ncolleagues were struggling to establish.72 Shapin and Schaffer support\ntheir sociological explanation for Boyle\u2019s discrimination between facts\nand speculative causes with a detailed examination of the way Boyle\nresponded to his critics, including the Jesuit mathematician and natural\nphilosopher Francis Line.\n69 Boyle (1660), New Experiments Physico-Mechanical, p. 11.\n70 S hapin and Schaffer (1985), Leviathan and the Air-Pump, p. 51.\n71 S hapin and Schaffer (1985), Leviathan and the Air-Pump, p. 52.\n72 S hapin and Schaffer (1985), Leviathan and the Air-Pump, p. 52. 6. Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 317\nBefore turning to Boyle\u2019s dispute with Line, it will be useful to first\nbriefly consider what Boyle meant when he attributed a spring to the air.\nAt the most general level, Boyle had in mind a corpuscular conception\nof the air as being made up of individual microscopic particles. He\nthus understood the spring of the air as a disposition of individual air\nparticles which was activated when those particles came into contact\nwith one another, or with any other body. Hence, he writes that\nour air either consists of, or at least abounds with, parts of such a nature,\nthat in case they be bent or compressed by the weight of the incumbent\npart of the atmosphere, or by any other body, they do endeavour, as\nmuch as in them lieth, to free themselves from that pressure, by bearing\nagainst the contiguous bodies that keep them bent; and, as soon as\nthose bodies are removed, or reduced to give them way, by presently\nunbending and stretching out themselves.73\nPut briefly, air particles endeavour to free themselves when placed\nunder pressure by an adjacent particle. Each particle possesses a \u2018power\nor principle of self-dilation,\u2019 which becomes actualised as an \u2018endeavour\noutward\u2019 when the particle is under compression.74 Boyle conceived of\nthe earth\u2019s atmosphere as composed of innumerable particles heaped\nup on top of one another, such that air particles near the earth\u2019s surface\nwhere maximally compressed under the great weight of the atmosphere\nabove them. In respect of the Torricellian experiment, Boyle argued\nthat the pressure of the atmospheric air on the surface of the mercury\nin the beaker was the sole cause of the Torricellian effect. By placing\nthe Torricellian apparatus in the glass vessel of his air-pump, and then\nexhausting most of the air from the vessel, Boyle removed the cause of\nthis effect. As air particles were removed from the vessel, the remaining\nparticles were able to progressively exercise their power of self-dilation,\nunbending themselves until they exerted scarcely any more pressure\non the mercury in the beaker. In other words, Boyle used his air-pump\nto \u2018release\u2019 the air corpuscles remaining within its chamber from the\nexternal influence of neighbouring corpuscles. This, in turn, released\nthe surface of mercury in the beaker from the weight of the atmosphere.\nAs a consequence, the column of mercury in the tube descended under\n73 Boyle (1660), New Experiments Physico-Mechanical, p. 11.\n74 Boyle (1660), New Experiments Physico-Mechanical, p. 11. 318 Science as Social Existence\nthe force of gravity, draining out into the beaker. A key consequence of\nBoyle\u2019s explanation is that it rendered the Torricellian space, between\nthe suspended column of mercury and the top of the tube, causally inert.\nIn Boyle\u2019s view, the Torricellian effect could be sufficiently explained by\nreference to the removal of air pressure from the surface of the mercury\nin the beaker.\nBoyle was careful to distinguish this particular explanation of the\nair\u2019s spring from the general fact that the air has a spring. He emphasised\nthis distinction by noting the contrasting explanation of Ren\u00e9 Descartes,\nwho conceived of the air particles as lifted by heat and the \u2018restless\nagitation of that celestial matter\u2019 surrounding the earth to the point\nwhere they begin to whirl about, \u2018each corpuscle endeavour[ing] to\nbeat off all the others from coming within the little sphere requisite to\nits motion about its own centre.\u201975 Yet, despite the differences between\nthese two explanations, they both assume that the air is composed of\nparticles possessing an \u2018endeavour outward,\u2019 a disposition to push\naway neighbouring bodies in order to achieve for themselves a state\nfree from external causal interference. Boyle\u2019s and Descartes\u2019s divergent\nexplanations for the air\u2019s spring thus stand as different specifications,\nor articulations, of the same general idea. Put in Aristotelian terms,\nthis disposition plays the role of efficient cause in the movements or\noperations of these particles. Moreover, as Boyle\u2019s own words suggest,\nthe meaning of the particles\u2019 outward movement, that for the sake of\nwhich they so move, appears to be a state of freedom from external\ninfluence, in other words, a state of autonomy. This autonomy may\nbe understood as the final cause of the particles\u2019 outward movement,\nas the principle according to which one is able to make sense of those\nminute mechanical operations, to experience them as intelligible.\nLet us now turn to the explanation Francis Line gave for the\nTorricellian effect. Line presented his arguments in a 1661 book titled\nTractatus de Corporum Inseparabilitate, or \u2018A Treatise on the Inseparable\nNature of Bodies.\u201976 Unlike Boyle, Line did not treat the Torricellian space\n75 Boyle (1660), New Experiments Physico-Mechanical, p. 12.\n76 L inus, Franciscus (1661), Tractatus de Corporum Inseparabilitate in quo Experimenta\nde Vacuo, tam Torriculliana, quam Magdeburgica, et Boyliana examinantur, veraque\neorum causa detecta, ostenditur, vacuum naturaliter dari non posse: unde et Aristotelica\nde Rarefactione sententia tam contra Assertores Vacuitatum, quam Corpusculorum\ndemonstratur (London). 6. Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 319\nas irrelevant for a causal explanation of the Torricellian effect. Indeed,\nhe suggested that this space contains a fine thread of matter \u2014 like\nBoyle\u2019s springs, too fine to be seen by the eye \u2014 which connects the\nupper surface of the suspended column of mercury to the flesh of the\nfinger sealing the top end of the tube. This thread, or funiculus in Latin,\nhelped to prevent the mercury column from falling below seventy-five\ncentimetres, and thus contributed causally to the Torricellian effect.\nHence, unlike Boyle\u2019s corpuscular springs, which possess a power of\nself-dilation, Line\u2019s thread possesses a power of self-contraction. This\nwas manifest as an endeavour inward, in contrast to the endeavour\noutward of Boyle\u2019s springs; where Boyle\u2019s springs push things away,\nLine\u2019s thread pulls them together. Line argued, in particular, that it\npulls the mercury and the finger, at either end of the Torricellian space,\ntowards one another. I will refer to this as Line\u2019s \u2018thread hypothesis.\u2019\nLike Boyle\u2019s spring hypothesis, the thread hypothesis sought to explain\nthe Torricellian effect in efficient, or operational, causal terms.77\nFurthermore, Line\u2019s thread hypothesis also sought to explain a\nsecondary feature of the Torricellian experiment, namely, the experience\nof the flesh of one\u2019s finger being forced down into the Torricellian\nspace. He argued that the thread attached to the finger\u2019s flesh, by its\npower of self-contraction, was what pulled the flesh into the tube. This\nexplanation was also meant to explain why one\u2019s finger was not only\nforced into the tube, but also why it stuck to the tube end. Indeed, much\nas effort is required to pull one\u2019s palm from the hose end of an operating\nvacuum cleaner, so too is effort required to pull one\u2019s finger from the\ntop end of the Torricellian tube, that is, in Line\u2019s terminology, to break\nthe thread attaching one\u2019s finger to the top of the mercury column. Line\nargued that Boyle\u2019s spring hypothesis failed to sufficiently explain this\nsecondary effect of the Torricellian apparatus.\nLine also thought that his thread hypothesis had another advantage\nover Boyle\u2019s spring hypothesis. As a Jesuit scholar, he was obligated to\nuphold the Scholastic doctrine that nature abhors a vacuum. Line thus\nalso argued that the thread forms in the Torricellian space in order to\n77 C onor Reilly notes that Line\u2019s thread hypothesis was not original: \u2018[s]uch a concept\nhad already been suggested under a number of different forms, by several scholars\u2019\n(Conor Reilly (1969), Francis Line S. J.: An Exiled English Scientist 1595\u20131675 (Rome:\nInstitutum Historicum), p. 65). 320 Science as Social Existence\nfill the void left by the falling mercury, thereby preventing a vacuum.\nThus, in addition to explaining the adhesion of one\u2019s finger to the\ntube, as well as contributing to an explanation of the Torricellian effect\nitself, Line argued that his thread hypothesis also confirmed a widely\nheld belief about nature: \u2018And hence is confirmed that common axiom\nused in the schools for so many ages past, that nature doth abhor a\nvacuum.\u201978 In Line\u2019s view, then, the prevention of a vacuum \u2014 that is,\nthe absolute separation of bodies \u2014 was that for the sake of which the\nthread forms in the tube and pulls inward. The prevention of a vacuum,\nof the separation of the constituents of matter, was the final cause, or\nreason, explaining why the thread is disposed to form and contract\nitself. In contrast to Line, Boyle declined to give an explanation for why\nhis corpuscular springs are disposed to dilate themselves. Although\nhe sought to explain the Torricellian effect in terms of an efficient, or\noperational cause \u2014 the spring\u2019s endeavour outward \u2014 Boyle did not\nlikewise offer an explanation in terms of a final cause, that is to say, he\ndid not provide a reason for why the springs always move themselves\noutward as opposed to in some other direction.\nIn 1662, Boyle published a response to Line in which he used his\nearlier silence about final causation as a strength in promoting his spring\nhypothesis over Line\u2019s alternative proposal. Furthermore, he exploited\nLine\u2019s reference to final causation in order to attack the intelligibility of\nthe latter\u2019s proposed efficient cause, the thread hypothesis. Boyle writes:\nIt seems also very difficult to conceive, how this extenuated substance\nshould acquire so strong a spring inward, as the examiner all along his\nbooks ascribes to it. Nor will it serve his turn to require of us in exchange\nan explication of the air\u2019s spring outward, since he acknowledges, as\nwell as we, that it has such a spring.79\nHere, Boyle argues that, because Line has accepted the legitimacy of\nBoyle\u2019s spring hypothesis, Boyle is under no obligation to provide a\nfurther explanation of spring in terms of final causation. This implies\n78 C ited in Boyle (1660), New Experiments Physico-Mechanical, p. 135.\n79 R obert Boyle (1662 [1966]), A Defence of the Doctrine Touching the Spring and Weight of\nthe Air, Proposed by Mr. R. Boyle, in his New Physico-Mechanical Experiments; Against\nthe Objections of Franciscus Linus.

Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 321\nthe view that an explanation in terms of operational causes can be\naccepted as legitimate independently of considerations of final cause.\nYet, although Boyle allows himself the benefit of this supposition, he is\nnot willing to extend this same benefit to Line. He uses Line\u2019s appeal to\nthe horror vacui as a final cause to undermine the legitimacy of Line\u2019s\nappeal to a self-contracting thread as an efficient cause. Yet, as his own\nwork makes clear, there is no necessary connection between a particular\nefficient cause and a specific final cause. Hence, Boyle might have\ninstead recognised the possible legitimacy of Line\u2019s thread hypothesis\nin isolation from the horror vacui, and he might even have reinterpreted\nthat hypothesis in a way more in step with his own principles.\nIn fact, this appears to have been Line\u2019s strategy towards Boyle.\nAs Boyle notes, Line claimed that \u2018[i]t cannot be conceived [concipi\nnon posse]\u2019 on a corpuscular model how Boyle\u2019s spring could take up\nmore space when it dilates itself.80 Line seems to have had in mind\nthe Aristotelian idea that \u2018things can increase in size not only by the\nentrance of something but also by qualitative change; e.g. if water\nwere to be transformed into air.\u201981 Hence, a sponge will increase in\nsize by absorbing water, but a volume of water will increase in size\nby qualitatively changing from a liquid to a gas. In the second case,\nnothing has been added to the substance; instead the substance itself\nundergoes a change. On the corpuscular model, in contrast, there is no\nqualitative change in the basic material of water when it changes from\na liquid into a gas. The corpuscles of water remain the same, but more\nspace is opened between them. Likewise, there is no qualitative change\nto a corpuscular spring when it self-dilates. The more successfully it\ncan beat back its neighbours, the more space it will take up, even as its\nphysical size remains unchanged. It thus seems clear that Line and Boyle\ndrew on radically different conceptions of matter in their respective\ninterpretations of the phenomenon of spring. And both claimed to find\nthe other\u2019s conception unintelligible. Yet Line was willing to accept the\nair\u2019s spring as a matter of fact so long as it was explained in accordance\nwith his own non-corpuscular principles. In contrast, Boyle was\nreluctant to do the same for Line\u2019s thread hypothesis. Indeed, he sought\nto reject that hypothesis by arguing, in part, that the principles Line\n80 Boyle (1662), A Defence of the Doctrine Touching the Spring and Weight of the Air, p. 126.\n81 Aristotle (1941c), Physica, p. 282 (lines 214a36\u2013214b2). 322 Science as Social Existence\nused to explain it \u2014 above all, the horror vacui \u2014 were unintelligible.\nGiven that Boyle was happy, in other contexts, to distinguish between\noperational hypotheses and their explanation, his attempt here to erase\nthat distinction seems less than fully compelling.\nIn addition to unintelligibility, Boyle offered three other reasons\nto reject Line\u2019s thread hypothesis: \u2018this hypothesis of our author\u2019s [\u2026]\nseems to be partly precarious, partly unintelligible, partly insufficient,\nand besides needless.\u201982 He immediately notes, however, that \u2018it will\nnot be so convenient\u2019 to prove each of these claims in isolation from\nthe others.83 Hence, for example, Boyle combines his argument from\nprecariousness with charges of unintelligibility when he argues that\nLine\u2019s thread hypothesis relies on a belief in the horror vacui, which has\nnot been \u2018cogently prove[d].\u201984 This lack of proof, concludes Boyle, \u2018may\nhelp to shew his doctrine to be precarious.\u201985 But, if the merits of Line\u2019s\nthread hypothesis can be judged independently of his belief in the horror\nvacui, then this argument from precariousness lacks adequate force.\nPerhaps the most promising reason Boyle gave to reject Line\u2019s thread\nhypothesis was that it is needless, or unnecessary. One of Line\u2019s strongest\nempirical arguments for his thread hypothesis was that it explains both\nwhy one feels one\u2019s finger being forced into the Torricellian tube, as\nwell as why the end of the tube sticks to one\u2019s finger. In addressing the\nformer case, Boyle writes that\nthe finger that stops the tube being exposed on the upper parts and\nthe sides to the external air, has the whole weight and pressure of the\natmosphere upon it. [\u2026] [C]onsequently that part of the finger that is\nwithin the tube will have much less pressure against it from the dilated\nair without. By which means the pulp of the finger will be thrust in\n(which our author is pleased to call sucked in).86\nIn addressing the latter case, Boyle argues that the \u2018pressure of the ambient\nair\u2019 will \u2018thrust in the pulp of the finger at the upper orifice of the tube,\nand make it stick closely enough to the lip of it.\u201987 Boyle immediately\n82 Boyle (1662), A Defence of the Doctrine Touching the Spring and Weight of the Air, p. 134.\n83 Boyle (1662), A Defence of the Doctrine Touching the Spring and Weight of the Air, p. 134.\n84 Boyle (1662), A Defence of the Doctrine Touching the Spring and Weight of the Air, p. 135.\n85 Boyle (1662), A Defence of the Doctrine Touching the Spring and Weight of the Air, p. 137.\n86 Boyle (1662), A Defence of the Doctrine Touching the Spring and Weight of the Air, p. 126.\n87 Boyle (1662), A Defence of the Doctrine Touching the Spring and Weight of the Air, p. 129. 6. Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 323\nrecognised that Line would not be convinced by this latter explanation,\nwriting that \u2018I know the examiner affirms, that no thrusting or pressure\nfrom without can ever effect such an adhesion of the finger to the tube.\nBut this should be as well proved as said.\u201988 Surely, however, the onus\nlay with Boyle to prove that his hypothesis sufficiently explains this\nadhesion, rather than with his critic to prove that it does not. In any case,\nLine was not alone in finding Boyle\u2019s explanation unconvincing. The\npowerful Dutch natural philosopher, Christiaan Huygens, commented\nat the time that he could \u2018not see that either Linus\u2019 hypothesis or Mr.\nBoyle\u2019s is satisfactory, that is, why the siphon sticks to the finger, so that\none must use some little force to draw it off.\u201989 It seems clear that, at the\ntime of the dispute, Boyle\u2019s claim to have given a sufficient explanation\nof \u2018suction\u2019 was not uncontroversial. Hence, it could not have provided\nadequate grounds for arguing that Line\u2019s thread hypothesis was not\nneeded for an explanation of this phenomenon.\nIt should be emphasised that Line, in order to provide space for his\nown explanation of the Torricellian effect, did not need to likewise argue\nthat Boyle\u2019s explanation was unnecessary, but only that it was insufficient.\nThis would have been enough for him to justify the introduction of his\nthread hypothesis as necessary, but not sufficient, for a comprehensive\nexplanation of the effect. Line\u2019s position was consistent with the view\nthat both his thread hypothesis and Boyle\u2019s spring hypothesis were\nnecessary for an explanation of the Torricellian effect, but that neither\nwas, on its own, sufficient for such an explanation. On this basis, Line\ncould have agreed with Boyle\u2019s claim that his thread hypothesis was\n\u2018partly insufficient\u2019 without revising his original argument.90\nIt seems that Boyle did not fully understand Line\u2019s position with\nrespect to this point. Although he recognised in several passages\nthat Line was criticising his spring hypothesis for being insufficient,\nin other passages he reacted as if Line were rejecting it as wholly\nunnecessary. In the first instance, Boyle\u2019s observation that Line \u2018denies\nit not, that the air has some weight and spring, but affirms, that it\nis very insufficient to perform such great matters\u2019 was one which he\n88 Boyle (1662), A Defence of the Doctrine Touching the Spring and Weight of the Air, p. 129.\n89 Cited in Reilly (1969), Francis Line S. J., p. 85.\n90 Elizabeth Potter also makes this observation (Elizabeth Potter (2001), Gender and\nBoyle\u2019s Law of Gases (Bloomington: Indiana University Press), pp. 36, 133). 324 Science as Social Existence\nrepeated several times throughout his response to Line.91 Yet he also\ndescribed Line as arguing that \u2018the things we ascribe to the weight and\nspring of the air are really performed by neither,\u2019 and also of trying\nto \u2018invalidate the hypothesis of weight and spring of the air.\u201992 In other\nwords, despite explicitly recognising evidence to the contrary, Boyle\nultimately treated Line as employing a zero-sum strategy, whereby\nonly one of their respective hypotheses could be explanatorily\nrelevant. However, it was, in fact, Boyle who employed this strategy,\nnot Line. Boyle argued that his spring hypothesis provided not just a\nnecessary, but also a sufficient, explanation for the Torricellian effect.\nHence, he viewed Line\u2019s proposed explanation as not only insufficient,\nbut also unnecessary, or \u2018needless.\u2019 But this appears to misrepresent\nthe dispute. Whereas Boyle treated the choice between the spring\nand thread hypotheses in exclusive either/or terms, Line seems to\nhave taken a more inclusive approach in which both hypotheses\ncould contribute to a comprehensive operational explanation of the\nTorricellian effect.\nIn sum, the four reasons Boyle gave for his rejection of Line\u2019s thread\nhypothesis \u2014 that it is \u2018partly precarious, partly unintelligible, partly\ninsufficient, and besides needless\u2019 \u2014 do not seem to adequately justify\nthat rejection. Two further reasons may help us to more fully understand\nBoyle\u2019s response to Line. The first reason has to do with Boyle\u2019s desire\nto neutralise the explanatory significance of the Torricellian space.\nThis space had been a flashpoint for metaphysical disputes over the\nexistence of a vacuum. The Aristotelian doctrine of the horror vacui\nplayed a central role in this dispute. As Shapin and Schaffer show, Boyle\nwas not trying to resolve this dispute, but instead to sideline it: \u2018[w]hat\nhe was endeavouring to create was a natural philosophical discourse in\nwhich such questions [about the existence of a \u201cmetaphysical\u201d vacuum]\nwere inadmissible.\u201993 By neutralising these disputes, Boyle and his\ncolleagues hoped to provide a solution to the problem of social order\nmade pressing by the intense civil conflict of their period. Their solution\n91 Boyle (1662), A Defence of the Doctrine Touching the Spring and Weight of the Air, p. 156;\nsee also pp. 124, 162, 178.\n92 Boyle (1662), A Defence of the Doctrine Touching the Spring and Weight of the Air, pp.\n134, 178.\n93 Shapin and Schaffer (1985), Leviathan and the Air-Pump, p. 45. 6. Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 325\ninvolved creating a new mode of discourse in which metaphysics\nwas supposed to have no legitimate place. This discourse embraced\nthe language of \u2018experimental \u201cphysiology\u201d\u2019 in opposition to the\nlanguage of \u2018metaphysics.\u2019 This distinction set up a powerful boundary\nwithin discourse about the natural world, and \u2018[d]issension involving\nviolations of this boundary [\u2026] was deemed fatal.\u201994 Boyle rejected\nLine\u2019s thread hypothesis because it violated this boundary by invoking\nthe metaphysical doctrine of the horror vacui, and thereby threatened\nthe social order which Boyle and his colleagues were struggling to\nestablish. According to Shapin and Schaffer, this boundary was a social\nconvention rooted in collective efforts to reestablish social and political\norder. Hence, Boyle\u2019s epistemological reasons for rejecting Line\u2019s\nthread hypothesis cannot be neatly separated from considerations of\nthe social context in which the debate took place. By invoking the horror\nvacui \u2014 the inseparability of matter \u2014 Line not only threated Boyle\u2019s\nprofessed empiricism, but also the conception of social order he shared\nwith other members of the emerging community of experimentalists.\nYet, as I argued above, once Line\u2019s thread hypothesis is separated\nfrom his commitment to the doctrine of the horror vacui, this doctrine\ncan no longer provide a compelling reason for rejecting the hypothesis.\nIn this light, Line\u2019s thread hypothesis seems no more metaphysical than\nBoyle\u2019s spring hypothesis. Indeed, Boyle even interprets it as an inverse\nof his own hypothesis: whereas he posits a spring outward, Line posits a\nspring inward. It is the directionality of the two hypotheses which most\nclearly and consequentially distinguishes them. This brings us to the\nsecond of the two further reasons for Boyle\u2019s rejection of Line\u2019s thread\nhypothesis. As an efficient, or moving, cause, Line\u2019s thread moves itself\nin the wrong direction. It acts to move things together, rather than to\npush them apart. I have argued, in general, that the directedness of an\nefficient cause, as that which regulates or guides a thing\u2019s operations\nand thus gives them a clear and stable meaning, is what Aristotle had\nmeant by the notion of final cause. In this sense, any interpretation of\na thing which ascribes to it a regular pattern of behaviour will rely on\nthis notion. Without it, the regularity of the thing\u2019s operations would\nappear to be a coincidence, a matter of chance, rather than the result of a\n94 Shapin and Schaffer (1985), Leviathan and the Air-Pump, p. 80. 326 Science as Social Existence\npower or principle belonging to that thing. Hence, when Boyle ascribed\na power of self-dilation, an endeavour outward, to his corpuscular\nsprings, he was implicitly recognising that a final cause regulates the\noperations of those corpuscles.95\nBoyle\u2019s tacit ascription of a final cause to the operations of his\ncorpuscular springs was buried beneath his declaration that the spring\nof the air was a matter of fact. As observed above, Boyle insisted on\na strict distinction between matters of fact, on the one hand, and\nspeculative hypotheses, on the other. Indeed, first recognising the\nTorricellian effect to be a matter of fact, Boyle then speculated that\nits cause was the outward spring of the air. However, Boyle quickly\ndropped his speculative tone and declared this outward spring to also\nbe a well-established matter of fact rather than a hypothesis. As Shapin\nand Schaffer note, Boyle did not explicate a reason for this change in his\nattitude, and they suggest that a sociological explanation can be given,\none which makes sense of Boyle\u2019s apparently arbitrary distinctions as\nhaving been guided by social conventions. On this basis, we can treat\nBoyle\u2019s discrimination between metaphysical and empirical language\nas a social discrimination motivated by a specific conception of social\norder. This was a discrimination in which a power of outward spring\ncould be accepted as an empirical matter of fact, while a power of inward\nspring was rejected as an unintelligible metaphysical hypothesis.\nThe credibility of Boyle\u2019s claim to have eschewed metaphysics was\ncontingent on his success in rendering invisible the interpretative space\n95 The outward endeavour of Boyle\u2019s microscopically insensible corpuscles was\nmetaphysical. However, he also studied sensible phenomena manifesting a similar\npower of motion. In a 1685 treatise, Boyle remarks on thick pieces of glass which,\nwhen cooled after removal from a furnace, burst apart, their pieces \u2018fly[ing] to a not\ninconsiderable distance from one another\u2019 (Robert Boyle (1685 [1966]), An Essay of\nthe Great Effects of Even Languid and Unheeded Motion, in The Works of Robert Boyle,\nvol. 5, ed. by Thomas Birch (Hildesheim: Georg Olms), pp. 1\u201337 (p. 24)). Likewise,\nwhen a bow string is cut, \u2018the bow will fly suddenly outwards, and the parts of the\nstring will swiftly and violently shrink from one another\u2019 (p. 26). And gemstones,\nwhen extracted from the hard cement of an aggregate rock, \u2018quickly expanded\nthemselves, as if it were by an internal and violently compressed spring, and would\npresently burst asunder\u2019 (p. 27). From this, Boyle concludes that \u2018bodies, which as\nto sense, are in a natural state of rest, may be in a violent one, as of tension, and may\nhave [\u2026] a strong endeavour to fly off or recede from one another\u2019 (p. 26). Boyle\nmay have viewed these phenomena as empirical vindication for his metaphysical\nclaim that corpuscular springs manifest an internal power of outward endeavour\nwhen released from compression. 6. Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 327\nbetween the Torricellian effect and his causal explanation of that effect\nin terms of outward spring. Hence, the most pressing threat posed to\nBoyle by Line\u2019s thread hypothesis was that it posited a power of inward\nspring which plausibly explained many of the same aspects of the\nTorricellian experiment. In this way, Line\u2019s intervention threatened to\nre-expose the contingency of the interpretative space existing between\nthe Torricellian effect and Boyle\u2019s causal spring hypothesis, a space\nwhich Boyle had worked hard to render invisible. Building on Shapin\nand Schaffer\u2019s analysis, one may conclude that Line\u2019s thread hypothesis\nthreatened the conception of social order which tacitly grounded\nBoyle\u2019s explanation of the Torricellian effect. However, contrary to what\nShapin and Schaffer argue, this threat cannot be explained in terms of\nLine\u2019s appeal to metaphysics, in the form of final causes, because Boyle\nalso shared this commitment to final causation. It would seem, instead,\nthat Boyle viewed the threat more as directed at his particular, tacit\nconception of the final cause of an individual corpuscle\u2019s movement: a\nstate of autonomy, of freedom from the things which surround it. Yet,\nas we have seen, Line did not challenge Boyle\u2019s conception of outward\nspring, as such. Line accepted the necessity of Boyle\u2019s proposed cause,\nbut challenged its sufficiency as an explanation of the Torricellian\nexperiment. Hence, what was ultimately at stake for Boyle was not\nthe validity of his spring hypothesis, but its exclusivity. Insofar as his\nhypothesis provided a solution to the problem of social order, Boyle\nmeant for it to serve as an exclusive solution, one that was both necessary\nand sufficient.\nThese two features of Boyle\u2019s explanation of the Torricellian\neffect \u2014 outward spring and exclusivity \u2014 can be fit together with two\ncomplementary features of Heidegger\u2019s explanation of the emergence\nof early-modern science in terms of the mathematical. These latter two\nfeatures are what I have called the First Thing, and what Heidegger\ncalled the basic blueprint. The mythical image of the First Thing helps\nto further explicate Boyle\u2019s model of a spring-like corpuscle which\nendeavours to beat away all neighbouring bodies, thereby opening up\naround itself a free space in which it can realise its natural, autonomous\nstate. This autonomous state is the final cause regulating the behaviour\nof Boyle\u2019s corpuscular springs. It is that place towards which things, by\nexercising their power of outward spring, endeavour to move themselves.\nBoyle\u2019s air-pump supported this endeavour, helping the corpuscles to 328 Science as Social Existence\nrealise their natural state. This end state or place is represented by the\nFirst Thing. Moreover, this end state is the only one towards which\nthings may be legitimately directed. In other words, Boyle\u2019s corpuscular\nsprings can be ultimately regulated by only one final cause. Hence,\nthe image of the First Thing also functions as the one basic blueprint\ngoverning the indigenous operations of all air corpuscles. Just as Boyle\u2019s\ninward spring was meant to play an exclusive role in his explanation\nof the Torricellian experiment, so too was the image of the First Thing\nmeant to serve as the one basic blueprint governing explanations of\nmaterial phenomena in the new Galilean universe. The Galilean First\nThing was the basic blueprint guiding Boyle\u2019s explanation of the spring\nof the air. It was the tacitly held mathematical image underpinning the\nsocial logic of inclusion and exclusion which enabled Boyle and his\ncolleagues to discriminate between legitimate and illegitimate accounts\nof experimental phenomena, and hence also between authentic and\ninauthentic members of the emerging seventeenth-century community\nof experimental philosophers. The success of Boyle\u2019s refutation of Line\u2019s\nthread hypothesis was consequentially determined by this tacit image.\nIn the next section, I will argue that this tacitly held, mathematical\nimage of the First Thing was, at root, a social image.\n5. Social Imagery and Early-Modern Science\nThe idea that knowledge is governed by an image \u2014 a social image \u2014 has\nhad an important, if somewhat underdeveloped, place in SSK. Indeed,\nDavid Bloor considered it so central that he gave his influential 1976\nintroduction to SSK the title Knowledge and Social Imagery. In this\nsection, I will discuss the relationship between Heidegger\u2019s mythical\nimage of the Galilean First Thing and Bloor\u2019s notion of social imagery.\nThis discussion will allow us to further explore, on the one hand, the\nsociological aspects of Heidegger\u2019s account of the emergence of early-\nmodern science, and, on the other hand, the theoretical insights which\nSSK may draw from that account.\nBloor argues that \u2018we think about knowledge by manipulating images\nof society.\u201996 A clear distinction must be drawn here between an image\n96 David Bloor (1991 [1976]), Knowledge and Social Imagery, 2nd edn (Chicago:\nUniversity of Chicago Press), p. 52. 6. Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 329\nof society and society itself. Bloor argues that society is too complex\nand overwhelming for us to understand it directly. As a consequence,\nwe must rely on simplified social models: \u2018Immersed as we are in\nsociety we cannot grasp it as a whole in our reflective consciousness\nexcept by using a simplified picture, an image, or what may be called\nan \u201cideology.\u201d\u201997 This image subsequently guides the way we come to\nthink about knowledge in general. Crucially, our manipulation of social\nimages need not be a conscious act. In other words, the connection\nbetween a theory of knowledge and a social image will often be a tacit\none. This means that social imagery will often serve as an analyst\u2019s\ncategory without also being an actor\u2019s category. According to Bloor, an\nanalyst should not limit her explanations to the consciously deployed\ncategories and concepts of those actors whose behaviour she is seeking\nto explain. She should also seek to uncover the social categories and\nconcepts which structure an individual actor\u2019s thoughts and actions\nat a tacit, or unconscious, level. One of the key targets of this method\nof excavation is the social imagery which may shape and guide actors\u2019\nthoughts and actions without their being aware of it.\nThe claim that social imagery guides actors\u2019 practices suggests that\nit plays a role similar to that of Aristotelian final causes. In other words,\nBloor\u2019s concept of social imagery appears to include a teleological\nelement. This introduces a potential tension into the comparison\nbetween Bloor\u2019s social imagery and the Heideggerian notion of the\nGalilean First Thing. Bloor strongly repudiates teleological forms of\nexplanation as being inimical to SSK: \u2018There is no doubt that if the\nteleological model is true then the strong programme is false.\u201998 Yet, this\napparent tension may be resolved once we recognise that the offending\naspects of what Bloor calls the \u2018teleological model\u2019 are absent from the\nnotion of the First Thing. These aspects are, first, that the teleological\nmodel entails the existence of \u2018purposive\u2019 behaviour, and, second, that\nthis behaviour is \u2018naturally oriented towards truth.\u201999 The worry, in\nthe first case, is that science is being treated as a process of \u2018mind or\n\u201cconsciousness,\u201d\u2019 rather than as a configuration of socially sustained\n97 Bloor (1991), Knowledge and Social Imagery, p. 53.\n98 Bloor (1991), Knowledge and Social Imagery, p. 12.\n99 David Bloor (1973), \u2018Wittgenstein and Mannheim on the Sociology of Mathematics,\u2019\nStudies in History and Philosophy of Science 4(2), 173\u201391 (pp. 178, 185). 330 Science as Social Existence\nmaterial practices.100 In the second case, the worry is that this allegedly\nmental process is directed towards a non-contingent (i.e., asocial and\nahistorical), or absolute, truth. As we have seen, SSK entails neither of\nthese claims. As we have also seen, the image of the First Thing likewise\nentails neither of these claims. As the basic blueprint of early-modern\nscientific practice, the First Thing can guide behaviour at a wholly tacit\nand non-deliberative level. Furthermore, the grounds for the First Thing\nare not absolute or necessary, but ultimately bottom out in the subject\u2019s\nshared, historically contingent tradition. Hence, Bloor\u2019s reservations\nwith respect to teleology do not apply in the case of the Galilean First\nThing.101\nHaving resolved this initial worry about a potential conflict between\nBloor\u2019s social imagery and the Heideggerian image of the First Thing,\nlet us now turn to the example Bloor offers to illustrate his explanatory\n100 Bloor (1973), \u2018Wittgenstein and Mannheim,\u2019 p. 174 n. 4; citing Popper.\n101 In respect of the second point, note that Bloor has more recently reiterated\nhis identification of \u2018telos\u2019 with a non-contingent \u2018inner necessity\u2019 guiding\nscientific practice (David Bloor (2011), The Enigma of the Aerofoil: Rival Theories\nin Aerodynamics, 1909\u20131930 (Chicago: Chicago University Press), p. 436). As for\nthe first point, the issue is similar to the one addressed in Chapter Four, where\nI argued that Bloor\u2019s identification of intentionality with mental content does\nnot touch a Heideggerian account of intentionality, which construes this in non-\nmental terms. That Heidegger did not espouse a teleological model, in Bloor\u2019s\nsense, is further attested in Michael Friedman\u2019s observation that \u2018[Ernst] Cassirer\u2019s\nphilosophy of symbolic forms [\u2026] diverges from Heidegger\u2019s existential analytic of\nDasein precisely in emphasizing a teleological development toward the genuinely\n\u201cobjective\u201d and \u201cuniversally valid\u201d realm of scientific truth\u2019 (Michael Friedman\n(2000), A Parting of the Ways: Carnap, Cassirer, and Heidegger (Chicago: Open Court),\np. 138). Friedman also notes the influence of Cassirer\u2019s anti-naturalistic teleological\nhistoriography on such historians of science as Edwin Arthur Burtt, Eduard Jan\nDijksterhuis, and Alexandre Koyr\u00e9 (Friedman (2000), A Parting of the Ways, p. 88;\nsee Edwin Arthur Burtt (1925), The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical\nScience: A Historical and Critical Essay (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner &\nCo.); Eduard Jan Dijksterhuis (1961 [1950]), The Mechanization of the World Picture,\ntrans. by C.

This historiographic\ntradition appears to be a central object of Bloor\u2019s criticism.

Drawing from Karl Mannheim\u2019s 1925 essay, \u2018Conservative\nThought,\u2019 Bloor attempts to uncover the social imagery influencing\nthe works of philosopher of science Karl Popper and historian and\nphilosopher of science Thomas Kuhn.102 In a nutshell, Bloor argues that\nPopper\u2019s account of scientific knowledge reflects an Enlightenment\nideology, while Kuhn\u2019s account of scientific knowledge reflects a\nRomantic ideology. These two ideologies represent two different images\naccording to which Popper and Kuhn organised, and thus made sense of,\nthe empirical data regarding modern scientific knowledge production.\nAs Bloor puts it, in the case of each thinker, \u2018the same facts are fitted\ntogether to form a different picture.\u2019103 In thinking about scientific\nknowledge, in developing an epistemology of scientific practice, Popper\nand Kuhn each manipulated a distinct image of society, and that social\nimage powerfully influenced the different ways in which they each\ncame to perceive the structure and dynamics of scientific knowledge.\nBloor gives considerable attention to the differences between\nPopper\u2019s and Kuhn\u2019s epistemologies, mapping them respectively onto\nthe more general cultural categories of Enlightenment and Romanticism.\nHere, however, I want to focus on one strong similarity between these\ntwo otherwise divergent accounts of scientific knowledge, as well as\na difference which then appears within this common perspective.\nAccording to Bloor, Popper and Kuhn shared a perception of science\nas the work of \u2018collectivities\u2019 or \u2018social wholes.\u2019104 In other words, both\nthinkers tended to view scientific practice in terms of bounded and\ncoherent spheres of social activity. However, each then goes on to\nanalyse social wholes in dramatically different ways. As Bloor writes,\nPopper treated social wholes as \u2018unproblematically equivalent to sets\nof individual units.\u2019105 Kuhn, in contrast, rejected such individualism.\nIn his work, \u2018[s]ocial wholes are not treated as mere collections of\nindividuals but are seen as having properties of a special kind, e.g.\ncertain spirits, traditions, styles and national characteristics.\u2019106 Hence,\n102 Karl Mannheim (1953 [1925]), \u2018Conservative Thought,\u2019 in Essays on Sociology and\nSocial Psychology, by Karl Mannheim, ed. by Paul Kecskemeti (London: Routledge),\npp. 74\u2013164.\n103 Bloor (1991), Knowledge and Social Imagery, p. 60.\n104 Bloor (1991), Knowledge and Social Imagery, pp. 62, 63.\n105 Bloor (1991), Knowledge and Social Imagery, p. 62.\n106 Bloor (1991), Knowledge and Social Imagery, p. 63. 332 Science as Social Existence\nwhile for Popper \u2018individuality is not bound up in society,\u2019 for Kuhn\n\u2018[i]ndividuals can only be understood in context.\u2019107 At root, this is a\ndisagreement over how to specify the subjectivity of the subject, over\nwhat it is to be a human being.\nPopper and Kuhn each approached scientific knowledge in terms\nof social wholes, but Popper treated those wholes as reducible to their\nindividual components, while Kuhn treated them as irreducible to those\nindividual components. At stake in this difference is the location of the\nprinciple or principles according to which a social whole is organised,\naccording to which it is viewed as a structured unit rather than an\nunruly shambles. For Popper, organising principles are uniformly\nlocated in the individual parts making up the whole.108 For Kuhn, they\ncannot be located in the individual parts but must instead be a property\nof the whole itself. According to Bloor, these divergent ontologies guide\nthe respective epistemologies of their authors, with Popper favouring a\nview of scientific knowledge as the property of individuals and Kuhn\na view of scientific knowledge as the property of groups. For present\npurposes, however, what is more important than this purported\ndisagreement is the shared belief of these two thinkers in the existence\nof identifiable and coherent social wholes. In this sense, when Popper\nand Kuhn thought about scientific knowledge, their thoughts were\nbeing guided by the same kind of social image, an image of the social\ngroup as an organised whole. As a consequence, they both also tended\nto view scientific knowledge in terms of organised wholes, whether of\nconcepts, practices, or a combination of both.\nThe implication of this is that the Enlightenment and Romantic\nideologies which Bloor used to develop his comparative study are, at\nleast in one important sense, not so different from one another. Indeed,\nthey appear to share a common root in an image of the social group\nas an organised and bounded whole. This conclusion is supported by\nMannheim\u2019s argument in the essay mentioned above, the essay on\nwhich Bloor modelled much of his discussion.\n107 Bloor (1991), Knowledge and Social Imagery, pp. 62, 63.\n108 I have elsewhere questioned Bloor\u2019s reading of Popper, arguing that Popper is\nmuch closer to being a communitarian epistemologist than is allowed for by Bloor\n(Jeff Kochan (2009b), \u2018Popper\u2019s Communitarianism,\u2019 in Rethinking Popper, ed. by\nZuzana Parusnikov\u00e1 and Robert S. Cohen (Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science\n272) (Berlin: Springer), pp. 287\u2013303). 6. Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 333\nMannheim addresses the same macro-sociological phenomenon as\ndid Zilsel \u2014 the historical transition from feudalism to capitalism \u2014 but\nhe picks it up at a later stage. Whereas Zilsel focussed on social changes\nduring the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, which he argues led to\nthe Scientific Revolution in the early seventeenth century, Mannheim\nfocusses instead on the emergence of conservative thought in the\nnineteenth century, presenting it as a response to the growing cultural\nhegemony of Enlightenment rationalism from the late eighteenth\ncentury onward. Like Zilsel, Mannheim analyses the usurpation of\nfeudalism by capitalism as a process of rationalisation.109 The process\nwas \u2018revolutionary and radical just because it want[ed] to rationalize the\nwhole social order right from the beginning in a systematic manner.\u2019110\nNineteenth-century conservative thought grew out of a widespread\nand deliberate resistance to this process. In the face of rationalisation,\nconservative thinkers made a deliberate effort to maintain and develop\nthe remnants of a pre-capitalist experience which had once been taken\nfor granted but was now threatened with extinction.111 This effort led to\nthe rise of the counter-revolutionary movement of Romanticism, which\n\u2018seized on the submerged ways of life and thought, snatched them from\noblivion, consciously worked them out and developed them further,\nand finally set them up against the rationalist way of thought.\u2019112 Thus,\nwhat Mannheim dubs \u2018romantic conservatism\u2019 included two steps.\nFirst, it sought to rescue and revitalise the remnants of a disappearing\npre-capitalist way of life. Second, it sought to actively articulate those\nremnants and develop them into an explicit and comprehensive project\nof intellectual resistance to Enlightenment rationalism. This second\nstep was above all motivated by a rejection of the perceived rigidity\nand linearity of Enlightenment thinking, which Romantic thinkers\nendeavoured to replace with a more dynamic and dialectical form of\nthought.113 Crucially, Mannheim argues that this second move reiterated,\nrather than abandoned, the faith of Enlightenment rationalism in\nthe power of reason to understand the world: \u2018romantic thought\n109 Mannheim (1953), \u2018Conservative Thought,\u2019 p. 85.\n110 Mannheim (1953), \u2018Conservative Thought,\u2019 p. 149.\n111 Mannheim (1953), \u2018Conservative Thought,\u2019 p. 115.\n112 Mannheim (1953), \u2018Conservative Thought,\u2019 p. 89.\n113 Mannheim (1953), \u2018Conservative Thought,\u2019 pp. 150\u201351. 334 Science as Social Existence\n(unintentionally perhaps) merely continues, though more radically,\nand with new methods, the same process which the Enlightenment\nhad already hoped to complete \u2014 the thorough rationalization of\nthe world.\u2019114 Mannheim uses the following analogy to illustrate the\nfundamental similarity, as well as the subsequent differences, between\nEnlightenment and Romantic thought:\nThe conservative picture of things as a whole is like the inclusive sort of\npicture of a house which one might get by looking at it from all possible\nsides, a concrete picture of the house in all its detail from every angle.\nBut the progressive is not interested in all this detail; he makes straight\nfor the ground plan [Grundriss] of the house and his picture is suitable\nfor rational analysis rather than for intuitive representation.115\nThe fundamental similarity between the two positions is their shared\nview that the world in its entirety can be captured in a \u2018picture of things\nas a whole,\u2019 a comprehensive image of everything that is. On the basis\nof this shared view, each position then employs a different method to\nrigorously work out the content of this world picture. The Enlightenment\nrationalist uses abstraction and systematisation to uncover the fixed\n\u2018ground plan\u2019 of the world. The Romantic thinker emphasises concrete\ndescription and the dynamic balance of competing forces in order to\ndisclose the organic unity of the world. By each pursuing a distinct\nideal of intellectual rigour, an ideal determined by standards internal\nto their own methods and experience, both rationalistic progressives\nand romantic conservatives aim to identify and define a comprehensive\npicture of the world construed as a whole.\nYet not every kind of conservativism depends on a conception of the\nworld as a whole. In addition to Romantic conservativism, Mannheim\nidentifies another form of nineteenth-century conservativism, which he\ndubs \u2018feudalistic conservatism.\u2019 This form followed only the first of the\ntwo steps characterising Romantic conservativism: that is, it consciously\nsought only to preserve and explicate elements of a pre-capitalist\n114 Mannheim (1953), \u2018Conservative Thought,\u2019 p. 153.\n115 Mannheim (1953), \u2018Conservative Thought,\u2019 p. 111. The bracketed text has been\ninserted from the German original (Karl Mannheim (1984 [1925]), Konservatismus.\nEin Beitrag zur Soziologie des Wissens, ed. by David Kettler, Volker Meja and Nico\nStehr (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp), p. 121). Note that Grundriss is the original term for\nboth Mannheim\u2019s concept of \u2018ground plan\u2019 and Heidegger\u2019s concept of \u2018one basic\nblueprint,\u2019 under which, I have argued, the First Thing may be placed. 6. Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 335\ntradition which, by that time, existed only on the periphery of society.116\nFeudalistic conservativism focusses its attention on the specific details\nof concrete practice, making little effort to integrate those details into an\noverall, coherent picture of the world. It resists the \u2018subsumption of the\nindividual and particular under one general principle\u2019 and so \u2018does not\nreally trouble itself with the structure of the world in which it lives.\u2019117\nUnlike Romanticism, feudal conservativism did not identify itself as a\ncounter-revolutionary response to Enlightenment rationalism. Hence,\nfeudalistic conservatives felt little compulsion to adopt, so as to then\nrenegotiate, the Enlightenment conception of the world as an object\nwhich could be accessed, as a whole, through the power of reason. In\naddition, their suspicion of theoretical abstraction, and their attention to\nconcrete practice, were \u2018exceedingly sober.\u2019118 They displayed no traces\nof the romantic tendency to conceptualise the world as a dynamic unity\nof competing, often non-rationalisable, life forces.\nOne upshot of Mannheim\u2019s argument is that, in addition to the\nEnlightenment and Romantic imagery Bloor discusses in his comparison\nof Popper and Kuhn, one can also add feudalistic conservativism. Unlike\nthe former two positions, feudalistic conservativism was not motivated\nby a need to identify and elaborate a picture of the world as a whole.\nIn this, it proves closer to a pre-Enlightenment intellectual tradition,\none which concerned itself with the description and explanation of the\nconcrete details of experience without attempting to integrate those\ndetails into one comprehensive and consistent whole. Hence, although\nMannheim was mainly concerned with the nineteenth century, when\nEnlightenment rationalism had become well-developed and culturally\ndominant, his comments on feudalistic conservativism point to an\nearlier period, in the seventeenth century, when proto-Enlightenment\nrationalism posed a still relatively weak threat to the dominant\nfeudalistic tradition.\nThese insights may now be applied to the dispute between Boyle\nand Line in the early 1660s. I want to suggest that this dispute can be\nunderstood as a conflict between an ascendant rationalism and a still-\ndominant feudalistic traditionalism. More to the point, I am suggesting\n116 Mannheim (1953), \u2018Conservative Thought,\u2019 p. 88.\n117 Mannheim (1953), \u2018Conservative Thought,\u2019 pp. 155, 103.\n118 Mannheim (1953), \u2018Conservative Thought,\u2019 p. 159. 336 Science as Social Existence\nthat Boyle represents the early impulses of a rationalism which pursued\na systematic model of the world as a whole, while Line represents the\nlate tendencies of a tradition which was intensely engaged with concrete\ndetail but had little interest in systematic analyses of a universalising\nscope. I want to make two arguments: first, that Bloor\u2019s concept of social\nimagery may be applied, in an illuminating but imperfect way, to this\nepisode in the history of science; and second, that Heidegger\u2019s account\nof modern science explains why the application of Bloor\u2019s concept must\nbe imperfect.\nThe application of the concept of social imagery to the dispute\nbetween Boyle and Line is imperfect because it is not symmetrical. If,\nas Bloor argues, a social image functions as a simplified model of the\nworld construed as whole, and if Line was a traditionalist who had no\nuse for such a model, then the concept of a social image will not be\nuseful in examining his case. In contrast, if Boyle represents, at least\nin this instance, an emerging culture of rationalism, then the concept\nshould apply in his case. Indeed, this asymmetry picks out one of the\nkey issues at stake in the dispute. This was the issue of what role a\nsimplified picture of things as a whole should play in the production of\nreliable experimental knowledge. Since, as Bloor argues, social imagery\noften guides an actor\u2019s thinking at a tacit level, the question of whether\nthe world can be systematically treated as whole need not have been\nsomething Boyle and Line deliberately addressed in their dispute.\nThe point is rather that we, as analysts instead of actors, may usefully\nilluminate the dispute in terms of this question.\nIn fact, the relevant analysis was already done in the last section.\nWhat I wish to pick out here with Bloor\u2019s concept of social imagery\nwas there picked out with Heidegger\u2019s concept of the one basic\nblueprint. In short, Heidegger\u2019s basic blueprint is an instance of Bloor\u2019s\nsocial imagery. Both concepts are meant to highlight the exclusivity\nof a style of thinking, the fact that the image or blueprint serves as a\ncomprehensive picture of things as a whole. I argued in the last section\nthat Boyle\u2019s thinking was guided by such an image, an a priori image in\nwhich the thingness of the thing was specified beforehand according to\nthe Galilean First Thing. If this image was furthermore a social image,\nin Bloor\u2019s sense, then it should follow that Boyle, when thinking about\nknowledge, was manipulating images of society. Indeed, this was one of 6. Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 337\nthe main points of Shapin and Schaffer\u2019s study. They argued that Boyle\u2019s\nepistemological concerns were, at root, concerns about social order,\nespecially, the problem of disorder caused by political controversy. To\nthis, I added the suggestion that the image of the First Thing served\nBoyle as a model by which to construct a clearly defined community of\nexperimental philosophers \u2014 a social whole \u2014 in which the dangers of\ncontroversy could be effectively managed.\nAs we have seen, Boyle, in his dispute with Line, defended the\nsufficiency of his own spring hypothesis against the challenge posed by\nLine\u2019s thread hypothesis. This defence appears to have been motivated by\nBoyle\u2019s assumption that the phenomena of the Torricellian experiment\ncould be subsumed under one general explanatory hypothesis. This\nepistemological assumption reflected Boyle\u2019s commitment to a\nsimplified model of society in which members took for granted a\nconsistent base of clearly defined principles and matters of fact. Line, in\ncontrast, appears to have taken a more eclectic view, allowing instead\nthat both his and Boyle\u2019s hypotheses were necessary for an explanation\nof the Torricellian phenomena. Underpinning Line\u2019s assumption was, it\nappears, not a commitment to a competing model of the social whole,\nbut rather a complacent disregard for the necessity of any such model.\nIt seems plausible that Line\u2019s epistemology, such as it was, reflected the\nprevailing feudal tradition \u2014 with its indifference towards simplified\nmodels of society \u2014 which was only just then beginning to face the\nchallenge of an ascendant, rationalistic conception of the world. Hence,\nthe dispute was not a conflict between two competing images of the\nsocial whole, but between Boyle\u2019s perceived need for such an image,\non the one hand, and Line\u2019s apparent indifference to that need, on the\nother.\nHowever, it was not the case that every follower of the feudal tradition\nwas indifferent to the threat posed by the new rationalism. In fact, at\nstake in this period were conceptions not just of society and nature, but\nalso of religion. This should not be surprising, as it is a commonplace\namong contemporary historians of science that conceptions of society,\nnature, and religion were, in Boyle\u2019s period, not easily separated. As\nthe historian Quentin Skinner has observed, Boyle insisted that his\nexperimental activity supported his religious faith because it provided\nevidence for the \u2018design\u2019 of the world. By demonstrating that nature 338 Science as Social Existence\nas a whole was created on the basis of a rational plan, Boyle hoped to\nprovide empirical grounds for the existence of a divine creator. \u2018L\u2019horloge,\ndonc l\u2019horloger,\u2019 notes Skinner, and then immediately adds: \u2018During the\nseventeenth century, however, this familiar trope of the Enlightenment\nwas still widely believed to carry alarming religious consequences.\u2019119\nOne such expression of alarm came from the Anglican cleric and\nhumanist M\u00e9ric Casaubon. In a letter \u2018Concerning Natural experimental\nPhilosophie, and some books lately about it,\u2019 published in 1669, Casaubon\ncriticised members of the Royal Society for claiming that religious\ncontroversies could be settled on the basis of \u2018plain reason.\u2019120 The nub\nof this worry was Casaubon\u2019s resistance to the idea that God\u2019s creation\ncould be understood in accordance with a basic blueprint, accessible to\nanyone possessing natural reason. As Michael Spiller remarks, Casaubon\nviewed this ambition as deluded and dangerous, because \u2018reality is too\nvastly complex, and human beings too corrupt, irremediably frustrated\nby recurring and permanent vices and frailties.\u2019121 Any attempt to know\nthe world as a whole was bound to fail, as nature outstrips finite human\nunderstanding, making controversy inevitable.\nIn this dispute over the nature of knowledge, the conflict was not\nabout what picture of the world to adopt, as it would be in the later feud\nbetween Enlightenment rationalists and Romantics, but instead about\nwhether or not a world picture should be adopted at all as an instrument\nin the acquisition of knowledge. As Spiller notes, Boyle was, at best, an\nuneasy accomplice in the development of early-modern rationalism.122\nYet, in his dispute with Line, Boyle appears to have been strongly\nmotivated by a simple and consistent conception of nature structured in\nterms of the Galilean First Thing. Line, for his part, appears to have been\n119 Quentin Skinner (2002), \u2018Hobbes and the Politics of the Early Royal Society,\u2019 in\nVisions of Politics, vol. 3: Hobbes and Civil Science, by Quentin Skinner (Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press), pp. 324\u201345 (p. 336).\n120 Reprinted in Michael R.

According to Richard Serjeantson, Casaubon \u2018had a strong fascination\nwith the natural world: as a young man he attempted some of the experiments in\nFrancis Bacon\u2019s Sylva sylvarum\u2019 (Richard W.

Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 339\nguided by no one picture at all, but instead by an eclectic willingness\nto blend together a variety of doctrines. Put in Heidegger\u2019s terms, only\nBoyle comported himself in a mathematical manner. In his dispute\nwith Line, Boyle\u2019s thinking and conduct exemplified the emerging\nmathematical projection which marked the historical and existential\ntransition from a medieval to an early-modern understanding of nature.\nHeidegger argues that \u2018[t]he world picture does not change from\nan earlier medieval one into a modern one, but rather the fact that the\nworld becomes picture at all is what distinguishes the essence of the\nmodern age.\u2019123 For Heidegger, the modern age, the age of modern\nscience, is, at base, the age of the world picture. He thus presents a\ntheory of scientific knowledge which applies only to the modern age.\nAccording to this theory, modern science is possible only on the basis of\na projected picture of the world as a whole. This projection is the a priori\ncondition of possibility for such knowledge. The subsequent pursuit of\nmodern scientific knowledge is conceived as the filling out, the rigorous\narticulation and refinement, of a picture of the world which has already\nbeen projected, albeit only generally and confusedly, in advance.124\nHeidegger\u2019s argument that thinking in terms of a world picture\nis a specifically modern development provides an opportunity to\nrefine Bloor\u2019s sociological claim that we think about knowledge by\nmanipulating images of society. Bloor writes that this is \u2018a theory about\nhow people think. The hypotheses are not alleged to be necessary\ntruths. [\u2026] Furthermore the range of application of the picture here\npresented has yet to be determined.\u2019125 On the basis of Heidegger\u2019s\ndiscussion of the world picture, as well as the above analysis of the\ndispute between Boyle and Line, we may now tentatively limit the\n123 Heidegger (1977a), \u2018The Age of the World Picture,\u2019 p. 130.\n124 Hans-J\u00f6rg Rheinberger suggests that Heidegger\u2019s term Weltbild (\u2018world picture\u2019)\n\u2018might be more appropriately translated as \u201c[\u2026] Planetary Configuration\u201d\u2019 (Hans-\nJ\u00f6rg Rheinberger (1997), Towards a History of Epistemic Things: Synthesizing Proteins\nin the Test Tube (Stanford: University of Stanford Press), p. 25 n. 6). This has the\nbenefit of emphasising the material aspect of the phenomenon, but it also seems\nto deflect attention from the projective role played by the subject in creating\nthat phenomenon, not to mention the intersubjective (social) labour required to\nmaterially extend it to, and sustain it on, a planetary scale. See also Hans-J\u00f6rg\nRheinberger (2010a), An Epistemology of the Concrete: Twentieth-Century Histories of\nLife (Durham: Duke University Press), p. 234.\n125 Bloor (1991), Knowledge and Social Imagery, p. 154. 340 Science as Social Existence\nrange of application of Bloor\u2019s theory to the modern era. SSK\u2019s method\nof analysing scientific controversies in terms of conflicting, often tacitly\nheld, pictures of society seems most applicable to modern controversies.\nThese conflicting pictures are images of society construed as a whole,\nimages which, in turn, motivate conceptions of knowledge construed\nas a whole. As human relations come, in the modern era, to be viewed\nin terms of social wholes, human knowing likewise comes to be\nviewed in terms of epistemic wholes. Hence, the modern problem of\norganising knowledge into a structured whole can be understood as\nthe modern problem of organising society into a structured whole.\nWhether actors view knowledge as a system of concepts \u2014 organised\naround basic principles of logic and definition \u2014 or as a system of\npractices \u2014 organised around basic principles of prediction and control,\nor credibility and power \u2014 in both cases, the SSK practitioner will seek\nto uncover the underlying social image held by the actors, along with\nthe basic principles around which that image is organised. However,\nin cases where groups of actors genuinely treat knowledge in a non-\nsystematic and eclectic way, the implication of Heidegger\u2019s argument is\nthat there will be no underlying image of a social whole which the SSK\npractitioner may uncover and then use to explain the actors\u2019 epistemic\nactivities. The sociologist may, in these latter cases, discover shared\nsocial interests, and use these to explain behaviour, but, if Heidegger\u2019s\nargument is correct, these interests will not be the components of a single,\nintegrated social image, a shared ideology or blueprint determined by a\nsingle coherent set of basic principles.\n6. Conclusion\nSome readers may feel that there is an elephant in the room which I have\nignored throughout this chapter. This alleged elephant is the mechanical\nphilosophy of the early-modern period. However, while far from being\nirrelevant, the mechanical philosophy is, in fact, largely peripheral to\nthe main concerns of this chapter. There is, then, no elephant in the\nroom. So why not talk about it?\nMechanism is usually contrasted with organicism, with the attendant\naccount of the Scientific Revolution then emphasising a transition in\nthe prevailing image of the world from an organic to a mechanical one. 6. Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 341\nWhat should be immediately clear, however, is that this difference\nin philosophical orientation \u2014 organistic versus mechanistic \u2014 is\nunderpinned by a shared impulse to grasp the world as a single,\nstructured whole. It is this shared impulse, rather than the difference\nbetween these two philosophies, which has been a central concern\nof this chapter. On this basis, we may reasonably doubt, for example,\nCarolyn Merchant\u2019s claim that \u2018[t]he rejection and removal of organic\nand animistic features and the substitution of mechanically describable\ncomponents would become the most significant and far-reaching\neffect of the Scientific Revolution.\u2019126 On the contrary, according to the\nargument presented here, the most far-reaching and significant effect of\nthe Scientific Revolution was the institutionalisation of a concept of the\nworld as a thing which is ordered \u2014 organised \u2014 according to a uniform\nmeasure, a basic blueprint. Both models of the world as a machine and as\nan organism reflect this institutionalisation, because both machines and\norganisms are, so we tend to think, discrete organised units, structured\nindividuals or wholes.127\nMerchant describes the Scientific Revolution as \u2018the transition from\nthe organism to the machine as the dominant metaphor binding together\nthe cosmos, society, and the self into a single cultural reality \u2014 a world\nview.\u2019128 She furthermore argues that the ancient notion of \u2018[t]he female\nearth was central to the organic cosmology that was undermined by the\nScientific Revolution.\u2019129 This may give the impression that the organic\ncosmology was itself an ancient institution, supplanted by a mechanistic\ncosmology in the early-modern period. However, Merchant also argues\nthat the doctrine of the world\u2019s \u2018organic unity\u2019 emerged in the late\nRenaissance, citing as evidence works published only in the second\nhalf of the sixteenth century, or later.130 Hence, it would appear that an\n126 Carolyn Merchant (1980), The Death of Nature: Women, Ecology and the Scientific\nRevolution (San Francisco: Harper & Row), p. 125.\n127 In 1940, Heidegger claimed that \u2018the idea of \u201corganism\u201d and of the \u201corganic\u201d is\na purely modern, mechanistic-technological concept\u2019 (Martin Heidegger (1976\n[1967]), \u2018On the Being and Conception of \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 in Aristotle\u2019s Physics B, 1,\u2019 Man and\nWorld 9(3), 219\u201370 (p. 234)). This claim is stronger, and more contentious, than is\nrequired for the present argument.\n128 Merchant (1980), The Death of Nature, p. xxii.\n129 Merchant (1980), The Death of Nature, p. xx.\n130 Merchant (1980), The Death of Nature, pp. 103\u2013126. Works cited include: Giovanni\nBattista della Porta\u2019s Magiae naturalis (published 1558); Bernardino Telesio\u2019s De 342 Science as Social Existence\norganic world picture may not have been a pre-revolutionary institution\nafter all, but rather a revolutionary challenger subsequently replaced\nby its equally revolutionary rival, the mechanical world picture. The\nancient notion of a female earth may well have been replaced along with\nits cosmological counterpart, but it does not follow from this that this\nancient notion represents a cosmology, an image of the world conceived\nas a whole.\nOn these admittedly fragile grounds, I tentatively suggest that the\nconflict between organic and mechanical philosophies was not a cause,\nbut rather a consequence, of the rise of early-modern science. This was\na struggle between two emergent conceptions of the world as a whole.\nIt thus presupposed that the world can be so conceived, that is, as a\nwhole. The institutionalisation of this presupposition was, I suggest,\none of the most significant and far-reaching effects of early-modern\nscientific culture. It entailed not just that things be conceived in terms\nof a uniform measure, but that the world itself also be so conceived,\nas a thing disciplined by a single measure, a uniform image, a basic\nblueprint.\nWe may thus question Elizabeth Potter\u2019s attempt to assimilate the\ndispute between Boyle and Line to the broader ideological dispute\nbetween mechanical and organic cosmologies. Potter attempts to slot\nLine\u2019s thread hypothesis into an organic philosophy, calling it a \u2018non-\nmechanistic assumption\u2019 which presupposes the idea of \u2018[a] World\nSpirit or Nature having consciousness and feelings.\u2019131 The implication\nis that Line conceived of the world as possessing consciousness and\nfeeling, that is, as being a living, sentient organism.\nPotter\u2019s argument follows Boyle\u2019s own by forcing a necessary\nconnection between Line\u2019s thread hypothesis and his affirmation of\nthe metaphysical doctrine of horror vacui. Yet, as I have argued, this\nconnection may also be viewed as contingent. Indeed, Boyle insisted on\nthe contingency of the relation between his own spring hypothesis and\nany further metaphysical doctrine. So why deny the same treatment to\nrerum natura iuxta propia principia (published 1565); Giordano Bruno\u2019s Spaccio de la\nbestia trionfante (published 1584); Tommaso Campanella\u2019s De sensu rerum et magia\n(published 1620). Note that all of these works appeared after Nicolaus Copernicus\u2019s\nDe revolutionibus orbium coelestium (published 1543), with which the beginning of\nthe Scientific Revolution is often credited.\n131 Potter (2001), Gender and Boyle\u2019s Law of Gases, p. 160. 6. Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 343\nLine? Furthermore, it is worth repeating that Line was obliged, as a Jesuit,\nto affirm the horror vacui. What is more, one may doubt whether this\ndoctrine, when affirmed by a Jesuit, was meant to slot into an organic\ncosmology which construed the world as a living, conscious being. This\nconstrual is much stronger than the more modest claim that nature acts\nto prevent a vacuum. In order to attribute this act to nature, one need not\nascribe to it consciousness and feeling. Like human activity, the activity\nof nature may be non-deliberative \u2014 as when an acorn grows into an\noak tree. When Boyle attributed an outward endeavour to corpuscles of\nair, he presumably had this non-deliberative notion of activity in mind.\nLine\u2019s thread hypothesis need not be treated any differently.\nIt is worth noting that Line was a skilled mechanician, with \u2018a\nreputation for ingenuity in the construction of timepieces,\u2019 especially\nsundials.132 Indeed, in his Brief Lives, compiled in the late seventeenth\ncentury, John Aubrey described Line as having constructed \u2018the\nfinest Dialls in the World,\u2019 and also as possessing \u2018great skill in the\nOptiques.\u2019133 On the basis of this reputation, Line was invited by Charles\nII to design and build a sophisticated sundial, ultimately comprised\nof 250 individual units, which was installed at Whitehall in 1669.134\nHence, although Line was evidently no mechanical philosopher, he\nwas certainly not unfamiliar with mechanical ways of thinking and\nworking. Moreover, Line\u2019s thread hypothesis might even be viewed in\nmechanical terms, since strings, lines, and threads seem, on a basic level,\nno less mechanical than springs. For example, Walter Charleton, elected\nto the Royal Society in 1663, gave substantial attention to threads in\nhis mechanical studies of attraction and adhesion. With attraction, he\nasked: \u2018Why therefore should we not conceive, that in every Curious\nand Insensible Attraction of one bodie to another, Nature makes use of\n132 Peter Davidson (2009), \u2018Francis Line S.

In fact,\nthere is compelling reason to think that Line was quite comfortable with\nmechanical ways of thinking, and very little reason to think that he was\ncommitted to an organic cosmology.\nMore generally, I have argued that the central dispute between Boyle\nand Line cannot be reduced to a contest between distinct world pictures\nor ideologies. Instead, this dispute focussed on two different ways of\nconceptualising the directedness of natural processes, particularly in\nthe context of the Torricellian experiment: either inward or outward.\nHowever, even this difference was not at the core of the dispute. At\nits centre, the dispute had instead to do with exclusivity versus\ninclusivity vis-\u00e0-vis the question of directedness. Boyle favoured an\nexclusive explanatory role for his spring hypothesis. Line, in contrast,\nsought only to win a legitimate place for his hypothesis alongside\nBoyle\u2019s own. He appears to have followed a piecemeal and pluralistic\napproach, incompatible with exclusivity, whereas Boyle was guided by\nan exclusive conception, a basic blueprint and uniform measure, of the\nthingness of things \u2014 what I have called the Galilean First Thing. As a\n135 Walter Charleton (1654 [1966]), Physiologia Epicuro-Gassendo-Charltoniana: Or\na Fabrick of Science Natural, Upon the Hypothesis of Atoms (New York: Johnson\nReproductions), pp. 344, 345.\n136 Boyle (1662), A Defence of the Doctrine Touching the Spring and Weight of the Air, p. 142. 6. Mathematics, Experiment, and the Ends of Scientific Practice 345\nconsequence, Boyle was, on my argument, a mathematical philosopher,\nwhile Line (a professor of mathematics in Li\u00e8ge) was not.\nThis argument entails a significant modification, but not a\nrejection, of Kuhn\u2019s distinction between early-modern mathematical\nand experimental traditions. While still describing distinct arenas\nof epistemic practice, these traditions should be viewed as the sub-\ntraditions of an emerging, broader early-modern tradition wherein\nthings came increasingly to be experienced according to a single,\nuniform measure. This homogenisation of thing-experience was\nmarked by a consolidation of the final causes of things under this one\nbasic measure. As a consequence, the proper place of the scientific\nthing \u2014 the end towards which it naturally moves in becoming what\nit is \u2014 was rendered qualitatively uniform. Early-modern experimental\nphilosophers did not, in practice, reject final causes in their attempts\nto understand the things of nature. Instead, what made their manner\nof working new was its dependency on a basic blueprint, a uniform\nprojection of the thingness of things. According to Heidegger, the\nexistential growth of this dependency was a defining feature of the\nmathematisation of early-modern science. This was a process whereby\nexperimental apparatus could now be reliably used to release the\nscientific thing from the external constraints which prevented it from\nrealising its own indigenous end. In other words, the experiment was\ndesigned to let the thing be what it is. Experimental art supported and\nsupplemented nature by helping the thing approach its proper place\nwithin a mathematically projected cosmos.  Chapter Seven\nConclusion: Subjects, Systems, and\nOther Unfinished Business\nHeidegger delivered his lectures on Galileo, Newton, and math\u0113sis\nduring the winter semester of 1935\u20131936. In the autumn of 1935, just\nbefore, or just as, this lecture course was getting started, Heidegger\nalso hosted, over the course of several days, a discussion by two\ndistinguished German scientists: the physiologist and physician Viktor\nvon Weizs\u00e4cker, and the physicist Werner Heisenberg. The discussion\ntook place in Heidegger\u2019s small cabin, perched on the slope of a\nmeadow above the Black Forest village of Todtnauberg. Also present,\namong others, was Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker, a nephew of the\nolder von Weizs\u00e4cker and a student of both Heisenberg and Niels\nBohr. The younger von Weizs\u00e4cker would later become a distinguished\nnuclear physicist in his own right. The meeting in Todtnauberg marked\nthe beginning of the younger von Weizs\u00e4cker\u2019s long friendship with\nHeidegger, one which lasted until Heidegger\u2019s death in 1976.\nAccording to von Weizs\u00e4cker\u2019s later recollection, the participants of\nthe meeting crowded around the narrow table in Heidegger\u2019s tiny living\nroom, with Heidegger seated at the table head, Viktor von Weizs\u00e4cker\nand Heisenberg on either side of him, and Carl von Weizs\u00e4cker at\n\u00a9 Jeff Kochan, CC BY 4.0 http://dx.doi.org/10.11647/OBP.0129.07 348 Science as Social Existence\nthe foot, facing Heidegger.1 The two scientists spoke at length with\none another, \u2018each interested in the other, but, in fact, separated by a\nchasm.\u2019 Heisenberg was deeply preoccupied with the \u2018abyss opened\nby the unsought after discovery of the inseparability of subject and\nobject in quantum theory,\u2019 but he felt one could not live in this abyss.\nHe insisted on \u2018a precise explanation of the role of the subject as\nobserver, as experimenter.\u2019 Viktor von Weizs\u00e4cker, in contrast, wanted\njust as badly to see the subject as a \u2018living object\u2019: \u2018He did not view the\nobjective observer of quantum theory as a subject at all.\u2019 When the two\nscientists had anchored themselves deep in mutual misunderstanding,\nHeidegger intervened.\n\u2018You, Mr. von Weizs\u00e4cker, seem to mean the following.\u2019 Three crystal\nclear sentences. \u2018Yes, that\u2019s exactly what I wanted to say.\u2019 \u2018And you, Mr.\nHeisenberg, probably mean this.\u2019 Three sentences of the same kind, and\nthe answer: \u2018Yes, that\u2019s how I picture it.\u2019 \u2018Then the relation could be the\nfollowing\u2019: Four or five short sentences. Both agreed: \u2018It could be like\nthat.\u2019 The dialogue continued until Heidegger had to help them out of\nthe next impasse.\nA year earlier, in 1934, when the young von Weizs\u00e4cker was working\nwith Bohr in Copenhagen, he bought a copy of Being and Time and\nread it alongside Kant\u2019s work. Although he had trouble understanding\nthe writings of both, he felt Heidegger came closer than any other\nphilosopher to the \u2018unsolved problems\u2019 he faced in his own work.2 Later,\nin a 1949 essay on the \u2018Relations of Theoretical Physics to Heidegger\u2019s\nThinking,\u2019 von Weizs\u00e4cker observed that \u2018the substantive separation of\nthe res cogitans and res extensa is the methodological presupposition of\nthe classical natural sciences in their entirety.\u2019 The methodological purity\nof these classical sciences forbids the mixing of the two. Furthermore,\nthe ideal of classical physics had been to speak only of one of the two\nCartesian substances: \u2018It should speak of the object as if there were no\nsubject whose object it is or can be.\u2019 With the new physics, in contrast,\na physicist who asks what the atom is \u2018has every reason not to repeat\nDescartes\u2019s error\u2019 by determining this \u2018is\u2019 in terms of the properties of\n1 Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker (1977a), \u2018Begegnungen in vier Jahrzehnten,\u2019 in\nErinnerung an Martin Heidegger, ed. by G\u00fcnther Neske (Pfullingen: Verlag Neske),\npp. 239\u201347 (pp. 239\u201340); my translations.\n2 von Weizs\u00e4cker (1977a), \u2018Begegnungen in vier Jahrzehnten,\u2019 pp. 240\u201341. 7. Conclusion: Subjects, Systems, and Other Unfinished Business 349\na discrete substance, but instead \u2018to follow Heidegger in questioning\nwhat \u201cbeing\u201d itself means.\u20193\nDespite Heidegger\u2019s impartial adjudication of the debate between\nthe older von Weizs\u00e4cker and Heisenberg, it is clear that the younger\nvon Weizs\u00e4cker viewed Heidegger\u2019s philosophy as directly (though not\nentirely) supportive of the new physics, and as directly critical of the\nclassical understanding exemplified by his uncle Viktor. Indeed, as we\nsaw in Chapter One, Heidegger traced the original impulse of modern\ntreatments of the subject as a \u2018living object\u2019 not just back to Descartes, but\nstill further back to Aristotle\u2019s definition of the human being as z\u014don logon\nechon, later interpreted to mean \u2018animal rationale,\u2019 a living thing capable\nof reason. In Chapter Four, we then saw how, according to Heidegger,\nthis ancient view was transformed (among other things, Christianised)\nwithin the framework of Descartes\u2019s substance ontology. The living\nthing becomes a discrete substance, an object with the properties of life\nand reason. By insisting that the subject be understood reductively as a\nliving object, Viktor von Weizs\u00e4cker appears to have been reproducing\nthe modern entanglement of Cartesian ontology and the methods of\nclassical science. The Cartesian subject continues to circulate beneath\nthe elder von Weizs\u00e4cker\u2019s commitment to an object ontology, asserting\nits presence through those deliberate methodological acts which,\nparadoxically, seek to erase it from the realm of legitimate scientific\ndiscourse. At least, this is how I imagine it would have looked from\nthe perspectives of Heidegger, Heisenberg, and Carl von Weizs\u00e4cker.\nOn the other hand, Heisenberg\u2019s insistence on the need for a precise\nexplanation of the scientific subject would have presumably looked to\nthe older von Weizs\u00e4cker like a regressive move threatening the basic\nmethodological presuppositions of established scientific method, and\nhence the prevailing norms of objective knowledge production.4\n3 C arl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker (1990 [1949]), \u2018Beziehungen der theoretischen\nPhysik zum Denken Heideggers,\u2019 in Zum Weltbild der Physik, 13th edn, by Carl\nFriedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker (Stuttgart: S.

This has involved the\ncombination of SSK with Heidegger\u2019s existential conception of science.\nThis combination is based, among other things, on the phenomenological\ndeconstruction of the Cartesian subject-object distinction in its entirety,\nrather than on the reductive collapse of the subject-side of the distinction\ninto its object-side.\nYet, from a certain perspective, this method may appear lamentably\nmisguided, as it insists on a necessary role for the subject. The first three\nchapters of this book considered a number of criticisms which appear\nto have been motivated by this perspective. Looking back, I would\nlike to suggest (not without mischief) that these criticisms may be\nlabelled as either conservative or liberal. Chapter One briefly addressed\nthe conservative criticism, and Chapters Two and Three addressed\nvariations of the liberal criticism. On my reading, the conservative feels\nthreatened by the thematisation of the subject because she believes\nthat the prevailing methods of science prohibit a place for subjects.\nInstead, she emphasises the strictly object-based nature of knowledge:\nthe subject must be suppressed in order to conserve the propriety of\nestablished scientific norms. The liberal, in turn, feels threatened by\nattention to the subject because she views this as a sly attempt to reassert\nthe authority of the subject-object distinction, and thus to re-impose\nan unwelcome and atavistic constraint on the recently won autonomy\nof the post-Cartesian scientific imagination. Despite their differences,\nboth criticisms mistakenly believe that a methodological orientation\nto the subject must be underpinned by an essentialist commitment to\nCartesian substance ontology.\nThe conservative critics mentioned at the beginning of Chapter\nOne accuse SSK practitioners of handling their alleged Cartesian\nVoraussetzungen in der Physik der Elementarteilchen,\u2019 in Martin Heidegger zum\nSiebzigsten Geburtstag.

Conclusion: Subjects, Systems, and Other Unfinished Business 351\ncommitment with incompetence. For these critics, the object-based\nmethod is meant to capture the independently existing object without\ninterference from the subject. SSK practitioners argue that this is not\npossible, because knowledge of the object necessarily implicates the\nknowing subject. The critics interpret this as scepticism about the\nexistence of an independent object of knowledge, or, put otherwise,\nscepticism about the fundamental separability of object from subject.\nThis is more generally framed as scepticism about the existence of the\nexternal world. This scepticism, so the critics say, results from SSK\u2019s\nincompetent failure to protect the object-side from corruption by the\nsubject-side of the Cartesian ontological schema. In other words, it\nresults from an incompetent failure to follow the established methods\nof classical science.\nI have argued that this criticism misjudges SSK in both motive\nand method. SSK practitioners deliberately seek to follow the\nmethodological conventions of science by affirming the existence of\nan external world. At the same time, however, they wish to radically\nreform the theory of knowledge arising from the Cartesian schema.\nThis attempted reform, I have suggested, has not been radical enough,\nand this has led to significant tensions in SSK\u2019s attitude towards\nexternal-world scepticism, tensions which have been effectively\nexploited by critics, conservative and liberal alike. I argued that SSK\ncan resolve these tensions by adopting Heidegger\u2019s phenomenological\ndeconstruction of the Cartesian schema, a move which explains the\nsubject-object distinction in terms of a more basic subject-world relation.\nNow the subject is no longer seen as a social substance gaining access\nto an external world, but as an entity whose basic modes of existence\ninclude being-in-the-world and being-with-others. With this move, an\naffirmation of the existence of an external world becomes meaningless,\nbecause the subject is not something to which a world can be external.\nThis move may be viewed as a preliminary answer to Heisenberg\u2019s call\nfor a more precise explanation of the scientific subject, the experimenter,\nfollowing the collapse of the orthodox subject-object distinction in the\nearly twentieth century.\nThe liberal critic of Chapter Two was Joseph Rouse, who accuses\nboth Heidegger and SSK practitioners of espousing a theory-dominant\naccount of science. I challenged this criticism in both cases, while 352 Science as Social Existence\nacknowledging that, in the case of SSK, Rouse makes some good\npoints. Indeed, he exploits the tensions just mentioned in order to\ncharge SSK with a \u2018vestigial commitment to epistemology.\u2019 By this he\nmeans a commitment to the Cartesian schema. According to Rouse,\nSSK practitioners seek to separate social and natural phenomena into\nautonomous domains, and they must then face the sceptical problem\nof how the constructive social domain achieves access to the natural\ndomain in the production of knowledge. Rouse reads this as an atavistic\nrecapitulation of the subject-object distinction, where the subject is a\nrelatively rigid social substance and nature the discrete object of its\nepistemic attentions. Yet, without claiming that SSK practitioners have\nslipped entirely free from this schema, I argued that Rouse dramatically\nsuppresses the not inconsiderable ways in which they have recognised\nthe instability and dynamism of the social realm.\nRouse\u2019s argument that Heidegger, too, espouses a theory-dominant\naccount of science is based on his claim that Heidegger\u2019s mathematical\nprojection of nature is a theoretical phenomenon. In particular,\nHeidegger\u2019s emphasis on this allegedly theoretical projection\npurportedly leads him to dismiss experimental practice as merely\nincidental to scientific activity. In response, I have argued, over several\nchapters, that Heidegger\u2019s mathematical projection is the existential\ncondition which makes modern scientific activity \u2014 both theoretical\nand experimental \u2014 possible. In his alternative proposal, Rouse turns\nthis explanatory model on its head, arguing instead that meaning-\nconstitutive scientific practices are, in fact, the condition of possibility\nfor existence. The existence of subjects and objects is to be explained\nby practices, and not the other way around. Hence, the explanatory\nrole of Heidegger\u2019s mathematical projection \u2014 as a historical mode of\nscientific subjectivity \u2014 is neutralised. In his proposed alternative to\nSSK, Rouse likewise seeks to dissolve the distinction between social\nsubject and natural object in an ever-circulating field of heterogeneous\nscientific practices. Here, too, the explanatory role of the social subject\nhas been neutralised.\nIn my view, such attempts to erase \u2014 rather than to deconstruct\nand transform \u2014 the traditional distinctions of subject and object,\nsociety and nature, mind and body, and theory and practice serve a\nparticular conception of freedom, one which regards such distinctions 7. Conclusion: Subjects, Systems, and Other Unfinished Business 353\nas placing an unnecessary and unwelcome constraint on the free play\nof intellectual analysis. Underpinning this conception is a particular\nidea of the human being. This is an idea which credits the human being\nwith an intrinsic ability to throw off the cognitive constraints of its social\nand historical circumstances, so as to achieve autonomy. It is, in other\nwords, an idea which directly challenges the finitude of human reason\nand imagination.\nThis brings us to the liberal critic of Chapter Three, Bruno Latour.\nMy analysis focussed narrowly on Latour\u2019s debate, in the 1990s, with\nDavid Bloor. In inviting his readers to take \u2018one more turn after the\nsocial turn,\u2019 Latour argued that the symmetry principle, a central tenet of\nSSK, uncritically reproduces the subject-object schema as formulated by\nImmanuel Kant. According to Latour, SSK is grounded in a distinction\nbetween a \u2018subject pole\u2019 and an \u2018object pole,\u2019 with all of SSK\u2019s explanatory\nresources being gathered around the subject pole, and none at all being\ndrawn to the object pole. He declares this asymmetrical, and proposes\nthat all explanatory resources should be removed from the subject\npole as well, leaving both the subject and the object equally useless\nin explanations of scientific knowledge production. Under this new,\nand allegedly more thoroughgoing, symmetry, the subject and object,\nsociety and nature, themselves become topics requiring explanation. As\nwith Rouse, they are to be explained in terms of fields of circulating\nscientific practice. Thus the explanatory significance of the social subject\nhas once again been neutralised.\nI argued that Latour, like Rouse, exploits genuine tensions in the\nSSK literature, but likewise exaggerates their significance, consequently\nsuppressing the extent to which SSK practitioners have sought to\nradically reformulate the orthodox subject-object distinction. In my view,\nto acknowledge such efforts would have compromised Latour\u2019s main\ngoal: to promote an unrestrained constructivity, stripped of its social\nand historical constraints, as the fundamental explanatory resource for\nstudies of science.\nI suggested that we can better understand what is at stake in the\ndebate between Bloor and Latour by considering Heidegger\u2019s own\nanalysis of the Kantian version of the subject-object distinction. Kant\nconstrues the object as a thing-in-itself. On Heidegger\u2019s reading, the\nthing-in-itself marks the extreme limit of human understanding. It is that 354 Science as Social Existence\naspect of nature which continually outstrips our correspondingly finite\nability to make sense of it, to draw it into the snare of our constructive\npower. The thing-in-itself thus represents independently existing\nnature, and so figures as a basic presupposition in the position I have\ncalled \u2018minimal realism.\u2019 Accordingly, I argued that Latour\u2019s attack on\nthe thing-in-itself amounts to a rejection of both minimal realism and\nthe finitude of human understanding. As a consequence, Latour may be\nviewed as embracing a concept of unrestrained constructivity, as well as\na position which I have dubbed \u2018pragmatic idealism.\u2019\nMy main goal in these concluding reflections is not to relaunch my\nearlier critique of the positive doctrines of these liberal critics, but instead\nto reemphasise the inadequacy of their alleged refutations of SSK and\nHeidegger\u2019s existential conception of science. They have not succeeded\nin refuting these positions because they have not properly understood\nthem. I will, nevertheless, offer the opinion that these critics have also\nfailed in their positive attempt to radically liberate themselves from\nthe subject-object distinction. Rather than superseding the informal,\nexistential root of this distinction (that is, our feeling of directedness\ntowards independently existing things), they have instead succeeded\nonly in suppressing it as a topic of analysis, and hence as a potential\nbasis for understanding science. As a result, these critics seem to grant\nfree licence to the subject\u2019s activities while simultaneously withholding\nthe conceptual tools by which to properly analyse and explain those\nactivities. This unfortunate circumstance may be viewed as a form\nof \u2014 perhaps unwitting \u2014 intellectual dissimulation: the concealment\nof a concept which, in fact, plays a central role in the position being\npromoted. This concealed concept is, of course, the concept of the\nsubject.\nIn contrast to this, Chapters Four, Five, and Six investigated the\nscientific subject as one side of a phenomenologically grounded\ndistinction between thinking and things. One central consequence of\nthis investigation has been to improve our understanding of the concept\nof scientific practice. The liberal dissimulation sinks the subject beneath\nthe surface of a smoothly functioning system of practices, thereby\nmasking the subject\u2019s crucial role in the constitution of those practices.\nThe reintroduction of the subject allows us to topicalise practices in a\nway discouraged by those who, paradoxically, promote practice as one\nof their primary explanatory resources. By topicalising practices, we can 7. Conclusion: Subjects, Systems, and Other Unfinished Business 355\ndevelop a better understanding of what practices are, and this, in turn,\nwill enable us to better control and apply the concept of practice as a\ncentral explanatory resource.\nThese considerations now allow us to segue back to Carl von\nWeizs\u00e4cker\u2019s reflections on Heidegger and post-classical physics. Von\nWeizs\u00e4cker felt that Heidegger\u2019s ruminations on the question of being\ncould guide him in his attempt to overcome the classical Cartesian image\nof the atom as a property-bearing substance. Heisenberg, in kind, was\nsearching for a new post-Cartesian understanding of the experimenter-\nsubject\u2019s role vis-\u00e0-vis the atom and other experimentally detectable\nobjects. As we have seen, Heidegger\u2019s question of being may be treated\nas a question about the meaning of the word \u2018being.\u2019 He argues that\n\u2018being\u2019 is a polysemous word, with connotations of both existence and\nessence, that-being and what-being. Hence, to ask about the being of the\natom is to ask both whether it is and what it is.\nI have argued that to assert the independent existence of a thing\nto which an experimental term refers is to be a minimal realist about\nthat thing; it is to assert that the thing is, that it exists. This assertion\nformally articulates, in propositional terms, our experience of that\nthing\u2019s independent existence, an experience grounded in our\nreceptivity towards, our ability to be affected by, that thing. On the\nbasis of this experience, we know that the thing is, but not what it is;\nwe can state whether it is, but not what it is. In contrast, being able\nto say what the thing is depends on our being able to experience it in\nits whatness as well as its thatness. This experience is grounded in our\nprojective understanding of the thing, our ability to make sense of it,\nto construct it as meaningful. This experience, too, may be formally\narticulated in propositional statements about what the thing is, about its\nessence. Such acts of articulation may, however, also be non-linguistic,\nas, for example, in the case of a laboratory set-up, constructed to let\nthe thing be what it is for the disciplined experience of an attentive\nobserver. That the experimenter\u2019s experience is disciplined points to\nthe sociological \u2014 in addition to the psychological, biological, and\ntechnological \u2014 conditions which give shape to that experience. For\nthis reason, topicalising the scientific subject invites the application of\npsychological, biological, technological, and sociological explanatory\nresources. 356 Science as Social Existence\nWe can now see how von Weizs\u00e4cker\u2019s question about the being of\nthe atom and Heisenberg\u2019s question about the role of the experimenting\nsubject come together. The that-being and what-being of the atom\ncorrelate, respectively, to the receptivity and constructivity of the\nscientific subject. Hence, in order to understand the being of the atom,\nwe must also investigate the structure of scientific experience. This is\nwhy Heidegger argued that the question of being points necessarily\ntowards the existential structure of the subject (Dasein), towards a\nphenomenological analysis of the subjectivity of the subject. As we\nhave seen, Heidegger\u2019s analysis picks out at least four basic, interrelated\ncharacteristics of that subjectivity: (1) being-in-the-world; (2) being-\nwith-others; (3) understanding; and (4) affectivity.\nIn Chapter One, the first characteristic was used to help SSK\npractitioners in their realist response to the external-world sceptic.\nAccording to Heidegger, being-in-the-world is a basic state of subjectivity\nwhen experienced in more immediate non-Cartesian and non-Kantian\nterms. But it is not the only basic state. The second characteristic \u2014 being-\nwith-others \u2014 is an equally basic aspect of subjectivity. Indeed,\nHeidegger writes that \u2018[t]he world of Dasein is a with-world [Mitwelt].\nBeing-in is Being-with Others.\u20195 However, Heidegger did not develop\nthis second characteristic of subjectivity as thoroughly as he did the first\ncharacteristic. I have used the insights and empirical studies of SSK to\nhelp mitigate this deficiency in Heidegger\u2019s work, first with respect to\nthe social foundations of logic, in Chapter Four, and then with respect\nto the emergence of early-modern experimental practice, in Chapter Six.\nCertainly a good deal more work could still be done in this area.\nThe third basic characteristic of subjectivity \u2014 understanding \u2014 has\nreceived ample attention throughout the preceding chapters. This\ncharacteristic picks out the fundamentally cognitive aspect of subjectivity,\nan aspect underpinning and enabling all knowledge, whether it be tacit\nor explicit, non-propositional or propositional, practical or theoretical.\nMuch attention has also been given to the changes-over from tacit to\n5 M artin Heidegger (1962a [1927]), Being and Time, trans. by John Macquarrie and\nEdward Robinson (Oxford: Blackwell), p. 155 [118]. (Following scholarly convention,\npage numbers in square brackets refer to the original 1927 German edition of Being\nand Time.) Cf. Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 163 [125]: \u2018So far as Dasein is, it\nhas Being-with-one-another as its kind of Being.\u2019 7. Conclusion: Subjects, Systems, and Other Unfinished Business 357\nexplicit, non-propositional to propositional, and practical to theoretical\nforms of cognition. For Heidegger, all of these changes-over occur\nagainst the continuous backdrop of the subject\u2019s elemental state of\nunderstandingly being in the world with others. As we have seen, a key\nstructure of this understanding is projection. Accordingly, Heidegger\nviewed the emergence of early-modern scientific practice and theory\nagainst the existential backdrop of a mathematical projection of the\nthingness of things. Understanding may thus be viewed in terms of the\nprojective constructivity of the subject.\nThe fourth basic characteristic of the subjectivity of the\nsubject \u2014 affectivity \u2014 has received comparatively little attention in this\nbook. Indeed, I directly addressed it only in Chapter Three, and again,\nmore briefly, in Chapter Four, as part of a discussion of the receptivity\nof the subject. The argument in Chapter Three was that Heidegger\u2019s\nconstrual of receptivity as affectivity grounds his reinterpretation (not\nrejection) of the Kantian thing-in-itself. Affectivity is thus a core concept\nof minimal realism. Things affect us, therefore they exist. I drew from\nclinical studies of anxiety to empirically support this claim.\nIn Chapter Four, we saw that Kant, in Heidegger\u2019s reading, recognised\nthe affective nature of receptivity in his phenomenology of respect for\nrules. The compulsive character of this respect provides an existential\ncondition of possibility for thinking and doing, for understanding,\nas such. Our affectivity vis-\u00e0-vis rules for understanding helps to\nexplain their normative power as guides for our thinking and doing.\nHowever, as we also saw, in Heidegger\u2019s account it is not towards the\nrules themselves that our respect is directed, but towards the persons,\nthe community, generating and sustaining those rules. On this basis,\nI developed the implications of Heidegger\u2019s phenomenology of rule-\nfollowing by joining it with the more empirical work of SSK, summed\nup in Bloor\u2019s observation that \u2018[w]e are compelled by rules in so far as\nwe, collectively, compel one another.\u20196\nHowever, unlike in the case of being-with-others, SSK can offer few\nresources for developing Heidegger\u2019s meagre account of the affective\ndimension of scientific subjectivity. Indeed, against the backdrop of\nHeidegger\u2019s claim that \u2018Dasein-with is already essentially manifest in a\n6 D avid Bloor (1997b), Wittgenstein, Rules and Institutions (London: Routledge), p. 22. 358 Science as Social Existence\nco-affectivity and a co-understanding,\u2019 we may judge SSK to have been\nfar more concerned with co-understanding than with co-affectivity.7\nThis is a serious deficiency, one also reflected in the pages of this\nbook. Despite the substantial attention which has already been given\nto changes-over in understanding, these changes-over will never be\nproperly understood until comparable attention has been also given\nto the corresponding changes-over in affectivity. Although Heidegger\nargued that \u2018[u]nderstanding always has its mood,\u2019 and although he\nrecognised \u2018[t]he fact that moods can [\u2026] change over,\u2019 he gave scarcely\nany attention to the affective structure of cognitive changes-over in\nunderstanding.8 For their part, SSK practitioners have likewise failed\nto produce studies systematically focussed on the affective aspect of\nscientific knowledge production.\nI view this deficiency as \u2018unfinished business,\u2019 and thus as an\ninvitation for future research. Accordingly, the remainder of this chapter\nwill point forward, towards areas where valuable scholarly work might\nstill be done. In moving forward, then, let us begin by first looking back,\none last time, to Carl von Weizs\u00e4cker\u2019s reflections on Heidegger and\ntwentieth-century science. Despite his high regard for Heidegger, von\nWeizs\u00e4cker also points to deficiencies in Heidegger\u2019s knowledge of the\nnatural sciences. Von Weizs\u00e4cker\u2019s criticism hinges on Heidegger\u2019s later\nreflections, from the 1940s onward, on the relationship between modern\nphysics and modern technology, and so carries us beyond the scope of\nHeidegger\u2019s earlier work, which has been the main focus of this book.\nLet us review some of Heidegger\u2019s later reflections before considering\nvon Weizs\u00e4cker\u2019s criticism.\nIn 1953, Heidegger presented a lecture, published in 1954 as \u2018The\nQuestion Concerning Technology,\u2019 in which he argued that \u2018[t]he\nmodern physical theory of nature prepares the way [\u2026] for the essence\nof technology,\u2019 and that it does so because it \u2018pursues and entraps\n[stellt] nature as a calculable coherence of forces.\u20199 The implication is\n7 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 205 [162]; translation modified.\n8 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, pp. 182 [143], 173 [134].\n9 Martin Heidegger (1977b [1954]), \u2018The Question Concerning Technology,\u2019 in The\nQuestion Concerning Technology and Other Essays, by Martin Heidegger, trans. by\nWilliam Lovitt (New York: Harper & Row), pp. 3\u201335 (pp. 22, 21); my brackets. Cf.\nMartin Heidegger (1954a), \u2018Die Frage nach der Technik,\u2019 in Vortr\u00e4ge und Aufs\u00e4tze, by\nMartin Heidegger (Pfullingen: Verlag G\u00fcnther Neske), pp. 9\u201340 (p. 25). 7. Conclusion: Subjects, Systems, and Other Unfinished Business 359\nthat modern physics paves the way for modern technology, because\nit \u2018entraps\u2019 nature. However, \u2018entraps\u2019 is a misleading translation of\nstellen, which typically means \u2018to place.\u2019 Indeed, just a few lines earlier,\nHeidegger had made clear that stellen, in his specialised usage, reflects\ntwo different meanings: first, an \u2018ordering which challenges forth\u2019 (das\nherausfordernde Bestellen); second, a \u2018producing which brings forth\u2019 (das\nhervorbringende Her-stellen).10 He states that these two meanings are\n\u2018fundamentally different, and yet they remain related in their essence.\u201911\nThe word \u2018entraps\u2019 emphasises the first meaning of stellen, and suppresses\nthe second. To more succinctly express this first meaning, Heidegger\nproposes the word Ge-stell, typically translated, for this purpose, as\n\u2018enframing.\u201912 As the essence of modern technology, enframing places\nnature in a frame, just as \u2018entrap\u2019 means to place something in a trap.\nTo more succinctly express the second, contrasting meaning of stellen,\nHeidegger uses the ancient Greek word poi\u0113sis, which is meant to\nsignify the kind of the non-modern technical production typical of art,\npoetry, and handicraft.13 Heidegger thus denotes the double meaning\nhe ascribes to stellen by the concepts of enframing and poi\u0113sis.\nAs just mentioned, Heidegger states that these two meanings\nare fundamentally different, but he also says that they are related\n\u2018in their essence.\u2019 They are essentially related because \u2018[b]oth are\nways of revealing.\u201914 For Heidegger, revealing means \u2018com[ing] into\nunconcealment.\u201915 This may be glossed as a thing\u2019s being moved,\nmetaphorically, from hiddenness or concealment, and placed in the\nlight. Revealing thus means \u2018illuminating,\u2019 rendering a thing intelligible\nor understandable as what it is. According to Heidegger, enframing and\npoi\u0113sis are two fundamentally different ways in which this is done, two\nfundamentally different ways in which a thing is \u2018placed\u2019 in the light of\nprojective understanding.\n10 Heidegger (1954a), \u2018Die Frage nach der Technik,\u2019 p. 24. Cf. Heidegger (1977b), \u2018The\nQuestion Concerning Technology,\u2019 p. 21.\n11 Heidegger (1977b), \u2018The Question Concerning Technology,\u2019 p. 21.\n12 Heidegger (1977b), \u2018The Question Concerning Technology,\u2019 p. 19. In ordinary usage,\nGestell usually means \u2018frame,\u2019 \u2018rack,\u2019 or \u2018shelf.\u2019\n13 Heidegger (1977b), \u2018The Question Concerning Technology,\u2019 p. 10.\n14 Heidegger (1977b), \u2018The Question Concerning Technology,\u2019 p. 21.\n15 Heidegger (1977b), \u2018The Question Concerning Technology,\u2019 p. 11. 360 Science as Social Existence\nIf placing a thing in the light of understanding means putting it in its\nproper place, the place where it may be encountered as what it is, then\nenframing and poi\u0113sis each suggest fundamentally different conceptions\nof a thing\u2019s proper place, and hence also of its whatness. While this is\nnot how Heidegger explicitly described the difference, the grounds for\nsuch an interpretation have already been established in Chapters Five\nand Six, with the discussions of math\u0113sis and final causation. In Chapter\nFive, I argued that we need the concept of a final cause in order to make\nsense of the artful manipulation of things. The final cause explains the\norder and meaning of such manipulations, grounds their intelligibility,\nthereby distinguishing them from random, unstructured behaviour. It\nthus plays a necessary role in any comprehensive account of practice. It\nexplains how a practice realises its completion in a finished thing, how\nthe practice lets the thing become what it is. In Aristotelian terms, to\nlet a thing become what it is means to guide it to its proper place in the\ncosmos. A practice may thus be viewed as an act of placing, regulated\nby a final cause. There will be as many final causes as there are proper\nplaces in the cosmos.\nIn Chapter Six, I laid out Heidegger\u2019s account of the mathematisation\nof early-modern science in terms of math\u0113sis, a process whereby final\ncauses become consolidated under a single, uniform measure. This\nuniform measure is the one final cause, the basic blueprint, regulating\nthe early-modern experimental manipulation of nature. Under the\nguidance of this basic blueprint, the prevailing conception of the\nthingness, or whatness, of things is rendered uniform. As a consequence,\nthe scientific thing now has only one proper place in the cosmos, and\nthere is thus only one general way of properly \u2018placing\u2019 it in that cosmos,\nof letting it be what it is. Under these circumstances, the scientific thing\nis illuminated or revealed \u2014 experienced as intelligible \u2014 in the light of\na single, homogenous understanding.\nI want to now suggest that, as two different ways of placing things in\nthe light of understanding, enframing and poi\u0113sis are guided, respectively,\nby homogenous and heterogeneous pictures of place. Enframing is\na homogenous revealing; poi\u0113sis is a heterogeneous revealing. With\nenframing, then, the world is experienced in light of a single, uniform\npicture. With poi\u0113sis, by contrast, the world is experienced in light of\nmultiple diverse pictures. 7. Conclusion: Subjects, Systems, and Other Unfinished Business 361\nHeidegger calls enframing a \u2018challenging revealing,\u2019 as well as\nan \u2018ordering revealing.\u201916 His idea seems to have been that enframing\nchallenges or orders things \u2014 forcibly places, or frames, them \u2014 into a\nsingle, homogenous picture, in light of which we may then experience\nthem as what they are. In this way, \u2018[e]nframing [\u2026] blocks poi\u0113sis,\u2019\nprevents us from encountering things in the heterogeneous light of\nmultiply different pictures.17\nOn the face of it, this seems like not such a bad thing when it comes\nto scientific practice. For example, standardised terminologies and\nmethods allow for effective cooperation between differently situated\nlaboratories. In this sense, homogenous revealing may be viewed as\na strength of modern science. Natural scientists are able to coordinate\nwith one another, and to build on one another\u2019s results, because they all\ninhabit, so to speak, the same general picture. Homogenous revealing\nallows for a productive co-understanding of nature among members of\nthe scientific community. However, Heidegger also observes that this\nstrength carries with it a danger, because the modern physical theory of\nnature \u2018prepares the way\u2019 for enframing: \u2018Modern physics is the herald of\nEnframing.\u201918 His idea seems to have been that modern science proffers\na standardised form of understanding which, when transported out of\nthe realm of scientific practice, and into the broader realm of human\nsociety, poses a threat to the diverse range of understandings which\nare presumably integral to the well-being of that broader society. What\nstands as a strength in science proves to be a weakness in society in\ngeneral. Modern machine technology provides the physical medium by\nwhich the homogenous revealing of modern science becomes suffused\ninto society as a whole. However, as I suggested at the end of Chapter\nSix, the fact that machine technology should have provided this medium\nseems a matter of social and historical contingency. Whether one\nunderstands society in terms of a machine or in terms of an organism,\none is, in both cases, conceptualising it as a whole, in light of a single,\nuniform picture. And it is this homogenisation of understanding which\nsits at the core of Heidegger\u2019s worries about scientific and technological\nmodernity.\n16 Heidegger (1977b), \u2018The Question Concerning Technology,\u2019 pp. 16, 19.\n17 Heidegger (1977b), \u2018The Question Concerning Technology,\u2019 p. 30.\n18 Heidegger (1977b), \u2018The Question Concerning Technology,\u2019 p. 22. 362 Science as Social Existence\nA significant question, which Heidegger leaves unanswered, is why\nthis homogenisation should at all take place. Assuming Heidegger\u2019s\naccount is correct, then how should society in general have become, or\nnow be under threat of becoming, wholly enframed by the homogenous\nrevealing peculiar to the comparatively small community of modern\nscientists? This question is perhaps best left to historians and\nsociologists of science and technology. From the perspective presented\nhere, however, their answers should give consequential attention\nto the role of subjectivity in the process. In this regard, Heidegger\noffers a phenomenological clue when he refers to the \u2018irresistibility\nof ordering.\u201919 Because the co-understanding giving shape to modern\nscience is irresistible, its application beyond the scientific realm will\nalso be experienced, increasingly, as irresistible or compelling. Hence,\nalternative experiences of nature will be blocked, among them, and most\nimportantly, the experience enabled by the heterogeneous revealing of\npoi\u0113sis. In some highly speculative comments, Heidegger suggests that\nthe irresistibility of enframing may somehow lead to its own dissolution,\nby bringing to light an \u2018as yet unexperienced [\u2026] saving power.\u201920 This\nsaving power will allow for a return to the heterogeneous revealing\nof poi\u0113sis. Heidegger then wonders: \u2018Could it be that the fine arts [\u2026]\nmay expressly foster the growth of the saving power [\u2026]?\u2019 This, then,\nis his highly tentative answer to the perceived threat of enframing. In\nconcluding his speculations, Heidegger does not argue that, but instead\nwonders whether, the fine arts may furnish the necessary \u2018restraint\u2019 by\nwhich to counter the irresistibility of enframing. He thus leaves the\nquestion concerning technological enframing unresolved.21\n19 Heidegger (1977b), \u2018The Question Concerning Technology,\u2019 p. 33.\n20 Heidegger (1977b), \u2018The Question Concerning Technology,\u2019 p. 33.\n21 Heidegger (1977b), \u2018The Question Concerning Technology,\u2019 pp. 35, 33. Andrew\nFeenberg has developed Heidegger\u2019s suggestion that the fine arts may facilitate\nresistance to enframing (Andrew Feenberg (2005), Heidegger and Marcuse: The\nCatastrophe and Redemption of History (London: Routledge). I have critiqued\nFeenberg\u2019s proposal from an SSK perspective (Jeff Kochan (2006), \u2018Feenberg and\nSTS: Counter-Reflections on Bridging the Gap,\u2019 Studies in History and Philosophy of\nScience 37(4): 702\u201320). Feenberg has responded to this criticism (Andrew Feenberg\n(2006), \u2018Symmetry, Asymmetry, and the Real Possibility of Radical Change: A\nReply to Kochan,\u2019 Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science 37(4), 721\u201327).\nHarry Collins and Trevor Pinch have thrown their hats into the debate as well\n(Harry M. Collins and Trevor Pinch (2007), \u2018Who Is to Blame for the Challenger\nExplosion?,\u2019 Studies in History and Philosophy of Science 38(1), 254\u201355). Wiebe Bijker 7. Conclusion: Subjects, Systems, and Other Unfinished Business 363\nThere is much to contend with here. For present purposes, however,\nlet us limit ourselves to von Wiezs\u00e4cker\u2019s response to Heidegger.22 Von\nWeizs\u00e4cker argues that Heidegger was right to identify enframing as\n\u2018the signature of our time.\u2019 Nevertheless, Heidegger\u2019s own reflections\non enframing were handicapped, he writes, because \u2018Heidegger was\nunable to think the natural sciences through to their base.\u2019 In von\nWeizs\u00e4cker\u2019s view, the reason that an alternative to enframing has\nnot yet presented itself \u2018lies in the fact that the path of science has\nnot yet reached its end.\u201923 As a physicist, von Weizs\u00e4cker felt himself\nobliged to follow scientific understanding to its conclusion, and he\nexpressed mild optimism that an alternative would be thus disclosed,\nwhile he remained sensitive to the risk and uncertainty of the venture:\n\u2018The saving power is already intangibly present here in the middle of\nthe world of tangibility. The prospecting and trespass of paths in the\ndanger is accessible through planning and is therefore an obligation.\u201924\nThe \u2018planning\u2019 to which von Weizs\u00e4cker refers seems to deliberately\ndepend on empirical-causal analysis guided by the homogenising\nrevealing of enframing. He describes enframing as \u2018the deconstruction\nof reality in conceptual acts of imagination, and the attempt to\nreconstruct the whole as the sum of interacting parts.\u201925 For him, the\nand Trevor Pinch cite this exchange as exemplifying debates over whether SSK (and\nits offshoot, the social construction of technological systems, or SCOTS) provide\ngrounds for a political critique of science and technology (Wiebe E. Bijker and\nTrevor Pinch (2012), \u2018Preface to the Anniversary Edition,\u2019 in The Social Construction\nof Technological Systems: New Directions in Sociology and History of Technology (25th\nAnniversary Edition), ed. by Wiebe E. Bijker, Thomas P. Hughes and Trevor Pinch\n(Cambridge, MA: MIT Press), pp. xi\u2013xxxiv (p. xxvii n. 3)).\n22 For my part, I have responded to Latour\u2019s Heideggeresque claim that modern\nscience \u2018transform[s] society into a vast laboratory\u2019 by arguing that the field sciences\noffer an alternative model, one contrary to the epistemic imperialism implicit in\nLatour\u2019s laboratory model (Bruno Latour (1983), \u2018Give Me a Laboratory and I Will\nRaise the World,\u2019 in Science Observed: Perspectives on the Social Study of Science, ed. by\nKarin D. Knorr-Cetina and Michael Mulkay (London: SAGE), pp. 141\u201370 (p. 166)). I\ngloss the subjectivity of this alternative in terms of \u2018epistemic neighbourliness\u2019 (Jeff\nKochan (2015d), \u2018Objective Styles in Northern Field Science,\u2019 Studies in History and\nPhilosophy of Science 52, 1\u201312).\n23 Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker (1977b), \u2018Heidegger und die Naturwissenschaft,\u2019\nin Der Garten des Menschlichen: Beitr\u00e4ge zur geschichtlichen Anthropologie, by Carl\nFriedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker (Munich: Carl Hanser Verlag), pp. 413\u201331 (pp. 431, 413\u2013\n14, 427); my translations.\n24 von Weizs\u00e4cker (1977b), \u2018Heidegger und die Naturwissenschaft,\u2019 p. 431.\n25 von Weizs\u00e4cker (1977b), \u2018Heidegger und die Naturwissenschaft,\u2019 p. 431. 364 Science as Social Existence\n\u2018whole\u2019 to be deconstructed and reconstructed includes the subject.\nHe writes that \u2018[t]he reflexive or phenomenological self-awareness\nof the subject can be supported or corrected by the causal insight of\nthe natural sciences.\u201926 The idea seems to be that subjectivity should\nbe drawn within the frame of a world picture, where it will then be\nanalytically deconstructed and reconstructed in a process which will,\nso von Weizs\u00e4cker hopes, ultimately disclose a mode of understanding\nwhich enables \u2018restraint\u2019 in the face of the \u2018irresistibility\u2019 of enframing.\nWhere Heidegger saw the path from enframing back to poi\u0113sis as\ntravelling through the fine arts, von Weizs\u00e4cker saw it as travelling\nmore deeply into the natural sciences, or, more specifically, more\ndeeply into the dynamics of enframing itself. Indeed, he even named\nthe scientific field most likely to yield this result: \u2018[t]his conceptual\nreconstruction of a whole is today called systems theory.\u201927 For him, an\nanswer to the danger posed by modern technological thinking lies in\nthe direction of systems theory, the scientific discipline of cybernetics.\nVon Weizs\u00e4cker argues that in order to understand the conditions\nof possibility for modern science and technology, that is, in order to\nunderstand the origins of enframing, we must investigate \u2018the basic\ncondition of possibility for conceptual thinking as such.\u201928 In other words,\nthe focus of his proposed system-theoretic investigation of enframing is\nsquarely centred on an understanding of the subjectivity of the subject.\nThe subject is to be viewed in cybernetic terms, as an entity existing\nwithin a self-regulating system. And this system, in turn, is to be viewed\nin ecological terms, as the physical surroundings in which conceptual\nthinking, as such, emerges, stabilises, and evolves. Von Weizs\u00e4cker\u2019s\nhope was that cybernetics will discover the \u2018fundamental laws\nformulat[ing] the way and manner by which a conceptual-empirical\nthinking of what is can be the case.\u2019 More specifically, these laws will\ndescribe the logic of objective experience, that is, the rules governing\n\u2018the correctness of behaviour [a]s adaequatio ad rem, adaptation to the\nconditions of the ecological niche.\u201929 In a nutshell, then, von Weizs\u00e4cker\nproposed a cybernetic theory of normativity.\n26 von Weizs\u00e4cker (1977b), \u2018Heidegger und die Naturwissenschaft,\u2019 p. 429.\n27 von Weizs\u00e4cker (1977b), \u2018Heidegger und die Naturwissenschaft,\u2019 p. 431.\n28 von Weizs\u00e4cker (1977b), \u2018Heidegger und die Naturwissenschaft,\u2019 p. 429.\n29 von Weizs\u00e4cker (1977b), \u2018Heidegger und die Naturwissenschaft,\u2019 pp. 428, 429. 7. Conclusion: Subjects, Systems, and Other Unfinished Business 365\nAlthough von Weizs\u00e4cker comments that Heidegger had never tried\nto dissuade him from his interest in cybernetics, Heidegger did, in fact,\notherwise express clear scepticism about cybernetics in his later work,\nespecially in respect of what he understood to be that theory\u2019s account\nof subjectivity. In an essay from the late 1960s, Heidegger writes that\n\u2018the new fundamental science that is called cybernetics [\u2026] corresponds\nto the determination of man as an acting social animal [handelnd-\ngesellschaftliches Wesens].\u201930 The translation of this passage could be\nmisleading. The word \u2018acting\u2019 possesses a more neutral connotation\nthan does handelnd. It simply means to take action, without specifying\nthe nature of that action. Hence, it is closer to the German word t\u00e4tig.\nThe word handelnd, in contrast, also carries connotations of \u2018dealing\u2019\nand \u2018trading,\u2019 and thus may carry a distinctly economic hue. The word\n\u2018social,\u2019 in turn, can mean \u2018gregarious\u2019 or \u2018sociable,\u2019 much like the German\nword gesellig. The word gesellschaftlich, on the other hand, may also be\ntranslated as \u2018societal\u2019 or \u2018corporate.\u2019 It thus suggests an organised\nbody of individuals, rather than an individual who is simply disposed\nto engage with others. In Heidegger\u2019s view, then, cybernetics begins\nwith an inappropriately narrow conception of the human being, one\nseemingly influenced by economic and corporate models of rationality\nand exchange. He was especially concerned about the influence\nof cybernetics on prevailing conceptions of language: \u2018Cybernetics\ntransforms language into an exchange of news.\u201931 In 1975, the year before\nhis death, Heidegger wrote that \u2018[t]he ascending dominion of linguistics\nand of the information sciences threatens to drive the efforts of thinking\nand poetizing and their great traditions out of human eyesight.\u201932 Hence,\nfor Heidegger, cybernetics offered little hope for salvation in the face of\n30 M artin Heidegger (1993c [1969]), \u2018The End of Philosophy and the Task of Thinking,\u2019\ntrans. by Joan Stambaugh, in Basic Writings, revised and expanded edn, by Martin\nHeidegger, ed. by David Farrell Krell (New York: HarperCollins), pp. 431\u201349 (p.\n434); my brackets.

Similar statements about\ncybernetics may also be found in Martin Heidegger (1998), \u2018Traditional Language\nand Technological Language,\u2019 trans. by Wanda Torres Gregory, Journal of\nPhilosophical Research 23, 129\u201345. 366 Science as Social Existence\nthe perceived threat of enframing. Indeed, by apparently eclipsing the\npoetical and contemplative aspects of human experience \u2014 by blocking\npoi\u0113sis \u2014 cybernetics seemed, for Heidegger, to powerfully exemplify\nthe very phenomenon of homogenous revealing characteristic of\nenframing.33\nWhereas von Weizs\u00e4cker\u2019s theory of normativity puts the system at\nits centre, Heidegger\u2019s theory puts the subject at its centre. Nevertheless,\nthe root difference between their respective theories lies in their\ncontrasting interpretations of the subject. In my view, von Weizs\u00e4cker\nimplicitly advances a theory of the subject which makes necessary a\nsystems-theoretic account of normativity. Heidegger, in contrast, does\nnot. In order to more clearly understand this difference, it will be useful\nto revisit two concepts introduced in Chapter Six, those of the Galilean\nFirst Thing and of the world picture.\n33 Andrew Pickering consistently obscures Heidegger\u2019s identification of enframing\nwith homogenous revealing, first by claiming that Heidegger actually draws\na sharp distinction between the two, and then by identifying enframing with\n\u2018asymmetric domination\u2019 and revealing with \u2018performative and open-ended\ndances of agency\u2019 (Andrew Pickering (2009), \u2018The Politics of Theory: Producing\nAnother World, With Some Thoughts on Latour,\u2019 Journal of Cultural Economy 2(1/2),\n197\u2013212 (pp. 205, 204)). On this infelicitous base, Pickering introduces labels for\ntwo distinct kinds of cybernetics: \u2018authoritarian enframing,\u2019 on the one hand, and\n\u2018liberal democratic revealing,\u2019 on the other (Andrew Pickering (2010), The Cybernetic\nBrain: Sketches of Another Future (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), passim).\nHe then promotes the second as a politically attractive alternative to the first. This\nuneven conceptual terrain makes it difficult to properly address, in a short space,\nthe relation of Pickering\u2019s account to the present discussion. Suffice to observe\nthat, whatever the attractions of Pickering\u2019s alternative, his description of liberal-\ndemocratic cybernetics as the \u2018levelling of power relations\u2019 and the placement\nof all subjects \u2018metaphysically [\u2026] on a single and level playing field\u2019 seems to\nsuggest the homogenous revealing of enframing (Pickering (2010), The Cybernetic\nBrain, pp. 384, 393). On this view, swapping one uniform political blueprint for\nanother, whatever the benefit, reshuffles the deck of enframing rather than rejects\nit. Note that the distinction between authoritarian and democratic technology\nhas a long history in technology studies (Andrew Feenberg (1992), \u2018Subversive\nRationalization: Technology, Power, and Democracy,\u2019 Inquiry 35(3/4), 301\u201322;\nOtto Mayr (1986), Authority, Liberty & Automatic Machinery in Early Modern Europe\n(Baltimore: John Hopkins University Press); Lewis Mumford (1964), \u2018Authoritarian\nand Democratic Technics,\u2019 Technology and Culture 5(1), 1\u20138; and Langdon Winner\n(1980), \u2018Do Artifacts Have Politics?,\u2019 Daedalus 109(1), 121\u201336). Carol Steiner has\nstaged an imaginary dialogue between Pickering and Heidegger (Carol J. Steiner\n(2008), \u2018Ontological Dance: A Dialogue between Heidegger and Pickering,\u2019 in The\nMangle in Practice: Science, Society, and Becoming, ed. by Andrew Pickering and Keith\nGuzik (Durham: Duke University Press), pp. 243\u201365). 7. Conclusion: Subjects, Systems, and Other Unfinished Business 367\nRecall that the Galilean First Thing is a thing left entirely to itself, to\nbe at rest, or to move uniformly in a straight line, without interference\nfrom without. Newton formalised this concept in the First Law, which\ninterprets the thing, fundamentally, as a law-abiding thing. Note that this\nimage, of a thing left entirely to itself, negates the necessity of a system\nto which that thing belongs as a constituent part. This situation changes,\nhowever, when seventeenth-century experimental philosophers\nbegin to consider the thing as existing in a world also inhabited by\nother things. Robert Boyle and his colleagues, as we saw, viewed the\nexperimental thing as endeavouring to beat back its neighbours, so as to\nopen up around itself an autonomous space, a space in which to achieve\nits native independence. One puzzle which seems to arise from such\na conception of things is that of the order among things: if things are\nfundamentally disposed to seek their independence from one another,\nthen why are we not now faced with a world of disjointed chaos? I\nwant to suggest that the concept of system emerged as an answer to\nthis question. The order we observe is not to be explained in terms of\nindividuals, but in terms of an organised whole in relation to which\nthose individuals stand as constitutive parts. Order is a property of the\nwhole, irreducible to the part. This ordered whole is a system. Insofar\nas this system possesses the principle of its own organisation, it is a self-\norganising system. While the individual strives to move itself towards\nautonomy, the system strives to move itself towards order, equilibrium.\nAutonomy and equilibrium thus figure as the respective final causes of\nthe individual thing and the system. The latter explains the presence\nof order left unaccounted for by the former. The world pictured as a\nself-regulating system thus offsets the threat of world disorder implied\nin the thing conceived as an autonomous individual.34\nIf, however, one conceives of the thing in a different manner, one\nsuggesting relative order among things rather than potential chaos,\n34 Mayr notes that the idea that the \u2018discord of individuals [\u2026] contribute[s] to a\nconcord of the whole\u2019 was already much discussed in the seventeenth century, but\nonly acquired an adequate explanation a century later with the concept of the self-\nregulating system (Mayr (1986), Authority, Liberty & Automatic Machinery, p. 185).\nAccording to Mayr, \u2018[w]hat won the concept such popularity was its promise of\nlinking the values of equilibrium and liberty\u2019 (p. 188). The concept would reach full\ndevelopment only in the twentieth century, with the arrival of cybernetics theory (p.\n187). 368 Science as Social Existence\none will then require no additional concept of system to explain order.\nOrder among things will instead be the result of things regulating\nthemselves, rather than of things being the constituents of a discrete,\nself-regulating system. Indeed, in 1950, three years before presenting\n\u2018The Question Concerning Technology,\u2019 Heidegger presented to the\nsame audience a lecture entitled \u2018The Thing,\u2019 which was published\ntogether with the later lecture in 1954. He was evidently involved in\na further reconceptualisation of the thing during the same period in\nwhich he was developing his critique of enframing.35\nHeidegger\u2019s alternative conception of the thing is a strange one.\nHe grounds it in an old Germanic meaning for \u2018thing\u2019 as \u2018gathering.\u201936\nFurthermore, when a thing \u2018does its thing,\u2019 that is, when it subsists as a\ngathering, we may say \u2014 employing an obsolete English usage, meaning\n\u2018to reconcile\u2019 \u2014 that the thing things, that it brings reconciliation in the\nform of a gathering. What does the thing, by thinging, gather together?\nAccording to Heidegger, it gathers together earth, sky, gods, and\nmortals in a unitary \u2018fourfold.\u2019 This gathered fourfold, in turn, makes\na \u2018world\u2019 possible. Heidegger writes: \u2018The thing stays \u2014 gathers and\nunites \u2014 the fourfold. The thing things world.\u201937\nIn developing this self-consciously poetical account of the thing, the\nlater Heidegger uses the example of a wine jug \u2014 a vessel or \u2018stowage\u2019\n(Gef\u00e4\u00df) in which to \u2018stow\u2019 (fassen) wine.38 To pour wine for someone is\nto \u2018bestow\u2019 (schenken) it on them, and the result of this bestowing is a\n\u2018bestowal\u2019 (Geschenk, or \u2018gift\u2019). This bestowal lets the jug be what it is qua\njug. The bestowing of wine gathers together, in the same moment \u2014 in\n35 S ee Martin Heidegger (1971b [1954]), \u2018The Thing,\u2019 in Poetry, Language, Thought, by\nMartin Heidegger, trans. by Albert Hofstadter (New York: Harper & Row), pp.\n165\u201386. The audience for the two lectures was the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts.\nIn fact, earlier versions of both lectures were presented together, on the same day,\nin 1948, to the Club at Bremen. See the introductory note in Heidegger (1977b), \u2018The\nThing,\u2019 pp. ix\u2013x.\n36 H eidegger (1971b), \u2018The Thing,\u2019 p. 177.\n37 H eidegger (1971b), \u2018The Thing,\u2019 p. 181.

The normally intransitive verb verweilen is put to unconventional transitive\nuse in this passage, thus exacerbating attempts at translation. In this context, the\nword also suggests \u2018temporalises\u2019 and, translating more freely, \u2018harbours.\u2019\n38 H eidegger (1954b), \u2018Das Ding,\u2019 pp. 158\u201366; my translations. Cf. Heidegger (1971b),\n\u2018The Thing,\u2019 pp. 166\u201374. 7. Conclusion: Subjects, Systems, and Other Unfinished Business 369\none bestowal \u2014 the earth and sky, gods and mortals. In this moment,\nwith the bestowed wine, one experiences the earth\u2019s nutrients and the\nsky\u2019s sun and rain. One also experiences the mortals whose thirst the\nwine slakes, and, when it is offered as a libation, the gods whom it\nhonours. Crucially, Heidegger argues that the bestowing of wine as a\nlibation is the \u2018true\u2019 (eigentliche) bestowal.39 Through this act the jug is\nlet be what it essentially is. The gods are apparently the fundamental\nfor-the-sake-of-which of the wine jug in the context of use, the principal\nreason for the jug\u2019s being what it is.\nThis claim may be more fully unpacked by returning to \u2018The Question\nConcerning Technology,\u2019 where Heidegger discusses a ceremonial bowl.\nDrawing on Aristotle\u2019s doctrine of the four causes in order to explain\nthe whatness of the bowl, Heidegger writes the following.\nBut a third cause remains above all responsible for it. It is that which\nlimits the bowl beforehand within a realm of dedication and offering.\nThrough this, the bowl is defined [umgrenzt] as a sacrificial implement.\nThat which defines brings the thing to an end. With this end the thing\ndoes not finish, but rather, from it, the thing begins to be what, following\nits manufacture, it will be. Bringing-to-an-end, consummation, in this\nsense, is what the Greeks called telos, which one all too often translates,\nand thus misconstrues, as \u2018goal\u2019 and \u2018purpose.\u201940\nJust as the jug is truly let be what it is in the act of pouring a libation\nfor the gods, so too the bowl is, above all, let be what it is in an act\nof dedication and offering, presumably also directed towards the gods.\nThat for the sake of which a thing is enrolled in a practice is the final\ncause, the ultimate meaning and end, of that thing. As I argued in\nChapter Five, this end is the norm governing the thing\u2019s proper usage.\nA thing is thus defined by its directedness towards that end.\nYet, as I furthermore argued in Chapter Six, the experimental\nthing is also defined by its directedness towards an end, namely, the\nstate of pure autonomy represented by the Galilean First Thing. In\nmy view, the difference between the two conceptions lies in the fact\nthat this autonomy, as an end, stands as the only end, the singular\nbasic blueprint, for the thingness of things in general. In contrast, on\n39 H eidegger (1954b), \u2018Das Ding,\u2019 p. 165. Cf.

Heidegger\n(1977b), \u2018The Question Concerning Technology,\u2019 p. 8. 370 Science as Social Existence\nHeidegger\u2019s alternative conception the final cause according to which\nthe thingness of things is determined is presented as plural \u2014 \u2018the\ngods\u2019 \u2014 rather than as singular. It is, in other words, a heterogeneous\nrather than a homogenous conception. Furthermore, Heidegger\u2019s\nalternative is couched in terms which seem to resist formalisation, in\nmuch the same way as the term \u2018heap,\u2019 which we considered at the\nbeginning of Chapter Five.41 Although a plurality of gods may be\nthematised as a mytho-poetical pantheon, it will nevertheless resist\nformalisation as a system. Heidegger presumably felt that a Newtonian\nrationalisation of the fourfold is not possible, because rationalisation\ndemands homogenisation (in this case, monotheism) in order to avoid\ncontradiction. Viewed through the lens of Heidegger\u2019s late reflections,\none might see the Galilean First Thing as a god which has successfully\nbeaten back the other gods, thereby establishing itself as an autonomous\nand uniform measure for the mathematicisation of nature.\nBut let us bring Heidegger\u2019s mytho-poetical phenomenology back\ndown to a more concrete level. I suggest that it may still be possible to\nproceed scientifically on the basis of Heidegger\u2019s comments. My proposal\ninvolves reading Heidegger\u2019s late reflections in light of his earlier views\non final causation and the subjectivity of the subject, as discussed in\nChapter Five. Recall Heidegger\u2019s claim that the final causes guiding and\nregulating practice ultimately bottom out in the existential possibilities\nof the subject, possibilities which comprise its historical tradition. I\npropose to view Heidegger\u2019s concept of the gods as a mytho-poetical\nthematisation of these basic existential possibilities, and I wish to argue\nthat these possibilities \u2014 this tradition \u2014 may instead be thematised\nin terminology more suited to historical and sociological analysis.42 In\n41 I ndeed, as Miles Burnyeat has shown, the paradox of the heap has been also used\nto undermine the attempted rationalisation of conceptions of the gods (Miles F.\nBurnyeat (1982), \u2018Gods and Heaps,\u2019 in Language and Logos, ed. by Malcolm Schofeld\nand Martha Craven Nussbaum (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), pp.\n315\u201338). Note, also, Heidegger\u2019s 1962 comment that \u2018a poem does not [\u2026] let itself\nbe programmed\u2019 (Heidegger (1998), \u2018Traditional Language and Technological\nLanguage,\u2019 p. 141).\n42 F or arguments that Heidegger\u2019s concept of the gods can be reinterpreted in\nsociological terms, see: Jeff Kochan (2010b), \u2018Latour\u2019s Heidegger,\u2019 Social Studies of\nScience 40(4), 579\u201398 (p. 592); Charles Spinosa (2000), \u2018Heidegger on Living Gods,\u2019\nin Heidegger, Coping, and Cognitive Science: Essays in Honor of Hubert L. Dreyfus, ed.\nby Mark A. Wrathall and Jeff Malpas (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press),\npp. 209\u201328 (p. 216); and Julian Young (2006), \u2018The Fourfold,\u2019 in The Cambridge 7. Conclusion: Subjects, Systems, and Other Unfinished Business 371\nthis regard, it is important to also recall the normative role played by\nfinal causes: such causes provide the measure by which practitioners\ndistinguish proper from improper action, thereby giving order and\ndirection to their activities. Hence, to respect the rules governing one\u2019s\nactions means to respect the existential possibilities comprising one\u2019s\nshared historical tradition. By respecting these possibilities, as manifest\nboth in one\u2019s own actions as well as in the actions of others, one sustains\nand gives shape to the tradition. In this way, the subject is its possibilities.\nMoreover, as being-in-the-world, as one who historically constructs and\nexperiences meaning in the world, the subject also always experiences\nand pursues its possibilities in conjunction with others, as being-with-\nothers. Meaning-constitutive action is thus, necessarily, both social and\nhistorical action, because the source and cause of that action \u2014 the\nsubject \u2014 is social and historical.\nHeidegger\u2019s gods may thus be viewed in terms of the historical\npossibilities for meaning-constitutive action available to persons who\nshare and sustain a tradition. Furthermore, these possibilities are\nexperienced as more or less compelling. We feel compelled to follow\ncertain possibilities for action, rather than others, because they have\nnormative force for us, because we view them as good rather than\nbad, proper rather than improper. As I argued above, this feeling of\ncompulsion is the existential condition of possibility for understanding\nas such. We understand because we can be affected, and thus also\nguided, by the rules which structure that understanding. As I also\nargued above, as well as earlier in Chapter Four, according to both\nHeidegger and SSK, our receptivity to rules, in particular, and a\ntradition, more broadly, is, at base, a receptivity to each other. As Bloor\nsays, \u2018[w]e are compelled by rules in so far as we, collectively, compel\none another.\u201943 Within this phenomenological constellation, which\ndetermines the subjectivity of the subject, being-in-the world, being-\nwith-others, and understanding combine with affectivity in order to\nproduce an experience of intelligibility, or cognitive order. Heidegger\u2019s\ngods are thus a mytho-poetical marker for the affective component of\nhuman subjectivity. Indeed, Heidegger describes the gods as providing\nCompanion to Heidegger, 2nd edn, ed. by Charles B. Guignon (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press), pp. 373\u201392 (p. 375).\n43 Bloor (1997b), Wittgenstein, Rules and Institutions, p. 22. 372 Science as Social Existence\nthe basis for \u2018every affective disposition [wesentliche Gestimmtheit]\nfrom respect and joy to mourning and terror.\u201944 The affectivity and the\nsociality of the subject combine in a mutual receptivity which enables it\nto projectively understand its environment as an ordered world.\nFor both Heidegger and SSK, cognitive order is grounded in social\norder, and social order is, in turn, produced in micro-social interactions\nbetween mutually receptive subjects who both compel and defer to\none another in (and often by manipulating bits of) a common material\nenvironment. We might call this an \u2018interactionist theory of normativity,\u2019\nin contrast to von Weizs\u00e4cker\u2019s cybernetic theory of normativity. The\nnorms governing behaviour are not, finally, to be located in a system,\nof which each person is a constitutive part, but in the often mundane\ninteractions between persons who, to a greater or lesser extent, share\na history and culture. Whether or not these interactions achieve a level\nof consistency and stability allowing for their reification as a \u2018system\u2019\nwill be a matter for empirical investigation. But, if such were the case,\nthen it would be important to remember that this system is, in fact, a\nsimplification, a reification, a matter of conceptual art and convenience,\nrather than a fundamental statement about the nature of normativity,\nmuch less the ontology of groups.\nInteractionism is SSK\u2019s social theory of choice, and has been discussed\nat length by Barry Barnes.45 An interactionist social theory puts the\nindividual subject at the methodological centre of explanations of social,\nand thus also of cognitive, order. According to this theory, the subject\ndoes not eschew interaction, beating away its neighbours in pursuit of\nits own autonomy, but instead seeks to interact with them as a matter\nof natural necessity. This is the sociological equivalent of Heidegger\u2019s\nclaim that being-with-others is a fundamental characteristic of the\nsubjectivity of the subject. A natural disposition to interact with others\nis, however, not yet an explanation of social order. Barnes argues that\n44 M artin Heidegger (1992 [1982]), Parmenides, trans. by Andr\u00e9 Schuwer and Richard\nRojcewicz (Bloomington: Indiana University Press), p. 106, my brackets.

Conclusion: Subjects, Systems, and Other Unfinished Business 373\nthis disposition is accompanied by \u2018the readiness of the individual to\nalign her cognition with that of others and co-ordinate her activities\nwith theirs.\u201946 This is an innate orientation towards cooperation with\nothers, but not towards conformity to rules. According to Barnes, a\nperson\u2019s natural gregariousness does not constrain her to a fixed social\norder, but rather facilitates her participation in a \u2018form of life.\u201947 This is\nthe sociological near equivalent of Heidegger\u2019s claim that being-with-\nothers is a necessary (but not a sufficient) condition of the subject\u2019s being\nable to make sense of things, to project a space of intelligibility \u2014 a\nworld \u2014 in which things may be encountered as what they are. Put\nanother way, gregariousness plays a necessary role in revealing, in\nopening up a world of understanding.\nFrom this it follows that enframing \u2014 homogenous revealing \u2014 may\nbe experienced as the opening up of a world within which action becomes\npossible, rather than as an external constraint on action. However, so\nHeidegger worries, the existential basis for this freedom to act, its\ncondition of possibility, is ontologically limited. From an interactionist\nperspective, in such a world, the subject\u2019s natural gregariousness is\nincreasingly guided into an intersubjective alignment of cognition and\nco-ordinated action which may allow for considerable freedom, but\nonly within a limited cognitive and material domain, a domain in which\nalternative existential possibilities have been blocked or suppressed.\nHeidegger\u2019s later work thematises, or topicalises, the phenomenology\nof this situation. SSK provides the resources by which to explain it.\nOn an interactionist account, the homogenising impulse of enframing\nis to be explained by reference to the micro-social interactions through\nwhich enframing is produced and sustained. Enframing does not have\n46 Barnes (1995), The Elements of Social Theory, p. 102.\n47 Barnes (1995), The Elements of Social Theory, p. 103. In a welcome step beyond his\nearlier work, discussed in Chapter Two, Joseph Rouse now defends an account\nof normative practice which appears, in its essentials, very similar to Barnes\u2019s\nolder and sociologically more detailed account: \u2018a practice is [\u2026] held together\nby the interactions among its constitutive performances\u2019 (Joseph Rouse (2015),\nArticulating the World: Conceptual Understanding and the Scientific Image (Chicago:\nUniversity of Chicago Press), p. 163). Note, however, Rouse\u2019s reference to\ninteracting performances, not performers, a difference in focus reflecting his\ncontinuing attempt to neutralise the subject as an explanatory resource. It is a small\nintellectual tragedy that Rouse\u2019s earlier misreading of SSK should now blind him to\nthe benefits of positively enrolling SSK in the elaboration of his own interactionist\ntheory of normativity. 374 Science as Social Existence\na life of its own, existing independently of people, and exercising an\nexternal power over them, but must instead be explained reductively\nin terms of the interactions of those people. As Barnes notes, this\nmethodological point may be difficult to square with immediate\npersonal experience.\nFor a single involved individual, norms may still be experienced as\nhaving a fixed meaning beyond her own discretion and as pressing on\nher judgement like an external force. This is just one of many instances\nof the fact that what is created and controlled collectively may be\nexperienced as given and coercing individually, and what is actually\nthe power of many other people may be experienced individually as a\npower external to people altogether.48\nThe basic idea is that enframing \u2018does not carry us along but rather [\u2026]\nwe carry it along.\u201949 The same insight may also be applied to systems:\nthe system does not carry us along, we carry it along. We are compelled\nby the system only insofar as we, collectively, compel one another.50\nOn this basis, an interactionist theory of normativity turns a systems\ntheory of normativity on its head. Von Weizs\u00e4cker proposed that a\nsystems-theoretic deconstruction and reconstruction of \u2018reality\u2019 would\nyield the \u2018fundamental laws\u2019 which govern the ecological conditions of\npossibility for conceptual thinking. He thus characterised the subject\nas being carried along in a system whose law-like regularities enable\nconceptual understanding. The interactionist account reverses this,\narguing that the aligned cognition and co-ordinated action \u2014 that is, the\nco-understanding \u2014 of subjects may enable a shared experience of the\nworld as a single, integrated system, a coherently organised reality. If\na person experiences this world picture as compelling, it is not because\nthe picture itself is compelling, but because the person is aligned with\nothers who deem it a good thing to feel compelled by that picture, and\nso actively encourage the person to feel so compelled. The community\n48 Barnes (1995), The Elements of Social Theory, p. 75.\n49 Barnes (1995), The Elements of Social Theory, p. 112.\n50 I n a discussion of Heidegger and science studies, Steiner reads the later Heidegger\nas claiming that \u2018when we understand Being as the nil source of our knowledge,\n[\u2026] then what we know is no longer under our control. [\u2026] All that remains to\nmove on to the path to primordial Being is to embrace the mystery\u2019 (Carol J. Steiner\n(1999), \u2018Constructive Science and Technology Studies: On the Path to Being?,\u2019 Social\nStudies of Science 29(4), 583\u2013616 (p. 589)). I will reserve judgement on whether this\nfairly represents Heidegger\u2019s later views. My task here is to use SSK to demystify\nexplanations of this kind, a task I view as compatible with Heidegger\u2019s earlier work. 7. Conclusion: Subjects, Systems, and Other Unfinished Business 375\ncompels the person to feel compelled by the picture. In so doing, the\ncommunity carries the picture along.\nThis attention to feelings of compulsion evinces the deep relationship\nbetween co-understanding and co-affectivity. Von Weizs\u00e4cker viewed\nthe systems-theoretical reassembly of subjectivity as an \u2018obligation.\u2019 For\nhim, the path of science must be pursued to its end. Such statements tell\nus something about the particular mode of co-affectivity characteristic of\nvon Weizs\u00e4cker\u2019s own scientific community. In these final paragraphs, I\nwant to suggest that much exciting work could still be done investigating\nsuch modes of scientific co-affectivity.\nHere, too, SSK can offer guidance, with Barnes\u2019s interactionist\nelaboration of Max Weber\u2019s concept of \u2018status groups,\u2019 an elaboration\nwhich puts at its centre the emotional susceptibility to one another\nof group members.51 A status group arises when a number of people\ncome together on the basis of a characteristic, or \u2018good,\u2019 which they\nshare in common, and which they simultaneously use to exclude\nfrom membership those who fail to uphold that good. This dynamic\nof inclusion and exclusion defines a field of legitimate competition:\ngroup members may compete with one another for status within the\ngroup, while those excluded are disqualified from such competition.\nThe criterion which determines inclusion in and exclusion from the\ngroup will be a matter of historical contingency. However, the dynamic\nholding group members together, in accordance with the relevant,\ncontingent criterion, is, Barnes suggests, a matter of necessity.52 Indeed,\nthis fundamental dynamic forms the basis of human sociality; it is a\nnecessary characteristic of the subjectivity of the subject, comparable to\nHeidegger\u2019s being-with-others.\nMoreover, also in step with Heidegger, Barnes argues that the\nsociality of the subject necessarily combines with affectivity: \u2018we convey\nto each other signals of praise and blame, approval and disapproval,\nrecognition or rejection, honour or contempt, socially organised to\nsustain the collective good, and our susceptibility to these signals is what\n51 B arry Barnes (1992b), \u2018Status Groups and Collective Action,\u2019 Sociology 26(2), 259\u201370;\nsee also Barnes (1995), The Elements of Social Theory, chpt. 5.

See the Appendix at the end of this chapter for an incomplete\noverview (p. 381).\n52 B arnes (1992b), \u2018Status Groups and Collective Action,\u2019 pp. 260, 266, 263. 376 Science as Social Existence\nencourages collective action.\u2019 Our conveyance of, and susceptibility to,\nthese signals \u2014 our co-affectivity \u2014 \u2018is the basis of our sociability, and\nmay be taken as given in accounting for any particular manifestation\nor consequence of that sociability.\u201953 This is a description of social order\nin terms of the emotionally infused interaction of individuals who\nare biologically so predisposed. Barnes credits Thomas Scheff with\nhaving \u2018systematized\u2019 this description under the rubric of a \u2018deference-\nemotion system.\u201954 This is an interactive system in which \u2018the individual\nconstantly monitors how he or she stands in the eyes of others, and\nexperiences feelings of pride or shame accordingly.\u2019 However, it is\ndifficult to thematise and articulate these interactions: \u2018cultural taboos\noften prohibit explicit recognition of the system in everyday discourse,\nbecause the system is everywhere operative and hence not totally under\nthe conscious, calculative control of members themselves.\u201955 Once we\naccept the existence of this emotion-based dynamic \u2014 including\nits cognitive importance \u2014 then a largely uncharted research area\nopens itself up for exploration by science studies scholars. This is an\nopportunity not only to discover new facts about the way science is and\nhas been done, but also to develop new sociological and historiographic\nmethods by which to discover those facts.\nStatus groups are formed and sustained by members\u2019 elicitation\nof feelings of pride and shame in one another. One\u2019s behaviour will\nattract deference, on the one hand, or disregard, even disdain, on the\nother, depending on whether or not it promotes the collective good.\nThis collective good will vary between groups on the basis of their\ncontingent social and historical circumstances. In Chapter Four, we\nsaw that, historically, the idea of the good has played an essential role\nin organising understanding, enabling intelligibility, by allowing for\nnormative distinctions to be made between epistemically good and bad\nphenomena. We saw, furthermore, that Heidegger reinterprets Plato\u2019s\nidea of the good in terms of the for-the-sake-of-which, that is, the\n53 B arnes (1992b), \u2018Status Groups and Collective Action,\u2019 p. 263.\n54 Barnes (1995), The Elements of Social Theory, p. 72.

Conclusion: Subjects, Systems, and Other Unfinished Business 377\nexistential possibilities available to an engaged subjectivity. In Chapter\nSix, I read Heidegger as arguing that the collective good around which\nthe subjectivity of seventeenth-century experimental philosophers\norganised itself was the autonomous First Thing. In the dispute between\nRobert Boyle and Francis Line, the Galilean First Thing served as the\nmeasure according to which Boyle successfully excluded Line from the\ncommunity of experimentalists. Yet, I said nothing about the emotional\ndynamics which \u2014 on the present account \u2014 must have played a\nfundamental role in this dispute and its resolution. As a consequence,\nthe story remains half-told. More work still needs to be done in order to\ncomplete the historical picture.56\nIn his later writings, Heidegger argued, with von Weizs\u00e4cker\u2019s\nagreement, that the collective good around which the community of\nmodern physics organises itself is enframing. We should expect, on this\nargument, that the social interactions of modern physicists will be such\nthat they defer to those who promote enframing and disregard those\nwho do not. This is a sociological conjecture which requires empirical\ntesting in order to determine its truth value. Nevertheless, it suggests\nan explanation for the difference in attitude between Heidegger and\nvon Weizs\u00e4cker vis-\u00e0-vis enframing. It suggests that von Weizs\u00e4cker\u2019s\nprofessed \u2018obligation\u2019 to carry the systematisation of natural philosophy\nthrough to its end was, tacitly, an affective response to the deference-\nemotion dynamic characteristic of the status group to which he belonged.\nBy manifesting this feeling of obligation in his behaviour, he showed\nhimself to be an honourable member of his community.\nThe later Heidegger, in contrast, by failing to promote enframing,\nsignalled his distance from this community, his relative immunity to\nits internal emotional dynamic. Indeed, for him, this dynamic, and\nthe collective good it sustains, were a topic, rather than a resource,\nfor investigation. In his earlier work, on which this book has chiefly\nfocussed, Heidegger addresses that topic from the standpoint of a\nscientific philosophy, employing the methods of phenomenology. Like\n56 A natural departure point for this would be Steven Shapin\u2019s work on trust and\nhonour in seventeenth-century experimental philosophy (Steven Shapin (1994), A\nSocial History of Truth: Civility and Science in Seventeenth-Century England (Chicago:\nUniversity of Chicago Press)). See also Steven Shapin (2012), \u2018The Sciences of\nSubjectivity,\u2019 Social Studies of Science 42(2), 170\u201384, and a discussion thereof in\nKochan (2013), \u2018Subjectivity and Emotion in Scientific Research.\u2019 378 Science as Social Existence\nSSK, he sought, in part, to develop a scientific account of science, an\naccount based on an analysis of the subjectivity of the scientific subject.\nIn this analysis, the deference-emotion dynamic of modern science\nis treated as the combined result of the subject\u2019s affectivity and its\nbeing-with-others \u2014 as co-affectivity. The collective good sustained\nby co-affectivity is, in turn, treated as the combined result of the\nsubject\u2019s understanding, or projectivity, and its being-with-others \u2014 as\nco-understanding. Yet, the collective good can be experienced as\n\u2018good\u2019 only with the support of co-affectivity. Without co-affectivity,\nby which the collective good is constituted as good, co-understanding\nwill project only an image, absent the normative force necessary for it\nto be experienced as a compelling image. Hence, on this account, the\ncompelling nature, the goodness, of the mathematical projection of\nnature, of math\u0113sis \u2014 indeed, of enframing \u2014 entails co-affectivity.\nWithout co-affectivity, co-understanding will lack normative weight.\nInversely, without co-understanding, co-affectivity will lack order\nand direction. We saw the extreme consequence of this in Chapter Three,\nwith Heidegger\u2019s discussion of anxiety. Anxiety arises in the face of\nunintelligibility, a global breakdown in meaning, our failure to make\nsense of, to understand, the things around us. I argued that, in such rare\nsituations, we experience the thing as a thing-in-itself: we know that it\nis, but not what it is.\nHeidegger argues that the thing in the face of which we feel anxiety\nis \u2018completely indefinite\u2019; it is a thing \u2018essentially incapable of having\nan end-directedness [Bewandtnis].\u201957 In other words, without the\nbenefit of projectivity, we lack a final cause, an image by which to let\nthings be what they are, by which to get our bearings in the world.\nCo-understanding gives us a collective image, co-affectivity lends that\nimage normative weight, turning it into a measure. Hence, co-affectivity\ngrounds the normativity of a practice, and co-understanding grounds\nthe intelligibility, or order, of that practice. This reprises a key claim\nfrom Chapter Five, that a practice stripped of the final cause which\ngives it order and direction will amount to no more than random\nbehaviour. Thus, on its own, the deference-emotion dynamic produces\nonly random behaviour, never practice. Only when that dynamic\n57 Heidegger (1962a), Being and Time, p. 231 [186]; translation modified, my brackets.\nCf. Martin Heidegger (1927), Sein und Zeit (T\u00fcbingen: Max Niemeyer Verlag), p.\n186. 7. Conclusion: Subjects, Systems, and Other Unfinished Business 379\ncoalesces around and affirms an end, giving that end weight, will it\nproduce collective practice and social order. Enframing, as a normative\nforce, a collective good, is thus constituted, on Heidegger\u2019s account, in\nthe interactive, emotion-infused group dynamic of the modern physics\ncommunity. By carrying enframing along in this way, the community\nbecomes what it is. Indeed, on this account, every community becomes\nwhat it is by so affirming and carrying along the collective good, or\ngoods, which give it its characteristic shape. These are the conditions of\npossibility for social identity and order as such. The virtue of SSK and\nHeidegger\u2019s existential conception of science, indeed, the virtue of the\ntwo combined, is that they equip us with fundamental tools by which\nto topicalise and examine those conditions. In so doing, they promise to\nthrow new explanatory light on the workings of society, in general, and\nthe sciences, in particular.\nThe pursuit of this exciting research prospect has been, and will\ncontinue to be, met with resistance. Paradoxically, as we have seen,\nsome of the strongest criticism has come from those who themselves\npromote a practice-based theory of science. For them, a turn to\npractice entails the rejection of the scientific subject as an explanatory\nresource. Because SSK practitioners and the early Heidegger do not\nreject the explanatory importance of the subject, these critics conclude\nthat neither account is compatible with a practice-based theory. As\nI have argued, this conclusion is false, and the evidence educed in\nits favour collapses under scrutiny. This suggests that the critics\u2019\nmotivation may be not so much to champion the practice-based study\nof science, as to ensure that such studies proceed without critical\nattention to the contribution of the subject. The subject has not been\neliminated in these studies, but suppressed. Hence, subjectivity\ncontinues to circulate, tacitly and obscurely, in these practice-based\naccounts of science, while inquisitive scholars are denied the critical\ntools by which to address, analyse, and understand its role. To pinch\na phrase from Charles Baudelaire, under such circumstances, the\nscientist \u2014 including the social scientist \u2014 becomes \u2018a prince who\neverywhere rejoices in his incognito.\u201958\n58 C harles Baudelaire (1964 [1863]), \u2018The Painter of Modern Life,\u2019 in The Painter of\nModern Life and Others Essays, by Charles Baudelaire, trans. by Jonathan Mayne\n(London: Phaidon Press), pp. 1\u201340 (p. 9). 380 Science as Social Existence\nYet, what good is this incognito? I suggested earlier that the\nsuppression of inquiry into subjectivity may, in effect, grant free licence\nto an unrestrained constructivity, a subjectivity which knows neither\nsocial nor historical limits, even while it remains (perhaps unwittingly)\nconditioned by those limits. This amounts to a particular conception\nof human freedom, one challenged by SSK practitioners and the early\nHeidegger alike, both of whom, as we saw in Chapter Three, emphasise\nthe finitude of human cognition, and so espouse a policy of epistemic\nhumility. We might now say that, in challenging this conception of human\nfreedom, SSK practitioners and the early Heidegger signal their distance\nfrom a scholarly community in which that conception has acquired the\nnormative weight of a collective good. Their challenge displays their\nrelative immunity to the deference-emotion dynamic characteristic of\nthat community. But another, deeper observation can also be made.\nThrough the suppression of subjectivity, critical attention is deflected\nfrom the emotion-infused interactions by which knowledge is generated\nand sustained. Indeed, as noted earlier, Barnes argues that \u2018cultural\ntaboos\u2019 may prevent explicit recognition of the largely non-deliberative,\nbut nonetheless pervasively present deference-emotion dynamic of a\ncommunity. These taboos against thematising co-affectivity would seem\nstronger than similar taboos against thematising co-understanding.\nWith the suppression of subjectivity, co-affectivity seems to have been\nburied more deeply than co-understanding, perhaps because we are\ntaught that feelings are more private than thoughts. This may help to\nexplain why SSK practitioners and the early Heidegger both give more\nattention to thinking than to feeling, even as their respective accounts\ndirectly challenge this very distinction. As a consequence, the work of\nboth remains incomplete. This is good news for us, as it means there is\nstill much work left to be done. Instead of maintaining the established\narchitecture of a familiar intellectual territory, we have a chance to\nexplore new ground, to build new structures within fresh horizons, to\ncome together around these still largely unarticulated possibilities in\nour irrepressibly motley social existence. 7.

Acknowledgements\nAs I neared completion of this book, I was reminded of the idea that\nan isolated monkey tapping randomly on a keyboard for eternity\nwould produce all possible written works. How depressing it was to\nsuddenly realise that this book might just as well have been written by\na monkey. I nevertheless draw some comfort from the fact that this task\nhas taken me somewhat less than an eternity, and that I have not had to\nwork entirely in isolation. Small, sometimes almost imperceptible acts\nof friendship \u2014 both intellectual and otherwise \u2014 have had a way of\naccumulating over time to tremendous effect. I acknowledge this happy\ncircumstance, and express my thanks to all those concerned, even as I\nneglect to name names. There are also other, larger debts. I thank Trish\nGlazebrook and Simon Schaffer for their interest and encouragement\nat an early stage of this project. The penultimate draft was read in its\nentirety, or near entirety, by David Bloor, Andrew Buskell, Martin\nKusch, and Estheranna St\u00e4uble. I am very grateful to them all for their\nvaluable comments. Although the labour that went into this book did\nnot benefit from any direct financial support, over the span of the\nbook\u2019s production I did nevertheless receive financial and institutional\nsupport from several sources. Without this indirect benefit, I may not\nhave had the grit and dosh to keep on tapping. In this regard, I thank\nWolfgang Freitag, Michael Hampe, Hans Bernhard Schmid, Robert\nW. Smith, Marcel Weber, and, most especially, the Director, Staff, and\nFellows of the Zukunftskolleg, University of Konstanz, where most of\nthis book was written.\nWhile doing the research for this book, I relied, essentially, on the\npublically owned libraries of the University of Konstanz, the Swiss\nFederal Institute of Technology (ETH-Z\u00fcrich), and the Central Library 386 Science as Social Existence\nof Z\u00fcrich. I may never have written a book at all if I had not first, as\na child and youth, spent countless hours in the public libraries of the\nCity of Edmonton. Especially in the sub-zero winter months, these\nlibraries offered warm refuge for all city inhabitants, including the\npoor and homeless, whom I often saw reading newspapers and books,\nlistening to music, or testing one another at games of chess. This spirit of\na barrier-free knowledge commons is present also in the not-for-profit,\nopen-access publishing model of Open Book Publishers. I am delighted\nto be able to contribute to their admirable social enterprise.\nIt behoves me to thank Estheranna St\u00e4uble a second time, for reasons\nshe and I know best.

Noam Chomsky\nhttps://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/300 Science as Social Existence\nHeidegger and the Sociology of Scientifi c Knowledge\nJ K\nEFF OCHAN\nIn this bold and original study, Jeff Kochan construc\ufffd vely combines the\nsociology of scien\ufffd fi c knowledge (SSK) with Mar\ufffd n Heidegger\u2019s early existen\ufffd al\nconcep\ufffd on of science. Kochan shows convincingly that these apparently quite\ndiff erent approaches to science are, in fact, largely compa\ufffd ble, even mutually\nreinforcing.\nBy combining Heidegger with SSK, Kochan argues, we can explicate, elaborate,\nand empirically ground Heidegger\u2019s philosophy of science in a way that makes it\nmore accessible and useful for social scien\ufffd sts and historians of science. Likewise,\nincorpora\ufffd ng Heideggerian phenomenology into SSK renders SKK a more robust\nand a\ufffd rac\ufffd ve methodology for use by scholars in the interdisciplinary fi eld of\nScience and Technology Studies (STS). Kochan\u2019s ground-breaking reinterpreta\ufffd on\nof Heidegger also enables STS scholars to sustain a principled analy\ufffd cal focus\non scien\ufffd fi c subjec\ufffd vity, without running afoul of the orthodox subject-object\ndis\ufffd nc\ufffd on they o\ufffd en reject.\nScience as Social Existence is the fi rst book of its kind, unfurling its argument\nthrough a range of topics relevant to contemporary STS research. These include\nthe epistemology and metaphysics of scien\ufffd fi c prac\ufffd ce, as well as the methods\nof explana\ufffd on appropriate to social scien\ufffd fi c and historical studies of science.\nThis volume puts concentrated emphasis on the compa\ufffd bility of Heidegger\u2019s\nexisten\ufffd al concep\ufffd on of science with the historical sociology of scien\ufffd fi c\nknowledge, pursuing this combina\ufffd on at both macro- and micro-historical levels.\nBeau\ufffd fully wri\ufffd en and accessible, this book puts new and powerful tools into\nthe hands of sociologists and historians of science, cultural theorists of science,\nHeidegger scholars, and pluralist philosophers of science.\nAs with all Open Book publica\ufffd ons, this volume is available to read for free on the\npublisher\u2019s website.
